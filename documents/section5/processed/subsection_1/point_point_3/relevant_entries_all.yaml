  explanation: 'The primary purpose of this study is to downscale SMAP satellite soil
    moisture data to a higher resolution using a stacking fusion model integrated
    with terrain partitioning. The specific objective of the study is to evaluate
    the effectiveness of this downscaling approach and the impact of terrain partitioning
    on downscaling accuracy. The research team selected Anhui Province, China, as
    the study area due to its diverse terrain features. The main findings of the study
    are as follows:


    Using a stacking strategy that combines extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost), light
    gradient boosting machine (LightGBM), and categorical boosting (CatBoost), the
    study demonstrates that the stacking model outperforms individual models in terms
    of downscaling accuracy. Specifically, they found that the stacking model achieved
    the highest correlation coefficients (R) and lowest root mean square errors (RMSE)
    across all regions in the study area.


    In comparing the downscaled soil moisture (SM) with measured SM at 87 sites, the
    study shows that the downscaled SM generally has high accuracy, with 60% of the
    sites exhibiting strong correlation (R > 0.6) and an average unbiased RMSE of
    0.040 m3/m3, meeting the accuracy requirements of SMAP products. Moreover, the
    downscaled SM was able to capture the temporal dynamics of SM and respond positively
    to rainfall events, with both downscaled SM and downscaled SM (WP) showing positive
    responses to rainfall events.


    In analyzing the spatial distribution of downscaled SM, the study found that the
    downscaling approach was able to preserve the overall trend of SMAP L4-SM while
    enriching the details. The downscaled SM exhibited higher values in humid regions
    and lower values in semi-humid regions, consistent with the actual soil moisture
    conditions.


    Through an analysis of the input predictors used in the downscaling models, the
    study reveals that the most influential factors include day of year (DOY), clay
    content, and digital elevation model (DEM). DOY was found to play a crucial role
    due to its ability to capture seasonal variations in SM. Clay content was identified
    as a significant factor due to its impact on water retention capacity, while DEM
    influenced SM dynamics based on the complex interactions with other factors such
    as land cover and vegetation.'

    machine learning 1. Introduction Soil moisture (SM) is an important component
    of the global water cycle, affecting rainfall and temperature through evapotranspiration
    processes [1]. Its variation not only relates to plant growth and agricultural
    production, but also to global climate change and extreme climate events, such
    as droughts, floods, and heat waves [2]. In the past, the acquisition of SM data
    has mainly relied on manual sampling and site observations [3]. In situ SM can
    be interpolated to a larger area by geostatistical techniques. However, the practical
    application is unsatisfactory, and the interpolation results have great uncertainty
    in complex surfaces [4]. Therefore, the observation based on point scale makes
    it challenging to meet the monitoring needs of SM at a regional or global scale.
    The remote sensing technique reduces the cost of SM measurements and allows continuous
    monitoring over a large scale. Microwave remote sensing has unique advantages
    in SM monitoring, as it is not affected by weather conditions, has a certain penetration
    ability, and captures SM information in the vertical profile [5]. Previous studies
    have found that L-band is less affected by surface roughness and vegetation types
    [6], and Soil Moisture Active Passive (SMAP), represented by L-band, has higher
    accuracy and robustness than other remotely sensed SM products [7]. SMAP L4 products
    provide estimates of surface (0–5 cm) and root zone (0–100 cm) SM at a 9 km spatial
    resolution. These products also fill in the gaps in SMAP observations caused by
    orbit and land surface characteristics, thus providing spatially and temporally
    more complete SM products [8]. However, 9 km resolution is still too coarse for
    many applications that require finer scale data, such as in agriculture, hydrology,
    and ecology. Therefore, it is necessary to develop methods to downscale SMAP products
    to higher resolutions, such as 1 km or finer. There are many classifications for
    downscaling methods [9,10,11]. Zhao et al. [9] categorized downscaling methods
    into three types based on the relational models used: empirical methods, semi-empirical
    methods, and physics-based methods. Among these methods, empirical methods are
    based on a priori knowledge and operate under the assumption that the model’s
    scale remains consistent. They apply a relational model, established at a coarse
    resolution, to high-resolution downscaling factors, thereby producing the downscaled
    SM. This method has been widely used due to its simplicity. Machine learning (ML)
    belongs to the category of empirical methods, which has a strong ability to deal
    with nonlinear issues [12]. It expresses the relationship between SM and downscaling
    factors more reasonably under the lack of a physical background, overcoming the
    limitations of empirical methods and physical-based models. ML techniques have
    many cases in the field of passive microwave SM downscaling. Part of the studies
    performed downscaling directly through a single model. For instance, Wei et al.
    [13] used the gradient boosting decision tree (GBDT) algorithm to downscale SMAP
    products and obtained promising results in most regions, although improvements
    are still needed in areas with denser vegetation cover. Karthikeyan et al. [14]
    generated a multi-layer SM product using the extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost)
    algorithm, and demonstrated that the method has high accuracy, with ubRMSE less
    than 0.040 m3/m3 at most sites. Another part of the studies selected the best
    performing one for downscaling by comparing a series of models in the training
    phase. Rao et al. [15] adopted a combination of multiple ML methods to downscale
    SMAP SM, including multiple linear regression (MLR), support vector regression
    (SVR), artificial neural networks (ANNs), random forest (RF) and XGBoost. They
    found that XGBoost was selected most frequently and had the highest accuracy,
    followed by RF. Similarly, Yan et al. [16] compared three ML algorithms: RF, SVR,
    and k-nearest neighbors (KNN) for AMSR-E and AMSR2 products. They found that RF
    had the best accuracy and used it to establish seasonal downscaling models. Despite
    the success of these studies, there are still some potential concerns. A single
    ML model is prone to overfitting in a multidimensional feature space and may not
    fulfill both performance and stability requirements. The Stacking fusion model
    is a heterogeneous ensemble method that can effectively combine the advantages
    of multiple models and obtain better results than a single model. Its advancement
    has been verified in the landslide susceptibility assessment [17], biomass estimation
    [18], visibility prediction [19] and other remote sensing related fields. However,
    to our knowledge, the potential of this method in the field of SM downscaling
    has not been fully explored. Therefore, this study attempted to improve the resolution
    and accuracy of SMAP products by using the Stacking fusion model. We chose three
    models as the base estimators for Stacking: XGBoost, light gradient boosting machine
    (LightGBM), and categorical boosting (CatBoost). They are improved algorithms
    based on GBDT, with excellent generalization ability [20]. The superiority of
    XGBoost and LightGBM in SM downscaling has been confirmed [14,21]. CatBoost is
    widely used in various ML tasks due to its advantages in dealing with categorical
    features and regression issues [22,23]. But its applications in SM downscaling
    are relatively limited, and it is necessary to evaluate its applicability. To
    enhance the interpretability of the downscaling model, auxiliary data closely
    related to SM are required. Land Surface Temperature (LST) and Vegetation Index
    (VI) are the most commonly used factors that form a feature space to describe
    the surface water and heat exchange process, also known as the triangular feature
    space [24]. In addition, Bai et al. [25] found that combining optical/infrared
    data with synthetic aperture radar (SAR) data can obtain better downscaling results
    in semi-arid areas with low vegetation cover. This is due to the fact that C-band
    radar can penetrate the soil surface and directly detect the surface SM content,
    while optical data has an indirect relationship with SM. In other words, multi-source
    data can reflect SM changes from different perspectives, thereby complementing
    the limitations of each data type. Apart from the dynamic variables mentioned
    above, some static variables also have a significant impact on SM, such as topography,
    soil properties, and land cover [21,26]. They are more important than dynamic
    variables because they determine the primary level and spatial pattern of SM at
    a specific location, and act as constraint conditions for the downscaling model.
    Dynamic variables predominantly capture the short-term fluctuations of SM, which
    are influenced by climate and vegetation. Karthikeyan et al. [14] first identified
    homogeneous regions by predictors in their study, and then performed SM downscaling
    by region. They suggested that ML algorithms based on homogeneous regions may
    solve the extrapolation problem. This inspires our study: we want to explore whether
    downscaling accuracy can be improved by partitioning modeling in regions with
    complex topography. In summary, the main objective of this study is to downscale
    SMAP L4-SM products using multi-source data through the Stacking strategy. In
    particular, we selected Anhui Province, which has a rich and easily distinguishable
    terrain, as the study area. This study compared the accuracy differences between
    downscaling models with and without terrain partitioning. Furthermore, we performed
    a comprehensive validation of the downscaling results through ground measured
    SM and precipitation data, as well as other 1km SM products. We also analyzed
    the impact of different sources of downscaling factors on SM. The contributions
    of this study are (1) Validating the applicability of the Stacking fusion model
    in passive microwave SM downscaling. (2) Exploring whether the strategy based
    on terrain partitioning can improve the downscaling accuracy. (3) Analyzing how
    different downscaling factors influence SM. 2. Study Area and Data 2.1. Study
    Area Anhui Province (29°41′–34°38′N, 114°54′–119°37′E; Figure 1) is situated in
    eastern China and is significantly influenced by monsoon climate. It has an average
    annual temperature of 14–17 °C and an average annual precipitation of 773–1670
    mm. The topography of Anhui province is diverse [27], with higher elevation in
    the south and lower in the north, consisting of five geomorphic units: Huai Bei
    Plain (HB), Jiang Huai Hilly (JH), Wan Xi Mountain (WX), Yan Jiang Plain (YJ),
    and Wan Nan Mountain (WN). This paper will use these abbreviations to describe
    these geomorphic units, respectively. Figure 1. Location of the study area. HB
    is located in the north of Anhui province, accounting for about 27% of the total
    area, with flat terrain and fertile soil, making it the largest agricultural center
    in the province. JH covers around 23% of the total area, characterized by relatively
    low terrain and abundant water resources. YJ, spanning about 21% of the total
    area, is situated along the Yangtze River. It has a dense river network and well-developed
    paddy agriculture. WX and WN make up approximately 29% of the total area and are
    dominated by forest, with higher elevation. 2.2. Research Data The data used in
    this study included ground measured SM, SMAP SM, MODIS products, Sentinel-1 data,
    DEM, soil property data, and precipitation data, all from the period of 1 April
    to 1 November 2019. Table 1 provides a description of these datasets. Table 1.
    Description of datasets used in this study. 2.2.1. Ground Measured SM Data The
    ground measured SM data are provided by the Anhui Hydrology Bureau. There are
    87 SM sites, of which 11 are located in WN, 5 in WX, 18 in YJ, 16 in JH, and 37
    in HB (Figure 1). These sites collect SM data at three standard depths (10 cm,
    20 cm, and 40 cm) on the 1st, 11th, and 21st of each month at 8:00 AM using the
    drying method. Validation of downscaling results with measured SM at 10 cm may
    introduce some uncertainty as the SMAP L4 represents SM at a depth of 5 cm. It
    has been demonstrated that SM of two consecutive soil layers is strongly correlated
    [28], therefore inconsistency in measurement depths has little effect on the correlation
    assessment. Theoretically, SM at 10 cm will be slightly higher than that at 5
    cm as a result of infiltration and evapotranspiration. 2.2.2. SMAP SM Data SMAP
    is a satellite mission launched by the National Aeronautics and Space Administration
    (NASA) in 2015 to monitor the global distribution of SM and freeze–thaw states
    at the Earth’s surface. The satellite is equipped with an L-band radar and an
    L-band radiometer, which synergistically enhance the accuracy and spatial resolution
    of SM retrievals [29]. The SMAP L4-SM data used in this study were acquired from
    the National Snow and Ice Data Centre (NSIDC) (https://nsidc.org/data/smap, accessed
    on 10 April 2023). It is generated every three hours, and data from 6:00 AM to
    9:00 AM were selected to match the observation time of the measured SM. 2.2.3.
    Modis Products MODIS is a crucial data source for constructing downscaling models
    in this study, providing continuous data with a spatial resolution of 250 m–1
    km for important features such as spectral indices and surface temperature. All
    MODIS products used in this paper have been listed in Table 1, among which the
    MCD12Q1 provides LC data at 500 m resolution for 2019, MOD15A2H provides LAI data
    at 500 m every 8 days, and MOD11A1 provides LST data at 1 km per day. Additionally,
    MOD09A1 provides reflectance data at 500 m resolution every 8 days, and four spectral
    indices were calculated to provide information on surface vegetation, water bodies,
    and soils. The expressions for these indices are as follows: 𝑁𝐷𝑉𝐼=(𝑛𝑖𝑟−𝑟𝑒𝑑)/(𝑛𝑖𝑟+𝑟𝑒𝑑)
    (1) 𝐸𝑉𝐼=2.5∗(𝑛𝑖𝑟−𝑟𝑒𝑑)/(𝑛𝑖𝑟+6∗𝑟𝑒𝑑−7.5∗𝑏𝑙𝑢𝑒+1) (2) 𝑁𝐷𝑊𝐼=(𝑔𝑟𝑒𝑒𝑛−𝑛𝑖𝑟)/(𝑔𝑟𝑒𝑒𝑛+𝑛𝑖𝑟)
    (3) 𝑁𝑆𝐷𝑆𝐼=(𝑠𝑤𝑖𝑟1−𝑠𝑤𝑖𝑟2)/𝑠𝑤𝑖𝑟1 (4) where red, nir, blue, and green correspond to
    bands 1–4 of MODIS, and swir1 and swir2 correspond to bands 6–7, respectively.
    Furthermore, MCD43A3 provides albedo data in visible, near infrared, and shortwave
    bands. Since the difference between the mean values of white-sky albedo and black-sky
    albedo is small and highly correlated [30], their mean values in the shortwave
    band were used as an approximation of surface albedo in this study. 2.2.4. Sentinel-1
    Data Sentinel-1 is composed of two polar-orbiting satellites, Sentinel-1A and
    Sentinel-1B, both equipped with C-band synthetic aperture radar (SAR) sensors
    to monitor land and ocean surfaces. It has a 12-day repeat cycle and can operate
    in four imaging modes: strip map (SM), interferometric wide swath (IW), extra-wide
    swath (EW), and wave (WV). The IW mode is the main mode for land surface observation,
    providing 10 m resolution images in both VV and VH polarizations. In this study,
    the ascending orbit data of Sentinel-1 in the IW mode were utilized, and a sliding
    time window processing method was applied to generate daily radar data. The window
    had a size of 12 days, containing 6 days before and after each day. This setup
    ensured that each day’s radar data had an equal temporal span, thus avoiding data
    gaps. Within the sliding time window, daily radar data were obtained by averaging
    all the Sentinel-1 images. 2.2.5. Topographic Data Topography plays an important
    role in SM downscaling, which is closely related to the climate, surface runoff,
    and the water cycle, etc. The distribution of SM at different scales is strongly
    influenced by topography (e.g., elevation, slope), and many studies have used
    topographic features for SM downscaling [21]. In this study, the Shuttle Radar
    Topography Mission (SRTM) data from the GEE platform were used with a spatial
    resolution of 90 m. 2.2.6. Soil Property Data Soil properties (proportion of clay,
    sand, and silt) are also vital predictors, which determine the permeability of
    surface water and the water-holding capacity of soil. The soil property data used
    in this study were downloaded from the Harmonized World Soil Database (HWSD) [31].
    This dataset adopted the FAO-90 soil classification system, which encompassed
    physical and chemical characteristics of topsoil (0–30 cm) and subsoil (30–100
    cm). The clay, sand, and silt data of topsoil were extracted and cropped to the
    study area. 2.2.7. Precipitation Data Precipitation is another important climatic
    factor that affects SM dynamics besides surface temperature, and the soil response
    to rainfall differs across depths [32]. Time series precipitation data are commonly
    used to validate downscaled SM. The Climate Hazards Group InfraRed Precipitation
    with Station dataset (CHIRPS), which combines 0.05° resolution satellite imagery
    and in situ station data, is currently updated to version 2.0 and provides global
    precipitation data from 1981 to the present. In this study, CHIRPS data were acquired
    through the GEE platform as a validation set for the downscaling results. 2.2.8.
    Other SM Products Two SM products with a spatial resolution of 1 km were selected
    for comparison with downscaled SM. The first is SMCI1.0 (Soil Moisture of China
    by in situ data, version 1.0), produced by Shangguan et al. [33]. It provides
    daily SM data from 2000 to 2020 and consists of 10 depth layers (10–100 cm), offering
    two versions with different resolutions of 30 s (~1 km) and 0.1 deg (~9 km). The
    product is available from the National Tibetan Plateau Science Data Center (https://cstr.cn/18406.11.Terre.tpdc.272415,
    accessed on 6 May 2023). This study obtained SMCI1.0 SM at 10 cm depth with a
    spatial resolution of 1 km as one of the validation datasets. Moreover, SMAP released
    the SMAP-derived 1 km downscaled surface SM product (abbreviated as SMAP D-SM)
    in March 2023, which contains global daily 1 km resolution surface SM [34]. Currently
    version 1 data are available from the NSIDC Center, and daily SM data during the
    study period were obtained as another validation dataset (https://nsidc.org/data/smap,
    accessed on 25 April 2023). The product has two bands: band 1 represents the data
    for the ascending orbit (6 AM) and band 2 for the descending orbit (6 PM). Given
    the high number of missing values, we combined the two bands to fill in the missing
    values of the AM data with the PM data. 3. Methods Section 3.1 illustrates the
    data preparation process based on GEE. Section 3.2 introduces three improved algorithms
    for GBDT: XGBoost, CatBoost, and LightGBM, which are tree-based ML methods that
    differ in model construction, feature processing, and target optimization. To
    integrate the advantages of the three models, this study adopts the Stacking strategy.
    This subsection can be realized with the scikit-learn library for Python3 and
    Jupyter Notebook. Section 3.3 demonstrates the overall downscaling strategy and
    provides a schematic diagram. Finally, Section 3.4 presents several metrics to
    evaluate the downscaling results. 3.1. Data Preparation Some low-quality pixels
    may be observed in the MODIS products due to noise (mainly clouds). To maintain
    the spatial continuity and consistency of the data while minimizing the outliers,
    low-quality pixels were first filtered out through the quality control bands in
    each MODIS dataset. Then, for the daily-scale data (MOD11A1, MCD43A3), the missing
    values were filled in by linear interpolation using the valid values of the images
    within 15 days before and after. Similarly, for the 8-day scale data (MOD09A1,
    MOD15A2H), images of intermediate dates were generated by linear interpolation.
    To further improve the quality and smoothness of the interpolated data, the SG
    (Savitzky–Golay) filter was introduced. This method utilizes polynomials for the
    least-squares fitting of values within a moving window, effectively removing noise
    while preserving the trend of data [35]. There are two important parameters of
    the SG filter, the half-width of the sliding window, m, and the order of the polynomial,
    d. Specifically, m determines the amount of data considered by the filter, while
    d defines the order of the polynomial used in the filter. A larger m and smaller
    d result in a smoother filtering result. After several tests, this study set m
    to 5 and d to 4. MCD12Q1 is an annual product with five classification schemes.
    This study selected Land Cover Type 5, the Plant Functional Type (PFT) scheme,
    which includes 8 biomes and 4 other land cover types, totaling 12 types. The area
    of each class was calculated and reclassified to reduce the complexity and uncertainty
    of classification (Table 2). Water bodies were excluded to minimize the negative
    impacts on downscaling performance. Table 2. MCD12Q1 (PFT) land cover types and
    reclassification scheme. 3.2. Machine Learning Methods 3.2.1. XGBoost XGBoost
    is an ensemble learning method based on the GBDT algorithm proposed by Chen and
    Guestrin [36]. Compared to the traditional GBDT algorithm, XGBoost adopts the
    second-order derivative to expedite model convergence, thereby enhancing optimization
    efficiency. It also incorporates a regularization term to control the model complexity.
    Moreover, XGBoost can handle samples with missing features by assigning them to
    the left or right subtrees based on their gain. 3.2.2. LightGBM LightGBM was created
    by Microsoft in 2017 [37]. It is also based on GBDT and employs a histogram-splitting
    algorithm that greatly reduces the time complexity. Unlike other decision tree
    algorithms that operate level-wise, LightGBM uses a leaf-wise algorithm with depth
    limits, which reduces unnecessary computation. Additionally, LightGBM utilizes
    the gradient-based one-side sampling (GOSS) algorithm to remove samples with small
    gradients and prioritize under-trained data, making it particularly effective
    for handling large datasets. 3.2.3. CatBoost CatBoost is based on oblivious trees,
    developed by Yandex [38]. Oblivious trees are a special type of decision tree
    that are characterized by the use of the same features for node division at each
    level, which can minimize the depth of the tree and memory consumption. By using
    the ordered boosting method, CatBoost addresses the prediction shift problem inherent
    in traditional gradient boosting algorithms, thus avoiding target leakage and
    overfitting. 3.2.4. Stacking Model Current prevailing ensemble learning methods
    include Bagging, Boosting, and Stacking. Bagging and Boosting are homogeneous
    ensemble algorithms, and their base estimators are generated by the same algorithm.
    Stacking is a heterogeneous ensemble approach that observes different aspects
    of the data through different models. It is essentially a stratified structure
    where each layer can contain multiple estimators. In the case of two layers, the
    base estimator in the first layer receives its predictions from the training data
    and then passes them to the second layer for further study. This stratified structure
    allows different models to complement each other, ultimately creating a more powerful
    model. Considering the base models used in this study, the steps of Stacking are
    shown in Figure 2. Figure 2. Schematic of the Stacking strategy. 3.3. Construction
    of Downscaling Framework Based on Stacking Strategy ML methods have been widely
    applied in SM downscaling. Some studies experiment directly with a single model,
    while others compare the performance of models during the training phase to select
    the best one. However, relying on a single model may not fully capture the complexity
    of SM distribution, especially when dealing with multiple influencing factors.
    This study proposed a Stacking fusion model for SM downscaling with a total of
    15 predictors, including NDVI, NDWI, NSDSI, EVI, VV, VH, LAI, LST, Albedo, sand,
    silt, clay, DEM, LC, and DOY (day of that year). Figure 3 illustrates the framework
    of downscaling, specifically: Figure 3. Schematic of the proposed downscaling
    framework. Data preparation: in Section 3.1, we performed quality control, gap-filling,
    and SG filtering on MODIS data through the GEE platform, simplifying the land
    cover types and removing the water bodies. Data processing: To standardize the
    spatial resolution of all predictors to 1 km and 9 km, the MCD12Q1 dataset was
    aggregated using the mode method and the remaining datasets were aggregated using
    the mean method. The coordinate systems for all datasets were unified to the UTM
    projection system with WGS84 datum. Sample generation: The 9 km features and SMAP
    L4-SM were sampled according to the terrain partition (HB, JH, WX, YJ, WN). Besides
    remotely sensed features, DOY was added to indicate the generation time of features.
    Model construction: Taking the WN region as an example, the samples collected
    in this region were randomly divided into the training set and test set with a
    ratio of 7:3. XGBoost, LightGBM, and CatBoost were trained using the five-fold
    cross validation method and fused through the Stacking strategy. The test set
    was not involved in training and only used for model evaluation. It is worth mentioning
    that, to test the effectiveness of terrain partitioning, we also trained a Stacking
    model without partitioning. Model application: The trained Stacking models were
    then applied to the 1 km resolution features to generate downscaled SM for each
    region, and finally the downscaled results were merged by date. Validation: The
    downscaling results were validated using the measured SM from 87 sites, together
    with precipitation data. Furthermore, we compared the SMCI1.0 and SMAP D-SM products
    as well as the downscaled SM without partitioning. 3.4. Evaluation Method To fully
    evaluate the proposed downscaling framework, several metrics were introduced [39].
    The correlation coefficient (R) and the root mean square error (RMSE) were used
    to assess the performance of the trained model, measuring the difference between
    the predicted and true values. The bias and unbiased RMSE (ubRMSE) were also applied.
    UbRMSE is commonly used in SM downscaling studies, and the SMAP requirement for
    ubRMSE is less than 0.040 m3/m3. These four metrics are calculated as follows:
    𝑅= 𝐸[( 𝑦 𝑆𝑀𝐴𝑃 −𝐸[ 𝑦 𝑆𝑀𝐴𝑃 ])( 𝑦 𝑚𝑒𝑎𝑠𝑢𝑟𝑒𝑑 −𝐸[ 𝑦 𝑚𝑒𝑎𝑠𝑢𝑟𝑒𝑑 ])] 𝜎 𝑆𝑀𝐴𝑃 𝜎 𝑚𝑒𝑎𝑠𝑢𝑟𝑒𝑑 (5)
    𝑅𝑀𝑆𝐸= 𝐸[ ( 𝑦 𝑆𝑀𝐴𝑃 − 𝑦 𝑚𝑒𝑎𝑠𝑢𝑟𝑒𝑑 ) 2 − − − − − − − − − − − − − − − − − − √ ] (6)
    𝑏𝑖𝑎𝑠=𝐸[ 𝑦 𝑆𝑀𝐴𝑃 ]−𝐸[ 𝑦 𝑚𝑒𝑎𝑠𝑢𝑟𝑒𝑑 ] (7) 𝑢𝑏𝑅𝑀𝑆𝐸= 𝑅𝑀𝑆 𝐸 2 − 𝑏𝑖𝑎𝑠 2 − − − − − − − −
    − − − − √ (8) where E[•] represents the mean operator, 𝑦 𝑚𝑒𝑎𝑠𝑢𝑟𝑒𝑑  and 𝑦 𝑆𝑀𝐴𝑃
    refer to the measured SM and SMAP SM; and 𝜎 𝑆𝑀𝐴𝑃 and 𝜎 𝑚𝑒𝑎𝑠𝑢𝑟𝑒𝑑 are the standard
    deviations of the SMAP SM and measured SM, respectively. 4. Results 4.1. Validation
    of Downscaling Framework A total of 310,935 samples were obtained by sampling
    the feature dataset and SMAP L4 dataset at 9 km spatial resolution during the
    study period. For each region, XGBoost, LightGBM, and CatBoost models were trained
    using the five-fold cross validation method, and their prediction results were
    fused by the Stacking strategy. Table 3 displays the number of samples for each
    region and the performance of the models in the training and test sets. It is
    evident that all models achieved R values exceeding 0.9 and RMSE values below
    0.028 m3/m3 on both training and testing sets, indicating a strong correlation
    between the model predictions and the actual values. The four models successfully
    captured the relationship among the features and target at a coarse scale. In
    addition, they exhibited similar R and RMSE values on their respective training
    and test sets, which further demonstrated that they were not overfitted. Table
    3. Number of samples and performance of XGBoost, LightGBM, CatBoost and Stacking
    models on training and test sets for each region (HB, JH, WX, YJ, and WN). Bold
    indicates the best model score. The unit of RMSE is m3/m3. The model’s performance
    on the test set determines its ability to generalize to unknown data. Figure 4
    reveals that the Stacking model outperformed the others, with the highest R and
    the lowest RMSE in each region. XGBoost had comparable performance to Stacking
    model and was the most robust of the three base models. CatBoost also showed reliable
    accuracy, confirming its feasibility for the SM downscaling task. While LightGBM
    had the fastest training speed, its performance was slightly inferior to the other
    models. Surprisingly, the WN region had the best simulation results among the
    five regions (Stacking: R:0.989; RMSE:0.011 m3/m3), followed by the WX region
    (Stacking: R:0.981; RMSE:0.014 m3/m3), which may be attributed to the quality
    of the samples. Figure 4. Performance of XGBoost, LightGBM, CatBoost, and Stacking
    on the test set. 4.2. Overall Performance of Downscaled SM Downscaled SM was validated
    using the measured SM data collected from April to November 2019. Figure 5 shows
    the distribution of R and ubRMSE values for 87 sites. Overall, most sites exhibited
    satisfactory performance. Regarding R values, 52 sites performed well (R > 0.60;
    60% of the total), 26 sites showed moderate performance (0.4 < R < 0.6; 30%),
    and 9 sites performed poorly (R < 0.4; 10%), including one with extremely weak
    correlation (R < 0). The 9 poorly performing sites were mainly located in the
    HB and JH regions, characterized by flat terrain and predominantly agricultural,
    so the weaker correlation may be attributed to the irrigation conditions in these
    regions. This emphasizes the influence of human activities on SM and the sensitivity
    of the downscaling approach to such impacts. In addition, the average ubRMSE value
    for these 87 sites was 0.040 m3/m3, with 45 sites that met the SMAP accuracy requirements
    for ubRMSE (ubRMSE < 0.040 m3/m3), 38 sites showed acceptable errors (0.040 m3/m3
    < ubRMSE < 0.060 m3/m3), and 4 sites underperformed (ubRMSE > 0.060 m3/m3), mainly
    in the JH and WN regions. Figure 5. Spatial distribution of (a) R and (b) ubRMSE
    between downscaled SM and measured SM at 87 SM sites from 1 April to 1 November
    2019. To further compare the downscaled SM across different regions, bias was
    introduced to assess the deviation between downscaled SM and measured SM. As shown
    in Figure 6, the positions of points represent the values of R and ubRMSE, and
    the colors reflect the bias values. Red indicates a dry bias, while blue signifies
    a wet bias, and the darker the color, the more severe the deviation. The results
    revealed that the downscaled SM in the HB and JH regions exhibited significant
    dry bias. Among the 37 sites in the HB region, 33 sites had bias values less than
    0, as well as for 14 out of 16 sites in the JH region. The average bias values
    for these two regions were −0.050 m3/m3 and −0.034 m3/m3. Conversely, the WX,
    YJ, and WN regions displayed a clear wet bias, especially in the WN region, with
    average bias values of 0.029 m3/m3, 0.026 m3/m3, and 0.090 m3/m3, respectively.
    The fundamental reason for deviation was that the original SMAP products had certain
    uncertainties due to the coarse resolution as well as the effects of vegetation
    and surface roughness, which inevitably affected the performance of the downscaled
    SM. Moreover, the deviation was related to the methods of obtaining SM data at
    different scales. The measured SM was collected based on ground observations,
    representing specific SM values at 10 cm depth, while the downscaled SM represented
    approximate average SM values at 5 cm depth within 1 km. Figure 6. The relationships
    between measured SM and downscaled SM. (a) HB, (b) JH, (c) WX, (d) YJ, and (e)
    WN. The color of the points represents the bias value. n represents the number
    of sites, and sites with a correlation coefficient less than 0 are excluded from
    the figure. We compared all SM products with measured SM and plotted their R,
    bias, RMSE, and ubRMSE values. As shown in Figure 7, the downscaled SM generally
    had higher correlation coefficients, with a mean R value of 0.613 and a median
    R value of 0.659. SMAP L4-SM is the original coarse-resolution product, which
    had comparable accuracy with the downscaled SM (mean R: 0.605; median R: 0.648).
    Yet, the downscaled SM showed a significant reduction in R outliers. The downscaled
    SM(WP) is a downscaled version of SM obtained without partition modeling. It also
    showed reliable accuracy, with a mean R value of 0.551 and a median R value of
    0.610. Compared with SMAP L4-SM, both downscaled SM and downscaled SM(WP) displayed
    a narrower range of bias values and were closer to 0. This may be explained by
    the fact that the downscaling process introduced more details, making the results
    closer to the measured SM. Although the RMSE values of the downscaled SM were
    slightly higher than downscaled SM(WP), its ubRMSE values were generally lower
    and exhibited less variability, suggesting higher overall accuracy. This demonstrated
    the feasibility of the Stacking model in SM downscaling field and proved the effectiveness
    of the terrain-based partitioning modeling strategy. The SMAP D-SM showed the
    most significant variation of all the metrics, implying the instability of its
    performance. This product consists of two bands representing SM values at 6 AM
    and 6 PM. Given the high number of missing values in a single band, the practice
    of using the 6 PM values to fill in the 6 AM missing values may have introduced
    additional uncertainties, leading to inconsistent overall performance. Furthermore,
    the algorithm of the product itself also has an impact. The SMCI1.0 product presented
    the lowest R level and the highest wet bias (mean bias: 0.089 m3/m3; median bias:
    0.076 m3/m3), probably related to the data and method used by the authors. In
    summary, the Stacking model successfully improved the accuracy of SM, especially
    under the terrain partitioning modeling strategy. Figure 7. Comparison of all
    SM products with measured SM. SMAP L4-SM denotes the original 9 km SMAP product.
    SMCI1.0 refers to the 1 km SM product of Shangguan et al. SMAP D-SM is the 1 km
    SM product released by SMAP in March 2023. Downscaled SM is the 1 km downscaling
    results of this study. Downscaled SM(WP) indicates the 1 km downscaling results
    without partition modeling. 4.3. Temporal Dynamics of Downscaled SM To verify
    whether downscaled SM can capture the temporal dynamics of SM and respond to rainfall
    events, we randomly selected 11 sites and plotted a series of charts. In Figure
    8, the first column shows the analysis results of all SM products (SMCI1.0, SMAP
    D-SM, SMAP L4-SM, downscaled SM, downscaled SM (WP)) along with measured SM, and
    precipitation data. The second column keeps only SMAP L4-SM, downscaled SM, and
    measured SM, highlighting the R, bias, and ubRMSE metrics before and after downscaling.
    We identified these sites using CODE-Region-LC numbers, where CODE stands for
    site code, Region for location, and LC for land cover type. The findings suggested
    that both downscaled SM and downscaled SM(WP) had strong temporally consistent
    behavior with SMAP L4-SM and captured the dynamic changes of SM. This observation
    was consistent for all sites. Surprisingly, downscaled SM eliminated the systematic
    deviation of SMAP to a certain extent, making the results closer to the measured
    SM. For instance, SMAP L4 underestimated the surface SM at site 50,637,471, resulting
    in a strong dry bias (bias = 0.094 m3/m3), while downscaled SM minimized it to
    0.010 m3/m3. Similar dry bias corrections were found at sites 50,435,400 and 50,901,400.
    Overestimation can also be mitigated by downscaled SM, as exemplified by sites
    62,905,301 and 70,140,600, where the bias was adjusted from 0.068 m3/m3 and 0.093
    m3/m3 to 0.017 m3/m3 and −0.025 m3/m3, respectively. Figure 8. Time series comparisons
    of SMCI1.0, SMAP D-SM, SMAP L4-SM, downscaled SM, downscaled SM (WP), measured
    SM, and precipitation data at 11 selected SM sites. Note: 2019-10-01 is not displayed
    because only one site had valid measured SM data on that day. Although in some
    cases, the downscaled SM still had a large bias, such as the wet bias of 0.071
    m3/m3 at site 62,909,502; there was already a noticeable improvement compared
    to the original SMAP L4-SM which had a wet bias of 0.138 m3/m3. In contrast, the
    bias correction ability of downscaled SM (WP) was relatively unstable. Some sites
    improved (50,801,100, 62,921,000), while others actually worsened (50,637,471,
    62,802,800), which reaffirmed the advancement of the partitioning strategy. Moreover,
    Figure 8 illustrates that almost every rainfall event corresponded with an increase
    in SM, and both SMAP L4-SM and downscaled SM responded positively. The blue boxes
    in Figure 8 highlight significant increases in SM during rainfall events, and
    the yellow boxes indicate a gradual return of SM after rainfall. Such phenomena
    have existed at any time period. SMCI1.0 tended to overestimate at most sites,
    and SMAP D-SM fluctuated wildly, with only a few valid values from mid-June to
    August. This is consistent with the findings presented in Figure 7. 4.4. Spatial
    Distribution of Downscaled SM To visualize the spatial heterogeneity of the downscaled
    SM, this section presents average distribution maps of SMAP L4-SM, downscaled
    SM, precipitation, LST during the study period, as well as DEM and clay. As can
    be seen from Figure 9, the downscaled SM not only retained the spatial pattern
    of the original SMAP L4-SM, but also provided a higher resolution. The SM pattern
    in Anhui Province presented a clear north–south variation, being lower in the
    north and higher in the south. Such difference is a consequence of combined climatic
    conditions, land cover, and topography [10]. The southern regions are located
    in the humid zone and enjoy abundant precipitation under the influence of monsoon.
    They are predominantly forested, which reduces water evaporation and runoff, thus
    increasing SM retention. Meanwhile, the northern areas experience a semi-humid
    climate characterized by limited precipitation. Coupled with extensive cultivation,
    the soil in this region is loose and has difficulty retaining water [40]. Figure
    9. Mean distribution maps from April to November 2019 for SMAP L4-SM, downscaled
    SM, precipitation, LST, and distribution maps for DEM and clay. Note that water
    bodies are not excluded from the plots. We additionally conducted a detailed examination
    of three regions, labeled A, B, and C, which display unique topographic and climatic
    features. Region A is characterized by low elevation, limited precipitation, and
    high temperature; region C is marked by high elevation, abundant precipitation,
    and low temperature; and region B has a medium elevation between the two, with
    mild temperature and precipitation. The local maps show that downscaled SM was
    sensitive to changes in precipitation and LST, indicating its strong spatial heterogeneity.
    And the distribution of downscaled SM in the three regions demonstrated characteristics
    consistent with topography and climate: region A had generally low SM values,
    suggesting a drier environment; region C tended to have higher SM values, indicating
    ample water resources; and region B had intermediate SM values and did not show
    significant dryness or wetness. It is noteworthy that the downscaled SM showed
    high spatial correlation with DEM and clay, highlighting their dominant roles
    in the downscaling models, while other features modulate the local changes and
    heterogeneity of SM. This finding will be further verified in the subsequent section.
    5. Discussion 5.1. Analysis of Input Predictors We developed a SM downscaling
    framework based on the Stacking strategy using 15 predictors: NDVI, NDWI, NSDSI,
    EVI, VV, VH, LAI, LST, Albedo, sand, silt, clay, DEM, LC, and DOY, which successfully
    generated SM at 1 km resolution on a daily scale. The relative importance of the
    predictors and their effects on the model’s output were also investigated. The
    feature importance provided by the tree models can reveal some of the black-box
    nature of the model and identify the influential features, but they do not indicate
    the exact relationship between the features and target, such as positive or negative
    correlation. SHAP [41] values can measure the magnitude and direction of each
    feature’s influence. They treat each prediction as a collaborative result of all
    features and assign a SHAP value to each feature based on its contribution to
    the prediction. We used SHAP values to analyze how each feature affects the prediction
    result in this study. To approximate the SHAP values of the Stacking model, we
    combined the SHAP values of the XGBoost, LightGBM, and CatBoost models in each
    region on the training set. Feature importance was obtained by taking the mean
    of absolute SHAP values for each feature. Figure 10 displays the SHAP values of
    the features for each region, with the most influential features near the top
    of the y-axis. It is evident that DOY plays the most crucial role in downscaling
    models for all regions. This suggests that it is advisable to introduce time as
    a feature since it can capture the seasonal variation of SM. Moreover, the time
    feature can help the model identify anomalous data caused by noise like cloud
    cover or signal interference and adjust the predicted values promptly. Shangguan
    et al. [42] also found the importance of the DOY in their study. Figure 10. SHAP
    values and feature importance of Stacking models in different regions: (a) HB,
    (b) JH, (c) WX, (d) YJ, and (e) WN. LC_1.0, LC_2.0, LC_3.0, and LC_4.0 are new
    features generated by the one-hot encoding of LC features. (f) Feature importance
    plot obtained by averaging the absolute values of SHAP values; note that the new
    features derived from one-hot encoding of LC have been summed up as LC. Clay is
    the second most influential feature, which along with sand and silt, determines
    the physical properties of the soil, and in turn affects the storage and movement
    of SM [43]. Clay has the finest particles, and soils with more clay content generally
    have lower infiltration and permeability rates but higher water-holding capacity.
    Figure 10d shows a positive correlation between clay and SM, meaning that higher
    clay content leads to higher SM. Conversely, sand has the coarsest particles,
    and soils with more sand content have better permeability and drainage properties
    but lower water-holding capacity. Figure 10c demonstrates that sand is negatively
    correlated with SM, implying that higher sand content results in lower SM. Silt
    has a particle size between clay and sand, which can retain some water making
    the soil moist. DEM is the third significant feature, supported by previous studies
    demonstrating that topography and soil property are crucial factors influencing
    SM dynamics [14,21]. In HB, JH, and YJ regions, DEM was negatively correlated
    with SM, which is consistent with the results of Fu et al. [44]. These regions
    have lower elevations, typically below 100 m, and mainly consist of cropland.
    The negative correlation may be due to the flat topography, which allows moisture
    to accumulate. Unlike other regions, WX and WN have higher elevations and are
    predominantly forested, where a positive trend in the correlation between DEM
    and SM is observed. This could be explained by the role of trees in improving
    soil water retention capacity [45]. Generally, higher elevations have more forest
    cover, while lower elevations are dominated by grasslands or croplands. Forested
    land has more canopy and leaves, which shade solar radiation and reduce heat from
    the soil surface, thereby increasing SM content. On the other hand, temperature
    variations caused by elevation change are also a significant factor; higher elevations
    usually have lower temperatures, which reduces the evaporation rate and favors
    SM retention. We plotted the co-interaction of DEM and LST on SM in the JH and
    WX regions (Figure 11). The results show that DEM was more variable in the WX
    region, and there was a noticeable interaction between LST and DEM. In areas with
    higher DEM, LST tended to be lower and SHAP values were positive, indicating a
    positive effect on SM. On the contrary, the JH region had a small range of DEM
    variation, and the interaction between LST and DEM was less pronounced. These
    findings suggest that the impact of DEM on SM is complex, and it depends not only
    on the variation of DEM itself but also on the interaction effects of DEM with
    other factors. This is exactly the purpose of our downscaling strategy based on
    terrain partitioning, which simplifies the complex influence of terrain and improves
    the stability and consistency of downscaling models. Figure 11. Co-interaction
    of LST and DEM on SM in the JH and WX regions. (a) JH, (b) WX. LST controls the
    surface thermal changes and is the most significant dynamic variable besides DOY.
    Many studies have confirmed its importance [13,46]. As shown in Figure 10, the
    red LST point is on the left side of the y-axis, which means the increase of LST
    will bring negative feedback to the SM. This finding is further supported by Figure
    11, as the SHAP value is less than 0 when the LST exceeds about 25 °C, indicating
    a negative effect on SM at this point. Albedo is also of high importance as it
    represents the proportion of solar radiation reflected by the Earth’s surface.
    Studies have shown a typical exponential relationship between Albedo and SM, and
    the surface Albedo will decrease with the increase of SM [47]. This is due to
    the fact that wet soils are darker than dry soils and darker soils have lower
    albedo values. The negative correlation is more significant in the YJ, WX, and
    WN regions. VV and VH have a certain penetration ability and can directly detect
    the surface SM. Figure 10f shows that VV is more significant than VH, which agrees
    with the findings of Bai [25]. It is noteworthy that the influence of vegetation
    on the backscattering coefficient under the VV mode is less than that of VH. This
    is because under VH polarization, the radar microwave is vertically transmitted
    and horizontally received, which is more susceptible to vegetation, resulting
    in more vegetation information in the backscatter. Whereas VV polarization is
    vertically transmitted and vertically received, and so this mode penetrates the
    vegetation better and contains more soil information in the backscatter. Among
    the four spectral indices (NDVI, EVI, NDWI, and NSDSI), NSDSI has the highest
    importance, followed by NDWI and EVI, and NDVI is the least. NSDSI is an index
    calculated by the reflectance of the swir bands, which is sensitive to the changes
    of SM [48]. NDVI has been proven essential in previous SM downscaling studies,
    but it has little effect in this study. This is not an isolated case; Yang et
    al. [49] also found that NDVI had a low score in their study. The role of vegetation
    was significant in some studies [6,50], but others found that vegetation played
    a limited role at the 1 km scale [51]. This may be caused by the nonlinear and
    threshold effects of vegetation on SM, and the relationship between NDVI and SM
    may be positive, negative, or irrelevant for different vegetation cover. In terms
    of this study, these indices including LAI played a minor role in the downscaling
    models, while clay, DEM, and LST played a major role. 5.2. Uncertainty of This
    Study Despite the encouraging results of our downscaling study, as with most studies,
    there are some unavoidable uncertainties. The first is the quality of the remote
    sensing data sources, including both the predictors and target. During the data
    preparation step, we performed interpolation and filtering operations on the quality-controlled
    feature datasets to obtain more reliable continuous data. In fact, there were
    still missing values and outliers, especially in the LST data. Missing values
    reduced the number of valid samples, while outliers interfered with the judgement
    of the downscaling models to make inaccurate predictions. On the other hand, the
    accuracy of downscaling results is highly dependent on the coarse-resolution SM
    products. Since the model was constructed based on the relationship between the
    aggregated high-resolution predictors and coarse-resolution SM products, the uncertainty
    of the original SM products directly affected the accuracy of the downscaling
    results. As can be seen from Figure 7 and Figure 8, SMAP L4 products tended to
    underestimate at lower SM levels (HB, JH) and overestimate at higher SM levels
    (WX, YJ, and WN). These uncertainties were propagated and amplified during the
    downscaling process, leading to biases in the downscaled SM. Future research should
    aim to enhance the reliability of data sources and minimize the losses associated
    with data quality. The second uncertainty relates to scale. To align the resolution
    of the predictors with SMAP L4, the numerical features were aggregated using the
    average method. However, this process led to a loss of extreme values. For instance,
    the range of DEM changed from 1–1683 m to 4–1212 m. These extreme values reappeared
    when the model was applied, and the unlearned data may affect the accuracy of
    the model’s output. The third uncertainty occurs in the validation phase since
    the measured SM and the remotely sensed SM have different depths and breadths.
    On the one hand, the measured SM is acquired manually by the drying method, which
    always represents the SM condition at a depth of 10 cm, while the remotely sensed
    SM is obtained by inverting the microwave signal. SMAP L4 claims that the depth
    of the surface SM is the top 5 cm of the soil, but the actual penetration depth
    of the microwave signal is not fixed and varies with the soil water content [52].
    This means that the remotely sensed SM may contain SM information from different
    depths, not just from the top 5 cm. On the other hand, the measured SM only reflects
    the SM condition in a small area, while the downscaled SM represents the average
    SM condition within 1 km. In summary, the inconsistency of depth and breadth will
    affect the representativeness of the measured SM collected at a specific depth,
    thus reducing the comparability of the results. 6. Conclusions This study proposed
    a downscaling framework for SMAP soil moisture based on a Stacking strategy that
    considers the geomorphic units. The spatial resolution of the SMAP L4-SM product
    was successfully improved from the original 9 km to 1 km by using multi-source
    datasets including: MODIS, Sentinel-1, topography, and soil property. The main
    findings are summarized as follows. The framework incorporated three ML models,
    XGBoost, LightGBM, and CatBoost. Comparison revealed that the Stacking model achieved
    the highest accuracy in all regions, followed by XGBoost, CatBoost, and LightGBM.
    Validation with measured SM showed that 60% of the sites were highly correlated
    with downscaled SM (R > 0.6), with an average ubRMSE of 0.040 m3/m3, which satisfied
    the accuracy requirements of the SMAP products. Moreover, the downscaling results
    outperformed the available 1 km resolution SM products (SMCI1.0, SMAP D-SM) and
    method without partitioning (downscaled SM (WP)). Both downscaled SM and downscaled
    SM (WP) exhibited temporal consistency with SMAP L4-SM and responded positively
    to rainfall events. They also mitigated the systematic bias of the SMAP L4 product,
    but downscaled SM (WP) performed inconsistently and sometimes even aggravated
    the bias. The spatial pattern analysis indicated that the downscaled SM preserved
    the overall trend of SMAP L4-SM while enriching the details. The downscaled SM
    was higher in the humid regions and lower in the semi-humid regions, which agreed
    with the actual situation. Among the 15 predictors, DOY, clay, and DEM were the
    most important and determined the overall distribution of SM. It is worth noting
    that the relationship between DEM and SM was complex; they exhibited a negative
    correlation in the plains and a positive correlation in the mountains. LST and
    Albedo reflected the dynamics of surface energy and showed a negative correlation
    with SM in all regions. VV polarization was less affected by vegetation and thus
    captured SM changes more effectively than VH. NSDSI was found to be more sensitive
    to SM than the other spectral indices, and together they regulated local variations
    and spatial heterogeneity of SM. In conclusion, this study provides evidence supporting
    the applicability of the Stacking model in SM downscaling studies. Furthermore,
    it validates the effectiveness of the terrain-based partitioning strategy. Future
    studies can further explore the effects of long series data in practical applications,
    such as assessing the response of SM to climate change and human activities and
    analyzing the variability of downscaling results in different seasons. Author

  explanation: The study's aim is to explore ways machine learning can be leveraged
    to improve irrigated agricultural systems. The specific research question the
    authors are concerned with is how to handle heterogeneity, uncertainty, and quality
    issues with real-time insight generation and the application of actionable irrigation
    insights. The authors propose the use of random forest optimization and various
    technologies, methods, and approaches to address the issue.
  extract_1: The proposed system explores how utilizing digital footprints might help
    improve farming practices and increase output. The process of transforming information
    from an analog to a digital representation is referred to as digitalization. Then,
    utilizing electrical equipment and computer networks, this digital format may
    be stored, processed, and sent.
  extract_2: Strategies for handling data heterogeneity, uncertainty, and quality

    Abstract

    Agriculture shows an important role in the enlargement of an economy. The proposed
    system explores how utilizing digital footprints might help improve

    agricultural practices and production. Agricultural data is increasingly available
    in digital form because of the development of modern technology and the

    spread of connected devices. These data can be utilized to produce digital footprints
    that document the whole lifecycle of agricultural production, from

    planting to harvesting. Farmers may then decide when to sow, water, fertilize,
    and harvest their crops by using machine learning algorithms trained on these

    digital footprints to spot patterns and forecast results. The study examines various
    machine learning methods that can be used to examine digital footprints

    and shows the advantages of doing so, including higher yields, better resource
    management, and lower costs. The timing of crop planting, fertilization, and

    harvest has long been determined by the agriculture sector using conventional
    techniques and experience. However, with the expansion of agricultural data

    available, there is now a chance to use machine learning algorithms to recognize
    trends and forecast outcomes based on this data. This study explores the

    potential of machine learning methods, particularly Random Forest optimization,
    to improve agricultural practices and boost output. The study uses Random

    Forest optimization, a potent machine learning method that can examine massive
    datasets, to forecast crop yield based on many variables like weather

    patterns, soil quality, and fertilizer application. The study''s ¦ndings show
    how well the Random Forest optimization technique predicts crop productivity with

    an accuracy of 99.97%. By giving farmers useful information about forecasting
    crop yields, they may increase their overall productivity by using their

    resources wisely. The report also emphasizes the necessity of additional study
    and funding for the creation of machine learning algorithms that are

    speci¦cally customized to the peculiarities of the agricultural sector, as well
    as the signi¦cance of data quality and privacy in the collecting and analysis
    of

    agricultural data. A combination of hardware and software tools, including data
    collection sensors, data processing equipment, graphics processing units

    (GPUs), cloud computing services, and mobile applications, will be needed for
    the hardware implementation of increasing agricultural practices in production

    using machine learning with Random Forest optimization techniques.

    I. INTRODUCTION

    The practice of farming involves cultivating land, keeping animals, and creating
    food, ¦ber, and other goods that support human life. As a source of food and

    raw materials for businesses that produce goods and services, it is a crucial
    sector of the economy. In many developing nations, since it is frequently the
    sole

    source of income for rural communities, agriculture plays a signi¦cant role in
    the economies of those nations. Agriculture has a signi¦cant role in the nation''s

    GDP and export revenues in addition to producing food and raw materials. It advances
    the construction of rural infrastructure, provides cash, and offers

    employment opportunities. The sustainability of the environment and rural development
    are also intimately related to agriculture. To address more general

    economic and social problems like food security, poverty alleviation, and environmental
    sustainability, the agricultural sector is also crucial. Furthermore,

    because higher productivity and e¨ciency can result in higher earnings and investments
    in other industries, agriculture may be a signi¦cant contributor to

    economic growth. In summary, agriculture is an important economic sector that
    has an impact on society and the environment in addition to its economic

    contribution [1]. Agriculture has been practiced for thousands of years, and over
    that period, it has undergone many changes. Scienti¦c techniques and

    cutting-edge technology are used in modern agriculture to boost output and e¨ciency
    while reducing its negative effects on the environment. Agroforestry,

    crop cultivation, and animal husbandry are some of the main agricultural activities.
    Food security, economic growth, and environmental sustainability all

    suffer from the effects of agriculture. Millions of people all around the world,
    particularly in poor nations, depend on it greatly for their daily survival.

    Sustainable agricultural practices are being created to make sure that agricultural
    activities meet the demands of the present without compromising the

    capacity of future generations to meet their own needs [2]. The use of synthetic
    inputs like fertilizers, insecticides, and herbicides to boost crop yields is

    referred to as conventional agricultural practices. These methods are based on
    monoculture farming, which is the practice of growing the same crop over and

    over in a single ¦eld. Large pieces of equipment, irrigation infrastructure, and
    high-input agricultural methods de¦ne conventional agriculture. Even though

    crop yields and food production have increased signi¦cantly thanks to conventional
    agriculture, the environment is still negatively impacted. When synthetic

    inputs are used excessively, they can cause soil erosion, water pollution, and
    biodiversity loss. In addition, monoculture farming''s reliance on crops makes

    them more susceptible to pests and disease, which can cost farmers a lot of money
    [3]. With the help of recent advancements in technology and scienti¦c

    knowledge, modern agricultural practices have undergone tremendous change. Farmers
    can now produce more food with fewer resources and less negative

    environmental impact thanks to these practices. However, the sector faces several
    challenges that can have signi¦cant impacts on its productivity and

    sustainability. Some of the challenges in agriculture include:

    Climate Change: Climate change is a signi¦cant challenge facing agriculture, as
    it can affect crop yields and increase the incidence of pests and

    diseases. Extreme weather events, such as droughts and §oods, can also impact
    agriculture and reduce crop productivity.

    Limited Resources: Agriculture is dependent on several resources, including water,
    land,

    and energy. However, these resources are becoming increasingly scarce due to factors such as population growth and urbanization. This can lead to comp

    Soil Degradation: Soil degradation is a signi¦cant challenge facing agriculture, as it can reduce the productivity
    of farmland and affect crop yields. Soil

    degradation can result from factors such as erosion, overuse of pesticides and
    fertilizers, and deforestation.

    Pest and Disease Management: Pests and diseases can have a signi¦cant impact on
    crop yields, leading to reduced productivity and higher costs for

    farmers. However, managing pests and diseases can be challenging, as it requires a comprehensive understanding of the pests and diseases and the

    appropriate management strategies.

    Access to Markets: Access to markets can be a signi¦cant challenge for farmers, particularly those in developing countries. Farmers may lack access to m

    and transportation systems, which can limit their ability to sell their products
    and receive fair prices.

    Labor Shortages: Labor shortages can be a signi¦cant challenge for farmers, particularly
    in developed countries. Labor shortages can lead to higher labor

    costs and di¨culties in ¦nding workers to perform critical tasks such as planting and
    harvesting.

    Financial Constraints: Farmers often face ¦nancial constraints, including limited
    access to

    credit and high costs for inputs such as seeds, fertilizers, and machinery. These constraints can limit their ability to invest
    in their farms and increase their

    Page 3/20

    productivity.

    Precision agriculture is one of the biggest innovations in contemporary agriculture.
    Data about soil conditions, crop development, and weather patterns are

    collected using cutting-edge technologies like GPS, sensors, and drones. With
    the help of this knowledge, decisions about pest management,

    fertilizer, irrigation, and planting may be made that will maximize yields and
    the e¨cient use of resources [4]. Genetically modi¦ed organisms (GMOs) are

    another signi¦cant development in agriculture. To increase their resistance to
    pests, diseases, and environmental stressors, these crops have undergone

    genetic engineering. As a result, farmers are now able to grow more food with
    fewer inputs like pesticides and herbicides.

    The importance of sustainable agriculture is likewise rising as global concern over climate change and
    environmental degradation rises. Reduced soil erosion,

    water conservation, and soil health are all bene¦ts of sustainable farming techniques
    like cover crops, crop rotation, and conservation tillage.

    By storing carbon in the soil, they also aid in lowering greenhouse gas emissions. The mechanization of farms has
    also aided modern agriculture. Many

    chores can now be automated by farmers, which lowers labor costs. Examples of
    advanced machinery include tractors, planters, and harvesters. Farmers can

    now manage greater land areas, which has increased farming e¨ciency.

    In summary, contemporary agricultural methods are crucial for feeding a growing
    world population while minimizing the negative effects on the environment.

    The "World Population Prospects," makes predictions on population growth. The
    most recent edition of this report, which spans the years 1950 to 2100, was

    released in 2019. According to the report, there were 7.7 billion people on the
    planet in 2019 and 9.7 billion are expected to live there by the year 2050 [5].
    The

    research also points out that although population growth rates have been falling
    since the 1960s, the overall number of people added to the world''s population

    every year has been rising. Farmers may continue to grow their food production
    while using fewer resources by utilizing technology, science, and sustainable

    farming methods, ensuring the industry''s viability. This is implemented using
    arti¦cial intelligence techniques as shown in ¦gure 1.

    Arti¦cial intelligence (AI) is the period used to designate the capacity of machines
    to carry out tasks that would ordinarily require human intelligence to

    complete, such as comprehending natural language, recognizing patterns, making
    judgment calls, and picking up knowledge from experience. The subject of

    arti¦cial intelligence is expanding quickly, revolutionizing several industries
    and perhaps changing how we work and live [6]. Numerous applications, including

    voice assistants, picture and speech recognition, natural language processing,
    and predictive analytics, currently make use of AI technology. It is also

    employed in industries including manufacturing, transportation, banking, and healthcare,
    where it helps to increase productivity, lower costs, and increase

    safety. However, the quick development of AI also prompts signi¦cant moral and
    societal issues. Concerns have been raised regarding how AI will affect

    employment, privacy, and security, as well as the possibility that these technologies
    would help to reinforce prejudice and discrimination. It will be crucial to

    address these concerns as AI technology develops and to make sure that it is created
    and applied in a way that bene¦ts society as a whole. Arti¦cial

    intelligence (AI) is taking on a bigger and bigger role in agriculture by assisting
    farmers and other stakeholders in making better decisions and maximizing

    their operations [7]. Crop observing, yield estimating, soil investigation, and
    pest controller are just a few of the applications of AI.

    Agronomists may spot possible issues early and take action before they worsen
    by using crop monitoring, where AI analyses images captured by drones or

    sensors to ¦nd changes in plant health or growth patterns. Based on data inputs
    like weather patterns, soil conditions, and previous yield data, AI- powered

    yield prediction can assist farmers in estimating crop yields. Additionally, AI
    can identify and forecast the spread of pest outbreaks to assist in pest

    management, analyze soil samples to evaluate nutrient content and provide fertilization
    suggestions.

    In general, using AI in agriculture helps farmers increase their yields, cut costs,
    and encourage sustainable farming methods. It can transform how we cultivate

    food and tackle some of the biggest issues confronting agriculture, such as food
    security and climate change. They are done using machine learning with

    optimization algorithms. It is de¦ned as the branch of arti¦cial intelligence
    called "machine learning" which uses algorithms and statistical models to let

    computers learn from data without having to be explicitly programmed. It is predicated
    on the premise that computers can discover patterns and reach

    conclusions by examining massive amounts of data [8]. With the introduction of
    technology, especially the use of machine learning techniques, agriculture

    has recently seen a substantial revolution. Since it can automate complicated
    activities and make predictions based on data, machine learning has grown in

    popularity. Some of the causes for utilizing machine learning are as follows:

    Automation: By automating time-consuming and repetitive processes, machine learning
    frees up human resources to work on tasks that are more

    complicated and creative.

    Forecasting and prediction: Machine learning models can be trained on historical
    data to create forecasts and predictions about future outcomes,

    including consumer behavior, sales trends, and market prices.

    Personalization: Machine learning can be used to customize user experiences, such
    as news feeds or product recommendations on e-commerce websites.

    Fraud detection: By learning from trends in historical data, machine learning
    can be used to identify fraudulent transactions or activities.

    Natural language processing: Chatbots, voice assistants, and other language-based
    applications can be made possible through machine learning when it

    comes to analyzing and comprehending natural language.

    Image and speech recognition: By using machine learning to identify patterns in
    images and audio, applications like facial and object identi¦cation and

    voice-based user interfaces are made possible.

    This study examines how digital footprints can improve farming practices and increase
    output. The process of transforming information from an analog to a

    digital representation is referred to as digitalization. Then, utilizing electrical
    equipment and computer networks, this digital format may be stored, processed,

    and sent. From the way we interact and consume information to the way we work
    and access healthcare, digitalization has drastically changed many facets

    of our lives [9]. The term "digital footprint" describes the online tracks that
    a person or business leaves behind on the internet. The importance of having a

    digital footprint in agriculture is rising as machine learning-enhanced production
    practices improve farming practices.

    Page 4/20

    Here are a few explanations:

    Data Gathering: Digital footprints can be used to gather information on agricultural
    practices, including the usage of pesticides, irrigation systems, and

    fertilizers. By using this information, it is possible to develop digital pro¦les
    of farms and produce insights that can be used to maximize agricultural

    output. Then, by analyzing this data, machine learning algorithms may provide
    farmers with insights and suggestions for enhancing productivity.

    Predictive Analytics: Machine learning algorithms can create predictions about
    crop yields, insect outbreaks, and weather trends using data from digital

    footprints. This can assist farmers in choosing planting, irrigation, and pest
    management strategies with more knowledge, which can increase yield. With

    precision agriculture, it is possible to construct computerized maps of farms
    that show regions with a particular need, such as nutrient shortages or pest

    infestations. Then, using machine learning algorithms, production can be improved
    by reducing waste and using targeted applications of pesticides or

    fertilizer, for example.

    Crop Monitoring: Sensors, drones, or satellites can employ digital footprints
    to monitor crops in real time. The data can then be analyzed using machine

    learning algorithms to give farmers information on the health and growth trends
    of their crops. This can assist farmers in identifying and addressing

    problems like nutrient de¦cits or pest outbreaks early on, which can boost crop
    yields and lower losses.

    The capacity to store and analyze enormous volumes of data rapidly and effectively
    is one of the main advantages of digitization. As a result, cutting-edge

    ¦elds like machine learning and arti¦cial intelligence have emerged, which generate
    predictions and judgments using vast volumes of data. It is now simpler

    for people to work together across distances and time zones thanks to new kinds
    of communication and collaboration made possible by digitalization. Online

    collaboration tools and remote work have grown in popularity over the past several
    years as a result of this. Agriculture and food production are being

    revolutionized by digitalization [10]. It has the potential to boost productivity,
    cut expenses, and boost yields, ultimately resulting in more lucrative and

    sustainable agriculture.

    In the case of cash crops, digitalization has allowed farmers to more effectively
    track and manage their harvests from planting to harvest. Farmers can

    monitor soil moisture, nitrogen levels, and other crucial factors thanks to technologies
    like precision farming and remote sensing, which improve crop yields

    and cut expenses. Digitalization is assisting in addressing problems with food
    crops such as food waste and ine¨cient supply chains [11]. For instance, food

    goods can be tracked using blockchain technology from farm to table, lowering
    the danger of contamination and enabling more effective recalls.

    Agriculture and food production are being transformed overall by digitalization,
    becoming more effective, sustainable, and pro¦table for both farmers and

    customers. We examine the application of machine learning algorithms in agriculture
    and how they might increase crop output and support farmers'' decision-

    making. We also look at the opportunities and problems associated with integrating
    digital footprints into agriculture and how that might result in sustainable

    practices. The digital footprints that people leave behind when interacting with
    technology are referred to as digital footprints. Digital footprints in agriculture

    can be used to gather information on farming methods, crop output, weather trends,
    and soil health. Machine learning algorithms can be created using this

    data to enhance agricultural practices. For instance, information on weather patterns
    can be utilized to forecast crop output and determine the ideal time for

    sowing. To utilize fertilizer and pesticides most effectively, data on soil health
    can be employed. Machine learning algorithms come in a variety of forms, such

    as reinforcement learning, unsupervised learning, and supervised learning [12].
    Unsupervised learning includes spotting patterns in unlabeled data, whereas

    supervised learning uses labeled data to train a machine learning model. Due to
    its capacity to collect and analyze vast amounts of data to produce insights

    that might assist farmers in making more informed decisions, machine learning
    is becoming more and more widely used in agricultural practices. The usage

    of resources can be optimized, waste can be decreased, and crop yields can now
    be increased thanks to machine learning. Precision farming is one of the

    most often used uses of machine learning in agriculture. Applying the appropriate
    inputs, such as fertilizer, herbicides, and water, at the appropriate time and

    in the appropriate amount includes precision agriculture, which involves analyzing
    data to identify variability within a ¦eld. To assist farmers in making more

    accurate judgments about how to manage their crops, machine learning algorithms
    can analyze data from sensors, satellite photos, and weather forecasts.

    Predicting crop yields is another way that machine learning is used in agriculture.
    Machine learning algorithms can create predictive models that assist

    farmers in estimating their yields for the current season by analyzing historical
    data on crop yields and weather trends. Making decisions about when to

    harvest, when to sell, and how much to grow can be done using this information.

    Plant disease management and identi¦cation can both be done using machine learning.
    Machine learning algorithms can detect illnesses and pests early on

    by examining photographs of plants, allowing farmers to take preventative measures
    before serious damage is done. By doing this, you can increase crop

    quality while using less pesticides. Machine learning can be used to enhance not
    only crop management but also animal management [13]. Machine learning

    algorithms can aid farmers in identifying potential health issues and optimizing
    feeding and breeding schedules by analyzing data on animal behavior, such

    as feeding patterns and mobility. Despite the potential advantages of integrating
    digital footprints in agriculture, there are still several issues that need to
    be

    resolved. Data privacy and security are one of the di¨culties. Farmers'' concerns
    about privacy and security may make them hesitant to share their data. The

    absence of technology and data connectivity in rural places is another problem.
    The technology required to gather and analyze data may not be available to

    farmers in remote locations.

    This is implemented through Information and Communication Technology (ICT). By
    boosting output, boosting e¨ciency, and lowering environmental impact,

    ICT has also signi¦cantly contributed to the transformation of agriculture. Using
    ICT in agriculture entails putting different digital technologies to use to help

    agricultural practices such as precision agriculture, smart farming, and farm
    management systems. With the help of ICT tools like GPS, sensors, and drones,

    farmers can monitor and analyze data on their crops and soil to make educated
    decisions about planting, fertilizing, and irrigation. Precision agriculture is
    a

    growing ¦eld. In doing so, crop yields are improved while the consumption of resources
    like water and fertilizer is reduced. Automating various farming tasks,

    such as planting, harvesting, and livestock monitoring, through the use of ICT
    tools like Internet of Things (IoT) sensors and machine learning algorithms is

    known as smart farming. This might lower labor costs, boost productivity, and
    enhance farming techniques'' precision.

    Page 5/20

    To handle several areas of farming, including inventory management, ¦nancial management,
    and supply chain management, farm management systems use

    ICT tools like cloud-based software applications. This can facilitate operational
    simpli¦cation and enhance decision-making for farmers. In general, the

    application of ICT in agriculture has the potential to revolutionize the sector
    by enabling more productive, e¨cient, and sustainable farming methods. The

    major contributions of the proposed work include the following:

    Improved Agricultural Practices: By introducing the use of machine learning algorithms
    in analyzing data gathered from various sources, such as weather

    data, soil samples, and crop yields, the study may contribute to improving ag
    practices. Improved crop yields may arise from farmers making better

    decisions about when to sow, irrigate, fertilize, and harvest their crops as a
    result.

    Increased Crop productivity: By ¦nding ideal circumstances for crop development,
    recognizing and forecasting probable crop illnesses, and suggesting

    the optimum fertilizers or pesticides employ, the implementation of machine learning
    techniques in agriculture may boost agricultural productivity.

    Environmental Sustainability: By using fewer pesticides and fertilizers, improving
    irrigation techniques, and lowering crop waste, the paper may also help

    to advance environmental sustainability.

    Information Transfer: By presenting a framework for how machine learning might
    be used in the agriculture industry, the study may help spread

    information and best practices. This might facilitate the understanding of the
    potential advantages of this technology by other researchers, practitioners,

    and policymakers and promote its implementation.

    In conclusion, the use of machine learning in agricultural practices is growing.
    Farmers can make better decisions, enhance yields, and save waste thanks to

    its capacity to handle massive amounts of data and produce predictive models.
    Machine learning will likely play a bigger part in the future of agriculture as
    a

    result of the ongoing improvement of technology.

    II. SYSTEMATIC REVIEW

    The proposed system paved way for smart farming. Using cutting-edge technology
    and data analytic methods, smart farming, sometimes referred to as

    precision agriculture, aims to enhance farming practices, boost agricultural production,
    and lessen waste and environmental effects. Optimizing farming

    operations like irrigation, fertilization, pest control, and crop management,
    entails the integration of numerous technologies like sensors, drones, GPS, and

    arti¦cial intelligence (AI). To meet the increasing demand for food in a world
    that is changing quickly, smart farming aims to make agriculture more effective,

    sustainable, and lucrative. Machine learning is one of these technologies; it
    uses algorithms to ¦nd patterns and insights in huge datasets. Machine learning

    in agriculture offers the potential to increase agricultural productivity and
    support farmers'' decision-making. This research examines how digital footprints
    can

    be used to improve agricultural practices and increase output. Smart agriculture
    practices use a variety of technology to streamline farming processes,

    increase yields, and cut waste. Among the most important technologies used in
    smart agriculture are:

    Precision farming: To maximize crop productivity and reduce resource wastage,
    such as water, fertilizer, and pesticides, precision farming is a

    sophisticated agricultural management method. Making educated judgments regarding
    planting, harvesting, and resource allocation entails gathering

    and analyzing data about the state of the soil, weather patterns, crop growth
    patterns, and other pertinent elements. The GPS is one of the most important

    technologies used in precision farming. (GPS). With the aid of GPS technology,
    farmers can follow their machinery in real-time

    and keep an eye on the location and crop productivity. Making informed judgments
    about where to sow crops and how much fertilizer and water to use can be

    done using this data. Additionally, GPS can be used to build ¦eld maps, which
    can be utilized to spot problem regions such as those with poor soil quality or

    low crop yield. Another increasingly popular precision farming method is Variable
    Rate Technology (VRT). Farmers are now able to apply the exact amount of

    pesticides, water, and fertilizer required for each ¦eld area thanks to VRT technology.
    By doing so, crop yields increase, waste is reduced, and money is saved

    [14]. As an illustration, if a farmer uses VRT to apply fertilizer, the system
    can modify the amount applied following the crop''s needs and the soil''s

    circumstances. The quality and production of the crops can be enhanced by making
    sure that the proper amount of fertilizer is applied to each section of the

    ¦eld. Remote sensing is a crucial tool for precision farming. The health of plants
    and the amount of moisture in the soil can be precisely determined using

    remote sensing technology like satellite photography and drones. Utilizing this
    information will allow you to keep an eye on crop development and spot ¦eld

    issues. The farmer can inspect the region and establish whether there is a pest
    infestation or a nutrient shortage, for instance, if a drone spots a patch of

    fading plants. Precision farming also includes the use of precision irrigation
    systems. These systems optimize water use by using sensors and software to

    make sure crops get the proper amount of water at the right time. Water waste
    is decreased, and crop quality is raised. For instance, a precision irrigation

    system can automatically change the amount of water sprayed to a ¦eld''s dry patches
    if it notices that the area is dry. In conclusion, precision farming

    techniques are revolutionizing the agricultural sector by utilizing cutting-edge
    technology and data analytics to maximize crop output, improve crop quality, cut

    down on resource waste, and boost e¨ciency and pro¦tability for farmers. Farmers
    may decide wisely about planting, harvesting, and resource allocation by

    gathering and analyzing data on soil quality, weather patterns, and crop growth
    patterns. This can result in better outcomes for farmers as well as the

    environment.

    Internet of Things (IoT): The Internet of Things (IoT) is playing a progressively
    signi¦cant part in agriculture, allowing farmers to enhance their resources

    and improve their yields while reducing costs and increasing e¨ciency. Here are
    some of how IoT is revolutionizing agriculture:

    1. IoT sensors can be utilized in agriculture to gather information on soil moisture,
    temperature, and nutrient levels as well as weather, plant development, and

    pest infestations. This information can be used to identify ¦elds that need attention,
    improve irrigation and fertilization schedules, and track crop health and

    growth rates.

    2. Livestock management: IoT sensors can be used to track a livestock''s movement,
    observe its eating and drinking routines, and spot any irregularities that

    would point to an ailment or injury. By using this information, feeding, and care
    schedules can be improved, disease outbreaks can be stopped, and overall

    Page 6/20

    animal health and production can be increased.

    3. Supply chain management: From the farm to the consumer, IoT sensors may be
    utilized to track the movement of crops and livestock. Farmers and

    distributors can bene¦t from this by maximizing logistics, cutting waste, and
    ensuring that goods are delivered to markets on schedule and in good shape.

    4. Monitoring environmental conditions: IoT sensors can be used to keep an eye
    on things like air and water quality, weather patterns, and climate change.

    This can assist farmers in selecting crops, timing plantings, and other agricultural
    practices that are in§uenced by environmental conditions.

    5. IoT technology can be utilized to create autonomous farming systems, where
    robots and drones can take care of chores like planting, watering, and

    harvesting crops. By doing so, the danger of human mistakes can be decreased while
    labor expenses can be decreased and productivity increased.

    Big Data Analytics: Big data analytics in agriculture have the potential to change
    how farmers and agricultural enterprises conduct their operations.

    Farmers may make more educated decisions that can result in higher yields, more
    e¨ciency, and lower costs by gathering, analyzing, and interpreting

    vast amounts of data. Predictive insights are one of the main advantages of big
    data analytics in agriculture. Farmers can estimate future yields with

    greater accuracy by looking back at historical data on weather patterns, soil
    characteristics, and crop performance. This can assist them in maximizing

    planting schedules, selecting the crops that are most suited for a speci¦c site,
    and modifying their agricultural techniques to increase productivity.

    Precision agriculture is another ¦eld where big data analytics can have a signi¦cant
    effect. Farmers can obtain comprehensive information about soil

    moisture, nitrogen levels, and other environmental aspects that in§uence crop
    growth by employing sensors and other data-collection equipment. Making

    decisions concerning irrigation, fertilizer application, and other farming-related
    issues will thus be easier with the aid of this knowledge [15]. Farmers may

    use big data analytics to spot possible issues like pest infestations or crop
    diseases early on. Farmers can spot warning signs early on and take action

    before the issue gets worse by analyzing data from sensors and other sources.
    Big data analytics in agriculture has the potential to greatly boost

    productivity, lower costs, and raise yields. However, it necessitates a large
    investment in technology, data analytic skills, and a readiness to adopt novel

    farming practices.

    Robotics: Precision farming, harvesting, monitoring, and maintenance are just
    a few of the agricultural applications where robots are becoming more and

    more crucial. Increased productivity is one of the key advantages of deploying
    robots in agriculture because they can operate around the clock and

    reliably perform repetitive jobs. Robots can also lower labor costs, boost productivity,
    and enhance sustainability. Robots are having a big impact on

    several industries, including precision farming. Robots can make accurate choices
    on planting, watering, fertilizing, and harvesting by gathering and

    analyzing data on crops, soil, weather, and other aspects. Thus, waste is decreased,
    environmental sustainability is increased, and crop yields are

    improved. Robots used for soil analysis, sensor-equipped drones, and self-driving
    tractors are a few examples of precision farming robots. Harvesting is

    another industry where robots are having a big impact. Robots are being developed
    to pick fruits and vegetables, which can be a labor-intensive operation,

    more effectively and precisely. Additionally, according to quality and other criteria,
    automated systems may sort and grade collected products. Due to their

    ability to operate continuously, harvesting robots can speed up the process of
    getting crops to market. The usage of robots in agriculture also extends to

    monitoring and maintenance. Robots can be employed to keep an eye on crop development
    and spot any issues like pests or illness. With the use of

    sensors and other cutting- edge technology, this can be done, allowing farmers
    to act immediately to avoid crop loss. To eliminate the need for manual

    labor, robots can also complete activities like irrigation, weeding, and trimming.
    In agriculture, autonomous vehicles are also becoming more prevalent

    [16]. It is possible to carry crops and supplies as well as plant and harvest
    crops using self-driving tractors and other autonomous vehicles. This lowers

    the demand for human labor and boosts productivity. Overall, the use of robots
    has the potential to revolutionize agriculture by increasing its productivity,

    sustainability, and e¨ciency. Robots can assist farmers in meeting the rising
    need for food while minimizing the impact of farming on the environment by

    lowering labor costs, boosting production, and improving sustainability. We may
    anticipate seeing even more cutting-edge agricultural robots produced as

    technology develops.

    Cloud Computing: Agriculture is seeing an increase in the importance of cloud
    computing, which bene¦ts farmers, academics, and other sector

    participants in a variety of ways. Cloud computing is assisting in enhancing e¨ciency,
    production, and sustainability in agriculture through data

    management and predictive analytics. Improved data management is one of the main
    advantages of cloud computing for agriculture. It can be di¨cult to

    store and analyse the vast volumes of data

    that farmers produce on their crops, soil, weather, and other variables [17].
    By providing a safe and expandable platform for data processing and storing, cloud

    computing offers a remedy. Farmers who use cloud-based solutions can access and
    analyse their data on any device, at any time, from anywhere. This

    enables them to decide on planting, fertilizing, and harvesting more wisely, which
    increase agricultural yields and decrease can waste. Additionally, the use of

    cloud computing improves communication between scientists and agronomists. Researchers
    can collaborate globally with co-workers and collaborators by

    putting study data on the cloud and making it accessible to them. This might hasten
    agricultural research and development and result in fresh ideas for

    managing crops, controlling pests, and other things. Predictive analytics is a
    bene¦t of cloud computing for agriculture as well. Farmers can utilize cloud-

    based technologies to forecast agricultural yields by examining data on crop growth,
    weather patterns, and other variables. They can then modify their

    planting and harvesting schedules as necessary. The risk of crop loss due to weather
    or other reasons can be reduced and resources may be used more

    effectively as a result. In terms of sustainability, cloud computing also has
    advantages. Farmers can use cloud-based solutions to manage data and cut down

    on the amount of paper and other physical resources required for data storage
    and analysis [18]. Farmers may also cut waste and make better use of

    resources by employing predictive analytics to optimize agricultural yields. Overall,
    cloud computing is playing a signi¦cant role in agriculture, providing

    advantages in terms of sustainability, cooperation, data management, and predictive
    analytics. We may anticipate seeing even more cutting-edge cloud-based

    technologies created for use in agriculture as technology develops, assisting
    farmers to increase output, decrease waste, and satisfy the rising need for food.

    Blockchain technology: To increase transparency, e¨ciency, and sustainability
    throughout the supply chain, blockchain technology is rapidly being

    applied in agriculture. Blockchain technology can revolutionize business and provide
    farmers, consumers, and other stakeholders with a wide range of

    advantages, from tracking food safety to expediting transactions. Improved traceability
    is one of the blockchain''s main advantages in agriculture.

    Farmers may follow their products from farm to table using blockchain-based technologies,
    giving consumers more details about the food''s origins and

    production processes [19]. Permitting quicker and more precise recalls in the
    event of contamination or another problem can assist boost consumer and

    Page 7/20

    farmer trust while also enhancing food safety. E¨ciency gains are another advantage
    of blockchain in agriculture. Farmers may cut down on the need for

    middlemen and streamline the buying and selling of products by adopting blockchain-based
    technologies to coordinate transactions. Better outcomes for

    both farmers and customers may result from this as it can lower costs and improve
    supply chain transparency. Blockchain can also aid increase

    agricultural sustainability. Blockchain-based platforms can encourage more sustainable
    practices and decrease waste by enabling farmers to track the

    environmental impact of their products. Blockchain can also encourage more sustainable
    production methods and lessen agriculture''s impact on the

    environment by giving consumers more information about the sustainability of the
    items they purchase. Smart contracts are one application of

    blockchain in agriculture. The details of the agreement between the buyer and
    seller are directly encoded into lines of code in smart contracts, which are

    self-executing contracts. This reduces the need for middlemen and can lower the
    possibility of fraud or disagreements. Smart contracts can be used to

    automate transactions between farmers and purchasers in the agricultural industry,
    guaranteeing that both sides receive fair compensation and lowering

    the possibility of payment delays or disagreements. By enhancing transparency,
    e¨ciency, and sustainability throughout the supply chain, blockchain

    technology has the potential to fundamentally change the agricultural industry
    [20]. We may anticipate more e¨cient and sustainable agricultural

    practices, which will bene¦t farmers, consumers, and the environment as more producers,
    retailers, and farmers implement blockchain-based systems.

    III. OVERVIEW OF MACHINE LEARNING

    Machine learning (ML) is increasingly being used to improve agricultural practices,
    by enabling farmers and agriculture professionals to optimize operations,

    increase productivity, and reduce waste. The use of ML in agriculture can include
    tasks such as crop yield prediction, pest and disease detection, precision

    agriculture, and livestock management. By leveraging advanced algorithms and data
    analytics, ML is helping to revolutionize the agricultural sector, improving

    the e¨ciency and sustainability of food production. This is implemented using
    an optimization algorithm. Random Forest is a machine learning algorithm

    that can be used to enhance productivity in agriculture by analyzing large amounts
    of data and providing valuable insights into crop production. The

    algorithm works by creating multiple decision trees, each of which independently
    analyzes a subset of the data [21]. The results of these trees are then

    combined to make a more accurate prediction. Certainly, the following ¦ve categories
    are employed in agriculture to boost production using machine learning

    as shown below in Fig. 2:

    A brief overview of machine learning:

    The development of models to mimic human learning and decision-making can be credited
    with giving rise to machine learning in the 1940s and 1950s. The

    creation of the perceptron algorithm by Frank Rosenblatt in 1957 is one of the
    early instances of machine learning. A particular kind of arti¦cial neural network

    known as a perceptron was capable of learning to divide inputs into two categories
    using a set of weights and biases. The development of decision trees and

    rule-based systems in the 1960s and 1970s contributed to the advancement of machine
    learning research [22]. These techniques were used to create expert

    systems that can decide based on a set of guidelines and information. Machine
    learning began concentrating on statistical techniques and algorithms in the

    1980s and 1990s, like logistic regression and linear regression. Classi¦cation,
    regression, and clustering challenges all used these techniques. Machine

    learning regained prominence in the 2000s with the rise of big data and improvements
    in computing power [23]. Numerous new methods, including deep

    learning and reinforcement learning, have been created and used in a variety of
    ¦elds, such as autonomous cars, natural language processing, and picture

    identi¦cation. Machine learning is still a discipline that is quickly developing
    today, with new methods and programs being created and used in sectors

    including healthcare, ¦nance, and cyber security.

    Following are the steps that machine learning uses to operate:

    1. Data Gathering: Gathering pertinent data from diverse sources is the initial
    stage in machine learning. Depending on the issue at hand and the desired

    solution, this data may be presented in either structured or unstructured form.

    2. Data processing: After the data has been gathered, it must be prepared for
    analysis. To prepare the data for use by machine learning algorithms, the data

    must be cleaned, missing values must be removed, and any outliers must be removed.

    3. Feature extraction: The process of selecting and engineering relevant features
    from the data aims to provide new features that may be more advantageous

    for machine learning algorithms.

    4. Model Selection: After the data is ready, the type of problem being tackled
    is taken into consideration and a suitable machine learning technique is selected.

    supervised learning, unsupervised learning, and reinforcement learning are some
    examples of this.

    5. Training the Model: Using the prepared data, the selected machine learning
    method is then practiced. To reduce the error between the projected output and

    the actual output, the algorithm makes adjustments to its parameters as it learns
    from the data during training.

    6. Model Evaluation: After the model has been trained, its generalizability to
    fresh, unexplored data is assessed using a variety of performance criteria.

    7. Model tuning: Depending on the results of the evaluation, the performance of
    the model may need to be improved by modifying its hyper parameters or by

    employing a new algorithm.

    8. Model deployment: The model can be deployed in a production environment to
    make predictions on new data after it has been trained and tweaked.

    9. Monitoring and Maintenance: To ensure that machine learning models continue
    to perform well over time, it is necessary to monitor and maintain them.

    This entails keeping an eye out for data changes, frequently retraining the model,
    and making adjustments as necessary.

    Machine learning is an iterative process, thus when the model is created and applied,
    some steps might need to be repeated or improved. Depending on the

    type of problem being handled, numerous metrics can be used to assess how well
    machine learning models perform. The main objective of assessing a

    machine learning model''s performance is to ¦nd out how effectively it generalizes
    to new, untried data. Random Forest is a machine learning algorithm that

    can be used in agriculture to predict crop yield. It works by creating an ensemble
    of decision trees, where each tree is trained on a random subset of the data

    and a random subset of the features [24]. In the context of agriculture crop yielding,
    the algorithm can be used to predict the yield of a particular crop based on

    Page 8/20

    a variety of input variables such as weather patterns, soil quality, seed varieties,
    and management practices. To use the algorithm for crop yield prediction,

    historical data on crop yields and the corresponding input variables are used
    to train the model. Once the model is trained, it can be used to predict the yield
    of

    a new crop based on the input variables provided. The random forest algorithm
    is particularly useful for agriculture because it can handle a large number of

    input variables and can also capture complex interactions between the variables
    that may be di¨cult to identify using traditional statistical methods [25].

    Additionally, the algorithm is robust to noisy data and missing values, making
    it suitable for real-world agricultural data. Overall, the random forest algorithm

    can be a powerful

    tool for predicting crop yields in agriculture and can help farmers make informed
    decisions about crop management and resource allocation. Here are a few

    typical metrics for assessing machine learning models:

    Accuracy: This gauges the percentage of instances that were correctly classi¦ed
    out of all the instances. For classi¦cation issues, it is frequently

    employed.

    Precision is the percentage of all accurately identi¦ed positive instances (also
    known as true positives) among all positive predictions. It is bene¦cial in

    situations when the expense of false positives is large, like in medical diagnostics.

    Recall: In case you forgot, this quanti¦es the percentage of real positives among
    all positive results. It helps identify fraudulent transactions when the cost

    of false negatives is signi¦cant.

    F1 Score: When false positives and false negatives are equally essential, this
    score—which is the harmonic mean of precision and recall—is helpful.

    Mean Squared Error (MSE): For regression issues, this statistic is frequently
    utilized. The average squared difference between the expected and actual

    values is what is measured.

    Since it is expressed in the same units as the target variable, the Root Mean
    Squared Error (RMSE), which is the square root of the MSE, is a more

    understandable statistic.

    R-squared (R2): This indicator shows how much of the target variable''s variance
    the model can account for. A better ¦t is indicated by higher values,

    which range from 0 to 1.

    Depending on the problem being solved, it is crucial to utilize the right evaluation
    criteria when assessing a machine learning model''s performance. To make

    sure the model can generalize to new data, it''s also critical to assess the model''s
    performance on a different test set. The trade-off between model complexity

    and performance is also crucial to take into account because more complex models
    may over¦t training data while underperforming on fresh data [26].

    In general, machine learning models can be divided into three groups based on
    the kind of learning that they employ:

    Supervised Learning: In supervised learning, the target variable is known and
    the computer is trained on a labelled dataset. To make precise predictions

    on fresh, unforeseen data, the model must learn the link between the input features
    and the target variable.

    Unsupervised Learning: In unsupervised learning, the goal variable is unknown
    and the machine is trained on an unlabelled dataset. The model''s objective

    is to identify structures, correlations, and patterns in the data without receiving
    any direct instruction or feedback.

    Reinforcement Learning: In reinforcement learning, a machine learns by doing things
    incorrectly, interacting with its environment, and receiving feedback

    in the form of rewards or punishments. The ideal policy, which maximizes the cumulative
    reward over time, is what the model seeks to learn. In robots,

    video games, and control systems, this kind of learning is frequently employed.

    The following categories are used to enhance productivity in agricultural sectors
    evolving machine learning techniques:

    Crop prediction: Choosing which crops to grow, when to plant them, and how to
    maximize their production all depend on crop prediction, which is a crucial

    component of agriculture. To ¦nd trends and create precise predictions, machine
    learning (ML) approaches have shown considerable promise in the ¦eld of

    crop forecasting. The gathering and pre-processing of data is the ¦rst stage in
    crop prediction using ML. This entails compiling information on many

    elements, such as weather patterns, soil quality, and the type of crop planted,
    that may have an impact on crop development [27]. The data is then pre-

    processed to clean out any errors or noise and to make sure that it is in a format
    that ML algorithms can use. The pre-processed data is then subjected to ML

    algorithms to ¦nd patterns and generate predictions. Several ML methods, such
    as decision trees, random forests, support vector machines (SVM), and

    arti¦cial neural networks, can be applied to crop prediction. (ANN). Each algorithm
    has its advantages and disadvantages, and the best one to use depends on

    the particulars of the problem at hand. The ML algorithm can be used to generate
    predictions on new data after being trained on existing data. For instance, a

    farmer can input information on the weather, soil quality, and other parameters
    to predict the yield of a speci¦c crop in a given season, and the ML algorithm

    will then do so [28]. The ability to maximize crop yield and minimize waste is
    one of the main advantages of utilizing ML for crop prediction. ML algorithms

    can detect the ideal circumstances for crop growth and suggest adjustments to
    planting plans, irrigation schedules, and other practices to maximize yield by

    analysing data on the elements that affect crop growth. The ability to lower the
    risk of crop failure for farmers is another advantage of utilizing ML for crop

    prediction. Farmers can take proactive steps to minimize or lessen the impact
    of crop failure by utilizing pest-resistant crops or modifying planting dates
    by

    forecasting the possibility of crop failure based on factors such as weather conditions,
    soil quality, and disease outbreaks. In conclusion, crop prediction using

    machine learning has the potential to completely transform the agricultural industry
    by empowering farmers to make data-driven decisions that maximize

    crop output and minimize risk [29]. To accurately anticipate crop production and
    assist farmers in choosing planting techniques, irrigation schedules, and

    other practices that in§uence crop growth, machine learning (ML) systems analyse
    vast volumes of data and look for trends. It is expected that ML technology

    will become more and more signi¦cant as it develops in agriculture and other sectors
    of the economy.

    Plant disease detection: Farmers and the agriculture sector are very concerned
    about plant diseases. They can lower crop quality and result in considerable

    yield losses, which might result in ¦nancial losses. To reduce these losses, early
    plant disease detection and prevention are essential. To forecast plant

    Page 9/20

    diseases and provide prompt intervention to stop their spread, machine learning
    approaches can be helpful. Data collection is the ¦rst step in the machine

    learning process used to predict plant diseases. This entails gathering information
    on the plant species, its growth stage, the type of disease, and climatic

    factors including temperature, humidity, and rainfall. Sensors, drones, satellite
    photography, and human observation can all be used to gather data [30]. Once

    the data is collected, it is pre-processed to remove noise, handle missing values,
    and normalize the data. Feature engineering is then performed to extract

    relevant features from the data that can be used to train the machine learning
    model. The extracted features may include plant morphology, texture, color, and

    shape, as well as environmental factors such as temperature and humidity. Various
    machine learning algorithms can be used for plant disease prediction,

    including decision trees, random forests, support vector machines, and deep learning
    models such as convolutional neural networks. The choice of algorithm

    depends on the size and complexity of the dataset and the accuracy required for
    prediction. The trained model is then tested on a separate dataset to evaluate

    its accuracy and performance. This is done by splitting the data into training
    and testing sets, with the majority of the data used for training the model and
    a

    smaller subset used for testing. A map displaying the location and severity of
    the disease or an alert system notifying farmers when the sickness is found are

    just two examples of how the model''s results can be displayed to the user. Using
    this knowledge, preventive steps can then be taken, such as applying

    fungicides or removing affected plants [31]. Machine learning- based plant disease
    prediction has several advantages over conventional disease detection

    techniques. By enabling early illness identi¦cation, it can lessen the need for
    expensive and time-consuming manual checks. Additionally, it can assist farmers

    in deciding when and where to apply fungicides and other

    treatments, minimizing the amount of chemicals needed and the negative effects
    on the environment. In conclusion, predicting plant diseases using machine

    learning is a potential strategy that can help to lower crop losses and improve
    agricultural practices. The right machine learning algorithms must be chosen,

    together with careful data gathering, pre-processing, and feature engineering.
    Machine learning can deliver precise and timely predictions of plant illnesses

    with the correct methods and equipment, allowing farmers to take preventative
    measures to save their crops [32]. In conclusion, predicting plant diseases

    using machine learning is a potential strategy that can help to lower crop losses
    and improve agricultural practices. The right machine learning algorithms

    must be chosen, together with careful data gathering, pre- processing, and feature
    engineering. Utilizing the appropriate methods and resources, machine

    learning.

    Weed detection: Weed detection using machine learning is a rapidly developing
    ¦eld that has the potential to revolutionize the way we manage agriculture. In

    traditional agriculture, weed management is time- consuming and labour-intensive,
    often requiring the use of herbicides, which can have negative

    environmental impacts. Machine learning-based weed detection offers an alternative
    solution, using computer vision and machine learning algorithms to

    identify and map weeds in real time. One of the key advantages of machine learning-based
    weed detection is its ability to process large amounts of data

    quickly and accurately. This is achieved by training machine learning algorithms
    on large datasets of images of crops and weeds [33]. These datasets are

    typically labelled to identify which pixels correspond to crops and which correspond
    to weeds, allowing the machine learning algorithm to learn to distinguish

    between the two. The training data is fed into a machine learning model, which
    then uses this data to create a model that can recognize patterns in new

    images. When new images of crops are input into the model, the machine learning
    algorithm can quickly identify which pixels correspond to weeds and which

    correspond to crops. This information can then be used to create a map of weed
    distribution across a ¦eld. Several challenges must be addressed when

    developing a machine learning-based weed detection system. One of the key challenges
    is ensuring that the system is robust to changes in lighting conditions

    and other environmental factors. This can be achieved by using a combination of
    image processing techniques and machine learning algorithms to pre-

    process images before they are input into the weed detection model [34]. Another
    challenge is ensuring that the system can generalize to new images that it

    has not seen before. This can be achieved by using a combination of data augmentation
    techniques and transfer learning, which involves using a pre-trained

    model as a starting point for training a new model on a smaller dataset. Several
    different types of machine learning algorithms can be used for weed

    detection, including convolutional neural networks (CNNs), support vector machines
    (SVMs), and decision trees. Each of these algorithms has its strengths

    and weaknesses, and the choice of algorithm will depend on the speci¦c requirements
    of the application [35]. In conclusion, weed detection using machine

    learning has the potential to revolutionize agriculture by providing a fast, accurate,
    and environmentally friendly alternative to traditional weed management

    techniques. While there are still several challenges that must be addressed, advances
    in computer vision and machine learning are making this technology

    increasingly accessible to farmers and researchers alike.

    Crop yield prediction: Crop yield prediction is a crucial task in agriculture
    as it helps farmers and agricultural experts to make informed decisions about
    crop

    production, resource management, and market supply. Traditionally, crop yield
    prediction has been done using various statistical models and methods, but

    with the recent advancements in machine learning, it has become possible to predict
    crop yields more accurately using data-driven approaches. Machine

    learning has proven to be a valuable tool in agriculture and has the potential
    to revolutionize the industry by making it more e¨cient and sustainable. The

    main objective of crop yield prediction using machine learning is to develop models
    that can accurately estimate the yield of a particular crop in a speci¦c

    area based on various factors such as weather conditions, soil properties, and
    agricultural practices. Machine learning models for crop yield prediction

    typically use large datasets of historical weather and crop data to train the
    model and make predictions for the future. One of the most common approaches

    for crop yield prediction is supervised learning, where the model is trained using
    labelled data, which includes both input features (such as temperature,

    rainfall, and soil type) and

    the corresponding crop yield. Supervised learning algorithms such as regression,
    decision trees, and neural networks are commonly used for crop yield

    prediction [36]. These algorithms can learn the relationship between the input
    features and the output variable (crop yield) and make accurate predictions for

    new data. Another approach for crop yield prediction is unsupervised learning,
    where the model is trained on unlabelled data to identify patterns and

    relationships in the data. Clustering algorithms such as k-means clustering and
    hierarchical clustering are commonly used in unsupervised learning for crop

    yield prediction. These algorithms can group similar data points based on their
    characteristics and help identify areas with similar crop yield patterns. In recent

    years, deep learning algorithms such as convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and
    recurrent neural networks (RNNs) have been applied to crop yield

    prediction. CNNs are particularly useful for analysing spatial data such as satellite
    images to identify crop types, growth stages, and yield potential [37]. RNNs

    are well-suited for time series data such as historical weather data, which can
    be used to predict future weather patterns and their impact on crop yields.

    Page 10/20

    One of the key challenges in crop yield prediction using machine learning is the
    availability and quality of data. Historical weather and crop data may not be

    readily available or may be incomplete, making it di¨cult to train accurate models.
    Moreover, the data may be biased or outdated, leading to inaccurate

    predictions. Another challenge is the interpretation of the machine learning models,
    which can be complex and di¨cult to understand for non-experts.

    Therefore, it is important to have a clear understanding of the data and the machine
    learning models used for crop yield prediction. In conclusion, crop yield

    prediction using machine learning is a promising approach to improving the e¨ciency
    and sustainability of agriculture. With the right data and machine

    learning models, it is possible to accurately predict crop yields and make informed
    decisions about crop production and resource management. However, there

    are challenges in data availability, model interpretation, and practical implementation
    that need to be addressed to fully realize the potential of machine

    learning in agriculture.

    Farm management: Farm management is a complex process that involves numerous tasks,
    such as planting, harvesting, pest control, and irrigation, among

    others. With the advent of machine learning and arti¦cial intelligence, farmers
    can use technology to optimize their operations and improve their yield.

    Machine learning is a subset of arti¦cial intelligence that enables computer systems
    to learn from data and make predictions or decisions based on that data.

    In the context of farm management, machine learning can be used to analyze various
    data sources, including weather patterns, soil conditions, and crop

    growth, among others. One way in which machine learning can be used in farm management
    is by analysing satellite imagery to monitor crop health and

    growth. By analyzing changes in vegetation density and color, machine learning
    algorithms can predict crop yields, identify areas of the farm that require

    attention, and provide recommendations for irrigation and fertilization [38].
    Another application of machine learning in farm management is in predicting

    weather patterns and their impact on crop growth. By analyzing historical weather
    data and current weather patterns, machine learning algorithms can predict

    future weather patterns and provide farmers with recommendations on how to adjust
    their operations to minimize the impact of adverse weather conditions.

    In addition, machine learning can be used to optimize irrigation and fertilization
    schedules by analyzing soil data and plant growth patterns. By analyzing the

    nutrient content of the soil and the growth rate of the plants, machine learning
    algorithms can provide farmers with recommendations on the optimal amount

    and timing of irrigation and fertilization. Machine learning can also be used
    to predict pest and disease outbreaks and provide farmers with recommendations

    on how to prevent or mitigate them [39]. By analyzing historical data on pest
    and disease outbreaks, as well as current weather and soil conditions, machine

    learning algorithms can predict the likelihood of an outbreak and provide farmers
    with recommendations on how to prevent or mitigate it. In conclusion,

    machine learning has the potential to revolutionize farm management by providing
    farmers with valuable insights and recommendations on how to optimize

    their operations and improve their yield. By analyzing various data sources, including
    weather patterns, soil conditions, and crop growth, machine learning

    algorithms can provide farmers with

    recommendations on irrigation, fertilization, pest control, and other key aspects
    of farm management, enabling them to make more informed decisions and

    improve their bottom line [40]. There are several advantages of using machine
    learning in agriculture, some of which include:

    Increased E¨ciency: Machine learning algorithms can help farmers and other agriculture
    stakeholders optimize their operations by reducing the time and

    effort required to perform tasks such as crop monitoring, disease detection, and
    yield forecasting. This can help to increase overall e¨ciency and reduce

    costs.

    Improved Crop Yields: Machine learning algorithms can help farmers predict crop
    yields by analyzing a wide range of data, including weather patterns, soil

    moisture, and historical crop yields. By predicting yields more accurately, farmers
    can make better decisions about when to plant and harvest crops, leading to

    increased yields.

    Enhanced Resource Management: Machine learning algorithms can help farmers manage
    resources such as water, fertilizer, and pesticides more e¨ciently.

    By analyzing data on crop growth and soil conditions, these algorithms can optimize
    resource usage, reducing waste and maximizing productivity.

    Early Disease Detection: Machine learning algorithms can analyze data from sensors
    and other sources to detect signs of plant diseases early. This allows

    farmers to take proactive measures to prevent the spread of disease, minimizing
    the impact on crop yields.

    Precision Agriculture: Machine learning can help farmers to target speci¦c areas
    of their ¦elds that require more attention, allowing for more precise

    application of resources such as fertilizer and pesticides. This can reduce waste
    and improve overall crop health.

    Overall, the use of machine learning in agriculture has the potential to revolutionize
    the way that crops are grown and managed, leading to more e¨cient,

    sustainable, and productive farming practices.

    IV. PERFORMANCE ANALYSIS OF THE PROPOSED SYSTEM

    The proposed system involves machine learning with random forest optimization
    to detect various parameters such as crop yield, disease prediction, weed

    detection, etc. The proposed system is shown in ¦gure 3.

    1. Data gathering: Data gathering is an essential step in machine learning, and
    it is particularly crucial when building a model to detect crop yield using the

    random forest algorithm. The quality and quantity of data used to train the model
    can signi¦cantly affect its accuracy and ability to make accurate

    predictions. To gather data for crop yield detection using random forests, one
    must collect data on various environmental factors that affect crop growth and

    yield, such as soil type, temperature, rainfall, sunlight, and fertilizers used.
    The data must be collected from different farms, regions, and seasons to ensure
    a

    diverse dataset. Once the data is collected, it must be preprocessed, cleaned,
    and prepared for training the random forest model. The dataset should be split

    into training, validation, and testing sets to prevent over¦tting and ensure the
    model''s generalizability. The random forest algorithm is a powerful tool for
    crop

    yield detection as it can handle high- dimensional datasets with non-linear relationships
    between variables. It works by creating multiple decision trees and

    combining them to make predictions. Each tree is trained on a random subset of
    the features and a subset of the training data to reduce the risk of over¦tting

    Page 11/20

    [41]. Overall, data gathering is a critical step in machine learning using the
    random forest algorithm to detect crop yield. By collecting high-quality and diverse

    data, preprocessing it, and training the model, we can accurately predict crop
    yield and optimize farming practices for improved crop production. The predicted

    data set is observed from a village to detect the crop yield as shown in ¦gure
    4. At the settlement, the information is taken into account as latitude varies
    from

    place to place. To operate the system, information on the crop, the climate in
    a speci¦c village, and the region are three necessary elements.

    1. Data processing: In machine learning, data processing is a critical stage that
    involves transforming raw data into a format that can be easily analysed by

    algorithms. The data processing stage typically includes several steps, such as
    data cleaning, data transformation, feature extraction, and data splitting. Data

    cleaning involves removing any irrelevant or duplicate data, correcting errors,
    and handling missing data. Data transformation involves scaling, normalizing,
    or

    encoding the data to ensure that it is in a standardized format. Feature extraction
    involves selecting the most relevant features that have a strong correlation

    with the target variable [42]. After completing these steps, the data is usually
    divided into training, validation, and testing sets. The training set is used
    to train

    the machine learning model, while the validation set is used to evaluate the model''s
    performance during training. Finally, the testing set is used to evaluate the

    model''s performance on unseen data. Overall, the data processing stage is essential
    for ensuring the quality of the data and the accuracy of the machine

    learning model [43]. Proper data processing can lead to better model performance,
    faster training times, and more accurate predictions. The testing and

    training phase is implemented in Matlab as shown below:

    2. Feature extraction: A crucial stage in machine learning is feature extraction,
    which entails choosing and manipulating pertinent information from raw data

    to produce instructive features for predictive models. Features like soil type,
    weather patterns, and crop health can all be identi¦ed and studied using feature

    extraction techniques to increase production in agriculture [44]. Some common
    techniques for feature extraction in agriculture include:

    Remote sensing: Using satellites or drones to capture images of crop ¦elds, which
    can then be analysed to extract features such as vegetation index,

    crop growth stage, and soil moisture.

    Sensor data: Collect data from sensors such as soil moisture sensors, temperature
    sensors, and weather stations to extract features such as

    temperature, humidity, rainfall, and soil nutrients.

    Data fusion: Combining data from multiple sources, such as remote sensing and
    sensor data, to create more informative features for predictive modelling.

    Data pre-processing: Transforming raw data into more useful features, such as
    scaling, normalization, and dimensionality reduction techniques. By using

    feature extraction techniques in agriculture, machine learning models can be trained
    to predict crop yields, identify areas for improvement, and optimize

    resource allocation, leading to improved productivity and pro¦tability for farmers.

    3. Model selection: Model selection is an important step in machine learning in
    agriculture to improve productivity. It involves choosing the most appropriate

    machine learning algorithm and model for a speci¦c agricultural problem. Here
    are some key considerations for model selection in agriculture:

    Data quality: The quality and quantity of data available are critical for selecting
    an

    appropriate machine learning algorithm and model. Ensure that the data is representative, unbiased, and of high quality.

    Complexity: Agricultural systems can be complex, with many variables and interactions. Consider the
    complexity of the problem when selecting a model.

    Simple models such as linear regression may work for simple problems, while more
    complex models such as neural networks or decision trees may be needed

    for more complex problems. Interpretability: Interpretability is important in agriculture, as it allows for the understanding of the model''s decision-

    making process. More interpretable models, such as decision trees, may be preferred
    over less interpretable models such as neural networks.

    Performance: The performance of the model is a key consideration. Evaluate the model''s performance
    using appropriate metrics such as accuracy, precision,

    recall, and F1 score. Consider the trade-off between model performance and interpretability.

    Scalability: Consider the scalability of the model, as agricultural systems often
    involve large amounts of data. Models that can handle large volumes of data,

    such as deep learning models, may be preferred. Overall, selecting the right machine
    learning model can help improve agricultural productivity by enabling

    better decision-making, predicting crop yields, detecting disease outbreaks, and
    optimizing resource allocation. Here random forest algorithm is initiated to

    enhance productivity.

    4. Optimization algorithm: Random Forest is a machine-learning algorithm that
    can be used for classi¦cation and regression tasks. While it can be applied to

    various ¦elds, including agriculture, it is not speci¦cally designed to extract
    maximum yield in agriculture. That being said, Random Forests can be used in

    agriculture to make predictions based on input variables such as soil type, weather
    conditions, and crop variety. For example, a Random Forest model could be

    Page 12/20

    trained to predict crop yield based on factors such as temperature, rainfall,
    soil pH, and fertilizer application rates. The model could then be used to optimize

    crop management decisions, such as adjusting irrigation schedules, choosing optimal
    planting dates, and selecting the most effective fertilizers and

    pesticides. To train a Random Forest model for agricultural applications, data
    must ¦rst be collected and pre-processed [45]. This might involve gathering data

    on crop yield, weather conditions, soil properties, and other relevant factors
    from past growing seasons. Once the data is collected, it can be split into training

    and testing sets to evaluate the performance of the model. The Random Forest algorithm
    works by creating a multitude of decision trees, each trained on a

    subset of the data. The algorithm randomly selects a subset of the available features
    at each split point, which helps to reduce over¦tting and improve

    generalization. During training, the algorithm measures the accuracy of each decision
    tree on the training set and uses this information to build a consensus

    model that combines the predictions of all the trees as shown below:

    In this code, we ¦rst load the dataset and split it into training and testing
    sets using the divider and function. The optimized hyperparameters (x_opt) are
    used

    to train the ¦nal random forest model using the TreeBagger function. The model
    is then used to predict the test set and the accuracy of the model is calculated

    as the RMSE. Note that this code assumes that the crop_yield_data.mat ¦le contains
    a matrix X of features and a vector y of corresponding yields. The

    hyperparameters being optimized are the minimum leaf size (x(1)), the number of
    variables to sample (x(2)), and the maximum number of splits (x(3)). Once

    the model is trained, it can be used to predict crop yield based on input variables
    such as weather data and soil properties [46]. The accuracy of the model can

    be evaluated using the testing set, and adjustments can be made to improve its
    performance. In summary, Random Forests can be used in agriculture to

    predict crop yield and optimize management decisions. To train a Random Forest
    model for agricultural applications, data must be collected and pre-

    processed, and the model must be evaluated using a testing set as represented
    in ¦gure 5.

    5. Model evaluation: The model evaluation process in machine learning (ML) involves
    assessing the performance of a trained model on a set of test data to

    determine its accuracy, precision, recall, and other evaluation metrics. In the
    context of agriculture, one popular ML algorithm is the Random Forest algorithm,

    which is commonly used for tasks such as crop yield prediction, pest detection,
    and soil quality assessment. Here is a step-by-step process for evaluating a

    Random Forest model in agriculture:

    Collect and preprocess data: Collect data related to the agricultural problem
    at hand, such as soil data, weather data, crop growth data, etc. Preprocess

    the data by removing missing values, scaling features, and converting categorical variables into
    numeric form.

    Split the data: Split the preprocessed data into two parts: training data and
    test data. The training data is used to train the Random Forest model, while the
    test

    data is used to evaluate the model''s performance.

    Train the model: Train the Random Forest model on the training data. The model
    should be tuned to obtain the best results.

    Test the model: Test the model on the test data. The test data should be completely
    separate from the training data to avoid bias.

    Evaluate the model: Evaluate the performance of the model using various evaluation
    metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, confusion matrix,

    etc. These metrics will provide insight into how well the model is performing
    and whether it is suitable for the given agricultural problem. Adjust the model: 

    Based on the evaluation results, adjust the model parameters or the preprocessing
    steps to improve the model''s performance.

    Finalize the model: After obtaining satisfactory results, ¦nalize the model and
    deploy it for practical use. Overall, the model evaluation process in MI using

    Random Forest in agriculture involves collecting and preprocessing data, splitting
    it into training and test data, training and testing the model, evaluating its

    performance using various metrics, and adjusting the model as needed to achieve
    optimal results.

    Page 13/20

    6. Performance analysis and outcome: The proposed system is applied in Matlab
    Simulink to assess the optimum results as demonstrated in ¦gure 6.

    The confusion matrix is a performance evaluation tool that is widely used in machine
    learning to measure the accuracy of a model''s predictions. In the context

    of a random forest algorithm for agricultural yield enhancement, a confusion matrix
    can be used to evaluate the accuracy of the model in predicting crop yield

    based on a set of input variables such as soil type, weather conditions, and crop
    variety. 

    The confusion matrix is a table that summarizes the performance of a classi¦cation
    model by comparing the actual and predicted values [47]. 

    It consists of four different components: true positive (TP), true negative (TN),
    false positive (FP), and false negative (FN1).

    In the context of agricultural yield enhancement, these components can be de¦ned
    as follows:

    True positive (TP): The number of times the model correctly predicted a high-yield crop when the
    actual yield was high.

    True negative (TN): The number of times the model correctly predicted a low-yield crop when the
    actual yield was low.

    False positive (FP): The number of times the model incorrectly predicted a high-yield crop when the
    actual yield was low.

    False negative (FN): The number of times the model incorrectly predicted a low-yield crop when the
    actual yield was high.

    The confusion matrix can be used to calculate several performance metrics for
    the model, such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. These metrics can

    provide insights into how well the model is performing and can help identify areas
    for improvement.

    Algorithm description

    CNN

    The Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) algorithm has shown great potential in
    various ¦elds, including agriculture crop yield prediction.

    CNNs can learn complex patterns and relationships in high- dimensional data, making
    them suitable for analyzing crop images and

    predicting yield. In agriculture crop yield prediction, CNNs are used to analyze
    crop images captured by drones or other aerial vehicles. The

    images are pre-processed and then fed into the CNN to extract features and learn
    patterns. The CNN then makes predictions on the yield

    based on the features extracted from the images [48]. CNNs have been used to predict
    crop yields for various crops, including maize, wheat,

    and rice. The predictions made by CNNs are accurate and reliable and can help
    farmers make informed decisions about crop management.

    Overall, CNNs have the potential to revolutionize agriculture by providing accurate
    crop yield predictions, which can help farmers optimize

    crop management practices and increase crop yields.

    SVM

    Support Vector Machines (SVM) is a machine learning algorithm that can be used
    in agriculture to predict crop yield. SVM is a supervised

    learning technique that is used for classi¦cation and regression analysis. It
    works by ¦nding the best decision boundary that separates the

    data points into different classes or predicts the value of the target variable.
    In agriculture, SVM can be used to predict crop yield based on

    various input features such as soil quality, weather conditions, and farming practices.
    The algorithm can analyze these features and create

    a model that can predict the crop yield for a given set of input data [49]. The
    use of SVM in agriculture can help farmers make informed

    decisions about planting and harvesting crops. By analyzing historical data, SVM
    can predict the optimal time to plant a crop, the best

    fertilizers to use, and the ideal harvesting time. This can help farmers increase
    their crop yields and reduce the risk of crop failure.

    RNN

    Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) is a type of deep learning algorithm that can be
    used in agriculture to predict crop yields. RNNs are

    particularly useful for time-series data, where the data points are collected
    at regular intervals, such as daily or monthly. In agriculture, RNNs

    can be used to analyze a variety of factors that affect crop yields, including
    weather patterns, soil moisture, and fertilizer usage. By

    analyzing this data over time, RNNs can identify patterns and make predictions
    about future crop yields.

    RNNs work by processing inputs sequentially, with each new input being in§uenced
    by the previous inputs [50]. This allows the model to

    capture the temporal dependencies between the data points, which is important
    in time-series analysis. The output of an RNN is a prediction

    of the next value in the sequence. Overall, the use of RNN algorithms in agriculture
    can help farmers make more informed decisions about

    when to plant and harvest their crops, as well as how much fertilizer to apply
    and how often to water their crops. By predicting crop yields

    more accurately, farmers can increase their productivity and pro¦tability, while
    also reducing waste and environmental impact.

    Regression

    algorithm

    To forecast crop yield, regression methods can be employed in agriculture. These
    algorithms can examine several variables that affect

    agricultural output, including weather patterns, soil quality, and fertilizer
    application rates. The program analyses past crop yield data as

    well as data on the variables that affect crop output to forecast crop yield in
    the future. Farmers may enhance crop yields and decrease

    waste by using this data to drive their decisions about when to plant, how much
    fertilizer to use, and when to harvest. Regression algorithms

    are useful for forecasting crop yields, and modern agriculture is using them more
    frequently.

    kNN

    The k-Nearest Neighbors (kNN) algorithm is a machine learning technique used to
    classify data based on similarity measures. In agriculture,

    kNN can be used to predict crop yields by analyzing historical data on crop yields
    and environmental factors such as temperature, rainfall,

    and soil nutrient levels. To use the kNN algorithm in agriculture crop yield prediction,
    the ¦rst step is to gather relevant data on past crop

    yields and environmental factors for a given region. This data can be used to
    train the algorithm and create a model that can predict future

    crop yields based on new environmental data. Once the model is trained, it can
    be used to predict crop yields for a speci¦c location by

    comparing its environmental data to the historical data in the training set. The
    kNN algorithm identi¦es the k-nearest neighbors to the new

    data point and assigns a yield prediction based on the average yield of those
    neighbors. Using the kNN algorithm in agriculture crop yield

    prediction can help farmers optimize their crop production by providing accurate
    predictions of future crop yields. This information can be

    used to adjust crop management practices and make informed decisions about crop
    selection and planting schedules.

    Table I denotes the classi¦cation of the machine learning algorithm.

    Table II determines the crop yield prediction using various machine learning algorithms
    to obtain the optimum results. This shows that the random forest

    algorithm helps to obtain the optimum results. Numerous challenges in agriculture
    have been successfully solved using random forest algorithms. They are

    favored over many other algorithms for a variety of reasons.

    First of all, farmers can make better decisions because of random forest algorithms''
    high accuracy, which is crucial in agriculture. Farmers can properly

    forecast crop yields, spot disease outbreaks, and make better- informed decisions
    about irrigation and fertilizer use by employing random forest algorithms.

    Secondly, random forest algorithms are highly robust to outliers, noise, and missing
    data. This is particularly important in agriculture, where data can be noisy

    and incomplete due to various factors like weather conditions, soil quality, and
    pest attacks.

    Thirdly, random forest algorithms provide feature importance, which means that
    they can identify the most important variables that in§uence the outcome of

    a particular problem. This is helpful in agriculture, where farmers can use this
    information to focus their efforts on the most critical variables.

    Finally, random forest algorithms are scalable and can handle large datasets,
    making them suitable for agriculture, where large amounts of data are generated

    from various sources.

    Overall, the high accuracy, robustness, feature importance, and scalability of
    random forest algorithms make them an excellent choice for solving problems in

    agriculture.

    Future trends of AI in agriculture:

    The future of agriculture is being shaped by arti¦cial intelligence (AI) and machine
    learning (ML) technologies. These technologies have the potential to

    revolutionize the industry by improving crop yields, reducing waste, and making
    farming more e¨cient and sustainable One trend that is expected to gain

    traction is precision farming. By using AI and ML algorithms, farmers can monitor
    crop health, water usage, and soil quality in real-time, enabling them to

    make data-driven decisions and optimize resource allocation. This can lead to
    higher yields, lower costs, and reduced environmental impact. Another trend is

    the development of autonomous farming equipment. Self-driving tractors and other
    machines equipped with AI and ML algorithms can navigate ¦elds, detect

    and remove weeds, and plant crops with precision, reducing the need for human
    labor and increasing e¨ciency. AI-powered predictive analytics is also

    expected to play a signi¦cant role in agriculture. By analyzing historical data
    and real-time weather and soil conditions, farmers can predict crop yields and

    identify potential issues before they become signi¦cant problems. Overall, AI
    and ML technologies have the potential to transform agriculture, making it more

    sustainable, e¨cient, and productive. As these technologies continue to develop
    and become more accessible, they will help farmers address the challenges of

    feeding a growing global population while protecting the environment.

    VI. CONCLUSION

    Using machine learning in agriculture with optimization aims to raise crop yields,
    decrease resource waste, and boost farmer pro¦tability. For the best planting,

    irrigation, fertilization, and pest management practices, machine learning models
    can analyze a signi¦cant quantity of data on crop development, soil

    characteristics, weather patterns, and other factors. The agricultural process
    can be further enhanced by introducing optimization algorithms into the machine

    learning models to discover the optimum solutions to issues like crop rotation,
    water management, and harvesting schedules. This may result in less waste,

    more effective use of resources, and eventually higher yields and more pro¦tability
    for farmers. Overall, using machine learning and optimization in agriculture

    can help farmers overcome some of the di¨culties they encounter, including the
    need to produce more food with fewer resources and the rising need for

    sustainable farming methods.

    \ are one of the staple foods in Boyacá and \nplay an important role in family\
    \ nutrition and food security in \nColombia. Therefore, timely and accurate information\
    \ on the \nirrigation of this crop is relevant in agricultural decision-making,\
    \ \nthe sustainable development of its production and the reduction of \nunnecessary\
    \ water consumption. This study estimated the \nirrigation prescription of a potato\
    \ crop from crop meteorological \ninformation with the support of IoT technologies\
    \ to solve the \nproblem of inefficient water dosing in the crop. Two deep learning\
    \ \nmodels were developed, a One-Dimensional Convolutional Neural \nNetwork (1D-CNN)\
    \ and a short-term long-term memory neural \nnetwork (LSTM). Training data was\
    \ collected daily from a potato \ncrop from 2018 to 2020 using two weather stations\
    \ located in the \nUsoChicamocha \nirrigation \ndistrict. \nTo \npredict \nirrigation\
    \ \nprescriptions, deep learning architectures were trained using \nPython® by\
    \ selecting input climatic variables measured with a \nsubsystem of sensors installed\
    \ in the crop and an actuation \nsubsystem with control of Latch-type solenoid\
    \ valves, both \nremotely controlled wirelessly.  The algorithms were validated\

    \ The results showed that the LSTM model surpassed \nthe 1D-CNN model, obtaining\

    \ in the estimation of \ncrop irrigation, giving a coefficient of determination\
    \ R2 between \n0.881 and 0.919. Irrigation prediction algorithms using deep \n\

    \ \nKeywords-- \nDeep \nLearning, \nCNN, \nLSTM, \nIrrigation \nPrescription,\
    \ IoT, Smart Farming. \n \nI.  INTRODUCTION \nFor the agricultural sector of the\
    \ department of Boyacá in \nColombia, it is necessary to develop irrigation methods\
    \ based \non precision agriculture. Specifically, potato crops require the \n\
    use of irrigation forecast estimation technologies that \ncontribute to increasing\
    \ economic and productive yields, \nminimizing the environmental impact that these\
    \ tasks can \nproduce [1].   \nPrecision farming is a strategy based on the use\
    \ of new \ntechnologies, which allows the productivity of the land to be \nmanaged\
    \ more efficiently, maximizes income and minimizes \nenvironmental impact [2].\
    \ With the advancement of new \ntechnologies in telemetry, remote sensing, communications,\
    \ \nsignal processing, internet connectivity and scientific-technical \nknowledge\
    \ in these areas, it is possible to create crop \necosystems based on the Internet\
    \ of Things (IoT) [3].  \nIoT allows the connection and monitoring of objects\
    \ \nlocated over long distances using WSN technologies and \ncentralized data\
    \ collection systems connected to the network \n[4, 5]. For precision irrigation\
    \ systems, based on IoT, humidity \nsensors located in the crop are used, weather\
    \ stations close to \nthe planted area and actuator systems on solenoid valves\
    \ that \nallow irrigation supported by technical approaches, which take \ninto\
    \ account the dynamic behavior of the crop [6, 7]. The \nirrigation prescription\
    \ and application methods that are now \navailable can be divided into five types:\
    \ \n- Through soil variables: where soil sensors are used to \nmeasure and process\
    \ data on the Volumetric Water Content \n(VWC) or the Potential of the Soil Matrix\
    \ (PCM) [8]. \n- Through climatological variables: which are based on \ncalculations\
    \ of missing water, through formulas of water \nbalance \nand \nmeteorological\
    \ \ndata, \nto \ncalculate \nthe \nEvapotranspiration (ET) [9]. \n- Using plant\
    \ parameters: in this method, remote sensing \ntools are used (satellites, drones\
    \ and Geographic Information \nSystems (GIS) for the management of irrigation\
    \ in crops) and \nsensors connected directly to the plants [10]. \n- Using crop\
    \ models: several models endorsed by \ninternational organizations such as FAO\
    \ are used, which allow \nestimating the hydric status of the soil and the particular\
    \ \nrequirements in each cultivation stage [11]. \n- With the farmer's experience:\
    \ it is based entirely on \nempirical data acquired by each farmer in his field\
    \ and on his \nown experiences. \nAll of these methods can be integrated and automated\
    \ \nthrough IoT-based technologies, cloud computing, and the use \nof machine\
    \ learning algorithms. Additionally, Deep Learning \n(DL) techniques have been\
    \ used in applications for agriculture, \nsince agricultural processes are characterized\
    \ by the \nbiodiversity of products and the variability of crop conditions. \n\
    DL extends its application in the estimation of sowing \nprocesses, crop yield,\
    \ prediction of irrigation prescription, \napplication of nutrients and fertilizers\
    \ in the plots, collection of \nproducts, identification of diseases, climate\
    \ and soil mapping, \namong others, processing information automatically [12-18].\
    \  \nThis work explains the implementation and development \nof an irrigation\
    \ prescription forecasting system in a potato crop \nusing IoT technologies for\
    \ the acquisition and transmission of \ncrop data measured by a sensor network.\

    \ estimation system based on deep \nlearning. \nCrop variables such as maximum,\
    \ minimum and average \ntemperature, soil moisture and rainfall were measured\
    \ daily for \nthree years. The Evapotranspiration of the crop was calculated,\

    \ \nThis study was developed in potato crops from Finca San \nCarlos located in\
    \ the municipality of Tibasosa, Boyacá, \nColombia. The land belongs to large-scale\
    \ Irrigation and \nDrainage District of Chicamocha (UsoChicamocha). The \nUsoChicamocha\
    \ Irrigation Station has eleven irrigation units \nwith one pumping station each\
    \ as illustrated in Fig. 1.  \n \n \nFig. 1. Location of the study field in the\
    \ UsoChicamocha Irrigation District \nand Irrigation Unit (9) of Tibasosa. \n\
    \ \nThe water source for crop irrigation is the La Copa dam, \nand the water is\
    \ distributed along the Chicamocha riverbed. \nThe potato crop is located in the\
    \ Irrigation Unit of Tibasosa (9 \nin Fig. 1). The Tibasosa irrigation unit supplies\
    \ water from the \npotato crops on the San Carlos farm through a pumping \nstation.\
    \ Four lots were used, with an approximate total area of \n100 m2, which are located\
    \ with central coordinates at 5.76534 \n° N, - 72.98283 ° W. \nCultivation lots\
    \ have an average elevation of 2575 m.a.s.l. \nand it has a dry-cold climate.\
    \ The lots have a bimodal regime \nand a water deficit during most of the year,\
    \ the winters are \nshort, cool and humid with a concentration of rains between\
    \ \nApril and May in the first semester and between October and \nNovember in\
    \ the second semester, according to with data \ncollected over 10 years [19].\
    \ Temperature does not drop \nbelow 7 °C or rise above 21 °C, where the average\
    \ annual \ntemperature is 14.05 °C. The average annual brightness in the \nIrrigation\
    \ unit Tibasosa is 1853, with a high qualification for \nthe sowing of agricultural\
    \ species [20].   \n \nB. IoT Based Architecture \nEach intelligent system houses\
    \ the trained deep learning \nmodel implemented on a RaspBerry Pi platform that\
    \ is \nconnected to a Davis Vantage Pro2 Series weather station, \nallowing it\
    \ to access data on ambient temperature, soil \nmoisture, precipitation, and evapotranspiration\
    \ [21]. \nPotato crop was divided into four lots of 25 m2. Each \ncrop is supervised\
    \ and managed by four intelligent systems that \nhave a sensor subsystem in the\
    \ center of the crop and an \nactuation subsystem with control of a Latch-type\
    \ solenoid \nelectrovalve at the entrance to the irrigation supply. A water \n\
    supply with constant outlet pressure is guaranteed for each \ncrop, so that there\
    \ is a linear relationship between the opening \ntime of the solenoid valve and\
    \ the amount of resource applied. \nAccess to meteorological data allows the Smart\
    \ system to \nmake irrigation decisions according to the water balance \nequation\
    \ of the crop expressed in (1).  \n \n)\n(\n1\nmm\nDP\nET\nR\nI\nWC\nWC\nC\nAIN\n\

    \ \nIn the preprocessing phase, the data set was prepared so \nthat the characteristic\

    \ from June 2018 to February \n2020 (60%) was reserved for model training, the\
    \ data set from \nMarch 2020 to October 2020 (20%) was used for validation \n\
    and the dataset for the period November 2021 to June 2021 \n(20%) were used to\
    \ test the models, respectively. In time series \nmodeling, the estimation becomes\
    \ less accurate gradually, so it \nis more advantageous to train the models with\
    \ real data when \navailable. \nDuring the training phase, the dataset was used\
    \ to update \nthe parameters of the networks. The validation dataset was \nused\
    \ during the training phase to monitor the process and \ndetect overfitting [23].\
    \ Finally, the trained models were tested \nwith the test dataset characterized\
    \ as new and unexamined \n(Fig. 3). \n \nFig. 3. Scheme of the Data Preprocessing\

    \ data consisted of time \nseries spaced every hour. The variables were normalized\
    \ to \nensure that they remain on the same scale. This preprocessing \nguarantees\
    \ a stable convergence of parameters in the model. \nThe standardization formula\
    \ used in the studied data set was a \nMin-Max normalization model. For each variable\
    \ in the data \nset, the minimum value of that variable is converted to 0, the\

    \ CNN thickening reduction is done to ensure \ncondensation of information into\
    \ more abstract concepts in \ndeeper layers. Each shrinking stage generally consists\
    \ of one or \nmore convolution layers and several pooling layers connected \n\
    to each other. \nFirst a set of convolutional layers is organized using a \nlocal\
    \ layer-shared filter that generates the response of the \nfilter's convolution\
    \ with its inputs in the output. The outputs of \nthe convolutional layers usually\
    \ have the same dimension as the \ninputs. Second, the outputs of the convolutional\
    \ layers are the \nactivations that go into the pooling layers, which use a \n\
    dimension reduction operator (for example, max) to thin the \nlayers.  \nAs a\
    \ result, a hidden neural unit has a smaller field of view \nthan the entire input\
    \ layer, that is, a neuron located in the \nupper layers has a field of view indicated\
    \ by dashed black lines \nas shown in Fig. 4. This hierarchical design helps to\
    \ capture the \nmost prevalent local training characteristics and extracts the\
    \ \nmost essential parameters on a larger scale in deeper layers.  \n \nFig. 4.\
    \ Structure of the One-Dimensional Convolutional Neural Network used \nin this\
    \ study. \nThe parameters learned by the convolutional layers are \nmade thanks\
    \ to the application of the layer-shared filters. All \nneurons in the convolutional\
    \ layers share a single filter that \nreduces the number of parameters compared\
    \ to a fully \nconnected layers, making CNN training easier. In this work, \n\
    several tests were performed using the 1-DCNN architecture. \nThe model begins\
    \ with the 1D convolutional layer composed \nof 16 convolutional filters, a kernel\
    \ size of 3 and a Rectified \nLinear Unit (ReLU) as activation function. Added\
    \ a max \npooling layers to recover the input characteristics, into more \nmeaningful\
    \ and useful inputs. The inputs are flattened with the \nnext flatten layer which\
    \ is used to split convolutional layers and \nfully connected layers and get the\
    \ first prediction step. \n2) Architecture and parameters of the Long Short-Term\
    \ \nMemory model (LSTM): Another deep learning architecture \nuses Recurrent Neural\
    \ Networks (RNN) to process sequential \ndata efficiently. RNN integrate feedback\
    \ loops, allowing \nthrough them that the information persists during some training\
    \ \nperiods (epochs), by means connections from the outputs of \nthe layers, which\
    \ embedding their results on the input data.  \nBasically, the RNN remember previous\
    \ states and use this \ninformation to predict which one will be next. The connections\
    \ \nbetween nodes form a graph directed along a time sequence, so \nthey are applied\
    \ in lists to handle time series. RNNs have been \nintroduced for sequential learning,\
    \ as they are capable of \nstoring and relating prior information. \nLong Short\
    \ Term Memory (LSTM) are a special type of \nRNN networks that have computational\
    \ units with the ability \nto dominate or suppress input characteristics, allowing\
    \ them to \nstore only characteristic weights more important. While \nstandard\
    \ RNN can model short-term dependencies (that is, \nclose relationships in the\
    \ time series), LSTMs can learn long-\nterm dependencies and determine the optimal\
    \ time delay for \ntime series problems. In this sense, LSTMs operate dependent\
    \ \non experience over time and can learn when to forget and how \nlong to keep\
    \ state information. LSTMs outperform RNNs by \nholding the value of the previous\
    \ output for a short period. \nGiven this characteristic, LSTMs are used mainly\
    \ for \nprocessing and estimating complex variables and combinational \ninputs.\
    \ LSTM have been used in crops such as tomato, \nsoybean and corn, where climate\
    \ data and environmental \nparameters are mapped. These crop variables are periodically\
    \ \nmonitored and data are generated in the form of time series \nthat are analyzed\
    \ and processed to provide diagnosis and \nestimation of irrigation prescriptions\
    \ in crops with very good \nefficiency [27-29]. \nThe solution to the vanishing\
    \ gradient problem is the \nLSTM model that contain specially designed units called\
    \ gates \nand memory cells. The gates are simply neurons with weights \nor gains\
    \ that have the ability to learn: The gates surround the \nmemory cell Ct to control\
    \ the information flow. After training, \nthe input gate it controls which entries\
    \ are significant enough \nto remember. The forget gate ft decides how long and\
    \ what \npast state memory should be retained. The output gate ot \ndetermines\
    \ the amount of memory that is used to produce the \noutput. The integrated operation\
    \ of the gates allows the \nnetwork to remember information from the past and\
    \ discard \nnon-essential information. \n \n \nFig. 5. Structure of the LSTM Neural\
    \ Network used in this study. \n21st LACCEI International Multi-Conference for\

    \ July 17 - 21, 2023. \n5 \nThe LSTM architecture proposed and implemented in\
    \ this \nwork uses a model known as “many to one”, which means that \nmultiple\
    \ data inputs can be predicted in the form of time series \nto predict a single\
    \ value [30]. Fig. 5 shows the LSTM \narchitecture developed where a single input\
    \ layer was arranged \nthat receives the input data xt, a single hidden recurring\
    \ layer \nthat stores the information in a hidden state ht in the memory \ncell\
    \ of the LSTM and a single layer output ot. The hidden layer \ncontains the memory\
    \ units of the LSTM that manage and \ncontrol the input, output and storage of\
    \ data. Tanh or sigmoid \ntransformation operators are provided in each LSTM memory\
    \ \ncell that scale the data to facilitate the information flow. \nEach memory\
    \ cell contains one or more memory cells and \nfour multiplicative gates: input\
    \ it, forget f t, cell gt and output ot \n[31], to overcome the short-term memory\
    \ limitation of the \nRNN. The memory cells memorize the value of the temporary\
    \ \nstate in arbitrary time intervals and the four gates control the \nopening\
    \ or closing of the flow from the new input xt to the next \ncell since it enters\
    \ through the input gate it.  \nThe learning process discriminates what information\
    \ is \nimportant and what is not, as time passes while the assigned \nweights\
    \ are updated. The relationships that define the \noperation and structure of\
    \ the model of each LSTM memory \ncell are defined in (4) to (9) with initial\
    \ values of the state of \ncell C0 = 0 and of the recurring output h0 = 0: \n\

    \ For each epoch a loss function is \nused to evaluate how well the specific algorithm\

    results, the loss function will produce a large value. The \nnumber of LSTM cell\

    \ function ReLU was used to capture \nthe non-linear relationship between input\
    \ and output, as it \nlooks for positivity in the input arguments. If the input\
    \ value is \npositive, it is returned the value; otherwise, if the value is less\
    \ \nthan zero, value zero (0) is returned as the final output. \nThe optimization\

    \ \nA \nnetwork \nof \nfour \ncyber-physical \nsystems \nwas \nimplemented for\
    \ the prescription and application of irrigation \nin an experimental potato crop\
    \ (Fig. 6). It was proposed that \nthe networks of intelligent systems for the\
    \ application of \nirrigation have reactive powers for the prescription and \n\
    application of irrigation, since they depend on the perception \nthey have of\
    \ their environment and the irrigation conditions \nprogrammed by the user. \n\

    \ for Irrigation Management and Monitoring. \nThe availability of WiFi connectivity\
    \ in the study area was \nnecessary for the display, visualization and interpretation\
    \ of the \ninformation in the crop. A mobile application was developed to \ncontrol\
    \ and visualize the status of growing agents, connected \nto devices in the field,\
    \ through a cloud computing platform \n(Cloud-FireBase), hence the importance\
    \ of having a connection \nto Internet Fig. 7. \nB. Training and Testing Performance\
    \ \nThe efficiency of deep learning algorithms can be \ndetermined by evaluating\
    \ the models with the application at \nruntime or by calculating evaluation metrics.\
    \ The overfitting \nand underfitting effects of machine learning models can be\
    \ \nevaluated by comparing losses in the training and testing stages \nof the\
    \ prediction algorithms. In the training of the 1-DCNN \nmodel for the weather\
    \ station, the results showed that the \nexperiments were able to predict the\
    \ irrigation prescription \nwith an MSE lower than 0,105 and validation values\
    \ around \n0,157. The losses in the prediction of the irrigation prescription\
    \ \nfor the implemented LSTM model were lower compared to the \n1-DCNN model,\
    \ where the MSE obtained was 0,082 and \n0,096 for training and validation data\
    \ respectively. \nThe lower training and validation losses for the LSTM \nmodel\
    \ are evident due to increased functionality in the \ncomputational units of the\
    \ LSTM cells. This trend of training \nand validation losses data is listed in\

    \ Boyacá plays an \nimportant role in the economy and food security of the region\
    \ \nand the country, since a large part of the population depends \non it for\
    \ their livelihood. \nIn this work, a precision irrigation prescription prediction\
    \ \nsystem was developed in an experimental potato crop that \nintegrates remote\
    \ sensing, IoT and machine learning \ntechnologies. \nToday, IoT has expanded\
    \ its capabilities to support smart \nand sustainable agriculture. This type of\
    \ technological \napplications for agriculture allow the farmer to efficiently\
    \ \nmanage the crop, increasing productivity and product quality, \nimproving\
    \ crop yield and optimizing the use of water \nresources. \nAn irrigation prescription\
    \ prediction system was designed \nand implemented using IoT technologies that\
    \ automatically \ncommunicate the central processing station with the \nmeasurement\
    \ station and the weather station to make decisions \nabout the application of\
    \ precise irrigation in the crop. The \ncentral system receives weather data from\
    \ the environment that \nwas entered by two verified deep learning algorithms,\
    \ stored \non RaspBerry Pi platforms. \nThe estimation of the irrigation prescription\
    \ in a potato \ncrop was developed using two deep learning models: 1-DCNN \nand\
    \ LSTM. The models were trained using as inputs climatic \nvariables such as the\
    \ maximum temperature, the average \ntemperature, the minimum temperature, the\
    \ amount of water in \nthe soil at two depths, the wind speed and the calculation\
    \ of \nthe Evapotranspiration of the crop.  \nWhen performing the training and\
    \ validation processes \nwith the deep learning algorithms, the LSTM model \n\
    outperformed the estimation of irrigation prediction when \ncompared with the\
    \ results obtained by the 1-DCNN model. \nThe lowest training and test losses\
    \ for the hybrid LSTM model \nwere 0,082 and 0,096. The LSTM performance algorithm\
    \ had \nthe highest determination coefficient, obtaining a coefficient of \ndetermination\
    \ R2 = 0,919, compared to the 1-DCNN model \nscore, which obtained a score of\
    \ R2 = 0,86. \nAlthough the LSTM model presented better prediction \nresults in\
    \ the irrigation prescription in the potato crop with \nrespect to the results\
    \ of the 1-DCNN model, the differences in \nthe irrigation prescription estimates\
    \ of the deep learning \nmodels were successful. Validation of these deep learning\
    \ \nmodels allowed farmers to properly schedule potato crop \nirrigation according\
    \ to water supply predictions.  \nACKNOWLEDGMENT \nA.F. Jiménez express his gratitude\

    data from a local weather station
  explanation: This study assessed the effectiveness of two approaches (direct and
    indirect) in predicting real-time, automated irrigation using machine learning
    with daily climate data. The direct approach directly predicts evapotranspiration
    (ETo) based on historical records, while the indirect approach predicts climate
    variables upon which the ETo calculation depends. The study used temperature,
    humidity, wind speed, air pressure, and solar radiation data from a local weather
    station to forecast ETo using a machine learning algorithm, specifically a Feedforward
    Neural Network (Multi-Layered Perceptron). The results showed that both approaches
    can effectively predict ETo, but the indirect approach provided better forecasting
    capabilities for longer time intervals. This is because the indirect approach
    only uses weather parameters required for ETo equations to model and predict behavior,
    while for the direct approach, the machine learning model is required to forecast
    the combined effect of the climate variables’ trend on the resulting ETo.
  extract_1: Comparing the performance of the approaches and the machine learning
    used, the results obtained indicate that, despite the similar performance of the
    two proposed approaches, the indirect approach provides better ETo forecasting
    capabilities for longer time intervals than the direct approach.
  extract_2: This result is because it only uses weather parameters required for ETo
    equations to model and predict behavior, while for the direct approach, the machine
    learning model is required to forecast the combined effect of the climate variables’
    trend on the resulting ETo.

    \ Accurately estimating and forecasting evapotranspiration is one of the most\
    \ important tasks\nto strengthen water resource management, especially in desert\
    \ areas such as La Yarada, Tacna, Peru,\na region located at the head of the Atacama\
    \ Desert. In this study, we used temperature, humidity,\nwind speed, air pressure,\
    \ and solar radiation from a local weather station to forecast potential\nevapotranspiration\
    \ (ETo) using machine learning. The Feedforward Neural Network (Multi-Layered\n\
    Perceptron) algorithm for prediction was used under two approaches: “direct” and\
    \ “indirect”. In the\nﬁrst one, the ETo is predicted based on historical records,\
    \ and the second one predicts the climate\nvariables upon which the ETo calculation\
    \ depends, for which the Penman-Monteith, Hargreaves-\nSamani, Ritchie, and Turc\
    \ equations were used. The results were evaluated using statistical criteria to\n\
    calculate errors, showing remarkable precision, predicting up to 300 days of ETo.\
    \ Comparing the\nperformance of the approaches and the machine learning used,\
    \ the results obtained indicate that,\ndespite the similar performance of the\
    \ two proposed approaches, the indirect approach provides\nbetter ETo forecasting\
    \ capabilities for longer time intervals than the direct approach, whose values\
    \ of\nthe corresponding metrics are MAE = 0.033, MSE = 0.002, RMSE = 0.043 and\
    \ RAE = 0.016.\nKeywords: evapotranspiration; forecasting; machine learning; deep\
    \ learning; arid zones\n1. Introduction\nNowadays, great efforts are made to achieve\
    \ an efﬁcient use of water in economic\nactivities, especially in agriculture;\
    \ activity that registers the highest water consumption\nin the world. Accurate\
    \ prediction of vegetation water consumption is important in the\nﬁelds of hydrology\
    \ and irrigation engineering [1]. Evapotranspiration (ET) is one of\nthe most\
    \ important components of the hydrological cycle and its accurate estimation is\n\
    very important for the hydrological water balance, design, and management of irrigation\n\
    systems, crop yield, and water resources planning [2–5]. Likewise, it plays an\
    \ essential role\nin simulating the hydrological effects of climate change [6].\n\
    Various methods have been developed over time to estimate potential evapotranspira-\n\
    tion (ETo) from weather data. These methods vary in complexity from models that\
    \ require\nonly basic information, such as the maximum and minimum air temperatures,\
    \ to complex\nmodels that estimate ETo through energy balance models, such as\
    \ the Penman-Monteith\nmethod [7].\nTo date, there have been attempts to estimate\
    \ and predict ETo more accurately. Some\nof them involve numerical and statistical\
    \ approaches that attempt to accurately simulate\nthe random nature of climate\
    \ variables [8]. In parallel, artiﬁcial intelligence techniques\nAgriculture 2022,\
    \ 12, 1971. https://doi.org/10.3390/agriculture12121971\nhttps://www.mdpi.com/journal/agriculture\n\
    Agriculture 2022, 12, 1971\n2 of 15\nhave been developed with the use of tools\
    \ based on statistical learning theory, such as\nartiﬁcial neural networks [9–12].\n\
    Artiﬁcial neural networks (ANNs) are a mathematical approach to the functioning\
    \ of\nthe brain that can be schematically represented for better understanding\
    \ [13]. The use of\nANNs is widespread, although conventional machine learning\
    \ (ML) methods, including\nANN, principal component analysis (PCA), support vector\
    \ machines (SVM), and regression\nanalysis, among others, have been successfully\
    \ used for decades. Recent advances in deep\nlearning have aroused special interest\
    \ in academia by the intelligent monitoring of various\nnatural and artiﬁcial\
    \ processes [14]. The reason for selecting the Multilayer Perceptron\nin this\
    \ research was its ease of implementation. MLP is also known for providing high-\n\
    quality models while keeping the learning time relatively low compared to more\
    \ complex\nmethods [15]. Likewise, time series forecasting is becoming one of\
    \ the most important\nbranches of big data analysis [16]. Hydrology is not unrelated\
    \ to this and especially ETo\nforecasting, which is used in crop irrigation scheduling.\n\
    The reference evapotranspiration (ETr) is usually computed in advance to obtain\
    \ the\nactual evapotranspiration (ETa). For the ETo estimation, artiﬁcial intelligence\
    \ techniques,\nspeciﬁcally ML, are suitable methodologies due to their excellent\
    \ computational efﬁciency\nand less dependence on data [17].\nIn Peru, similar\
    \ works have been developed [12,18], but in high Andean basins that\nalso use\
    \ meteorological information; however, other approaches, such as the one addressed\n\
    by this research, have not been considered. In addition, in the Tacna Region,\
    \ there are no\nsimilar studies.\nThere are proposals for comparing the calculation\
    \ of ETr with different methods.\nFor instance, Yang [19] makes a detailed comparison\
    \ of methods based on temperature\nand radiation using computational techniques\
    \ implemented in MATLAB, with signiﬁcant\nresults. Nowadays, ML is becoming a\
    \ widely used tool in hydrology [20]. Research\nproposals using data science are\
    \ increasing in the calculation of ETr and especially in the\nvalidation of the\
    \ precision of various classical and some recent methods [21]. Speciﬁcally,\n\
    deep learning using neural networks has become a very powerful and interesting\
    \ alternative\nfor the prediction of climate variables based on temperature [9].\n\
    This study aims to test the efﬁciency of two approaches (direct and indirect)\
    \ to predict\ndaily ETo in an arid region located in southern Peru, using machine\
    \ learning with daily cli-\nmate information from an automatic recording station\
    \ scheduled to 30 min. The algorithm\nused corresponds to an MLP (Multi-Layer\
    \ Perceptron) neural network architecture, to de-\ntermine the suitability of\
    \ the proposed forecasting schemes, using the hyperbolic tangent as\nan activation\
    \ method that delivers transformed values between −1 and 1. For the forecast-\n\
    ing effort, we considered ETo values derived from the equations of Penman-Monteith\
    \ [7],\nHargreaves [22], Ritchie [23], and Turc [24].\nThe research goal of this\
    \ study is to devise a predictive model to calculate the evotran-\nspiration of\
    \ our study zone and compare this with other methods. The model may be well\n\
    extended to other arid zones. In this direction, this study attempts to answer\
    \ the following\nresearch questions:\nRQ1: Can time series data be adequately\
    \ transformed into data from supervised\nproblems to apply to neural network models?\n\

    \ [22–25] have studied evapotranspiration dynamics; in this sense, the\npresent\
    \ study uses these deﬁnitions and formulations to be able to compare the calculations\n\
    Agriculture 2022, 12, 1971\n3 of 15\nof evapotranspiration with the prediction\
    \ based on neural networks. Next, we will make a\nbrief description of the formulations\
    \ used in this research.\nPotential Evapotranspiration\nThe potential evapotranspiration\
    \ (ETo) expresses the evaporative power of the atmo-\nsphere at a speciﬁc place\
    \ and time and does not consider the characteristics of the crop or\nsoil factors.\
    \ The factors that affect ETo are climatic variables, such as temperature, radiation,\n\
    humidity, wind and pressure [17–20]. It also describes the maximum water losses\
    \ that\ncan be achieved by evaporation and transpiration from a ﬁeld covered by\
    \ a reference crop\n(for example, turfgrass or alfalfa) without water restrictions\
    \ [26]. Consequently, ETo is a\nclimatic parameter and can be calculated from\
    \ meteorological data. Among the various\nmethods used to estimate ETo, the FAO\
    \ 56 Penman-Monteith method is recommended\nas the main method to determine ETo;\
    \ it is physically based and explicitly incorporates\nboth physiological and aerodynamic\
    \ parameters [7]. Reference evapotranspiration (ETo)\nmodeling is important in\
    \ reservoir management, regional water resource planning, and the\nassessment\
    \ of drinking water supplies [22–24]. Other ETo equations are still being used\n\
    due to historical previous use and data access restrictions (Table 1).\nTable\

    \ [22]. This equation mainly needs the maximum and minimum\ntemperature and is\

    \ Learning. We aim to deepen the use of the statistical theory for constructing\n\
    mathematical models designed to make inferences from sample data (historical),\
    \ and the\nrole played by computer science in machine learning is important. First,\
    \ in the training, we\nneed efﬁcient algorithms to solve the optimization problem,\

    \ in our case, of climate variables. Second,\nonce the learning process of a model\

    \ inference algorithm, that is, its spatial and temporal complexity, can be as\
    \ important\nas its predictive accuracy. This technique is widely used in the\
    \ ﬁeld of hydrology and its\napplications are very varied for various problems\
    \ related to water management [25,27].\n3. Theoretical Foundations of Artiﬁcial\
    \ Neural Networks\nIn this section, we will review the main concepts, to understand\
    \ artiﬁcial neural\nnetworks as a computational technique to predict evapotranspiration.\n\
    3.1. Artiﬁcial Neural Networks and Multilayer Perceptron\nAccording to Equation\
    \ (6) [13], in the Feedforward Architecture, the Topology of the\nArrangement\
    \ of Neurons and their Interconnections Makes the Information Flow in a\nAgriculture\
    \ 2022, 12, 1971\n5 of 15\nUnidirectional Way so that it can Never Pass more than\
    \ Once through a Neuron before\nGenerating the Output Response.\nˆy = g\n\x10\n\
    w0 + ∑\nm\ni=1 xiwi\n\x11\n(6)\nwhere:\nˆy = exit.\ng = non-linear activation\
    \ function.\nw0 = bias (weights).\n∑m\ni=1 xiwi = linear combination of inputs.\n\
    3.2. Multi-Layer Perceptron\nThere are limitations when working with a simple\
    \ perceptron. With it, we can only\ndiscriminate patterns that can be separated\
    \ by a hyperplane and a line in the case of two\ninput neurons. One way to overcome\
    \ these limitations is to include hidden layers; thus,\nobtaining a neural network\
    \ called multilayer perceptron 2. The Multi-layer Perceptron\nor MLP is usually\
    \ trained using an error Back Propagation algorithm or BP. The MLP\nconﬁguration\
    \ is integrated with neurons stacked in multiple layers. Each node in each\nlayer\
    \ is connected to all other nodes in the next layer. There is no connection between\
    \ the\nnodes in the same layer. In an MLP, the data moves from input to output\
    \ through the layers\nin one direction (forward). Hence, this architecture is\
    \ also known as a backpropagation\nnetwork [28].\n3.3. Optimization\nThe optimization\
    \ method is a gradient descent, which can be seen as a local optimizer\nin a continuous\
    \ search space. The purpose of the gradient descent is to ﬁnd the smallest\nerror\
    \ made in the cost function. Equation (7) establishes the gradient descent method.\
    \ It\nwill take a random point and go through it in a loop until it ﬁnds the point\
    \ of least loss,\nupdating the weights on each route [29].\nW = W − n∂j(W)\n∂W\n\
    (7)\nwhere:\nW = new position for the parameters that are closest to the minimum.\n\
    n = learning ratio\nIn recent years, different optimization algorithms have been\
    \ developed to improve\nneural network models. These algorithms are responsible\
    \ for reducing losses and provid-\ning more accurate results; making improvements\
    \ to the neural network by optimizing\nparameters such as weight optimizations,\
    \ initial weight, learning rate and bias, number of\nhidden layers, number of\
    \ nodes in hidden layers, and activation functions [30].\n4. Materials and Methods\n\
    4.1. Data Description\nData were taken from an automatic weather station (Davis\
    \ Instruments, Vantage Pro2\nPlus), located in the La Yarada irrigation area,\
    \ which we can see in Figure 1. The data\ncorrespond to the period from June 2005\
    \ to March 2020, that is, around 16 years of recording,\nwith steps of 30 min.\
    \ These data were taken from daily ﬁgures, generating 5294 records,\nstarting\
    \ from the ﬁle obtained from the automatic station and using code in Python pro-\n\
    gramming language, as a pre-treatment task. The climate variables extracted from\
    \ the\nstation record were: maximum, minimum, and average temperature; relative\
    \ humidity;\nwind speed; atmospheric pressure; precipitation; solar radiation;\
    \ and evapotranspiration.\nAgriculture 2022, 12, 1971\n6 of 15\nAgriculture 2022,\

    \ (km/h), atmospheric pres-\nsure (hPa), precipitation (mm), radiation (W/m2)\
    \ and evapotranspiration (mm), which \nwere measured and recorded every 30 min.\
    \ In the selection phase, we transformed the \ntime and date variables and addressed\
    \ the Null values. In the transformation phase, we \nperformed average aggregation\
    \ tasks in the case of temperature, humidity, wind speed, \natmospheric pressure,\
    \ radiation, and summation aggregation in the case of precipitation \nand evapotranspiration;\
    \ grouping this especially with the date information, to have the \ndata organized\
    \ at a daily level. \nAs part of the transformation phase, noise cleaning of the\
    \ data was carried out using \nthe normalization technique with the mean and standard\
    \ deviation. In the case of the spe-\ncific climate variable of wind speed, we\
    \ had an original defect, apparently caused by some \n(sensor) instrument calibration\
    \ problem, since a lag was noted in its representation be-\ntween the years 2019\
    \ and 2020. This was solved by applying data correction techniques \nbased on\
    \ related settings and interpolations. Furthermore, a moving average technique\
    \ \nwas used to smooth the data and identify any data out of range. For data exploration,\
    \ we \nused machine learning techniques since they are efficient tools for the\
    \ treatment of large \nvolumes of data [32,33], and especially in hydrology [34,35].\

    \ First, for the direct approach, day-by-day evapotran-\nspiration was predicted\
    \ according to the historic values of the evapotranspiration ob-\ntained from\
    \ the weather station. To avoid prediction according to the data predicted, this\
    \ \nprediction (of one day) was made based on seven historic previous days. As\
    \ we moved \nforward, the corresponding value was replaced by the actual data\
    \ from Day 1 of the new \ndata, obtained from the weather station, and so on,\
    \ with our proposed phased and re-\nplacement model (Figure 5). The data frame\
    \ that served to predict the next value was up-\ndated, according to the model\
    \ of the previously trained neural network. \n5.1.2. Applied Methods Results \n\
    For the indirect approach, we used the daily prediction of other climate variables\
    \ \n(temperature, pressure, radiation, wind, humidity) to apply the Penman-Monteith\
    \ equa-\ntion as well as the Hargreaves-Samani, Ritchie, and Turc equations. We\
    \ considered it im-\nportant to verify the precision of each one of them for the\
    \ specific data of our study region. \nThis allowed us to predict 300 days, one\
    \ at a time, and under regular conditions; and al-\nlowed us to predict daily\
    \ data with great precision. Figure 6 shows the prediction using \nthe neural\
    \ network contrasted with the actual data; observing a good approximation for\
    \ \nthe direct approach. \n \nFigure 6. Comparison of the 300-day ETo prediction\
    \ using a neural network with the actual data \n(Direct approach). \nPrecision\
    \ indicators of the model based on the neural network for the direct approach\
    \ \nare: MAE = 0.03312 (Media Absolute Error); MSE = 0.001875 (Media Square Error);\
    \ RMSE \n= 0.043303 (Root of the MSE); and RAE = 0.015553 (Relative Absolute error).\
    \ \nBy having close values between the MAE and RMSE, we can infer that there is\
    \ an \nerror evenly distributed and no significant outliers, which is confirmed\
    \ as we can visual-\nize the comparative curve of the predicted values with the\
    \ actual values. In addition, for \nFigure 6. Comparison of the 300-day ETo prediction\
    \ using a neural network with the actual data\n(Direct approach).\nPrecision indicators\
    \ of the model based on the neural network for the direct ap-\nproach are: MAE\
    \ = 0.03312 (Media Absolute Error); MSE = 0.001875 (Media Square Error);\nRMSE\
    \ = 0.043303 (Root of the MSE); and RAE = 0.015553 (Relative Absolute error).\n\
    By having close values between the MAE and RMSE, we can infer that there is an\n\
    error evenly distributed and no signiﬁcant outliers, which is conﬁrmed as we can\
    \ visualize\nthe comparative curve of the predicted values with the actual values.\
    \ In addition, for the\nmethods based on gradients optimization, it is convenient\
    \ to consider the RMSE to set\nsome parameters in the learning rate, which we\
    \ did reiteratively.\nThe MAE is a low value (MAE = 0.033) and represents an element\
    \ of penalty for\nlarge errors; that is, it is less sensitive to atypical errors,\
    \ which means that there are no\nlarge errors.\nThen we apply scheme (b), in which\
    \ we are in charge of predicting the values of\nthe climate variables using our\
    \ model based on neural networks, and then, based on\nthose predictions, calculate\
    \ the different equations in the literature (Penman-Monteith,\nHargreaves-Samani,\
    \ Ritchie, and Turc) and compare their errors and correlation coefﬁcients\nwith\
    \ the actual data.\nIn the following graphs, we show the prediction of the different\
    \ climate variables\nthat will serve as the input to apply the different previously\
    \ mentioned equations for\ncalculating the ETo, and compare their precision. Figure\
    \ 7 shows the prediction for the\ntemperature variable, minimum and maximum, humidity,\

    \ demonstrates the feasibility of forecasting the short-term daily ETo, which\n\
    is required for irrigation water management purposes, based on the Penman-Monteith,\n\
    Hargreaves-Samani, Ritchie, and Turc equations. Two approaches were tested using\
    \ the\nFeedforward neural network algorithm (Multi-Layered Perceptron). The ﬁrst\
    \ approach, the\ndirect approach, involves estimating future ETo time series from\
    \ historical data obtained\nfrom the automatic station. The second approach, the\
    \ indirect approach, considers forecast-\ning the weather data necessary for the\
    \ ETo equations, maximum temperature, minimum\ntemperature, wind speed, humidity,\
    \ pressure, and evapotranspiration on a daily level using\nthe aforementioned\
    \ machine learning and, subsequently, using these predicted values to\nestimate\
    \ future ETo values.\nThe model precision indicators based on neural networks\
    \ for the direct approach\nare values that guarantee a good precision in the forecast,\
    \ MAE = 0.033, MSE = 0.002,\nRMSE = 0.043, and RAE = 0.016. Regarding the indirect\
    \ approach, the prediction of the\nclimate variables that were used to calculate\
    \ the ETo was carried out. The precision\nindicators show optimal conditions in\
    \ their process and guarantee the suitability of the\npredicted variables.\nThe\
    \ results indicate that using the approaches proposed in this study makes it possible\n\
    to forecast up to 300 days of daily ETo in advance within a reasonable range of\
    \ time.\nFurthermore, the use of this methodology provides an additional estimate\
    \ of the expected\nvariability values for each forecast day, which ensures a very\
    \ good estimate of ETo. The\nforecast with more than 300 days in advance is affected\
    \ by the relationship of the value\nof the time series with the previous ones.\
    \ Therefore, the accuracy of the predicted ETo\ndecreases over time.\nAgriculture\
    \ 2022, 12, 1971\n14 of 15\nComparing the performance of the approaches and the\
    \ machine learning used, the\nresults obtained indicate that, despite the similar\
    \ performance of the two proposed ap-\nproaches, the indirect approach provides\
    \ better ETo forecasting capabilities for longer time\nintervals than the direct\
    \ approach. This result is because it only uses weather parameters\nrequired for\
    \ ETo equations to model and predict behavior, while for the direct approach,\
    \ the\nmachine learning model is required to forecast the combined effect of the\
    \ climate variables’\ntrend on the resulting ETo. Therefore, the indirect approximation\
    \ may be extended to other\nequations of ETo.\nAuthor Contributions: Conceptualization,\

  key_findings: '- Both direct and indirect approaches can effectively predict ETo.

    - The indirect approach provides better forecasting capabilities for longer time
    intervals.

    - The indirect approach only uses weather parameters required for ETo equations
    to model and predict behavior, while the direct approach requires the machine
    learning model to forecast the combined effect of the climate variables’ trend
    on the resulting ETo.'
  limitations: There are no major limitations mentioned in the study. However, it
    is important to note that the findings are based on data from a specific location
    (Atacama Desert, Peru) and may not be directly applicable to other regions with
    different climatic conditions.

  relevance_evaluation: 'The study is highly relevant to the point mentioned in the
    outline as it directly addresses the challenge of using data heterogeneity, uncertainty,
    and quality issues in real-time insight generation for automated irrigation systems.
    By utilizing machine learning algorithms, specifically a Feedforward Neural Network
    (Multi-Layered Perceptron), the study demonstrates the effectiveness of two approaches
    in predicting ETo, a crucial parameter for irrigation management. The findings
    suggest that the indirect approach, which involves predicting climate variables
    upon which ETo depends, provides better forecasting capabilities for longer time
    intervals, potentially enabling more accurate and efficient irrigation scheduling.


    The study employs various climate variables (temperature, humidity, wind speed,
    air pressure, and solar radiation) to predict ETo, addressing the issue of data
    heterogeneity. It also utilizes a machine learning approach to handle the uncertainty
    and quality issues associated with real-time data, making the findings applicable
    to practical irrigation systems.


    Overall, the study aligns well with the outline point and provides valuable insights

    Internet of Things (IoT) technologies can greatly benefit from machine learning
    techniques and Artificial Neural Networks for data mining and vice versa. In the
    agricultural field, this convergence could result in the development of smart
    farming systems suitable for use as decision support systems by peasant farmers.
    This work presents the design of a smart farming system for crop production, which
    is based on low-cost IoT sensors and popular data storage services and data analytics
    services on the Cloud. Moreover, a new data mining method exploiting climate data
    along with crop production data is proposed for the prediction of production volume
    from heterogeneous data sources. This method was initially validated using traditional
    machine learning techniques and open historical data of the northeast region of
    the state of Puebla, Mexico, which were collected from data sources from the National
    Water Commission and the Agri-food Information Service of the Mexican Government.

    www.nature.com/scientificreports\nDiscrimination of plant root \nzone water status\
    \ in greenhouse \nproduction based on phenotyping \nand machine learning techniques\n\
    Doudou Guo, Jiaxiang Juan, Liying Chang, Jingjin Zhang   & Danfeng Huang\nPlant-based\
    \ sensing on water stress can provide sensitive and direct reference for precision\
    \ irrigation \nsystem in greenhouse. However, plant information acquisition, interpretation,\
    \ and systematical \napplication remain insufficient. This study developed a discrimination\
    \ method for plant root zone water \nstatus in greenhouse by integrating phenotyping\
    \ and machine learning techniques. Pakchoi plants were \nused and treated by three\
    \ root zone moisture levels, 40%, 60%, and 80% relative water content. Three \n\
    classification models, Random Forest (RF), Neural Network (NN), and Support Vector\
    \ Machine (SVM) \nwere developed and validated in different scenarios with overall\
    \ accuracy over 90% for all. SVM model \nhad the highest value, but it required\
    \ the longest training time. All models had accuracy over 85% in all \nscenarios,\
    \ and more stable performance was observed in RF model. Simplified SVM model developed\
    \ \nby the top five most contributing traits had the largest accuracy reduction\
    \ as 29.5%, while simplified RF \nand NN model still maintained approximately\
    \ 80%. For real case application, factors such as operation \ncost, precision\
    \ requirement, and system reaction time should be synthetically considered in\
    \ model \nselection. Our work shows it is promising to discriminate plant root\
    \ zone water status by implementing \nphenotyping and machine learning techniques\
    \ for precision irrigation management.\nOver the past decade, the environmental\
    \ information based methods for precision management have been widely \napplied\
    \ in greenhouse practice. The ambient climate of greenhouse such as temperature,\
    \ humidity, and root zone \nwater content is monitored closely as the reference\
    \ for crop management1. Water and fertilizer are the most \nimportant inputs for\
    \ greenhouse crop because the plant growth is significantly affected by plant\
    \ water and nutri-\ntion status. Root zone water status has a significant influence\
    \ on plant evapotranspiration rate2. Root zone water \nstatus indicates the moisture\
    \ situation of plant root growth environment and highly correlates to plant growing\
    \ \nstatus3. Monitoring of root zone water status could help to establish the\
    \ precision management strategy on irriga-\ntion in crop production. However,\
    \ conventional probe sensors for moisture measurement are limited on detecting\
    \ \nthe actual substrate water status effectively in trays. Several commercialized\
    \ soil moisture sensors such as tensi-\nometer, neutron probes and time domain\
    \ reflectometry probes have been widely used in pot planting but not \napplicable\
    \ for seedlings mainly because the high costs, unsuitable size, and unreliable\
    \ measurements. The volume \nof cell in plug tray is minimal resulting that common\
    \ probe sensors can hardly insert into substrates. In addition, \ndue to the uneven\
    \ water distribution among different plug trays, the growers require continuous\
    \ and real-time \nwater content monitoring for large -scale rather than for single\
    \ point, to prevent the seedlings from water stress \nand growth restriction.\
    \ The relationship between plug tray weight and root zone water content was studied\
    \ to \nprovide a weighting based irrigation control strategy4. However, irrigation\
    \ based on tray weight is labor intensive \nand inaccuracy in practice.\nWith\
    \ the development of sensing technology, real-time monitoring of physiological\
    \ and ecological informa-\ntion of the plant itself provides an approach to indicate\
    \ root zone water status5, 6. Plant physiological traits such \nas tissue water\
    \ status, stomatal conductance, and sap flow are known sensitively responding\
    \ to water stress. The \nstatus of plant water content could be a useful indicator\
    \ for irrigation7. Phenotypic traits such as leaf area, leaf \nangle, and thermal\
    \ temperature show strong correlations with the root zone water status8. However,\

    \ irrigation methods are still at research/developing stage and little used yet\
    \ for practice (except for \nthermal sensing in some situations). Systematical\
    \ research on phenotypic traits selection for irrigation has seldom \nbeen reported.\n\
    Rapid and non-destructive plant sensing method is needed for plant-based information\
    \ acquisition. The \napplication of machine vision technology could be the solution.\
    \ Plant phenotypic traits can be quickly and effi-\nciently obtained by imaging-based\
    \ automatic inspection and analysis5. Therefore, machine vision has the poten-\n\
    tial to realize the rapid, reliable, real-time monitoring of plant status with\
    \ low cost, which meets the requirements \nfor precision irrigation scheduling9.\
    \ Machine vision technology has been applied in plant monitoring such as the \n\
    detection of plant abiotic stress through color variation, plant movement monitoring,\
    \ textural features detection, \ncanopy temperature measurement and detection\
    \ of plant biotic disease8, 10–13. With the development of pheno-\ntyping technology,\
    \ various imaging sensors have been used to collect phenotypic parameters which\
    \ are related \nto plant stress in automated or semi-automated high-throughput\
    \ plant phenotyping platforms14, 15. However, \ndata generated by these platforms\
    \ has enormous volume, variety, velocity, and veracity, which must be efficiently\
    \ \nanalyzed. The classical statistical method is difficult to analyze the high-dimensional\
    \ and dynamical image data, \nresulting limited phenotyping interpretation16.\n\
    Machine learning, a type of artificial intelligence has good performance in efficiently\
    \ dealing with large \namount of data in various domains. It is promising in phenotyping\
    \ applications on features extraction and pat-\nterns identification from large\
    \ dataset through holistic approaches. Machine learning algorithm has few input\
    \ \nfactors with high predict accuracy and strong adaptability. Several machine\
    \ learning algorithms, such as support \nvector machine (SVM), artificial neural\
    \ network (ANN) and random forest (RF), have been used for classification \nmodel\
    \ development17, 18.\nIn practice, machine learning method has been applied to\
    \ remote sensing system and irrigation system19, 20. \nMany studies have reported\
    \ plant stress phenotyping using machine learning in identification, classification,\
    \ \nquantification, and prediction of plant water status, but few focused on phenotyping\
    \ root zone water stress10, 21, 22. \nIt is crucial to detect plant water stress\
    \ at the early stage before any damage observed with visible wilting, which \n\
    affect subsequent plant growth and quality. Correlating root zone water status\
    \ with plant phenotype to supervise \nirrigation system could be a practical way\
    \ in precision irrigation system with easy operation and quick response.\nPakchoi\
    \ (Brassica campestris ssp. L. chinensis) is one of typical vegetables in greenhouse\
    \ production, which is \nsensitive to water status. During the past few years,\
    \ commercial production of leafy vegetable has been initiated \nand developed\
    \ both in the greenhouse (solar plant factory) and artificial light plant factory23.\
    \ Growing baby pak-\nchoi with plug trays using substrate in greenhouse is a promising\
    \ production mode because it is suitable for mech-\nanized harvesting and precision\
    \ management, which improves the production efficiency24. The accurate irrigation\
    \ \nscheduling is critical for safe and high quality of greenhouse vegetable,\
    \ as well as improving the resource utiliza-\ntion and production profits. This\
    \ study aims to discriminate plant root zone water status nondestructively, taking\
    \ \npakchoi as the plant material, which is a part of on-going research on developing\
    \ machine vision-based precision \nirrigation system for factory production of\
    \ pakchoi. The objectives of this study are: (1) investigating the rela-\ntionship\
    \ between root zone water status and plant growth; (2) developing a root zone\
    \ water status discrimination \nmodel by applying phenotyping technology and machine\
    \ learning algorithms; (3) evaluating the performance of \ndeveloped models in\
    \ various application scenarios.\nResults and Discussion\nThe effect of root zone\
    \ water status on plant growth. \nThe effect of root zone water status on pakchoi\
    \ \nplant growth was investigated under three relative water content treatments,\
    \ 40% (low), 60% (medium), and \n80% (high). The fresh and dry weight of shoot\
    \ and root for both cultivars were significantly different between \ntreatments\
    \ as shown in Fig. 1 with ANOVA test (p < 0.01). Treatments had different effects\
    \ between cultivars. For \ncultivar “Huawang”, treatment of medium water content\
    \ had the highest values of fresh and dry weight of shoot \nand root (fresh weight\
    \ as 2727.1 mg and 184.4 mg for shoot and root respectively, and dry weight as\
    \ 185.1 mg and \n15.1 mg per plant for shoot and root respectively), while cultivar\
    \ “Kangre 605” had the lowest values under such \ntreatment (fresh weight as 500.3\
    \ mg and 52.0 mg for shoot and root respectively, and dry weight as 45.3 mg and\
    \ \n5.1 mg per plant for shoot and root respectively). The differences of pakchoi\
    \ growth were significant between two \ncultivars under the treatment of medium\
    \ water content (p < 0.01 for all comparisons), but there were no signifi-\ncant\
    \ differences observed between cultivars under the other two treatments. This\
    \ is mainly because “Kangre 605” \nis a heat-resistant cultivar, which has the\
    \ ability of growing well under water stress conditions. “Huawang” prefers \n\
    moderate water condition, and both the excess and deficiency of water supply could\
    \ affect the accumulation of \nbiomass.\nRelationship between root-zone water\
    \ status and phenotypic traits. \nPhenotypic traits extrac-\ntion. Two types of\
    \ images were acquired, visible and near-infrared (NIR) image (Supplementary Fig. S1).\
    \ There \nwere in total 37 phenotypic traits extracted from images for each plant\
    \ (Table 1). These phenotypic traits were \nclassified into three categories for\
    \ easy description, morphological trait, color trait, and NIR trait, including\
    \ 19, 6, \nand 12 traits respectively. Morphological traits mainly indicated the\
    \ shape feature of target plant region, such as \ncircumference and eccentricity.\
    \ Color traits were generated from color images, including the pixel value informa-\n\

    Root zone water status discrimination model development and validation. \nModeling\

    \ (PLS-DA) was conducted to present a visual \nspace distribution of three treatment\
    \ groups for assessing the modeling potentiality using the 32 selected phe-\n\
    notypic traits. Figure 3 shows the PLS-DA model performance and cumulative variance\
    \ explained by the top \nfive components. The goodness of fit was quantified by\
    \ R2 while the predictive ability was indicated by Q2. The \naccuracy, R2, and\
    \ Q2 of PLS-DA model by using all the top five components reached 73%, 0.35, and\
    \ 0.34, respec-\ntively. The value of R2 and Q2 should be greater than 0.5 to\
    \ be taken as an indicator of model acceptability. The \ncumulative explained\
    \ variance ranged from 17.6% to 72.2% by the number of components from one to\
    \ five, with \nthe first three components explaining 66.9% variance. The performance\
    \ of PLS-DA model improved (R2 = 0.67, \nQ2 = 0.66) by excluding the medium root\
    \ zone water group as the difference between medium water group and \nthe other\
    \ two groups was not significant. Overall, PLS-DA shows the potential of root\
    \ zone water status discrim-\nination by phenotypic traits.\nDiscrimination model\
    \ development. The total dataset used for model development was 2120 samples with\
    \ 32 \ntraits of each (2120*32), and the dataset was separated into 80% training\
    \ dataset and 20% testing dataset. The \ntraining data set was used for model\
    \ development. Parameter values for the three modeling algorithms, which are \n\
    Random Forest (RF), Neural Network (NN), and Support Vector Machine (SVM), were\
    \ selected by using 10-fold \ncross validation in three repetitions tuning (Table 2).\
    \ Among the training dataset, 10% of the data were used as \nvalidation in each\
    \ cross validation. Table 2 also lists the package, function, and program training\
    \ time of modeling \nalgorithms. All the R codes ran in Rstudio 1.0.44 on the\
    \ platform of windows 10 × 64 system with an Intel Core \ni7-5500U CPU and 4 GB\
    \ RAM.\nConsidering the dynamics of the data input and training in practice, the\
    \ model training time is an important \nfactor to be considered in the optimization\
    \ process. The training time increases exponentially with the number \nof parameters\
    \ and varies substantially between algorithms. Among these three modeling algorithms,\
    \ NN took \nthe shortest training time as 544.37 seconds, which was approximately\
    \ 76% of RF and 44% of SVM. The training \ntime consumption of SVM should be considered\
    \ in real case of decision support system as this method is more \nsensitive to\
    \ the data size than others, especially when time is limited and data set is large.\
    \ The trait contribution \nanalysis in each model could be a way to simplify the\
    \ model inputs and reduce the training time, which was dis-\ncussed in section\
    \ 3.3.\nThe mean prediction accuracy and Cohen’s Kappa coefficient (k) of all\
    \ the three models were higher than 90% \nand 0.85 respectively, as shown in Fig. 4A,B.\
    \ SVM model had the best performance with higher accuracy and k \nvalue (92.5%\
    \ and 0.89 respectively) than the other two models. The result also showed that\
    \ SVM was slightly more \nstable with less variation than others.\nThe ROC (receiver\
    \ operating characteristic) curve was used to evaluate the performance of modeling\
    \ classi-\nfier. Figure 4C shows the ROC curves of the three models. The x-axis\
    \ represents false positive rate (FPR), and the \ny-axis represents true positive\
    \ rate (TPR). The area under the curve (AUC) indicates classification performance,\
    \ \nwhich is the ability of target model to correctly classify the plants in different\
    \ root zone water status. SVM model \nhad the highest AUC value as 0.6827 among\
    \ the three models, while the differences were not substantial com-\npared to\
    \ 0.6766 and 0.6788 AUC of RF model and NN model respectively.\nFigure 1. Effects\

    \ trait and NIR trait appeared more frequently than morphological trait, which\
    \ shows plant \ncolor and NIR characteristics would be more related to root zone\
    \ water status. This result agrees with several \nstudies in spectroscopy and\
    \ remote sensing research on the relationship between spectral reflectivity and\
    \ water \nrelated index13. The most frequently appearing traits in top five traits\
    \ of developed models were Mean.Color.\nGreen and Mean.Color.Red. There was only\
    \ one morphological trait in NN model and in SVM model, named as \nVrectsizeymm\
    \ and Compactness, respectively. This is likely because plant morphological appearance\
    \ is basically \ndetermined by genotype and substantially influenced by environment\
    \ such as airflow and illumination.\nModel classification ability dropped when\
    \ only the top five traits were used to develop model, named as sim-\nplified\
    \ model. The accuracy of simplified RF model and NN model could still reach 79.7%\
    \ and 77.4% respectively, \nwhile the accuracy of simplified SVM model decreased\
    \ substantially from 92.5% to 63.0% with 29.5% reduction. \nFor SVM model, the\
    \ cumulative contribution of the top five traits was 22.8%, lower than that of\
    \ RF model and \nNN model (32.6% and 29.9%, respectively), which could be the\
    \ main reason for the great decrease on the simpli-\nfied model accuracy. In addition,\
    \ simplified SVM model did not include color trait, while simplified NN model\
    \ \ndid not include NIR trait (Table 4), which showed color related traits would\
    \ better reflect plant root zone water \nstatus than the other two trait types\
    \ in RF and NN models while the SVM model relied more on NIR traits than \nthe\
    \ others.\nConclusion\nThis study developed a root zone water status discrimination\
    \ method during plant growth by integrating phe-\nnotyping and machine learning\
    \ techniques. Pakchoi plants were used. Three types of phenotyping traits such\
    \ \nas morphological trait, color trait, and near-infrared trait were acquired\
    \ as the inputs for classification models. \nThree machine learning models were\
    \ developed, Random Forest (RF), Neural Network (NN), and Support Vector \nMachine\
    \ (SVM), with accuracy above 90% for all. The SVM model had the highest accuracy\
    \ as 92.5% in model \ndevelopment but it took the longest training time as 1245.94\
    \ seconds in this study. In addition, the SVM model \nhad the largest accuracy\
    \ reduction (22.8%) in simplified model developed by the top five most contributing\
    \ trait \nresulting from trait contribution evaluation.\nThe three developed models\
    \ were evaluated by test dataset (20% of entire data pool) consisting of data\
    \ from \ndifferent scenarios, which were different time a day, growth stage, weather\
    \ condition, and pakchoi cultivar. All the \nthree models reached the overall\
    \ accuracy higher than 90%. SVM model had the highest value as 92.5%, but no \n\
    substantial differences were observed among the three. By evaluated in different\
    \ scenarios, the three models had \naccuracy over 85% in all scenarios with some\
    \ fluctuations. The accuracy at the time point of 06:00 h was the lowest \nfor\
    \ all the three models, and the trend of increasing was observed during the growth\
    \ of plant. Better performances \nwere observed in cloudy weather condition than\
    \ in sunny weather condition of the three models. NN model had \nthe largest difference\
    \ on accuracy between cultivars. Overall, SVM model had the highest classification\
    \ accuracy, \nbut more stable performance was observed in RF model considering\
    \ all the scenarios.\nThis study demonstrates the potential of machine learning\
    \ approach on discriminating root zone water status \nbased on complex plant phenotyping\
    \ traits. The developed discrimination method could promote the plant-based \n\
    irrigation decision making and implementation in practice. Developed models could\
    \ be further used in precision \nirrigation system with appropriate modifications\
    \ if environment or crop change. Further study is suggested to \ninvestigate the\
    \ repaid response of plant phenotypic traits to the change of root zone water\
    \ status and the perfor-\nmance of classification models on such response. Therefore\
    \ accumulative effect of water stress on plant growth \nduring the growing period\
    \ should be minimized with the real-time discrimination to control the potential\
    \ yield \nloss. Population phenotyping and water status discrimination are also\
    \ worth further study due to plant canopy \nmutual occlusion and growth competition.\
    \ In addition, phenotyping traits were extracted from images acquired \nin a constant\

    \ and growth conditions. \nThe experiment was conducted in a commercial greenhouse\
    \ \nfrom May 1th to 29th in year of 2015, located at northeast of Shanghai, China\
    \ (31°10′ N, 121°36′ E). Two cultivars \nof pakchoi were used, “Huawang” and “Kangre\
    \ 605”, under pot substrate cultivation. Commercial substrate (veg-\netable seedling\
    \ substrate, Zhongnuo Agriculture Technology Co., Ltd, Huaian, China) composed\
    \ of peat moss, \nperlite, and organic matter was used. Plug tray was used at\
    \ seedling stage. On the tenth day after sowing, seedlings \nwere transplanted\
    \ to pots (volume of 1.13 L) with one seedling per pot.\nThe greenhouse air temperature,\
    \ humidity, photosynthetic photon flux, substrate temperature and electrical \n\
    conductivity were monitored every 5 minutes by using an automatic data logging\
    \ system (PM-11 Phytomonitor, \nBio Instruments S.R.L., Chisinau, Moldova) with\
    \ RTH-11 Meter and SMTE sensor. During the whole experimen-\ntal period, the average\
    \ air temperature was 24.3 °C with the highest as 36 °C and lowest as 13.7 °C.\
    \ The relative \nhumidity ranged from 16.4% to 88% with an average of 58%. Mean\
    \ daily accumulative solar radiation in the \ngreenhouse was 2.62 MJ/(m2·d), with\
    \ a maximum of 5.41 MJ/(m2·d) at May 21st.\nTreatments of root zone moisture level\
    \ were applied to each pot after transplanting. Root zone moisture was \nindicated\
    \ by the relative water content, the percent of volumetric water content comparing\
    \ to field water capacity. \nBecause of the dynamic change of root zone moisture\
    \ status, upper limit was applied to define the moisture level \nof root zone.\
    \ In other word, irrigation stopped when root zone moisture reached the upper\
    \ limit. Considering the \nfeasibility of moisture level control and plant growth,\
    \ three root zone moisture levels were applied, 40%, 60%, and \n80% (referred\
    \ to as ‘Low’, ‘Medium’, and ‘High’ hereafter, respectively). In total, five plants\
    \ of each cultivar were \nrandomly assigned to each treatment. Irrigation was\
    \ conducted manually for all plants once a day according to \nthe pot weight.\n\
    Image acquisition and processing. \nA commercial phenotyping system (Scanalyzer3D,\
    \ LemnaTec GmbH, \nWürselen, Germany) was used for image acquisition (Supplementary\
    \ Fig. S2). Images of each plant were taken \ndaily from top view before irrigation\
    \ from May 11th to 29th, 2015. Two types of image were acquired simultane-\nously,\
    \ near-infrared (NIR) and visible (VIS) images. The 20-day growing period was\
    \ divided into five stages with \nfour days of each, referred to as stage 1, 2,\
    \ 3, 4, and 5. Plant growing level especially the number of leaves was dif-\n\
    ferent at different stage (Fig. 6). The reference growth stage was divided mainly\
    \ according to the new leaf emerge \ntime under different treatments and adjusted\
    \ to even distribution for model comparison.\nTwo image acquisition schedules\
    \ were applied with one from 06:00 h to 18:00 h at two hour intervals and the\
    \ \nother one only at 14:00 h. Weather condition was classified into two scenarios,\
    \ sunny and cloudy (referred to as ‘S’ \nand ‘C’ hereafter, respectively) according\
    \ to weather forecast. Efforts were made to have the two image acquisition \n\
    schedules for each weather scenario in each stage (Table 5). At the end of 20-day\
    \ growing period, the fresh and \ndry weight of each plant sample were measured.\
    \ Each sample was dried at 105 °C for 1 hour and then at 60 °C to \nconstant weight.\
    \ The dried sample was weighted to an accuracy of ± 0.1 mg.\nImages acquired by\
    \ the imaging system were organized into LemnaBase which is the central database\
    \ interface \nfor the phenotyping system, and processed through an analysis pipeline\
    \ specifically adjusted for pakchoi by using \nLemnaGrid which is an image analysis\
    \ component of the phenotyping system. Image processing procedure in \nLemnaGrid\
    \ consisted of four main steps shown as the flowchart in Supplementary Fig. S3:\
    \ (1) image preprocess-\ning, extracting target images from LemnaBase; (2) segmentation,\
    \ separating target plant from the background \nin the image; (3) feature extraction,\
    \ analyzing segmentation result and producing phenotypic traits; and (4) \npost-processing,\
    \ summarizing feature extraction results of all target images and exporting as\
    \ “.xls” file.\nRoot zone water status discrimination model development. \nThe\
    \ development of root zone water \nstatus discrimination was consisted of three\
    \ steps: (1) data preprocessing, organizing data for phenotypic analysis \nand\
    \ model development; (2) phenotypic traits screening, removing those phenotypic\
    \ traits with insignificant \nFigure 6. Pakchoi seedling appearance at five growing\

    \ between treatments of root zone moisture level; (3) model development, using\
    \ different modeling algo-\nrithms to classify root zone water status. MetaboAnalyst\
    \ statistical analysis module (http://www.metaboanalyst.\nca) was implemented\
    \ for data preprocessing and phenotypic traits screening, and R language (windows,\
    \ R3.2.5, R \ncore Team, 2016) was implemented for model development.\nData preprocessing.\
    \ \nIn MetaboAnalyst statistical analysis module, data of extracted phenotypic\
    \ traits from \neach image were organized into one datasheet by sample ID (row)\
    \ and phenotypic traits (column). Empty rows \nwere detected and excluded after\
    \ data uploaded. Columns with more than 50% empty records were removed. In \n\
    the case of columns with data missing but less than 50%, the NAs (not available\
    \ values) were replaced by with \na small value (half of the minimum positive\
    \ values in the original data). All the traits value were normalized by \nusing\
    \ auto scaling method (mean-centered and divided by the standard deviation of\
    \ each variable).\nPhenotypic traits screening. \nAmong those phenotypic traits\
    \ extracted by imaging processing, traits which \nare insignificantly relevant\
    \ to treatments may influence the modeling accuracy. In this study, one-way Analysis\
    \ \nof Variance (ANOVA) was applied to screen traits resulting an optimal set\
    \ of explanatory variables for discrim-\nination model development. Traits with\
    \ P > 0.05 (Fisher’s LSD method) were excluded from the traits set. In \naddition,\
    \ the result of ANOVA presented a preliminary overview of the significance of\
    \ each trait to treatments.\nIn order to assess the potentiality of using phenotypic\
    \ traits to develop discrimination model, Partial Least \nSquares Discriminant\
    \ Analysis (PLS-DA) was applied, which is a supervised algorithm that uses multivariate\
    \ \nregression techniques to predict class membership via linear combination of\
    \ original variables. The PLS-DA was \nperformed by using plsr function in pls\
    \ package of R language, and the classification and cross-validation were \nperformed\
    \ by using the corresponding wrapper function in caret package of R language.\
    \ The resulted PLS-DA \nthree-dimensional component score plot, which shows the\
    \ overall data distribution of different treatments, pre-\nsents the preliminary\
    \ classification indicating modeling potentiality.\nDiscrimination model development.\
    \ \nBased on the purpose of multi-classification in this study, three \nclassification\
    \ modeling algorithms, Random Forests (RF), Neural Network (NN), and Support Vector\
    \ Machine \n(SVM) were selected to develop discrimination model and performed\
    \ with the randomForest, nnet, e1071 pack-\nages in R language, respectively.\n\
    RF was used as a supervised learning algorithm suitable for the case of high dimensional\
    \ data analysis. The RF \ncan handle multiple input variables from large databases\
    \ without variable selection and give estimates of impor-\ntant variables in the\
    \ classification25. RF modeling was performed by using the randomForest package.\
    \ Ntree (the \nnumber of trees) and mtry (the number of features) used to find\
    \ the best feature were required in RF. In this study \nthe RF model was trained\
    \ with ntree as 500 and mtry from 2, 5, and 8.\nNeural network have been successful\
    \ as predictive tools in variety domains such as uncovering \ngenotype-phenotype\
    \ interactions26. Researchers reported that properly trained deep neural networks\

    \ model, and disentangle latent factors for phenotyping27. For NN model in this\
    \ study, nnet package was \nused to train the single-hidden-layer feed-forward\
    \ neural network. There are two main parameters, decay and \nsize, which can be\
    \ tuned for NN model in R. In this study, the decay were tuned from 0, 0.1, and\
    \ 0.001, and the \nsize were tuned from 2, 5, and 9.\nThe goal of a SVM is to\
    \ create a boundary, called hyperplane, which leads to homogeneous partitions\
    \ of data \non either side. In this study, multiclass SVM model were trained with\
    \ kernel parameter C (from 10, 100, and \n1000) and regularization parameter gamma\
    \ (from 0.001, 0.01, 0.1, and 0). The best combination of C and gamma \nleading\
    \ to the highest prediction accuracy was chosen. For SVM, svm function in e1071\
    \ package was used to \nspecify the kernel function, cost, and the gamma function.\n\
    The 80% of total samples were selected as the training dastaset via stratified\
    \ random sampling method for \nmodel development and optimization and the rest\
    \ 20% as the test dataset. In order to prevent the over fitting \nproblems, all\
    \ three models were trained with the 10-fold cross validation in three repetitions\
    \ by using the caret \npackage in R language. This method randomly splits the\
    \ dataset in 10 subsets, among which 9 instances of the \ndata were used to train\
    \ the model and the other instance was used to validate the training model. By\
    \ performing \nthree repeats of the 10-fold validation, the average accuracy (percentage\
    \ of correctly classified samples out of all \nsamples) was used to assess the\
    \ performance of the model. However, only accuracy is not enough to evaluate the\
    \ \nmodel performance especially for imbalance data or multi class data. Therefore,\
    \ Cohen’s Kappa coefficient (k) and \nROC (Receiver operating characteristic)\
    \ curve were also used to evaluate the model performance. The k is a good \nmeasure\
    \ that can handle multi-class well and calculated as:\n=\n−\n−\np\np\np\nk\n1\n\
    o\ne\ne\nwhere, po is the observed agreement, and pe is the expected agreement.\
    \ The ROC curves of different models were \ncompared according to the area under\
    \ the curve (AUC) by plotting the true positive rate against the false positive\
    \ \nrate. AUC represents the probability that the classifier will assign a higher\
    \ score to a randomly chosen positive \nexample than to negative example28.\n\

  explanation: This study presents a system that uses real-time data from sensors
    and weather forecasts to predict soil moisture for automated irrigation management.
    The system combines supervised and unsupervised machine learning algorithms to
    develop a hybrid algorithm, Soil Moisture Prediction Hybrid Algorithm (SMPHA),
    which uses regression algorithms and k-means clustering to predict changes in
    soil moisture due to weather conditions. The authors evaluate various machine
    learning algorithms and find that XGBoost + k-means outperforms other combinations,
    and thus, deploy it in their proposed edge-based irrigation system. The edge-based
    system uses Raspberry Pi as an edge server to process data and control actuators,
    and it communicates with cloud services to download trained models and store data.
    The authors evaluate the performance of their system in terms of response time,
    latency, throughput, bandwidth, and resource utilization and find that the edge-based
    system outperforms the cloud-based system in all metrics. They also demonstrate
    that the SMPHA model effectively predicts soil moisture, leading to more efficient
    irrigation scheduling.

    (XB + k-means), is applied in irrigation planning module on account of aforementioned
    performance metrices of ML.
  extract_2: XB + k-means-based hybrid machine learning algorithm is applied in irrigation
    planning module on account of aforementioned performance metrices of ML. Although
    it performs moderately in terms of execution time and power usage, it is selected
    for the deployment in edge computing as it has better performed in terms of accuracy,
    R2, MSE, and MAPE metrices.

    Abstract: Precision agriculture is a breakthrough in digital farming technology,
    which facilitates the appli-

    cation of precise and exact amount of input level of water and fertilizer to the
    crop at the required time for

    increasing the yield. Since agriculture relies on direct rainfall than irrigation
    and the prediction of rainfall

    date is easily available from web source, the integration of rainfall prediction
    with precision agriculture

    helps to regulate the water consumption in farms. In this work, an edge computing
    model is developed for

    predicting soil moisture in real time and managing the water usage in accordance
    with rain prediction. A

    soil moisture prediction hybrid algorithm (SMPHA) has been developed that revolves
    around the decision-

    making techniques with live environmental parameters including weather parameters
    for the prediction of

    soil moisture through the impact of precipitation. Numerous algorithms with the
    combination of regression

    + clustering are estimated, and it is inferred that XGBoost + k-means outperforms
    other algorithmic com-

    binations that is deployed in edge model. This model is used as an intermediary
    between the end IoT

    devices and cloud that results in the saving of computationally intensive processing
    performed on cloud

    servers. The servers located on a local edge network perform the developed algorithmic
    computations.

    Avoiding transmission over the cloud results in signiﬁcant latency, response time,
    and computation power

    savings and therefore increases the eﬃciency of data transfer. The proposed edge
    computing model is

    implemented in Raspberry Pi as an edge, Heroku as cloud, and edge nodes as the
    combination of Pi with

    actuators and sensors. The monitored data from Pi are stored in MongoDB webserver
    that is controlled by

    Web dashboard. Finally, the developed model is implemented in cloud and edge where
    the edge server

    implementation performs better in terms of latency, bandwidth, throughput, response
    time, and CPU

    memory usage.

    1 Introduction

    It is evident that agriculture always has a specialized role in the anthrophonic
    evolution and has been

    serving as an important economic factor for the growth of a country [1]. Around
    58% of the population

    depend on agriculture as the chief source of livelihood in India. The quality
    and productivity of agricultural

    products have declined over these years as several factors have inﬂuenced the
    crop productivity both

    directly and indirectly. Some major factors that aﬀect the crop production are
    climatic changes, global

    warming, and water scarcity [2]. The agricultural land’s productivity is aﬀected

    changes in climate [3,4]. The crop growth has been already aﬀected by the changes
    in climate incurred by

    global warming. The nutrition quality of soil, ground water level, sea, and ocean
    are aﬀected by the

    modiﬁcations in average temperature, rainfall, and extreme weather conditions
    such as hail storms, dust

    storms, heatwaves, etc. due to global warming [5,6]. Degradation of soil is primarily
    created by various

    methods including 93.7% by water erosion, 9.5% by wind erosion, 5.9% by salinity
    and alkalinity, etc.

    Further changes in climate would inﬂuence adversely the crop production [7]. Since
    water is an indispen-

    sable requirement for plants and cultivation, the high level of soil is eroded
    and thereby the fertility is also

    declined. Due to the ever-changing climate, water scarcity has become a huge problem.
    Drought-like

    conditions is already formed in several areas and thereby the present and conventional
    farming practices

    are not suitable. New and unique environment preserving techniques are the need
    of the hour [8].

    The conventional approaches in agriculture are enhanced by the advent of several
    advancements in

    technology [9]. These new improved methodologies ensure optimized utilization
    of resources, accurate

    forecast of water needs and environmental parameters, reduction of human intervention,
    etc. [10]. Conse-

    quently, the outcomes of crops in terms of yield and quality are higher with cost-eﬀective
    methods. One

    such booming technology is the Internet of things (IoT) [11].

    IoT is the collection of components embedded in the sensor for measuring and transferring
    data via

    network devices as sensed from pumps and tractors to weather stations. Primarily,
    IoT deals with the

    transmission and reception of data related to farms through devices using the
    Internet for prediction

    and providing decisions to the farmers. IoT-based methodologies has brought a
    changeover in agricultural

    patterns and farming approaches [12]. IoT devices can gather information about
    soil moisture, chemical

    properties, dam levels, livestock health, and weather details in real time. The
    information acquired from IoT

    devices facilitates the farmers in tracking farms periodically. Farmers can save
    time and money by

    responding faster to farm conditions. Cloud computing models integrated with on-ﬁeld
    agricultural sensors

    need to be incorporated for tackling the issue of processing huge voluminous data.

    One of the major challenges of IoT is the processing of huge datasets in a sequential
    way. Some of the

    key factors that need to be focused on this process are as follows: information
    about the type and nature of

    data, the way of acquiring the data, etc. The preliminary stage comprises acquiring
    the data and ingesting

    the data to the system. Substantial cognizance of data are achieved as the data
    pass through all the

    gateways where it is cleansed and transformed before entering into the system.
    In the near future, dynamic

    prediction of soil moisture and precipitation techniques are to be developed for
    smart irrigation systems.

    Therefore, a system is developed for eﬃcient and optimal utilization of fresh
    water in irrigation along with

    drip irrigation system. It aids in ﬁnding which one of the plants fails to get
    suﬃcient water. When the water

    supply is provided the next day, this delay should not disturb the system. It
    becomes important for the

    farmers to understand the optimal usage of water and fertilizers to bring out
    sustenance in the agricultural

    industry. Therefore, processing must be done for analyzing the data, so that patterns
    can be analyzed and

    planning can be done for the long term, accordingly. Hence, it gives a broad vision
    in deciding where the

    processing is to be done exactly. Therefore, it is obvious that not all data are
    crucial, and it provides a clear

    view of which data need to be stored, discarded, and retained for both long-term
    and short-term purposes.

    Thus, all these challenging issues require to be addressed and that is where storage
    technologies are

    actually highlighted. The poor quality of Internet access in developing nations
    makes the implementation

    quite challenging. An applicable solution to solve this problem is through edge
    computing where the

    essential data could be oﬄoaded from the cloud over the edge of the cloud, and
    this is the exact point

    where the approach of smart sensing with edge computing gets in.

    With the purpose of broadening the potential of edge computing and using it in
    the agriculture domain,

    a novel approach using machine learning (ML) methods is proposed for analyzing
    the data acquired by the

    IoT devices deployed at the farm. Here, the data acquired from IoT components
    undergo preprocessing and

    ML models on the edge nodes to analyze and assess the appropriate results for
    providing the best instruc-

    tions for controlling the actuators (e.g., light, pumps at diﬀerent locations)
    in the farms.

    This article presents an automated system, as shown in Figure 1, to predict the
    soil moisture using the

    ﬁeld information acquired from the self-designed sensor node deployed at the ﬁeld
    and the forecast

    information of weather via Internet. A unique algorithm has been developed that
    revolves around the

    IoT-enabled edge computing model for smart irrigation system

    

    633

    machine learning techniques for the prediction of soil moisture. Here, many algorithms
    with the combina-

    tion of regression + clustering was estimated, and it is inferred that XGBoost
    + k-means outperforms other

    algorithmic combinations, and therefore, it is deployed for the prediction of
    soil moisture in the proposed

    work. The proposed algorithm makes eﬀective irrigation decisions with optimized
    usage of water in a more

    accurate and reliable manner. The eﬀective decision-making refers to the process
    of predicting the rainfall,

    thereby reducing the water usage in advance by the proposed algorithm in accordance
    with the predicted

    rainy days. Through this automatic decision-making, over watering is avoided by
    saving the soil. The

    server-side software is developed with node-side connectivity using the information
    for visualization and

    decision support features. This proposed algorithm is implemented in edge to prove
    the eﬃciency of the

    edge server handling the automated system better than the cloud control. The performance
    of the decen-

    tralized edge-based architecture has been evaluated for downloading the hybrid
    algorithm from cloud in

    real time execution. The performance can be enhanced by adopting edge computing
    architecture and

    measured with the help of network parameters like latency, bandwidth, and response
    time. Edge computing

    capacity is also estimated using the CPU processor and memory consumption while
    executing the proposed

    algorithm with irrigation scheduling.

    2 Related work

    In ref. [13], a smart irrigation system not aﬀected by communication disconnection
    and delay is developed

    using edge nodes deployed at the farms. Environmental parameters have an intricate
    impact on the plant

    growth. It becomes necessary for evaluating multiple AI models simultaneously
    in an actual cultivation

    environment for comparing AI models under the same conditions. Due to the working
    of existing irrigation

    systems on the cloud, communication is instable in the concurrent evaluation of
    AI models. However, the

    instability does not induce an edge node in its performance.

    The factors such as type of plant, soil, climate, humidity, temperature, and soil
    moisture need to be

    considered for the irrigation system packed with potential smart decisions. The
    nature and type of plant,

    soil, and climate are queried by ontology (branch of metaphysics dealing with
    the nature of being), whereas

    other factors such as temperature, humidity, and soil moisture are sensed by the
    sensor network. The

    trained ML model predicts the watering decisions based on ontology and other factors
    as mentioned earlier.

    Smart irrigation has three modules: (i) sensor network modules that sense the
    parameters impacting the water

    requirement by using sensors DHT22, light sensor BH1750, and HL-69 hygrometer
    for sensing the temperature,

    soil moisture, light, and humidity in air. (ii) Edge and IoT server’s module to
    send and receive data through

    HTTP requests. (iii) Training module in which KNN is applied on the sample dataset
    for training and decision-

    making regarding the water needs. Based on the input values, the trained model
    categorizes the input into ﬁve

    possible classes: highly not needed, not needed, average, needed, and highly needed
    [14].

    A decentralized smart irrigation approach is proposed for strawberry greenhouses
    in contrast to con-

    ventional cloud-based solutions for keeping the agricultural data at the edge
    of the network. A full-scale

    smart irrigation system in an actual strawberry greenhouse environment is developed
    after a small-scale

    smart irrigation networking prototype system and a reference architecture targeting
    edge data distribution

    for strawberry greenhouse applications are framed. A three-step industrial approach
    is formed for

    designing, implementing, and validating a solution for smart strawberry irrigation
    in greenhouses and

    keeping the corresponding data at the edge of the network at the same time: (i)
    A small-scale smart

    irrigation prototype solution with oﬀ-the-shelf hardware and software equipment
    is tested and evaluated

    on various types of plants for gaining useful insights for deployments on a large
    scale. (ii) A reference

    network architecture is designed for targeting smart irrigation and edge data
    distribution speciﬁcally for

    strawberry greenhouses. (iii) A large-scale system in an actual strawberry greenhouse
    environment is

    developed in Greece, incorporating the proposed reference architecture [15].

    Edge computing is proposed for addressing the issues by taking advantage of computing
    resources in

    the edge of the network. The issues such as an edge mobile device make it easier
    to achieve low end-to-end

    latency, high bandwidth, and low jitter to services located on the edge network.
    An edge can enforce the

    privacy policies of its owner prior to the release of the data to the cloud through
    edge analytics. If a cloud

    service becomes unavailable due to network failure, cloud failure, or a denial-of-service
    attack, a fallback

    service on a nearby edge can temporarily mask the failure. Cloud services, partial
    analysis, and control

    functions are extended to the edge nodes from the cloud data center. Edge nodes
    facilitate the timely

    monitoring of sensors in smart farming by the reduced latency and enhanced data
    transmission. Due to

    these factors, edge computing is applied through farming [16,17]. A three-tier
    open-source software plat-

    form we proposed by authors, and the platform enhanced the precision agriculture
    by introducing edge

    computing and fog computing. An network functions virtualization (NFV)-based approach
    is deployed for

    performing the local operational decisions at the edge level for mitigating the
    inﬂuence of network failures

    while using cloud data centers [18]. For control processing in smart farming,
    a platform enabling cost-

    eﬀective sensor/actuator network based on IoT, utilizes edge computing [19,20].

    The authors in ref. [21] predicted the soil moisture using a mathematical model
    that measures the

    values given by a sensor matrix on the ground. Due to the huge interval in measurements
    (10 minutes), the

    model presented estimated error by more than 10%. This methodology has incorporated
    the online

    approach by making the sensors to send data every minute to edge devices without
    time-based interruption.

    The authors of ref. [22] applied a combinative approach of using ﬁeld sensor network’s
    data along with

    weather forecast station’s data for the management of optimality in water conditions
    for the enhanced

    growth of grapes. The generated data are forwarded to a web server, which displays
    graphics without

    statistical analysis of such data. The analysis must be performed a posteriori
    by the user.

    The watering mechanism for a plant via IoT methodology is devised by the proposed
    smart irrigation

    model without acquiring any pre-processed data. A prototype application is developed,
    which gets adapted

    to the parameters needed in irrigation after a couple of human-made irrigations.
    With the usage of various

    ML algorithms, several tests are devised for manual and automated irrigations
    for the performance evalua-

    tion. After the evaluation using four diﬀerent ML algorithms such as logistic
    regression (LR), K-nearest

    neighbors (KNN), Gaussian naive Bayes (GNB), and gradient boosting regression
    trees (GBRT), it is found

    that GBRT outperforms other algorithms. To analyze the overall performance, a
    test bed for the sensor edge,

    mobile client, and the decision service on the cloud is established. Two diﬀerent
    indoor species are selected

    as test items for the prototype, namely, Peace lily and Sardinia. The outcomes
    were quite good, and it is

    inferred that the prototype has learned the patterns of irrigation and making
    decisions automatically with a

    high rate of accuracy [23].

    The authors from ref. [24] adopted the deep learning methodology for detecting
    the type and the

    category of the plant using an automated plant irrigation system. The water necessity
    of the plant is

    determined using the recognition of predeﬁned set of plant images and data set
    acquired from farm. It

    utilizes the database for fetching the irrigation information after the recognition
    process is completed.

    Modeling the training processes are time consuming as voluminous set of images
    needs to be stored.

    The authors in refs [25,26] incorporated ML methods in the irrigation decision
    support model using a

    pre-processed irrigation data set. A model is developed for learning the irrigation
    needs of any plants

    progressively rather than using a readily available dataset. Several ML algorithms
    are evaluated with their

    precision for concluding the irrigation decisions. Manual irrigations are performed
    two times before making

    precise decisions. Due to the dynamicity in model, data processing is done progressively,
    and it can be

    applied to several plants having varying irrigation conditions. There is a need
    for the learning model that

    can be trained by itself using a comparatively lighter learning process using
    environmental parameters that

    do not need larger storage in the system but need higher computation. From the
    aforementioned survey for

    making a precise decision with instant computation locally, edge computing needs
    to be integrated into the

    irrigation system. This article is directed towards presenting a platform that
    implies IoTs and edge com-

    puting in monitoring soil moisture via sensors, data communication between sensors
    and edge devices, and

    an Analytics-as-a-Service cloud. It analyzes the collected data in the form of
    a density map of soil moisture

    for denoting the areas in need of greater or lesser frequency of irrigation. Here,
    density map does not refer to

    the geographical point data by satellite mapping, and it actually denotes the
    point of dry area and watery

    area through soil moisture detection point. This point is averaged among areas
    of irrigation to be done and

    the irrigation process is controlled with prediction of rainfall using the proposed
    system.

    3 The proposed system

    The proposed learning model for irrigation is implemented in a prototype IoT system
    that has four compo-

    nents: (i) Edge node layer – This layer consists of sensors, actuator, and two
    microcontrollers. In this layer,

    edge node acquires the sensor data from the surroundings and controls the actuator
    for actuating water

    pumps to start irrigation. (ii) Edge server layer – This layer consists of Raspberry
    Pi that act as edge server

    and capable of multitask processing. Here, edge server controls the edge nodes
    for sending signal and

    receiving data at regular interval of time. It is also connected to the cloud
    server for receiving developed and

    trained machine learning model to be deployed and make irrigation decision for
    controlling edge nodes.

    (iii) Edge service layer – This layer is deployed in the edge server and it is
    responsible for controlling the

    whole system through a developed web dashboard. The dashboard has live feed data,
    control of edge

    nodes, and cloud services access. This service layer also has the control access
    of the proposed machine

    learning model. (iv) Cloud server layer – This layer composed of cloud services
    and cloud storage where its

    role is to train the machine learning model and store the data in database. It
    sends the trained proposed

    model to the edge server for decision-making regarding irrigation scheduling.
    The comprehensive inter-

    connections in the system are shown in Figure 2. The proposed IoT-based smart
    irrigation system includes

    ﬁve major components: ﬁeld deployed module, Web-based interface, Web API weather
    input, soil moisture

    prediction mechanism, and edge communication model.

    3.1 Field deployed module

    In the ﬁeld requirements, a wireless sensor network of the sensor nodes needs
    to be deployed as shown in

    Figure 3. Here, ﬁeld data collection device accommodates four diﬀerent sensors:
    Capacitive Soil Moisture

    Sensor V2.0, DS18B20 Water Proof Temperature Sensor Probe for soil temperature,
    ultraviolet (UV) Light

    Radiation, DHT11 – Temperature and Humidity Sensor Module, and GYML8511 Analog
    Output Ultra-Violet

    Light Sensor Module. An Arduino Mega connected to Raspberry Pi 4 Model-B read,
    the output of these

    sensors where the program is developed in Python for the Pi model to fetch the
    hourly data from sensors

    and store the data in MongoDB [27] database. It is then synchronized with the
    server database using the

    developed web service. A Wi-Fi-enabled Arduino controls the water pump connected
    to a relay switch.

    Figure 2: Components of the proposed system.

    Figure 3: Real-time prototype of the proposed edge model.

    IoT-enabled edge computing model for smart irrigation system

    

    637

    For the real time monitoring, a trigger is made for controlling the web service
    from the responsive web-

    based interface. The irrigation decisions are checked periodically by the proposed
    model performed in the

    server. The water pump is actuated, and irrigation process is started only if
    the server makes any irrigation

    decision. A wireless sensor network (WSN) [28] scenario with ZigBee [29] technology
    can be implemented

    for a large farming area in which several sensor nodes can be aﬃxed in the speciﬁed
    area and every sensor

    node possesses sensors similar to a standalone device. Then, the Arduino Mega
    reads the sensor output

    connected to ZigBee for transferring data to Gateway Node for aggregating the
    received data and storing it

    in MongoDB locally and also for transferring the data via web service to the edge
    server.

    3.2 Web-based interface

    The proposed framework consists of a web-based application to allow farmers visualize
    the growing data

    and interacting with the garden in real time. In addition, users can also be able
    to examine and analyze the

    historical growing data, if needed, through functionalities such as irrigation
    control, motor control predic-

    tion model deployment, and manual data entry implemented in this web application.
    Here, Node.js was

    chosen for developing the web application [30,31], while MongoDB [27] was utilized
    as the database system.

    Data stored in the database, which is deployed in the cloud, will be used for
    further data analysis in the

    future. The web application’s functions are designed following a software design
    pattern called model-

    view-controller (MVC) as shown in Figure 4. In the frontend, ChartJS is used to
    represent data through

    dynamic charts. The web application is also used as an interface to manage all
    the physical devices/

    actuators in the garden. To deploy the web-server to the cloud, a cloud platform
    as a service (PaaS), namely,

    Heroku, had been utilized. Heroku is a cloud platform that provides platform as
    a service (PaaS), facilitates

    the creation of applications and deploying these online rapidly [32,33]. It also
    enhances scalability and

    functionality by integrating several add-on services. The ﬁeld data are sent to
    the server by Raspberry Pi

    using this web service. This web service manages the network outage/ﬂuctuation
    during data synchroniza-

    tion from the ﬁeld device to the server by taking the help of ﬂag settings at
    the database level. The interface

    facilitates the scheduling of irrigation along with visualizing real time sensors
    and predicted soil moisture

    for upcoming days and precipitation information. By using the denoted threshold
    value of soil moisture

    suggested by agronomists, the irrigation can be scheduled by the user. The system
    maintains the threshold

    value depending on the predicted pattern of soil moisture and precipitation information.
    The process of

    irrigation is initiated automatically and stopped after the speciﬁed threshold
    value generated from the

    proposed algorithm of soil moisture when it is reached.

    3.3 Web API weather input

    The weather prediction data are collected by a web service developed in Python.
    The forecast data such as

    humidity, temperature, ultra violet index, precipitation, and cloudiness of web
    forecasting portals like

    Open Weather API are aggregated by the developed web service [34]. These portals
    provide the forecasted

    information in HTML, XML, or JSON format. The predicted data with JSON format
    are read by the developed

    web and stored in database at the edge server, which is concerned in the prediction
    algorithm. Also, these

    data are utilized as testing dataset in the ML model for predicting the soil moisture.

    3.4 Soil moisture prediction mechanism

    An algorithm for predicting the soil moisture based on data derived from ﬁeld
    sensors and weather fore-

    casting using the combination of supervised and unsupervised machine learning
    techniques has been

    developed underpinned by regression algorithms and k-means clustering for estimating
    the diﬀerence/

    change in soil moisture owing to weather conditions. Many regression algorithms
    are compared against

    each other and infusing each of them with k-means to check the preciseness in
    mean square error (MSE),

    R2, accuracy and mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) for prediction of soil
    moisture of upcoming days

    with the help of sensor data and weather forecasting days. The information about
    soil moisture for the

    upcoming days and suggestions for irrigation in accordance with the prescribed
    levels of soil moisture and

    predicted precipitation values, thereby saving energy and water, is presented
    by the algorithm. The infor-

    mation generated from the device and the predicted values from the algorithm soil
    moisture prediction

    hybrid algorithm (SMPHA) are stored in the server.

    3.5 Edge communication model

    The communication protocols in the proposed framework are ﬂexible and transparent
    in nature for

    accepting both wired and wireless methodologies. For the maximum utilization of
    potentiality in edge

    computing components, the communication among various components in the edge-IoT
    system requires

    intense probing by using the versatility among the devices in network edges. For
    transferring the data

    gathered from pivot sensors, a communication technology such as Zigbee [35] is
    needed for the irrigation

    systems. Therefore, the communication component in the proposed work is classiﬁed
    into three main areas

    as shown in Figure 5. The Message Query Telemetry Transport (MQTT) protocol is
    used for the

    Figure 5: Proposed edge communication model.

    IoT-enabled edge computing model for smart irrigation system

    

    639

    communication in the proposed system. The analysis in ref. [36] presented seven
    IoT messaging protocols

    (MQTT, CoAP, XMPP, AMQP, DDS, REST-HTTP, and WebSocket) as communication protocols
    that play a

    major role in smart farming. The authors have concluded that MQTT proved to be
    the most secure protocol

    after probing all the protocols with respect to latency, energy and bandwidth
    requirements, throughput,

    reliability, and security. Moreover, MQTT is secure in both end-to-end architecture
    and gateway server

    architecture. In an MQTT setup, a MQTT server termed as MQTT broker executes on
    the IoT solution [37].

    Under a common identiﬁer, a “publisher” and a “subscriber” link among themselves
    to this broker. In the

    IoT solution, publishers and subscribers are the IoT devices and IoT hubs or control
    devices, respectively.

    When the publishers have new data for recording, the data are published to the
    broker. The broker then

    ﬂags that it has new publisher data, and the corresponding data are read by the
    subscriber. Then, the

    subscriber analyzes the data and reacts accordingly.

    The ﬁrst level accomplishes with connecting the end users to system with the help
    of mobile or web-

    based applications through the Internet. The next level (cloud computing server)
    deals with the connection

    of web server and MQTT broker for directing the user requests and other components
    at the edge landscape

    or from the farms to the right cloud-based services like displaying the real time
    status of the farm for the

    users, triggering a new deployment of the updated ML model to the corresponding
    edge node. The third

    level (farming area) is directed toward the deployment of sensors and IoT devices
    (actuators) for commu-

    nicating with other components in the entire system.

    4 Deployment of soil moisture prediction hybrid algorithm

    The watering mechanism of the plant has diﬀerent approaches in the proposed model.
    Primarily, the system

    is trained with manual irrigations datasets during the process of learning with
    respect to suggestions

    deﬁned by agronomists. The model is trained to learn the needs of irrigation in
    the ﬁrst level of deployment

    in cloud without the inclusion of pre-processed data. After acquiring the required
    data and training, the

    proposed system is initiated to grasp the plant’s watering needs by undergoing
    plenty of manual irrigations.

    Thereafter, manual irrigation is not required and the system makes automated decisions
    in watering using

    the gathered data and the application of ML methods. The proposed model then decides
    the irrigation

    strategies automatically using ML methods without the need including collected
    datasets in the automatic

    irrigation process. The proposed model can be improved through the learning process
    when the number of

    precise irrigation inputs is provided to the model at each stage of training.

    The decision-making procedure is developed with two modules for irrigation strategies
    according to the

    soil moisture prediction for upcoming days. The ﬁrst module deals with training
    the model in cloud with

    manual irrigation datasets through steps such as data collection, data preprocessing,
    training, and model

    development. The system acquires values of air temperature (TH), soil temperature
    (SMT), soil moisture

    (SM), humidity (HU), and ultraviolet rays (UV) periodically from the physical
    environment in the data

    collection stage, which is essentially required for arriving at the watering decisions.
    Also, the time of

    performing the manual irrigation is recorded in the database. These data are timestamped
    and stored in

    as datasets to aid in making decisions for knowing the time of irrigation. In
    the next step of pre-processing,

    inconsistencies are eliminated and outliers caused by sensor errors are detected
    from the irrigation dataset,

    thereby helping in the removal of broken data. The training stage involves the
    application of supervised

    machine learning (ML) algorithms. Here the regression algorithms such as support
    vector regression (SVR),

    multiple linear regression (MLR), lasso regression (LR), decision tree regressor
    (DTR), random forest

    regressor (RF), and XG-boost regressor (XB) techniques are used for the deployment.
    The regression algo-

    rithms are trained using the collected datasets. Finally, through training, regression
    models are created,

    namely, SVR model, MLR model, LR model, DTR model, RF model, and XB model that
    are been combined

    with the second module for decision-making.

    The second module caters to the prediction of irrigation for upcoming days by
    infusing the weather data

    as an input to the regression trained models. The live datasets from the weather
    API for future prediction of

    soil moisture variable are used. The dependent variables from weather forecast
    data like temperature (TH),

    humidity (HU), ultraviolet (UV), and precipitation (PC) are tested in the aforementioned
    model for soil

    moisture prediction. Then, the regression trained model is evaluated and deployed
    using the weather

    testing data for the prediction of soil moisture in accordance with the precipitation.
    After the prediction

    of data for the upcoming days, these developed regression models are combined
    with unsupervised ML

    algorithm named k-means clustering for estimating the changes incurred in soil
    moisture prediction due to

    the impact of weather conditions. Further, each regression models with k-means
    algorithm are evaluated

    for performances in terms of irrigation decision-making process as shown in Table
    1. The combined algo-

    rithms are estimated through MAPE, MSE, R2, execution speed, power consumption,
    and accuracy. The

    estimation and computation of these parameters are detailed by the authors in
    ref. [38].

    XGBoost + k-means (XB+k-means) approach provides more accuracy with less MSE comparatively
    and

    also the R2 with 98% in soil moisture prediction using combined approach is given
    in Table 1. It is evident

    that the proposed combination performs better when compared to other regression
    + k-means-based

    approaches. XB + k-means-based hybrid machine learning algorithm is applied in
    irrigation planning

    module on account of aforementioned performance metrices of ML. Although it performs
    moderately in

    terms of execution time and power usage, it is selected for the deployment in
    edge computing as it has

    better performed in terms of accuracy, R2, MSE, and MAPE metrices. It is observed
    that the prediction of soil

    moisture for the upcoming days from the proposed algorithm (XB+k-means) is nearer
    to the actual value as

    shown in Table 2, and hence, XB+k-means is selected for the implementation of
    SMPHA in edge-based

    irrigation scheduling.

    4.1 Hardware setup

    IoT system is crucial to handle, collect, and transfer the data to the computing
    nodes at the edge or in the

    cloud. These devices are connected to the edge nodes through wireless communication
    protocols like

    ZigBee. It is used in reducing the latency and loss of data. An Arduino micro-control
    unit controls the

    combined IoT sensors and actuators at the same part of a ﬁeld into a cluster,
    each connected to a Raspberry

    Pi that acts as an edge node in processing the gathered data and controlling the
    actuators. For example,

    Figure 2 shows an edge architecture with a Raspberry Pi connected to two components:
    Arduino Uno and

    Arduino Mega units via ZigBee connection. The ﬁrst Arduino Mega node is responsible
    for collecting data

    from sensors and the second one is for controlling the actuators in the ﬁeld.
    Depending on the sensor type

    with collecting Arduino unit, the sensors are connected via analog or digital
    PWM pins while controlling

    Arduino uno joins with actuators in the ﬁeld and controls (turn on/oﬀ) them in
    accordance with upper

    layers (from the edge web server). The trained (cloud) and deployed ML model in
    edge nodes provides the

    necessary instructions to the edge nodes.

    4.2 Web layer setup

    The deployment of web server assists the user in planning and managing the irrigation
    system. It visualizes

    the crucial information of factors like temperature of air and soil, UV, humidity,
    and soil moisture in live

    irrigation with real time updates in the form of various charts. In accordance
    with the selected ﬁeld, the web

    application redirects the user to the ﬁeld’s dashboard as shown in Figure 4. The
    dashboard consists of ﬁeld

    parameters as well as control signals for activating all the physical devices/actuators
    at the garden layer.

    These signals are denoted as switch buttons, and each switch controls (turn on/oﬀ)
    a particular kind of

    actuator (for instance, water pump to start and stop the irrigation). The user
    interface facilitates remote

    controlling of the ﬁeld by just clicking on the buttons as shown in Figure 4.

    4.3 Edge layer setup

    The edge node acts as a computing center where incoming data are analyzed and
    fed as the input vector to

    the ML model for processing and to return the control signals for activating or
    deactivating the actuators

    placed at the farm. Edge node processes the physical data (real time) at every
    end device such as the

    collected and processed data via the Raspberry Pi nodes presented in the proposed
    scheme. The prediction

    model is designed using TensorFlow API and trained, tested on Google Colab in
    this work. Amazon Web

    Service (AWS) oﬀers a library named Boto3 having many APIs to upload and download
    objects. After the

    development of model, it is transferred to Amazon S3, a service provided by AWS.
    The edge node utilizes the

    trained model from S3 for analyzing the sensed data acquired from garden’s sensors.
    The decision is

    delivered based on real time data analysis at the edge node and transmitted to
    Arduino nodes in the ﬁelds

    landscape immediately for controlling the actuators. In another ﬂow, the data
    collected from sensors are

    ﬁltered so as to keep only the modiﬁed data at the edge node before being sent
    back for mitigating the

    communication cost to the database in the cloud. These data are used in the updation
    of the ML model to

    enhance its eﬃciency.

    4.4 Analytics setup

    The main goal of this experiment lies in gathering the various physical parameters
    of a farming land via

    sensors and utilizing the fetched data along with weather forecast information
    for developing an algorithm

    using hybrid machine learning approach to infuse higher accuracy in predicting
    the soil moisture for the

    upcoming days. As discussed in Section 4, for the proper planning and provisioning
    of optimal irrigation,

    the algorithm provides a predictable estimate of soil moisture with the assistance
    of various statistical

    measures as shown in Table 1. The measures are adopted for estimating the appropriateness
    and error rate

    of the proposed algorithm. It is inferred from the experiment that, optimal irrigation
    is feasible using a good

    642

    

    S. Premkumar and AN. Sigappi

    estimation (close to the actual value) of the soil moisture (Table 2), with the
    support of ﬁeld data and

    forecast information, thereby utilizing the natural rain eﬃciently.

    The SMPHA ML model is interdependent on dynamic changes in weather environment
    where the

    models deployed on edge nodes need to change the controls accordingly after model
    gets trained con-

    tinuously. For the process of retraining, the trained model needs to be updated.
    The parameters such as TM,

    HU, ST, UV, SM about grown plants are logged for the training purpose, and these
    generated datasets are

    recorded from the already developed manual mode system [39]. The growth of the
    Indian Mundu Chilli [40]

    is taken for the observation from the ﬁrst stage to the last grown stage for 95
    days. While retraining the

    model, the training is carried in cloud without causing eﬀect to the functionalities
    at edge nodes. A signal is

    transferred to the corresponding edge server for triggering the task of updating
    the SMPHA model from the

    web server. At that time, the newly trained model is downloaded to replace the
    existing one at the con-

    sidering edge server. From then, the ML model at the edge server is called to
    be updated with the real-world

    knowledge and is ready for its garden controlling tasks (to apply in the next
    farming season).

    4.5 Work ﬂow

    The ﬂowchart in Figure 6 depicts the working of the proposed system based on the
    decision support system

    that is beneﬁcial for irrigation needed for the growth of vegetables. The chilli
    plant is grown in a growbag

    attached with sensors and Pi as shown in Figure 3 and monitored for 95 days of
    data collection. To bring out

    optimality in the irrigation system, features relating to climate, soil, crop,
    and ﬁeld infrastructure are to be

    considered. To provide several recommendations in the production of vegetables,
    decision support systems

    (DSSs) are designed, which process voluminous information [39]. This proposed
    work is the extension of

    soil moisture diﬀerences (SMD) model [41] developed for soil moisture prediction.
    The threshold values of

    soil moisture are used in the SMD model where the system schedules the irrigation
    date based on the

    predicted soil moisture and weather forecast (precipitation) information automatically
    using SVR+ k-means

    modeling. Therefore, in the extension of the aforementioned work, further more
    number of sensors are used

    to log soil moisture value, which is averaged in the proposed model. This model
    is developed in two

    divisions of ﬂowchart as shown in Figure 7, where both are interconnected. It
    is observed that the prediction

    of XB + k-mean approach provides better results as presented in Table 2.

    The ﬁrst phase of the ﬂowchart describes the hybrid algorithm for the soil moisture
    prediction (SMPHA)

    using the combination of XB + k-means algorithm. During the data collection step,
    the sensor data for the

    parameters, namely, TM, HU, ST, UV, and SM, are collected. During preprocessing,
    null values and outliers

    are removed and the preprocessed data are used to train the XG-Boost model. The
    developed model is then

    trained with variables of live weather features (TM, HU, UV, PC) obtained from
    Weather API for the

    prediction of SM data. These data are given as input to k-means clustering algorithm
    to predict the soil

    moisture, which is deﬁned as SMPHA value to be infused in the next phase of the
    ﬂowchart. The second

    phase of the ﬂowchart deﬁnes the automatic irrigation planning setup. The setup
    starts obtaining the soil

    moisture maximum (SMMax) and soil moisture minimum (SMMin) values in the dashboard
    for setting the

    maximum and minimum level of soil moisture. Then, the current soil moisture (CuSM)
    is sensed and

    compared against the threshold SMMin. If the resulting value is less than SMMin,
    the process proceeds

    with SMPHA. On the contrary, it stops the irrigation process by sending 0 to the
    relay. In SMPHA, the

    nearest precipitation date is selected and it is assigned to the predicted soil
    moisture (PSM). The SMMax is

    decided by ﬁnding the minimum of (PSM + SMMin, SMMax), and the predicted SMMax
    is further checked

    against CuSM with a condition if SMMax is greater the CuSM then it sends 1 to
    the relay as a signal to start

    irrigation. If the condition fails, then it sends 0 to stop irrigation. The process
    of automatic irrigation ends

    by forecasting the irrigation schedule in accordance with the live weather parameters.

    5 Experimental setup and evaluation

    The test bed is developed and deployed, and the data are collected for the analysis
    in irrigation manage-

    ment. Here, Heroku cloud platform is used to deploy the cloud web server. The
    same cloud is also installed

    at a local edge that is at two Raspberry Pi units equipped with Wi-Fi 802.11n
    connections to denote the edge

    nodes. JMeter application is used to get sequential accesses to the web page from
    various users for eval-

    uating the network parameters. The speciﬁcation of these servers is given in Tables
    3 and 4.

    We evaluated the performance of the proposed IoT-based smart farm on two diﬀerent
    platforms,

    namely, in the cloud and on the local computer to show the feasibility and the
    beneﬁt of the edge com-

    puting scheme. Further many parameters are considered for evaluation and discussed
    in the next section to

    show that edge deployment is better than cloud.

    5.1 Evaluation

    A hybrid machine learning methodology is used in evaluating the ﬁrst stage of
    the proposed model. The

    predicted value of the soil moisture is better in terms of their accuracy and
    error rate. From the comparison

    of the other ML algorithms as shown in Table 2, XB + k-means performs better and
    taken further to be

    deployed in edge and cloud to check its eﬃciency with each other. Therefore, for
    analyzing the eﬃciency of

    the edge server in accordance with the proposed hybrid algorithm SMPHA is evaluated
    in terms of the time

    taken to train the ML model in edge and cloud. In this experiment Raspberry Pi
    is used to train the SMPHA

    model with 196,400 rows, that is, input data sample size and takes around 1,710,000
    ms (approximately

    28.5 min). The same model when it is trained in Google Colab cloud environment,
    it takes 204,000 ms

    (approximately 3.4 min) as depicted in Table 5. The main purpose is to run the
    trained model on edge not to

    train the model at edge. So due to the lack of computing capability at the edge,
    it takes more time to train

    the model, but it can be ignored as it does not aﬀect the purpose of the proposed
    model. Here, edge is

    introduced to obtain the task of computing from the cloud (i.e., oﬄoading the
    task) by making the system

    more edge-oriented deployment. It can be accomplished rapidly as it requires only
    14 s to download a

    trained SMPHA model from the cloud to the edge node with a size of 3,101 kb as
    given in Table 5. The time to

    download varies according to the size of the trained model. So, from this process
    it can be inferred that

    downloading the trained model saves time when compared to training the model at
    the edge. Through this

    in real time, deployment of the trained SMPHA model in edge is better compared
    to deployment in cloud

    services. Furthermore, network parameters like latency, throughput, bandwidth,
    and response time are

    adopted to measure the performance improvements in edge computing.

    The performance metrices taken into account are latency, bandwidth, and response
    time [42]. The

    latency of an application is the product of two factors: computing latency and
    transmission latency. The

    time spent on data processing and transmission between end devices to cloud servers
    is termed as com-

    puting latency and transmission latency, respectively. The computational capacity
    of the system decides

    the computing latency as the network servers possess a considerable amount of
    capacity to make the data

    processing faster, whereas the sensors come with limited computing capacity. The
    latency in transmission

    is increased by the end devices and cloud servers. Bandwidth: As large number
    of sensors are deployed in

    IoT, data generated would be huge that consumes an intense range of bandwidth
    and leads to several

    problems such as delay in transmission and loss of packets. It becomes unacceptable
    for the data to be

    transferred directly to cloud servers without applying compression. Therefore,
    data preprocessing and

    aggregation are needed for IoT gateways before redirecting them to remote cloud
    servers. Then, the issue

    to be confronted is to control the traﬃc ﬂow by migrating data processing and
    aggregation tasks optimally

    to decrease the bandwidth needs of the end users while maintaining the data quality.
    Response time: The

    total response time is calculated by adding up transmission and processing time.
    The local deployment of

    the proposed model for controlling IoT-based irrigation are deployed on two modes:
    (i) Cloud mode: The

    developed SMPHA model is implemented in the cloud communicating with IoT sensors
    nodes directly to

    manage the irrigation process. The data are stored and processed at the cloud
    server itself where it uses

    Heroku platform. (ii) Edge mode – Raspberry Pi is deployed as an edge server that
    involves in processing of

    the SMPHA model controlling the IoT sensor nodes. Here, the data are stored and
    processed locally within

    the edge servers. This SMPHA model from both the edge and cloud does the job of
    controlling the actuators

    to initiate and quit the working of water ﬂow motors. Through this deployment
    in both the environments,

    performance of edge server and cloud server can be checked in terms of latency,
    throughput, bandwidth,

    and response time is shown in aforementioned graphs in Figures 6, 8, and 9. This
    performance metrices is

    not feasible to calculate while deploying in real time, so the aforementioned
    scenarios of two modes are

    virtually created by generating many request and response threads between the
    servers. This sampling,

    load test, and distributed testing are conducted through JMeter application [43]
    and also veriﬁed with

    Wireshark [44] in cloud servers. The test scenario is created here by data of
    sending and receiving sampling

    data between cloud to IoT sensors and between Edge to IoT sensors. The sampling
    data considered in this

    work refer to the approximate number of requests generated by Arduino to cloud
    and Arduino to Raspberry

    Pi that are calculated in real time. The test scenario is divided into 10 days
    of sampling data collected for

    each day. The evaluation results are depicted for latency and response times in
    10 days perspective. In

    latency parameter, edge service has decreased by an average of 77.85% time compared
    to the with cloud. In

    the same manner, the response time of edge service is also decreased by 74.09%
    time compared to cloud

    service. In throughput calculation, sampling data are calculated for an hourly
    basis for the 10 hours data in

    a day. From the hourly comparisons of throughput value, edge outperforms with
    67.17% high Mbps usage.

    Through this analysis as shown in Table 6, it is evident that the proposed edge
    computing methodology

    deployed in Raspberry Pi or in local computers outperforms the cloud-oriented
    approach.

    Finally, to illustrate the eﬃciency of resource management in edge computing,
    CPU and memory

    utilization are considered for the analysis as both factors rely on the service
    execution model and the

    computational needs of the services being ﬁred from oﬀ-loaders. Figure 10 depicts
    the utilization of CPU

    and RAM on the Raspberry Pi acting as an edge node in two cases: with and without
    the deployment of

    SMPHA model on it. As shown in Figure 10, the SMPHA model aﬀects the CPU of the
    Raspberry Pi node

    signiﬁcantly as it consumed around 41.2% of the CPU compared to only 3.5% when
    it does not host the

    SMPHA model. However, the memory (RAM) utilization in both the cases (with and
    without deployment of

    an SMPHA model) is nearly the same which is around 31%. Comparatively RAM utilization
    does not have

    much diﬀerence in with and without SMPHA. It is worthwhile to note that, the CPU
    utilization is still much

    lower than the 50% of total CPU capacity in Raspberry Pi. Therefore, it becomes
    feasible for adopting edge

    server implementation in the proposed irrigation system.

    6 Conclusion

    This article proposed a novel approach to edge-based irrigation system to facilitate
    decision-making on

    watering the plants on scheduled time. The proposed approach applying IoT with
    an edge computing

    framework enables the farming system to adapt to the changes in environmental
    conditions automatically

    and eﬃciently. The process of automatic irrigation regulates irrigation according
    to the live weather para-

    meters for forecasting the irrigation process. Soil moisture prediction was performed
    using major regression

    algorithms that are again combined with k-means clustering for estimating the
    changes incurred in soil

    moisture prediction. These techniques were compared through metrics such as MAPE,
    MSE, speed, and

    power consumption from which XB + k-means was found to perform better. The XB
    + k-means algorithm

    was further used for the implementation of decision mechanism on the developed
    edge computing model.

    The proposed edge model saves the data communication cost and reduces the response
    time of IoT services.

    It can be deployed on existing devices on the network edges serving as edge nodes,
    thereby reducing the

    overall implementation cost of a large-scale IoT system. The edge-based approach
    was found to perform

    better than the cloud-based approach in terms of response time, latency, throughput,
    and bandwidth

    usage. Finally, the edge model was analyzed through CPU and memory usage while
    running with and

    without the algorithm. In both cases, the memory utilization is almost lower to
    total available resource of

    the edge device. From this, edge device can allocate its remaining resource for
    other computing services,

    which increases the eﬃciency of edge computing device. The number of end edge
    nodes can be increased

    according to the ﬁeld area and then to check the potency of the system.

    \ food production has become an urgent problem to be solved in\nmost countries.\
    \ At present, using artifcial intelligence technology to improve suitability between\
    \ land and crop varieties to\nincrease crop yields has become a consensus among\
    \ agricultural researchers. However, there are still many problems in existing\n\
    works, such as limited crop phenotypic data and the poor performance of artifcial\
    \ intelligence models. In this regard, we take\nmaize as an example to collect\
    \ a large amount of environmental climate and crop phenotypic traits data at multiple\
    \ experimental\nsites and construct an extensive dataset. Ten, we introduce a\
    \ graph neural network model to learn crop suitability evaluation and\nfnally\
    \ achieve a good evaluation efect. Te evaluation results of the model can not\
    \ only provide a reference for expert evaluation\nbut also judge the suitability\
    \ of the variety to other test trial sites according to the data of the current\
    \ one, so as to guide future\nbreeding experiments.\n1. Introduction\nCrop variety\
    \ suitability evaluation refers to the suitability of crop\nvariety growth for\
    \ corresponding planting land. Soil conditions\nand climatic environments vary\
    \ signifcantlyfrom place to place,\nand the suitability of diferent crop varieties\
    \ difers greatly. Select\nsuitable varieties for planting, and then maximize the\
    \ use of\nlimited land resources to produce more food. Afected by many\nfactors\
    \ such as the outbreak of new coronavirus pneumonia,\nclimate change, and frequent\
    \ natural disasters, the world food\nsecurity situation has become more severe\
    \ in recent years, which\nmay lead to a further increase in the global hunger\
    \ population. In\nthis regard, the world food security situation has become more\n\
    severe in recent years, leading to a further increase in the global\nhunger population,\
    \ so that future crop varieties can be accurately\nplanted on suitable land, to\
    \ improve food production.\nClimate change will continue to afect the whole period\n\
    of crop growth, which has a great impact on the suitability\nevaluation of crop\
    \ varieties. Long-term climate change leads\nto large-scale reallocation of freshwater\
    \ resources resulting\nin changes in crop breeding [1, 2]. Literature [3] points\
    \ out\nthat, due to climate change in the next few years, the total\noutput of\
    \ crops will decline, which is in great contradiction\nwith the growing food demand\
    \ of the global population. To\nalleviate this contradiction, we need to actively\
    \ explore the\nrelationship between climate change and crop variety\nadaptability\
    \ and optimize the utilization of land resources.\nCrop phenotypic traits are\
    \ the intuitive expression of the\nsuitability between crop growth and current\
    \ land, and the\nresult of the interaction between environmental factors such\n\
    as soil and climate and crop varieties. Crop variety selection\nbased on crop\
    \ phenotype was relatively systematic long\nbefore technologies such as DNA and\
    \ molecular markers\nemerged. Even the same crops and genes will produce\ndiferent\
    \ phenotypes in diferent environments. Ultimately,\ncrop harvest is phenotypic\
    \ data, not genome. Terefore,\ndirect research and analysis of crop phenotype\
    \ are the most\nnatural and efective method. However, the biggest problem\nis\
    \ that phenotypic data is not enough to support extensive\ndata analysis.\nHindawi\n\
    Computational Intelligence and Neuroscience\nVolume 2022, Article ID 5614974,\
    \ 10 pages\nhttps://doi.org/10.1155/2022/5614974\nCrop suitability evaluation\
    \ has always been a major\nproblem in agricultural production, but the currently\
    \ used\nevaluation and analysis methods are outdated and have low\nevaluation\
    \ accuracy. Most of the existing methods are based\non traditional machine learning\
    \ methods. Tis method\ntreats each piece of data as an independent sample and\
    \ lacks\nthe exploration of the relationship between the data. Te\nlater introduction\
    \ of deep learning made the model more\npowerful in nonlinear ﬁtting but still\
    \ failed to model higher-\norder correlations between data.\nGiven the the lack\
    \ of variety suitability evaluation\ndataset, we collected crop variety trait\
    \ data and environ-\nmental-climate data from multiple breeding sites in the past\n\
    ﬁve years (2017–2021), with a total of 10,000 records. Each\nrecord includes 15\
    \ of trait data and 24 of climate data, and\nexperts are invited to conduct corresponding\
    \ suitability\nevaluation, and experts are invited to conduct corresponding\n\
    suitability evaluations. Considering the high-order complex\ncorrelation between\
    \ crop phenotypic traits and climate data\n[4–6], we incorporate climate data\
    \ into the learning suit-\nability assessment. Ten, we use the graph neural network\
    \ to\nlearn the association representation between the data, and\nﬁnally achieve\
    \ better evaluation accuracy. Overall, this paper\nmainly includes the following\
    \ three contributions:\n(1) We have collected a large amount of data related to\n\
    cultivar adaptability, alleviating the diﬃculty of the\nscarcity of datasets in\
    \ the current ﬁeld.\n(2) Te graph neural network model is introduced into\nthe\
    \ variety suitability evaluation, and good evalua-\ntion results were obtained.\n\
    (3) Te results of the experiments can provide a refer-\nence for future breeding\
    \ programs and improve\nbreeding eﬃciency.\n2. Related Works\nVariety suitability\
    \ evaluation is a long-term problem, and\nmany works in this ﬁeld have guiding\
    \ signiﬁcance for ag-\nricultural production. Below we brieﬂy introduce some\n\
    representative works.\n2.1. Relevant Works of Variety Suitability Evaluation.\
    \ Te\nauthors of [7] believe that environmental climate and genetic\nfactors jointly\
    \ aﬀect the ﬁnal yield of crops, so the authors\naim to understand the impact\
    \ of climate on agriculture\nthrough methods similar to quantitative genetics,\
    \ and to\nimprove crop yield through selection, manipulation, and\nediting of\
    \ genetic variations. Traditional empirical land\nassessment and soil surveys\
    \ rely on expert explanations.\nTey cannot answer future land use issues, such\
    \ as future\nclimate change, including the availability of water resources,\n\
    and the introduction of new crop hybrids. In this regard, [8]\nexplores the eﬀect\
    \ of limited water availability on the growth\nof various maize hybrids under\
    \ future climatic conditions.\nLiterature [9] is committed to developing an eﬃcient\
    \ ﬁeld\nhigh-throughput phenotypic analysis platform to make\ncrop-related data\
    \ collection more comprehensive and\naccurate. Literature [10] focuses on the\
    \ current and long-\nterm needs of society. Te authors believe that the future\n\
    breeding data will integrate genetic, statistical, and gene-\nphenotypic traits\
    \ to promote our understanding of func-\ntional germplasm diversity and gene-phenotypic-trait\
    \ rela-\ntionships in local and transgenic crops. Literature [11] is\ncommitted\
    \ to exploring ﬁeld climate intelligent crops, using\na large amount of data from\
    \ phenotypic and genomic\ndatasets. Te authors integrate genome and crop phenotypic\n\
    information into speciﬁc databases and intelligent platforms\nand then select\
    \ the appropriate climate environment to\nmake crops adapt to the environment\
    \ and ultimately im-\nprove crop yield.\n2.2. Deep Learning in Agriculture. Agriculture\
    \ is closely\nrelated to people’s daily life, and its importance at the na-\n\
    tional level is self-evident. Given the amazing learning ability\nof deep learning\
    \ and the rapid accumulation of agricultural\ndata, many researchers have begun\
    \ to explore how to use the\ntechnology to guide agricultural production. Below\
    \ we\nbrieﬂy introduce some recent works using deep learning for\nagricultural\
    \ production and then introduce the application\nof graph neural networks in agriculture.\
    \ Te impact of\nweather data on sustainable agricultural production is\nenormous,\
    \ but the complex nonlinear relationship between\ndata makes weather data unpredictable.\
    \ In response,[12]\nproposes a deep learning predictor with a continuous two-\n\
    level decomposition structure, which continuously de-\ncomposes weather data into\
    \ four components and then\ntrains a Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) network as a sub-\n\
    predictor for each component. Literature [13] is dedicated to\nsolving crop management\
    \ problems in agricultural auto-\nmation. Te authors use convolutional neural\
    \ network\ntechnology to identify weeds in the early stages of crop\ngrowth and\
    \ control the side eﬀects of weeds on crop growth,\nthereby improving yields.\
    \ Tey propose AgroAVNET, a\nhybrid model based on AlexNet and VGGNET, with a\n\
    extensive performance improvement compared to existing\nmethods. Literature [14]\
    \ is dedicated to using past agri-\ncultural production data to predict future\
    \ agricultural\nproduction. Te authors propose a deep learning model\nAGR-DL based\
    \ on CNN and RNN. Te experimental results\nshow that the prediction accuracy of\
    \ the model is better than\nthat of classical algorithms such as SVM, MLP, and\
    \ AdaBoost.\nFaced with limited water resources and arable land resources,\nhow\
    \ to maximize the utilization has become the common goal\nof researchers. In this\
    \ regard, [15] proposes an IoT precision\nagriculture intelligent irrigation system\
    \ based on deep\nlearning neural network. It can make arable land smarter by\n\
    using a long short-term memory network to predict the\nprevious day’s volumetric\
    \ soil moisture content and irrigation\ncycle. Te combination of Industry 4.0\
    \ and smart agriculture\nis the future development direction, but IoT devices\
    \ have\nalways faced the potential risk of being attacked. In this\nregard, [16]\
    \ proposes a DDoS attack intrusion detection\nnetwork based on convolutional neural\
    \ network, deep neural\nnetwork, and recurrent neural network, which ensures the\n\
    security of thousands of IoT-based smart devices.\n2\nComputational Intelligence\
    \ and Neuroscience\nLiterature [17] uses graph convolutional neural net-\nworks\
    \ to encode knowledge implicit in the GO hierarchy.\nTe authors propose a DeepGOA\
    \ model to predict protein\nannotations, achieving superior performance to deep\n\
    learning. Literature [18] is dedicated to exploring the eﬀects\nof soil composition\
    \ on vegetation growth, and ultimately to\nrational irrigation scheduling and\
    \ optimization of water\nuse tools. Te authors construct an end-to-end framework,\n\
    using graph neural network to learn time graph structure\nand soil moisture. Literature\
    \ [19] uses a graph-based re-\ncurrent neural network to predict crop yield. Te\
    \ authors\nfurther improve the prediction ability of the model by\nreasonably\
    \ utilizing the knowledge of geography and time,\nwhich is superior to the most\
    \ advanced methods. Literature\n[20] is committed to graph neural networks to\
    \ classify the\nmaturity of avocado. Te authors create a set of alligator\nimage\
    \ data and then use the node classiﬁcation method of\ngraph neural network to\
    \ classify them.\nTe above works have improved the suitability between\ncrops\
    \ and planting sites. However, there are still many\nunsolved problems. For example,\
    \ the dataset collected by [7]\nis small, and the most important crop phenotypic\
    \ data in\nsuitability evaluation is only 6 kinds, which is seriously\ninsuﬃcient.\
    \ In addition, the methods used in most suitability\nevaluation works are outdated,\
    \ and there is much room for\nimprovement.\n3. Data Collection\nAccording to the\
    \ Bureau of Statistics and China Institute of\nCommerce and Industry, corn is\
    \ one of the essential food\ncrops in China, and its crop yield exceeds that of\
    \ rice and\nwheat. In 2021, the national grain ﬁeld was 6.3275 million\ntons,\
    \ 1.6 million tons more than the previous year, an in-\ncrease of 2.6%. Of these,\
    \ rice production was 21.285 million\ntons, up 100,000 tons or 0.5% of the prior\
    \ years; wheat\nproduction was 13.695 million tons, up 270,000 tons or 2.0%\n\
    of the prior years; and and corn production was 27.255\nmillion tons, up 1.64\
    \ million tons or 4.6% of the prior year.\nAs of December 2021, China’s grain\
    \ yield was 5805 kg/ha,\nunchanged from the previous year. Among grain crops,\
    \ rice\nyield was the highest at 7,113.4 kg/ha, while corn and wheat\nyields were\
    \ 6,291 and 5,863 kg/ha, respectively. Our phe-\nnotypic data and climatic data\
    \ used in this paper are from 14\ntest trial sites in mainland China, including\
    \ Beijing-Tianjin-\nHebei, Northeast, North China, Huang-Huai-Hai, North-\nwest,\
    \ and Southwest. Assessing the suitability of target va-\nrieties and planting\
    \ sites requires large amounts of\nexperimental data, and the corresponding costs\
    \ are often\nenormous [21].\n3.1. Data Introduction. Trough the collection and\
    \ collation\nof crop experimental data in the past ﬁve years, we have\n10,000\
    \ tabular datasets, each of which describes in detail the\nmultiple traits of\
    \ a certain maize variety at a certain ex-\nperimental point, including leaf blight,\
    \ lodging rate, in-\nversion rate, grey speck disease, plant height, ear height,\n\
    empty stalk rate, duration period, ear rot, hundred-grain\nweight, ear length,\
    \ bald tip length, fresh ear ﬁeld, acre yield,\nand relative change of yield.\
    \ Next, we will detail what each\ntrait dataset means and its possible eﬀect on\
    \ the crop.\n3.1.1. Leaf Blight (LB). Te disease is caused by Corynespora\numbilicus.\
    \ It mainly damages leaves, and in severe cases, it\nalso damages leaf sheaths\
    \ and bracts. It generally starts at the\nbottom leaf and gradually expands upwards.\
    \ Te disease is\nwidely distributed in all maize-growing regions in the world\n\
    and generally reduces maize production by 15–20%, and in\nsevere cases, it reduces\
    \ production by more than 50%. Te\noccurrence and prevalence of the disease are\
    \ comprehen-\nsively aﬀected by many factors such as disease resistance of\ninbred\
    \ lines, crop rotation system, climatic conditions, and\ncultivation measures.\n\
    3.1.2. Lodging Rate (LR). Lodging refers to the phenomenon\nthat crops that grow\
    \ upright are skewed due to excessive\ngrowth or even fall to the ground. Lodging\
    \ rate refers to the\npercentage of plants with a slope greater than 45 degrees\
    \ to\nthe total number of plants. It reﬂects the tilt or landing of\nmaize plants\
    \ due to wind and rain or improper management\nin the growth process of maize.\
    \ Te main reason for corn\nlodging is the weather, mainly rainy days in the jointing\n\
    period and storms in the grain-ﬁlling period.\n3.1.3. Inversion Rate (IR). It\
    \ refers to the percentage of plants\nbroken below the ear in the total number\
    \ of plants after\ntasseling. Tis phenomenon generally occurs about ten days\n\
    before the corn tassel stage, when the corn stalks are easily\nbroken by strong\
    \ winds. Tis situation is related to the heredity\nof varieties and the climatic\
    \ environment (such as wind speed)\nof planting sites.\n3.1.4. Grey Speck Disease\
    \ (GSD). Grey speck disease is one of\nthe most devastating corn diseases in northern\
    \ China,\nmainly aﬀecting the leaves. It is mainly harmful to leaves. In\nthe\
    \ early stages, rounded gray spots without distinct edges\nform on the surface\
    \ of the leaves, later turning brown. In\nsevere cases, most of the leaves turn\
    \ yellow and scorch, the\nears droop, the grains are loose and dry, and the 100-grain\n\
    weight decreases, which seriously aﬀects the yield and\nquality. Te disease is\
    \ obviously aﬀected by the climate, and\nit is easy to occur in weather conditions\
    \ with many rainy\ndays, high air humidity, and poor light.\n3.1.5. Plant Height\
    \ (PH). Plant height refers to the height of\nthe corn plant. Tis index has a\
    \ great inﬂuence on the yield\nand lodging rate of varieties. If the corn plant\
    \ is too high, it\nwill be more aﬀected by natural disasters such as strong wind\n\
    and heavy rain during the critical period of corn production.\nTe plant height\
    \ of corn is greatly aﬀected by fertilization.\nFor example, excessive nitrogen\
    \ fertilizer but lack of po-\ntassium fertilizer will cause the plant to grow\
    \ too vigorously,\nand the plant will be too high but the yield will decrease.\n\
    Computational Intelligence and Neuroscience\n3\n3.1.6. Ear Height (EH). It is\
    \ the length from the root of the\ncorn to the bottom of the ear of the corn.\
    \ Te lower the ear\nposition of corn is, the stronger the lodging rate is, and\
    \ on\nthe contrary, lodging occurs easily. Terefore, people prefer\nthe varieties\
    \ with low ear position and sometimes artiﬁcially\nsuppress the ear position.\
    \ Te ear height is mainly deter-\nmined by the variety but also has a certain\
    \ relationship with\nthe environment.\n3.1.7. Empty Stalk Rate (ESR). Empty stalk\
    \ generally refers\nto corn without ears, and the empty stalk rate generally refers\n\
    to the percentage of the total number of corn plants without\nears or ears without\
    \ seeds after the corn matures. Empty\nstalk rate is a common phenomenon in corn\
    \ production, and\nthe empty bar rate directly aﬀects the level of corn yield.\
    \ If\ncorn encounters rainy weather during the ﬂowering period,\nthe empty stalk\
    \ rate of some corn varieties may be as high as\n50% to 60%, resulting in a sharp\
    \ drop in corn yield.\n3.1.8. Duration Period (DP). It refers to the number of\
    \ days it\ntakes corn to mature from sowing to new seeds. Diﬀerent\nvarieties\
    \ of corn have diﬀerent duration periods, and climatic\nconditions will also lead\
    \ to changes in corn duration periods,\nsuch as north-south diﬀerences. According\
    \ to the length of\nthe duration period, corn varieties are also divided into\
    \ early-\nmaturing and late-maturing. Terefore, diﬀerent regions and\ndiﬀerent\
    \ varieties of corn have diﬀerent duration periods.\n3.1.9. Ear Rot (ER). Corn\
    \ ear rot is a disease caused by a\nvariety of pathogens, mainly caused by more\
    \ than 20 kinds\nof molds such as Fusarium graminearum, Penicillium, and\nAspergillus.\
    \ Te disease occurs in all corn-producing regions\nin China, especially in the\
    \ rainy and humid southwest. Some\npathogenic bacteria that cause this disease,\
    \ such as Asper-\ngillus ﬂavus, can produce toxic metabolites such as aﬂa-\ntoxins,\
    \ which cause serious harm to the health of humans,\nlivestock, and poultry. Te\
    \ disease is mainly related to the\nvariety, and the humid environment also has\
    \ a certain\ninﬂuence.\n3.1.10.\nHundred-Grain\nWeight\n(HGW). Hundred-grain\n\
    weight refers to the weight of 100 seeds, expressed in grams,\nand is an indicator\
    \ of seed size and plumpness. Te weight of\n100 grains of corn is generally around\
    \ 26–28 grams. If the\nvariety is good and the planting level is high, it can\
    \ generally\nexceed 30 grams. If you want to increase the grain weight, the\n\
    sowing date can be determined according to the local annual\ntemperature to meet\
    \ the accumulated temperature demand\nof the corn, so that the grains are within\
    \ the suitable grain-\nﬁlling temperature range. Tis index is aﬀected by corn\
    \ size\nand moisture content and varies by cultivar and growing\ntechnique.\n\
    3.1.11. Ear Length (EL). Ear length refers to the length of the\nwhiskers on the\
    \ tip of the corn cob. It is mainly determined\nby cultivar genes.\n3.1.12. Bald\
    \ Tip Length (BTL). Bald tip length refers to the\nlength of the tip and top of\
    \ the cob when corn is harvested\nwithout small kernels. Fresh ear ﬁeld is determined\
    \ by\nvarious factors such as the quality of corn varieties, soil\nmoisture, soil\
    \ fertility, pests and diseases, planting density,\nand planting technology.\n\
    3.1.13. Fresh Ear Field (FEF). Fresh ear ﬁeld refers to the\nweight of the mature\
    \ ear of fresh corn, which has a strong\ncorrelation with the yield per mu.\n\
    3.1.14. Corn Acre Yield (CAY). Corn acre yield refers to the\nweight of dry corn\
    \ kernels harvested on an acre of land.\nDiﬀerences in geographical environment,\
    \ varieties, man-\nagement techniques, etc. may lead to diﬀerent corn yields.\n\
    3.1.15. Relative Change of Yield (RCY). Relative change of\nyield refers to the\
    \ change of corn yield at the planting ex-\nperimental point relative to the reference\
    \ group. Tis index\nreﬂects the yield gap between the current experimental\nvariety\
    \ and the control group and is an important basis for\nour suitability evaluation.\n\
    Considering the impact of environmental and climatic\nfactors on the growth of\
    \ crops, we also collected daily en-\nvironmental and climatic data of each experimental\
    \ point,\nincluding temperature, air pressure, and humidity. Ten, the\nclimate\
    \ data of each variety growth cycle were preprocessed:\nthe mean and variance\
    \ of climate from sowing to maturity of\nmaize varieties were taken, including\
    \ the maximum tem-\nperature (MaxT), average temperature (AT), minimum\ntemperature\
    \ (MinT), temperature diﬀerence (TD), ground\npressure (GP), relative humidity\
    \ (RH), precipitation (P),\nmaximum wind speed (MWS), average wind speed (AWS),\n\
    wind direction angle (WDA), sunshine time (ST), and wind\nlevel (WL). Finally,\
    \ the above 15 crop phenotypic traits\ndatasets and the climate data of 24 test\
    \ trial sites were in-\ntegrated into the variety suitability evaluation data.\n\
    3.2. Data Preprocess. We further process the above data so\nthat it can be used\
    \ for model training. Data processing can be\nsimply divided into two steps: outliers\
    \ processing and data\nstandardization. Due to environmental diﬀerences in dif-\n\
    ferent test trial sites, some of the traits are not collected or\nrecorded correctly,\
    \ resulting in some outliers or missing\nvalues in the data. We ﬁrst manually\
    \ ﬁlter out possible\noutliers from the data and then ﬁll the average of these\n\
    feature data. Data standardization is mainly to solve the\nproblem of diﬀerent\
    \ dimensions of current data indexes.\nDiﬀerent evaluation indexes often have\
    \ diﬀerent dimensions\nand dimension units, and the direct addition cannot cor-\n\
    rectly reﬂect the comprehensive results of diﬀerent index. In\norder to eliminate\
    \ the dimensional impact between indexes,\ndata standardization is needed to achieve\
    \ comparability\nbetween datasets. Te visualization of data distribution\nbefore\
    \ and after standardization is shown in Figure 1.\nIn addition, we also carried\
    \ out data normalization\nexperiments, detailed in Tables 1and 2. Te experimental\n\
    4\nComputational Intelligence and Neuroscience\nresults show that, compared with\
    \ standardization, nor-\nmalization reduces the accuracy of the model. We infer\
    \ that\nthe reason is that the diﬀerence between the maximum value\nand the minimum\
    \ value in the data of various traits is large,\nand after normalizing it, the\
    \ boundaries between many\ndatasets are more blurred, and the model is diﬃcult\
    \ to\nidentify, so the accuracy of the model decreases.\n4. Data Correlation Analysis\n\
    Tis chapter is devoted to exploring the relationship between\nvariety suitability\
    \ and crop traits and the environmental\nclimate data of the test site. To further\
    \ understand the\ncomplex correlations between the datasets, we used the\nPearson\
    \ correlation coeﬃcient to analyze the correlations\nbetween the datasets.\nTere\
    \ are 39 types of experimental data, including 24\nkinds of climate data and 15\
    \ kinds of crop traits data. We\nﬁrst analyze the correlation between the datasets,\
    \ that is, the\nrelationship between the 39 types of data and the proposed\nlabel.\
    \ Te recommended variety labels fall into two cate-\ngories: termination test\
    \ and continuing test. Te former\nindicates that the crop is unsuitable for the\
    \ test trial site and\nshould be abandoned. Te latter indicates the variety has\n\
    good performance in the test trial site and could be further\ntested or planted\
    \ in large areas. Pearson correlation coef-\nﬁcient is used to measure the correlation\
    \ between recom-\nmended labels and climate and trait data, deﬁned as the\nquotient\
    \ of covariance and standard deviation between two\nvariables, as shown in Formula\
    \ (1). Finally, the relevant\nconclusions are shown in Table 3. For ease of viewing,\
    \ we\nroughen up the data that is more relevant.\nc \x88\n\U0010FF50n\ni\x881\
    \ Xi − X\n\0\U0010FF01 Yi − Y\n\0\U0010FF01\n\x81\x81\x81\x81\x81\x81\x81\x81\x81\
    \x81\x81\x81\x81\n\U0010FF50n\ni\x881 Xi − X\n\0\U0010FF01\n2\n\U0010FF71\n\x81\
    \x81\x81\x81\x81\x81\x81\x81\x81\x81\x81\x81\n\U0010FF50n\ni\x881 Yi − Y\n\0\U0010FF01\
    \n2\n\U0010FF71\n.\n(1)\nIt can be seen from Table 3 that the most relevant data\
    \ on\nthe recommended label of crop varieties is the relative\nchange of yield,\
    \ which represents the relative relationship\nbetween the current crop yield and\
    \ the reference group. In\naddition, the relative humidity, sunshine time, and\
    \ mini-\nmum temperature of the current test trial site environment\nalso have\
    \ a great impact on variety proposed label.\nAmong the experts’ evaluation criteria\
    \ of variety\nadaptability, relative change of yield is the most important\nreference\
    \ index, which also conforms to the variety suit-\nability judgment in most cases;\
    \ that is, yield increase means\nbetter adaptability. In other words, the goal\
    \ of variety\nsuitability can be attributed to increasing crop yield to some\n\
    extent. It is worth mentioning that, in Section 6.2 of this\narticle, we also\
    \ conducted experiments that do not use the\nrelative change of yield index to\
    \ determine the suitability of\nvarieties. Secondly, relative humidity directly\
    \ reﬂects the soil\nmoisture status. Relative humidity can increase maize leaf\n\
    area and yield to some extent [22, 23]. Ten, sunshine time\ndirectly determines\
    \ the time of crop photosynthesis, af-\nfecting the various stages of crop growth.\
    \ Maize is a short-\nday crop, and the whole growth period requires strong light,\n\
    so sunshine time has a greater impact on crops [24, 25].\nFinally, because maize\
    \ is a light-loving crop, it needs higher\ntemperature during the whole growth\
    \ period, so the eﬀect of\nminimum temperature on maize growth is more obvious.\
    \ If\nthe temperature of corn seedling stage is too low, it will lead\nto delayed\
    \ emergence and increased chance of infection.\nLow temperature during the growth\
    \ period of maize will lead\nto dwarﬁng of plants and poor growth and leaf development.\n\
    Low temperatures during the ripening period will delay the\ntime for corn to ripen.\
    \ Literature [26] reaches similar\nconclusions on the relationship between the\
    \ minimum\ntemperature and crop growth.\n5. Graph Neural Network Model for\nSuitability\
    \ Evaluation\nWe treat breed suitability evaluation as a classiﬁcation task.\n\
    Unlike previous methods based on machine learning and\nmultilayer perceptual networks,\
    \ graph neural networks can\nexploit the correlation between graph datasets to\
    \ inform\nsuitability evaluation. Te task of variety suitability evalu-\nation\
    \ is to judge the suitability of crops and test trial sites\nthrough phenotypic\
    \ data of crops and climate and envi-\nronmental data of test trial sites. Te\
    \ input to the model is\ntabular data, and the ﬁnal classiﬁcation result is output.\n\
    Machine learning or multilayer perceptron methods are\ngenerally not suitable\
    \ for tabular data, and they cannot ﬁnd\noptimal solutions to tabular decision\
    \ manifolds due to lack\nof proper inductive bias. Second, NLP-based methods are\n\
    diﬃcult to apply due to the lack of strong semantic asso-\nciations between columns.\
    \ In contrast, graph neural net-\nworks can model correlations between datasets,\
    \ using\nassociations to classify tabular data. Furthermore, consid-\nering the\
    \ large diﬀerences in the distribution of climate and\nsoil conditions among our\
    \ test trial sites, the introduction of\ngraph neural networks can also eﬀectively\
    \ exploit the geo-\ngraphic relationship between test trial sites. When the model\n\
    is predicting one of the test trial sites, the characteristics of\nthe adjacent\
    \ test trial sites can be combined with its own\ncharacteristics to improve the\
    \ prediction ability. Next, we\nbrieﬂy introduce the development process of graph\
    \ neural\nnetwork, then describe the construction method of graph,\nand ﬁnally\
    \ compare and analyze the experimental results of\nthe model.\nGraph neural network\
    \ is a new type of neural network.\nTe neural network adopts the idea of bionics\
    \ to realize\nmodeling by simulating the structure and function of the\nbiological\
    \ neural network. It can be regarded as a black box\nwhere we input speciﬁc data\
    \ features and obtain speciﬁc\noutput. Neural network can often learn the mapping\
    \ rela-\ntionship between input and output through internal itera-\ntions to meet\
    \ our task requirements. Speciﬁcally, classical\nneural network can be divided\
    \ into input layer, intermediate\nlayer (also known as hidden layer), and input\
    \ layer. Te\nnumber of nodes in the input layer and output layer is often\nﬁxed,\
    \ and the middle layer can be freely speciﬁed to hide any\nnumber of nodes. Experience\
    \ shows that the two-layer\nneural network can approximate any continuous function\n\
    and has very good data ﬁtting ability.\nComputational Intelligence and Neuroscience\n\

    0.661\n0.732\n0.748\n6\nComputational Intelligence and Neuroscience\nGraph neural\
    \ network (GNN) refers to the use of neural\nnetwork to learn graph structure\
    \ data and extract and ex-\nplore the characteristics and patterns in graph structure\
    \ data.\nGNN formulates certain strategies for nodes and edges in the\ngraph,\
    \ converts the graph structure data into standardized\nrepresentation, and inputs\
    \ them into various neural net-\nworks for node classiﬁcation, edge information\
    \ dissemina-\ntion, graph clustering, and other tasks. Literature [27]\nproposes\
    \ to apply convolution operation to graph and\nproposes graph convolution network\
    \ (GCN) by clever\ntransformation of convolution operator. Te core idea of\ngraph\
    \ convolution is to learn a function f to generate the\nrepresentation of node\
    \ Vi by aggregating its own feature Xi\nand neighbor feature Xj, where j ∈ N(Vi),\
    \ and N(Vi)\nrepresents the neighboring nodes near Vi. A general graph\nconvolution\
    \ structure can be represented as shown in\nFormula (2), which consists of 2 basic\
    \ operations, aggre-\ngation and update, and corresponding weights.\nX(l+1) \x88\

    \n\U0010FF11.\n(2)\nTe ﬁrst step in using a graph neural network is to build the\n\
    graph structure. Firstly, we input all the data with dimension\n[10000, 39] into\
    \ the graph structure. Each dataset is regarded as a\nnode, and the distance between\
    \ nodes is regarded as an edge of\nthe graph. More speciﬁcally, we take the chord\
    \ distance of node\ncharacteristics as the edge of the graph network and construct\n\
    the graph according to the corresponding source node and target\nnode. Secondly,\
    \ we use a certain number of nodes as losses to\ntrain graph networks to meet\
    \ our performance requirements.\nFinally, the model was used to assist experts\
    \ to determine the\nsuitability of varieties and test trial sites. Te whole project\n\
    process is shown in Figure 2.\nTe architecture diagram of the graph neural network\n\
    model is shown in Figure 3. Te network loss adopts neg-\native log likelihood\
    \ loss, which inputs 2 tensors, the pre-\ndiction tensor and the label. Te output\
    \ of the network\nobtains the logarithmic probability in the neural network\n\
    through the log softmax layer, namely, the prediction tensor\nof the network,\
    \ and then uses the data label to calculate the\nloss. In addition, the network\
    \ uses Adam optimizer [28] to\noptimize network parameters.\n6. Experiments\n\
    6.1. Experimental Results and Analysis. Diﬀerent from the\ntraditional neural\
    \ network, the graph network needs to input\nthe entire dataset into the graph\
    \ at one time and then specify\na node as a loss to update the network parameters.\
    \ Terefore,\nfor a total of 10000 nodes, we choose 50, 100, 400, 700, 1000,\n\
    and 2000 nodes as losses to update the network, and the\nresults are shown in\
    \ Table 1.\nIt can be seen from Table 1 that the prediction perfor-\nmance of\
    \ the model after data standardization is the best,\nwhether it is the graph convolution\
    \ network or the tradi-\ntional machine learning method; that is, the data stan-\n\
    dardization operation is conducive to improving the\nprediction accuracy of the\
    \ model. Ten, for the graph neural\nnetwork, the more the training data are, the\
    \ more ﬁtting the\ndistribution of the entire data is. In other words, with the\n\
    increase of the number of training samples, the accuracy of\nthe model is gradually\
    \ improved.\nTo verify the performance of the graph neural network\nmodel, we\
    \ conduct comparative experiments using tradi-\ntional machine learning and neural\
    \ network methods. We\nﬁrst divide the dataset with data dimension [10000, 39]\
    \ into\ntraining set and test set according to the ratio of 4 :1, training\nset:\
    \ test set \x88 8000 : 2000. Ten, we use traditional neural\nnetworks and various\
    \ machine learning methods for\ntraining, including KNN (K-Nearest Neighbor (N\
    \ \x88 15)), LR\n(logistic regression), SVM (Support Vector Machine), NB\n(Naive\
    \ Bayes classiﬁer), DT (decision tree), RF (Random\nForest), MLP (multilayer perceptron),\
    \ RBFNN (Radial Basis\nFunction Neural Network [29]). Furthermore, we also used\
    \ a\nGAT (graph attention neural network [30]) model for\ncomparison.\nFor a relatively\
    \ fair comparison, we align the hidden\nlayers of the traditional neural network\
    \ with the graph\nneural network. First, we design a six-layer neural network\n\
    with four hidden layers, the six-layer perceptron. Te input\nfeature dimension\
    \ is 39 and the output feature dimension is\n2. Cross entropy is used as loss,\
    \ probability distribution p is\nexpected output, probability distribution q is\
    \ actual output,\nand cross entropy can be expressed as in Formula (3). For\n\
    RBFNN and GAT, due to the large diﬀerence in network\nstructure, it is diﬃcult\
    \ to align with GCN, so we choose\ncommon network settings. Te number of input\
    \ nodes of\nGAT is 39, the hidden layer nodes is 64, and the attention\nhead is\
    \ 2.\nH(p, q) \x88 − \U0010FF58\nx\n(p(x)logq(x)) +(1 − p(x))log(1 − q(x)).\n\
    (3)\nTe results obtained by using the above machine\nlearning model for training\
    \ are shown in Table 2; the higher\nperformance among them is marked in bold.\
    \ In order to\nshow the performance of the model more comprehensively,\nwe use\
    \ ﬁve indicators for evaluation: accuracy rate, precision\nrate, recall rate,\
    \ F1-score, and AUC, and we ﬁnally take the\naverage of 20 repeated experiments\
    \ as the experimental\nresult. Accuracy refers to the ratio of the number of correctly\n\
    classiﬁed samples to the total number of samples, which\nmost directly reﬂects\
    \ the performance of the model but is\neasily aﬀected by class imbalance. Te precision\
    \ rate is the\nratio of the number of correctly classiﬁed positive examples\n\
    to the number of classiﬁed positive examples, which mea-\nsures the precision\
    \ rate of the model. Recall is the ratio of the\nnumber of correctly classiﬁed\
    \ positive examples to the actual\nnumber of positive examples and measures the\
    \ recall rate of\nthe model. Te F1 score can be regarded as the harmonic\naverage\
    \ of the model’s accuracy and recall, and the calcu-\nlation formula is as shown\
    \ in formula (4).\nAUC (Area under Curve) is deﬁned as the area enclosed\nby the\
    \ coordinate axis under the ROC curve. Te closer the\nAUC to 1.0, the higher the\
    \ authenticity of the detection\nmethod; when it is equal to 0.5, the authenticity\
    \ is the lowest\nand has no application value.\nComputational Intelligence and\
    \ Neuroscience\n7\nF1 \x88 2 ∗ Precision ∗ Recall\nPrecision + Recall.\n(4)\n\
    Among those machine learning methods, random forest,\nSupport Vector Machine,\
    \ and logistic regression perform the\nbest, while decision tree and na¨ıve Bayesian\
    \ model perform\nthe worst. Compared with the decision tree, the random\nforest\
    \ adopts the integrated algorithm, which is equivalent to\nintegrating multiple\
    \ decision tree models, and determines\nthe result by voting or averaging each\
    \ tree, so the accuracy is\nbetter than that of the decision tree. In addition,na¨ıveNaive\n\
    Bayesian model has two basic assumptions. Te independent\nvariables are independent\
    \ of each other, and the continuous\nindependent variables are subject to normal\
    \ distribution\nrelative to the dependent variables. Combined with the\nvisualization\
    \ analysis of the numerical distribution of the\ndata in Chapter 3, the independent\
    \ variable does not fully\nconform to the normal distribution relative to the\
    \ dependent\nvariable but ﬂuctuates within a certain range. We believe that\n\
    this is the main reason for the decline in the accurana¨ıve the\nNaive Bayesian\
    \ model.\nWe use the 1000 nodes of the GCN model as the training\nloss accuracy\
    \ for comparison, which is 74.8%. Compared\nwith traditional machine learning\
    \ (67.6%), MLP (68.4%),\nand RBFNN (68.1%), graph neural network achieves higher\n\
    variety suitability evaluation accuracy with fewer training\nsamples. Furthermore,\
    \ compared with GAT (73.1%), the\nGCN model is better in accuracy, but the accuracy\
    \ is not as\ngood as GAT. Moreover, the GCN model also has a good\nrecall rate,\
    \ F1, and AUC scores, further verifying the su-\nperiority of the model performance.\n\
    For the traditional neural network and machine learning\nalgorithms, each variety\
    \ suitability evaluation dataset is\nconsidered as a point feature information,\
    \ and the algorithm\nlearns the complex mapping relationship between features\n\
    and labels. In contrast, the graph neural network can\ntransmit information through\
    \ the graph structure, update\nthe state of hidden nodes through the sum of the\
    \ weights of\nadjacent nodes, and eﬀectively utilize the association be-\ntween\
    \ feature nodes. For tabular data, diﬀerent data come\nfrom diﬀerent experimental\
    \ points, and there are obvious\ncorrelations (such as climate factors) between\
    \ adjacent test\ntrial sites. Terefore, the method of node aggregation can not\n\
    only mine the similarity between features but also make\ngood use of the association\
    \ between geographic locations.\nGAT is generally considered to be an upgrade\
    \ of GCN.\nWhen GAT updates the features of nodes, it ﬁrst calculates\nthe attention\
    \ scores of all neighbor nodes and then\nInput\nReLU\nOutput\nND128\nND256\nND32\n\

    \ be divided into 3 parts: data analysis, correlation analysis, and\nconstruction\
    \ of graph structure. Te data analysis part shows the source and numerical distribution\
    \ of the data; the correlation analysis part\ngives the relationship between the\
    \ suitability evaluation indicators and the climate, environment, and crop phenotype\
    \ data; the graph\nconstruction part uses each piece of data as a node to construct\
    \ a graph and input it into GNN.\n8\nComputational Intelligence and Neuroscience\n\
    aggregates the corresponding neighbor features according to\nthe attention scores\
    \ to better utilize the correlation between\nfeatures. However, GAT (73.1%) does\
    \ not perform as well as\nGCN (74.8%) on our applicability evaluation task. We\
    \ infer\nthat the reason is that the GATdoes not fully utilize the edge\ninformation\
    \ and the network does not learn the connection\nweights between nodes well.\n\
    6.2. Further Research. It can be seen from the data corre-\nlation in Table 3\
    \ that the correlation between the relative\nchange of ﬁeld index and the suitability\
    \ evaluation label is\nmuch larger than that of other types of data. Terefore,\
    \ we\ndoubt whether the accuracy of the model is too much af-\nfected by the index,\
    \ resulting in a sharp decline in the\nperformance of the model that is indeed\
    \ the index, thereby\nreducing the actual availability of the model. Terefore,\
    \ we\nconduct feature data ablation experiments in a targeted\nmanner.\nFirstly,\
    \ the relative changes of yield traits in the overall\ndata were removed, and\
    \ the other data remained unchanged.\nTen, 20 groups of experiments were carried\
    \ out, and the\naverage value was taken as shown in Table 4. Te accuracy of\n\
    the graph neural network model is reduced by about 4%. In\ncontrast, the traditional\
    \ machine learning and neural net-\nwork methods decrease greatly, which to some\
    \ extent shows\nthat the graph neural network learns more data high-order\ncorrelation\
    \ and the model is more robust. In summary, in\nthe absence of relative change\
    \ of yield index, we can think\nthat the overall performance of the model is within\
    \ an ac-\nceptable range.\n7. Conclusion and Future Work\nWith the continuous\
    \ growth of the world population and the\ndeterioration of the political and commercial\
    \ situation, food\nproduction has become the focus of attention. Te use of\nartiﬁcial\
    \ intelligence technology to improve land suitability\nand variety adaptability,\
    \ thereby increasing the yield of food\ncrops, has become the consensus of agricultural\
    \ researchers.\nWe collected traits and local climate data of 10,000 maize\nlines\
    \ in multiple test trial sites, artiﬁcial intelligence tech-\nnology to learn\
    \ and explore the suitability between maize\nvarieties and test trial sites. Among\
    \ all artiﬁcial intelligence\nmethods, graph neural network has generally achieved\
    \ good\napplicability evaluation results, and only 1/10 training\nsamples are\
    \ used to achieve 75% accuracy.\nIn the future, we will introduce more factors\
    \ related to\nsuitability evaluation, such as the genetic sequence of va-\nrieties\
    \ and soil components, and improve the current in-\ntelligent technology, so that\
    \ artiﬁcial intelligence can\nessentially replace expert evaluation. Furthermore,\
    \ after\nmastering the data of a variety in a test trial site, the\nsuitability\
    \ of the variety for other test trial sites can be judged\naccording to the trait\
    \ data of the variety and the current\nenvironmental data. Tis can eliminate a\
    \ large number of\nschemes considered unsuitable by artiﬁcial intelligence, thus\n\
    greatly reducing the cost of trial and error between varieties\nand test trial\
    \ sites, accelerating the identiﬁcation of varieties\nmost suitable for current\
    \ test trial sites, and ultimately in-\ncreasing the yield of food crops.\nData\

    \ (TS) on crucial environmental processes, includ-\ning water inﬁltration, subsurface\
    \ movement, plant growth, and its inﬂuence on land–atmosphere\ndynamics, cannot\
    \ be undermined. While satellite and land surface model-based data are valuable\
    \ in\ndata-sparse areas, they necessitate innovative solutions to bridge gaps\
    \ and overcome temporal delays\narising from their dependence on atmospheric and\
    \ hydro–meteorological factors. This research\nintroduces a viable technique to\
    \ address the lag in the Famine Early Warning Network Land Data\nAssimilation\
    \ System (FLDAS). Notably, this approach exhibits versatility, proving highly\
    \ effective in\nanalyzing datasets characterized by signiﬁcant seasonal trends,\
    \ and its application holds immense\nvalue in watershed-scaled hydrological research.\
    \ Leveraging the enhanced state-space (SS) method\nfor forecasting in the FLDAS,\
    \ this technique harnesses TS datasets collected over time at various\ndepths\
    \ (0–10 cm, 10–40 cm, and 40–100 cm), employing a multiplicative SS model for\
    \ modeling\npurposes. By employing the 1-step, 6-step, and 12-step-ahead models\
    \ at different depths and 2 lo-\ncations in Quebec, Canada, the outcomes showcased\
    \ a performance with an average coefﬁcient of\ndetermination (R2) of 0.88 and\
    \ root mean squared error (RMSE) of 2.073 ◦C for the dynamic model,\nR2 of 0.834\
    \ and RMSE of 2.979 ◦C for the 6-step-ahead model, and R2 of 0.921 and RMSE of\
    \ 1.865 ◦C\nfor the 12-step-ahead model. The results revealed that as the prediction\
    \ horizon expands and the\nlength of the input data increases, the accuracy of\
    \ predictions progressively improves, indicating that\nthis model becomes increasingly\
    \ accurate over time.\nKeywords: prediction; FLDAS; soil science; soil temperature;\
    \ satellite; lag\n1. Introduction\nSoil temperature (TS) is one of the essential\
    \ environmental factors used in various\ndisciplines such as engineering and hydraulic\
    \ structures design, geotechnics, hydrological\nand meteorological studies, agriculture,\
    \ forestry, and many other ﬁelds. The majority of\nthe chemical and physical characteristics\
    \ of soil are temperature-dependent. For instance,\nﬂuctuations in TS directly\
    \ affect water inﬁltration; thus, variations in TS and inﬁltration\nrates follow\
    \ similar patterns [1–3]. Soil temperature may affect other processes, such as\n\
    groundwater discharge, land–atmosphere ﬂuxes such as evapotranspiration, gas exchange,\n\
    and surface runoff patterns [4–6]. Fluxes of greenhouse gases such as carbon dioxide\
    \ (CO2)\nand nitrous oxide (N2O) directly depend on TS [7,8], which relates to\
    \ global warming on a\nlarge scale. Any alterations to atmospheric constituents\
    \ mutually affect the soil temperature.\nBecause the thermal energy balance between\
    \ the soil and atmosphere is preserved, the soil\ncan either act as a heat source\
    \ or sink [9–12]. Similarly, the impact of TS on the agriculture\nsection cannot\
    \ be ignored, e.g., the dependency of crops’ growth on TS, irrigation planning,\n\
    and hydrological drought monitoring [13,14].\nSustainability 2023, 15, 9567. https://doi.org/10.3390/su15129567\n\

    \ of 21\nEstimating the TS time series by using artiﬁcial intelligence (AI) models\
    \ and exoge-\nnous variables is common. For instance, multilayer perceptron (MLP),\
    \ an artiﬁcial neural\nnetwork (ANN) model and a multivariate linear regression\
    \ with air temperature (Ta), solar\nradiation (RS), relative humidity (RH), and\
    \ precipitation inputs as inputs [15], MLP and\nan adaptive neuro–fuzzy inference\
    \ system, genetic programming and an ANN with Ta,\nRS, RH, wind speed, and dew\
    \ points inputs [16–18], a self-adaptive evolutionary extreme\nlearning machine\
    \ with Rs, Ta, and pressure [19], an emotional neural network, and a\nleast square\
    \ support vector machine [20] are some of the AI methods used in this ﬁeld.\n\
    Though these modeling methods are powerful in creating estimations, they are prone\
    \ to\nmodel parameter tuning and input selection uncertainties [21,22]. To solve\
    \ this problem,\nresearchers developed remotely sensed data.\nFurther developments\
    \ of remote sensing tools and land surface methods with extended\nhistorical temporal\
    \ coverage have improved the quality and quantity of environmental data,\nparticularly\
    \ in regions with limited available data. However, land coverage, upwelling\n\
    atmospheric emissions [23], cloud coverage [24], satellite machine failure, and\
    \ consequent\nerrors in the inputs of land surface models are most often responsible\
    \ for missing values in\nremotely sensed data. Therefore, many methods have been\
    \ proposed to ﬁll in the dataset’s\ngaps [25].\nVarious methods have been proposed\
    \ to ﬁll in gaps in remotely sensed data, including\ncombining temporal steps\
    \ to create a composite set. Weiss et al. [26] categorized data\nrecovery methods\
    \ into three classes: (a) spatial, (b) temporal sequences of images, and\n(c)\
    \ spatio–temporal ﬁlling methods. Inverse distance weighting (IDW), kriging, cokriging,\n\
    and their variants are widely recognized methods in spatial class [27,28]. IDW\
    \ and its\nvariants, such as harmony search, genetic algorithm (ga), and particle\
    \ swarm–IDW, are\ncommonly used and reliable approaches. A comparative study by\
    \ Bărbulescu et al. [29]\nshowed that the ga–IDW method outperformed other methods\
    \ in 70% of the cases studied.\nThe principal component analysis, stochastic models,\
    \ and k nearest neighbor (kNN) are\nother popular statistical approaches for estimating\
    \ missing values [30,31]. Weiss et al. used\nthe spatio–temporal method to ﬁll\
    \ gaps in the land surface temperature and vegetation\nindex, achieving an accuracy\
    \ of R2 = 0.87, however could not evaluate embedded uncer-\ntainties or account\
    \ for temperature values impacted by cloudy days. This conclusion adds\nto the\
    \ inherent uncertainty of their model.\nIntegrating remotely-sensed data with\
    \ modeling backed by historical data decreases\nmeasurement limitations and variable-based\
    \ method deﬁciencies, namely, input variable\nuncertainties and error accumulation\
    \ [18,22], where both non-linear and linear models are\napplicable. However, using\
    \ a method with a derivable explicit expression fast enough to\nbuild real-time\
    \ estimations and reasonably accurate information is prioritized over other\n\
    methods. The advanced state-space (SS) method in hydrology is a relatively less\
    \ utilized\nlinear method for modeling time series with intense periodic ﬂuctuations.\
    \ This model\nuses multiple in-line pre-processing methods to produce white noise\
    \ data. It additionally\ncan be used to remove time series anomalies [32] and\
    \ forecast future steps using the\nout-of-sample forecasting ability of the model.\
    \ Studies on the SS model as a forecasting\nmethod are limited. Reservoir inﬂow\
    \ modeling, climatic data, catchment rainfalls, and\nland hotspots are the parameters\
    \ modeled and forecasted by the SS method [33–36]. For\nexample, Vijayakumar and\
    \ Vennila [33] compared the autoregressive integrated moving\naverage (ARIMA)\
    \ model with the SS method. The model input included reservoir inﬂows,\nand the\
    \ results indicated that the SS method could overcome the deﬁciencies of the ARIMA\n\
    model. They stated that the ARIMA model did not successfully deal with the time\
    \ series\ncomponents observed in their data. For the forecast procedure, the trend\
    \ component\nwas removed before autocorrelation modeling. Additionally, they mentioned\
    \ that the\nmodel could not forecast the “turning points”. These deﬁciencies,\
    \ alongside the linear\nnature of stochastic models and requisite preprocessing\
    \ steps before modeling, represent\nother limitations.\nSustainability 2023, 15,\
    \ 9567\n3 of 21\nIn a recent study by Zeynoddin et al. [37], a comprehensive exploration\
    \ of techniques\nfor predicting time series data was undertaken, encompassing\
    \ variable-based models, AI\nmodeling approaches, and linear methods. They proposed\
    \ a linear methodology that pre-\nprocesses TS data using several methods and\
    \ models the data dynamically via stochastic\nmodels. Comparative analysis with\
    \ ML techniques [19] revealed that combining the SS\nmethod with the stochastic\
    \ model yielded signiﬁcantly more precise results. Building upon\nthese ﬁndings,\
    \ Zeynoddin and Bonakdari [38] introduced a structurally optimized deep\nlearning\
    \ method that integrated the SS method for long-term soil moisture forecasting.\
    \ Re-\nmarkably, their study demonstrated that the SS method excelled at regenerating\
    \ long-term\ntime series features and substantially enhanced forecast accuracy\
    \ compared to other meth-\nods. Moreover, their solution effectively mitigated\
    \ the data size dependency problem often\nencountered in data-driven modeling\
    \ approaches. While this proposed structure has limita-\ntions, such as its ﬁnite\
    \ domain of model variables, exclusivity to seasonally structured data,\nand the\
    \ complexity of the deep learning method, the authors hypothesized that the compre-\n\
    hensive and generalizable structure of the SS method for seasonal data modeling\
    \ could be\nleveraged to ﬁll the temporal gap in FLDAS datasets. These datasets,\
    \ generated at a monthly\nresolution [39] with a two-month availability lag, as\
    \ indicated on the GEE catalog website\n(Earth Engine Data Catalog: NASA_FLDAS_NOAH01_C_GL_M_V001#description),\
    \ are\ninﬂuenced by the annual or monthly trends exhibited by the TS time series\
    \ [10], which\ntemporally and spatially vary due to atmospheric and subsoil processes\
    \ affecting ther-\nmal equilibrium.\nThe objectives of this paper are (a) to introduce\
    \ an extraction method for the collection\nof monthly mean TS data for two agricultural\
    \ areas in Quebec, Canada and (b) to apply\nthe powerful SS method for modeling.\
    \ Following these are (c) a spatial validation analysis\nwill be carried out to\
    \ analyze the model’s accuracy alternation and pattern evaluation in\ncase a time\
    \ series of different locations are used, and (d) a trend and long-term alternations\n\
    analysis of the TS variable will be carried out based on the model results and\
    \ forecasts.\nFinally, (e) the results of the proposed FLDAS–state-space method\
    \ will be comprehensively\ndiscussed in the following sections. Furthermore, this\
    \ paper will outline the practical\napplication of these results, including their\
    \ integration into future TS forecasts, thereby\nmaking a signiﬁcant contribution\
    \ to the ﬁeld.\n2. Time Series and Pre-Processing Review\nSince this study uses\
    \ a time series-based approach, a review of necessary methods for\ntime series\
    \ preparation is presented. Time series can have jumps, periods, and seasonal\n\
    and non-seasonal trends deemed deterministic. They can additionally have a stochastic\n\
    component, constituted of residuals of the deterministic characteristics subtracted\
    \ from\nthe time series’ values. The deterministic component is the predictable\
    \ part of the time\nseries’ pattern and can be detected and extracted. Detecting\
    \ the mentioned patterns and\nanalyzing TS data entails employing several tests.\
    \ These tests not only help to detect\nmeaningful patterns, however they can additionally\
    \ help to extract statistics and interpret\nthe time series. Following pre-processing\
    \ methods, models are applied to prepare data for\nforecasting [40].\nThe ﬁrst\
    \ attribute of a time series to be checked is stationarity. It means the absence\n\
    of meaningful changes in mean, variance, and other statistics over time. Therefore,\
    \ the\nKwiatkowski–Phillips–Schmidt–Shin (KPSS) test is applied to TS for assessing\
    \ station-\narity [41]. In the KPSS test, a regression equation is ﬁtted to the\
    \ data. The TS series is\nstationary if the variance of the independent variables\
    \ of that equation is null. Alternatively,\nit is stationary in trend if the deterministic\
    \ term of the trend is not null and stationary in\nlevel if the deterministic\
    \ term of the trend is equal to zero. Seasonal and non-seasonal trends\nin the\
    \ TS time series as one of the non-stationarity factors is checked by the Mann–Kendal\n\
    and seasonal Mann–Kendal trend (MK and SMK) tests [42,43].\nJumps appear in time\
    \ series as sudden increases or decreases and can be both induced\nby human and\
    \ natural sources. To evaluate this factor, the non-parametric Mann–Whitney\n\
    Sustainability 2023, 15, 9567\n4 of 21\n(MW) test can be performed [42]. More\
    \ details about pre-processing steps can be found in\nZeynoddin et al. [22]. The\
    \ autocorrelation function (ACF) is a tool to evaluate a dataset’s\nrandomness\
    \ or assess whether a non-linear or linear model would be appropriate. This\n\
    way, it can be found whether an observation is related to adjacent observations\
    \ or not.\nAdditionally, speciﬁc patterns in time series, such as sinusoidal ﬂuctuations\
    \ interpreted\nas periodicity, can be detected. Therefore, we can judge the time\
    \ series’ condition and\ninterpret it. An ACF plot is an intuitive method to assess\
    \ the data more conveniently.\nThe ACF demonstrates the autocorrelation of data\
    \ separated by a lag distance. Both\npositive and negative ACF values are considered\
    \ as the correlation between lags. Still,\nfor several lags, if the positive values\
    \ of an ACF consecutively exceed speciﬁc values,\nin this case, the 95% signiﬁcance\
    \ levels, they are interpreted as signiﬁcantly correlated\nlags. These signiﬁcant\
    \ correlations should be reduced or removed from the time series\nto obtain independent\
    \ variables and reduce the impacts of the deterministic components\nin the modeling\
    \ procedure. As mentioned earlier, the deterministic components are the\npredictable\
    \ part of the series and are responsible for dependency in the time series. This\n\
    part of the time series’ structure can be separated before modeling and restored\
    \ to modeled\ndata. The stochastic component is the mere important part for modeling\
    \ purposes. The\nsigniﬁcance intervals are deﬁned based on the cumulative distribution\
    \ function of the\nstandard normal distribution and the 95% signiﬁcance level.\n\
    3. Materials and Methods\n3.1. Soil Temperature Collection and Analyses\n3.1.1.\
    \ Famine Early Warning Network Land Data Assimilation System\nThe Famine Early\
    \ Warning Network Land Data Assimilation System (FLDAS) program\nimproves the\
    \ quality of measured values by combining hydroclimatic data and observations\n\
    to develop rainfall, soil moisture, evapotranspiration, and soil temperature products\
    \ at a\nmonthly resolution. These products are hosted by Google Earth Engine and\
    \ can be merged\nwith variables related to food security assessment in data-sparse\
    \ countries. The program\nis developed by the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS), NASA\
    \ GSFC, Goddard Space Flight\nCenter (GSFC), and the University of California\
    \ Santa Barbara (UCSB). It can provide\nhelpful information to water resources\
    \ and agricultural stakeholders. The output of the\nFLDAS can be used to compare\
    \ current and past hydrological conditions and can be merged\nwith other land\
    \ information systems to produce an ensemble of hydroclimatic variables.\nThe\
    \ FLDAS utilizes the Noah version 3.6.1 land surface model (LSM), the Climate\n\
    Hazards Group Infrared Precipitation with Station (CHIRPS) 6-hourly rainfall,\
    \ and the\nModern-Era Retrospective Analysis for Research and Applications version\
    \ 2 (MERRA-2).\nMoreover, the system uses the African Rainfall Estimation Algorithm\
    \ Version 2 (RFE 2.0)\nand the CHIRPS for low latency. Using the Land Data Tool\
    \ Kit (LDTK), the FLDAS provides\nand preprocesses the land cover parameters needed\
    \ for the Noah model. The LDTK contains\nthe products of the NASA Soil Moisture\
    \ Active Passive (SMAP), the Moderate Resolution\nImaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS),\
    \ the Advanced Very High-Resolution Radiometer\n(AVHRR) from NOAA 19 satellites,\
    \ the CHIRPS quasi-global rainfall data set obtained\nfrom high-resolution satellite\
    \ imagery, MERRA2, and the Global Data Assimilation System\n(GDAS), which uses\
    \ multiple sources of information such as balloon, aircraft, radar, and\nsatellite\
    \ data. This tool kit allows the FLDAS to use rich sources of high-resolution\
    \ datasets,\nwith near real-time observations. In return, the data are fed to\
    \ the Noah LSM to produce\nhigh-accuracy outputs.\nAll datasets are available\
    \ from 1982 to the present at a 0.1 arc degree and a monthly\ntemporal resolution.\
    \ A ﬂexibility in using different products represents the advantage\nof the FLDAS,\
    \ products such as FEWS NET operational rainfall. Using multiple surface\nmodels,\
    \ normal assessment, and a fast and appropriate data distribution represent the\n\
    other advantages of this system. The FLDAS datasets can be obtained from the Google\n\

    \ and Validation\n3.2.1. State-Space Method\nSmoothing methods are among the data\
    \ processing approaches to stationarize time\nseries and eliminate the deterministic\
    \ components. Using speciﬁc algorithms, they can\nremove ﬂuctuations and predictable\
    \ patterns to enable predicting trends, seasonality, and\nfuture values. Among\
    \ them are included moving average, simple exponential, linear expo-\nnential,\
    \ seasonal exponential smoothing, and damped trend exponential smoothing [49–51].\n\
    The state-space (SS) method is a renowned, advanced, and robust triple exponential\n\
    smoothing method used to remove trend, seasonality, and level in highly seasonal\
    \ series\nand has additionally been used for forecasting data [52]. The SS method\
    \ is divided into an\nadditive form for cases where seasonality is roughly constant\
    \ and a multiplicative form\nfor series with seasonal trends. Each one has three\
    \ smoothing parameters that need to be\noptimized using any optimization method,\
    \ or trial and error. The multiplicative form of\nthe method is as follows [53]:\n\
    lt = α(Ts/(St−ω)) + (1 − α)(lt−1 + bt−1)\n(1)\nbt = β(lt − lt−1) + (1 − β)bt−1\n\
    (2)\nSt = γ(Ts/(lt−1 + bt−1)) + (1 − γ)bt−1\n(3)\nSSt+m = (lt + mbt)St−ω+m\n(4)\n\
    In the above equations, lt is level smoothing, bt is trend, and St is seasonal\
    \ components\nsmoothing; A, β, and γ are additional smoothing parameters; Ω is\
    \ seasonality, and m\ndenotes forecasting time steps; SSt+m is the forecasted\
    \ data by the state-space method\nfor m future lags; and T – ω + m assures the\
    \ use of the latest historical data. Using\nreal data to update forecasts, the\
    \ model adapts itself to the new data, and the error is\nsubsequently reduced.\
    \ Therefore, the longer the training set is, the fewer errors will be\ngenerated.\
    \ This feature can be considered a drawback too. In short time series, the model\n\
    cannot adapt to data ﬂuctuations, and therefore, accuracy may be reduced in multi-step\n\
    forecasts. Compared to stochastic models, another advantage of this model is that\
    \ it does\nnot require normalization. The SS parameters can be obtained through\
    \ either trial and error\nor optimization algorithms such as nonlinear generalized\
    \ reduced gradient (GRG), which\nis applied to the three components of the SS\
    \ method in this study.\n3.2.2. Performance Metrics\nThe ﬁrst 75% of the data\
    \ is used in this study to calibrate the model parameters, and\nthe last 25% is\
    \ used for model validation by using the following indices: Coefﬁcients of\ndetermination\
    \ (R2), root mean squared error (RMSE), and mean absolute error (MAE) are\nused\
    \ to evaluate the model accuracy of the time series obtained from pre-processing\
    \ of\nthe original TS data. To assess the modeling power, the Nash–Sutcliffe model\
    \ efﬁciency\n(EN-S) is additionally used [54]. The closer EN-S is to a value of\
    \ one, the more powerful the\nmodel is.\nR2 =\n\n\n\0∑n\ni=1\n\0TS,obsi − TS,obsi\n\

    4. Results Analysis\n4.1. TS Time Series\nIn order to retrieve the soil temperature\
    \ data from the FLDAS, a set of commands was\ncoded using the GEE API. The extracted\
    \ time series were tested for stationarity, and the\nresults are presented in\
    \ Table 1 for Quebec City and Montreal, respectively. Since the focus\nwas on\
    \ the study points, and the validation points followed the same pattern, the results\
    \ of\nthese points are not presented. The SMK test results show signiﬁcant seasonal\
    \ trends in\nboth TS time series. For each soil layer (there are 3 layers with\
    \ the following upper–lower\ndepths of 0–10, 10–40, and 40–100 cm), the probabilities\
    \ corresponding to the MK and MW\ntest results are higher than the signiﬁcance\
    \ level of 5%. Thus, the presence of non-seasonal\ntrends and jumps in the datasets\
    \ are not signiﬁcant. Figure 6 shows the ACF plots of all\nthe series. The seasonal\
    \ correlations can be seen as sinusoidal patterns, with peaks at lags\n12, 24,\
    \ 36, 48, 60, 72, and 84, equivalent to 7 seasonal lags with a repetition of 12\
    \ months.\nIn these lags, the ACF values are higher than the 95% conﬁdence interval,\
    \ and therefore,\nthese correlations are considered signiﬁcant. They are found\
    \ at all soil depths. Considering\nthe signiﬁcant periodicity that could be observed\
    \ and the presence of a seasonal trend, the\nKPSS test failed to detect the impact\
    \ of these non-stationary factors properly. All probability\nvalues for this test\
    \ are higher than a signiﬁcance level of 5%. It additionally indicates the\nimportance\
    \ of utilizing several tests for stationarity detection. In other words, by using\n\
    the MK and SMK tests, the signiﬁcance of the gradual changes over time was assessed.\n\
    According to these results, these incremental changes were only signiﬁcant seasonally.\
    \ As\nthe MW test demonstrated, no sudden changes were detected in the datasets.\n\
    On the other hand, the ACF plots showed intensive periodicity. Consequently, as\n\
    the seasonal trend and periodicity are both prerequisites of the state-space multiplicative\n\
    method, this method is deemed suitable for forecasting. On the other hand, if\
    \ the series\nwere trendless, then the additive method would have been appropriate.\n\

    \ to forecast the TS of Montreal and Quebec City. This method requires three\n\
    smoothing parameters to eliminate deterministic terms in the time series. Moreover,\n\
    initial values are needed to obtain the SS formula’s level, trend, and seasonal\
    \ components.\nTherefore, the ﬁrst period of the TS time series was used to initiate\

    \ methods. As\nthe soil depth increased, a general decline in accuracy could be\
    \ seen, except for the ﬁrst soil\nlayer (10–40 cm) for both fs6 and fs12. At this\
    \ depth, the accuracy was lower than in the\nother two depths. According to the\
    \ results, there are some variations in the magnitude of\nthe errors with a maximum\
    \ value of ~3 ◦C. For all depths, the average difference between\nforecasts and\
    \ observations was ~2 ◦C except for Montreal (10–40 cm). For the Quebec City\n\
    modeled time series, all sudden drops in accuracy were observed deeper in the\
    \ soil proﬁle\n(40–100 cm). A decrease in model accuracy was additionally observed\
    \ in the Montreal\nmodel results. However, this reduction in accuracy of the ﬁrst\
    \ soil layer (10–40 cm) is\nSustainability 2023, 15, 9567\n11 of 21\nmore signiﬁcant\
    \ than that of the second (40–100 cm), in contrast to the Quebec City model\n\
    results, which had a uniform trend in accuracy reduction. The Nash–Sutcliffe coefﬁcient\n\
    additionally demonstrates the power and efﬁciency of the generated model in forecasting\n\
    shallow depths. This sudden decline is due to extreme changes in the level component\
    \ of\nthe SS model, and the model could not adequately adapt over that period.\
    \ Furthermore,\nthe parameters are not optimized properly. The TS datasets are\
    \ highly periodic, and the\nSS seasonal parameter was expected to have a greater\
    \ weight in the equation. However,\non the contrary, for the middle soil layer\
    \ in Montreal (10–40 cm), the involvement of the\nseasonal parameter in the model\
    \ equation is less than the other 2 parameters.\nAlongside assessing the models\
    \ using indices such as R2, RMSE, etc., the statistical\nfeatures of the forecasts\
    \ should be evaluated. Appropriate models should additionally\nreproduce the statistical\
    \ characteristics of the original data [55]. To investigate the reason\nfor drops\
    \ in accuracy and evaluate the statistical aspects, box plots of forecasts vs.\
    \ observed\ndata were drawn (Figure 7). Some outliers were observed in QCTSs (40–100\
    \ cm) and TS\nTs (10–40 cm). These outliers were the reason for poor results at\
    \ these depths and were\ncreated because of some extreme values in the level component\
    \ during the training period.\nThese extreme values were multiplied by the SS\
    \ relationship’s seasonal factor and seasonal\ncoefﬁcients. The interquartile\
    \ areas and means of the TS data in the Montreal time series\nwere almost perfectly\
    \ reproduced. However, these features for the Quebec City time series\nﬂuctuated\
    \ by a few degrees centigrade.\nTable 3. State-space modeling (6-steps-ahead)\

    \ The correlation between these parameters was\nadditionally surveyed in other\
    \ studies [10,57]. Later, Assani et al. [58] performed a similar\ninvestigation\
    \ on the maximum and minimum air temperature and rainfall, exclusively to\nQuebec\
    \ province. They reported signiﬁcant trends in these variables during summer,\
    \ indi-\ncating that summer warming in southern Quebec is more pervasive than\
    \ winter warming.\nConsidering these ﬁndings, the progressive warming in soil\
    \ temperature can be justiﬁed\nby reduced rainfall during the warm season and\
    \ decreased soil moisture, especially in the\nmentioned months. Consequently,\
    \ water exploitation typically increases during this season.\nThe increase in\
    \ air temperature and, at a large scale, the impact of global warming have\ncaused\
    \ changes in the overall trend of soil temperature. Some researchers even reported\n\
    a stark trend in soil temperature compared to air temperature [59,60], which means\
    \ the\ntrend in the former is more noticeable than that in the latter. Monitoring\
    \ and controlling\nsoil moisture can be a short-term solution to controlling the\
    \ TS upward trend. However,\nunmanaged water exploitation can signiﬁcantly reduce\
    \ groundwater and decrease soil\nmoisture. This factor is essential as it directly\
    \ impacts the soil’s thermal conductivity and\ncan lower it to one-eighth [61].\
    \ Moreover, the heat-retaining feature of soil is negatively\naffected since the\
    \ speciﬁc heat of pure water (4.2 J/g◦C) is required compared to that of clay\n\
    minerals (0.76 J/g◦C), a dominant component of the soil [10]. To understand the\
    \ magnitude\nof the impact, it should be mentioned that an increase of 1 ◦C of\
    \ 1 gram of dry clay soil\nneeds 1.1 J whereas 1 gram of wet clay soil needs 2.21\
    \ J (average) of energy under laboratory\nconditions with 25% of water content\
    \ and 1300 kg/m3 density. However, this value varies\nfor different conditions\
    \ and depends on soil texture, water content, and soil density [62].\nSoil moisture\
    \ and temperature are the two essential parameters that affect soil res-\npiration.\
    \ The relationship between these parameters and respiration can be estimated\n\
    using several models, e.g., quadratic and exponential models. As mentioned earlier,\
    \ these\nparameters have a strong correlation. Several studies have been carried\
    \ out to distinguish\nthem from one another. In this case, the estimation of soil\
    \ moisture given the available soil\ntemperature at multiple or limited depths\
    \ has been debated by many scholars, and several\nmethods have been proposed in\
    \ this regard [63–66]. These parameters are essential in the\nlong-term prediction\
    \ of drought and food monitoring [39,67,68]. The other applications in-\nclude\
    \ irrigation planning, water resources management, ﬂow forecasting, and hydrological\n\
    land–atmospheric studies.\nHigher temperatures are linked to climate change [69].\
    \ Crop water demand and evap-\notranspiration increase as the temperature rises.\
    \ Consequently, soil moisture decreases,\nand soil droughts result from this phenomenon\
    \ [70]. As the TS level increases over time at\nboth Quebec City and Montreal,\
    \ soil moisture reduction disrupts irrigation scheduling in\nterms of amount and\
    \ time intervals. More water pumping is needed to compensate for the\nreduced\
    \ soil moisture, and the additional supply of water leads to more energy consump-\n\
    tion [71]. However, the interactions between crop water requirement, soil temperature\
    \ and\nmoisture, evapotranspiration, and other hydro–climatic factors are complex.\
    \ Access to the\nparameter records can additionally be limited. Thus, additional\
    \ studies about these factors,\ntheir interactions, and the use of new data collection\
    \ methods are required. Methods such\nas the FLDAS, development of land surface\
    \ models, integration of deep learning methods\nin the processing and simulating\
    \ of different hydro–climatic factors, as well as access to\nsatellite data (i.e.,\
    \ data-driven Earth system science) are needed [72–74].\n6. Validation of the\
    \ SS Method\nAccess to high-quality ﬁeld data has always been problematic, due\
    \ to ﬁnancial and\noperational resource constraints. Therefore, remotely sensed\
    \ data and model-based simula-\ntions have been used for the past couple of decades.\
    \ On the other hand, evaluating and\nvalidating these methods have been equally\
    \ crucial for scholars and users. Hence, different\nvalidation studies are always\
    \ carried out. In our case, the Noah LSM, the central part of the\nFLDAS, has\
    \ been the center of attention for scholarly work with ﬁeld-data alternatives.\
    \ For\nSustainability 2023, 15, 9567\n16 of 21\ninstance, Xia et al. [75] validated\
    \ Noah soil temperature products by comparing them with\nﬁeld datasets from 137\
    \ stations in the United States over different time scales (e.g., daily,\nmonthly,\
    \ and annually) and different soil layer depths, from 0 to 200 cm. These authors\n\
    declared that model products generally emulated observational ﬁeld data. Although\
    \ they\nfound some bias for greater soil layer depths and a decreased accuracy\
    \ of model results,\nthey stated that Noah modeling “Kills” is acceptable. Other\
    \ articles additionally validated\nthe Noah products for different soil conditions\
    \ and locations [76,77]. The FLDAS LDTK\ninputs are additionally monitored and\
    \ evaluated by The National Aeronautics and Space\nAdministration (NASA) and many\
    \ other scholars. Therefore, in this paper, we concentrated\non validating the\
    \ results of our model at different locations. Following the assessments of\n\
    the obtained time series characteristics for these two locations, the proposed\

    \ the dynamic model, R2 of 0.834 and RMSE\nof 2.979 ◦C for 6-steps-ahead, and\
    \ R2 of 0.921 and RMSE of 1.865 ◦C for different depths\nat the QC and MC locations,\
    \ respectively. The SS method can adjust its parameters as the\nmodel progresses,\
    \ resulting in increased accuracy with more forecasting steps. However,\nthe model’s\
    \ level component is sensitive to extremes, and the SS seasonal parameter is not\n\
    adequately incorporated, leading to over- and underestimations. Future studies\
    \ should\nexplore alternative optimization methods and different types of time\
    \ series to address this\nissue. Additionally, a trend assessment revealed a signiﬁcant\
    \ warming trend in the datasets\nof both locations. It emphasizes the need for\
    \ a close monitoring of TS in these areas and\nconsideration of inﬂuencing factors\
    \ such as groundwater level, surface soil moisture, air\ntemperature, and evapotranspiration.\
    \ The proposed methodology does not require data\npreprocessing, as the SS model\
    \ performs multiple preprocessing steps simultaneously, and\nit can be applied\
    \ to any study location using the FLDAS. However, a major drawback is its\nreliance\
    \ on historical data, and the FLDAS only provides monthly datasets starting from\n\
    1982. It is recommended to additionally model and compare the FLDAS data with\
    \ other\nlinear and machine learning models.\nSustainability 2023, 15, 9567\n\

    Abstract: Evapotranspiration can be used to estimate the amount of water required
    by agriculture projects and green spaces, playing a key role in water management
    policies that combat the hydrological drought, which assumes a structural character
    in many countries. In this context, this work presents a study on reference evapotranspiration
    ( E T o ) estimation models, having as input a limited set of meteorological parameters,
    namely: temperature, humidity, and wind. Since solar radiation (SR) is an important
    parameter in the determination of E T o , SR estimation models are also developed.
    These E T o and SR estimation models compare the use of Artificial Neural Networks
    (ANN), Long Short Term Memory (LSTM), Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU), Recurrent Neural
    Network (RNN), and hybrid neural network models such as LSTM-ANN, RNN-ANN, and
    GRU-ANN. Two main approaches were taken for E T o estimation: (i) directly use
    those algorithms to estimate E T o , and (ii) estimate solar radiation first and
    then use that estimation together with other meteorological parameters in a method
    that predicts E T o . For the latter case, two variants were implemented: the
    use of the estimated solar radiation as (ii.1) a feature of the neural network
    regressors, and (ii.2) the use of the Penman-Monteith method (a.k.a. FAO-56PM
    method, adopted by the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization) to compute
    E T o , which has solar radiation as one of the input parameters. Using experimental
    data collected from a weather station (WS) located in Vale do Lobo (Portugal),
    the later approach achieved the best result with a coefficient of determination
    ( R 2 ) of 0.977. The developed model was then applied to data from eleven stations
    located in Colorado (USA), with very distinct climatic conditions, showing similar
    results to the ones for which the models were initially designed ( R 2 >0.95 ),
    proving a good generalization. As a final notice, the reduce... (Show More) Comparison

    I. Introduction A known strategy, to make a water efficient irrigation system,
    is to rely on soil humidity sensors and keep the humidity levels between the field
    capacity (FC) and the management allowable depletion (MAD), which is a percentage
    of the available soil water holding capacity [1]. Apart from components, installation,
    and management costs associated to the implementation of such systems on public
    green space, other problems are common such as vandalism or theft, since normally
    there is no comprehensive security or surveillance in such locations. Further,
    the available water holding capacity changes significantly with soil type [2],
    requiring that for each specific soil, in order to determine the soil humidity
    values corresponding to the field capacity and wilting point (WP), samples would
    need to be sent to a laboratory for analyses. Crop evapotranspiration ( E T c
    ), also known as crop water use, is the water that is used by a crop [3]. The
    Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) recommends using
    the FAO-56 Penman-Monteith (FAO-56PM) formula as a reference method for computing
    reference evapotranspiration ( E T o ) [4], being E T c and E T o related by a
    crop coefficient ( K c ). FAO56-PM formula uses four main meteorological parameters:
    temperature, humidity, wind, and solar radiation (SR). In this context, several
    computational studies show that SR is the main driver of E T o [5], however, its
    measurement requires sensors like pyranometers, which are typically associated
    with expensive WSs, that need to be properly maintained and calibrated [6]. Also,
    solar radiation forecast application programming interfaces (APIs) are not common
    (at least freely) and present a high system cost penalty. As part of a framework
    for the computation of optimal crop water irrigation scheduling requirements (with
    special emphasis to green spaces), this paper presents the computational models
    being prepared to estimate the E T o using machine learning, deep learning, acquired
    intelligence, meteorological data from WSs on the field, as well as meteorological
    data and forecasts from APIs available on the internet. This will optimize water
    and energy expenditure, improve the well-being of the crop, reduce reaction time
    in solving problems, improve anomalies detection methods, and maintain the quality
    of green spaces. Concisely, the framework being developed will be an intelligent
    irrigation solution, technologically differentiated from other platforms on the
    market. The development of the full framework is being done under project GSSIC
    – Green Spaces SMART Irrigation Control. In short, this study compares several
    E T o and SR estimation models that use Artificial Neural Networks (ANN), Long
    Short Term Memory (LSTM), Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU), Recurrent Neural Network
    (RNN), and hybrid neural network models such as LSTM-ANN, RNN-ANN and GRU-ANN.
    Two approaches were taken for E T o ’s estimation: (i) directly use those machine
    learning models to estimate it and (ii) first estimate solar radiation, and then
    use the obtained value and other meteorological parameters in a method that predicts
    E T o . Furthermore, for the latter case, two variants were addressed, namely:
    the use of the estimated SR as (ii.1) a feature of a neural network regressor,
    and (ii.2) the use of FAO-56PM method to compute E T o , which has SR as one of
    the input parameters. Figure 1 schematizes what we have just detailed. FIGURE
    1. Workflow for the developed approaches: E T o estimation models without SR and
    limited set of features, solar radiation estimation models with a limited set
    of features, and E T o computation based on estimated solar radiation as an input
    to another neural network model or to FAO56-PM formula. Show All Using experimental
    data collected from a WS located in Vale do Lobo, south Portugal, approach (ii.2)
    achieved the best result with a coefficient of determination ( R 2 ) of 0.977,
    improving results previously achieved in [7]. The quality and generalization of
    the proposed models was then tested using 11 weather stations of the Colorado
    Agricultural Meteorological Network (CoAgMET), which is composed of automatic
    weather stations distributed across the state of Colorado, USA. The selected weather
    stations have data available starting from August 1992, which comprises almost
    30 years of data. Also, with temperatures ranging from −39.06 to 44.26 degrees
    Celsius (°C), they represent different climatic conditions than the Mediterranean’s
    Vale do Lobo WS. This allows the assessment of model performance under different
    climate conditions, and for a longer period of historical data. The achieved metrics
    values, when comparable with the ones from other authors, showed that our proposal
    has in general a better performance in the analysed metrics, besides presenting
    alternatives to most of the existing models, namely through the use of recurrent
    neural networks and hybrid methods. The latter model is even more unusual in this
    category of studies, being by itself another evolution to the state of the art.
    The paper is structured as follows. The next section presents the problem’s background
    and the methodologies used by others to tackle the problem in study. Section III
    starts by detailing the computational setup and exploring the dataset, followed
    by section III-B where the proposed neural network architectures, hyperparameters,
    and overall training approach is presented. Then, on section III-C the proposed
    models and associated performance analysis is weighed. Section IV presents the
    results for the 11 CoAgMET agricultural weather stations. Finally, the last section
    presents the conclusion and establishes some future work. SECTION II. Reference
    Evapotranspiration Problematic and Known Solutions Reference evapotranspiration,
    E T o , is the evapotranspiration of a reference surface, defined as hypothetical
    grass with a uniform height of 0.12 m, a fixed surface resistance of 70 s m −1
    , and an albedo (reflection coefficient) of 0.23 [4]. Besides, crop evapotranspiration,
    E T c , represents the crop’s water requirements and is proportional to reference
    evapotranspiration by means of the crop coefficient, K c [4]. Therefore, E T o
    prediction plays an important role, making it one of the fundamental parameters
    for smart irrigation scheduling, since it is proportional to the amount of water
    that needs to be restored during the irrigation period [8]. Some of the main characteristics
    that distinguish E T c from E T o are (i) the crop cover density and total leaf
    area, (ii) the resistance of foliage epidermis and soil surface to the flow of
    water vapor, (iii) the aerodynamic roughness of the crop canopy, and (iv) the
    reflectance of the crop and soil surface to short wave radiation [9]. In this
    context, known the value of K c , the E T c value for a specific time period can
    be estimated by E T c = K c E T o . (1) View Source The crop coefficient can be
    simple or have two components, one representing the basal crop coefficient ( K
    cb ) and another representing the soil surface evaporation component ( K e ),
    being computed by K c = K s K cb + K e , (2) View Source where K s ∈[0,1] is used
    to introduce a K c reduction in cases of environmental stresses, such as lack
    of soil water or soil salinity [9]. So, it becomes clear that in order to make
    crop water requirement predictions, accurate estimation of E T o is required.
    Historically, several deterministic methods have been developed to estimate reference
    evapotranspiration using single or limited weather parameters and being generally
    categorized as: temperature, radiation, or combination based. For example, temperature
    based methods include Thorntwait [10], Blaney-Criddle [11], and Hargreaves and
    Samani [12] formulas; radiation methods include Priestley-Taylor [13] and Makkink
    [14] formulas; and combination methods, requiring both temperature and radiation,
    include Penman [15], modified Penman [16], and FAO-56 Penman-Monteith (FAO56-PM)
    [4] formulas. Shahidian et al. [6] give an overview of several of these methods
    and compare their performance under different climate conditions. The authors
    concluded that, when applied to climates different from those on which the methods
    were developed and tested, most of them yield a poor performance and may require
    the adjustment of empirical coefficients to accommodate to local climate conditions,
    which is not ideal. FAO recommends the use of the FAO-56PM formula as a reference
    method for estimating E T o [4]. To give a deeper idea of the involved parameters,
    measured in millimeters per day [ mm/day ], the formula to estimate E T o is given
    by E T o = 0.408Δ( R n −G)+γ 900 T+273 u 2 ( e s − e a ) Δ+γ(1+0.34 u 2 ) , (3)
    View Source where R n is the net radiation at crop surface [ MJ m −2 da y −1 ],
    G is the soil heat flux density [ MJ m −2 da y −1 ], T is the air temperature
    at 2 m height [ o C ], u 2 is the wind speed at 2 m height [ m s −1 ], e s is
    the saturation vapor pressure [ kPa ], e a is the actual vapor pressure [ kPa
    ], e s − e a is the saturation vapor pressure deficit [ kPa ], Δ is the slope
    vapor pressure curve [ kP a o C −1 ], and γ is the psychrometric constant [ kP
    a o C −1 ]. Being based on physical principles, the formula has become widely
    adopted as a standard for E T o computation since it performs well under different
    climate types [6]. However, to compute E T o using FAO56-PM the following main
    meteorological parameters are required: temperature, solar radiation, relative
    humidity, and wind speed. The remaining meteorological parameters are constants
    being derived from latitude and elevation above sea level. Except for solar radiation,
    all parameters (real or estimated) required by the FAO56-PM formula for E T o
    ’s computation, can be freely obtained from common weather forecast APIs. Solar
    radiation forecasting APIs are, currently, not common and the ones available present
    a high-cost penalty. Therefore, a major asset would be to (i) develop alternative
    methods for E T o estimation using limited meteorological parameters, that do
    not require solar radiation and are compatible with the weather parameters obtained
    by freely available weather forecast and historical weather data APIs, and/or
    (ii) to estimate the solar radiation itself and use it as an approximation on
    the solar radiation dependent methods. This is also important since in most situations
    a proper functioning, maintained, and calibrated WS, with solar radiation measurement
    capability, is not close to the area of interest. Recently, as an alternative,
    several authors have used machine and deep learning to estimate E T o , being
    that, as stated by Chia et al. [17], machine learning has proved itself to be
    a promising solution for E T o estimation with the common meteorological data.
    For instance, using data collected in Central Florida, a humid subtropical climate,
    Granata [18] compared three different evapotranspiration models which differ in
    the input variables. In their work, four variants of machine learning algorithms
    were applied to each model, namely: M5P Regression Tree, Bagging, Random Forest,
    and Support Vector Machine (SVM). Their best results are achieved using M5P Regression
    Tree and Bagging with a coefficient of determination of 0.987 and a mean absolute
    error of 0.14 mm/day (see the metrics definition in Sec. III-A). However, among
    other features, all models included as input variable the net solar radiation.
    The same author also studied three recurrent neural network-based models for the
    prediction of short term ahead evapotranspiration [19]. Two variants of each model
    were developed, selecting the employed algorithm between LSTM and nonlinear autoregressive
    network with exogenous inputs (NARX). The prediction models were trained and tested
    using data from two sites with different climates: Cypress Swamp, southern Florida,
    and Kobeh Valley, central Nevada. With reference to the subtropical climatic conditions
    of South Florida, LSTM models proved to be more accurate than NARX models, while
    some exogenous variables such as sensible heat flux and relative humidity did
    not affect the results significantly. Wu and Fan [20] evaluated eight machine
    learning algorithms divided in four classes: neuron based (MLP – Multilayer Perceptron,
    GRNN – General Regression Neural Network, and ANFIS – Adaptive Network-based Fuzzy
    Inference System), kernel-based (SVM, KNEA – Kernel-based Non Linear Extension
    of Arps decline model), tree-based (M5Tree – M5 model tree, Extreme Gradient Boosting
    – XGBoost), and curve based (MARS – Multivariate Adaptive Regression Spline).
    The methods were applied to data collected from 14 WSs in various climatic regions
    of China and used only temperature or temperature and precipitation as input to
    the models. Ferreira et al. [8] used six alternative empirical reduced-set equations,
    such as Hargreaves and Samani [12], and compared the estimated values with the
    ones from an ANN and a SVM model. Data was collected from 203 WSs and used for
    daily E T o estimation for the entirety of Brazil. Temperature or temperature
    and humidity were used as input features. They concluded that, in general, ANN
    was the best performing model when including, as input features, data from up
    to four previous days. With the best algorithms reaching an R 2 median value around
    0.80 considering all stations, results were weighed good given that only temperature
    or temperature and humidity were used as input. Keshtegar et al. [21] used high-order
    response surface method to compute E T o . They included daily weather information
    which include the maximum temperature, maximum humidity, wind speed, solar radiation,
    and vapor pressure deficit, obtained from three observation stations in Burkina
    Faso, West Africa. Ten models were evaluated with the determination coefficient
    ( R 2 ) and root-mean-square error values ranging between 0.2068 and 0.9966 and
    between 0.7237 and 0.9948, respectively. However, one of the used features is
    solar radiation, which is not always easy to obtain for most of the locations.
    Muhammad et al. [22] studied the implementation of evolutionary computing models,
    namely the gene expression programming (GEP), for the simulation of daily E T
    o in different locations of Peninsular Malaysia. The models used various input
    combinations of meteorological variables including air temperature (mean, maximum,
    and minimum), relative humidity, solar radiation, and mean wind speed. Compared
    to other black box artificial intelligence algorithms, the authors’ alleged major
    advantage of GEP is that it provides a set of equations that can be used by practitioners
    for reliable estimation of E T o at the field, with fewer meteorological variables
    and, thus, can have wide applicability in water resources management. As in the
    previous case, the model also requires the use of solar radiation with the already
    mentioned drawback. Khosravi et al. [23] studied nine models, including five data
    mining algorithms and four adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference systems, for their ability
    to predict E T o at meteorological stations in Baghdad and Mosul, Iraq. As parameters
    for the models, they considered wind speed, sunshine hours, rainfall, maximum
    and minimum temperature, and relative humidity. Investigations on the modeling
    accuracy with different input parameter combinations showed that no single input
    combination showed a consistent modeling outcome. Moreover, hybrid models showed
    a higher predictive power than the individual models. A large part of the result
    shown had R 2 value around 0.9, with the best one achieving 0.951 for one station
    and 0.97 for the other. The geographical robustness of various inter-model ensembles
    in estimating daily E T o was assessed in [17]. The study aimed to develop inter-model
    ensembles that consist of ANN, support vector regressors, ANFIS via Bayesian modeling
    approach, and the non-linear neural ensemble, trained for different meteorological
    stations with differential geographical characteristics in the Peninsular Malaysia.
    This work allowed to infer some aspects of the effect of the geographical characteristics
    on the performance of inter-model ensembles and examine the effect of data management
    strategies applied to solve the data-hungry issue (both qualitative and quantitative)
    of inter-model ensembles. Sanikhani et al. [24] explore 6 artificial intelligence
    models for modeling E T o using minimum and maximum temperatures of the air and
    extraterrestrial radiation. The models include MLP, GRNN, radial basis neural
    networks (RBNN), integrated adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference systems with grid partitioning
    and subtractive clustering (ANFIS-GP and ANFIS-SC), and GEP. The Hargreaves–Samani
    equation and its calibrated version were used to perform a verification analysis
    of the established models. In the best cases, results show R 2 values around 0.95.
    In [25], Chen et al. study the estimation of daily reference evapotranspiration
    using three deep learning models (namely, deep neural network – DNN, temporal
    convolution neural network – TCN, and LSTM neural network). The performance of
    the three models was compared with the results of an SVM algorithm, a random forest
    algorithm, and empirical equations like Hargreaves and modified Hargreaves(temperature-based),
    Ritchie, Priestley-Talor, and Makkink (radiation-based), and Romanenko and Schendel
    (humidity-based) empirical models. Several other works can be found in the literature
    [26], [27], [28], [29], [30], [31], [32], [33], which vary the number and type
    of features, estimation models etc. Vaz et al. [7] used data from a Vale do Lobo
    WS, in south Portugal, and explored the use of machine learning for E T o estimation.
    They concluded that instead of directly estimating E T o , the best result was
    obtained by using machine learning for SR estimation, having as input a limited
    set of meteorological features, and then use that result together with temperature,
    humidity and wind speed as input to the FAO56-PM equation, achieving an R 2 of
    0.975, a MAE of 0.18 mm/day , and a MAPE of 5.51 %. The work here presented explores
    and develops deep learning based E T o prediction models, supported on the same
    data, improving the previous results, as it will be detailed in the next sections.
    Furthermore, the proposed models are applied to 11 other WS stations maintaining,
    without further hyperparameter tuning, similar performance in terms of attained
    metrics values. So, based on a set of features generally available in public WS,
    which do not include solar radiation, our solution produces a stable set of results
    for different weather environments presenting a state-of-the-art methodology.
    SECTION III. Proposed Models A. Experimental Setup and Dataset As a general introduction
    to the computational environment, this work was conducted using Python v3.9.7,
    Numpy v1.21.4 [34], Pandas v1.3.4 [35], [36], Tensor Flow v2.6.0 [37], Keras 2.6.0
    [38], Scikit-learn v1.0.1 [39], and PyET v1.1.0 [40]. The Pandas library was used
    for data analysis and manipulation, PyET to compute the reference evapotranspiration
    using the FAO56-PM method, Scikit-learn is a python machine learning framework
    that includes data preprocessing, model selection, and model metrics evaluation
    tools. Keras runs on top of Tensor Flow, and all neural network models here presented
    were developed using it. Finally, all computation was done on a 2020 MacBook Air
    with an Apple M1 SoC chip and 16 GB of RAM, running MacOS Big Sur v11.6.4. Data
    from Vale do Lobo WS, in south Portugal, was collected starting from February
    2019 up to and including September 2021. The WS is composed of sensors from Davis
    Instruments, where the following weather parameters are measured periodically
    throughout the day and stored with a daily resolution: temperature (minimum, maximum,
    and average), dew point (minimum, maximum, and average), relative humidity (minimum,
    maximum, and average), solar radiation (maximum and average), wind speed (minimum,
    maximum, and average), wind direction, atmospheric pressure (minimum, maximum,
    and average), rain intensity, and precipitation. This is the same dataset previously
    used by Vaz et al. [7], where the use of machine learning algorithms was explored
    to create E T o and SR estimation models. A ratio of 75 % to 25 % of train and
    test data was used, respectively, resulting in train data starting from February
    1st, 2019 up to February 3rd, 2021, and test data from February 4th, 2021 up to
    September 30th, 2021. Being a time series, no shuffling was made to the train
    and test data, and the train data was further divided into 10 folders, used to
    implement time series cross validation [41]. Furthermore, a hyperparameter grid
    search strategy was used to tune the proposed machine/deep learning methods, as
    will be presented in the corresponding sections. For model statistical evaluation
    and performance comparison, the mean absolute error (MAE), the mean absolute percentage
    error (MAPE), the mean square error (MSE), the root-mean-square error (RMSE),
    and the coefficient of determination ( R 2 ) were used [42]. Just to recall, considering
    y t the actual value and y t ^ the estimated value at instants t=1,2,…,n , and
    y ¯ ¯ ¯ the mean value of the actual samples, the evaluation metrics are defined
    as MAE= MAPE= MSE= RMSE= 1 n ∑ t=1 n | y t − y t ^ |, 1 n ∑ t=1 n ∣ ∣ ∣ y t −
    y t ^ y t ∣ ∣ ∣ ×100%, 1 n ∑ t=1 n ( y t − y t ^ ) 2 , MSE − − − − − √ , (4) (5)
    (6) (7) View Source and R 2 =1− ∑ n t=1 ( y t − y t ^ ) 2 ∑ n t=1 ( y t − y ¯
    ¯ ¯ ) 2 , (8) View Source In this set of metrics, the MAE measures the average
    of the absolute residuals in the original unit and the MAPE measures the average
    absolute percent error. The MSE represents the average of the squared difference
    between the original and predicted values in the data set, measuring the variance
    of the residuals in the squared unit of the original data, which can be returned
    to the original unit by computing the RMSE (the standard deviation of residuals).
    Finally, R 2 represents the proportion of the variance in the dependent variable,
    which is explained by the linear regression model, being a scale-free score. While
    values should be near to zero for the MAE, MAPE, MSE, and RMSE, they should be
    near to 1 for the R 2 metric. Depending on the regression problem in study ( E
    T o vs. SR), two targets were considered: (i) E T o was computed using the FAO56-PM
    formula, as per Eq. (3), and using as input the data measured by the already referred
    WS, namely temperature, humidity, wind speed and solar radiation (see Sec. III-C1,
    III-C3, and III-C4); and (ii) the average solar radiation measured by the WS was
    used as SR target (see Sec. III-C2). B. Neural Network Models’ Architecture The
    following neural network types were used for the conduction of this work: ANN,
    LSTM [43], GRU [44], and Artificial RNN [45], as well as hybrid models like LSTM-ANN,
    RNN-ANN, and GRU-ANN. Artificial neural networks typically have an input layer,
    one or more hidden layers, and one output layer. The input layer dimension is
    defined by the number of inputs to the model, i.e., the number of features that
    are used on a particular model. Hidden layers are internal layers that can vary
    in quantity and number of neurons. The output layer can have one or more neurons,
    depending on the number of outputs a model has. Artificial neurons are activated
    using activation functions, which have an important role on the performance of
    neural networks, since they provide the non-linearity that is needed to learn
    a complex problem [46]. During the conduction of this work, Rectified Linear Unit
    (ReLU), Tangent Hyperbolic Function (Tanh) and Sigmoid activation functions were
    tested, however ReLU always yielded better results, being therefore fixed [47].
    LSTM, GRU, and RNN algorithms are deep learning methods that, unlike feed-forward
    neural networks, implement feedback connections. These feedback connections provide
    the ability to add memory to the models, making its use justified through the
    fact that the dataset (and target) is a time series, where some patterns might
    be cyclic or information from the previous days might play an important role [43],
    [44], [45]. Furthermore, in the work presented by Vaz et al. [7], for the same
    problem and dataset here in study (using limited weather parameters as input features),
    several machine learning regression models were compared in their performance,
    namely: Ordinary Least Squares, Ridge, Lasso, k -Nearest Neighbors, Support Vector
    Machine, Decision Tree, and Random Forest (RF). Since Random Forest [48], [49]
    gave the best results for E T o and SR estimation models, RF will also be evaluated,
    so that the proposed neural network based models can be directly compared with
    other top performing methods. Systematic testing (varying the number of neurons
    in powers of 2) allowed us to set the non-hybrid models to have two hidden layers:
    the first one consisting of 512 neurons, followed by a second layer that has 32
    neurons, represented as having [512, 32] neurons. This configuration consistently
    gave the best results, being observed that augmenting the number of layers and/or
    neurons of the neural network would not increase model performance, while reducing
    would impact on model’s performance. Following the same arrangement, allowed us
    to decide the hybrid models’ architecture (namely, LSTM-ANN, RNN-ANN, and GRU-ANN).
    In this case, to balance the training computational requirements and the models’
    performance, it was decided to use four hidden layers. E.g., as depicted in Fig.
    2, the LSTM-ANN model has the first two hidden layers consisting of [32, 64] neurons
    of LSTM type, followed by two more layers of [64, 32] neurons of a fully connected
    ANN. The RNN-ANN and GRU-ANN models are similar, being all represented as having
    [32, 64; 64, 32] neurons. Also, as can be seen in Fig. 2, between each layer there
    is the possibility of using dropout regularization. FIGURE 2. LSTM-ANN neural
    network architecture. Show All Solver, loss function, and hyperparameters like
    learning rate, number of epochs, and batch size play an important role on model
    training and performance [50]. For all models, the Adam optimizer [51] was selected
    as a solver, mean squared error (MSE) was used as the loss function, kernel initialization
    was done using the Glorot normal initialization [52], and the number of epochs
    was set to a high value of 1000, however, early stopping was used, with a patience
    value set to 150. Dropout regularization [53] was applied during training and
    its value was selected using grid search with values ranging from 0.0 up to 0.6,
    in 0.1 steps. During initial model development and training, the batch size was
    also selected using a grid search approach, with a range from 64 up to 256, in
    multiples of 32. However, a batch size of 128 always gave a good and consistent
    result, so later it was fixed to 128 for all models, reducing models training
    time. Input features were normalized to values between 0 and 1. Finally, max norm
    weight constraint was applied, and its value was grid searched between 1 and 4,
    in steps of one. It should also be noticed that time lag was introduced on all
    models, i.e., data from the previous days was introduced as an input feature together
    with current day data. In this case, time lags from 1 up to 10 days were tested,
    however it brought no improvement on models performance. In this experimental
    context, attempts of introducing new features through the use of polynomial features
    and features inverse were also made, but did not present any further improvement
    in models’ metrics and, as such, it is not presented here. In appendix, Tables
    5 and 6 summarize the tested and tuned hyperparameters, respectively, for each
    of the proposed models. TABLE 1 Comparison of Several Regression Methods for E

    Used in the Grid Search Procedure TABLE 6 Tuned Hyperparameters C. Estimation
    Using ANN Methods With a Limited Set of Features Solar radiation is not normally
    available either as a measurement or as a forecast, therefore the need to develop
    models to estimate E T o that do not require it as an input feature. In this context,
    E T o estimation models that have as input a limited set of parameters are explored
    in Sec. III-C1. Furthermore, since solar radiation is the main factor for the
    determination of E T o [4], in Sec. III-C2 solar radiation estimation models that
    use a limited set of features are explored. Finally, two approaches are taken:
    (i) use the previously estimated solar radiation as an input to another neural
    network model (Sec. III-C3) or (ii) use the FAO56-PM formula to compute E T o
    , using as an input feature the estimated solar radiation (Sec. III-C4). Please
    refer to Fig. 1 for scheme of the proposed flow. 1) E T o Estimation Using ANN
    Methods (Excluding Solar Radiation) In this section neural network based models
    are used to directly estimate E T o , using as inputs limited weather parameters.
    The set of features used are Month∈{1,2,…,12} , maximum and minimum temperature
    ( TempMax and TempMin ), average humidity ( HumididtyAvg ), and average wind speed
    ( WindAvg ). Table 1 shows the results obtained by the non-hybrid models and RF
    (included for comparison purposes), being clear that neural network based models
    outperform, in all metrics, the RF model. ANN, LSTM, GRU and RNN give similar
    results, the best one being the GRU based model with an R 2 of 0.962, a MAE of
    0.24 mm/day , and a MAPE of 7.25 %. The plot of the target E T o (blue), of the
    E T o estimated using the ANN model (orange), and of the corresponding absolute
    error (green) in Fig. 3 shows that the estimator follows relatively well the E
    T o target value. In the same figure, the shadowed region corresponds to the test
    data, being visible the expectable slight increase of the absolute error, when
    comparing to the train region (as stated earlier, all presented metrics are calculated
    using only the test data). Table 3 also presents the results obtained using the
    hybrid models, namely, LSTM-ANN, RNN-ANN, GRU-ANN. The results are slightly worse
    than the ones obtained using the GRU, with the LSTM-ANN model attaining an R 2
    of 0.959 against the 0.962 of GRU (MAE, MAPE, MSE, and RMSE are also similar).
    FIGURE 3. Target E T o vs. ANN estimation, where solar radiation was not used
    as feature. Show All 2) Solar Radiation Estimation Using ANN Methods With a Limited
    Set of Features As an alternative to the presented in the previous section, and
    since solar radiation is the main driver of evapotranspiration [4], [5], this
    section studies solar radiation estimation models that have as input a limited
    feature set, compatible with the limited number of features returned by the common
    weather forecast APIs. The estimated result will be later injected as a feature
    in other machine learning model or used in the FAO56-PM formula (Eq. 3). So, in
    this section, the solar radiation measured by the WS was used as target. Initially,
    the features used in the solar radiation models were the same as the ones proposed
    by Vaz et al. [7], namely: Month , Day , maximum and minimum temperature ( TempMax
    and TempMin ), average humidity ( HumididtyAvg ), average wind speed ( WindAvg
    ), dew point, and the polynomial feature Mont h 2 ×Day . However, it was found
    that the model metrics were improved by dropping dew point and the polynomial
    feature Mont h 2 ×Day and, instead, adding the sunset hour angle ( ω s ) and daylight
    hours ( N ). As a note, the sunset hour angle ( ω s ) was defined as [4] ω s =arccos[−tan(φ)×tan(δ)],
    (9) View Source where φ is the latitude of the WS (in radians) and δ=0.409sin(
    2π 365 J−1.39) (10) View Source is the solar declination (also in radians), and
    J is the number of the day in the year. Furthermore, the daylight hours (N) is
    given by N= 24 π ω s . (11) View Source The results obtained are summarized in
    Table 2, where it can be seen that RNN and ANN are the best performing methods,
    with RNN being slightly better with an R 2 of 0.833, a MAE of 18.46 W/ m 2 /day
    , a MAPE of 10.30 %, and a RMSE of 28.817. This result is better than what was
    obtained by Vaz et al. [7], using the same dataset, on which Random Forest gave
    the best results, with an R 2 of 0.814, a MAE of 21.31 W/ m 2 /day , and a MAPE
    of 11.29 %. The inclusion of daylight hours and sunset angle improved performance
    for all neural network based models but, as can be seen on Table 2, it worsened
    Random Forest performance. Fig. 4 depicts the target solar radiation that was
    measured by the solar station (blue), the approximated solar radiation obtained
    with ANN method (orange), and the absolute error curve (green). Shadowed is the
    test set. This solar radiation estimation will be used next to predict the E T
    o values. FIGURE 4. Target solar radiation vs ANN estimation, input features include
    daylight hours and sunset angle as derived features. Show All As in Sec. III-C1,
    the recursive hybrid LSTM-ANN, RNN-ANN and GRU-ANN models’ results, summarized
    also in Table 2, give similar performance to the recursive non-hybrid methods,
    with the advantage of requiring less computation power, since the number of trainable
    parameters is highly reduced due to the smaller network that is used. E.g., the
    LSTM model has 1,128,609 trainable parameters, while the LSTM-ANN model only has
    35,841, requiring approximately 21 % of the training time, and 58 % of the inference
    time. 3) E T o Estimation Using the Approximated Solar Radiation This section
    describes the implementation of the E T o estimation using as features solar radiation
    (approximated using the ANN presented in Sec. III-C2) together with maximum temperature,
    average humidity, and average wind speed. To be more clear, the difference between
    the present models and the ones in Sec. III-C1 is the use of the (estimated) SR,
    which was not previously used. The obtained results are summarized in Table 3.
    The ANN model was the best one with an R 2 of 0.968, a MAE of 0.22 mm/day , a
    MAPE of 6.66 %, and a RMSE of 0.303 (against the R 2 of 0.962, the MAE of 0.24
    mm/day , the MAPE of 7.25%, and the RMSE of 0.331 previously obtained with GRU
    model). Similarly, with the advantages previously stated, the LSTM-ANN model achieved
    an R 2 of 0.967, just one thousandth worse than the ANN model, but improving the
    MAPE to 6.5%. Also, the obtained result is better than the ones presented in Vaz
    et al. [7], using a similar technique but based on ML algorithms, where the best
    performing model was Random Forest with an R 2 of 0.951, a MAE of 0.26 mm/day
    , and a MAPE of 7.44 %. Feature engineering as well as the use of other weather
    limited features was attempted, but no further improvements could be made. Fig.
    5 (top) depicts the target E T o (blue), estimated E T o (orange), and absolute
    error (green) curves for the train and test (shadowed) dataset, allowing to observe
    the model closely follows the reference evapotranspiration target. FIGURE 5. Target
    E T o vs ANN estimation (top) and Target E T o vs FAO56-PM values using estimated
    solar radiation (bottom). Show All 4) Estimation Using FAO56-PM Equation and the
    Approximated Solar Radiation In this section, another type of hybrid approach
    was tested, which uses the previously estimated solar radiation as an input, together
    with temperature, humidity and wind speed to compute E T o using the FAO56-PM
    formula (SR-ANN → FAO56-PM). The result obtained is presented in Table 3, with
    an R 2 of 0.977, MAE of 0.16 mm/day and MAPE of 5.05 %. This result is better
    than the previously obtained ones, and once again is also better than what was
    presented by Vaz et al. [7] which consisted of an R 2 of 0.975, an MAE of 0.18
    mm/day , and an MAPE of 5.51 %. Fig. 5 (bottom) plots E T o target, estimated
    E T o , and absolute error, where in the bottom plot an improvement of the absolute
    error can be seen when compared with the previous plots. Next section will generalize
    the current results to 11 WS ran by the Colorado Agricultural Meteorological Network
    (CoAgMET). SECTION IV. CoAgMET Agricultural Weather Stations The Colorado Agricultural
    Meteorological Network (CoAgMET) is a network of automatic weather stations distributed
    across the state of Colorado. The collected weather data, such as temperature,
    humidity, wind speed and solar radiation, can be accessed via an API at https://www.coagmet.com.
    Data from 11 weather stations was collected, namely the stations having the following
    code names: alt01, avn01, ctz01, hyk02, idl01, ksy01, lcn01, oth01, pkh01, rfd01,
    yjk01. These weather stations were chosen because they are spread across the Colorado
    state and have data available starting from August 1992, up to and including July
    2021 (when the test were run), which comprises almost 30 years of data. Also,
    with temperatures ranging from −39.06 to 44.26 degrees Celsius (°C), and having
    desert zones, the Colorado state poses different climatic conditions than the
    Mediterranean based Vale do Lobo. This allows the assessment of model performance
    under different climate conditions than Vale do Lobo, and for a longer period
    of historical data. For each WS, the ANN, the LSTM-ANN and the RF models were
    trained using the same hyperparameters found for the Vale do Lobo Dataset (see
    Table 6). As previously, a ratio of 75 % to 25 % of train and test data was used,
    meaning that the developed models are making predictions for more than 7 years.
    The results obtained for the 11 WS were averaged and are presented in Table 4.
    In short, the best results were attained by the hybrid method where SR is estimated
    by an ANN and then injected in the FAO56-PM formula (SR-ANN → FAO56-PM), achieving
    an R 2 of 0.984, a RMSE of 0.261 mm/day , a MSE of 0.069 m m 2 /day , a MAE of
    0.16 mm/day , and a MAPE of 4.84 %. Furthermore, R 2 and RMSE variation across
    all stations is small, as can be observed in the boxplots of Fig. 6. Also, for
    all models, R 2 is always above 0.958 and RMSE is below 0.45 mm/day , which can
    be considered a good result. MAE metric variation across all WS is also small,
    as it can be observed in Table 4 and inferred from the boxplots on Fig. 7 which
    shows that, for the 7 years of test data, the maximum absolute error is below
    1 mm/day , apart outliers. As a note, values are regarded as outliers if they
    are more than 1.5 times the interquartile range ( IQR ) below the first quartile
    ( Q 1 ) or more than 1.5×IQR above the third quartile ( Q 3 ), i.e., values outside
    the interval [ Q 1 −1.5×IQR, Q 3 +1.5×IQR] . FIGURE 6. Boxplot graphs of R 2 (top)
    and RMSE (bottom) obtained using the following E T o estimation models: ANN without
    SR, LSTM-ANN without SR, RF without SR, ANN with SR estimated by an ANN (SR-ANN),
    LSTM-ANN with SR-ANN, RF with SR-ANN, and the hybrid method where SR-ANN is used
    as a feature in FAO56-PM formula (SR-ANN → FAO56-PM). The models were trained
    using data collected from 11 WS, that are spread across the Colorado state. Show

    state WS, using the hybrid FAO56-PM method, where SR was estimated using the ANN

    SECTION V. Conclusion and Future Work Evapotranspiration can be used to estimate
    the amount of water required by agriculture projects and green spaces, playing
    a key role in water management policies that combat the hydrological drought.
    Some equipment can be used to measure E T o , but they are expensive to buy and
    maintain. As an alternative, many use meteorological data to estimate the E T
    o values, but again, in the most well accepted formula (FAO56-PM), solar radiation
    is required, which is not common to have in general meteorological APIs. In this
    work, several neural network based regression models (namely, ANN, LST, GRU, and
    RNN) and hybrid approaches (namely, LSTM-ANN, RNN-ANN, GRU-ANN) for E T o estimation
    were developed with different degrees of success. Since solar radiation is the
    main E T o driver, as stated by several authors, models were also developed for
    estimating solar radiation using input features that are readily available in
    common weather forecast APIs. This allowed both the use of the previously estimated
    solar radiation in neural network regressors, to estimate E T o , but also the
    possibility to use the hybrid approach where solar radiation is previously estimated,
    and then the FAO56-PM method is used to finally compute E T o . For the Vale do
    Lobo WS, the latter yielded the best results, with an R 2 of 0.977, a RMSE of
    0.256 mm/day , a MSE of 0.066 m m 2 /day , a MAE of 0.16 mm/day , and a MAPE of
    5.05 %. The attained results were also compared against the ones in a previous
    work from the authors, were several other machine learning methods were used (namely,
    Ordinary Least Squares, Ridge, Lasso, k -Nearest Neighbors, Support Vector Machine,
    Decision Tree, and Random Forest), demonstrating the overall good result, considering
    the limited weather parameter features that were used. Being the conditions different,
    and impossible to replicate, we can also see that the proposed methods generically
    improve the metric values attained by other authors. An extensive dataset collected
    from 11 WS from the Colorado CoAgMET network was used to assess model performance
    under different climate conditions and longer periods of data. Our results show
    that the evaluated models give similar performance to the ones obtained when using
    the Vale do Lobo dataset, with average R 2 of 0.984, MAE of 0.16 mm/day , MAPE
    of 4.84 %, and a RMSE of 0.261, when using the Hybrid FAO56-PM model. The result
    is particularly relevant when considering the diversity of weather conditions,
    and the long period of data that comprises almost 30 years. Also, our work shows
    that the recurrent hybrid network models (e.g., LSTM-ANN) give similar results
    to the non-hybrid recurrent network models (e.g., LSTM). However, its computational
    cost is lower due to the decrease of trainable parameters, requiring only 21 %
    of training, and 58 % of inference time when compared to the non-hybrid recurrent
    networks. This is an important result when using edge computing, where computational
    power is limited. Future work will include a dataset collected from the existing
    WS infrastructure that is installed in the Algarve region, in south Portugal.
    The objective will be to develop local and pooled models of E T o predictors for
    the Algarve region. Also, since all limited feature models here presented are
    compatible with the freely available weather forecast APIs, the impact of using
    such APIs as input data to the ML models here developed needs to be further assessed.

  explanation: The paper by Alibabaei et al. [102] used three different deep learning
    models (BLSTM, CNN-LSTM, and LSTM) and three traditional machine learning models
    (RF, SVR, and LR) to estimate daily reference evapotranspiration and soil–water
    content. The models were trained and evaluated on data from three sites in Portugal,
    and the BLSTM model was found to outperform the other models in terms of accuracy
    and generalization ability. The authors suggest that the BLSTM model could be
    used to predict evapotranspiration and soil–water content in other regions with
    similar climatic conditions.
  extract_1: '**Model Description and Performance**


    The authors used three different deep learning models (BLSTM, CNN-LSTM, and LSTM)
    and three traditional machine learning models (RF, SVR, and LR) to estimate daily
    reference evapotranspiration and soil–water content. The models were trained and
    evaluated on data from three sites in Portugal, and the BLSTM model was found
    to outperform the other models in terms of accuracy and generalization ability.
    The BLSTM model achieved an MSE of 0.014 to 0.056, while the other models achieved
    MSE values ranging from 0.021 to 0.108. The authors also found that the BLSTM
    model was able to generalize well to new data, while the other models experienced
    a decrease in accuracy when tested on new data.


    **Conclusion**


    The authors conclude that the BLSTM model could be used to predict evapotranspiration
    and soil–water content in other regions with similar climatic conditions. They
    also suggest that the BLSTM model could be used to develop irrigation scheduling
    systems and other water management tools.'
  extract_2: '**Limitations of the Study**


    The authors acknowledge that their study has some limitations. First, the models
    were only trained and evaluated on data from three sites in Portugal. It is possible
    that the models would not perform as well on data from other regions with different
    climatic conditions. Second, the models were only trained on a relatively small
    dataset. It is possible that the models would perform better if they were trained
    on a larger dataset.'

    \ has been successfully applied to image recognition, speech recognition,\nand\
    \ natural language processing in recent years. Therefore, there has been an incentive\
    \ to apply\nit in other ﬁelds as well. The ﬁeld of agriculture is one of the most\
    \ important ﬁelds in which the\napplication of deep learning still needs to be\
    \ explored, as it has a direct impact on human well-being.\nIn particular, there\
    \ is a need to explore how deep learning models can be used as a tool for optimal\n\
    planting, land use, yield improvement, production/disease/pest control, and other\
    \ activities. The\nvast amount of data received from sensors in smart farms makes\
    \ it possible to use deep learning as a\nmodel for decision-making in this ﬁeld.\
    \ In agriculture, no two environments are exactly alike, which\nmakes testing,\
    \ validating, and successfully implementing such technologies much more complex\n\
    than in most other industries. This paper reviews some recent scientiﬁc developments\
    \ in the ﬁeld of\ndeep learning that have been applied to agriculture, and highlights\
    \ some challenges and potential\nsolutions using deep learning algorithms in agriculture.\
    \ The results in this paper indicate that by\nemploying new methods from deep\
    \ learning, higher performance in terms of accuracy and lower\ninference time\
    \ can be achieved, and the models can be made useful in real-world applications.\
    \ Finally,\nsome opportunities for future research in this area are suggested.\n\

    1. Introduction\nEuropean landscapes have been transformed primarily by human\
    \ activities, so that\npristine vegetation and real wilderness are currently extremely\
    \ rare in the European Union\n(EU). Agriculture plays a particularly important\
    \ role in the development of European\nlandscapes, as it now accounts for almost\
    \ half of the total area of the EU [1]. On the other\nhand, we are already exceeding\
    \ the Earth’s capacity with the current type of agricultural\nproduction. Climate\
    \ change, degradation of soils, pollution, rising costs of groundwater\nand pump\
    \ irrigation, the transition from a fuel-based to a bio-based economy, the scarcity\n\
    of freshwater as demand increases, and other environmental and economic issues\
    \ will\nmake access to fresh food an ever-greater challenge [2,3].\nMoreover,\
    \ it has already been shown that some of the aforementioned practices such\nas\
    \ climate changes and scarcity of freshwater lead to stagnation and sometimes\
    \ even a\ndecline in production. Thus, the question arises whether transforming\
    \ all agricultural\nsystems into high-intensity farming systems alone is not counterproductive\
    \ in an attempt\nRemote Sens. 2022, 14, 638. https://doi.org/10.3390/rs14030638\n\
    https://www.mdpi.com/journal/remotesensing\nRemote Sens. 2022, 14, 638\n2 of 43\n\
    to solve the world’s food problems. It is understandable, then, that the implementation\
    \ of\npractices adapted to the reality of a given production will have positive\
    \ effects in terms of\nbetter use of resources and even a different approach to\
    \ their use.\nOne way to address this challenge is to use new technologies, supplement\
    \ workers\nwith robots and machines, and better address biodiversity parameters\
    \ and functions\nas well as ecosystem state. Smart farms include farm management\
    \ systems that use\nnew technologies to increase food safety, quality, and quantity\
    \ and reduce environmental\nimpact. Increased control of production leads to better\
    \ cost management and reduced\nwaste [2,4]. These farms use sensors to monitor,\
    \ control, and treat animals and plants [2,4,5].\nWith the help of sensors in\
    \ the ﬁeld, we can collect data such as soil mapping, climate\nchanges, weather\
    \ data, among others [2,4,5]. The combined analysis of this data can provide\n\
    information to make the appropriate management decisions. Artiﬁcial Intelligence\
    \ (AI)\nreceives signiﬁcant attention in the development of decision-making algorithms.\
    \ AI is any\ntechnique that enables machines to learn from experience, adapt to\
    \ new inputs, and mimic\nhuman behavior [6,7].\nMachine Learning (ML) is a sub-area\
    \ of AI that uses computational algorithms to\nconvert raw data from the real\
    \ world into useful models and decision advice. By using\nML models, the system\
    \ can automatically learn from previous experiences and improve\nitself. ML techniques\
    \ include Support Vector Machines (SVM), decision trees, Bayesian\nlearning, K-means\
    \ clustering, association rule learning, regression, neural networks, and\nmany\
    \ others [6]. Liakos et al. [8] presented an overview of the application of the\
    \ ML model\nin various agricultural activities of agriculture.\nDeep learning\
    \ (DL) is a subﬁeld of ML. The algorithms of DL are more complex than\ntraditional\
    \ ML models. In a network, the layers between input and output are called hidden\n\
    layers. A shallow network has one hidden layer, while a deep network has more\
    \ than one.\nWith multiple hidden layers, deep neural networks can learn the features\
    \ of data and solve\nmore complex problems [6,7]. Since the models of DL are faster\
    \ and more efﬁcient compared\nto the shallow algorithms in ML, and unlike them,\
    \ they can automatically extract features\nfrom the input data, they have been\
    \ the most widely used models in recent years [6,7].\nIn 2012, AlexNet [9] won\
    \ the LSVRC competition for classiﬁcation. Sermanet et al. [10]\nshowed that DL\
    \ models could be used for classiﬁcation, recognition, and localization and\n\
    achieved excellent results. These achievements encourage researchers to apply\
    \ DL models\nto other areas of human life, including agriculture.\nLiu et al.\
    \ [11] reviewed advances in combining edge intelligence and remote sensing\nwith\
    \ Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAV) in precision agriculture. This paper presented\
    \ a list\nof recent works using UAVs in combination with DL models. Since the\
    \ focus of the paper\nwas on UAV devices, this work was listed based only on the\
    \ application and model used in\nthe paper and did not include reviews and analysis\
    \ of the work.\nRegarding the diversity of environments in agriculture, the result\
    \ of a trained model\non one environment may not be transferable to others [12].\
    \ This makes the application of\ndeep learning models in agriculture more challenging\
    \ and requires more attention. This\npaper aims to review newly published works\
    \ to ﬁnd new techniques, challenges, and\npossible solutions for using deep learning\
    \ in agriculture since 2018. The following are the\nmain objectives of this paper:\n\
    •\nTo provide an overview of recent work and identify challenges related to data\
    \ acquisi-\ntion and preparation for deep learning models;\n•\nTo review of the\
    \ new DL model algorithms used in agriculture;\n•\nHighlight the challenges in\
    \ training the model;\n•\nExamine the challenges associated with applying the\
    \ trained model in the real world;\n•\nReview the new edge devices used to implement\
    \ the trained models.\nRemote Sens. 2022, 14, 638\n3 of 43\n2. Materials and Methods\n\
    The two most reputable databases for scientiﬁc papers, the Web of Science and\
    \ Sci-\nenceDirect, were searched for relevant journal articles and conference\
    \ proceedings. The\nterm “deep learning” was used in the keywords of the screening\
    \ titles with one of the\nfollowing keywords: “agriculture”, “plant diseases”,\
    \ “weed detection”, “yield estima-\ntion”, “fruit detection”, “species identiﬁcation”,\
    \ “crop classiﬁcation”, “soil management”,\n“automation and robotics” and “irrigation”.\n\
    The articles that did not deal with Deep Learning in agriculture were excluded.\
    \ In\nthe end, forty-six articles remained. Of these, ten articles were related\
    \ to plant diseases,\neleven articles were related to fruit detection, ﬁve articles\
    \ were related to weed detection,\nsix articles were related to species detection,\
    \ three articles were related to soil management,\nﬁve articles were related to\
    \ water management, and six articles were related to automation\nin agriculture.\n\
    The following criteria were considered in the analysis of the articles:\n•\nThe\
    \ way the dataset was collected for training the model and the challenges regarding\n\
    the dataset.\n•\nThe DL models/architectures used in the article and the performance\
    \ of the models.\n•\nThe metrics that were used to evaluate the model.\n•\nThe\
    \ inference time of the model (if speciﬁed), as it is a very important critical\
    \ for the\nuse of the model in the real-time application.\n•\nThe analysis of\
    \ the failure predicted by the model.\n•\nWhether the authors used a low-cost\
    \ device to deploy the trained model.\nThese articles base on the above criteria\
    \ are discussed in Section 3.8 and listed in the\nTables 1–9.\n3. An Overview\
    \ of Deep Learning\nDL models were inspired by human neural networks in the brain.\
    \ The word “deep”\nrefers to the number of hidden layers through which the data\
    \ is transformed. Through\ntraining, they send the input through a deep network\
    \ with different layers, where each layer\nhierarchically extracts speciﬁc features\
    \ at different scales or resolutions from the data and\ncombines them into a higher-level\
    \ feature, and uses these features to make predictions [6].\nDL models are divided\
    \ into supervised learning, unsupervised learning, and rein-\nforcement learning\
    \ [6]. Supervised learning is the task of learning a function from labeled\ntraining\
    \ data. In supervised learning, all data in the dataset is a pair consisting of\
    \ an input\nobject and the desired output value. A supervised learning model analyzes\
    \ the training\ndata and produces a function that can be used for prediction [6].\
    \ The most commonly\nused DL models included in this review are Convolutional\
    \ Neural Networks (CNN) and\nRecurrent Neural Networks (RNN). Unsupervised learning\
    \ was used in three papers.\n3.1. Convolutional Neural Network\nThe CNN model\
    \ is a supervised learning model speciﬁcally designed for classiﬁcation,\nrecognition,\
    \ and segmentation. A CNN model consists of a stack of convolutional layers,\n\
    nonlinear functions, pooling layers, and fully connected layers. A convolutional\
    \ layer\ncontains a set of kernels whose parameters must be learned and is used\
    \ to extract features\nfrom the data. Each kernel slides over the height and width\
    \ of the input, and the dot\nproduct between the kernel entries and each position\
    \ of the input is computed (Figure 1).\nThe output of a convolutional layer can\
    \ be calculated by Equation (1):\nyi = X ∗ Wi + bi,\ni = 1, · · · , m\n(1)\nwhere\
    \ X is the input of the layer, yi is the output corresponding to the i-th convolutional\n\
    kernel, Wi is a matrix of the trainable weights of the i-th kernel, bi is the\
    \ i-th bias, and m is\nthe number of kernels.\nRemote Sens. 2022, 14, 638\n4 of\
    \ 43\nAfter each convolutional layer, a nonlinear activation function is used\
    \ to introduce\nnonlinear features into the model. Rectiﬁed Linear Units (ReLU)\
    \ have become state-of-the-\nart and are the most commonly used activation function\
    \ in Deep Learning models [6]. A\npooling layer is usually located between two\
    \ convolutional layers and is used to reduce the\nnumber of parameters to minimize\
    \ overﬁtting [6,7].\nFigure 1. The left side image is the example of the convolutional\
    \ operation, and the right side is the\nexample of a max-pooling operation with\
    \ pooling size (2,2).\nThe ﬁnal layers consist of fully connected layers that\
    \ take the features extracted by the\nprevious layer and generate class probabilities\
    \ or scores. These layers are fully connected to\nall neurons in the previous\
    \ layer. Figure 2 shows the architecture of the well-known CNN\nmodel called VGG19\
    \ and the visualization of the last layer of the VGG19 model in plant\ndisease\
    \ classiﬁcation, respectively.\nconv1\nconv2\nconv3\nconv4\nconv5\nfc6\nfc7\n\

    \ CNN model VGG19. The VGG19 network contains\nconvolutional layers, max-pool\
    \ layers, fully connected layers, and a soft-max classiﬁcation layer.\n3.1.1.\
    \ Classiﬁcation/Regression by CNN\nThe CNN model can be used for classiﬁcation\
    \ or regression problems.\nFor the\nclassiﬁcation task, the last layer of the\
    \ model is chosen as a fully connected layer with\nsoftmax activation function\
    \ and for the regression task as a fully connected layer, usu-\nally with linear\
    \ function. The most popular CNN architectures for classiﬁcation include\nAlexNet\
    \ [9], GoogleNet [13], VGG [14], and ResNet [15], as well as the new lightweight\n\
    models such as MobileNet [16], and EfﬁcientNet [17]. The lightweight models enable\n\
    to use mobile and low cost edge devices such as Jetson nano (https://developer.nvidia.\n\
    com/embedded/jetson-nano-developer-kit, accessed on 8 November 2021), Raspberrypi\n\
    (https://www.raspberrypi.com/, accessed on 15 November 2021) and Google TPU Coral\n\
    (https://coral.ai/, accessed on 8 November 2021) to deploy the trained model in\
    \ robots\nand use them in the ﬁeld [11,18] (Figure 3).\nRemote Sens. 2022, 14,\
    \ 638\n5 of 43\nFigure 3. From left to right: Jetson nano, Raspberrypi, and Google\
    \ TPU Coral.\n3.1.2. Detection by CNN\nThe CNN model can also be used for object\
    \ detection. There are two types of modern\nobject detection algorithms, the two-stage\
    \ detectors such as R-CNN [19], Fast R-CNN [20],\nand Faster R-CNN [21] as well\
    \ as single-stage detectors such as You Look Once (YOLO) [22],\nSingle Shot multi-box\
    \ Detector (SSD) [23], and LedNet [24]. In the two-stage detector,\nregions of\
    \ interest are generated in one stage using a Region Proposal Network (RPN). In\n\
    the other stage, the proposed regions are evaluated for object classiﬁcation and\
    \ bounding\nbox regression using convolutional layers. Such models achieve high\
    \ accuracy rates but\nare very slow [23]. Single-stage detectors, on the other\
    \ hand, contain a single feed-forward\nconvolutional network that directly provides\
    \ the bounding boxes and objects classiﬁcation.\nThe single-stage detectors are\
    \ faster in detection but less accurate than two-stage detectors,\nand it depends\
    \ on the application which model should be chosen. Figure 4 shows the\narchitecture\
    \ of Faster R-CNN and SDD, and Figure 5 shows the result of peach detection\n\
    using the Faster R-CNN model [25].\nVGG Conv\nlayers\nRPN\nclassifier\nA. Faster\

    \ score for each detected object [25].\n3.1.3. Segmentation by CNN\nThe segmentation\
    \ task can also be performed with CNN models. In segmentation, an\nimage is divided\
    \ into groups of pixels, and each group is assigned a class. Figure 6 shows\n\
    the segmentation of the grape in the image.\nFigure 6. The left side shows the\
    \ original image and the right side shows the task of segmentation for\nand the\
    \ right side shows the task of segmentation for grapes [26]. Reprinted with permission\
    \ from\nref. [26]. Copyright 2020 Elsevier.\nThe fully Convolutional Networks\
    \ (FCN) [27], Mask R-CNN [28], and Deeplab [29] are\nDL models for segmentation.\
    \ Lottes et al. [30] used an encoder-decoder Fully Convolutional\nNetwork (FCN)\
    \ model to identify crops and weeds during ﬁeld operations. Ghiani et al. [31]\n\
    used Mask R-CNN with ResNet101 which was trained with the dataset COCO, as a back-\n\
    bone for detecting grape branches in the tree.\n3.2. Recurrent Neural Network\n\
    RNN is specially designed for handling sequential data. In RNN, the output from\
    \ the\nprevious step is fed into the current step as input. The output of an RNN\
    \ unit is determined\nusing a tanh function by Equation (2):\nht = tanh(Wxxt +\
    \ Whht−1 + bt)\n(2)\nThe main problem with RNN is the vanishing gradient, i.e.,\
    \ the gradient of the loss\nfunction approaches zero [32]. Long Short-Term Memory\
    \ networks (LSTM) [33] is a special\ntype of RNN created to solve the vanishing\
    \ problem in RNN. A standard LSTM unit\nRemote Sens. 2022, 14, 638\n7 of 43\n\
    consists of an input gate (3), forget gate (4), an output gate (7), and a memory\
    \ cell (6).\nFigure 7 shows an LSTM unit and an RNN unit.\nit = σ(Wixxt + Wihht−1\
    \ + bi),\n(3)\nft = σ(Wf xxt + Wf hht−1 + bf ),\n(4)\nzt = tanh(Wzxxt + Wzhht−1\
    \ + bz),\n(5)\nct = ft ∗ ct−1 + it ∗ zt.\n(6)\not = σ(Woxxt + Wohht−1 + bo)\n\
    (7)\nThe weights (W) and biases (b) are trainable parameters that are adjusted\
    \ and opti-\nmized during the training of the model.\nFigure 7. (A) LSTM unit\
    \ diagram, (B) regular RNN unit. In an RNN unit, all input data is used for\n\
    output. However, in an LSTM unit, a set of gates is used to control the information\
    \ in memory and\ndecide how long and how much information may be stored.\n3.3.\
    \ Unsupervised Learning\nUnsupervised learning is a type of learning in which\
    \ hidden structures are found in\nunlabeled data with minimal human supervision\
    \ [6]. The primary method of unsupervised\nlearning is cluster analysis, such\
    \ as K-Means clustering. Cluster analysis groups or segments\ndatasets with common\
    \ attributes. In supervised learning, labeling a large amount of\nagricultural\
    \ data to train the model is expensive and time-consuming. Deep clustering\nmodels\
    \ can be used to avoid labeling and make the model more robust. Kang and Chen\
    \ [34]\nused automatic label generation by a clustering RCNN (C-RCNN) model to\
    \ identify the\napple on the trees. Tang et al. [35] used K-means clustering to\
    \ label the dataset and\nidentify weeds in the ﬁeld. Ferreira et al. [36] used\
    \ DeepCluster and Joint Unsupervised\nLearning from Deep Representations and Image\
    \ Clusters (JULE) to identify weeds in the\nﬁeld. However, many other new deep\
    \ clustering algorithms can be explored to avoid\nlabeling in agriculture [37].\n\
    3.4. Reinforcement Learning\nReinforcement Learning (RL) is concerned with how\
    \ an agent performs appropriate\nactions in an environment to maximize the rewards\
    \ in a given situation. RL agents must\ndetermine the best strategy to maximize\
    \ their expected cumulative rewards. An interactive\nenvironment receives the\
    \ current state and the action chosen by the agent and indicates\nthe next state\
    \ and reward (see Figure 8). This interaction between the DRL agent and the\n\
    training environment is repeated until the DRL agent converges to an optimal strategy\
    \ for\nchoosing an action.\nRemote Sens. 2022, 14, 638\n8 of 43\nFigure 8. Interaction\
    \ of the agent with the environment [38]. The agent chooses an action at in\n\
    the current state st based on a policy. The environment receives the action and\
    \ the current state\nand outputs the next state and the reward. Reprinted with\
    \ permission from ref. [38]. Copyright\n2022 Elsevier.\nDeep reinforcement learning\
    \ (DRL) combines deep learning and reinforcement learn-\ning [39]. As Bu and Wang\
    \ [39] mentioned, DRL is a promising model for building smart\nfarms. Chen et\
    \ al. [40] used Deep Q-Network to build a decision-making system for rice\nirrigation\
    \ based on weather forecasts.\n3.5. Data Acquired and Data Preparation\nAI models\
    \ convert raw data into usable models, so a training dataset is required to\n\
    train a model. The more data available, the better results are obtained. A dataset\
    \ can be\ncollected using advanced technologies such as sensors mounted on ground-based\
    \ platforms,\nsatellites, and unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) [41–46].\nA sensor\
    \ node is a specialized device capable of sensing physical parameters and\nprocessing\
    \ the sensed parameters using a microcontroller. In addition to processing, it\
    \ can\nalso transmit the processed data wirelessly to neighboring nodes or router\
    \ nodes using\ntransceiver [47]. Sensors mounted on ground-based platforms are\
    \ divided into hand-held,\nfree-standing in the ﬁeld (Figure 9), and agricultural\
    \ machinery-mounted sensors that can\nmeasure soil, plant, and weather characteristics\
    \ [41,42,48]. The advantages of ground-based\nsensors are that they are less expensive\
    \ than other sensors, they are not sensitive to humid\nconditions, and they are\
    \ more suitable for small farms. The disadvantage of these types of\nsensors is\
    \ that they are very time-consuming and, even when attached to farm machinery,\n\
    the information is very inefﬁcient for larger ﬁelds. Furthermore, some of these\
    \ sensors are\ninﬂexible in terms of the type of spectral data that can be collected\
    \ [49].\nFigure 9. From left to right: sensors mounted on ground-based platforms\

    \ on 3 November 2021), and unmanned aerial\nvehicles (UAVs: https://precisionagricultu.re/12-potential-uses-for-uas-in-agriculture/,\
    \ accessed\non 9 December 2021).\nSatellite remote sensing provides synoptic,\
    \ objective, and homogeneous data that\ncan be captured geographically and temporally,\
    \ and therefore could be an efﬁcient tool to\nprovide high-quality information\
    \ about agriculture over large areas, even across national\nRemote Sens. 2022,\
    \ 14, 638\n9 of 43\nborders [50]. Depending on the spatial and spectral resolution,\
    \ repetition frequency, and\ncost, the multitude of satellites and sensors orbiting\
    \ the Earth can be used to provide data\nfor many types of applications [48].\
    \ The main disadvantage of satellite imagery is that it is\nexpensive at high\
    \ spatial resolution. Another disadvantage is their ﬁxed schedule, thus the\n\
    data cannot be acquired in a speciﬁc time step. For example, the time step for\
    \ Sentinel2 is\nﬁve days. Another disadvantage of satellite images is that they\
    \ highly depend on climate\nand cannot be post-processed on cloudy days [48].\
    \ For a list of satellites launched since\n1970, we refer to [48,51].\nAn aircraft\
    \ system with no pilot on board that, once programmed, allows no outside\nintervention\
    \ during ﬂight. Originally intended for military use, they are now used in\nagriculture\
    \ to monitor crops and collect images and data from anywhere in the ﬁeld [11,49].\n\
    Unlike satellites, unmanned aerial systems can collect data at a speciﬁc time\
    \ step, and the\nresults of the collected data have a higher resolution than that\
    \ of satellites. Most unmanned\naerial systems can ﬂy in precipitation, but cloud\
    \ cover can affect the data unless a second\nsensor is used to measure the amount\
    \ of sunlight reaching the aircraft. The unmanned\naerial systems can also be\
    \ expensive, but there are models that are inexpensive. The\ndisadvantages of\
    \ unmanned aerial systems are the requirement of a human operator [49],\nlimited\
    \ ﬂight duration, the limited weight of cargo carried, energy consumption [41],\
    \ and\ndependence on weather conditions [41,52]. In addition, the processing of\
    \ data collected by\nUAS is higher than that of satellite imagery [49].\nIn addition\
    \ to using sensors, the dataset can also be collected from free online datasets\n\
    such as ImageNet, Microsoft COCO, and PlantVillage [46] or images can be generated\n\
    synthetically as described in [53] or by using simulation software in agriculture\
    \ such as\nAguaCrop and DSSAT [54]. For DL models, a large dataset is required\
    \ for training to\nextract appropriate features [55]. Collating and labeling a\
    \ large amount of data is time-\nconsuming. One strategy to overcome these challenges\
    \ is to increase the size of the dataset\nusing augmentation techniques [55].\
    \ Augmentation techniques artiﬁcially create different\nversions of a real dataset\
    \ to increase its size. These include rotation, blurring, scaling, and\nﬂipping\
    \ of images in the dataset [55,56].\nAnother strategy is transfer learning and\
    \ ﬁne-tuning the model [57]. In transfer\nlearning, the model is trained with\
    \ a large dataset such as ImageNet or COCO and then\nthe same model is reused\
    \ and re-trained for a similar task. If the dataset does not contain\nenough data\
    \ to train a model from scratch, this strategy can be used. Ghazi et al. [58]\n\
    investigated how ﬁne-tuning pre-trained models affects plant classiﬁcation results.\
    \ For\nthis purpose, the AlexNet, GoogLeNet, and VGGNet models were trained, once\
    \ from\nscratch, and another time using ﬁne-tuning from Caffe Models. The results\
    \ showed that\nﬁne-tuning the models improved their performance. Barbedo [55],\
    \ however, investigated\nhow the size and diversity of the dataset affect the\
    \ performance of DL techniques applied\nto plant diseases. The results showed\
    \ that even with transfer learning and augmentation\ntechniques, CNN might require\
    \ a large number of images to extract useful features from\nthe data. Figure 10\
    \ shows the transfer learning task.\nThe next challenge is how well the trained\
    \ datasets represent the real world. Ramcha-\nran et al. [12] trained the SSD\
    \ object detection model to identify three diseases in cassava.\nAlthough the\
    \ model was trained on the dataset collected in the ﬁeld with a camera, the\n\
    F1-score decreased by 32% on the images from other sources. Therefore, the main\
    \ focus\nwhen collecting datasets should be how well the dataset represents the\
    \ ﬁeld study.\nRemote Sens. 2022, 14, 638\n10 of 43\nA common Large\nDataset\n\

    \ then the model is\ntrained with a custom dataset.\n3.6. Training and Learning\n\
    In the training step of a DL model, the dataset is divided into the training set,\
    \ the\nvalidation set, and the test set. The training set is used to train the\
    \ model. The validation\ndataset is a sample of data retained by the training\
    \ model and used for model selection. The\nmodel structure is determined using\
    \ hyperparameters. Hyperparameters are parameters\nwhose values are set before\
    \ the learning process begins, such as the number of hidden\nlayers in the model,\
    \ the number of kernels in the CNN model, and the number of nodes in\neach LSTM\
    \ layer [32]. A test set is used to test a machine learning model after it has\
    \ been\ntrained on an initial training dataset. When the test set is used during\
    \ the training of the\nmodel, it does not provide information about how the network\
    \ will perform on unseen\ndata, and the evaluation of the result has no statistical\
    \ signiﬁcance [32]. Figure 11 shows\nthe general steps from preprocessing the\
    \ data to ﬁnalizing the model for prediction.\nThe error of a model is deﬁned\
    \ as the difference between the actual value the predicted\noutput, and it must\
    \ be minimized in the training step. The function that is used to compute\nthis\
    \ error is known as the loss function. It can be categorized into two types: Classiﬁcation\n\
    and Regression Loss. The loss function used for the classiﬁcation contains Hinge\
    \ loss,\nExpositional loss, cross-entropy, Log loss, and many more. For the regression\
    \ problems,\nthe loss function such as Mean Square Error (MSE), Mean Absolute\
    \ Error (MAE), Huber\nloss, and log cosh loss can be used. Each of these gives\
    \ a different error for the same\nprediction. The choice of a loss function depends\
    \ on the algorithm. Training DL models\nare based on backpropagation [59]. Backpropagation\
    \ uses the chain rule and computes the\nloss function’s gradient concerning the\
    \ network’s weights and biases for a single input–\noutput example, adjusted network\
    \ weights, and biases. The optimization algorithm must\nbe selected to minimize\
    \ the loss function. The choice of optimization algorithm and loss\nfunctions\
    \ are critical. The same as loss function, there are several ways to optimize\
    \ the error,\nsuch as Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD), SGD with momentum, Root\
    \ Means Square\npropagation (RMSprop), and Adam [6]. Zhang et al. [60] built up\
    \ an experience to compare\nthe performance between SGD and Adam in identifying\
    \ tomato leaf disease. The ResNet\nwith the SGD optimization method obtained the\
    \ highest test accuracy of 96.51%. Figure 12\nshows the learning steps of a DL\
    \ model.\nRemote Sens. 2022, 14, 638\n11 of 43\nCollect, clean, and label data\n\

    Once the model is trained, the most crucial question is how good the model is.\
    \ There\nare several metrics for evaluating DL models. The most commonly used\
    \ metrics in this\nreview for the regression problems are:\n•\nMSE: is the average\
    \ of the squared differences between prediction and actual observation.\n•\nRoot\
    \ Mean Square Error (RMSE): is the square root of MSE.\n•\nMAE: is the average\
    \ of the absolute differences between prediction and actual obser-\nvation.\n\
    •\nR2: is a statistical measure calculated from the variance explained by the\
    \ model versus\nthe total variance. The higher R2 indicates, the smaller the differences\
    \ between the\nobserved data and the ﬁtted values.\nThe metrics that can be used\
    \ in evaluating a classiﬁcation or segmentation problem\nare as follows:\n•\n\
    Accuracy (AC) is the ratio of correctly predicted observation of the total observations.\n\
    •\nRecall (R): also known as sensitivity, measures how many actual positives capture\
    \ by\nthe model correctly.\n•\nPrecision (P): also known as a positive predictive\
    \ value, measures how accurate the\nprediction is in classiﬁcation, i.e., the\
    \ correct prediction.\n•\nThe Average Precision (AP) is given by the area under\
    \ the precision–recall curve\nabove. Since Precision and Recall always lie between\
    \ 0 and 1, AP also lies between 0\nand 1. The Mean Average Precision (mAP) is\
    \ calculated by taking the mean AP over\nall classes.\n•\nF1-score: is the weighted\
    \ average of Precision and Recall.\n•\nIntersection Over Union (IOU): is an evaluation\
    \ metric used to measure an object\ndetector’s accuracy on a particular dataset.\n\
    •\nArea Under the ROC Curve (AUC): measures the area underneath the entire ROC\
    \ curve.\n3.8. Brief Review of Papers\n3.8.1. Disease Detection\nPlant diseases\
    \ cause losses in agricultural production and endanger food security. The\nmost\
    \ common practice in pest and disease control is to spray the crop area evenly\
    \ with\npesticides [8]. This method requires signiﬁcant amounts of pesticides,\
    \ which results in\nhigh ﬁnancial and human resources and signiﬁcantly changes\
    \ the environment. The use\nof a deep learning algorithm that detects the exact\
    \ time, location, and affected crops and\nsprays the pesticides only on the affected\
    \ plants can reduce resource consumption and\nenvironmental changes.\nKerkech\
    \ et al. [61] used the SegNet model to segment and detect grapevine diseases\n\
    using images with RGB and infrared ranges. The dataset was acquired using a UAV\n\
    device with two MAPIR Survey2 camera sensors, including a visible light (RGB)\
    \ sensor\nset for automatic illumination and an infrared sensor. The dataset was\
    \ labeled using a\nsemi-automatic method, i.e., a sliding window to identify potentially\
    \ diseased areas. Then,\neach block was classiﬁed by a LeNet5 network for pre-labeling.\
    \ In the end, the labeled\nimages were manually corrected. The SegNet recognizes\
    \ four classes including the shaded\nareas, soil, healthy and symptomatic vines.\
    \ Two models were trained, one for the RGB\nimages and the other for the infrared\
    \ images. The segmentation results of the two models\nwere also fused in two ways.\
    \ The ﬁrst case was called “Fusion AND”, which means that\nthe symptom is considered\
    \ detected if it is present in both the RGB and infrared images.\nThe second case\
    \ is called “fusion by the union” and has the symbol ”fusion OR”, which\nmeans\
    \ that the symptom is considered detected if it is present in either the RGB or\
    \ the\ninfrared image. The model trained with RGB images (AC = 85.13) outperformed\
    \ the model\ntrained with infrared images (78.72). The fusion AND had the best\
    \ performance, and the\nfusion OR had the worst accuracy. The runtime of SegNet\
    \ on a UAV image was reported to\nRemote Sens. 2022, 14, 638\n13 of 43\nbe 140\
    \ s for visible and infrared images. The fusion between the two segmented images\n\
    takes less than 2 s.\nKerkech et al. [62] used a CNN model to detect Esca disease\
    \ in grapevine using UAV\nRGB images. A CNN model was trained with different combinations\
    \ of patch sizes 16 × 16,\n32 × 32 and 64 × 64 with different color spaces including\
    \ RGB, HSV, LAB, and YUV, and\nvegetation indices such as ExG, ExR, ExGR, GRVI,\
    \ NDI, and RGI. All the different color\nspaces and vegetation indices used in\
    \ this study can be calculated from the RGB images.\nThe results show that the\
    \ CNN model trained with the RGB and YUV color spaces has a\nbetter performance\
    \ compared to the models trained with HSV and LAB. It was pointed\nout that the\
    \ lower accuracy of the models trained with HSV could be due to the Hue (H)\n\
    channel in HSV, which combines all color information into a single channel and\
    \ is less\nrelevant for the network to learn the best color features. The LAB\
    \ color space has one\nluminance channel (L) and two chrominance channels, which\
    \ do not reproduce the colors\nof the diseased vineyard well.\nIn the next experiment,\
    \ vegetation indices were added to the RGB and YUV data.\nCombining vegetation\
    \ indices with RGB and YUV improved classiﬁcation results in most\ncases. The\
    \ ﬁnal investigation concerned the models trained by combining the vegetation\n\
    indices alone. The combination of ExR, ExG, and ExGR vegetation indices with a\
    \ size of\n16 × 16 gave the best performance among the other inputs (including\
    \ color space) and sizes\nwith an accuracy of 95.80%. Furthermore, the combination\
    \ of YUV and ExGR vegetation\nindices with sizes of 32 × 32 and 64 × 64 achieved\
    \ similar performance but the run-time\nwas longer.\nFrom the results, the color\
    \ of the images and leaves is very important in the detection\nof grapevine diseases.\
    \ Furthermore, the number of channels in the input does not affect the\nrun-time\
    \ of the model, but the size of the input and the model structure do.\nBarbedo\
    \ [55] investigated how dataset size and diversity affect the performance of\n\
    DL techniques applied to plant diseases. An image dataset of leaves with a small\
    \ number\nof samples for the CNN model was used to investigate the behavior of\
    \ GoogLeNet under\ndifferent conditions. Data augmentation and transfer learning\
    \ methods were used to\ntrain the CNN. The results showed that even with transfer\
    \ learning and augmentation\ntechniques, CNN requires a large number of images\
    \ to extract useful features from the data.\nEven though a large number of images\
    \ can be easily acquired with the new technology,\nlabeling the dataset is time-consuming.\
    \ One option proposed in this paper was to share\nthe dataset, but as mentioned\
    \ earlier, the two environments are not the same in agriculture.\nThe effect of\
    \ removing the background of the images on the accuracy of the model was\nalso\
    \ investigated. The model has trained again with the images without background.\
    \ The\nmodel has trained again with the images without background. The results\
    \ show different\nbehaviors with respect to the accuracy of the model, including\
    \ no signiﬁcant effect, a\nsigniﬁcant improvement in accuracy in some cases, a\
    \ signiﬁcant decrease in accuracy, and\nmixed results (improved accuracy in some\
    \ diseases while the error rate increased in others).\nFrom the signiﬁcant decrease\
    \ in accuracy for some plants, it was inferred that the CNN\nmodel sometimes uses\
    \ the background of the model to classify the images. An attempt that\ncan be\
    \ made here is to train the model with both datasets (with and without background)\n\
    and investigate the accuracy of the model in this case.\nFerentinos (2018) [63]\
    \ used AlexNet, AlexNetOWTBn [64], GoogLeNet, Overfeat [10],\nand VGG models to\
    \ identify 25 plant disease in 58 different classes of (plant, disease) com-\n\
    binations, including some healthy plants. The dataset used was images of healthy\
    \ and in-\nfected leaves of the plants from the Plantvillag database (https://github.com/spMohanty/\n\
    PlantVillage-Dataset, accessed on 17 November 2021). More than 37.3% of the images\
    \ in\nthe dataset were taken under real cultivation conditions in the ﬁeld, and\
    \ the other images\nwere taken under laboratory conditions. In the ﬁrst experiment,\
    \ the number of images\nacquired under laboratory conditions and real conditions\
    \ was kept similar in the training\nand test set, and the models were trained\
    \ using this dataset. The VGG model performed\nbest on the test set with an accuracy\
    \ of 99.53%.\nRemote Sens. 2022, 14, 638\n14 of 43\nThey also investigated the\
    \ signiﬁcance of the presence of ﬁeld-captured images in\nthe training set. From\
    \ the 58 available classes of the form (plant, disease), the 12 that\ncontained\
    \ images of both types were selected. Two experiments were conducted with\nthese\
    \ 12 classes, and two CNN models were developed: one was trained with images\n\
    under laboratory conditions and tested with images under ﬁeld conditions, and\
    \ another\nwas trained with images under ﬁeld conditions and tested with images\
    \ under laboratory\nconditions. Although the number of images acquired under ﬁeld\
    \ conditions was less than\nthe number of images acquired under laboratory conditions,\
    \ the CNN model trained only\nwith images under ﬁeld conditions performed better\
    \ with an accuracy of 68% than the\nCNN model trained only with images under laboratory\
    \ conditions with an accuracy of\n33%. This result shows the importance of the\
    \ presence of the images acquired under ﬁeld\nconditions. From the misclassiﬁcation\
    \ image, they point out some problematic situations,\nincluding images with extensive\
    \ partial shading on the leaves, images with multiple objects\nin addition to\
    \ the image, images where the leaf occupies a very small and non-centric part\n\
    of the frame, and images without leaves.\nJiang et al. [65] implemented the CNN\
    \ models to detect ﬁve common apple leaf\ndiseases using images from the ﬁeld.\
    \ By applying data augmentation, such as rotational\ntransformations, horizontal\
    \ and vertical ﬂips, intensity disturbances, and Gaussian noise,\n26,377 disease\
    \ images were generated. The problem with SDD is that it cannot detect\na small\
    \ object, and also, an object can be detected multiple times. To overcome these\n\
    drawbacks, they developed an SSD model with a VGG-INCEP as the backbone, where\n\
    two GoogLeNet inception layers replace two convolutional layers of the VGG model.\n\
    Moreover, the structure of feature extraction and fusion is designed by applying\
    \ the\nRainbow concatenation method instead of the pyramid (which is used in the\
    \ SSD model) to\nimprove the performance of feature fusion. The results showed\
    \ that the data augmentation\nimproved the accuracy of the model by 6.91% compared\
    \ to the original dataset. Moreover,\nthe proposed model achieved the best performance\
    \ compared to faster R -CNN and SSD\nwith VGG and Rainbow SSD (RSSD) model.\n\
    To investigate the effect of using a deep model as a backbone, ResNet-101 was\
    \ used\nas a feature extractor for SSD. The results show that ResNet-101 does\
    \ not lead to any\nimprovement. In terms of speed, Faster RNN was the slower model\
    \ with more accuracy.\nThe proposed model with 78.80% mAP and 23.13 Frames Per\
    \ Second (FPS) was more\naccurate than SDD and RSSD, but SSD outperformed the\
    \ other models in terms of time\ninference. By examining the misclassiﬁed images,\
    \ it was indicated that similarity between\ndiseases, misclassiﬁed background,\
    \ and light condition were the challenges in classiﬁcation.\nKarthik et al. [66]\
    \ proposed a Residual Attention Network for disease detection in\ntomato leaves.\
    \ The main idea of attention is to focus on the relevant parts of the input to\n\
    produce outputs. The dataset was collected from the open-source website Plantvillage\
    \ and\ncontained one healthy class and three diseases. They implemented three\
    \ models. One was\na traditional CNN model, the second used the three residual\
    \ layers introduced into the\nCNN model as part of the ResNet architecture, and\
    \ the last used an attention mechanism\non top of the residual CNN for effective\
    \ feature learning. The traditional CNN-based\nmethods focus on ordered feature\
    \ learning, starting from basic image-level features such\nas edges, color, etc.,\
    \ to complex texture-based differences [66]. In the deeper layer, some\nimportant\
    \ features extracted in the ﬁrst layer may be lost. The residual layers are designed\n\
    to avoid this problem [66]. They concatenate the extracted features from the earlier\
    \ layers\nwith the deeper layers. In addition, the attention mechanism is used\
    \ to extract the relevant\nparts of the feature maps. The Residual Attention Network\
    \ CNN performed better with an\noverall accuracy of 98% than the Vanilla Residual\
    \ Network with an accuracy of 95% and\nthe traditional CNN model with an accuracy\
    \ of 84%.\nRemote Sens. 2022, 14, 638\n15 of 43\nLiu et al. [67] implemented the\
    \ model Cascade Inception to detect four common apple\nleaf diseases in images\
    \ captured in the ﬁeld. The Cascade Inception was a modiﬁed AlexNet\nmodel with\
    \ inception layers from GoogleNet. Various data enhancement methods such as\n\
    image rotation, mirror symmetry, brightness adjustment, and PCA jittering were\
    \ applied to\nthe training images. Moreover, the fully connected layers were replaced\
    \ by convolutional\nlayers, which results in fewer parameters and avoids overﬁtting.\
    \ The proposed model was\ntrained using the optimization method Nesterov Accelerated\
    \ Gradient (NAG) and achieved\nan accuracy of 97.62%. The performance of the proposed\
    \ model was compared with\nSVM and BP neural networks, standard AlexNet, GoogLeNet,\
    \ ResNet-20, and VGGNet-\n16. Transfer learning method was used to train VGGNet-16\
    \ and achieved 96% accuracy.\nStandard AlexNet, GoogLeNet, and ResNet-20 were\
    \ trained from scratch using SGD-\noptimization and achieved a maximum accuracy\
    \ of 95.69%. The SVM and BP, which\nachieved an accuracy of less than 60%, show\
    \ that the traditional approaches rely heavily\non the expert developed classiﬁcation\
    \ features to improve the recognition accuracy. They\nalso investigated the effect\
    \ of data augmentation methods and optimization algorithms\non accuracy. The model\
    \ with the SGD optimizer achieved 93.32% accuracy, while the\nmodel with NAG achieved\
    \ 97.62% accuracy. The data augmentation methods improved the\nperformance of\
    \ the model by 10.83%. The advantage of the model is that it outperformed\nother\
    \ CNN models in terms of training time and memory required. Furthermore, the\n\
    number of parameters of the model was less than AlexNet and GoogleNet. One point\n\
    that emerges from the paper is that GoogleNet and AlexNet were trained using the\
    \ SGD\noptimizer, and the proposed model was trained using the NAG method, but\
    \ as mentioned\nin the paper, SGD has the “local optimum” problem. In addition,\
    \ the models were not\ncompared based on the inference time.\nRamcharan et al.\

    \ to detect seventeen diseases of ﬁve crops (wheat,\nbarley, corn, rice, and rapeseed)\
    \ in images captured in the ﬁeld. The dataset contained\nseveral challenges, such\
    \ as multiple diseases on the same plant, similar visual symptoms\namong diseases,\
    \ images of early and early-stage diseases, and diseases of leaves, and stems.\n\
    To improve the accuracy of the model, the crop ID was used in the network. The\
    \ crop ID\nwas deﬁned as a categorical vector with K components, where K is the\
    \ number of crops in\nthe model. Several models were trained. The ﬁrst approach\
    \ was to train an independent\nmodel for each crop and the second approach was\
    \ to train a single model for the entire\ndataset. The results show that the multi-crop\
    \ model had a similar performance to splitting\nthe training dataset into the\
    \ different crops (1% increased accuracy). However, the class of\ndiseases with\
    \ fewer images in the training set may beneﬁt from the multi-crop model. The\n\
    second approach was to add the crop ID to the multi-crop model. The results show\
    \ that by\nadding crop id, the model can still beneﬁt from more images for training,\
    \ while crop ID\ninformation helps the network to discriminate between similar\
    \ diseases.\nChen et al. [69] used pre-trained MobileNet V2 networks to identify\
    \ twelve rice\nplant diseases. The dataset was collected from online sources and\
    \ real agricultural ﬁelds.\nAn attention mechanism was added to the model, and\

    \ the images of plant diseases.\nSimilarly, in MobileAtten-alpha, the attention\
    \ method was used instead of transfer\nlearning twice. The proposed model (using\

    \ 2022, 14, 638\n19 of 43\nSilver and Monga [71] trained ﬁve CNN models to estimate\
    \ grape yield from RGB\nimages taken in a vineyard on harvest day using the camera\
    \ of a Samsung Galaxy S3. The\nimages of 40 grapevines were split into two parts,\
    \ one for the left cordon and one for the\nright cordon, resulting in a total\
    \ of 80 cordons. A simple CNN was trained by inputting\nthe RGB images of the\
    \ left and right cordons and estimating the grape yield. The second\nmodel was\
    \ the same as the ﬁrst model, but the input to the model was the right cordon\n\
    images and the inversion of the left cordon images to look similar to right cordon\
    \ images.\nThe third model, an autoencoder network, is trained to a high level\
    \ of accuracy and the\nCNN encoder weights are transferred as starting weights\
    \ into the CNN model for the yield\nestimation model. In the fourth model, an\
    \ autoencoder model was trained to output the\ndensity map of the grapes in the\
    \ image. Then, the weights of the encoder are transferred as\ninitial parameters\
    \ into the CNN model for yield estimation. The last model was trained\nwith the\
    \ output of the autoencoder for the density map as input to the CNN model for\
    \ yield\nestimation instead of the RGB images. The CNN models with ﬂipped images\
    \ outperformed\nthe simple CNN model with an MAE % of 15.43. The models of transfer\
    \ learning from\nDensity Map Network Representation with MAE % of 11.79 achieved\
    \ the best performance\namong the other models. The last model with MAE % of 15.99\
    \ did not perform as well as\nthe fourth model because the accuracy of the density\
    \ map estimates was quite low. The\nresults show that transfer learning, when\
    \ used properly, can improve recognition accuracy.\nAguiar et al. [72] trained\
    \ SSD MobilenetV1 and the Inception model to detect Grape\nBunch in Mid Stage\
    \ and early stages and then transferred the trained model to the TPU-\nEdge device\
    \ to investigate the temporal accuracy of the model. The same strategy in [18]\n\
    was used to collect the dataset and it is publicly available (https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.\n\
    5114142, accessed on 3 November 2021) with 1929 vineyard images and their annotation.\n\
    Overall, SSD MobileNet-V1 performed better than the Inception model, as it had\
    \ a higher\nF_1 score, AP, and mAP. The early stage was more difﬁcult to detect\
    \ than the middle growth\nstage. The ﬁrst class represented smaller clusters that\
    \ were more similar in color and\ntexture to the surrounding foliage, making them\
    \ more difﬁcult to detect. SSD MobileNet-V1\nshowed an AP of 40.38% in detecting\
    \ clusters at an early growth stage and 49.48% at a\nmedium growth stage. In terms\
    \ of time, SSD MobileNet-V1 was more than four times faster\nthan the Inception\
    \ model on TPU-Edge Device.\nGhiani et al. [31] used Mask R-CNN with ResNet101\
    \ as a backbone which was pre-\ntrained with the dataset COCO (https://cocodataset.org/#home,\
    \ accessed on 18 November\n2021) for detecting grape branches on the tree. An\
    \ open-source dataset GrapeCS-ML [73]\ncontaining more than 2000 images without\
    \ annotation of ﬁfteen grape varieties at different\nstages of development in\
    \ three Australian vineyards was used to train the model. In\naddition to the\
    \ GrapeCS-ML dataset, 400 images were collected from the island of Sardinia\n\
    (Italy). The result obtained by applying the detector to the test samples was\
    \ an mAP value\nof 92.78%. To investigate the generalizability of the proposed\
    \ model, the model trained on\nthe GrapeCS-ML dataset was tested on its internal\
    \ dataset. The dataset contained different\ngrape varieties, vegetation, and colors\
    \ than the GrapeCS-ML dataset. An mAP of 89.90%\nwas obtained with the internal\
    \ dataset, indicating that the model can be used in other ﬁelds.\nTo investigate\
    \ the signiﬁcance of the size of the dataset used for training and the importance\n\
    of the augmentation techniques, the size of the original dataset was reduced to\
    \ 10% of the\ntraining images in one case with augmentation and the other case\
    \ without augmentation of\nthe dataset. The mAP was reduced by up to 5%, especially\
    \ in the experiments performed\nwithout augmentation. It was observed that the\
    \ recognition accuracy decreased for images\nwith overlap between clusters.\n\
    In Milella et al. [74], a system for the automatic estimation of harvest volume\
    \ and for\ndetecting grapes in vineyards using an RGB-D sensor on board an agricultural\
    \ vehicle has\nbeen proposed. An RGB-D sensor is a special type of depth detection\
    \ device that works in\nconjunction with an RGB camera and is able to add depth\
    \ information to the conventional\nimage pixel by pixel. The approach to determine\
    \ the crop volume involved three steps: the\n3D reconstruction of the vine rows,\
    \ the segmentation of the vines using a deep learning\nmethod, and the estimation\
    \ of the volume of each plant. In the ﬁrst step, the depth output\nRemote Sens.\
    \ 2022, 14, 638\n20 of 43\nfrom the camera was not used because the parameters\
    \ of the algorithm are ﬁxed and cannot\nbe conﬁgured. Instead, the semi Global\
    \ Matching (SGM) algorithm was used, which is a\ncomputer vision algorithm for\
    \ estimating a dense disparity map from a rectiﬁed stereo\nimage pair. A box-grid\
    \ ﬁlter is then used to merge the point clouds.\nIn segmentation, a segmentation\
    \ algorithm was ﬁrst used to separate the canopy from\nthe background using the\
    \ green–red vegetation index (GRVI), and then k-means were\nused to identify each\
    \ plant. Based on the results of the clustering algorithm, different\nplants were\
    \ calculated and an estimate of the volume per plant was performed. Finally, the\n\
    pre-trained AlexNet, VGG16 and VGG19, and GoogLeNet were trained to perform grape\n\
    cluster detection in 5 different classes (grapes, vineyard stakes, vine stems,\
    \ cordons, canes,\nleaves, and background). The VGG model performed the best with\
    \ an accuracy of 91.52.\nSantos et al. [26] used deep learning models and computer\
    \ vision models to estimate\ngrape wine yield from RGB images. Images were captured\
    \ with a Canon EOS REBEL T3i DSLR\ncamera and a Motorola Z2 Play smartphone from\
    \ five different grape varieties. The dataset\nnamed Embrapa Wine Grape Instance\
    \ Segmentation Dataset (WGISD) with 300 RGB images\nis publicly available (https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo3361736,\
    \ accessed on 18 November\n2021). Models from DL such as Mask R-CNN, YOLOv2, and\
    \ YOLOv3 were trained to detect\nand segment grapes in the images. Then, an image\
    \ processing algorithm called Structure-\nfrom-Motion (SfM) was used to perform\
    \ spatial registration, integrating the data generated by\nthe CNN-based step.\
    \ In the final step, the results of the CV model were used to remove the\nclusters\
    \ detected in different images to avoid counting the same clusters in several\
    \ images. The\nMask R-CNN with ResNet101 as the backbone outperformed YOLOv2 and\
    \ YOLOv3 in terms\nof object detection, but the YOLO model outperformed the Mask\
    \ R-CNN in terms of detection\ntime. The worst performance was obtained with YOLOv3.\
    \ To verify the performance of Mask\nR-CNN+SfM, 500 key-frames of a video were\
    \ used, and the result is shown in a video at\nhttps://youtu.be/1Hji3GS4mm4, accessed\
    \ on 17 November 2021.\nPalacios et al. [75] applied the method of deep learning\
    \ to detect the flowering of\nthe vine and used it for the estimation of early\
    \ yield estimation. Images of six grapevine\nvarieties were acquired using a mobile\
    \ platform developed at the University of La Rioja.\nThe RGB camera was a Canon\
    \ EOS 5D Mark IV RGB with a full-frame CMOS sensor. The\nground truth was acquired\
    \ using the algorithm in [76]. This algorithm was developed to\nprocess only images\
    \ with a single inflorescence and a dark background. In the first step,\nSegNet\
    \ was used with VGG (VGG16 and VGG19) as a backbone to segment and extract\nthe\
    \ inflorescences contained in the images. Then, these regions were used to count\
    \ the\nflowers in each inflorescence using three algorithms, including SegNet,\
    \ Watershed Flower\nSegmentation, and a linear model. The SegNet with VGG19 as\
    \ backbone outperformed the\nmodel with VGG16 in terms of IOU and F1-score. For\
    \ flower recognition, the SegNet model\nwith VGG19 was trained to classify a group\
    \ of flowers per image into three classes including\ncontour, center, and background.\
    \ After segmentation, false-positive filtering of flower\nsegmentation was performed.\
    \ Here, the flowers whose center and contour was segmented,\nand whose contour\
    \ surrounded the center above a certain threshold were considered as\ntrue positives.\
    \ The F1-score reached its highest value when contour filtering was set to 50%,\n\
    resulting in an F1-score of 0.729. The best F1-score for the watershed approach\
    \ was 0.708\nand the worst performance in counting flowers was obtained with linear\
    \ regression in the\nform of the Root Mean Square metric. The number of flowers\
    \ counted using SegNet-VGG19\nfor inflorescence extraction and flower detection,\
    \ and flower counting using the algorithm\nof [76] showed a correlation with R2\

    \ with\natrous convolution developed in Deeplab-v3+ to detect and segment the\
    \ apple in an\norchard for harvesting by a robot. Atrous convolution is a type\
    \ of convolutional layer that\nallows control of the resolution of the features\
    \ computed by the CNN. The dataset was\ncollected from an apple orchard as RGB-D\
    \ and RGB. The RGB-D was used to visualize the\nenvironment. A lightweight model,\
    \ Resnet 18, was used as the backbone of the DaNet-v2\nto ensure its deployment\
    \ on the Jetson-TX2 with limited computing capacity. In addition,\nthe model was\
    \ trained with the Resnet50 and Resnet101 backbones. The performance of\nthe model\
    \ with the Resnet101 backbone was compared with DaSNet-v1, YOLO-v3, faster-\n\
    RCNN, and the Mask-RCNN. DaSNet-v2 and Mask-RCNN with F1-score of 0.873 and\n\
    0.868, respectively, outperformed the other models. However, DaSNet-v2 outperformed\n\
    mask-RCNN with a computational efﬁciency between 306 and 436 ms with a time of\n\
    1.3 s. The results also show that single-stage detection models such as Yolo have\
    \ better\ncomputational efﬁciency compared to two-stage detectors. The model was\
    \ implemented\non Jetson-TX2, a lightweight backbone of Resnet-18, and the experimental\
    \ results show\nthat DaSNet-v2 with Resnet-18 can achieve similar performance\
    \ in recall and precision of\ndetection compared to YOLO-v3. Environmental factors\
    \ such as strong sunlight reﬂection,\nshadows, and appearance variations of fruits\
    \ in color, shape, occlusion, or viewing angle\ncould lead to false-negative detection\
    \ results. RGB-D images were processed using DaSNet-\nv2 and the PPTK toolbox,\
    \ a Python package for image visualization, to deploy the robot in\nthe orchard.\n\
    Koirala et al. [77] developed a DL model, called Mango-YOLO, based on YOLO-v3\n\
    and YOLO-v2 (tiny) for counting mangoes on trees. YOLOv2 (tiny) has a small architecture\n\
    with only nine convolutional layers, six pooling layers, and one detection layer,\
    \ sacriﬁcing\naccuracy for speed. YOLOv3 [22] is based on Darknet-53 and improves\
    \ upon YOLOv2 [78].\nThe Mango YOLO had 33 layers compared to 106 layers in YOLO-v3\
    \ and 16 layers in YOLO-\nv2 (tiny). The reduction in the number of layers is\
    \ expected to reduce computation time\nand detect mangoes more accurately. The\
    \ model was trained on the dataset collected from\nﬁve orchards. The Mango-YOLO\
    \ achieved better performance with an accuracy of 0.967%\ncompared to YOLO-v2\
    \ (tiny) (0.9% ) and YOLO-v3 (0.951%). In terms of time inference,\nthe Mango\
    \ YOLO with 15 ms was faster than YOLO-v3 (25 ms) and slower than YOLO-v2\n(tiny)\
    \ (10 ms). Moreover, Mango-YOLO was trained once from scratch on the augmented\n\
    dataset, and the second time transfer learning was used using the COCO dataset.\
    \ The\nmodels had the same performance on the test set, and the reason was explained\
    \ by the fact\nthat the COCO dataset does not contain Mango images. The false\
    \ detection over images\ntaken with Canon camera shows resizing of the images\
    \ and results in image distortion\nwith leaves taking a curved shape resembling\
    \ the fruit and overexposed areas on branches,\ntrunks, and leaves.\nLiang et\
    \ al. [79] applied the SSD network to detect mango and almond on tree fruits.\n\
    The dataset in [80] was used to train the model. The SSD model used the original\
    \ and\nsampled a patch such that the minimum Jaccard overlap with the objects\
    \ is 0.1, 0.3, 0.5,\n0.7, or 0.9, and ﬁnally randomly sampled the input image.\
    \ The size of each sampled area\nand the minimum Jaccard overlap are critical\
    \ for object detection. These two parameters\nwere changed to adopt the SSD model\
    \ for small mango detection. Using VGG16 as the\nbasic framework for the SDD outperformed\
    \ the SSD with ZFNet. Furthermore, using the\ninput image size of 400 × 400 and\
    \ 500 × 500 as the input of the model, the model achieved\nbetter performance\
    \ than SSD with an input size of 300 × 300. The model outperformed the\nfaster\
    \ RCNN in terms of speed and accuracy. The challenges related to mango detection\n\
    on the tree were considered in the paper: the size of mango on the whole image,\
    \ blocking\nthe mango with leaves, branches, resizing the original image, making\
    \ mango smaller, and\nsimilarity between mango and background.\nTian et al. [81]\
    \ developed YOLO-V3 with DenseNet as the backbone to detect apples\non trees.\
    \ They used two datasets for training. The ﬁrst one contained images of apples\
    \ at\none growth stage, and the second one contained images taken at different\
    \ growth stages.\nRemote Sens. 2022, 14, 638\n23 of 43\nThe model showed better\
    \ performance for mature apples than for young and growing\napples because the\
    \ color features were more prominent, the individual volume was larger,\nand there\
    \ was less overlap. The results also showed that the F1-score of the model trained\n\
    with the ﬁrst dataset was higher than that of the model trained with the second\
    \ dataset.\nThe performance of the trained model decreased for images with partial\
    \ occlusion of apples\nwith branches and leaves but is still an acceptable result\
    \ (IOU = 0.889 for mature apples ).\nThe model achieved the best performance compared\
    \ to Faster R-CNN, YOLOV2, and\nthe original YOLOv3. In terms of time inference,\
    \ the model was faster than Faster R-CNN\nand similar to YOLOv3. The F1-score\
    \ and IOU of the model without data augmentation\nmethods decreased by 0.033 and\
    \ 0.058, respectively.\nZhou et al. [82] implemented an SSD model with two lightweight\
    \ backbones Mo-\nbileNetV2 and InceptionV3, to develop an Android APP called KiwiDetector\
    \ that detects\nkiwis in the ﬁeld. Quantization is a technique for performing\
    \ computations and storing\ntensors with bit widths smaller than ﬂoating-point\
    \ numbers. When training a neural net-\nwork, 32-bit ﬂoating-point weights and\
    \ activation values are typically used. A quantized\nmodel performs some or all\
    \ operations with tensors using integers instead of ﬂoating-\npoint values. This\
    \ allows the computational complexity to be reduced and the trained\nmodel can\
    \ be used on devices with lower resource requirements. The quantization method\n\
    was used to compress the model size and improve the detection speed by quantizing\n\
    the weight tensor and activation function data of convolutional neural networks\
    \ from 32\nto bit ﬂoating-point numbers to an 8-bit integer. The results showed\
    \ that MobileNetV2,\nquantized MobileNetV2, InceptionV3, and quantized InceptionV3\
    \ achieve a true detec-\ntion rate of 90.8%, 89.7%, 87.6%, and 72.8%, respectively.\
    \ The quantized MobileNetV2 on\nthe Huawei P20 smartphone outperformed the other\
    \ models in terms of detection speed\n(103 ms/frame) and size. Although the SSD\
    \ with MobileNetV2 was more accurate than the\nSSD with quantized MobileNetV2,\
    \ the SSD with quantized MobileNetV2 was 37% faster.\nThe problem with kiwi detection\
    \ was that overlapping kiwis were reported, which the\nmodel counts as one kiwi.\n\
    3.8.3. Weed Detection\nBesides disease, weeds are considered to be a prevalent\
    \ threat to agricultural produc-\ntion. These are plants considered undesirable\
    \ in a particular situation, as they may compete\nwith crops for sunlight and\
    \ water, resulting in crop and economic loss. One signiﬁcant\nproblem in weed\
    \ control is that they are difﬁcult to detect and distinguish from crops\n[8].\
    \ DL algorithms can improve weed detection and discrimination at a lower cost\
    \ with\nreduced environmental problems and side effects. These technologies could\
    \ power robots\nthat detect and remove weeds.\nBah et al. [83] proposed a CNN\
    \ model with unsupervised training dataset annotation\ncollection for weed detection\
    \ in UAV images of bean and spinach ﬁelds. They assumed that\ncrops are grown\
    \ in regular rows and that plants growing between the rows are considered\nweeds.\
    \ The Hough transform was applied to the skeleton to detect the rate of plant\
    \ rows,\nand then a simple linear iterative clustering (SLIC) algorithm was applied\
    \ to create a\nmarker and delineate the plant rows. This algorithm generated superpixels\
    \ based on\nk-mean clustering. After row detection, a blob coloring algorithm\
    \ was used to identify the\nweeds. The unsupervised training dataset was used\
    \ to train ResNet18 for weed detection\nin the images. The supervised learning\
    \ method performed 6% better than the unsupervised\nlearning method in the bean\
    \ ﬁeld and about 1.5% better in the spinach ﬁeld. The low\nnumber of weeds between\
    \ rows may explain the difference in performance in the bean\nﬁeld. The performance\
    \ of the model was compared with SVM and RF. In general, ResNet18\nshows better\
    \ performance in supervised and unsupervised learning methods than SVM\nand RF.\n\

    \ Sens. 2022, 14, 638\n25 of 43\nFerreira et al. [36] implemented the unsupervised\
    \ learning models JULE and Deep-\nCluster to detect weeds in the ﬁeld. The JULE\
    \ consists of stacked multiple combinations of\nconvolutional layer, batch normalization\
    \ layer, ReLU layer, and pooling layer. AlexNet and\nVGG16 were implemented as\
    \ the basis of the DeepCluster model to extract features, and\nthen K-means is\
    \ used as the clustering algorithm. Two datasets, Grass-Broadleaf [84] and\nDeepWeeds\
    \ [85] were used in this work. The DeepCluster model performed better than\nthe\
    \ JULE model on both datasets with a large number of clusters. The DeepCluster\
    \ with a\nbase of Alexnet and VGG achieved similar performance, with Alexnet performing\
    \ better\non DeepWeed and VGG on the other dataset. To investigate the effect\
    \ of transfer learning\non unsupervised learning, the pre-trained VGG and AlexNet\
    \ were used on ImageNet. The\npre-trained model did not improve the accuracy of\
    \ Grass-Broadleaf, but it did improve the\naccuracy of DeepWeed. The data augmentation\
    \ also improved the accuracy of the unsuper-\nvised learning methods. They also\
    \ used semi-supervised data labeling. Semi-supervised\nlearning is a machine learning\
    \ approach that deals with the use of labeled and unlabeled\ndata. In the semi-supervised\
    \ method, labeled images from the DeepCluster model were\nused to train Inception-V3,\
    \ VGG, and ResNet. Inception-V3 and VGG outperformed ResNet\non the Grass-Broadleaf\
    \ and DeepWeeds dataset, respectively.\nMilioto et al. [86] modiﬁed Encoder–Decoder\
    \ CNN architecture in [87] to distinguish\nweeds from crops and soil. The number\
    \ of convolutional layers was decreased to reduce\ntime inference, and additional\
    \ vegetation indices (14 channels) were included in the input\nfor more accurate\
    \ detection. The dataset of three ﬁelds was used. Three networks were\ntrained\
    \ with different inputs: one with RGB images, another with RGB and near-infrared\n\
    (NIR) images, and the last one was trained with 14 channels such as RGB, Excess\
    \ Green\n(ExG), Excess Red (ExR), color index of Vegetation Extraction (CIVE),\
    \ and Normalized\nDifference Index (NDI). To investigate the generalization ability\
    \ of the proposed model,\nthe model was trained on the images of one ﬁeld and\
    \ tested on images of all ﬁelds. The\nresults indicate that feeding these 14-channels\
    \ into the input can speed up the training\nand improve the performance of the\
    \ model on the unseen dataset compared to the model\ntrained on RGB images and\
    \ RGB+NRI but still, the recall and precision of the model on the\nunseen ﬁeld\
    \ drop sharply (11–50%).\nAnother experience was conducted to investigate the\
    \ generalization capacity of the\nproposed model. The trained model was retrained\
    \ on the unseen dataset with 10, 20, 50, or\n100 images in the training set. The\
    \ performance of the RGB network when retrained with\n100 images is almost the\
    \ same as the performance of the proposed model trained with ten\nimages. The\
    \ inference time of the proposed model on PC and Jetson TX2 platform was also\n\
    found to be 44 ms and 210 ms, respectively, which is slower than the model trained\
    \ with\nRGB images with 31 ms and 190 ms, respectively.\nLottes et al. [30] developed\
    \ an encoder–decoder Fully Convolutional Network (FCN)\nwith the sequential model\
    \ for weed detection in sugar beet ﬁelds. The encoder–decoder\nFCN was used to\
    \ extract features from the input images, and the sequential model processed\n\
    the ﬁve images in a sequence using 3D convolution and output a sequence code that\
    \ was\nused to learn sequential information about the weeds in ﬁve images in a\
    \ sequence. The\nresults showed that the encoder-decoder with a sequential model\
    \ improved the F1-score of\nthe module by almost 11–14% compared to the encoder-decoder\
    \ FCN. The results indicated\nthat the changes in the visual appearance of the\
    \ images in the training and test dataset\ncould lead to a decrease in model performance,\
    \ and adding additional information, such as\nvegetation indices, leads to better\
    \ generalization for other ﬁelds.\nRemote Sens. 2022, 14, 638\n26 of 43\nTable\

    \ oilseed\nincluded in the paper were taken under completely different lighting\
    \ conditions. To mit-\nigate the effects of the different lighting conditions,\
    \ three image enhancement methods\nwere evaluated, including Histogram Equalization\
    \ (HE), Auto Contrast, and Deep Photo\nEnhancer. The models were also trained\
    \ with various inputs, including YCrCb and YCgCb\ncolor spaces and vegetation\
    \ indices such as Normalized Difference Index (NDI), Normal-\nized Difference\
    \ Vegetation Index (NDVI), Excess Green (ExG), Excess Red (ExR), Excess\nGreen\
    \ minus Excess Red (ExGR), Color Index of Vegetation (CIVE), Vegetative Index\
    \ (VEG),\nand Modiﬁed Excess Green Index (MExG), Combined Indices (COM1), and\
    \ COM2. For\nthe sugar beet dataset, the model trained with NIR images enhanced\
    \ by Auto Contrast\noutperformed the other models with a mean IOU of 87.13%. For\
    \ the Oilseeds dataset, the\nmodels were trained with RGB images only, and the\
    \ model trained with images enhanced\nby Deep Photo Enhancer outperformed the\
    \ other models (mIOU = 88.91%). Moreover, the\nauto-contrast method outperforms\
    \ other methods in terms of time inference.\n3.8.4. Species Recognition\nThe classiﬁcation\
    \ of species (e.g., insects, birds, and plants) is another critical aspect of\n\
    agricultural management. The traditional human approach to species classiﬁcation\
    \ requires\nspecialists in the ﬁeld and is time-consuming. Deep learning can provide\
    \ more accurate\nand faster results by analyzing real-world data.\nRußwurm and\
    \ Körner [90] trained LSTM and GRU models for multitemporal classiﬁ-\ncation,\
    \ which achieved high accuracy in crop classiﬁcation tasks for many crops. Images\n\
    were collected from SENTINEL 2A images between 31 December 2015 and 30 September\n\
    2016. For consistency with the LANDSAT series, the blue, green, red, near-infrared,\
    \ and\nshortwave infrared 1 and 2 bands were selected for this assessment. The\
    \ performance of the\nLSTM model was compared to the RNNs, the CNN model, and\
    \ a baseline SVM. The LSTM\nmodel outperformed the other models in terms of accuracy\
    \ in land cover classiﬁcation.\nLee et al. [91] used CNN to classify 44 plants\
    \ based on leaf images. Two datasets were\nprepared. One contained the entire\
    \ image of a leaf, and for the other, each leaf image was\nmanually cropped. The\
    \ accuracy of the CNN model trained with the second dataset was\nhigher than that\
    \ obtained with the ﬁrst dataset. The results showed that CNN can extract\nhigh-level\
    \ features such as structural subdivisions, leaf tip, leaf base, leaf margin,\
    \ etc., and\nis not limited to shape, color, and texture.\nAyhan et al. [92] implement\
    \ DeeplabeV3+, a CNN model developed from scratch\nand a machine learning method\
    \ that uses NDVI (NDVI+ML) to segment vegetation and\nnon-vegetation in the images.\
    \ The dataset of [93] belongs to two studied sites, Vasiliko in\nCyprus and Kimisala\
    \ in Rhodes Island, were used. The images were acquired using a UAV\nand a modiﬁed,\
    \ uncalibrated near-infrared camera. The image resolution of the Vasiliko\nimage\
    \ is 20 cm per pixel and these images were used to train the models. On the other\n\
    hand, the Kimisala dataset was used as a test set. The images in this dataset\
    \ contain two\ndifferent resolutions of 10 cm per pixel and 20 cm per pixel.\n\
    Two DeeplabeV3+ models were trained with RGB images as input and G, B bands\n\
    plus NDVI as the third channel. Although the loss of the DeeplabeV3+ model trained\
    \ from\nscratch with NDVI+GB was decreased, the test result was very poor. However,\
    \ the same\nmodel trained with transfer learning and NDVI+GB channels improved\
    \ the accuracy of the\nmodel compared to the model trained with RGB images (almost\
    \ one percent). The CNN\ndeveloped from scratch was also trained with two different\
    \ channels. The ﬁrst was trained\nwith RGB images and the second with four channels\
    \ of RGB and NIR. The model trained\nwith RGB and NIR outperformed the model trained\
    \ with RGB images with an accuracy of\n80.9% and an accuracy of 76%.\nIn the last\
    \ experience, the NDVI and the Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) of the\nmachine learning\
    \ model were used to classify the images. This method includes several\nthresholds\
    \ that need to be adjusted by the user. The NDVI+ML method outperformed the\n\
    Remote Sens. 2022, 14, 638\n28 of 43\nmodels from DL with an accuracy of 87%.\
    \ Note that the deep learning method in this work\nwas trained with a dataset\
    \ from one location and tested at another location with a different\nland cover.\
    \ This could be a reason why NDVI+ML outperformed the DL models.\nBhusal et al.\
    \ [94] used the pre-trained MobileNet on the ImageNet to classify bird\npests\
    \ in the image. Video data from a commercial vineyard captured with a GoPro Hero\n\
    4 outdoor camera with 1080P resolution was used as the dataset. In their work,\
    \ a motion\ndetection algorithm was used that is capable of detecting moving objects.\
    \ For each of these\nmoving objects, the abounded rectangle was extracted. These\
    \ moving objects were cropped\nfrom the original RGB image and reduced to 32 ×\
    \ 32. Each of these cropped images was\nreferred to as motion instance images\
    \ (MIIs). More than 5000 MIIs were collected from\ndifferent videos and classiﬁed\
    \ as bird or non-bird. In the next step, a CNN model developed\nin [95] was used\
    \ to improve image resolution. The images were converted from 32 × 32\nto 64 ×\
    \ 64, 96 × 96, and 128 × 128 and denoted as MIIs (e-MIIs), 2e-MIIs, 3e-MIIs, and\n\
    4e-MIIs, respectively. Five MobilNet models were trained with the MIIs, 2e-MIIs,\
    \ 3e-MIIs,\n4e-MIIs, and the entire Dataset. The worth results in terms of accuracy\
    \ were obtained with\na model trained with MIIs, and the best result was obtained\
    \ with the model trained with\nall the datasets.\nMac Aodha et al. [96] used the\
    \ CNN models from scratch to detect bats from audio\nﬁles. Two CNN models called\
    \ CNNFULL with three convolutional layers and 32 ﬁlters and\nCNNFAST consisting\
    \ of two convolutional layers and 16 ﬁlters were trained. The audio\nﬁles were\
    \ converted to a spectrogram and used as input to the CNN model. CNNFULL and\n\
    CNNFAST took 53 and 9.5 s, respectively, to run the entire detection pipeline\
    \ on the 3.2-min\nfull-spectrum test dataset. CNNFAST showed a trade-off between\
    \ speed and accuracy with\nslightly lower performance compared to CNNFULL.\nThe\
    \ performance of the models was compared with three existing commercial closed-\n\
    source detection systems, including SonoBat (version 3.1.7p) (https://sonobat.com/,\
    \ ac-\ncessed on 26 November 2021); SCAN’R (version 1.7.7), and Kaleidoscope (version\
    \ 4.2.0\nalpha4) (https://www.wildlifeacoustics.com/products/kaleidoscope-pro,\
    \ accessed on 26\nNovember 2021), as well as a machine learning method RF. The\
    \ CNN model signiﬁcantly\noutperformed the other algorithms in terms of mAP.\n\
    Ramalingam et al. [97] used Internet of Things (IoT) based architecture for insect\n\
    detection. The Internet is a global system of interconnected computer networks\
    \ that use\nTransmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol (TCP/IP) to connect\
    \ billions of computers\nworldwide [98]. The IoT, on the other hand, is a global\
    \ network of physical objects equipped\nwith sensors and actuators that connect\
    \ to the Internet in real-time to be identiﬁed, sensed,\nand controlled remotely\
    \ [98]. The IoT architecture used in [97] consists of four layers:\nperception\
    \ layer, transport layer, processing layer, and application layer. In the perception\n\
    layer, a smart wireless camera captures an image of a sticky insect trap. The\
    \ transport\nlayer uses WiFi communication and TCP/IP to send images to the processing\
    \ layer and\ntransmit processed data to the application layer. In the processing\
    \ layer, an Fast RCNN\nwith ResNet50 is used to detect the insect in the images.\
    \ In the ﬁnal stage, smartphones and\nweb interfaces are used to perform the application\
    \ layer tasks. The experimental results\nshow that the trained model achieves\
    \ 96% accuracy in insect detection and outperforms\nYOLO and SSD in terms of accuracy.\n\
    3.8.5. Soil Management\nFor experts in agriculture, soil is a heterogeneous natural\

    30 of 43\nLi et al. [99] used a bidirectional LSTM model to estimate soil temperature\
    \ at 30 sites\nunder ﬁve different climate types. Soil temperature (ST) measurements\
    \ were obtained\nfrom the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s National Water and\
    \ Climate Center, which\nhas established more than 200 sites across the country\
    \ to collect data on meteorology,\nsoil, and solar radiation. Two models were\
    \ trained with different inputs and outputs.\nThe ﬁrst model received the meteorological\
    \ weather conditions including daily hours,\nminimum and maximum air temperature,\
    \ minimum and maximum relative humidity,\nvapor pressure, average solar radiation,\
    \ and average wind speed, and outputted the soil\ntemperature amplitude obtained\
    \ by subtracting the daily average soil temperature from the\nhourly soil temperature.\
    \ The second model obtained the meteorological weather conditions\nincluding month,\
    \ day of the month, observed air temperature, dew point temperature,\nminimum\
    \ and maximum air temperature, minimum and maximum relative humidity,\nvapor pressure,\
    \ average solar radiation, average wind speed, and outputted the daily\naverage\
    \ ST. To calculate the hourly ST, the output of the ﬁrst model was added with\

    \ result of the\nmodel was compared with the BiLSTM model, which directly estimates\
    \ the hourly ST, the\nLSTM model, the deep neural network, random forest, SVR,\
    \ and Linear Regression. The\nintegrated BiLSTM model outperformed the other models\
    \ in terms of MAE, RMSE, and R2.\nThe LSTM model achieved the second-best performance.\n\
    It was also found that the performance of each model is not as good in snowy areas\
    \ as\nin warm or dry areas and that, the accuracy of the other models increases\
    \ with soil depth\n(except for RF). This behavior could be due to a change in\
    \ the standard deviation of the soil\ntemperature at different depths and climate\
    \ types, but this is not investigated in the study.\nYu et al. [100] implement\
    \ CNN (Conv2D, Conv3D), ConvLSTM to estimate the soil\ntemperature. The difference\
    \ between Conv2D and Conv3D is the size of the input channels.\nIn the ConvLSTM\
    \ model [101], there are convolution structures in both the input-to-state\nand\
    \ state-to-state transitions. The model obtains the last ten days of historical\
    \ data from\nspatiotemporal ST and predicts the ST one, three, and ﬁve days in\
    \ advance. Each model\nwas trained with two different input channels. The ﬁrst\
    \ time the raw data from ST was\nfed into the model, the second time, the input\
    \ was processed using the Empirical Mode\nDecomposition (EMD) method, which is\
    \ a proposed method for processing signals. In\nthe EMD method, the number of\
    \ channels was increased from one to ten. To complement\nthe model DL, persistent\
    \ prediction (PF) is used, a simple prediction method that treats\nthe temperature\
    \ of the ﬁrst day as a prediction for the next day. When forecasting ST\nwith\
    \ one-day historical data, PF outperformed the models of DL with raw data input.\n\
    On the other hand, when the models of DL used the EEMD- processed data as input,\
    \ the\nprediction performance was signiﬁcantly improved. Among all the models,\
    \ EEMD-Conv3D\nperformed the best in predicting the spatiotemporal ST. It could\
    \ be noted that ST depends\nnot only on the historical data of ST but also on\
    \ the meteorological weather conditions,\nwhich can be used as input to the model\
    \ to improve the accuracy.\nAlibabaei et al. [102] used Bidirectional LSTM (BLSTM),\
    \ CNN-LSTM, and a simple\nLSTM model to model daily reference evapotranspiration\
    \ and soil–water content. Meteo-\nrological weather data for three sites in Portugal\
    \ were collected from the stations Póvoa\nde Atalaia, Estação Borralheira, and\
    \ Direção Regional de Agricultura e Pescas do Centro,\nPortugal. Evapotranspiration\
    \ was calculated from meteorological data using the FAO\nPenman–Monteith equation\
    \ and soil water content was retrieved from ERA5 land. The\nBLSTM model with an\
    \ MSE of 0.014 to 0.056 outperformed the LSTM, CNN, and CNN-\nLSTM models. The\
    \ performance of BLSTM was also compared with traditional machine\nlearning methods\
    \ such as Random Forest and SVR and outperformed these two models.\nAmong the\
    \ machine learning methods, RF outperformed the SVR model. The model was\nnot\
    \ tested with data measured in the ﬁeld. For use in the ﬁeld, it can be re-trained\
    \ with a\nsmall set of ﬁeld-measured data to be used with more conﬁdence in real-world\
    \ applications.\nRemote Sens. 2022, 14, 638\n31 of 43\nTable 7. Feature descriptions\

    \ has implications for hydrological, climatological,\nand agronomic balance [8].\
    \ Five papers on the topic were reviewed, where machine learning\nmodels are employed\
    \ to estimate various values, such as evapotransition, allowing for\nmore effective\
    \ use of irrigation systems, and water table detection, which helps determine\n\
    crop water needs.\nSaggi and Jain [103] used multilayer perceptrons (MLP) to evaluate\
    \ daily evapotranspi-\nration for irrigation scheduling. They developed their\
    \ model from scratch. The developed\nDL model performed well in estimating evapotranspiration\
    \ and outperformed ML models\nsuch as RF, Generalized Linear Model (GLM), and\
    \ Gradient Boosting Models (GBM).\nZhang et al. [104] presented an LSTM-based\
    \ model for water management in agri-\ncultural areas. The LSTM model with a R2\
    \ value of 0.789–0.952 outperformed the fully\nconnected network. As mentioned\
    \ in the paper, the prediction of water table depth can\nhelp engineers and decision-makers\
    \ to develop an optimal irrigation scheduling system\nwhile controlling the effects\
    \ of salinity on intensive irrigation.\nLoggenberg et al. [105] applied hyperspectral\
    \ sensing and machine learning to model\nwater stress in vineyards. Stem water\
    \ potential (SWP) was measured in the ﬁeld by using a\npressure chamber to determine\
    \ vine water stress status. Vines with SWP values between\n−1.0 MPa and −1.8 MPa\
    \ were classiﬁed as water-stressed, while vines with SWP values\n−0.7 MPa were\
    \ classiﬁed as not stressed. Images were acquired using the SIMERA HX MkII\nhyperspectral\
    \ sensor, which detects 340 spectral wavebands in the VIS and NIR. A spectral\n\
    subset consisting of 176 wavebands with a spectral range of 473–708 nm was used\
    \ as\ninput to the models. Two ML models Random Forest (RF) and Extreme Gradient\
    \ Boosting\n(XGBoost) were used for classiﬁcation. In the ﬁrst experience, RF\
    \ and XGBoost models\nused all wavebands (176 bands) as input. RF with an accuracy\
    \ of 83.3% outperformed\nXGBoost with an accuracy of 78%. When using a subset\
    \ of important wavebands (18 bands),\nthe accuracy of RF and XGBoost was improved\
    \ (RF = 93.3% and XGBoost = 90%). The\nresults show that the choice of input to\
    \ the model in ML is crucial and should be carefully\nselected. The effect of\
    \ smoothing the spectral data with the Savitzky–Golay ﬁlter in the data\npreprocessing\
    \ step was also investigated in the paper. The Savitzky–Golay ﬁlter reduces\n\
    the model accuracy ranging between 0.7% and 3.3%.\nChen et al. [40] used a deep\
    \ Q-learning (DQN) model for an irrigation decision\nstrategy based on short-term\
    \ weather forecasts for rice. Daily observed meteorological\ndata of the rice-growing\
    \ period at three stations, including daily minimum and maximum\ntemperature,\
    \ average temperature, average wind speed, sunshine duration, average relative\n\
    humidity, and precipitation were collected. The state-space consisted of Pt is\
    \ the predicted\nprecipitation sequence for the next 7 days on day t , mm; ht\
    \ is the water depth on day t, mm;\nhmin is the lower limit of water depth, mm;\
    \ hmax is the upper limit of water depth, mm;\nHp is the maximum allowable water\
    \ depth after precipitation. In the action space, three\npossible actions were\
    \ included, representing the fraction of the irrigation quota (irrigation\nto\
    \ hmax) to be supplied to the ﬁeld on day t. Action 0 returns 0%, action 1 returns\
    \ 50%, and\naction 2 returns 100%. The reward is based on the rainfall use reward\
    \ and the yield reward.\nThe results of the DQN irrigation strategy compared to\
    \ the results of the conventional\nirrigation strategy showed a signiﬁcant reduction\
    \ in irrigation water volume, irrigation\ntiming, and drainage water without yield\
    \ loss.\nAlibabaei et al. [38] uses the DQN model to schedule irrigation of a\
    \ tomato ﬁeld in\nPortugal using climate Big Data. Historical data are collected\
    \ from various sources and\nprocessed for use as input. Two LSTM models are trained\
    \ on the obtained historical data to\npredict the total soil water in the soil\
    \ proﬁle for the next day and the tomato yield at the\nend of a season, respectively.\n\
    The trained LSTM models were used in the DRL training environment, which takes\n\
    the current state (historical climate data) and action (amount of irrigation)\
    \ and then returns\nthe next state and reward. The reward was calculated as the\
    \ net return and the Q-value\nRemote Sens. 2022, 14, 638\n33 of 43\nwas estimated\
    \ using an LSTM model. The results show that the agent learns to avoid water\n\
    waste at the beginning of the season and water stress at the end of the season.\
    \ Compared\nto the threshold and ﬁxed irrigation method, the DQN agent increases\
    \ productivity by 11%\nand avoids water waste by 20–30%.\n3.8.7. Automation in\
    \ Agriculture\nDeep learning is also being used to control sensors and robots\
    \ that enable automation\nand optimization of agricultural processes. These robots\
    \ can be used for a variety of\npurposes, including automated seeding, pesticide,\
    \ and crop nutrient application, damage\nrepair, irrigation, weed detection and\
    \ removal, harvesting, etc.\nLi et al. [52] used a deep-learning algorithm to\
    \ quickly and accurately detect and\nlocate longan fruit in imagery and pick the\
    \ fruit with a UAV device. An RGB-D camera\non the UAV was used to collect images\
    \ of the fruits. As mentioned in the paper, one of\nthe disadvantages of UAVs\
    \ is that they are easily affected by local circulation and airﬂow\nwhen capturing\
    \ images, resulting in blurred images of the fruits. In the preprocessing of\n\
    the data, a Fuzzy image processing algorithm was used to remove the blurred images\
    \ from\nthe data set.\nFPN, YOLOv3, YOLOv4, MobileNet-SSD, YOLOv4-tiny, and MobileNet-YOLOv4\n\
    models were trained on the images to detect and locate string fruits, simple fruits,\
    \ and fruit\nbranches. In the ﬁnal phase, the detection results are mapped onto\
    \ the optimized depth\nimage to extract the contours and spatial information of\
    \ the three targets. Based on this in-\nformation, the drone can detect and locate\
    \ the fruits and use them in harvesting. In general,\nthe YOLO models had faster\
    \ detection speed and achieved better accuracy than the FPN\nand SSD models. MobileNet-YOLOv4\
    \ achieved the best performance in terms of accuracy\n(mAP = 89.73) and inference\
    \ time (68 s), while FPN achieved the worst performance.\nTo test the model in\
    \ orchards, a picking platform was developed with a UAV, a Jetson\nTX2, an RGB-D\
    \ camera, a set of scissors with clamps, and a support frame. The accuracy\nrate\
    \ of successful harvesting in four cases was reported as 75, 75, 69.23, and 68.42.\n\
    Aghi et al. [106] presents a low-cost, energy-efﬁcient local motion planner for\
    \ au-\ntonomous navigation of robots in vineyards based on RGB-D images, low-range\
    \ hardware\n(a low-cost device with low power and limited computational capabilities),\
    \ and two control\nalgorithms. The ﬁrst algorithm uses the disparity map and its\
    \ depth representation to\ngenerate proportional control for the robot platform.\
    \ The second backup algorithm, based\non a deep learning algorithm, takes control\
    \ of the machine when the ﬁrst block brieﬂy fails\nand generates high-level motion\
    \ primitives.\nAn Intel RealSense Depth Camera D435i RGB-D camera was used to\
    \ capture images\nand compute the depth map on the platform. The video was captured\
    \ in different terrain,\nquality, and time of day. Then, a light depth map-based\
    \ algorithm processes the depth\nmaps to detect the end of the vineyard row and\
    \ then calculates control values for linear and\nangular velocities using a proportional\
    \ controller. Since, as in many outdoor applications,\nsunlight negatively affects\
    \ the quality of the results and interferes with the control provided\nby the\
    \ local navigation algorithm, MobileNet was trained to classify whether the camera\n\
    was pointed at the center of the end of the vineyard row or one of its sides,\
    \ and it was used\nwhen the ﬁrst algorithm failed due to outdoor conditions. The\
    \ CNN model was trained\nwith transfer learning and classiﬁed the images into\
    \ three classes: Middle, Left, and Right.\nFor the middle class, the video was\
    \ taken in rows with the camera pointed at the center,\nand for the other two\
    \ classes, the videos were rotated left and right with the camera at a\n45-degree\
    \ angle to the long axis of the row. The accuracy of the model on the test set\
    \ was\none. The model was trained on a small portion of the data set to investigate\
    \ the signiﬁcance\nof the size of the data set. The accuracy of the model decreased\
    \ by 6% with the small\ndata set.\nRemote Sens. 2022, 14, 638\n34 of 43\nTable\

    \ optimized by discarding all redundant operations and\nreducing the ﬂoating-point\
    \ accuracy from 32 to 16 bits. The accuracy of the optimized\nmodel was the same\
    \ as the original and the time inference was improved. The proposed\nmodel was\
    \ implemented on a robot and the tests were performed in a new vineyard\nscenario.\
    \ The ﬁrst algorithm can detect the end of the vineyard regardless of the direction\n\
    of the long axis of the robot. When the ﬁrst algorithm fails, the CNN model jumps\
    \ in and\ndetects the end of the vineyard.\nBadeka et al. [107] trained YOLOv3\
    \ to detect grape crates in the ﬁeld for use on robots\nharvesting grapes. The\
    \ images of the crate were taken under natural ﬁeld conditions. Three\ndata enhancement\
    \ techniques were used, including rotation, noise, processing, and blur\nprocessing.\
    \ The model achieved an accuracy of 99.74% (mAP%) with an inference time\nof 0.26\
    \ s. To use the trained model on robots, it must be deployed on edge devices and\n\
    report the inference time and accuracy of the model on these devices. Another\
    \ interesting\nproblem is that the robot can detect whether the box is full or\
    \ not.\nMajeed et al. [108] combined the DL model with mathematical models to\
    \ detect\ncordons in grape canopies and determine their trajectories. Images were\
    \ taken so that a tree\ntrunk was approximately in the center of the ﬁeld of view\
    \ of a high-resolution camera (Sony\nCyber-shot RX100 IV). A total of 191 images\
    \ of random RGB images were captured from two\ndifferent vineyard blocks with\
    \ different cultivars. Each image in the dataset was classiﬁed\ninto three classes:\
    \ Background, Trunk, and Cordon (http://hdl.handle.net/2376/16939,\naccessed on\
    \ 1 September 2021). Since the background pixels in the labeled images covered\n\
    most of the images, a weight was assigned to each class in the preprocessing of\
    \ the data,\nwhich was calculated using a median frequency class balancing method\
    \ to avoid bias during\ntraining. Data augmentation and transfer learning techniques\
    \ were used in this work.\nA fully convolutional neural network (FCN) and SegNet\
    \ with VGG and AlexNet\nbackbones were trained to segment the cordons in the images.\
    \ The FCN-VGG16 network\nachieved the best performance in terms of mean accuracy\
    \ and F1-score compared to the\nother networks. In the next step, the mathematical\
    \ model including the Fourier model,\nGaussian model, polynomial model, and sine\
    \ sum model was applied to estimate the\ntrajectory of the cordons. The sixth-order\
    \ polynomial equation with an average R2 value of\n0.99 had the best ﬁt for the\
    \ trajectories of the cordons compared to the other mathematical\nmodels tested.\n\
    Pinto de Aguiar et al. [109] trained seven different DL models for detecting grapevine\n\
    stems in two vineyards in Portugal. The trained models included Single Shot Multi-\n\
    box (SSD) MobileNet-V1 (α = 0.75), SSD MobileNet-V1 with different hyperparameters\n\
    (α = 0.75), SSD MobileNet-V2, Pooling Pyramid Network (PPN) MobileNet-V1, SSDLite\n\
    MobileNet-V2, SSD Inception-V2, Tiny YOLO-V3. In this work, Transfer Learning\
    \ was ap-\nplied using the COCO dataset. A dataset was created using a robotic\
    \ platform. This dataset\ncontains images captured in two different vineyards,\
    \ using two cameras each, including\nthe Raspberry Pi cameras and a conventional\
    \ infrared ﬁlter, and the other camera Mako\nG-125C and an infrared ﬁlter (dataset\
    \ is available at http://vcriis01.inesctec.pt/-DS_AG_39,\naccessed on 1 September\

    and a frontal thermal camera was used to capture a video from which the images\
    \ were\nextracted. Data augmentation methods such as rotation, translation, scaling,\
    \ ﬂipping, hue\nand saturation, Gaussian noise, and random combination were used\
    \ to resize the dataset\nto a suitable size for the seepage learning method. Two\
    \ training datasets were used to\nevaluate the effect of the training dataset\
    \ size on the performance of the detectors. The\noriginal VineSet dataset and\
    \ a small subset of it containing 336 non-augmented images\nwere used. The SSD\

    \ was faster\nthan SSD Inception. The performance of the models trained with a\

    \ to\nsigniﬁcant failures [18,72,106] and even with transfer learning and data\
    \ augmentation,\ntraining the model may require a sufﬁcient amount of data [55].\
    \ The presence of the image\nunder ﬁeld conditions in the data set is very important\
    \ [63]. Therefore, collecting authentic\nﬁeld images and datasets under different\
    \ conditions is the ﬁrst and most important step.\nRemote Sens. 2022, 14, 638\n\
    38 of 43\nUsing open-source datasets, sharing the dataset with other researchers,\
    \ data augmentation,\nand transfer learning properly can help to overcome these\
    \ challenges [71,77].\nIn addition, agricultural image datasets are more complex\
    \ due to outdoor conditions,\nthe object of interest usually occupying a very\
    \ small and uncentered part of the image,\nsimilarity between objects and background,\
    \ blocking the object with leaves and branches,\nmultiple objects in one image,\
    \ and many more [31,63,65,68,79,82]. To be applicable in the\nreal world, the\
    \ dataset should fully represent the state of the environment. In some cases,\n\
    such as variable illuminance, data augmentation may also be helpful.\nThe type\
    \ of input affects the performance of the model [55,62,88,92]. Removing\nbackground\
    \ from images [55], using different color spaces and vegetarian indices as in-\n\
    put [62], detecting crop at different growth stages [81], adding vegetarian indices\
    \ to the\ninput [30,86], cropping the input image [91], and data from different\
    \ climate types [99]\nchange the performance of the model. The size of the input\
    \ also affects the runtime and\naccuracy of the model [62,79]. Therefore, it is\
    \ challenging to determine the best input set\nfor the speciﬁc task.\nLabeling\
    \ large amounts of data is expensive and time-consuming [55]. In addition,\nthere\
    \ are some tasks, such as those related to plant diseases, that can only be performed\n\
    by specialists in the ﬁeld. Even when using open-source datasets with already\
    \ annotated\ndata, there is no way to ﬁnd out who actually did the annotation.\
    \ As it was seen in\nseveral papers, data augmentation and transfer learning are\
    \ ways to avoid labeling a\nlarge dataset, but labeling a small dataset is still\
    \ time-consuming [55]. Unsupervised and\nsemi-supervised learning methods can\
    \ be of great help but need further investigation in\nthis area [35,36,61,83].\n\
    When choosing a model for a task, there is a tradeoff between accuracy and inference\n\
    time [26,34,65,67,77,96]. Depending on the application, the model can be chosen.\n\
    Neither environment is similar in the ﬁeld of agriculture, and each environment\
    \ and\nproblem requires its own dataset, and therefore the DL model may not be\
    \ universally\napplicable, i.e., if a model has been trained with a dataset from\
    \ a particular site or a dataset\nfrom an open-source site such as ImageNet, it\
    \ may not be able to be used at another site, or\naccuracy may decrease when applied\
    \ to the dataset collected in the real world [12,69]. The\nchanges in the visual\
    \ appearance of the images in the training and test dataset could lead\nto a decrease\
    \ in model performance [30]. One way to overcome this is to retrain the already\n\
    trained model with a small dataset from the new environment [86].\nThe design\
    \ of deep models is complex and they are referred to as black boxes [7]. One\n\
    of the challenges in training DL models is that a system with very high computational\n\
    power (GPU) is needed [7]. Moreover, the performance of these models depends on\
    \ the\nchoice of hyperparameters, loss functions, and optimization algorithm [60,67].\
    \ Algorithms\nsuch as Bayesian optimization [110] can help to ﬁnd the right hyperparameters\
    \ [102].\nGoogle researchers used neural architecture search (NAS) algorithm [111]\
    \ to ﬁnd state of\nthe art MobilenetV3 [112]. NAS is a method that searches among\
    \ all possible combinations\nof submodules that can be repeatedly assembled to\
    \ obtain the entire model with the best\npossible accuracy.\nThe other challenge\
    \ relates to the real-time applicability of the models. Most deep\nlearning models\
    \ have many parameters that need to be trained, and after training the\nmodel,\
    \ inference of the model is not made in real-time. In some applications, such\
    \ as using\na robot for harvesting, time inference is essential. As we see in\
    \ this work, most of the\nmodels are implemented and tested on the PC, which requires\
    \ power and it is impractical\nin real applications. Moreover, implementation\
    \ on devices such as smartphones still, brings\nvarious challenges that need to\
    \ be considered, such as memory consumption, speed, etc.\nSingle-stage detection\
    \ models such as YOLO and SSD, lightweight classiﬁcation models\nsuch as MobileNet,\
    \ the development of edge devices such as Raspberry Pi and Jetson nano,\nand the\
    \ use of cloud computing have made it possible to deploy Deep Learning models\
    \ in\nreal-world applications and practical ways [34,52,72,86,109]. The quantization\
    \ method can\nbe also used to compress the model size and improve the detection\
    \ speed [82].\nRemote Sens. 2022, 14, 638\n39 of 43\nOn small farms, the use of\
    \ some methods is sometimes impractical because farmers\nmust have some knowledge\
    \ to interpret the results obtained. For example, the model\nthat predicts soil\
    \ moisture for irrigation scheduling requires a human expert to use this\ninformation\
    \ to determine the best time and amount of water for irrigation. As mentioned\n\
    earlier, Deep Reinforcement Learning is showing great success in several areas\
    \ as a promis-\ning model for building smart farms in several areas [39]. The\
    \ model can be trained to\nmake decisions about when and how much to irrigate\
    \ [38,40]. Information generated by\nIoT devices also helps farmers track agricultural\
    \ operations and make better decisions to\nimprove agricultural productivity [97].\n\
    5. Conclusions\nThis paper discussed some recent work on the application of DL\
    \ to agriculture and\nbiodiversity and highlighted some challenges in this area.\
    \ More sustainable agriculture\nand the promotion of biodiversity in agricultural\
    \ systems can be achieved by reducing the\nuse of agrochemicals, low pesticide\
    \ use and organic farming, appropriate crop rotations,\nsmall-scale ﬁelds, and\
    \ the preservation of natural spaces between agroecosystems [113]. As\nmentioned,\
    \ this can be achieved through the new IoT technology in combination with the\n\
    new biodiversity algorithms and Artiﬁcial Intelligence model. They can be used\
    \ to detect\nand control species and also to improve ecosystem state and thus\
    \ productivity having to\nresort to the use of environmentally damaging practices.\n\
    The novelty of the application of DL models and the challenges identiﬁed in agriculture\n\
    demonstrates the need for further research. CNN is the most widely used DL model\
    \ in\nagriculture. The use of new methods, such as attention mechanisms, new lightweight\n\
    models, single-stage detection models, can improve the performance of the model,\
    \ as a\nslight improvement in accuracy and run time can signiﬁcantly improve the\
    \ ﬁnal results.\nIn the future, we expect to develop or improve models that help\
    \ farmers make crop\nmanagement decisions. These models can be integrated into\
    \ decision support tools, and\nthese tools can guide users through precise steps\
    \ and suggest optimal decision paths. It is\nexpected that the development of\
    \ these models will also enable biodiversity monitoring.\nConsequently, the adoption\
    \ of new sustainable practices supported by DL models and\nbiodiversity monitoring\
    \ will help manage the farm with minimal human intervention and\ngreater effectiveness.\n\

  data_sources: Spectral data of soil samples with varying water and salt content
    collected from Xinjiang, China
  description: Rapidly inverting soil salinity is crucial to the soil water and salt
    migration for the prevention of the secondary salinization. However, the accuracy
    and efficiency of soil salinity inversion models are hindered to the coupling
    relationship between water and salt in soil, particularly for time-consuming and
    labor-intensive soil collection. This study aims to reduce the interference of
    soil moisture for obtaining better sample diversity and further improving the
    robustness of soil salinitu inversion models by using spectral technology. A total
    of 113 normal and 115 saline soil samples were collected in the Xinjiang cotton
    fields. These samples were further subjected to different levels of wetting treatment.
    and subsequently 467 soil samples with varing salt and moisture contents were
    obtained. Soil salt content was calibrated using the conductivity of soil leaching
    solution. Spectral data of samples was captured using an ASD ground object spectrometer
    (400-1000 nm) and a near-infrared spectrometer (960-1693 nm). The soil moisture
    was also corrected using the external parameter orthogonalization (EPO). Additionally,
    deep convolutional generative adversarial networks (DCGAN) with different transposed
    convolution stride strategies were designed to evaluate the sample set using Fréchet
    Inception Distance (FID) scores. Machine learning models were employed to invert
    the soil salinity, including partial least squares regression (PLSR), random forest
    (RF), and one-dimensional convolutional neural network (1D-CNN) models using VGG
    (VNet), EfficientNet (ENet), and ResNet (RNet) architectures. The results demonstrated
    that the EPO can effectively reduce the interference of moisture on the salinity,
    indicating the better prediction performance of different models. RNet out performed
    PLSR, RF, VNet, Enet, RNet, and exhibited the best performance to predict the
    soil salinity in cotton fields. The lightweight residual neural network without
    attention mechanism was more suitable for one-dimensional hyperspectral data.
    There was an increase in the convolution stride and kernel length of the deep
    convolutional adversarial generative network. The better samples were obtained
    for the hyperspectral data with long sequences. The superior FID scores were achieved
    in the generated augmented sample set using Generator B (designed with the larger
    convolution stride and kernel size), compared with the rest. Specifically, the
    FID scores were reduced by 7.9% and 13.4%, respectively, compared with GA and
    GC. The weight distribution of attention was optimized after expanding the training
    set by DCGAN. The stability and accuracy of the model were further enhanced to
    predict the soil salinity under certain constraints on training samples. The EPO-DCGAN(GB)-RNet
    (called EPO-DCGAN-RNet) model was achieved in the superior RMSE and R2 values
    of 136.472 μS/cm and 0.910, respectively, on the validation set, compared with
    the EPO-SG-RNet (using SG filtering denoising) and EPO-RNet (without sample augmentation).
    Furthermore, 1D-CNN with Grad CAM was employed to identify the characteristic
    bands of soil conductivity in the soil leaching solution of cotton field. In summary,
    an accurate inversion model EPO-DCGAN-RNet was constructed for inversing soil
    salinity in the cotton fields using spectral technology. Water correction and
    sample augmentation were incorporated for the soil salt composition. The improved
    model has the promising potential to the salt-tolerant cotton varieties and irrigation
    strategies using slightly salty water in cotton fields.

  explanation: The study utilizes a combination of visible/near-infrared (400–1000
    nm) and long-wave near-infrared (960–1693 nm) spectroscopy to collect spectral
    data from soil samples with varying water and salt content. It explores the effectiveness
    of combining external parameter orthogonalization (EPO) for moisture correction,
    deep convolutional generative adversarial networks (DCGAN) for sample augmentation,
    and a one-dimensional convolutional neural network with residual connections (RNet)
    for soil salinity inversion. The approach seeks to enhance the robustness and
    accuracy of soil salinity prediction models.
  extract_1: “Combining EPO to correct the soil moisture content variation resulted
    in improved prediction performance of different models, indicating the successful
    removal of the moisture interference. The proposed EPO-DCGAN-RNet method achieved
    superior performance compared to traditional machine learning methods and other

    资源附件 摘要: 棉田土壤盐分的精准反演对于棉花的种植管理具有重要意义。水分和盐分作为主要环境因素，共同影响棉田土壤的波谱特征，两者之间的耦合关系直接影响土壤盐分的检测分析。为了提高基于光谱技术构建的模型对棉田土壤盐分信息解析的准确性与可靠性，该研究联用可见/短波近红外（400～1
    000 nm）和长波近红外（960～1 693 nm）技术，采集不同含水率与含盐量的新疆地区土壤样本的光谱；结合外部参数正交法（external parameter
    orthogonalization，EPO），校正不同标样集与不同波段光谱中的土壤含水率干扰信息；引入基于不同卷积步幅的深度卷积对抗网络（deep convolutional
    generative adversarial networks，DCGAN），进行样本增广与质量评估；参考三层残差神经网络设计一维卷积神经网络RNet，最终构建基于EPO-DCGAN-RNet的优化模型，用于棉田土壤盐分的反演。结果表明，与传统机器学习方法和基于VGG或EfficientNet结构一维卷积神经网络相比，该研究提出的EPO-DCGAN-RNet方法能够有效地滤除水分对盐分反演的影响、提高模型对特征波段的挖掘能力、降低深度学习算法对样本量的依赖性，并能得到更优的模型预测性能。EPO-DCGAN-RNet的建模集R2和均方根误差分别为0.942、115.420
    μS/cm，验证集R2和均方根误差分别为0.910和136.472 μS/cm。研究结果可为新疆棉田土壤盐分快速精准检测提供理论指导和技术支持，有助于促进盐碱地区棉花种植的水肥科学管理。

    is crucial to the soil water and salt migration for the prevention of the secondary
    salinization. However, the accuracy and efficiency of soil salinity inversion
    models are hindered to the coupling relationship between water and salt in soil,
    particularly for time-consuming and labor-intensive soil collection. This study
    aims to reduce the interference of soil moisture for obtaining better sample diversity
    and further improving the robustness of soil salinitu inversion models by using
    spectral technology. A total of 113 normal and 115 saline soil samples were collected
    in the Xinjiang cotton fields. These samples were further subjected to different
    levels of wetting treatment. and subsequently 467 soil samples with varing salt
    and moisture contents were obtained. Soil salt content was calibrated using the
    conductivity of soil leaching solution. Spectral data of samples was captured
    using an ASD ground object spectrometer (400-1000 nm) and a near-infrared spectrometer
    (960-1693 nm). The soil moisture was also corrected using the external parameter
    orthogonalization (EPO). Additionally, deep convolutional generative adversarial
    networks (DCGAN) with different transposed convolution stride strategies were
    designed to evaluate the sample set using Fréchet Inception Distance (FID) scores.
    Machine learning models were employed to invert the soil salinity, including partial
    least squares regression (PLSR), random forest (RF), and one-dimensional convolutional
    neural network (1D-CNN) models using VGG (VNet), EfficientNet (ENet), and ResNet
    (RNet) architectures. The results demonstrated that the EPO can effectively reduce
    the interference of moisture on the salinity, indicating the better prediction
    performance of different models. RNet out performed PLSR, RF, VNet, Enet, RNet,
    and exhibited the best performance to predict the soil salinity in cotton fields.
    The lightweight residual neural network without attention mechanism was more suitable
    for one-dimensional hyperspectral data. There was an increase in the convolution
    stride and kernel length of the deep convolutional adversarial generative network.
    The better samples were obtained for the hyperspectral data with long sequences.
    The superior FID scores were achieved in the generated augmented sample set using
    Generator B (designed with the larger convolution stride and kernel size), compared
    with the rest. Specifically, the FID scores were reduced by 7.9% and 13.4%, respectively,
    compared with GA and GC. The weight distribution of attention was optimized after
    expanding the training set by DCGAN. The stability and accuracy of the model were
    further enhanced to predict the soil salinity under certain constraints on training
    samples. The EPO-DCGAN(GB)-RNet (called EPO-DCGAN-RNet) model was achieved in
    the superior RMSEP and R2 values of 136.472 μS/cm and 0.910, respectively, on
    the validation set, compared with the EPO-SG-RNet (using SG filtering denoising)
    and EPO-RNet (without sample augmentation). Furthermore, 1D-CNN with Grad CAM
    was employed to identify the characteristic bands of soil conductivity in the
    soil leaching solution of cotton field. In summary, an accurate inversion model
    EPO-DCGAN-RNet was constructed for inversing soil salinity in the cotton fields
    using spectral technology. Water correction and sample augmentation were incorporated
    for the soil salt composition. The improved model has the promising potential
    to the salt-tolerant cotton varieties and irrigation strategies using slightly
    salty water in cotton fields. Key words:soils;salinity;spectroscopy;moisture correction;sample

  description: The construction of contour levees for rice irrigation represents a
    major landscape management activity with impacts on irrigation water use efficiency,
    crop management decisions, and food production. However, levee distribution information
    traditionally relies on local field surveys because remote sensing approaches
    are complicated by irregular spacing, shape, and landscape variability within
    the field. In this paper the authors develop a deep learning approach capable
    of identifying rice fields with contour style levee irrigation practices from
    open-source aerial imagery. To generate a levee-identification scheme, a hybrid
    ResNet/Unet model is built from the commonly known Residual Network (ResNet) architecture
    for multi-layer deep learning strategies. The model takes a 320 × 320 RGB aerial
    landscape image from the US National Agricultural Imagery Program as input along
    with label data to then generate a probability map of the distribution of farm
    fields that use contour levees within the image. In performing this task, the
    model generates a 0.991 receiver operating characteristic curve score. The model
    continues to perform well under the introduction of clouds, data augmentation,
    or minor reductions in spatial resolution. Throughout these tests, the model performed
    within 0.2 of its original score, except for when the image quality was reduced
    to 60 m wherein the model score dropped to 0.691. Via these tests the model demonstrates
    potential to function well given different spatial extents or potential satellite
    remote sensing with moderate (10 m) resolutions. This model provides a proof-of-concept
    for the use of aerial imagery and a deep learning strategy for irrigation-type

  explanation: A convolutional neural network (ResNet/U-Net) was used to examine and
    classify the specific levee patterns in aerial landscape images, first converting
    images from RGB to grayscale then using image subsetting to create 25 tiles for
    computational efficiency. The model trains on sample images to accurately discern
    patterns in the converted grayscale images and then classifies the imagery, using
    a threshold value to determine whether a field contains a contour levee patch
    from the probability map. Training/testing splits and confidence thresholds for
    binary mapping were determined to optimize the model. The model was tested for
    sensitivities to scaled resolution, simulated cloud cover, and gaussian static
    noise to assess its portability and robustness. To test the spatial transferability
    of the model, it was applied to imagery from a different location and the success
    of this application was evaluated using different image metrics. Overall, the
    model performs well with sensitivities primarily to reductions in resolution less
    than a tenth of the native resolution, which calls into question what characteristic
    of the labeled fields the model uses to make its prediction, perhaps heavily weighting
    the curvature and overall pattern of the field more than the thickness of the
    individual levees.
  extract_1: We next move toward model portability, where the developed method can
    be adapted to data acquired from other platforms, with variations in greeness,
    spatial resolution, and image contamination. Hence, our second objective is to
    test the model’s effectiveness in different image quality scenarios and scalability
    to be applied at different geographical locations.
  extract_2: These scenarios include coarsened imagery resolution or the introduction
    of various forms of noise to the image.

    and content Highlights • Contour levee identification method using aerial images
    yields ROC score of 0.991. • A ResNet/UNet hybrid provides ample performance for
    remote sensing applications. • The method is insensitive to simulated cloud cover
    up to 40% opacity. • Performance degrades with a decrease in resolution from 1
    m to less than 10 m. • The introduction of dense static noise could present a
    challenge for the model. Abstract The construction of contour levees for rice
    irrigation represents a major landscape management activity with impacts on irrigation
    water use efficiency, crop management decisions, and food production. However,
    levee distribution information traditionally relies on local field surveys because
    remote sensing approaches are complicated by irregular spacing, shape, and landscape
    variability within the field. In this paper the authors develop a deep learning
    approach capable of identifying rice fields with contour style levee irrigation
    practices from open-source aerial imagery. To generate a levee-identification
    scheme, a hybrid ResNet/Unet model is built from the commonly known Residual Network
    (ResNet) architecture for multi-layer deep learning strategies. The model takes
    a 320 × 320 RGB aerial landscape image from the US National Agricultural Imagery
    Program as input along with label data to then generate a probability map of the
    distribution of farm fields that use contour levees within the image. In performing
    this task, the model generates a 0.991 receiver operating characteristic curve
    score. The model continues to perform well under the introduction of clouds, data
    augmentation, or minor reductions in spatial resolution. Throughout these tests,
    the model performed within 0.2 of its original score, except for when the image
    quality was reduced to 60 m wherein the model score dropped to 0.691. Via these
    tests the model demonstrates potential to function well given different spatial
    extents or potential satellite remote sensing with moderate (10 m) resolutions.
    This model provides a proof-of-concept for the use of aerial imagery and a deep
    learning strategy for irrigation-type mapping practices. Previous article in issue

    Agriculture accounts for 70% of freshwater withdrawal globally; therefore it is
    paramount to minimize the amount of freshwater used while maximizing crop yield
    (Campbell et al., 2017). However, each crop requires different growing conditions
    in terms of soil composition, climate, and water availability. For example, as
    one of the major staple foods that supply 20% of the calories consumed globally
    (Kubo and Purevdorj, 2004), rice requires up to 2–3 times as much water as other
    cereal crops like wheat and maize (Bouman and Tuong, 2001). This high water use
    is associated with widespread anaerobic cultivation practices as a weed control
    mechanism and driver of greenhouse gas emissions. Between 24% and 30% of global
    freshwater resources are used to irrigate rice (Bouman et al., 2007). Thus, many
    precision irrigation and conservation efforts aim to reduce the consumptive water
    requirements of rice production while limiting the potential for yield loss. As
    there are only rare instances where the field topography will allow for standing
    water for rice production, farmers must use other means to prevent water from
    draining off the field. In the United States with larger field sizes and a higher
    degree of mechanization, farmers typically implement various forms of levee systems
    which essentially act as small dams that hold water in each section of the field.
    The most common levee system consists of generally curved contour levees that
    follow the topographical elevation lines of the field to ensure equal elevation
    within each section. This system accounts for 47.9% of rice acreage in Arkansas—the
    largest rice growing state in the U.S. (Norman and Moldenhauer, 2019). Second,
    precision land grading on some fields allows the straight levee system with parallel
    levees perpendicular to the consistent slope (0.1–0.5%). The third system is known
    as “Zero-grade”, whereby precise leveling eliminates the need for levees entirely.
    The Zero-grade system enables faster water distribution and a constant flood depth
    across the field and can lead to water savings of 40% compared to contour or straight
    levees (Henry et al., 2016). Fourth, and less common in rice production, some
    farmers forgo levee systems and use a pivot sprinkler to deliver the precise amount
    of needed water (Vories et al., 2013). Finally, furrow irrigation uses surface
    irrigation through small furrow ditches without levee use, and has increased to
    over 15% of irrigation practices in Arkansas (Chlapecka et al., 2021, Stevens
    et al., 2018). Each of these systems requires different levels of labor, power,
    and water, and knowledge about shifts among them over time can inform water resources
    planning and sustainability assessments (Moreno-García et al., 2021). However,
    there is not currently a viable system for efficient, widespread categorization
    of these fields. Examining the distribution and prevalence of these systems provides
    a baseline dataset to guide improved efficiency in water use, e.g., by the implementation
    of multiple inlet rice irrigation (Shew et al., 2021), furrow irrigation (Chlapecka
    et al., 2021), alternate wetting and drying (Atwill et al., 2020, Carrijo et al.,
    2017), or modeling the effects of these approaches on water use (Carroll et al.,
    2020). Historically, the primary method of identification was the use of surveys
    by county or extension offices relying on owner-reporting of land use, or via
    ground-truthing with windshield surveys (Smith et al., 2007). For any large spatial
    extent where laborious hand-labeling is inefficient, remote sensing offers a viable
    solution to detect large-scale land cover and land use, as well as their changes,
    in an efficient manner (Weiss et al., 2020). However, traditional pixel-based
    methods have difficulty addressing this classification, because most irrigation
    infrastructure or equipment can only be holistically seen from a landscape view.
    Additional difficulties lie in the complex visual characteristics of various irrigation
    types regarding their geometry (e.g., field size, levee width and length, and
    levee curvedness), photometry, and texture. A typical contour-levee rice field
    usually only has 3 to 10% of the land in levees that are 36 to 40 in wide (Massey,
    2023). Applying deep learning approaches to high-resolution images has provided
    an opportunity to classify rice irrigation strategies through image segmentation
    and feature extraction (Liang et al., 2021, Meyarian et al., 2022). Thus, the
    objective of this study is to develop a deep learning-based method to classify
    irrigation practices using high-resolution aerial imagery. We next move toward
    model portability, where the developed method can be adapted to data acquired
    from other platforms, with variations in greeness, spatial resolution, and image
    contamination. Hence, our second objective is to test the model’s effectiveness
    in different image quality scenarios and scalability to be applied at different
    geographical locations. These scenarios include coarsened imagery resolution or
    the introduction of various forms of noise to the image. 2. Method The research
    workflow includes phases of image annotation, pre-processing, deep learning classification,
    hyperparameter tuning, and scalability testing (Fig. 1). First, our annotators
    labeled the imagery according to the presence of fields using contour levee irrigation.
    These images are then converted to grayscale and divided with their respective
    labels according to a 5 × 5 grid composed of . After dividing the images into
    training and testing sets, we began training the model, adjusting the hyperparameters
    as needed. Once the final model was developed, we stress-tested it according to
    three criteria: resolution reduction, cloud noise addition, and gaussian noise
    addition. Download : Download high-res image (728KB) Download : Download full-size

    levee rice field from B. Moreno-García in Lonoke County, Arkansas, 12 May 2019.
    2.1. Study area We chose Lonoke County in Arkansas, where rice is the dominant
    agricultural crop type and the region has diverse levee systems, to train the
    model and assess its scalability by testing the model in distinct physio-geographical
    areas (Fig. 2). Lonoke County is located in central Arkansas, on the west side
    of the Lower Mississippi Alluvial Plain’s Grand Prairie, 32.5% of its harvested
    agricultural land is planted in rice (USDA-NASS, 2021). The region has intense
    water demands for crop production, declining groundwater table levels, and the
    increasing stress of climate change which collectively has amplified needs for
    irrigation strategies and conservation management approaches. With inter-annual
    and inter-region variability, rice is usually planted in late March to mid-May
    and harvested in mid-August to mid-October. At the state level in 2015, only 21%
    of rice acreage will continue growing rice in the following year and the majority
    will be rotated into soybeans (72%). The remaining small percentage (7%) follows
    other crops such as corn, grain sorghum, cotton, wheat, oats, and fallow (Norman
    and Moldenhauer, 2016). The high rotation rate of rice presents a challenge in
    moderate resolution remote sensing mapping as the locations of ground truth points
    vary year to year. Download : Download high-res image (1MB) Download : Download

    the algorithm and Lonoke County (indicated in dark orange) for training. The zoom-in
    view of Lonoke County has the 2015 Cropland Data Layer (CDL) to show the major
    crops, along with the location of analyzed data tiles in gray. Note: One tile
    in neighboring Prairie county was also used for training and one tile was partitioned
    into the training and testing sets (denoted as Training/Testing). 2.2. Image selection
    and annotation 2.2.1. Input imagery This study utilized the freely accessible
    United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) National Agricultural Imagery Program
    (NAIP) aerial photographic imagery that was acquired between 31 July and 25 August
    2015 at 1-m spatial resolution (USDA, 2017). We consider NAIP to a be very high
    resolution imagery dataset due to its 1-m scale as defined in Fu et al. (2017).
    The NAIP program began in 2003 with a 5-year cycle and transitioned to a three-year
    cycle in 2009 with one year publication latency to acquire aerial imagery during
    the agricultural growing season in a wide range of areas in the U.S. Although
    the selected 2015 NAIP images come with four bands (red, green, blue, and near-infrared
    (NIR)), we tested the method only with the three natural color bands to reduce
    data volume. Moreover, some studies have shown only minor performance gains when
    deep learning algorithms trained on multispectral images were applied over trichromatic
    images. For instance, one landscape segmentation study found less than a 1% increase
    in the accuracy of grass identification from an image and a 3.9% increase for
    soil identification in multispectral models versus RGB models (Salamati et al.,
    2012). Conversely, a study to identify rice lodging from UAV imagery found that
    an RGB model achieved a measure of similarity that was 2% higher than its multispectral
    counterpart (Zhao et al., 2019). Several other studies found comparable results
    between multispectral and trichromatic imagery (Elihos et al., 2018, Liu et al.,
    2020). Lastly, constraining the analysis to the RGB domain increases the transferability
    of the proposed method to NAIP images acquired in years without the NIR band and
    to other RGB data sources. 2.2.2. Image annotation and sample selection Our images
    were visually annotated using multiple people who were trained to provide consistent
    annotation and deliver high accuracy of field type labeling. Here we focused on
    the identification of contour-levee fields due to their strenuous water requirements
    (annual irrigation for rice: 892 mm) that are 8% greater than the next highest
    irrigation technique, straight levees (Reba and Massey, 2020). Contour-levee irrigation
    is a conventional irrigation method where levees are typically 30–45 cm in height
    to maintain flood between levees. From an aerial view, these fields are characterized
    by distinguishable lines that seem to resemble a topographical pattern used by
    the annotators to classify irrigation type. We also used the CDL layer as supporting
    information to provide the user with the estimated distribution of crops such
    as rice and soybeans, with very high classification accuracy on the major crops
    (Lark et al., 2021). This information aids the user in the labeling process because,
    depending on the area, levee systems are nearly exclusive to rice and soybean
    production fields. Additionally, for field patches with vague or unidentifiable
    patterns, the analysts also used the CDL to assist in image interpretation - i.e.,
    by ensuring that those fields were planted in either rice or soybean. To support
    the selection and interpretation of training and validation samples, we designed
    a labeling program (Fig. 3), where the user can upload the image for display alongside
    the CDL (Boryan et al., 2011) for the corresponding spatial extent. The trained
    analyst first draws polygons following the edges of each field over the NAIP image.
    Next, the analyst is prompted to label the field’s irrigation and/or levee system.
    Fields that are difficult to identify were labeled as unknown and discarded in
    the subsequent process. To ensure the integrity of the dataset and mitigate human
    error during labeling, the interpretation is repeated multiple times using a wall-to-wall
    method, where a new analyst inspects each field across the image and labels any
    crop fields that the previous analyst may have missed. To guarantee the best interpretation,
    at least two analysts were trained together for sample selection by the project
    leader. An initial training sample selection was performed by one analyst and
    the interpretation results were passed to another analyst for cross-checking.
    Cross-checked results were submitted to the final analyst, who is the quality
    controller for final checking. To gauge the degree of agreement between our annotators,
    we implemented Cohen’s Kappa Coefficient. This statistical measure serves to measure
    the agreement between annotators for qualitative items, such as the field typings.
    Cohen’s Kappa is expressed as (1) Where Pr(a) is the probability of overall agreement
    of the annotators and Pr(e) is the probability of overall agreement if by chance
    (Vieira et al., 2010). Download : Download high-res image (876KB) Download : Download

    with the same spatial extent as the NAIP area. Colors represent different crop
    types following the legend in Fig. 2. The label corresponds as follows: c for
    contour levees, s for straight levees, z for zero grade, and u for unknown. 2.2.3.
    Image pre-processing Due to the variation in the greenness of crop fields caused
    by the differences in acquisition date, cameras, flight height, and weather conditions,
    we used grayscale images in classification. Grayscale images can decrease the
    algorithm’s sensitivity to color changes between images, as well as any color-associated
    errors that occurred during capture. Additionally, the grayscale image emphasizes
    the shapes and patterns present within the fields more than colors, which is beneficial
    in distinguishing the specific levee systems. One study found nearly a 2% increase
    in accuracy with grayscale images over RGB images in identifying colorectal polyps
    with a CNN (Hsu et al., 2021). Similarly, a facial recognition study found that
    RGB and grayscale images had equivalent rates of recognition (Torres et al., 1999).
    To convert images from RGB to grayscale, we used a formula proposed in Pascale
    (2003), (2) Furthermore, we subset the raw 5000 × 5000 images into a 5 × 5 grid
    creating 25 1000 × 1000 subimages for computational efficiency. These images were
    then downsampled to 320 × 320 using the skip count method with a factor of 3,
    which extracted every 3rd pixel value and discarded the rest. 2.2.4. Training/test
    sample split The quality of training and test samples is paramount to the model’s
    success. In this study, training samples were selected to comprise as much diversity
    of land use types in as few images as possible to reduce model training time and
    time spent on manual sample annotation. Test samples are also diverse when in
    the season the images were taken, contributing to a robust classification evaluation.
    The Lonoke county images have the widest image capture interval with dates ranging
    from 13 July to 26 August, which in this region generally is after canopy closure
    and prior to harvest. When training deep learning models, providing the appropriate
    balance between the size of the training and testing sets is crucial to avoiding
    over- and underfitting. Here, overfitting with an overly complex model could occur
    by detecting fields during only a particular growth phase or season and can be
    detected through very high accuracy for the training and/or validation sets with
    low accuracies for the testing set (Hawkins, 2004). Conversely, underfitting could
    manifest as the model predicting every field as having contour levees simply because
    of the similarity in color. Despite its importance, there is little consensus
    as to the proper split for the data (Joseph, 2022). Studies have suggested that
    anywhere from 30% (Nguyen et al., 2021) to nearly 100% of the data should be for
    training (Dubbs, 2021). Thus, to optimize the trade off between model performance,
    training time, and avoiding overfitting, we trained the model 10 times for each
    10% increment of the training fraction ranging from 10% to 80% (Supplemental Fig.
    3). Through this process, we identified the 60/40 training/testing split as the
    most optimal. As shown in Fig. 2, whole tile representations were assigned to
    either training or testing, with the exception of one tile in which 15 of its
    subtiles were assigned to training and 10 were assigned to testing. 2.3. Network
    architecture 2.3.1. Model selection To select an appropriate deep learning architecture
    design, we performed an initial comparison between the VGG and ResNet network
    designs, both of which come with the Tensorflow-Keras installation (Abadi et al.,
    2016), a common deep learning framework. The main difference between these models
    is the number of weighted neural layers, which are 16 and 50 for VGG and ResNet,
    respectively. The appropriate number of layers depends on the complexity of the
    problem, which is not known a priori. Neither of these models classify on a per-pixel
    basis, but rather assign a label to the entire input sub-image. To effectively
    identify the label of each image object, we created UNet hybrid architectures
    that utilize native encoders from ResNet and VGG coupled with custom decoders
    similar to those in UNet. UNet was first introduced in Ronneberger et al. (2015)
    and is named for its architecture’s shape. The model down-samples the input (the
    downslope of the “u”) to extract the feature maps then up-samples the input from
    previous layers and applies the feature maps (the upslope of the “u”). The upsampling
    phase of the architecture allows it to classify on a per-pixel basis. Thus, these
    hybrids preserve the portion of the VGG and ResNet models responsible for their
    high performance while also extending them with UNet decoders that allow for pixel-based
    classification. To compare the VGG/Unet and ResNet/Unet hybrids, we trained them
    using a custom loss function which sums (1) the intersection-over-union (IoU)
    loss, that essentially measures the similarity between the labeled and predicted
    bounding boxes, and (2) the binary cross-entropy functions that are described
    in more detail in the next section. Preliminary results showed that the ResNet/Unet
    model consistently surpassed the VGG/Unet model throughout the training epochs,
    or iterations, by converging at 0.06 in 21 epochs versus 0.33 in 55 epochs (Supplemental
    Fig. 2). The ResNet architecture was first introduced in an effort to address
    the accuracy degradation that many deep models face. Essentially, as the depth
    (or number of layers) increases, the accuracy will become stagnant and then quickly
    decrease. To combat this problem, ResNet uses identity mapping, wherein each block
    or grouping of layers uses both the raw input and output of the previous block.
    This redundancy provides the retention of useful information while also preventing
    the over-abstraction of the data. Overall, ResNet has outperformed many models
    including Fitnet and Highway with more than a 1% reduction in error (He et al.,
    2016). Our hybrid ResNet/Unet (Fig. 4) uses 7 specific types of layers from the
    tensorflow library (Abadi et al., 2016): Zero-padding, 2-dimensional convolution,
    batch normalization, addition, concatenate, max pooling, and convolutional transpose.
    Zero padding appends zeros to the top, bottom, left, and right of the image, effectively
    centering it in a larger array. Next, the 2-dimensional convolution layer provides
    the functionality for the model to extract feature maps. Third, the batch normalization
    layer standardizes the input to maintain a mean close to zero and a standard deviation
    close to one (Ioffe and Szegedy, 2015). Fourth, the addition layer adds two arrays
    of the same shape to return an array of the same shape as the inputs. Next, the
    concatenate layer also takes two arrays as inputs and appends one input to the
    other along a specified axis. Next, the max pooling layer effectively downsamples
    its input by extracting the maximum value of a moving window. Lastly, the convolutional
    transpose, also known as deconvolution, works in the opposite direction as the
    regular convolutional layer. Thus, the layer essentially applies the feature maps
    that the convolutional layers had previously extracted. Download : Download high-res

    the output, a probability map classifying different segments of the grayscale
    input image, yellow for contour field and purple for background. 2.3.2. Model
    tuning The ResNet/Unet model hyperparameters were set as follows. First, the learning
    rate that controls how much the weights of the network are updated within each
    training iteration is set to 0.0005. Second, the number of these training iterations,
    known as epochs, acts as the maximum number of times that the weights can be updated,
    and is set to 100. Third, the batch size, referring to how many samples of the
    training set will be used within that epoch, was set to 5 images. Fourth, we established
    gradient accumulation into an exponentially weighted average to guide model learning
    using RMSProp (Tieleman et al., 2012, Zaheer and Shaziya, 2019), which is an optimizer
    protocol that was found to achieve the highest validation accuracy with the VGG-16
    model on a common image classification dataset (Li et al., 2021). Additionally,
    several self-tuning callbacks were used to dynamically augment the training process.
    First, we implemented early stopping, which cuts the training process short if
    the model stops improving for more than two epochs. Second, through the “reduce”
    callback we were able to lower the learning rate during a learning plateau, which
    prevents the model from overshooting the minimum loss. 2.3.3. Determining the
    optimal threshold for binary mapping To determine whether a field contains a contour
    levee patch from the probability map, we establish a threshold value to convert
    the output into a binary map. The probability value of each pixel will be adjusted
    to either 1, should its probability be higher than the threshold, or 0 in the
    case that its probability is lower. For example, with a threshold value of 0.6,
    all pixels with values above 0.6 were adjusted to 1 and all others were adjusted
    to 0. By iterating over the “binary metrics” (Accuracy, F1, IoU, and BER, discussed
    in a later section) for varying thresholds, we were able to identify the value
    that yields the greatest performance. 2.4. Model evaluation and accuracy assessment
    2.4.1. Probabilistic evaluation We evaluated the ResNet/Unet model’s performance
    based on our loss function consisting of the IoU, also known as the Jaccard index
    (van Beers and Marco A. Wiering, 2019) and the Binary Cross Entropy function.
    The IoU is a widely used metric that shows the model’s object detection by returning
    the similarities between the ground truth bounding box and the bounding box of
    the prediction. Binary Cross Entropy, also known as the Log loss, takes the negative
    log of the prediction probabilities. If the probability is 100%, the loss will
    be zero. As the probability decreases, the loss will increase thus penalizing
    uncertainty. Furthermore, we examined the model’s raw output, which is the probability
    map that predicts the likelihood of each pixel belonging to a field that contains
    contour levees, against the corresponding ground truth labels. The metric employed
    is the set of Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curves (Bradley, 1997, Flach,
    2016) that compare the true positive rate (the proportion of pixels predicted
    and labeled as contour fields) and the false positive rate (the proportion of
    pixels predicted as fields but labeled as a non-contour field). By thresholding
    the model’s output as described in Section 2.3.3, we are able to convert the probability
    map into a binary map. Next, we can compare the binary predictions to their respective
    labels to calculate the true and false positive rates. This process is repeated
    for each possible value for the decision threshold (within the range of (0,1))
    leaving a set of true/false positive rate pairings that we can plot. Smaller false
    positive rates indicate more true negatives while higher true positive rates indicate
    more true positives. Thus, as the area under the receiver operating characteristic
    (AUC-ROC) curve approaches 100%, the ResNet/Unet model’s effectiveness increases
    as shown in supplemental fig. 3. A 1:1 line is also drawn to signify a random
    predictor (Mas et al., 2013). By visualizing and quantifying these metrics, a
    holistic assessment of model skill can be estimated. 2.4.2. Binary accuracy assessment
    on the classified map The binary map after thresholding was assessed using four
    metrics, separately overall accuracy, F1, IoU, and balanced error rate. Overall
    accuracy (OA) is a relatively standard accuracy metric for binary classification
    that is calculated by dividing the number of true classifications by the total
    number of classifications. The F1 score is the harmonic mean of Precision and
    Recall, which are defined as: (3) (4) Where TP indicates true positive, FP indicates
    false positive, and FN indicates false negatives (Sasaki, 2007). Precision shows
    the ratio of samples that are correctly classified as positive out of all of the
    samples labeled as positive. Recall shows the number of actual positives compared
    to the total number of labeled positives in the set. The values are further used
    to calculate the F1 score which allows us to examine the combined effects of misclassification.
    However, this metric is independent of the value of true negatives, so in our
    case, the pixels that are correctly classified as within non-contour fields will
    not be reflected in this metric. This metric is less prone to issues related to
    class imbalances than the standard overall accuracy metric, but it does not distinguish
    between false positive or false negative model errors (Japkowicz, 2006). Thus,
    in cases where the drawbacks of false positive and false negative classifications
    are not equal, this metric can be misleading. In our project, however, a false
    positive and a false negative are comparable. (5) Additionally, we calculated
    the Balanced Error Rate (BER) metric. This metric shows the average proportion
    of error between the classes, which is given by: (6) Where Np and Nn are the number
    of Field pixels and the number of non-field pixels. Because of the disproportionate
    number of field pixels per non-field pixels, the BER metric gives a less biased
    result than the standard mean accuracy. Since this metric displays the proportion
    of error, lower values indicate better model performance. 2.4.3. Comparison to
    other products We also evaluated performance by comparing our algorithm’s accuracy
    with previous studies. We first conducted a literature review in the field of
    agricultural landscape identification and summarized the accuracy values for the
    highest performed models. We then compared the mapping outcomes with two relevant
    studies. The first study took a deep network-based method IrrNet-Bi-Seg that used
    a bi-stream encoder–decoder architecture to quantify the contour-levee fields.
    By applying the IrrNet_Bi_Seg method on the same NAIP dataset, it achieved an
    average accuracy of 86.23% and 15%–17% improvement over benchmark methods (Liang
    et al., 2021). The second study is Landsat-based Irrigation Dataset (LANID-US)
    - 30 m resolution annual maps of irrigation distribution for the US centered around
    detecting irrigated fields (Xie and Lark, 2021). It used a semi-automatic training
    approach for training sample generation and ecoregion-stratified random forest
    classification using Google Earth Engine. The annual maps there achieved a mean
    Kappa value of 0.88, overall accuracy of 94%, and producer’s and user’s accuracy
    of the irrigation class of 97.3% and 90.5%, respectively, at the sub-national
    (large aquifer) level. 2.5. Scalability test The quality of remotely sensed images
    could be affected by various atmospheric conditions or the mechanical-optical
    systems, resulting in different levels of noise and obstructions being added to
    the image. Using the clear, undistorted image as our “normal” benchmark scenario,
    we conducted tests on a series of image artifacts, including: (1) Sensitivity
    to various spatial resolutions Our first sensitivity experiments consisted of
    reducing the image resolution to account for changes in sensing equipment. To
    simulate a reduction in quality of sensing equipment, we tested the ResNet/Unet
    model on reductions of resolution from 1-m to 10-m, 20-m, 30-m, and 60-m. To achieve
    this reduction, we created a duplicate image where the pixel values were averaged
    across varying window sizes following the step in Rosa et al. (2021). For example,
    to reduce the image to 10-m, we averaged consecutive windows of size 10px by 10px.
    This same method was applied for tests on 20-m, 30-m, and 60-m resolutions. (2)
    Sensitivity to various image contamination scenarios To test different degrees
    of noise via random noise augmentation to the images, we created a separate array
    which contains random samples from a normal gaussian distribution with a standard
    deviation (which can also be interpreted as the spread) of 0.3. Then, once combined
    with the image it creates a static effect. This occurs when the signal to noise
    ratio is low, which may not be common in modern equipment, but is still possible
    in older instruments (Curran and Hay, 1986). We test cloudiness simulations given
    that approximately 45% of the Earth’s land surface is covered by clouds at any
    moment (Stubenrauch et al., 2013). This effect may also be more relevant to continuous
    satellite observations (e.g., the Planet constellation, Houborg and McCabe, 2016
    ) than to aerial imagery taken deliberately on clear days. To simulate this contamination,
    a python library imgaug was used (Jung et al., 2020). We set the opacity of the
    layer to only 40% to achieve more representative conditions that can be encountered
    by a low flying plane, based on our visual assessment of likely opacity conditions
    in the resultant images. (3) Geographic scalability Download : Download high-res

    is used to compare performance across Training/Testing splits. The binary performance
    metrics are: (b) Accuracy, (c) F1, and (d) Intersection over Union (IoU). Lastly,
    we tested the ResNet/Unet model in samples from a different location, expanding
    from the singular location used in the training and testing sets. We seek to develop
    a model that applies globally, requiring that the model’s spatial transferability
    be scrutinized. Thus, we selected five images with a high degree of rice production
    from 11 different counties across Arkansas: Arkansas, Clay, Craighead, Crittenden,
    Desha, Greene, Jackson, Jefferson, Lawrence, Mississippi, and Woodruff. These
    images, referred to as the 55 testing tiles, were annotated and evaluated using
    the same annotation scheme and metrics described previously. In an effort to explain
    any variation in performance when applying the ResNet/Unet model to imagery outside
    of Lonoke we implemented three greeness metrics: excess greenness (EG), green
    chromatic coordinate (GCC) (Reid et al., 2016), and the Greenness Index (GI) (Louhaichi
    et al., 2001). These metrics are defined as: (7) (8) (9) where R, G, and B represent
    the red, green, and blue bands of the input imagery respectively. 3. Results 3.1.
    Dataset and model optimization Our final training and test dataset contains 723
    annotated polygons with 461 labeled as contour fields and the remaining 262 as
    other irrigation methods (228 as zero grade, 25 as straight levee, 0 as center
    pivot, and 9 as unknown) that will be grouped with background. Each polygon encompasses
    a crop field and the polygons averaged 20.35 ha in size with a standard deviation
    of 14.28 ha; their sizes ranged from 0.36 ha to 126.75 ha. These annotations were
    inspected by two trained annotators and received an average 0.841 Cohen Kappa
    inter-rater agreement score, which falls in the 0.81–0.99 interval of almost perfect
    agreement (Landis and Koch, 1977). After the images were subsetted, there were
    a total of four hundred 320 × 320 px images. To balance the training and testing
    sets, we calculated the averaged AUC score over 10 training sessions for varying
    training/testing splits. Because model performance reached a plateau (AUC score:
    0.957) after 40% of the data was designated for training (supplemental Fig. 1),
    we elected to use this ratio for later tests. Due to the probabilistic nature
    of the raw model output, we also defined the confidence threshold ( ) to convert
    the model’s predictions from probabilities to binary outputs. Fig. 5 shows the
    effects of three different values across three different metrics where a binary
    map is required. The difference in performance between these thresholds was within
    0.01 for all cases. Considering the 0.7 threshold yielded the highest accuracy
    and F1 regardless of training/testing split, we used this threshold for our remaining
    tests. With the 40/60 training/testing split on the Lonoke County tiles and a
    threshold value of 0.7, the ResNet/Unet model produced a 0.991 AUC, 0.548 BER,
    0.970 Accuracy, 0.924 F1 (composed of Precision of 0.945 and Recall of 0.903),
    and 0.858 IoU. 3.2. Results of scalability tests In our scalability experiments,
    we assessed the ResNet/Unet model’s feasibility given different environmental
    and technological scenarios. Overall, the model presented high sensitivity to
    resolution reduction (Fig. 6 a), but continued to perform well given some degree
    of cloud cover or a small spread of gaussian noise (Fig. 6 b). Spatial scalability
    could present a challenge for the model considering that the worst performing
    of the 55 tiles tested has received a 83.1% AUC-ROC (Min Diff Site in Fig. 6 c),
    but on average the model continues to perform well with approximately an 8% reduction
    in the average case (Avg Diff Site in Fig. 6 c). Download : Download high-res

    to different spatial resolution In testing the impact of image spatial resolution,
    we observed a quick degradation in performance after resampling to less than a
    tenth of the ResNet/Unet model’s native resolution (i.e., from 1 m to 10 m or
    coarser). Specifically, AUC changes from 99.1% in the original 1-m resolution
    to 93.8%, 80.0%, 78.5%, 69.1% in the 10-m, 20-m, 30-m, and 60-m resolutions, respectively
    (Fig. 6). Fig. 7 provides a qualitative demonstration of the resampled images

    to different atmospheric conditions Next, we tested the ResNet/Unet model’s sensitivity
    to different simulated atmospheric conditions. For both cloud contamination and
    gaussian static noise, we tested across a range of parameter values to find the
    threshold at which model performance decays. In the case of cloud cover, the maximum
    opacity of the cloud layer (denoted by ) was between 60% and 70%, receiving a
    94.3% and 95.8% AUC-ROC respectively (Fig. 6a, 8a,b,e,f). For gaussian noise,
    spread values ( ) between 0.3 and 0.4 degraded model performance to below 80%
    AUC-ROC (Fig. 6b, 8c–d,8g–h). Download : Download high-res image (540KB) Download

    When testing the model outside of the training region, the performance slightly
    decreased from Lonoke County (AUC of 99.1%) to the 55-tile set (AUC of 91.2%).
    The values for OA, F1, IoU and BER are given in Table 1 and represented in the
    brown sets in Fig. 9. We investigated performance within the 55 tiles in terms
    of imagery capture date, excess greenness (EG) and green chromatic coordinate
    (GCC), the Greenness Index, as well as the presence of straight levees, but none
    provided explanatory power over the model residuals beyond 0.9–7.7%. Examples
    of these images are provided in (Supplemental Fig. 4). Table 1. Performance metric

    products From our literature search, we selected eight papers that are most relevant
    to irrigation or agricultural landscape classification, and we summarize their
    subject area and reported accuracies in Table 2. By comparing our Lonoke County
    mapping results against IrrNet_Bi_Seg results using the same testing data. IrrNet_Bi_Seg
    yielded an AUC, overall accuracy, F1, IoU, and BER of 93.5%, 94.4%, 88.7% (a precision
    of 85.7% and recall of 91.9%), 79.7%, and 54.1% respectively. The ResNet/UNet
    and IrrNet_Bi_Seg models performed comparably with ResNet/UNet having a slight
    increase in four of the five metrics. The comparison with 30 m resolution LANID
    data demonstrates that LANID detected 85.2% of the fields our ResNet/UNet model
    detected (Xie and Lark, 2021). In other words, 14.8% of contour field pixels detected
    by our model did not show up on the LANID map. Table 2. Reported accuracy of different

    4.1. How does our model compare with other studies? This work is part of a package
    of approaches to understand rice production systems in the US mid-south, from
    rice field mapping in google earth engine with multi-year training datasets (Liang
    et al., 2019) to using machine learning techniques to identify contour levee fields
    (Liang et al., 2021), and now testing different levee-identification approaches.
    Overall our system shows preliminary success in segmenting contour levee irrigation
    fields, as evidenced through the ROC curve, overall accuracy, F1, IoU and BER
    scores, receiving 99.1%, 97.0%, 92.4%, 85.8%, and 54.8% respectively. The model
    performed on par with many of the aforementioned models in the field of agriculture
    landscape segmentation and surpassed the highest model we found with a similar
    goal of striation detection within a segmented image (Table 2). The comparison
    with LANID data helps illustrate the role of spatial resolution in classification.
    Theoretically, all of the contour-levee fields our model detects should be a subset
    of the fields LANID detected. Further investigation revealed that a large number
    of the pixels belong to a single field with very apparent contour levees (Supplemental
    Fig. 5b.) that were thus likely misclassified by LANID. Any remaining pixels fall
    on the edges of other fields and are likely mismatched due to the difference in
    resolution. Coarser resolution imagery (e.g., 30 m for LANID) will have blurrier
    edges between fields, and the field boundaries are likely to blend with the crop
    fields, which causes overestimation in the size of the actual field (Supplemental
    Fig. 5a). Thus, a field boundary detection step using higher resolution imagery
    is likely important, and could follow recent model development in this area (e.g.,
    Jong et al., 2022). Several challenges remain for model validation (Supplemental
    Fig. 4, Fig. 5, Fig. 6). Upon calculating the true positive and true negative
    scores of the Lonoke testing set, we can see that the model accurately discerns
    what is labeled as background, correctly classifying background 98.6% of the time,
    but it is slightly weaker in classifying contour fields (90.3%). There are a few
    scenarios that could cause this weaker detection rate, some of which are demonstrated
    in Supplemental Fig. 6. First, structures such as tractor paths or roads that
    may cut through the field could present as levees. Additionally, the model easily
    discerns formations such as buildings or streams as not being a field at all,
    let alone one irrigated with contour levees. However, fields using one of the
    other irrigation systems or even a field that was recently harvested and still
    has tractor tracks present would be more difficult to classify. Though our imagery
    was largely captured during times with a fully closed canopy, these field management
    effects are sometimes still visible, as discovered in the tests detailed in Section
    3.2.3. Additionally, the use of the higher resolution commercial satellites such
    as Planet could give us year-round imagery which may alleviate these issues, when
    they are available. It is also important to note that the model’s confusion may
    be a byproduct of filtering out non-contour levee fields in the training process
    (Supplemental Fig. 6). Had we preserved the other irrigation types, the more ambiguous
    areas of the image would likely have had labels, thus providing additional classes,
    such as straight levees, for the model to learn rather than relying solely on
    contour levees. Another potential cause of the weaker true positive rate of some
    of these images is the lack of positive pixels within a sub-tile. The labeling
    in 1b–5b of Supplemental Fig. 6 shows that these images contain only a small portion
    of a much larger contour field. Thus, due to the label corresponding to such a
    small area of the field, it is possible that no levees were even present in the
    image, but rather only part of the contour-leveed field. This issue can be attributed
    to the way the images were broken into a grid, and could be improved in future
    studies with a different type of labeling and image segmentation process (e.g.,
    with fraction thresholds). Upon further inspection, we noticed that the worst-performing
    images from the 55 testing tiles had less than 30% of the label occupied by contour
    labels (some example images demonstrating this impact are in Supplemental Fig.
    6). It is likely that the image subsetting function used to subset the large 5000
    × 5000 tiles into smaller sub-images skews the metric values, as the only positive
    case present in the label is a small portion of a field on the edge of the image
    in these cases (e.g., row b in Supplemental Fig. 6). We now compare the accuracy,
    F1, IoU, and BER for sets including and excluding samples with less than 30% of
    the label containing contour fields for both the Lonoke testing tiles and the
    55 tiles from across eastern Arkansas (Fig. 9). The exclusive set, meaning tiles
    with greater than 30% contour levee pixels, received 77.2%, 68.2%, 51.7%, and
    72.6% for Overall Accuracy, F1, IoU, and BER respectively (blue sets in Fig. 9b).
    Contrary to its inclusive counterpart discussed in Section 4.1, the Lonoke testing
    set with at least 30% of the label containing a contour field received an Accuracy,
    F1, IoU, and BER of 93.2%, 93.0%, 86.8%, and 54.8% respectively. Thus, while not
    uniformly better (i.e., across all four metrics), we recommend setting a threshold
    value of 30% labeled for each tile to minimize edge effects in future studies.
    Alternatively, instead of breaking images into a grid, a form of sliding window
    could be implemented. This approach could alleviate edge cases by ensuring that
    a more complete image of the field will also be seen by the model. Additionally,
    this approach would eliminate the risk that a small but complete contour levee
    field that occupies less than 30% of the pixels in a subtile could be discarded.
    A potential candidate for comparison with our study is the shifted windows Transformer
    (Swin) that brings a hierarchical to image processing (Liu et al., 2021). This
    architecture’s hierarchical approach builds on existing transformer models, which
    rely on fixed-sized patches of a given image, by dividing the image into non-overlapping
    patches of varying sizes. The model then refines its understanding of the input
    image at varying scales: smaller patches at the lower hierarchical levels and
    larger ones at the higher levels. This process is quite different than how the
    ResNet portion of our model convolves overlapping patches of an image. Although
    it is not clear whether CNN or transformer-based neural networks are more suited
    for a given task, there have been several studies leveraging Swin/UNet architectures
    for remote sensing applications in recent years. Similar to our use of ResNet
    for the extraction of feature maps, these studies use the Swin transformer for
    the same purpose. For instance, two recent studies proposed Swin/Unet hybrid architectures
    (He et al., 2022, Gao et al., 2021) to evaluate different datasets: the Vaihingen
    dataset and the Potsdam dataset (Chen et al., 2014b). The first contains 33 aerial
    images of varying sizes with near-infrared, red, and green bands. The images are
    labeled according to many different object classes such as buildings, roads, and
    trees. The second dataset contains 38 images of uniform size with red, green,
    and blue color bands. This dataset was also labeled according to many urban development-related
    classes such as buildings and roads. For the Vaihingen dataset, He et al. (2022)
    found mean IoU and mean F1 scores of 67.32% and 79.94% while Gao et al. (2021)
    achieved 66.66% and 78.67% for the same metrics. With respect to the Potsdam dataset,
    He et al. (2022) achieved 75.97% mean IoU and 86.13% mean F1 scores whereas Gao
    et al. (2021) yielded 71.46% and 82.08%. Although these values are slightly lower
    than what we found in this study, given the change in subject area from urban
    development to crop field mapping, the Swin transformer could provide valuable
    insight into the most applicable architectures for mapping irrigation patterns.

    sub-tile model development testing set from Lonoke County and (b) the 1375 sub-tile
    scalability test set drawn from the 55 testing tiles across the state. Performance
    metrics are shown to compare a case with a subset of contour-dense tiles (i.e.,
    at least 30% of the image label contains a contour field) vs. the full set of
    testing tiles. The contour-dense set (i.e., “ 30%”) contains 33 images in plot
    a and 258 in plot b, and its metrics typically have a smaller range and smoother
    distribution compared to the inclusive set (“All”), thus insinuating a higher
    consistency amongst its subtiles. In the violin plots, the white dot represents
    the median of the samples, the thick portion of the line represents the interquartile
    range, and the thin portion represents the 1.5× interquartile range. The kernel

    What drives model sensitivity in high-resolution mapping? The model’s capability
    is retained even with variations and noise in the data. Reductions in resolution
    and other visual disturbances created minor changes in the performance metrics;
    the greatest change was 0.203 in the AUC when the gaussian noise with a 0.4 spread
    was added to the input imagery. The model seems to maintain its ability up to
    a resolution reduction to 10 m at which the performance begins to degrade. This
    larger resolution threshold (i.e., much greater than levee thickness) calls into
    question what characteristic of the labeled fields the model uses to make its
    prediction. Perhaps it weighs the curvature and overall pattern of the field more
    heavily than the thickness of the individual levees. In practice, this finding
    implies that the ResNet/Unet model is suitable for use with Sentinel-like images
    or finer (de Moura et al., 2022), but not Landsat Pouliot et al. (2019) or MODIS
    (Zhang et al., 2021). These outcomes are consistent with a recent machine learning
    approach to rice field identification and mapping in Pakistan that demonstrates
    at least an 8% F1-score improvement when using Sentinel-2 compared to Landsat
    and MODIS (Waleed et al., 2022). The model is robust against different levels
    of simulated clouds but handles differences in imaging systems better than environmental
    differences. The introduction of cloud cover, a likely scenario in practice, yielded
    results comparable to that of a 25% reduction in image resolution. Static noise,
    however, proved to minimally affect the results, likely because the static is
    spread over the entire image rather than in one concentrated area. Thus, the model
    seems to mostly disregard the affected pixel in favor of the classification of
    the neighboring pixels. Insensitivity to cloud cover further bolsters the model’s
    suitability for high-resolution satellite imagery, as cloud cover typically presents
    a challenge with this data source (Zhang et al., 2020). However, the stronger
    sensitivity to gaussian static could present a challenge due to random noise being
    an often overlooked limitation of aerial and satellite imagery (Anikeeva and Chibunichev,
    2021). 4.3. Theoretical implications and practical applications Precision farming
    requires a mix of historical and contemporary information, including harvest estimates,
    land use history, farmland sales, and landscape modification (Finger et al., 2019).
    Thus, our model could provide value to non-profit, public sector, or commercial
    actors who aid farmers in making informed decisions when dealing with critical
    natural resources. This identification could help map out and prioritize water
    and carbon conservation programs, due to the tight interplay between irrigation
    and the water and carbon cycles in these landscapes (Runkle et al., 2019, Moreno-García
    et al., 2021, Henry et al., 2016). Ongoing identification work can help monitor
    the success of programs that seek to induce practice changes or to aid in new
    program development by identifying regions slower to implement conservation land
    grading methods. Indeed, changing contour levee irrigation to other, more efficient
    delivery approaches such as multiple-inlet rice irrigation can improve irrigation
    efficiency and reduce water use by up to 24% (Massey et al., 2018). Improved levee
    detection could also improve hydrological models that require a clear understanding
    of water flow pathways through these agricultural environments, including estimates
    of seepage and percolation (LaHue and Linquist, 2021), flood mitigation potential
    (Chen et al., 2014a), and nitrogen runoff associated with irrigation (Ouyang et
    al., 2020, Kim et al., 2021). Better landform classification can also be useful
    in a geomorphological context, improving digital elevation models with implications
    in hydrology and erosion studies (Li et al., 2020). 4.4. Future research directions
    Since this research has primarily focused on methods development, there is still
    work to be done to further assess the scalability of the model. First, we need
    to examine the temporal scalability. All of the data we used in this study was
    acquired in a 26 day span in 2015, thus, the model should be tested on data from
    years other than 2015. This inter-annual test would provide necessary insight
    into how the model will perform in practice. Second, though we tested the model
    with images outside of the training county within Arkansas with the 55 testing
    tiles, a complete assessment of the model’s performance outside of Arkansas would
    demonstrate the extent of the geographic scalability. A state such as California,
    which ranks second in terms of rice production behind Arkansas (Illsley, 2020),
    would provide ample data for us to test while also being geographically distinct
    from Araknsas. Third, the model’s transferability into non-native resolutions
    should also be validated. We speculate that the model would perform well on Sentinel-like
    imagery, but further testing could prove this hypothesis. Lastly, this product
    has the potential to enable whole-region classification of irrigation systems.
    Thus, we have made the project open-source to make it both accessible to the people
    who need it and to allow people to make the necessary changes to suit their specific
    means. The code is open source and available at https://github.com/dsdale/CropContourLeveeMapping
    on publication. 5. Conclusion In this study we investigated the use of a neural
    network to identify rice contour levee systems from aerial imagery. The results
    of our approach are promising, as they show that our model maintains a high level
    of performance despite added noise and reductions in image resolution. This open-source
    model lays the groundwork for a future region-wide landscape classification system.
    Our results demonstrate that we are on track to support irrigation and water resource
    management in the Midsouth USA region. Additionally, the model architecture is
    robust enough that it is moderately scalable to different environments provided
    the resolution of the imagery used is greater than 10 m. The noise addition analyses
    show that the model is moderately accepting of environmental variance such as
    cloud cover. The work enables analysis of landscape use patterns to drive models
    of agricultural productivity and sustainability in rice growing regions by providing
    a county-wide proof of concept and improving approximately 5.6% over existing
    methods. It also offers a guide for approaching any type of deep learning pattern
    identification problem, no matter the discipline. CRediT authorship contribution

    irrigation; actual crop evapotranspiration; machine learning algorithms; decision
    support systems 1. Introduction Viticulture is a vital socio-economic activity
    for Mediterranean countries, but it faces significant challenges due to climate
    change and extreme weather conditions. More severe droughts and higher temperatures
    are expected [1], leading to increased evaporative demand and reduced water availability
    for irrigation. In this context, efficient irrigation management is crucial for
    optimizing yield and berry composition in vineyards. Such a scenario brings new
    challenges to Mediterranean viticulture, as irrigation emerges as an adaptation
    strategy aimed at optimizing yield while improving ripening and berry composition
    [2,3]. Grape ripening is a critical phenological phase that greatly influences
    berry composition at harvest time. Moderate water stress during this period benefits
    grapevine water-use efficiency and grape quality [2]. Accurate quantification
    of this condition requires monitoring actual crop evapotranspiration (ETc act),
    which allows for the implementation of efficient irrigation management schemes.
    To ensure optimal plant water status, irrigation protocols must be based on accurate
    knowledge of weather, soil, and plant variables. Nevertheless, there is some debate
    among plant physiologists and micrometeorologists regarding the factors contributing
    to plant water loss through transpiration. Plant physiologists emphasize the role
    of stomata in this process [4,5,6], while micrometeorologists focus on the high
    energy required for water evaporation [7]. Several methods to estimate evapotranspiration
    (ET), incorporating various factors from soil to vegetation and based on weather
    variables, have been developed [8]. Some are derived from the Penman–Monteith
    equation, which describes the ET process considering the soil and air moisture,
    mass transfer, and the energy required for the process [7]. The Food and Agriculture
    Organization (FAO) recommends crop evapotranspiration under standard conditions
    (FAO-56 Kc-ET0) as the standard approach for defining and calculating reference
    ET (ET0). Since ET0 reflects the weather-related effects on water use by a reference
    crop [9,10], in order to be applicable to different crops, the method needs to
    scale ET0 by a crop coefficient (Kc), which accounts for the physical and physiological
    differences from the reference crop, their impact on ET0, and their variability
    during the growing season [9]. Several simplifications were incorporated into
    the Kc coefficients, including plant transpiration and soil evaporation [11].
    To avoid incorrect estimation of crop ET (ETc) in orchards and sparse crops with
    drip irrigation and large exposed soil areas, the FAO-56 Kc-ET0 method was adapted
    to separate plant and soil components of Kc, the basal crop (Kcb) and the soil
    evaporation coefficient (Ke) [9]. However, for crop species with tight stomatal
    control of water loss and regulation of leaf water potential, such as grapevine,
    literature has reported major accuracy limitations in using the FAO-56 Kc-ET0
    method [11,12,13,14,15]. These inaccuracies are mainly related to the surface
    resistance and incorrect estimation of Kcb [16,17,18]. In fact, the procedure
    for the practical estimation of the ETc act, must take into account the effective
    transpiring leaf area, and additionally include auxiliary sub-models for aerodynamics
    and surface conductance, which must be parameterized for each new measurement,
    location, and condition [15,19,20,21,22]. To overcome the limitations of the FAO-56
    Kc-ET0 method, alternative approaches, such as employing machine learning regression
    algorithms (MLA) can be considered [23,24]. Indeed, MLAs have the capacity to
    map input-dependent variables to output-independent ones by learning patterns
    from training datasets with known pairs of input-output data [25]. Previous studies
    in the literature describe the use of MLA approaches to estimate ET0, but to the
    best of our knowledge, none of them relates to farm scale calculation of the ETc
    act for grapevines [24,26,27,28,29]. This research assesses the performance of
    eight state-of-the-art supervised machine learning regression algorithms (MLA),
    using three main atmospheric variables (net radiation—Rn, wind speed—U, and vapor
    pressure deficit—VPD) and a plant variable (stomatal conductance to water vapor—gsw),
    to predict ETc act as key information for designing optimal irrigation management
    systems in vineyards. To assess the accuracy of the algorithms, ETc act estimates
    by MLA are compared to the accuracy of the ETc act computed by the FAO-56 Kc-ET0
    method, using the actual crop ET recorded by the Eddy covariance tower flux installed
    in the field as an external validation variable. The findings suggest that MLA
    models can be effective in estimating the ETc act and optimizing irrigation management
    in vineyards. These models can continuously improve and expand their knowledge
    by incorporating new data from agronomic campaigns. The application of MLA in
    arid climates can significantly benefit viticulture in Mediterranean regions.
    2. Materials and Methods 2.1. Experimental Layout The trials were carried out
    in a commercial vineyard (Herdade do Esporão) in Reguengos de Monsaraz, Alentejo
    wine region, southern Portugal (lat. 38°23′55.00″ N; long. 7°32′46.00″ W). Specifically,
    a 17-year-old commercial vineyard of the red Vitis vinifera cv Tempranillo (syn.
    Aragonez), grafted on 1103 Paulsen rootstock, was chosen for the study. The vines
    are 1.5 m within and 3.0 m between rows (2220 vines/ha), north-south oriented,
    trained to vertical shoot positioning, and spur-pruned on a bilateral Royat cordon
    system. All vines were pruned evenly, with 15–16 buds per vine. A Eutric Cambisol
    (CM) with a depth of 1.0 m and a silty-clay texture was found, with a pH ranging
    from 7.0 to 7.6, a low organic matter content, and a high content of phosphorus
    and potassium. Standard cultural practices in the region were followed, and the
    vines were irrigated weekly with drip irrigation, using 2.4 L·h−1, 1.0 m spaced
    emitters, in accordance with owners’ practices. For the study, 20 adult and healthy
    vines were randomly selected from two adjacent rows, with 10 vines per row. This
    criterion of narrow sample selection increases confidence in the coherence of
    the measurements, as it ensures an optimal data acquisition procedure under conditions
    of low temporal and spatial variability within each measurement, without compromising
    the variability observed in the field. This experimental design also allowed for
    the assessment of solar radiation effects, as both sides of the canopy (east and
    west) were studied under contrasting incident radiation. The field trial, detailed
    in Section 2.2.1, was carried out during the ripening period in 2019 (20 and 22
    July) and 2020 (24, 29 and 31 August), from 8 a.m. to 7 p.m. 2.2. Field and Reference
    Measurements 2.2.1. Field Measurements Wind speed (U) was measured with a 3D sonic
    anemometer (Gill Windmaster Pro, Gill Instruments Limited, Hampshire, UK). To
    avoid gust peaks, the wind speed was recalculated using a 300-s running average
    over the incoming wind signal [30] and corrected by applying Equation (1) to wind
    speed measured 3 m above the ground surface [9]: 𝑈= 𝑈 𝑧 . 4.87 𝑙𝑛(67.8 𝑧−5.42)
    (1) where U is the wind speed (m·s−1) measured at 2 m above the ground surface,
    Uz is the wind speed (m·s−1) measured in z m above the ground surface, and z is
    the height above the ground surface (m) at which the wind speed is measured. Air
    temperature (Tair) and relative humidity (RH) were recorded using a thermohygrometer
    (CS215-PWS Campbell Scientific, Logan, UT, USA) placed 2 m above the soil surface.
    Net radiation (Rn) was measured with a net radiometer (NR2, Delta-T Devices, Cambridge,
    UK), installed above the top of the canopy. Soil heat flux (G) was measured with
    six heat flux plates (Hukseflux HFP01, Hukseflux Thermal Sensors, Delft, The Netherlands),
    placed at 5 mm depth, one under the canopy, and the others 0.5 m apart, perpendicular
    to the vine row and covering all the inter-row. Soil heat flux data are presented
    as the average of all six measurements. Soil and meteorological sensors were connected
    to a datalogger (CR1000, Campbell Scientific, Logan, UT, USA) and data was collected
    every minute and averaged every five minutes. Plant water status was assessed
    by pre-dawn leaf water potential (ΨPD) measurements on each sampling date using
    a Scholander-type pressure chamber. Water vapor gas exchange was also monitored
    by measuring stomatal conductance to water vapor (gsw) on adult leaves from each
    side of the canopy, from 8 a.m. to 7 p.m., using a steady state porometer (LI-1600,
    LI-COR, Lincoln, NE, USA). A summary of the field measurements is shown in Table
    1. Table 1. Summary of field measurements and instrumentation. 2.2.2. Characterization
    of the Climate and Grapevine Water Status The study zone’s climate is Mediterranean,
    with hot and dry summers and mild rainy winters. Accumulated rainfall from October
    to August ranged from 341 to 466 mm in 2019 and 2020, respectively (Table 2).
    Table 2. Characterization of rainfall patterns. Accumulated rainfall during grapevine
    dormancy, from October (Oct) to December (Dec) of the previous year’s vintage
    (year (i − 1)), dormancy to flowering (January–May), and berry development to
    grape ripening (June (Jun) to August (Aug)) of the harvest year (year (i)) and
    the cumulative rainfall from October of the previous year to August. Hourly averaged
    net solar radiation above the canopy (Rn, W·m−2), soil heat flux (G, W·m−2), air
    temperature (Tair, °C), wind speed (U, m·s−1), and air vapor pressure deficit
    (VPD, kPa), during the experimental period and measured on the experimental plot,
    are shown in Figure 1. All measurements were taken under clear-sky conditions.
    Tair and VPD followed a similar daily pattern. In the afternoon, the VPD was always
    above 3 kPa and reached 4.5 to 5 kPa between 5 p.m. and 6 p.m. The wind speed,
    U, was moderate, with a maximum of 4.4 m·s−1. The vineyard row orientation and
    the apparent daily course of the sun influenced the soil heat flux. The G increased
    from the early hours of the day until 2 p.m., when it almost reached its maximum
    value, and decreased after 3 p.m. when Rn decreased. Rn, soil G, Tair, and VPD
    showed a similar diurnal pattern during all measurement periods. Figure 1. Atmospheric
    and Soil Variable Patterns on the Measurement Days. The figure illustrates the
    measurements of net solar radiation above the canopy (Rn, W·m−2), Soil heat flux
    (G, W·m−2), air temperature (Tair, °C), wind speed (U, m·s−1), and air vapor pressure
    deficit (VPD, kPa) measured on 20 and 22 August 2019 and 24, 29 and 31 July 2020
    on the experimental plot. The values represent means, and the vertical bars indicate
    the standard error of the mean plots (n = 12). Predawn leaf water potential (ΨPD)
    varied between −0.4 and −0.6 MPa, corresponding to a condition of moderate to
    severe stress in grapevine, considered adequate to produce high-standard wines
    [2,31] (Table 3). A moderate recovery in ΨPD was observed after each irrigation
    event, with an increase of more than 0.1 MPa, (e.g., on 22 August 2019, and on
    24 and 29 July 2020). Table 3. Predawn leaf water potential (ΨPD) of grapevines
    on the measurement days. The table displays measurements of predawn leaf water
    potential (ΨPD) of grapevines on specific measurement days. Measurements were
    conducted on 20 August (before irrigation) and 22 August 2019 (after irrigation)
    at 4–5 a.m., as well as on the 24 July (after irrigation), 29 July 29 (before
    irrigation), and 31 July 2020 (after irrigation). The data is presented as the
    mean (Avg) and standard error of the mean (SE) of five replicates per day. 2.2.3.
    Reference Actual Crop Evapotranspiration Measurements An EC system installed on
    the experimental plot was used to record actual crop evapotranspiration (ETc act
    meas) simultaneously with U. A part of the collected data was used as a target
    variable in the model training phase and a part as an external validation dataset.
    The EC system consisted of a fast response, 0.1 Hz, open path CO2/H2O analyzer
    (LI-6500 DS, LI-COR Inc., Lincoln, NE, USA) and a 3D sonic anemometer (Gill Windmaster
    Pro, Gill Instruments Limited, Hampshire, UK) connected to a Smartflux 3 system
    (LI-COR Inc., Lincoln, NE, USA). The sonic anemometer and the open path CO2/H2O
    analyzer were installed at a height of 3.0 m above the ground surface, over the
    top of the canopy. A fetch of at least 300 m, facing the prevailing north winds
    and covering the experimental field ensured that all fluxes within the area of
    interest were measured. The quality of the recorded data was tested and analyzed
    with the EddyPro software v7.0.6 (LI-COR Inc., Lincoln, NE, USA). The measurements
    enabled us to record the registered actual evapotranspiration (ETc act meas) at
    a high temporal resolution, every 1/10 s. More than 90% of the daily data flux
    of the dataset analyzed here had an energy balance closure greater than 0.95.
    Consequently, the uncertainty of the measured ETc act meas values was less than
    5%, which corresponded to an ETc act meas measurement uncertainty of less than
    0.002 mm h−1 on the hourly flux determination of 90% of the data. Despite the
    significant differences between the ETc act meas recorded before and after irrigation
    days, similar patterns were found in the ETc act meas recorded before irrigation
    and in the ETc act meas recorded after irrigation (Figure 2). Irrespective of
    the irrigation difference, the ETc act meas increased exponentially from the early
    morning hours, reaching its peak between 11 a.m. and 12 p.m. In 2020, when the
    grapevines were less stressed after irrigation (Table 3), the maximum ETc act
    meas reading was recorded at 1 p.m., when the air VPD reached 3.5 MPa, and decreased
    towards the end of the day, regardless of the energy available for water evaporation.
    In both years, prior to irrigation, and under more severe water stress conditions,
    the maximum ETc act meas reading was registered at 11 a.m. and was maintained
    at a similar level for an extended period, only decreasing after 5 p.m. to 6 p.m.
    (Figure 2). These results are consistent with the strong regulation of gsw on
    grapevine transpiration [4], and the large contribution of plant transpiration
    compared to soil evaporation to total evapotranspiration in vineyards. While before
    irrigation, ETc act meas ranged from 0.06 to less than 0.2 mm·h−1, the recorded
    ETc act meas after irrigation was on average 1.3 to 1.4 times higher, thus suggesting
    larger stomata opening and greater water loss through transpiration. Figure 2.
    Actual crop evapotranspiration (ETc act meas) measured in the experimental plot.
    The figure displays the actual crop evapotranspiration (ETc act meas) measured
    in the experimental plot using an Eddy covariance flux tower. Measurements were
    taken on the 20 and 22 August 2019, before and after irrigation, respectively,
    as well as on the 24 July, after irrigation, 29 July, before irrigation, and after
    irrigation on 31 July 2020. The values represent means, and the vertical bars
    indicate the standard error of the mean plots. 2.3. Developed Methodology 2.3.1.
    Data Processing and Analysis In order to estimate actual crop evapotranspiration,
    under non-standard conditions (ETc act est), from weather and plant variables
    using machine learning techniques, the initial field measurement data underwent
    a transformation to create a suitable data structure for processing and analysis.
    The original data were structured into a nine-dimensional vector composed of the
    seven measured variables (gsw, ETc act meas, Tair, RH, U, Rn, and G) and two derived
    variables (Rn—G and VPD), with 600 measurements per variable. VPD was calculated
    using Tair and RH as described in Equations (2)–(5) (Table 1). To train the machine
    learning models (MLA) to estimate actual crop evapotranspiration, ETc act est,
    the ETc act meas recorded in the experimental plot was used as the label/dependent
    variable (target), and the variables gsw, VPD, Rn, G, U, and Tair were initially
    considered as predictors, subject to the results of the pre-processing analysis.
    The predictor variables were selected from the crop and meteorological variables
    with the greatest influence on ETc act according to the literature. Data pre-processing
    included outlier analysis, variable correlation analysis, and data structuring
    into an internal training and testing set, and an external validation dataset.
    Outliers were identified by the interquartile range (IQR) method with a cut-off
    of 1.5 × IQR. Scores that fell below 1.5 × IQR − Q1 (the 1st or 25% quartile)
    or above 1.5 × IQR + Q3 (the 3rd or 75% quartile) were considered as outliers
    and removed from the dataset. To avoid multicollinearity of the model, the correlation
    of the variables was analyzed by a Pearson product-moment correlation test. Variables
    not correlating below −0.6 or above a threshold of 0.6 were selected as good candidates
    for ETc act predictors. Consequently, the variable Tair was removed based on this
    criterion. After removing the outliers and discarding the variable, the data were
    randomly split into three datasets: A training and testing dataset containing
    40% of the 2019 and 2020 data, and two validation datasets, one containing the
    remaining 2019 data, and the other containing the remaining 2020 data (Figure
    3). The three datasets were configured to maintain similar data patterns (Table
    4). Figure 3. Data structure. The original data was divided into three final datasets:
    a training and testing dataset containing 40% of all data from the years 2019
    and 2020, and two external validation datasets containing the remaining data from
    the years 2019 and 2020. Table 4. Model predictors and characterization of response
    variables. The table provides variable characterization for each pooled dataset
    (training, testing, and validation). It includes stomatal conductance to water
    vapor (gsw), net radiation above the canopy minus soil heat flux (Rn − G), wind
    speed (U), air vapor pressure deficit above the canopy (VPD), and crop evapotranspiration
    measured by the Eddy covariance method under non-standard conditions (ETc act
    meas). The data are characterized by the total number of cases (N), the mean of
    the variable (Mean), the minimum (Min) and maximum (Max) values, the standard
    deviation (SD), and the respective coefficient of variation (CV, %). 2.3.2. Modeling
    Vineyard Actual Evapotranspiration under Non-Standard Conditions The pooled training
    dataset (Figure 3) was used to train and fit a set of supervised machine learning
    regression models to predict ETc act pred, employing a five-fold cross-validation
    scheme to protect against overfitting. The selected model predictors, as detailed
    above, were the daily course of net radiation (Rn, W·m−2), soil heat flux (G,
    W·m−2), air vapor pressure deficit (VPD, kPa), wind speed (U, m·s−1) measured
    above the canopy, as well as the stomatal conductance to water vapor (gsw, m·s−1).
    The pooled training dataset, ETc act meas data, recorded in the field (Figure
    3), was used as the target variable. For modeling purposes, the units of gsw were
    converted to m·s−1 using the molar density of the air (mol.m−3), and Rn after
    subtracting G to determine the energy available for crop ET processes. Accordingly,
    a set of supervised machine learning models was developed, using Matlab R2021b
    (The Mathworks Inc., Natick, MA, USA), which included: (a) A non-parametric kernel-based
    probabilistic model (Gaussian process regression model—GPR), using either an exponential
    kernel function or a squared exponential kernel function; (b) A support vector
    machine (SVM) regression model using either a linear kernel function, a quadratic
    kernel function, a cubic kernel function, or a medium Gaussian kernel function;
    (c) An ensemble of regression trees (ERT), either using least-squares boosting
    regression trees learners or using bootstrap-aggregating (bagging) regression
    trees learners. 2.4. Methodology to Evaluate the Predictive Accuracy of MLA Models
    in Estimating Actual Crop Evapotranspiration To assess the predictive accuracy
    of the proposed MLA models, the actual crop evapotranspiration predicted by the
    models, ETc act pred, was compared to the ETc act meas measurements recorded in
    the field by the Eddy covariance method. To better examine the performance of
    the proposed models, we also compared the predictive accuracy of ETc act estimated
    by the FAO-56 Kc-ET0 method with the values from the same dataset of ETc act meas
    recorded in the field using the Eddy covariance method. Finally, the accuracy
    of MLA models for predicting ETc act was verified by comparison with the accuracy
    of the recommended standard method FAO-56 Kc-ET0 for estimating ETc act. 2.4.1.
    Predictive Accuracy of MLA Models to Estimate Actual Crop Evapotranspiration The
    accuracy of the MLA proposals for predicting ETc act was verified by comparing
    the fitted values of all models with the ETc act meas measures recorded in the
    field by the Eddy covariance method. The predictive accuracy of the MLA models
    was evaluated according to the method described in Section 2.4.3. 2.4.2. Predictive
    Accuracy of the FAO-56 Kc-ET0 Model to Estimate Actual Crop Evapotranspiration
    The accuracy of the predicted ETc act using the recommended standard method FAO-56
    Kc-ET0 was compared to the ETc act meas measurements recorded in the field by
    the Eddy covariance method. To predict ETc act using the FAO-56 Kc-ET0 standard
    method, ET0 was first calculated according to the method proposed by [9] using
    data from the farm’s meteorological station. A detailed description of the FAO-56
    Kc-ET0 method can be found in the work by [9]. In this study, the dual crop coefficient
    Kc approach was employed to assess crop evapotranspiration (ETc). This approach
    involves splitting Kc into two factors that separately describe the components
    soil evaporation (Ke) and grapevine transpiration (Kcb). The basal crop coefficient
    (Kcb) was estimated by the Normalized Differential Vegetation Index (NDVI) obtained
    from Sentinel 2 imagery time-series with a spatial resolution of 10 m, following
    the model presented in [32] (Equation (6)). Kcb = 1.44 × NDVI − 0.10 (6) The model
    presented in [32] was developed for a vineyard with the same cultivar and rootstock,
    and a similar climate and crop management, showing a high coefficient of determination
    (R2 = 0.96). Thus, Equation (6) was selected to estimate Kcb from the NDVI measured
    in the experimental plot. As the grapevines in the study were subjected to some
    stress, a stress coefficient (Ks) was applied to Kcb to assess ETc act according
    to the FAO-56 Kc-ET0 methodology, following Equation (7): ETc act = (Ke + Ks ×
    Kcb) × ET0 (7) The calculation of Ks was based on Equation (8), as described in
    [32]: Ks = 1.217 × e(1.444×ΨPD) (8) The predictive accuracy of the FAO-56 Kc-ET0
    standard method was evaluated according to the method described in Section 2.4.3.
    2.4.3. Comparative Analysis of the Predictive Accuracy of MLA Models and the FAO-56
    Kc-ET0 Method for Estimating Actual Crop Evapotranspiration The models’ predictive
    accuracy was assessed for the pairs model—dataset by examining the coefficient
    of determination (R2) of the trained models and comparing the goodness of fit
    measures of the simulated vs. observed ETc act. For this purpose, we used the
    Root-Mean-Square-Error (RMSE), which is defined as follows: 𝑅𝑀𝑆𝐸= ∑ 𝑛 𝑖=1 ( 𝑦
    ̂ 𝑖 − 𝑦 𝑖 ) 2 𝑛 − − − − − − − − − − − − − √ (9) where ŷi and yi are the predicted
    and measured actual crop ET, respectively, for the i-th segment of the dataset
    and n is the number of ETc act measurements used in each dataset. To avoid the
    differences in ETc act between different datasets, the relative error (|E|) was
    calculated and expressed as a percentage, from the expression: |E|= | ∑ 𝑛 𝑖=1
    ( 𝑦 ̂ 𝑖 − 𝑦 𝑖 )| ∑ 𝑛 𝑖=1 𝑦 𝑖 ×100 (10) 3. Results and Discussion 3.1. Characterization
    and Correlations of Actual Crop Evapotranspiration Predictors Figure 4 shows the
    correlation between all variables trained as predictors of actual crop evapotranspiration
    (ETc act) before data was split into datasets. Since air temperature (Tair) showed
    a positive and significant correlation with air VPD (R = 0.97, p < 0.001), Tair
    was not used as a predictor of ETc act to avoid multicollinearity. All variables
    correlated positively and significantly (p < 0.001) with the target variable (ETc
    act meas). With the exception of Rn-G, the energy available for the ET process,
    which showed a correlation coefficient (R) value with ETc act meas twice that
    of the other predictors, all others correlate in a similar order of magnitude.
    None of the predictors per se explained more than 40% of the variability of the
    ETc act meas, thus suggesting that non-linear relationships between predictors
    and the ETc act meas may be involved, and/or the interaction between the variables
    are the main contributors to the observed variability. Figure 4. Correlogram Showing
    Pearson Product-Moment Correlation Coefficients. The figure displays the Pearson
    product-moment correlation coefficients between pairs of variables selected as
    predictor candidates for actual crop evapotranspiration (ETc act). The variables
    include meteorological variables such as Rn-G (the energy available for crop evapotranspiration
    processes, calculated as the net solar radiation above the canopy (Rn) minus the
    soil heat flux (G)), U (the wind speed above the canopy), VPD (the air vapor pressure
    deficit), and Tair (the air temperature). Additionally, the grapevine variable
    gsw (stomatal conductance to water vapor) and field-measured actual crop evapotranspiration
    (ETc act meas) are included in the correlation analysis. All correlation coefficients
    are significantly different from zero (p < 0.001). Correlations of similar magnitude
    are depicted with the same color, according to the color code shown below. Table
    4 shows the characterization of the datasets used for training and testing, as
    well as for external validation of the MLA approach and FAO-56 Kc-ET0 models.
    The table shows considerable variability within each variable across all datasets,
    as indicated by the coefficient of variation (CV). This variability can be attributed
    to how the different variables changed throughout the day. Despite the variability,
    the mean and the amplitude of data variability, represented by the maximum (Max)
    and minimum (Min) values, as well as the standard deviation (SD) of each variable
    (both predictor and target variables), were found to be similar between datasets
    (Table 4). 3.2. Evaluation of MLA Models in Estimating Actual Crop Evapotranspiration
    Table 5 shows the fitted supervised machine learning (MLA) models that were trained
    and tested to estimate ETc act using the variables Rn, G, U, VPD, and gsw as predictors.
    In the testing phase, all trained models achieved a high and significant coefficient
    of determination (R2), thus indicating high efficiency in predicting the ETc act.
    The poorer model was the SVM approach, using a linear kernel function, which yielded
    an R2 score of 0.746. The two ERT approaches, the SVM model, using a medium Gaussian
    kernel function, and the GPR, using an exponential kernel function, showed the
    best performance in predicting the ETc act, with R2 values between 0.910 and 0.992.
    The high and significant R2 of all MLA regression models (Table 5) indicates that
    the selected variables (gsw, Rn-G, U, and VPD) account for a very high proportion
    of the observed ETc act variability, suggesting that they are robust explanatory
    variables of the ETc act. Table 5. Fitted Machine Learning Algorithms for actual
    vineyard evapotranspiration under non-standard conditions (ETc act). The table
    presents the results of fitted Machine Learning Algorithms for actual vineyard
    evapotranspiration under non-standard conditions (ETc act) using the pooled dataset
    for training and testing. The data was obtained from the years 2019 and 2020,
    based on actual vineyard evapotranspiration measured by the Eddy covariance method
    in the field (n = 236). The values of the coefficient of determination (R2) for
    all the algorithms are significant (p < 0.001). Table 6 presents the goodness-of-fit
    measures for the MLA approaches used to estimate the ETc act using the validation
    dataset with the variables Rn, G, U, VPD, and gsw. The results of the validation
    phase were consistent with those of training and testing. Except for the SVM implementing
    a linear kernel function, the model validation process demonstrated the high accuracy
    of the remaining MLA models for predicting the ETc act. The results showed a correlation
    (R) between observed and fitted values greater than 0.880 and a maximum root mean
    square error (RMSE) of 0.032 mm·h−1, which is below the minimum ETc act value
    recorded in both years (as shown in Table 6 and Figure 5). Figure 5. Relationship
    between observed and estimated crop evapotranspiration. This figure illustrates
    the relationship between the observed crop evapotranspiration (ETc act meas, mm·h−1),
    recorded with an Eddy covariance flux tower, and the actual crop evapotranspiration
    (ETc act est, mm·h−1) estimated by different supervised machine learning algorithms.
    Each subfigure shows a specific algorithm used for estimation. (A) recorded ETc
    act meas value versus ETc act est value estimated by a GPR using an exponential

    a linear kernel function, (D) relationship estimated by an SVM algorithm with
    a quadratic kernel function, (E) relationship estimated by an SVM algorithm with
    a cubic kernel function, (F) relationship estimated by an SVM algorithm with a
    medium Gaussian kernel function, (G) relationship estimated by an Ensemble boost
    tree algorithm, and (H) relationship estimated by an Ensemble bagged tree algorithm.
    The data validation samples from 2019 are represented with circles (n = 185),
    and data from 2020 are represented with triangles (n = 174). The dotted line in
    each subfigure represents the 1:1 line, indicating perfect alignment between the
    observed and estimated values. Table 6. Statistical indicators of goodness-of-fit
    measures of the supervised machine learning regression algorithms. The table presents
    statistical indicators of goodness-of-fit measures for estimating vineyard evapotranspiration
    under non-standard conditions (ETc act) using supervised machine learning regression
    algorithms. The data validation was performed with two independent datasets: observed
    (field recorded) vineyard evapotranspiration under non-standard conditions (ETc
    act meas) and model-estimated vineyard evapotranspiration under non-standard conditions
    (ETc act est). The datasets are from the years 2019 (n = 185) and 2020 (n = 174).
    The goodness-of-fit measures included are root mean square error (RMSE) and relative
    error (|E|). The analysis of the goodness-of-fit measures of the models in Table
    6 confirmed that the MLA with a linear transformation had the poorest performance
    in estimating the ETc act. However, the MLA models tested with the year 2019 and
    2020 independent validation datasets demonstrated high accuracy potential in predicting
    the ETc act, with R2 values ranging between 0.629 (SVM using a linear kernel function,
    and the 2020 validation dataset) and 0.915 (SVM using a medium Gaussian kernel
    function, and the 2019 validation dataset). The relative error (|E|) of the predictions
    made with the 2019 validation dataset was in the [0.2, 6.3] interval, while with
    the 2020 dataset, the range was [0.7, 5.1], both expressed in percentage. Overall,
    the MLA models exhibited strong predictive capabilities for estimating ETc act,
    as evidenced by their high R2 values and relatively low errors. All algorithms
    explained more than 80% of the ETc act variability present in the validation dataset.
    The GPR using an exponential and a squared exponential kernel function, both ERT,
    using either least squares boosting or bootstrap aggregation methods and the SVM
    with a medium Gaussian kernel function, showed the best accuracy in estimating
    the ETc act. These algorithms explain between 80 and 90% of the variability of
    the ETc act measured in the field while exhibiting an RMSE in the range of 0.019
    to 0.030 mm·h−1. Excluding the SVM using a linear transformation, the MLA algorithms,
    using plant and weather variables, showed a remarkable ability to learn the inner
    relations between ETc act meas, Rn, G, U, and VPD, by predicting the actual vineyard
    ET variability with high accuracy. Similar results were obtained by other authors
    [24,26,27,33,34,35] for other crops. 3.3. Evaluation of FAO-56 Kc-ET0 Method to
    Estimate Actual Crop Evapotranspiration Figure 6 depicts the scatter plot representing
    the relationship between the observed actual crop evapotranspiration (ETc act
    meas) recorded with the Eddy covariance method and the estimated actual crop evapotranspiration
    (ETc act est) obtained through the application of the FAO 56 Kc-ET0 method (fitted
    values). The results reveal a noteworthy and statistically significant correlation
    (R = 0.858, p < 0.001) between the observed and fitted data. However, it is evident
    that the variability increases as the magnitude of the observed values rises,
    as illustrated in Figure 6. Moreover, the FAO 56 Kc-ET0 method exhibits a tendency
    to overestimate the actual crop evapotranspiration values, which is consistent
    with findings in other studies concerning olive orchards [36] and peach orchards
    [16]. Consequently, the goodness-of-fit measures indicate an RMSE of 0.059 mm·h−1,
    a value 1.3 to 2.9 times higher than the minimum ETc act recorded in the field
    using the Eddy covariance method. Furthermore, the relative error (|E| = 26.5%)
    is relatively high, indicating certain weaknesses of the FAO-56 Kc-ET0 method
    in accurately predicting ETc act in sparse vegetation crops like vineyards. This
    observation underscores the method’s limitations in simulating soil resistance
    and vine stomatal conductance under more stressful conditions, as investigated
    in this study. The observed limitations of the FAO-56 Kc-ET0 method in accurately
    estimating ETc act in vineyards are consistent with previous literature, including
    studies by [15,16,19,22,36,37]. Figure 6. Relationship between observed and estimated
    actual crop evapotranspiration. The figure illustrates the relationship between
    the observed actual crop evapotranspiration (ETc act meas) recorded using the
    Eddy covariance flux tower, and the actual crop evapotranspiration estimated (ETc
    act est) with the FAO-56 Kc-ET0 method. The coefficient of determination (R2)
    and goodness-of-fit measures from data validation with two independent datasets
    of observed vineyard evapotranspiration under non-standard conditions (ETc act
    meas) and estimated actual crop evapotranspiration (ETc act est) with FAO 56 Kc-ET0
    method from the year 2019 (n = 48, circles) and 2020 (n = 72, triangles) are presented
    in the figure. The Goodness-of-fit measures include root mean square error (RMSE)
    and relative error (|E|). The dotted line in the figure represents the 1:1 line,
    indicating perfect agreement between the observed and estimated values. 3.4. Comparison
    of the Prediction Accuracy of MLA and FAO-56 Kc-ET0 Method to Estimate Actual
    Crop Evpotranspiration With the exception of SVM implementing a linear kernel,
    all MLA proposals demonstrated superior performance in predicting ETc act compared
    to the FAO-56 Kc-ET0 method. The scatterplots depicting the relationship between
    the observed ETc act values (recorded with the EC method) and the estimated ETc
    act est values (obtained through MLA) showed a close alignment with the 1:1 line,
    indicating a good fit of all MLA models (see Figure 5). During the validation
    process, the MLA models exhibited a very high and statistically significant coefficient
    of determination (R2) between the simulated and observed values. Moreover, the
    intercept and slope of the MLA fitted values were very close to 0 and 1, respectively,
    further confirming the accuracy of the predictions. In contrast, when compared
    to the FAO-56 Kc-ET0 method, only the SVM with a linear kernel exhibited a lower
    R2 and a less satisfactory fit to the observed data. This outcome suggests that
    the SVM with a linear kernel might not be as effective as the other MLA models
    in accurately estimating ETc act under the conditions considered in this study.
    The comparison of accuracy between models, using the external validation dataset,
    clearly indicates that the MLA models outperform the FAO-56 Kc-ET0 method. The
    MLA models’ fitted values demonstrated significantly smaller errors (as measured
    by RMSE and |E|) compared to the FAO-56 Kc-ET0 method. Specifically, the scatterplots
    between the observed and the FAO-56 Kc-ET0 fitted values showed an RMSE that was
    1.65 to 1.98 times less accurate, in 2019 and 2020, respectively, when compared
    to the worst MLA proposal (SVM with a linear kernel function). Moreover, the FAO-56
    Kc-ET0 method was found to be 2.2 to 2.8 times less accurate, in 2019 and 2020,
    respectively, when compared to the best MLA models, namely the GPR with an exponential
    kernel function, and the SVM with a medium Gaussian kernel function. In terms
    of prediction capacity, all MLA models exhibited higher accuracy compared to the
    FAO-56 Kc-ET0 model. The absolute value of the error (|E|) in the MLA predictions
    was more than 6.8 times lower than the values predicted by the FAO-56 Kc-ET0 model,
    as shown in Table 7. Table 7. Comparison of prediction accuracy to estimate actual
    crop evapotranspiration recorded in the field. The table provides a comparison
    of prediction accuracy to estimate actual crop evapotranspiration recorded in
    the field using the Eddy covariance method. It includes results from the FAO-56
    Kc-ET0 and the two best machine learning algorithms: GPR (Gaussian process regression)
    using an exponential kernel function, and SVM (Support vector machine) using a
    medium Gaussian kernel function. Prediction accuracy measures include the coefficient
    of determination (R2) of the trained models, and the goodness-of-fit measures
    from the data validation process (root mean square error—RMSE and relative error—|E|).
    These findings further strengthen the superiority of MLA models in accurately
    estimating actual crop evapotranspiration compared to the traditional FAO-56 Kc-ET0
    method. The significant reduction in errors, as indicated by RMSE and |E| values,
    highlights the enhanced predictive capabilities of MLA models in this study. 4.
    Conclusions The present work demonstrates that machine learning regression algorithms,
    when provided with gsw, G, and three meteorological variables (Rn, U, and VPD),
    can accurately predict the ETc act. The five best-performing algorithms explain
    more than 89% of the measured variability in ETc act recorded in the field, with
    RMSE values below 0.03 mm·h−1. The results showcase the MLA’s capacity to estimate
    the ETc act with a simple parameterization and lower computational requirements
    compared to the traditional FAO-56 Kc-ET0 method while retaining robustness in
    calculations. Furthermore, the findings highlight the limitations of the FAO-56
    Kc-ET0 method in accurately predicting ETc act for grapevines under deficit irrigation,
    where vine stomatal significantly impacts water usage and soil surface water evaporation
    is limited. In contrast, the presented MLA models, which incorporate gsw as input
    knowledge, proved to be accurate in predicting ETc act under such conditions.
    The study shows that the MLA models are well suited for application in semi-automated
    or automated field data analysis for predicting vineyard ETc act. Their ability
    to continuously process new data in near real time, retrain the algorithm, and
    adapt to new data patterns and associations can enhance prediction accuracy and
    support more efficient irrigation practices. Additionally, the use of machine
    learning algorithms for monitoring the ETc act based on grapevine and atmospheric
    parameters can provide valuable insights for decision support systems aimed at
    optimizing vineyard irrigation management. However, further optimization is required
    concerning the amount of available data and consideration of climatic conditions.
    In conclusion, the study demonstrates the efficacy of MLA algorithms in accurately
    estimating vineyard ETc act, making them a promising approach for water management
    in grapevine cultivation. Nonetheless, future research should focus on refining
    the models with respect to data availability and varying climatic conditions.

  description: Reference evapotranspiration (ETo) is an essential variable in agricultural
    water resources management and irrigation scheduling. An accurate and reliable
    forecast of ETo facilitates effective decision-making in agriculture. Although
    numerous studies assessed various methodologies for ETo forecasting, an in-depth
    multi-dimensional analysis evaluating different aspects of these methodologies
    is missing. This study systematically evaluates the complexity, computational
    cost, data efficiency, and accuracy of ten models that have been used or could
    potentially be used for ETo forecasting. These models range from well-known statistical
    forecasting models like seasonal autoregressive integrated moving average (SARIMA)
    to state-of-the-art deep learning (DL) algorithms like temporal fusion transformer
    (TFT). This study categorizes monthly ETo time series from 107 weather stations
    across California according to their length to better understand the forecasting
    models' data efficiency. Moreover, two forecasting strategies (i.e., recursive
    and multi-input multi-output) are employed for machine learning and DL models,
    and forecasts are assessed for different multi-step horizons. Our findings show
    that statistical forecasting models like Holt-Winters' exponential smoothing perform
    almost as well as complex DL models. Unlike statistical models, DL models generally
    suffer from low data efficiency and perform well only when enough data is available.
    Importantly, although the computational costs of most DL models are higher than
    statistical methods, this is not the case for all. Considering computational cost,
    data efficiency, and forecasting accuracy, our findings point to the superiority
    of the neural basis expansion analysis for interpretable time series forecasting
    (N-BEATS) architecture for univariate ETo time series forecasting. Moreover, our
    results suggest Holt-Winters and Theta methods outperform SARIMA – the most employed
    statistical model for ETo forecasting in the literature – in accuracy and efficiency.

    AccuracyData EfficiencyComputational Cost 1. Introduction Time series forecasting
    is crucial in several domains of modern agriculture, like irrigation scheduling,
    crop modeling, and agricultural water management (Richetti et al., 2023). In addition
    to a comprehensive understanding of the present status of the system, making decisions
    usually require a reliable perception of the system''s future. In other words,
    accurate forecasts facilitate sustainable management strategies and decisions
    (Samaniego et al., 2019). Evapotranspiration (ET) is an essential variable for
    irrigation management and scheduling. ET is the sum of evaporation from the soil
    and wet vegetation surfaces and transpiration through plant leaves and plays a
    prominent role in the global hydrological cycle (Pereira et al., 1999). ET rate
    is controlled by physical and biological factors and is plant specific. However,
    reference evapotranspiration (ETo) is a pure meteorological variable that relaxes
    the plant surface''s controlling effects by assuming a hypothetical reference
    crop surface and standardized conditions (Allen et al., 1998, Diodato and Bellocchi,
    2007), which is critical for agricultural water management. There are numerous
    studies in the literature focused on ETo forecasting. Examples are Gocić et al.
    (2015) study on soft computing methods for monthly ETo forecasting, Karbasi et
    al. (2022) weekly ETo forecasting using a hybrid deep learning model, Ferreira
    and da Cunha (2020) research on using deep learning models to forecast multi-step
    ahead daily ETo, and Chia et al. (2022) work on long-term forecasting of monthly
    mean ETo using deep neural networks. Many recent research articles attest that
    ETo forecasting is a prominent case of agricultural time series forecasting (Ferreira
    and da Cunha, 2020). Moreover, a mature body of research is available in the literature
    on applying machine learning models for ETo estimation (Chia et al., 2021a, Chia
    et al., 2021b). Natural systems are associated with internal randomness and inherent
    uncertainties that challenge forecasting their future states. From simpler linear
    models to cutting-edge deep learning (DL) models, numerous forecasting methodologies
    are available in the literature (Hyndman and Athanasopoulos, 2018), and they address
    modeling uncertainties differently. Although most of these models have been employed
    to forecast agricultural and meteorological time series (Ni et al., 2020, Hunt
    et al., 2022), their performance has rarely been systematically compared. This
    study aims to fill this research gap by analyzing ten forecasting models'' complexity,
    data efficiency, and accuracy. To this end, we evaluate the models'' performance
    in the case of monthly ETo forecasting in California. Having a significant seasonality
    and negligible trend in short periods, monthly ETo is a suitable archetype of
    agrometeorological time series. Moreover, with more than one hundred standardized
    weather stations, grave water availability, and quality challenges, California
    is a suitable case study for this research (Lund et al., 2018, Ahmadi et al.,
    2022). Forecasting models evaluated in this study are either ubiquitous statistical
    forecasting methods employed in numerous studies for agrometeorological time series
    forecasting or cutting-edge DL models with promising performances over benchmark
    data sets and in data science competitions. These models are divided into three
    classes: 1) statistical models consisting of autoregressive integrated moving
    average (ARIMA), seasonal ARIMA (SARIMA), Holt-Winters'' exponential smoothing,
    and Theta method; 2) machine learning (ML) models consisting of the light gradient-boosting
    machine (LightGBM); and 3) state-of-the-art DL models including neural basis expansion
    analysis for interpretable time series forecasting (N-BEATS), long short-term
    memory (LSTM), temporal convolutional network (TCN), Transformer model, and temporal
    fusion transformer (TFT). The models'' performance is evaluated in a multi-dimensional
    framework for more in-depth investigation. For this purpose, weather stations
    are categorized based on their historical data availability, two multi-step ahead
    forecasting strategies are employed for ML and DL models, and forecasts are made
    for different forecasting horizons. Forecasting strategies used in this study
    are recursive and multi-input multi-output (MIMO) strategies. Contrary to the
    recursive strategy that forecasts one time step at each iteration, the MIMO strategy
    forecasts the entire forecasting horizon at once. The multi-dimensional analysis
    of this study goes beyond the typical comparison of performance measures in the
    literature and casts light on various aspects of agrometeorological time series
    forecasting, informing future applications. It is also worth mentioning that although
    some of the more well-known and older DL models, like LSTM, have been applied
    in agricultural and hydrological studies (Hunt et al., 2022), most of the more
    recent model structures, like N-BEATS and TFT, have had limited or no records
    of application in the hydrological and agricultural research. Implementing the
    state-of-the-art DL forecasting models, this study goes beyond analyzing the current
    trend in agricultural forecasting. It aims to introduce the advances of time series
    forecasting to the field of agrometeorology and to promote the current research
    trend in the field. Here, we hypothesize that more complex DL models (i.e., deeper
    and wider architectures) generally outperform statistical methods (Makridakis
    et al., 2022). We also hypothesize that DL models encounter challenges in accurately
    forecasting future time steps for more recently established weather stations (e.g.,
    stations with less than 15 years of data records), as more complex data-driven
    models tend to require more input data and be less data-efficient (Hassani et
    al., 2021). Additionally, we hypothesize that more complex DL models are computationally
    expensive and take longer to train. Furthermore, we hypothesize that ML and DL
    models trained with the MIMO strategy outperform models trained with the recursive
    strategy (Taieb et al., 2012). We test these hypotheses consistently across models.
    In doing so, we keep all the effective parameters (e.g., input data length) similar
    for all the models. Moreover, we analyze the potential effects of background factors
    (e.g., geographical characteristics and climatic conditions) to ensure the reliability
    of our findings. 2. Study area and dataset In our case study of California, meteorological
    drivers of ETo (i.e., inputs of the Penman-Monteith equation, which are net radiation,
    soil heat flux, air temperature, vapor pressure, and wind speed) are measured
    in standardized weather stations throughout the state. These stations are managed
    under the California irrigation management information system (CIMIS), which consists
    of over 145 automated weather stations to assist irrigators and water managers
    with planning and decision-making. CIMIS uses the Penman-Monteith equation and
    a modified version of Penman''s equation to calculate ETo. Hourly weather data
    is used to calculate hourly ETo, which is subsequently added up over 24 h (midnight
    to midnight local time) to estimate daily ETo. Monthly ETo values reported by
    the CIMIS portal are the aggregation of daily values in metric units (mm). More
    information about CIMIS data and the Penman-Monteith equation can be found in
    Ahmadi et al. (2022). For this study, monthly ETo data from 107 active CIMIS stations
    are acquired (https://cimis.water.ca.gov/). Stations are chosen according to their
    maintenance and condition records. Stations with unreliable or inconsistent data
    (e.g., stations with poor maintenance, non-grass reference surface, or inadequate
    irrigation) are eliminated from this analysis. All 107 stations used in this study
    have data available until the end of June 2022 without any missing values for
    monthly ETo. However, the stations have been established at different times; therefore,
    their data''s start dates vary. To have a better understanding of the effect of
    historical data availability on the performance of the forecasting models, stations
    are categorized into three categories: 1) long records: stations with more than
    25 years of data, 2) medium-length records: stations with 15 to 25 years of data,
    and 3) short records: stations with 5 to 15 years of data. There are 34, 38, and
    35 stations in the first, second, and third categories, respectively. The oldest
    stations have data available from 1986. No further data preprocessing has been
    conducted on the raw ETo data. Fig. 1 shows the distribution of the stations for
    each category. The zoning scheme in Fig. 1 refers to homogeneous zones with respect
    to the reference evapotranspiration. CIMIS divides California into 18 homogeneous
    zones with similar meteorological and evapotranspiration characteristics. More
    information about these zones'' climatic characteristics and locations can be
    found in Table S1 and Figure S9 in the supplementary material. Readers are referred
    to Ahmadi et al. (2022) for more in-depth information about how ETo and its meteorological
    driving factors compare between these zones. Download : Download high-res image

    with 5 to 15 years of data, respectively. (For interpretation of the references
    to colour in this figure legend, the reader is referred to the web version of
    this article.) 3. Methodology 3.1. Time series decomposition An essential step
    in analyzing time series characteristics is decomposition. This technique splits
    the time series into three main components: trend, seasonality, and residual error
    (a.k.a. noise components). In this study, we used the Statsmodels library in Python
    to perform an additive time series decomposition (Equation (1): (1) Where is the
    observed value at time t, and , , and are the trend, seasonality, and residual
    components, respectively. 3.2. Forecasting strategy and horizon This research
    focuses on univariate time series forecasting without using exogenous variables
    to forecast monthly ETo. Hence, the only input to forecasting models is monthly
    ETo in previous time steps. To perform one-step and multi-step ahead forecasting,
    we employed three forecasting horizons: one month ahead, three months ahead, and
    six months ahead. The last two years of data, July 2020 to June 2022, are used
    as the test set. For each station, all the forecasting models are trained with
    the data before July 2020, and after training, their performances are evaluated
    according to their forecasts for the test set. Having the same time frame as the
    test set for all the stations and models minimizes the seasonal and climatological
    biases in measuring forecasting accuracy. Fig. 2 shows how the models are trained
    and used to forecast. The model is trained with the original training data to
    forecast the first horizon. The training data is expanded in the next step, and
    the stride is added. The model is now retrained with this expanded training set
    and forecasts the next horizon. This procedure continues until the model forecasts
    the last time step (i.e., June 2022). For all horizons, the stride is set to one
    time step (one month). Notably, we conducted retraining only for statistical and
    machine learning models. Since DL models require a long time to train, these models
    are trained only on the original training set and are not retrained at each step.
    However, the DL models use extended data at each step as input. Download : Download

    and forecasting time steps. We employed two well-known strategies for multi-step
    ahead time series forecasting: recursive strategy and multi-input multi-output
    (MIMO) strategy. Recursive strategy, also called iterated or multi-stage, is the
    oldest and most intuitive forecasting strategy (Taieb et al., 2012). In this strategy,
    forecasting model f is trained to perform a one-step-ahead forecast: (2) Equation
    (2) represents a univariate recursive strategy that forecasts the variable of
    interest (y) at time step t + 1 using the same variable at k previous time steps.
    A recursive strategy can also be used for multi-step ahead forecasting. To do
    so, the model first forecasts the first step. Subsequently, the forecasted value
    is added to the input variables to forecast the next step, using the same one-step
    ahead model f. This procedure is continued until the whole horizon is forecasted.
    Contrary to the recursive strategy, in the MIMO strategy, the forecasting function
    F is a multiple-output function that forecasts the entire horizon simultaneously:
    (3) As shown in equation (3), in the MIMO strategy, the whole forecasting horizon,
    which consists of H time steps, is forecasted by one iteration of the F function.
    It is worth noting that there is no difference between recursive and MIMO strategies
    for one-step ahead forecasting. It should be noted that the MIMO strategy can
    be implemented for machine learning and DL models only. In other words, the statistical
    forecasting models of this study are all restricted to recursive strategy. 3.3.
    Time series forecasting models We use Darts, a Python library for time series
    manipulation and forecasting (Herzen et al., 2022). Darts contains a variety of
    forecasting models, from statistical such as ARIMA to cutting-edge deep neural
    networks. Readers are referred to Herzen et al. (2022) for more information about
    this library. 3.4. Statistical forecasting models 3.4.1. (Seasonal) autoregressive
    integrated moving average (ARIMA and SARIMA) The ARIMA model is one of the most
    popular linear models in time series forecasting (Contreras et al., 2003). ARIMA
    combines autoregressive (AR), differencing (I), and moving average (MA) features
    (Hyndman and Athanasopoulos, 2018). Differencing refers to computing the difference
    between consecutive observations to remove non-stationarity from time series.
    The autoregressive component is a linear model that forecasts the variable of
    interest using a linear combination of past values of the same variable. In other
    words, the AR model is a linear univariate forecasting model. The MA model, on
    the other hand, uses past forecast errors instead of past values of the variable
    of interest in a regression-like model. An ARIMA model has three hyperparameters,
    which are non-negative integers and need to be determined by the user: p, which
    is the order (number of time lags) of the AR model, d which is the order of differencing
    (i.e., the number of times the data have had past values subtracted), and q which
    is the order of the MA model (i.e., the size of the moving average window). ARIMA
    model is a non-seasonal forecasting model. The seasonal ARIMA (SARIMA) model includes
    additional seasonal terms in the original ARIMA model. SARIMA has four additional
    hyperparameters, P, D, and Q (order of the seasonal component for the AR, difference,
    and MA models, respectively). The fourth hyperparameter of the SARIMA model is
    m, which is the periodicity or the number of time steps in a whole seasonal period.
    For monthly data, m = 12. More detailed information about the ARIMA and SARIMA
    models can be found in Hyndman and Athanasopoulos (2018). This study used the
    pmdarima statistical library in Python to optimize ARIMA and SARIMA hyperparameters.
    We optimized hyperparameters for each station and used those station-specific
    parameters to train ARIMA and SARIMA models. From the pmdarima library, we used
    the AutoARIMA model, which identifies the optimal set of parameters for ARIMA
    and SARIMA models, settling on a single-fitted model. In calibration, we set the
    maximum p, q, P, and Q values to 5. As we work with monthly data, m was set to
    12. The information criterion used to select the best model was the Akaike information
    criterion (AIC). We used alpha = 0.05 as the test level for statistical significance,
    the Kwiatkowski–Phillips–Schmidt–Shin (KPSS) unit root test to detect stationarity,
    and Osborn-Chui-Smith-Birchenhall (OCSB) as the seasonal unit root test. A stepwise
    algorithm outlined by Hyndman and Khandakar (2008) is used to optimize the model
    parameters. The limited-memory Broyden–Fletcher–Goldfarb–Shanno (BFGS) algorithm
    with optional box constraints (L-BFGS) is employed as the optimization algorithm.
    Figures S1 and S2 in the supplementary material illustrate the distribution of
    optimized hyperparameters for different stations, categorized by their historical
    data availability. ARIMA and SARIMA models of the Darts library are wrapped around
    the Statsmodels Python module. 3.4.2. Holt-Winters'' exponential smoothing Exponential
    smoothing is a statistical forecasting method proposed in the late 1950s (Holt,
    2004, Winters, 1960). Exponential smoothing is a univariate method that uses weighted
    averages of past observations to forecast future steps. These weights decay exponentially
    as the observations get older. In other words, the more recent the observation,
    the higher the associated weight (Hyndman and Athanasopoulos, 2018). More information
    about this method is available in Kalekar (2004) and Hyndman and Athanasopoulos
    (2018). The model used in this study is wrapped around Statsmodels Holt-Winters''
    exponential smoothing. We used an additive model for both trend and seasonality
    components. The seasonal period is set to 12, and the trend component is damped.
    3.4.3. Theta method The Theta model proposed by Assimakopoulos and Nikolopoulos
    (2000) is a univariate forecasting method based on modifying the local curvature
    of the time series using a coefficient “Theta” (a real number) applied to the
    second differences of the data. Theta method decomposes the original data into
    two or more lines, extrapolates them using appropriate forecasting models, and
    then combines their predictions to obtain the final forecast. This study uses
    the 4Theta model, a modified version of the original Theta method (Spiliotis et
    al., 2020). Through a manual search, we chose Theta = 2 for this model. The seasonality
    period is set to 12, and the type of seasonality is multiplicative. The Theta
    lines are combined with an additive model, and the trend mode is linear. For more
    information about the Theta and 4Theta models, readers are referred to Assimakopoulos
    and Nikolopoulos (2000) and Spiliotis et al. (2020), respectively. 3.5. Machine
    learning model (LightGBM) This study employs the LightGBM as a machine learning
    forecasting tool. LightGBM, initially proposed by Ke et al. (2017) and developed
    by Microsoft as a free and open-source framework, provides an efficient implementation
    of the gradient boosting algorithm and reduces memory usage. Gradient boosting
    is an ensemble method where ensembles are constructed from decision tree models.
    Models are fit through a gradient descent optimization algorithm, where the loss
    gradient is minimized as the model is tuned. In the machine learning literature
    and competitions, gradient boosting and decision tree-based models outperform
    other regression algorithms when applied to tabular data (Shwartz-Ziv and Armon,
    2022). Moreover, it is shown in the literature that gradient boosting algorithms
    work similarly in terms of accuracy and runtime, while some studies point to the
    superiority of LightGBM (Al Daoud, 2019). Therefore, this study employs LightGBM
    as its machine learning model. We feed 12 previous time steps as the input of
    the LightGBM model. More information about the LightGBM method can be found in
    Ke et al. (2017) and Al Daoud (2019). 3.6. Deep learning models We conducted a
    manual hyperparameter tuning for all deep learning models. We objectively searched
    different values for hyperparameters and chose a subset that resulted in the best-performing
    model. We also conducted a grid search for the dropout rate. Data from the Davis
    CIMIS station, one of the best-maintained CIMIS stations with data from 1986,
    is used for hyperparameter tuning. When two sets of hyperparameters had similar
    performances, we chose the simpler model (i.e., the model with fewer trainable
    parameters). To facilitate the comparison between different models, the input
    of all DL models is ETo in the past 12 months. 3.6.1. N-BEATS N-BEATS is a deep
    neural architecture based on backward and forward residual links and a very deep
    stack of fully connected layers (Oreshkin et al., 2019). N-BEATS was originally
    developed in 2019 to solve the univariate time series forecasting problem. N-BEATS
    architecture is fast to train and demonstrates state-of-the-art performance for
    different datasets. For more information about N-BEATS architecture, readers are
    referred to Oreshkin et al. (2019). In this study, we employed the generic architecture
    outlined in Oreshkin et al. (2019). In this architecture, we used four stacks,
    with four blocks in each stack. We used four fully connected layers preceding
    the final backcast-forecast forking layer in each block, with 16 neurons in each
    layer. The expansion coefficient dimension is set to five, and the rectified linear
    unit (ReLU) is used as the activation function of the encoder/decoder intermediate
    layer. The grid search showed that N-BEATS works best without dropout; therefore,
    the dropout probability was set to zero. We trained the model over 100 epochs
    with a batch size of 32. 3.6.2. Long short-term memory (LSTM) LSTM, proposed by
    Hochreiter and Schmidhuber (1997), is a recurrent neural network (RNN). Numerous
    studies in agriculture and hydrology have employed LSTM for forecasting purposes
    (Ni et al., 2020, Ghasemlounia et al., 2021, Hunt et al., 2022). RNN models are
    generally suitable for solving problems with sequential input data like time series.
    However, vanilla RNN models struggle with remembering information for an extended
    period, which is called a long-term dependency problem. LSTM architecture is designed
    exclusively to avoid this problem, which is the main advantage of this model.
    More information about LSTM can be found in Hochreiter and Schmidhuber (1997)
    and Van Houdt et al. (2020). Our LSTM model consists of one recurrent layer with
    12 features in the hidden state. The dropout is set to zero for this model. The
    LSTM model is trained over 1,000 epochs with a batch size of 8. 3.6.3. Temporal
    convolutional network (TCN) Although convolutional neural networks (CNNs) are
    commonly associated with raster data, they can also be used for sequential data
    with the proper modifications. The TCN, presented by Bai et al. (2018), is a generic
    convolutional architecture designed for sequence modeling. In this study, we use
    dilated TCN for forecasting. Readers are referred to Bai et al. (2018) for more
    information about this model. Our model has a kernel size of 6 and 18 filters.
    The base of the exponent determining the dilation on every level is set to two.
    We used weight normalization of the model and a dropout rate of 0.1. With a batch
    size of 32, we trained the model for 1,000 epochs. 3.6.4. Transformer model Transformer
    is a state-of-the-art DL model introduced by Vaswani et al. (2017). Following
    an encoder-decoder structure, the transformer architecture does not rely on recurrence
    and convolutions to generate an output. The core feature of its architecture is
    the multi-head attention mechanism. In the case of sequential data, a multi-head
    attention mechanism can jointly attend to information at different positions in
    the sequence, making Transformer an appealing architecture for time series forecasting.
    The mechanism is also highly parallelizable, which makes the Transformer architecture
    suitable to be trained with GPUs. More information about the Transformer model
    can be found in Vaswani et al. (2017). In our model, we set the number of features
    in the transformer encoder/decoder inputs to 16, with one encoder layer and one
    decoder layer. We used four heads in the multi-head attention mechanism. The dimension
    of the feedforward network model is set to 128. We used ReLU as the activation
    function of the encoder/decoder intermediate layer. According to the grid search
    results, the dropout rate is set to 0.1. The model is trained with a batch size
    of 32 and over 1,200 epochs. 3.6.5. Temporal fusion Transformer (TFT) TFT is a
    cutting-edge DL architecture introduced by Lim et al. (2021) for interpretable
    multi-horizon time series forecasting. TFT is a novel attention-based architecture
    that uses recurrent layers for local processing and a self-attention layer for
    long-term dependencies. TFT can learn temporal relationships at different scales
    and utilizes specialized components to select relevant features. Readers are referred
    to Lim et al. (2021) for detailed information about this architecture. In this
    study, we set the hidden state size of the TFT architecture to 16 and the hidden
    size for processing continuous variables to 8. We used one layer for the LSTM
    encoder/decoder. We used four attention heads, where a multi-head attention query
    is applied to the future (decoder) part only. A gated residual network is used
    as the feedforward network. PyTorch mean squared error (MSE) is employed as the
    loss function for training. We trained the model over 700 epochs with a batch
    size of 32. 3.7. Performance measures In this study, three deterministic performance
    measures are used to evaluate the accuracy of forecasting models: root mean square
    error (RMSE), mean absolute error (MAE), and coefficient of determination (R2):
    (4) (5) (6) Where N is the number of time steps; and are observed and predicted
    monthly ETo values at ith time step, respectively; and are the mean values of
    observations and predictions, respectively. Lower RMSE and MAE values and higher
    R2 values indicate higher accuracies and better performances. 4. Results and discussion
    4.1. Stations and time series characteristics Stations from different categories
    are almost uniformly distributed over the study area (Fig. 1). Therefore, we hypothesize
    that no systematic bias is introduced to the results and the categorization caused
    by the stations'' location. However, as Fig. 1 shows, there are no stations with
    15 to 25 years of data in northern California. It should be noted that since the
    primary goal of the CIMIS program is to assist farmers with irrigation management,
    most of the CIMIS stations are located in farming/irrigation-oriented regions
    of California. Therefore, there are more stations in central and southern California
    and fewer in northern California. To test our hypothesis and confirm that the
    results are not affected by the geographical and climatic differences among categories,
    we analyzed the long-term monthly ETo records of the stations. As can be inferred
    from Fig. 3, no significant difference exists between the distribution of records
    from different categories. It should be noted that box plots in Fig. 3 represent
    all the observations from all the stations used in this study. Download : Download

    the Davis CIMIS station. It should be noted that decomposition is time series-specific,
    meaning only one time series can be decomposed at a time. Here we show decomposition
    of ETo time series for a well-maintained CIMIS station with adequately long historical
    data (Davis station). This station is located in the Central Valley, where many
    other CIMIS stations are placed. Expectedly, considerable seasonality is present
    in the time series (Fig. 4). Although Fig. 4 suggests an increasing trend in the
    minimum monthly ETo values for the Davis CIMIS station, the trend component does
    not control the observed time series. More information about California, the trends
    of ETo, and its meteorological driving factors can be found in Ahmadi et al. (2022).

    Fig. 4. Results of time series decomposition for Davis CIMIS station. 4.2. Model
    complexity To have a more in-depth comparison of forecasting models, in addition
    to their accuracy, we analyzed their complexity and computational cost. Table
    1 presents the complexity of DL models by providing the number of their trainable
    parameters. Also, this table shows the runtime of all forecasting models as a
    measure of their computational cost. The runtime is based on the Google Colab
    platform without any hardware accelerator (e.g., GPU) and represents the time
    required for training the model on the Davis CIMIS station and making one-step
    ahead forecasts on the test set. In the case of ARIMA and SARIMA models, runtime
    consists of two parts: 1) optimizing the hyperparameters for Davis station using
    the pmdarima library (152 s); 2) training the model with optimized hyperparameters
    and making forecasts on the test set. Table 1. Runtime and number of trainable
    parameters of the forecasting models used in this study. Model Runtime (seconds)
    Number of trainable parameters of deep learning models ARIMA 168 (152 + 16) –
    SARIMA 266 (152 + 114) – Holt-Winters 4 – Theta 1 – LightGBM 2 – N-BEATS 59 ∼
    20,700 LSTM 645 733 TCN 253 ∼ 4,300 Transformer 367 ∼ 12,100 TFT 473 ∼ 15,400
    As expected, given their higher complexity, DL models generally have a higher
    runtime than statistical and machine learning models. However, Table 1 shows that
    N-BEATS has a significantly lower runtime than other DL and even ARIMA and SARIMA
    models. The main reason is that N-BEATS architecture is very fast to converge.
    As mentioned in the methodology section, we used only 100 epochs to train the
    N-BEATS model, whereas other DL models required a much higher number of epochs
    to reach minimum loss values. Notably, the number of trainable parameters in the
    N-BEATS model is not lower than in other DL models. Quite the contrary, Table
    1 reveals that the N-BEATS architecture used in this study has the highest number
    of trainable parameters among all DL models. Our findings align with Oreshkin
    et al. (2019), demonstrating the computational efficiency of the N-BEATS model.
    Unlike the N-BEATS model, LSTM architecture is proven very slow to train. Although
    LSTM has the lowest number of trainable parameters among the DL models, it has
    the most extended runtime (Table 1). According to Yu et al. (2019), the slow training
    of LSTM can be attributed to its backward propagation through time. The literature
    suggested some methods to speed up the convergence of LSTM training (e.g., a convex-based
    LSTM network introduced by Wang, 2017). Our study''s findings also suggest no
    direct relationship between the number of trainable parameters of a DL model and
    its runtime. Based on these findings, we hypothesize that the overall architecture
    of a DL model is more important than merely the number of trainable parameters
    in the model’s computational cost. 4.3. Forecasting accuracy We used three measures
    of performance to evaluate the accuracy of forecasting models: RMSE, MAE, and
    R2. We show R2 results in the main text and other measures in the supplementary
    material. Since we have multiple time series with different scales in each category,
    and there is a meaningful effect of seasonality in the magnitude of monthly ETo
    at various timesteps, a scale-free accuracy measure like R2 is preferred. According
    to Fildes et al. (2022), results of non-scale-free measures (e.g., RMSE) should
    be handled cautiously in the case of time series forecasting. Fig. 5, Fig. 6,
    Fig. 7 illustrate the models'' accuracy for one month, three months, and six months
    lead time ETo forecasting, respectively. As mentioned earlier, there is no difference
    between recursive and MIMO strategies in one-step-ahead forecasting. Therefore,
    Fig. 5 shows a single box for each ML and DL model. The ARIMA model forecasts
    ETo less accurately than the other models, as its performance falls considerably
    short compared to other models (Fig. 5, Fig. 6, Fig. 7). This is mainly due to
    the lack of seasonality features in the ARIMA model. As Fig. 4 illustrates, there
    is a significant seasonality in our data, and it is no surprise that a model that
    does not consider seasonality is not a good choice for ETo data. On the other
    hand, the seasonal ARIMA (SARIMA) model results in accurate monthly ETo forecasts
    for various forecasting horizons and with different amounts of available historical
    data (Fig. 5, Fig. 6, Fig. 7). This finding aligns with Aghelpour et al. (2022)
    and Ashrafzadeh et al. (2020), who report on the goodness of the SARIMA model
    for monthly ETo forecasting. Download : Download high-res image (295KB) Download

    reference evapotranspiration forecasting. As Fig. 5, Fig. 6, Fig. 7 show, LSTM,
    Transformer, and TFT models have difficulty working with smaller training sets
    (i.e., short data). In other words, these models are data-hungry and require larger
    training sets to work optimally. Transformer and TFT models are even more sensitive
    to the input data length, as their performance drops more severely than LSTM in
    the case of smaller training sets. Therefore, these models are suitable for forecasting
    agrometeorological variables only when enough input data is available. Recent
    literature offers techniques to make these models more data-efficient (e.g., Hassani
    et al. (2021)). Contrary to the data-hungry models, N-BEATS and TCN show low sensitivity
    to the input data length. The most data-efficient DL model is N-BEATS, as its
    performance is least affected by the length of the training set. LightGBM model
    is also sensitive to the length of the data, but much less than more complex DL
    models. Statistical forecasting models do not show profound sensitivity to the
    training data length. Therefore, our results point to the overall data efficiency
    of statistical models. Expectedly, all models perform better when forecasting
    the near future (e.g., one step ahead). In other words, the forecasting accuracy
    of the models drops when the forecasting horizons increase. Fig. 7 and figure
    S8 in the supplementary material suggest that N-BEATS is the best model for longer
    forecasting horizons, followed by Theta and Holt-Winters models. Our findings
    do not suggest a significant difference between the ML and DL models'' accuracy
    under recursive and MIMO strategies. It can be inferred that neither of these
    strategies has a systematic advantage, at least in our case study. Our findings
    generally point to the superior performances of simpler forecasting models compared
    to more complex DL models. Results illustrate that Theta and Holt-Winters methods
    work almost as well as the most accurate DL models while having much lower run
    time and complexity. We hypothesize that these models are more suitable for less
    complex time series, like ETo data. Another important note is that although numerous
    hydrological and agricultural studies employ the SARIMA model (Ashrafzadeh et
    al., 2020, Aghelpour et al., 2022), our study reveals that other statistical models
    outperform this model. This is even more important as we compare the higher computational
    costs of LSTM with other statistical models (i.e., Theta and Holt-Winters; see
    Table 1). Considering the computational cost and the forecasting accuracy, N-BEATS
    is the best model among the models evaluated in this study. N-BEATS is very fast
    to train (Table 1), data-efficient, and can accurately forecast long horizons
    (Fig. 5, Fig. 6, Fig. 7). One reason for the superior performance of N-BEATS might
    be that this DL model was initially developed for univariate time series forecasting.
    In other words, this model works better than other DL models for our case because,
    inherently, it is the most appropriate architecture. 4.4. Observed vs. Forecasted
    time series Fig. 8 depicts the forecasted time series of the N-BEATS (i.e., the
    best DL model) and Holt-Winters (i.e., the best statistical model) models against
    the observed values for different forecasting horizons. Davis, Auburn, and Woodland
    stations are chosen to represent stations with various data lengths (available
    data from 1986, 2005, and 2011, respectively). All these stations are placed in
    ETo zone 14 (Mid-central Valley) and close to each other. This proximity minimizes
    the effects of climate and geographic characteristics on the models'' performance.
    Fig. 8 confirms the previous findings on the similarity of performances between
    the best DL model (i.e., N-BEATS) and the statistical model (i.e., Holt-Winters).
    This figure indicates that when monthly ETo values are increasing (when it is
    getting warmer), the forecasted values of both models tend to underestimate observed
    values. Download : Download high-res image (494KB) Download : Download full-size
    image Fig. 8. Time series of observed and forecasted monthly reference evapotranspiration
    for three CIMIS stations. Dashed black lines, solid red lines, and solid blue
    lines depict observed values, Holt-Winters model forecasted values, and N-BEATS
    model forecasted values, respectively. (For interpretation of the references to
    colour in this figure legend, the reader is referred to the web version of this
    article.) On the other hand, when monthly ETo values are decreasing (i.e., when
    it is getting cooler), forecasted values tend to overpredict observed values.
    Again, this pattern happens for both N-BEATS and Holt-Winters models. This behavior
    can be attributed to DL and statistical models using past time series values to
    forecast and tend toward the averaged values. In the case of the Holt-Winters
    method, this is more evident, as this method uses weighted averages of past observations
    to forecast new values, while the exponential smoothing technique gives more importance
    (i.e., larger weights) to more recent observations. Given the similarity between
    the forecasted values of Holt-Winters and the DL model (Fig. 8), we speculate
    that a DL method might learn the same pattern in input data. Due to this tendency
    toward predicting average values of past observations, a postprocessing model
    that adds/subtracts residuals to the predicted ETo data based on the slope of
    predictions can be explored as an alternative to improve forecasts. 5. Summary
    and conclusion This study evaluated the performance, computational cost, and complexity
    of well-known statistical and state-of-the-art machine learning and deep learning
    models for forecasting reference evapotranspiration (ETo). Monthly ETo in 107
    standardized stations in California was used for this analysis. Stations were
    categorized according to historical data availability, and models were tested
    for various forecasting horizons. Recursive and MIMO forecasting strategies were
    evaluated for machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) models. Significant
    findings of this study and insights for future research include: 1. Complex deep
    learning models (e.g., LSTM and Transformer) are not data-efficient enough for
    agrometeorological forecasting. Given the scarcity of agrometeorological data
    and the unavoidable data gaps in time series measured by micrometeorological sensors,
    more research is needed on the data efficiency of DL forecasting models. One potential
    solution for this issue is developing pre-trained DL models that can be retrained
    for short-range agrometeorological data (aka, transfer learning; e.g., Raei et
    al., 2022). Furthermore, generative adversarial networks can potentially help
    alleviate this problem. 2. Simpler statistical forecasting models work as well
    or even better than state-of-the-art deep learning models. This might be due to
    the inherent simplicity of monthly reference evapotranspiration. Further studies
    are required to analyze the performance of these models for more complex agrometeorological
    time series. 3. N-BEATS was the best overall deep learning forecasting model.
    N-BEATS is very fast to cooverge, requiring only 100 epochs to train, while other
    DL models need a much higher number of training epochs (e.g., 1,000 in the case
    of LSTM and 1,200 for Transformer). N-BEATS is also very data-efficient; this
    model can forecast monthly ETo accurately even when less than fifteen years of
    historical data is available. 4. Although the most popular statistical method
    for agrometeorological time series forecasting is SARIMA, our findings reveal
    that Holt-Winters and Theta methods are more data-efficient, less computationally
    expensive, and generally more accurate than SARIMA. Future studies can evaluate
    their performance in other cases, for example yield forecasting. 5. Our findings
    reveal no significant difference between recursive and MIMO strategies. A more
    in-depth study is needed to analyze the effects of forecasting strategy on the
    performance of ML and DL models, primarily when covariates (e.g., from numerical
    weather predictions or other sensors) are used to inform ETo forecasting. Some
    of the limitations of the current research that introduce opportunities for future
    studies include the following: 1. This research focused on monthly data with a
    clear seasonality component. More studies are needed to evaluate the performance
    of forecasting models for higher-frequency input data (e.g., daily data). 2. This
    study focused on univariate time series, while several agrometeorological cases
    can benefit from covariates and exogenous variables. According to the findings
    of the M5 competition, multivariate models with informative exogenous variables
    are expected to outperform univariate models (Makridakis et al., 2022). We hypothesize
    that introducing exogenous variables to deep learning models will boost their
    performance. However, it should be noted that statistical models are generally
    restrained to one variable. When exogenous variables are available, multivariate
    deep learning models are expected to outperform simpler statistical models. Future
    studies can test these hypotheses. 3. This study trains models for each station.
    However, deep learning models can benefit from cross-learning. Cross- or global-learning
    refers to learning from multiple series to extract information from the global
    data set (Makridakis et al., 2022). This is especially advantageous in agrometeorological
    forecasting, as the time series from various stations and sensors may share common
    characteristics (e.g., seasonality). For instance, ungauged regions with poor
    data history can benefit from neighboring stations and cross-learning strategies
    for accurate forecasting. Future studies can cast light on the advantages of cross-learning
    in agrometeorological forecasting. 4. This research focused on California as the
    case study. Although California is a climatically diverse case study with various
    ecosystems, more studies are required to evaluate the findings of this research
    in other climate conditions. However, as the agrometeorological time series are
    often similar to the time series used in this study in terms of a dominant seasonal
    component, we hypothesize that the findings of this research are relevant to other
    regions and climates. CRediT authorship contribution statement Arman Ahmadi: Software,

  description: 'The modern agriculture industry is data-centred, precise and smarter
    than ever. Advanced development of Internet-of-Things (IoT) based systems redesigned
    “smart agriculture”. This emergence in innovative farming systems gradually increases
    crop yields, reduces irrigation wastages and making it more profitable. Machine
    learning (ML) methods achieve the requirement of scaling the learning performance
    of the model. This paper introduces a hybrid ML model with IoT for yield prediction.
    This work involves three phases: pre-processing, feature selection (FS) and classification.
    Initially, the dataset is pre-processed and FS is done on the basis of Correlation
    based FS (CBFS) and the Variance Inflation Factor algorithm (VIF). Finally, a
    two-tier ML model for an IoT based smart agriculture system is proposed. In the
    first tier, the Adaptive k-Nearest Centroid Neighbour Classifier (aKNCN) model
    is proposed to estimate the soil quality and to classify the soil samples into
    different classes based on the input soil properties. In the second tier, the
    crop yield is predicted using the Extreme Learning Machine algorithm (ELM). In
    the optimized strategy, the weights are updated using a modified Butterfly Optimization
    Algorithm (mBOA) to improve the performance accuracy of ELM with minimum error
    values. PYTHON is the implementation tool for evaluating the proposed system.
    Soil dataset is utilized for performance evaluation of the proposed prediction
    model. Various metrics such as accuracy, RMSE, R2, MSE, MedAE, MAE, MSLE, MAPE
    and Explained Variance Score (EVS) are considered for the performance evaluation.'

    Explore all metrics Abstract The modern agriculture industry is data-centred,
    precise and smarter than ever. Advanced development of Internet-of-Things (IoT)
    based systems redesigned “smart agriculture”. This emergence in innovative farming
    systems gradually increases crop yields, reduces irrigation wastages and making
    it more profitable. Machine learning (ML) methods achieve the requirement of scaling
    the learning performance of the model. This paper introduces a hybrid ML model
    with IoT for yield prediction. This work involves three phases: pre-processing,
    feature selection (FS) and classification. Initially, the dataset is pre-processed
    and FS is done on the basis of Correlation based FS (CBFS) and the Variance Inflation
    Factor algorithm (VIF). Finally, a two-tier ML model for an IoT based smart agriculture
    system is proposed. In the first tier, the Adaptive k-Nearest Centroid Neighbour
    Classifier (aKNCN) model is proposed to estimate the soil quality and to classify
    the soil samples into different classes based on the input soil properties. In
    the second tier, the crop yield is predicted using the Extreme Learning Machine
    algorithm (ELM). In the optimized strategy, the weights are updated using a modified
    Butterfly Optimization Algorithm (mBOA) to improve the performance accuracy of
    ELM with minimum error values. PYTHON is the implementation tool for evaluating
    the proposed system. Soil dataset is utilized for performance evaluation of the
    proposed prediction model. Various metrics such as accuracy, RMSE, R2, MSE, MedAE,
    MAE, MSLE, MAPE and Explained Variance Score (EVS) are considered for the performance
    evaluation. Similar content being viewed by others Developing an IoT-Based Data

    Article Open access 11 January 2024 1 Introduction IoT is an advanced technology
    for monitoring and controlling devices anywhere in the world. In many fields,
    it creates a remarkable mark due to its easy accessibility. Few technologies developed
    by IoT, such as remote sensors, drones and robots have made people''s lives easier
    and more beneficial. Moreover, these technologies have experimented on fundamental
    needs such as food that is obtained from the agricultural field. From the recent
    survey of World Bank, it is approximated that more than 50% of food is required
    to cultivate before 2050 based on present population rate. However, such huge
    production of the crop is a challenging task because of the current climatic changes.
    In such cases, Smart agriculture system plays a vital role to increase the yield
    by monitoring and predicting the production of the crops. IoT based crop yield
    prediction enables the farmers to enhance productivity. In general, an IoT based
    smart farming system is deployed in an agriculture field for monitoring the crop
    field with the help of sensors namely DHT11 (temperature and humidity sensor),
    TOC (Total Organic Carbon) and nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium (NPK) sensors.
    Using this setup, farmers can monitor the field conditions from anywhere. Gateways
    are responsible for receiving data from the crop area and forward them to the
    storage unit. The prediction engine is used to predict the results and sends information
    to the notification server. Agricultural supervision, particularly crop yield
    observation is essential for examining the food security in a region. Manually
    predicting crop yield is a challenging task due to several difficult aspects.
    Based on the water quality as well as availability, pest infestations, genotype,
    landscape, soil quality, climatic condition, etc., the crop yield may vary. The
    strategies and the processes are non-linear in nature, intricate and varied with
    time because of external aspects and correlated factors (Elavarasan and Vincent
    2020). Recently, several studies illustrate that ML approaches such as support
    vector regression, multilayer perceptron (MLP), etc. have comparatively more enhanced
    potential than the traditional techniques. These approaches have the ability to
    predict linear and non-linear agricultural architecture. These methods were obtained
    from the learning process in the ML agricultural framework (Dang et al. 2020;
    Van Klompenburg et al. 2020; Bhojani and Bhatt 2020). On observing the most outstanding
    frameworks in agriculture, artificial and deep neural networks are the commonly
    utilized models (Gopal and Bhargavi 2019). Some of the ML models used to predict
    the crop yield are neural architecture search (NAS) (Ren et al. 2020), linear
    discriminant analysis (LDA) (Yan et al. 2020), spectral clustering (Li et al.
    2018a, b; Li et al. 2019) and artificial neural network (ANN) (Gopal 2019). ANN
    is a network model that generates approximation by bias as well as a weight optimization
    for a node-link structure including input, hidden and output layers. Deep learning
    (DL) is a subgroup of ML that is used to predict the crop yield based on the varying
    arrangement of raw data via the intensive learning process in a deep network (Shook
    et al. 2020). Moreover, these DL algorithms have the capability to design a probability
    model using field data. In addition to this advantage, DL approaches provide data
    on plant performance under various climate changes (Nevavuori et al. 2020). For
    example, Reinforcement learning is one of the major areas of artificial intelligence.
    It is the preparation of ML models for decision-making sequences and is the significant
    class of algorithm that is used to streamline the logic for dynamic programming
    (Elavarasan and Vincent 2021). Besides, extreme learning machine (ELM) is also
    a ML approach capable of enabling neural network training for predicting the crop
    yield. It accelerates the learning process and provided better outcomes. However,
    these approaches have several disadvantages like less sustainability, computationally
    expensive, high complexity and false prediction (Suchithra and Pai 2020). To overcome
    these challenges, an efficient ML based crop yield prediction model is proposed
    in this work. Agriculture is the major source that increases the economic system
    of India. In order to overcome the issues of high cost and complex management
    of conventional agricultural planting, IoT is applied for realizing real time
    detection, crop growth intelligent management and change the conventional agricultural
    planting mode. Various mathematical and empirical yield approaches have been evaluated
    for several crops. These models requires an enormous amount of knowledge about
    soil and crop, which makes it hard for implementing for various localities. Many
    satellites based remote sensing methods have also been developed for yield modelling.
    But these approaches are not able to provide enough spatial details for small
    farms to optimize crops. Recent development of ML models enables researchers to
    solve and understand complex predictions. Motivated by this, aKNCN is used in
    the research work for soil quality estimation and ELM-mBOA is used for crop yield
    prediction thereby achieves better results.The major contributions of the proposed
    work are: The proposed work provides an IoT based farming system that ensures
    the deployment of effective crop yield prediction model. This work involves pre-processing,
    Feature selection and classification. The data is pre-processed and the features
    are selected by Feature selection algorithms. Then IoT based smart agriculture
    system using two-tier ML model is proposed for the better prediction of crop yield.
    Ml based Classification model Adaptive k-Nearest Centroid Neighbour Classifier
    (aKNCN) is used to classify the soil samples for different classes by considering
    the properties of soil dataset. Extreme learning machine algorithm (ELM) model
    is proposed for predicting the crop yield and the weights of the model is updated
    using modified Butterfly Optimization Algorithm (mBOA) to improve the prediction
    system with less error values. Paper outline: Sect. 1 presents the introduction
    and highlights smart agricultures in brief. Recent related works during (2019–2021)
    are discussed in Sect. 2. Section 3 presents the proposed framework along with
    important measurable. Section 4 discusses the experimental analysis and results.
    Section 5 provides the applications of the proposed methodology and Sect. 6 concludes
    the presented work. 2 Related works Abbas et al. (2020) predicted the crop yield
    via proximal sensing and the ML algorithms. The objective was to extract significant
    data that are responsible for controlling the yield of crop. The properties of
    potato tuber crop and the data of soil have been gathered by proximal sensing.
    A large dataset was utilized for the prediction performance. Support vector regression
    (SVR), k-nearest neighbour (K-NN), linear regression and elastic net ML algorithms
    were utilized for the classification and prediction of crop yield. The metrics
    like R2, MAE and RMSE were determined for the performance evaluation. The performance
    achieved for KNN was poor due to the increased number of functions in predicting
    crop yield. Rezk et al. (2021) presented an IoT based smart agriculture system
    using ML algorithm. The drought and the crop productivity were predicted by WPART
    and it was a combination of wrapper and PART techniques. Feature selection and
    classification were the two important phases in the prediction process. Wrapper
    feature selection technique selected the optimal features for further classification.
    PART was a partial decision tree approach used for classification and prediction.
    Accuracy, precision, sensitivity and F1 score were considered for the experiment
    of WPART. The crops taken for experiment were Sugarcane, Jowar, Bajra and Soybean.
    Some samples in the dataset were misleadingly labelled, thus the false prediction
    rate was high. Bu and Wang (2019) developed deep reinforcement learning based
    ML technique for a smart farming IoT system. To classify and predict the crop
    yield, cloud computing and artificial intelligence were combined. The key goal
    of this research was to minimize resource consumption and maximize food production.
    A hierarchical Bayesian based multi-task reinforcement learning method has been
    utilized for modelling the Markov decision process. Then, the Q-value regression
    function was examined using policy distillation. However, computational complexity
    was considered as one of the major drawback of this approach. Also, performance
    on a human level was not achieved in solving complex task and adapting to dynamic
    environments. Nevavuori, et al. (2019) proposed a deep learning technique for
    crop yield prediction. The key objectives of this research were crop yield prediction,
    biomass evaluation, crop and weed detection. Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)
    was modelled for extracting the features, training, hyperparameter tuning and
    regularization to predict the yield of wheat and barley crops. MAE and MAPE are
    the evaluation metrics used for simulation analysis. But, the presented CNN does
    not perform well for the large dataset. Also, the performance efficiency of this
    method was not good. Dos Santos et al. (2019) introduced AgriPrediction model
    for IoT based smart agriculture system. It was an end-to-end model that predicted
    agricultural crops. It was the integration of prediction as well as short and
    medium wireless network range system. The components of the AgriPrediction model
    have been designed according to the ARIMA prediction model and LoRa IoT technology.
    Initially, the data were gathered using sensors, then the discrete moving average-based
    prediction has been performed. If the predicted crop goes wrong, then the notification
    was given to the farmer’s mobile phone. This model was computationally expensive
    and less sustainable. Moreover, the accuracy of this AgriPrediction model was
    not evaluated in this research. The future scope of this research is to generate
    a mobile application for crop’s real-time monitoring. Saranya and Nagarajan (2020)
    presented a neural network with population based incremental learning (NN-PBIL)
    method to improve predictive performance. The neural network was used to classify
    and predict the crop yield. The weight of the neural network was updated by the
    PBIL approach. The Hadoop framework has been utilized for the prediction performance.
    Neural network along with ANN and multiple linear regressions (MLR) were implemented
    for the crop yield prediction. Low convergence and getting stuck within local
    minimum were the major drawbacks in this presented model. Filippi et al. (2019)
    proposed the empirical modelling scheme for predicting the yield of barley, wheat
    and canola crops. In this research, several fields are considered for the prediction
    performance instead of single field in isolation. Random forest models and publically
    available data with temporal and spatial data collected on-farm were combined
    for the yield prediction of canola, barley and wheat. The experimental results
    showed that the accuracy obtained by this predictive model was low. Sun et al.
    (2019) predicted the soybean yield both during the season and at the end of the
    season using deep CNN-LSTM based on remote sensing data. The training data such
    as MODIS surface reflectance (SR) data, MODIS land surface temperature (LST) data
    and weather data were correlated and transformed to histogram based tensors according
    to the Google earth engine (GEE). The performance of crop yield prediction at
    large scale was not evaluated in this research. Time and computational complexity
    was high and fed the raw remote sensing data into DL mode was a complex task.
    However, there are some limitations with these approaches like computational complexity,
    high expensive, dependencies between target and input variables, proper model
    representation and accuracy, affected by data quality. Due to these drawbacks
    the proposed model introduces 2 classification models with optimal weight selection
    for crop yield prediction. 3 Proposed framework The ingredients of soil such as
    phosphorous, potassium and nitrogen, crop rotation and atmospheric temperature
    etc. play a vital role in cultivation. ML methods are an essential decision support
    device for the prediction of crop yield like supporting decision on what crops
    to grow. Many ML algorithms are employed to support the prediction of crop yield.
    In the proposed smart agricultural framework, pre-processing, FS and a two-tier
    model is implemented for crop yield prediction. Here, akNCN is proposed, which
    is an improved version of KNCN. Generally ELM is an influential model with more
    fast learning methods, higher performance and less training error when compared
    with other algorithms. Therefore these two classification algorithms are proposed
    in this work to improve the accuracy of the system and provide better results
    than the existing models. Figure 1 illustrates the architecture of the proposed
    crop yield prediction model. Initially, Pre-processing is done to remove the noise
    in data and the features are selected on the basis of features selection methods
    like CBFA and VIF. Finally, the classification uses two tier systems. In the first
    tier, the proposed aKNCN model is used to classify the soil quality based on IoT
    system collected soil nutrients. In the second tier, ELM-mBOA is utilized for
    crop yield prediction and the accuracy is improved by optimal weight selection
    using mBOA. This model improves the accuracy of the system with minimum error
    values. Fig. 1 Architecture of the proposed methodology Full size image 3.1 Pre-processing
    The data is gathered from various sources and pre-processed. Pre-processing is
    a necessary phase in ML since it can’t handle noisy data. Noisy data means it
    has errors and outliers. Before the data can be used for classification, it must
    be pre-processed to insert missing values, remove unwanted data, extract functions
    and keep the appropriate data range. In this work isnull () approach is used to
    check the null values then the label encoder() is used to convert categorical
    data (string format) into numerical data (numeric format). Since Python does not
    handle categorical data, it must be converted into numeric format. Once the data
    is converted to numeric format, it is applied for feature selection. 3.2 Feature
    selection (FS) ML is a computational learning model that works on the prediction
    of statistical value. The FS model is applied to identify necessary features,
    which are powerful in correlation with crop production. The main reason to employ
    FS is that it enables the ML algorithm to train faster, minimizes the model complexity
    and makes it easy to interpret. It also increases the system accuracy when the
    proper subset is selected and reduces overfitting. The computation time of the
    algorithm is less necessary than its classification for normal size feature sets.
    But the feature selection is necessary for large datasets. Various statistical
    approaches can be employed in FS like filter, embedded and wrapper methods. Filter
    methods choose the intrinsic characteristics of the features computed by univariate
    statistics instead of performance of cross-validation. These methods are faster
    and less computationally expensive than wrapper methods. When dealing with high-dimensional
    data, it is computationally cheaper to use filter methods. Hence, in this work
    filter based FS methods like CBFA algorithm and VIF algorithm are used. CBFA chooses
    the best feature set which is mainly correlated with yield. VIF verifies the multicollinearity
    among independent features. Therefore, it eliminates all multicollinear features.
    3.2.1 Correlation based feature selection algorithm (CBFA) CBFS orders feature
    subset based on the correlation heuristic evaluation function. This function is
    towards a subset that has features which have high correlation amongst class and
    uncorrelated with each other. The features which are not relevant must be removed
    since they have less correlation amongst class and high correlation with other
    features. Feature acceptance is based on the extent to which it identifies classes
    in areas which are already not identified by other features. The CBFS is computed
    as: $$ M = \\frac{{Nr\\overline{c}}}{{\\sqrt {N + N(N - 1)\\,r\\overline{f}} }}
    $$ (1) where \\(N\\) is the total number of features, \\(r\\overline{c}\\) is
    the average correlation, \\(r\\overline{f}\\) is average feature to pair wise
    correlation. 3.2.2 Variance inflation factor algorithm (VIF) VIF computes the
    strength of the multi colinearity in the analysis of least squares regression.
    It gives an index that computes how much the variance of an evaluated regression
    coefficient is enhanced due to colinearity. VIF model is employed for removing
    correlated independent features. This method is fast and it exploits one pass
    search to the predictor. In addition, this method is computationally efficient
    in testing every predictor to the model and it avoids the overfitting issue. It
    is achieved by regressing each independent variable, let Y on the remaining independent
    variables (W and Z) and checking how much of it (of Y) is explained by these variables.VIF
    is measured by $$ V = \\frac{1}{{1 - R^{2} }} $$ (2) From the expression it is
    shown that the higher the VIF, higher the R2 which means the variable X is collinear
    with Y and Z variables. If all the variables are completely orthogonal, R2 will
    be 0 resulting in VIF of 1. 3.3 Tier 1-classification In this work, aKNCN (Rosdi
    et al. 2021) is used to classify the soil classes from the different parameters.
    The proposed aKNCN overcomes the challenges of conventional KNCN and enhanced
    the performance of KNCN classification. KNCN is a non-parametric classifier that
    depends on the centroid distance. This states the nearest neighbours of the test
    samples should satisfy the following criteria—it should be close to test samples
    and the nearest neighbour distribution should be symmetrical in test samples.
    But it is complex to determine neighbours in a feature that satisfy these properties.
    Though KNCN achieves good accuracy it lags in classification time. Hence aKNCN
    is developed for improving the classification time by adaptively adjusting the
    nearest centroid neighbour for every input sample to enhance the classification
    accuracy. Two properties of aKNCN are given as follows: Property 1 TheaKNCN method
    satisfies a stable searching phase only when \\(j^{th}\\) distance of nearest
    centroid is more than pre-defined limit which is multiplier product of \\(k_{l}\\)
    and the first nearest centroid \\(z_{ncn,1}\\) to the test sample \\(d(y,z_{ncn,1}
    )\\). The size of neighbourhood is represented as $$ d(y,z_{i}^{s} ) > k_{1} \\times
    d(y,z_{ncn,1} ) $$ (3) where \\(d(y,z_{i}^{s} )\\) is the nearest centroid distance
    among test samples, \\(z_{i}^{s}\\) and \\(y\\). The multiplier product is higher
    or equal to 1 and the 1st centroid distance is \\(d(y,z_{ncn,1} )\\). Property
    2 The aKNCN method satisfies searching phase only when the entire sample class,
    \\(M_{i}\\), is found amongst \\(j\\) nearest neighbour and the whole samples
    per class to compete class is lesser than \\(M_{i} - 1\\). Then the property is
    defined as. $$ ( \\vee MCM_{i} (\\exists V_{wi} ) \\wedge (\\exists V_{wi}^{\\prime
    } ) $$ (4) \\(( \\vee MCM_{i} (x) = \\{ mcm_{x}^{y} |mcm_{x}^{y} \\in V\\}_{y
    = 1}^{j}\\) is \\(j\\) nearest neighbour of \\(V_{wi} = \\{ y_{y}^{i} |y_{y}^{i}
    \\in V\\}_{y = 1}^{{M_{i} }}\\) is a subset of \\(V\\) from \\(wi\\) with training
    samples, \\(M_{i}\\) and \\(V_{wi} ^{\\prime} = \\{ y_{y}^{i} |y_{y}^{i} \\in
    V\\}_{y = 1}^{{M_{i} ^{\\prime}}}\\) is a subset of \\(V^{\\prime}\\) from \\(wi\\)
    with training samples, \\(M_{i}\\). Finally, the soil quality is classified and
    the crop yield is predicted based on the classified properties for different classes.
    The yield prediction is performed using ELM, which is discussed in the next subsection.
    3.4 Tier 2-prediction In this phase, ELM is proposed to predict the crop yield
    based on the classified soil properties of different classes along with different
    parameters such as rainfall and temperature. In ELM, a new metaheuristic algorithm
    called mBOA is hybridized to tune the optimal set of ELM parameters such as thresholds
    and weights that enhance the performance accuracy with fast convergence. The optimizationmBOA
    is used to solve the convergence problems and provides robustness. ELM has learning
    speed and has a better generalization because there is no need to tune the initial
    parameters of the hidden layer. The hidden layer Feed Forward Network (FFN) is
    converted into the linear equation by minimum norm least squares. The aim of the
    ELM is to reduce the output norm weight and training error at the same time. For
    the samples \\(\\{ (Z_{i} ,T_{i} )|X_{i} \\in S^{m} ,T_{i} \\in S^{n} ,i = 1,2,
    \\ldots N\\}\\), the \\(P\\) neurons hidden layer with the output function is:
    $$ f_{P} (Z) = \\sum\\limits_{i = 1}^{P} {\\beta_{i} r} (Z) = r(Z)\\beta $$ (5)
    where \\(\\beta = [\\beta_{1} ,\\beta_{2} \\ldots \\ldots \\beta_{P} ]\\) is the
    output weight vector between output neuron and \\(P\\). The hidden layer output
    vector to the input \\(X\\) is given by $$ r(Z) = [r_{1} (Z),r_{2} (Z) \\ldots
    \\ldots r_{P} (Z)] $$ (6) For enhancing the generalization and to reduce the training
    error of neural networks, at the same time both output weight and the training
    error must be minimized. $$ \\min :||h\\beta - T||,\\,||\\beta || $$ (7) According
    to Karush–Kuhn–Tucker, the Eq. (19) can be written as $$ \\beta = h^{T} \\left(
    {\\frac{1}{R} + hh^{T} } \\right)^{ - 1} T $$ (8) where \\(h\\) is the output
    matrix of the hidden layer, \\(R\\) is the coefficient of the reflection and \\(T\\)
    is the expected samples and the ELM algorithm output function is $$ f(Z) = g(Z)h^{T}
    \\left( {\\frac{1}{R} + hh^{T} } \\right)^{ - 1} T $$ (9) When the feature mapping
    function \\(r(Z)\\) is unknown, ELM kernel matrix on the basis of Mercer’s condition
    is given by $$ M = hh^{T,} :m_{ij} = r(Z_{i} )r(Z_{j} ) = L(Z_{i} ,Z_{j} ) $$
    (10) The output function \\(g(Z)\\) on the basis of KOELM is given by $$ f(Z)
    = L(Z,Z_{1} ) \\ldots \\ldots L(Z,Z_{n} )]\\;\\left( {\\frac{1}{R} + M} \\right)^{
    - 1} T $$ (11) where \\(L(Z,Z_{1} )\\) and \\(M = hh^{T}\\) are the hidden neurons
    kernel function of single hidden layer FFN networks. The functions like polynomial
    kernel, exponential kernel, linear kernel and Gaussian kernel will satisfy the
    Mercer condition. BOA (Arora and Singh 2019) is a nature based metaheuristic approach
    which influences the behaviour of mating and foraging of butterfly. One of the
    major properties of BOA varies from other optimization approaches that are every
    butterfly has its separate scent. The fragrance is expressed as: $$ f_{r} = sI^{b}
    $$ (12) where \\(f_{r}\\) represents the identified magnitude of fragrance, \\(s\\)
    is modality of sensor and \\(I^{b}\\) represents stimulus intensity with absorption
    of fragrance. The value of \\(s\\) ranges from \\([0,\\infty ]\\) but the value
    is identified by a particularity of the optimization issues in the BOA iterative
    procedure. The \\(s\\) in the optimal solution of the method is expressed as $$
    s_{t + 1} = s_{t} + \\left[ {\\frac{0.025}{{c_{t} .T_{\\max } }}} \\right] $$
    (13) where \\(T_{\\max }\\) is the maximum iteration and initial value of \\(s\\)
    is 0.01. Further, there are two stages in the process, global search and local
    search space. The mathematical calculation of global search is calculated as $$
    x_{j}^{t + 1} = x_{j}^{t} + (r_{i}^{2} \\times g_{b} - x_{j}^{t} )f_{r} $$ (14)
    here \\(x_{j}^{t}\\) is the solution vector \\(x_{j}^{{}}\\) of the \\(j^{th}\\)
    butterfly in iteration \\(t\\) and \\(r_{i}\\) is a random number and rages from
    [0,1]. Then \\(g_{b}\\) is the present best solution identified among every stage
    in the present stage. Then the local search space is expressed as $$ x_{j}^{t
    + 1} = x_{j}^{t} + (r_{i}^{2} \\times x_{i}^{m} - x_{j}^{t} )f_{r} $$ (15) Here
    \\(x_{i}^{m}\\) and \\(x_{j}^{t}\\) are the \\(m{\\text{th}}\\) and \\(j{\\text{th}}\\)
    butterflies selected randomly and when \\(x_{i}^{m}\\) and \\(x_{j}^{t}\\) is
    considered under same iteration, that means butterflies becomes a local random
    walk. When \\(x_{i}^{m}\\) and \\(x_{j}^{t}\\) is not considered under same iteration
    random walk may diversify the solution. Both local search and global search for
    mating and food partner via the butterflies in nature can happen. Hence a switch
    probability is considered to transform the intensive local search and normal global
    search.It is seen from Eqs. (14) and (15) that choosing random local and global
    search will affect BOA is trapped by local optima. Further the parameter \\(r_{i}\\)
    capacity for adjusting local and global is limited. Therefore some modification
    is needed. Hence the new optimal solution is obtained by the following equations.
    Therefore the new equation for global search is calculated as: $$ x_{j}^{t + 1}
    = w.\\;x_{j}^{t} + (r_{i}^{2} \\times g_{b} - x_{j}^{t} )f_{r} $$ (16) The new
    equation for local search space is expressed as: $$ x_{j}^{t + 1} = (w - 1)\\;x_{j}^{t}
    + (r_{i}^{2} \\times x_{i}^{m} - x_{j}^{t} )f_{r} $$ (17) where w is a weighting
    coefficient. Comparing with Eqs. (14) and (15), the updated Eqs. (16) and (17)
    has the features like the weighting coefficient is and it is able to adjust among
    local and global search when compared to the original BOA. The best solution is
    updated either by Eqs. (16) or Eq. (17). These two equation provides better convergence
    speed because of the weighting coefficient. Further this model has better convergence
    speed and avoid local optima. Therefore this mBOA provides better results due
    to the optimal value. The Pseudo-code modified BOA is algorithm 1. Algorithm 1:
    Pseudo-code of mBOA 4 Experimental results and discussion This section gives the
    performance analysis and discussion about the developed scheme. The entire implementation
    has been processed on a system with 8 GB RAM and Intel Core i5 CPU with 3.0 GHz
    speed. To implement the proposed scheme, PYTHON 3.8 is utilized. The dataset taken
    in this paper for the experimentation is soil dataset. The developed approach
    performance is implemented with metrics like RMSE, R2, MSE, MedAE, MAE, MSLE,
    MAPE and EVS, error measures and accuracy are utilized for the performance evaluation.
    4.1 Comparative analysis of aKNCN-ELM-mBOA and existing approaches The performance
    of proposed aKNCN-ELM-mBOA is compared with the state of the art techniques like
    ELM, artificial neural network (ANN), support vector machine (SVM), gradient boost
    (GB) and random forest (RF). The simulation is performed on aKNCN -ELM-mBOA with
    these existing methods using the error metrics to determine the prediction efficiency
    of each method. Table 1 provides the analysis of error values attained by various
    approaches in terms of RMSE, MAE, MSLE, MAPE, MedAE, EVS and MSE. MSE is the mean
    of sum of the squared errors. MSLE is the squared logarithmic error’s predicted
    value. From the table, the MAE, MSE, RMSE, MSLE, MedAE and MAPE value obtained
    by the proposed aKNCN -ELM-mBOA is lower than the existing methods. While the
    R2 and EVS values attained by the proposed aKNCN -ELM-mBOA are higher than other
    strategies. Table 1 Error measures of various approaches Full size table Figure
    2 represents the accuracy measure for the proposed aKNCN-ELM-mBOA and the existing
    approaches. While considering the accuracy measure, the actual and the predicted
    data are nearly same then the system is said to be efficient for the crop yield
    prediction. It depicts the actual data and the predicted data of different techniques.
    From the graph, the proposed aKNCN-ELM-mBOA predicted the result more accurately
    than the existing methods. The proposed aKNCN-ELM-mBOA reached near to the actual
    data whereas the other techniques did not attain a better accuracy. AKNCN-GB achieved
    very low accuracy that other strategies. Therefore, the proposed aKNCN-ELM-mBOA
    is effective than the existing techniques. Fig. 2 Accuracy measure of proposed
    aKNCN -ELM-mBOA and existing methods Full size image Figure 3 illustrates the
    resultant graph of error measures for various approaches. From the graphical representation,
    the MAE of the aKNCN-ELM-mBOA is 0.064 and the MAE of the aKNCN -ELM-BOA, aKNCN
    –ELM, aKNC _ANN, aKNC-SVM, aKNC-GB and aKNC-RF are0.067, 0.097, 0.130, 0.165,
    0.231 and 0.293 respectively. Similarly the proposed model achieves the better
    value of MSLE and MedAE. In general, if the error occurred is less in the prediction
    system then it is considered as an effective model. Like this the proposed model
    achieved better achievement in all the cases. Thus the proposed method proves
    its achievement. Fig. 3 Graphical representation of various measures a MAE, MSLE
    and MedAE b RMSE, MSE and R2 c EVS and MAPE Full size image Table 2 presents the
    running time of the various approaches like aKNCN-ELM-mBOA, aKNCN -ELM-BOA, aKNCN
    –ELM, aKNC _ANN, aKNC-SVM, aKNC-GB and aKNC-RF. Comparing all the approaches,
    the running time of the proposed aKNCN-ELM-mBOA is found to be 58 ms. Further
    it takes only less time for completing the process. Hence it is proved that, this
    proposed methodology can be efficiently used in IoT based smart agriculture. Table
    2 Computation time analysis of the various approaches Full size table 5 Applications
    of the proposed methodology Agriculture based on IoT with ML is the next emerging
    thing in smart agriculture and farming. In several real life applications, IoT
    is involved. In smart agriculture, using various sensors can monitor the agricultural
    activities like plant and irrigation monitoring. Comparing to traditional farming
    methods, the farming based on IoT is much productive. IoT sensor systems require
    to be simple to use to facilitate farmer to take advantage of it. Figure 4 depicts
    the applications of the proposed methodology. Fig. 4 Applications of the proposed
    methodology Full size image Some of the applications of the proposed methodology
    are listed below: Plant management: The proposed ML model with IoT offers suitable
    and controllable environment to grow crops by greenhouse technology. Livestock
    monitoring: ML with IoT is used for collecting data with respect to location and
    health of cattle. This data is further used to identify the animal’s sick. This
    monitoring minimize the labouring cost and also prevents the diseases spread to
    other animals. Crop and yield: This ML model can be apply in farm lands on the
    basis of gathered data over IoT by yield monitoring gathered using GPS. It is
    also used in production of crops. Soil monitoring: Using wireless sensor nodes,
    the soil data can be obtained, then the obtained data can be given to this proposed
    ML algorithm for predicting and analysing the properties of soil and classifying
    the soil types. Disease monitoring: Combining this ML model with IoT is used for
    identifying and managing disease in farming lands. This methodology is further
    used for selecting proper pesticide for protecting crops from infections and hence
    minimize the work of farmers. Animal monitoring: The tracking of animals on the
    farming land is essential. Many researches are carried out to track animals with
    a help of IoT based sensors. ML model with IoT can overcome this problem. Sensing
    the animal’s presence can be identified by IoT sonsors. 6 Conclusion This work
    focuses on predicting the yield of the crop based on two-tier ML approach named
    aKNCN and ELM-mBOA. In the first tier, the proposed aKNCN model is used to estimate
    the soil quality based on IoT system collected soil nutrients. In the second tier,
    the soil quality score along with other crop yield related parameters like temperature
    and rainfall are taken as the input of ELM model to predict the crop yield. The
    hyper parameter tuning of ELM prediction model is achieved by mBOA to enhance
    the prediction performance of ELM. PYTHON tool is used for the implementation
    of proposed system. Soil dataset is utilized for performance evaluation of the
    proposed prediction model. The proposed scheme attains better results than the
    other classification models on the basis of accuracy, RMSE, R2, MSE, MedAE, MAE,
    MSLE, MAPE and EVS. The RMSE and MAE of the aKNCN-ELM-mBOA is found to be 0.301
    and 0.064 respectively. Presently, the ML models overcome the problems in smart
    agriculture in numerous way, however this ML-IoT requires continuous internet
    connection and the developing countries does not have this requirement. Further,
    this model requires large amount of training data and also it is very complex
    for planning, building and managing the broad technology to IoT. In future, analysis
    based on time-series will be done to predict the future values. The use of different
    parameters like soil nutrients, soil quality, irrigated area and agricultural
    points can be used to extend the scope of the research as well as improve the
    accuracy of the system. In addition, deep learning based smart agriculture can
    be used with the IoT system in order to enhance the production quality. References

    Preview 1. Introduction It’s very difficult for you to check out any sector of
    the economy without noticing the use of drones. Drones are employed in the agricultural
    industry for a wide range of duties, including spraying fertilizer, aerial surveillance,
    crop monitoring, land inspection, mapping, looking for damaged or rotting crops,
    and many others. The potential of different drone types in farming, agriculture,
    and gardening is being investigated. Drones like quad copters are the greatest
    option for crop fertilization because of their multi-rotor design. The massive
    construction of fixed-wing drones, which requires a large landing area, makes
    them impractical for agricultural fertilization. Some reports revealed that they
    expect the drone industry in the agricultural sector to grow from USD1.2 billion
    in 2019 to a whopping USD4.8 billion in 2024. All data obtained by the drones
    in farmlands is mostly used to make better agronomic decisions, which makes it
    part of the “precision agriculture” sector. Large-scale precision farming operations
    have become increasingly dependent on the usage of drones in a number of regions.
    Farmers may plan planting and treatment strategies to produce the best harvest
    possible using the information obtained from the drones'' recordings. According
    to some reports, using precision farming technologies has the potential to boost
    yields by up to 5%, which is a substantial increase in a market with narrow profit
    margins. One of the most popular uses of drones in agriculture is their swift
    movement to their desired locations. Drones with this skill can apply fertilizer
    and insecticides to crops to hydrate and provide them with the nutrients they
    need. Such additives can help crops thrive and stay healthy. To prevent worms,
    pests, and insects and prolong crop life, drone commanders have complete control
    over the drone spraying nutrients. Powerful drone capabilities help with the time-consuming
    procedure of evaluating the soil''s health. The character and health of the soil
    may be monitored, modified, and maintained using UAVs, which collect and analyze
    data from monitoring systems. The soil can benefit from drone technology by receiving
    the nutrients it needs to become healthier. Through data processing and 3D mapping,
    drones carry out the role of monitoring the condition of the soil. Agriculture
    is by definition a labor-intensive and time-consuming sector because it requires
    a high level of skill to do its tasks. Particularly seeding requires human labor
    because it is a lengthy procedure. To make this strenuous operation easier, drone
    technology is employed to sow the seeds of several crop species. They can quickly
    and efficiently plant seeds thanks to the drones'' built-in lasers, sensors, tanks,
    and other functions. Drones'' great ability to evaluate, diagnose, and survey
    crops for any deficiencies is another fantastic benefit of employing them to fertilize
    crops. Their laser-equipped sensors and high-resolution cameras help with the
    quick completion of a variety of activities. These defects are also mapped in
    real-time by unmanned aerial vehicles, and crop management decisions can be made
    using the data that is gathered and processed. In general, the time-consuming
    procedure of agricultural fertilization has been made easier thanks to drones
    and their applications. Farmers benefit immensely from their entrepreneurism and
    strong personalities for a variety of tasks and operations. The time-consuming
    procedure of agricultural fertilization in general has been made simpler by drones
    and their applications. Farmers benefit immensely from their strong will and entrepreneurial
    spirit in a wide range of tasks and operations. For one thing, drones are excellent
    for monitoring and sensing methods since they can swiftly cover a region to examine
    crop development and soil health. The majority of drones are utilized for this
    because their sensors can identify the absorbance of a particular wavelength,
    producing a color contrast image that clearly depicts potentially problematic
    areas. Ranchers have used drones to track cattle on ranches and inspect fences
    for damage, proving that this monitoring capability does more than just enable
    quick processing of spatiotemporal data. To further monitor livestock, rangers
    have also used night cameras and thermal imagers to find any animals disrupting
    or attacking herds. Continue Reading References Follow Reference Abdullahi, H.

  key_findings: UAVs have the potential to revolutionize agriculture by providing
    farmers with real-time data and insights into their crops and fields. They can
    be used to monitor crop health, identify pests and diseases, and apply pesticides
    and fertilizers more precisely. UAVs can also be used to collect data on soil
    conditions and water usage, which can help farmers optimize their irrigation systems.
    As UAV technology continues to develop, it is likely that their applications in
    agriculture will continue to grow.
  limitations: The paper does not provide specific details on the methods used for
    data preprocessing and outlier detection in real-time insight generation.
  main_objective: To review the applications of UAVs in agriculture and highlight
    their potential benefits for crop monitoring, soil analysis, weed control, livestock
    management, and water management.
  relevance_evaluation: The paper is highly relevant to the point in the literature
    review that focuses on strategies for handling data heterogeneity, uncertainty,
    and quality issues in real-time insight generation, such as data preprocessing
    and outlier detection. It discusses how UAVs can be utilized for real-time data
    collection in agriculture, which involves handling various types of data, including
    imagery, spectral data, and environmental data. The paper highlights the importance
    of data quality in generating actionable insights and provides insights into methods
    for addressing data heterogeneity, uncertainty, and quality issues. It also mentions
    the use of machine learning algorithms for processing drone-collected data, which
    aligns with the focus of the literature review section on the importance of interpretability
    and explainability in ML models for real-time irrigation management.

  data_sources: Field data on 75 boreholes collected by Arba Minch Water Technology
    Institute (AWTI) in 2007; Elevation, soil type, meteorological variables (precipitation,
    specific humidity, wind speed, and land surface temperature), and vegetation (NDVI)
    for three seasons from October 2005 to September 2007.
  description: Predicting groundwater levels is challenging, especially in regions
    of water scarcity where data availability is often limited. However, these regions
    have substantial water needs and require cost-effective groundwater utilization
    strategies. This study uses artificial intelligence to predict groundwater levels
    to provide guidance for drilling shallow boreholes for subsistence irrigation.
    The Bilate watershed, located 80 km north of Arba Minch in southern Ethiopia and
    covering just over 5250 km2, was selected as the study area. Bilate is typical
    of areas in Africa with high demand for water and limited availability of well
    data. Using a non-time series database of 75 boreholes, machine learning models,
    including multiple linear regression, multivariate adaptive regression splines,
    artificial neural networks, random forest regression, and gradient boosting regression
    (GBR), were constructed to predict the depth to the water table. The study considered
    20 independent variables, including elevation, soil type, and seasonal data (spanning
    three seasons) for precipitation, specific humidity, wind speed, land surface
    temperature during day and night, and Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI).
    GBR performed the best of the approaches, with an average 0.77 R-squared value
    and a 19 m median absolute error on testing data. Finally, a map of predicted
    water levels in the Bilate watershed was created based on the best model, with
    water levels ranging from 1.6 to 245.9 m. With the limited set of borehole data,
    the results show a clear signal that can provide guidance for borehole drilling
    decisions for sustainable irrigation with additional implications for drinking
    water.
  doi: 10.3390/w15193473
  explanation: The paper aims to predict groundwater levels using machine learning
    algorithms in areas with limited data availability and where manual intervention
    for irrigation management is not feasible. The specific point in the review that
    this paper relates to is the importance of handling data heterogeneity, uncertainty,
    and quality issues in real-time insight generation.
  extract_1: '"In this study, the dependent variable is the static water level. Field
    data on 75 boreholes were collected by Arba Minch Water Technology Institute (AWTI)
    in 2007. Although the dataset was collected fifteen years ago, changes in static
    water level during the intervening years would have very little impact on our
    analysis. Any change would likely be within a few centimeters, which is small
    in relation to the accuracy of our analysis. Therefore, the existing historical
    dataset is useful to demonstrate the value of machine learning for predicting
    water levels."'
  extract_2: The results of these approaches should be considered complementary rather
    than contradictory. Using a combination of methods allows for a more robust and
    comprehensive understanding of variable importance, leading to a more reliable
    model.

    Predicting groundwater levels is challenging, especially in regions of water scarcity
    where data availability is often limited. However, these regions have substantial
    water needs and require cost-effective groundwater utilization strategies. This
    study uses artificial intelligence to predict groundwater levels to provide guidance
    for drilling shallow boreholes for subsistence irrigation. The Bilate watershed,
    located 80 km north of Arba Minch in southern Ethiopia and covering just over
    5250 km2, was selected as the study area. Bilate is typical of areas in Africa
    with high demand for water and limited availability of well data. Using a non-time
    series database of 75 boreholes, machine learning models, including multiple linear
    regression, multivariate adaptive regression splines, artificial neural networks,
    random forest regression, and gradient boosting regression (GBR), were constructed
    to predict the depth to the water table. The study considered 20 independent variables,
    including elevation, soil type, and seasonal data (spanning three seasons) for
    precipitation, specific humidity, wind speed, land surface temperature during
    day and night, and Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI). GBR performed
    the best of the approaches, with an average 0.77 R-squared value and a 19 m median
    absolute error on testing data. Finally, a map of predicted water levels in the
    Bilate watershed was created based on the best model, with water levels ranging
    from 1.6 to 245.9 m. With the limited set of borehole data, the results show a
    clear signal that can provide guidance for borehole drilling decisions for sustainable
    irrigation with additional implications for drinking water. Keywords: machine

    Ethiopia is one of the countries in East Africa that is threatened by water scarcity.
    In Ethiopia, rainfed agriculture and small farming predominate. A recent study
    showed that around 95% of the agricultural areas in Ethiopia are rainfed areas
    [1]. A Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) study [2] showed that small farming
    families make up 72% of the total population. In total, 74% of Ethiopia’s farmers
    come from small farming families, and 67% of these live below the national poverty
    line. About 75% of farmland is devoted to cereals. Maize and wheat dominate, complemented
    by teff, barley, sorghum, and rice. Drought is a major stressor that reduces cereal
    yields. Moreover, climate change has induced significant and erratic deviations
    in rainfall patterns over the year and across the country, significantly reducing
    crop yields overall, especially cereals [3]. To mitigate the impact of water stress
    and reduce hunger, utilizing groundwater by drilling wells for irrigation is a
    potential solution to address the problem of increasingly erratic rainfall. Predictions
    of groundwater level, or the depth to water table, could support decisions on
    where to drill wells to extract groundwater. Artificial intelligence (AI) has
    been widely used to predict both the surface [4,5,6,7,8,9,10] and groundwater
    [11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21] levels globally. Regarding surface water level
    prediction, Khan and Coulibaly [4] used a Support Vector Machine (SVM) to examine
    the long-term water level in Lake Erie in North America based on mean monthly
    water level data from 1918 to 2001. The authors compared SVM with a multilayer
    perceptron (MLP) and with a conventional multiplicative seasonal autoregressive
    model. They found that the SVM outperformed the other two models with an overall
    RMSE of less than 0.25 m. Liang et al. [5] applied SVM and a deep learning model
    based on a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network to predict daily surface water
    levels in Dongting Lake in China. They found that the LSTM has better accuracy
    than the SVM model with less than 0.1 m RMSE. A river water level study performed
    by Chen and Qiao in 2021 [6] also confirms that LSTM has good performance in predicting
    surface water levels. Choi et al. [7] used four machine learning algorithms, including
    artificial neural networks (ANN), decision tree, random forest (RF), and SVM based
    on the daily water level from 2009 to 2013, to predict water levels from 2013
    to 2015 in Upo wetlands, South Korea. They found that random forest outperformed
    the other three algorithms, with a 0.09 RMSE. Regarding groundwater level prediction,
    in 2013, Sahoo and Jha [11] constructed seventeen site-specific AI models to predict
    groundwater levels in Japan. Compared to multiple linear regression (MLR) models,
    ANN-predicted groundwater levels have a better agreement with RMSE values, ranging
    from 0.04 to 0.4 m for 17 sites. Sahoo et al. [12] developed a modeling framework
    using Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) network architecture to simulate groundwater
    level changes in two agricultural regions in the US. They found ANN performed
    better than the MLR and multivariate nonlinear regression model with RMSE less
    than 2 m for both the agricultural regions. Zhang et al. [13] developed a new
    model based on LSTM to predict groundwater levels, which outperformed feed-forward
    neural networks and double LSTM with a 0.14 m RMSE. In 2021, Liu et al. [14] applied
    SVM combined with the data assimilation (DA) technique for predicting changes
    in groundwater level. The researchers predicted the change in groundwater levels
    at 1- to 3-month time scales for 46 wells located in the northeast United States
    and found that both the SVM and SVM with DA can adequately predict groundwater
    levels with RMSE less than 4 m. Hikouei et al. [15] demonstrated that Extreme
    Gradient Boosting exhibited superior performance over the RF model for predicting
    groundwater levels in the tropical peatlands of Indonesia. Many recent studies
    employed wavelet-transformed analysis [16,17] and hybrid AI techniques [18,19],
    which had good performance in groundwater level prediction using time series data.
    Missing values in groundwater level time series datasets are a frequent occurrence,
    presenting challenges for accurate forecasting. To address this data gap, previous
    studies have utilized machine learning frameworks to estimate the missing values
    in groundwater level data, resulting in enhanced prediction reliability [22,23].
    Overall, these groundwater level studies provide valuable insights into groundwater
    dynamics and contribute to more effective resource management. Most of these studies
    that use machine learning algorithms employed a large amount of time series data
    to predict future water levels for lakes [4,5,8], rivers [6,9,10], wetlands [7],
    basins [11,17,19], regions [13,16,18,20], aquifers [12], and watersheds [14,21].
    These models generally have good performance with low mean square errors in predictions
    of water levels. These studies were conducted in regions with high data availability
    on both the time series of water level data and climate variables. Even when missing
    values occurred, extensive data availability greatly facilitated the estimation
    of data gaps [22,23]. However, in many regions of interest, a large amount of
    time series of water level data are unlikely to be available due to the high cost
    of data collection for local governments or organizations. Many water scarcity
    areas have a great need for groundwater development for sustainable irrigation,
    although the lack of good data can make models perform poorly. To the best of
    our knowledge, there is no research on groundwater level prediction using machine
    learning based on non-time series data in rainfed agricultural regions. It is
    much more difficult to predict water levels accurately in the absence of time
    series data because previous water level is a strong predictor of current water
    level. The objective of this study is to use AI to identify suitable drilling
    locations for sustainable irrigation for subsistence agriculture in water scarcity
    regions using sparse non-time series data on existing wells. To achieve this objective,
    five machine learning models were constructed to predict groundwater levels. These
    include MLR, multivariate adaptive regression splines (MARS), ANN, random forest
    regression (RFR), and gradient boosting regression (GBR). The models were developed
    using data from 75 existing boreholes in the Bilate watershed in southern Ethiopia.
    The best-performing model was used to predict the groundwater level for hundreds
    of thousands of grid points covering the Bilate region. Finally, a map of predicted
    water levels was created to provide guidance for decision-making on drilling locations
    for local individuals and organizations. Figure 1 shows the workflow of this study.
    Figure 1. The workflow of this study. The rest of the paper is organized as follows.
    Section 2 describes the study area, data sources, and methodology used in this
    study; Section 3 shows the main results from each of the machine learning models;
    Section 4 provides a discussion of the results; and Section 5 concludes the paper.
    2. Materials and Methods 2.1. Study Area The Bilate watershed is located in southeastern
    Ethiopia at latitude 6°34′ to 8°6′ N and longitude 37°46′ to 38°18′ E. The total
    area is 5276.25 km2. Bilate is one of the largest watersheds in the Ethiopia Rift
    Valley Basin [24,25]. Elevation of the region ranges from 1194 m to 3216 m, as
    shown in Figure 2. The Bilate region was classified as a three-season climate
    type, with major rains from June to September, dry season from October to January,
    and minor rains from February to May [26,27]. In Bilate, the minor rains typically
    start in March. However, for our analysis, we adhered to the general classification,
    commencing from February, as referenced in [24,25]. The annual average precipitation
    within the Bilate watershed spans from 769 mm in lower regions to 1339 mm in the
    highlands. Meanwhile, the mean annual temperature fluctuates between 11 °C and
    22 °C in Hossana, situated upstream, and ranges from 16 °C to 30 °C at Bilate
    Tena, the lower stream of the watershed [24]. The vegetation density in Bilate
    can be generally described as sparse to dense vegetation in the minor and major
    rainy seasons, and sparse vegetation in the dry season. Land in the region is
    mainly cultivated, grassland, plantation, shrubland, and wetland. The northern
    and western parts of the study area are mountainous, whereas the southern and
    eastern parts are lowlands. Distributed lakes in the study area indicate the presence
    of shallow groundwater. Pyroclastic and volcano-sedimentary rocks are dominant
    outcrops in the study area. The productivity of the aquifers varies from moderately
    productive to highly productive with an average transmissivity range between 1.03
    × 10−5 and 2.78 × 10−1 m/s2 [28]. Figure 2. Bilate watershed (pink region on the
    lower left plot) belongs to a basin called Rift Valley (light green basin on the
    upper left plot). The map of Bilate watershed with boreholes and elevation [29]
    is shown on the right. 2.2. Data Description In this study, the dependent variable
    is the static water level. Field data on 75 boreholes were collected by Arba Minch
    Water Technology Institute (AWTI) in 2007 [30]. Although the dataset was collected
    fifteen years ago, changes in static water level during the intervening years
    would have very little impact on our analysis. Any change would likely be within
    a few centimeters, which is small in relation to the accuracy of our analysis.
    Therefore, the existing historical dataset is useful to demonstrate the value
    of machine learning for predicting water levels. Initially, we explored a broader
    range of variables, identifying a subset that demonstrated greater influence on
    our predictions. The method we employed for feature selection involved a synergistic
    approach that combined domain expertise—where we incorporated factors known to
    be critical in our field—with a backward stepwise feature selection using random
    forest regression, which iteratively removed the least significant variables based
    on mean square error criteria on the out-of-bag samples. This directed our attention
    towards incorporating this subset, resulting in the consideration of twenty independent
    variables for our modeling and analysis. These included elevation, soil type,
    meteorological variables (i.e., precipitation, specific humidity, wind speed,
    and land surface temperature (LST) at day and night time) and vegetation (i.e.,
    NDVI) for the three seasons from October 2005 to September 2007. We chose to use
    data from a time period that closely aligned with when the static water level
    was measured. We had the coordinates for each of the 75 boreholes and have extracted
    the values for each variable from the raw dataset. Given that the resolution varied
    for different independent variables, borehole points that were close to each other
    might have the same extracted value, particularly for predictors with sparse resolution.
    Details on the sources of the dependent and independent variables are summarized
    in Table 1 and Table 2. Table 1. Summary of data sources. Table 2. Description
    of dependent and independent variables. Nearly all the borehole points in the
    data set are located in areas categorized as cultivation or grassland. As mentioned,
    the purpose of this study is to predict groundwater levels to support decision-making
    on the optimal borehole drilling locations for agricultural irrigation. Based
    on the local conditions, it is unusual to place a borehole in a forest, wetland,
    or shrubland. For this reason, only observations in cultivated and grassland areas
    were included in the training and testing data sets, and the model does not predict
    groundwater levels for the forest, wetland, and shrubland. Machine learning models
    were built using a training dataset consisting of 63 randomly selected observations.
    Performance was then evaluated on a testing set made up of the remaining 12 observations.
    Each algorithm was subjected to fifteen individual experiments. For MLR and MARS,
    models were constructed based on fifteen diverse and randomly selected training
    sets. For ANN, RFR, and GBR, five different random data separations were used,
    and three experiments were carried out for each training dataset. Performing a
    variety of experiments is important to verify the model’s ability to effectively
    generalize to unseen data. This paper mainly presents and discusses models with
    median performance. The model comparisons are based on consistent training and
    testing data separations across all algorithms. The average performance scores
    from the fifteen experiments are also reported, providing a comprehensive understanding
    of each model’s effectiveness. To predict groundwater levels for a larger area
    in the Bilate region, we generated a grid with a resolution 100 m × 100 m that
    covered the Bilate region. The data for twenty independent variables for each
    grid point were prepared and processed in the same manner as for the original
    dataset of 75 boreholes. As the resolution of the grid points was relatively high,
    grid points that fell within the same spatial resolution unit of a variable would
    have identical extracted values. The primary software tools used for data preparation
    and visualization were QGIS 3.24.1 [37] and R 4.1.3 [38]. 2.3. Resampling Methods
    2.3.1. Leave-One-Out Cross-Validation Cross-validation (CV) is a resampling technique
    to check the generalization ability of a model on a limited sample. The k-fold
    CV method randomly divides the observations into k groups/folds of approximately
    equal size [39]. The first fold is used as the validation set. The remaining folds
    are used to fit a model. This process repeats k times, and a different fold is
    used as the validation set each time. The CV estimate is finally computed as the
    average of the mean square error on each validation set. Leave-one-out CV (LOOCV)
    is a special case of cross-validation, where k is the number of samples [39].
    In LOOCV, the model is fit based on the entire dataset with one observation excluded.
    Next, the fitted model is used to predict the one observation that was left out.
    Then, the process is repeated n times, leaving out a different observation each
    time, where n is the number of observations in the data set. As the dataset is
    small, we performed LOOCV across the machine learning models in this study. 2.3.2.
    Bootstrapping Bootstrapping is a resampling method that randomly samples values
    with replacements. It is mainly employed in the construction of RFR models. In
    the context of RFR, each decision tree within the forest is trained on a distinct
    dataset, generated by bootstrapping the original training set. This ensures each
    dataset is of the same size as the original, but composed of a subset of the original
    data, with some samples likely repeated. This process introduces randomness into
    the model-building phase, which aids in preventing overfitting and improves model
    robustness by ensuring that each individual tree within the forest learns from
    a slightly different sample of the data. 2.4. Machine Learning Algorithms Machine
    learning is a branch of AI focused on building systems that learn from data. It
    has been widely applied in science and engineering. Application areas include
    hydrogeology [11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,40], cyber security [41,42],
    transportation [43,44], and aerospace engineering [45,46,47]. By identifying patterns
    in data, the computer can learn a decision rule from data without explicit programming.
    Over time, with more data, machine learning models can make increasingly accurate
    predictions or decisions. 2.4.1. Multiple Linear Regression A multiple linear
    regression model [48] was built to identify factors that affected the groundwater
    level and, therefore, to estimate the groundwater level. The general form of a
    linear regression model was defined as: f(X)= β 0 + ∑ j=1 p X j β j , (1) where
    β 0 is the intercept; β 1 , β 2 ,…, β p are the coefficients; and X 1 , X 2 ,…,
    X p are the predictors. The coefficients β 0 , β 2 ,…, β p are estimated from
    the training data to optimize a measure of fit, typically the sum of squared residuals.
    2.4.2. Multivariate Adaptive Regression Spline MARS is a nonparametric regression
    method that creates a piece-wise linear model so that the relationship between
    the predictor and the response can be different for different ranges of predictors
    [49]. The model begins with a simple constant model and iteratively adds basis
    functions that best reduce the sum of squared residuals. The basis functions are
    created using hinge functions that form piecewise linear relationships. A hinge
    function takes a single variable and a constant as input, returning the difference
    between the variable and the constant when the variable is greater than the constant,
    and zero otherwise. For a cut point a, a pair of hinge functions are defined as:
    h(x−a)={x−a if x>a,0 otherwise} h(a−x)={a−x if x<a,0 otherwise}, (2) where x is
    a given variable. Each time a pair of basis functions is added, the model chooses
    the variable and the constant that minimize the residual sum of squares (RSS).
    In order to control overfitting, MARS then performs a backward deletion process.
    It removes basis functions that contribute the least to the model’s predictive
    power based on the generalized cross-validation (GCV) score or Akaike Information
    Criterion (AIC) score. The backward pass prunes the model by eliminating the terms
    one by one until the best subset is found for the model. The one with the lowest
    GCV or AIC score is usually chosen as the final model. 2.4.3. Artificial Neural
    Networks ANN is a machine-learning model inspired by the neural structure of the
    brain. An ANN model transforms inputs into outputs through a series of hidden
    layers to an output layer. For a regression model with a single hidden layer,
    the form of the ANN model [50] is defined as: p(y│x,θ)=N(y│ w T z(x), σ 2 ) z(x)=g(Vx)=[g(
    v T 1 x),…,g( v T H x)], (3) where g is a non-linear activation function; z(x)
    is the hidden layer, which is a deterministic function of the input; H is the
    number of hidden units; V is the weight matrix from the inputs to the hidden nodes;
    and w is the weight vector from the hidden nodes to the output. Figure 3 shows
    a simple neural network with only one hidden layer. The weights are typically
    estimated through an iterative procedure that finds a local minimum of a goodness
    of fit measure, typically the sum of squared residuals. Figure 3. A simple neural
    network with one hidden layer [50]. 2.4.4. Random Forest Regression The random
    forest regression algorithm, proposed by Breiman in 2001, is a supervised learning
    algorithm that produces a forecast based on many decision trees [51]. Each tree
    is built based on a bootstrap sample of the training data. At each decision node
    of each tree, the best split is chosen among the number of randomly selected predictors.
    The splitting process terminates at a leaf node when a termination criterion is
    met. To make a prediction at a point, the tree is traversed to find the leaf node
    corresponding to the independent variables corresponding to the point, and the
    dependent variables for the data points at the leaf nodes are averaged [52]. This
    procedure, creating decision trees based on different bootstrap samples and then
    averaging the predictions from all the trees, is called bootstrap aggregation,
    or bagging. The bagging technique in the RFR model tends to reduce the variance
    of predictions, but a bias still exists. Specifically, as the prediction is the
    average of the output from all leaf nodes, observations with small values tend
    to be overestimated and those with large values tend to be underestimated. This
    tendency to bias has been identified in previous studies [53,54]. Our results
    showed a bias in the initial RFR model. To correct the bias, a post-processing
    bias-correcting transformation to the RFR predictions was made [54]. For the linear
    transformation, a linear regression model was fitted to find the intercept (β0)
    and slope (β1) of the transformed prediction: f(ŷ) = β0 + β1 × ŷ (4) where ŷ is
    the predicted response value by the initial random forest model on training data;
    β0 is the coefficient for the intercept, and β1 is the coefficient for ŷ. The
    objective is to find the parameters that minimize the mean square error: min β
    0 , β 1 1/n∗∑ (f( ŷ i )− y i ) 2 (5) 2.4.5. Gradient Boosting Regression Gradient
    boosting regression (GBR) is an ensemble learning algorithm that combines multiple
    weak prediction models, typically decision trees, to create a strong predictive
    model. Initially, the ensemble is empty. The model starts with an initial prediction,
    typically the mean of the response variable. The difference between the observed
    values and the initial prediction, known as the residuals, is calculated. These
    residuals represent the errors that the model needs to correct. Then, a decision
    tree is trained to predict the residuals. The tree is constructed to minimize
    a specific loss function using gradient descent optimization. The loss function
    we used in this study is defined as: L( y i ,f( x i ))= ∑ 𝑛 𝑖=1 1 2 ( y i −f(
    x i )) 2 (6) where y i is the ith observed value; f( x i ) is the predicted response
    value; and n is the number of observations. Next, the predictions from the decision
    tree are combined with the current ensemble’s predictions to obtain an updated
    prediction. This updated prediction is added to the ensemble. Then, the residuals
    are recalculated using the updated predictions. The new residuals represent the
    errors that were not captured by the current ensemble. The process continues for
    a specified number of iterations or until a certain stopping criterion is met.
    The final prediction is obtained by summing the predictions from the entire ensemble.
    By iteratively correcting the errors of the previous models, gradient boosting
    regression is able to learn complex relationships and improve predictive accuracy.
    2.5. Evaluation Metrics The evaluation metrics presented in this paper include
    mutual information (MI), root mean square error (RMSE), median absolute error
    (MAE), and R-squared. In the definitions below, y i denotes the i th observed
    value; y ̂ i denotes the i th predicted value; and y      denotes the mean
    of the observed values. MI measures the degree of relatedness between the datasets
    [55]. A higher MI value shows that the dependent variable (y) has higher relatedness
    to the corresponding independent variable (x). MI(Y;X)= ∑ 𝑥∈𝑋 ∑ 𝑦∈𝑌 p(x,y)log(
    p(x,y) p(x)p(y) ), (7) where p(x, y) represents the joint probability function
    of x and y; p(x) and p(y) are the marginal probability functions of x and y, respectively.
    RMSE describes how far the predictions deviate from the actual values. A small
    RMSE represents a good performance of the model. RMSE= ∑ n i=1 ( y i − y ̂ i )
    2 n − − − − − − − − − − − − − √ (8) MAE measures the median of absolute errors
    between the predicted and observed values. Similar to RMSE, it is also used to
    describe how well the data fit the model. MAE=Median(| y ̂ i − y i |) (9) R-squared
    represents how much variation for a dependent variable is explained by an independent
    variable. R 2 =1− ∑ n i=1 ( y i − y ̂ i ) 2 ∑ n i=1 ( y i − y      ) 2 ,
    (10) 3. Results In this section, we detail the mutual information analysis and
    outcomes from all the implemented methods. We primarily focus on results from
    one training and testing data partition used consistently across all methods.
    This training and testing split was chosen because it yielded close to median
    performance across all models. For the ANN, RFR, and GBR methods, three experiments
    were conducted for each data partition; of these, the models with median performance
    were selected. Primary results associated with all algorithms include plots of
    residuals versus predicted values and observed versus predicted values for both
    training and testing data. Furthermore, tables are presented summarizing the performance
    metrics of the models. These include results based on a single experiment with
    median performance, as well as average scores across the fifteen experiments.
    3.1. Mutual Information Analysis A zero MI value indicates no mutual dependence
    or relatedness between the specific independent variable and the static water
    level. A larger MI value represents a stronger relatedness. Figure 4 shows that
    the variables precipitation Oct to Jan (X3), precipitation Jun to Aug (X5), and
    specific humidity Jun to Sep (X8) have relatively stronger relatedness to static
    water level. On the other hand, Wind speed Oct to Jan (X9), Wind speed Jun to
    Sep (X11), and NDVI Feb to May (X19) showed weaker relatedness. The soil type
    (X2) is removed from the mutual information analysis because it is a categorical
    variable. Figure 4. Mutual information between independent variables and the dependent
    variable. 3.2. Multiple Linear Regression Before building the MLR, highly correlated
    predictors were removed. If a pair of predictors have a correlation equal to or
    greater than 0.85, the R function findCorrelation() randomly picks one predictor
    to remove. The remaining predictors include soil type (X2), precipitation (X3–5),
    wind speed from Feb to May (X10), LST at daytime from Feb to May (X13), LST at
    nighttime from Oct to Jan (X15), NDVI from Feb to May (X19), and NDVI from Jun
    to Sep (X20). Table 3 shows the predictors remaining after removal along with
    their coefficients. We found the factors, including the euric vertisols soil type
    (X2) and NDVI from Jun to Sep (X20), had a significant relationship with the static
    water level at a 0.05 significance level. Table 3. Summary of MLR. To examine
    the normality assumption of a linear regression model, we created a Quantile–Quantile
    (Q–Q) plot and a residual plot. The Q–Q plot shown in Figure 5 shows that the
    points are approximately distributed along the line with light upper and lower
    tails. No evident pattern was found on the residual plot (Figure 6a). We also
    performed a Shapiro–Wilk normality test on residuals with the null hypothesis
    that the residuals are normally distributed. The p-value is approximately 0.51,
    which is much greater than the conventional 0.05 level for statistical significance;
    therefore, the null hypothesis of normality cannot be rejected. The model performance
    results are shown in Table 4 and Table 5 and will be discussed in Section 4.2.

    based on one experiment with median performance. Table 5. Average model performance
    score based on multiple experiments for each model. 3.3. Multivariate Adaptive
    Regression Spline Similar to MLR, we built a MARS model using the training data.
    The hyperparameters tuned for the MARS model included the interaction complexity
    (degree) and the number of terms to retain in the final model (nprune). We evaluated
    the degree from 1 to 3 and nprune values from 2 to 20. The final settings for
    the degree and nprune were 3 and 8, respectively. The MARS model was built with
    a backward elimination feature selection process. The backward pass prunes the
    model by eliminating the terms one by one until the best subset is found for the
    model. The generalized cross-validation (GCV) criterion was used to evaluate each
    subset and was also considered as the variable importance measure. Figure 7 shows
    that the first three most important variables include LST daytime from Feb to
    May (X13), precipitation from Feb to May (X4), and wind speed from Oct to Jan
    (X9). Soil type (X2) eutric vertisols has an importance value of zero indicating
    that this predictor did not contribute to the predictive power of the model and
    was never used in any of the MARS basis functions in the pruned final model. Figure
    7. Variable importance plots: (a) MARS; (b) RFR; (c) GBR. Even though MARS, being
    a nonparametric technique, does not assume linearity and homoscedasticity, the
    residual plot can still provide valuable diagnostic information about how well
    the model fits the data. Figure 6 shows that the residuals are randomly scattered
    around zero, indicating that the variance of the error is approximately constant
    across all levels of the independent variables. This is a desirable property.
    3.4. Artificial Neural Networks The training of the ANN model was executed using
    the nnet and caret packages in R. The nnet package is designed to support a single
    hidden layer sandwiched between the input and output layers. In the preprocessing
    stage, the model is set to center and scale predictors, which is a common strategy
    to normalize variable scales. Suited to regression tasks, the output layer of
    the neural network uses a linear activation function. The model incorporates key
    hyperparameters, such as weight decay for regularization, and the size, which
    determines the number of nodes in the hidden layer. We set the range for ‘size’
    from 1 to 10, and evaluated the ‘weight decay’ at 0, 0.01, and 0.1. After the
    tuning and training process, the model identified optimal hyperparameters: a decay
    value of 0.1 and a size of 10. A residual plot was generated to check the assumption
    of homoscedasticity. As shown in Figure 6, the residuals were distributed randomly,
    suggesting that the assumption of the constant variance of errors is reasonable.
    3.5. Random Forest Regression The RFR model was trained using the randomForest
    package in R based on the training dataset, applying LOOCV as the resampling method.
    The hyperparameters for the RFR model included the number of randomly selected
    predictors at each split (mtry), the node size, and the number of trees (ntree).
    These hyperparameters were collectively tuned within a for loop. For mtry, a grid
    range of 1 to 10 was set and fine-tuned using the ‘caret’ package, whereas the
    node size was assessed at 5, 6, and 7, and the ntree parameter was evaluated between
    50 and 200. Following this comprehensive grid search, the optimal settings were
    found to be an mtry value of 8, a node size of 5, and a ntree value of 60. To
    assess the importance of the predictors, a variable importance plot was generated,
    revealing LST at daytime from Feb to May (X13), NDVI from Jun to Sep (X20), and
    precipitation from Feb to May (X4) to be of higher importance compared to the
    other variables, as depicted in Figure 7. In response to the inherent bias of
    the RFR model, as detailed in Section 2.4.4, we employed a post-processing step
    to correct for this bias. This involved applying a linear transformation to the
    RFR predictions. Specifically, we fitted a linear regression model with the predicted
    water level from the initial RFR model as the independent variable and the actual
    water level as the dependent variable. The parameters of the transformation were
    estimated on the training sample. The estimated coefficients for the intercept
    (β0) and predicted water level variable (β1) were −29.65 and 1.3, respectively.
    Comparing the residual plot for the original RFR model and the post-processed
    model, we see that the bias of the original RFR model has been mitigated. 3.6.
    Gradient Boosting Regression GBR was constructed using gbm package in R. The hyperparameters
    such as the minimum number of observations in a node required for a split (n.minobsinnode),
    the boosting model’s complexity (interaction.depth), the number of iterations,
    and the learning rate were optimized via grid search. We assessed n.minobsinnode
    at values of 5 and 10, interaction.depth within a range of 1 to 3, iterations
    at 50, 70, 100, and 120, and learning rates at 0.1 and 0.01. The final optimal
    hyperparameters, which led to the best model performance, were 5, 2, 100, and
    0.1, respectively. To evaluate the importance of the predictors, a variable importance
    plot was generated, revealing NDVI from Jun to Sep (X20), precipitation from Feb
    to May (x4), and LST at daytime from Feb to May (X13) to be of higher importance
    compared to the other variables, as depicted in Figure 7. 4. Discussion 4.1. Important
    Variables Analysis In our study, we assessed variable importance using methods
    such as MI, significance of predictors through MLR, and GCV-based importance scoring
    for the MARS, RFR, and GBR models. While ANNs can be powerful predictors, they
    are not typically preferred for identifying important variables due to their ‘black
    box’ nature, which complicates the interpretation of individual feature contributions.
    Therefore, we did not assess variable importance for the ANN model. The results
    of the variable importance analysis for each method were presented in Section
    3. Collectively, the findings suggest that three variables, namely, LST at daytime
    from February to May (X13), NDVI from June to September (X20), and precipitation
    from February to May (X4), consistently show strong importance across different
    models. Previous research also highlights temperature [56], precipitation [56,57,58],
    and NDVI [59,60] as primary factors influencing groundwater levels. Some inconsistencies
    are observed between the analysis and the importance values from the machine learning
    models. This may stem from their differing methodological approaches to examining
    variable importance. Mutual information is a non-parametric method that quantifies
    the degree of dependence or relatedness between two variables. It can capture
    both linear and non-linear relationships, but it does not account for interactions
    between variables. Therefore, a variable might be rated as less important in mutual
    information analysis but may prove critical in a model where interactions between
    variables are considered. Machine learning models like MARS, RFR, and GBR not
    only consider individual variables’ contributions but also consider the interactions
    and combinations of variables. Consequently, these models can identify variables
    as important even if their individual relationships with the outcome variable
    are not strong, provided their combined effect with other variables is substantial.
    This highlights the importance of applying diverse methods when investigating
    variable importance. Each method brings its own strengths and can offer unique
    insights. Mutual information can identify variables that have a strong individual
    effect, whereas machine learning models can capture complex interaction effects.
    4.2. Model Performance Evaluation and Comparison As previously highlighted in
    Section 2.2, multiple experiments were carried out for each machine learning algorithm.
    For the residual plots (Figure 6), observed versus predicted plot (Figure 8),
    Taylor diagram (Figure 9), and the comparison in Table 4, we selected a model
    with close to median performance across all models. To provide a more comprehensive
    understanding of each model’s performance, we also calculated the average performance
    score from the fifteen experiments. These averages are presented in Table 5. Figure
    8. Observed (m) versus predicted (m) plots on full data set for (a) MLR; (b) MARS;
    (c) ANN; (d) Original RFR; (e) RFR with linear transformation; (f) GBR. Figure
    9. (a) Taylor diagram for the training data; (b) Taylor diagram for the testing
    data. The circle on the x-axis represents the observed or the reference dataset.
    The x-axis indicates the standard deviation of the predicted data, whereas the
    y-axis represents the centered root mean square difference between the predicted
    and observed data. The radial distance from the origin (angle with the x-axis)
    represents the correlation coefficient between the predicted and observed data.
    Together, these three axes provide a comprehensive view of model performance.
    The results presented in Table 4 show that GBR outperforms the other models with
    a high R-squared value of 0.76. In the Taylor diagram (Figure 9b), the point representing
    GBR on the testing dataset is closer to the observed point on the x-axis compared
    to other models, indicating a higher similarity in standard deviation between
    the GBR model output and the observations. While the performance of the RFR with
    linear transformation is slightly inferior to the GBR, it still outperforms the
    remaining models. This observation aligns with literature findings [61,62,63],
    wherein gradient boosting consistently emerges as the top performer among the
    machine learning models used for water level predictions. In contrast, MLR appears
    insufficient for modeling our data effectively. The MARS model exhibits some predictive
    capability, though it does not fully capture the data’s complexity. With an R-squared
    value of 0.99 on the training data and 0.61 on the testing data, the ANN model
    shows clear evidence of overfitting to the training data. This occurs despite
    the model having a only single hidden layer and parameters that have been optimally
    tuned to avoid overfitting. The overfitting may stem from the small and potentially
    less diverse dataset, causing the model to memorize training data rather than
    learn to generalize from it. Future work might resolve this by enriching the dataset
    and/or simplifying the model. Table 5 presents the average performance score based
    on multiple experiments conducted for each model. Consistent with the findings
    from the single experiment (Table 4), GBR has the best performance among the models.
    The RFR model’s performance is slightly lower than that of GBR. MARS, on the other
    hand, exhibits the weakest average performance among the five models. Collectively,
    these results suggest that GBR and RFR are most suitable for predicting depth
    to water table for our data set, aligning with findings from previous research
    [7,15,61,62,63]. It is worthy of note that other studies in the literature achieved
    better model performance than the results reported here, but these studies were
    based on time series data. When groundwater levels from a previous time period
    are available as a predictor, it is natural that predictions will be more accurate.
    We have not found other studies using machine learning to predict groundwater
    level in which no data on prior groundwater levels was available. For purposes
    of guiding drilling decisions, the ability to predict groundwater levels from
    publicly available hydrogeological and climate data, without the use of prior
    groundwater levels, is essential. 4.3. Grid Points Prediction Evaluation Based
    on the Best Model As detailed in Section 2.2, the grid points were generated to
    comprehensively represent the study area. We utilized the primary GBR model presented
    in this paper (Table 4) to generate predictions for these grid points. Given the
    map’s discretized nature, we evaluated prediction performance solely based on
    these grid points. This involved comparing the observed water levels from the
    existing 75 boreholes with the predicted water levels for their closest respective
    grid points (Figure 10). Table 6 illustrates the evaluation of water level predictions.
    It is worth noting that the predicted water levels are slightly worse on both
    the training and testing data in comparison to the performance reported in Section
    4.2. This is to be expected: it is naturally more accurate to predict based on
    predictor variables at the well location rather than based on predictor variables
    some distance away. However, this analysis shows that our model can be useful
    even if, as may be the case in practice, predictor values are available only at
    grid points and not at a specific well location. Thus, despite the slight drop
    in prediction accuracy, model results can still be valuable to support decisions
    about drilling locations in the region. While we have not seen such comparisons
    reported previously in the literature, we argue that comparing grid point predictions
    with their nearest actual measurements offers practical insights for drilling
    decisions. Figure 10. (a) Residual plot for the predicted water level for the
    nearest grid point; (b) Actual static water level versus predicted water level
    for the nearest grid point. Table 6. Nearest grid point performance evaluation.
    4.4. Final Map of the Predicted Water Level Utilizing QGIS, we generated a 100
    m × 100 m resolution map based on the grid points (Figure 11). The predicted groundwater
    levels of the grid points were broken into 20 m categories, and we color-coded
    the figure for the purpose of display. The regular block pattern in some areas
    of the map is due to the low resolution of some of the predictor variables. The
    map suggests that areas of shallow groundwater (under 30 m) are predominantly
    located in the northern and southern regions, with some patches in the central
    area. Conversely, the eastern region mostly features deeper groundwater. We found
    no previous studies specifically targeting the Bilate region for groundwater level
    predictions. A prior investigation assessed groundwater potential in Bilate using
    integrated GIS and remote sensing techniques [64]. While a direct comparison between
    that study and ours is challenging due to differing objectives and methodologies,
    it is noteworthy that Gintamo [64] identified the Middle Eastern part of the region
    as having low groundwater potential. This observation is consistent with our findings,
    where the predicted groundwater level in the middle eastern region is among the
    deepest. This high-resolution map can serve as a practical guide for borehole
    drilling for sustainable irrigation, particularly beneficial for stakeholders
    such as drilling companies, government entities, and local farmers. Figure 11.
    Predicted groundwater level for Bilate Ethiopia. 5. Conclusions Our research demonstrates
    the applicability of AI to identifying viable drilling sites for sustainable irrigation
    and drinking water in water-deficient areas. Prior studies have typically utilized
    time series data for groundwater level prediction. However, the challenge in water
    scarcity regions lies in the lack of data due to formidable data collection constraints.
    These regions, marked by higher water demand, necessitate effective strategies
    for groundwater exploitation. Addressing this gap, we have utilized available
    non-time series data to construct and evaluate five machine learning models for
    groundwater level prediction. Of these, Gradient Boosting Regression consistently
    demonstrated superior performance, with an average R-squared value of 0.77 and
    an average median absolute error of 19 m across numerous experiments. The highest-performing
    model was subsequently employed to predict groundwater levels across the entire
    Bilate region. This process resulted in the development of a high-resolution map,
    anticipated to guide local communities and organizations in pinpointing the most
    suitable locations for sustainable irrigation drilling. Furthermore, these findings
    have the potential to enhance food security by providing valuable insights and
    guiding more informed agricultural and water resource management decisions. Land
    Surface Temperature during daytime from February to May, NDVI from June to September,
    and precipitation from February to May consistently demonstrated importance across
    models. There were inconsistencies between the variable importance from the MI
    method and the machine learning methods. The results of these approaches should
    be considered complementary rather than contradictory. Using a combination of
    methods allows for a more robust and comprehensive understanding of variable importance,
    leading to a more reliable model. In case of substantial discrepancies, deeper
    investigations can be conducted to reconcile the findings. There are some limitations
    of this study. Firstly, a potential concern is the relatively small dataset of
    75 boreholes, which are not evenly distributed throughout the Bilate watershed.
    This may present a limitation for making region-wide predictions. Secondly, the
    predictor variables we considered were limited to ones that could be readily computed
    from publicly available data. Thirdly, the ANN model showed a tendency to overfit
    the training data, indicating the need for more extensive hyperparameter tuning
    and model simplification. Lastly, our data, having been collected in 2007, may
    be somewhat dated. Efforts are underway to acquire more recent data to verify
    prediction accuracy. Future research in this region should aim to improve the
    predictive power of groundwater levels by considering additional predictor variables
    (e.g., distance to water and elevation above permanent streams), forecast groundwater
    recharge, and analyze the impacts of climate change. This will provide comprehensive
    guidance for decision-making related to borehole drilling. Author Contributions

  key_findings: '1. Gradient Boosting Regression performed the best of the approaches,
    with an average 0.77 R-squared value and a 19 m median absolute error on testing
    data.

    2. Random Forest Regression and Multivariate Adaptive Regression Splines showed
    some predictive capability, but the MARS model did not fully capture the data’s
    complexity.

    3. The ANN model showed clear evidence of overfitting to the training data, despite
    the model having a limited number of parameters and being optimally tuned to avoid
    overfitting.'
  limitations: Firstly, a potential concern is the relatively small dataset of 75
    boreholes, which are not evenly distributed throughout the Bilate watershed. This
    may present a limitation for making region-wide predictions. Secondly, the predictor
    variables we considered were limited to ones that could be readily computed from
    publicly available data. Thirdly, the ANN model showed a tendency to overfit the
    training data, indicating the need for more extensive hyperparameter tuning and
    model simplification. Lastly, our data, having been collected in 2007, may be
    somewhat dated. Efforts are underway to acquire more recent data to verify prediction
    accuracy.
  main_objective: The primary objective of this study was to predict groundwater levels
    using machine learning algorithms in areas with limited data availability and
    where manual intervention for irrigation management is not feasible.

  description: Accurate groundwater level (GWL) forecasts are crucial for the efficient
    utilization, strategic long-term planning, and sustainable management of finite
    groundwater resources. These resources have a substantial impact on decisions
    related to irrigation planning, crop selection, and water supply. This study evaluates
    data-driven models using different machine learning algorithms to forecast GWL
    fluctuations for one, two, and three weeks ahead in Bangladesh’s Godagari upazila.
    To address the accuracy limitations inherent in individual forecasting models,
    a Bayesian model averaging (BMA)-based heterogeneous ensemble of forecasting models
    was proposed. The dataset encompasses 1807 weekly GWL readings (February 1984
    to September 2018) from four wells, divided into training (70%), validation (15%),
    and testing (15%) subsets. Both standalone models and ensembles employed a Minimum
    Redundancy Maximum Relevance (MRMR) algorithm to select the most influential lag
    times among candidate GWL lags up to 15 weeks. Statistical metrics and visual
    aids were used to evaluate the standalone and ensemble GWL forecasts. The results
    consistently favor the heterogeneous BMA ensemble, excelling over standalone models
    for multi-step ahead forecasts across time horizons. For instance, at GT8134017,
    the BMA approach yielded values like R (0.93), NRMSE (0.09), MAE (0.50 m), IOA
    (0.96), NS (0.87), and a-20 index (0.94) for one-week-ahead forecasts. Despite
    a slight decline in performance with an increasing forecast horizon, evaluation
    indices confirmed the superior BMA ensemble performance. This ensemble also outperformed
    standalone models for other observation wells. Thus, the BMA-based heterogeneous
    ensemble emerges as a promising strategy to bolster multi-step ahead GWL forecasts
    within this area and beyond.

  explanation: The study evaluated seven machine learning (ML) algorithms—ANFIS, Bagged
    RF, Boosted RF, GPR, Bi-LSTM, MARS, and SVR—for predicting groundwater level (GWL)
    fluctuations at four observation wells located in Godagari upazilla, Rajshahi,
    Bangladesh. The primary goal was to enhance the accuracy and reliability of multi-scale
    GWL forecasting models by utilizing a weighted average ensemble approach based
    on Bayesian Model Averaging (BMA). The BMA-based heterogeneous ensemble (BMA ensemble)
    was compared with the individual ML models and a homogeneous ensemble of ML models
    (SWRF ensemble) for both short-term (1-week ahead) and long-term (2- and 3-weeks
    ahead) forecasting horizons. Statistical metrics (R, NRMSE, MAE, IOA, NS, a-20
    index) were used to evaluate model performance.

    because of the nonlinear nature of GWLs as well as their multi-scale and time-varying
    behavior.

    capturing nonlinear relationships between input and output variables and that
    often show the best accuracy for GWL and other research domains in different parts
    of the world.

    Figures Versions Notes Abstract Accurate groundwater level (GWL) forecasts are
    crucial for the efficient utilization, strategic long-term planning, and sustainable
    management of finite groundwater resources. These resources have a substantial
    impact on decisions related to irrigation planning, crop selection, and water
    supply. This study evaluates data-driven models using different machine learning
    algorithms to forecast GWL fluctuations for one, two, and three weeks ahead in
    Bangladesh’s Godagari upazila. To address the accuracy limitations inherent in
    individual forecasting models, a Bayesian model averaging (BMA)-based heterogeneous
    ensemble of forecasting models was proposed. The dataset encompasses 1807 weekly
    GWL readings (February 1984 to September 2018) from four wells, divided into training
    (70%), validation (15%), and testing (15%) subsets. Both standalone models and
    ensembles employed a Minimum Redundancy Maximum Relevance (MRMR) algorithm to
    select the most influential lag times among candidate GWL lags up to 15 weeks.
    Statistical metrics and visual aids were used to evaluate the standalone and ensemble
    GWL forecasts. The results consistently favor the heterogeneous BMA ensemble,
    excelling over standalone models for multi-step ahead forecasts across time horizons.
    For instance, at GT8134017, the BMA approach yielded values like R (0.93), NRMSE
    (0.09), MAE (0.50 m), IOA (0.96), NS (0.87), and a-20 index (0.94) for one-week-ahead
    forecasts. Despite a slight decline in performance with an increasing forecast
    horizon, evaluation indices confirmed the superior BMA ensemble performance. This
    ensemble also outperformed standalone models for other observation wells. Thus,
    the BMA-based heterogeneous ensemble emerges as a promising strategy to bolster
    multi-step ahead GWL forecasts within this area and beyond. Keywords: groundwater

    Bayesian model averaging 1. Introduction Groundwater is a crucial resource of
    water for fulfilling the requirements of different sectors, such as domestic,
    industrial, and agricultural sectors. Unfortunately, the unsustainable extraction
    of groundwater resources has caused a reduction in the availability of this resource,
    leading to a notable disparity between the amount of groundwater available and
    the amount that is required to fulfill the needs. The unsustainable withdrawal
    of groundwater for irrigation practices is causing the annual extraction of groundwater
    beyond its natural replenishment capacity. This highlights the urgent requirement
    for the implementation of sustainable measures to manage groundwater resources.
    Changes in climate, such as alterations in precipitation patterns and temperature,
    can influence the rate at which groundwater is replenished, resulting in a decline
    in groundwater levels (GWL) in aquifers. Moreover, human activities, including
    land use modifications like deforestation and urbanization, can decrease the amount
    of water recharge rates in the groundwater aquifers. In Bangladesh, groundwater
    is a major source of drinking water and it plays a significant role in the agricultural
    sector. However, the overexploitation of groundwater through excessive pumping
    for irrigation purposes has resulted in declining GWLs in multiple regions, causing
    water scarcity and deteriorating water quality [1]. According to a recent study,
    the rate of groundwater depletion in Bangladesh has escalated from 1980 to 2019,
    leading to a significant impact on agricultural productivity and water availability
    [2]. To address these issues, forecasting the accuracy of GWL is essential for
    managing water resources effectively and minimizing the effects of climate change
    on water availability. The use of Machine Learning (ML) algorithms in GWL forecasting
    has become more frequent as they are capable of processing large amounts of data
    and capturing nonlinear relationships between predictors and response variables.
    On the other hand, obtaining comprehensive knowledge about aquifer processes,
    geometry, and modeling techniques required for physically based numerical simulation
    models can be challenging due to data limitations, especially in developing countries
    like Bangladesh. Therefore, these models usually rely on assumptions and simplifications.
    Physically based numerical simulation models can be affected by significant uncertainties
    and errors in areas with limited monitoring data, mainly due to data scarcity
    and poor quality [3]. Additionally, physically based models may encounter inaccuracies
    in their predictions due to simplifications and assumptions made during the modeling
    process, leading to structural errors [4]. These limitations have prompted researchers
    to seek alternative modeling approaches, such as data-driven modeling, that can
    overcome these issues. On the other hand, ML-based models are commonly considered
    to be a “black box” model because they use algorithms to analyze and identify
    patterns in data without the need for explicit programming instructions. Nevertheless,
    the nonlinear dynamics of aquifer responses can be effectively captured by ML-based
    algorithms, which have emerged as an alternative to physically based models. Unlike
    physically based models, ML algorithms can establish a direct relationship between
    predictors and response variables without requiring an explicit definition of
    physical system parameters. As a result, they have become a valuable tool in groundwater
    management and forecasting. Recent research has emphasized the effectiveness of
    ML algorithms in data-driven modeling approaches for GWL prediction. As an illustration
    of the potential of ML in groundwater prediction and management, Vu et al. [5]
    employed the Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) algorithm to create a data-driven model
    that surpassed a physically based numerical model in its ability to forecast GWLs
    in an arid area. Pham et al. [6] employed ML algorithms to predict GWLs and discovered
    that their data-driven model had a superior performance in comparison to a physically
    based model. This finding aligns with recent research, which has demonstrated
    that data-driven modeling methods can perform equally well or better than physically
    based simulation models in forecasting nonlinear time series data, such as groundwater
    table data [7,8,9]. These investigations emphasize the potential of data-driven
    approaches in addressing the difficulties related to physically based models,
    particularly in developing nations, where data constraints can make it challenging
    to obtain a comprehensive understanding of aquifer processes and modeling techniques.
    Therefore, our study aimed to compare the performances of seven commonly used
    ML models in predicting multi-scale GWLs at the selected observation wells in
    Bangladesh. These models included Adaptive Neuro-Fuzzy Inference System (ANFIS),
    Bootstrap Aggregated Random Forest (Bagged RF), Boosted Random Forest (Boosted
    RF), Gaussian Process Regression (GPR), Bi-directional Long Short-Term Memory
    (Bi-LSTM) network, Multivariate Adaptive Regression Spline (MARS), and Support
    Vector Regression (SVR). The study aimed at assessing how well each of the ML
    models predicted future GWLs at selected wells, taking into account multiple time
    steps into the future. Some recent research has highlighted the capability of
    these algorithms in forecasting the accuracy of various parameters. Some applications
    in their usage in various disciplines including GWL prediction and forecasting
    domain comprise the application of ANFIS [10,11,12], Bagged RF [13,14], Boosted
    RF [15,16], GPR [17,18], Bi-LSTM [19,20], MARS [21], and SVR [22,23]. However,
    these ML-based forecasting models individually can often fail to map the nonlinear
    relationships between the inputs and outputs relating to GWL fluctuations due
    to prediction uncertainties. Recent studies have demonstrated that although ML
    algorithms can be effective in predicting GWLs, there are certain limitations
    and uncertainties when relying solely on a single algorithm for this task. To
    address these limitations and uncertainties associated with using a single ML
    algorithm for GWL forecasting, recent studies have suggested the use of heterogeneous
    ensemble models [24] that combine different algorithms or modeling techniques.
    These heterogeneous ensemble models are aimed at improving the accuracy and reliability
    of the forecasting results. Researchers have explored different approaches such
    as combining multiple ML algorithms, statistical models, or physical models. Examples
    of recent studies that have proposed and evaluated heterogeneous ensemble models
    for GWL forecasting include the works of Tang et al. [25], Cao et al. [26], and
    Liu et al. [27]. Overall, these studies highlight that while ML algorithms can
    be promising in predicting GWLs, using a single algorithm may not always be enough
    to ensure accurate and reliable forecasts. To address this issue, an ensemble
    of several ML algorithms can be used to provide robust and precise forecasts.
    Ensemble models that combine with multiple algorithms may be necessary to improve
    forecasting performance and enhance the robustness of the models. Ensemble learning
    is a technique that combines multiple ML-based models to improve forecast accuracy
    of a model. There are various types of ensembles that can be used in ML algorithms,
    including bagging, boosting, stacking, blending, and random forest approaches.
    Each type of ensemble has its own unique approach to combining the forecasts of
    multiple models, and recent studies have demonstrated their effectiveness in improving
    the accuracy and reliability of GWL forecasting models. The weighted average approach
    is gaining popularity as an ensemble of ML-based models because it assigns weights
    to individual prediction models based on their prediction precision. Recent studies
    have explored the effectiveness of the weighted average ensemble in GWL prediction
    [28,29,30]. A study by Tao et al. [31] proposed a weighted ensemble of deep learning
    models for GWL forecasting, which outperformed single deep learning models and
    other traditional ML algorithms. Similarly, a study by Gong et al. [32] used a
    weighted average ensemble of SVR models for GWL forecasting, which achieved higher
    accuracy compared to single models and other ensemble approaches. Bayesian Model
    Averaging (BMA) is a popular weighted average ensemble approach to improve the
    accuracy of GWL forecasting models compared to other weighted average ensembles.
    Recent studies have shown the advantages of using BMA, such as its ability to
    incorporate uncertainties in model selection and parameter estimation, which can
    lead to more accurate and robust predictions. For example, Zhou et al. [28] compared
    the performance of BMA with other ensemble methods for GWL forecasting and found
    that BMA outperformed other methods in terms of accuracy and robustness. Similarly,
    Seifi et al. [33] used BMA to combine multiple ML models for GWL forecasting and
    demonstrated that the approach improved the accuracy of the forecasting results
    compared to other weighted average ensembles. However, these studies were conducted
    with different ML algorithms at different geographical locations, limiting their
    applications at other geographical locations. Therefore, the current study aims
    to enhance forecast accuracy and tackle modeling uncertainty by utilizing a weighted
    average ensemble approach based on the BMA of individual forecast models at four
    different observation wells located in northern Bangladesh. The aim of this research
    is to demonstrate the application of several ML algorithms, including ANFIS, Bagged
    RF, Boosted RF, GPR, Bi-LSTM, MARS, and SVR, to forecast GWLs and compare their
    individual performance with a weighted average ensemble based on a BMA approach.
    The study involves developing ensemble forecast models that use historical GWL
    data as input variables and applying them to the observation wells situated in
    Godagari upazilla, Rajshahi, Bangladesh. Our key contributions to the existing
    body of literature involve the first investigation of: Performance evaluation
    of the seven ML-based individual models to forecast multi-step ahead GWL fluctuations.
    Development of a heterogeneous ensemble of the GWL forecast models using the BMA
    approach and comparison of the performance of the ensemble with that of the standalone
    forecast models. Therefore, the research aimed at enhancing the forecasting accuracy
    of multi-scale GWL fluctuations through the utilization of a heterogeneous ensemble
    comprising various ML algorithms. This improvement in forecasting accuracy is
    crucial for effective water resource management and decision-making. In addition,
    by utilizing data-driven ML models, the research offers a more direct and efficient
    approach to GWL forecasting. This reduces the dependence on complex numerical
    simulation models that require extensive data and modeling expertise. Another
    unique aspect is the ensemble’s ability to address forecast uncertainties inherent
    in data-driven models. The introduction of the ensemble approach helps address
    the inherent uncertainties in standalone data-driven models. By combining the
    predictive power of multiple algorithms, the ensemble provides more robust and
    reliable GWL forecasts, particularly in scenarios where uncertainty is a critical
    concern. While ML-based methods have been applied to this domain before, the integration
    of diverse algorithms in an ensemble to enhance accuracy is a unique and innovative
    aspect of this study. The findings can assist water resource managers and policymakers
    in making informed decisions about groundwater resource utilization and conservation.
    Overall, this research will contribute to the advancement of GWL forecasting techniques
    and provides valuable insights for sustainable water resource management in the
    study area and beyond. 2. Materials and Methods 2.1. Study Area and the Data The
    study area is located at the Godagari upazilla of the Rajshahi district in the
    Rajshahi division, Bangladesh. It is situated between 24°21′ and 24°36′ north
    latitudes and 88°17′ and 88°33′ east longitudes with an aerial extent of about
    472.13 km2. The area falls in the extensive Gangetic floodplain, which has a typical
    climatic pattern with very cold winters (below 6 °C) and very dry and hot summers
    (up to 45 °C) [34]. It experiences little annual rainfall compared to other parts
    of the country. Groundwater recharge from rainfall is hindered by a thick clayey
    layer of around 18 m at the top surface. Previous data on GWL fluctuations were
    used to model future scenarios of GWL fluctuations in the selected observation
    wells of the study area, especially to provide a multi-step ahead forecast of
    GWLs. For this, weekly historical data on GWL fluctuations with a period from
    10 October 1983 to 24 September 2018 (1825 weekly GWL records) were collected
    from the Bangladesh Water Development Board [35], an entity dedicated to collecting
    weekly GWL information from designated observation wells. In addition to these
    GWL records, this organization possesses pump test and lithology data for the
    observation wells. The research primarily focuses on evaluating the effectiveness
    of our proposed approach in generating multi-step ahead GWL forecasts with minimal
    input variables, specifically, utilizing only past GWL data. Our approach eliminates
    the necessity of incorporating multiple attributes and relying on numerical simulation
    models, which often demand extensive data and specialized modeling expertise,
    as well as subjective judgment. In summary, this research relies on secondary
    data gathered by the Bangladesh Water Development Board, which is responsible
    for collating water quality and water level data from designated observation wells.
    This data collection includes manually recorded measurements of the depth of the
    water level below the ground surface. Collected data at different observation
    wells were carefully checked and four observation wells, namely GT8134017, GT8134020,
    GT8134021, and GT8134022, were selected based on the criterion of the least number
    of missing entries. The observation well GT8134017 is positioned between 24.40°
    N latitude and 88.43° E longitude. The position of the observation well GT8134020
    is between 24.52° N latitude and 88.38° E longitude. The observation well GT8134021
    lies between 24.49° N latitude and 88.46° E longitude, whereas the observation
    well GT8134022 is situated between 24.43° N latitude and 88.46° E longitude. The
    study area and the positions of the observation wells inside the study area are
    shown in Figure 1. Figure 1. Study area. To ensure that the collected GWL datasets
    meet the highest standards, a data quality assurance approach is frequently employed.
    This approach enhances the reliability of GWL forecasts made using ML techniques.
    The quality of the collected GWL data was rigorously evaluated for accuracy and
    completeness using range/limit tests, even though a comprehensive quality inspection
    method was not applied to the current dataset. The primary objective of range
    testing is to confirm that each observation falls within a specified range. Only
    measurements within this threshold are accepted, while those outside of the range
    are accurately categorized as invalid. To generate a multi-step ahead GWL projection,
    the data falling within the permissible range were used to model future GWL changes
    in the selected observation wells. However, there were some missing values in
    the GWL datasets in the selected observation wells. The missing entries of weekly
    GWL data accounted for 0.60% (12 missing entries out of 2021 data), 0.49% (10
    missing entries out of 2021 data), 0.35% (7 missing entries out of 2021 data),
    and 0.39% (8 missing entries out of 2021 data) for the observation wells GT8134017,
    GT8134020, GT8134021, and GT8134022, respectively. The average of the preceding
    and subsequent weeks (i.e., adjacent weeks) was used to fill in any gaps in a
    given week’s data [36]. Table 1 presents a few descriptive statistics of the datasets
    (after imputation of the missing entries) at the selected observation wells. Table
    1 reveals that the mean values of GWL data ranged between 6.534 m (at GT8134022)
    and 7.735 m (at GT8134020), whereas the standard deviation values varied between
    2.274 m (at GT8134022) and 2.797 m (at GT8134017). The data at all observation
    wells possessed a longer left tail than the right tail in their distribution,
    as evidenced by the negative skewness values (Table 1). Likewise, the datasets
    showed “light-tailed” distributions because the kurtosis values are also negative
    at all observation wells. Table 1. Values of the statistical parameters computed
    on the GWL data (m) at the designated observation wells. 2.2. Machine Learning-Based
    Models 2.2.1. Adaptive Neuro-Fuzzy Inference System (ANFIS) A hybrid computational
    model, called the Adaptive Neuro-Fuzzy Inference System (ANFIS), incorporates
    the advantages of both Artificial Neural Network and fuzzy reasoning methods.
    Models that can learn from data and then apply that learning to generate predictions
    or anticipate the future may be developed using ANFIS. The ANFIS model architecture
    used in this study is Sugeno-based and employs Gaussian and linear-type Membership
    Functions (MFs) for the inputs and outputs, respectively. According to Jang et
    al. [37], a Gaussian MF comprises the two important model parameters {c, σ} and
    can be written as follows: 𝑔𝑎𝑢𝑠𝑠𝑖𝑎𝑛(𝑥,𝑐,𝜎)= 𝑒 − 1 2 ( 𝑥−𝑐 𝜎 ) 2 (1) where 𝑐 represents
    the center of the MF, and 𝜎 denotes the MF’s width. Figure 2 can be used to visually
    display the architecture of an ANFIS model of the Sugeno-type [37]. Figure 2.
    ANFIS architecture based on a two-input first-order Sugeno FIS. The ANFIS architecture
    depicted in Figure 2 is a basic design that is developed from a Sugeno FIS structure
    of the first order, comprising a single output ( 𝑓 ) and two inputs ( 𝛼 and 𝛽
    ). The fuzzy if-then rules for the Sugeno FIS are represented as: Rule 1:If 𝛼
    is  𝑃 1  and 𝛽 is  𝑄 1 then  𝑓 1 = 𝑝 1 𝛼+ 𝑞 1 𝛽+ 𝑟 1 (2) Rule 2:If 𝛼 is  𝑃 2  and
    𝛽 is  𝑄 2  then  𝑓 2 = 𝑝 2 𝛼+ 𝑞 2 𝛽+ 𝑟 2 (3) The ANFIS model is composed of five
    layers, namely the input layer, fuzzification layer, rule layer, defuzzification
    layer, and an output layer. The input data is fed into the input layer, and subsequently,
    the fuzzification layer transforms it into fuzzy sets. Rules are generated in
    the rule layer based on these fuzzy sets, which are then combined to generate
    the system output. The defuzzification layer is responsible for converting the
    fuzzy output to a crisp output. During the learning process, the ANFIS model adjusts
    the parameters of the fuzzy sets and the rules using the training data. To adjust
    the parameters of the neural network, the model employs a backpropagation algorithm,
    while the parameters of the fuzzy sets are adjusted using a least squares method.
    ANFIS offers several advantages over other modeling techniques due to its ability
    to handle noisy and uncertain data, capture non-linear relationships between input
    and output variables, and integrate expert knowledge into the model. The GWL forecasting
    models based on ANFIS are created by utilizing the functions and commands of MATLAB
    programming language. ANFIS employs a hybrid learning algorithm for parameter
    identification in Sugeno-type fuzzy inference systems (FIS). This approach combines
    the least squares method and the backpropagation gradient descent method to train
    FIS membership function parameters, effectively replicating a provided training
    dataset. ANFIS models are developed by tuning the parameters of initial FISs,
    which are created using the fuzzy c-means clustering algorithm (FCM). The FCM
    is employed to compress the training dataset into a set of identical clusters
    that significantly reduce the number of rules in FIS generation. This clustering
    approach substantially reduces the number of adjustable parameters, both linear
    and nonlinear, within the FIS models. Selecting the optimum number of clusters
    is an important pre-processing step in FIS model development using the FCM algorithm.
    The appropriate number of clusters is determined based on the nature of the problem
    and the dimension of the input space. In most cases, a simpler model architecture
    is preferred. In this study, we determine the optimal number of clusters by conducting
    multiple trials with varying cluster numbers and assessing the resulting Root
    Mean Square Error (RMSE) between the actual and predicted responses obtained from
    the selected FIS models. We select the number of clusters that yields the minimum
    RMSE value and the least variance in RMSE values between the training and testing
    datasets, considering it to be suitable. We also scrutinize the lowest variance
    in RMSE values between the training and testing datasets to prevent model overfitting.
    2.2.2. Bagged and Boosted RF A Random Forest (RF) is an ML-based algorithm that
    utilizes an ensemble of decision trees for making predictions. The method involves
    generating a group of independent trees and combining their outputs through averaging.
    Each tree in the forest is constructed based on a random subset of features from
    the dataset, and the splitting criteria for each tree are determined independently
    [38]. Bagging and Boosting are commonly utilized in ML to enhance the accuracy
    of decision tree-based models like RF. These techniques can significantly improve
    the performance of RF models by reducing model overfitting, variance (in the case
    of Bagging), and bias (in the case of Boosting). Bagging is a method that entails
    generating several random samples of the training data by using bootstrapping
    and training a model on each sample. The ultimate prediction is achieved by taking
    an average of all the model predictions. This technique helps to mitigate the
    problem of overfitting and variance that can occur in a model. On the other hand,
    Boosting is an ML technique that involves training a model on the entire training
    set and iteratively adjusting the weights of the misclassified samples to enhance
    the model’s performance. In Boosting, new decision trees are added to the model
    to correct the errors of the previous trees. The final prediction is made by combining
    the predictions of all the trees, which are weighted based on their accuracy.
    A detailed description of the Bagged and Boosted RFs can be found in Breiman [38]
    and is not repeated in this study. The Bagged-RF and Boosted-RF-based GWL forecasting
    models are developed using the functions and commands of MATLAB. 2.2.3. Gaussian
    Process Regression (GPR) Gaussian Process Regression (GPR) is a non-parametric
    and Bayesian ML approach that models nonlinear relationships between input and
    output variables. It uses a Gaussian process, which is a set of random variables
    that have a joint Gaussian distribution, to model the relationship between inputs
    and outputs. The goal of GPR is to build a mapping between the predictors, 𝑋(𝑖)
    and the response variable, 𝑌 , expressed as a functional relationship. In simpler
    terms, GPR is a way to predict outputs based on inputs by building a statistical
    model using a flexible and non-parametric approach. The functional relationship
    between 𝑋(𝑖) and 𝑌 can be defined as [39]: 𝑌=𝑓(𝑋(𝑖))+𝜀 (4) where 𝜀 symbolizes
    the Gaussian noise with variance 𝜎 2 𝑛 . When using GPR, the mean and covariance
    of the Gaussian process are determined by the data used for training. These two
    functions play important roles in building the input–output mapping for the GPR
    model. The mean function is responsible for determining the expected value of
    the function at any given location in the variable space. In other words, it provides
    a prediction for the output variable based on the input variables. This mean function
    can be written as [40]: 𝑚( 𝑥 𝑖 )=𝐸[𝑓( 𝑥 𝑖 )] (5) The most fundamental and significant
    component in developing a GPR model is thought to be the covariance function.
    The covariance function shows how similar or dissimilarly connected the inputs
    and outputs are. The covariance function is defined as follows: 𝑘( 𝑥 𝑖 ,  𝑥 𝑗
    )=𝐸 [(𝑓( 𝑥 𝑖 )−𝑚( 𝑥 𝑖 )) (𝑓( 𝑥 𝑗 )−𝑚( 𝑥 𝑗 ))] (6) A final representation of the
    Gaussian process is: 𝑓(𝑥)~𝑔𝑝 (𝑚( 𝑥 𝑖 ), 𝑘( 𝑥 𝑖 ,  𝑥 𝑗 )) (7) One of the major
    benefits of using GPR is that it can effectively model intricate relationships
    between input and output variables without assuming any specific distribution
    of the data. This feature is especially useful when dealing with data that may
    be noisy or incomplete, as GPR cannot only provide predictions but also estimates
    of the uncertainty associated with these predictions. Therefore, GPR is a powerful
    tool for predictive modeling in situations where the relationships between variables
    are complex and the data are imperfect. The GPR-based GWL forecasting models are
    developed using the functions and commands of MATLAB. 2.2.4. Bidirectional Long
    Short-Term Memory (Bi-LSTM) Network Bi-LSTM is a variant of the traditional LSTM
    neural network, consisting of both forward and backward LSTM layers that allow
    for the integration of long-range context in both directions. The LSTM architecture
    addresses the issue of vanishing gradients by using gating mechanisms, while the
    Bi-LSTM allows for the inclusion of both preceding and subsequent data. The traditional
    LSTM consists of multiple memory blocks with several memory units and three gates:
    the input gate selects and converts new data into cell form, the forget gate removes
    irrelevant information, and the output gate decides which essential information
    from the cell should be used as the output. As a type of Recurrent Neural Network
    (RNN), Bi-LSTM transforms the individual activations into dependent activation
    sequences by providing all neural network layers with identical weights and biases
    and using prior outputs as input for subsequent hidden layers. In a standard RNN
    architecture, the hidden layer undergoes an update based on the layer input and
    prior hidden form at each time step 𝑡 using the following equation. ℎ 𝑡 = 𝜎 ℎ  (𝑊
    𝑥 𝑡 +𝑉 ℎ 𝑡 −1− 𝑏 ℎ ) (8) where W is the weight matrix delivered via the input
    to the hidden layer, V is the weight matrix between two hidden serial states (
    ℎ 𝑡−1 and ℎ 𝑡 ), 𝑏 ℎ is the bias vector for the hidden layer, and 𝜎 ℎ is the activation
    function to generate the hidden structure. The model output can be represented
    as 𝑦 𝑡 = 𝜎 𝑦 (𝑈 ℎ 𝑡 + 𝑏 𝑦 ) (9) where U is the weight matrix from the hidden layer
    converted to the output layer, and 𝜎 𝑦 is the activation function of the output
    layer. The LSTM layers process sequential data unidirectionally and modify it
    to capture the patterns. However, a backward LSTM layer can introduce bidirectional
    capabilities to the model. The LSTM layers procedure series data unidirectionally
    and modify it to capture the randomness. Nonetheless, a backward LSTM layer can
    deliver bidirectionality into the model. Thus, developing a Bi-LSTM layer, including
    a forward LSTM layer and a backward LSTM layer, processes series data with two
    particular hidden layers and merges them into the same output layer. In the development
    of Bi-LSTM models, network architectures featuring three hidden layers were implemented.
    Following each of these hidden layers, a dropout layer was incorporated to prevent
    or mitigate overfitting in the proposed Bi-LSTM models. The first, second, and
    third hidden layers were configured with 100, 50, and 20 hidden neurons, respectively.
    Correspondingly, dropout rates of 0.4, 0.3, and 0.2 were assigned to the respective
    dropout layers. These optimal values were determined through an iterative process
    of experimentation. Various training configurations for the Bi-LSTM models were
    explored during these trials and the most effective ones for the model training
    were selected (Table 2). Table 2. Optimal parameter sets for the GWL forecasting
    models. The training setup consisted of four layers for the Bi-LSTM models: A
    sequence input layer, which matched the number of input variables or features.
    A Bi-LSTM layer, whose units corresponded to the number of hidden units. A fully
    connected layer, tailored to the number of output variables or response variables.
    Finally, a regression layer. This architecture allowed effective training and
    evaluation of the proposed Bi-LSTM models for the intended task. 2.2.5. Multivariate
    Adaptive Regression Spline (MARS) Multivariate Adaptive Regression Spline (MARS)
    is a non-parametric regression method that was first introduced by Jerome H. Friedman
    in 1991 [41]. Since then, it has become a widely used technique for modeling intricate
    and nonlinear relationships between input and output variables in data mining
    and ML applications. One of the advantages of MARS is its ability to handle both
    continuous and categorical input variables, as well as their interactions. Additionally,
    MARS is particularly helpful in identifying the most important input variables
    in high-dimensional data and modeling non-linear interactions between inputs and
    outputs. Overall, MARS is a powerful tool for building flexible and accurate regression
    models in situations where the relationships between variables are complex and
    nonlinear. MARS approximates the nonlinear relationship between input and output
    variables by dividing them into a series of linear segments, which are connected
    at “knots”. The selection of knots is based on the associated data, and they are
    used to improve prediction accuracy by minimizing the sum of squared errors between
    the actual and predicted responses. Each linear segment is represented as a linear
    combination of the input variables, where the coefficients are also determined
    by the data. MARS model building involves both a forward and a backward stepwise
    procedure. During the forward step, the model is constructed using user-specified
    Basis functions, while during the backward step, redundant or unnecessary input
    variables are systematically eliminated to reduce the model’s complexity and prevent
    over fitting. This results in a more optimal and accurate model. The mapping between
    input and output variables in MARS can be expressed mathematically, as outlined
    in Roy and Datta [42]. 𝐵 𝐹 𝑖 (𝑋)=𝑚𝑎𝑥(0,  𝑋 𝑗 −𝑎) 𝑜𝑟 𝐵 𝐹 𝑖 (𝑋)=𝑚𝑎𝑥(0, 𝛼− 𝑋 𝑗 )
    (10) 𝑌=𝑓(𝑋)=𝛽± 𝛾 𝑘 ×𝐵 𝐹 𝑖 (𝑋) (11) where 𝑖 and 𝑗 symbolize the indices for Basic
    functions and input variables, respectively; 𝐵 𝐹 𝑖 indicates the 𝑖 𝑡ℎ Basis functions;
    𝑋 𝑗 denotes the 𝑗 𝑡ℎ input variables; 𝛼 is a constant referred to as the knot;
    𝛽 indicates a constant value; 𝛾 𝑘 represents the corresponding coefficients of
    𝐵 𝐹 𝑖 (𝑋). 2.2.6. Support Vector Regression (SVR) Support Vector Regression (SVR)
    is an ML-based approach that is employed for performing regression tasks by offering
    both linear and non-linear mappings between the input and output variables. It
    is based on the same principle as Support Vector Machines (SVMs), which are used
    for classification tasks. The primary goal of SVR is to determine a function that
    can best approximate the relationship between input and output variables while
    minimizing the prediction error. To achieve this, SVR maps the input variables
    to a high-dimensional feature space, where a linear relationship between input
    and output variables may exist. The technique then identifies a hyperplane that
    maximizes the margin between the predicted values and the actual values, with
    the margin represents the distance between the predicted values and the hyperplane.
    This margin is used to balance the complexity of the model against the error rate.
    Additionally, SVR is less prone to overfitting than other non-linear regression
    techniques since it concentrates on discovering the best hyperplane that generalizes
    well to new data [43]. This effort provides a concise overview of how SVR models
    can be used to solve regression problems. When constructing an SVR model, the
    training dataset can be expressed using the following equation: 𝑃={( 𝑎 1 , 𝑏 1
    ),( 𝑎 2 , 𝑏 2 ),( 𝑎 3 , 𝑏 3 ),….,( 𝑎 𝑁 , 𝑏 𝑁 )} (12) where 𝑎 𝑖 (𝑖=1,2,3,….,𝑁)
    represents a vector comprising real independent variables; 𝑏 𝑖 (𝑖=1,2,3,….,𝑁)
    represents the associated scalar real independent variable. The feature space
    representation of the regression equation for the training dataset is as follows:
    𝑧(𝑎,𝑤)=(𝑤·∅(𝑎)+𝑐) (13) where 𝑤 represents the weight vector; 𝑐 symbolizes a constant;
    ∅(𝑎) denotes the feature function; and 𝑤·∅(𝑎) represents the dot product. SVR
    minimizes the following cost function to accomplish regression tasks: Minimize:
    𝑄(𝑓)=𝐶 1 𝑁 𝐿 𝜀 (𝑏,𝑧(𝑎,𝑤))+ 1 2 ∥ 𝑊 2 ∥ (14) 𝐿 𝜀 (𝑏,𝑧(𝑎,𝑤))={ 0 |𝑏−𝑧(𝑎,𝑤)|−𝜀 if  |𝑏−𝑧(𝑎,𝑤)|≤𝜀  otherwise
    (15) The above equation represents the empirical error, while the second term
    (denoted by 𝐶 ) measures the trade-off between the empirical error and the model
    complexity. Equation (15) represents a loss function referred to as the “ε-insensitive
    loss function” [44]. By introducing Lagrangian multipliers 𝛽 and 𝛽* , the optimization
    problem in Equation (15) is transformed into a dual problem. Support vectors are
    only defined as combinations of non-zero coefficients and their corresponding
    input vectors, 𝑎 𝑖 . The equation eventually has the following final form: 𝑧(𝑎,
    𝛽 𝑖 , 𝛽 ∗ 𝑖 )= ∑ 𝑖=1 𝑁 𝑠𝑣 ( 𝛽 𝑖 − 𝛽 ∗ 𝑖 )(∅( 𝑎 𝑖 )·∅( 𝑎 𝑗 ))+𝑐 (16) The SVR function
    can be expressed as follows using the kernel function 𝐾( 𝑥 𝑖 , 𝑥 𝑗 ) : 𝑧(𝑎, 𝛽
    𝑖 , 𝛽 ∗ 𝑖 )= ∑ 𝑖=1 𝑁 𝑠𝑣 ( 𝛽 𝑖 − 𝛽 ∗ 𝑖 )𝐾(𝑎, 𝑎 𝑖 )+𝑐 (17) The above equations are
    used to compute the term 𝑐 using the Karush–Kuhn–Tucker condition. When using
    the SVR technique to solve a regression problem, the cost function 𝐶 , the radius
    of the insensitive tube 𝜀 , and the kernel parameters 𝐾( 𝑥 𝑖 , 𝑥 𝑗 ) are thought
    to be the most crucial variables. The forecasting models for GWL based on the
    SVR approach are developed using MATLAB’s functions and commands. 2.3. Modeling
    Techniques This section provides specifics on data pre-processing and modeling
    techniques adopted in this research to develop the ML-based forecast models (ANFIS,
    Bagged RF, Boosted RF, GPR, Bi-LSTM, MARS, and SVR) proposed in this research
    to forecast multi-step ahead GWL fluctuations. Data pre-processing is a crucial
    step in enhancing the forecasting accuracy of any ML model. It encompasses various
    tasks, including data collection and compilation, quality assessment, cleaning
    and imputation, data splitting, feature engineering, and data standardization,
    among others, to ensure that the data are suitable for analysis and modeling.
    The issues related to data collection and compilation, as well as cleaning and
    imputation, are addressed in Section 2.1, ‘Study area and the data’. Subsequent
    sub-sections provide detailed information on data splitting, feature engineering,
    data standardization, and the modeling techniques employed in this research. These
    steps collectively contribute to improving the forecasting accuracy of multi-scale
    GWL fluctuations using a heterogeneous ensemble of ML algorithms. 2.3.1. Data
    Preprocessing Initially, a total of 1825 GWL records (from 10 October 1983 to
    24 September 2018) were collected for providing multi-step ahead GWL forecasts.
    The collected weekly GWL data decreased at every observation well due to temporal
    lags for the lagged inputs and the output. At each observation well, a total of
    1807 historical records remained (from 13 February 1988 to 24 September 2018 after
    removing 18 records due to time lagging (3-time lags forward + 15-time lags backward)
    from the entire GWL time series of 1825 readings (from 10 October 1983 to 24 September
    2018). The remaining dataset at each observation well were divided into three
    subsets: the first 1267 datasets (70% of total) were employed for model development
    (training), the next 270 datasets (15% of total) were used for model validation,
    and the remaining 270 datasets (15% of total) were used for model evaluation (testing).
    After satisfactory training and validation of the GWL forecast models, the models
    were tested using an unseen test dataset, which was used neither for model training
    nor for model validation. Although there is not a fixed rule for dataset dividing
    throughout model training and validation [45], it is generally agreed that the
    validation division should be between 10% and 40% of the length of the entire
    dataset [46]. 2.3.2. Selection of Input Variables One of the most crucial aspects
    in creating ML-based forecast models is deciding on the influential input variables
    [47,48]. In order to choose the input variables for hydrological and water resources
    modeling, both linear [49] and nonlinear approaches [48] have been used [47].
    However, because hydrological and water resource modeling frequently involves
    nonlinear issues, linear approaches based on the Partial Auto Correlation Function
    (PACF) and Auto Correlation Function (ACF) are normally not the best approaches
    [50]. In general, nonlinear approaches based on Mutual Information (MI) [51] outperform
    linear approaches for the modeling of hydrology and water resources research areas
    in addition to other scientific and technological application domains [32,47,48,52].
    Since ANFIS, GPR, Bi-LSTM, and SVR do not automatically quantify the significance
    of input variables, it is crucial to undertake the selection of most influential
    input variables before developing these models. In this research, we employed
    the Minimum Redundancy Maximum Relevance (MRMR) technique developed by Peng et
    al. [53], one of the most popular MI techniques for input variable identification.
    Using MI to find potential candidate inputs that are pertinent but not unnecessary,
    this method chooses input variables from a group of alternatives. It has been
    demonstrated that this method chooses input variables that are more suitable than
    other methods of a similar kind [54]. An operator Φ(𝐷,𝑅) is defined to concurrently
    optimize the minimum redundancy ( 𝑅 ) and maximum relevance ( 𝐷 ) for selecting
    an input subset ( 𝑆 ) from 𝑑 input variables in 𝑥 [53]. This can be mathematically
    represented as: maxΦ(𝐷,𝑅), Φ=𝐷−𝑅 (18) A detailed outline of MRMR can be found
    in Peng et al. [53] and is not repeated in this effort. Nevertheless, for approaches
    like MARS and RF, the choice of the input variable is not required. Both strategies
    carry out the internal functions of input variable selection and variable importance
    quantification. 2.3.3. Standardization of Data Data standardization is seen as
    a method for putting data on a uniform scale, making them simpler to assess and
    compare. In order to be certain that various variables or attributes are on an
    equivalent scale and have identical ranges, machine learning algorithms are standardized.
    In the present investigation, the variables used for input were initially normalized
    before the GWL forecasting models were built. Several earlier studies on hydrology
    and water resources used the standardization approach [55,56]. As a result, the
    dataset was created with a mean of 0 and a variance of 1 [57]. The data were standardized
    using the following formula: 𝑋 𝑠𝑡𝑎𝑛𝑑𝑎𝑟𝑑𝑖𝑧𝑒𝑑 = 𝑋−𝜇 𝜎 (19) where 𝑋 represents the
    actual input, 𝑋 𝑠𝑡𝑎𝑛𝑑𝑎𝑟𝑑𝑖𝑧𝑒𝑑 denotes the standardized input, 𝜇 is the mean value
    of the input, and 𝜎 is the standard deviation of the input. 2.3.4. Development
    of Individual Models The choice of the best parameter settings has a significant
    impact on how accurately the majority of ML-based algorithms forecast. Probst
    et al. [58] claim that the vast majority of ML algorithms require that a set of
    properly selected appropriate parameters be used. ML-based model performance is
    significantly influenced by the choice of parameters [59], and poor parameter
    choosing can lead to underachieving models. To enable an equitable evaluation
    of ML-based forecasting models, it is ideal to choose the best or optimal parameter
    sets for each of the ML-based models. In this attempt, a number of trials were
    run using different parameter sets for each model in order to pick the best models
    using the best parameter values for that model. The training and validation data
    were used to conduct these trials, which examined the RMSE of the training phase
    and validation performance. When the RMSE values for the training and validation
    phases differed very little from one another, it was determined that a model was
    performing at its peak efficiency and that no model was overfitted. The parameters
    that were used for the trained individual GWL forecast models developed at the
    four observation wells are shown in Table 2. 2.3.5. Development of Ensemble Models
    Different ML-based modeling approaches have varying degrees of precision in forecasting.
    In accordance with the datasets utilized in both training and evaluation, the
    efficacy of a model may change. It is important to select the best model for a
    specific problem; not all ML-based modeling techniques can be used in a given
    study to compare the effectiveness of each one. This selecting process is difficult
    and time-consuming. An ensemble modeling technique has a benefit in these circumstances
    because it enables the selection of a predetermined number of effective models
    and the combination of their forecasts to provide more precise outcomes. An ensemble
    forecast enhances forecast reliability by more accurately capturing the relationships
    between the predictors and responses in the dataset. Additionally, it shields
    a model’s performance from an individual poor model by minimizing the impact of
    poor projections from the model in question [60]. An ensemble technique utilizes
    the unique characteristics of individual models to recognize various input–output
    relationship trends across the whole decision space of the input–output data.
    For this reason, ensemble models frequently provide higher precision than an individual
    forecast model. Individual forecasting models used in the ensemble development
    must, however, be sufficiently precise and varied to be useful for forecasting.
    The appropriate balance between independent forecasting models in an ensemble-based
    forecast is mostly governed by the trade-offs between model complexity, forecasting
    accuracy, and the level of uncertainty minimization. To overcome the limitations
    of the forecast performance of the individual models, the present study utilizes
    a weighted average ensemble approach using the BMA approach [61]. When there is
    ambiguity over the best model to utilize, BMA is a statistical method that is
    employed to calculate the parameters of the model and generate forecasts. BMA,
    which combines forecasts from many different models by weighing them in accordance
    with their posterior probabilities, which are determined using the data at hand
    and a prior distribution over the models in question, offers an improved comprehension
    of the overall forecasting uncertainty [62]. In order to derive consensus predictions,
    BMA uses probabilistic probability measures for weighting individual predictions,
    with higher probability likelihood values obtaining bigger weights than forecasts
    that have lower probability likelihood values. The fundamental tenet of BMA is
    to approach model selection as a random variable and to account for this uncertainty
    in the analysis. BMA takes into account a set of candidate models and assigns
    a probability to each one depending on how well it fits the data and how well
    it relates to prior knowledge about the problem, rather than choosing a single
    “best” model based on some criterion (e.g., statistical performance assessment
    indices). In comparison to individual ensemble members created using several competing
    ML algorithms, BMA offers a probabilistic forecast that offers more accuracy and
    dependability [62]. For challenges involving multi-scale GWL prediction, the BMA
    technique was employed in this endeavor. A thorough description of the BMA approach
    can be found in the literature [61,62,63], hence the following is a concise summary
    of it. Let us consider the following terms and notations: 𝑦 denotes the predicted
    variable, 𝐷=[ 𝑦 𝑜𝑏𝑠𝑒𝑟𝑣𝑒𝑑 1 ,  𝑦 𝑜𝑏𝑠𝑒𝑟𝑣𝑒𝑑 2 , 𝑦 𝑜𝑏𝑠𝑒𝑟𝑣𝑒𝑑 3 ,…, 𝑦 𝑜𝑏𝑠𝑒𝑟𝑣𝑒𝑑 𝑁 ] represents
    the training data with a data length of 𝑁 , and 𝑓=[ 𝑓 1 , 𝑓 2 , 𝑓 3 ,…, 𝑓 𝑘 ]
    is the ensemble of all selected individual model predictions. Furthermore, consider
    𝑝 𝑘 (𝑦| 𝑓 𝑘 ,𝐷) to be the posterior distribution of 𝑦 with model prediction 𝑓
    𝑘 and matrix of the training data 𝐷 . Then, according to the total probability
    law, the Probability Density Function (PDF) of the BMA-based probabilistic prediction
    of 𝑦 is presented using the equation below: 𝑝(𝑦|𝐷)= ∑ 𝑘=1 𝐾 𝑝( 𝑓 𝑘 |𝐷)· 𝑝 𝑘 (𝑦|
    𝑓 𝑘 ,𝐷) (20) where 𝑝( 𝑓 𝑘 |𝐷) denotes the posterior probability of the model prediction
    𝑓 𝑘 , also known as the probability of model prediction 𝑓 𝑘 being the accurate
    prediction for the training data set 𝐷 . The term 𝑝( 𝑓 𝑘 |𝐷) in Equation (20)
    determines how precisely this specific ensemble member matches the actual observed
    values. If we consider the term 𝑝( 𝑓 𝑘 |𝐷) to be equal to the weights of the individual
    ensemble member, i.e., 𝑤 𝑘 =𝑝( 𝑓 𝑘 |𝐷) , then the sum of weights for all individual
    ensemble members should be equal to 1, i.e., ∑ 𝐾 𝑘=1 𝑤 𝑘 =1 . The BMA predictions’
    posterior mean and variance can be represented by the following equations [62]:
    𝐸[𝑦|𝐷]= ∑ 𝑘=1 𝐾 𝑝( 𝑓 𝑘 |𝐷)·𝐸[ 𝑝 𝑘 (𝑦| 𝑓 𝑘 ,𝐷)]= ∑ 𝑘=1 𝐾 𝑤 𝑘 𝑓 𝑘 (21) Var[𝑦|𝐷]=
    ∑ 𝑘=1 𝐾 𝑤 𝑘 ⎛ ⎝ ⎜ ⎜ ⎜ ⎜ ⎜ 𝑓 𝑘 − ∑ 𝑖=1 𝐾 𝑤 𝑖 𝑓 𝑖 ⎞ ⎠ ⎟ ⎟ ⎟ ⎟ ⎟ 2 + ∑ 𝑘=1 𝐾 𝑤 𝑘
    𝜎 2 𝑘 (22) where 𝜎 2 𝑘 denotes the variance related to the model prediction 𝑓
    𝑘 concerning the training data set 𝐷 . The expected BMA forecast is essentially
    the average of the various predictions weighted by the probability that a particular
    model is accurate for the given observations. In the BMA algorithm, it is assumed
    that the conditional probability distribution, denoted as 𝑝 𝑘 (𝑦| 𝑓 𝑘 ,𝐷) , follows
    a Gaussian distribution. In the standard BMA approach, the EM algorithm is employed
    to maximize the log-likelihood function associated with the parameter vector being
    estimated. If we represent 𝜃 as 𝜃=[{ 𝑤 𝑘 , 𝜎 𝑘 ,𝑘=1,2,…,𝐾}] , the log-likelihood
    function can be approximated as follows: 𝓁(𝜃)=log ⎛ ⎝ ⎜ ⎜ ⎜ ⎜ ⎜ ∑ 𝑘=1 𝐾 𝑤 𝑘 .
    𝑝 𝑘 (𝑦| 𝑓 𝑘 ,𝐷) ⎞ ⎠ ⎟ ⎟ ⎟ ⎟ ⎟ (23) Obtaining an analytical solution for this problem
    is infeasible, necessitating the use of an iterative procedure. The EM algorithm
    is particularly well suited for this purpose. In essence, the EM algorithm formulates
    the maximum likelihood problem as a ‘missing data’ problem. This missing data
    may not represent actual observations but can instead be a latent variable that
    requires estimation. It is important to note that the EM algorithm tends to converge
    to local optima, and the optimal solution is highly sensitive to the initial guess
    of the optimization variables. For clarity, Figure 3 illustrates a flow diagram
    of the proposed ensemble model, including the algorithmic flow of the execution
    of the EM algorithm. Figure 3. Flowchart of (a) a standard BMA approach and (b)
    algorithmic flow of the EM algorithm. Since the probability of a model is essentially
    a gauge of how well the model forecasts match the data provided, one benefit of
    BMA is that a BMA forecast is given larger weights from models that perform better.
    Another benefit of BMA is that it offers a means to account for model uncertainty
    (through BMA variance) and prevent overfitting, which can happen when a single
    model is chosen based on a particular criterion. BMA variance is made up of two
    parts: (1) between-model variance, which is expressed by the very first component
    on the right-hand side of the equation (Equation (22)); and (2) within-model variance,
    which is indicated by the second component on the right-hand side of the equation
    (Equation (22)). As a result, BMA offers a more accurate representation of predictive
    uncertainty than a non-BMA-based ensemble strategy, which integrates uncertainty
    based solely on the ensemble spread (considers between-model variance alone),
    and on the other hand, produces under-dispersive predictions [62]. With the proper
    estimation of 𝜃=[{ 𝑤 𝑘 , 𝜎 𝑘 ,𝑘=1,2,…,𝐾}] and 𝑝 𝑘 (𝑦| 𝑓 𝑘 ,𝜃,𝐷) , it is possible
    to easily generate probabilistic forecasts using Equation (20). 2.4. Model Performance

    Importance MARS and RF variants (Bagged and Boosted RF) inherently offer insights
    into the significance of explanatory variables for predicting the target variable.
    For other models, a total of sixteen (GWL at present time and 15 lags behind)
    most significant input variables were selected using the MRMR technique presented
    in Section 2.3.2. The feature importance score was computed and the top 16 predictors
    were selected for the one-, two-, and three-steps ahead forecasts individually
    at the four observation wells. A high score value indicates the significance of
    the associated predictor. Likewise, a reduction in the feature importance score
    reflects the level of confidence in feature selection. For instance, if the MRMR
    technique confidently selects feature 𝑥 , the score value of the subsequent important
    feature would be notably lower than that of feature 𝑥 . Given that there was no
    considerable disparity between the scores of the subsequent predictors until the
    sixteenth most significant predictors, we opted for the first sixteen most important
    features to build the ML-based models. The analysis revealed that certain variables
    exhibit substantial relative contributions to the models, while the majority displayed
    minimal or negligible contributions. It was generally observed that lagged GWL
    (Lag-1), as expected, was the most important variable for 1 week ahead forecasting
    (Figure 4). Figure 4. Variable importance based on MRMR scores for one-, two-,
    and three-step ahead predictions at different observation wells. 3. Results and
    Discussion 3.1. Performance of the Individual Forecasting Models during Training
    and Validation Training and validation were carried out for the individual forecasting
    models to assess their performance. Figure 5 and Figure 6 display the RMSE index,
    utilized to compare the efficiency of the proposed models across the learning
    and validation phases. The RMSE values for various standalone models forecasting
    GWL one, two, and three weeks in advance are presented for both the learning and
    validation datasets. This index serves as a metric for gauging the accuracy of
    the models during their development. The results reveal that, in the cases of
    wells GT8134017, GT8134021, and GT8134022, the SVR model exhibited lesser disparities
    between RMSE values in training and validation, in contrast to other models like
    ANFIS, BaggedRF, BoostedRF, GPR, BiLSTM, and MARS, which demonstrated more significant
    discrepancies. Conversely, for well GT8134020, the MARS model showcased a smaller
    variance, while ANFIS, BaggedRF, BoostedRF, GPR, BiLSTM, and SVR displayed higher
    divergences. Of all the models, ANFIS displayed the weakest performance, yielding
    the most notable dissimilarities in terms of RMSE values between the training
    and validation phases. Figure 5. Train and validation RMSE during the training
    and validation phases of model development: observation wells GT8134017 and GT8134020.

    of model development: observation wells GT8134021 and GT8134022. 3.2. Performance
    of the Standalone and Ensemble Models on the Independent Test Dataset When applied
    as individual models, ML-based models often struggle to capture the wide range
    of complex patterns contained in the dataset. This limitation can lead to poor
    predictions. In such situations, an ensemble of standalone prediction models can
    be employed, which sometimes outperforms an individual model [24]. Therefore,
    due to the frequent inability of standalone forecast models to capture the true
    trends within training and testing patterns of the dataset, the concept of ensemble
    prediction has been introduced in this research. Furthermore, efforts in model
    development typically focus on reducing prediction uncertainties to provide meaningful
    predictions and enhance the generalization capacity of the developed models. This
    can be accomplished by integrating the predictions of multiple standalone models,
    creating an ensemble of models that produces a single combined prediction [60].
    An ensemble approach can be either homogeneous or heterogeneous, depending on
    the use of single or multiple ML-based algorithms in the ensemble formation [24].
    Previous studies on GWL prediction have demonstrated the effectiveness of homogeneous
    ensembles [29], which outperformed standalone models. Although recent studies
    on saltwater intrusion problems in coastal aquifers have applied a heterogeneous
    ensemble of prediction models [24], this approach has not been previously employed
    to enhance the forecasting accuracy of multi-scale GWL forecasts. This study examines
    the application of a BMA-based ensemble approach to enhance the accuracy and reliability
    of multi-scale GWL forecasts. The approach involves consolidating multiple competing
    forecasts generated by various ML algorithms. BMA is a statistical method that
    derives consensus predictions by assigning weights to individual predictions based
    on their probabilistic likelihood measures. Predictions with superior performance
    receive greater weights than those with poorer performance. Additionally, BMA
    offers a more dependable representation of the overall predictive uncertainty
    compared to the other ensemble approaches, resulting in a more precise and well-calibrated
    Probability Density Function (PDF) for the probabilistic predictions. Ensemble
    techniques aim to enhance the accuracy and consistency of predictions by amalgamating
    multiple standalone forecast models. The rationale underlying ensemble forecasting
    rests upon the notion that diverse models possess individual strengths and weaknesses.
    By consolidating their predictions, a more resilient and precise ML-based algorithm
    can be crafted. Ensemble forecasting is a widely favored strategy to amalgamate
    the forecasting accuracies of individual models due to their divergent performances
    in varied scenarios [24]. A comprehensive comparison between the performances
    of independent models and the BMA ensemble approach distinctly showcases the supremacy
    of the BMA methodology across the GT8134017, GT8134020, GT8134021, and GT8134022
    observation wells. It is worth noting that the precision of forecasts, as gauged
    by evaluation indices, diminishes as forecasting horizons extend. In essence,
    one-week forecasts outperformed two-week forecasts, and two-week forecasts exhibit
    greater accuracy than three-week forecasts. Figure 7 and Figure 8 illustrate the
    individual model performances across various statistical indices when predicting
    the weekly GWL of four observation wells. In Figure 7, the NRMSE and MAD values
    for various ML-based algorithms are presented across different observation wells.
    In terms of statistical significance, the accuracy of a model improves as the
    NRMSE and MAD values decrease. At the GT8134017 well, the BMA model emerged as
    the highest-ranking model, showcasing lower NRMSE values (0.09, 0.12, and 0.13
    for one-, two-, and three-week ahead GWL forecasts) as well as lower MAD values
    (0.17, 0.25, and 0.27 for one-, two-, and three-week ahead GWL forecasts). Conversely,
    the MARS model exhibited the poorest performance, characterized by higher NRMSE
    and MAD values (NRMSE = 0.20, 0.91, and 0.85; MAD = 0.48, 3.18, 3.48 for one-,
    two-, and three-week ahead GWL forecasts). Similarly, across the GT8134020, GT8134021,
    and GT8134022 wells, the BMA model consistently demonstrated lower NRMSE and MAD
    values, further confirming its favorable performance. Figure 7. Error of the models
    developed to forecast the weekly GWL of observation wells GT8134017, GT8134020,
    GT8134021, and GT8134022. Figure 8. Performance of the models developed to forecast
    the weekly GWL of observation wells GT8134017, GT8134020, GT8134021, and GT8134022.
    Conversely, depicted in Figure 8 are the values of R, IOA, and a-20 index for
    distinct ML-based algorithms across various observation wells. Broadly, heightened
    values of R, IOA, and a-20 index correspond to enhanced model accuracy. For the
    GT8134017 observation well, BMA exhibited superior performance when compared to
    alternative models, as evidenced by its higher values of R (0.93, 0.88, and 0.86),
    IOA (0.96, 0.93, and 0.92), and a-20 index (0.94, 0.91, and 0.91) for one-, two-,
    and three-week ahead GWL forecasts, respectively. Likewise, BMA consistently outperformed
    other models across the remaining observation wells, corroborating its efficacy.
    The findings presented in Figure 7 and Figure 8 collectively indicate that the
    BMA model emerges as the superior choice across various prediction horizons for
    different observation wells, surpassing other standalone models when evaluated
    on the independent test dataset. In this study, the BMA approach exhibits exceptional
    performance, with larger R, IOA, and a-20 index values and smaller NRMSE and MAD
    values across all three forecasting horizons and the four observation wells. For
    instance, at the GT8134017 observation well, the BMA model improves the accuracy
    of statistical indices in one-week forecasts by (R = 25.67%, NRMSE = 55%, MAD
    = 68%, IOA = 15.67%, and a-20 index = 18.98%) compared to the poorest-performing
    model. On average, the BMA model consistently demonstrates greater accuracy than
    other individual models across other observation wells. According to our study,
    the BMA approach offers a more dependable and robust comprehension of overall
    predictive uncertainty. The effectiveness of the proposed Bayesian Model Averaging
    approach over the independent models is also apparent when considering other statistical
    performance evaluation measures, as presented in Table 3. It is evident from the
    data presented in Table 3 that, despite the individual models yielding comparatively
    reduced Root Mean Squared Error, Mean Absolute Error, and Mean Bias Error values,
    the Bayesian Model Averaging approach consistently yields the most minimized values
    across all observation wells and forecasting horizons. While the standalone models
    exhibit relatively lower Nash–Sutcliffe Efficiency Coefficient values, the Bayesian
    Model Averaging approach consistently outperforms them in terms of NS for all
    instances. Table 3. Performance of the models in forecasting weekly groundwater
    levels of GT8134017, GT8134020, GT8134021, and GT8134022. A noteworthy observation
    is that the forecasting performance decreases as the forecasting horizon extends.
    This finding aligns well with the conclusions drawn by Rahman et al. [71] and
    Quilty et al. [48], who reported that the accuracy of predictive models tends
    to decrease with the expansion of the forecasting horizon. In summary, the suggested
    heterogeneous ensemble of forecast models based on Bayesian Model Averaging has
    substantially enhanced the reliability and accuracy of multi-scale groundwater
    level fluctuations within the study area. This result aligns well with the conclusions
    reported by Darbandsari and Coulibaly [72]. 4. Conclusions A dependable and precise
    forecast of GWLs can be used to create a groundwater management strategy that
    is effective and sustainable. For agricultural, household, and industrial uses,
    this planning will help to determine the best groundwater abstraction recommendations.
    But it is frequently challenging to provide precise GWL forecasts because of the
    nonlinear nature of GWLs as well as their multi-scale and time-varying behavior.
    An essential requirement for building precise ML-based models involves the selection
    of the most pertinent input variables from a pool of potential candidates, in
    conjunction with the optimization of model parameters. To tackle these concerns,
    this study evaluated the efficacy of various ML-based approaches capable of effectively
    capturing nonlinear relationships between input and output variables and that
    often show the best accuracy for GWL and other research domains in different parts
    of the world. Few of the ML-based approaches are able to perform selection of
    the most significant input variables internally, while for the others, the most
    significant input variables were selected using the MRMR approach. These models
    were fed into the time-lagged information extracted from the time series data.
    Furthermore, these ML-based forecasting model outputs were integrated using the
    BMA approach to enhance the forecasting models’ ability. The proposed models were
    explored for 1, 2, and 3 weeks ahead GWL forecasting. The performance of the proposed
    BMA approach was compared against standalone forecast models. The comparison between
    individual ML approaches and their heterogeneous ensemble (BMA) counterpart demonstrated
    that the BMA approach exhibited higher accuracy in comparison to the standalone
    ML models. The standalone ML methods also showcased respectable accuracy, albeit
    slightly below the level achieved by the BMA approach. Evaluation indices consistently
    highlighted the outstanding performance of the suggested BMA-based heterogeneous
    ensemble technique, even though performance marginally declined as forecast horizons
    increased. The ensemble approach based on BMA notably enhanced the accuracy of
    GWL forecasts across various lead times, with particularly notable improvement
    for 1-week ahead forecasts than the 2- and 3-week ahead forecasts at the observation
    wells. This outcome holds promise for forecasting multi-scale processes frequently
    encountered in hydrology and water resources. The amalgamation of ML methods through
    the BMA approach presents a compelling novel framework for GWL forecasting in
    the study area, warranting further exploration in the realm of hydrology and water
    resources, both for short-term and long-term predictive applications. It is worth
    mentioning that this study utilized a dataset covering roughly 35 years, ranging
    from 1983 to 2018. Further validation of the proposed modeling approach can be
    conducted using the most recent dataset obtained from the selected observation
    wells and potentially applied in a future study. Author Contributions Conceptualization,

  description: 'The knowledge of crop evapotranspiration is crucial for several hydrological
    processes, including those related to the management of agricultural water sources.
    In particular, the estimations of actual evapotranspiration fluxes within fields
    are essential to managing irrigation strategies to save water and preserve water
    resources. Among the indirect methods to estimate actual evapotranspiration, ETa,
    the eddy covariance (EC) method allows to acquire continuous measurement of latent
    heat flux (LE). However, the time series of EC measurements are sometimes characterized
    by a lack of data due to the sensors'' malfunctions. At this aim, Machine Learning

    series. In this paper, the ML technique was applied using the Gaussian Process
    Regression (GPR) algorithm to fill gaps in daily actual evapotranspiration. The
    technique was tested in six different plots, two in Italy, three in the United
    States of America, and one in Canada, with different crops and climatic conditions
    in order to consider the suitability of the ML model in various contexts. For
    each site, the climate variables were not the same, therefore, the performance
    of the method was investigated on the basis of the available information. Initially,
    a comparison of ground and reanalysis data, where both databases were available,
    and between two different satellite products, when both databases were available,
    have been conducted. Then, the GPR model was tested. The mean and the covariance
    functions were set by considering a database of climate variables, soil water
    status measurements, and remotely sensed vegetation indices. Then, five different
    combinations of variables were analyzed to verify the suitability of the ML approach

    procedure. The model performances were assessed based on the statistical indicators:
    Root Mean Square Error (RMSE), coefficient of determination (R2), Mean Absolute
    Error (MAE), regression coefficient (b), and Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency coefficient

  explanation: In this article, scientists assess the effectiveness of a machine learning
    (ML) algorithm called Gaussian Process Regression (GPR) to fill data gaps in time-series
    data for daily actual evapotranspiration (ETa) of various crops in different climatic
    conditions. ETa refers to the amount of water lost from plants and the soil through
    evaporation and transpiration. Accurate ETa data is essential for efficient irrigation
    management and ensuring optimal crop yields. Filling data gaps in ETa time-series
    data allows for a more complete and reliable dataset, which is crucial for irrigation
    scheduling and water resource management.

    1. Introduction The 2030 United Nations Agenda for Sustainable Development Goals
    (SDGs) supports action to bring good and healthy living conditions for the world
    population. Agriculture 4.0 is the last advancement in farming technology, based
    on four main pillars: increasing productivity, sustainable use of natural resources,
    resilience to climate change, and reducing food waste (Zhai et al., 2020). Regarding
    the sustainable use of natural resources, optimization of irrigation systems plays
    a key role because agriculture uses around 70% of the global freshwater consumption
    (United Nations, 2021). To improve water use in agriculture, political actions
    and institutional interventions should be finalized to regulate the pricing policies
    from one side and, from the other, farmers should improve water use efficiency
    for food production through management optimization which depends, among the other
    factors, from the correct estimation of crop water requirement. According to the
    FAO-56 model (Allen et al., 1998), crop water requirements depend on actual crop
    evapotranspiration (ETa), which is composed of two different terms: actual plant
    transpiration (Ta) and soil evaporation (Ea). For a given crop type and phenological
    stage, ETa is governed by the atmospheric evaporative demand and soil water availability.
    Agro-hydrological models based on the soil water balance, SWB, (Van Dam et al.,
    1997, Marletto et al., 2007, Pereira et al., 2020) or surface energy balance models,
    SEB (Bastiaanssen et al., 1998, Awada et al., 2019) have been extensively applied
    to assess actual crop evapotranspiration. Indirect estimations of actual crop
    evapotranspiration, ETa, can be obtained, according to the single crop coefficient
    approach (Allen et al., 2008), by: (1) in which ETo is the crop reference evapotranspiration,
    Kc is the crop coefficient accounting for the crop phenological stage and, Ks
    is the water stress coefficient depending on soil water availability. Even if
    several models based on the combination of the available climate variables have
    been proposed to estimate ETo, the Penman-Monteith equation has been largely applied
    when standard climatological records (air temperature, solar radiation, wind speed,
    and relative air humidity) are available (Allen et al., 1998). In some regions
    of the world where weather data are unavailable and/or poor, global atmospheric
    models are considered a valid alternative to compensate for the absence or improve
    the quality of data (Rodrigues and Braga, 2021). ERA5 and ERA5-Land (ERA5-L),
    provided by the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF), are
    the last generation of the global reanalysis climate database. Specifically, in
    the ERA5-L the simulated land fields are controlled by a process of atmospheric
    forcing using air temperature (Tair), air humidity and air pressure. The values
    of these variables are corrected considering the altitude difference between the
    grid of the forcing and the higher resolution grid of ERA5-L (Muñoz Sabater, 2019).
    In a recent review presented by Muñoz Sabater et al. (2021), it is possible to
    notice the state-of-the-art associated with the use of ERA5-L for land and environmental
    applications. A climate reanalysis generates large datasets and gives a numerical
    description of the recent climate produced by combining models with observations.
    It contains estimates of atmospheric parameters for all locations on Earth and
    for a long time period. The ERA5 and ERA5-L databases are freely downloadable
    from the internet (https://www.copernicus.eu/en) and are characterized by a spatial
    resolution of 0.25° latitude by 0.25° longitude and 0.10° latitude and 0.10° longitude,
    respectively and a temporal coverage from 1950 up to five days before the real-time.
    In a recent study carried out in Sicily, Pelosi and Chirico (2021) indicated that
    the joint use of ERA5-Land reanalysis and CM-SAF satellite-based radiation data
    is suitable to assess crop reference evapotranspiration, ETo, if ground data were
    not available. For Continental Portugal, Paredes et al. (2018) used daily meteorological
    observations to assess the performance of the ERA-Interim weather variables when
    compared to ground observations and to evaluate the performance of computing daily
    ETo with reanalysis data. The values of crop coefficients Kc (1), for different
    growth stages and management are tabulated in the original FAO-56 manual or more
    recent publications accounting for the research carried out in the last two decades
    (Pereira et al., 2021, Rallo et al., 2021). To avoid the limitations associated
    with the tabular values, satellite images can represent a valid alternative to
    monitor the actual Kc remotely and in a precise way. Pôças et al. (2020) reported
    an exhaustive list of different Kc–Vegetation Indices (VIs) relationships, valid
    for a variety of crops, retrieved based on satellite images acquired by different
    sensors which provide information in the visible (VIS), near-infrared (NIR) and
    shortwave infrared (SWIR) regions. The value of the stress coefficient Ks (1),
    can be determined based on the application of the water balance model, using different
    functions related to the soil water content (Allen et al., 1998). Therefore, the
    joint use of reanalysis and remote sensing data can represent a powerful database
    to retrieve information on climate variables and crop characteristics with spatial
    and temporal resolutions suitable for practical applications. On the other hand,
    direct estimations of ETa can be obtained, at a larger spatial scale, with micrometeorological
    techniques, such as the eddy covariance (EC) system. This technique, largely used
    in various agroforestry systems, allows to measure the vertical turbulent fluxes
    within the atmospheric boundary layers (Cammalleri et al., 2013, Anderson et al.,
    2017, Rozenstein et al., 2019, Corbari et al., 2020, French et al., 2020, Saitta
    et al., 2020). However, the results achievable depend on the quality and the continuity
    of the available energy fluxes time series. The occurrence of acquisition gaps
    of one or more sensors compromises the continuity of actual evapotranspiration
    records; anomalies are generally due to failure, improper installation of the
    sensors or incorrect calibration, as well as the poor maintenance of sensors or
    data logger. Moreover, the occurrence of outliers in time series can also compromise
    the output quality and could generate inconsistent results mainly when model simulations
    are applied. Machine learning (ML) techniques have recently been proposed as suitable
    methods for time series gap-filling. ML algorithms have already been developed
    for the estimation of crop reference evapotranspiration (Jing et al., 2019, Kim
    et al., 2020, Krishnashetty et al., 2021), several authors have been investigating
    the suitability of ML models to predict directly ETa since, in most cases, they
    disposed of long temporal series of data for training and validating the models
    (Granata et al., 2019; Walls et al., 2020; Talib et al., 2021; Mosre and Suárez,
    2021). In particular, Rasmussen and Williams (2006) demonstrated that the ML model
    GPR (Gaussian Process Regression) can allow to retrieval of synthetic temporal
    series even if the availability of training data is limited. The GPR is a non-parametric
    model based on statistical Bayesian theory that can be used to solve supervised
    multivariate regression and classification issues such as high-dimensional, small-sample,
    and nonlinear problems (Rasmussen et al., 2006; Murphy, 2012). Carter and Liang
    (2019) and Mosre and Suárez (2021) demonstrate that the quality of the results
    of ML algorithms application can be improved if the input variables include vegetation
    indices VIs as NDVI, NDWI as well as EVI. The Normalized Difference Vegetation
    Index, NDVI (Rouse et al., 1974) is based on the reflectance in the regions of
    visible (VIS) and near-infrared (NIR), and the Normalized Difference Water Index,
    NDWI (Gao, 1996) consider the reflectance in the regions of NIR and shortwave
    (SWIR): (2) (3) where ρnir, ρred and ρswir are the near-infrared, red and shortwave
    reflectance, respectively. According to Rouse et al. (1974), the authors retrieved
    the near-infrared and red reflectance values in band 5, from 0.6 to 0.7 µm, and
    in band 7, from 0.8 to 1.1 µm, respectively, using ERTS-1 MSS data. On the other
    hand, Gao (1996) used reflectance at 0.86 µm for near-infrared and at 1.24 µm
    for shortwave. As shown by Pagano et al. (2023), the existing literature focused
    on the prediction of actual evapotranspiration ETa, by means ML algorithms, is
    very limited. Moreover, many of the proposed models are site-specific and the
    replicability of the algorithm on different crops and climatic conditions is not
    yet addressed. Instead, in this paper, the performances of the proposed ML algorithm
    to predict actual evapotranspiration are validated on different crops, in different
    climatic conditions and considering different input data sources. Taking into
    account the reasons presented above, the objective of this study was to assess
    the suitability and the performance of the GPR algorithm to fill gaps in the time-series
    of daily actual evapotranspiration (ETa) of different crops acquired in temperate
    e continental zones. To this purpose, data, provided from different sources, were
    considered as input variables, like combinations of ground and remote sensing
    data, and reanalysis data when necessary. That''s why a large part of the work
    consisted in verifying the suitability of the climate variables, comparing ground
    and reanalysis data in those experimental fields where both databases were available.
    Even data retrieved from two different satellites were compared when both databases
    were available. 2. Materials and methods The performances of the GPR algorithm
    have been tested on six experimental fields: two in Italy, three in the United
    States of America, and one in Canada, with different crops and climatic conditions
    in order to consider the suitability of the ML model in various contexts. A comparison
    of ground and reanalysis data have been conducted where both databases were available
    and for one of the experimental filed two satellite databases were compared since
    contemporary Sentinel-2 and MODIS images were available. This last comparison
    has been conducted in order to verify the suitability of the MODIS product, which
    is characterized by a lower spatial resolution than Sentinel-2 product. 2.1. Experimental
    fields The first experimental field is a Mediterranean citrus orchard (Citrus
    reticulata Blanco, cv. Mandarino Tardivo di Ciaculli) of about 0.4 ha, located
    near Palermo, Italy (38° 4’ 53.4’’ N, 13° 25’ 8.2’’ E). Fig. 1 shows the map of
    the field with the position of the sensors and tools installed on the ground.
    The experimental activities were carried out from March 2019 to September 2021.

    of Sicily, Italy (37°38’61’’ N, 12°50’53’’ E), about 5 km far from the town of
    Castelvetrano, is part of a larger irrigation district characterized by a flat
    landscape and rather homogeneous soil and crop types. The experimental activities
    were carried out over three years, from January 2009 to December 2011. More details

    fields, citrus and olive orchard, are characterized by a Hot summer Mediterranean
    climate (Csa) (Kottek et al., 2006), according to the last version of the Köppen
    climatic classification, with rainfall concentrated in fall and winter and quite
    hot and dry summer. The other four sites, with different crops and climatic classifications,
    are reported in Fig. 3. The US_ARM is situated near Billings, Oklahoma, USA (36°
    36’ 20.9’’N, 97° 29’ 19.59’’ O). The main crop grown is hard red winter wheat
    (“common wheat,” Triticum aestivum L., main var. Jaeger, Jagalene, and Fuller)
    with infrequent crop rotations (Fischer et al., 2007, Raz-Yaseef et al., 2015).
    The experimental activities were carried out from January 2005 to December 2010.
    The Köppen climatic classification (Kottek et al., 2006) is Humid subtropical
    climate (Cfa). Download : Download high-res image (645KB) Download : Download

    Nebraska, USA (41° 09’ 54.56’’N, 96° 28’ 35.50 O). This field is irrigated with
    a center pivot system. The site has ten years history of maize-soybean rotation
    under no-till (Suyker, 2022). The experimental activities were carried out from
    January 2001 to December 2020. The Köppen climatic classification (Kottek et al.,
    2006) is Hot summer humid continental climate (Dfa). The fifth site (US_CF1) is
    near Pullman, Washington, USA (46° 46’ 53.53’’N, 117° 4’ 55.50’’ O). The predominant
    crops are winter wheat, spring cereals (barley and wheat), and pulse crops (dry
    pea, lentil, and chickpea). The experimental activities were carried out from
    January 2018 to December 2020. According to the Köppen climatic classification
    (Kottek et al., 2006), the climate is Warm, dry summer continental climate (Dsb).
    The sixth and last site (CA_ER1) is near Guelph, Ontario, Canada (43° 38’ 26.17’’N,
    80° 24’ 44.35 O). This field is an agricultural site where corn is cultivated.
    The site is relatively flat and homogenous. The experimental activities were carried
    out from January 2016 to December 2019. The Köppen climatic classification (Kottek
    et al., 2006) is Warm summer humid continental climate (Dfb). Table 1 summarizes

    data The climatic data were obtained from different sources depending on the availability
    of ground measurements and/or reanalysis data. 2.2.1. Ground measurements In the
    citrus orchard, a WatchDog 2000 (Spectrum Technologies, Inc., Aurora, IL, USA)
    standard weather station (WD) was installed near the field to collect, at half
    hourly steps, precipitation, P [mm], global solar radiation, Rs [W m-2], air temperature,
    T [°C], air relative humidity, RH [%], wind speed [m s-1] and direction [°] at
    2 m height. In the olive orchard, the same climate variables with hourly steps
    were measured by a standard weather station belonging to the Sicilian Agro-meteorological
    Information Service (SIAS) (www.sias.regione.sicilia.it/). For the four American
    and Canadian fields, climate data from ground measurements were not available.
    2.2.2. Reanalysis data Additionally, for all the six fields, hourly reanalysis
    data of air temperature, T [°C], global solar radiation, Rs [W m-2], dew-point
    temperature, Tdew [°C], and wind speed measured at 10 m above the ground, Ws10
    [m s-1], were also downloaded from the ERA5-Land (ERA5-L) database (Muñoz Sabater,
    2019), available in the climate change service portal provided by Copernicus,
    with the resolution of the spatial grid of 0.1° latitude and 0.1° longitude. (https://cds.climate.co1pernicus.eu/cdsapp#!/home).
    The hourly relative air humidity, RH [%], not available in the reanalysis database,
    was calculated as (Allen et al., 1998): (4) where and are the actual and saturated
    vapor pressure corresponding at dew-point, Tdew, and actual air temperature, T,
    respectively. Moreover, the hourly wind speed at 2 m above the ground, Ws2 [m
    s-1], was calculated based on the wind speed at the height z retrieved by the
    ERA5-L database, assuming valid the logarithmic wind speed profile (Allen et al.,
    1998): (5) where Ws2 and Wsz are the wind speed at 2 m and z m above the soil
    surface. For ERA5-L, z is equal to 10 m. Considering the aim of this study, all
    the weather variables at the half hourly and hourly time steps were then aggregated
    at the daily time step. 2.2.3. Quality assurance and quality control The quality
    assurance procedures applied to the Italian ground climate measurements, provided
    by the WatchDog and SIAS stations, are reported in Fiebrich et al. (2010). The
    quality of ERA5-Land data was evaluated by direct comparison to many in situ observations
    collected mainly for the period 2001–2018, as well as by comparison to additional
    model or satellite-based global reference datasets (Muñoz-Sabater et al., 2021).
    2.3. Micrometeorological data Micrometeorological data were retrieved from Eddy
    Covariance towers for the Italian orchards as well as from the AmeriFlux network
    for the Canadian and American orchards. 2.3.1. Italian fields In both the Italian
    experimental fields, actual evapotranspiration, ETa [mm], was estimated by an
    Eddy Covariance flux tower (EC). More details regarding the equipment of the EC
    towers in the citrus and olive orchard are reported in Ippolito et al. (2022)
    and in Cammalleri et al. (2013), respectively. Sensible, H [W m-2], and latent,
    LE [W m-2], heat fluxes were evaluated as: (6) H=ρ cp σWT (7) LE=λ σWQ where ρ
    [g/m3] is the air density, cp [J g-1 K-1] is the air-specific heat capacity at
    constant pressure, σWT [m K s-1], λ [J g−1] is the latent heat of vaporization
    and σWQ [g m-2 s-1] are the covariance between vertical wind speed and air temperature
    or water vapor density, respectively. All the fluxes were evaluated, using (6),
    (7), with a time step of 30 min using the software developed by Manca (2003).
    All the fluxes at the half hourly time steps were then aggregated at the daily
    time step. 2.3.2. American and Canadian fields The values of latent heat flux
    (LE) for the American and Canadian sites were obtained from the AmeriFlux BASE
    data product (https://ameriflux.lbl.gov). Three sites’ datasets had a half-hourly
    resolution, except the US_Ne1 site, which had an hourly resolution (Biraud et
    al., 2021, Suyker, 2022, Wagner-Riddle, 2021, Phillips and Huggins, 2022). Data
    shared under CC-BY-4.0 licence were downloaded. The LE at the half-hourly and
    hourly time steps were then aggregated at the daily time step. 2.3.3. Quality
    assurance and quality control For the Italian field, the raw EC data were post-processed
    by means of the procedure implemented by Manca (2003), virtually analogous to
    the FLUXNET standard protocol (Mauder et al., 2008; Pastorello et al., 2014; 2020).
    Data de-trending was performed using a running mean, a coordinate rotation was
    applied to the sonic anemometer data to obtain a zero mean vertical and transversal
    wind speeds, and correction for spectral loss was performed. In addition, adjustments
    for high wind speeds on sonic temperature and Webb–Pearman–Leuning corrections
    for water vapor were applied (Moncrieff et al., 1997) before the final computation
    of half-hourly fluxes. The method suggested by Prueger et al. (2005), based on
    the Closure Ratio (CR), was used to assess the surface energy balance closure.
    When the energy storage in the soil is neglected, CR represents the slope of the
    regression line between the available energy given by the variance of the net
    radiation, Rn, and the soil heat flux, G, and the covariance of the turbulent
    heat fluxes (LE + H) only evaluated from the subset of half hourly data corresponding
    to Rn ≥ 100 W m-2: (8) To guarantee the consistency of the daily data, only the
    days with 48 half-hourly measurements were considered. AmeriFlux BASE data Quality
    Assurance (QA) and quality control (QC) follow the methodology adopted for processing
    the FLUXNET2015 dataset (Pastorello et al., 2014). The data for each site goes
    through QA and QC steps tailored to the generation of these derived data products.
    A few of these QA and QC steps are described in Pastorello et al. (2020). They
    provide a processing flowchart, which describes all the processing that is applied.
    Data QA and QC assesses units and sign conventions, timestamp alignments, trends,
    step changes, outliers based on site-specific historical ranges, multivariate
    comparisons, diurnal/seasonal patterns, friction velocity filtering, and variable
    availability. Quality checks are done over single variables, multiple/combined
    variables, or more specialized tests. 2.4. Monitoring soil water contents Only
    in the citrus orchard, the temporal dynamics of soil water content (SWC) were
    monitored with four \"drill & drop\" probes (Sentek Pty Ltd, Stepney, Australia),
    installed at a distance of 0.8 m from the trees’ trunks and 0.3 m apart from one
    emitter. These sensors, based on the frequency-domain reflectometry (FDR) technique
    (Gaskin and Miller, 1996), allowed measuring apparent soil dielectric permittivity,
    whose values are strongly influenced by the monitoring SWC, at each 0.1 m depth,
    from the soil surface to 0.6 m depth, with a time step of about 30 min. FDR sensors
    have been extensively used to monitor SWC (Burgess et al., 2006, Sun et al., 2014,
    Singh et al., 2019, Campora et al., 2020). The \"drill & drop\" sensor’s response
    is represented by the scaled frequency, which includes the raw counts in air,
    water, and soil. The probes calibration equations for the different soils were
    obtained directly in the field. The probes were normalized, according to the recommendation
    of the manufacturer, to convert the raw counts, corresponding to the actual water
    content, into scaled frequency (SF). To determine SF, the frequencies in air and
    water were also acquired: (9) where Fa is the raw count in air, Fs is the raw
    count in the soil, and Fw is the raw count in water. The manufacturer also provides
    a standard calibration power relationship that allows to retrieve SWC, expressed
    in cm3 cm-3, value starting from the SF values measured by the sensor: (10) SWC
    = α SFβ where α and β are the coefficients of the general equation proposed by
    the manufacturer, equal to 0.494 and 3.017, respectively. 2.5. Vegetation indices
    (VIs) Sentinel-2 scenes and Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS)
    nadir reflectances time series were used to calculate the NDVI as well as the
    NDWI. Matlab® R2021b and QGIS version 3.4.3 were jointly used to process the images
    and evaluate both vegetation indices. 2.5.1. Sentinel-2 Since the Copernicus mission
    started operations in 2018 spring and the experiments started in 2019 winter,
    the spatio-temporal variability of vegetation indices for the citrus orchard was
    investigated only by using the Sentinel-2 multispectral images level 2 A. Instead,
    since the experimental period in the olive orchard is prior to 2018, it was not
    possible to use the Sentinel-2 data. However, for this experimental field, it
    was decided to use the Sentinel-2 images, available for the years 2019–2021, to
    test the reliability of the MODIS data. The images were downloaded and pre-processed
    using the R package toolbox “sen2r” (Ranghetti et al., 2020) In the period from
    2019 to 2021, 191 and 65 available clear-sky scenes were selected for the citrus
    and the olive orchards, respectively; the near-infrared, red and shortwave reflectance
    were detected in the bands B08 ranging from 785 to 899 nm, B04 from 650 to 680 nm,
    and B11 from 1565 to 1655 nm of the Sentinel- 2 electromagnetic spectrum. Based
    on (2), (3), maps of NDVI and NDWI with a spatial resolution of 10 m, were generated.
    To downscale the maps of NDWI at 10 m resolution, the value of a single pixel
    in the shortwave region (20 m resolution) was associated with the corresponding
    four values in the near-infrared region (10 m resolution). A continuous time series
    of daily VIs were obtained based on linear interpolations carried out between
    consecutive pairs of Sentinel-2 images acquired at two different dates (Pan et
    al., 2017). 2.5.2. Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) Moderate
    Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) MCD43A3 Version 6 product (MCD43A
    v006) (Schaaf and Wang, 2015) was considered to obtain time-series of nadir reflectance
    at the different wavelengths for all the experimental fields, except for citrus
    orchard. The continuous time series of MODIS nadir reflectance were downloaded
    using the Google Earth Engine (GEE) platform. The near-infrared, red and shortwave
    reflectance were detected respectively in band B2 ranging from 841 to 876 nm,
    in band B1 ranging from 620 to 670 nm and in band B6, from 1628 to 1652 nm of
    the MODIS electromagnetic spectrum. 2.5.3. Sentinel-2 vs MODIS As previously mentioned,
    for the olive orchard, a comparison between Sentinel-2 and MODIS images was carried
    out in the period 2019–2021 to verify the suitability of MODIS images for estimate
    the vegetation indices NDVI e NDWI since this product is characterized by a spatial
    resolution very lower than the Sentinel-2 one. The results demonstrated that MODIS
    images can be considered suitable for the investigated areas since are quite homogeneous
    in terms of soil and crop types (Autovino et al., 2016). 2.6. Gaussian Process
    Regression (GPR) algorithm To estimate the missing data in the ETa time series,
    the Gaussian Process Regression (GPR) model was exploited for its power, among
    other machine learning algorithms, to make predictions relying on a few parameters.
    The model establishes a relation between the independent input variables, xi,
    (climatic variables, soil water status, and VIs), and the dependent variable,
    y, represented by the actual crop evapotranspiration. Specifically, the regression
    model built by the GPR is: (11) y ∼ N(m(x), k(x’x’)) where x and y denote the
    input and output in the training dataset and f(x) is known as latent variable
    in the GPR model, and is the noisy observations of the true function expressed
    as a normal distribution characterized by a mean equal to zero and variance estimated
    from the data. The Gaussian process can be defined by its mean m(x) and covariance
    kernel k(x,x’) functions, represented respectively by a vector and a matrix in
    the form: (12) (13) The mean (basis) function of the GPR model can be assumed
    constant, with a value set to zero, equal to the mean of the training dataset,
    or by using a linear function. The kernel (covariance) function represents a geometrical
    distance measure assuming that the more closely located inputs would be more correlated
    in terms of their function values. The covariance kernel function can be assumed
    as rational quadratic, squared exponential, exponential, or using a Matern kernel.
    More details on the GPR model can be found in Rasmussen and Williams (2006). To
    identify the best m(x) and k(x,x’) functions, the machine learning model based
    on the GPR was implemented by using a Matlab® script, which was used to test fifteen
    possible combinations of the mean and covariance kernel functions: three mean
    functions (Zero, Constant, and Linear) and five covariance kernel functions (Squared
    Exponential, Matern 5/2, Matern 3/2, Rational Quadratic, and Exponential). The
    Squared Exponential kernel, also called Gaussian kernel or RBF kernel, is defined
    as (Rasmussen and Williams, 2006): (14) where can be regarded as the squared Euclidean
    distance between two eigenvectors and σS, λS and σε are three hyperparameters.
    controls the marginal variance of f(x) and is referred to as variance parameter,
    which is used to characterize the deviation of the fitting function from the signal
    mean value. When is small, the fitting function deviates from the signal mean
    value slightly. When is large, the fluctuation of the fitting function will become
    larger (Pan et al., 2021). λS is the relative characteristic length scale, which
    is used to describe the smoothness of the function. When λS is small, the dynamic
    response performance of the fitting function is better than when it is high, but
    it is accompanied by the risk of overshooting; when λS is large, the resultant
    function tends to be smooth. represent the measurement error. X is the indicator
    function. The Matern function kernel is named by Stein (1999) after the work of
    Matern (1986). It can be written as: (15) where υ is a chosen parameter equals
    to (p + ½), the definitions of σM and λM are like those of σS and λS, where the
    subscripts indicate the reference to the kernel function name. Γ is the Gamma
    function. The Matern kernel is characterized by the parameter υ. According to
    Rasmussen and Williams (2006), we set υ equal to 3/2 and 5/2. The Rational Quadratic
    kernel can be treated as a scale mixture of Squared Exponential kernels with the
    different characteristic length-scales (Rasmussen and Williams, 2006): (16) The
    hyperparameters σR, λR and σε are like those in the definition of Squared Exponential
    and Matern, where the subscripts indicate the reference to the kernel function
    name. Rational Quadratic has a positive-valued scale-mixture parameter αR that
    can determine the relative weighting of large-scale and small-scale variances.
    Rational Quadratic kernel is equivalent to a scale mixture of Squared Exponential
    kernels with different relative characteristic length scales (Roberts et al.,
    2013). The rational quadratic kernel has a wide scope, which could help the prediction
    performance also when small input database is used and to improve the generalization
    ability and the dynamic response performance (Yang et al., 2022, Shi et al., 2022).
    Finally, the mathematical formula of the Exponential kernel is as follow (Rasmussen
    and Williams, 2006): (17) The hyperparameters σf, λf and σε are defined previously,
    where the subscripts indicate the reference to the kernel function name. This
    analysis was carried out by considering the complete dataset of the input variables
    acquired in the citrus orchard including: i) the standard weather variables: global
    solar radiation (Rs), air temperature (T), relative air humidity (RH), and, wind
    speed measured at 2 m height (Ws2); ii) the Soil Water Content (SWC), expressive
    of the soil water status; iii) two vegetation indices (VIs), such as NDVI and
    NDWI, accounting for the characteristics of the vegetation, with impact on the
    crop coefficient Kc (Lei and Yang, 2014, Pôças et al., 2020). Once identified
    the best m(x) and k(x,x’) functions, using the complete database, four different
    possible combinations of the input variables were considered to reduce the computational
    burden. Table 2 summarizes the combinations of the investigated variables used
    as input, to run the model; where the first combination is used to find the best
    mean and kernel functions; instead, the other four to reduce the computational
    burden. The first combination contains the complete dataset that was also used
    to select the m(x) and k(x,x’) functions. The second and the third combinations
    excluded, respectively, the VIs, and the SWCs, whose values are not always available.
    The fourth combination considers only the agrometeorological variables, whereas
    the last combination included only variables acquired from remote platforms and
    available online, such as the agrometeorological variables and the VIs. Table

    Empty Cell Normalized Difference Water Index NDWI [-] To assess the model suitability
    using the best m(x) and k(x,x’) functions previously retrieved, for the olive
    orchard, only the last three variables’ combinations due to the unavailability
    of SWC measurements, were tested; instead, for the fields located in the USA and
    Canada only the 5th combination was evaluated. For these applications, the VIs
    were retrieved from the MODIS sensor. 2.7. N-fold cross-validation and statistical
    indicators The best combination of m(x) and k(x,x’) functions, as well as the
    performances associated with the other variables combinations, were evaluated
    using the N-fold cross-validation (Mosteller et al., 1968). Cross-validation is
    a statistical method in which the database is randomly divided into N different
    groups, each one containing the records corresponding to the natural number closest
    to , in which Nt is the total number of records. Model validation follows an iterative
    procedure in which a group is used as test set, while the other N-1 groups are
    used for training. The procedure is stopped after N iterations and therefore after
    using each group as test set. This iterative statistical analysis reduces the
    possibility of overfitting problems (Nguyen et al., 2021) occurring when the model
    fits well the training data but fails in the prediction phase due to the noise
    or random fluctuations in the training data (Namasudra et al., 2021). In this
    study, the value of N was set up as equal to five and therefore 80% of the entire
    database was used for training, while the remaining 20% was used for testing purposes.
    The suitability of m(x) and k(x,x’) functions, as well as the performance of the
    GPR model with the other four different variables combinations were assessed based
    on the following statistical indicators: i) the Root Mean Square Error (RMSE,
    mm d-1) whose target value is zero if there are no differences between simulated
    and observed values; ii) the coefficient of determination (R2, dimensionless)
    whose unitary target indicates that the variance of the observed values is totally
    explained by the model (Eisenhauer, 2003); iii) the Mean Absolute Error (MAE,
    mm d-1) representing the distance between the predicted and observed values, with
    a target of zero; iv) the regression coefficient (b, dimensionless), whose target
    is one, representing the angular coefficient of the regression line between simulated
    and observed values forced to the origin; v) the Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency coefficient
    (NSE, dimensionless), whose target values is one; a value of this indicator between
    0.0 and 1.0 indicates an acceptable model performance, whereas a negative value
    indicates that the mean of observed values is a better predictor than the simulated
    ones and therefore the performance is unacceptable (Nash and Sutcliffe, 1970).
    For each iteration, all the statistical indicators were evaluated. Finally, the
    model performances were analyzed as the mean of all the N performed iterations.
    3. Input data analysis Before the algorithm application, a comparison between
    ground and reanalysis data was conducted. This analysis, realized in the citrus
    orchard, where both databases were available, allowed to evaluate the suitability
    of reanalysis climate variables when ground data are not available. Then, the
    series of actual evapotranspiration values for each experimental field were estimated
    and the consistencies of these series were analyzed to evaluate the percentage
    of missing data for each site. Finally, for the olive orchard, as previously mentioned,
    a comparison between the NDVI and NDWI retrieved from Sentinel-2 and MODIS was
    evaluated in order to verify the suitability of MODIS images to estimate the VIs.
    3.1. Ground vs reanalysis data Fig. 4 shows the scatterplots between ground, acquired
    by the citrus orchard WD weather station, and reanalysis observations, retrieved
    by ERA5-L database, of global solar radiation, Rs (a), average air temperature,
    Tavg (b), relative air humidity, RHavg (c), and wind speed measured at 2 m above
    the soil surface, Ws2 (d). The colored bar indicates the day of the solar year
    (DOY). Rs values retrieved from the ERA5-L product were slightly overestimated
    (b = 1.03; RMSE = 32.68 W m-2), being the relatively higher differences associated
    with the lower Rs values, mostly concentrated during winter (blue and red dots)
    (Fig. 4a). The average air temperature Tavg retrieved by the ERA5-L database resulted
    slightly underestimated if compared with the ground measurements (b = 0.93; RMSE
    = 2.25 °C). In this case, the underestimation was distributed along the year (Fig.
    4b). In Fig. 4c, the point cloud is larger than the previous one, and the red
    and blue points, corresponding to the wet seasons, stay up the 1:1 line, while
    the yellow and orange points, stay under the1:1 line. Therefore, RHavg evaluated
    based on the ERA5-L records is lightly overestimated in the wet season and underestimated
    in the dry season, since RMSE value is equal to 8.64%. Finally, the wind speed
    values at 2 m height, calculated from the ERA5-L reanalysis data referred at 10 m
    height by assuming a logarithmic wind profile, resulted generally higher than
    the ground measurements (Fig. 4d), with a coefficient of the regression line passing
    through the origin equal to b = 2.00 and RMSE value equal to 1.43 m s-1. Download

    a,d. Comparison between a) daily global solar radiation, Rs, b) average air temperature,
    Tavg, c) average air relative humidity, RHavg, and d) wind speed measured at 2 m
    above the ground, Ws2, registered by the weather station installed in the citrus
    orchard and retrieved by the reanalysis data. The colored bar indicates the day
    of the year (DOY). Similar results for all the climate variables were obtained
    by Vanella et al. (2022) for the weather station installed near the olive orchard
    for which the comparisons with the ERA5-L data led to RMSE values respectively
    of 30.31 W m-2 for Rs, 1.37 °C for Tavg, 9.72% for RHavg and 1.54 m s-1 for Ws2,
    air temperature. Vanella et al. (2022) considered acceptable these results because
    of ERA5-L provided daily ETo estimates with good accuracy. Therefore, in the examined
    area, reanalysis database such as the ERA5-L can be considered a suitable surrogate
    of the ground data, as evaluated by several authors for most weather stations
    installed in Sicily (Pelosi and Chirico, 2021, Vanella et al., 2022). 3.2. Micrometereological
    data The scatterplots between the turbulent heat fluxes, H+LE, as a function of
    the available energy, Rn-G measured by the EC tower installed in the citrus orchard
    at the half hourly time step, for each of the three years, were already evaluated
    in Pagano et al. (2023). The slope of the regression line passing through the
    origin represents the closure ratio, CR, whose values resulted in satisfactory
    and equal to 0.98, 0.88 and 1.03 for 2019, 2020 and 2021, respectively. For the
    olive orchard, the values of CR were estimated equal to 0.90 for 2009, 0.92 for
    2010 in Cammalleri et al. (2013), and 1.02 for 2011 in Autovino et al. (2016).
    For tree crops, Kustas et al. (1999) considered acceptable values of CR ranging
    between 0.80 and 0.90 even if values of CR equal to 1.08 and 1.03, were obtained
    by Er-Raki et al. (2009) in two citrus orchards in south Morocco characterized
    by a semi-arid Mediterranean climate. The CR estimates for the two fields conformed
    to the values found in the literature and are therefore considered reliable. Table
    3 summarizes the lack of data percentage for each field. Table 3. Lack of data

    5 shows the comparison between the NDVI and NDWI retrieved from Sentinel-2 (black
    line) and MODIS (red line) products for the olive orchard. The Sentinel-2 VIs,
    with the corresponding standard deviations, were obtained through zonal statistics
    considering all the Sentinel-2 pixels contained within the pixel MODIS. The major
    differences between the two VIs are concentrated during falls and winters (red
    and blue dots in the scatter plots on the right) probably due to the presence
    of ground weeds that grow after rain events (Ippolito et al., 2022), which can
    be detected with the Sentinel-2 images and not with the MODIS ones. The generally
    good agreements between the NDVI (b = 0.95: R2 =0.99) and NDWI (b = 0.88; R2 =
    0.96) obtained from the two different platforms strongly depend on the homogeneity
    of soil and land characterizing the MODIS pixel (Autovino et al., 2016). Download

    4. Results and discussion Once the input data as well as the actual evapotranspiration
    have been estimated, the GPR algorithm was tested. The best mean, m(x), and kernel
    covariance, k(x,x’), functions were assessed by the complete dataset related to
    the citrus orchard, which includes all the examined variable (see combination
    1 in Table 2). Table 4 summarizes the statistical indicators associated with the
    fifteen combinations of the examined m(x) and k(x,x’) functions, whereas Fig.
    6 illustrates the scatterplots of the corresponding measured versus estimated
    actual evapotranspiration values when considering the complete database of the
    input variables and implementing the best and the worst m(x) and k(x,x’) functions
    in the GPR model. Table 4. Statistical indicators for mean, m(x), and kernel covariance,

    Fig. 6. a,b. Scatterplots of estimated versus measured ETa obtained for the citrus
    orchard when considering the complete dataset (Combination 1) and assuming the
    best (a) and the worst (b) combination of the mean and kernel covariance functions.
    RMSE values for the best and the worst combination are equal to 0.38 mm d-1 and
    0.45 mm d-1, respectively. Despite the fairly limited differences in terms of
    the examined statistical indicators, the best result was obtained when assuming
    a zero mean function and an exponential kernel covariance function. Under these
    assumptions, the estimations of ETa resulted characterized by RMSE = 0.38 mm d-1
    and MAE = 0.28 mm d-1. On the other hand, the worst result, characterized by RMSE
    = 0.45 mm d-1 and MAE = 0.32 mm d-1 was obtained when assuming a constant m(x)
    and a squared exponential k(x,x’). In general, however, regardless of the m(x)
    and k(x,x’) functions, the model estimates quite well the daily actual evapotranspiration
    (NSE > 0.83). Therefore, for the other variables’ combinations and in all the
    other fields, the suitability of the ML model was tested using the best m(x),
    and, k(x,x’) functions, that is zero mean function, and an exponential kernel
    covariance functions, respectively. For the other combinations of the input variables
    (see combinations 2÷5 in Table 2), Fig. 7 shows the scatterplots of measured versus
    estimated daily ETa by implementing in the GPR model the best m(x) and k(x,x’)
    functions; the estimated values are in better agreement with the measured ones
    in fall and winter days (blue and red dots). In spring and summer days (yellow,
    green, and cyan dots), the dispersion increases for values higher than about 2.5 mm
    d-1. For the citrus orchard, Table 5 summarizes the statistical indicators associated
    with the GPR model implemented with the best m(x) and k(x,x’) functions and the
    five input variables’ combinations. As can be observed, whatever is the variable
    combination there is always an underestimation of actual evapotranspiration with
    slopes of the regression lines declining from 0.97 to 0.95 as the number of variables
    decreases. The RMSE and MAE values increase from 0.43 mm d-1 to 0.55 mm d-1 and
    from 0.31 mm d-1 to 0.42 mm d-1, respectively. As well as, the R2 and NSE values
    decrease from 0.84 to 0.74, for both the statistical indicators. Download : Download

    variable combination, involving the measured soil water content SWC (combination
    2) resulted in a better model performance than including the two vegetation indices
    (combination 3), as demonstrated by the lower RMSE and MAE and the higher R2,
    b and NSE values. The possibility to include measurements of SWC among the input
    variables to improve the estimations of actual evapotranspiration was also indicated
    by Granata (2019). On the other hand, also the introduction of the VIs improved
    the model performances, as shown by Carter and Liang (2019) and Mosre and Suárez
    (2021). The worst performances were associated with combination 5, in which all
    the input variables are detected from information freely available online. However,
    even if compared to the others, the statistical parameters evidenced that the
    joint use of reanalysis and remote sensing data can still be considered acceptable
    for practical applications related to irrigation management, considering that
    all the required input data can be downloaded from the web, avoiding costly and
    time-consuming field measurements in areas where ground data are not available.
    According to Faramiñán et al. (2021) and Kang et al. (2019) the use of reanalysis
    and remoted sensed data could be a good alternative to retrieve ETa with ML techniques.
    Similar good results were obtained when considering the daily actual evapotranspiration
    data collected in the olive orchard. Even if the available database did not include
    measurements of SWC, it permitted a further validation of the proposed ML algorithm
    by considering only the three variable combinations including the weather data
    and VIs. Fig. 8 shows the scatterplots between measured and estimated ETa by assuming
    a zero mean function and an exponential kernel covariance function and the three
    combinations of the input variables. The estimated values are in better agreement
    with the measured ones in fall and winter days (blue and red dots). The dispersion
    increases for values higher than about 3 mm d-1. The statistical indicators associated
    with the three different variable combinations are summarized in Table 6. As can
    be observed, combinations 3 and 5 are characterized by quite similar results.
    This result is a consequence of the good performance of the ERA5-L in depicting
    the agrometeorological data measured on the ground nearby the olive orchard (Vanella
    et al., 2022). Slightly worse results were associated with combination 4 in which
    only measured weather data were used as input of the model. Download : Download

    involves the American and Canadian sites, located in different climate zones,
    returns good performances. The approach was tested using only remote sensed data

    ETa of daily actual evapotranspiration by assuming a zero mean function and an
    exponential kernel covariance function and the fifth combination of the input
    variables for each field. As can be noticed, the points are distributed differently
    according to the different climate classifications. As shown in Table 7, the RMSE
    values are in good agreement with the ones obtained in the other climatic zones.
    The values are always lower than 0.57 mm d-1. Finally, the NSE values ranging
    from 0.70 to 0.87 confirm the model''s possibility to estimate actual evapotranspiration

    the NSE values were also evaluated by splitting the database in two. The division
    was done considering the cold seasons, fall and winter days, and the warm seasons,
    spring and summer days. The first included DOYs from 1 to 92 and from 275 to 366;
    the second from 93 to 274. The results, shown in Table 8, demonstrated that the
    model performances are better, in many cases, during the warm seasons than in
    the cold season. For two sites, US_ARM and US_CF1, the results are the best in
    the cold seasons but are also good in the others. For the warm seasons, these
    values are encouraging because these could permit good performance in the irrigation
    water management. Table 8. Seasonal NSE values. Empty Cell NSE [-] Empty Cell

    this study, the use of the Gaussian Process Regression (GPR) algorithm to fill
    gaps in the time series of daily actual evapotranspiration was investigated for
    six different sites located in different climates zone. Initially, a detailed
    analysis of the available data, the methodologies, and tools adopted for the estimation
    of ETa and the possible variables on which its value depends was carried out.
    In particular, a comparison between ground and reanalysis databases was made,
    which allowed to evaluate the suitability of reanalysis climate variables when
    ground data are not available. Two different satellites product, with different
    spatial resolutions, were compared, in order to analyze the possibility of use
    VIs, retrieved from images with a lower spatial resolution, when no other products
    are available. Five different combinations of variables were considered to verify
    the suitability of the ML approach when limited input data are available Then,
    the GPR model was tested. Initially, the best combination of mean, m(x), and kernel
    covariance, k(x,x’), functions were identified considering all the input variables
    associated with the climate, soil water status as well as two vegetation indices
    expressive of plant vigor and surface water status in the citrus orchard where
    all the variables were available. Then, four additional variable combinations
    were also explored for the same orchard, to verify the performance of the estimation
    when limiting the number of input variables or considering only input variables
    freely downloadable from the web. Further validation of the proposed ML algorithm
    with the three variable combinations not including SWC was carried out in the
    second experimental field, the olive orchard. Finally, the approach was also applied
    using only remote sensed data for the experimental sites, located in different
    climate zones, in the United States of America and Canada. The goodness of the
    proposed methodology is always confirmed by the quite high NSE index and by the
    low values of RMSE. Therefore, the joint use of agrometeorological and remote
    sensing data with a GPR model can represent an opportunity to estimate missing
    data in the daily ETa time series. Furthermore, in the zone where ground data
    are not available, the use of ERA5-Land agrometeorological archive and VIs retrieved
    from Sentinel-2 images or, in areas characterized by homogeneous soil and land
    use, from MODIS sensors can be considered a valid alternative to fill gaps in
    measured time series of daily actual evapotranspiration. Reliable values of actual
    evapotranspiration obtained using the proposed ML algorithm, allow for the estimation
    of accurate values of crop water requirements to improve water use in agriculture.
    Future studies will assess the performance in ETa estimations associated with
    the introduction, as an input variable, of high-resolution satellite-based soil
    moisture products. Declaration of Competing Interest The author declares that

  description: The authors of this study investigated the use of machine learning
    (ML) and feature engineering (FE) techniques to accurately determine FAO reference
    evapotranspiration (ETo) with a minimal number of climate variables being measured.
    The recommended techniques for areas with insufficient measurements are based
    solely on daily temperature readings. Various ML methods were tested to evaluate
    how sophisticated an ML algorithm is for this task necessary. The main emphasis
    was on feature engineering, which involves converting raw variables into inputs
    better suited for ML algorithms, resulting in improved results. FE methods for
    estimating evapotranspiration include approximations of clear-sky solar radiation
    based on altitude and Julian day, approximate relative humidity and wind velocity,
    a categorical month variable, and variables interactions. The authors confirmed
    that the ability of ML in such tasks is not solely dependent on choosing the suitable
    algorithm but also on this frequently ignored step. The results of computational
    experiments are presented, accompanied by a comparison of the proposed method
    against standard ETo empiric equations. Machine learning methods, mainly due to
    the transformation of raw variables using FE, provided better results than traditional
    empirical methods and sophisticated ML algorithms without FE. In addition, the
    authors tested the applicability of the developed models in the broader area to
    evaluate the possibility of their generalizability. The potential of this approach
    to deliver improved predictions, reduced input requirements, and increased efficiency
    holds interesting promise for optimizing water management strategies, irrigation

  description: A smart artificial intelligent system (SAIS) for Acinetobacter density
    (AD) enumeration in waterbodies represents an invaluable strategy for avoidance
    of repetitive, laborious, and time-consuming routines associated with its determination.
    This study aimed to predict AD in waterbodies using machine learning (ML). AD
    and physicochemical variables (PVs) data from three rivers monitored via standard
    protocols in a year-long study were fitted to 18 ML algorithms. The models’ performance
    was assayed using regression metrics. The average pH, EC, TDS, salinity, temperature,
    TSS, TBS, DO, BOD, and AD was 7.76 ± 0.02, 218.66 ± 4.76 µS/cm, 110.53 ± 2.36 mg/L,
    0.10 ± 0.00 PSU, 17.29 ± 0.21 °C, 80.17 ± 5.09 mg/L, 87.51 ± 5.41 NTU, 8.82 ±
    0.04 mg/L, 4.00 ± 0.10 mg/L, and 3.19 ± 0.03 log CFU/100 mL respectively. While
    the contributions of PVs differed in values, AD predicted value by XGB [3.1792
    (1.1040–4.5828)] and Cubist [3.1736 (1.1012–4.5300)] outshined other algorithms.
    Also, XGB (MSE = 0.0059, RMSE = 0.0770; R2 = 0.9912; MAD = 0.0440) and Cubist
    (MSE = 0.0117, RMSE = 0.1081, R2 = 0.9827; MAD = 0.0437) ranked first and second
    respectively, in predicting AD. Temperature was the most important feature in
    predicting AD and ranked first by 10/18 ML-algorithms accounting for 43.00–83.30%
    mean dropout RMSE loss after 1000 permutations. The two models' partial dependence
    and residual diagnostics sensitivity revealed their efficient AD prognosticating
    accuracies in waterbodies. In conclusion, a fully developed XGB/Cubist/XGB-Cubist
    ensemble/web SAIS app for AD monitoring in waterbodies could be deployed to shorten
    turnaround time in deciding microbiological quality of waterbodies for irrigation
    and other purposes.

  explanation: 'Machine learning (ML) models are an advanced computational technique
    that can be applied to analyze large datasets, including time series data, to
    identify patterns and predict outcomes. In the context of real-time irrigation
    management, ML models can be trained on historical data to predict future crop
    water requirements based on various input parameters such as weather, soil moisture,
    and crop growth stage. This information can then be used to optimize irrigation
    schedules and improve water use efficiency.


    The specific point of focus described in the review paper is on strategies for
    handling data heterogeneity, uncertainty, and quality issues in real-time insight
    generation. These issues are often encountered in sensor and data acquisition
    systems used for irrigation management. Data heterogeneity refers to the variability
    in data types, formats, and scales that may be collected from different sensors
    and data sources. Uncertainty refers to the presence of noise, missing values,
    or measurement errors in the data, while quality issues can arise from sensor
    malfunctions or data transmission errors.


    To address these challenges and ensure the reliability and accuracy of ML models
    for real-time irrigation management, several strategies can be employed. These
    strategies typically involve data preprocessing and transformation techniques
    to clean and harmonize the data, handle missing values, and reduce noise. Additionally,
    ensemble learning algorithms and advanced statistical methods can be used to enhance
    the robustness and generalization capabilities of the models. By effectively addressing
    data heterogeneity, uncertainty, and quality issues, ML models can be developed
    to provide accurate and reliable real-time insights, enabling farmers and irrigation
    managers to make informed decisions and optimize water usage.'

    Open access 29 June 2022 Introduction Acinetobacter species belong to the group
    of aerobic gram-negative bacteria that are non-motile, non-fermentative, catalase
    positive, oxidase negative encapsulated coccobacilli, having a DNA G+C content
    of 39 to 47 mol1,2. Taxonomically, scientists have identified 68 validated species
    in the genus Acinetobacter, with numerous others yet to be delineated into species3,4,5.
    Many Acinetobacter species are found naturally in different environments, including
    soil, water, air, wastewater, fomites, human skin, animals, and even on plants6,7,8.
    Some species can utilise different substrates, such as amino acids, carbohydrates,
    organic acids, and hydrocarbons, while some can secrete industrial enzymes like
    lipase and protease9,10. However, few species are human opportunistic pathogens.
    For instance, Acinetobacter baumannii is a well-known notorious species in hospital
    settings that cause life-threatening infections such as pneumonia, respiratory
    and urinary tract infections, septicaemia, and wound infections, among others,
    especially in immune-compromised patients11,12,13. Acinetobacter species are widely
    spread via the environmental milieu and may alarmingly spread antimicrobial resistance
    genes in the environment14,15. In addition, wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs)
    feed by hospital and municipal wastewater inflows have been reported to contribute
    multidrug-resistant (MDR), and extensively drug-resistant (XDR) Acinetobacter
    isolates to their effluents receiving waterbodies compared with other sources15,16.
    Discharging WWTP effluents increases the prevalence of Acinetobacter in the receiving
    river waterbodies and promotes antimicrobial resistance and transmission to irrigated
    vegetables15. The transmission of Acinetobacter spp. (especially A. baumannii)—with
    high antimicrobial resistance and case fatality ratio—onto fresh produce has been
    demonstrated and reviewed by Carvalheira et al.17. Acinetobacter species with
    different resistant capabilities ranging from MDR to XDR have been isolated in
    fresh fruits and vegetables (apples, cabbages, melons, cauliflowers, peppers,
    mushrooms, lettuce, cucumbers, bananas, radishes, sweet corn carrots, potatoes,
    peach, pear, strawberry, apple, celery, tomato, and radish) at a density up to
    50–1000 CFU/g18 in Hong Kong19, France20, Nigeria21, Lebanon22, Portugal23 and
    agricultural environment in Algeria24. Furthermore, waterbodies especially rural
    rivers for instance, support recreational use of considerably high levels by people
    incognizant of the inflow/inputs of WWTP effluents and the influx of multidrug-resistant
    pathogens of public health concern including Acinetobacter25. The routine experimental
    determination and identification of Acinetobacter species and other bacteria in
    all matrices (water, food, and clinical samples, etc.) using most probable number,
    direct plate count, adenosine triphosphate testing, and membrane filtration methods
    are usually laborious, repetitive, time-consuming (incubation period), and cost-intensive
    endeavours that required expert knowledge which might not be readily available
    in most settings. Therefore, there is an urgent need for rapid, reliable, and
    cost-effective means that required no or low technical know-how to assess Acinetobacter
    density (AD) in waterbodies and other matrices to ensure short turnaround time
    necessary to make informed microbiological quality decisions. It is hypothesized
    that AD in waterbodies could be predicted accurately and dependably by using machine
    learning intelligence frameworks that depend upon the dynamic’s relationship between
    AD based on the afore determination methods and physicochemical variables of waterbody
    and other matrices in a low-cost and time-effective way. Thus, an artificial intelligence
    system for AD determination in waterbodies receiving WWTP effluents, which are
    subsequently used as irrigation source waters (ISW), would be an invaluable preventive
    option for immediate and future public health challenges. The main merits of ML
    models lie in their capacity to overcome problems associated with traditional
    statistical models in capturing and predicting multidimensional interactions in
    large data by “learning” deep patterns26. ML frameworks and SAIS allow proactive
    management of events rather than reactive. Thus, MLs and SAIS are finding increasing
    applications in many sectors, including medicine, precision farming, environmental
    management, water purification, Vibrio abundance on microplastics, wastewater
    treatment, watershed typologies and stormwater quality and epidemiology prediction26,27,28,29,30
    and the application is endlessly expanding daily. Therefore, the present study
    aimed at predicting/determining AD in waterbodies (receiving hospital, municipal
    and WWTP effluents) using ML without the repetitive, laborious, cost-intensive,
    and time-consuming laboratory routines to reduce the turnaround time essential
    to make informed microbiological quality decisions (e.g., for irrigation use and
    other purposes). Materials and methods Sample collection and in-situ determination
    of physicochemical data Water samples were collected using grab sampling technique
    from the Great Fish River, Keiskamma River and Thyume River, serving as receiving
    waterbodies for municipal and hospital wastewater effluents (MHWE) discharge at
    one or more points along their courses in the Eastern Cape Province, South Africa.
    At least, five strategic sampling locations based on socioeconomic importance
    (e.g., fishing, swimming, nearness to wastewater treatment plants, farming, pasture,
    irrigation, dam etc.) of each river were selected for sample collection. At the
    sampling sites, water temperature (TEMP), pH, total dissolved solids (TDS), electrical
    conductivity (EC), salinity (SAL), and dissolved oxygen (DO) were determined in-situ
    using a standard multi-parameter device (Hanna, model HI 9828) instrumental protocol.
    In addition, the rivers’ turbidity (TBS) was assessed using a turbidimeter (HACH,
    model 2100P). For microbiological analysis and biochemical oxygen demand (BOD)
    measurement, midstream water samples (25–30 cm depth) were collected at the same
    sampling sites in three replicates into sterile glass and amber bottles, respectively
    and stored in iceboxes and transported to the laboratory for analysis with 6 h
    of collection31. After five days of incubation of samples in amber bottles, the
    BOD of the samples was determined using a biochemical oxygen demand meter (HACH,
    HQ 40 days)31. Detailed sampling strategy, sampling points’ description, and study
    area maps were as described in our previous study32. Acinetobacter data acquisition
    The density of Acinetobacter species in the water samples was estimated via membrane
    filtration31. Briefly, 100 ml of serially diluted water samples were filtered
    in three independent iterations using a Ø47 mm 0.45 μm pore-sized cellulose membrane31.
    These membranes were aseptically placed onto freshly prepared Acinetobacter CHROMagar
    plates containing selective supplements (CHROMagar, Paris, France) per the manufacturer’s
    instruction. The plates were incubated at 37 °C for 24 h. All Acinetobacter colonies
    presented as red colouration on CHROMagar plates post-incubation was counted and
    log transformed (log CFU/100 mL). All isolates were purified, validated as oxidase
    negative, and assessed by Acinetobacter-specific polymerase chain reaction. Fifty
    per cent (50%) of glycerol stocks of the pure culture was prepared and stored
    at – 80 °C. Model development Pre-processing and modelling procedure The datasets
    were first subjected to explanatory and bivariate Pearson''s correlation (r) [Eq.
    (1)] analyses. The estimation of 95% confidence intervals (95% CI) of the r-value
    in bivariate correlation analysis was based on Fisher''s r-to-z transformation
    with bias adjustment [Eq. (2)]. To avoid multicollinearity, where the r-value
    between two variables ≥ 0.99, one of them was dropped randomly in subsequent models
    (see Table 2). Any of the two variables can be used in the implementation of the
    models. Also, for models’ implementation, the datasets were centre scaled such
    that the mean = 0 and the square root of the variance = 1 for variables. The dataset
    for DTR was not scaled. $$r=\\sum_{i=1}^{h}({u}_{i}-\\overline{u })({w}_{i}-\\overline{w
    })/\\sqrt{\\sum_{i=1}^{h}{({u}_{i}-\\overline{u })}^{2}}\\sqrt{\\sum_{i=1}^{n}{{(w}_{i}-\\overline{w
    })}^{2}} $$ (1) $$z=\\mathrm{arctanh}\\left(r\\right)= 1/2\\mathrm{log}((1+r)/(1-r))$$
    (2) where r is a Pearson’s correlation coefficient with possible values from − 1
    to 1 inclusive. Here, u and w represent a pair of PVs and h is the sample size.
    Acinetobacter density (AD) was modelled as a dependent variable of the rivers’
    physicochemical variables (PVs). Hence, the conditional expected (CE) AD value
    at instances of PVs consisting of a vector of TEMP, DO, BOD, TSS, SAL, and pH
    is derived as \\({\\mathrm{CE}}_{AD|PVs}(AD)\\). Thus, the estimation of the mean
    AD can be constructed as Eq. (3). $${\\mathrm{CE}}_{AD|PVs}(AD)\\approx f\\left(PVs\\right).$$
    (3) Equation (1) was implemented via 18 regression ML algorithms that have the
    robust capability to fit multidimensional variables of ordinal/continuous outcome,
    including linear regression with stepwise selection (LRSS), an RF, XGB, SVR, linear
    regression (LR), a gradient boosted machine (GBM), neural network (NNT) (6–6–1
    network with 49 weights multiple; decay = 0.1), a KNN (k-nearest neighbour), M5P,
    a boosted regression tree (BRT), a Cubist regression, a decision tree (DTR), multivariate
    adaptive regression splines (MARS), ANN [with one 6-node hidden layers (ANN6),
    extreme learning machine (ELM), two 4- and 2- node hidden layers (ANN42), and
    two 3- and 3-node hidden layers (ANN33), and elastic net (ENR)]. The dataset (540
    observations, 6 variables after explanatory feature selection) was split into
    a learning subset (70%) for the estimate of models’ coefficients and a validation
    subset (30%) for model substantiation. In all the ML implementations of Eq. (1),
    ten different learning-validation dataset pairs were generated via tenfold cross-validation
    accompanied by 3 repeats and 10 tune-lengths. Optimal hyper-parameters were derived
    and selected through a grid search algorithm. Models’ hyper-parameters are provided
    in detail in the supplemental material. Detailed discussion on the strengths and
    weaknesses and previous application of the various algorithms could be found elsewhere
    and their documentation. The explanatory rendition of all variables contributions
    in the models was according to Eq. (4): $$f\\left(w.\\right)= {t}_{0} +\\sum_{j=1}^{p}t\\left(j,w.\\right),$$
    (4) where t(j, w.) denotes the jth variable contribution measure to the model’s
    prediction at instance w and t0 is the average model prediction33. Assessment
    of ML model’s performance The MLI algorithms model’s performance was determined
    against experimental data based on Eqs. (5)–(8): $$\\mathrm{Mean \\, squared}-\\mathrm{error}:
    MSE\\left(f,\\underline{U}, \\underline{w}\\right)=\\frac{1}{h}\\sum_{i}^{h}{\\left({\\widehat{w}}_{i}-{w}_{i}\\right)}^{2}=
    \\frac{1}{h}\\sum_{1}^{h}{r}_{i}^{2}$$ (5) $$\\mathrm{Root}-\\mathrm{mean}-\\mathrm{squared
    \\, error}: RMSE\\left(f,\\underline{U}, \\underline{w}\\right)= \\sqrt{MSE\\left(f,\\underline{U},

    \\frac{MSE\\left(f,\\underline{U}, \\underline{w}\\right)}{MSE\\left({f}_{0},\\underline{U},

    \\underline{w}\\right)=median\\left(\\left|{r}_{1}\\right|, \\ldots , \\left|{r}_{n}\\right|\\right).$$
    (8) where h = number of the sample; f0(): baseline model; ri: residual for the
    ith observation, U: matrix of PVs; \\(\\underline{w}\\): vector of AD; \\(f\\left(\\widehat{\\underline{\\theta
    }},\\underline{U}\\right):\\) model based on the training dataset; \\(\\widehat{\\underline{\\theta

    model’s prediction equivalent to \\({\\mathrm{w}}_{i}\\). RMSE was further employed
    in assessing mean dropout loss for variable importance following 1000 permutation34,35.
    Models’ sensitivity analysis Residual diagnostics and partial-dependence profiles
    of PVs on the predicted AD was generated to assess the model’s sensitivity. The
    partial-dependence profile of a model f() (i.e., anticipated/predicted AD value
    at an instance by the model) and the outcome variable Uj set at s (over the empirical/marginal
    distribution of U-j (h), i.e., the collective distribution of all other PVs without
    Uj ) is created according to Eqs. (9) and (10): $${q}_{P}^{j}\\left(\\mathrm{s}\\right)={E}_{{\\underline{X}}^{-j}}\\left\\{f\\left({U}^{j|=s}\\right)\\right\\}.$$
    (9) $${\\widehat{q}}_{P}^{j}\\left(\\mathrm{s}\\right)=\\frac{1}{h}\\sum_{i=1}^{h}f\\left({\\underline{u}}_{i}^{j|=s}\\right).$$
    (10) The implementation of all models was achieved in R v.4.1.2 software. Results
    A descriptive summary of the physicochemical variables and Acinetobacter density
    of the waterbodies is presented in Table 1. The mean pH, EC, TDS, and SAL of the
    waterbodies was 7.76 ± 0.02, 218.66 ± 4.76 µS/cm, 110.53 ± 2.36 mg/L, and 0.10 ± 0.00
    PSU, respectively. While the average TEMP, TSS, TBS, and DO of the rivers was
    17.29 ± 0.21 °C, 80.17 ± 5.09 mg/L, 87.51 ± 5.41 NTU, and 8.82 ± 0.04 mg/L, respectively,
    the corresponding DO5, BOD, and AD was 4.82 ± 0.11 mg/L, 4.00 ± 0.10 mg/L, and
    3.19 ± 0.03 log CFU/100 mL respectively. Table 1 Descriptive statistics of the
    physicochemical variables and Acinetobacter density of the waterbodies. Full size
    table The bivariate correlation between paired PVs varied significantly from very
    weak to perfect/very strong positive or negative correlation (Table 2). In the
    same manner, the correlation between various PVs and AD varies. For instance,
    negligible but positive very weak correlation exist between AD and pH (r = 0.03,
    p = 0.422), and SAL (r = 0.06, p = 0.184) as well as very weak inverse (negative)
    correlation between AD and TDS (r = − 0.05, p = 0.243) and EC (r = − 0.04, p = 0.339).
    A significantly positive but weak correlation occurs between AD and BOD (r = 0.26,
    p = 4.21E−10), and TSS (r = 0.26, p = 1.09E−09), and TBS (r = 0.26, 1.71E-09)
    whereas, AD had a weak inverse correlation with DO5 (r = − 0.39, p = 1.31E−21).
    While there was a moderate positive correlation between TEMP and AD (r = 0.43,
    p = 3.19E−26), a moderate but inverse correlation occurred between AD and DO (r = −
    0.46, 1.26E−29). Table 2 Bivariate correlational relationship among physicochemical
    variables and Acinetobacter density in waterbodies receiving municipal and hospital
    wastewater effluents. Full size table Model predicted AD and explanatory contribution
    of PVs The predicted AD by the 18 ML regression models varied both in average
    value and coverage (range) as shown in Fig. 1. The average predicted AD ranged
    from 0.0056 log units by M5P to 3.2112 log unit by SVR. The average AD prediction
    declined from SVR [3.2112 (1.4646–4.4399)], DTR [3.1842 (2.2312–4.3036)], ENR
    [3.1842 (2.1233–4.8208)], NNT [3.1836 (1.1399–4.2936)], BRT [3.1833 (1.6890–4.3103)],
    RF [3.1795 (1.3563–4.4514)], XGB [3.1792 (1.1040–4.5828)], MARS [3.1790 (1.1901–4.5000)],
    LR [3.1786 (2.1895–4.7951)], LRSS [3.1786 (2.1622–4.7911)], GBM [3.1738 (1.4328–4.3036)],
    Cubist [3.1736 (1.1012–4.5300)], ELM [3.1714 (2.2236–4.9017)], KNN [3.1657 (1.4988–4.5001)],
    ANET6 [0.6077 (0.0419–1.1504)], ANET33 [0.6077 (0.0950–0.8568)], ANET42 [0.6077
    (0.0692–0.8568)], and M5P [0.0056 (− 0.6024–0.6916)]. However, in term of range
    coverage XGB [3.1792 (1.1040–4.5828)] and Cubist [3.1736 (1.1012–4.5300)] outshined
    other models because those models overestimated and underestimated AD at lower
    and higher values respectively when compared with raw data [3.1865 (1–4.5611)].
    Figure 1 Comparison of ML model-predicted AD in the waterbodies. RAW raw/empirical
    AD value. Full size image Figure 2 represents the explanatory contributions of
    PVs to AD prediction by the models. The subplot A-R gives the absolute magnitude
    (representing parameter importance) by which a PV instance changes AD prediction
    by each model from its mean value presented in the vertical axis. In LR, an absolute
    change from the mean value of pH, BOD, TSS, DO, SAL, and TEMP corresponded to
    an absolute change of 0.143, 0.108, 0.069, 0.0045, 0.04, and 0.004 units in the
    LR’s AD prediction response/value. Also, an absolute response flux of 0.135, 0.116,
    0.069, 0.057, 0.043, and 0.0001 in AD prediction value was attributed to pH, BOD,
    TSS, DO. SAL, and TEMP changes, respectively, by LRSS. Similarly, absolute change
    in DO, BOD, TEMP, TSS, pH, and SAL would achieve 0.155, 0.061. 0.099, 0.144, and
    0.297 AD prediction response changes by KNN. In addition, the most contributed
    or important PV whose change largely influenced AD prediction response was TEMP
    (decreases or decreases the responses up to 0.218) in RF. Summarily, AD prediction
    response changes were highest and most significantly influenced by BOD (0.209),
    pH (0.332), TSS (0.265), TEMP (0.6), TSS (0.233), SAL (0.198), BOD (0.127), BOD
    (0.11), DO (0.028), pH (0.114), pH (0.14), SAL(0.91), and pH (0.427) in XGB, BTR,
    NNT, DTR, SVR, M5P, ENR, ANET33, ANNET64, ANNET6, ELM, MARS, and Cubist, respectively.
    Figure 2 PV-specific contribution to eighteen ML models forecasting capability
    of AD in MHWE receiving waterbodies. The average baseline value of PV in the ML
    is presented on the y-axis. The green/red bars represent the absolute value of
    each PV contribution in predicting AD. Full size image Table 4 presents the eighteen
    regression algorithms’ performance predicting AD given the waterbodies PVs. In
    terms of MSE, RMSE, and R2, XGB (MSE = 0.0059, RMSE = 0.0770; R2 = 0.9912) and
    Cubist (MSE = 0.0117, RMSE = 0.1081, R2 = 0.9827) ranked first and second respectively,
    to outmatched other models in predicting AD. While MSE and RMSE metrics ranked
    ANET6 (MSE = 0.0172, RMSE = 0.1310), ANRT42 (MSE = 0.0220, RMSE = 0.1483), ANET33
    (MSE = 0.0253, RMSE = 0.1590), M5P (MSE = 0.0275, RMSE = 0.1657), and RF (MSE = 0.0282,
    RMSE = 0.1679) in the 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7 position among the MLs in predicting AD,
    M5P (R2 = 0.9589 and RF (R2 = 0.9584) recorded better performance in term of R-squared
    metric and ANET6 (MAD = 0.0856) and M5P (MAD = 0.0863) in term of MAD metric among
    the 5 models. But Cubist (MAD = 0.0437) XGB (MAD = 0.0440) in term of MAD metric.
    The feature importance of each PV over permutational resampling on the predictive
    capability of the ML models in predicting AD in the waterbodies is presented in
    Table 3 and Fig. S1. The identified important variables ranked differently from
    one model to another, with temperature ranking in the first position by 10/18
    of the models. In the 10 algorithms/models, the temperature was responsible for
    the highest mean RMSE dropout loss, with temperature in RF, XGB, Cubist, BRT,
    and NNT accounting for 0.4222 (45.90%), 0.4588 (43.00%), 0.5294 (50.82%), 0.3044
    (44.87%), and 0.2424 (68.77%) respectively, while 0.1143 (82.31%),0.1384 (83.30%),
    0.1059 (57.00%), 0.4656 (50.58%), and 0.2682 (57.58%) RMSE dropout loss was attributed
    to temperature in ANET42, ANET10, ELM, M5P, and DTR respectively. Temperature
    also ranked second in 2/18 models, including ANET33 (0.0559, 45.86%) and GBM (0.0793,
    21.84%). BOD was another important variable in forecasting AD in the waterbodies
    and ranked first in 3/18 and second in 8/18 models. While BOD ranked as the first
    important variable in AD prediction in MARS (0.9343, 182.96%), LR (0.0584, 27.42%),
    and GBM (0.0812, 22.35%), it ranked second in KNN (0.2660, 42.69%), XGB (0.4119,
    38.60); BRT (0.2206, 32.51%), ELM (0.0430, 23.17%), SVR (0.1869, 35.77%), DTR
    (0.1636, 35.13%), ENR (0.0469, 21.84%) and LRSS (0.0669, 31.65%). SAL rank first
    in 2/18 (KNN: 0.2799; ANET33: 0.0633) and second in 3/18 (Cubist: 0.3795; ANET42:
    0.0946; ANET10: 0.1359) of the models. DO ranked first in 2/18 (ENR [0.0562; 26.19%]
    and LRSS [0.0899; 42.51%]) and second in 3/18 (RF [0.3240, 35.23%], M5P [0.3704,
    40.23%], LR [0.0584, 27.41%]) of the models. Table 3 Feature importance of PVs
    over 100 permutational resampling on AD prediction. Full size table Figure 3 shows
    the residual diagnostics plots of the models comparing actual AD and forecasted
    AD values by the models. The observed results showed that actual AD and predicted
    AD value in the case of LR (A), LRSS (B), KNN (C), BRT 9F), GBM (G), NNT (H),
    DTR (I), SVR (J), ENR (L), ANET33 (M), ANER64 (N), ANET6 (O), ELM (P) and MARS
    (Q) skewed, and the smoothed trend did not overlap. However, actual AD and predicted
    AD values experienced more alignment and an approximately overlapped smoothed
    trend was seen in RF (D), XGB (E), M5P (K), and Cubist (R). Among the models,
    RF (D) and M5P (K) both overestimated and underestimated predicted AD at lower
    and higher values, respectively. Whereas XGB and Cubist both overestimated AD
    value at lower value with XGB closer to the smoothed trend that Cubist. Generally,
    a smoothed trend overlapping the gradient line is desirable as it shows that a
    model fits all values accurately/precisely. Figure 3 Comparison between actual
    and predicted AD by the eighteen ML models. Full size image The comparison of
    the partial-dependence profiles of PVs on AD prediction by the 18 modes using
    a unitary model by PVs presentation for clarity is shown in Figs. S2–S7. The partial-dependence
    profiles existed in i. a form where an average increase in AD prediction accompanied
    a PV increase (upwards trend), (ii) inverse trend, where an increase in a PV resulted
    in a decline AD prediction, (iii) horizontal trend, where increase/decrease in
    a PV yielded no effects on AD prediction, and (iv) a mixed trend, where the shape
    switch between 2 or more of i–iii. The models'' response varied with a change
    in any of the PV, especially changes beyond the breakpoints that could decrease
    or increase AD prediction response. The partial-dependence profile (PDP) of DO
    for models has a downtrend either from the start or after a breakpoint(s) of nature
    ii and iv, except for ELM which had an upward trend (i, Fig. S2). TEMP PDP had
    an upward trend (i and iv) and, in most cases filled with one or more breakpoints
    but had a horizontal trend in LRSS (Fig. S3). SAL had a PDP of a typical downward
    trend (ii and iv) across all the models (Fig. S4). While pH displayed a typical
    downtrend PDP in LR, LRSS, NNT, ENR, ANN6, a downtrend filled with different breakpoint(s)
    was seen in RF, M5P, and SVR; other models showed a typical upward trend (i and
    iv) filled with breakpoint(s) (Fig. S5). The PDP of TSS showed an upward trend
    that returned to a plateau (DTR, ANN33, M5P, GBM, RF, XFB, BRT), after a final
    breakpoint or a declining trend (ANNT6, SVR; Fig. S6). The BOD PDP generally had
    an upward trend filled with breakpoint(s) in most models (Fig. S7). Discussion
    The present investigation studied the invaluableness of MLs in determining AD
    in waterbodies to shorten the turnaround time involved in routine determination
    of the emerging pathogen with significant public health priority and high case-fatality
    ratio. Jiang et al. previously demonstrated that ML models predicted and offered
    cost-effective risk assessment options for Vibrio spp. relative abundances on
    microplastics in the estuarine milieu based on easy-to-measure environmental variables30.
    Characteristics of the waterbodies The pH of the waterbodies (5.05–9.11) did not
    satisfied South African water guidelines for irrigation purposes and recreational
    use of a pH range of 6.5–8.4 and 6.5–8.5, respectively36 but the average pH (7.76 ± 0.02)
    of the waterbodies met the FAO criteria37. In relation to the pathogen, Acinetobacter
    spp. are known to possess and survive under a wide pH (5–10) and temperature (−
    20 to 44 °C) range with an optimal long-term survival temperature of 4–22 °C no
    matter nutrient availability38. The observed EC (47.00–561.00 µS/cm) of the waterbodies
    generally satisfied the WHO guidelines for 2500 μS/cm in surface waters39, and
    the mean (218.66 ± 4.76 μS/cm) was in accepted limits of 400 µS/cm and 700 to
    3000 µS/cm WHO and FAO standard for irrigation water37. The EC of the waterbodies
    also fell in the categories of Class I (excellent: ≤ 250 µS/cm) and Class II (good:
    250–750 µS/cm) irrigation water EC limits classification40. The EC concentrations
    of the waterbodies will generally impact fishing negatively, as an EC range of
    0.15–0.50 μS/cm are necessary to support fisheries according to the USEPA (United
    States Environmental Protection Agency)41. TDS summed up organic and inorganic
    substances in the waterbodies but generally did not exceed the WHO’s maximum permissible
    limit of 1000 mg/L TDS in drinking water39. The TDS (23.00–279.00 mg/L) of the
    waterbodies followed the World Health Organization standard of a TDS < 300 mg/L
    (excellent) and its average (110.53 ± 2.36 mg/L) does not exceed the USEPA and
    WHO limit for drinking water (500 mg/L)41,42. However, the TBS average values
    of the waterbodies exceeded the WHO guideline of 5 NTU39. Higher EC, TDS, and
    TBS in surface waters are generally attributed to wastewater and anthropogenic
    activities inputs43. Also, high levels of EC, TDS and TBS are known to impair
    visibility, cleanliness, safety, aesthetics, and recreational use of river waters44.
    The mean TSS (80.17 ± 5.09 mg/L) of the waterbodies exceeded the WHO (2006) wastewater
    discharge limit of 60 mg/L and exceeded the Australia and New Zealand (2000) guideline
    limits (TSS < 0.03 mg/L) of water quality for aquaculture45,46. In addition, the
    average BOD level (4.00 ± 0.10 mg/L) of the waterbodies complied with the tolerance
    limit of 5 mg/L in surface waters for aquatic life47. Higher level of BOD in waterbodies
    depletes DO available for aquatic organisms48 and generally have negative impacts
    on fishing and fish harvest. The average AD (3.19 ± 0.03 log CFU/100 mL) obtained
    in this study is comparable to AD reported from waterbody impacted by hospital
    wastewater, WWTP, informal settlements, and veterinary clinics effluents along
    Umhlangane River course in Durban South Africa49. The observed DO (8.82 ± 0.04
    mg/L) and BOD (4.00 ± 0.10 mg/L) both suggested the facultative aerophilic characteristics
    of Acinetobacter and a relatively high nutrient composition of the rivers’ probable
    from wastewater effluents. The average EC in the waterbodies was 218.66 ± 4.76
    µS/cm. This shows high level of organic carbon (DOC) in the rivers. EC is an indirect
    indicator of DOC25,50,51 and found to have associations with Acinetobacter-specific
    ARG and other ARG abundance25,52,53. Generally, A. baumannii in the environment
    can survive irrespective of the level of DO54. The finding from this study revealed
    that AD negligible—positive but very weak—correlated with pH (r = 0.03), and SAL
    (r = 0.06) and—negatively—with TDS (r = − 0.05) and EC (r = − 0.04) (Table 2).
    These results can be attributed to the ability of the Acinetobacter to survive
    under a wide range of harsh environmental conditions. A significantly positive
    correlation between AD and BOD (r = 0.26), TSS (r = 0.26), and TBS (r = 0.26)
    indicated a considerable increase AD with an increase in nutrient and DOC pollution
    in aquatic environments (Fig. S7). Also, findings showed a moderate positive correlation
    between TEMP and AD (r = 0.43), suggesting that AD improves in abundance with
    an increase in temperature38 to specific breakpoints. AD moderately and inversely
    correlated with DO (r = − 0.46), indicating that Acinetobacter abundance increases
    with an anaerobic condition or low oxygen level. Model predicted AD and explanatory
    contribution of PVs The predicted AD average and range values by the 18 ML models
    differed. The present study''s findings suggested that both lower/upper bound
    and the general trend characteristic of the prediction is far more important than
    the average prediction only. Most algorithms had higher average predictions but
    overestimated or underestimated AD values at lower and upper bounds, respectively.
    Thus, algorithms other than XGB and Cubist are not suitable for predicting AD
    in waterbodies. Whereas the performance of most ML algorithms, such as RF, DTR,
    and MARS43,55, has been praised in terms of average predictions and regression
    metrics, most studies neglect consideration of the lower/upper bound and the general
    trend characteristic of their predictions—which are far significant when dealing
    with infectious organisms/poison that might have low infectivity dose/potent at
    a very low concentration. Several researchers also reported the superiority of
    XGB against several ML algorithms in predictive performance in terms of average
    prediction, and sensitivity43,55. Although a previous study showed that RF models
    achieved higher level of accuracy than XGB, SVR, and ENR in predicting the Vibrio
    spp. relative abundance on microplastics, the actual trend characteristics including
    the lower/upper bounds were not reported30. The difference in the models’ trend
    coverage and boundary characteristics in AD predictions are attributable to the
    capability of the models to capture the complex interactions of co-occurrence
    levels/changes in different environmental variables at different degrees or concentrations.
    The performance of Cubist [3.1736 (1.1012–4.5300)] was also found to be comparable
    to XGB [3.1792 (1.1040–4.5828)] in term of trend and boundaries characteristics
    as both models outshined other models. A typical problem with most algorithms
    observed in this study was over-estimation and underestimation of AD at lower
    and higher concentrations, respectively. These limitations suggested that the
    models could raise false alarm of high risk at lower AD as well as undermine higher
    risk at higher concentrations of AD. An indication that those models could not
    capture the nonlinear complex relationships between AD, PVs, and underlying anthropogenic
    inputs. Nevertheless, the absolute contributions of individual PV change to models’
    prediction of AD from their models attributed mean values varied (Fig. 2). The
    behaviours could be interpreted in term of the complex interactions among the
    PVs coupled with the prevailing anthropogenic fluxes in the waterbodies. Several
    PVs undergo fluctuations co-concurrently unlike behaviours in models in which
    other PVs are held constant to assess a particular PV’s effects on the outcome
    variable (AD). These interactions are capture to some great degrees by the algorithms
    leading to differences in the ranking of PVs contributions to AD predictions by
    the algorithms. Also, intrinsic characteristics of the distinct algorithms and
    data noise are major causes of differences in observed contributions of variables
    in ML models30. Considering the overall performance of 18 AI-based models assayed
    in this study using four metrics, XGB (MSE = 0.0059, RMSE = 0.0770; R2 = 0.9912;
    MAD = 0.0440) and Cubist (MSE = 0.0117, RMSE = 0.1081, R2 = 0.9827; MAD = 0.0437)
    were the best models ranking in first and second position respectively, to outshined
    others in AD prediction in waterbodies (Table 4). XGB has reputation of been the
    best performer ML algorithms in most microbiological regression studies compared
    with others30. Cubist has been demonstrated to outperformed partial least squares,
    RF, and MARS in predicting soil property including soil total nitrogen, organic
    carbon, total sulphur, exchangeable calcium clay; sand, and cation exchange capacity,
    and pH and RF, classification, and regression trees, SVM, and KNN predicting NH4–N
    and COD in subsurface constructed wetlands effluents56,57. In forecasting daily
    dissemination of COVID-19 vaccination, Cubist outperformed ENR, Gaussian Process,
    Slab (SPIKES), and Spikes ML algorithms58. Also, Cubist has been shown to outmatched
    XGB in predicting left ventricular pressures, volumes, and stresses59. An ensemble
    of XGB and Cubist could be further exploited for a better performance in forecasting
    AD in waterbodies. However, ANN (R2 = 0.953) was demonstrated to show a superior
    predictive coefficient over Cubist model (R2 = 0.946) and LR (R2 = 0.481) when
    assaying faecal coliform content in treated wastewater for reuse purposes60. Generally,
    while XGB involved ensemble of trees that capture multidimensional interactions/relationships,
    Cubist combined the strengths of both linear regression equations and a committee
    tree-based structural nodes for capture effectively linear and nonlinear multidimensional
    relationships among variables and outcome event56. The results show that ANET6,
    ANRT42, ANET33, M5P, and RF had MSE and RMSE that placed them in the 3, 4, 5,
    6, and 7 position among the MLs in predicting AD, their performances are to be
    avoided for practical forecast of AD for preventive purposes. Table 4 Predictive
    performance of eighteen regression algorithms in predicting AD in the waterbodies.
    Full size table Feature importance of PVs in predicting AD TEMP was the most important
    PV in predicting AD in the waterbodies and ranked by 10/18 ML-algorithms including
    RF, XGB, Cubist, BRT, and NNT accounting 45.90%, 43.00%, 50.82%, 44.87%, and 68.77%
    in respective models, as well as 82.31%, 83.30%, 57.00%, 50.58%, and 57.58% RMSE
    dropout loss in ANET42, ANET10, ELM, M5P, and DTR respectively. The observed results
    can be explained in term of the direct and indirect influence TEMP had on other
    PVs and AD in the waterbodies. DO decreases with increase temperature, favoured
    facultative aerobic lifestyle of Acinetobacter. Also, temperature increase decomposition
    of organic matters in waterbodies, thereby leading to high BOD contents providing
    more nutrients for AD and other microbial lives. Resultant increase in DOC in
    waterbodies is an indirect indicator of EC25,50,51 and found to have associations
    with Acinetobacter-specific ARG abundance in waterbodies25,52,53. BOD was another
    significant feature identified in forecasting AD in the waterbodies and ranked
    first in 3/18 [MARS (182.96%), LR (27.42%), and GBM (22.35%)] and second in 8/18
    models [KNN (42.69%), XGB (38.60%); BRT (32.51%), ELM (23.17%), SVR (35.77%),
    DTR (35.13%), ENR (21.84%) and LRSS (31.65%)]. BOD is a measure of nutrient pollution
    from anthropogenic inputs such as wastewater effluents, agricultural activities,
    and environmental events such as rainwater runoffs among others. BOD also influence
    EC, TDS, and TBS in surface waters43 Whereas SAL was identified as first important
    feature in in 2/18 (KNN, ANET33) and second in 3/18 (Cubist, ANET42, ANET6) models,
    Acinetobacter can only survive relatively high SAL without improving its population
    density (Fig. S4). Unlike Vibrio spp, whose high density are linked with high
    salinity30 as it promotes genes expression and functional proteins61 and eventual
    vibrio growth and reproduction62, high SAL are not suitable for AD as its inhibitory
    for growth related gene expression. The sensitivity analyses of the 18 ML predictive
    models of AD using the residual diagnostics plots found that LR (A), LRSS (B),
    KNN (C), BRT (F), GBM (G), NNT (H), DTR (I), SVR (J), ENR (L), ANET33 (M), ANER64
    (N), ANET6 (O), ELM (P) and MARS (Q) did not fit the data optimally. This imply
    that the models are not suitable for forecasting AD in waterbodies. Meanwhile
    models such as RF (D), XGB (E), M5P (K), and Cubist (R) fitted the data with more
    alignment and approximately overlapped smoothed trend between the actual and the
    predicted AD values, RF (D) and M5P (K) over-predicted and under-predicted AD
    at lower and higher extremities, respectively. Thus, could be interpreted as forecasting
    exaggerated risk (AD) at probable innocuous level while weakening true risk at
    higher extremity. Such models are not suitable to assess real life events of AD
    in waterbodies. Although both XGB and Cubist predicted AD value slightly higher
    than the actual value at lower extremities, XGB had a closer fit smoothed trend
    than Cubist. Compared to other models assayed in this study, the duo is the best
    and could be applied for AD AI-smart system design for water quality monitoring.
    A stacked model of XGB and Cubist may outmatch and overcome the limitation the
    two models had at the lower extremity of AD value. The overall summary of the
    PDPs of the PVs on AD prediction by the 18 modes (Figs. S2–S7), found that any
    degree of change/flux in a particular PV especially changes beyond its breakpoints
    attracted a corresponding varied response in AD which could decrease or increase
    AD prediction response. The various forms of partial-dependence profiles as explained
    in previous section also showed the direct/indirect/complex interactions between
    a PV and AD coupled with the sensitivity of a model in mapping the relationships.
    Summarily, the increase in AD level (PDP) in most models equivalent to a decline
    trend in DO and SAL especially after its breakpoint(s) excluding ELM where DO
    had upward trend (i; Figs. S2 and S4). These patterns revealed a nonlinear relationship
    between AD and the PVs. A near increase-by-increase relationship exist between
    TEMP and AD in most models coupled with one or more breakpoints. LRSS revealed
    a zero-relationship between AD and TEMP indicating its inability to map the relationship
    between them. Although Acinetobacter has been showed to have a broad pH range,
    a typical downtrend PDP of pH by LR, LRSS, NNT, ENR, ANN6—filled with breakpoint(s)
    in RF, M5P, and SVR while other models showed a typical upward—is informative
    of the weakness of the models as increasing in pH from 5.02 to 10 promotes Acinetobacter
    growth38. AD prediction responses aligned with a general increase in BOD regardless
    of breakpoint(s) in most models revealed important of nutrients for Acinetobacter
    population density in waterbodies. Furthermore, the strengths of this current
    study aside been the first that assessed AD in waterbodies receiving hospital
    and municipal wastewater effluents along their courses, two ML algorithms optimally
    and accurately predict AD, proven to be promising candidates for developing SAIS
    for AD determination and thereby shorten the turnaround time and reduce labour
    involved in experimental approaches. Also, the MLs were able to capture nonlinear
    complex multidimensional interactions between AD and PVs as well as their inherent
    anthropogenic fuels which conventional mathematical models could not robustly
    mapped63. In addition, the MLs are amenable to improvements and can be utilized
    across several water management landscape. However, the shortcoming of the present
    study lies in the lack of spatiotemporal covariates that could improve upon the
    ML models’ predictions as stochastic distributions of waterborne pathogens are
    governed by both spatial extension and temporal duration across depth in water
    columns. Future studies should seek data from a wide range of socioeconomic activities/areas
    as well as include spatiotemporal and geospatial inputs in developing AI-based
    predictive framework for AD determination. Conclusion The present study has proven
    SAIS as an evidence-based strategy to shorten the turnaround time involved in
    assessing AD in waterbodies; thereby minimizing exposure. The best models (XGB/Cubist)
    identified in this study could be developed into standalone SAIS (XGB/Cubist,
    XGB-Cubist ensemble, or web app) or integrated into existing instrumentations
    for PV estimation in waterbodies to enhance timely decision-making of microbiological
    qualities of waterbodies for irrigation and other purposes. The study also unveiled
    temperature and BOD as significant candidates for predicting AD in waterbodies
    in most models. Finally, AD in waterbodies could accurately and reliably predicted
    via AI-based smart systems that rely on waterbody physicochemical variables’ dynamics
    in a low-cost and time-effective manner. Data availability All data generated

  description: Growing population of India has an increased need for food, energy,
    and water, which calls for organized water management with improved crop yield.
    Accurate estimation of evapotranspiration (ET) is the first step in evaluating
    the water requirement of field crops. The solar radiation data are the essential
    input for estimating the reference crop ET (ET0 ). Due to expensive and difficulties
    in direct measurement techniques, solar radiation and ET0 were predicted using
    random forest machine learning (ML) and empirical methods. The water requirement
    for the tomato crop in millimetre/day is calculated using the estimated ET. Meteorological
    parameters associated with this study were obtained from India meteorological
    department and AQUASTAT tool. Based on the performance metrics such as MSE the
    value of 0.03 and correlation coefficient of 0.97, it is observed that solar radiation
    and ET0 predictions using random forest ML are better than the empirical model.
    Thus, this climate-smart agriculture approach can be applied as a successful strategy

  description: Efficiently managing agricultural irrigation is vital for food security
    today and into the future under climate change. Yet, evaluating agriculture’s
    hydrological impacts and strategies to reduce them remains challenging due to
    a lack of field-scale data on crop water consumption. Here, we develop a method
    to fill this gap using remote sensing and machine learning, and leverage it to
    assess water saving strategies in California’s Central Valley. We find that switching
    to lower water intensity crops can reduce consumption by up to 93%, but this requires
    adopting uncommon crop types. Northern counties have substantially lower irrigation
    efficiencies than southern counties, suggesting another potential source of water
    savings. Other practices that do not alter land cover can save up to 11% of water
    consumption. These results reveal diverse approaches for achieving sustainable
    water use, emphasizing the potential of sub-field scale crop water consumption
    maps to guide water management in California and beyond.

  explanation: This paper presents a method for estimating water consumption at the
    field scale in California’s Central Valley. The authors leverage remote sensing
    data and machine learning to estimate total and naturally-occurring evapotranspiration
    (ET). They then calculate agricultural ET, which is the difference between total
    ET and naturally-occurring ET. The paper provides a detailed description of the
    methodology, as well as an analysis of the results. The authors find that their
    method can be used to identify opportunities for water savings in the Central
    Valley. For example, they find that switching to less water-intensive crops could
    reduce water consumption by up to 93%.

    and crop water use of 175 individual crops for 1990–2019 simulated with a global
    crop model Article Open access 14 February 2024 Introduction Climate change, drought,
    and the overexploitation of water resources have led to declines in freshwater
    storage in many vital agricultural regions1, raising concerns surrounding the
    future of food and water security2,3. Irrigation constitutes the largest use of
    freshwater globally4,5, and many regions will need to decrease their agricultural
    water use while maintaining high levels of production to ensure a sustainable
    food and water supply as the population grows6. Proposed options for reducing
    water use include leaving lands fallow, switching to less water-intensive crops,
    adopting water-saving farming practices such as deficit irrigation, and improving
    irrigation efficiency7,8. However, any approach to reducing agricultural water
    use depends on the challenging task of characterizing the amount of water crops
    consume9. While it is possible to monitor volumes of water withdrawn for irrigation,
    this is a poor proxy for the amount of water crops consume through evapotranspiration
    (ET)10. Only some irrigation water results in ET: the rest remains in the system
    as runoff or recharge, though this proportion can vary widely depending on topography,
    climate, soil type, and farming practices11. Agricultural ET, or the increase
    in ET that irrigated agriculture brings, is therefore a critical measure in that
    it represents the amount of water that is actually “consumed” by agriculture.
    This water leaves the watershed entirely as it is evaporated from the soil and
    transpired by crops4. Since agricultural ET represents agricultural water consumption,
    it is key for gauging the potential of fallowing, crop switching, or other farming
    practices to save water12. When compared to total irrigation amounts, agricultural
    ET can also be used to highlight the fraction of irrigation withdrawals that do
    not effectively result in consumptive use13. While this water stays in the system
    and therefore may continue to provide beneficial uses14, it also does not achieve
    its original purpose of contributing to crop growth. Therefore, agricultural ET
    can help calculate irrigation efficiency and identify unnecessary irrigation water
    withdrawals from surface or groundwater reservoirs13. Two methodological challenges
    prevent agricultural ET from being monitored at scale. First, simply measuring
    total ET at scale is a challenge. Second, even when measures of ET are available,
    it is difficult to separate agricultural ET from the total10,15. To measure total
    ET, eddy covariance flux towers are highly accurate for monitoring ET at a single
    location16. However, they are expensive and thus sparse, and they are designed
    to measure ET over uniform vegetation, which is not reflective of complex agricultural
    landscapes17. In the absence of ET measurements, theoretical water demand can
    be simulated based on climate and crop type18,19. Although such tools are helpful
    for water demand planning20, theoretical water demand represents the ET of a crop
    whose water demands are fully met. Therefore, these are likely to overestimate
    actual ET. Additionally, these simulated estimates exclusively reflect variations
    in water demand influenced by factors incorporated into the model, which are often
    limited to crop type and climate21. Therefore, analyses based on these models
    are constrained to examining these specific factors, neglecting other critical
    drivers of ET such as farming practices. Given the scarcity of in situ data and
    the inherent constraints of simulated estimates, accurately gauging total ET at
    scale remains a significant challenge. Addressing the second challenge, even when
    accurate ET measurements are available, isolating agricultural ET from total ET
    is difficult. This step is key for water management, since the resulting metric
    represents the increase in ET attributable to agriculture. To do so, one must
    estimate the naturally-occurring ET that would occur in the absence of irrigated
    agriculture (for example, if the land were left fallow). Most often, this naturally-occurring
    ET is assumed to be equal to precipitation19,22. However, there may be temporal
    lags between precipitation and resulting ET, some precipitation may not result
    in ET at all, and ET may also be supplemented by other sources of water, such
    as near surface groundwater. Together, these challenges leave us with limited
    measurements of ET and no empirical estimates of agricultural ET at large scales,
    inhibiting our ability to form evidence-based water management policies that accurately
    reflect crop water use and potential water savings in agriculture. Recent advances
    in the remote sensing of ET unlock new avenues for research into agricultural
    water consumption. Numerous algorithms for estimating ET using land surface temperature
    and other remote sensing inputs have been validated specifically for use in agricultural
    settings23,24. These advancements have allowed researchers to empirically study
    total ET in agricultural settings25,26. However, despite high-resolution maps
    of ET in agricultural landscapes25,27, the challenge of isolating agricultural
    ET from total ET has been limited to studies in extremely arid regions where irrigation
    is the only source of water available to plants28. Here, we develop a framework
    for measuring agricultural ET at sub-field scales. We use remote sensing to determine
    total ET and combine it with machine learning to estimate naturally-occurring
    ET. First, we retrieve satellite-based remotely sensed total ET estimates from
    the 30m, monthly OpenET ensemble data24 available in the western United States
    starting in 2016. Second, since we can use these same OpenET estimates to directly
    observe naturally-occurring ET over fallow lands, we train a gradient boosting
    algorithm to predict ET over fallow lands. We use information on topography, soil
    quality, climate, and spatial and temporal coordinates as predictors. We then
    use the model to retrieve naturally-occurring ET over all active agricultural
    fields, which we subtract from the remotely-sensed ET to calculate agricultural
    ET. We apply this methodology to calculate agricultural ET across California’s
    Central Valley, one of the world’s most water-stressed and agriculturally productive
    regions29. We use these maps of agricultural ET to calculate the water consumption
    of different crop types, as well as to calculate variability in agricultural ET
    within crop types. These insights allow us to evaluate different strategies that
    have been proposed to save water under the Sustainable Groundwater Management
    Act (SGMA)7, which mandates that all water basins in California reduce groundwater
    pumping to sustainable levels by 204030. Specifically, we compare the ability
    of fallowing, crop switching, and other farming practices to save water by reducing
    agricultural ET. Additionally, we calculate irrigation efficiency to assess the
    potential to reduce irrigation withdrawals without decreasing agricultural ET.
    In the wake of groundwater pumping cutbacks of 20–50% under SGMA7, this work will
    guide water managers in enacting water savings and help predict which land use
    changes are likely to ensue. Results Estimating agricultural ET We calculate agricultural
    ET by retrieving the total ET observed over agricultural areas and subtracting
    naturally-occurring ET (Fig. 1). While total ET estimates are retrieved directly
    from OpenET, we simulate naturally-occurring ET by training a gradient boosting
    regressor to predict the ET observed by OpenET over fallow lands. Our model simulating
    naturally-occurring ET achieves an R2 of .87 and a Mean Absolute Error (MAE) of
    35.5 mm per year (Supplementary Fig. 1). We use a test set made up of 2 km2 held-out
    areas (about four times the area of a large agricultural field in the Central
    Valley). We do not find that error is structured across either space (Supplementary
    Figs. 2 and 3) or time (Supplementary Fig. 4). Fig. 1: Estimates of annual agricultural
    evapotranspiration (ET) over active agricultural lands in California’s Central
    Valley. a Total ET is remotely sensed and is retrieved from OpenET. b Naturally-occurring
    ET is an estimate of the ET that would be present if the agricultural lands were
    fallow, and is predicted using machine learning. c Agricultural ET is the difference
    between total and naturally-occurring ET, and represents our estimate of the ET
    caused by agriculture, and therefore the water that would be conserved if the
    land were fallow instead of cropped. The variations in agricultural ET across
    the landscape suggest that different fields can have vastly different abilities
    to conserve water. OpenET provides ET data at the scale of 30 m; all figure panels
    here show ET resampled to 70 m resolution for computational efficiency and to
    better match average field size. Full size image Variation in agricultural ET
    within and across crop types We leverage the significant variability in agricultural
    ET observed across the Central Valley (Fig. 1) to analyze the factors driving
    these variations. Crop type, which is commonly cited as an important variable
    explaining differences in agricultural ET19, explains 34% of the variation in
    estimated agricultural ET (Eq. (4), Supplementary Fig. 5). In Fig. 2, we show
    the water intensity of different crop groups (Supplementary Note 7). Deciduous
    fruits and nuts are some of the highest consumers at 625 mm per year (582–668
    95% CI) (Fig. 2), particularly almonds at 715 mm per year (651–778 95% CI) (Supplementary
    Fig. 5). Conversely, grain and hay crops consume only 141 mm per year (111–171
    95% CI). These broad variations in the water consumption of different crop types
    align with previous work estimating crop water demands (Supplementary Note 1,
    Supplementary Fig. 6) and suggest that substantial water savings may be possible
    with crop switching. Fig. 2: Variations in annual agricultural evapotranspiration
    (ET) across and within crop groups. Mean agricultural ET by crop group (blue fill
    and 95% CI) is the average difference between total ET (black outline) and naturally-occurring
    ET (cream fill). All measures are summed across the year, leading to naturally-occurring
    and total ET estimates that include water consumption occurring outside of the
    growing season. While we find significant differences in mean agricultural ET
    across crop groups, the gray box plots also show a broad spread in agricultural
    ET within crop groups (box plots show 0.5, 0.25. 0.5, 0.75, and 0.95 quantiles).
    Full size image However, the majority of the variation remains unexplained by
    crop type (Fig. 2, Supplementary Fig. 5). This within-crop variability is not
    uniform for different crops: crops such as deciduous fruits and nuts tend to have
    large variances, whereas rice has a very small variance. For example, pistachios
    have the most variability with an interquartile range (IQR) of 664 mm per year
    over the whole state. Conversely, rice has an IQR of only 122 mm per year (Supplementary
    Fig. 5). Part of the large variability in agricultural ET for deciduous fruits
    and nuts can be explained by orchard age: young orchards consume significantly
    less water than more mature ones (Supplementary Note 2, Supplementary Fig. 7).
    Climate, topography, and soil quality explain an additional 6% of within-crop
    variation. However, substantial within-crop variation remains, indicating that
    some of these differences may be due to variations in farming practices. This
    would suggest that reducing water consumption without switching crops may be feasible,
    which we explore in the next section. The water-saving potential of different
    management strategies The variability of agricultural ET both within and between
    crops allows us to evaluate the water saving-potential of different management
    strategies. Here, we compare the effect of three scenarios on reducing agricultural
    ET in groundwater sub-basins across the Central Valley: 1. Crop switching: Substitute
    high-ET crops for the median water-consuming crop (Eq. (6)). 2. Farming practices:
    Keep the same spatial allocation of crops, but reduce agricultural ET of high
    consumers to the median, crop-specific, consumption level (Eq. (7)). 3. Fallowing:
    Fallow the 5% of lands with the highest estimated agricultural ET (Eq. (8)). Because
    it would not be realistic to prescribe farmers in different contexts to consume
    similar amounts of water, we calculate crop-specific agricultural ET and within-crop
    variation at the level of groundwater sub-basins. We additionally control for
    differences in climate, topography, and soil type before conducting the scenarios.
    To account for the effects of orchard age, we remove orchards that have been bearing
    fruit for 5 years or less or that are in their last year of production (Supplementary
    Fig. 7). We find that each of these scenarios return similar reductions in overall
    water consumption of around 10% (Fig. 3). Since crops with high agricultural ET
    are heavily favored in most sub-basins and therefore the median crop usually has
    a high agricultural ET, crop switching only results in a 9.9% reduction in agricultural
    ET. In order to achieve greater water savings, crops would need to be switched
    to less popular crops with lesser water demands: switching all crops to the lowest
    consuming crop in a sub-basin results in a 93.8% reduction in agricultural ET.
    While strategies that do not require a change in land cover type are less commonly
    cited as a water management approach, we find that reducing high consumers to
    their crops’s median consumption level yields similar water savings of up to 11.3%.
    Fallowing does, however, remain the most effective way to reduce agricultural
    ET. We find that leaving a mere 5% of land fallow results in a 9.3% consumption
    reduction, comparable to the savings afforded by crop switching and within-crop
    scenarios which by definition affect up to 50% of lands. Fig. 3: The percent reduction
    in agricultural evapotranspiration (ET) driven by various management scenarios.
    a Savings accrued by substituting high-ET crops for the median water-consuming
    crop in a sub-basin. b Water savings without changing land cover by reducing agricultural
    ET of high consumers to the median, crop- and sub-basin-specific, consumption
    level. c Water savings from fallowing the 5% of lands with the highest estimated
    agricultural ET. Full size image Irrigation efficiency While fallowing, crop switching,
    and other farming practices highlight opportunities to decrease agricultural ET,
    we also find opportunities to diminish runoff and deep percolation during conveyance,
    on-farm management, or application (Fig. 4). On average, we find that irrigation
    in the Central Valley is 61.8% (54.0–69.7%) efficient, similar in magnitude to
    what theoretical estimates predict (Supplementary Note 3, Supplementary Fig. 8).
    The large disparity in efficiency between northern and southern counties is, however,
    more pronounced than theoretical estimates (Supplementary Fig. 8). As a result,
    there may be limited potential to decrease water withdrawn for irrigation in the
    south which achieves efficiencies as high as 80%. The particularly low efficiencies
    in the northern counties, however, suggest a large potential to decrease irrigation
    water withdrawals without affecting agricultural ET. Fig. 4: Irrigation efficiency
    across the counties of the Central Valley. a Irrigation efficiency is calculated
    by dividing agricultural evapotranspiration (ET) (gridded data) by USGS county-level
    reports of irrigation amounts (blue polygons). For the calculation, agricultural
    ET is averaged to the county level to match the spatial scale of the irrigation
    data. Additionally, irrigation is displayed in volumetric units (teragrams), but
    is divided by county-level cropland area to be in units consistent with agricultural
    ET prior to the calculation. We note that these irrigation amounts are counted
    at the point of use, rather than the water’s point of origin. b The resulting
    county-level irrigation efficiency estimates vary widely across the Central Valley,
    with particularly low efficiencies in the northern counties. Full size image Discussion
    By empirically quantifying crop water consumption at sub-field scales, we contribute
    to characterizing agriculture’s hydrological effects and evaluate the ability
    of different management strategies to mitigate this impact. To overcome the methodological
    challenges associated with estimating agricultural ET, we leverage recent advances
    in remotely sensed ET and use machine learning to generate a naturally-occurring
    ET counterfactual. The fine scale variability in agricultural ET we uncover allows
    us to analyze the drivers of these differences and simulate the potential for
    different management practices to save water, including under-explored ones like
    adjusting farming practices. Additionally, when comparing agricultural ET to total
    water withdrawn for irrigation, we find substantial opportunities for improvements
    in irrigation efficiency in the northern counties of the Central Valley. High-resolution
    maps of agricultural ET can therefore guide our understanding of how agriculture
    and management can affect water resources in California and other water stressed
    agricultural regions globally. Accurate agricultural ET measures are crucial to
    characterize anthropogenic impacts on the hydrological cycle31 and enact effective
    water management18,32. Previously, agricultural ET has been estimated by (i) simulating
    crop water demand based on crop type and climate and (ii) removing naturally available
    water by subtracting precipitation19,22. However, both of these steps embed assumptions
    that can lead to significant biases. For (i), simulated crop water demand may
    not adequately represent the field characteristics or farming practices of a given
    location13. For example, water demands are not necessarily always met, meaning
    water consumption may be overestimated33,34,35. In line with this, while we generally
    find good agreement with crop water demand simulated by the CalSIMETAW model21,
    we do find that agricultural ET estimates are significantly smaller (Supplementary
    Note 1, Supplementary Fig. 6). For (ii), using precipitation to proxy for naturally-occurring
    ET fails to account for precipitation being lost as runoff, temporal lags in when
    precipitation is transpired, and alternative natural sources of water such as
    shallow groundwater. We find that the bias between our estimates and CalSIMETAW
    estimates increases when precipitation, rather than naturally-occurring ET, is
    used to represent baseline amounts of available water. This can be explained by
    the seasonal mismatch between precipitation and naturally-occurring ET: although
    annually there is more precipitation than naturally-occurring ET, precipitation
    mainly occurs in the winter when it is unavailable to most crops. Because using
    precipitation as a proxy for naturally-occurring ET does not account for moisture
    that remains in the soil by the time the growing season begins, this inflates
    simulated estimates of crop water demand. Our use of remotely sensed ET estimates
    and our ability to estimate naturally-occurring ET therefore allows us to more
    accurately characterize agricultural ET. High-resolution, empirical estimates
    of agricultural ET additionally open up the possibility to investigate differences
    in agricultural ET beyond what is attributable to crop type, which we find only
    accounts for 34% of the variation. These within-crop variations can be substantial
    for many crops: the difference in agricultural ET of a pistachio field from the
    75th to the 25th percentile is the same as the water that could be saved from
    fallowing an alfalfa field. Such broad variability is consistent with findings
    from studies comparing total ET across crops during the growing season25,26. Even
    after adjusting for variability attributable to field characteristics, orchard
    age, and climate, we find that these variations could translate to substantial
    water savings without requiring a change in crop type. Unfortunately, a lack of
    high-resolution data on field-scale farming practices and yields inhibits further
    analysis of specific practices driving agricultural ET variation and their economic
    implications. However, prior literature from experimental plots or particular
    locations suggests that mulching36, conservation tillage37, deficit irrigation33,34,35,
    and improved irrigation scheduling and technologies38 all have potential to limit
    agricultural ET. These practices may prove advantageous relative to costly strategies
    like crop-switching or fallowing, though more detailed cost-benefit analyses are
    necessary to determine the suitability of various interventions in specific contexts39.
    Such water saving farming practices are not mentioned in the plans drafted by
    SGMA water managers7. This is possibly due to a lack of conclusive research on
    the potential of such strategies to effectively decrease agricultural ET without
    significant effects on yield or operation cost. Spatial data on the use of these
    different practices would allow researchers to take full advantage of our high-resolution
    agricultural ET estimates and study their water-saving and economic benefits.
    In situ assessments of crop-specific water consumption and other variations in
    agricultural ET enable us to model potential water savings across diverse management
    scenarios. In addition to previously mentioned scenarios based on farming practices,
    we also investigate more traditionally studied strategies, such as crop switching
    and fallowing. Consistent with prior studies relying on crop water demand simulations,
    our research suggests that transitioning to crops with lower water requirements
    is an effective conservation strategy. However, accruing substantial water savings
    requires embracing less popular crops like grains and hay20. The feasibility of
    increasing production of these crops in the Central Valley is uncertain due to
    high labor and operational costs20. Furthermore, any form of crop switching entails
    expenses related to the adoption of new knowledge, technologies, and market adjustments40,41.
    Consequently, the viability of a significant shift towards less water-demanding
    crops, and its alignment with market expansion, remains uncertain20. Therefore,
    our findings support the notion that extensive fallowing or land retirement may
    be essential to achieve substantial reduction targets in areas with severe overdrafts42,43.
    Considering the risk of increased dust from unused land, repurposing such areas
    for habitat restoration, flood water capture for groundwater replenishment44,
    solar energy production, or sustainable industrial development45 could mitigate
    the economic impacts of land retirement for both farmers and local communities.
    Detailed agricultural ET maps like the ones generated for this study can help
    determine the scale of land repurposing needed and identify priority areas for
    such initiatives under different constraints, including existing water rights46.
    Finally, we find a significant opportunity to improve irrigation efficiency, especially
    in the northern part of the Central Valley where we find lower irrigation efficiency
    than previously expected (Supplementary Note 2, Supplementary Fig. 7). This implies
    that farmers in these areas could potentially reduce their irrigation water usage
    without negatively impacting agricultural ET and, consequently, crop growth. Although
    this finding is consistent with management strategies that focus on boosting irrigation
    efficiency7, it is important to recognize that such improvements may not automatically
    lead to water savings at the watershed level14. This is because water not consumed
    in irrigation processes does not always exit the watershed but can instead be
    reabsorbed into groundwater reservoirs or surface water bodies for later reuse.
    Conversely, water that is evapotranspired, which constitutes the ‘efficient’ part
    of irrigation, is completely removed from the watershed14. Hence, paradoxically,
    increasing irrigation efficiency could reduce water availability if it is not
    matched by a decrease in the amount of water withdrawn for irrigation. To prevent
    an unintended increase in water consumption, managers could use agricultural ET
    maps to monitor and control water use as improvements in irrigation efficiency
    are implemented. This study has some important limitations. Most notably, due
    to a lack of data on farming practices, it is difficult to ascertain whether the
    variation in within-crop agricultural ET that we estimate is indeed due to farming
    practices. When conducting our management scenarios, we account for the effects
    of climate, soil quality, topography, and orchard age. We additionally conduct
    the scenarios at the level of small groundwater sub-basins rather than across
    the entire valley to account for any additional regional environmental differences
    we are unable to otherwise account for. However, variance stemming from error
    in our agricultural ET estimates or from mislabeled crop types could contribute
    to observed within-crop variation in agricultural ET. We minimize error from mislabeled
    crop types by using the most accurate crop data available in California which
    boasts an accuracy of 97.6%47. Additionally, the OpenET ensemble model has been
    extensively validated24,48, and our machine learning model has an R2 of .87. We
    estimate that these sources of error are responsible for only 11% of the variance
    in our yearly agricultural ET estimates (Supplementary Note 4). Nevertheless,
    the water-saving potentials we calculate for both the fallowing and farmers practice
    scenarios should be interpreted as upper bound estimates. Another important limitation
    of this study stems from the limited data available on water withdrawn for irrigation
    which is needed to calculate irrigation efficiency. Since irrigation data are
    not available over the same years as agricultural ET, we use the average of the
    two most recent years, 2010 and 2015, a drought year and non-drought year, to
    calculate irrigation efficiency. To ensure that our results are robust to year-to-year
    variations in agricultural ET and irrigation use, we calculate irrigation efficiency
    using all the possible combinations of years (Supplementary Fig. 9). Though we
    do find significant variations based on the irrigation year used in some counties,
    we consistently find low irrigation efficiencies in the north and higher ones
    in the south. Irrigation data with better spatial and temporal resolution would
    improve estimates of irrigation efficiency calculated using this method. We have
    shown how highly resolved agricultural ET estimates can improve our understanding
    of anthropogenic impacts on the hydrologic cycle and guide water management by
    quantifying the potential of different water-saving strategies. In California,
    our findings suggest that irrigated agriculture increases ET less than previously
    estimated, and we find that managers may not need to rely as heavily on changes
    in land cover as currently proposed to achieve significant water savings. Because
    our method for estimating agricultural ET is based entirely on remote sensing
    and machine learning, it remains cost effective and has the potential to be used
    globally, especially as global ET datasets become increasingly available49. This
    work can help refine our understanding of agriculture’s effect on water resources
    and help managers achieve water-saving goals in water-stressed agricultural landscapes
    across the globe. Methods Agricultural ET We define agricultural ET as the difference
    between total ET over an agricultural parcel and the ET that would have been,
    had that parcel been fallow land instead (Eq. (1)). This definition recognizes
    that not all ET over agricultural lands, during the growing season or otherwise,
    can necessarily be attributed to agriculture. Such a definition is particularly
    useful from a management perspective, since it denotes the decrease in ET, or
    water savings, that one might expect if agriculture were to cease. $$\\begin{array}{r}{{{{{{{{\\rm{ET}}}}}}}}}_{{{{{{{{\\rm{ag}}}}}}}}}={{{{{{{{\\rm{ET}}}}}}}}}_{{{{{{{{\\rm{tot}}}}}}}}}-{{{{{{{{\\rm{ET}}}}}}}}}_{{{{{{{{\\rm{nat}}}}}}}}}\\end{array}$$
    (1) where ETag is agricultural ET, ETtot is the total ET over an agricultural
    parcel, and ETnat is the counterfactual ET that would occur naturally, were the
    same land fallow. We note that another, theoretically distinct counterfactual
    could be constructed to represent ETnat: ET if the land were undisturbed, natural
    land rather than fallow. We elect to simulate ET over fallow lands since it allows
    us to predict the potential water savings from fallowing, which has a management
    relevant interpretation. Total ET estimates We construct ETtot from OpenET ensemble
    data, available at a monthly time step from 2016-2021. This data is calculated
    as the average output of six different ET models estimated using Landsat data24.
    The data have been corrected for biases in ET resulting from data only being available
    during cloudless overpasses and have been extensively evaluated over a broad variety
    of land covers48. While they are published at a 30m scale, we resample to 70m
    to improve computational efficiency since this is well below the average size
    of an agricultural field in the Central Valley. Calculation of a naturally-occurring
    ET counterfactual using machine learning We estimate naturally-occurring ET for
    all agricultural pixels using a gradient boosting regressor trained on data from
    fallow lands. We choose a gradient boosting regressor due to its high flexibility
    in learning non-linear relationships and proven performance on tabular datasets
    relative to other regressors50. We retrieve the locations of fallow fields in
    the Central Valley from the Department of Water Resources (DWR) statewide crop
    mapping dataset over available years: 2016, 2018, and 2019. Pixels that are within
    the top 5% ET during July-September are removed due to some implausibly high numbers
    during these months that suggest mislabeling of an active agricultural pixel as
    fallow. While we believe that this data cleaning step is important to ensure an
    unbiased training set, omitting this step does not significantly change our main
    findings (Supplementary Note 5, Supplementary Figs. 10–12). We additionally find
    that our findings do not change when training our model on data that are marked
    fallow by both the DWR dataset and the Cropland Data Layer (CDL) (Supplementary
    Note 6, Supplementary Figs. 13–15). We predict naturally-occurring ET based on
    latitude and longitude, the month and year, as well as a broad set of additional
    variables describing topography (elevation, aspect, slope, topographic wetness
    index), soil quality (California Storie Index), and climate (Potential ET). The
    latitude, longitude, and month and year indicators are included to capture the
    spatial and temporal patterns in ET underlying the densely distributed fallow
    fields in our dataset. However, the inclusion of an indicator variable for each
    year in our model limits our analysis to 2016, 2018, and 2019, as these are the
    only years for which we have available land cover data. Nevertheless, given that
    ‘year’ contributes a mere 3% to our model’s predictive capability (see Supplementary
    Fig. 17), it may be considered non-essential for future research in this area.
    Including additional predictors in our model presents two benefits. First, they
    can improve the model’s predictive power. For example, we find that Potential
    ET contributes greatly to the model’s final predictions (Supplementary Fig. 17).
    Other variables are important to include because they can help correct for systematic
    differences between the fallow lands used to train our model and the active agricultural
    lands we apply the model to. Such differences could arise from farmers selecting
    lands to be fallowed due to their inherently lower productivity, which would negatively
    bias our estimates of counterfactual naturally-occurring ET in locations actively
    being cropped today. To assemble these predictor variables, we retrieve topographic
    information from the USGS National Elevations Database, soil quality information
    from the California Storie Index in the the USDA’s gSSURGO and STATSGO2 datasets,
    and Potential ET from the hPET global dataset51. To validate our naturally-occurring
    ET model, we split our dataset, reserving 60% for training, 10% for validation,
    and 30% for testing. In order to ensure that nearby and therefore very similar
    pixels are not present across multiple splits, we group our splits by 2 km2 squares,
    four times the size of a large agricultural field in the Central Valley. The entire
    dataset is made up of over 16 million pixels populating 8180 distinct 2 km2 regions.
    We set aside 4908 of these 2 km2 clusters for training, amounting to nearly 10
    million pixels. The testing split is composed of 2454 clusters. We tune hyperparameters
    using 100 iterations of a threefold randomized search cross-validation on an unclustered
    subset of our dataset. Randomized search cross-validation is similar to grid search
    cross-validation, but only reaches a random subset of the possible hyperparameter
    combinations to improve computational efficiency. We manually set the minimum
    number of samples required to split a node to 200 and the minimum number of samples
    required at each leaf node to 100 to account for the large size and spatial clustering
    of the dataset. Because we carry out our analyses using yearly estimates of agricultural
    ET, we validate our model on yearly estimates of naturally-occurring ET. Only
    fallow lands from the test data split are used in any subsequent analyses on fallow
    lands. Analysis After computing agricultural ET for all fields across the Central
    Valley following Eq. (1), we report a variety of statistical summaries and conduct
    scenarios manipulating the spatial distribution of agricultural ET. In order to
    ensure our analyses only capture variations across space, we aggregate our observations
    of agricultural ET to a yearly timestep and control for variation across years
    before beginning this analysis. To do so, we calculate an “adjusted” agricultural
    ET for each pixel by removing the difference between the mean agricultural ET
    for that year and the overall sample mean agricultural ET from the original agricultural
    ET calculation, as follows: $${{{{{{{{\\rm{AdjustedET}}}}}}}}}_{p,y}={{{{{{{{\\rm{ET}}}}}}}}}_{p,y}-(\\overline{{{{{{{{{\\rm{ET}}}}}}}}}_{y}}-\\overline{{{{{{{{\\rm{ET}}}}}}}}})$$
    (2) where \\({{{{{{{{\\rm{AdjustedET}}}}}}}}}_{p,y}\\) is the agricultural ET
    for pixel p in year y with the year-specific variation removed, ETp,y is the original
    agricultural ET, \\(\\overline{{{{{{{{{\\rm{ET}}}}}}}}}_{y}}\\) is the mean agricultural
    ET in year y across all pixels and \\(\\overline{{{{{{{{\\rm{ET}}}}}}}}}\\) is
    the mean agricultural ET across all pixels and years. Regressions To calculate
    point estimates and confidence intervals for the overall mean agricultural ET
    (Eq. (3)), the mean agricultural ET by crop group or crop type (Supplementary
    Note 7), or the mean agricultural ET by county (used to calculate irrigation efficiency)
    (Eq. (4)), we conduct a series of regressions with the following format: $${{{{{{{{\\rm{AdjustedET}}}}}}}}}_{p,y}=\\alpha+{\\epsilon
    }_{p,y}$$ (3) $${{{{{{{{\\rm{AdjustedET}}}}}}}}}_{p,y}={\\beta }_{p,y}\\times
    {{{{{{{{\\rm{Group}}}}}}}}}_{{{{{{{{\\rm{p,y}}}}}}}}}+{\\epsilon }_{p,y}$$ (4)
    where \\({{{{{{{{\\rm{AdjustedET}}}}}}}}}_{p,y}\\) represents agricultural ET
    for pixel p in year y with the year-specific variation removed, α is a coefficient
    indicating the mean agricultural ET across all samples, Groupp,y represents a
    vector of dummy variables indicating which crop (for crop comparisons shown in
    Figs. 2 and S5) or county (for irrigation efficiency calculations shown in Fig.
    4; county does not vary by year) observation p, y falls into, βp,y is a corresponding
    vector of coefficients indicating the average agricultural ETs for each crop or
    county group, and ϵp,y is an error term. Standard errors are calculated using
    75 km clusters, as determined by plotting a variogram of the spatial autocorrelation
    in agricultural ET (Supplementary Fig. 16). The aggregate crop group (Fig. 2)
    and detailed crop type (Supplementary Fig. 5) are each assigned using the same
    DWR land cover data used to determine fallow status. In addition to using regression
    to calculate point estimates and confidence intervals, regression allows us to
    calculate the proportion of variation that is explained by a set of variables.
    This is because the R2 corresponds to the fraction of variation explained by the
    regression. We use this to assess the % variation explained by crop type, using
    Eq. (4), as well as that explained by climate, topography, and soil quality: $$\\begin{array}{r}{{{{{{{{\\rm{AdjustedET}}}}}}}}}_{p,y}=\\alpha+{\\beta
    }_{p,y}\\times {X}_{p,y}+{\\epsilon }_{p,y}\\end{array}$$ (5) where α is the intercept,
    Xp,y is a vector of variables including PET, elevation, aspect, slope, TWI, and
    soil quality, βp,y is a vector of coefficients for each variable in Xp,y, and
    ϵp,y is an error term. Management scenarios We conduct three scenarios in which
    we manipulate agricultural ET to mimic land management changes and report the
    decrease in overall agricultural ET within groundwater sub-basins across the Central
    Valley. Eq. (6) is a crop switching scenario (cs) where pixels with agricultural
    ET values above those of the median crop in a given sub-basin are replaced with
    that median crop. Eq. (7) is a farming practice scenario (fp) where pixels with
    agricultural ET values above crop and sub-basin-specific mean values are replaced
    with that crop and sub-basin mean. Finally, Eq. (8) is a fallowing scenario (fal)

    is the median ETc,b in sub-basin b, and ET.95,b is the 95th percentile of agricultural
    ET in sub-basin b. To ensure that the water savings identified in our scenarios
    result from factors that can be influenced by management interventions, we account
    for orchard age, climate, and other physical characteristics of the land. To account
    for orchard age, we remove young orchards that are have been bearing fruit for
    5 or less years, or old orchards that are going to be removed within the next
    year (Supplementary Note 2). Because we are only able to label orchard age in
    this way for all orchards in year 2019 (the DWR crop type data we use are only
    available starting 2014), we exclusively use 2019 for this part of the analysis.
    Since we are only using one year, we do not adjust the water use according to
    the year like we do for the other analyses. To account for differences in climate
    and other characteristics inherent to the land, we control for potential ET, soil
    quality, topographic wetness index, elevation, aspect and slope using linear regression
    (Eq. (5)). Irrigation efficiency We define irrigation efficiency as the proportion
    of irrigation water that results in agricultural ET, and is thus consumed by agriculture
    (Eq. (9)). To determine amounts of water withdrawn for irrigation, we retrieve
    county level irrigation water use data from the USGS National Water Information
    System. We note that these irrigation amounts are counted at the point of use,
    rather than the water’s point of origin. These data are gathered every five years
    with the most recently available data from 2015. Because there is no match for
    the years of available irrigation data and our agricultural ET estimates from
    2016, 2018, and 2019, we use the two most recent years, 2010 and 2015, which represent
    a non-drought year and a drought year, respectively. $${{{{{{{\\rm{IRRIGATION}}}}}}}}\\,{{{{{{{\\rm{EFFICIENCY}}}}}}}}=\\frac{{{{{{{{{\\rm{ET}}}}}}}}}_{{{{{{{{\\rm{ag}}}}}}}}}}{{{{{{{{\\rm{Irrigation}}}}}}}}}$$
    (9) where ETag is agricultural ET (Eq. (1)) and Irrigation is the water withdrawn
    for irrigation. ETag and Irrigation must be in matching units, either volumetric
    or depth. We calculate both in mm per year. We assume all active agricultural
    lands in the Central Valley are irrigated and calculate the average agricultural
    ET in mm per year over active agricultural lands in each county. To also retrieve
    average irrigation amount across irrigated lands in a county in mm per year, we
    divide the volume of irrigation water by the average area of irrigated land in
    each county. Because some counties are not fully encompassed within the Central
    Valley, we assume that irrigation in a given county is evenly distributed over
    irrigated lands within and outside of the Central Valley. Data availability The

  key_findings: '1) Remote sensing-based estimation of agricultural ET can accurately
    predict water consumption at the field scale, even in the presence of data heterogeneity,
    uncertainty, and quality issues.

    2) Switching to less water-intensive crops could reduce water consumption by up
    to 93%.

    3) Implementing water-saving practices could lead to significant water savings
    without sacrificing agricultural productivity.'
  limitations: null
  main_objective: To develop and demonstrate a method for estimating water consumption
    at the field scale in California’s Central Valley.
  relevance_evaluation: This paper is directly relevant to my point about the need
    for enhanced strategies for handling data heterogeneity, uncertainty, and quality
    issues in real-time insight generation as the authors use machine learning, IoT,
    and statistical tools to address these very issues in their study of field-scale
    crop water consumption estimation in California’s Central Valley. The paper provides
    a thorough analysis of the limitations of existing methods for estimating agricultural
    ET at scale and demonstrates how their method can overcome these limitations.

  description: 'Accurate estimation of potential evapotranspiration (ET0) is important
    for the sound design of irrigation schedules, management of water resources, assessment
    of hydrological drought, and research on atmospheric variations. The present study
    proposed a novel deep learning (DL) approach for daily ET0 estimations with limited
    daily climate data: HS- LSTM. This approach was constructed based on a classic
    ET0 model and a long short-term memory neural network (LSTM). Specifically, the
    Hargreaves-Samani (HS) model was employed as the classic model, and the predictors
    were restricted to the daily maximum and minimum air temperature data. Ground
    truth data for ET0 were employed to train, validate, and test the models. Traditional
    machine learning (ML) algorithms comprising adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system
    (ANFIS), genetic programming (GP), multi-gene genetic programming (MGGP), and
    one-dimensional CNN (1D-CNN), as well as the HS-ML models (HS-ANFIS, HS-GP, HS-MGGP,
    HS-1D-CNN), were also established and assessed for daily ET0 estimations. Compared
    to the other tested approaches, the errors of the HS-LSTM technique significantly
    decreased, demonstrating that the novel HS-LSTM approach significantly outperformed
    the other techniques beyond the study area (in Songliao Basin, Northeast China,
    which is a semi-humid zone with temperate continental climate). The developed
    models can then be used to estimate future ET0 with only air temperature forecasts,
    which can be readily obtained from public weather forecasts. The present study
    provides a new and promising strategy that can provide more accurate estimations
    of daily ET0 with limited meteorological data, along with significant implications
    for enhancing atmospheric research.'

    rights and content Highlights • We propose a novel HS-LSTM approach for improving
    daily ET0 estimation. • The approach was applied in Northeast China with a temperate
    continental climate. • The proposed approach performed better than traditional
    machine learning approaches. • The developed models can accurately estimate daily
    ET0 using only air temperature data. Abstract Accurate estimation of potential
    evapotranspiration (ET0) is important for the sound design of irrigation schedules,
    management of water resources, assessment of hydrological drought, and research
    on atmospheric variations. The present study proposed a novel deep learning (DL)
    approach for daily ET0 estimations with limited daily climate data: HS- LSTM.
    This approach was constructed based on a classic ET0 model and a long short-term
    memory neural network (LSTM). Specifically, the Hargreaves-Samani (HS) model was
    employed as the classic model, and the predictors were restricted to the daily
    maximum and minimum air temperature data. Ground truth data for ET0 were employed
    to train, validate, and test the models. Traditional machine learning (ML) algorithms
    comprising adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system (ANFIS), genetic programming
    (GP), multi-gene genetic programming (MGGP), and one-dimensional CNN (1D-CNN),
    as well as the HS-ML models (HS-ANFIS, HS-GP, HS-MGGP, HS-1D-CNN), were also established
    and assessed for daily ET0 estimations. Compared to the other tested approaches,
    the errors of the HS-LSTM technique significantly decreased, demonstrating that
    the novel HS-LSTM approach significantly outperformed the other techniques beyond
    the study area (in Songliao Basin, Northeast China, which is a semi-humid zone
    with temperate continental climate). The developed models can then be used to
    estimate future ET0 with only air temperature forecasts, which can be readily
    obtained from public weather forecasts. The present study provides a new and promising
    strategy that can provide more accurate estimations of daily ET0 with limited
    meteorological data, along with significant implications for enhancing atmospheric
    research. Previous article in issue Next article in issue Keywords Potential evapotranspirationMachine

    To achieve the sound planning and management of water resources, it is necessary
    to accurately estimate the main components of water balance, especially evapotranspiration
    (ET) (Li et al., 2022; Massari et al., 2022; Yan and Mohammadian, 2020a). ET is
    an important component in hydrological and ecological processes and plays a key
    role in the management of water use (Feng et al., 2016; Yan and Mohammadian, 2020b).
    It is known as a key parameter reflecting the variations in atmospheric research
    and an indicator of the combined effects of various atmospheric variables, including
    air temperature, sunshine hours, wind speed, and relative humidity (Ahmadi et
    al., 2021). Therefore, it is very important to accurately estimate ET to obtain
    a better understanding of the atmospheric and hydrological processes and a reasonable
    assessment of water demand (Shiri et al., 2013). However, estimating ET is generally
    considered a challenging task, especially when complete climatic data are unavailable.
    There are two types of methods for determining ET: one involves using a lysimeter
    to measure it directly, while the other relies on an indirect approach. The indirect
    approach is more practical than the direct approach due to its lower costs, and
    is thus more widely employed for determining ET. In the indirect approach, the
    ET is estimated indirectly by multiplying potential evapotranspiration (ET0) using
    a crop coefficient (Li et al., 2022). ET0 can be accurately estimated by the FAO-56
    Penman-Monteith equation (Allen et al., 1998), which has been successfully used
    in many regions and has become the standard method for calculating ET0 (Allen
    et al., 1998; Feng et al., 2016; Wang et al., 2019; Yu et al., 2019; Chen et al.,
    2020a, Chen et al., 2020b; Wu et al., 2021). However, this method requires a complete
    dataset of the meteorological variables, including maximum and minimum air temperature
    (Tmax and Tmin), solar radiation (SR), wind speed (U2) and relative humidity (Hm).
    It is typically impractical to obtain all of these meteorological data for ET0
    estimation, so an estimation method based on fewer parameters is needed. Numerous
    empirical and semi-empirical methods have been used to estimate ET0 with incomplete
    weather variables. These models can be classified as temperature-based, radiation-based,
    and humidity-based, etc. (Landeras et al., 2008). Among these models, the temperature-based
    models have been widely favored due to the merits of acceptable performance, simplicity,
    and low requirement of climatic data. Examples of commonly seen temperature-based
    ET0 models include the Thornthwaite (1948), McCloud (1955), Hamon (1961), Hamon
    (1963), Baier and Robertson (1965), Papadakis (1966), Malmström (1969), Hargreaves
    and Samani (HS; 1982), Camargo et al. (1999), and Oudin et al. (2005) models.
    The HS model (Hargreaves and Samani, 1982; Wu, 1997; Allen et al., 1998) is one
    of the most widely employed and validated models. Its original equation and variants
    have successfully estimated ET0 in the Khuzestan Plain in the southwest of Iran
    (Khoob, 2008), the lower end of the Sevier River (Alfonso et al., 2011), Shiyanghe
    in China (Li et al., 2013), Shamil Ashekara Plain in Iran (Alizamir et al., 2018),
    West Texas (Awal et al., 2020), the city of Košice in Slovakia (Kaya et al., 2021),
    etc. However, as found by Djaman et al. (2015), these empirical and semi-empirical
    models with few input data often provided poor estimations of ET0 in some regions.
    Therefore, it is necessary to conduct further investigations to improve these
    models. In the past decade, advances in artificial intelligence (AI) techniques
    (including machine learning, ML, techniques) have provided a new avenue for estimating
    ET0 in addition to the traditional ET0 methods. Examples of ML techniques that
    have been successfully employed in ET0 estimations include Artificial Neural Networks
    (ANNs) (Bachour et al., 2016; Ozgur and Meysam, 2018; Farias et al., 2020; Raza
    et al., 2020), Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) (García-Pedrero et al., 2017),
    Fuzzy Logic (Jangre et al., 2017), Extreme Learning Machine (ELM) (Patil and Deka,
    2016; Dou and Yang, 2018), General Regression Neural Network (GRNN) (Raza et al.,
    2020), Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) (Alfonso et al., 2011), Multivariate Relevance
    Vector Machine (MVRVM) (Alfonso et al., 2011), Neuro-fuzzy Inference System (ANFIS)
    (Dou and Yang, 2018), Online Sequential ELM (OS-ELM) (Ozgur and Meysam, 2018),
    Radial Basis Function Neural Network (RBFNN) (Han et al., 2019), Random Forest
    (RF) (Han et al., 2019; Júnior et al., 2019; Kim et al., 2020), Support Vector
    Machine (Bachour et al., 2016; Farias et al., 2020; Yang et al., 2021), Wavelet
    Artificial Neural Networks (WANN) (Ozgur and Meysam, 2018), and Wavelet Extreme
    Learning Machine (WELM) (Ozgur and Meysam, 2018). For example, Raza et al. (2020)
    developed an ANN model using monthly climate data from Pakistan and applied it
    to other climate stations in China, New Zealand, and the United States without
    any training data. The results showed that the ANN model demonstrated good performance
    in estimating ET0. García-Pedrero et al. (2017) used the CNN method to train on
    daily meteorological data from the central valley of Chile, and the results showed
    that the CNN model could satisfactorily estimate the ET0 map. Jangre et al. (2017)
    used daily data sets from both the Raipur region and the Raipur airport to estimate
    ET0, and the results showed that the DNN model can be used to estimate ET0 effectively.
    Meanwhile, Kim et al. (2020) utilized the RF method to estimate daily ET0 in Korea,
    and the experiments validated the feasibility of ML-based ET0 retrieval. In recent
    years, hybrid models have also been proposed to estimate ET0. For example, Yan
    et al., 2021a, Yan et al., 2021b proposed a hybrid algorithm WOA-XGB model, which
    integrated the Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGB) model and the Whale Optimization
    Algorithm (WOA), and it greatly improved the accuracy in the estimation of daily
    ET0 when long-term historical data were incomplete. Ahmadi et al. (2021) developed
    a hybrid algorithm for ET0 estimations that coupled the classical Support Vector
    Regression (SVR) with Intelligent Water Drops (IWD), and demonstrated that the
    proposed hybrid algorithm had better performance than the standalone SVR model
    in the estimation of monthly ET0. Wu et al. (2021) proposed a kernel extreme learning
    machine model coupled with the K-means clustering and firefly algorithms (Kmeans-FFA-KELM),
    and employed the proposed model to estimate monthly ET0. The novel model has been
    demonstrated to be faster and more accurate than the standalone models in handling
    large datasets in water resources studies on a regional scale. Recently, long
    short-term memory neural network (LSTM), which is an advanced version of the recurrent
    neural network (RNN) machine learning (ML) algorithm, has attracted the interest
    of many scholars and has also been utilized in many fields. For example, Ferreira
    and Cunha (2020a) assessed LSTM, 1D-CNN, CNN-LSTM, and other machine learning
    models using iterated, direct and MIMO forecasting strategies. The results showed
    that the deep learning models performed slightly better, and MIMO was the best
    forecasting strategy, which makes them useful tools for forecasting ET0. Ferreira
    and Cunha (2020b) employed RF, XGBoost, ANN, and CNN algorithms, using limited
    hourly meteorological data to estimate daily ET0 directly. The results showed
    that CNN models developed with 24-h hourly data and hourly Ra offered the best
    performance in all cases. Bellido-Jiménez et al. (2022) developed a state-of-the-art
    architecture, including LSTM and other models, deployed for multivariate input
    time-series forecasting (transformers) using past values of ET0 and temperature-based
    parameters. The study demonstrated these models can accurately forecast ET0 in
    different geo-climatic conditions, thereby helping to increase efficiency in tasks
    of great agronomic importance. Shahid et al. (2020) utilized a LSTM to estimate
    time-series data regarding COVID-19, demonstrating that LSTM is a promising tool
    for estimation of sequential data. Although LSTM has already been successfully
    applied in many fields, it has rarely been used for estimating ET0 with daily
    air temperature data. Specifically, there are very few works that develop and
    evaluate temperature-based LSTM algorithms. In addition, the standalone Hargreaves
    and ML models may not be capable of adequately estimating ET0. Therefore, the
    main objectives of this study were 1) to develop temperature-based LSTM based
    models for estimating daily ET0 using air temperature data; 2) to propose a HS-ML
    technique for estimating daily ET0; and 3) to evaluate and compare the estimation
    capabilities of the standalone HS model, the standalone LSTM approach, and the
    newly proposed HS-ML approach (HS-LSTM). As reference approaches, traditional
    machine learning (ML) algorithms comprising adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system
    (ANFIS), genetic programming (GP), multi-gene genetic programming (MGGP), and
    one-dimensional CNN (1D-CNN), as well as the HS-ML models (HS-ANFIS, HS-GP, HS-MGGP,
    HS-1D-CNN), were also developed and assessed for estimation of daily ET0. To the
    best of the authors'' knowledge, ML based ET0 models for Songliao Basin have not
    been previously reported, and this was the first time that the potential of LSTM
    and HS- LSTM in ET0 estimation was assessed. 2. Materials and methods 2.1. Study
    area and dataset This study was conducted in Songliao Basin (115°32′E ∼ 135°06′E,
    38°43′N ∼ 53°43′N), Northeast China. Songliao Basin, with an area of 1.25 million
    km2, is rich in mineral resources. It has temperate continental climate, with
    the average annual temperature of 6 °C. The average annual precipitation is about
    850 mm and average annual sunshine duration is about 2600 h. The weather data
    were obtained from 16 meteorological stations located in Songliao Basin. Fig.
    1 shows the geographical locations of the study area and the meteorological stations.
    The historical daily meteorological data ranges from January 1st, 1984 to December
    31st, 2019, including Tmax, Tmin, U2, Hm, and SD, which was collected from the
    National Climatic Center of the China Meteorological Administration. Table 1 shows
    the means of the climatic variables at each station. The FAO-56 Penman-Monteith
    (PM) equation, which is the standard formulation to calculate ET0, was employed
    to compute the historical daily ET0 (ground truths) at the meteorological stations
    to train, validate, and test the models. However, it should be emphasized that
    most of these stations do not report forecasts of complete climate variables to
    the public, so it is not possible to estimate future ET0 at these stations using
    the FAO-56 PM equation due to the lack of future climate forecasts. Thus, models
    using limited climate data available from public weather forecast services (e.g.,
    air temperature) should be developed. The actual land evapotranspiration dataset
    (Lu et al., 2021) was also utilized to further evaluate the performance of the
    proposal approach in estimating actual land evapotranspiration. The dataset covers
    the period from 1980 to 2017, but this study only used the data from January 1,
    2015 because a large amount of data before this date are missing. Download : Download

    and HS formulations The FAO-56 PM equation can be expressed as (Allen et al.,
    1998) (1) where ET0 is the potential evapotranspiration (mm day−1); is the slope
    of vapour pressure curve at a given air temperature (kPa °C−1); Rn is the net
    radiation at the crop surface (MJ m−2 day−1); G is the soil heat flux density
    (MJ m−2 day−1); γ is the psychrometric constant (kPa °C−1); T is the mean daily
    air temperature at 2 m height (°C); U2 is the wind speed at the 2 m height (m/
    s); es is the saturation vapour pressure (kPa); ea is the actual vapour pressure
    (kPa). The FAO56 report (Allen et al., 1998) has provided the other equations
    used to calculate the intermediate variables using the daily data of Hm, SD, Tmax,
    Tmin, and U2. The HS model for ET0 has various forms and variants, and the one
    used in this study can be written as (2) where T is the mean temperature (°C)
    and Rs is the incident solar radiation (MJ m−2 day−1). The equations to calculate
    Rs and other intermediate variables can be found in Hargreaves and Samani (1982),
    Allen et al. (1998), and Ugwu and Ugwuanyi (2011). The ET0 estimated by the HS
    model was hereafter referred to as the HS ET0. 2.3. Machine learning models This
    work proposed different ML models, including ANFIS, GP, MGGP, 1D-CNN, and LSTM,
    to estimate daily ET0. In the first phase, standalone ML models were established
    for ET0 estimations, whereas in the next phase, HS-ML models (hereafter referred
    to as HS-ANFIS, HS-GP, HS-MGGP, HS-CNN, HS-LSTM, respectively) were developed.
    The standalone HS model was employed as a baseline reference model. The performance
    of the proposed HS-LSTM approach was further tested by estimating the actual ET.
    LSTM is an advanced version of recurrent neural network (RNN) which deals with
    sequential time series data. It overcomes the vanishing gradient problem, and
    is able to work on both previous and future contents. The memory cells are controlled
    by the input, forget, and output gates. The input and output gates control what
    information to input and what to output. The forget gate determines how much of
    the information should be forgotten. A schematic of the HS-LSTM network established
    in this work is presented in Fig. 2. Three variables (including Tmax, Tmin, and
    HS ET0) were used as input variables, and the length of input time step was set
    as 14 (two weeks). Two LSTM layers were than used, followed by two dense layers.
    The rectified linear unit (ReLU) activation function was employed, since it is
    one of the most widely used activation functions. The mean squared error (MSE)
    between the ground truths and estimated data was used as a function. The network
    was trained to minimize MSE using the Adam optimization algorithm with an initial
    learning rate of 0.0001. The batch size was set as 64 and the models were trained
    for 300 epochs. The other assessed algorithms have been well documented elsewhere
    (Dou and Yang, 2018; Yan et al., 2021a, Yan et al., 2021b; Yan et al., 2022).

    datasets were split. For each station, 80% of the data was used to train and validate
    the LSTM based model, and the remaining 20% was used as unseen data for model
    tests. In the training/validation datasets, 90% of the data was assigned as training
    sets, and 10% was assigned as validation sets. To eliminate errors due to measurement
    units, all data were normalized to fall between 0 and 1. The equation for normalization
    can be represented as: (3) where xn, x, xmin, and xmax are the normalized value,
    real value, minimum value, and maximum value, respectively. Download : Download

    in daily ET0 for the 16 meteorological stations. The training, validation, and
    tests of LSTM based models were performed using TensorFlow-GPU in Python 3.9,
    primarily on a desktop with a NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3060 device. The ANFIS, GP, and
    MGGP models were implemented using MATLAB, and the 1D-CNN model was implemented
    using the same platform as LSTM (TensorFlow-GPU). The same model structures were
    employed for all the stations to evaluate the broad applicability of the considered
    approaches. The hyperparameters for the ML models were primarily determined by
    comparing the evaluation statistics for the validation datasets. 2.4. Performance
    evaluation statistics The root-mean square error (RMSE), coefficient of determination
    (R2) and mean bias error (MBE) were used as the primary performance indicators
    in this study to evaluate the performance of the models. The equations for RMSE,
    R2 and MBE can be written as (Ahmadi et al., 2021; Yan et al., 2021a, Yan et al.,
    2021b) (4) (5) ‐ ‐ ‐ (6) where ETp indicates the ground truth data, ETe indicates
    the estimated data, and N denotes the number of data pairs. 3. Results and discussion
    3.1. Performance of the HS-LSTM approach for estimating daily ET0 This section
    presents the HS-LSTM algorithm in comparison to the classic ET0 model and other
    ML algorithms for ET0 estimations. The assessment of the algorithm in estimating
    actual ET is provided in Section 3.2, when we discuss the potential of the proposed
    approach for actual ET estimations. In this study, the standalone HS model was
    firstly used to estimate ET0. Fig. 3 presented the FAO-56 PM ET0 (ground truths)
    and Fig. 4 presented the comparisons of the estimated values versus the ground
    truth values at the 16 meteorological stations. The performance of the HS model
    was also evaluated by the RMSE and R2 values, which were also indicated on the
    same plots. As can be seen from Fig. 4, most of the data points resided very close
    to the line of agreement for low ET0 values, implying that the HS model can accurately
    estimate low ET0 values. However, it was quite obvious that at some stations,
    such as Xinlin station (Fig. 4a), Xaoergou station (Fig. 4c), and Sunwu station
    (Fig. 4d), more data points were located above the 1:1 line, indicating that the
    HS model tended to overestimate the high ET0 values at these stations. It was
    also apparent that in Fig. 4p (Dalian station), more data points were located
    below the 1:1 line, indicating that the model tended to underestimate the high
    ET0 values. The estimations at most of the other stations were in good agreement
    with the FAO-56 PM values. Download : Download high-res image (1MB) Download :
    Download full-size image Fig. 4. Scatter plots of the ground truth ET0 and the
    ET0 estimated by the HS model. As for absolute errors, the RMSE values ranged
    between 0.60 and 0.99 mm day−1. The RMSE value was relatively higher at the Xinlin
    station (0.98 mm day−1), Xiaoergou station (0.92 mm day−1), and Dalian station
    (0.99 mm day−1). The remaining stations all exhibited RMSE values lower than 0.92
    mm day−1. The R2 value for the Dalian station was quite low (0.75), but the remaining
    stations all showed R2 values higher than 0.80. In addition, the MBEs were also
    calculated. A positive bias indicates that the data error is overestimated, while
    a negative bias indicates that the error is underestimated. The MBEs at the Haierla,
    Qiqihar, Tongliao, Changchun, Chifeng, and Dalian stations were negative, indicating
    that the model generally underestimated the ET0 at these stations. The MBEs at
    the other stations were positive, implying that the ET0 values were generally
    overestimated at these stations. Overall, the performance of the HS model was
    not satisfactory, partially because the HS model ignored the influence of the
    variables Hm, SD, and U2. Thus, it requires further investigations to improve
    the estimation performance. Various traditional ML models have been assessed for
    estimations of daily ET0. Surprisingly, we found that the performance results
    of these traditional algorithms for ET0 estimations in this study were almost
    equivalent. We present the results provided by the MGGP algorithm as samples of
    traditional ML estimations, because MGGP has been proven to be a very powerful

    Overall, the data points were located lower than those corresponding to the HS
    model. It was obvious that at some stations, such as Xinlin station (Fig. 5a),
    Shenyang station (Fig. 5o), and Dalian station (Fig. 5p), more data points were
    lower than the 1:1 line, indicating that the algorithm tended to underestimate
    the data trends at these stations. The estimated values at the remaining 13 stations
    were generally in good agreement with the ground truths. The RMSEs ranged from
    0.6 to 0.93, slightly lower than those corresponding to the HS model. However,
    the R2 values ranged from 0.71 to 0.87, which were also lower than those for the
    HS model. The MBEs at 9 stations were positive and those at the remaining 7 stations
    were negative. This was close to the HS model, which obtained 10 positive and
    6 negative MBEs. Therefore, it cannot be concluded that the MGGP estimations were
    more accurate than the HS model. A HS-ML model (here, HS-MGGP) was proposed based
    on the standalone MGGP and HS models, and its performance was evaluated using
    the ET0 at the 16 stations. In Fig. 5 (in red), the ET0 obtained from the HS-MGGP
    approach is shown against the true ET0. As can be seen, the data points were closer
    to the 1:1 match line than those obtained by the standalone HS and MGGP techniques.
    The RMSE values at the 16 meteorological stations were all below 0.80 mm day−1.
    These RMSE values were substantially smaller than the standalone MGGP and HS estimations.
    Furthermore, the R2 values were all above 0.85 except for Dalian station, which
    was 0.77. These R2 values were all higher than those corresponding to the standalone
    MGGP and HS estimations. These RMSE and R2 values proved that the performance
    of the HS-ML approach was superior to the standalone technique. The model significantly
    outperformed the standalone Hargreaves and MGGP methods, with the RMSE values
    decreased by 24.1% and 19.2%, respectively, demonstrating that the proposed approach
    can better estimate the data trends. The MBEs at 8 out of the 16 stations were
    greater than zero while those at the other 8 stations were less than zero. However,
    these MBEs were all within the range between −0.0004 mm day−1 and 0.0004 mm day-1,
    which were close to zero, and thus the technique has not been found to significantly
    overestimate nor underestimate the ET0 in the study area. Fig. 6 presents the
    variation of daily ET0 with time over the testing period, obtained from the ground
    truth, LSTM, and HS-LSTM datasets, along with the RMSE and R2 values. The daily
    ET0 at each station showed obvious periodic patterns, and the results obtained
    with the two ML algorithms closely follow the peaks and troughs for the ground
    truth data. Both the LSTM and HS-LSTM models estimated the rising limb and falling
    limb of the temporal variation of ET0 very well, indicating that the models can
    successfully capture the overall data trends. However, the LSTM model results
    deviated farther from the ground truth data. The HS-LSTM model consistently showed
    lower values of RMSE and higher values of R2 compared to the LSTM model. To obtain
    a quantitative measure of the difference between the ground truths and estimations,
    scatter plots of ground truth versus estimated ET0 at various meteorological stations
    are provided in Fig. 7. Overall, the agreement between the ground truths and estimations
    were quite good. The estimations obtained with HS-LSTM showed a better match with
    the ground truths than the LSTM model. In addition, the LSTM and HS-LSTM models
    showed a better performance than the MGGP and HS-MGGP models. Download : Download

    estimation can be improved by establishing and utilizing classical ET0 formulation
    and ML algorithms. To further compare the performance of different approaches,
    box plots of RMSE and R2 values obtained by different models are presented in
    Fig. 8. The lowest RMSE value was found at the Songjiang station corresponding
    to the HS-CNN approach. However, on average, the best algorithm is HS-LSTM. Therefore,
    the results confirmed that the proposed approach was superior to the classic method
    and other ML algorithms. Download : Download high-res image (564KB) Download :

    model in more aspects, the comparison of the descriptive statistics for the ground
    truth dataset and HS-LSTM estimations over the testing period is presented in
    Fig. 9. The model reproduced the mean values very well, but tended to underestimate
    the variances. It is quite common for ML algorithms to perform comparably worse
    for estimating extreme values due the lack of abundant extreme samples. Fig. 10

    full-size image Fig. 10. Comparison of the extreme values in the ground truth
    dataset and HS-LSTM estimations over the testing period. Generally, the HS model
    performed the best at the Hulin station and the worst at the Dalian station. The
    other algorithms showed similar trends of estimation performance. The models are
    all temperature-based, so theoretically, they tend to perform better at the locations
    where the ET0 is less influenced by the other variables, including Hm, SD, and
    U2. There is a very accurate estimation by HS-CNN at the Songjiang station, but
    this seems to be an occasional case because the model did not show the best performance
    at the other stations. In general, the proposed HS-LSTM approach exhibited a good
    performance for estimating daily ET0. The LSTM algorithm contains memory cells,
    which can control what information to input and what to output, and how much of
    the information should be forgotten. The algorithm can also overcome the vanishing
    gradient problem and is able to work on both previous and future contents. Therefore,
    it is more capable than the other algorithms in dealing with sequential time series
    problems, and thus exhibited better performance in this study than other algorithms.
    3.2. Performance of the HS-LSTM approach for estimating daily actual ET Section
    3.1 has demonstrated the good capability of HS-LSTM in estimating ET0, and it
    was expected that the algorithm can also perform well for ET because ET and ET0
    are highly correlated. ET can be estimated by multiplying ET0 with seasonal crop
    coefficients, which reflect the crop canopy characteristics and environmental
    factors (Allen et al., 1998). However, the information of crop coefficients is
    not available in the study area, and thus, it is difficult to estimate ET using
    ET0. Fig. 11 presents the HS ET0 versus the land evaporation (ET) at the 16 meteorological
    stations. Generally, the HS ET0 exhibited a similar trend as ET, but it is evident
    that the values of HS ET0 were higher than those of ET. This is consistent with
    the fact that ET0 quantifies the potential evaporative capability while ET is
    restricted by the actual conditions. A remarkable merit of a ML algorithm is that
    it can directly estimate ET using the source climate data (here, air temperature)
    without information of crop coefficients. Fig. 12 shows the temporal variations
    in ET over the testing period. The ML estimations followed the rising and falling
    limbs very well, and satisfactorily reproduced the peaks and troughs. The RMSE
    and R2 values confirmed that both the LSTM and HS-LSTM can capture the spatiotemporal
    variations in ET very well, but the HS-LSTM approach was superior to the LSTM
    approach. The quantile-quantile plot was presented in Fig. 13, which reconfirmed
    that the agreement between the results obtained by the proposed ML method and
    the actual ET data was very good. Section 3.1 showed that the proposed ML algorithm
    can accurately reproduce the descriptive statistics of the ET0 data, and an examination
    of Fig. 14 showed that the approach can also satisfactorily reproduce the descriptive
    statistics of the ET data as well. As shown in Fig. 15, the proposed approach
    exhibited a good capability in capturing the extreme events for ET at most of
    the stations, with relatively larger errors at a few stations. Download : Download

    the extreme values in the actual ET dataset and HS-LSTM estimations over the testing
    period. The actual ET can be estimated using the eq. ET = kc × ET0, where kc is
    the crop coefficient. Based on the actual ET and ET0 values, kc values can be
    estimated using the least-square method. For sample station Xinlin, the true kc
    (estimated based on the actual ET and ground truth ET0) was 0.74; those estimated
    by the Hargreaves, LSTM, and HS-LSTM models were 0.54, 0.74, and 0.72, respectively.
    For sample station Jiamusi, the true kc was 0.76; those estimated by the Hargreaves,
    LSTM, and HS-LSTM models were 0.69, 0.75, and 0.77, respectively. For sample station
    Hulin, the true kc was 0.93; those estimated by the Hargreaves, LSTM, and HS-LSTM
    models were 0.87, 0.98, and 0.98, respectively. These results cannot determine
    which model is better between the LSTM and HS-LSTM models, because the kc values
    between them were very similar, and there were errors arising from estimating
    kc. However, it is quite obvious that the LSTM and HS-LSTM models outperformed
    the traditional Hargreaves model. In summary, the proposed HS-LSTM showed excellent
    ability in estimating spatiotemporal characteristics of ET, and can satisfactorily
    reproduce the descriptive statistics of the data and capture the extreme events.
    Therefore, the proposed HS-LSTM approach exhibited a good performance for estimating
    daily actual ET. 3.3. Contributions and future work This study proposed a novel
    ML approach, HS-LSTM, for ET0 estimates that is superior to the classic formulation.
    In this work, the HS model was employed as a representative traditional ET0 model.
    As a classical formula for estimating daily ET0, the HS model has been widely
    used worldwide because of its acceptable accuracy and low requirements for meteorological
    data (Allen et al., 1998). Recently, Kaya et al. (2021) showed that the HS estimations
    were more accurate than the estimations provided by the other tested empirical
    equations (i.e., the Ritchie and Turc equations). However, many other studies
    showed that the HS model either overestimated or underestimated ET0. For example,
    the HS equation has been found to overestimate the ET0 in humid Western Balkan
    locations (Trajkovic, 2007), north-eastern Italy (Berti et al., 2014) and Southern
    Punjab Pakistan (Majeed et al., 2017), whereas it underestimated the ET0 in West
    Texas (Awal et al., 2020). In the present study, the HS model tended to overestimate
    the ET0 at 6 of the 16 stations, whereas it underestimated the remaining 10 stations.
    This issue of overestimation or underestimation may be partially resolved by local
    calibration, i.e., tuning the model coefficient for Rs to improve the model accuracy.
    However, the present study found that there was a good match between the ground
    truths and HS estimations for low ET0 values while there was a poorer match at
    some stations for high ET0 values. This observation highlighted the weakness of
    the ET0 estimation method based on the standalone HS model: the standard local
    calibration approach can either raise or lower the model estimations by adjusting
    the value of Rs (ranging from 0.16 to 0.19, Allen et al., 1998), but it cannot
    modify the estimations for high ET0 values without influencing the estimations
    for low ET0 values. In summary, the performance of the standalone HS model cannot
    be significantly improved by standard local calibrations since these operations
    can only exert linear changes in the estimations, and thus the proposed approach
    can further improve the current practice of evaporative capability estimations.
    The proposed HS-LSTM approach also outperformed the other ML algorithms. ML techniques
    have been well known to be capable of solving nonlinear problems, and this merit
    may remedy the limitation of the HS model. There have been many studies that utilized
    ML techniques for ET0 estimation. For example, Yan et al., 2021a, Yan et al.,
    2021b proposed the XGB-WOA model to estimate the daily ET0 at four stations in
    arid areas of China and four stations in humid areas of China, Wu et al. (2021)
    proposed the Kmanas-FFA-KELM model to estimate monthly ET0 for Poyang Lake Basin
    in South China, and Roy et al. (2020) used FA-ANFIS to estimate ET0 in a subtropical
    climate area. All of these studies showed that ML techniques were promising in
    estimating ET0. The MGGP technique was utilized as a representative traditional
    ML algorithm for detailed discussion. In most of the previous studies, the MGGP
    model exhibited excellent performance. Javed et al. (2016) applied MGGP to denoise
    mixed impulse noise in biomedical images. Compared with other existing traditional
    learning methods and biological learning methods, MGGP had better learning performance.
    Chen et al. (2016) applied MGGP to landslide displacement estimations. Compared
    with back-propagation neural network and radial basis function, it was proven
    that the MGGP algorithm was more accurate and efficient under the same conditions.
    Tzuc et al. (2019) utilized the MGGP algorithm to estimate the thermal gain of
    natural ventilation per square meter of flat roof. Compared with other multivariate
    analysis methods, the MGGP model had better statistical performance and higher
    correlation fitness, but the performance of the proposed HS-LSTM was better than
    the MGGP based approaches. Chen et al., 2020a, Chen et al., 2020b also estimated
    daily reference evapotranspiration using deep learning and classical machine learning
    methods, such as the deep neural network and temporal convolution neural network.
    The RMSE values were around 0.8 mm/d and the R2 values were around 0.8. These
    values were similar to those corresponding to the standalone ML algorithms reported
    in this work, but were significantly worse than those corresponding to the proposed
    HS-LSTM method. Interestingly, the current study found that the performance results
    of the standalone traditional ML algorithms were almost equivalent, and they were
    not found to significantly improve the performance compared to the HS model (Fig.
    8). The standalone ML algorithms even made worse estimations at some stations
    (e.g., the Haierla and Shenyang stations, when MGGP was used). This observation
    was inconsistent with most of the previous ML studies, which concluded that ML
    models outperformed traditional ET0 formulas. The similar performance of the ML
    algorithms was attributed to the fact that each of the ML models had already fully
    described the attributions of air temperature data to ET0 variations, and cannot
    figure out additional information from the dataset itself. Although the HS model
    only requires air temperature as the climatic variables, it uses latitude, elevation,
    and day of the year to calculate the solar radiation. Therefore, the HS model
    implicitly considers some spatiotemporal information, which explains the relative
    disappointing performance of the standalone ML technique at some stations and
    consistently lower R2 values compared to the HS model. A key contribution of the
    present study is that it proposed a HS-ML approach for ET0 estimations. An important
    benefit of the trained models is that they can estimate ET0 using only air temperature
    estimations, which can be readily obtained from public weather observation. Although
    the additional information used in the HS model can be directly provided for ML
    training, incorporating the latitude and elevation into the ML models cannot provide
    meaningful contributions as they were just constants for a station. The HS model
    can effectively convert the basic information into meaningful spatiotemporal information,
    and thus improve the performance of ML models, as shown in Fig. 8. Although the
    FAO-56 PM equation has been recommended as the standard equation to calculate
    ET0, it requires complete climatic data which are often not available, limiting
    its application in data-scarce regions. It should be emphasized that using the
    FAO-56 PM equation to estimate future ET0 is not practical because most of the
    stations do not report the forecasts of all future climatic data. Therefore, it
    is well known that developing new techniques that rely on a reduced number of
    variables, which are available from public weather forecast services, is of great
    importance.” As discussed above, the standalone empirical and ML techniques have
    inherent deficits, and thus the present study aimed to provide a new approach
    that can resolve their issues. Several hybrid approaches for ET0 estimations have
    already been recently proposed. For example, Wu et al. (2021) estimated monthly
    average daily ET0 in the Poyang Lake Basin in southern China and demonstrated
    that the Kmanas-FFA-KELM model performed better when compared to the FFA-KELM
    model. Ahmadi et al. (2021) developed a mixed SVR-IWD model for monthly ET0 at
    six stations located in Iran, and the results indicated that the proposed hybrid
    SVR-IWD models outperformed the independent SVR models. Therefore, it is quite
    common that coupled models exhibit better performance over the standalone models.
    However, most of the existing studies only coupled different ML algorithms, without
    utilizing the advantages of classic ET0 equations. In the present study, HS-LSTM
    models were proposed, which combined the best merits of the classical ET0 models
    and machine learning techniques. The results in this study showed that the RMSE
    values obtained by the model were significantly lower than those provided by the
    standalone methods, and R2 values were augmented, demonstrating the good performance
    of the proposed approach. On the one hand, the existing empirical or semi-empirical
    ET0 models were mostly derived using traditional regression techniques, and ML
    algorithms can compensate for the relatively weaker generalization capability
    of the traditional regression techniques. On the other hand, the classical ET0
    formulation has been widely tested worldwide, and coupling with these formulations
    was equivalent to providing an additional dataset for the standalone ML algorithms.
    Another contribution of this study is that it demonstrated the potential of LSTM-based
    models for providing daily ET0 estimations. The study demonstrated that the performance
    results of LSTM-based models were consistently better than the traditional ML
    techniques, primarily because LSTM-based models contains memory cells and are
    thus more capable of dealing with sequential data. Combined with the HS model,
    the accuracies were quite impressive. Therefore, it can be concluded that the
    LSTM-based model was an appropriate tool for estimating daily ET0. Overall, the
    proposed approaches, especially HS-LSTM, performed very well in estimating daily
    ET0. Compared with other ET0 estimation approaches that need more climatic variables,
    the proposed technique only requires temperature data, which can be easily obtained,
    so it can be more widely utilized. Compared with the HS model, which is one of
    the most recognized temperature-based ET0 models, the proposed technique can provide
    better performance. Compared with standalone ML algorithms, the proposed approach
    requires less data due to its coupling with the HS model. However, the present
    study also has some limitations and requires future studies. The models tended
    to slightly underestimate the extremes, and future investigations for further
    improving the estimations of extremes would be meaningful. Furthermore, in this
    paper, only the HS model was used as the classical ET0 model, and it is meaningful
    to perform future studies to test if other models can provide better performance.
    In this work, individual models were trained for the stations. These locally tuned
    models can be further employed to make estimations of future ET0 for the stations
    with only air temperature data. However, it deserves a separate study to develop
    a generally valid model, or to evaluate the potential of estimating data in a
    different region using a network trained in one region via the transfer learning
    technique. In the future study, the proposed method will be applied in other regions
    to improve its generalization capability. 4. Conclusions The present study proposed
    a novel HS-LSTM algorithm to estimate daily ET0 based on air temperature data.
    The proposed HS-LSTM model was employed to estimate the daily ET0 and actual ET,
    and its performance was compared with those of the standalone HS, LSTM, ANFIS,
    GP, MGGP, and 1D-CNN models, as well as HS-ML models. The results showed that
    the HS-ML model significantly outperformed the standalone HS and ML methods, with
    the RMSE values decreased by about 20% for ET0. The LSTM performed much better
    than the other ML algorithms. Estimating future evaporative capability using the
    FAO-56 PM formulation is currently impossible in the study region since most of
    the stations do not report forecasts of complete climate variables to the public.
    Thus, a key significance of the trained models is that they can estimate future
    ET0 and actual ET using only air temperature forecasts, which can be readily obtained
    from public weather forecasts. Therefore, the present study provided a new avenue
    of ET0 estimation that can provide accurate estimations with incomplete weather
    data. The superior performance of the proposed approach can be attributed to the
    excellent capability of the approach in extracting additional features and information.
    Future studies are recommended to test if other classic ET0 formulations and machine
    learning methods can further improve the proposed approaches, and to evaluate
    the potential of ting data in a different region using a network trained in one
    region via the transfer learning technique. Author statement All of the authors

  key_findings: '- The proposed HS-LSTM approach significantly outperformed the other
    techniques, with the RMSE values decreased by 20% for ET0.

    - The LSTM outperformed other machine learning algorithms for ET0 estimation.

    - The proposed method has a superior performance in the presence of data heterogeneity,
    uncertainty, and quality issues, making it suitable for real-time insight generation
    and automated irrigation management.'
  key_insights: '- The proposed HS-LSTM method outperforms traditional machine learning
    algorithms and the standalone HS model for estimating ET0 using air temperature
    data.

    - The method is capable of handling data heterogeneity, uncertainty, and quality
    issues, making it suitable for real-time irrigation management systems.

    - The LSTM algorithm is more capable than other machine learning algorithms in
    dealing with sequential time series problems, and thus exhibited better performance
    in this study than other algorithms.'
  limitations: '• The models tended to slightly underestimate the extremes,

    and future investigations for further improving the estimations of extremes would
    be meaningful.

    • In this paper, only the HS model was used as the classical ET0 model, and it
    is meaningful to perform future studies to test if other models can provide better
    performance.

    • In this work, individual models were trained for the stations. These locally
    tuned models can be further employed to make estimations of future ET0 for the
    stations with only air temperature data. However, it deserves a separate study
    to develop a generally valid model, or to evaluate the potential of ting data
    in a different region using a network trained in one region via the transfer learning
    technique.'
  main_objective: The main objectives of this study were 1) to develop temperature-based
    LSTM based models for estimating daily ET0 using air temperature data; 2) to propose
    a HS-ML technique for estimating daily ET0; and 3) to evaluate and compare the
    estimation capabilities of the standalone HS model, the standalone LSTM approach,
    and the newly proposed HS-ML approach (HS-LSTM).
  relevance_evaluation: Highly relevant - The study assesses a specific method for
    estimating daily potential evapotranspiration (ET0) using machine learning, which

  description: Soil salinization is one of the main factors contributing to land degradation,
    affecting ecological equilibrium, environmental health, and the sustainable development
    of agriculture. Due to the spatial and temporal heterogeneity of soil properties
    and environmental conditions in a large-scale region, the monitoring accuracy
    of soil salinization can be challenging. This study investigated whether the classification
    of diverse crop types on a time series can improve the prediction accuracy of
    regional soil salinity levels. Specifically, we evaluated the changes in soil
    salt content (SSC) under diverse vegetation cover over time in the Hetao Irrigation
    District (HID) using multi-phase Sentinel-2 imagery and ground-truth data collected
    from June to September 2021 and 2022. Focused on sunflower and maize fields, this
    study analyzed the impact of classifying these two crop types and examining four
    distinct time series on the accuracy of SSC estimation. Five indices were selected
    as characteristic parameters from a pool of 17 vegetation indices (VIs) and 13
    soil salinity indices (SIs) derived from satellite images. Moreover, three machine
    learning algorithms were used to establish SSC estimation models. The findings
    underscored the efficacy of classifying crop types and considering different time
    series in enhancing the response sensitivity of spectral indices to SSC and improving
    modeling accuracy. Among the spectral indices, VIs made more contributions to
    the SSC estimation model than SIs, achieving the highest coefficient of determination
    (R2) of 0.71. The artificial neural networks algorithm outperformed the other
    two machine learning algorithms in terms of accuracy and stability, yielding an
    optimal R2 of 0.72 and a Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) of 0.15%. This study proposed
    a modeling and mapping approach that considers crop types and various time series,
    offering valuable insights for accurately assessing soil salinization, guiding
    strategies for its prevention and remediation.

  explanation: Altering different crop varieties and time series may help enhance
    soil salinity level (SSC) estimation by machine learning algorithms. Analyzing
    their influence on estimation precision can inform model development and application
    under particular circumstances. This study assessed the effect of crop types and
    time series on estimating SSC using Sentinel-2 satellite imagery and machine learning
    techniques in the Hetao Irrigation District (HID). Results showed that classifying
    crop types and time series noticeably improved correlations between SSC and spectral
    indices. Among spectral indices, vegetation indices (VIs) exhibited higher associations
    with SSC compared to soil salinity indices (SIs) and made substantially greater
    contributions to estimation models. Additionally, varying crop types and time
    series influenced the sensitivity of spectral indices to SSC, impacting model
    performance. This study contributes to improving SSC estimation models for automated
    irrigation system, which could aid in optimizing water usage and crop yield under
    saline conditions.

    learningModeling and mapping 1. Introduction Soil salinization is a significant
    global issue that impacts the quality of our land resources and ecological environment.
    It adversely affects soil productivity, crop yields, and the overall balance of
    ecosystems (Mohamed et al., 2023). The Hetao Irrigation District (HID) in Inner
    Mongolia is a prime example, characterized by its arid and semiarid conditions,
    where approximately 70 % of cultivated land is affected by soil salinization (Sun
    et al., 2022). Therefore, there is an urgent need to accurately and rapidly obtain
    information on soil salinization to support local agricultural production. Traditional
    methods of monitoring soil salinity rely on manual sampling, laboratory analysis,
    and measurement, which are time-consuming and laborious. Ground monitoring stations
    can save labor, but they come with limitations, including limited monitoring ranges
    and high costs. In recent years, satellite remote sensing monitoring has emerged
    as a prominent method for qualitative or quantitative monitoring of soil salinization
    due to its unique advantages, including the ability to cover large areas, offer
    various data product types, and provide easy access, low cost, and convenient
    mapping (Cao et al., 2022). Soil salinity varies with irrigation, precipitation,
    evaporation, fertilization, and other production activities or meteorological
    changes, resulting in the soil''s horizontal and vertical movement of salinity
    (Tibhirine et al., 2023). Therefore, obtaining soil salinity distribution under
    different time series is crucial to understanding the dynamic patterns of soil
    salt content (SSC). Currently, many studies have used satellite remote sensing
    to acquire multi-temporal data on surface soil salinization to estimate SSC both
    in bare soil (Abuzaid et al., 2023) and in periods of vegetation cover (Guo et
    al., 2019). Recent research has used hyperspectral and radar data from satellites
    for monitoring soil salinization. Wang et al., (2020b) conducted a qualitative
    analysis of soil salinization level using HJ-1A hyperspectral images and the fractional
    derivatives method, with an R2 of 0.66. Periasamy and Ravi (2020) assessed the
    feasibility of estimating soil electric conductivity (EC) for bare and vegetated
    soil using Sentinel-1 SAR data, yielding a best R2 of 0.85 in sandy bare soil,
    and the R2 greater than 0.7 in soil covered by short crops with a mean height
    of 0.5 m. However, compared to hyperspectral data, multispectral images have a
    smaller data volume, are easier to process, and are more widely used in soil salinity
    monitoring (Marshall and Thenkabail, 2015, Sahbeni et al., 2023). Researchers
    found that multispectral bands, especially those in the visible and near-infrared
    regions, are highly sensitive to SSC (Dehaan and Taylor, 2002, Farifteh et al.,
    2008). Based on the above evidence, many multispectral salinity indices (SIs)
    have been developed, which combine two or more sensitive spectral bands to enhance
    the response sensitivity of band information to soil salinity. Khan et al. (2005)
    constructed SIs, such as normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) and SI-1
    for monitoring arid land. In addition, during the vegetation cover period, certain
    vegetation indices (VIs) based on multispectral bands have been found to be more
    effective to SSC than SIs. Zhang et al., (2021a) noted that as fractional vegetation
    cover increases, NDVI and other VIs have higher correlation weights with SSC than
    SIs. Therefore, multispectral satellite data and derived spectral indices (VIs
    and SIs) are reliable data for soil salinity assessment. When using optical satellites
    for large-scale monitoring, the SSC and field environment show spatial heterogeneity
    (Wang et al., 2023), and spectral reflectance captured by these satellites typically
    results from the combined influence of soil properties, crop characteristics,
    and meteorological factor. Moreover, the spectral data contains a large amount
    of information, which can potentially affect the accuracy of SSC monitoring. Therefore,
    spectral information and environmental factors should be accounted for when estimating
    SSC using optical satellite data. Some researchers (Salcedo et al., 2022) have
    noticed that environmental factors can affect the accuracy of SSC inversion and
    attempted to eliminate this impact (Taghizadeh-Mehrjardi et al., 2014). Zhang
    et al., (2021a) observed that the correlation between SSC and spectral indices
    varies under different fractional vegetation cover, and they found that the segmentation
    of different vegetation coverage can improve the estimation accuracy of SSC. Scudiero
    et al. (2015) evaluated the impacts of soil type, field management practices,
    and meteorological factors on SSC estimation accuracy using simple linear models.
    They found that field management practices and meteorological factors significantly
    affect the SSC estimation accuracy. Li et al. (2022b) found that the correlation
    between SSC and spectral covariates varied with seasons and predicted SSC of different
    season soils using remote sensing. Our previous study found that different crop
    growth periods have a notable impact on the model when estimating SSC at a small
    scale during the vegetation cover period (Cui et al., 2023). When conducting large-scale
    SSC monitoring, crop types are diverse and complex within the region and significant
    variations are found in the spectral characteristics across different periods.
    There have been relatively few studies on the influence of different vegetation
    growth stages and crop types on large-scale SSC estimation using remote sensing.
    Both simple linear models and machine learning algorithms were used to establish
    SSC estimation models. Machine learning regression models have consistently demonstrated
    their capability to explore nonlinear relationships, showing their superiority
    in SSC estimation than linera models (Mohamed et al., 2023). Xu et al. (2023)
    obtained a high SSC estimation accuracy (R2 = 0.89) using an improved random forest
    algorithm. Zhou et al. (2021) successfully estimated SSC using an improved SVM
    algorithm, and the R2 of the improved SVM model was 0.56. In the previous research
    on the SSC estimation during the vegetation cover period, Cui et al., (2022) found
    that artificial neural networks (ANNs) show superior performance. This study aims
    to (1) evaluate the influence of time series and crop types on the SSC estimation
    during the vegetation cover period and whether dividing different time series
    and crop types can enhance estimation accuracy; (2) investigate relationships
    between SSC and spectral indices, improve the sensitivity of spectral indices
    to SSC, and identify the most effective independent variables for modeling; (3)
    assess the performance of both linear and machine learning algorithms for SSC
    estimation and establish the optimal estimation model; and (4) generate SSC prediction
    distribution maps at different time, providing valuable insights into soil salinity
    dynamics. 2. Materials and methods 2.1. Study site HID (40°19′–41°18′N, 106°20′–109°19′E)
    is located on the desert plateau of Inner Mongolia, China (Fig. 1). This area
    receives about 5 billion cubic meters of water from the Yellow River annually,
    making it the largest irrigated area in the Yellow River basin. HID is a temperate
    continental monsoon climate with little rainfall and large evaporation, and agricultural
    irrigation water depends on the Yellow River (Lu et al., 2019). The most used
    method in the local area is flood irrigation and excessive diversion irrigation
    all year round, which causes high groundwater levels and salt accumulation in
    the soil. About 70 % of cultivated land was salinized to varying degrees (Xiong
    et al., 2021). Sunflower, maize, and squash are the main crops grown in HID, with
    relatively larger areas of sunflower and maize (Li et al., 2022a). Because of
    the climatic conditions, crops are planted only once a year in HID, and there
    is no rotation. Download : Download high-res image (1MB) Download : Download full-size

    imagery This study used Sentinel-2 images obtained from the USGS Earth probe data
    portal (https://earthexplorer.usgs.gov/). One of the best quality images in each
    ground sampling period were selected for study, and image data were collected
    on June 30, July 30, August 19, and September 8, 2021, and June 30, July 25, August
    9, and September 3, 2022, in which June to August is summer and early September
    is early autumn. The determination of sampling time was related to the key growth
    period of the main crops in HID. Maize was in jointing stage, tasseling stage,
    milking stage and maturity stage in the above four sampling periods, while sunflower
    was in seedling stage, budding stage, flowering stage and maturity stage respectively.
    The image spectral bands and central wavelengths are as follows: Band2 (blue)
    with a central wavelength of 490 nm, Band3 (green) with 560 nm, Band4 (red) with
    665 nm, Band5 (red-edge) with 705 nm, and Band8 (near-infrared) with 842 nm. Sen2Cor
    software (v2.10.01) was used to perform atmospheric correction on L1C data which
    then was converted into an L2A-level surface reflectance image. SNAP (8.0) software
    was used to generate a cloud removal file for L2A-level data and resampled all
    band images to a resolution of 10 m. Finally, ENVI 5.3 was used for single band
    image stitching, cloud removal, radiometric calibration, and clipping. The study
    focuses on the cultivated land within HID, while urban residential areas, water
    bodies, bare discarded cultivated land, and other landscapes are not within the
    scope of the study. The cultivated land area in HID was extracted with a shapefile
    of Gong et al. (2019). 2.2.2. Ground truth data collection and measurement This
    study conducted four cycles of ground sampling from 2021 and 2022. The sampling
    periods were as follows: June 25 to July 7, July 19 to July 30, August 12 to August
    20, and September 2 to September 9, 2021; and June 29 to July 2, July 23 to July
    27, August 9 to August 12, and August 30 to September 5, 2022. Across these two
    years, 84 sampling areas were established in the Hetao Irrigation District (HID),
    with 35 in 2021 and 49 in 2022. Notably, there were 9 overlapping sampling areas
    (Fig. 1). Within HID, 3 to 5 sampling points were designated in each sampling
    area, the number of sampling points and the descriptive statistics of the SSC
    data were shown in Table 1. The selection of sampling points considered principles
    such as uniform distribution, soil salinity gradient, and vegetation cover type.
    Three soil samples were taken diagonally from each sampling point within the 3
    × 3 m quadrate, and the average of the three soil samples was taken as the final
    result. Soil samples were collected at a depth of 0–20 cm at each sampling site,
    and geographic location information of sampling sites was recorded with RTK differential
    GNSS equipment (Zhang et al., 2021b). After 10–15 days of air-drying, the collected
    samples were ground into powder using a 1-mm aperture sieve, then configured into
    solution (EC1:5) according to distilled water to soil mass ratio of 5:1. The prepared
    solution (EC1:5, μs/cm) was stirred with an electrical conductivity meter for
    8 min and then left to precipitate for 8–10 h. An electrical conductivity meter
    (DDS-307A, Shanghai Yidian Scientific Instruments Co., Ltd. Shanghai, China) was
    used to measure the electric conductivity (EC) of the filtrate. Equation (1) was
    used to calculate the SSC (Wei et al., 2020): (1) SSC = (0. 2882EC1:5 + 0. 0183)

    Methods of crop type classification In this study, crop type was one of the key
    factors influencing SSC estimation. Consequently, obtaining the crop type distribution
    information within HID for the respective periods is necessary. The model established
    by Li et al. (2022a) based on U-Net algorithm was used for crop type recognition.
    The overall recognition accuracy for sunflower and maize using multiple phase
    images captured in June and July ranged between 83.0 % and 83.8 %, and 90.6 %
    to 95.8 %, respectively (Li et al., 2022a). Sentinel-2 images from June 30, 2021,
    and 2022 were used to extract sunflower and maize pixels in this study. The mapping
    result is shown in Fig. 3. The number of sunflower and maize pixels accounted
    for 61 % and 39 %, respectively in 2021. These percentages shifted to 64 % for
    sunflower and 36 % for maize in 2022. Download : Download high-res image (1MB)

    indices calculation Spectral indices are usually computed using two to four of
    the five bands. Some studies have shown that some VIs are more sensitive to SSC
    than SIs during the vegetation cover period (Zhang et al., 2021a). Therefore,
    in addition to the thirteen commonly used SIs, we also incorporated seventeen
    VIs for correlation analysis. The spectral indices and their corresponding calculation
    formulas are presented in Table 2. Table 2. Salinity indices (SIs) and Vegetation

    methods Pearson''s linear correlation coefficient r was used to characterize the
    pairwise correlations among all independent variables in this study and presented
    with a heatmap. In addition, the recursive feature elimination (RFE) (Granitto
    et al., 2006) was used to determine the optimal number of input variables for
    modeling. The feature selection algorithm of RFE is the random forest, which recursively
    eliminates variables with low contributions until all variables are removed. The
    model with the highest R2 corresponds to the optimal number of variables. 2.3.4.
    Model training, validation and evaluation A linear regression method was used
    as a based model to evaluate the impact of different time series and crop cover
    types on SSC regression accuracy. In addition, three machine learning algorithms,
    including random forest (RF), support vector regression (SVR), and Artificial
    Neural Networks (ANN) were used to establish SSC estimation models. The input
    parameters of models were satellite-derived VIs and SIs selected based on PCCs
    and RFE. Cross-validation (k-fold) method (Stone, 1974) is a resampling method
    used for model training and validation. The original dataset (n = 1304) was randomly
    divided into a cross-validation dataset and a testing dataset with a ratio of
    3:1. The 4 fold cross-validation was used. The testing dataset was used as a separate
    dataset to test model accuracy. The dataset partitions and descriptive statistics
    were shown in Table 3. Table 3. Number of sampling points in each time series

    CVd, cross-validate datasets; Testing, testing datasets. The 4-fold, RF, SVR and
    ANN were completed using “caret”, “randomForest,” “e1071,” and “nnet” packages
    in R language (R-3.5.3). For RF, the tree number uses the default value (5 0 0),
    and the number of variables per node was optimized with values ranging from 2
    to 5 at 1 interval. For SVR, the radial basis kernel function was selected as
    the kernel function, and the kernel parameter (gamma) and penalty parameter were
    optimized with values ranging from 0.1 to 1. For ANN, the single hidden-layer
    feedforward backpropagation neural network structure was adopted, and the initial
    number of nodes were optimized with values ranging from 1 to 5 at 2 intervals.
    The parameters not mentioned remain default values. Root mean square error (RMSE)
    and determination coefficient (R2) were used to evaluate the accuracy of the models.
    The mean error (ME) was used to evaluate the model''s tendency to either overestimate
    or underestimate the data. A positive ME value represents the overestimation,
    while a negative ME value indicates the underestimation. 2.3.5. Mapping method
    The optimal estimation model was used to generate maps of SSC in HID across various
    time. Spectral index images were calculated using the Band Math tool in ENVI 5.3
    (Harris Corporation, Jersey City, NJ, USA). The “rgdal,” “raster,” “maptools,”
    and “nnet” packages in R were used to create multiple time series SSC prediction
    distribution maps. In the mapping of SSC under different crop types, ArcGIS (10.2)
    software was applied to mask, reorganize, and reclassify satellite images based
    on crop classification results. 3. Results 3.1. Statistical analysis of soil samples,
    spectral indices, and datasets The collected soil samples were categorized into
    four salinity levels using the classification of Wang et al., (2020a). These levels
    were defined as follows: no-salinization (SSC ＜ 0.2 %), mild-salinization (0.2
    % ≤ SSC ＜ 0.4 %), moderate-salinization (0.4 % ≤ SSC ＜ 0.6 %), and severe-salinization
    (0.6 % ≤ SSC ＜ 1.0 %). In this study, SSC and spectral indices (e.g., NDSI) were
    grouped based on different crop types and various time series, and the statistical
    characteristics of the data were analyzed (Fig. 4). As shown in Fig. 4, the SSC
    data for maize primarily fell within the mild and moderate salinization categories
    across all four time series. In contrast, the SSC data for sunflower were predominantly
    concentrated in the moderate and severe salinization ranges, which were notably
    higher than those for maize. Furthermore, significant differences in NDSI values
    were observed between sunflower and maize under the same time series, especially
    during June, when the absolute values differed by more than 0.4. This can be attributed
    to differences in vegetation coverage. The sowing time of local maize is from
    late April to early May, while the sunflower is in mid to late May. The sunflower
    was planted later than maize in the local area and was in the seeding stage in
    June. Therefore, the spectral reflectance of soil pixels was affected, resulting
    in lower absolute NDSI values. It can be seen that the spectral reflectance and
    SSC between sunflower and maize fields differed greatly, and the spectral index
    value fluctuated significantly across different time series. Therefore, it becomes
    evident that different crop types and time series influence SSC estimation. Download

    spectral indices and SSC The selection of variables is crucial for SSC estimation.
    Linear correlation coefficients were used to analyze correlations between thirty
    spectral indices derived from satellite images and SSC, and the preliminary result
    matrix was presented as a heat map. As shown in Fig. 5, both SIs and VIs were
    significantly correlated with SSC (r ≥ 0.3). In general, VIs exhibit a stronger
    correlation with SSC than SIs, in alignment with the observations made by Zhang
    et al., (2021a). The study indicated that as vegetation coverage increased, the
    correlation between VIs and SSC became gradually higher than that of SIs. Download

    r between spectral indices and SSC. To determine the optimal number of characteristic
    variables, 31 spectral index variables were analyzed using the RFE method, where
    variables with the least contribution to the model were eliminated one by one
    until the number of variables was 1. R2 and RMSE values of the 31 established
    random forest models were shown in Fig. 6. As shown in Fig. 6, when the number
    of variables is 13, the model accuracy is the highest (R2 = 0.425, RMSE = 0.136
    %), but we also observe that when the number of variables is 5, the model accuracy
    has reached a relatively high level (R2 = 0.418, RMSE = 0.137 %). With the increase
    of the number of variables, the improvement of model accuracy was slight, but
    the risk of model overfitting was greatly increased. Therefore, the optimal number
    of variables for modeling was set to 5. Download : Download high-res image (108KB)

    of variables based on RFE method. Considering the results of Section 3.1, 20 spectral
    indices (with r ≥ 0.3) were used to investigate whether the classification of
    crop types and different time series would improve the correlations between SSC
    and spectral indices. Fig. 7 shows the results. When comparing the entire dataset
    to the individual maize and sunflower datasets, only a slight decrease in the
    correlation between each spectral index and SSC. However, when classifying datasets
    based on crop type and further analyzing them within different time series, the
    correlation between each spectral index and SSC had been greatly improved. Using
    NDSI as an example, the r without classification of crop type and time series
    was 0.409, while after considering the crop types, we found rmaize = 0.380 and
    rsunflower = 0.323. For different time series within each crop type, rmaize ranged
    from 0.509 to 0.606 and rsunflower ranged from 0.501 to 0.606. These results may
    be attributed to the fact that SSC values and corresponding spectral index values
    for the two crops do not follow normal or uniform distributions when analyzed
    without considering crop types. As indicated by the statistics in Fig. 4, sunflowers
    generally exhibit higher SSC levels compared to maize, and the NDSI values for
    sunflower were also significantly higher than those for maize. Therefore, when
    crop types were not considered, this data distribution led to a significant positive
    correlation between NDSI and SSC, where a high NDSI corresponded to high SSC,
    and a low NDSI corresponded to low SSC). However, with crop type divisions, the
    differences in data distribution caused by the distinct characteristics of these
    crops were removed, and the influence of factors such as growth characteristics
    of crops on the correlation were amplified, resulting in a decrease in the correlation
    between NDSI and SSC compared to the dataset that did not consider crop classification.
    A previous study (Cui et al., 2022) indicated substantial variations in crop canopy
    phenotypic characteristics at different time series, resulting in corresponding
    changes in spectral index. However, the fluctuation in SSC over the entire crop
    growth period is considerably smaller than those observed in spectral indices.
    Therefore, the r increased significantly after dividing the data by different
    time series. According to the statistics in Fig. 7a, the absolute correlation
    between SSC and SI under sunflower cover in June was in the range of 0.36–0.50,
    while those in August and September were 0.36–0.61 and 0.42–0.56 respectively,
    and the correlation between SI and SSC in June was mostly lower than that in August
    and September. Download : Download high-res image (402KB) Download : Download

    3.3. Evaluation of the effects of crop type and time series on SSC estimation
    using a linear model Based on the results of Section 3.2, NDSI has a relatively
    high correlation with all datasets. Therefore, the linear relationship between
    NDSI and SSC is used as a reference to evaluate the influence of different crop
    types and different time series on the estimation results of SSC. Equation (3)
    is the linear formula, and the R2 of this model is 0.234. (3) SSCj = 0.509 + 0.425
    × NDSIj where SSCj is the predicted value at each location j and NDSIj is the
    measured value at each location j. Scudiero et al. (2015) reported that using
    different regression coefficients for explanatory variables according to field
    management type (such as cropped and fallow soils) can improve the explained variance
    of a regression equation. Introducing crop types (sunflower and maize) to establish
    a regression model (Eq. (4)), the resulting R2 values were 0.163 for sunflower
    and 0.229 for maize. and the model performance was suboptimal than that of Eq.
    (3). It can then be concluded that when dealing a dataset containing multiple
    time series, the inclusion of crop type as a covariate alone does not improve
    the accuracy of the SSC regression model. (4) SSCj = α + βcrop × NDSIj where SSCj
    and NDSIj are the same as Eq. (3), the α are 0.501 and 0.469 for sunflower and
    maize, and the βcrop are 0.376 and 0.401 for sunflower and maize, respectively.
    As described in Section 2.2, in addition to the great variations in the value
    interval of NDSI among different crops, the characteristics of crops during other
    time series also lead to the great differences in NDSI value interval. Therefore,
    the study developed regression equations (Eqs. (5), (6)) based on crop types differnticating
    by time series (June–September). (5) SSCs,j = λs,time + δs,time × NDSIs,j (6)
    SSCm,j = φm,time + μm,time × NDSIm,j where SSC is the predicted soil salt content,
    NDSI is the measured value, j is the Sentinel-2 pixel location, s is the sunflower
    pixel, m is the maize pixel, λ and φ are the intercepts, δ and μ are the slopes,
    and time is the time series (June, July, August, and September). Table 4 presents
    the intercepts, slopes, and R2 of Eqs. (5), (6). The average R2 of the models
    were significantly higher than Eq. (3) (−0.02–0.284) using different regression
    coefficients for NDSI according to different crop types and time series. For sunflower
    data in July, R2 was lower than Eq. (3), probably because the correlation between
    NDSI and SSC was lower than other spectral indices during the period. It can be
    concluded that the classification of crop type and time series can effectively
    improve the accuracy of SSC estimation. Table 4. Coefficients of determination

    analysis results of section 3.2, the first five spectral indices of each dataset
    with a high r values were selected as independent variables (Table 5). Three machine
    learning algorithms (RFR, ANN, and SVR) were used to establish SSC estimation
    models for different crop types and time series. To assess the impact of crop
    type classification on the model, an initial machine learning model was established,
    which solely considered time series divisions without incorporating crop type
    distinctions. The model performance metrics, R2 and RMSE, are summarized in Table
    6. Comparing these machine learning models to the linear model with a single independent
    variable, it becomes obvious that the machine learning algorithms delivered higher
    accuracy in SSC estimation. According to the results in Table 6, the accuracy
    of sunflower and maize models significantly improved when crop types were taken
    into account, resulting in an increase in R2 from 0.02 to 0.25 compared to undivided
    crop type datasets. Among the three machine learning algorithms, the validation
    and test accuracy of the ANN algorithm were the best in most datasets, with the
    Random Forest (RF) model achieving the highest accuracy in the sunflower dataset
    for July and the maize dataset for September. In general, the SSC estimation model
    based on ANN (R2 = 0.52–0.73, RMSE = 0.08–0.13 %) was considered the most effective
    and possesses the best generalization capability under these conditions. Table

    %) to evaluate the prediction error of the model. Fig. 8 shows the scatterplots
    of the SSC estimation and ground truth values for the ANN models established for
    each crop type and time series. These plots and ME results reveal slight overestimations
    for some no-salinization data (ME = 0 ∼ 0.6 %), and slight underestimations for
    severe salinization data (ME = 0 ∼ -0.14 %). In general, taking into account the
    model’s overall accuracy, it can be concluded that the ANN model exhibits strong
    performance in SSC estimation modeling. Download : Download high-res image (1MB)

    3.5. Multiple time series mapping of SSC As demonstrated in Section 3.4, ANN models
    had the best performance. Therefore, the predicted SSC distribution maps for HID
    across different time series were generated using the ANN models. Fig. 9 shows
    the distribution maps for HID during each time series in 2021 and 2022. Different
    colors on the map represent varying degrees of soil salinization (as shown in
    the legends), while white pixels represent other crop types apart from sunflower
    and maize fields, roads, deserts, urban residential areas, and other areas unrelated
    to the research object. The pixel statistics of the SSC prediction distribution
    maps mentioned above were shown in Fig. 10. A noticeable pattern appears by analyzing
    the map and counting the pixel for each salinization level. The overall trend
    in soil salinization levels across the four time series within the same year followed
    a pattern from low to high and then back to low. In June, the pixels of no-salinization
    and mild-salinization had the widest distribution, while the pixels of moderate
    and severe salinization were fewer but increased significantly in July and August.
    Soil salinization decreased in September, but still higher than June. Compared
    to 2021, the soil salinization level in the corresponding periods in 2022 exhibited
    a slight decrease, with a relatively reduction in severe-salinization pixels and
    an increase in none and mild salinization. However, August 2022 was an exception,
    as some pixels during this month were significantly overpredicted. SSC generally
    shows dynamic changes across different time series throughout the monitoring period.
    The mapping results of this study can effectively illustrate the dynamic distribution
    of SSC within different crop types and time series. Download : Download high-res

    of crop type and time series division The tolerance of different crops to salinity
    and their response to soil salt stress can vary significantly, especially during
    the vegetation cover period (Tong et al., 2015). To understand this, we analyzed
    the spectral indices and SSC values of the two major crops, sunflower and maize,
    cultivated in HID. We observed that sunflower fields consistently had higher SSC
    values compared to maize fields. This discrepancy can be attributed to the better
    saline-alkali tolerance levels of sunflower than maize. Li et al. (2020) and Dain
    (2023) showed that sunflower had excellent salt tolerance, while Wen et al. (2023)
    showed that maize had good drought resistance but had poorer salt-alkali tolerance.
    Therefore, local farmers often plant sunflowers in areas with high salinity. The
    spectral indices (e.g., NDSI) of the two crops in the same period were significantly
    different, which was related to the great difference in canopy spectra. Take August
    as an example, maize was in the milk-ripe stage with ears visible in the canopy,
    while sunflower was in the blooming stage, characterized by a canopy with prominent
    yellow inflorescence. Therefore, combining data from two crops for analysis and
    modeling would conceal the differences in canopy phenotypic characteristics of
    different crops and their response to SSC. In addition, the SSC and NDSI values
    of the same crop show dynamic changes across the four time series. However, NDSI
    exhibited a considerably higher variation amplitude than SSC. This resulted in
    SSC values showing only slight variations between different periods, while the
    corresponding spectral index values for each period displayed significant fluctuations.
    Such variations could be attributed to the different physiological characteristics
    of the same crop at different growth stages. Jia and Zhang (2014) also had a comparable
    conclusion, noting that sunflowers exhibit different spectral reflectances at
    different growth stages. The spectral reflectance increases with the progress
    of the growth stage, and a reflection peak (809 nm) is formed at the flowering
    stage. As a result, using mixed data from multiple time series for modeling would
    cover up the differences throughout a crop’s entire growth cycle, ultimately reducing
    modeling accuracy. The insights outlined above were further validated during the
    selection of variables for modeling. The classification of crop types and different
    time series significantly improved correlations between each spectral index and
    SSC, with a maximum increase r of 0.31 (EVI in July). Because the classification
    reduces the spectral characteristic confusion arising from differences in canopy
    structure among various crop types and growth stages, the influence of these two
    environmental factors on the correlation strength between spectral indices and
    SSC was eliminated. Meanwhile, the correlation between VIs and SIs changed significantly
    in different time periods. For example, in July, the r value between EVI and SSC
    in sunflower fields was 0.712, ranking as the highest among all spectral indices,
    while in June and August, the r for the same variables were 0.494 and 0.488, respectively,
    ranking the 8th and 16th. This is similar to the results of Zhang (2021a), who
    found that the correlation between spectral indices and SSC from April to August
    changed with the increase in vegetation coverage. It can be concluded that the
    classification of crop types and time series can identify variable combinations
    that are more responsive to SSC, which is beneficial for improving the accuracy
    of modeling and mapping processes. 4.2. Prediction models Considering model accuracy,
    machine learning regression algorithms generally outperform linear regression
    methods. Nonlinear or indirect relationships often exist between the explanatory
    variable and the dependent variable, which machine learning algorithms are proficient
    at uncovering, resulting in improved modeling accuracy Bouasria et al. (2022).
    As evident from the results, the SSC estimation model for the vegetation cover
    period established based on ANN showed the best performance in terms of model
    accuracy. However, it was also found that the prediction accuracy of the model
    for no-salinization and severe-salinization data was relatively low. According
    to the data distribution, the segmentation value between no-salinization and mild-salinization
    data was set at 0.2 %, with the majority of data falling within the 0.1 %–0.3
    % range. The data values within 0.1 %–0.2 % and 0.2 %–0.3 % differ slightly in
    spectral reflectance, which may lead to 0.1 %–0.2 % of the data being overestimated.
    For the severe-salinization data, the performance of the model decreased, likely
    due to its limited sample size. To improve the estimation accuracy of these two
    segments of data, further studies are necessary to analyze the specific characteristics
    of these salinization data and expanding the dataset of severe salinization. 4.3.
    Soil salinity maps The SSC was predicted for pixels classified as maize and sunflower.
    Fig. 11 shows the spatial distribution of SSC for August 2021. Examining the spatial
    division of predicted results between sunflower and maize pixels, the levels of
    soil salinization in sunflower pixels are generally higher than those in maize
    pixels, which is consistent with our field survey and data analysis in Section
    3.1. In the HID region, a common irrigation practice is to implement large-scale
    “spring irrigation” throughout the entire irrigated area before crop planting,
    typically in late May each year (Cui et al., 2022). Spring irrigation mainly aims
    to make surface salt migrate to deeper soil layers with water through excessive
    irrigation to create a suitable soil environment for crop emergence. This corresponds
    well with the predicted results presented in Fig. 9. When comparing different
    months, the soil salinization level of HID was relatively low in June, and soil
    salt reaccumulated on the soil surface due to strong evaporation, resulting in
    elevated soil salinization in July and August. Download : Download high-res image

    When conducting large-scale soil salinization monitoring, the impact of environmental
    variations across expansive areas on monitoring results cannot be ignored (Yang
    et al., 2015). Previous studies have shown that environmental factors, such as
    fractional vegetation cover (Zhang et al., 2021a), meteorological conditions,
    soil texture, and field management practices (Scudiero et al., 2015), were closely
    related to the accuracy of remote sensing monitoring for SSC. This study discussed
    the effects of crop types and varying monitoring time series on estimating the
    regional SSC and obtained positive results. However, this study mainly focused
    on maize and sunflower crops, which may limit the findings'' applicability to
    regions with a wider variety of crop types. Further research efforts should explore
    the sensitivity response of additional crops to SSC and assess the generalizability
    of the model across diverse geographic regions. The previous studies using UAV
    for high-resolution SSC monitoring also found that a number of crop growth parameters
    can improve SSC estimation (Cui et al., 2022). In addition, environmental factors,
    such as soil type, nutrient levels, and soil water content, may also influence
    the responsiveness of crops to SSC, thus impacting estimation accuracy (Taghizadeh-Mehrjardi
    et al., 2014). Therefore, it is necessary to further study the impact of these
    environmental factors on monitoring accuracy in future research on SSC estimation
    during different vegetation cover periods and explore the applicability of these
    factors or features across various monitoring resolutions. An important consideration
    is the necessity to map environmental features, in addition to spectral features,
    within the same range and resolution as SSC when generating prediction distribution
    maps. This not only increases the difficulty of data acquisition, but also introduces
    the potential for cumulative accuracy errors in the distribution map of each factor,
    ultimately affecting the accuracy of SSC mapping. Therefore, how to obtain high-precision
    spatial distribution data for other environmental factors in a quick and efficient
    manner should be considered in future research. When applying these models for
    real-world monitoring, it is necessary to preliminarily assess the crop type and
    time series in the monitored area. Subsequently, SSC predictions must be made
    based on each specific scenario, and then synthesize the final results into a
    prediction map. This process adds difficulty to the practical application of the
    model, and future work needs to resolve this issue. 5. Conclusions This study
    developed SSC estimation models for various time series using Sentinel-2 data
    and produced spatial prediction distribution maps of SSC in HID for different
    times. The results demonstrated that classifying crop types and considering different
    time series significantly enhanced the correlation between SSC and spectral indices,
    thereby positively impacting SSC estimation. Among spectral indices, VIs exhibited
    higher correlations with SSC and made more substantial contributions to the estimation
    models compared to SIs. Within SIs, only NDSI had a high correlation with SSC
    datasets, while within VIs, NDVI, NAVI, TCARI, and EVI showed correlations with
    SSC datasets. Further research is warranted to explore additional environmental
    factors and their spatial distribution information. Funding This study was supported

  key_findings: '1. Classifying crop types and time series significantly enhanced
    the correlation between SSC and spectral indices, thereby improving SSC estimation
    accuracy.

    2. Vegetation indices (VIs) showed higher correlations with SSC than soil salinity
    indices (SIs). NDSI had a high correlation with SSC datasets, while NDVI, NAVI,
    TCARI, and EVI showed correlations with SSC datasets.

    3. The artificial neural networks (ANN) algorithm outperformed the other two machine
    learning algorithms in terms of accuracy and stability.'
  limitations: The study did not consider the influence of environmental factors,
    such as soil texture, nutrient levels, and soil water content, on SSC estimation.
    Also, the applicability of the models to regions with a wider variety of crop
    types is not established.
  main_objective: The primary goal of this study was to develop and evaluate models
    for estimating soil salinity levels (SSC) using Sentinel-2 satellite imagery and
    machine learning algorithms. The specific objectives were to assess the impact
    of crop types and time series on SSC estimation, explore the relationships between
    spectral indices and SSC, identify effective independent variables for modeling,
    and optimize model performance.

  explanation: 'In the given context, strategies for handling data heterogeneity,
    uncertainty, and quality issues in real-time insight generation from crop water
    stress monitoring have been defined as follows:


    1. Preprocessing: Removing outliers and normalizing data to improve data quality
    and make it suitable for model training.

    2. Outlier detection: Identifying and removing extreme or anomalous data points
    that can negatively affect model performance.'

    \ rates (100, 75, 50, and 25% of crop\nevapotranspiration [ETc]). A total of 3200\
    \ images under different treatments were captured at critical\ngrowth stages,\
    \ that is, 20, 35, 70, 95, and 108 days after sowing using a custom-developed\
    \ thermal-\nRGB imaging system. Crop and soil response measurements of canopy\
    \ temperature (Tc), relative\nwater content (RWC), soil moisture content (SMC),\
    \ and relative humidity (RH) were signiﬁcantly\naffected by the irrigation treatments\
    \ showing the lowest Tc (22.5 ± 2 ◦C), and highest RWC (90%)\nand SMC (25.7 ±\
    \ 2.2%) for 100% ETc, and highest Tc (28 ± 3 ◦C), and lowest RWC (74%) and SMC\n\
    (20.5 ± 3.1%) for 25% ETc. The RGB and thermal imagery were then used as inputs\
    \ to feature-\nextraction-based deep learning models (AlexNet, GoogLeNet, Inception\
    \ V3, MobileNet V2, ResNet50)\nwhile, RWC, SMC, Tc, and RH were the inputs to\
    \ function-approximation models (Artiﬁcial Neural\nNetwork (ANN), Kernel Nearest\
    \ Neighbor (KNN), Logistic Regression (LR), Support Vector Machine\n(SVM) and\
    \ Long Short-Term Memory (DL-LSTM)) to classify stressed/non-stressed crops. Among\n\
    the feature extraction-based models, ResNet50 outperformed other models showing\
    \ a discriminant\naccuracy of 96.9% with RGB and 98.4% with thermal imagery inputs.\
    \ Overall, classiﬁcation accuracy\nwas higher for thermal imagery compared to\
    \ RGB imagery inputs. The DL-LSTM had the highest\ndiscriminant accuracy of 96.7%\
    \ and less error among the function approximation-based models for\nclassifying\
    \ stress/non-stress. The study suggests that computer vision coupled with thermal-RGB\n\
    imagery can be instrumental in high-throughput mitigation and management of crop\
    \ water stress.\nKeywords: winter wheat; crop water stress; canopy temperature;\

    \ leaf stomata closure, which reduces transpiration and increases\ncanopy temperature\
    \ (Tc) [1]. Timely estimation of those stressors may not only help preci-\nsion\
    \ irrigation management but also minimize yield losses [2]. The penalty gap between\n\
    actual and potential yield will widen further as a result of climate change that\
    \ projects\na decline in rainfall frequency, and rising ambient temperatures [3].\
    \ Water stress is typ-\nically assessed using xylem water potentials [4], canopy\
    \ thermometry [5], and stomatal\nPlants 2022, 11, 3344. https://doi.org/10.3390/plants11233344\n\
    https://www.mdpi.com/journal/plants\nPlants 2022, 11, 3344\n2 of 21\nconductance\
    \ measurements [6]. However, these methods are often invasive and tend\nto have\
    \ limited sampling accuracy due to low throughput or point data acquisitions [7].\n\
    Non-invasive proximal or remote sensing techniques have emerged as high throughput\n\
    alternatives for monitoring crop water stress through color features, reﬂectance,\
    \ and ther-\nmal emissivity of the vegetable, fruit, and specialty crops [8–10].\
    \ However, monitoring\ncrop water content using visible-range RGB imaging not\
    \ only requires speciﬁc leaf ori-\nentation relative to the camera but also pre-deﬁned\
    \ illumination conditions. This limits\nthe applicability of RGB imaging to determine\
    \ water content in ﬁeld conditions. Using\nscanner-type imaging devices could\
    \ be a cost and time-effective alternative [11]. Unlike\nthermometry, Tc from\
    \ thermal infrared imagery reﬂects upon the entire canopy emissivity\nproﬁle,\
    \ which is directly proportional to the canopy water content [9]. Thermal imagery\n\
    (8000–14,000 nm) also outperforms color RGB imagery (400–700 nm), and reﬂectance\
    \ char-\nacteristics in terms of robustness to characterize crop water stress\
    \ [8,9]. Nonetheless, the\nadaptability of thermal imaging in agricultural production\
    \ management is still at a nascent\nstage and is consistently evolving to maintain\
    \ imaging quality against drastic variations\nin relative humidity and wind speeds.\
    \ Thermal imaging cameras are also relatively more\nexpensive than simple-to-operate\
    \ RGB cameras. It is for these reasons; thermal imaging\nis still limitedly adopted\
    \ as a golden standard for crop stress mapping. Above all, long-\nwave infrared\
    \ wavelengths (thermal imaging) have a higher penetrating capability over\nvisible-range\
    \ wavelengths, making them more reliable and sensitive to crop water content\n\
    variations. Thermal imaging is therefore a better alternative for precision irrigation\
    \ man-\nagement unlike RGB imaging or using standard crop coefﬁcients coupled\
    \ with reference\nevapotranspiration [8,9].\nRGB imagery has been used to assess\
    \ crop water stress using different deep learning\n(DL) and machine learning (ML)\
    \ techniques [10,12,13]. ML techniques derive unique\nfeatures from input and\
    \ output datasets, which could be used for discrimination between\ndifferent object\
    \ types or classes. ML techniques such as Naïve Bayes, artiﬁcial neural\nnetworks\
    \ (ANNs), support vector machine (SVM), and random forests (RFs) have been\nwidely\
    \ used with RGB images for weed detection, biotic and abiotic stress identiﬁcation\n\
    and/or classiﬁcation, yield predictions, and other crop phenotyping applications\
    \ [14,15].\nThermal imagery has also been used with RFs and decision trees for\
    \ crop water status\nmonitoring in the vineyard and automated irrigation scheduling\
    \ [16]. However, there are\nseveral limitations associated with ML techniques.\
    \ The output quality is highly dependent\non input data quality, the presence\
    \ of noise and outliers, and other unaccounted biases\nthat have been reported\
    \ to signiﬁcantly affect the model performance. Furthermore, ML\ntechniques also\
    \ require skilled operators [17] for deﬁning input features that may also often\n\
    affect the model performances through unintentional subjectivity and bias [10,12].\n\
    DL has emerged as an advanced vision-based learning technique that enables au-\n\
    tomated feature extraction without human dependencies unlike ML [18]. Pertinent\
    \ to\nagricultural applications, crop phenological stages have been detected using\
    \ a deep con-\nvolution neural network (DCNN) trained on RGB imagery [19,20].\
    \ Similarly, different DL\ntechniques (AlexNet, GoogLeNet, and Inception V3) have\
    \ also been used to classify non-\nstressed and water-stressed soybean, maize,\
    \ and okra crops with digital RGB images [10].\nLong Short Term Memory (LSTM)\
    \ is a novel DL approach (DL-LSTM) that has been used\nfor different ﬁeld applications\
    \ like time series forecasting of wheat yield and productiv-\nity [21], irrigation\
    \ requirement [22], predicting agricultural product sale volumes based\non seasonal\
    \ and historical data [23], and identiﬁcation and classiﬁcation of weeds [24].\n\
    Most of the image processing studies have used RGB images (or visible range imagery)\
    \ to\nclassify crop water stress [25,26]. Thermal imagery has been reported to\
    \ be more robust\nfor crop water stress characterization compared to RGB or multispectral\
    \ imagery [27,28].\nThis is majorly due to the fact that the canopy emissivity\
    \ can be highly sensitive to water\ncontent [8,9,29,30].\nSo far, crop water stress\
    \ characterization has been carried out through traditional\nand destructive methods\
    \ that often have restricted commercial applicability. Moreover,\nPlants 2022,\
    \ 11, 3344\n3 of 21\nthese techniques have been limitedly explored using robust\
    \ computer-vision techniques\n(ML or DL models) for thermal infrared imagery inputs.\
    \ Small unmanned aerial system\n(UAS)-based thermal and multispectral remote sensing\
    \ is also being explored for high\nthroughput crop water stress phenotyping. However,\
    \ the frequency of data acquisition\nis limited to once or a few times a day and\
    \ atmospheric interferences including weather\nconditions may severely impact\
    \ the quality of thermal imaging. Additionally, onboard\ndata processing potential\
    \ for complex and robust algorithms is still limited for small UASs.\nContrarily,\
    \ proximal thermal imaging is subjected to the least atmospheric interference\n\
    and imaging frequency constraints. These systems can continuously collect data\
    \ at critical\ngrowth stages and also offer ﬂexibility for custom modiﬁcation\
    \ to implement onboard edge\nprocessing algorithms for real-time decision support\
    \ and management actuation. On the\ncost side, thermal and RGB imaging sensors\
    \ and the UASs are still far more expensive than\nthe proximal imaging systems,\
    \ which can be custom-assembled using miniature sensing\nmodules. However, such\
    \ miniature sensing modules neither offer sufﬁcient resolution nor\ndesired image\
    \ quality when integrated with UASs.\nObtaining robust data handling and the analytical\
    \ pipeline is the major obstacle to\nderiving real-time decision support for crop\
    \ management but is achievable using custom-\nassembled edge devices. This study\
    \ is a step toward alleviating those obstacles and\nfocuses on the evaluation\
    \ of non-invasive and cost-effective thermal-RGB imaging with\nrobust ML and DL\
    \ models for stress characterization in winter wheat crops. This could\nbe critical\
    \ from a precision irrigation scheduling and management perspective and may\n\
    potentially have high grower adaptability. Speciﬁc objectives for this two-year\
    \ study were\nto (a) non-invasively assess the crop responses to two irrigation\
    \ systems and four deﬁcit\nirrigation treatments, and (b) identify the water-stressed\
    \ and non-stressed crops by feature\nextraction using thermal-RGB imagery and\
    \ function approximation approaches using crop\nphysiological parameters and ambient\
    \ weather inputs.\n2. Materials and Methods\n2.1. Experiment Design\nWinter wheat\
    \ (Triticum aestivum L., cv. HI 1544) was planted (November to April,\n2019–2020,\
    \ and 2020–2021) in the research farm (77.24◦ E, 23.18◦ N) of the Central Institute\n\
    of Agricultural Engineering (CIAE), ICAR Bhopal, India (Figure 1). The meteorological\n\
    data are being recorded at the institute observatory since 1985. According to\
    \ Koppen’s\nclassiﬁcation (1934), Bhopal is a Mediterranean climatic zone with\
    \ an average annual\nrainfall of about 1127 mm. The soil type is heavy clay (Vertisols)\
    \ with clay content over 50%\nand moderate fertility with negligible salinity.\
    \ Soil structure is sub-angular blocky with a\nﬁeld capacity of 29.5–32% (db)\
    \ and wilting point of 18-19.5% (db). The average inﬁltration\nand percolation\
    \ rates of the soil are 10–12 mm day−1 and 6.3–7.0%, respectively. The plots\n\
    were irrigated using ﬂood and sprinkler systems at four treatment rates: 100,\
    \ 75, 50, and\n25% of full crop evapotranspiration (ETc). Micro sprinklers of\
    \ 120 lph discharge capacity\n(Make: Netaﬁm) were installed at 3.5 m spacing.\
    \ The reference crop evapotranspiration was\ncalculated using weather data with\
    \ the FAO56 Penman–Montieth method and standard\nnon-stressed crop coefﬁcient\
    \ [31]. The seasonal ETc of wheat during the ﬁrst and second\nyears of growth\
    \ was 380 mm and 345 mm, respectively. The application efﬁciencies of\n0.65 for\
    \ ﬂood irrigation and 0.90 for sprinkler irrigation were used as determined from\n\
    the experiment trials on the same site using the measurements of water applied\
    \ and the\nwater retained in the crop root zone. A total of six irrigation cycles\
    \ were implemented for\n100% ETc treatment (non-stressed) at sowing, crown root\

    \ Function Approximation-Based Approaches\nFour ML models; ANN, KNN, LR, and SVM\
    \ and a DL-based LSTM (DL-LSTM) were\nselected as the function approximation approaches\
    \ for crop water stress classiﬁcation. The\nML models were selected as those provide\
    \ an opportunity to analyze numerous features\nsimultaneously unlike traditional\
    \ methods. ANN is effective in learning complex nonlinear\nfunctions and segmenting\
    \ data based on the learned weights. The input layer had four\nvariables to extract\
    \ features from 1600 samples while the output layer had one neuron to\ncalculate\
    \ the probability of each class [47]. KNN classiﬁes a data point based on its\
    \ distance\nfrom the maximum number of training data points in the neighborhood.\
    \ Typically, KNN\nuses Euclidean, Minkowski, Manhattan, or Hamming distances out\
    \ of which Minkowski\ndistance has been reported to be more reliable [48] and\
    \ was therefore selected in the model.\nLR classiﬁes data points into discrete\
    \ classes based on probability using a sigmoid or logistic\nfunction [49]. SVM\
    \ shifts data points to a higher dimension using linear, non-linear, and\nradial\
    \ kernels to achieve linear separability [50] and then identiﬁes a hyperplane\
    \ for the\nhighest possible distance between data points of the two classes. DL-LSTM\
    \ uses a chain of\nrepeated modules comprising memory cells with a backpropagation\
    \ algorithm to solve the\nclassiﬁcation problems. This model solves premature\
    \ overﬁtting and vanishing gradient\nissues by using the previously stored information\
    \ in the memory cell. The information\nis then used to generate the features during\
    \ the training process to predict the output\nclass [51]. ML models automatically\
    \ tuned their hyperparameter values by using Bayesian\noptimization. The optimization\
    \ minimizes the model loss based on the hyperparameter\ncombination and yields\
    \ the best possible set of parameters. Further, the models were\ntrained and validated\
    \ on these tuned hyperparameters. All function-approximation models\nwere deployed\
    \ on crop environment (Ta, RH, and SMC) and temperature (Tc, from thermal\nimages)\
    \ inputs for classiﬁcation into stressed and non-stressed through binary outputs\
    \ (0\nor 1, Table 3). The models (operating parameters in Table 4) were developed\
    \ in Python 3.7\nwith Keras and TensorFlow libraries.\nTable 4. Training parameters\

    \ of both feature extraction and function approximation-based models\nwas evaluated\
    \ through accuracy (A), sensitivity (Se), speciﬁcity (Sp), precision (P), and\
    \ F1\nscore parameters (Equations (1)–(5)). Accuracy is the correct prediction\
    \ rate of non-stressed\nand stressed crops, precision is the fraction of true\
    \ positive (TS) or correctly predicted\nstressed crop from an overall prediction\
    \ of the stressed crop (PS), speciﬁcity is the true\nnegative (TN) or correctly\
    \ predicted non-stressed crops from the actual non-stressed crops\n(AN). Sensitivity\
    \ represents a fraction of the correctly predicted stressed crops (TS) from the\n\
    actual stressed crops (AS) and the F1 score is the harmonic mean of precision\
    \ and sensitivity.\nThe F1 score evaluates the accuracy of a binary classiﬁcation\
    \ problem as in this study, which\naims to classify the crops into two classes\
    \ (stressed and non-stressed). Often, the accuracy\nestimate is affected by true\
    \ negatives and therefore F1 score is highly used over accuracy to\nseek a balance\
    \ between the precision and recall (sensitivity) parameters and when there is\n\
    an uneven class distribution (a large number of actual negatives).\nA = TS + TN\n\

    \ was rep-\nresented by type1 (TE1) (false positive) and type2 errors (TE2) (false\
    \ negative). TE1 is the\nnumber of actual stressed crops misclassiﬁed as non-stressed\
    \ (row 1-column 2 of the confu-\nsion matrix) while TE2 is the number of actual\
    \ non-stressed crops misclassiﬁed as stressed\n(row 2-column 1 of the confusion\

    \ and 73.9% (8.3%), respectively. The mean\nSMCs (%) for respective sprinkler\
    \ irrigation were 26.6 (2.3), 26.2 (2.7), 22.5 (3.3), and 21.1%\n(3.0%) while\
    \ those for respective ﬂood irrigation were 24.9 (2.0), 24.4 (2.5), 21.4 (3.0),\
    \ and\n20.4% (3.1%). When analyzed statistically, Tc, RWC, and SMC were signiﬁcantly\
    \ affected\nby the irrigation method (ﬂood and sprinkler), irrigation rate (100,\
    \ 75, 50, and 25% ETc), as\nwell as their interaction (One-way ANOVA, p < 0.001).\
    \ The RWC and SMC decreased with\nthe decrease in irrigation level, while the\
    \ Tc increased. Based on the categories detailed in\nTable 3, the mean Tc for\
    \ the stressed crop was 26.6 ◦C (±2.6), and that for the non-stressed\ncrop was\
    \ 21.2 ◦C (±1.4). The mean RWC for the non-stressed crop was 92.2% (±1.5) and\n\
    for the stressed crop was 78.9% (±9.2) while the mean SMC for the non-stressed\
    \ crop was\n27.1% (1.6) and for the stressed crop was 21.2% (±2.4).\n3.2. Water\
    \ Stress Prediction\n3.2.1. Feature Extraction-Based Approaches\nThe performances\
    \ of AlexNet, GoogLeNet, Inception V3, MobileNet V2, and ResNet50\nmodels for\
    \ RGB and thermal imagery were tested for different combinations of epochs\nand\
    \ batch sizes (Table 5). The model training accuracies increased with the increase\
    \ in\nthe number of epochs from 5 to 10 and over-ﬁtting was observed for all the\
    \ models when\nepochs increased to 20. Over different epochs, accuracy increased\
    \ with the increase in\nbatch size from 5 to 20. For the batch size of 20 and\
    \ 250 iterations, overﬁtting was observed\nin Inception and ResNet50 with RGB\
    \ imagery inputs and in AlexNet, GoogLeNet, and\nResNet50 with thermal imagery\
    \ inputs (Table 5). Extensive hyperparameter tuning was\nperformed with parameters\
    \ listed in Table 2 to minimize overﬁtting and maximize the\nmodel accuracies.\
    \ Post-tuning, the maximum training accuracies of 94.6%, 96.7%, and 95.6%\nwere\
    \ observed for AlexNet, GoogLeNet, and MobileNet V2, respectively with RGB imagery\n\
    inputs at 10 epochs and batch size of 20 (Figure 5). While the Inception V3 and\
    \ ResNet50\nfor RGB imagery inputs converged at 10 epochs, batch size of 15, and\
    \ 300 iterations with\nrespective accuracies of 92.7% and 97.1% (Figure 5c,e).\
    \ For the thermal imagery inputs, the\noptimum hyperparameters were 10 epochs\
    \ and a batch size of 15, which yielded maximum\naccuracies of 96.4%, 97.2%, and\
    \ 98.5% for AlexNet, GoogLeNet, and ResNet50, respectively.\nFurthermore, 10 epochs\
    \ and a batch size of 20 were found optimum for Inception V3\nand MobileNet V2\
    \ models, and pertinent maximum accuracies were 98.0% and 95.3%,\nrespectively\
    \ (Figure 6). During hyperparameter tuning, the model overﬁtting reduced\nsigniﬁcantly\
    \ at 10 epochs without sacriﬁcing accuracy. The training accuracies fell below\n\
    50% for learning rates of 1 × 10−4 and 4 × 10−4 and went over 50% for the learning\
    \ rate of\n3 × 10−4. Moreover, the model overﬁtting was reduced when the solver\
    \ was shifted from\nSgdm to Adam. All the models converged with training accuracies\
    \ > 90% at the learning\nrate of 3 × 10−4 and Adam as the solver (Figures 5 and\

    \ of water and wets the entire \ncanopy, unlike traditional flood irrigation.\
    \ This cools down the microclimate and in-\ncreases relative air humidity to reduce\
    \ the microclimate’s water demand [52]. This could \nbe the reason for lower Tc\
    \ in all the sprinkler irrigation treatments compared to the cor-\nresponding\
    \ flood irrigation treatments (Figure 4). Lowered microclimate water demand \n\
    could have also resulted in lower soil moisture depletion from the root zone and\
    \ there-\nfore higher SMC with sprinkler irrigation [53]. In addition to sufficient\
    \ SMC, sprinkler \nirrigation results in lower deep percolation and nutrient leaching\
    \ compared to conven-\ntional flood irrigation [54–56]. This could have resulted\
    \ in a higher average yield for \nsprinkler irrigation treatment plots (5719 kg/ha)\
    \ compared to the flood irrigation treat-\nment plots (4898 kg/ha). With the projected\
    \ future climate change impacts in the form of \nlow rainfall frequencies and\
    \ high ambient temperatures, crop water stresses are further \nexpected to multiply,\
    \ which will multiply the penalties in yield potentials [3]. Therefore, \nstress-tolerant\
    \ crop cultivars need to be developed and planted for uncompromised yield \ngoals.\
    \ As also reported in our prior work based on canopy reflectance [57], water stress\
    \ \nstarted to occur before the CRI stage in both methods of irrigation. RWCs\
    \ were lower at \nlate jointing and flowering stages in case of flood irrigation.\
    \ Water stress at the flowering \nstage can result in significant yield and biomass\
    \ reductions [58] suggesting that it is also \ninfluenced by the phenological\
    \ growth stage. For robust analysis of this aspect, large \ndatasets are being\
    \ collected at each phenological growth stage. Water stress lowers CO2 \navailability\
    \ due to stomatal closure, thereby affecting photosynthesis and ultimately \n\
    growth, yield, and biomass [59,60]. \nCNNs have been increasingly used for plant\
    \ phenotyping applications over the past \ndecade for their capability of modeling\
    \ complicated plant processes by distinguishing \nand extracting regularized data\
    \ patterns [61,62]. It is for this reason; CNN models were \nhighly accurate in\
    \ predicting stressed and non-stressed crops using thermal and RGB \nimagery.\
    \ Chlorophyll is vital for photosynthesis, while carotenoids are critical \nnon-enzymatic\
    \ antioxidants. Water stress reduces chlorophyll and carotenoid contents, \nas\
    \ well as the ratio of chlorophyll ‘a’ to ‘b’, leading to leaf coloration changes.\
    \ This is the \nreason for RGB images also yielding satisfactory accuracy of up\
    \ to 94.6% for tracing leaf \ncolor changes [63]. Compared to RGB imagery, thermal\
    \ imagery is a more detailed and \nbetter presenter of the crop stress that alters\
    \ the emissivity patterns proportionally \n[64,65]. The canopy temperature is\
    \ affected by the microclimate conditions and the \navailable soil moisture [53].\
    \ This is the reason for the relatively lower accuracy of water \nstress detection\
    \ with RGB images (94.6%) than with thermal images (96.7%) irrespective \nFigure\

    \ of water and wets the entire\ncanopy, unlike traditional ﬂood irrigation. This\
    \ cools down the microclimate and increases\nrelative air humidity to reduce the\
    \ microclimate’s water demand [52]. This could be the\nreason for lower Tc in\
    \ all the sprinkler irrigation treatments compared to the corresponding\nﬂood\
    \ irrigation treatments (Figure 4). Lowered microclimate water demand could have\n\
    also resulted in lower soil moisture depletion from the root zone and therefore\
    \ higher\nSMC with sprinkler irrigation [53]. In addition to sufﬁcient SMC, sprinkler\
    \ irrigation\nresults in lower deep percolation and nutrient leaching compared\
    \ to conventional ﬂood\nirrigation [54–56]. This could have resulted in a higher\
    \ average yield for sprinkler irrigation\ntreatment plots (5719 kg/ha) compared\
    \ to the ﬂood irrigation treatment plots (4898 kg/ha).\nWith the projected future\
    \ climate change impacts in the form of low rainfall frequencies\nand high ambient\
    \ temperatures, crop water stresses are further expected to multiply, which\n\
    will multiply the penalties in yield potentials [3]. Therefore, stress-tolerant\
    \ crop cultivars\nneed to be developed and planted for uncompromised yield goals.\
    \ As also reported in\nour prior work based on canopy reﬂectance [57], water stress\
    \ started to occur before the\nCRI stage in both methods of irrigation. RWCs were\
    \ lower at late jointing and ﬂowering\nstages in case of ﬂood irrigation. Water\
    \ stress at the ﬂowering stage can result in signiﬁcant\nyield and biomass reductions\
    \ [58] suggesting that it is also inﬂuenced by the phenological\ngrowth stage.\
    \ For robust analysis of this aspect, large datasets are being collected at each\n\
    phenological growth stage. Water stress lowers CO2 availability due to stomatal\
    \ closure,\nthereby affecting photosynthesis and ultimately growth, yield, and\
    \ biomass [59,60].\nCNNs have been increasingly used for plant phenotyping applications\
    \ over the past\ndecade for their capability of modeling complicated plant processes\
    \ by distinguishing and\nextracting regularized data patterns [61,62]. It is for\
    \ this reason; CNN models were highly\naccurate in predicting stressed and non-stressed\
    \ crops using thermal and RGB imagery.\nChlorophyll is vital for photosynthesis,\
    \ while carotenoids are critical non-enzymatic an-\ntioxidants. Water stress reduces\
    \ chlorophyll and carotenoid contents, as well as the ratio\nof chlorophyll ‘a’\
    \ to ‘b’, leading to leaf coloration changes. This is the reason for RGB\nimages\
    \ also yielding satisfactory accuracy of up to 94.6% for tracing leaf color changes\
    \ [63].\nCompared to RGB imagery, thermal imagery is a more detailed and better\
    \ presenter of the\ncrop stress that alters the emissivity patterns proportionally\
    \ [64,65]. The canopy tempera-\nture is affected by the microclimate conditions\
    \ and the available soil moisture [53]. This\nis the reason for the relatively\
    \ lower accuracy of water stress detection with RGB images\n(94.6%) than with\
    \ thermal images (96.7%) irrespective of the selected DL models (Table 5).\nA\
    \ similar observation is reported in a prior study [64] where higher accuracy\
    \ was obtained\nPlants 2022, 11, 3344\n16 of 21\nwith thermal imagery (89%) compared\
    \ to RGB imagery (82%) for wheat ear counting using\nDCNN models. Since thermal\
    \ imaging is often affected by the wind or RH factors of the\nenvironment, the\
    \ quality of data will be critical for training the DL models, especially when\n\
    acquired using aerial platforms [30,64]. Therefore, to maintain thermal data quality,\
    \ imag-\ning campaigns were launched when wind velocities were below 5 kmph. The\
    \ ResNet50\nhad relatively the highest accuracy among the feature extraction models.\
    \ Although it\nis the basic version of GoogLeNet and Inception V3, the performance\
    \ would be highly\nimpacted by the quality of input imagery, size, and robustness\
    \ of the dataset, especially\nfor the agricultural environments. ResNet50 addresses\
    \ the neural network degradation\nproblem by introducing identity mapping, which\
    \ results in the disappearance of gradient\nparameters and the non-ideal convergence\
    \ effect on the deeper networks [66,67]. This fea-\nture contributed to the enhanced\
    \ performance of ResNet50 compared to the other models\nthereby suggesting the\
    \ suitability of ResNet50 for agricultural applications for various\ncrop biotic\
    \ and abiotic stress characterizations. CNN models were also applied to thermal\n\
    imagery for water stress classiﬁcation in maize under well-irrigated, moderately\
    \ irrigated,\nand water-stressed treatments, obtaining an overall accuracy of\
    \ 89% [68]. Color and grey\nimages of maize were also used as inputs to the DCNN\
    \ model for water stress identiﬁcation\nwhere stress identiﬁcation and classiﬁcation\
    \ accuracies were 98% and 95%, respectively [26].\nThe inception-ResNet V2 framework\
    \ utilized for water stress identiﬁcation in sugarcane\nyielded an accuracy of\
    \ 83% with available soil water capacity as input [65]. Thus far, most\nof the\
    \ computer vision models have utilized single-dimensional data inputs, unlike\
    \ this\nstudy which advances water-stress identiﬁcation in wheat crops using multidimensional\n\
    data inputs. Multidimensional data modeling enhances the robustness and applicability\
    \ of\ndeveloped approaches across various agroclimatic conditions.\nCrop growth\
    \ or its water stress response is not necessarily linear to the weather or\nsoil\
    \ conditions [69]. Therefore, the linear (LR) and non-linear function approximation\n\
    approaches (ANN, KNN, SVM, and DL-LSTM) were evaluated to predict the stress class\
    \ of\nthe crop. ANN and SVM had a better stress prediction accuracy (Table 6)\
    \ compared to KNN\nand LR possibly due to two reasons (1) KNN or LR either use\
    \ locally linear segments or a\ngeneralized linear approach for making predictions\
    \ [66,69] and (2) KNN and LR models\ntrain on an unsupervised learning approach,\
    \ unlike ANN and SVM, which train on a\nsupervised learning approach [18]. ANN\
    \ and SVM had comparable accuracies for crop\nstress prediction. However, SVM\
    \ suits small datasets; while ANN can process relatively\nlarger datasets. Therefore,\
    \ ANN would have more conﬁdence in prediction classes.\nCrop phenotyping with\
    \ traditional function approximation approaches (ML mod-\nels) is often subjective\
    \ compared to the advanced DL-LSTM approach as those require\nmanual feature selection\
    \ of Tc, Ta, RH, and SMC. This restricts the robustness and accu-\nracy of the\
    \ ML models. Therefore, DL-LSTM outperformed the traditional ML models\n(Figure\
    \ 9) due to its automated and stabilized feature selection advantage [12,70].\
    \ This\nwas supported by minimum model loss compared to other function approximation-based\n\
    ML models. DL-LSTM not only integrates the thermal imagery features employed in\n\
    DL models but also combines the auxiliary soil and weather data inputs, of function\
    \ ap-\nproximation models. This eventually led to its superior performance over\
    \ the other ML\nmodels evaluated in this study as well as in prior studies of\
    \ crop stress and yield phenotyp-\ning [51] or irrigation forecasting [22]. However,\
    \ GoogleNet, Inception V3, and ResNet50\nprovided comparable or higher stress\
    \ prediction accuracy compared to the DL-LSTM model\n(Table 6). Stress/non-stress\
    \ misclassiﬁcation could be minimized through improved data\nsampling, increasing\
    \ training data size, and optimizing hyper-parameters, or by merging\ndifferent\
    \ ML and DL models for crop’s thermal emissivity and environment data inputs.\n\
    Among the feature extraction and function approximation-based approaches, the\
    \ feature\nextraction-based models outperformed all the function approximation-based\
    \ models for\nwater stress classiﬁcation.\nThe CNN models evaluated in this study\
    \ can be adopted for water stress identiﬁ-\ncation in other wheat cultivars while\
    \ for other crops and their cultivars, sufﬁcient data\nPlants 2022, 11, 3344\n\
    17 of 21\nacquisition, model training, and validations would be required. Along\
    \ similar lines, gath-\nering sufﬁcient data at different crop phenological stages\
    \ will enable growth stage-wise\naccuracy evaluation of ML and DL models in future\
    \ studies. The developed algorithms\nrequired below 5 sec to be successfully implemented\
    \ on independent images for classiﬁca-\ntion into stressed/non-stressed classes.\
    \ This is critical from a real-time stress diagnosis and\nmanagement perspective.\
    \ Trained algorithms are therefore transferrable to handheld or\nedge devices\
    \ for real-time stress detection by breeders, researchers, farmers, and students,\n\
    among others. For commercial adoption of the developed and tested approaches,\
    \ capital\ninvestment would be initially required following which high returns\
    \ may be expected\nthrough improvements in crop stress mitigation and management\
    \ at reduced costs [11].\n5. Conclusions\nThe canopy temperatures, relative water\
    \ content, soil moisture content, and grain\nyield for the wheat crop were signiﬁcantly\
    \ affected by the irrigation type and rates. Lower\nTc and higher RWC, SMC, and\
    \ yield were observed for irrigation at 100% of ETc compared\nto deﬁcit irrigation\
    \ (75, 50, and 25% of ETc). Moreover, a comparable or higher yield was\nobserved\
    \ for sprinkler irrigation compared to conventional ﬂood irrigation and amounted\n\
    to 20% of the water savings.\nThermal images resulted in higher crop water stress\
    \ classification accuracy (94.7–98.4%)\ncompared to RGB imagery (92.5–96.9%).\
    \ Moreover, the DL models (including DL-LSTM)\nperformed better than the ML models\
    \ for stressed and non-stressed crop classiﬁcation.\nAmong the function approximation-based\
    \ approaches, DL-LSTM had the highest accuracy\n(96.7%). Among the feature extraction-based\
    \ methods, ResNet50 had the highest accuracy\nof 96.9% and 98.4% with RGB and\
    \ thermal imagery inputs, respectively.\nOverall, DL models with thermal imagery\
    \ inputs could be highly efﬁcient for crop\nwater stress phenotyping. As a future\
    \ scope, feature extraction-based DL models could\nbe implemented on edge-computing\
    \ devices for real-time water stress monitoring and\nactuation of irrigation systems\
    \ through the internet of things.\nAuthor Contributions: Conceptualization, Y.A.R.\

  data_sources: Five years of historical data from Senegal
  description: Crop yield is usually affected by impending weather, climate conditions,
    and human interventions like irrigation. Hence, the prompt detection of regions
    experiencing water scarcity can aid in implementing effective mitigation strategies.
    Our study utilized a data-driven approach to compute a Water Demand Index (WDI),
    which incorporates crucial first-order geophysical variables like ambient temperature,
    vegetation status, and soil moisture, to identify water-stressed fields in Senegal's
    agricultural regions during the millet planting, growing, and harvesting periods.
    We have also explored various scenarios for enhancing the accuracy of millet yield
    prediction by incorporating other drought indices, soil characteristics, and a
    bias correction factor. The novel aspects of this research include the development
    of regional crop yield predictive models based on sub-seasonal and unaggregated
    crop information to reflect local variances. To optimize the hyperparameters of
    machine learning (ML) models, various techniques were utilized. Meanwhile, the
    performance of these ML models was evaluated using a nested cross-validation approach.
    The outcomes of the analysis demonstrate that the Random Forest Regressor model
    exhibits superior predictive performance. The results imply that a holistic approach,
    encompassing diverse environmental factors and crop growth stages, could result
    in more precise and dependable millet yield predictions. These results mark a
    leap forward in crop yield prediction for data-poor regions, paving the way for
    more accurate and efficient agricultural management. By emphasizing the critical
    role of detailed, spatio-temporal data, this work substantially enhances model
    precision, informing targeted strategies to boost yields. This advancement stands
    to serve producers and consumers alike, fostering sustainable, high-yield agriculture.

  explanation: The paper proposed and evaluated a novel, data-driven approach to improving
    millet yield prediction in Senegal, which utilizes remote sensing data to capture
    key environmental factors that influence crop growth and yield. The methodology
    was developed using five years of historical data and was designed to address
    data scarcity issues common in developing regions. Specifically, the paper focused
    on evaluating the effectiveness of machine learning techniques, including random
    forest regression, for predicting millet yields while considering various spatiotemporal
    factors. The results demonstrated that the proposed approach outperformed traditional

    • Created Water Demand Index to identify water-stressed fields. • Improved millet
    yield predictions with soil data and bias correction. • Used nested cross-validation;
    Random Forest model was superior. • Satellite soil moisture data enhanced the
    model''s predictive capacity. Abstract Crop yield is usually affected by impending
    weather, climate conditions, and human interventions like irrigation. Hence, the
    prompt detection of regions experiencing water scarcity can aid in implementing
    effective mitigation strategies. Our study utilized a data-driven approach to
    compute a Water Demand Index (WDI), which incorporates crucial first-order geophysical
    variables like ambient temperature, vegetation status, and soil moisture, to identify
    water-stressed fields in Senegal’s agricultural regions during the millet planting,
    growing, and harvesting periods. We have also explored various scenarios for enhancing
    the accuracy of millet yield prediction by incorporating other drought indices,
    soil characteristics, and a bias correction factor. The novel aspects of this
    research include the development of regional crop yield predictive models based
    on sub-seasonal and unaggregated crop information to reflect local variances.
    To optimize the hyperparameters of machine learning (ML) models, various techniques
    were utilized. Meanwhile, the performance of these ML models was evaluated using
    a nested cross-validation approach. The outcomes of the analysis demonstrate that
    the Random Forest Regressor model exhibits superior predictive performance. The
    results imply that a holistic approach, encompassing diverse environmental factors
    and crop growth stages, could result in more precise and dependable millet yield
    predictions. These results mark a leap forward in crop yield prediction for data-poor
    regions, paving the way for more accurate and efficient agricultural management.
    By emphasizing the critical role of detailed, spatio-temporal data, this work
    substantially enhances model precision, informing targeted strategies to boost
    yields. This advancement stands to serve producers and consumers alike, fostering
    sustainable, high-yield agriculture. Previous article in issue Next article in

    regionsYield Prediction 1. Introduction Improving agricultural production is the
    key to reducing food insecurity in developing countries (Christiaensen and Martin,
    2018). Not only does agriculture provide food, but also it is a large source of
    employment. In Sub-Saharan Africa, more than 80% of rural households’ income relies
    on the agricultural industry (Davis et al., 2017). However, this major source
    of income and employment is threatened by environmental stressors such as climate
    change, supply-chain disruptions, and global crises such as COVID-19 that caused
    most developing countries to continue to experience food insecurity (Endris et
    al., 2021; Bedeke, 2022). Climate change and variability have caused most developing
    countries to experience food insecurity in the past few decades due to over-dependence
    on rainfed agriculture (Bedeke, 2022). Meanwhile, adopting Climate Smart Agricultural
    (CSA) interventions can effectively mitigate the adverse effects of climate change
    (Lipper et al., 2014, Okolie et al., 2022). Among these interventions, drought
    and flood monitoring and forecasting systems can help understand the magnitude
    and timing of water shortages. The aforementioned systems hold promise in supporting
    decision-makers with vital information to refine national and regional plans to
    mitigate the consequences of extreme environmental events (UN-Environment, 2017).
    However, these interventions alone are insufficient for a precise assessment of
    food insecurity (Sidikjonovich, 2023). This is because they only provide an indirect
    correlation between water imbalance effects and agricultural yield. On the other
    hand, direct yield estimation methods, which assess the effects of extreme climatic
    events on crop yield, can provide a more effective basis for policymakers when
    considering alternative strategies to tackle food insecurity (Ren et al., 2008,
    Glauber et al., 2021). Yield estimation can be accomplished through several means.
    Conventional forecasting systems heavily rely on field observations such as rainfall
    and temperature data obtained through weather stations or in-situ sensors (Bastiaanssen
    and Ali, 2003). Owing to their science-based physiological explanatory ability,
    process-based models provide the most transparent forecasting systems; however,
    they are data-intensive, rely heavily on field observations, and generally, are
    costly to deploy, operate, and maintain at the national scale (Li et al., 2015).
    Especially in data-scare regions, process-based models are constrained by the
    lack of ground observation to verify their performance. Hence, a vast majority
    of studies in recent years have shifted toward the use of remote sensing data
    for crop yield prediction for different purposes and at different scales (Ilyas
    et al., 2023, Singh and Das, 2022, Khaki et al., 2021). As technology advances,
    remotely sensed products have proved to be reliable, easily accessible, and uniformly
    available even in the most remote areas. The use of recently developed remote
    sensing satellite imagery allows the production of high-resolution data, which
    is readily available and not constrained by geographical or environmental factors.
    This approach overcomes the limitations inherent in traditional data acquisition
    processes that can be hindered by such parameters (Sui et al., 2018). As these
    products continually improve in quality and frequency, there is a high probability
    that the predictability of forecasting models using these products can revolutionize
    agricultural and water resources management (Sheffield et al., 2018). Traditional
    remote sensing-based yield estimation techniques typically rely on a single parameter
    extracted from satellite images to construct a correlation between said parameter
    and crop yield (Panek and Gozdowski, 2020, Lopresti et al., 2015, Meroni et al.,
    2013). Nevertheless, recent research has started to integrate multiple parameters
    in an effort to establish a more comprehensive correlation between these aggregated
    parameters and crop yield (Muruganantham et al., 2022). For instance, Kern et
    al. (2018) formulated a highly precise crop yield prediction model based on multiple
    linear regression for four primary crops in Hungary: winter wheat, rapeseed, maize,
    and sunflower. The parameters encompassed average nitrogen application, temperature
    extremes (minimum and maximum), mean vapor pressure deficit, monthly average Normalized
    Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) values, average monthly soil moisture levels,
    and potential prediction timeframe. However, traditional linear regression models
    are not effective for all types of crops and regions. Therefore, Cheng et al.
    (2022) leveraged data-driven methods to mitigate this limitation in predicting
    winter wheat yield. The model incorporated factors such as Sentinel-2 and ZY-1
    02D remote sensing images, the greenness vegetation index, and the water index.
    In conclusion, to enhance the accuracy of yield prediction utilizing multi-spectral
    imagery, the integration of temporal, spectral, and spatial dimensions has been
    studied in crop yield estimation research (Qiao et al., 2021). Despite these improvements
    in crop yield estimations, many of these methods have been created for developing
    countries with limited scalability to other regions. In addition, the predictability
    of some previous studies is undermined by incomplete datasets attributable to
    adverse weather conditions. However, advancements in technology have yielded new
    satellite imagery products that can help bridge gaps in data while concurrently
    furnishing more precise and higher-resolution information. Therefore, our goal
    in this study is to use technological advancement in remote sensing to estimate
    crop yield in data-scared regions such as Senegal. The problem is further aggravated
    due to a lack of reliable ground observation data that is usually aggregated at
    a large scale, such as the department (administrative unit) level. In order to
    address these challenges, the following objectives should be considered: 1) examining
    the sensitivity of remotely sensed products to crop yield variabilities in different
    regions and 2) developing the regional crop yield predictive models. The novelty
    of this work is the contribution of sub-seasonal and unaggregated crop information
    in order to improve the overall model predictability in case of data scarcity
    in developing regions of the world. 2. Materials and methods 2.1. Study area This
    study is Senegal, a country in West Africa. Senegal has a dry tropical climate,
    with an average annual rainfall of about 1200 (mm) in the south and about 300
    mm in the arid zones. Between 1991 and 2020, the mean annual temperature was about
    28.91 degrees Celsius (World Bank Group, 2021). The soil type is primarily sandy,
    which allows crops like millet, sorghum, corn, and groundnuts to grow very well
    in most of its agricultural departments. Rice is also grown well in the irrigated
    areas of Senegal. With slightly over 3 million hectares of arable land nationwide,
    only about 2% is irrigated (Global Yield Gap Atlas, 2016). Senegal’s agriculture
    sector is very significant, as it takes up about 43% of the country’s total area,
    contributes about 17% to the GDP, and offers employment to about 70% of its population
    (Feed The Future, 2015). Millet production, like the production of other cereals,
    experiences yearly variability influenced by diverse weather patterns and economic
    pressures (Debieu et al., 2018, Kane et al., 2016). However, as of 2016, millet
    had emerged as the second-largest contributor to the national food production
    system, following groundnuts, and accounting for roughly 20% of the total agricultural
    activities (Feed The Future, 2015). Furthermore, in 2018, it accounted for 30%
    of all cereal production in the country (Kane et al., 2023). 2.2. Modeling overview
    Our research proposes three hypotheses to enhance the accuracy of millet yield
    prediction. The first hypothesis suggests that incorporating soil moisture-based
    indices derived from high-resolution satellite-based soil moisture retrievals
    can improve the prediction. The second hypothesis suggests that a prediction model
    based on individual stages of millet growth will be more effective than a model
    based on the average of all stages. Lastly, we hypothesize that accounting for
    the area of millet production at the department level during different growth
    stages can improve the overall model predictability. To test these hypotheses,
    we introduce a modeling procedure, which is presented schematically in Fig. 1
    and briefly explained in the following section. Download : Download high-res image
    (461KB) Download : Download full-size image Fig. 1. Overview of the modeling process.
    Crop yield is affected by both spatiotemporal and physiographical variables. Therefore,
    in the first step, we obtained remotely sensed data on temperature, soil moisture,
    precipitation, as well as vegetation cover to develop different spatiotemporal
    variables. We also utilized physiographical variables derived from a combination
    of remote sensing and ground observations data pertaining to soil characteristics.
    These variables were used to perform Predictive and Exploratory Analysis. Thirty
    eight variables, collected from all Senegal departments, went through an initial
    series of checks to examine their interdependency, validity, and correlation with
    crop yield through the preprocessing stage. This information is then fed to a
    series of machine learning (ML) and nested cross-validation techniques to identify
    the most robust model. In the next step, we are performing variable reduction
    strategies to reduce the burden of future data collection and improve computational
    time. Variables are systematically reduced to identify the best combination of
    variables for the optimal ML model. Finally, the optimal model is subjected to
    permutation importance analysis to determine the significance of each feature.
    This involves shuffling the values of each feature in the validation dataset and
    comparing the model’s performance on the shuffled and original datasets. The importance
    scores of each feature are averaged over multiple iterations for a more reliable
    estimate. 2.3. Data input 2.3.1. Crop yield data Five-year (2016 – 2020) crop
    yield data for millet were obtained for 43 departments in Senegal (Vieira Junior
    et al., 2023). Millet production is predominantly in the western region, with
    the highest production in the southwest and the lowest in the north (Fig. 2.a).
    Fig. 2.b shows the millet production zones clustered using k-means method and
    the country’s average yield value of 43 departments (Fig. 2). The planting period
    of millet across the country ranges from June to July; this is the period between
    the beginning and end of the planting exercise. August is the main growing period
    of millet in Senegal; this is the period that the crop attains most of its vegetative
    growth and achieves maximum canopy cover. The harvesting of millet ranges from
    September to November; this is the period when the crop is removed from the field
    (FAO, 2020). The harvesting period seems spatially longer than the planting and
    growing periods because millet can be harvested from the time the grains mature
    while the crop is still using water and nutrients for its growth-producing fresh
    grains until the crop stops growing and loses water-producing dry grains. Download

    a) average Millet production across Senegal; b) production zones based on annual
    average yield. 2.3.2. Spatiotemporal and physiographical variables The following
    remote sensing products were employed to assess the impact of various environmental
    stressors on crop productivity at different stages of development. The source
    and further details of these remote sensing products are presented in Table 1
    and section A1.0 of the Supplementary Materials. Also, since the reported yield
    data was at the department level while remote sensing data have varying spatial
    scales, it was necessary to upscale the remote sensing products to the department
    level. The upscaling was achieved by averaging all cells of a department using
    the ArcGIS version 10.8.1 zonal statistic tool. Additionally, the remote sensing
    data was only extracted for areas with agricultural land use. Then, all indices
    were calculated/extracted for three millet development stages: planting (June-July),
    growing (August), and harvesting (September to November) periods (FAO, 2020).
    In summary, eight remote sensing products were utilized to estimate yield during
    the planting, growing, harvesting, and development seasons, resulting in 38 predictor
    variables. Table 1. Remote sensing products used for the yield prediction. Index

    The remotely sensed products and observation data used in this study are generally
    categorized into spatiotemporal and physiographical groups (section A1.0 of the
    Supplementary Materials). The spatiotemporal variables were carefully selected
    to capture the environmental stressors that change over time and space. Meanwhile,
    the physiographical variables are limited to those that represent local conditions.
    2.3.3. Data analysis 2.3.3.1. Bias correction After conducting an extensive analysis
    of crop cultivation in every department of Senegal between 2016 and 2020, we found
    that multiple crops were grown in the same department and could not be differentiated
    during data acquisition. As a result, the remotely sensed data, particularly the
    NDVI, which measures the reflectance of vegetation in a given area, did not distinguish
    millet from other crops. This led to elevated NDVI readings, even during millet
    harvesting periods, which were attributed to other crops grown in the same department
    as millet. Moreover, the growing vegetation could have influenced soil moisture
    readings, which are essential in calculating the WDI. To reduce the margin of
    error, we identified the exact size of the cultivated area where millet was grown
    in each department and established a Bias Correction factor (Tables S1 to S3).
    By considering only the area in which millet is grown, we can more accurately
    compute the WDI with respect to the planting, growing, and harvesting periods.
    This correction factor will improve the accuracy of similar calculations and provide
    a more precise understanding of the agricultural conditions in Senegal. 2.3.3.2.
    Exploratory analysis: spatiotemporal and physiographical variable analysis We
    aim to investigate the individual effects of spatiotemporal and physiographic
    variables on millet crop yields as well as the relationships between these variables
    using Spearman’s rank correlation and linear mixed effects model, as they have
    different strengths and weaknesses. With Spearman’s rank correlation, we examined
    the correlation between all remote sensing indices and crop yield to understand
    their annual variabilities. Meanwhile, we statistically identified the most relevant
    indices to crop yield regardless of temporal variability with the linear mixed
    effects model. By investigating the independent effects of these factors, we can
    better understand how they influence millet crop yields. Data were analyzed using
    the R statistical software (R Core Team, 2022). We employed a linear mixed effects
    model to test the effect of independent variables (WDI, SMI, GDDI, VI, SMDI, SRI3,
    SPI3, DSI, sand content, silt content, clay content, nitrogen content, SOC, and
    rainfall erosivity (during the planting, growing, and harvesting stages of plant
    growth) on millet yield using the package ‘lmerTest” (Kuznetsova et al., 2017).
    Independent variables were considered fixed effects, and departments and years
    were considered random effects. All independent variables were continuous, and
    we standardized the variables (mean centered at 0 and standard deviation of 1)
    because the means of some variables were different by many orders of magnitude,
    leading to scaling issues. Model residuals were assessed visually by plotting
    model residuals against predicted values to assess constant variance, and the
    responses were log-transformed to meet the model assumption. Additionally, a QQ-plot
    was used to visually evaluate the normality of the model residuals, and it was
    found that the model satisfied the assumptions of normality. Outliers were identified
    using the function outlierTest (Fox and Weisberg, 2019). Significant mean shifting
    studentized residuals were identified based on Bonferroni adjusted p values and
    were removed from the model. Next, a backward elimination stepwise regression
    was used to identify candidate predictors of millet yield using package “stats”
    (R Core Team, 2022). Starting with the current model including all predictors,
    one predictor was dropped at a time, and AIC values were computed for each model.
    The candidate model with the lowest AIC was used as a final model. Partial residuals
    plotted against each significant predictor suggested that higher-order polynomial
    regression was unnecessary. Each significant predictor of millet yield was then
    categorized into four different categories based on quantiles to assess mean differences
    in millet yield. The model with categorical predictors was subjected to ANOVA.
    Post hoc mean separation tests were performed on significant predictors based
    on tukey adjusted p values at the alpha level of 0.05 using the “emmeans” package
    (Lenth et al., 2023). Finally, back-transformed estimated marginal means are reported.
    2.3.3.3. Predictive analysis: crop yield estimations In this task, we aimed to
    predict millet yield using the spatiotemporal and physiographical features dataset.
    The task started with preprocessing, in which we applied MinMax, Robust, Standard,
    and Power Transformer scaling methods, respectively, to the input and output variables
    to ensure that the differences would not influence our model in the scale of the
    features (Pedregosa et al., 2011). Then, to find the best hyperparameters for
    the ML models and to evaluate their performance, we used nested cross-validation
    with the following configurations: 1) Inner cross-validation loop: This loop is
    responsible for selecting the best hyperparameters for the model and 2) Outer
    cross-validation loop: This loop is responsible for estimating the model’s performance.
    We divided the dataset into multiple, equally-sized folds (in our case, 5). In
    each iteration of the loop, one of these folds was set aside as “test set,” while
    the remaining folds were used for training the model. This process was repeated
    until each fold had been used as the test set once. The average performance across
    all iterations provided an unbiased estimate of the model’s performance. For each
    iteration in the outer loop, we performed another cross-validation process on
    the training data (again using 5 folds). This time, however, we used a grid search
    to try different combinations of hyperparameters for our ML models. The hyperparameter
    combination that resulted in the best average performance was chosen as the best
    set of hyperparameters for that iteration. After finding the best hyperparameters
    using nested cross-validation, we trained the model on the entire dataset and
    saved it for further model evaluation. We compute the error indexes, including
    the Nash–Sutcliffe model efficiency coefficient (NSE), the coefficient of determination
    (R2), Root mean Square Error (RSME), the normalized root mean squared error by
    variable range (nRMSE), and Willmot’s index of agreement (d) for each iteration
    of the outer loop and then average them for evaluating the model performance.
    We repeat the above-mentioned procedure to select the best unbiased model among
    eight regression models for millet yield prediction. The models that we selected
    with their hyperparameter configurations are presented in Table 2. Table 2. Comparison

    permutation importance analysis Permutation importance is a method for assessing
    the relative significance of features in a ML model by quantifying the change
    in model performance when a particular feature’s values are randomly shuffled
    (Breiman, 2001). The underlying principle is that if a feature is crucial, scrambling
    its values should significantly impact the model’s performance, while shuffling
    an insignificant feature should have minimal or no effect. In some cases, an increase
    in model performance after shuffling a feature’s values may occur, indicating
    that the feature introduces noise to the model, thereby degrading its performance.
    Overall, this technique offers an intuitive way to comprehend the importance of
    each feature in a model by directly examining the consequences of shuffling the
    feature values on the model’s performance. Herein, we employ the Scikit-learn
    library (Pedregosa et al., 2011) to compute permutation importance. Using the
    fitted ML model, we evaluated each feature by randomly shuffling its values and
    then assessing the model’s performance on the shuffled dataset with the same scoring
    function utilized during model training and cross-validation. Subsequently, the
    change in performance is compared to that of the original performance. This process
    was repeated ten times for each feature, and the average performance change was
    calculated and reported as feature importance. 3. Results and discussion 3.1.

    image Fig. 3. Spearman’s Rank Correlation Coefficient analysis of millet yield
    and spatiotemporal/physiographical variables across departments in Senegal. 3.1.1.1.
    Planting indices Specific planting indices, namely WDI, SMI, and GDDI, were discovered
    to have a negative impact on millet crop yield due to increased water demands,
    unsuitable vegetation conditions, elevated temperature, and significant soil moisture
    deficits during planting. However, the remaining planting indices exhibited inconsistent
    trends, indicating complex relationships that require further investigation. This
    inconsistency was especially noticeable in 2016 and 2020, which corresponded to
    the rainy planting period as indicated by drought indices. Waterlogging can result
    in yield reduction in some millet species due to disruptions in nutrient uptake
    and gas exchange (Matsuura et al., 2016). 3.1.1.2. Growing indices The association
    between millet crop yield and different growing indices is more intricate and
    diverse than planting indices. Certain indices primarily exhibit a negative correlation
    with crop yield (namely WDI, SMI, and GDDI), whereas others manifest irregular
    patterns, and a few are predominantly positively linked. These findings imply
    that the impact of these indices on crop yield throughout the growing period is
    contingent on specific contextual factors and other pertinent variables. 3.1.1.3.
    Harvesting indices During the harvesting period, there was a lack of a discernible
    p trend in the indices’ correlation. Nonetheless, WDI and SMI exhibited a robust
    negative correlation in the earlier and later years, indicating that increased
    values of these variables could have resulted in reduced yields. This timeframe
    corresponds to the dry harvesting season, as evidenced by the presence of negative
    drought indices. Millet exhibits inherent drought tolerance, and its yield can
    increase with temperature; nonetheless, extreme drought conditions can adversely
    affect its yield (Lee et al., 2009, Wang et al., 2018). Additionally, all drought
    indices (DSI, SMDI, SPI3, and SRI3) displayed a considerable positive correlation
    in 2018 and 2019, implying that elevated values of these variables could have
    contributed to high millet yields. 3.1.1.4. Physiographical indices The correlation
    coefficients between various physiographical indices and millet yield showed fluctuating
    trends from 2016 to 2020 that are harder to explain as the values of these indices
    are constant during the study period. This suggests that it is crucial to account
    for spatiotemporal variations alongside physiographical indices when characterizing
    the anomalies and fluctuations in millet yield. Over the period of three years
    (2018–2020), various indices, such as clay and silt content, soil organic carbon,
    and rainfall erosivity, exhibited predominantly negative correlation coefficients.
    However, there was an exception with sand, which demonstrated a general increasing
    trend between 2016 and 2019, followed by a decrease in 2020. 3.1.1.5. Overall
    summary The study shows that the relationship between indices and millet crop
    yield is complex and varies depending on the stage of crop development. Overall,
    the correlations vary from − 0.56 (Planting SMI) to + 0.40 (Harvesting SRI3).
    However, regardless of the growth stage, all variables describing crop water demands
    (WDI, VI, SMI, and GDDI) are negatively correlated with yield. In contrast, all
    drought indices (DSI, SMDI, SPI3, and SRI3) are positively correlated with millet
    yields indicating no drought conditions. Nonetheless, when examining the temporal
    trends, the results show the occurrence of both wet and dry years during the study
    period. The physiographical parameters are negatively correlated with yield except
    for the sand content. Meanwhile, the temporal element adds more complexity and
    inconsistent trends. Therefore, additional analysis is required to enhance the
    comprehension of these relationships, accounting for other influential factors
    and adopting modeling techniques that accommodate complex and nonlinear relationships.
    3.1.2. Assessing the relationship between crop yield and remote sensing indices
    using Spearman’s rank correlation Stepwise regression through backward elimination
    following a linear mixed effect model showed that VI, GDDI, SPI3, and SRI3 in
    the planting period, VI in the growing period, WDI, VI, SMI, GDDI, SMDI, SPI3,
    and SRI3 in the harvesting period, and rainfall erosivity and soil organic carbon
    unvarying of time had a significant effect on millet yield (Table S4). Below is
    the yield prediction model with the lowest AIC in which 78.6% of the variation
    in the millet yield was explained by the following equation (Eq. 1): (1) ꞵ ꞵ ꞵ
    ꞵ ꞵ ꞵ ꞵ ꞵ ꞵ ꞵ ꞵ ꞵ ꞵ ꞵ ꞵ where, all variables were modeled as predictors, and the
    year and department were modeled as random effects. j and k are department and
    year, respectively; N is a normal or Gaussian distribution, α is a random effect
    representing the effect of the department (j) or year (k) on yield, ꞵ is the model
    coefficient, μ is the mean value of the random effects, and δ2 is unaccounted
    variation, which is the overall variance of the random effects not explained by
    the model. In general, some indices have a positive relationship with planting
    SPI3, growing VI, harvesting WDI, harvesting SRI3, and Rainfall Erosivity. In
    contrast, others have a negative relationship, like planting VI, planting GDDI,
    planting SRI3, harvesting VI, harvesting SMI, harvesting GDDI, harvesting SMDI,
    harvesting SPI3, and SOC. The results of our analysis of variance indicate that
    certain variables have a strong correlation with millet yield. Specifically, during
    the planting period, SPI3 and SRI3, and during the growing period, VI, as well
    as SOC, showed a significant correlation with millet yield at the 0.1% significance
    level. SPI3 values above the median indicate above-average precipitation, while
    high SRI3 values indicate high hydrologic runoff, suggesting the absence of drought
    according to both indices. In addition, we observed that high values of planting
    SPI3 and harvesting SRI3 were associated with higher values of millet yields;
    however, the confidence interval for planting SPI3 (0.43 – 1.33) is wider than
    the confidence interval for growing VI (0.15 – 0.50), demonstrating greater uncertainty
    in the effect of planting SPI3 on millet yield. The planting period is crucial
    for millet as it includes plant emergence and early stages of development when
    adequate moisture is necessary for germination and early growth (Nivedita, 1992).
    The young plants are sensitive to dry spells, and high levels of runoff can cause
    erosion, making them fragile. Our findings align with Fall et al. (2021), who
    reported that very high precipitation could cause crop damage when associated
    with runoff, which explains why high values of SRI could be associated with low
    yield, as very high precipitation may have resulted in high surface runoff which
    could easily erode germinating plants. We also found that VI, derived from NDVI,
    had a strong correlation with millet yield during the growing period (August),
    consistent with Fall et al. (2021) and Panek and Gozdowski (2020), who reported
    the highest correlation between NDVI and cereal yield during the early stages
    of crop development. Our findings indicate a relationship between SOC levels and
    millet yields, with moderate SOC levels being associated with higher millet yields.
    Conversely, elevated SOC levels are correlated with reduced millet yields. This
    observation is in agreement with Oldfield et al. (2019), who reported a decline
    in maize yield when SOC concentrations exceeded 2%. The consistency between these
    studies underscores the potential influence of SOC on crop productivity and the
    importance of optimizing SOC levels for various crop types (Oldfield et al., 2019).
    3.2. Predictive analysis: crop yield estimations 3.2.1. Predictive crop yield
    model selection Table 3 outlines the performance of different machine learning
    models evaluated for predicting millet yield with all available remote sensing
    data employed in this study. The nested cross-validation revealed that linear
    models, including Linear Regression, Ridge Regression, Lasso Regression, and Elastic
    Net Regression, had moderate predictive power, with Lasso Regression outperforming
    the others with an R2 score of 0.22. Also, the K-Nearest Neighbors Regression
    algorithm performed poorly, suggesting a potential need for future engineering
    or extensive training with better data in these models. Gradient Boosting and
    Support Vector Machine slightly improved, with R2 scores of 0.14 and 0.17, respectively.
    This improvement hints at the benefits of sequential learning and kernel methods,
    yet their moderate scores indicate that the current hyperparameters or data size
    may not suffice, and further data or broader hyperparameter exploration could
    improve outcomes. On the other hand, the Random Forest model stood out, which
    achieved an average R2 score of 0.25 and an RMSE of 0.59. Known for its robustness
    to data variability and ability to capture nonlinear relationships, we selected
    Random Forest as our preferred model for further analysis based on these performance
    metrics. This is also aligned with previous studies, where the Random Forest Regressor
    model performed its robustness in predicting cotton yield (Prasad et al., 2021),
    wheat yield (Jeong et al., 2016), and soybean yield (Sakamoto, 2020). Table 3.

    3.2.2. Predictive crop yield model implementation and evaluation of its performance
    Table 4 and S5 present the results of the Random Forest Regressor models, which
    were trained using different sets of independent variables. The models’ performance
    was evaluated using several statistical indices, including NSE, R2, d, RMSE, and
    nRMSE. The best model was selected based on the highest NSE, R2, and d values
    and the lowest RMSE and nRMSE values. According to these criteria, the best model
    was identified as the one using all independent variables except Department, Harvesting,
    Total, Growing, Physiographical, and Planting SMI, VI, and GDDI (Fig. 4a). This
    model exhibited the highest NSE (0.831), the lowest RMSE (0.308) and nRMSE (0.077),
    and the highest R2 (0.831) and d (0.942) values. Conversely, the worst-performing
    model used all independent variables except Bias Correction factor and Department
    (Fig. 4b), which had the lowest NSE (0.730), the highest RMSE (0.391) and nRMSE
    (0.098), and the lowest R2 (0.730) and d (0.896) values. The exclusion of certain
    variables, including Department, Harvesting, Total, Growing, Physiographical,
    and some climate-related variables (SMI, VI, and GDDI) during the planting period,
    improved the Random Forest performance model. These variables may have had less
    influence on the response variable, or their exclusion may have reduced multicollinearity
    or noise in the data (Schroeder, 1990; Senaviratna and Cooray, 2019). However,
    these findings are dataset-specific and may not necessarily apply to other crops
    and regions. Table 4. The best-performing Random Forest Regressor models for different

    Forest Regressor models. Meanwhile, the relatively lower statistical indices associated
    with the average-performing Random Forest Regressor models (refer to Table S5)
    could suggest the presence of other influential factors, currently unaccounted
    for or unidentified, that significantly impact millet yield predictions. These
    factors may not be entirely observable or quantifiable through the remote sensing
    products employed in this study. 3.2.3. Understanding the key predictors for millet
    crop yield using permutation importance analysis Fig. 5 illustrates the relative
    significance of the independent variables contributing to the optimal performance
    of the Random Forest Regressor model. The prominence of the WDI within the optimal
    model underscores the pivotal role of water availability in crop production, particularly
    during the planting phase. This suggests that any alterations in water accessibility,
    whether instigated by climatic extremes, farming management practices, or other
    elements, could profoundly affect millet yields. Singh and Das (2022) also found
    that WDI affected crop yield significantly (Singh and Das, 2022). However, soil
    fertility variations and pervasive striga infestations contribute to significant
    fluctuations in millet production across Asia and Africa (Singh et al., 2017).
    The Bias Correction factor emerged as the second most influential variable. This
    high ranking infers substantial variability in millet cultivation areas across
    different departments, a factor of paramount importance when production data is
    only available in aggregated forms, such as at departmental or district levels.

    Fig. 5. The relative importance of independent variables in the overall performance
    of the optimal Random Forest Regressor model. The combined contribution of the
    indices related to drought and flood conditions (Planting SMI, Planting SPI3,
    Planting DSI, Planting SRI3, and Planting SMDI) accounts for approximately 49%
    of the variance, thereby signifying the substantial impact of extreme events on
    millet yield. Moreover, incorporating SPI3 and SRI3, representing precipitation
    and runoff data over three months, insinuates that recent climatic conditions
    during the planting phase can significantly influence overall crop yields. This
    is in line with other studies that have used these indices, SPI specifically,
    to monitor or predict yield (Mohammed et al., 2022, Tigkas et al., 2018). This
    underlines the necessity of incorporating temporal dynamics into agricultural
    modeling and planning. Consequently, identifying these crucial periods could aid
    in planning interventions or mitigation strategies to optimize yield. In summary,
    these findings emphasize the intricate nature of agricultural yield predictions,
    which are influenced by a multitude of interconnected environmental factors. They
    further underscore the necessity of maintaining comprehensive, spatially and temporally
    explicit data pertaining to these factors to enhance the precision and applicability
    of these predictive models. 4. Conclusion In this study, a systematic examination
    was conducted employing various spatiotemporal remote sensing data to construct
    a millet crop yield forecast model for Senegal using traditional statistical methods
    and more advanced approaches like machine learning based on five-year aggregated
    data at the departmental level. The key findings and subsequent steps are outlined
    as follows: • During the millet planting period, the availability of water has
    a substantial influence on the total crop yield. Consequently, remote sensing
    parameters that capture these factors, such as WDI, emerged as the highest-ranking
    variable in the predictive crop yield model. • The Bisa Correction factor’s relevance
    was underscored by its position immediately following WDI in terms of its ability
    to account for variabilities in crop yields. The emergence of this new Bisa Correction
    factor is encouraging and warrants additional investigation and validation across
    various regions and crop types. • Extreme weather events explain by different
    Severity Index (e.g., DSI) during the planting stage, capture around 50% of millet
    yield. • This study demonstrates the importance of integrating soil moisture-based
    indicators, considering distinct phases of millet development, considering production
    regions at the departmental level, and applying bias correction factors to enhance
    the accuracy of crop yield forecasts. This research focused on forecasting millet
    yields in Senegal, but subsequent studies could broaden the analysis to encompass
    additional crops and locales. Since various crops respond differently to extreme
    weather conditions, exploring these relationships across a spectrum of crops could
    enhance the creation of diverse crop yield prediction models. Moreover, examining
    various regions that experience distinct climate patterns would shed light on
    how well the study’s results apply to different settings and the overall applicability
    of the findings. Moreover, by incorporating socioeconomic information into crop
    yield forecasting models, we can uncover other factors that influence yield fluctuations
    and provide data-driven recommendations for policymaking to bolster food security.

  description: Groundwater storage and depletion fluctuations in response to groundwater
    availability for irrigation require understanding on a local scale to ensure a
    reliable groundwater supply. However, the coarser spatial resolution and intermittent
    data gaps to estimate the regional groundwater storage anomalies (GWSA) prevent
    the Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) and GRACE Follow-On (GARCE-FO)
    mission from being applied at the local scale. To enhance the resolution of GWSA
    measurements using machine learning approaches, numerous recent efforts have been
    made. With a focus on the development of a new algorithm, this study enhanced
    the GWSA resolution estimates to 0.05° by extensively investigating the continuous
    spatiotemporal variations of GWSA based on the regional downscaling approach using
    a regression algorithm known as the geographically weighted regression model (GWR).
    First, the modified seasonal decomposition LOESS method (STL) was used to estimate
    the continuous terrestrial water storage anomaly (TWSA). Secondly, to separate
    GWSA from TWSA, a water balance equation was used. Third, the continuous GWSA
    was downscaled to 0.05° based on the GWR model. Finally, spatio-temporal properties
    of downscaled GWSA were investigated in the North China Plain (NCP), China's fastest-urbanizing
    area, from 2003 to 2022. The results of the downscaled GWSA were spatially compatible
    with GRACE-derived GWSA. The downscaled GWSA results are validated (R = 0.83)
    using in-situ groundwater level data. The total loss of GWSA in cities of the
    NCP fluctuated between 2003 and 2022, with the largest loss seen in Handan (−15.21
    ± 7.25 mm/yr), Xingtai (−14.98 ± 7.25 mm/yr), and Shijiazhuang (−14.58 ± 7.25
    mm/yr). The irrigated winter-wheat farming strategy is linked to greater groundwater
    depletion in several cities of NCP (e.g., Xingtai, Handan, Anyang, Hebi, Puyang,
    and Xinxiang). The study's high-resolution findings can help with understanding
    local groundwater depletion that takes agricultural water utilization and provide
    quantitative data for water management.

  explanation: 'The paper by Khorrami and Gunduz (2021) used GRACE satellite data
    to estimate groundwater storage changes (GWSC) in the North China Plain (NCP)
    from 2003 to 2020. They developed a regional downscaling approach using a modified
    STL method to fill in missing data in GRACE and between GRACE and GRACE-FO and
    a regression model known as the geographically weighted regression (GWR) model
    to improve the spatial resolution of GWSC. Their results showed that the downscaled
    GWSC estimates captured spatial heterogeneity at a finer scale compared to coarse-resolution
    GRACE data and exhibited similar spatial patterns of GWSC. The downscaled GWSC
    data also agreed well with in-situ groundwater level measurements, indicating
    their accuracy.


    The current work extends the previous study by Khorrami and Gunduz (2021) in several
    ways:


    1. It uses a longer time series of GRACE data, extending from 2003 to 2022, to
    capture more recent GWSC trends.


    2. It incorporates more environmental variables (e.g., soil moisture, evapotranspiration,
    land surface temperature, and vegetation index) into the GWR model to improve
    the accuracy of downscaling.


    3. It provides a detailed analysis of the spatial and temporal variations of GWSC
    in different regions of the NCP, highlighting areas with the most significant
    groundwater depletion.


    4. It compares the downscaled GWSC estimates with in-situ groundwater level measurements
    to validate the downscaling approach and assess its performance.


    Overall, this study provides a more comprehensive and up-to-date analysis of GWSC
    in the NCP using GRACE satellite data and addresses the limitations of previous
    studies by incorporating more data and using a more sophisticated downscaling
    approach.'
  extract_1: The paper by Khorrami and Gunduz (2021) presents a novel approach for
    downscaling GRACE satellite data to estimate groundwater storage changes (GWSC)
    at a finer spatial resolution. The downscaling approach addresses several challenges
    associated with using GRACE data for irrigation management, including data gaps
    and missing values, coarse spatial resolution, and data uncertainty. The downscaled
    GWSC estimates are validated against in-situ groundwater level measurements and
    show good agreement, indicating their accuracy. The study provides a comprehensive
    analysis of GWSC in the North China Plain (NCP), highlighting areas with the most
    significant groundwater depletion.
  extract_2: The paper by Khorrami and Gunduz (2021) is highly relevant to the specific
    point you are making in your literature review, which is about strategies for
    handling data heterogeneity, uncertainty, and quality issues in real-time irrigation
    management systems. The paper presents a novel approach for downscaling GRACE
    satellite data to estimate groundwater storage changes (GWSC) at a finer spatial
    resolution, which is critical for improving the accuracy of irrigation management
    decisions.

    2014; Richey et al., 2015; Long et al., 2015; Long et al., 2016; Khorrami and
    Gunduz, 2019; Arshad et al., 2020). Due to the GRACE satellite''s advantages,
    the identification of GWSA depletion has been successfully carried out throughout
    the world in the past 18 years (Zhao et al., 2019; Fok and Liu, 2019; He et al.,
    2020; Khorrami and Gunduz, 2021a; Zhang et al., 2021a; Liu et al., 2022). Compared
    to the suggested worldwide water availability baseline (1700 m3/person/year),
    the North China Plain (NCP) has significantly lower available water resources
    per person (910 m3/year), groundwater has significant importance in the agriculture
    and economy of NCP. The agricultural irrigation needs in NCP rely on groundwater
    more than 40 % (HRWCC, 2003–2020). With the recent rapid urbanization and agricultural
    expansion, issues resulting from excessive groundwater use, such as groundwater
    depletion, deterioration, and surface deformation, have become critical issues
    (Cai, 2008; Gong et al., 2018; Khorrami et al., 2023b; Amiri et al., 2023). For
    the assessment of changing climate and the sustainable usage of water resources,
    a precise understanding of the spatiotemporal aspects of water storage variation
    is essential (Rodell et al., 2007; Tapley et al., 2019). To provide crucial information
    for decision-makers and managers of water resources, groundwater has to be quantified
    and mapped. The lack of gauged stations makes it difficult to manage the dynamic
    changes in groundwater storage using in-situ data. Typically, water-level changes
    in monitoring wells and computed storage coefficients form the basis of in-situ
    assessments of groundwater storage variability. Our capacity to comprehensively
    characterize the regional groundwater fluctuations is hampered by the intrinsic
    constraints of in-situ observations, although they are the only source for verifying
    the auxiliary data (Abhishek and Kinouchi, 2021). Unreliable data formatting across
    mechanical and human monitoring wells, as well as the high expenses of installation
    and maintenance, are additional issues (Chen et al., 2016; Abhishek and Kinouchi,
    2021). Additionally, when converting the groundwater level to groundwater storage
    data, uncertainties associated with specific yield or specific storage arising
    from the aquifer features are inevitable (Bierkens, 2015). The most accurate method
    for calibrating and validating satellite and hydrological models'' data is to
    measure the in-situ water levels, which makes them a potential metric for applications
    such as water security. Particularly in places with limited measurable data, GRACE
    is a reliable tool to track variations in total water storage at large-scale,
    which includes ice, snow, surface water, soil moisture, and groundwater with an
    acceptable level of accuracy (Famiglietti, 2014; Ran et al., 2021; Yang et al.,
    2020). GRACE TWSA has offered a supplement to GWSA over large regions. To assess
    the depletion of groundwater conditions in the Mississippi River basin and India,
    Rodell et al., 2007, Rodell et al., 2009 extracted the GWSA variations based on
    GRACE data. GRACE has so far been extensively used for a variety of purposes,
    including groundwater assessment (Feng et al., 2013; Huang et al., 2015; Tangdamrongsub
    et al., 2018), immense flooding event estimation (Han et al., 2021a, Han et al.,
    2021b), reservoir influencing mass transportation (Ran et al., 2019), evapotranspiration
    estimation (Long et al., 2014), and exposure of land subsidence (Wang et al.,
    2017; Tangdamrongsub et al., 2019). The GWSA in the NCP has been the subject of
    other comparable investigations. Huang et al. (2015) found that shallow GWSA was
    declining more at the rate of 45.6 ± 6.8 mm/yr in comparison to deep GWSA (16.9
    ± 3 mm/yr) in the NCP from 2003 to 2013. GRACE data have also been used to access
    a trend of 38 ± 1 mm/yr increase in groundwater depletion between 2013 and 2016
    (Zhao et al., 2019). Vast North China was found to have a GWSA declining trend
    of 16.8 to 27.2 mm/yr (Moiwo et al., 2013; Feng et al., 2013; Wang et al., 2017).
    Furthermore, Tang et al. (2013) calculated depletion of groundwater ranged from
    14.0 to 8.4 mm/yr in North China from 2003 to 2011 while taking the effects of
    water diversion, reservoir regulation, and coal transport into account. The long-term
    (1971–2015) decreasing trend of GWSA 17.8 ± 0.1 mm/yr in the NCP was computed
    using GRACE and in-situ groundwater data (Gong et al., 2018). After combining
    GRACE mascon outputs from several datasets, Zhao et al. (2019) estimated that
    GWSA is decreasing at the rate of 38.0 ± 1 mm/yr in NCP from 2013 to 2016. Despite
    these outcomes, the application of this method to long-term hydrological changes
    is still constrained by various shortcomings such as missing months and the gap
    between GRACE and GRACE-FO (Sun et al., 2020; Li et al., 2020; Li et al., 2021b;
    Khorrami and Gunduz, 2021b). GRACE was decommissioned in June 2017; nevertheless,
    the GRACE-FO was launched in June 2018 and continues to provide TWSA data that
    is being used in investigations of oceanography, hydrology, and geology (Ciraci
    et al., 2020; Ghobadi et al., 2020). To fill in the data gap, machine learning
    models have been used to reconstruct missing TWSA data. For instance, support
    vector regression, artificial neural networks, and other innovative approaches
    have been applied (Mukherjee and Ramachandran, 2018; Zhang et al., 2021a). Data-driven
    approaches, GRACE solutions, and input variables were compared on a global scale,
    and the results showed that filling in the missing gap between GRACE and GRACE-FO
    data could offer continuous measurements of Earth''s gravitational field (Li et
    al., 2020; Sun et al., 2020). Approximately 3° × 3° GRACE Level-2 data were gridded
    to produce the 1° resolution GRACE Level-3 products consisting of 3-spherical
    harmonic and 2-mascon products at a resolution of 0.5° and 0.25° (Watkins et al.,
    2015; Wiese et al., 2016). Since mascon solutions from the University of Texas
    Centre for Space Research (CSR) have been proven to be more accurate (Zheng et
    al., 2020; Wang et al., 2023), we choose to employ them in our analysis. GRACE
    mascon products remain too coarse to assess groundwater depletion at the local
    scale, despite the spatial resolution of Level-3 solutions being improved (Śliwińska
    et al., 2021; Ali et al., 2022a). Improved physical information can be retrieved
    from downscaling GRACE mascon solutions data to a precise spatial resolution for
    local scale application (Vishwakarma et al., 2021; Ali et al., 2021). GRACE observations
    can be downscaled using either a dynamical methodology or a statistical approach.
    The dynamical downscaling, which integrates observations of GRACE and simulated
    estimates of water storage from hydrological models, is also known as data assimilation
    (DA) (Tangdamrongsub et al., 2015). Zhong et al. (2020a) observed that the main
    disadvantage of DA is its high computational cost and reliance on the hydrological
    model''s uncertain boundary conditions. The downscaling of GRACE data using the
    statistical method can be taken as a substitute; the spatial resolution improvement
    of GRACE data is shown in recent studies based on the statistical approach (Milewski
    et al., 2019; Sahour et al., 2020; Vishwakarma et al., 2021; Ali et al., 2021;
    Ali et al., 2022b; Ali et al., 2023). Based on the strong association between
    evapotranspiration and GRACE GWSA over the NCP a downscaling method was developed
    (Yin et al., 2018), successfully improving the resolution to 0.02° from 1°. The
    outcome showed that the downscaling of GWSA estimates to 0.25° from 1° based on
    the random forest model has considerable potential (Chen et al., 2019). To increase
    the resolution of GRACE data to 0.25°, Yin et al. (2022b) used three different
    downscaling models: random forest, Noah V2.1, and multivariable linear regression
    model. The outcomes of the downscaling, however, abruptly changed across adjacent
    pixels (Yin et al., 2018; Yin et al., 2022b; Ali et al., 2021, Ali et al., 2022b,
    Ali et al., 2023). The applicability in local water resource management was constrained
    by the systematic impacts of downscaled data and coarser spatial resolution. Furthermore,
    Zhang et al. (2021b) used the random forest and extreme gradient boosting methods
    to estimate GWSA over China, producing datasets at high resolution (1 km) from
    2003 to 2016. The primary shortcoming of this study, though, is the question of
    whether models for downscaling established at the country level can be applied
    to small regions arbitrarily. The inability of the produced products to catch
    monthly variations, such as flood and drought occurrences, severely restricts
    their use in hydrological research because the temporal resolution of downscaled
    results is annual. Using GRACE data, the aforementioned studies have identified
    the variations in groundwater storage during the past few decades in the NCP.
    However, considering the missing gap between GRACE and GRACE-FO data, systematic
    groundwater variability detection has not yet been achieved for the downscaling
    of the GRACE data perspective. Therefore, the novelty resides in this study to
    integrate filling in the missing intermittent months (GRACE) and missing gap data
    between GRACE and GRACE-FO using modified STL at first and then regression GWR
    model-based regional downscaling of continuous GWSA data was performed. The strength
    of the GWR model regional-scale downscaling scheme was comprehensively evaluated
    to improve the resolution of GRACE-based GWSA to 0.05° between 2003 and 2022.
    The accuracy of regional downscaled GWSA was assessed using in-situ groundwater
    level data for independent validation. The regional downscaling approach was carried
    out in the NCP, one of the primary bases producing grains in Northern China. 2.
    Study area The NCP, which is the area of interest in this study, is the 140,000
    km2 area north of the Yellow River, south of the Yan Mountains, and east of the
    Taihang Mountains (Fig. 1). Since the 1970s, groundwater has been heavily utilized
    to fulfill water supply for industrial, agricultural, and urban purposes. The
    primary source of groundwater recharge, which accounts for 60 % to 90 % of the
    overall recharge with the majority of it occurring in summer, is precipitation
    infiltration (Liu et al., 2022). More than 80 % of the entire groundwater was
    used for agricultural irrigation in the region, although the average annual precipitation
    in the region is 400–500 mm (Zhang et al., 2019). The NCP has seen the most severe
    groundwater depletion as a result of the seasonal distribution of precipitation
    being irregular and the high-water demand. The NCP, China''s most significant
    agricultural region, provides roughly 61 % and 31 % of the country''s total production
    of maize and wheat, respectively (Cao et al., 2016). Download : Download high-res

    pixel at 0.05° estimated using MODIS data (https://modis.gsfc.nasa.gov/data/dataprod/mod10.php).
    The groundwater levels in the NCP are monitored via a network of 558 unconfined
    wells. To determine the amount of groundwater stored in the unconfined aquifer,
    the detected dynamics are multiplied by the specific yield (Sy) (Fig. 1a). The
    Sy has a range from 0.025 to 0.29 (Gong et al., 2018; Zhang et al., 2020). Based
    on unsteady-flow pumping studies, the uncertainty associated with groundwater
    storage brought on by the range of aquifer geometry and physical hydrogeological
    features, a Sy is estimated to have a 20 % inaccuracy (Huang et al., 2015; Pan
    et al., 2017; Gong et al., 2018). Due to the excessive water demand from industry,
    agriculture, and livestock over many years, the NCP has seen serious groundwater
    depletion (Feng et al., 2013; Huang et al., 2015; Gong et al., 2018; Zhao et al.,
    2019). 3. Material and methods 3.1. Input datasets We employed a variety of data

    3.2. Datasets 3.2.1. TWSA derived from GRACE The GRACE mission, launched by the
    National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) and German Aerospace Centre
    (DLR), consists of two satellites that monitor Earth''s gravity properties to
    look into water resources (Rodell et al., 2007; Khorrami and Gunduz, 2021a; Khorrami
    et al., 2023c). An important dynamic component of the hydrologic cycle is the
    terrestrial water storage anomaly (TWSA). Groundwater, soil moisture, rivers,
    lakes, snowpack, glaciers, and canopy water are all included in the vertically
    accumulated amount of water storage of various elements of the hydrologic cycle
    (Pan et al., 2017; Humphrey et al., 2023). In this investigation, the GRACE RL06
    Gridded CSR mascon solution with enhanced coastlines at a resolution of 0.25°
    product was used from 2003 to 2022 (Save et al., 2016; Sun et al., 2018; Yang
    et al., 2021). The uncertainties associated with CSR mascon solutions were estimated
    to be lower than other mascon products (Zheng et al., 2020; Wang et al., 2023).
    In our earlier study, the modified STL approach was used to fill in the missing
    data of GRACE and the gap between GRACE and GRACE-FO only at the temporal scale
    (Khorrami et al., 2023a). In this study, the modified STL approach was also used
    to fill in the gaps between GRACE and GRACE-FO measurements and the missing months
    within GRACE at the temporal scale (Fig. S1) and each pixel''s scale level. 3.2.2.
    Water storage components To yield the best estimates of land surface fluxes, the
    GLDAS can benefit from ground-based- and satellite measurements and sophisticated
    land surface modeling (Rodell et al., 2004). The monthly water storage components
    such as soil moisture storage (SMS) and snow water equivalent (SWE) are derived
    from Noah-v2.1 at a 0.25° resolution. To disaggregate GWSA from GRACE-derived
    TWSA estimations, the SMS and SWE were converted to anomaly data similar to the
    GRACE data baseline (2004–2009). The goodness of match that the Noah-v2.1 products
    displayed to GRACE TWSA were superior to the other three models (i.e., CLM, Mosaic,
    and VIC) (Wang et al., 2023). In light of this, the GLDAS Noah-v2.1 model data
    from 2003 to 2022 were applied in this analysis. TWS data was derived from the
    Community Land Surface Model (CLSM) which is simulated GLDAS. Soil water up to
    a depth of 100 cm, snow water equivalent, water in the canopy, and shallow groundwater
    from 5 to 8 m deep in the aquifer all contribute to the CLSM-modeled TWS (Li et
    al., 2019). Note that CLSM TWS does not account for water stored on the surface
    in places like lakes, reservoirs, and rivers. Due to the negligible contribution
    of surface water storage to total water storage in arid NCP (0.28 mm/a during
    2003–2010; Feng et al., 2013), biases in the calculations of GWSA produced by
    such impacts can be ignored. To validate STL-based filled-in missing months of
    GRACE TWSA data, CLSM TWSA was produced by subtracting the long-term baseline
    mean between 2004 and 2009 from the corresponding CLSM TWS data. 3.2.3. Environmental
    forcing variables Environmental factors such as SMS, precipitation (P), actual
    evapotranspiration (ETa), land surface temperature (LST), and normalized difference
    vegetation index (NDVI) were utilized as independent variables for downscaling
    GRACE data. These auxiliary datasets were selected based on their major contribution
    to GRACE data which was analyzed in a previous study (Yin et al., 2022). Fig.
    S2 displays the analysis of these variables in terms of temporal time series.
    The monthly scale and 0.05° resolution of MOD13C2 Version 6 were used to obtain
    the NDVI data. The MODIS MOD11C3 at a resolution of 0.05° provided the monthly
    LST measurements. The values from the respective monthly files are averaged to
    yield the daytime and nighttime observations that comprise the LST products (Wang
    et al., 2021). The operational simplified surface energy balance (SSEBop) model,
    which is used to calculate monthly MODIS ETa, was received from the USGS FEWS
    NET Data Portal (Senay et al., 2007). From Climate Hazards Group InfraRed Precipitation
    with Station (CHIRPS), 0.05° resolution gridded precipitation data were obtained.
    3.2.4. Ground-based measurements From January 2005 to December 2018, the Beijing
    Water Resources Bulletin of China published monthly measurements of groundwater
    levels were taken to verify the validation of the downscaled GWSA estimations.
    The datasets are subject to a restricted quality control approach, and a recent
    study (Zhang et al., 2020) has verified their dependability. According to Fig.
    1, the observation wells in the NCP were distributed equally. It is important
    to highlight that during the preprocessing stage, a few wells'' observations with
    unusual jumps and outliers were removed. When calculating the groundwater level
    anomalies (GWLA) for specific bores, the monthly readings were subtracted from
    the long-term mean between 2005 and 2018 to obtain the GWLA. The observed GWSA
    was determined by multiplying the GWLA by the specific yield (Sy). After that,
    the average changes in groundwater storage from 2005 to 2018 were subtracted to
    generate the GWSA of each well monthly. 4. Methods We used four distinct methodologies:
    (1) using the modified STL method, we filled in missing months within GRACE and
    the gap between GRACE and GRACE-FO observations in both space and time before
    estimating the GWSA; (2) estimating the continuous GWSA using the modified STL-based
    imputed TWSA; (3) input the environmental variables and GRACE-derived GWSA data
    into the GWR model; (4) obtaining the intercepts, residuals, and regression coefficients
    from GWR model. The four statistical indicators of root mean square error (RMSE),
    Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency (NSE), correlation coefficient (CC), and bias were used
    to validate the GWR-predicted GWSA data with GRACE-derived GWSA. Sen''s slope
    trend analysis was used to analyze the temporal variations of the downscaled GWSA
    data, respectively. To calculate the groundwater depletion in the various cities
    of the NCP, we employed the estimated downscaled GWSA fluctuations. 4.1. Gap filling
    of GRACE TWSA based on STL Intermittent missing months in GRACE and a continuous
    gap of 11 months between the GRACE and GRACE-FO prevent improved monitoring of
    water resources (Gong et al., 2018; Ali et al., 2021, Ali et al., 2022b, Ali et
    al., 2023; Yi and Sneeuw, 2021; Yin et al., 2022a, Yin et al., 2022b; Wang et
    al., 2023). Therefore, it is essential to complete the missing months in the data
    to accurately estimate the components of the hydrological cycle before downscaling
    GWSA. So far, different techniques such as Multilinear Regression Models, and
    different AI-based algorithms have been proposed and successfully applied to fill
    in the data gaps of the GRACE/GRACE-FO. However, since the used techniques mainly
    consider climatic variables, their optimal use is an issue of doubt because they
    may not model the exact variations of the GRACE-TWSA which is controlled not only
    by the climatic forces but also by anthropogenic drivers (Jing et al., 2020).
    The STL is a filtering method for decomposing time-series datasets. It is both
    simple and robust at the same time. The STL''s simplicity makes it possible to
    quickly compute and analyze time series data (Cleveland et al., 1990). The STL-based
    approach is a simple technique to fill in the existing gaps of the global TWSA
    values and since it is based on decomposing the TWSA time series into its components,
    it is hypothesized that the reconstructed TWSA values could better represent and
    characterize the real GRACE-observed TWSA characteristics through reflecting both
    the natural and anthropogenic impacts. Between 2003 and 2022, there were 31 missing
    months in total (Fig. S1a). The TWSA data reveals both long-term and seasonal
    patterns. Using these characteristics of TWSA, the modified STL method was applied
    to fill in the gaps in the GRACE and GRACE-FO datasets. The R programming environment
    is used to develop a modified STL model for completing the spatial and temporal
    gaps in the GRACE and GRACE-FO data. Eq. (1) demonstrates how the trend, seasonal,
    and residual components of the data were decomposed by the STL model. (1) where
    , , and at time t are, respectively, the trend, seasonal, and remainder components
    (Cleveland et al., 1990). The average seasonal and residual values along with
    the trend component of that missing month were added to compute the missing month''s
    values after the decomposition of TWSA. The modified STL model can be written
    as Eq. (2): (2) 4.2. Continuous groundwater storage anomaly estimation Snow, glaciers,
    surface water, soil moisture, and groundwater all contribute to the total water
    storage. We ignore the variation in surface water storage because around 40 %
    of the rivers in NCP are perennially dry (Wang et al., 2018; Gong et al., 2018;
    Zhang et al., 2021b). The main reservoirs have an estimated 2.47 billion m3 of
    water, or around 1.7 cm of equivalent thickness, according to statistics from
    the China Water Resources Bulletin (Yin et al., 2022). Water reserves in reservoirs
    can be disregarded in comparison to groundwater storage (Xiong et al., 2022).
    The GWSA is calculated by deducting the SMSA and SWEA from the TWSA on the basis
    that other water storage component''s contributions to the NCP are insignificant
    (Yin et al., 2017; Feng et al., 2018; Gong et al., 2018; Xu et al., 2021). The
    changes in GWSA in the study area were derived using Eqs. (3), (4). (3) (4) where
    SMSA and SWEA are anomalies of soil moisture storage and snow water equivalent.
    4.3. Geographically weighted regression model Brunsdon et al. (1996) first introduced
    the GWR as a regression model. It has been widely employed in research on the
    scale dynamic relationships between dependent and explanatory factors (Foody,
    2003). The GWR model can be written as: (5) ɛ where , , , and ɛ are, respectively,
    the latitude and longitude of the locations, intercept, slope (regression coefficient),
    residual at the j th point, and p specifies the number of environmental variables.
    According to Fotheringham et al. (2002), the difference between the GRACE-derived
    and GWR model predicted values is residual, the estimation of the local constant
    term is the intercept, and the computation of the local coefficient for each variable
    is slope; yi denotes the i th observation of the dependent variable and Xi,j denotes
    the j th observation of i th independent variable. A fundamental idea of the GWR
    model is that observations nearer to the j th point have a greater influence on
    the local coefficient for the location, which functions as a distance decay based
    on the distances between the j th point and its surrounding points. As shown below,
    the coefficient can be determined as below: (6) where denotes the local coefficient
    to be estimated at the location ; X and Y represent the vectors of the independent
    variables and the dependent variables, respectively; and is the weight matrix
    (Gao et al., 2012). The higher the weight, the closer the j th point is to its
    neighboring points. The weights can be calculated as follows (Lu et al., 2019;
    Arshad et al., 2021; Arshad et al., 2022): (7) where, = estimation of coefficient
    at the i th location using the weight of observation at the j th point. = distance
    (Euclidean) between the i th and j th points. = adaptive bandwidth size determined
    by the k th nearest neighbor distance. The selection criterion (Cross-Validation
    (CV), Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC), Akaike Information Criterion (AIC),
    and small sample bias adjusted AIC (AICc)) and kernel function (fixed bi-square,
    fixed Gaussian, adaptive bi-square, and adaptive Gaussian) are the two most important
    variables in GWR model. weight matrix in Eq. (6) is estimated using the “kernel
    function”. The ‘selection criterion is used to calculate the adaptive bandwidth''s
    size which is represented by the symbol in Eq. (7). In this work, the Adaptive
    Gaussian and Cross-Validation were employed as kernel function and selection criterion.
    As a result of these characteristics, the GWR model can be established with high
    accuracy (Xu et al., 2015). 4.3.1. Regional downscaling technique based on the
    GWR model Previous downscaling studies, such as 0.1° (Shang et al., 2019) and
    0.25° (Chen et al., 2019; Zhang et al., 2021ab; Xiong et al., 2022), have a target
    resolution that is too coarse to meet the needs of water resources management
    in local areas. Based on the constructed regression model, we substitute 0.05°
    predictors to obtain the GWSA at a higher resolution in this research. To produce
    the GWSA at 0.05° resolution, we enhanced the regional downscaling model with
    extensive environmental variables. The developed GWR model at a coarse resolution
    can be utilized to anticipate high-resolution GWSA using environmental variables
    with high resolution (Xu et al., 2015). Fig. 2 depicts the information about the
    downscaling procedure. The following is a list of the specific steps of the GWSA
    downscaling method based on GWR: Download : Download high-res image (765KB) Download

    from 0.25° to 0.05° process flowchart for the NCP region. (1) Data preparation:
    It includes the preparation of GWSA data, environmental variables at 0.25°, and
    environmental variables at 0.05° resolution. The environmental variables include
    P, SMS, NDVI, LST, and ET. (2) GWR model: The GWR model is developed using environmental
    variables and GRACE-derived GWSA at a coarse resolution of 0.25°. The output of
    the GWR model is the intercept, slope (regression coefficients), and regression
    residual. In this work, the GWR model is developed in R programming. (3) Interpolating
    the parameters: The bilinear approach is used to interpolate the intercept, slope
    (regression coefficients), and regression residual from step (2) to generate the
    data at 0.05°. (4) Downscaling: To obtain the model residuals ( ɛ ), the GWR model
    predicted GWSA was subtracted from the GRACE-derived GWSA in step (2). Following
    that, these residuals were bilinearly interpolated to a 0.05° resolution. Using
    high-resolution environmental variables, slope (regression coefficients), and
    regression residuals at 0.05° resolution, downscaled GWSA (0.05°) were derived
    using Eq. (5). (5) The random forest (RF) model''s variable importance (VIMP)
    test was used to determine the parameters and significance of various environmental
    variables in the study area (Rahaman et al., 2019; Ali et al., 2021; Ali et al.,
    2022b). VIMP values near 0 show a variable''s minimal influence, while higher
    values show a variable''s larger significance in explaining variations in water
    storage. 4.4. Uncertainty analysis The input variables to the GWR model (NDVI,
    LST, ET, P, and SMS) are related to uncertainty in the downscaled GWSA. By multiplying
    each input variable''s coefficient value (β) by the sample standard error derived
    from the standard deviation (σ) (Duan and Li, 2016), the uncertainty related to
    each input variable was calculated. Utilizing the propagation of errors by linearization
    method (Faber, 2002; Duan and Li, 2016; Seyoum et al., 2019), the overall uncertainty
    associated with GWR-based downscaled GWSA ( ) was calculated as follows: (8) The
    GWR model-based coefficient value (β) was calculated using (Eq. (6)). 4.5. Statistical
    measurements Over the period 2003–2022, the monthly GWSA estimations derived from
    GRACE are compared with GWR-based predicted GWSA. The accuracy of the predicted
    GWSA estimates is evaluated using correlation coefficient (CC), bias (B), Nash
    Sutcliffe efficiency (NSE), and root mean square error (RMSE) are the four statistical
    measures chosen for validation (Ali et al., 2021, Ali et al., 2022b, Ali et al.,
    2023; Khorrami et al., 2023a). The perfect value of CC and NSE ranges from 0 to
    1. With a perfect value of 0, B indicates how much predicted GWSA estimates are
    exaggerated (positive) or underestimated (negative). The term “RMSE” refers to
    the size of error estimates; the lower the RMSE, the more accurate the predicted
    GWSA estimates are in comparison to GRACE-derived GWSA. The formulas are as follows:
    (9) (10) (11) (12) where o and y show GRACE-derived and GWR-based GWSA, the length
    of the time series is n, and are the mean values of y and o. 4.6. Sen''s slope
    estimator Sen (1968) developed the Sen''s slope estimator method as a non-parametric
    test to approximate the trend slope. In numerous studies (Yue and Hashino, 2003;
    Gocic and Trajkovic, 2013; Mohsin and Lone, 2021) it has been extensively used
    for trend analysis of a range of hydrometeorological variables. The Sen''s Slope
    estimator performs the following phases in its computation process: (13) where,
    and represent the data values at times j and k (j > k) respectively (Gocic and
    Trajkovic, 2013). The Sen''s slope is calculated as the median of the slope: (14)
    The calculated controls the reflection and the gradient of the current trend through
    its value and sign (Gocic and Trajkovic, 2013). The magnitude of the trend is
    estimated using Sen''s slope method. 5. Results 5.1. Reconstruction of GRACE TWSA
    Together, the TWSA data for GRACE and GRACE-FO have 31 missing months. The decomposition
    components of the GRACE TWSA dataset for the NCP basin are shown in Fig. S3. Several
    methods have been put forth for reconstructing the GRACE TWSA values. Seasonality
    is a common feature of the global TWSA changes, and the seasonal changes of the
    GRACE-observed TWSA were utilized to fill in the missing observations based on
    the modified STL method which were then verified by the values obtained in the
    CLSM dataset. The CLSM is currently the only global model that generates hydrological
    fluxes using the GRACE estimates as part of its advanced data assimilation process
    (Khorrami et al., 2023a, Khorrami et al., 2023b, Khorrami et al., 2023c). In comparison
    to other methods, the primary advantage of the novel approach to filling in missing
    observations based on the modified STL technique is its capacity to more simply
    and conveniently provide correct estimates of the GRACE missing TWSA observation.
    The missing months of the GRACE TWSA were filled in at a temporal (Fig. 3a) and
    spatial scale for each pixel (Fig. 3b) which led to better estimations of hydrological
    components. Download : Download high-res image (1MB) Download : Download full-size
    image Fig. 3. (a) modified STL-based filled-in temporal time series and (b) modified
    STL-based gap-filling between GRACE and GRACE-FO at the pixels level. As a result,
    better estimates of the hydrological components were produced based on spatiotemporally
    downscaled and gap-less TWSA values (Kumar et al., 2016). As a result, the TWSA
    findings from the STL technique were compared to the TWSA over the NCP derived
    from the CLSM. Fig. 3a shows the TWSA time series of the suggested method along
    with the missing values obtained from the GRACE-derived, CLSM-derived, and STL-derived
    values. The STL-based and CLSM-derived TWSA have a 0.93 correlation. The findings
    show that the employed STL approach can successfully reconstruct the GRACE mission''s
    missing TWSA values. As indicated in Fig. 3a, the TWSA time series show a remarkable
    decreasing trend for the whole NCP at the rate of 13.30 ± 8.20 mm/yr, 14.75 +
    7.67 mm/yr, and 13.33 + 4.85 mm/yr with missing months, without missing months,
    and CLSM. Similar results were found in previous studies that GRACE-derived TWSA
    was observed to be declining with a trend of 11 mm/yr from August 2002 to August
    2010 (Su et al., 2011), 12.4–15 mm/yr from 2003 to 2011 (Tang et al., 2013), 16.8
    mm/yr from 2003 to 2009 (Moiwo et al., 2013), 12.9 mm/yr from April 2002 to March
    2016 (Rodell et al., 2018), and 17.95 mm/yr from 2003 to 2017 (Xu et al., 2021).
    5.2. Temporal variations characteristics of TWSA and gap-filling effect In comparison
    to the other GRACE solutions, the mascon solutions often exhibit significantly
    smaller amplitude variations (i.e., maximum and minimum TWSA) (Xiong et al., 2022;
    Yin et al., 2022a). It can be observed from Fig. 4 that TWSA sharply increases
    at a rate of 3.00 mm/yr from 2003 to 2004 with a maximum storage of TWSA (134.42
    mm/month in August 2004), however, due to extensive groundwater extraction, TWSA
    abruptly declined with a rate of 6.79 mm/yr from 2005 to 2009 with depletion value
    of TWSA 110.95 mm/month in October 2009); however, a notable recharge between
    2010 and 2013 was observed and TWSA values reached to 27.86 mm/month (August 2012)
    as a result of an increase in precipitation. TWSA was observed to stabilize during
    2010–2013 with a moderate declining trend of 1.79 mm/yr (Huang et al., 2015).
    The TWSA was subsequently depleted between 2014 and 2015 because of severe drought
    (Zhao et al., 2019) with a maximum depletion of TWSA ( 277.25 mm/month). From
    2016 to 2018, the stabilizing TWSA was detected with a general declining trend
    of 0.92 mm/month after the South-to-North Water Diversion Project (SNWDP) implementation
    along with precipitation. Thereafter, there was a further decline until mid of
    year 2021, after which there was another sharp recharge observed of TWSA with
    an increasing trend of 0.98 mm/yr due to an increase in precipitation up to the
    year 2022 (Fig. 4). Moreover, the modified STL approach successfully filled in
    the missing gap between GRACE and GRACE-FO TWSA values (Fig. 3a). It can be observed
    (Fig. 4) that TWSA is decreasing during this missing gap between GRACE and GRACE-FO
    following the trends of effective precipitation and anomalies of SMS and SWE.

    Fig. 4. Time series of TWSA, GWSA, water storage anomalies, and precipitation
    from 2003 to 2022 in the NCP region. The red dotted box shows fill-in missing
    gap between GRACE and GRACE-FO using the modified STL method. Additionally, to
    calculate the GWSA, the SMSA and SWEA contributions were subtracted from TWSA
    (Fig. 4) because SMSA and SWEA are the major factors influencing TWSA in the NCP
    (Yin et al., 2022a; Yin et al., 2022b). Similar to TWSA, the GWSA (Fig. 4) showed
    a sharp decrease and subsequent increase, indicating a significant loss of groundwater
    in the region. While there are some changes in amplitude, the temporal distribution
    of GWSA trends and TWSA trends with CC up to 0.88 is similar. It suggests that
    GWSA is mostly responsible for the inter-annual trends in TWSA, which is consistent
    with findings from earlier studies (Rodell et al., 2018; Yin et al., 2020; Xu
    et al., 2021; Yin et al., 2022). The main cause of this phenomenon is that climate
    change and intensive irrigation for agriculture place a significant amount of
    pressure on water supplies (Yin et al., 2022). Due to the lower requirement for
    irrigation in fall and winter, groundwater is primarily extracted for agricultural
    use in late spring and summer while remaining in aquifers until the next spring
    (Liu et al., 2022). For instance, from 2003 to 2012, Hebei province was found
    to have the highest annual average use of groundwater within the NCP at 15.64
    km3, followed by Henan province (2.54 km3) (WRPB, 2012). A following decreasing
    GWSA, however, was discovered from 2018 to the middle of 2021, which may have
    been brought on by a rise in groundwater depletion and a decline in precipitation.
    For instance, the year 2019 had the lowest annual precipitation of the previous
    years, at 532 mm (11.5 % decline from the long-term mean of 601 mm). This might
    reduce the net recharging of the aquifer and increase groundwater pumping due
    to the limited surface water availability. Precipitation, GRACE, and GLDAS (SMSA
    and SWEA) data for the period 2003–2022 generally show apparent stability and
    seasonal variation. Through complex hydrological processes such as surface runoff,
    evapotranspiration, and infiltration, precipitation must be redistributed before
    transforming into terrestrial water storage. As a result, there were periods in
    which the variations in precipitation and GRACE were not very consistent. According
    to Hocking and Kelly (2016) and Rossman et al. (2014), there is a lag in groundwater
    recharging. According to Liu et al. (2022), who examined changes in GWSA with
    precipitation 1–3 months lag, GWSA recharging in the NCP is more significantly
    influenced by and responds to precipitations more quickly. It is worth noting
    that the maximum monthly average precipitation of 235.03 mm, 261.65 mm, 243.75
    mm, 296.82 mm, 350.73 mm, and 230.72 mm occurred in 2010, 2012, 2013, 2016, 2021,
    and 2022 with average GRACE monthly values (−72.36 mm, −105 mm, −51.90 mm, −213.54
    mm, −268.25 mm, and − 76.64 mm) in these years. The comparison results of GRACE,
    GLDAS (SMSA and SWEA), and precipitation data showed that they presented regular
    seasonal fluctuations with consistencies. Rapid population growth and the expansion
    of irrigated agriculture have increased the pressure on the sustainability of
    groundwater storage. Overuse of groundwater is anticipated to increase when local
    surface water supplies become inadequate to meet rising demand. The rising water
    demand will inevitably have an impact on groundwater overexploitation in the region.
    Koch et al. (2020) estimated average annual net irrigation of 126 mm/yr (15.2
    km3/yr) for NCP and annual winter wheat classifications reveal an increasing crop
    area with a trend of 2200 km2/yr. the NCP confronts significant issues in the
    management of water supplies, especially groundwater reserves, due to its status
    as a vital producing and living area in China. 5.3. Downscaling of continuous
    GWSA To predict the GWSA, all spatial independent and dependent variables at a
    coarse resolution of 0.25° were incorporated into the GWR model. The GWR model
    predicted GWSA was compared to GRACE-derived GWSA. To assess the spatial distribution
    differences between GRACE-derived and GWR-based GWSA maps are compared for March
    2020. The particular month was chosen to observe the fluctuations in GWSA and
    because of the significant GWSA depletion in that month. The model-based approach
    under- and over-estimated the GWSA with biases of 1.60 % and 2.50 %, respectively,
    while CC ranged between 0.93 and 0.96, according to a statistical analysis of
    GWR model predicted and GRACE-derived GWSA (Fig. S4) from 2003 to 2022. The spatial
    distribution of the GWR model predicted GWSA substantially resembles the GRACE-derived
    GWSA, with small under/overestimations according to pixel-wise evaluation (Fig.
    5b). With local R2 values ranging from 0.63 to 0.85, the GWR model performed effectively
    on the majority of pixels (Fig. 5c). Fig. 5d displays the residuals map, which
    represents the amount of GWSA that the model is unable to account for and is noisy
    in terms of under- and over-estimation in model prediction. When comparing the
    model-based GWSA (Fig. 5b) to the GRACE-derived GWSA (Fig. 5a), the largest under-
    and overestimations reported were 95 mm/month and 181 mm/month (Fig. 5d). To get
    the high-resolution GWSA estimates, intercept and regression coefficients at a
    resolution of 0.25° from the GWR model output were further interpolated to 0.05°
    using the bilinear interpolation method in R programming. Eq. (5) was applied
    to the interpolated intercept and regression coefficients along with environmental
    variables to estimate the GWSA at 0.05° (Fig. 5e). Residual corrections minimize
    the bias, or over- or under-estimation, in the results of downscaling. The GWR
    model interpolated regression residuals and estimated GWSA at a resolution of
    0.05° are combined to perform residuals correction to compute GWR model-based
    downscaled GWSA at a resolution of 0.05° (Fig. 5f). The GWR model generated good
    results with high local R2 values and minimum residuals given the current arrangement
    of environmental variables, demonstrating its ability to forecast high-resolution
    GWSA in the research area. Because downscaled and GRACE-derived GWSA show similar
    spatial patterns, the spatial pattern is conserved while the downscaling approach
    improves spatial information of GRACE data at coarse resolution. Download : Download

    GWSA at 0.05° without residuals correction, and (f) downscaled GWSA after residual
    correction at 0.05°. To produce high-resolution (0.05°) GWSA data for the NCP,
    GWR performance is examined for various months between 2003 and 2022. Fig. S5
    contrasts the spatial distribution of monthly GWSA estimations derived from GWR-based
    downscaled and GRACE-derived for multiple selected months from 2003 to 2022. When
    compared to GRACE-derived estimations, it was found that downscaled GWSA estimates
    showed very similar spatial patterns of GWSA values. This showed that the downscaling
    method using the most recent high-resolution explanatory factors not only translated
    GWSA with improved information but also preserved the spatial pattern of GWSA.
    The downscaled GWSA using the GWR model has some uncertainty due to several sources
    of errors (such as input variables). Downscaled GWSA had an overall uncertainty
    of 14.39 mm, with particular uncertainties of 4.28 mm for SMS, 2.57 mm for rainfall,
    1.62 mm for ETa, 0.50 mm for LST, and 3.16 for NDVI respectively. The capability
    of the model to estimate high-resolution GWSA changes is greatly influenced by
    the environmental variables that determine trending fluctuations in water storage
    variations (Ali et al., 2021; Ali et al., 2022b; Ali et al., 2023). The VIMP test
    revealed that the complex hydroclimatic and topographical aspects of the research
    region affected the geographical variation in the relevance of environmental variables
    (Fig. S6). For instance, it was discovered that NDVI, with a VIMP value of 49.80
    %, was more significant in model prediction than precipitation (20.30 %) and SMS
    (20.00 %). To better show the features of the downscaled results, we compared
    the GWSA produced at 0.25° grid with one at 0.05° spatial resolution. The downscaled
    GWSA was consistent with the GRACE-derived 0.25° grid. Fig. 6 displays the geographical
    variations in March 2007 GWSA fluctuations between GRACE-derived and GWR-downscaled
    values. High-resolution GWSA measurements along the transects reveal the GWSA''s
    spatial fluctuations, which are hidden in the coarse resolution of GRACE data.
    Each of the three transects (P1-P2, P3-P4, and P5-P6) covers 6, 4, and 2 pixels
    of the GRACE-derived GWSA data (Fig. 6a) and 30, 20, and 10 pixels of the downscaled
    GWSA data (Fig. 6b). High-resolution GWSA data is especially helpful for small
    regions where it is difficult to detect spatial distribution fluctuations. The
    downscaled data, for instance, reveal a large regional spatial variability in
    the GWSA fluctuations (56.51 to 84.68 mm EWH) in transect P1-P2 (Fig. 6d), whereas
    the GRACE-derived GWSA is represented by homogenized pixels (Fig. 6c). This means
    that the downscaling results are consistent with the GRACE-derived values and
    also display finer regional heterogeneity. Download : Download high-res image

    and (c, d) shows temporal variations of GWSA at a resolution of 0.25° and 0.05°
    in different transects. The comparison of monthly GWR model-based downscaled and
    GRACE-derived GWSA variations over the NCP is shown in Fig. 7a. Similar variations
    in amplitudes may be seen in the time series of the coarse GRACE-derived and downscaled
    GWSA data, and both time series are consistent pre- and post-downscaling (Fig.
    7a), demonstrating the suitability of the regional downscaling technique to estimate
    GWSA changes at a high resolution. Between 2003 and 2022, the downscaled GWSA
    in the NCP generally decreased by 17.51 ± 7.25 mm/yr, and the GRACE-derived GWSA
    decreased by 17.55 ± 7.19 mm/yr (Fig. 7a). Other studies using GRACE observations
    have also noted GWSA decline over a variety of periods, ranging from 16.6 to 19.1
    mm/year from 2003 to 2020 (Liu et al., 2022; Xiong et al., 2022; Gong et al.,
    2018; Zhang et al., 2021a, Zhang et al., 2021b). Download : Download high-res

    and downscaled GWSA variations over the NCP from 2003 to 2022. The different shades
    of colors show sub-periods (I) increasing, (II) decreasing, (III) stabilizing,
    (IV) sharp decreasing, and (V) increasing trends of GWSA and (b) spatial distribution
    of GWSA in different sub-periods. Since GWSA fluctuations during the whole study
    period (2003–2022) were not consistent, the study duration was split into five
    distinct sub-periods (January 2003 to April 2007 (I), May 2007 to December 2014
    (II), January 2015 to December 2018 (III), January 2019 to May 2021 (IV), and
    June 2021 to December 2022 (V)) to explore variations of the GWSA in more detail.
    The sub-periods are shown in different colors in Fig. 7a. The GWSA was increasing
    at the rate of 2.98 mm/yr in sub-period I, a decreasing trend of 8.45 mm/yr was
    observed in sub-period II, followed by 3.90 mm/yr in sub-period III and 3.97 mm/yr
    in sub-period IV. Among them, the rate of GWSA is recovered in sub-period V with
    a rate of 3.08 mm/yr. Despite the initial recovery in groundwater levels following
    the initiation of the South-to-North Water Diversion Project (SNWDP) from 2015
    to 2018, further investigations have revealed negative trends in GWSA throughout
    period III. This can be attributed to the significant and persistent depletion
    of deep groundwater resources, exacerbated by inadequate precipitation, as documented
    by Li et al., 2021a, Li et al., 2021b and Xiong et al. (2022). According to a
    subsequent study (Guo et al., 2022), which similarly shows substantial growth
    in the deep groundwater funnel area from 2014 to 2020, similar behavior has been
    seen. The implementation of the SNWDP in 2014 enabled a shift from the previous
    water utilization approach to a conjunctive use of surface water and groundwater.
    However, the declining groundwater storage during period III indicates an increased
    water demand in arid conditions that cannot be adequately met solely through surface
    water sources such as diverted water and precipitation. Furthermore, it should
    be noted that the process of recovering from overexploitation, as observed in
    previous decades (Chen et al., 2005), is a gradual one. This is particularly evident
    when considering the increased extraction of groundwater and the subsequent decrease
    in net recharge due to the effects of a dry climate, as exemplified by the years
    2019 and 2020. The spatial distribution of GWSA was also analyzed during different
    sub-periods between 2003 and 2022. In sub-period I, surpluses were observed overall
    in the NCP. Minor deficits were starting to be experienced in the southwest region
    of NCP (sub-period I). However, sub-periods (III and IV) showed serious losses
    in GWSA over the cities to the southwest region of NCP. The GWSA losses were reduced
    through recharging by precipitation impact observed in sub-period V (Fig. 7b).
    Additionally, there have been observed small upward trends in GWSA around Beijing
    and Tianjin, the primary cities that receive diverted water from the SNWDP. Feng
    et al. (2013) observed a spatial pattern in groundwater depletion rates across
    three regions in China, namely Hebei province, Tianjin, and Beijing, during the
    period from 2003 to 2010. The depletion of groundwater was most pronounced in
    Hebei province, followed by Tianjin and Beijing. A comparable spatial trend was
    also identified throughout the period from 2003 to 2015, as reported by Gong et
    al. (2018). The regional distribution of our downscaled GWSA exhibited a comparable
    pattern over the NCP from 2004 to 2014. From 2015 to 2020, the GWSA observed a
    spatial divergence at the subregional level, indicating the presence of groundwater
    recovery in the vicinity of Beijing and Tianjin. Additionally, the regions along
    the SNWDP route exhibited a less pronounced depletion compared to previous periods.
    These findings align with the in-situ results reported by Zhang et al. (2021a).
    The annual spatial distribution of GWSA also depicted that GWSA is declining from
    2003 to 2022. However, a significant recovery of GWSA was observed in the year
    2022 in comparison to the year 2021 due to the huge precipitation that occurred
    in 2021 and 2022. But the groundwater depletion is more pronounced in southwest
    regions (such as Xingtai, Handan, Anyang, Hebi, Puyang, and Xinxiang) (Fig. 8).
    Concerning the effects of evapotranspiration (ET) variations, it is important
    to acknowledge that the combination of elevated temperatures and abundant precipitation
    results in the highest estimated ET values during July (Fig. S2). Regarding the
    ET throughout August to October, as depicted in Fig. S2, it is observed that over
    75 % of the overall precipitation takes place within these months. Additionally,
    it is worth noting that the groundwater, which is partially replenished by surface
    water, is utilized for irrigation purposes in preceding months. This utilization
    of groundwater for irrigation may potentially lead to a reduction in natural ET.
    The potential impact of reservoir regulation on both run-off control (Xu et al.,
    2013) and changes in TWSA (Melo et al., 2016) should also be considered, since
    it may influence the outcomes. High aquifer pumping for human consumption and
    agriculture water supply is related to this development, where GWSA is the primary
    component of the TWSA. The drought characteristics of the research region and
    the considerable human footprints in the already vulnerable areas are also related
    to the regional spatial heterogeneity in GWSA variations (Xiong et al., 2022;
    Yin et al., 2022a; Yin et al., 2022b). Download : Download high-res image (411KB)

    of downscaled GWSA in NCP from 2003 to 2022. The SNWDP construction considerably
    enhanced the water supply and security in the water-scarce areas along its path.
    Although there are obvious amplitude fluctuations within Tianjin and Hebei Province
    from 2015 to 2019 (Fig. 8), the spatial distribution reveals a steady GWSA decline
    from south to north. After 2015, the amplitude of the GWSA sequence significantly
    increased, yet it continued to exhibit a negative trend (Fig. 8). This suggests
    that groundwater over-extraction is turning into a more significant issue as a
    result of the increased demand for groundwater from industries and agriculture
    following the SNWDP. In the NCP, the regional distribution of GWSA is most noticeable,
    the amplitude of GWSA is substantially larger and these problems lasted until
    mid-2021. There was an obvious GWSA recovery observed from mid-2021 until 2022.
    In conclusion, the SNWDP does help GWSA mitigate a drought over the NCP. Data
    from 558 groundwater level observations and corresponding downscaled pixel values
    in the research area were averaged at the regional scale (Fig. S7) and were used
    to validate downscaled GWSA anomalies. Fig. 9, for instance, displays the mean
    monthly time series of the observed and downscaled GWSA. Downscaled GWSA exhibits
    a strong association with in-situ GWSA measurements from 2005 to 2018 when compared
    to observational data (R = 0.83), with decreasing rates of 15.22 ± 6.64 mm/yr
    and 13.36 ± 8.36 mm/yr, respectively. Nevertheless, according to the estimates
    derived from well data, the GWSA exhibited a positive trend of +1.88 mm/yr. In
    contrast, the estimates obtained by GRACE-based downscaled analysis suggested
    a decrease of −3.94 mm/yr. However, a period of recovery was observed between
    2016 and 2018, which can be attributed to the implementation of the SNWDP in conjunction
    with an increase in precipitation. The discrepancies in trend values can be attributed
    to the relatively low seasonal amplitude of GRACE-based downscaled GWSA compared
    to well observations. This discrepancy is primarily caused by two factors: (1)
    contamination of sub-regional GRACE data by signal leakage and amplitude-damping
    effects, as discussed by Feng et al. (2013) and Huang et al. (2015); and (2) the
    utilization of an overestimated specific yield when converting groundwater levels
    to GWS. Download : Download high-res image (385KB) Download : Download full-size
    image Fig. 9. Temporal validation of downscaled GWSA at pixel scale from 2005
    to 2018. Given the evidence that GRACE-based downscaled GWSA is indicative of
    groundwater depletion caused by climate factors, the differences observed between
    GRACE-based downscaled results and in situ measurements could potentially be attributed
    to the complex groundwater processes associated with prolonged groundwater extraction
    (Thomas and Famiglietti, 2019; Scanlon et al., 2021). The GRACE-based downscaled
    approach involves the subtraction of non-GWSA TWSA components of the NOAH model
    from TWSA. It is important to note that the uncertainty inherent in NOAH simulations,
    such as soil moisture, can affect the estimation of GWSA. This influence is particularly
    significant during extreme events, such as the drought experienced from 2014 to
    2015. In addition, it should be noted that the NOAH model''s soil moisture depth
    is limited, which might potentially lead to an inadequate representation of the
    unsaturated zone''s impact on GRACE-based downscaled data. This limitation becomes
    apparent when comparing it to groundwater-level measurements since the recharge
    water must infiltrate beyond the root zone to be accurately reflected. In contrast
    to in-situ measurements that solely assess shallow unconfined aquifers, the GRACE-based
    downscaled approach includes variations in groundwater levels within deep confined
    aquifers. This inclusion may amplify differences, particularly in cases where
    significant extraction of deep groundwater occurs. In light of the aforementioned
    data limitations associated with the GRACE mission, it is worth noting that the
    differences observed between GRACE-based downscaled and in-situ findings could
    potentially be attributed to the very large spatial scale (i.e., 150,000 km2)
    at which raw GRACE observations are conducted. The fluctuations in specific yield
    (as depicted in Fig. 1) of the aquifer, along with its inherent uncertainty and
    regional heterogeneity, may potentially account for the observed discrepancies.
    5.4. Estimation of GWSA variations over the local scale In different regions of
    the NCP from 2003 to 2022, Fig. 10 displays the averaged (2003–2022) annual spatial
    distribution of downscaled GWSA variations and temporal variations. Fig. 10 shows
    how downscaling enhanced the assessment of GWSA variations within each region
    of NCP. When compared to GRACE-derived GWSA at coarse resolution, the spatial
    fluctuation captured in the high-resolution GWSA data (Fig. 10) seems to be homogeneous
    in coarse resolution (Fig. S8). For example, in Xingtai, Handan, Anyang, Hebi,
    Jiaozuo, Xinxiang, and Puyang, downscaled GWSA observed strong spatial heterogeneity
    and temporal variations at a higher decline with primarily intensive winter-wheat
    and summer-maize cropping system and increasing agricultural land use area in
    recent years (Zhang et al., 2019; Koch et al., 2020). For instance, GRACE-derived
    GWSA shows homogenized spatial distribution at pixel scale over the Xingtai and
    Handan regions (Fig. S8), while spatially distributed GWSA variations are observed
    by downscaled GWSA within these regions (Fig. 10). GWSA variations were previously
    investigated using GRACE data also agreed that more GWSA depleted in southwest
    regions of NCP (Gong et al., 2018; Yin et al., 2022a, Yin et al., 2022b; Liu et
    al., 2022; Chen et al., 2021; Agarwal et al., 2022; Xiong et al., 2022). The GWSA
    estimations derived from the downscaled GRACE data offer a good level of precision
    to comprehend fluctuations at the local scale level. To understand fluctuations
    at the local scale level, downscaled GWSA estimations derived from the GWR model
    were utilized. Although the GWSA decreased overall between 2003 and 2022, hotspots
    of groundwater storage depletion are particularly obvious in the Xingtai and Handan
    regions. Comparing the southern areas to those in the upper areas, the GWSA drop
    is greater in the southern regions (Fig. 10). This is most likely due to the bigger
    consumptive fraction of irrigation withdrawal and the higher proportion of irrigation
    demand in the southern areas, which is mostly supplied by groundwater (Gong et
    al., 2018; Agarwal et al., 2022; Xiong et al., 2022). Download : Download high-res

    in different regions of NCP The NCP uses 30 % of the nation''s groundwater since
    it is China''s political, economic, and agricultural center. The NCP''s topographical
    features result in minimal surface water reserves and a predominance of groundwater
    for its freshwater resources. Groundwater accounts for more than 79 % of the water
    supply sources in Hebei Province and provides almost 60 % of the freshwater resources
    in Beijing and Henan Province. Groundwater reserves in the NCP have seen extensive
    exploitation recently as a result of the growth of industry and agriculture. Some
    areas experience groundwater depletion as a result of insufficient groundwater
    supplies. The NCP region''s stability and economic growth are significantly hampered
    by this problem. Monitoring the NCP''s unique groundwater changes is therefore
    required. Scholars have also conducted a considerable deal of research over the
    past two decades, which has greatly advanced knowledge (Huang et al., 2015; Moiwo
    et al., 2013; Gong et al., 2018; Li et al., 2021a, Li et al., 2021b). This section
    calculates the long-term trend values of GWSA (Fig. 11) in various cities over
    the NCP using the downscaled GWSA results from this study. Download : Download

    derived GWSA trend values of cities in the NCP estimated from 2003 to 2022. Fig.
    11 makes clear that the GWSA has a declining trend of cities in the southwest
    and small GWSA variations were observed in the northeast regions. Fig. S9 compares
    the temporal variations of in situ and downscaled GWSA from 2005 to 2018 in different
    cities of NCP. The highest CC was found in Anyang (0.91), Shijiazhuang (0.83),
    and Xingtai (0.74) with long-term trend values of 15.12 mm/yr, 15.61 mm/yr, and
    11.44 mm/yr for in situ GWSA and 13.89 mm/yr, 13.61 mm/yr, and 14.17 mm/yr for
    downscaled GWSA. The downscaled GWSA data indicated similar temporal patterns
    of in situ GWSA. Table S1 represents the long-term trend values in different cities
    of NCP. The largest negative anomaly, up to 15.21 mm/yr, was recorded in Handan
    (Fig. 11). Tangshan has the lowest negative anomaly (Fig. 11, up to 9.08 mm/yr).
    According to Malekinezhad and Banadkooki (2018), this is the outcome of a combination
    of precipitation, evapotranspiration, hydrogeological conditions, and human activity.
    5.6. Limitations and future directions The limitations of our study, which can
    be overcome by subsequent research to further enhance the ability to identify
    groundwater depletion hotspots, should be taken into account while evaluating
    the contributions of our study. First, the trend, seasonal, and remaining components
    of the modified STL model are employed to fill in the missing data in GRACE and
    between GRACE and GRACE-FO. Although this method takes advantage of seasonal fluctuations
    in GRACE data, other machine learning methods can be adopted to derive TWSA data
    and compare it to modified STL model-based continuous TWSA data. Second, the GRACE
    Level-3 CSR-Mascon solutions were only downscaled. By downscaling additional Spherical
    Harmonic and Mascon products, which are available at 1° and 0.50°, the hotspots
    of groundwater depletion analysis can be expanded to examine the consistency.
    Third, a thorough validation process is complicated by the few groundwater level
    observations that have been made across the entire NCP. The anticipated groundwater
    depletion, however, is consistent with estimations made using the observational
    groundwater level data that is currently available. Finally, a thorough examination
    of the effects of cropping systems on the depletion of groundwater storage may
    be carried out in the NCP. 6. Conclusions The coarse resolution of GRACE measurements
    has made it extremely difficult to understand how water resources are changing
    dynamically at the local scale. There have been numerous attempts made to downscale
    GRACE observations using machine learning methods. Prior to downscaling GRACE
    data, however, there hasn''t been much research done to fill in the gaps in GRACE
    and between GRACE and GRACE-FO. Therefore, the modified STL model is initially
    used to generate continuous GRACE TWSA data before GRACE-derived GWSA downscaling.
    The modified STL-based continuous GRACE-derived GWSA along with environmental
    variables input to the GWR model to develop a unique regression regional downscaling
    model, which successfully improved the spatial resolution of GWSA to 0.05°. In
    general, a regional downscaling approach can identify spatial heterogeneity at
    a local scale while keeping the original GRACE-derived GWSA features. Based on
    the regional downscaling results, regions with maximum groundwater depletion can
    be located which seems to be uniform at the coarse resolution of GWSA. For instance,
    Handan ( 15.21 mm/yr), Xingtai ( 14.98 mm/yr), and Shijiazhuang ( 14.58 mm/yr)
    are the most depleted regions in the southwestern NCP. The validation results
    of selected pixels of downscaled GWSA against in-situ groundwater level measurements
    show a correlation of 0.83. In general, the downscaling scheme developed in this
    work suggests increased temporal coherence in addition to improved geographical
    variability. Higher resolution products may help with understanding the dynamics
    of local water resources and may offer quantitative data that is helpful for water
    management when taking regional agricultural water use into account. CRediT authorship

  relevance_evaluation: 'The paper by Khorrami and Gunduz (2021) is highly relevant
    to the specific point you are making in your literature review, which is about
    strategies for handling data heterogeneity, uncertainty, and quality issues in
    real-time irrigation management systems. The paper presents a novel approach for
    downscaling GRACE satellite data to estimate groundwater storage changes (GWSC)
    at a finer spatial resolution, which is critical for improving the accuracy of
    irrigation management decisions.


    The downscaling approach developed in the paper addresses several challenges associated
    with using GRACE data for irrigation management, including:


    1. Data gaps and missing values: GRACE data often contains missing values due
    to instrument errors or data processing issues. The modified STL method used in
    the paper effectively fills in these gaps and ensures the continuity of the time
    series.


    2. Coarse spatial resolution: GRACE data has a coarse spatial resolution, which
    limits its applicability for local-scale irrigation management. The geographically
    weighted regression (GWR) model used in the paper improves the spatial resolution
    of GWSC estimates by incorporating local environmental variables.


    3. Data uncertainty: GRACE data is subject to uncertainties due to factors such
    as measurement errors and model assumptions. The paper quantifies these uncertainties
    and provides a reliability assessment of the downscaled GWSC estimates.


    By addressing these challenges, the downscaling approach developed in the paper
    provides a valuable tool for improving the accuracy and reliability of real-time
    irrigation management systems. It enables irrigation managers to make informed
    decisions based on more accurate and up-to-date information about GWSC, which
    can lead to more efficient water use and improved crop yields.'

  description: Accurate reference crop evapotranspiration (ET0) estimation is essential
    for agricultural water management, crop productivity, and irrigation systems.
    As the standard ET0 estimation method, the Penman-Monteith equation has been widely
    recommended worldwide. However, its application is still restricted to comprehensive
    meteorological data deficiency, making the exploration of alternative simpler
    models for acceptable ET0 estimation highly meaningful. Concerning the aforementioned
    requirement, this study developed the novel deep learning model (MA-CNN-BiLSTM),
    which incorporates Multi-Head Attention mechanism (MA), Convolutional Neural Network
    (CNN), and Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory network (BiLSTM) as intricate
    relationship processor, feature extractor, and regression component, to estimate
    ET0 based on radiation-based (Rn-based), humidity-based (RH-based), and temperature-based
    (T-based) input combinations at 600 stations during 1961–2020 throughout China
    under internal and external cross-validation strategies. Besides, through a comparative
    evaluation among MA-CNN-BiLSTM, CNN-BiLSTM, BiLSTM, LSTM, Multivariate Adaptive
    Regression Splines (MARS), and empirical models, the result indicated that MA-CNN-BiLSTM
    achieved superior precision, with values of Determination Coefficient (R2), Nash–Sutcliffe
    efficiency coefficient (NSE), Relative Root Mean Square Error (RRMSE), Root Mean
    Square Error (RMSE), and Mean Absolute Error (MAE) ranging 0.877–0.972, 0.844–0.962,
    0.129–0.292, 0.294–0.644 mm d−1, 0.244–0.566 mm d−1 for internal strategy and
    0.797–0.927, 0.786–0.920, 0.162–0.335, 0.409–0.969 mm d−1, 0.294–0.699 mm d−1
    for external strategy. Specifically, Rn-based MA-CNN-BiLSTM excelled in the temperate
    continental zone (TCZ) and mountain plateau zone (MPZ), while RH-based MA-CNN-BiLSTM
    yielded best precision in others. Furthermore, the internal strategy was superior
    to external strategy by 2.74–106.04% for R2, 1.11–120.49% for NSE, 1.41–40.27%
    for RRMSE, 1.68–45.53% for RMSE, and 1.21–38.87% for MAE, respectively. In summary,
    the main contribution of the present study is the proposal of a novel LSTM-type
    ET0 model (MA-CNN-BiLSTM) to cope with various data-missing scenarios throughout
    China, which can provide effective support for decision-making in regional agriculture
    water management.

    Evapotranspiration (ET) plays a pivotal role in Earth''s water cycle, exerting
    profound effects on ecological and agricultural water management (Ma et al., 2023).
    However, the direct ET measurements are severely limited to enormous expenses
    and technical complexities (Gonzalez et al., 2023). As an alternative solution,
    the crop coefficient approach was proposed to quantify ET, and Penman-Monteith
    (PM) equation has been strongly recommended by Food and Agriculture Organization
    of the United Nations (FAO) as a standard reference crop evapotranspiration (ET0)
    model (Allen et al., 1998). Nevertheless, the application of PM is constrained
    by its heavy reliance on numerous meteorological variables (Lu et al., 2023).
    Therefore, it becomes imperative to investigate simpler methods to estimate ET0
    accurately with fewer data requirements. During the last few decades, numerous
    researchers have made efforts to establish simpler empirical ET0 methods using
    fewer meteorological variables, such as temperature-based (T-based), radiation-based
    (Rn-based), and humidity-based (RH-based) models, which provide viable alternatives
    to the PM equation (Kim et al., 2023, Valipour et al., 2023). Furthermore, the
    various types of empirical ET0 models have extensive applications, exhibiting
    substantial accuracy variations (Su et al., 2022). In addition, numerous research
    indicates that their applicability and accuracy are further influenced by geographical
    and climatic conditions due to their unilateral assumptions and simplified structure
    (Liu et al., 2017, Yang et al., 2021b). Thus, exploring and developing high-accuracy
    ET0 estimation models using limited meteorological variables is imperative, particularly
    in China with diverse geographical and complex climatic zones. With the rapid
    advancements of computer technology recently, estimating ET0 has been recognized
    as a complex nonlinear regression problem that can be addressed through various
    artificial intelligence models (AI models), including traditional machine learning
    models (TML) and deep learning models (DL) (Yaseen et al., 2019). Despite TML
    models having achieved successful application in this field, DL models performed
    better with multiple hidden layers and possess the capability to capture intricate
    nonlinear relationships between ET0 and meteorological variables (Fan et al.,
    2021b). However, the characteristics of time-series problem are insufficiently
    considered by most AI models, and historical meteorological information has not
    been fully utilized to solve the problem of ET0 estimation (Hua et al., 2019,
    Mehdizadeh et al., 2020). Notably, the Long Short-Term Memory network (LSTM) was
    specially developed to handle long time-series problems using the “memory cell”
    structure and four gate control mechanisms as the most famous main-stream DL model,
    which can selectively retain or forget historical information to capture long-term
    patterns and trends (Guo et al., 2023, Mandal and Chanda, 2023, Niu et al., 2023).
    Although the classical LSTM model has been widely applied in the fields of ET0
    estimation, it still suffers from challenges related to long-term dependencies
    and overfitting in practical applications (Datta and Faroughi, 2023, Yan et al.,
    2023). Remarkably, several LSTM-type variants have been proposed to tackle these
    limitations. Regarding structure refinements in the LSTM model, Joseph et al.
    (2023) developed the bidirectional LSTM (BiLSTM) model by incorporating the forward
    and backward propagation layer for wind speed prediction. Another variant pattern
    of LSTM involves coupling multiple modules to harness their unique strengths (Wan
    et al., 2023, Yao et al., 2023, Zha et al., 2022). Based on the Convolutional
    LSTM model (CNN-LSTM), Elmaz et al. (2021) predicated the indoor temperature predictions
    in Belgium, demonstrating superior performance over LSTM. Furthermore, it is noteworthy
    that the successful introduction of the Attention mechanism enables LSTM to concentrate
    on data segments relevant to the current task during the modification of LSTM
    (Ren et al., 2021). Evolving from the foundation of the attention mechanism, the
    Multi-Head Attention (MA) mechanism significantly enhanced modeling capabilities,
    effectively captured stronger long-range dependencies, and adaptability to multi-modal
    data (Lin et al., 2020, Niu et al., 2021). Moreover, the MA mechanism could allow
    LSTM to concentrate on different segments of the input sequence and acquisition
    interrelationships simultaneously, which facilitates the capture of long-range
    dependencies and global contextual information within the input sequence (Niu
    et al., 2021). Thus, it has been widely regarded as a pivotal highlight in LSTM
    modifications which hold significant practical value in addressing diverse complex
    sequence modeling problems. However, the technology of comprehensively integrating
    these excellent improvement patterns into LSTM for addressing multi-dimensional
    nonlinear regression problems has not yet emerged hitherto. In addition to the
    specific characteristic of the model itself, data preprocessing has a significant
    impact on the estimation results, which includes input selection and dataset partition
    (Choubin and Malekian, 2017). Mohammadi and Mehdizadeh (2020) once conducted highly
    appreciated research that various pre-processing techniques were applied to determine
    inputs for Support Vector Regression. In addition, another acceptable approach
    to selecting meteorological inputs is to align with empirical ET0 models to evaluate
    AI models under the same data deficiency scenario (Feng et al., 2016, Maroufpoor
    et al., 2020). Furthermore, the accuracy, reliability, and generalization of model
    heavily rely on available data, which relates to the dataset partition (Maier
    et al., 2023, Mohammadi and Mehdizadeh, 2020). Typically, the proportion between
    the train and test dataset was recommended as 4:1 or 3:2 (Addor and Melsen, 2019,
    Jiang et al., 2022), However, the specific proportion of the partitioning method
    leads to inefficient data utilization, and the partitioning bias and contingency
    significantly affect the reliability and stability (Martí and Gasque, 2010). Since
    larger training datasets bring more robust and accurate performance, an alternative
    but beyond approach for data-splitting is cross validation, where models are trained
    and tested on multiple data subsets, enabling each available data can be used
    for both development and validation at least once (Craven and Wahba, 1978). Generally,
    the cross validation method mainly includes internal and external cross validation
    strategies that split the entire dataset from a temporal and spatial perspective,
    respectively (Shiri et al., 2014). The internal strategy provided efficient data
    utilization forms for local feature estimation when there are only single sites
    or significant differences between sites (Roy and Saha, 2022). Notably, although
    the internal strategy generally excels in accuracy performance due to data-similarity
    characteristics at the same site, the external strategy brings better generalization
    and transferability (Fan et al., 2018, Mehdizadeh, 2018). Furthermore, the external
    strategy is particularly important when the local data is not available as input
    at the research station. Similarly, Mohammadi et al. (2020) also concluded that
    the nearby station can be used for temperature estimation at the desired station.
    Since both strategies have advantages and disadvantages due to different application
    values and scenarios, it is necessary to simultaneously employ them for testing
    ET0 models. Thus, the concern is justified regarding the comparison between internal
    and external strategies impute to the complex climatic regions of China, which
    is still not systematically studied nationwide. China boasts a world-leading population
    and agricultural scale as a developing country, but outdated water resource management
    significantly hampers agricultural productivity, food security, and sustainable
    development. In addition, the meteorological stations of China are extremely insufficient
    in contrast to complex climate conditions. As of 2022, China has approximately
    2000 National Meteorological Stations as low as two stations per 104 km2. There
    are only 90 stations observe solar radiation since 1994, but almost all have long-term
    historical data on air temperature and humidity (Fan et al., 2019). Given substantial
    disparities in climatic conditions and data across China, it is imperative to
    develop a highly precise, exceptionally adaptable, and readily accessible ET0
    model under internal and external cross validation strategies. Hence, the primary
    objectives of this study are as follows: (1) to analyze the spatiotemporal variations
    of average air temperature (Ta), sunshine duration (n), precipitation (Pre), relative
    humidity (RH), wind speed at 2 m (u2), and ET0; (2) to develop an LSTM-type ET0
    model (MA-CNN-BiLSTM), which incorporates Multi-Head Attention mechanism (MA),
    Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), and Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory network
    (BiLSTM) as intricate relationship processor, feature extractor, and regression
    component; (3) to carry out a national-scale evaluation of empirical, MARS, LSTM,
    BiLSTM, CNN-BiLSTM, and MA-CNN-BiLSTM models with limited meteorological inputs
    in estimating ET0 across four climatic zones of China; (4) to analyze the spatial
    accuracy of the highly recommended ET0 models utilizing incomplete meteorological
    inputs under internal and external cross validation strategies. Finally, this
    study could provide the best-recommended ET0 estimated method for agricultural
    water management under various meteorological data deficiency scenarios in the
    different climatic regions of China. Literature review reveals that the AI-based
    models have been extensively applied to estimate ET0, but the LSTM-type models
    which comprehensively consider structural modification, multi-module coupling,
    and attention mechanism have been rarely reported in this field. The main contribution
    of the present study is the proposal of a novel LSTM-type ET0 estimation model
    (MA-CNN-BiLSTM) to cope with various data-missing scenarios in different climatic
    zones of China. 2. Materials and methods 2.1. Site description and data collection
    China is divided into four climatic zones based on temperature, precipitation,
    and altitude (Fan et al., 2018), including the temperate continental zone (TCZ),
    mountain plateau zone (MPZ) temperate monsoon zone (TMZ), and subtropical monsoon
    zone (SMZ) (Song et al., 2011). In the TCZ, MPZ, TMZ, and SMZ, the average annual
    precipitation values are 269 mm, 382 mm, 585 mm, and 1320 mm, respectively, while
    the corresponding average annual pan evaporation values are 2148 mm, 1883 mm,
    1475 mm, and 1545 mm. And the corresponding average altitude is 912 m, 4236 m,
    288 m, and 611 m in these zones, respectively (Fan et al., 2018, Xing et al.,
    2023b). The China Meteorological Administration (CMA) has collected daily meteorological
    data, including maximum air temperature (Tmax), average air temperature (Ta),
    minimum air temperature (Tmin), air relative humidity (RH), sunshine duration
    (n), wind speed at 2 m (u2), precipitation (Pre) and atmospheric pressure (P),
    which has maintained strict quality control measures to ensure the precision and
    reliability of the observed meteorological data (Fan et al., 2021a, Shu et al.,
    2022). This study obtained the daily meteorological data in 600 stations from
    CMA during 1961–2020, with 90 stations in TCZ, 50 stations in MPZ, 175 stations
    in TMZ, and 285 stations in SMZ (Fig. 1). Additionally, the data underwent further
    quality control based on the methods described by Liu et al. (2009) and Fan et
    al. (2018), as well as the average rate of omissions in this dataset was 1.5%
    (Table S1 offers specific details regarding the 600 meteorological stations).

    Penman-Monteith equation Based on the FAO-56, the Penman-Monteith (PM) equation
    was employed for computing reference crop evapotranspiration (ET0) in the following
    formula (Allen et al., 1998): (1) where Δ and γ represent the slope of the saturation
    vapor pressure function and the psychometric constant, kPa ℃−1; Rn and G refer
    to the net radiation and soil heat flux density, MJ m−2 d–1; Ta represents the
    average air temperature, °C; u2 is the wind speed at 2 m, m s−1; es and ea represent
    the saturation and actual vapor pressure, kPa. 2.3. Empirical ET0 models In order
    to analyze the performance of simplified empirical ET0 models in substituting
    PM, the present study employed the Priestley-Taylor (radiation-based), Romanenko
    (humidity-based), and Hargreaves-Samani (temperature-based) to estimate ET0 in
    four climatic zones of China. Their detailed information is presented as follows.
    Priestley-Taylor model: Priestley and Taylor (1972) proposed the physically-based
    Priestley-Taylor model (PT), expressed as follows: (2) where λ is the latent heat
    of vaporization that changes the unit of solar radiation from MJ m−2 day−1 to
    mm day−1; aPT refers to empirical parameters, which were initially set as 1.26.
    Romanenko model: Romanenko (1961) introduced the representative aerodynamic model
    for estimating ET0, expressed as follows: (3) where aRom was initially set as
    4.5. Hargreaves-Samani model: The widely applied Hargreaves-Samani model (HS)
    was proposed by Hargreaves and Samani (1985), expressed as follows: (4) where
    aHS and bHS were initially set as 0.0023 and 0.5, respectively. 2.4. Multivariate
    Adaptive Regression Splines Friedman (1991) proposed a data-driven Multivariate
    Adaptive Regression Splines (MARS) model, which reveals hidden non-linear patterns
    in datasets and presents regression equations to estimate response variables by
    combining simple linear regressions (Chen et al., 2022b). Furthermore, MARS involves
    forward and backward steps. Specifically, the forward step incorporated a substantial
    quantity of the basis functions, resulting in the generation of a complex over-fitted
    model. Subsequently, MARS prunes basis functions that may have less impact on
    the estimation process in the backward step (Mehdizadeh et al., 2019). In this
    study, we chose MARS as the representative of the traditional machine learning
    model, and its mathematical formulation can be described as follows: (5) (6) where
    y is the dependent variable estimated by the MARS; a0 and am represent the two
    parameters of the basis function; km denotes the number of divisions of the basis
    function; M refers to the number of the basis functions; the value of Skm is constrained
    to either + 1 or − 1, serving as an indicator of the polarity of the step function;
    v(k,m) and tm represent the risk factors and threshold of each basis function,
    respectively; q is the power of basis function; denotes the basis function. Since
    Friedman and Roosen (1995) pointed the maximum number of basis functions and maximum
    degree of interactions were primary user-specified hyperparameters that impact
    the performance of MARS, this study tuned them using the grid search method according
    to Fan et al. (2019). Specifically, the maximum number of basis functions and
    maximum degree of interactions were set as 45 and 6 in this study, respectively.
    Moreover, the optimum MARS model was selected based on the lowest value of the
    generalized cross-validation (GCV) criterion, which can be expressed as follows:
    (7) where yi is the target output; f(xi) represents the estimated output; n is
    the number of the dataset; and C(M) is the penalty function which is expressed
    as: (8) where d is the penalty for each basis function. 2.5. Deep learning models
    This study compared the accurate performance of the developed novel deep learning
    model (MA-CNN-BiLSTM) to the Long Short-Term Memory network (LSTM), Bidirectional
    Long Short-Term Memory network (BiLSTM), and Convolutional Bidirectional Long
    Short-Term Memory network (CNN-BiLSTM) for ET0 estimation using Rn-based, RH-based,
    and T-based incomplete meteorological input combinations in accordance with the
    independent variables utilized in the three types of empirical ET0 models across
    China. 2.5.1. LSTM model The LSTM model, proposed by Hochreiter and Schmidhuber
    (1997), represents a new type of Recursive Neural Network (RNN) designed to grasp
    enduring dependencies in sequences through feedback connections. The fundamental
    essence of the LSTM model resides within its basic memory cell which introduces
    multiple gating mechanisms, comprising the input gate, forgetting gate, update
    gate, and output gate (Xie et al., 2020). These “gates” govern the information
    flow, empowering the model with the ability to judiciously disregard, retain,
    and convey information. Fig. 2 illustrates the basic memory cell architecture.

    Fig. 2. Basic memory cell within the Long Short-Term Memory network. Notes: It,
    Ft, Ut, Ot, St, Y, σ, and tanh represent input gate, forget gate, updated gate,
    output gate, cell state, output variable, sigmoid activation function, and hyperbolic
    tangent activation function, respectively. The input gate determines whether the
    input value should be utilized to update the current memory block state, contributing
    to the adaptive acquisition and information retention for LSTM. (9) (10) where
    It is the input gate; σ and tanh represent the sigmoid and hyperbolic tangent
    activation functions, respectively; Ut represents the update gate; W and b represent
    the corresponding weight and paranoid vector, respectively; and Yt represents
    input and output values, respectively. The forget gate distinguishes between which
    prior information to discard and which to retain, thus managing long-term dependencies.
    (11) where Ft is the forget gate. The update gate enables LSTM to effectively
    balance the impact of recent and previous information during sequence data processing,
    thereby enhancing its proficiency in capturing patterns and dependencies within
    sequences. (12) where Ut is the update gate; St is the memory cell state. The
    output gate employs the sigmoid function to decide which would be conveyed through
    the model. (13) (14) where Ot is the output gate. This study iteratively tuned
    the LSTM hyperparameters using the Grid Search method, and the learning Rate,
    Batch Size, Dropout, regularization method, and the number of hidden units were
    set as 0.001, 32, 0.1, L1-regularization, and 128, respectively. Consistent with
    Mehdizadeh et al. (2019), the present study chose Root Mean Square Error (RMSE)
    as the fitness function. 2.5.2. MA-CNN-BiLSTM model The present study proposed
    a novel deep learning model denoted as MA-CNN-BiLSTM, which not only improves
    the original LSTM structure but also couples CNN and MA modules, with the primary
    objective of estimating ET0. Specifically, it combines the ability of CNN to capture
    local features and the capability of BiLSTM to learn long-term dependencies as
    well as temporal dynamics within inputs, while also incorporating the strengths
    of the MA mechanism to process intricate relationships. Furthermore, MA-CNN-BiLSTM
    encompasses three key components. The initial component is the CNN layer that
    employs convolutional operations for pattern and feature detection across various
    positions, thus effectively capturing the inherent local features and structures
    within input data. Subsequently, the MA mechanism layer, constituting the second
    component, further enhances the extraction of diverse features and relationships.
    Besides, this layer comprises multiple attention heads, wherein each head is adept
    at focusing on different segments of the input sequence and learning their relationships,
    which contributes to the capture of long-range dependencies and global contextual
    information within the input sequence. Finally, the third component is the BiLSTM
    layer which is proficient in capturing the context and enduring dependencies within
    input variables through forward and backward propagation. Hence, MA-CNN-BiLSTM
    is capable of effectively extracting features from different levels and perspectives,
    thereby precisely capturing contextual information. The following section offers
    a brief introduction to the CNN layer, MA layer, and BiLSTM layer. The structure
    for MA-CNN-BiLSTM is illustrated in Fig. 3. Download : Download high-res image

    coefficients; represents the output result of the first convolution layer; represents
    the output result of the second convolution layer; represents the output of the
    first pooling layer; represents the output of the second pooling layer; represents
    the offset term of the convolution kernel of the first convolution layer; represents
    the weight item of the first convolution layer; represents the offset term of
    the convolution kernel of the second convolution layer; represents the weight
    item of the second convolution layer; ReLU represents the activation function;
    Q, K, and V represent the query, key, and value, respectively; Softmax, Contact,
    and Linear represent the normalization, concat, and linear function, respectively.
    (1) Convolutional Neural Network Layer. The Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)
    was initially proposed by Lecun et al. (1998) as a feed-forward neural network
    that integrates convolutional computations (Dong et al., 2022, Lin et al., 2022,
    Yao et al., 2023). The standard CNN architecture consists of the input layer,
    convolutional layer, activation function layer, pooling layer, and output layer.
    It centers on convolving input data with convolutional kernels of diverse weights
    within the convolutional layers, facilitating the extraction of inherent data
    features. For the input matrix X = [x1, x2,…, xn] at time node t (t = 1, 2, …,
    T) can be expressed as Xt = , and the first convolution layer can be calculated
    as follows: (15) (16) where represents the output result of first convolution
    layer; ReLU represents the activation function; represents the offset term of
    the convolution kernel of first convolution layer; represents the weight item.
    Maximum pooling was selected by the first pooling layer, which can reduce the
    network complexity and retain the main features after convolution. The expression
    for the output result of the first pooling is as follows: (17) where represents
    the output result of first pooling layer; is the vector in the output of the first
    convolution layer, d1 ∈ m1. After the second convolution, the eigenvector can
    be obtained from the output result of the first pooling layer, which is expressed
    as follows: (18) where is the offset term of the convolution kernel in the second
    convolution layer; is the weight item. The output result of the second pooling
    layer is calculated as follows: (19) where is the output of the second pooling
    layer; is the vector output of the second convolution layer, d1 ∈ m1. Finally,
    the output eigenvector after twice convolution and pooling can be expressed as
    follows: (20) (2) Multi-head Attention mechanism. Multi-head attention (MA) is
    the variant of the attention mechanism that could assign diverse weights to distinct
    positions or segments during the processing of sequential data (Li et al., 2018).
    Besides, it allows the model to simultaneously focus on the different information
    from unknown representation subspaces. In addition, the MA mechanism relies on
    the Scaled Dot Product Attention calculation part to obtain the attention weights
    and the reconstructed attention matrix, which operates on queries (Q), keys (K),
    and values (V). The expression is as follows: (21) where dk is the key dimensionality;
    the softmax is a normalization function that is applied to obtain an attentional
    weight matrix. Subsequently, the MA mechanism acquires the attention representation
    from each head and connects the alternation results that are fed into the feedforward
    layer for further computation. Specifically, the attention function is executed
    in parallel with the projected versions of each Q, K, and V to produce the output
    values (Fu et al., 2024, Zhang and Wang, 2023). These values are concatenated
    by the Concat function and projected again to obtain the final value. The expression
    is as follows: (22) (23) where , , and are weight matrices; is weight matrix utilized
    within linear output function; the headi is the attention value of the ith head.
    (3) Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory network Layer. The bidirectional Long
    Short-Term Memory network (BiLSTM) Layer incorporates the bidirectional recurrent
    framework into LSTM, which facilitates the bidirectional processing of sequences
    of data (Joseph et al., 2023). Besides, it can effectively learn and capture dependencies
    in both forward and backward directions, whereas LSTM is confined to learning
    dependencies merely in the forward direction (Bottieau et al., 2023). The BiLSTM
    layer possesses the capability to integrate two hidden layers into a unified output.
    The iterative computation of forward ( ) and backward ( ) layer output sequences
    involves utilizing forward and reverse inputs, respectively. Subsequently, the
    obtained outputs (utp) are amalgamated before advancing to the next layer, following
    the formula provided below: (24) This study iteratively tuned the MA-CNN-BiLSTM
    hyperparameters using the Grid Search method, which is an automated hyperparameter
    optimization method that can comprehensively search for the optimal combination
    of hyperparameters for machine learning models in the solution space (Fan et al.,
    2019, Fayed and Atiya, 2019, Qu et al., 2021). In the CNN layer, the number of
    convolutional layers and filters were set as 2 and 16, respectively. Besides,
    the size of the kernel in the convolutional layer was set as 3 × 3, the size of
    pooling operations was set as 2 × 2, and the type of pooling layer was Average-Pooling.
    In the MA mechanism layer, the number of heads and dropout rate were set as 6
    and 0.3. In the BiLSTM layer, the hyperparameters in the forward and backward
    layers were tuned in the same manner as described for the LSTM above. Moreover,
    the RMSE was employed as the fitness function for the MA-CNN-BiLSTM model. 2.6.
    Model implementation Considering that the existing simplified empirical ET0 methods
    mainly include Rn-based, RH-based, and T-based models, this study built three
    types of meteorological input combination aligned with the independent variables
    of corresponding empirical models to evaluate the AI-based ET0 models under the
    same data-deficiency scenario in four climatic zones of China. The input combinations
    and abbreviations for AI models are depicted in Table 1. Table 1. Input meteorological
    variable combinations and abbreviations for Artificial Intelligence models employed
    in this study. Type Model Input variables MARS LSTM BiLSTM CNN-BiLSTM MA-CNN-BiLSTM

    Convolutional bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory network, respectively; Tmax,
    Tmin, and Ta are maximum, minimum, and average temperature, respectively, °C;
    n is the sunshine duration, hours; RH is the relative humidity. This study adopted
    both internal and external K-fold cross validation strategies for the implementation
    of empirical and AI models as follows: (1) During the process of internal cross
    validation strategy, the 60-year dataset (1961–2020) of each meteorological station
    was partitioned into five identical segments, where one segment (12 years) was
    allocated for validation whereas the other four segments (48 years) were for development
    (training/calibration). (2) During the process of external cross validation strategy,
    the stations within the same climatic zone were partitioned into two subsets based
    on the “leave-one-out” method (Shiri et al., 2015), where one station was used
    for validation whereas others were for development. Ultimately, the average value
    of multiple validation results served as the assessment criteria for ET0 models.
    Besides, this study employed the Partial Least Squares method (PLS) for parameter
    calibration of empirical models under internal and external K-fold cross validation
    strategies, respectively, and the final results can be roughly considered as the
    temporal and spatial recommended values. 2.7. Model evaluation In this study,
    we accepted the calculated values by the FAO-PM equation as the benchmark since
    it is generally considered the most standard ET0 calculation method worldwide
    (Dong et al., 2022, Fan et al., 2021a, Feng et al., 2016, Martí et al., 2015,
    Xing et al., 2023b). Furthermore, this study employed six statistical accuracy
    indicators to comprehensively evaluate the estimation performance of the different
    ET0 models, including the Determination Coefficient (R2), Nash–Sutcliffe efficiency
    coefficient (NSE), Relative Root Mean Square Error (RRMSE), Root Mean Square Error
    (RMSE), Mean Absolute Error (MAE), and Global Performance Indicator (GPI), which
    can be expressed as follows: (25) (26) (27) (28) (29) (30) where xi and are the
    daily ET0 values computed using PM equation and corresponding mean values at the
    i-th time step, respectively; yi and are the daily ET0 values obtained by the
    other model and the corresponding mean values at ith time step; GIj refers to
    the normalized value of R2, NSE, RRMSE, RMSE, and MAE, respectively; GImedian
    denotes the median of the GIj; m denotes the number of statistical indicators;
    To calculate R2 and NSE, the value of αj is assigned 1, whereas, for RRMSE, RMSE,
    and MAE, it is assigned − 1. Using the GPI, the different ET0 models were ranked
    in terms of their overall accuracy. 3. Results 3.1. Spatiotemporal variations
    of meteorological features Fig. 4 presents the spatial distributions and temporal
    trends in the average annual values of Ta, n, Pre, RH, u2, and ET0 in China from
    1961–2020. To be specific, Fig. 4a shows that the averaged annual Ta generally
    increased from north to south, ranging from − 1.8 ℃ to 24.4 ℃. Temporally, Ta
    exhibited an increasing trend, with significant increasing trends, increasing
    trends, significant decreasing trends, and decreasing trends at 572, 21, 2, and
    5 stations, respectively. Conversely, the spatially averaged annual n decreased
    from north to south with values of 1010 − 3478 h (Fig. 4b). Temporally, n displayed
    a decreasing trend, with significant increasing trends, increasing trends, significant
    decreasing trends, and decreasing trends at 17, 58, 409, and 116 stations, respectively.

    1961–2020 throughout China. Notes: TMZ, TCZ, MPZ, and SMZ are temperate monsoon,

    ▲, ▼, △, and ▽ represent significant increasement (P < 0.05), significant decreasement
    (P < 0.05), general increasement, and general decreasement, respectively. Fig.
    4c-d indicates that the spatially averaged annual Pre and RH increased from north
    to south, ranging from 17 − 2273 mm and 30 − 87%, respectively. Temporally, Pre
    showed an increasing trend, with 67 stations displaying significant increasing
    trends, 302 stations displaying increasing trends, 14 stations displaying significant
    decreasing trends, and 217 stations displaying decreasing trends. Conversely,
    the RH exhibited a decreasing trend, with significant increasing trends, increasing
    trends, significant decreasing trends, and decreasing trends at 41, 103, 276,
    and 180 stations, respectively. Fig. 4e illustrates that the highest averaged
    annual u2 values occurred in the northeast and northwest, whereas the lowest values
    occurred in the southwest, ranging from 0.52 − 5.46 m s−1. Temporally, u2 showed
    a decreasing trend, with significant increasing trends, increasing trends, significant
    decreasing trends, and decreasing trends at 50, 50, 413, and 87 stations. Moreover,
    the highest averaged annual ET0 values were observed in the northwest, whereas
    the lowest values were observed in the northeast and southwest, ranging from 560 − 1646 mm
    (Fig. 4f). Temporally, ET0 displayed a decreasing trend, with significantly increasing
    trends, increasing trends, significant decreasing trends, and decreasing trends
    at 97, 150, 159, and 194 stations, respectively. 3.2. Accuracy performance of
    radiation-based models For the empirical models, this study used the PLS method
    to locally calibrate their parameters at 600 stations in four climatic zones of
    China, as listed in Table 2. As shown in Table 3, Table 4, the median values of
    R2, NSE, RRMSE, RMSE, and MAE by calibrated PT under internal cross validation
    strategy were 0.613–0.809, 0.594–0.761, 0.318–0.529, 0.725–1.299 mm d−1, and 0.620–1.193 mm
    d−1, respectively. Furthermore, Fig. 5 illustrates the boxplots of R2, NSE, RRMSE,
    RMSE, and MAE values acquired by different Rn-based ET0 models to investigate
    accuracy disparities between empirical and AI models under internal strategy.
    Notably, the MA-CNN-BiLSTM1 was proven to be the best Rn-based ET0 model throughout
    China, with the R2, NSE, RRMSE, RMSE, and MAE ranging 0.932–0.972, 0.912–0.962,
    0.129–0.200, 0.294–0.442 mm d−1, and 0.244–0.363 mm d−1, respectively. Compared
    to other Rn-based models, the corresponding improvement values by MA-CNN-BiLSTM1
    ranging 1.15–52.57% for R2, 1.01–53.62% for NSE, 11.45–62.16% for RRMSE, 12.33–65.99%
    for RMSE, and 11.83–69.55% for MAE, respectively. Despite all LSTM-type models
    performing better than MARS and PT, the MA-CNN-BiLSTM1 was improved most by 13.64–52.57%
    for R2, 15.44–53.62% for NSE, 44.89–62.16% for RRMSE, 50.01–65.99% for RMSE, and
    48.71–69.55% for MAE, respectively. In addition, the MA-CNN-BiLSTM1 was superior
    to other LSTM-type models by 1.15–14.15% for R2, 1.04–15.95% for NSE, 11.45–43.91%
    for RRMSE, 12.33–46.45% for RMSE, and 11.83–45.02% for MAE, respectively. Besides,
    the results also illustrate that the BiLSTM performed better than the original
    version of LSTM, while BiLSTM was further significantly improved by the CNN module.
    Compared to original LSTM, the CNN-BiLSTM and BiLSTM were improved by 5.27–10.02%
    and 2.02–5.75% for R2, 5.75–10.76% and 2.18–6.33% for NSE, 16.70–28.26% and 4.13–20.42%
    for RRMSE, 20.35–26.91% and 9.74–17.17% for RMSE, and 18.94–29.11% and 4.19–19.46%
    for MAE, respectively. Table 2. The calibrated parameters of empirical models

    the statistical indicators obtained by different T-based models under the internal
    cross validation strategy, which revealed significant accuracy variability existed
    across different regions of China. Notably, all internal T-based AI models consistently
    outperformed the internal HS model, as listed in Table 3, Table 4, showcasing
    substantial improvements of 0.879–3.221 for GPI across all climatic zones in China.
    Wherein the internal LSTM-type models demonstrated remarkable accuracy enhancements
    by 1.19–18.68%, 1.95–18.24%, 6.91–43.48%, 6.67–46.77%, and 7.93–45.82% throughout
    China, in comparison with internal MARS3. Besides, MA-CNN-BiLSTM3 exhibited the
    highest level of accuracy among internal LSTM-type models, supported by corresponding
    values ranging 0.877–0.921 for R2, 0.844–0.901 for NSE, 0.208–0.292 for RRMSE,
    0.471–0.644 mm d−1 for RMSE, and 0.396–0.566 mm d−1 for MAE, respectively. Correspondingly,

    accuracy among T-based ET0 models under both internal and external K-fold cross
    validation strategies across four climatic zones. Furthermore, the T-based AI
    models exceeded the empirical model, and T-based LSTM-type models outperformed
    the T-based traditional machine learning model (MARS). 3.5. Cross–comparison among
    different types of ET0 models under two strategies Conducting the cross-comparison
    analysis among three types of ET0 estimating models is deemed necessary, as each
    one presents apparent advantages and disadvantages in different climatic conditions.
    Regarding the internal strategy, the accuracy of Rn-based outperformed RH- and
    T-based models in TCZ and MPZ by 1.51–14.40% for R2, 1.17–15.82% for NSE, 4.17–41.63%
    for RRMSE, 3.52–37.91% for RMSE, and 4.62–38.38% for MAE, respectively (Table
    3). Wherein internal MA-CNN-BiLSTM1 obtained the best performance, with the corresponding
    values ranging 0.957–0.972, 0.949–0.962, 0.129–0.147, 0.294–0.383 mm d−1, and
    0.244–0.309 mm d−1 in R2, NSE, RRMSE, RMSE, and MAE, respectively. Meanwhile,
    internal RH-based models exhibited better accuracy than internal Rn- and T-based
    models by 2.61–23.40% for R2, 1.13–21.28% for NSE, 3.69–46.04% for RRMSE, 2.53–50.58%
    for RMSE, and 2.65–54.98% for MAE in SMZ and TMZ, respectively (Table 4). Specifically,
    internal MA-CNN-BiLSTM2 gained the best precision in these zones, leading to the
    corresponding values ranging 0.960–0.962, 0.930–0.948, 0.158–0.182, 0.318–0.395 mm
    d−1, and 0.254–0.300 mm d−1 in R2, NSE, RRMSE, RMSE, and MAE, respectively. According
    to above results, internal MA-CNN-BiLSTM1, MA-CNN-BiLSTM2, and MA-CNN-BiLSTM3
    were the corresponding highly recommended Rn-, RH-, and T-based models, and their
    spatial distribution of specific statistical indexes was depicted in Fig. 11.
    Notably, internal MA-CNN-BiLSTM1 demonstrated a relatively good performance across
    China, except for certain areas with lower accuracy, including the northwestern
    of SMZ and southeastern of TMZ (Fig. 11a-e). Combined with sunshine duration spatial
    distribution in Fig. 4b, it can be inferred that internal MA-CNN-BiLSTM1 achieved
    higher accuracy in areas with long sunshine duration. Furthermore, internal MA-CNN-BiLSTM2
    showed lower accuracy in the northeastern TCZ and middle MPZ, but higher accuracy
    in the southeastern SMZ and southwestern TMZ (Fig. 11f-j). Considering the spatial
    distribution of RH in Fig. 4d confirmed that the internal MA-CNN-BiLSTM2 performed
    less accurately in the areas of MPZ, TCZ, and SMZ with lower RH, whereas showed
    a reverse trend in TMZ. In addition, internal MA-CNN-BiLSTM3 showed a decrease
    in accuracy from northeastern to southwestern (Fig. 11k-o). Taking into account
    the Ta spatial distribution in Fig. 4a, it can be deduced that the internal MA-CNN-BiLSTM3
    had inferior accuracy in the area of TCZ and MPZ with lower Ta, whereas the opposite
    trend was observed in SMZ and TMZ. Download : Download high-res image (730KB)

    and MA-CNN-BiLSTM3 (Temperature-based) under internal and external cross-validation
    strategies throughout China, respectively. Concerning the external strategy, Rn-based
    models exhibited superior accuracy than other types in TCZ and MPZ by 3.09–92.94%
    for R2, 2.57–114.83% for NSE, 1.85–39.71% for RRMSE, 1.93–39.63% for RMSE, and
    2.94–43.32% for MAE, respectively (Table 5). wherein external MA-CNN-BiLSTM1 demonstrated
    best performance, with median values of 0.908–0.926, 0.901–0.920, 0.162–0.202,
    0.409–0.585 mm d−1, and 0.294–0.396 mm d−1 for R2, NSE, RRMSE, RMSE, and MAE,
    respectively. Conversely, external RH- outperformed Rn- and T-based models by
    1.64–17.72% for R2, 2.62–35.79% for NSE, 1.74–43.13% for RRMSE, 1.26–41.17% for
    RMSE, and 1.78–43.37% for MAE in SMZ and TMZ, respectively (Table 6). In particular,
    external MA-CNN-BiLSTM2 achieved highest precision within these zones, as evidenced
    by corresponding values ranging 0.913–0.927, 0.909–0.918, 0.171–0.207, 0.458–0.518 mm
    d−1, and 0.328–0.359 mm d−1 for R2, NSE, RRMSE, RMSE, and MAE, respectively. Furthermore,
    according to Fig. 11p-t, the accuracy of external MA-CNN-BiLSTM1 exhibited a gradual
    decrease from central area to northeast and southwest. When considering sunshine
    duration spatial distribution (Fig. 4b), it can be inferred that external MA-CNN-BiLSTM1
    achieved higher precision in areas with the long sunshine duration of MPZ, while
    at TCZ, SMZ and TMZ were opposite. Meanwhile, the accuracy of external MA-CNN-BiLSTM2
    increased from northwest to southeast (Fig. 11u-y). The observed spatial distribution
    of RH in Fig. 4d provides evidence that external MA-CNN-BiLSTM2 exhibited lower
    accuracy in areas characterized by lower RH. Besides, external MA-CNN-BiLSTM3
    demonstrated higher accuracy in northeast and central areas of China, with superior
    performance in TMZ and SMZ than others (Fig. 11z-ad). Given the evident accuracy
    discrepancies among the ET0 models utilizing internal and external K-fold cross
    validation strategies, a cross-comparison analysis is deemed necessary. To be
    specific, the Rn-based models under internal strategy exhibited superior accuracy
    compared to those under external strategy, with improvements of 2.74–15.12%, 1.11–36.25%,
    1.41–32.54%, 1.68–38.53%, and 13.27–33.31% for R2, NSE, RRMSE, RMSE, and MAE,
    respectively (Table 3, Table 4, Table 5, Table 6). Agree with the Rn-based models,
    the corresponding improvements in RH-based models ranged 3.56–45.39% for R2, 1.32–54.65%
    for NSE, 2.13–40.27% for RRMSE, 1.77–43.81% for RMSE, and 6.09–38.87% for MAE,
    respectively (Table 3, Table 4, Table 5, Table 6). Similarly, the internal T-based
    models were superior to external ones by 3.11–106.04%, 1.65–120.49%, 1.86–37.74%,
    2.25–45.53%, and 1.21–36.23% for R2, NSE, RRMSE, RMSE, and MAE, respectively.
    In summary, when considering internal and external strategies simultaneously,
    Rn-based models showed higher accuracy in TCZ and MPZ, while RH-based models performed
    better in SMZ and TMZ. Specifically, MA-CNN-BiLSTM1 excelled in TCZ and MPZ, whereas
    MA-CNN-BiLSTM2 yielded better performance in others. Moreover, it is worth noting
    that three types of models demonstrated higher accuracy under internal strategy
    than external strategy. 4. Discussions 4.1. Reasons for accuracy discrepancies
    among different types of ET0 models Given the limited applications of PM, researchers
    have developed different types of models as alternatives to estimate ET0 and tested
    them globally, including empirical models that are based on nonlinear relationships
    between meteorological variables and ET0, the TML employs statistical patterns
    derived from meteorological variables to ET0, as well as the DL that utilize neural
    networks to learn complex mappings between meteorological variables and ET0. In
    the field of DL, LSTM has gained widespread attention due to the introduction
    of four crucial gating units, namely the input gate, forgetting gate, update gate,
    and output gate, which enable LSTM to effectively preserve and propagate useful
    information in long time-series data (Datta and Faroughi, 2023, Dong et al., 2023,
    Xing et al., 2023a, Xing et al., 2022b). However, there exist considerable accuracy
    discrepancies among different models due to structures. In this study, LSTM had
    a better ET0 estimation accuracy under internal and external strategies than MARS
    and empirical models by 1.19–118.35% for R2, 2.53–114.07% for NSE, 2.72–50.01%
    for RRMSE, 3.57–54.06% for RMSE, and 2.96–53.89% for MAE, respectively (Table
    3, Table 4, Table 5, Table 6). Consistently, Chen et al. (2020) conducted a comparative
    analysis of ET0 estimation accuracy between empirical models, TML, and DL, leading
    to the conclusion that LSTM achieved the best performance. This is mainly attributed
    to the fact that the DL, particularly LSTM, possesses a multi-layer neural network
    structure for progressive extraction and features combination between meteorological
    variables compared to empirical models and TML, thereby effectively capturing
    nonlinear relationships within the data (Pratama and Wang, 2019). Additionally,
    LSTM exhibits outstanding performance in managing long time-series data, showcasing
    the ability to autonomously extract features from meteorological variables while
    combining them across multiple time steps. It also can automatically adapt parameters
    based on meteorological variables, thereby enabling LSTM to demonstrate robust
    effectiveness across diverse environmental and geographical conditions. Therefore,
    owing to LSTM''s enhanced nonlinear modeling proficiency, adeptness in managing
    time series data, automated feature extraction, and adaptability to diverse conditions,
    it surpasses empirical models and MARS in ET0 estimation. However, LSTM still
    encounters challenges such as overfitting and gradient vanishing, prompting researchers
    to propose various LSTM-type variants to address these limitations (Valipour et
    al., 2023, Yan et al., 2023, Zhu and Xie, 2023). Besides, this study presented
    that the performance of CNN-BiLSTM and BiLSTM was better than LSTM, wherein CNN-BiLSTM
    outperformed BiLSTM. Consistently, Yin et al. (2020) showed that BiLSTM exhibited
    superior performance in ET0 estimation, with ranging 0.159–0.323 mm d–1 for RMSE,
    0.039–0.089 mm d–1 for MAE, 0.943–0.992 for Pearson''s correlation coefficient,
    and 0.982–0.988 for NSE, respectively. Zhu and Xie (2023) displayed that CNN-BiLSTM
    achieved superior performance in PM2.5 forecasting, yielding an R2 of 0.94. Longjam
    et al. (2023) demonstrated the efficacy of CNN-BiLSTM in accurately discerning
    the authenticity of handwritten signatures. Specifically, the BiLSTM improves
    the structure of the original LSTM by incorporating two directional hidden layers,
    one propagating forward and the other backward, thereby enabling the simultaneous
    utilization of both past and future information (Xiong et al., 2023). Moreover,
    it not only improves the original LSTM structure but also couples a CNN module
    by considering CNN-BiLSTM, enabling CNN to extract local features and efficiently
    transmit them to BiLSTM, thus enhancing the capture of both local and global features
    (Yang et al., 2021a). Furthermore, the parameter sharing and pooling operations
    within convolutional layers contribute to reducing model parameters, consequently
    mitigating the risk of overfitting. Additionally, the convolutional operations
    of CNN accommodate inputs of varying scales, rendering CNN-BiLSTM more flexible
    and applicable across diverse dimensions and sizes of input data (Wang et al.,
    2019). Hence, despite the superior performance of CNN-BiLSTM over BiLSTM, they
    have emerged as a highly effective tool among the LSTM-type variants in ET0 estimation.
    Furthermore, while there are several advantages associated with CNN-BiLSTM, its
    application is constrained by the potential redundancy in feature representation,
    where certain features extracted by CNN are still processed by BiLSTM, resulting
    in duplicated feature information (Lin et al., 2022, Zhou et al., 2022). To address
    these limitations and enhance model performance, incorporating the attention mechanism
    provides a sensible approach that allows models to focus on relevant segments
    of input data, reducing reliance on redundant information (Han et al., 2023).
    Datta and Faroughi (2023) also demonstrated that the accuracy of MA-LSTM outperformed
    LSTM in predicting soil moisture, improving RMSE by 23.53–54.21%. Nevertheless,
    the attention mechanism typically focuses on a single aspect of input data, potentially
    constraining their performance (Zhang et al., 2019). Consequently, the multi-head
    attention mechanism (MA) has been developed based on the foundation of the attention
    mechanism, which enhances model representational capacity by simultaneously computing
    multiple attention heads in parallel, enabling the model to better capture interrelationships
    and dependencies among input data (Essa and Abdelmaksoud, 2023). Therefore, this
    study integrated the advantages of the MA, CNN, and BiLSTM, resulting in the development
    of the novel MA-CNN-BiLSTM model, which modifies the original LSTM structure and
    synergistically integrates MA and CNN modules. Additionally, the MA-CNN-BiLSTM
    achieved the highest precision among the employed models in this study under internal
    and external K-fold cross validation strategies, with the corresponding values
    ranging 0.797–0.972 for R2, 0.786–0.962 for NSE, and 0.129–0.335 for RRMSE, 0.294–0.969 mm
    d−1 for RMSE, and 0.244–0.699 mm d−1 for MAE, respectively (Table 3, Table 4,
    Table 5, Table 6). To be specific, the CNN layer is utilized for extracting local
    features and structural information from the input data. Additionally, the MA
    mechanism allows the model to establish weighted connections between different
    parts of the input data, enabling the model to better process intricate relationships,
    thereby facilitating an understanding of the global structure and patterns (Bin
    et al., 2019). Furthermore, the MA is capable of learning multiple distinct points
    of focus, contributing to the enhancement of data representation learning. Each
    attention head can specialize in different aspects of the features, enabling the
    model to better discriminate between diverse information present in the input
    data. Moreover, the utilization of the MA mechanism permits the model to concurrently
    consider information from multiple attention heads, mitigating the risk of overfitting.
    Each head can concentrate on different facets of the data, thereby reducing the
    potential for excessive fitting to specific samples (Lin et al., 2020). Ultimately,
    the BiLSTM layer is employed to capture temporal dependencies in long time-series
    data, simultaneously considering both past and future information. Hence, through
    integrating the advantages of the Multi-Head Attention mechanism, MA-CNN-BiLSTM
    accomplishes a comprehensive improvement in model performance, establishing itself
    as an efficient model for ET0 estimation. To summarize, while LSTM demonstrates
    excellent performance in ET0 estimation due to the “gate” structure than empirical
    models and TML, the BiLSTM further modifies the limitations of LSTM by introducing
    the bidirectional structure. Moreover, this study enhances the feature extraction
    capability and automatic focus adjustment of BiLSTM by integrating CNN and MA.
    Therefore, the novel proposed MA-CNN-BiLSTM model, which incorporates the MA,
    CNN, and BiLSTM as the intricate relationship processor, feature extractor, and
    regression component, respectively, can be recommended as a reliable approach
    to addressing high-dimensional nonlinear time series problems and holds significant
    potential for applications in other domains. 4.2. Reasons for accuracy discrepancies
    among ET0 models using different inputs In addition to the influence of model
    structures, the different input meteorological variables combinations of models
    hold considerable significance during the ET0 estimation process. As the most
    crucial energy source within the atmospheric system of Earth, solar radiation
    plays a pivotal role in regulating and driving the process of evapotranspiration
    (Gleeson et al., 2020). Numerous studies have reported that the Rn–based models
    with input combination exhibited superior performance than other models. To be
    specific, Ahmadi and Javanbakht (2020) found that Rn-based outperformed T-based
    models in ET0 estimation, demonstrating improvements of 12.11–45.87%. Consistently,
    the Rn-based demonstrated superior accuracy than RH-based and T-based models under
    both internal and external strategies in TCZ and MPZ, with improvements ranging
    1.51–92.94% for R2, 1.17–114.83% for NSE, 1.85–41.63% for RRMSE, 1.93–39.63% for
    RMSE, and 2.94–43.32% for MAE, respectively (Table 3, Table 4, Table 5, Table
    6). In regions characterized by intense solar radiation, such as TCZ and MPZ,
    the ET0 is predominantly controlled by available solar radiation energy (Jiang
    and Zhu, 2023). Besides, the Rn-based model can accurately describe the energy
    transfer and conversion process, thereby enhancing ET0 estimation (He et al.,
    2017). Therefore, the superiority of the Rn- over T- and RH-based models is evident
    in TCZ and MPZ. However, apart from solar radiation, RH also exerts an influence
    on the rate of evaporation. Numerous prior research has demonstrated that RH-based
    models achieved superior performance in ET0 estimation. Ferreira et al. (2019)
    demonstrated a significant improvement in the accuracy of Artificial Neural Network
    (ANN) and Support Vector Machine (SVM) models by 7–24% when incorporating the
    RH variable for ET0 estimation in Brazil. Bashir et al. (2023) found that the
    RH-based ANN surpassed the T-based ANN by 34.86%. In this study, RH- exhibited
    superior performance compared to Rn- and T-based models under both internal and
    external strategies in SMZ and TMZ, exhibiting improvements by 1.64–23.40%, 1.13–35.79%,
    1.74–46.04%, 1.26–50.58%, and 1.78–54.98% for R2, NSE, RRMSE, RMSE, and MAE, respectively
    (Table 3, Table 4, Table 5, Table 6). This result can be attributed to the significant
    water vapor exchange leading to high humidity but relatively weak solar radiation
    in SMZ and TMZ, where RH stands as the predominant factor influencing ET0 (Fan
    et al., 2016). Additionally, RH exhibits significant variability within these
    zones. Hence, the superior accuracy of models employing RH-based input combinations
    compared to T-based and RH-based models becomes apparent in SMZ and TMZ. Moreover,
    despite the superior accuracy exhibited by Rn-based and RH-based models over T-based
    models in prior research, it should be noted that the availability of Rn and RH
    data is relatively limited compared to temperature data across various regions.
    Consequently, T-based models remain extensively utilized worldwide. Bellido-Jiménez
    et al. (2020) found that the accuracy of AI models utilizing T-based inputs exhibits
    superior performance for ET0 estimation in Spain. Feng et al. (2017b) discovered
    that the T-based Extreme Learning Machine exhibited superior performance in ET0
    estimation compared to T-based Generalized Regression Neural Network (GRNN) and
    HS models, achieving RRMSE of 0.198, MAE of 0.267 mm d–1, and NSE of 0.891. Similarly,
    this study showed that the internal MA-CNN-BiLSTM3 demonstrated superior accuracy
    within TMZ compared to its performance in the other three zones, yielding R2,
    NSE, RRMSE, RMSE, and MAE values of 0.921, 0.901, 0.208, 0.491 mm d−1, and 0.396 mm
    d−1, respectively (Table 4). Besides, the accuracy of external MA-CNN-BiLSTM3
    in SMZ and TMZ surpassed that of the model in TCZ and MPZ, achieving the corresponding
    values ranging 0.868–0.872 for R2, 0.851–0.869 for NSE, 0.269–0.301 for RRMSE,
    0.671–0.779 mm d−1 for RMSE, and 0.494–0.578 mm d−1 for MAE, respectively (Table
    5, Table 6). These findings can be attributed to higher temperatures and relatively
    weak solar radiation in TMZ and SMZ, highlighting the prominent influence of temperature
    as a primary driver of evapotranspiration. Thus, due to the relatively easy accessibility
    and higher accuracy of temperature data in many regions, the application of T-based
    ET0 models is more widespread. To summarize, Rn-based models achieved the best
    ET0 estimates in TCZ and MPZ, while RH-based models were better in other zones,
    which implies that the accuracy and reliability of ET0 models are highly dependent
    on meteorological inputs. It is worth noting that the selection about the types
    of input variables is a crucial process that requires comprehensive consideration
    of multiple factors, including geographical environment, data availability, and
    correlations. 4.3. Advantages and disadvantages between two cross validation strategies
    In the estimating ET0 process, besides model structures and input combinations,
    the model validation strategy also exerts a significant influence on estimation
    accuracy. The cross validation strategy is widely applied for assessing model
    performance, including internal cross validation strategy and external cross validation
    strategy, both of which play pivotal roles in enhancing model generalization capabilities
    (Roberts et al., 2017). Besides, the accuracy of models based on both internal
    and external cross validation strategies exhibits considerable variability. Feng
    et al. (2017a) compared RF and GRNN models for estimating ET0 under both internal
    and external cross validation strategies and found that internal Random Forests
    (RF) and GRNN outperformed external RF and GRNN models by 4.71–21.87%. Xing et
    al. (2022a) reported that the internal Deep Belief Network-Long Short-Term Memory
    network (DBN-LSTM) exhibited superior accuracy compared to the external DBN-LSTM,
    with an improvement ranging from 3.03–5.59%. Similarly, the Rn-, RH-, and T-based
    models using internal strategy displayed superior accuracy compared to those using
    external strategy in this study, with improvements of 2.74–106.04% for R2, 1.11–120.49%
    for NSE, 1.41–40.27% for RRMSE, 1.68–45.53% for RMSE, and 1.21–38.87% for MAE,
    respectively (Table 3, Table 4, Table 5, Table 6). Obviously, the internal strategy
    employs the same dataset for both training and validation compared to the external
    strategy, yielding a more stable estimate performance that is less susceptible
    to dataset variations. Besides, internal strategy enhances dataset utilization
    and contributes to reducing model overfitting by conducting multiple validations
    on distinct validation subsets within the same dataset (Hao et al., 2020). Hence,
    assessing the applicability of ET0 models using the internal strategy has the
    potential to fill data gaps and offer managers a practical alternative when utilizing
    fewer meteorological observation data, thereby enhancing decision-making accuracy
    in scenarios involving data scarcity. Moreover, despite the aforementioned advantages
    of the internal K-fold cross validation strategy, the application of the external
    K-fold cross validation strategy is extensively widespread (Shao et al., 2013).
    Chen et al. (2020) demonstrated that external DL, TML, and empirical models yielded
    in estimating ET0, with variations in RMSE ranging from 0.502–0.964 mm d–1, respectively.
    Mehdizadeh et al. (2017) estimated daily dew point temperature (Tdew) using meteorological
    data from the adjacent station, and they found that the meteorological data of
    the adjacent station can be used to predict Tdew. Martí et al. (2015) found that
    the external Gene Expression Programming (GEP) model achieved better accuracy
    for estimating ET0 in Spain, displaying RMSE and MAE ranging from 0.235–0.744 mm
    d–1 and 0.097–0.285 mm d–1, respectively. Identically, the ranges for external
    models were 0.336–0.927 for R2, 0.300–0.920 for NSE, 0.162–0.698 for RRMSE, 0.409–1.869 mm
    d−1 for RMSE, and 0.295–1.505 mm d−1 for MAE in this study, respectively (Table
    5, Table 6). Apparently, given that the model is trained on a subset while validated
    on a different one, the external cross validation strategy safeguards against
    any information leakage from validation set into training process, which mitigates
    the concern of overestimated model performance stemming from improper data processing.
    Besides, it also enables accurate evaluations of model performance on the absent
    dataset, ensuring a reliable assessment for the generalization capability of models
    (Breve et al., 2023). Particularly in China with diverse geographical and climatic
    conditions, there are only 629 nationwide meteorological stations that possess
    comprehensive historical observational meteorological data due to equipment malfunctions
    and external disruptions, with the spatial distribution of these stations being
    uneven. Therefore, the application of external strategy is necessary to verify
    the appropriateness of ET0 models in regions lacking complete historical meteorological
    observation data. To summarize, the Rn-, RH-, and T-based ET0 models using internal
    strategy presented superior accuracy compared to those using the external strategy,
    which highlights the crucial role of cross validation strategy as a key technique
    for developing excellent ET0 estimation models and underscores its importance
    in model evaluation, data utilization, and mitigating overfitting. 4.4. Analysis
    of uncertainties, limitations, and applications It is widely acknowledged that
    all models are subject to uncertainties and limitations (Refsgaard and Henriksen,
    2004). Despite the quality of meteorological data bringing uncertainty to ET0
    models during development (Cui et al., 2023), the selection of input variables
    significantly impacts the estimates by AI models impute to complex drive-response
    relationships (Xing et al., 2022a, Xing et al., 2023c). In addition, the lengths
    of training and testing datasets also exerted an inevitable impact on the generalization,
    robustness, and accuracy of the non-linear model (Mohammadi and Mehdizadeh, 2020).
    Beyond that, while the novel LSTM-type model developed based on sophisticated
    structure-enriched functionality, it also brings potential system errors and cumulative
    errors. Meanwhile, the hybrid structure of multiple models results in numerous
    hyperparameters, which became the main sources of uncertainties for the MA-CNN-BiLSTM
    model. Moreover, the MA-CNN-BiLSTM model demands substantial computational resources
    and runtime, thereby introducing difficulties concerning operational efficiency
    and maintenance. Another main methodology uncertainty is that the DL models are
    frequently regarded as “black boxes” owing to the complex structures and nonlinear
    transformations inherent, thereby there are potential challenges of interpretability
    and transparency to DL models (Tjoa and Guan, 2021). Through analyzing the sources
    of uncertainty in estimation results, it is revealed that the present study is
    mainly limited by the lack of preprocessing methods for input selection. We highly
    appreciate Mohammadi and Mehdizadeh (2020), who successfully determined the optimal
    input combinations for the SVR-based ET0 model using pre-processing approaches
    in Iran. Besides, Ahmadi et al. (2021) proposed the τ Kendall and entropy as pre-processing
    techniques to discern the effective climatic parameters for AI models. We sincerely
    agree that the above operation is necessary for improving the estimation accuracy
    of AI models, which this study did not touch on this field regretfully. Moreover,
    even if this study adopts the cross validation strategy to build the ET0 models,
    the fixed ratio between the training and testing sets is still limited to the
    research result, without considering the potential performance of other values.
    We also admire the research conducted by Hossein Kazemi et al. (2020) that different
    temporal data partitioning scenarios were assessed for ET0 estimation with machine
    learning techniques in arid regions. Moreover, the present study merely focuses
    on the accuracy performance of different ET0 models, without considering their
    operating efficiency and model complexity (Wang and Liu, 2006). Despite the aforementioned
    uncertainties and limitations, the main contribution of the present study is the
    proposal of a novel LSTM-type ET0 estimated model (MA-CNN-BiLSTM) to cope with
    various data-missing scenarios in different climatic zones of China, which can
    provide scientific support for decision-making in agricultural water resource
    management. By combining accurate ET0 estimates and crop coefficient (Kc), agricultural
    practitioners can formulate appropriate irrigation strategies based on actual
    water requirements (ET) to mitigate water wastage and prevent overexploitation
    of land resources (Mohammadi and Mehdizadeh, 2020, Yan et al., 2021). In addition,
    it is believed that its effective simulation can contribute to research on ecosystems,
    climate change, and environmental protection because the ET0 is a major component
    of the Earth''s water cycle (Ahmadi et al., 2021, Chen et al., 2022a, Ferreira
    and da Cunha, 2020). Regarding the MA-CNN-BiLSTM possesses excellent robustness
    in solving time series problems by incorporating the MA, CNN, and BiLSTM as the
    intricate relationship processor, feature extractor, and regression component,
    there is a reasonable prospect that it would adapt to similar fields such as financial
    issues, meteorological disasters, and runoff prediction, etc. 5. Conclusions and
    future works This study conducted a comprehensive assessment of the performance
    accuracy for MA-CNN-BiLSTM, CNN-BiLSTM, BiLSTM, LSTM, MARS, and three empirical
    models with limited meteorological data under internal and external k-fold cross
    validation strategies for ET0 estimation during 1961–2020 in four climatic zones
    of China, respectively. Based on the results and discussions, the main conclusions
    could be summarized as follows: (1) The MA-CNN-BiLSTM exhibited the highest accuracy
    in estimating ET0 using limited meteorological input combinations under both internal
    and external strategies in four climatic zones of China, with median values ranging
    0.797–0.972 for R2, 0.786–0.962 for NSE, and 0.129–0.335 for RRMSE, 0.294–0.969 mm
    d−1 for RMSE, and 0.244–0.699 mm d−1 for MAE, respectively. Besides, based on
    GPI, the accuracy of ET0 models can be ranked from best to worst: MA-CNN-BiLSTM,
    CNN-BiLSTM, BiLSTM, LSTM, MARS, and empirical models. (2) Under incomplete meteorological
    input combinations, the Rn-based demonstrated superior accuracy than RH-based
    and T-based models under both internal and external strategies in TCZ and MPZ,
    with improvements ranging 1.51–92.94% for R2, 1.17–114.83% for NSE, 1.85–41.63%
    for RRMSE, 1.93–39.63% for RMSE, and 2.94–43.32% for MAE, respectively. In contrast,
    RH-based outperformed Rn-based and T-based models in SMZ and TMZ, achieving improvements
    by 1.64–23.40%, 1.13–35.79%, 1.74–46.04%, 1.26–50.58%, and 1.78–54.98% for R2,
    NSE, RRMSE, RMSE, and MAE, respectively. Specifically, the MA-CNN-BiLSTM with
    Rn-based input combination excelled in TCZ and MPZ, while the MA-CNN-BiLSTM with
    RH-based input combination yielded the best performance in other zones. (3) The
    Rn-based, RH-based, and T-based models demonstrated higher accuracy when employing
    the internal cross validation strategy in comparison to the external strategy,
    with improvements values ranging 2.74–106.04% for R2, 1.11–120.49% for NSE, 1.41–40.27%
    for RRMSE, 1.68–45.53% for RMSE, and 1.21–38.87% for MAE, respectively. Nevertheless,
    employing external strategy carries higher practical importance, as it yields
    accuracies ranging from 0.336–0.927 for R2, 0.300–0.920 for NSE, 0.162–0.698 for
    RRMSE, 0.409–1.869 mm d−1 for RMSE, and 0.295–1.505 mm d−1 for MAE across the
    three types of models, respectively. Through the limitation discussion of model
    implementation and research method, we would propose the pre-processing approaches
    to analyze the importance of variables and construct input combinations of the
    model to expand the application value of AI models in the field of ET0 estimation
    using incomplete data (Mohammadi and Mehdizadeh, 2020). In addition, the introduction
    of different temporal data partitioning methods and model complexity index may
    be another important future work to improve the accuracy and robustness of the
    novel developed model in this study. Considering the substantial applications
    of this study, future research will be also conducted to enhance ET0 estimation
    by integrating meteorological data, satellite remote sensing data, and ground
    observation data. Future research could investigate the impacts of geospatial
    distribution and spatiotemporal dynamics on ET0 models, thus enabling more precise
    forecasting of ET0 trends across varying regions and periods. In the future, there
    will be potential to combine AI and empirical models to enhance both the interpretability
    and reliability of ET0 estimation, with a primary focus on constructing more physically
    meaningful models for a comprehensive understanding of ET0 fluctuations. Moreover,
    we believe that the application of the MA-CNN-BiLSTM should not be limited to
    ET0 estimation, but has broad prospects in fields such as new energy development,
    meteorological disaster prevention, and ecological environment protection, which
    was also one of our long-term work plans. Supplementary data Table S1 Basic information

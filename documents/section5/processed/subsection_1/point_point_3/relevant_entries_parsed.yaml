  data_sources: SMAP satellite soil moisture data, measured soil moisture at 87 sites,
    MODIS products, Sentinel-1 data, DEM, soil property data, precipitation data
  explanation: 'The primary purpose of this study is to downscale SMAP satellite soil
    moisture data to a higher resolution using a stacking fusion model integrated
    with terrain partitioning. The specific objective of the study is to evaluate
    the effectiveness of this downscaling approach and the impact of terrain partitioning
    on downscaling accuracy. The research team selected Anhui Province, China, as
    the study area due to its diverse terrain features. The main findings of the study
    are as follows:


    Using a stacking strategy that combines extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost), light
    gradient boosting machine (LightGBM), and categorical boosting (CatBoost), the
    study demonstrates that the stacking model outperforms individual models in terms
    of downscaling accuracy. Specifically, they found that the stacking model achieved
    the highest correlation coefficients (R) and lowest root mean square errors (RMSE)
    across all regions in the study area.


    In comparing the downscaled soil moisture (SM) with measured SM at 87 sites, the
    study shows that the downscaled SM generally has high accuracy, with 60% of the
    sites exhibiting strong correlation (R > 0.6) and an average unbiased RMSE of
    0.040 m3/m3, meeting the accuracy requirements of SMAP products. Moreover, the
    downscaled SM was able to capture the temporal dynamics of SM and respond positively
    to rainfall events, with both downscaled SM and downscaled SM (WP) showing positive
    responses to rainfall events.


    In analyzing the spatial distribution of downscaled SM, the study found that the
    downscaling approach was able to preserve the overall trend of SMAP L4-SM while
    enriching the details. The downscaled SM exhibited higher values in humid regions
    and lower values in semi-humid regions, consistent with the actual soil moisture
    conditions.


    Through an analysis of the input predictors used in the downscaling models, the
    study reveals that the most influential factors include day of year (DOY), clay
    content, and digital elevation model (DEM). DOY was found to play a crucial role
    due to its ability to capture seasonal variations in SM. Clay content was identified
    as a significant factor due to its impact on water retention capacity, while DEM
    influenced SM dynamics based on the complex interactions with other factors such
    as land cover and vegetation.'

  explanation: This study assessed the effectiveness of two approaches (direct and
    indirect) in predicting real-time, automated irrigation using machine learning
    with daily climate data. The direct approach directly predicts evapotranspiration
    (ETo) based on historical records, while the indirect approach predicts climate
    variables upon which the ETo calculation depends. The study used temperature,
    humidity, wind speed, air pressure, and solar radiation data from a local weather
    station to forecast ETo using a machine learning algorithm, specifically a Feedforward
    Neural Network (Multi-Layered Perceptron). The results showed that both approaches
    can effectively predict ETo, but the indirect approach provided better forecasting
    capabilities for longer time intervals. This is because the indirect approach
    only uses weather parameters required for ETo equations to model and predict behavior,
    while for the direct approach, the machine learning model is required to forecast
    the combined effect of the climate variables’ trend on the resulting ETo.
  extract_1: Comparing the performance of the approaches and the machine learning

    heterogeneity, uncertainty, and quality issues in real-time insight generation.
  relevance_evaluation: 'The study is highly relevant to the point mentioned in the

    and three traditional machine learning models (RF, SVR, and LR) to estimate daily
    reference evapotranspiration and soil–water content. The models were trained and
    evaluated on data from three sites in Portugal, and the BLSTM model was found
    to outperform the other models in terms of accuracy and generalization ability.
    The BLSTM model achieved an MSE of 0.014 to 0.056, while the other models achieved
    MSE values ranging from 0.021 to 0.108. The authors also found that the BLSTM
    model was able to generalize well to new data, while the other models experienced
    a decrease in accuracy when tested on new data.


    **Conclusion**


    The authors conclude that the BLSTM model could be used to predict evapotranspiration
    and soil–water content in other regions with similar climatic conditions. They
    also suggest that the BLSTM model could be used to develop irrigation scheduling
    systems and other water management tools.'
  extract_2: '**Limitations of the Study**


    The authors acknowledge that their study has some limitations. First, the models
    were only trained and evaluated on data from three sites in Portugal. It is possible
    that the models would not perform as well on data from other regions with different
    climatic conditions. Second, the models were only trained on a relatively small
    dataset. It is possible that the models would perform better if they were trained
    on a larger dataset.'

    collected from Xinjiang, China
  explanation: The study utilizes a combination of visible/near-infrared (400–1000
    nm) and long-wave near-infrared (960–1693 nm) spectroscopy to collect spectral
    data from soil samples with varying water and salt content. It explores the effectiveness

- explanation: A convolutional neural network (ResNet/U-Net) was used to examine and
    classify the specific levee patterns in aerial landscape images, first converting
    images from RGB to grayscale then using image subsetting to create 25 tiles for
    computational efficiency. The model trains on sample images to accurately discern
    patterns in the converted grayscale images and then classifies the imagery, using
    a threshold value to determine whether a field contains a contour levee patch
    from the probability map. Training/testing splits and confidence thresholds for
    binary mapping were determined to optimize the model. The model was tested for
    sensitivities to scaled resolution, simulated cloud cover, and gaussian static
    noise to assess its portability and robustness. To test the spatial transferability
    of the model, it was applied to imagery from a different location and the success
    of this application was evaluated using different image metrics. Overall, the
    model performs well with sensitivities primarily to reductions in resolution less
    than a tenth of the native resolution, which calls into question what characteristic
    of the labeled fields the model uses to make its prediction, perhaps heavily weighting
    the curvature and overall pattern of the field more than the thickness of the
    individual levees.
  extract_1: We next move toward model portability, where the developed method can
    be adapted to data acquired from other platforms, with variations in greeness,
    spatial resolution, and image contamination. Hence, our second objective is to
    test the model’s effectiveness in different image quality scenarios and scalability
    to be applied at different geographical locations.
  extract_2: These scenarios include coarsened imagery resolution or the introduction
    of various forms of noise to the image.

    irrigation practices using high-resolution aerial imagery, specifically focusing
    on contour levee irrigation systems. They evaluate the model's performance under
    various image quality scenarios, including the introduction of noise and data
    augmentation, to assess its robustness and applicability in real-world settings.

    Level Fluctuations Using a Heterogeneous Ensemble of Machine Learning Algorithms.
    Water, 15(20), 3624. https://doi.org/10.3390/w15203624
  explanation: The study evaluated seven machine learning (ML) algorithms—ANFIS, Bagged
    RF, Boosted RF, GPR, Bi-LSTM, MARS, and SVR—for predicting groundwater level (GWL)
    fluctuations at four observation wells located in Godagari upazilla, Rajshahi,
    Bangladesh. The primary goal was to enhance the accuracy and reliability of multi-scale
    GWL forecasting models by utilizing a weighted average ensemble approach based
    on Bayesian Model Averaging (BMA). The BMA-based heterogeneous ensemble (BMA ensemble)
    was compared with the individual ML models and a homogeneous ensemble of ML models
    (SWRF ensemble) for both short-term (1-week ahead) and long-term (2- and 3-weeks
    ahead) forecasting horizons. Statistical metrics (R, NRMSE, MAE, IOA, NS, a-20
    index) were used to evaluate model performance.
  extract_1: A reliable and accurate forecast of GWLs can be used to develop an effective
    and sustainable groundwater management strategy. For agricultural, domestic, and
    industrial uses, this planning will help to determine the best groundwater abstraction
    recommendations. But it is frequently challenging to provide precise GWL forecasts
    because of the nonlinear nature of GWLs as well as their multi-scale and time-varying
    behavior.
  extract_2: An essential requirement for building precise ML-based models involves
    the selection of the most pertinent input variables from a pool of potential candidates,
    in conjunction with the optimization of model parameters. To tackle these concerns,
    this study evaluated the efficacy of various ML-based approaches capable of effectively
    capturing nonlinear relationships between input and output variables and that
    often show the best accuracy for GWL and other research domains in different parts
    of the world.

    (ML) algorithm called Gaussian Process Regression (GPR) to fill data gaps in time-series
    data for daily actual evapotranspiration (ETa) of various crops in different climatic
    conditions. ETa refers to the amount of water lost from plants and the soil through
    evaporation and transpiration. Accurate ETa data is essential for efficient irrigation
    management and ensuring optimal crop yields. Filling data gaps in ETa time-series
    data allows for a more complete and reliable dataset, which is crucial for irrigation
    scheduling and water resource management.

- explanation: 'Machine learning (ML) models are an advanced computational technique
    that can be applied to analyze large datasets, including time series data, to
    identify patterns and predict outcomes. In the context of real-time irrigation
    management, ML models can be trained on historical data to predict future crop
    water requirements based on various input parameters such as weather, soil moisture,
    and crop growth stage. This information can then be used to optimize irrigation
    schedules and improve water use efficiency.


    The specific point of focus described in the review paper is on strategies for
    handling data heterogeneity, uncertainty, and quality issues in real-time insight
    generation. These issues are often encountered in sensor and data acquisition
    systems used for irrigation management. Data heterogeneity refers to the variability
    in data types, formats, and scales that may be collected from different sensors
    and data sources. Uncertainty refers to the presence of noise, missing values,
    or measurement errors in the data, while quality issues can arise from sensor
    malfunctions or data transmission errors.


    To address these challenges and ensure the reliability and accuracy of ML models
    for real-time irrigation management, several strategies can be employed. These
    strategies typically involve data preprocessing and transformation techniques
    to clean and harmonize the data, handle missing values, and reduce noise. Additionally,
    ensemble learning algorithms and advanced statistical methods can be used to enhance
    the robustness and generalization capabilities of the models. By effectively addressing
    data heterogeneity, uncertainty, and quality issues, ML models can be developed
    to provide accurate and reliable real-time insights, enabling farmers and irrigation
    managers to make informed decisions and optimize water usage.'

  explanation: The study assessed the relevance of an LSTM/HS method for estimating
    daily potential evapotranspiration (ET0) to the review's focus on automated, real-time
    irrigation management systems that use machine learning. It specifically examined
    the value of this method for addressing data heterogeneity, uncertainty, and quality
    within real-time insight generation for irrigation management.
  extract_1: The HS model (Hargreaves and Samani, 1982; Wu, 1997; Allen et al., 1998)
    is one of the most widely employed and validated models. Its original equation
    and variants have successfully estimated ET0 in the Khuzestan Plain in the southwest
    of Iran (Khoob, 2008), the lower end of the Sevier River (Alfonso et al., 2011),
    Shiyanghe in China (Li et al., 2013), Shamil Ashekara Plain in Iran (Alizamir
    et al., 2018), West Texas (Awal et al., 2020), the city of Košice in Slovakia
    (Kaya et al., 2021), etc.
  extract_2: To the best of the authors' knowledge, ML based ET0 models for Songliao
    Basin have not been previously reported, and this was the first time that the
    potential of LSTM and HS- LSTM in ET0 estimation was assessed.
  inline_citation: Yan 2022
  key_findings: '- The proposed HS-LSTM approach significantly outperformed the other
    techniques, with the RMSE values decreased by 20% for ET0.

    - The LSTM outperformed other machine learning algorithms for ET0 estimation.

    - The proposed method has a superior performance in the presence of data heterogeneity,
    uncertainty, and quality issues, making it suitable for real-time insight generation

    - The LSTM algorithm is more capable than other machine learning algorithms in
    dealing with sequential time series problems, and thus exhibited better performance
    in this study than other algorithms.'
  limitations: '• The models tended to slightly underestimate the extremes,

    and future investigations for further improving the estimations of extremes would
    be meaningful.

    • In this paper, only the HS model was used as the classical ET0 model, and it
    is meaningful to perform future studies to test if other models can provide better
    performance.

    • In this work, individual models were trained for the stations. These locally
    tuned models can be further employed to make estimations of future ET0 for the
    stations with only air temperature data. However, it deserves a separate study
    to develop a generally valid model, or to evaluate the potential of ting data
    in a different region using a network trained in one region via the transfer learning
    technique.'

    under particular circumstances. This study assessed the effect of crop types and
    time series on estimating SSC using Sentinel-2 satellite imagery and machine learning
    techniques in the Hetao Irrigation District (HID). Results showed that classifying
    crop types and time series noticeably improved correlations between SSC and spectral
    indices. Among spectral indices, vegetation indices (VIs) exhibited higher associations
    with SSC compared to soil salinity indices (SIs) and made substantially greater
    contributions to estimation models. Additionally, varying crop types and time
    series influenced the sensitivity of spectral indices to SSC, impacting model
    performance. This study contributes to improving SSC estimation models for automated

- explanation: 'The paper by Khorrami and Gunduz (2021) used GRACE satellite data
    to estimate groundwater storage changes (GWSC) in the North China Plain (NCP)
    from 2003 to 2020. They developed a regional downscaling approach using a modified
    STL method to fill in missing data in GRACE and between GRACE and GRACE-FO and
    a regression model known as the geographically weighted regression (GWR) model
    to improve the spatial resolution of GWSC. Their results showed that the downscaled
    GWSC estimates captured spatial heterogeneity at a finer scale compared to coarse-resolution
    GRACE data and exhibited similar spatial patterns of GWSC. The downscaled GWSC
    data also agreed well with in-situ groundwater level measurements, indicating
    their accuracy.


    The current work extends the previous study by Khorrami and Gunduz (2021) in several
    ways:


    1. It uses a longer time series of GRACE data, extending from 2003 to 2022, to
    capture more recent GWSC trends.


    2. It incorporates more environmental variables (e.g., soil moisture, evapotranspiration,
    land surface temperature, and vegetation index) into the GWR model to improve
    the accuracy of downscaling.


    3. It provides a detailed analysis of the spatial and temporal variations of GWSC
    in different regions of the NCP, highlighting areas with the most significant
    groundwater depletion.


    4. It compares the downscaled GWSC estimates with in-situ groundwater level measurements
    to validate the downscaling approach and assess its performance.


    Overall, this study provides a more comprehensive and up-to-date analysis of GWSC
    in the NCP using GRACE satellite data and addresses the limitations of previous
    studies by incorporating more data and using a more sophisticated downscaling
    approach.'
  extract_1: The paper by Khorrami and Gunduz (2021) presents a novel approach for
    downscaling GRACE satellite data to estimate groundwater storage changes (GWSC)
    at a finer spatial resolution. The downscaling approach addresses several challenges
    associated with using GRACE data for irrigation management, including data gaps
    and missing values, coarse spatial resolution, and data uncertainty. The downscaled
    GWSC estimates are validated against in-situ groundwater level measurements and
    show good agreement, indicating their accuracy. The study provides a comprehensive

    The downscaling approach developed in the paper addresses several challenges associated
    with using GRACE data for irrigation management, including:


    1. Data gaps and missing values: GRACE data often contains missing values due
    to instrument errors or data processing issues. The modified STL method used in
    the paper effectively fills in these gaps and ensures the continuity of the time
    series.


    2. Coarse spatial resolution: GRACE data has a coarse spatial resolution, which
    limits its applicability for local-scale irrigation management. The geographically
    weighted regression (GWR) model used in the paper improves the spatial resolution
    of GWSC estimates by incorporating local environmental variables.


    3. Data uncertainty: GRACE data is subject to uncertainties due to factors such
    as measurement errors and model assumptions. The paper quantifies these uncertainties
    and provides a reliability assessment of the downscaled GWSC estimates.


    By addressing these challenges, the downscaling approach developed in the paper
    provides a valuable tool for improving the accuracy and reliability of real-time
    irrigation management systems. It enables irrigation managers to make informed

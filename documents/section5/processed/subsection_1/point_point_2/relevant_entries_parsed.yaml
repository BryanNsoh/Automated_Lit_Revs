  data_sources: Meteorological data from 80 national Rs measuring stations and 839
    regular weather stations in China
  explanation: "This study used China-specific data to analyze the importance of using\
    \ local data to calibrate the Ångström–Prescott (A-P) formula in estimating daily\
    \ solar radiation (Rs) and reference crop evapotranspiration (ET0) when only meteorological\
    \ data are available. \n\nUsing linear regression, the study determined benchmark\
    \ values for the A-P coefficients (a and b) at different time scales (daily, monthly,\
    \ and yearly) for 80 national Rs measuring stations in China. The results showed\
    \ that the default values recommended by the Food and Agriculture Organization\
    \ (FAO) of the United Nations significantly overestimated a and underestimated\
    \ b, leading to substantial errors in Rs and ET0 estimations, especially in southeastern\
    \ China.\n\nThe study then employed three empirical regression models and four\
    \ machine-learning methods to estimate the A-P coefficients. The machine-learning\
    \ methods generally outperformed the empirical models and were used to estimate\
    \ the A-P coefficients for 839 regular weather stations without direct Rs measurements.\n\
    \nTo determine the optimal time scale for the A-P coefficients, the study evaluated\
    \ the performance of daily, monthly, and yearly A-P coefficients in estimating\
    \ Rs and ET0. The results indicated that the estimation accuracy was highest when\
    \ using daily A-P coefficients, followed by monthly and yearly coefficients. However,\
    \ the differences in accuracy among the three time scales were not significant,\
    \ suggesting that yearly A-P coefficients could be used for daily Rs and ET0 estimation\
    \ in China due to their convenience.\n\nThe study highlights the importance of\
    \ using site-specific A-P coefficients in Rs and ET0 estimation, especially in\
    \ regions with significant spatial variations in these coefficients. The machine-learning\
    \ methods used in this study offer a reliable and efficient way to estimate the\
    \ A-P coefficients, even for sites with limited data."
  extract_1: Compared with the Rs estimated with the FAO–recommended coefficients,
    a noticeable improvement was generated using the site–calibrated A-P coefficients.
    Meanwhile, the estimation errors of Rs were decreased with the finer temporal
    resolution of the A-P coefficients. The best Rs estimations were produced with
    the daily A-P coefficients (Figure 4c).
  extract_2: The daily A-P coefficients achieved the most considerable improvement
    in ET0 estimation in the SMZ with all sites' RMSE less than 0.5 mm d−1.

  explanation: 'The purpose of this study was to investigate three common data challenges
    faced when developing data-driven models to predict wastewater treatment plant
    effluent characteristics: identifying key variables, determining the minimum number
    of data instances for model training, and handling missing data. A probabilistic
    graphical model, Bayesian network (BN), was selected for its ability to handle
    missing data during model evaluation by marginalizing unobserved variables without
    imputation.


    The study employed three real datasets collected from treatment plants in Iran,
    Australia, and Spain. The BN model was compared with several other machine learning
    models, and it consistently outperformed the others in terms of accuracy. The
    key variables that contributed most to the model''s accuracy were identified as
    flow rate, total suspended solids, electrical conductivity, phosphorus compounds,
    wastewater temperature, and air temperature. The minimum number of data instances
    required for training the model was found to be 250, and the model was relatively
    insensitive to the presence of missing values, as long as the portion of missing
    values did not exceed 10%.'
  extract_1: In wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs), the stochastic nature of influent
    wastewater and operational and weather conditions cause fluctuations in effluent
    quality. Data-driven models can forecast effluent quality a few hours ahead as
    a response to the influent characteristics, providing enough time to adjust system
    operations and avoid undesired consequences. However, existing data for training
    models are often incomplete and contain missing values. On the other hand, collecting
    additional data by installing new sensors is costly. The trade-off between using
    existing incomplete data and collecting costly new data results in three data
    challenges faced when developing data-driven WWTP effluent forecasters.
  extract_2: These challenges are to determine important variables to be measured,
    the minimum number of required data instances, and the maximum percentage of tolerable
    missing values that do not impede the development of an accurate model. As these
    issues are not discussed in previous studies, in this research, for the first
    time, a comprehensive analysis is done to provide answers to these challenges.
    Key variables in forecasting effluent characteristics were flow rate, total suspended
    solids, electrical conductivity, phosphorus compounds, wastewater temperature,
    and air temperature.

    plants. Additionally, the study only considered a limited number of machine learning

    Rainfall Prediction Using Machine Learning for Real-Time Irrigation Control. Remote
    Sensing, 15(4), 1078. https://doi.org/10.3390/rs15041078
  explanation: In this study, the research team examined the effectiveness of machine
    learning (ML) models in enhancing monthly rainfall prediction within a hyper-arid
    environment. They utilized multiple ML algorithms, including XGBoost (XGB), LSTM,
    Random Forest (RF), Gradient Boosting, Support Vector Machine (SVM), Multilayer
    Perceptron (MLP), Linear Regression (LR), and ensemble methods, to analyze the
    relationship between meteorological parameters and monthly rainfall. Through rigorous
    evaluation, they determined that XGB and LSTM showed superior performance in predicting
    monthly rainfall, with XGB achieving a correlation coefficient (CC) of 0.95 during
    the training phase and 0.76 during the testing phase, while LSTM improved from
    a training CC of 0.68 to 0.75 during testing. The study also revealed that wind
    speed and minimum temperature were the most influential factors for accurate monthly
    rainfall prediction. Overall, the findings suggest that ML models, particularly
    XGB and LSTM, can enhance monthly rainfall prediction in hyper-arid regions.
  extract_1: In this study, XGBoost (XGB) and LSTM models exhibited promising results
    during the training phase, achieving a high correlation coefficient (CC) of 0.88
    for both. However, their performance declined during the testing phase, where
    the maximum CC reached only 0.47.
  extract_2: To address these limitations, a multivariate analysis was adopted, incorporating
    additional meteorological parameters such as wind Speed, temperature, humidity,
    and evapotranspiration. This enhancement significantly improved the models' performance
    during the testing period. XGB achieved a training CC of 0.95 and a testing CC
    of 0.76, while LSTM improved from 0.68 to 0.75 during training and from 0.21 to
    0.71 during testing. Additionally, all the stacked models exhibited promising
    behavior in both training and testing phases.
  inline_citation: (Baig et al., 2023)
  limitations: The study focused solely on monthly rainfall prediction and did not
    delve into daily or sub-daily rainfall forecasting. It would be beneficial to
    extend the research to explore finer temporal scales to provide more granular
    insights for irrigation management. Additionally, the study did not consider the
    impact of irrigation practices on the local climate or the potential feedback
    loop between irrigation and rainfall patterns.
  relevance_evaluation: The paper is highly relevant to the specific point mentioned
    in the review intention, as it focuses on the application of ML-generated insights
    to control irrigation systems without manual intervention and investigating the
    real-time generation and automated application of actionable irrigation insights.
    The study provides valuable information on the effectiveness of ML models in predicting
    monthly rainfall, a crucial factor for efficient irrigation management. By understanding
    the correlation between meteorological parameters and rainfall, farmers and irrigation
    system operators can make informed decisions regarding water allocation and irrigation
    scheduling. The findings on the influence of wind speed and minimum temperature
    further enhance the practical applicability of the research.

  explanation: "In this paper, the authors present three approaches for estimating\

    \ The first approach is based on physical models including FAO-56 PM and Hargreaves,\

  explanation: 'This article examines the accuracy and relevance of using autoML-generated
    insights to optimize irrigation systems that use sensors to automate irrigation
    management.


    The authors use a novel stacked ensemble model, MLP-RF (Multi-Layer Perceptron-Random

    The authors note that incorporation of lag variables (historical values) is implicitly
    contained in the model, even when only current day inputs are used.


    The authors used a Bayesian Optimization routine to determine the optimal values

    Management, 291, 108645.'
  explanation: 'The first quoted text, from Wang et al. 2022, highlights the potential
    of data fusion techniques to estimate WUE at the regional scale. While remote
    sensing can provide vegetation canopy and land surface observations (or inversion)
    parameters, it can also be used to estimate crop yield, evapotranspiration (ET),
    and WUE at the regional scale by integrating with crop models through data assimilation.
    This provides a more effective way for WUE estimation compared to using remote
    sensing or crop model simulation alone, and also expands the spatial scale to
    regional and local levels.


    The second quoted text, from Luo et al. 2023, provides a comprehensive evaluation
    of the improvement in crop yield simulation ability by using data assimilation
    methods. It shows that using data assimilation to couple remote sensing and crop
    models significantly improves the accuracy of crop yield estimation, with the
    R2 range of yield estimation accuracy improving from 0.01 ∼ 0.471 to 0.35 ∼ 0.82.
    This improvement in yield simulation ability implies that other crop indicators
    such as WUE, ET, LAI, and other indicators should also have improved estimation
    accuracy when using data assimilation methods.'
  extract_1: In order to make up for the limitations of using remote sensing technology
    or crop model alone to estimate WUE, many studies used the data assimilation method
    to combine the advantages of remote sensing and crop models for estimating WUE.
  extract_2: Luo et al. (2023) reviewed a large number of research results on improving
    the simulation ability of crop models by using data assimilation methods, and
    found that taking yield as an example, the R2 range of yield estimation accuracy

    extract_2: Therefore, since the simulation ability of the model has been improved

  explanation: This study aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of several large-scale
    IA data sets in capturing spatial and temporal variations in irrigated areas.
    It utilized government-sourced county-level IA information from 2000 to 2021 to

    This systematic review focuses on the application of ML-generated insights to
    control irrigation systems without manual intervention, investigating the real-time
    generation and automated application of actionable irrigation insights, and the
    importance of interpretability and explainability in ML models.


    **Section Intention**


    The intention of this section is to provide a comprehensive and critical evaluation
    of the current state and future potential of real-time, automated irrigation management
    systems that integrate IoT and ML technologies. The section aims to identify gaps
    and propose solutions for seamless integration across the automated irrigation
    management pipeline, from data collection and transmission to processing, analysis,
    decision-making, and automated action.


    **Subsection Title**


    5.1 Real-Time Generation of Actionable Irrigation Insights


    **Point Focus**


    - Integration of IoT sensor data (e.g., soil moisture probes, weather stations)
    and cloud-based data sources (e.g., weather forecasts, satellite imagery) using
    data fusion techniques (e.g., Kalman filtering) to enhance insight accuracy and
    resolution.


    - Combining optical and thermal sensors can improve the assessment of the agronomic
    parameters studied (R2 increased by 23 % and RMSE decreased by 8 %).


    Using meteorological data to parameterize crop simulation models to simulate water
    conditions in the root zone and predict the future evolution of the crop water
    status.


    - Development of ML models (e.g., random forests, neural networks) for real-time
    prediction of crop water requirements based on sensor data and historical irrigation
    data. These models should be interpretable and explainable to ensure trust and
    adoption by farmers.


    - The new methodology proposed focuses on the use of two indicators obtained from
    thermal and optical information, the water deficit index (WDI) and the canopy
    chlorophyll content index (CCCI). The combination of both sensors has successfully
    been used to improve the assessment of agronomic variables, such as grain yield,
    grain nitrogen concentration, and nitrogen nutrition index.


    **Limitations**


    - Specific approaches remain necessary for optimizing the use of optical and thermal
    sensors to determine the different performances between genotypes, allowing N
    fertilization to be adjusted to crop demand.


    - Further research should investigate the robustness of ML models under varying
    environmental conditions and crop growth stages, and explore the potential of
    transfer learning to adapt models to different regions and crops.


    - The implementation of automated irrigation systems may require additional infrastructure
    and connectivity, which can be a barrier to adoption, especially for smallholder
    farmers in developing regions.


    - There is a need for standardized protocols for data collection, processing,
    and model development to ensure the interoperability and reproducibility of automated
    irrigation systems.

  explanation: The authors have proposed a method to estimate leaf nitrogen content
    by integrating IoT sensor data and ML techniques. They first use a hybrid approach
    to select the most suitable vegetation indices for estimating leaf nitrogen content,
    and then use these indices as input features for an artificial neural network
    (ANN) model. The ANN model is trained and validated using a dataset of leaf nitrogen
    content measurements and corresponding sensor data. The trained ANN model is then
    used to estimate leaf nitrogen content for the entire field. The authors evaluate
    the performance of their method using various metrics and report that it achieves
    high accuracy in estimating leaf nitrogen content.
  extract_1: The hybrid method of R-Square (R2) and Variable Importance Projection
    (VIP) followed by Variance Inflation Factor was used to limit the best suitable
    N-sensitive 13 spectral indices. The selected indices were used as feature vectors
    in the Artificial Neural Network algorithm to model and generate a spatial map
    of plant N in the experimental wheat field.
  extract_2: The model resulted in R2 values of 0.97, 0.84, and 0.86 for training,
    validation, and testing respectively for plant N assessment.

    Communications and Sensing for 6G and Beyond: A Comprehensive Review Wei Jiang
    and 14 more April 04, 2024 Next-generation cellular technologies, commonly referred
    to as the sixth generation (6G), are envisioned to support a higher system capacity,
    better performance, and network sensing capabilities. The terahertz (THz) band
    is one potential enabler to this end due to the large unused frequency bands and
    the high spatial resolution enabled by the short signal wavelength and large bandwidth.
    Different from earlier surveys, this paper presents a comprehensive treatment
    and technology survey on THz communications and sensing in terms of advantages,
    Rapid Feasibility Assessment of Energy Unit Integration in Distribution Networks
    Sicheng Gong and 2 more April 03, 2024 In contemporary heavy-load distribution
    networks, preceding feasibility assessment is imperative before incorporating
    additional energy units. However, the feasibility examination for massive combined
    operational scenarios of relevant units is computationally intensive with repetitive
    power flow calculations. To this end, this paper proposes a rapid assessment framework,
    the kernel of which is to learn from formerly examined scenarios, thus forming
    expansive feasible/infeasible regions to geometrically rule in/out subsequent
    scenarios. Without running the power flow computation in most scenarios, we accelerate
    the assessment process. Moreover, enlightened by heuristic hypersurface search,
    such prechecking efficiency can be further boosted. In a risk-averse manner, this
    framework can be conceptualized using the exact grid model. Especially, evidenced
    by testing on a 10.5kV distribution grid, the framework shows a significant assessment
    efficiency improvement and strict accuracy guarantee, where we observe at least
    76.13% assessment time reduction and zero accuracy loss in all testing cases.
    We anticipate this work to be a starting point for more sophisticated geometry-accelerating
    feasibility assessment methods. Improving Molecular De Novo Drug Design with Transformers
    Dhaval Soni and 7 more April 03, 2024 Drug design is undergoing a transformation
    as we challenge conventional methods by integrating state-of-the-art artificial
    intelligence with the intricate domain of molecular biology. At the heart of our
    endeavor lies a significant challenge: the scarcity of datasets containing active
    compounds for emerging target proteins. To confront this obstacle, we''re pioneering
    an innovative approach. We''re merging the advanced Generative Pre-trained Transformer
    (GPT) architecture with the nuanced capabilities of Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)
    networks, with the aim of generating Simplified Molecular Input Line Entry System
    (SMILES) strings to unveil novel therapeutic pathways. Additionally, we''re employing
    a Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT) pretraining strategy
    to enrich our model with comprehensive molecular data, including amino acid sequences
    and molecular SMILES datasets. Through meticulous fine-tuning on a meticulously
    curated protein-ligand complex dataset, we''re achieving precise conditional generation
    via autoregressive supervised learning. Our research introduces a groundbreaking
    method to assess molecular affinity, validated against established proteins, showcasing
    superior binding affinities compared to certain FDA-approved drugs in docking
    experiments. By pushing the boundaries of generative algorithms and establishing
    a robust framework for evaluating molecular affinity, we''re driving forward the
    field of de novo drug design, offering promising therapeutic avenues and enabling
    deeper exploration of the chemical landscape. Formalising a Gateway-based Blockchain

    Behavior of NO Fe-Si Sheets under Tensile and Compressive Stress Carlo Appino
    and 6 more April 03, 2024 The stress dependence of the magnetic properties of
    non-oriented Fe-Si steel sheets has been investigated by measurement and analysis
    of hysteresis loop, magnetization curve, and energy losses taken at different
    peak polarization values Jp (0.5 T – 1.5 T) between DC and f = 400 Hz. The salient
    feature of the material response to the stress lies in the monotonic deterioration
    of the soft magnetic properties, across the whole (Jp - f) domain, on passing
    from the maximum tensile stress (σ = +30 MPa) to the maximum compression (σ =
    -30 MPa). This is understood in terms of stress-induced redistribution of the
    domains between easy axes, making magnetic hardening by compression directly related
    to unfavorably directed domains and 90° domain-wallmediated magnetization transitions.
    The loss decomposition is carried out across the whole investigated frequency
    range, taking into account the skin effect at the highest frequencies. Quasi-static
    and dynamic losses follow a same trend with σ, both monotonically increasing on
    passing from the tensile to the compressive stress limits, according to the theoretically
    expected relationship existing between the hysteresis and the excess loss components.
    The latter is shown to identify the correlation regions where the magnetization
    is reversed of size comparable with the average grain size and loosely following
    the dependence of the loss figure on the applied stress. A bio-inspired hardware
    implementation of an analog spike-based hippocampus memory mo... Daniel Casanueva-Morato
    and 4 more April 03, 2024 The need for processing at the edge the increasing amount
    of data that is being produced by multitudes of sensors has led to the demand
    for mode power efficient computational systems, by exploring alternative computing
    paradigms and technologies. Neuromorphic engineering is a promising approach that
    can address this need by developing electronic systems that faithfully emulate
    the computational properties of animal brains. In particular, the hippocampus
    stands out as one of the most relevant brain region for implementing auto associative
    memories capable of learning large amounts of information quickly and recalling
    it efficiently. In this work, we present a computational spike-based memory model
    inspired by the hippocampus that takes advantage of the features of analog electronic
    circuits: energy efficiency, compactness, and real-time operation. This model
    can learn memories, recall them from a partial fragment and forget. It has been
    implemented as a Spiking Neural Networks directly on a mixed-signal neuromorphic
    chip. We describe the details of the hardware implementation and demonstrate its
    operation via a series of benchmark experiments, showing how this research prototype
    paves the way for the development of future robust and low-power mixed-signal
    neuromorphic processing systems. Exploratory Study of oneM2M-based Interoperability
    Architectures for IoT: A Smart Cit... VJS Pranavasri and 6 more April 03, 2024
    The advent of the Internet of Things (IoT) has ushered in transformative possibilities
    for smart cities, with the potential to revolutionize urban living through enhanced
    connectivity and data-driven decision-making. However, the effective realization
    of IoT in smart cities hinges upon the seamless interoperability of diverse devices
    and systems. To address this critical need, the oneM2M standards initiative has
    emerged as a foundational framework for IoT interoperability. In this research
    paper, we perform an exploratory analysis of three prominent open-source oneM2M
    based interoperability systems-Mobius, OM2M, and ACME. We leverage an existing
    large-scale system provided by our Smart City Living Lab deployed at IIIT Hyderabad,
    sprawling a 66-acre campus featuring over 370 nodes across eight verticals. We
    investigate the architectural characteristics of each solution, considering their
    strengths and limitations in facilitating IoT interoperability. Through this analysis,
    our paper aims to provide valuable insights for stakeholders seeking to implement
    IoT interoperability solutions in the context of smart cities. By evaluating the
    strengths and limitations of Mobius, OM2M, and ACME, we seek to offer guidance
    for selecting the most suitable solution. Our analysis reveals that the optimal
    framework choice depends on specific quality constraints: Mobius excels in performance,
    while ACME offers advantages in ease of setup for smaller-scale implementations.
    Comparing Concepts of Service Blocking Queues in Hardware-in-the-Loop Systems
    Tobias Konheiser and 3 more April 03, 2024 ZF is developing an autonomous driving
    system, which requires extensive testing of the developed devices and software
    on hardware-in-the-loop (HIL) systems. Therefore, a robust and high-performing
    HIL system is essential. The purpose of a HIL system is to replay recorded data
    to the device-undertest. Recordings are loaded, processed and streamed to the
    deviceunder-test with real-time requirements. This streaming chain includes processing
    nodes and queues. This requires careful management of queue configurations. An
    overflow in the queue will result in packet loss, while an underflow may violate
    the real-time constraint. This study aims to develop and evaluate concepts for
    service blocking queues. These concepts block or pause the incoming service to
    a queue when necessary to avoid queue overflows and associated data loss. However,
    an out-of-the-box solution is not available and different approaches affect the
    behaviour and performance of the system. Therefore, the developed concepts are
    evaluated against each other and against the existing system based on selected
    performance parameters in specific scenarios. The scenarios cover a wide range
    of situations, reflecting standard input data with varying numbers of parallel
    streams and bottleneck scenarios forcing queue overflows or blockages. The developed
    service blocking queue concepts eliminate data loss in all scenarios, but introduce
    overhead, resulting in reduced system performance. However, the service blocking
    queue concept using a modified token-bucket approach proved to be the best solution,
    as the elimination of data loss justifies the additional overhead. This concept
    is proposed for implementation and deployment on the HIL system. Generative AI-Based
    Text Generation Methods Using Pre-Trained GPT 2 Model Rohit Pandey and 7 more
    April 03, 2024 A text generation model is a machine learning model that uses neural
    networks, especially transformers architecture to generate contextually relevant
    text based on linguistic patterns learned from extensive corpora. The models are
    trained on a huge amount of textual data so that they can model and learn complex
    concepts of any language like its grammar, vocabulary, phrases, and styles. FlowDep
    - An efficient and optical-flow-based algorithm of obstacle detection for aut...
    Chen-Fu Yeh and 7 more April 03, 2024 Obstacle detection is crucial for the safety
    and efficiency of autonomous vehicles. For mini-vehicles such as palm-sized drones,
    it is a challenge to implement traditional methods like Lidar due to high costs
    and physical constraints. Vision-based deep learning approaches, while accurate,
    are too resource-intensive for the mini-vehicles. To address this issue, we introduce
    Flowdep, a novel optical-flow-based algorithm inspired by the low-resolution but
    efficient motion-detection mechanisms in insects. Flowdep combines optic flow
    and IMU (or positioning information) to estimate the depth of every image pixel.
    We also generate a variant of Flowdep using the artificial neural network (Flowdep-ANN).
    Our tests show that Flowdep and Flowdep-ANN are 5.8 to 114.7 times faster than
    the DNN networks we tested, while the accuracies of Flowdep and Flowdep-ANN are
    on par with these networks. We further tested Flowdep and Flowdep-ANN on a small
    autonomous vehicle with Raspberry Pi4 as the computing platform, and both models
    successfully performed real-time object detection. The present work demonstrates
    the potential of using optical flow as an efficient approach to estimate depth
    and detect obstacles in resource-constrained mini-vehicles. Misinformative Data
    Visualizations in the Sports Media Domain Drew Scott April 03, 2024 Sports are
    data-driven: individual performances are measured using statistics and teams leverage
    data analytics to outperform competition. Sports media-which is created by media
    outlets, teams, and individuals-engage its consumers by creating narratives about
    the sport, teams, and players. Due to the importance of data in the sports world,
    data visualizations are a pillar in the sports media landscape. These data visualizations,
    while appearing to accurately convey data to its consumers, can be misinformative;
    media creators often have incentives to present specific narratives which don''t
    always fit the data. This work contributes to an existing misinformative data
    visualization taxonomy. In doing so, it makes it easier to understand the techniques
    and design choices used to create misinformative visualizations in all domains,
    not only in sports media. A Survey of RFID Authentication Protocols Drew Scott
    April 03, 2024 "Radio frequency identification" (RFID) systems are ubiquitous
    in today''s world. In an RFID system, it is a desirable to attain mutual authentication
    between a reader and a tag before commencing application-level communications.
    This is because tags should not share secret information with unknown parties
    and readers need to defend against tag impersonation. Authentication protocols
    designed for communication between computers, however, are not appropriate for
    RFID systems because tags are extremely resource constrained (low energy, small
    memory, etc.). Thus, there have been many attempts to design secure and practical
    authentication protocols for RFID systems over the years since RFID systems became
    prevalent. This survey summarizes and compares these protocols. The Effect of
    Multipath in Distributed Arrays with Time Reversal Hassna Ouassal and 2 more April
    03, 2024 This article examines the effect of multipath channels on the performance
    of distributed arrays that employ time reversal. A model of the signal received
    from a distributed array is formulated, and a statistical analysis of the variation
    in signal power in the presence of phase noise and multipath is given. We present
    the impact these nonidealities have on received signal power, and we analyze the
    received power for three specific cases: continuous waveform, impulse waveform,
    and modulated rectangular pulse waveform in the presence of standard channel models.
    It is shown that for larger arrays in multipath channels, the change in power
    between coherent and incoherent states converges to the line-of-sight channel.
    It is further shown that in a line-of-sight channel time-reversal completely cancels
    unknown channel delays resulting in coherent signals from all nodes in a distributed
    array, while in a multipath channel only the main diagonal round-trip paths are
    coherent. Nevertheless, this additional benefit improves signal coherence in complex
    channels and can aide in distributed array synchronization using two-way time
    transfer. Disproof of Hodge Conjecture by Graph Theory Jihyeon Yoon April 02,
    2024 Hodge conjecture is turned out to be false in extension of graph theory based
    on its algebraic attribute. Hash3D: Training-free Acceleration for 3D Generation
    Xingyi Yang and 1 more April 02, 2024 The evolution of 3D generative modeling
    has been notably propelled by the adoption of 2D diffusion models. Despite this
    progress, the cumbersome optimization process per se presents a critical hurdle
    to efficiency. In this paper, we introduce Hash3D, a universal acceleration for
    3D generation without model training. Central to Hash3D is the insight that feature-map
    redundancy is prevalent in images rendered from camera positions and diffusion
    time-steps in close proximity. By effectively hashing and reusing these feature
    maps across neighboring timesteps and camera angles, Hash3D substantially prevents
    redundant calculations, thus accelerating the diffusion model''s inference in
    3D generation tasks. We achieve this through an adaptive grid-based hashing. Surprisingly,
    this feature-sharing mechanism not only speed up the generation but also enhances
    the smoothness and view consistency of the synthesized 3D objects. Our experiments
    covering 5 textto-3D and 3 image-to-3D models, demonstrate Hash3D''s versatility
    to speed up optimization, enhancing efficiency by 1.3 ∼ 4×. Additionally, Hash3D''s
    integration with 3D Gaussian splatting largely speeds up 3D model creation, reducing
    text-to-3D processing to about 10 minutes and image-to-3D conversion to roughly
    30 seconds. The code is provided in https://github.com/Adamdad/hash3D. Area and
    Power Efficient Implementation of Configurable Ring Oscillator PUF Enas Abulibdeh
    and 4 more April 02, 2024 Physically Unclonable Function (PUF) is an emerging
    hardware security primitive that provides a promising solution for lightweight
    security. PUFs can be used to generate a secret key that depends on the random
    manufacturing process variation of the device for lightweight authentication and
    device identification. This work proposes an optimized version of the Configurable
    Ring Oscillator (CRO) PUF that aims to reduce power consumption and area overhead.
    The proposed design eliminates the duplication of ROs, reduces the switching activity,
    and introduces the inter-stage delay as an additional source of randomness. The
    proposed PUF has been implemented in 22nm FDSOI technology using the Synopsys
    tools. A comprehensive security analysis has been acquired utilizing Challenge-Response
    Pairs collected from 8 chips. Results show an average of 49.42%, 38.25%, 9.95%,
    and 45.5% for uniformity, diffuseness, reliability, and uniqueness, respectively.
    Compared with the state-of-the-art, the proposed design achieves an area and power
    reduction of 75% and 65.1%, respectively. With the proposed PUF delivering 10
    32 CRPs, it is classified as a strong PUF. Additionally, the proposed design passes
    NIST tests and achieves an average prediction accuracy of 67.1% of machine learning
    modeling. A Hero Or A Killer? Overview Of Opportunities, Challenges, And Implications

    model that can create videos based on simple user prompts. The model promises
    to revolutionize the way content is created. When SORA is released to the general
    public, it may transform a wide array of industries but also pose significant
    challenges and risks. This research aims to provide a comprehensive understanding
    of SORA''s opportunities, challenges, and implications. It explores its potential
    applications in film-making, education, gaming, advertising, accessibility, healthcare,
    and social media content creation. Additionally, it delves into its potential
    challenges and risks, including misinformation, privacy concerns, bias, regulatory
    complexities, and dependence on technology. This research provides important recommendations

    Experiments were conducted with a mixture of real world deployments and simulations,

    content Abstract In this paper, we design and implement an Internet-of-Things
    (IoT) based platform for developing cities using environmental sensing as a driving
    application. Since ubiquitous and free WiFi access is not available in most developing
    cities, IoT deployments must leverage 3G cellular connections that are metered
    and expensive. In order to best utilize the limited 3G data plan, we propose two
    adaptation strategies to drive sensing and data collection. The first technique
    is an infrastructure-level adaptation approach where we adjust sensing intervals
    of periodic sensors so that the data volume remains bounded within the allocated
    data budget. The second approach is at the information-level where application-specific
    analytics are deployed on-board devices. This use case focuses on multimedia sensors
    that process captured raw media data to lower volume semantic data that is communicated.
    We implement the two adaptation strategies on the EnviroSCALE (Environmental Sensing
    and Community Alert Network) platform, which is an inexpensive Raspberry Pi based
    environmental sensing system that employs air quality sensors and periodically
    publishes sensor data over a 3G connection with a limited data plan. We outline
    our deployment experience of EnviroSCALE in Dhaka city, the capital of Bangladesh,
    particularly in the direction of infrastructure-level adaptation. For information-level
    adaptation, our testbed experiment results demonstrate the practicality of adaptive
    sensing and triggering rich sensing analytics via user-specified criteria over

    monitoring 1. Introduction The emerging trend to incorporate Internet of Things
    (IoT) based smart devices and sensors to instrument communities and cities around
    the world has enhanced environmental awareness in urban regions. New smart city
    applications aim to monitor environmental conditions to ensure health and safety
    of the public at large. For example, effectively monitoring and managing air quality
    is an age-old problem that is becoming more important with increasing urbanization.
    In one study, World Health Organization (WHO) reported that global urban air pollution
    was increased by 8% during the period 2008–2013 [75]. Rise in pollution levels
    has catastrophic consequences to the environment - awareness of air quality can
    help individuals take measures to improve health awareness. In practice, however,
    the ability to gather environmental information in cities and communities at finer
    levels of temporal and spatial granularity is limited because of high deployment
    costs and maintenance overheads. The issue is further aggravated in developing
    nations such as Bangladesh, where it is not always possible to deploy permanent
    sensors due to lack of reliable, cheap and ubiquitous WiFi connectivity nationwide.
    The presence of low-cost sensing (in-situ and mobile) with improved connectivity
    options are required to make such services accessible to a larger community who
    can subscribe to receive the associated information. While some countries in South
    Asia (e.g., Bangladesh) are ahead in terms of 3G cellular provisioning [52], exploiting
    3G connectivity for continuous and autonomous real time sensing with IoT platforms
    can be prohibitively expensive. In this paper, we propose to develop inexpensive
    air quality monitoring solutions to accurately gather and communicate information
    to cloud platforms where the information can be further analyzed and acted upon.
    Due to the dynamic nature of the environment and phenomena being monitored (e.g.,
    toxic plumes in a fire), the proposed schemes must be inherently adaptive. We
    have developed a combined hardware/software platform that includes off-the-shelf
    sensors and compute platform (Raspberry Pi), along with a modular software stack
    to collect and upload data to the cloud. In particular, our work is an extension
    of an IoT based sensing platform SCALE (currently used for public safety applications),
    developed at UC Irvine [6]. SCALE was a low cost IoT platform without any data
    budget consideration, whereas we design our software to work with both cellular
    and WiFi connection with a data budget constraint. We construct an air quality
    measuring box, EnviroSCALE, with a suitable set of sensors for collecting environmental
    sensing data and uploading them over a cellular connection. Another adaptation
    strategy is to enable simple IoT analytics on board and send lower-volume processed
    information over the limited communication networks. We refer to this as information-level
    adaptation in this work. In particular, we employ container-based middleware to
    support a more flexible deployment of the EnviroSCALE IoT platform, where analytics
    can be deployed in a plug-and-play manner based on the type of information processing
    needed. With the ability to process sensor data on-board, we can now deploy richer
    sensing modalities such as video and audio sensing. Our work attempts to add intelligence
    in the IoT platform to automatically activate a range of multimedia sensors, such
    as microphones and cameras, for a more comprehensive analysis. We note that these
    multimedia sensors generate a large volume of data that can overwhelm the constrained
    data connections. Our strategy is to adaptively deploy media analytics on the
    devices colocated or close to the media sensors. Containers, fortunately, allow
    us to package the rich sensing analytics, along with any associated software dependencies,
    for easy deployment. The container based approach enables multiple usage scenarios
    to be configured and reconfigured. We list sample scenarios below: • Air quality
    sensors may report high PM 2.5 pollutants, and activate cameras and rich sensing
    analytics to identify the pollution sources (such as garbage, construction sites,
    and others). • Gas sensors may detect the existence of toxic or flammable gas,
    and activate cameras to identify and alert the persons in the affected zone. •
    Microphone arrays may report gunshots, and activate cameras for collecting evidence
    and locate the suspects. In this paper, we build a prototype system to explore
    the need for adaptation and demonstrate the practicality of our container-based
    approach for IoT deployments. The rest of this paper is organized as follows.
    Section 2 surveys the literature. The EnviroSCALE prototype is detailed in Section
    3. Section 4 formulates and solves the adaptation problems to meet the data plan
    budget. This is followed by the evaluations reported in Section 5. Section 6 concludes
    the article. 2. Related work The uprising trend in Internet of Things has inspired
    researchers around the world to devise various solutions using IoT. Various application
    scenarios, architectural elements and future directions in IoT are presented in
    [19]. The application scenarios are extent from home to community and national
    level. IoT based smart home automation. Home automation solutions are available
    in literature [33], [55], [58], which include Raspberry Pi (RPi) based monitoring
    and access control system for smart home [13], [56]. Vujović and Maksimović [74]
    identified RPi as a potential sensor web node for home automation. In [32], an
    IoT based smart parking system for smart community was implemented. Environmental
    condition monitoring possibilities were addressed in the contributions of [31].
    A dedicated IoT-based family robot based was implemented in [38]. Raspberry Pi
    for surveillance purpose is used in the works of [68]. Smart agriculture. IoT
    solutions are not limited to smart homes. Possibilities of smart agriculture based
    on IoT and cloud computing was studied in [18], [65], [80]. In [4], authors discussed
    development of smart devices to solve security and monitoring problems for agriculture.
    An autonomous percipient irrigation system was developed in [27] using Raspberry
    Pi. Another Raspberry Pi based solution for Green IoT Agriculture and healthcare
    was proposed in [50]. An intelligent agriculture management information system
    based on IoT was designed in [76]. Healthcare. Healthcare is another area which
    experienced IoT development. In [28], authors made a comprehensive study on IoT
    for healthcare. Being easy to interface with health monitoring devices, Raspberry
    Pi is popular for healthcare based IoT solutions. IoT based patient monitoring
    systems were fashioned in [21], [35], [36]. IoT based biometrics have also gained
    popularity in recent times [69]. The works of [16] uses KVM virtualization in
    industrial applications. Environment monitoring. Several recent efforts focus
    on the use of IoT solutions for environment monitoring. Among these, there are
    solutions to monitor water quality in real time [73], smart environment monitoring
    devices [26], IoT based urban climate monitoring systems [70]. IoT enabled air
    quality monitoring system was developed in [3]. All these four solutions [3],
    [26], [70], [73] were based on Raspberry Pi. A basic architecture and process
    for distributed air quality monitoring is discussed in [72]. Air Quality Egg [14]
    is a community driven sensing network hosted on Xively IoT platform that is similar
    to our hosting process. Among the commercially available air monitoring devices,
    AirBeam [1] is a wearable mapping, graphing, and crowdsourcing platform, and Awair
    [2] focuses on indoor air quality measurement. The use of Raspberry Pi as the
    core module in IoT system has its own benefits, as seen in and highlighted in
    [40]. It compares Raspberry Pi based device with other devices, and points out
    its flexibility in use and its ability to house a large number of external peripherals.
    These attributes make Raspberry Pi particularly suitable for use in air quality
    monitoring application. Another air quality monitoring IoT system that uses MQTT
    to measure and report humidity, carbon dioxide, dust, and air pressure is discussed
    in [37]. This system is installed in India and uses IoT IBM BlueMix, which is
    a PaaS (Platform-as-a-Service) provided mainly to enterprises. Another air quality
    monitoring IoT system that uses MQTT to measure and report humidity, carbon dioxide,
    dust, and air pressure is discussed in [37]. These IoT based solutions are plain
    implementations and do not consider any strategy to narrow the data volume or
    employ any virtualization technique. Safe and smart community. Besides other possible
    IoT based solutions in various scenarios, a keen and promising area to explore
    is community wellness. The Safe Community Awareness and Alerting Network (SCALE)
    [6] platform is an IoT system created in the context of the SmartAmerica Challenge
    effort to aid public and personal safety using inexpensive off-the-shelf IoT devices.
    SCALE supported data exchange between IoT content producers and consumers using
    a Pub/Sub architecture through the use of lightweight M2M (machine to machine)
    protocols such as MQTT. SCALE2 enhanced the basic SCALE platform with resilience
    capabilities including multiple network [61] capabilities. Similar smart community
    efforts around the world have gained popularity in recent years. For example,
    the Padova Smart City [78] implements techniques to collect temperature, humidity
    and light sensitivity data and store them in an HTTP-CoAP proxy server. AQBox
    [22], an earlier version of EnviroSCALE, illustrates the promise of off-the-shelf
    sensors for air quality monitoring. U-Sense [8] is a low-cost sensing system using
    sensors and wireless access point to upload data. Raspberry Pi as the core module
    in IoT system. The use of Raspberry Pi as the core module in IoT system has its
    own benefits, as seen highlighted in [40]. It compares Raspberry Pi based device
    with other devices, and points out its use in flexibility and its ability to house
    a large number of external peripherals make it suitable for use in air quality
    monitoring application. Among the previously mentioned solutions, most of them
    were implemented using Raspberry Pi [3], [13], [19], [20], [21], [26], [27], [32],
    [33], [35], [36], [38], [50], [55], [56], [58], [62], [69], [70], [73], [74].
    In [79], authors explored IoT applications using Raspberry Pi thoroughly. The
    works of [20] explained with examples how to implement IoT devices using RPi.
    Choice of RPi is also popular for building middleware [7], [49]. The necessity
    of a IoT middleware platform for managing distributed source of streams is recognised
    and discussed in breadth in [66]. The framework they propose to bridge the gap
    in the lack of availability of IoT middleware uses TensorFlow as computing module
    and Raspberry Pi to run the smart home applications to validate their architecture.
    A scalable and low cost MQTT broker and implemented using RPi was proposed in
    [30]. In [39], authors propose an architecture for IoT as a service and implemented
    so using RPi. Being so popular among IoT researchers and easy to use, EnviroSCALE
    was also built using RPi. 3G as IoT gateway. Having RPi as the base hardware,
    the choice for IoT gateway can both be WiFi and 2G/3G networks. 3G network has
    been identified as one of the promising IoT gateways in literature [12], [19],
    [82]. The works of [25] proposed an IoT framework that makes use of 3G networks
    for connectivity. Implementation of IoT solutions in various areas using 3G is
    also popular [15], [17], [29], [41], [57]. Although these use 3G for connecting
    to the Internet, they do no consider constraints due to the expensive 3G data.
    Container based virtualizations. With rise in IoT devices and envisioning that
    everything will eventually be connected to the Internet, container based virtualizations
    have been gaining its popularity for providing lightweight services. In [45],
    the authors compare virtual machines with lightweight virtualization technologies,
    and present three usage scenarios in smart cities. The authors of [11] explore
    container-based virtualization on smart objects for IoT Cloud scenarios. In [48],
    the authors develop a container-based platform that deploys several smart-car
    applications on Raspberry Pis. The deployment on in-vehicle networks improves
    the efficiency of the resources allocation. Morabito et al. [46] adopt two different
    lightweight virtualization technologies on a real IoT testbed to quantify the
    performance with and without the virtualization overhead. In [67], authors propose
    a container-based resource allocation scheme. In [53], a container-based PaaS
    architecture for RPi clusters was proposed. The works of [10] presented a three-layer
    container-based architecture. A new concept of Software Defined IoT Units was
    introduced [51] to provision container-based IoT cloud systems. Morabito et al.
    [47] implement a lightweight gateway using Raspberry Pi. The gateway contains
    two modules: northbound and southbound, for higher flexibility. The northbound
    module communicates over the Internet and the southbound module communicates with
    the sensors. Yin et al. [77] employ container based virtualization with task-scheduling
    algorithm and reallocation mechanism to mitigate the problems caused by devices
    failure and task delays. Brost et al. [9] leverage the isolated execution supports
    of containers to realize a secure architecture. Dynamic application deployment
    on IoT devices utilizing lightweight virtualization methods are gaining popularity
    [5], [44], [53], [54], [64]. Various container technologies are also evaluated
    in literature [42], [43]. With container-based virtualization, we could build
    process fast and easily to manage resources and diverse services on heterogeneous
    device. Most important, the overheads such as CPU utilization, power consumption,
    and the latency significantly decrease. Our earlier work [24], [60] advocates
    container based smart city platforms, that leverage centralized controllers for
    resource allocation. In the current work, we demonstrate the utility of automated
    rich sensing and associated analytics triggered by sensor readings. Adaptive operations
    in IoT. Several IoT systems focus on adapting operation based on ‘power’ very
    similar to the adaptivity of budget we are employing in this paper. In [81], a
    low power wide area network is implemented. AdaM is an adaptive monitoring framework
    for IoT devices [59]. In [34], the authors devised an adaptive rule based IoT
    engine for health data acquisition. An adaptive lossless entropy compressor was
    proposed in [71]. None of these techniques use virtualization. The key innovation
    of our work is to design a system that considers data plan constraints, focusing
    specifically on 3G cellular networks. The idea is to employ dynamic adaptation
    to collect samples from the sensors, without losing information content. This
    adaptation is essential to support resource provisioning for community IoT systems,
    where there are frequent changes in the sensing and communication contexts. The
    various adaptation techniques we will explore to enhance QoS and performance in
    such settings include support for layered virtualization images for reduced network
    overhead and event-driven application deployment. 3. EnviroSCALE: IoT platform
    for environmental monitoring We first describe the two adaptation strategies.
    We then describe in detail the physical sensors based EnviroSCALE box and then
    the container-based analytic modules and their deployment and management. 3.1.
    Overview of the EnviroSCALE prototype EnviroSCALE is a multi-sensor IoT platform
    that is designed for measuring environmental pollution through a series of gas,
    dust, air quality sensors. The platform is constructed to be deployed outdoor
    where WiFi connections may not be available, hence it uses 3G cellular connections
    to upload sensor data to the cloud. Since 3G connections are metered and have
    usually fixed data budget (dictated by the associated data plans), the platform
    needs to operate in a budget-aware fashion and needs to shape its data traffic
    matching the data budget by adjusting sampling frequencies of on-board sensors
    or data pruning (if required). Our first version of EnviroSCALE, namely EnviroSCALE
    box, contained only a set of physical sensors that mostly generated time-series
    scalar data. EnviroSCALE box only had infrastructure-level adaptations. Later
    on, we augmented the platform so that it can make rich sensemaking that can involve
    multi-media sensors, such as camera and microphones. The augmented version supports
    both infrastructure- and information-level adaptations. For example, whenever
    a gas sensor detects a poisonous gas exceeding a certain level, it can trigger
    a camera to capture images and detect if there is any human in the area so that
    she can be alerted. This kind of event detection needs data from multimedia sensors
    which are much larger than other sensors, say gas sensors. To accommodate sensors
    with large values, we instrumented EnviroSCALE with the capability of deploying
    rich sensing analytic close to the multimedia sensors. This enables the platform
    to send processed results instead of raw multimedia data over the constrained
    data connections. Since these analytics are application specific and may need
    to perform rich but arbitrary computation on sensor data, they are hosted through
    containers. These container-backed analytic modules effectively function as virtual
    sensors in the platform and generate event data, which are then uploaded over
    the constrained 3G connections. In this way, we do reduce the sensor data amount
    more aggressively while supporting comprehensive event detection. For the point
    of deploying the containers for these analytics, There are multiple ways to so.
    Mature or stable analytics modules can be shipped with the SD cards for Raspberry
    Pis. For experimental or new analytics modules, administrators may go to the proximity
    of Raspberry PIs and push the containers over short-range wireless networks, such
    as WiFi Direct. In the case of urgent, such as security, updates, the containers
    can be downloaded through 3G downlinks during the off-peak time. In the rest of
    the article, we assume that the containers are preloaded on Raspberry PIs before
    being launched. 3.2. EnviroSCALE box We give the schematic of the box in Fig.
    1. The basic platform is designed using a Raspberry Pi for control and sensing
    tasks and an Arduino Nano for additional sensing tasks. The MQ series gas sensors
    are connected to the analog input pins of Arduino Nano. The platform uses three
    gas sensors: MQ−4 for detecting combustible gases, MQ−6 for butane and LPG, and
    MQ−135 for measuring air quality (sensitive to benzene, alcohol, smoke, ammonia,
    sulfide, etc.). Two digital sensors: DHT11 temperature-humidity sensor and the
    Sharp GP2Y1010AU0F dust sensor are interfaced through the digital input pins of
    Arduino Nano. The platform also has a GPS receiver (GlobalSat BU−353S4), an HSPA
    + 3G cellular model (Huawei E303) and a WiFi dongle (D-Link), all connected via
    the USB port. The RPi runs on an 8 GB microSD card loaded with a standard Linux
    image and the SCALE software stack. The whole setup, when deployed outdoors, is
    powered by an external battery of 19,200 mAh capacity. Fig. 2 is an image of our
    the initial EnviroSCALE prototype. Download : Download high-res image (260KB)

    Fig. 2. Photos of our EnviroSCALE box. The software stack of the EnviroSCALE box
    includes a sensing and computation module, an upload module and a data publishing
    module (MQTT broker). A key adaptation feature in the prototype software stack
    is the adjustment of data capture parameters. During operation, the sensing and
    computation module adjusts the sampling intervals of sensors to ensure that the
    platform operates under the constrained data connection without loss of significant
    sensor information. This adjustment is done dynamically to adaptively change the
    sampling rate based on the constrained data connection. The module reads the connected
    sensors, converts the sensor data into a valid representation, and inserts them
    into an in-memory queue. An upload routine is invoked periodically to upload data
    from the queue (using the MQTT protocol to an MQTT sever). The upload routine
    also handles data coming from the virtual sensors (i.e., analytic modules) and
    shape the traffic to fit in the data budget (which we describe in the next section).
    As an effort to reduce data volume even more, the upload routine ties together
    data entries into a bundle and encodes them into a binary payload instead of using
    verbatim XML or JSON format, which are arguably expensive in terms of byte usage
    over a constrained 3G data plan. A central server is maintained that collects
    these encoded payloads, decodes them and publishes them back in a self-descriptive
    JSON format under a suitable MQTT topic name so that other users can consume the
    published sensor data. Any device that can be connected to the MQTT broker can
    subscribe to the topic to consume the sensor data. 3.3. Container-based analytics
    for rich sensemaking As we argued, EnviroSCALE hosts analytic modules running
    on containers to make rich sensemaking, such as event detection. Doing so, however,
    is no easy task, because the IoT platform is resource constrained, and the resource
    consumption must be carefully monitored, managed, and planned. To this end, we
    propose a centralized management platform for rich sensing analytic, as illustrated
    in Fig. 3, which contains a server on the left and multiple IoT devices on the
    right. In addition to the EnviroSCALE box, we also adopt Docker containers for
    dynamic deployments of rich sensing analytic and Kubernetes for management of
    multiple IoT devices that are heterogeneous in capabilities and locations. We
    assume near-by IoT devices communicate via short-range wireless networks. Next,
    we briefly introduce Docker containers and Kubernetes. Download : Download high-res
    image (207KB) Download : Download full-size image Fig. 3. Container-based IoT
    platform for rich analytic. Docker containers enable us to package rich sensing
    analytic along with its dependencies, such as run-time libraries and configurations
    into Docker images. Docker provides tools to simplify the process of creating,
    deploying, and launching these Docker images on heterogeneous IoT devices. Docker
    containers provide some protections via isolation similar to virtual machines,
    but docker containers do not contain complete operating systems, and thus incur
    less overhead. Moreover, multiple docker containers may share the same underlying
    Linux kernel for faster response time. Kubernetes provides tools to deploy, manage,
    and migrate rich sensing analytic as container images. It adopts client-server
    model, where multiple IoT devices are connected to a server and the clients periodically
    report the resource levels of the IoT devices to the server. Then, the Kubernetes
    server instructs the clients to launch appropriate Docker images on the IoT devices
    at the right locations. The problem of disseminating the Docker images over constrained
    data connections can be partially solved by the image pools, which are caches
    of Docker images. That is, a Docker image is sent to an IoT device only once,
    even if it is launched multiple times. Moreover, Docker images have layered structures,
    and thus several images may share the same lower layers. 4. Adaptive sensemaking
    under budgeted data plans In this section, we first give the architecture of EnviroSCALE.
    We then present the two adaptation strategies. 4.1. Architecture of EnviroSCALE
    Fig. 4 present the architecture of the EnviroSCALE prototype, which consists of
    physical sensors, virtual sensors, and event-generator. The physical and virtual
    sensors generate periodic sensor readings, while the event-generators produce
    event data aperiodically, more precisely whenever an event is detected. The readings,
    in most cases, are real-valued numbers obtained from the sensor at a particular
    time and location. Hence, all sensors readings, called samples, are timestamped
    and geotagged with latitude and longitude values obtained from the GPS. Compared
    to physical sensors, the virtual sensors and event generators are realized as
    analytic logics packaged in containers, so as to extract the more condense information
    out of the physical sensor readings. These containers are preloaded on Raspberry
    Pi, and then dynamically launched and teared down following the sensing demands
    and available resources. The core of EnviroSCALE is an Uploader Handler that determines:
    (i) the upload frequency of individual sensors and (ii) whether to launch or tear
    down containers (of virtual sensors and event-generators) under the constraint
    of 3G wireless bandwidth. The later decisions on which containers to launch or
    tear down are associated with some overhead and thus are longer-term decisions;
    while the former decisions distribute the data budget in real time, in order to
    provide as frequent sensor readings as possible. Notice that event-generators
    produce aperiodic sensor readings, which are transmitted once in a while and thus
    have the highest priority. The residue data budget (with size of aperiodic sensor
    readings deducted) is allocated among the physical and virtual sensors. Download

    Architecture of EnviroSCALE. As the platform deploys multiple sensors and each
    sensor may have a different degree of temporal sensitivity to their readings,
    they all may not be sampled at the same periodic interval, rather at different
    intervals. For example, LPG sensors can measure the level of LPG in air in every
    10 seconds (because it may change suddenly) whereas the dust level can be observed
    in every minute (as it may remain fairly constant in a certain area). These intervals
    are called the sampling intervals of the sensors (or sampling frequency is expressed
    in Hertz, the reciprocal of the intervals). Sensor readings also have a certain
    size per sample (in bytes). The sampling frequencies together with the sample
    sizes determine the overall data volume of operation. It can be argued that the
    overall volume of data that can be sent over a 3G connection is limited and is
    usually dictated by a data plan. A data plan is a contract between the 3G operator
    and a user restricting how much data the user can send over an extended period
    of time. For example, a 10MB per week data plan limits sending (and receiving)
    a total of 10 MB over a week period. Typically, it is up to the user to decide
    how to use this allocated amount; she may prefer to use up the entire 10 MB in
    first hour or first day or save progressively to use it throughout the whole week.
    Although a data plan is usually accounted for both uploading and downloading bytes,
    in our case we assume the data plan is for upload bytes as the upload traffic
    dominates in our platform. Given a certain data plan, it can happen that the total
    volume of data generated by all sensors when configured to run at their specified
    frequencies may exceed the data budget. In that, the frequencies of different
    sensors need to be adjusted: more precisely frequencies are adjusted to lower
    values. The adjusted frequencies are referred to as operating frequency per sensor.
    Given a data plan, the central question of the upload handler is as how to choose
    sampling frequencies for sensors so that the overall data generated during the
    data plan duration remains bounded with the data plan budget. We describe this
    next. 4.2. Handling data uploads under constrained data plans The data characteristics
    of each sensor i, (both physical and virtual) are described by three parameters
    as shown in Fig. 4: (Fi, si, wi), where Fi is the sampling frequency (and is the
    sampling interval), si be the size of each reading (we assume all readings from
    a given sensors are of equal sizes) and wi is a weight denoting the degree of
    importance of its samples, which can be specified by the application or can be
    derived from the sensor readings themselves. The weights also indicate the degree
    of sensitivity to the adjustment to their requested frequencies (if ever needs
    to be done by the upload handler). The aperiodic event-generators, however, do
    not have periods (hence sampling frequencies), instead they send data as events
    get detected. Since every data sending operation over 3G has an overhead, it would
    not be wise to communicate every reading as and when they are obtained. Instead,
    we accumulate readings for a certain duration and upload them as a bundle. The
    length of this interval, which we refer to as upload interval, should be small
    enough to ensure that we do not lose the timeliness of the sensed data and large
    enough to amortize the cost of additional transmission overhead while uploading
    this information using 3G networks. Given a data plan and an upload interval,
    the question becomes one of how to choose sampling frequency or intervals for
    sensors so that the overall data generated during the data plan duration remains
    bounded with the data plan budget. Let tuple (M, D) denote a data plan that enables
    uploading M bytes of data for a duration of D seconds and T be the upload interval.
    We split the entire data budget, D, equally across all the upload events. That
    means, the platform can upload at most ρ × T bytes at every upload interval, where
    is the upload rate (measured in bytes/sec). This definition of ρ, however, gives
    only the initial value of ρ as it changes throughout the operation depending on
    the total remaining budget. At every upload event, sensor readings are accumulated
    since the last upload event and the accumulated bytes are uploaded with an additional
    overhead of α bytes. This overhead is fixed for a data packet sent via network
    channel, in other words, it is the per packet protocol overhead. Therefore, the
    following constraint should hold for a platform with k sensors: (1) which can
    be reduced to: (2) Let so we have: (3) Writing in terms of sampling frequency,
    it becomes: (4) Therefore, the budgeted operation over 3G requires us to adjust
    the values of Fi so that the above constraint holds. If the constraint holds,
    that means the sensors can operate in their specified frequency and no adjustment
    to their frequencies are required. Otherwise, an adjustment is made. Let fi be
    the operating frequency of sensor i (instead of its specified Fi) so that total
    data volume remains bounded. Obviously, fi is strictly less than Fi for at least
    one sensor if not all. Since we intended to best utilize the data budget, we may
    want the constraint 4 to hold with equality, which gives: (5) As the sampling
    frequencies are adjusted, we define a loss function, Li(fi), which gives the perceived
    loss in sensor readings whenever the sensor’s frequency is reduce from the base
    frequency Fi. Technically, this loss function is a convex function over the difference
    between fi and Fi (the value of loss increases as the difference grows). The function
    can even be different across different sensors. We, nonetheless, assume a generic
    function: . Our goal is to choose fi so that the overall weighted loss over all
    sensors is minimized. We have: (6) The strategy we adopt to find the local minima
    is based on Lagrange multiplier. Introducing Lagrange multiplier, we have (7)
    We are to find fi’s and λ so as to minimize . Differentiating with respect to
    fi and λ gives: (8) (9) Plugging in the defined loss function and its derivative,
    we get the following solution for fi’s: (10) where Given (Fi, wi, si) triples
    per sensor, the upload handler computes the operating frequencies, fi, using Eq.
    (10). If we denote as the amount by which the data volume exceeds budget (A) when
    the sensors operate in their base frequencies, we have: (11) As we see from the
    above expression, frequency adjustment is done only when Δ is +ve, that is, data
    budget is exceeded by the total volume of data. If Δ is zero or negative, no adjustment
    is required and the sensors operate in their base frequency (Fi). Once the operating
    frequencies for both physical and virtual sensors are determined, now the question
    is how the upload handler realizes these frequencies in action. For the physical
    sensors, the platform would ultimately sample the sensors at those frequencies,
    that is, it would take periodic sensor readings at an interval of . For virtual
    sensors, however, this cannot be made because they operate inside a container
    and their operating frequencies can be hardly changed. Instead, the upload handler
    would take all readings at an interval but prune some data points (so as to match
    data volume with that of fi). Two options can be tried in this regard: • Each
    data reading reported from the virtual sensor may contain a measure of importance
    with it depending on the application specific value assigned to the reading. One
    way to measure this importance is to calculate how different a reading is from
    its previous measurements. When the system runs under fi < Fi, it keeps only readings
    with higher importance level and drops the lower valued ones. • When the system
    cannot find the less important data to prune or there is no important level assigned
    to the readings, the handler randomly drops incoming data items with probability
    which shapes the frequency from Fi to fi, which in turn would meet the budget.
    While the upload handler shapes incoming data received from both the physical
    and virtual sensors by adjusting their operating frequencies, what remains is
    to describe how it handles data coming from the aperiodic event-generators. Event-generators
    produce data occasionally and the generated data is immediately pushed to the
    upload queue (being ready to be uploaded in the next upload event). Once uploaded,
    the handler deducts the total volume of data uploaded from the remaining data
    plan budget and updates data upload rate, ρ, for the next upload event as follows
    (if budget and duration still remain): Alternative solutions for fi There can
    be occasions when the base frequencies of sensors, Fi, (as well as weights, wi)
    may be unknown, especially for the physical sensors. In that case, we cannot solve
    Eq. (6) to find fi. Instead, we are simply left with the constraint: which can
    have a generalized solution of the form: for suitably define weights where . In
    that, operating frequencies are given by: (12) We apply two simple approaches
    to determine weights to adapt data collection based on plan budgets: • Equal weights:
    In this, we assume all ωi’s are equal. Hence, and . • Proportional weights: Each
    sensor can be assigned an application specific “value” based on the importance
    of the sampling interval for a particular sensor: higher value means higher sampling
    frequency, that is, lower sampling interval. This value can be derived from the
    samples themselves as well. For example, samples showing lower degree of variance
    can be sampled at a lower frequency (i.e., at a higher time interval) and high
    variation in samples results in shorter interval. To this end, we use the co-efficient
    of variation (cv), of samples as a way of measuring ωi. Hence, ωi’s are given
    by: (13) where μi and σi are the mean and the standard deviation of sensor readings
    as observed before the current upload event. Putting ωi in Eq. (12) gives operating
    frequency fi. 4.3. Deployment and activation of container-driven analytics To
    dig useful information from multimedia data, we leverage the container technology
    running with diverse analytics to realize it. The analytics are launched in periodical
    or aperiodical ways. E.g., air pollution analytics may update pollution heatmaps
    every 10 s. In contrast to air pollution, some emergent events, such as fire fighting
    event are launched in aperiodical way. There are two possible ways to launch the
    analytics: (i) launching the analytics on a cloud server, which receives sensing
    data (image) from data originates (Raspberry Pis) for further analyzing or (ii)
    launching the analytics on Raspberry Pis and send analyzed results to the cloud
    server. Sending images to the cloud server consumes large amount of network resources,
    while launching all the analytics on Raspberry Pi suffers from limited resource
    budgets, such as RAM. Hence, we formulate our information-level adaptation problem
    to minimize the overall network consumption with RAM and network budgets. We formulate
    the problem as a ILP problem, as illustrated in formulation (14). This problem
    will be solved in every T ’tes. The decision variable is ai, which is a boolean
    value to decide whether we launch analytics i. Every analytic has its desired
    frequency Fi. Moreover, Z(i, ai) gives consumed network traffic of launching i
    or sending data to the cloud without launching i, where i ∈ J and J is a set of
    analytics. The objective function Eq. (14a) minimizes overall network traffic.
    Eq. (14b) ensures that the total consumed bandwidth is smaller than the network
    budget (rate*T) of our 3G cellular networks. Eq. (14c) ensures that the consumed
    RAM resources of launched analytics are smaller than the total remaining RAM budgets
    (S) of the devices connected through the same 3G networks. (14a) (14b) (14c) (14d)
    5. Experimental results We conducted three sets of experiments with EnviroSCALE.
    The first set of experiments utilized the real hardware setup deployed in diverse
    settings in a real city - Dhaka, Bangladesh; air quality data was collected under
    different scenarios and conditions. The second set of experimental results are
    derived from a simulation-based study where we analyze our proposed adaptive sampling
    techniques under various parameters. The third set of results correspond to deployment
    of container-based analytics and an application usecase of on-demand activation
    of analytics. 5.1. Data collection from EnviroSCALE deployment We deployed EnviroSCALE
    at different places of Dhaka and collected air quality data. We tried to validate
    our data collected from different contexts. For instance, we compared two datasets
    of methane concentration readings, one collected in indoor setup in a regular
    day and the other one was collected from a roadside with considerable amount of
    cow excretion, a large source of methane. Fig. 5a shows the histograms of these
    two, and it shows that in the later one, methane concentration shows a higher
    value, which should actually be the case. Fig. 5b and 5 c show comparisons between
    CO2 and dust sensor readings in different scenarios. Download : Download high-res

    from the EnviroSCALE setup. 5.2. Analysis of different adaptation techniques Now
    we present the comparison of the three adaptive sampling approaches. We wrote
    a custom trace-driven and message-level simulator to model the scenario we worked
    in, namely generating samples from sensors (actually replay of earlier recorded
    data), enforcing a certain data plan. The simulator mimics EnviroSCALE by taking
    the data plan (D, M) as its configuration. It can be configured to imitate variable
    number of periodic sensors (both physical and virtual), and aperiodic event-generators.
    In the experiments, both physical and virtual sensors use data traces from previous
    deployments for generating sensor readings. Aperiodic events happen as a Poison
    process with a certain rate where each event has a certain size. Table 2 shows
    a set of important simulation settings. Each simulation runs for 500 s with an
    upload interval of 50 s. The detailed simulation scenario along with the simulator
    code and data trace is publicly available here [63]. Table 1. List of sensors

    aperiodic 2048 Aperiodic Event-Triggered Due to the adjustment of sampling frequencies,
    the sensor data streams that are eventually uploaded differ from the original
    trace. In fact, the uploaded data stream may contain less number of data points
    from the original data stream . We are interested to see to what extent these
    two streams vary. Fig. 6 shows how the two streams are constructed and compared.
    When a given sensor reading is not uploaded—which we referred to as being missed
    in the reconstructed stream—the missing value is estimated by linear interpolation
    from the two nearby uploaded readings as shown in Fig. 6. The difference between
    these two values is an error. In particular, we compute the relative errors across
    all missing values and take its average. We refer to this quantity as Mean Absolute
    Percentage Error (MAPE), which is defined as: (15) where Tri and Rci denote the
    true and interpolated value respectively and N is the total number of missing
    points. Obviously, if all data points are uploaded, MAPE becomes zero, otherwise
    it takes a positive value: higher value indicating higher degree of error. Download

    Errors are measured from the trace and the reconstructed data points. We compute
    and compare results for three frequency adaption techniques. One technique is
    the one that adjusts the specified (i.e., base) frequencies of periodic sensors
    using Eq. (11). The other two techniques are due to Eq. (12) with “equal” and
    “proportional” weights. The results for comparing the trace of Dust with the collected
    samples are presented in Fig. 7. The reason for choosing Dust sensor is simply
    because data collected from this show the highest variation; and therefore this
    sensor is particularly more important than others. It is clear that “Specified
    frequency” method gives the least error. Among the other two, “Equal weights”
    is the better one; as we had already investigated in our earlier works. Download

    Effect of D on MAPE calculated from Dust. The reason behind “Specified frequency”
    approach performing better than the other two is investigated in Fig. 8. This
    illustrates the frequencies that were employed to sample the Dust sensor over
    the runtime. The frequency chosen by “Specified frequency” approach is static,
    and does not change. This is because the base frequencies of the sensors given
    in the simulation setting do not overflow the data budget, and therefore the stable
    frequency of 5 Hz is used throughout the entire time. On the other hand, the other
    two approaches do not care for base frequency, rather try to maximize bytes used
    (of course, by keeping within the data plan). Therefore, the frequencies given
    by these are not so stable over time. Although the other two are often able to
    operate with higher frequencies (compared to “Specified frequency”), the moments
    when the frequency is lower contributes to the comparatively larger error. Download

    Change of the sampling period over running time for the three approaches (D =
    200 Kbytes). It is important to note that these frequencies that were configured
    into the simulator were calculated by analyzing the data trace. We collected samples
    from trace using various sampling frequencies, and found that 5 Hz is convincingly
    fast enough for resulting in very low error. Thus, “Specified frequency” approach,
    with this little analysis, brings about a priori knowledge of the previously collected
    data into the whole adaptive environment, and performs better. We also outlined
    similar plots for this approach, in this case, forcing it to adjust its frequencies
    by allowing it a lighter data plan. Due to the light data budget, the initial
    frequencies are lower, but quickly rises close to the base frequency. For the
    heavier data plan, on the other case, the base frequencies do not overflow the
    budget, and thus the base frequencies are used through and through. Of course,
    this means sampling at a speed slower than we are capable of, thus resulting in
    lower utilization (Fig. 10). Then again, operating in base frequencies is exactly
    the goal of this adaptive sampling scheme after all. Download : Download high-res

    from various runs. Finally, we present Utilization, defined as ratio of bytes
    actually used, to bytes installed in the data plan (D), in Fig. 10. The purpose
    of this study is to assess if our methods are in fact capable of operating within
    the data plan, or they exceed it. Utilization for “Equal weights” and “Proportional
    weights” both exhibit an utilization close to 100, whereas “Specified frequency”
    shows a lower value for two cases. For the lower utilizations, the frequencies
    are not challenged by the data plan, and therefore the base frequencies are maintained
    altogether, resulting in lower utilization. We conclude this section by pointing
    out that for some cases, the utilization is more than 100%, thus exceeds the data
    plan. However, the extra usage is at most 5% and therefore, considered tolerable.
    5.3. Optimal information-level adaptation We optimally solve our information-level
    adaptation problem in Eq. (14) using CPLEX, which is referred to OPT. Moreover,
    we implement two baseline algorithms, called ALL and NONE for comparisons. The
    ALL algorithm launches all the on-board analytics, which minimizes the network
    consumption without considering the RAM budget. The NONE algorithm analyzes everything
    in the cloud, which consumes the network data plan budget the most. In our experiments,
    we vary the number of analytics |J|={5, 10, 15, 20, 25}, where 20 is the default
    setting. In each run, the analytics are randomly selected from two sample analytic
    applications implemented by us: sound recognizer and object detector. The sound
    recognizer is a periodic analytics application and the object detector is an aperiodic
    analytics application. We set the 3G bandwidth to 2 Mbps and T to 10 min, so that
    the network resource budget is rate  × T=2 Mbps × 10 Min. The frequency of periodic
    analytic (sound recognizer) is while the event generation frequency of the aperiodic
    analytic (object detection) is randomly generated with a mean of 1/T. We conduct
    a measurement study to measure the required network resources of the analytics
    for every analyzing task with/without launching the containers on the Raspberry
    Pi. The measurement results are reported in Table 3. We use the system model derived
    by Hong et al. [23] to model the RAM resource consumptions of our analytics. The
    RAM budget S={1,2,4,8} GB, where 8 is the default setting. We vary the values
    of D and S and conduct our experiments 5 times. We report the average results
    with 95% confidence intervals whenever applicable. Table 3. The network resource
    requirements of the analytics with/without launching the analytics on Raspberry
    Pis. Empty Cell With Without Sound Recognizer 708 B 61 KB Object Detector 709
    B 194 KB Fig. 11 shows that compared to the NONE algorithm, our OPT algorithm
    saves significant amount of network resources. Moreover, when the number of analytics
    is smaller than 15, our OPT algorithm achieves the same performance as the ALL
    algorithm. This however does not mean that the ALL algorithm outperforms our OPT
    algorithm, as explained by Fig. 12. This figure shows that the ALL algorithm does
    not carefully consider the RAM budget. When the number of analytic is greater
    than 15, the ALL algorithm overloads the Raspberry Pi, rendering the solution
    impractical. Fig. 13 reports the network resource consumptions under different
    RAM budgets. It shows that while the RAM budget is increased, we can save more
    and more network resources. We note that we do not include the ALL algorithm in
    Fig. 13 because it does not comply with the RAM budgets. Download : Download high-res

    on-demand person detection As a proof of concept, we implement a person detector
    on our platform for real experiments, as illustrated in Fig. 14. We use an Intel
    i5 Ubuntu box installed with Kubernetes as our Central Server. The IoT end devices
    have Raspberry Pi 3 as the base hardware, installed with Kubernetes, Docker, and
    EnviroSCALE. EnviroSCALE monitors air for toxic or flammable gases and once detected,
    it notifies the Central Server to deploy an analytic Docker image that would activate
    a camera, capture photos and analyze the captured images to see if there is any
    human present in the scene (who may be exposed to the gas and should be warned
    right away). Fig. 14 shows a sample detected person. The person detector adopts
    OpenCV library for processing images, uses TensorFlow framework for detecting
    the person and is packaged into a layered Docker container image. The base-image
    layer includes system software and libraries; and the analytic layer includes
    the analytic application. Through this case study, we demonstrate the practicality
    of our multi-sensor IoT platform: instead of sending an H.264 video sequence to
    the cloud for analysis, our platform only sends the image with the detected person.
    Throughout our experiments, an average of  ∼ 150 times of data amount reduction
    is observed. Download : Download high-res image (311KB) Download : Download full-size

    We study the problem of adaptive sensemaking with IoT devices over constrained
    data connections, especially under limited 3G data plans. We start with an adaptation
    approach where sensor readings are down-sampled based on the data budget. We further
    consider a more general container based rich sensing analytic platform, in which
    containers with specific sensing analytics are automatically activated once being
    triggered by some sensor readings. We demonstrate the feasibility of the usage
    scenarios on a platform built upon Docker and Kubernetes. We show that our approaches
    reduce data volumes befitting to limited data plans over 3G and are applicable,
    in general, to IoT platforms with constrained data connections. Acknowledgment

    of developing a real-time automated irrigation management system. The authors'
    proposed system uses an industrial IoT platform with sensors to collect environmental
    data to inform irrigation schedules. The paper not only discusses the development
    of the system, but also the challenges of such development, such as the need to
    accommodate intermittent or slow data transfer. The authors' proposed solution
    of an adaptive sampling strategy has direct relevance to my proposed system's
    need to collect real-time data from multiple sensors with varying data requirements
    while coping with limited, unreliable data transfer options.

    \ (A.R.O.)\nAbstract: With the implementation of the Internet of Things, the agricultural\
    \ domain has become\ndata-driven, allowing for well-timed and cost-effective farm\
    \ management while remaining envi-\nronmentally sustainable. Thus, the incorporation\
    \ of Internet of Things in the agricultural domain\nis the need of the hour for\
    \ developing countries whose gross domestic product primarily depends\non the\
    \ farming sector. It is worth highlighting that developing nations lack the infrastructure\
    \ for\nprecision agriculture; therefore, it has become necessary to come up with\
    \ a methodological paradigm\nwhich can accommodate a complete model to connect\
    \ ground sensors to the compute nodes in a\ncost-effective way by keeping the\
    \ data processing limitations and constraints in consideration. In\nthis regard,\
    \ this review puts forward an overview of the state-of-the-art technologies deployed\
    \ in\nprecision agriculture for soil assessment and pollutant monitoring with\
    \ respect to heavy metal in\nagricultural soil using various sensors. Secondly,\
    \ this manuscript illustrates the processing of data\ngenerated from the sensors.\
    \ In this regard, an optimized method of data processing derived from\ncloud computing\
    \ has been shown, which is called edge computing. In addition to this, a new model\n\
    of high-performance-based edge computing is also shown for efﬁcient ofﬂoading\
    \ of data with smooth\nworkﬂow optimization. In a nutshell, this manuscript aims\
    \ to open a new corridor for the farming\nsector in developing nations by tackling\
    \ challenges and providing substantial consideration.\nKeywords: food security;\
    \ precision agriculture; Internet of Things; soil moisture; heavy metal;\nwireless\
    \ sensors; edge computing\n1. Introduction\nThe agricultural sector in developing\
    \ countries has multiple challenges, i.e., if we\nlook at the production side,\
    \ the ﬁrst challenge which the farmer faces is the productivity\nchallenge, as\
    \ it becomes evident that developing countries are very low in productivity,\n\
    i.e., for any crop, the particular developing country could be the highest producer\
    \ but\nat the same time its productivity could be very low. Therefore, crop productivity\
    \ is a\nsigniﬁcant factor which has to be looked at. The second challenge which\
    \ the farmer faces is\nwith respect to climate change, industrial pollution, and\
    \ pest attacks, as they can damage\ncrops substantially. It is deemed necessary\
    \ for the farmer to mitigate those challenges by\nadapting to the latest technologies\
    \ and insurance schemes. The third challenge is related to\nmarket connectivity,\
    \ whereby the farmer produces crops and thus needs to be connected\nto distant\
    \ markets as per the crop production analysis and its subsequent data insights.\n\
    It is essential for the farmers to have all the information on a digital platform\
    \ and there\nshould be seamless trade between different markets and different\
    \ places. However, this\nAgriculture 2021, 11, 475. https://doi.org/10.3390/agriculture11060475\n\

    connection between farmers and the distant market is nowhere to be seen in developing\n\
    countries. On the other hand, the industry is looking up for exports, which in\
    \ turn need to\nbe streamlined substantially. From the economic perspective of\
    \ the developing country, it is\na boon if more facility in nature and regulatory\
    \ support has to be given for people who are\nlooking to export outside their\
    \ country or who are looking to have a value-added product\nacross the globe.\
    \ Now, this mismanagement in the agricultural sector can potentially lead\nto\
    \ food security risk.\nPrecision Agriculture (PA) is intended to help and maximize\
    \ the development of the\nfarming sector and will also help to ensure food security\
    \ [1]. It is to be highlighted that\nPA is a high-tech farming technology that\
    \ observes, measures, and analyzes farming ﬁelds\nand crops. With the advent of\
    \ PA, on-ﬁeld sensors can provide detailed levels of data\nfor problems of soil\
    \ and weather conditions pertaining to heavy metal toxics and climate\nchange.\
    \ Big data obtained from sensor networks and farm inputs tracking have a signiﬁcant\n\
    role to play to increase farm productivity, reduce environmental impacts, and\
    \ improve\nhuman welfare [2]. By combining artiﬁcial intelligence-based big data\
    \ analytics with sensor\nand image data, an integrated system could be developed\
    \ for the agricultural domain.\nImplementing intensive, high-value, personalized\
    \ management of crops would increase\nboth production and economic performance.\
    \ The aim of this paper is to highlight the\nimportance of smart sensors and high-performance\
    \ computing in protecting stakeholders\nin the agrifood value chain and providing\
    \ them with unlimited access to a large dataset of\nvarious categories in order\
    \ to track their farms. The challenges and consideration for the\nfarming sector\
    \ in developing countries are also highlighted. Figure 1 shows the number of\n\
    articles reviewed in various domains in the proposed manuscript.\nFigure 1. Distribution\
    \ of reviewed articles.\nThe structure of the paper is arranged as follows: The\
    \ ﬁrst section of the paper explains\nthe paper’s scope and the reasoning for\
    \ the proposed study. Section 2 gives an overview of\nfood security by taking\
    \ into consideration the pollution caused by persistent toxics and\nheavy metal.\
    \ In addition to this, Section 2 also highlights the importance of smart farming\n\
    based on IoT. Section 3 gives a detailed overview of the wireless communication\
    \ protocols\nand sensors used in the agricultural domain. Furthermore, Section\
    \ 3 also emphasizes\nthe importance of edge computing and also highlights the\
    \ model of High Performance\nComputing (HPC) on Edge. In addition, Section 3 also\
    \ details the various edge computing\nAgriculture 2021, 11, 475\n3 of 37\nmethodologies\
    \ used by previous researchers in precision agriculture. Section 4 highlights\n\
    the current challenges and considerations for the agricultural sector in developing\
    \ countries.\nFinally, Section 5 presents the conclusion of the proposed review.\n\
    2. Food Security: A Global Challenge in View of Soil Pollutants and Heavy\nMetal\
    \ Toxicants\nOver the next 35 years, the world’s growing population will demand\
    \ more food\nthan mankind has ever produced. However, food security faces a variety\
    \ of issues on\nboth the development and consumption sides, which would necessitate\
    \ further study\nin order to formulate a solution. The food system, on its current\
    \ course, would likely\nabsorb much of the remaining carbon budget if the temperature\
    \ rises by 2 ◦C by the year\n2050 [3]. As a result, it would leave no room for\
    \ other industries, making reaching the\nParis Agreement virtually impossible.\
    \ Due to severe weather conditions, climate change of\nthis magnitude would alter\
    \ what can be grown and worn, as well as the dynamics of pest\nand disease spread.\
    \ Food production shocks will occur, eventually leading to higher food\nprices\
    \ and civil unrest. Agriculture is important, but it consumes 70% of all freshwater,\n\
    resulting in one-third of all greenhouse gas emissions and the loss of biodiversity\
    \ and soil\ndepletion [4,5]. Finding new ways to sustainably produce more food\
    \ on available land will\nbe crucial as agricultural land becomes scarce. This\
    \ necessitates substantial assessment of\nagricultural soil monitoring and mitigating\
    \ the heavy metal pollutants and other toxics\nfrom the soil.\nHeavy metal contamination\
    \ is widely spread across the world, disrupting the at-\nmosphere and thereby\
    \ showing signiﬁcant threats to human health. The reason behind\nheavy metal contamination,\
    \ in general, is the rapid speed of urbanization along with\nindustrialization\
    \ and noticeable land use change in fast-moving developing nations such\nas China\
    \ and India. Post-Industrial Revolution and economic globalization, there has\n\
    been an unprecedented rise in the variety of environmental pollutants, with innumerable\n\
    anthropogenic sources. Therefore, this continuously evolving issue pertaining\
    \ to food\nsecurity has become a serious concern for the world, speciﬁcally its\
    \ inextricable relation to\nthe health of human beings [6,7].\nSeveral dangerous\
    \ heavy metals and metalloids comprising arsenic, cadmium, lead,\nand mercury\
    \ are categorized as non-essential for metabolism. These metals are considered\n\
    to be deleterious in different ways [8,9] and have thus been listed in the top\
    \ 20 list of\nhazardous substances by the United States Environmental Protection\
    \ Agency and the\nRadioactive Substances and Disease Registry Agency (ATSDR) [9,10].\
    \ With respect to\nmetabolic process, heavy metals, like Fe, Zn, Cr (III), and\
    \ Cu are considered to be essential\ncomponents along with enzymes and cytochromes,\
    \ which are inextricably connected to\nthe biota metabolic functioning [9,11].\
    \ With regard to urease, nickel is considered to be an\nimportant component; however,\
    \ it may pose an unnecessary risk to human health [12,13].\nTherefore, with respect\
    \ to the above context, soil–food crops and vegetation ecosystem is a\nwell-laid-out\
    \ example of abiotic–biotic interactions.\nHeavy metal pollution generated from\
    \ energy intensive industries poses a serious\nthreat to the sustenance of soil.\
    \ Apart from the ill effects on human health, heavy metal\nalso puts an adverse\
    \ impact on soil biota through soil microbe interaction and microbial\nprocesses\
    \ [9,14,15]. It also hampers the ecosystem when it comes to beneﬁcial soil in-\n\
    sects [16–18]. It is worth noting that medicinal plants can be used for bioaccumulation\
    \ of\nheavy metals. A prominent example of such a case is the “Paeonia Ostii”\
    \ Chinese medicinal\nplant [19]. Numerous medicinal plants are demonstrated to\
    \ bioaccumulate various heavy\nmetals, i.e., As, Cd, Fe, Pb, Cr, and Cu when grown\
    \ near industrial zones [9,20–23]. It is also\nessential to note that, even in\
    \ the greenhouse ecosystem, vegetation is susceptible to heavy\nmetal such as\
    \ Zn, Pb, Mn, Cu, and Cd due to decreased exposure to illumination [24].\nFor\
    \ a successful technological remedy, it is essential to understand the soil–food\
    \ crop\ntransfer mechanisms. In order to achieve this purpose, this analysis ﬁrst\
    \ discusses the\ndifferent causes of heavy metal contamination in the soil ecosystem\
    \ and its relevance to the\nhealth of human beings. In general, this type of analysis\
    \ gives an overall layout pertaining\nAgriculture 2021, 11, 475\n4 of 37\nto heavy\
    \ metal sources within the agricultural domain which in turn is correlated to\n\
    anthropogenic inﬂuences. It also helps us to provide state-of-the-art information\
    \ regarding\nthe global scenario of heavy metal pollution spanning across different\
    \ continents in the\nagricultural domain. In this regard, the next subsection\
    \ elaborates on the heavy metal\nsources in the soil–crop ecosystem.\n2.1. Heavy\
    \ Metal Sources in Soil–Crop Ecosystems\nIt is evident from numerous studies that\
    \ the source of heavy metals in the agricultural\necosystem is due to industrial\
    \ pollution, sewage sludge, phosphate-based fertilizers, metal\npesticides, and\
    \ contaminated water [9,25–29]. In addition to the mentioned sources of heavy\n\
    metal pollution, it is also essential to understand the impact of anthropogenic\
    \ pollutants, as\nthey pose a risk to the health of human beings through dietary\
    \ intake of contaminated food\ncrops which become polluted either through soil\
    \ or direct atmospheric deposition over the\nsurface of plant leaves [17,30].\
    \ Waste efﬂuents discharged from industries and automobiles\naccumulate in soil,\
    \ thereby causing contamination in the food chains [9,31,32]. It is also\nworth\
    \ noting that coal-based power plants pose a signiﬁcant threat with respect to\
    \ Hg soil\npollution. In this regard, Li et al. [24,33] stated the adverse effect\
    \ on human health caused\nby consuming lettuce and water spinach grown in Hg-contaminated\
    \ soil area. Likewise,\nmany strong sources present a grim outlook for global\
    \ food safety. Figure 2 shows the\necosystem of heavy metal contamination. Heavy\
    \ metals emitted from automobile and\nindustrial smelters are transported to distant\
    \ locations, i.e., up to several kilometers away\nfrom their sources by wet or\
    \ dry deposition [34]. These metals accumulate in plant leaves\nthrough foliar\
    \ transmission after the deposition of atmospheric particles above the surface\n\
    of the leaf [34]. Fernandez and Eichert [35] proposed that particles can penetrate\
    \ the\nleaf tissue through the pores present on the leaf cuticle and inside stomata.\
    \ Similar to\nroot uptake, foliar uptake of heavy metals may also arise in a dose-dependent\
    \ manner.\nNonetheless, one of the leading contributors of heavy metal penetration\
    \ in agricultural soil\nalso comes from sewage and sludge pollution.\nFigure 2.\
    \ Ecosystem of heavy metal contamination.\nTo address the concern of rising wastewater\
    \ produced from domestic and industrial\nprocesses as a result of the growing\
    \ human population, a reliable strategy and stable\ntreatment systems are urgently\
    \ needed. With the rapid growth of agriculture in the past\ndecade, overuse of\
    \ water resources, especially for agriculture, has become a problematic\nissue\
    \ which threatens to intensify the effects of climate change. Agriculture constitutes\
    \ by\nfar the largest use of water in all countries [36]. In order to solve this\
    \ problem, it has been\nfound that wastewater reuse is a feasible option to minimize\
    \ anthropogenic impact [37].\nAgriculture 2021, 11, 475\n5 of 37\nFurthermore,\
    \ raw wastewater reuse in agriculture is a valuable tool for developing coun-\n\
    tries to minimize usage of freshwater while also addressing the challenge of rising\
    \ food\nproduction in water-scarce areas. The beneﬁts of reusing water in agriculture\
    \ are numerous\nand unquestionable, i.e., it saves signiﬁcant quantities of freshwater\
    \ which may be assigned\nfor other essential purposes; it provides nutrients that\
    \ may replace chemical fertilizers,\nthus helping to increase soil fertility and\
    \ crop yield and reduce production costs; it allows\nfor the expansion of agricultural\
    \ land in dry areas; it is a relatively cheap disposal method\nfor raw wastewater;\
    \ and it can help to prevent contamination of surface water. In addition,\nit\
    \ has been demonstrated that the health risks associated with raw wastewater usage\
    \ in\nagriculture are satisfactory if its biological content meets speciﬁed standards\
    \ [38,39].\nHaving elaborated on the positive side of raw wastewater, there are\
    \ also possible nega-\ntive effects, such as soil salinization and groundwater\
    \ contamination of metals and organic\ncompounds. It should be noted that these\
    \ are only theoretical at this point. Furthermore,\nthe use of untreated water\
    \ for agricultural production is potentially dangerous due to its\nmicrobial substance,\
    \ especially bacteria, viruses, and parasites, which can cause a number\nof diseases\
    \ because many of them can be sustained for longer periods in the environment.\n\
    This in turn tends to affect the quality of the soil.\nIt is crucial that farmers\
    \ aim to keep the quality of their soil high in order to pre-\nserve the health\
    \ of their soil species. Soil microbes are an important component of the\necosystem\
    \ [40]. Soil fertility depends in part on the breakdown of organic matter and\n\
    the ﬂow of nutrients through the ecosystem. When they are subjected to stresses\
    \ like\nextreme temperature, pH, salinity, and chemical pollution, they are able\
    \ to negatively affect\nproductivity [41–43]. Owing to the variety of anthropogenic\
    \ activities, soil may become\npolluted with a variety of heavy metals from manufacturing\
    \ and mining. Many forms of\ncontaminants, i.e., from mine waste, sewage sludge,\
    \ chemical fertilizer, and pesticides can\nend up in the soil system and adversely\
    \ affect soil microbes [43]. As another alternative,\nvegetables produced in greenhouses\
    \ also become polluted by heavy metals, often from\nanthropogenic sources. Within\
    \ the source, detection of heavy metals can be performed\nusing sophisticated\
    \ statistical and geospatial methods [9,44–47]. Greenhouse vegetables\nin China\
    \ were more susceptible to Cd pollution than crops in open farmland [48,49]. The\n\
    results of the Principal Component Analysis (PCA) demonstrated that As, Ni, and\
    \ Cr are\nprimarily discharged from weathered rocks, while metallic pollutants\
    \ such as Hg and Pb\nare generated by industry, vehicle fumes, and reuse of wastewater\
    \ for irrigation [48,49].\nNonetheless, it is worth noting that PCA has been used\
    \ by several researchers in various\nagricultural domains for the assessment of\
    \ soil heavy metal pollutants [50–53].\nIdentifying soil pollutants and their\
    \ origins is important to research due to their close\nties to human health [54–56].\
    \ In this regard, it has become deemed necessary to come up\nwith tools and techniques\
    \ which can monitor heavy metal composition in the soil which can\nbe incorporated\
    \ into the smart farming ecosystem. Smart farming is considered to be the\nnext\
    \ key segment in the agriculture sector as it has changed the methodological paradigm\n\
    of how farmers operate on ﬁelds. The following subsection highlights the overview\
    \ of\nsmart farming and its beneﬁts.\n2.2. Smart Farming Initiatives Is the Need\
    \ of the Hour\nWith the advent of Internet of Things (IoT), smart devices have\
    \ reached into all facets\nof our day-to-day life, i.e., healthcare and wellness,\
    \ smart homes, automobile and logistics,\nintelligent cities and industries. In\
    \ recent decades, agriculture has seen a series of techno-\nlogical changes, increasingly\
    \ industrialized and technologically driven. Through different\nagriculture-based\
    \ smart devices, farmers today now have greater control over animal\nhusbandry\
    \ and cultivation processes, making them more predictable and productive. This,\n\
    along with the rising market demand for agricultural products, has helped to increase\
    \ the\nworldwide proliferation of intelligent agriculture technologies. It is\
    \ worth noting that for\nthe year 2020, IoT’s agricultural market share reached\
    \ $5.6 billion [57].\nAgriculture 2021, 11, 475\n6 of 37\nModern agriculture can\
    \ be addressed in several respects. For instance, AgriTech\nrefers to the use\
    \ of technology in the domain of agriculture [58]. In addition, intelligent\n\
    agriculture is primarily used to describe the use of IoT-based agricultural solutions.\
    \ With\nIoT sensors, farmers can make informed decisions and develop various parameters\
    \ of their\nwork, i.e., cattle to crop production, in order to collect environmental\
    \ and machine metrics.\nFor example, farmers can decide exactly how much pesticide\
    \ and fertilizer is to be utilized\nto optimize productivity by using smart agriculture\
    \ sensors for monitoring crop status. The\nsame applies to the concept of intelligent\
    \ farming. Figure 3 shows a broader perspective\non a modern-day agricultural\
    \ model, which incorporates various wireless sensor nodes to\nenable IoT-based\
    \ farming with satellite communication, where different ground sensors\nare deployed\
    \ which communicate with the cloud computing node for data processing and\nanalysis,\
    \ so that farmers can make correct decisions.\nFigure 3. Modern day agriculture.\n\
    Although smart IoT and industrial IoT are not as common as consumer-connected\n\
    devices, the market continues to be very competitive. IoT technologies are increasingly\n\
    being implemented for agriculture. COVID-19 has had a positive impact on IoT market\n\
    share in agriculture. Indeed, the smart framing market share is expected to hit\
    \ $6.2 billion\nby the end of 2021, as reported recently [57].\nIt is evident\
    \ that COVID-19 has made a signiﬁcant impact on the farming sector\nacross the\
    \ world. However, the agricultural sector is showing potential to make a strong\n\
    comeback by leveraging positive government policies which indicate adoption of\
    \ advanced\ntechnologies by making substantial investment in the agricultural\
    \ sector. This initiative\nwill make room for IoT-based agricultural solutions\
    \ as a prominent business strategy, thus\ncausing a reasonable increment in crop\
    \ production. However, in the current situation, the\nmarket is expected to show\
    \ a decline up to 0.8% for the ﬁrst two quarters of year 2021\ncompared to 2020\
    \ and this trend will show a positive growth from 2022 onwards [59].\nIn addition\
    \ to this, the smart world agriculture market is projected to triple to 15.3 bil-\n\
    lion dollars by 2025, compared to just over 5 billion dollars back in 2016 [60].\
    \ If the sector\ncontinues to expand, there will still be plenty of opportunities\
    \ for companies. In the coming\nyears, creating IoT products for agriculture will\
    \ distinguish companies as early adopters,\nthus helping to pave the way for success.\n\
    Today, the innovations on our immediate horizon include autonomous machines\n\
    which have the capacity to pluck and pick fruits and vegetables from the respective\
    \ plan-\ntation. A highly sophisticated sensing system includes microscopic sensors\
    \ and cameras\nthat help farmers track the growth of crops and warn them when\
    \ something is wrong\nor inform them of the optimum time to harvest. The Bonirob\
    \ developed by Deepﬁeld\nAgriculture 2021, 11, 475\n7 of 37\nLabs [61] can take\
    \ a soil sample, liquidize it, and then analyze its pH and phosphorus\nlevels\
    \ in real time. Researchers expect to grow and harvest an entire hectare of land\
    \ barley\nwithout humans ever entering the ﬁeld as a proof of concept for autonomous\
    \ farming\ntechnology. Companies like Aerobotics [62] already have commercialized\
    \ software that an-\nalyzes infrared photos taken by drones to detect unhealthy\
    \ vegetation, similar to a real-life\ngame of SIM farming in which the farmer\
    \ receives a warning on their computer when a\ndisturbed area is detected. Machine\
    \ learning is constantly improving the system’s ability to\ndistinguish between\
    \ crop varieties and weeds that pose a threat to the farmer. Furthermore,\nvarious\
    \ pilots are hired by Micro Aerial Vehicle (MAV)-based companies to ﬂy light aircraft\n\
    equipped with multispectral cameras on data-gathering missions over vast farms\
    \ around\nthe country [63]. Planet Labs has a ﬂeet of CubSat satellites that take\
    \ weekly photographs\nof entire farms from space to aid in crop monitoring [64].\
    \ To cope with this new wave of\ndata, other companies are developing analytics\
    \ tools to act as farm management systems,\nenabling farmers to work on a variety\
    \ of land sizes. Farmers’ business networks can now\nintegrate data from several\
    \ farms into one large pool, giving their members access to\nmacro-level insights\
    \ that were previously only accessible to corporate mega farms.\n2.3. Beneﬁts\
    \ of Smart Farming\nIn certain ways, technology and IoT have the ability to change\
    \ agriculture. There are\nﬁve ways in which IoT can boost agriculture:\n•\nData:\n\
    •\nLoads of data gathered by sensors from the ﬁelds, i.e., temperature, soil quality,\
    \ crop\ngrowth progress, and animal health can be used to monitor the condition\
    \ of the farm\nalong with the performance of ﬁeld workers and efﬁciency of equipment.\n\
    •\nImproved internal process management and therefore lower output risks:\n•\n\
    The ability to forecast the production performance enables farmers to become prepared\n\
    for a better delivery of goods. Wise decisions can be made if the estimated production\n\
    of the crop is known.\n•\nCost savings and waste reduction by improved quality\
    \ control:\n•\nIf any irregularities in crop growth and animal health are seen,\
    \ then the risk of losing\nthe yield can be minimized.\n•\nImproved business productivity\
    \ through process automation:\n•\nSmart farming can automate several processes\
    \ during the development cycle, i.e.,\nirrigation, fertilization, or pest control\
    \ with intelligent devices.\n•\nImproved consistency and volume of the commodity:\n\
    •\nGreater control over production processes and retaining higher crop quality\
    \ levels\nand growth potential by automation can be achieved.\n•\nHelps to mitigate\
    \ soil toxicity and monitor signiﬁcant parameters, thereby providing\nsustainable\
    \ agriculture:\nWith the advent of low-cost sensors for monitoring agriculture,\
    \ signiﬁcant parameters\nin the agricultural ecosystem can be analyzed to increase\
    \ the factor of sustainability, i.e.,\nassessing soil quality and monitoring soil\
    \ toxicity, water quality and its controlled usage,\nweather conditions, and optimized\
    \ usage of fertilizers.\nAll the aforementioned variables will contribute to higher\
    \ revenues. However, the\nbeneﬁts of smart farming can only be exploited if the\
    \ quality of internet is able to accommo-\ndate the IoT infrastructure. In this\
    \ regard, the following section discusses internet access\nquality in developing\
    \ countries.\n2.4. Quality of Internet Access in Developing Countries\nIoT provides\
    \ an environment in which objects, animals, or humans have uniquely\nidentiﬁed\
    \ data that can be communicated over the internet without the need for computer\n\
    interactions between humans and computer [65]. In 2015, over 13.4 billion devices\
    \ were\nlinked to the internet (as part of IoT) and it is forecasted that by the\
    \ year 2020 there will\nbe a rise in 18.5% to 38.5 billion devices, according\
    \ to Juniper research (Juniper research\nAgriculture 2021, 11, 475\n8 of 37\n\
    2015) [66]. Today, nearly every ﬁeld of modern society is being overtaken by IoT\
    \ [67]. The\nmain areas include smart health, smart cities, intelligent industries,\
    \ driverless cars, smart\nagriculture, precision farming, smart homes, etc. [68].\
    \ In this regard, it has been deemed\nnecessary for every household and business\
    \ sector to become connected with the internet,\nif we want to realize the maximum\
    \ utilization of IoT. Figure 4a shows the graph of internet\nusers worldwide on\
    \ the basis of geographic division and Figure 4b shows the subsequent\npenetration\
    \ rate till October 2020 [69]. It is worth noting that, although the number of\
    \ users\nin Asia and Africa is high as observed in Figure 4a, if Figure 4b is\
    \ analyzed, then it becomes\nevident that there is a clear-cut digital division,\
    \ as the penetration rate in Asia and Africa is\na mere 59.5% and 47.1%. In most\
    \ of the developing and underdeveloped countries in Asia\nand Africa, the agricultural\
    \ sector plays a prominent role in the contribution of overall Gross\nDomestic\
    \ Product (GDP). Therefore, reforms in communication technology are deemed\nnecessary\
    \ in such regions to incorporate the IoT paradigm into the agricultural domain.\n\
    Figure 4. (a) Internet users worldwide. (b) Internet world penetration rate [69].\n\
    Agriculture 2021, 11, 475\n9 of 37\nIoT has great potential and is one of the\
    \ main areas for future internet services growth.\nIoT problems are exploratory\
    \ in major IT companies and most countries. New uses of\nIoT are being searched\
    \ for and developed, but most work has been done in the ﬁeld of\nstandardization\
    \ of solutions [70]. IoT issues are included in the European Digital Agenda\n\
    (2016) [66]. As part of the European framework for research and innovation HORIZON\n\
    2020, more than EUR 140 billion is estimated to have been invested in IoT technology\n\
    between 2016 and 2017 alone (European Commission, 2015). In March 2015, the EU\n\
    Commission launched the Innovation Internet Alliance. The objective of the alliance\
    \ was to\ndevelop close cooperation on innovation and standardization of IoT (European\
    \ Commission\n2016) between the EU Commission, stakeholders, and parties involved\
    \ in IoT [66].\nThe fragmented existence of platforms and communications protocols\
    \ is one of the\nmajor problems of the present day, and contributes to incompatibility\
    \ problems between\ndifferent IoT devices and features [71,72]. IoT is well known\
    \ in precision agriculture,\nbut only proprietary solutions that lead to compatibility\
    \ and connectivity issues between\nvarious equipment are being used [73]. New\
    \ technologies need to be sought, based on\nopen standards and frameworks that\
    \ are compatible with smartphones. Many products\nthat are based on open hardware\
    \ at least partially are currently on the market and prices\nare considerably\
    \ lower than proprietary solutions. Therefore, by keeping the current\ninfrastructure\
    \ in consideration, the agriculture methodological paradigm can be taken to\n\
    the next level by connecting to the IoT.\n2.5. Embarking Agriculture on IoT\n\
    Farmers today have to face the biggest challenges in crop production as global\
    \ pop-\nulation grows. Therefore, it has been deemed necessary for the farming\
    \ sector to bring\nmajor shifts in adapting the latest technologies. IoT is driving\
    \ change in agriculture, which\nhas brought a shift in the farming paradigm. IoT\
    \ refers to devices or objects embedded\nin the sensor for the purpose of measurement\
    \ and transfer of datasets through network\ndevices, from pumps and tractors to\
    \ weather stations. In essence, IoT means that these\nphysical machines can transmit\
    \ and receive information from farms on devices using the\ninternet in order to\
    \ remotely measure all types of data and provide that information to\nthe farmer.\
    \ Soil moisture, chemical properties, dam levels, livestock health, and weather\n\
    details can be collected in real time by IoT devices. IoT devices information\
    \ helps farmers\nto track farms and accordingly helps to advise farmers to increase\
    \ productivity and yields.\nFarmers can also respond faster to farm conditions\
    \ and save time and money. Nonetheless,\nwith the advent of IoT, there lies a\
    \ major challenge in the processing of high volumes of\ndata generated from the\
    \ on-ﬁeld sensors. Therefore, researchers need to tackle this issue by\ncoming\
    \ up with cloud computing models synchronized with on-ﬁeld agricultural sensors.\n\
    2.6. Data Processing Challenge in IoT\nOne of the biggest hurdles of IoT is to\
    \ process large datasets in tandem. However,\nknowing what the data are, what\
    \ the nature of the data is, and how they go through\nare some of the key components\
    \ that need to be looked upon in this process. Gathering\nthe data forms the initial\
    \ stage, and the other factor comprises ingestion of data to the\nsystem from\
    \ the sensor. It is deemed necessary to understand that the data go through\n\
    all the gateways before entering into the system where the data are actually cleansed\
    \ and\ntransformed, which eventually leads to substantial insights. The big question\
    \ lies with how\nmany speciﬁc points of computation should exist. Let us consider\
    \ an instance, whereby\nthere is a drip irrigation system which ﬁnds that one\
    \ of the plants is not getting enough\nwater. Now, this delay could not be disturbing\
    \ for the system as the concerned person\nhandling the drip irrigation system\
    \ can come back the next morning and actually provide\nsome water or maybe some\
    \ other time it can be dealt with. However, in order to bring\nsustenance in the\
    \ agricultural industry, it is necessary for the farmers to understand the\nfactors\
    \ that govern crop growth by optimizing the usage of fertilizers and water. In\
    \ these\nkinds of situations, decisions are taken close to the actions or where\
    \ the data originate\nAgriculture 2021, 11, 475\n10 of 37\nfrom. Therefore, in\
    \ this regard, one can realistically conduct some processing for something\nto\
    \ be analyzed and thus, one can recognize some patterns and do some planning for\
    \ the\nlong term, accordingly. This gives a vision at a spectrum on a scale of\
    \ time as to where\nthe processing needs to happen. So, by considering all these\
    \ scenarios, it becomes evident\nthat not all the data are important, and this\
    \ is the challenging aspect to comprehend. This\ngives an insight of what data\
    \ need to be stored, what need to be discarded, what need to\nbe retained for\
    \ short-term purposes, and what need to be retained for long-term purposes.\n\
    Thus, all these are challenging issues that need to be addressed and that is where\
    \ storage\ntechnologies are actually highlighted. There are a number of systems\
    \ that are actually\nbeing worked upon; however, due to the lack of quality internet\
    \ access infrastructure in\ndeveloping countries, the feasibility of their implementation\
    \ remains a challenge. One\nof the viable solutions to solve this problem could\
    \ be via edge computing whereby the\nessential data could be ofﬂoaded from the\
    \ cloud over the edge of the cloud, and this is\nwhere the paradigm of smart sensing\
    \ with edge computing comes in.\n2.7. IoT-Based Smart Sensing with Edge Computing\n\
    Numerous embedded programmable devices have been utilized in recent literature.\n\
    Some are personalized while others are industrial programmable boards or full\
    \ sens-\ning/monitoring systems in closed-source applications. Researchers select\
    \ their equipment\naccording to the goals of each study or the main objective.\
    \ Business pertaining to sensing\nservices includes a range of features outside\
    \ the box to allow scientists to concentrate on\nother aspects of IoT de-planting,\
    \ such as meta-processing, smart tracking and monitoring\nalgorithms, cloud interoperability,\
    \ and more [74–76]. On the other hand, the programmable\nopen approach gives designers\
    \ versatility in monitoring the actions of the nodes and\nnetwork and in programming\
    \ new peripheral devices, such as new sensors or drive mod-\nules [77,78]. The\
    \ next subsections discuss various communication paradigms and wireless\nsensors\
    \ and nodes which are suitable to be used in the agricultural domain.\n3. Communication\
    \ in IoT\nDespite signiﬁcant changes, IoT still evolves, as can be seen from many\
    \ reviews, to\nachieve its ﬁnal form [79]. The conﬁguration of IoT is based on\
    \ three layers: a network\nlayer (data transfer), a perception layer, and an application\
    \ layer for data storage and\nmanipulation [80]. The network layer is considered\
    \ to be the physical layer of the archi-\ntecture, where the on-ﬁeld sensors and\
    \ actuators directly interact with the environment\nand gather data as per the\
    \ requirement. Technology such as Wireless Sensor Network\n(WSN), Radio Frequency\
    \ Identiﬁcation (RFID), and recently, Near Field Communications\n(NFC) are used\
    \ on the perception layer [79]. Correlation exists between WSN and RFID\ntechnology\
    \ due to semi-passive and active RFID tags which can also be viewed as lower-\n\
    computing and storage wireless nodes [81]. A wireless sensing node normally consists\n\
    of more than one sensor module (either external or embedded along with digital\
    \ sensor\ndevices), a processing module, typically a low-power microcontroller\
    \ unit, and a Radio Fre-\nquency (RF) communication module compatible with low-power\
    \ wireless communication\ntechnology [82].\nAt the network layer of the IoT, WSN\
    \ communicates with physical objects and their\nsurroundings, neighboring nodes,\
    \ or gateways. The network layer is also responsible for\nbuilding a network paradigm,\
    \ by using which the data are typically forwarded to a remote\nstorage infrastructure\
    \ for further analysis and processing [83]. Wireless standards which\nare used\
    \ to develop communication protocols, i.e., 802.15.4, bridge the difference among\n\
    the internet-enabled gateways and the end-nodes. These types of protocols comprise\
    \ Sigfox,\nZigBee, 6LowPan, WirelessHART, and ISA100.11a. [74,84]. In addition\
    \ to this, Bluetooth\nLow Energy (BLE), Long-Range and Long-Range Wide Area Network\
    \ (LoRa/LoRaWAN),\nand low-power WiFi have also been used in the network layer.\n\
    The application layer is the IoT’s third layer. This layer is responsible for\
    \ getting\ndata downloaded and delivering application-speciﬁc service to the users’\
    \ device via an\nAgriculture 2021, 11, 475\n11 of 37\napplication programming\
    \ interface. It is very important, and it promotes the realization\nof IoT in\
    \ several respects. The application layer faces a variety of unresolved suits,\
    \ such\nas system recognition as a unique device. Identifying and addressing billions\
    \ of devices\naround the world would provide them across the future internet with\
    \ direct internet-like\naccess and power. Identity uniqueness, durability, and\
    \ scalability are essential character-\nistics of the approach scheme [83]. IPv6\
    \ can mitigate some system recognition problems\nwith its aspects of internet\
    \ mobility and is expected to play a key role in this sector [85].\nThe heterogeneity\
    \ of the wireless nodes, diversity in data types, parallel operations, and\nintegration\
    \ of data from devices further exacerbate the problem [86].\nWhile numerous theoretical\
    \ parameters of the WSN have been studied extensively in\nliterature, practical\
    \ IoT/WSN implementations are very demanding for agriculture and\nremain a difﬁcult\
    \ task. Sensor modules must be sufﬁciently reliable, with the required mea-\n\
    suring range available which is protected from environmental factors that either\
    \ produce\nfalse readings or cause malfunctions in the system. As the IoT possesses\
    \ distributed nature,\ntherefore replacing the power source can be a very tough\
    \ challenge for battery-operated\nnodes in open ﬁelds or other agricultural facilities.\
    \ Consequently, very stringent power lim-\nitations inﬂuence the hardware selection\
    \ and the low-power characteristics of the chosen\nperipherals are often taken\
    \ into consideration when designing a new device. The software\ncomponents to\
    \ be implemented must be carefully inspected to incorporate the functionality\n\
    of a system. The ﬁnal function code includes a fully integrated understanding\
    \ of software\nengineering and adequate testing to prevent ﬁeld failures [87].\
    \ Other characteristics that\nallow an integrated, low-power system to be chosen\
    \ for use are its longer-term reliability,\nthe number of digital and analogue\
    \ inputs/outputs that reduce the number of peripheral\ndevices (sensors and actuators)\
    \ to be supported, the capacity of power harvesting modules,\nand the effort needed\
    \ to program the system.\nIoT is a dominant type of IT wireless technology in\
    \ the seven major groups, i.e.,\nthe Global System for Mobile Communication (GSM),\
    \ Wireless Personal Area Network\n(WPAN), the Cognitive Radio/Wireless Regional\
    \ Area Network (WRAN), Wireless Radio,\nmesh, Point-to-Point (P2P), and the Low-Power\
    \ Network (LPN), Low-Power Wide Area\nNetwork (LPWAN). Further GSM standard is\
    \ divided into GSM EDGE Radio Access Net-\nwork (GERAN) and Universal Mobile Telecommunication\
    \ System (UMTS) and Universal\nTerrestrial Radio Access Network (UTRAN) [88].\
    \ Many wireless devices are produced in\ncompliance with different wireless standards.\
    \ One prominent problem is the interference\nbetween devices that run on the same\
    \ band (for example Bluetooth, ZigBee, and WiFi) or\nadjacent bands [89].\nTable\
    \ 1 summarizes the IoT wireless networking which offers a wide range of band-\n\
    width, operating frequency, range, and power consumption. The various technologies\
    \ and\nspeciﬁcations as well as the discrepancies between IoT projects and their\
    \ unique criteria\nimpede network interoperability. Two very common phenomena\
    \ are high temperatures\nand high humidity when it comes to agricultural deployments.\
    \ Based on observations by\nBannister et al. [90], when the temperature increases\
    \ from 25 ◦C to 65 ◦C, it has a major\neffect on the signal intensity obtained.\
    \ Boano et al. [91] presented similar ﬁndings. In\naddition, humidity in agricultural\
    \ deployments can also be very high. For open ﬁelds,\nthe wireless nodes are exposed\
    \ directly to rain or irrigation systems. Relative humidity in\ngreenhouses can\
    \ also reach 80% for long periods. Dampness has been shown to greatly\nimpact\
    \ the distribution of radio waves [74,92]. It is necessary to take the specs of\
    \ the\nnumber of nodes into account, i.e., the distance between them, the antenna\
    \ height, and\nthe operating frequency based on the appropriate size of the messages\
    \ when selecting\na wireless transceiver for the agricultural purpose. The next\
    \ subsection discusses the\nsensors which are used or have the potential to be\
    \ deployed over agricultural ﬁelds for soil\nassessment and monitoring soil pollutants\
    \ such as heavy metal toxics. In addition, the next\nsubsection also highlights\
    \ the various wireless nodes and the associated microcontroller\nand transceiver.\n\

    \ Used Sensors for Smart Farming and Heavy Metal Identiﬁcation\nSensors for Soil\
    \ Moisture (SM) have been used in crop ﬁelds for decades to measure\nwater content.\
    \ The use of handheld/manual soil moisture technology is increasingly being\n\
    replaced by automated technologies, since there were difﬁculties in manual soil\
    \ moisture\nreadings in remote production areas. In the past decade, technology\
    \ has been developed for\nwireless data collection, providing managers and users\
    \ with real-time access to soil moisture\ndata, resulting in more successful water\
    \ management decisions. Some of the prominent\nsensing devices to measure soil\
    \ moisture comprise gravimetric sampling, resistive sensors,\ncapacitive sensors,\
    \ and Ground Penetrating Radar (GPR) [93]. Gravimetric sampling is a\ndirect and\
    \ normal SM measurement tool [94]. SM is determined by a proportion of dry\nsoil\
    \ mass to wet soil mass including pores. It needs the manual drying of soil samples\n\
    taken from the ﬁeld and oven sampling [94]. The electrical conductivity of water\
    \ and\nthe measuring of resistance changes based on soil water content are primarily\
    \ resistive\nsensors, such as granular matrix sensors. This method includes sensor\
    \ calibration for\nprecise SM reading.\nIntelligent irrigation-based measurement\
    \ to maintain soil moisture levels is signiﬁcant\nto improve plant productivity\
    \ and quality. On the other hand, soil moisture sensors these\ndays are expensive,\
    \ i.e., the ECHO-EC5 soil moisture sensor costs around USD 169 [95].\nIn order\
    \ to overcome the cost constraint factor, Wang et al. [95] proposed an RFID-based\n\
    GreenTag sensor to maintain and improvise plant productivity and quality.\nIn\
    \ addition, RFID sensors can be combined with biosensors comprising aptamer and\n\
    DNA-based properties which can be used to detect heavy metals at nanoscale and\
    \ large\nscale levels pertaining to food safety monitoring. A heavy metal detection-based\
    \ biosensor\nis composed of genetically modiﬁed bacterial cells and a green ﬂuorescent\
    \ signal ampliﬁer\nwhich detects the presence of arsenite in foods [96,97]. Its\
    \ arsenic detection lasts for an\nhour with a detection range of 5–140 µg/L. Other\
    \ methodologies pertaining to biosensors,\ni.e., aptamers and graphene electrodes,\
    \ have also been used to detect arsenic with the\npossibility of being developed\
    \ as simple and easy-to-use low-cost devices [97,98].\nThe EC-5 series sensors\
    \ were also used by Wu et al. [99] for ﬁeld-speciﬁc calibration\nand evaluation\
    \ in sandy soils. Nonetheless, EC-5 sensors have turned out to be helpful to\n\
    reveal soil water content dynamics in different soil depths post rainfall conditions.\
    \ The\nECHO series has other variants of sensors; i.e., ECHO-EA10 can be used\
    \ for medium\nAgriculture 2021, 11, 475\n13 of 37\ntextured soil type with low\
    \ electrical conductance conditions. In addition to this, there is\nECHO-10HS\
    \ soil moisture sensor which is a new addition in the soil moisture sensor family\n\
    and possesses high-frequency oscillation, which enables the sensors to accurately\
    \ measure\nsoil moisture in any of the soil or soilless media with minimum salinity\
    \ and textural effects.\nIn order to measure soil water content and salinity,\
    \ Zemni et al. [100] used 5TE sensors\nat different soil depths to assess dielectric\
    \ permittivity (Ka) and electrical conductivity\n(ECa). It is to be noted that\
    \ 5TE sensors are based on frequency domain reﬂectometry\n(FDR); therefore, they\
    \ use a ﬁxed frequency wave of broadband signal which makes the\ndevice cheaper\
    \ and more compact. Nolz et al. [101] deployed hydro probe2 sensors to\nevaluate\
    \ near surface soil water and determine in situ water retention function. Hydro\n\
    probe sensors are advantageous due to their linear signal response. On the contrary,\
    \ hydro\nprobe sensors are not suitable for sandy soils [102]. Udukumburage et\
    \ al. [103] used an\nMP406 soil moisture sensor to verify the saturated condition\
    \ of the expansive soil layer.\nThey also used this sensor to measure volumetric\
    \ water content values in the soil column\nduring the wetting and drying process\
    \ [104]. In order to maintain the indoor ecosystem\nservices, air quality plays\
    \ an essential role. In this regard, MIKROE gas sensors are used to\nmonitor the\
    \ air quality [105,106]. To evaluate and assess the vegetation change and study\n\
    physiological and metabolic response of corn ﬁelds and paddy ﬁelds, the Pogo II\
    \ VWC has\nbeen widely used [107,108].\nHu et al. [109] used Portable X-ray Fluorescence\
    \ Spectroscopy (PXRF) to assess the\nheavy metal content in soil for which they\
    \ covered 301 farmland soils from Fuyang in\nZhejiang Province, in the southern\
    \ Yangtze River Delta, China. Conventional methods for\nheavy metal detection\
    \ such as Atomic Absorption Spectrometry (AAS), Atomic Fluores-\ncence Spectrometry\
    \ (AFS), and Inductively Coupled Plasma Optical Emission Spectroscopy\n(ICP-OES),\
    \ are expensive and lengthy procedures which are executed in laboratories. There-\n\
    fore, these methods are not taken into consideration for rapid testing and high-density\n\
    evaluation of soil heavy metals contamination. As an alternative method for rapid\
    \ heavy\nmetal detection, Portable X-ray Fluorescence (PXRF) was used to assess\
    \ cumulative con-\ncentrations of soil heavy metals based on linear regression\
    \ models between ﬂuorescence\nintensity and speciﬁc heavy metal concentration.\
    \ Due to its ease of use and rapid testing\nability using non-destructive quantiﬁcation,\
    \ PXRF has been widely used by researchers\nin numerous domains [110–113]. For\
    \ the heavy metal assessment in agricultural soil con-\nducted by Hu et al. [109],\
    \ VNIR sensor was used to anticipate soil properties comprising\npH, soil nitrogen,\
    \ and carbon [114,115]. In addition to PXRF, NixPRO color sensor can also\nbe\
    \ used to identify hotspots and total spatial area in excess of environmental\
    \ thresholds in\nlandﬁll soils [116].\nLately Zhao and Liu [117] have developed\
    \ a Portable Electrochemical System (PES)\nfor on-site heavy metal detection on\
    \ farmland. Their system was composed of a three-\nelectrode conﬁguration which\
    \ comprised a signal acquisition system integrated with a\nmicrocontroller-based\
    \ potentiostat to perform square-wave anodic stripping voltammetry.\nTheir system\
    \ was assessed by testing the detection of pd(II) and cd(II) in acetic acid soil\n\
    extracts and acetate buffer solution [117]. However, their system did not include\
    \ any\nwireless sensor module to transmit heavy metal composition data.\nOther\
    \ than the aforementioned sensors, there are several other wireless sensors ded-\n\
    icated to: photosynthesis, i.e., Beta Therm temperature sensor; leaf wetness sensor,\
    \ i.e.,\nSLWA-M003; precision sensor for leaf temperature, i.e., ∆LA-C; light\
    \ intensity sensor,\ni.e., BH1750FUI sensor [118–122]. With the advent of these\
    \ sensors, CO2 sensors also\nplay an essential role, especially in greenhouse\
    \ systems [123]. CO2 sensors have also\nbeen widely used to measure the subsequent\
    \ level in peat soil, landﬁll, and forest control\nsite [124,125]. In the smart\
    \ farming ecosystem, the growth and quality of the fruit bunch\ncannot be neglected.\
    \ In this regard, there are dedicated fruit growth monitoring sensors\nwhich researchers\
    \ have used in their domain of plantation. Thalheimer [126] designed\nan optoelectronics\
    \ sensor for monitoring fruit and stem radial growth. Their developed\nsensor\
    \ was lightweight and easy to install with low maintenance. Nonetheless, the sensor\n\
    Agriculture 2021, 11, 475\n14 of 37\nwas well tested in open ﬁeld conditions.\
    \ In addition to this, the effect of gas concentration\nduring the fruit growth\
    \ was studied by Ma et al. [127], for which a smart ethylene elec-\ntrochemical\
    \ sensor was established to investigate ethylene emission from fruits. Lately,\n\
    Hanssens et al. [128] came up with a heat ﬁeld deformation sensor to measure sap\
    \ ﬂow\ndynamics through the tomato peduncle. Heat griddling of the peduncle was\
    \ performed to\ndifferentiate ﬂow of xylem and phloem with respect to developing\
    \ fruits.\nCapacitive sensors calculate SM on the basis of changes in soil capacitance\
    \ due to\ndifferences in water content [129]. Commercial UTs use capacitive sensors,\
    \ which are\nusually more accurate than resistive sensors but cost more [130].\
    \ Ground Penetrating\nRadars (GPR) [131] are based upon electromagnetic wave absorption\
    \ and reﬂection. SM\nsensing uses impulses, frequency sweeping, and frequency-modulated\
    \ technologies. This\nmethod is used for measuring soil moisture near the surface\
    \ (up to 10 cm). The most\nreliable soil humidity samples used in ﬁelds are neutron\
    \ scattering samples [132] and\nscattering samples use radiation methods for calculating\
    \ SM by estimating changes to the\nneutron ﬂux density due to water content of\
    \ the soil [133,134]. However, in such cases,\nspeciﬁc licenses are required to\
    \ carry out its implementation.\nNumerous research studies have been performed\
    \ to develop electrochemical devices\nfor various applications, which are known\
    \ as potentiostat [135–141]. Lately, an Arduino-\nbased potentiostat was fabricated\
    \ from cost-efﬁcient components and was able to execute\nsimple electrochemical\
    \ experiments, whereby the results were recorded and analyzed in a\nWindows operating\
    \ system via USB interface [136–138]. As an addition to Arduino-based\npotentiostat,\
    \ Raspberry Pi (RPi) controller was also used to execute the electrochemical\n\
    experiments, whereby the results were displayed on the LCD touch panel connected\
    \ to the\ncontroller [139]. Both Arduino- and Raspberry Pi-based potentiostat\
    \ have the potential to\nincorporate wireless sensors for data transmission; however,\
    \ these controllers do not con-\ntain a built-in Analog to Digital Converter (ADC)\
    \ and Digital to Analog Converter (DAC)\nwhich make the overall design more sophisticated.\
    \ In this regard, Hanisah et al. [142] came\nup with a portable Heavy Metal Potentiostat\
    \ (HMstat) to detect heavy metal composi-\ntion on-site. Their potentiostat comprised\
    \ a digital Control Signal Component (CSC) and\nthe electronic component, which\
    \ is the analog Potentiostat Read-out Circuit Component\n(PRCC), as shown in Figure\
    \ 5 [142]. Nonetheless, it is worth noting that both the Arduino\nand RPi controller\
    \ board do support the incorporation of various sensor modules. There-\nfore,\
    \ researchers have room to incorporate soil moisture and temperature sensors along\n\
    with other sensors depending on the slots available in the controller; thus, an\
    \ integrated\nsystem for soil moisture and heavy metal analysis can be developed.\n\
    Figure 5. (a) The HMstat consists of Control Signal Component (CSC) and Potentiostat\
    \ Read-out\nCircuit Component (PRCC) connected to the electrochemical cell (consisting\
    \ of Screen Printed\nElectrode Gold (SPGE) and (b) overall connection of HMstat\
    \ [142].\nAgriculture 2021, 11, 475\n15 of 37\nOther soil physical properties\
    \ can be calculated to populate the map of the soil with\nother soil properties\
    \ such as soil organic content, pH, sand, silt particles percentage, and\nnutrients\
    \ such as Mg, P, OM, Ca, base saturation Mg, base saturation K, base saturation\n\
    Ca, CEC, and K/Mg [143–145]. In situ, calculating these properties in real time\
    \ also faces\nchallenges due to scale, cost, and technology limitations.\nIn precision\
    \ farming, some of the long-lasting decisions can be taken using yield\nmonitoring.\
    \ This method helps in providing spatial distribution of crop yields at the end\n\
    of the growing season [146,147]. Yield sensors are normally mounted on farm equipment\n\
    and capture yield data automatically in the course of the harvest. In particular,\
    \ mass\nﬂow sensors on grain containers are mounted to record grain inﬂows along\
    \ with the\nposition [148]. The collected data are analyzed with tools such as\
    \ ArchInfo, Mapinfo, and\nEnvironment System Analysis International [149].\nIn\
    \ order to get an insight into the crop yield combined with ﬁeld topography, Electrical\n\
    Conductivity (EC) sensors are used [150]. Soil’s ability to conduct current is\
    \ measured\nby electrical conductivity. EC assessment is used to assess the use\
    \ of phosphorus, cations\nin water, drainage, and rooting depths [150]. EC maps\
    \ are used for zoning the area. The\nzoning is also used to incorporate precision\
    \ agricultural practices such as variable rate irri-\ngation, variable rate seeding,\
    \ and drainage management. Electromagnetic Induction (EMI)\nmethods can be used\
    \ for the mapping of the EC by apparent Electrical Conductance (ECa)\nand Visible\
    \ Near Infrared Reﬂectance (VNIR) [151]. There are a number of commercial\ntools\
    \ available, i.e., Veris 3100, EC400 sensors in conjunction with GPS systems [149,152].\n\
    In the domain of soil sensing, macronutrients such as nitrogen, potassium, and\
    \ phos-\nphorus are essential to the growth of crops. The evaluation of these\
    \ nutrients helps to\nassess the effects of fertilizer and potential applications.\
    \ The optical detection is based\non reﬂectance spectroscopy to measure the macrosimulation’s\
    \ reﬂection and absorp-\ntion [153,154]. A sensing system using planar electromagnetic\
    \ sensors has been developed\nin the detection of nitrate and sulphate concentration\
    \ in natural water resources [155].\nThis approach is used to detect the amounts\
    \ of nitrate and sulphates by correlating\nthe impedance of the sensor array with\
    \ their concentration. The key approaches to soil\nmacronutrients include electrochemical,\
    \ VIS-NIRS, and ATR spectroscopy [149,152,156].\nThese approaches to soil macronutrients\
    \ are limited to sensing a single desired ion because\nthe membrane used in these\
    \ methods only reacts to one ion [157]. To achieve a simultane-\nous multi-ion\
    \ sensing, it is necessary to build a detector array for the sensing of soil macro\n\
    nutrients [158].\nThere are several opportunities to advance the state of precision\
    \ farming through\nthe utilization of the above discussed sensors. The following\

    WSNs typically consist of a large number of nodes that run in a particular conﬁgura-\n\
    tion. Usually, autonomous and spatially dispersed sensor nodes collaborate to\
    \ track and\ncollect environmental conditions. Data can be processed in central/decentralized\
    \ mode by\nsending data to a sink that transfers them to other networks (e.g.,\
    \ through a gateway). A\nbroad variety of application-speciﬁc limitations is included\
    \ in the project, design, prototype,\nand use of a WSN.\nThe BTnode is a Bluetooth-based\
    \ radio module and microcontroller for autonomous\nwireless communication [159].\
    \ BTnode is equipped with general purpose interfaces which\ncan be conﬁgured on\
    \ the basis of application speciﬁc requirement. BTnode can be utilized\nwith several\
    \ peripherals, i.e., sensors, actuators, RFID, and GPS receivers. A promising\n\
    factor of BTnode is its compact size of 6 × 4 cm with standard wireless interface.\
    \ A pictorial\ndescription of BTnode is shown in Figure 6. The device comprises\
    \ an Atmel ATmega128L\nmicrocontroller with on-chip memory and peripherals [160].\
    \ The microcontroller demon-\nstrates an 8-bit RISC core delivering up to 8 MIPS\
    \ at a maximum of 8 MHz. The on-chip\nmemory comprises a programmable in-built\
    \ 128 KB of ﬂash memory along with 4 KB of\nstatic RAM. Other integrated peripherals\
    \ consist of JTAG for debugging, timers, counters,\npulse-width modulation, and\
    \ 10-bit analog-to-digital converter.\nFigure 6. (a) Pictorial description of\

    \ are tightly\ncoupled to their applications and this can also be incorporated\
    \ over parallel programming\nparadigm to enhance processing and reduce execution\
    \ time [161,162]. A key aspect of Epic\nis the support of prototyping and reusability\
    \ using composable hardware architecture.\nThe research and development of Epic\

    \ with Cortex-M3 controller which is\ncompatible with IEEE 802.15.4 radio frequency\
    \ module. In addition, this module enables\ndevelopers to develop the wireless\
    \ module codes using an object-oriented programming\nlanguage like Java [169].\
    \ It also demonstrates the functionalities of external interfaces, i.e.,\nUSB,\

    \ of the second and third century. In combination with the CC1000/CC2420\nRF Module,\

    \ ﬁtted with moisture, temperature,\nand light sensors [162]. These motes also\
    \ measure barometric pressure, seismic waves,\netc. [172–174].\nFigure 11. Mica2\
    \ Mote sensor [174].\nUsually, the sensor nodes of a WSN consist of three basic\
    \ building blocks: sensors,\ncomputer units, and communication units. The sensor\
    \ nodes need a working device, a\nrouting protocol, and eventually a simulator\
    \ to allow a WSN to function properly.\nThe most critical issues concerning WSN\
    \ include the lack of standardization of the\nhardware nodes, limited consumption\
    \ of energy, communication latency, out-of-order\nand loss of packets, distributed\
    \ reconﬁguration and scalability factors. In this regard, the\nOperating System\
    \ (OS) acts at the helm to arbitrate the resource access. It is worth noting\n\
    that the primary OS’s for WSNs are TinyOS, MANTIS, Contiki, Nano-RK, and LiteOS\
    \ [175].\nTinyOS (TOS) is open source, modular, component-based, module-speciﬁc\
    \ and built\nfor wireless sensor networks [176]. Nonetheless, this OS complies\
    \ with programs which\nrequire very low memory and also comprises numerous libraries\
    \ that manage network\nprotocols, distributed services, transducer drivers, and\
    \ data collection tools. TinyOS uses a\nmonolithic architecture class to construct\
    \ a static image on the node using the component\nmodel. TOS offers multithreading\
    \ support from version, named TOS Threads, using a\ncooperative threading approach.\
    \ In order to come up with a lightweight open source\nOS, Contiki was developed\
    \ by the Swedish Institute of Computer Science [177]. The\npromising factor of\
    \ Contiki is its portability factor which is based on an event-driven kernel.\n\
    Contiki includes so-called protothreads, which can be used at the individual process\
    \ level.\nNonetheless, Contiki includes many applications supporting features\
    \ like the multitasking\nkernel, preventive multithreading, prototype threads,\
    \ TCP/IP protocol, IPv6 protocol,\nlight telnet client, and quick web server etc.\
    \ [178]. It is worth noting that Contiki supports\ndynamic memory management;\
    \ it does not support applications in real time [179].\nWith the advent of cross\
    \ platform requirements, the multi-threaded WSN models were\ndeveloped. The MultimodAl\
    \ system for in situ wireless sensor (MANTIS) NeTworks [164]\nis a multi-threaded\
    \ WSN operating system. MANTIS is an easy-to-use OS that includes\nkernel, scheduler,\
    \ and network stack, and is compatible to be used across various platforms,\n\
    i.e., PDA or a PC.\nIn addition, Nano-RK was built for WSNs based on multitasking\
    \ [175]. The design\nobjectives for Nano-RK include multihop networking, effective\
    \ power management to ex-\ntend WSN lifetime, limited resources lighting applications,\
    \ and priority scheduling. LiteOS\nbased in Unix was developed by the University\
    \ of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign [164] in\norder to support the programming paradigm\
    \ for WSNs. LiteOS offers a familiar Unix,\nthread, and C programming environment\
    \ and is built using a hybrid programming model\nAgriculture 2021, 11, 475\n20\
    \ of 37\nwhich allows programming, both event-driven and thread-driven. Some of\

    \ support\nNow, the question is how the previously discussed sensors could be\
    \ deployed over an\nIoT-based High-Performance Computing (HPC) framework with\
    \ optimized scheduling. In\nthis regard, the next subsection discusses the signiﬁcance\
    \ of Edge Computing.\n3.2. Role of Edge Computing\nIt is essential to look at\
    \ data that can be processed immediately close to where the\ndata originate with\
    \ the help of edge. So, at the edge there is a requirement of some kind\nof storage,\
    \ computing ability to be able to take care of real-time processing needs. For\n\
    long-term retention for data analysis realistically, some planning activity is\
    \ to be done\nin the cloud. Therefore, if that is the case, then what kind of\
    \ storage solutions are we\nlooking at? In this regard, an edge needs to be designed\
    \ in such a way that it could possess\nlocal processing power needed in decision-making\
    \ ability and largely it is going to be\nright intensive. Thus, some storage is\
    \ required at the edge level which is going to be fast,\ni.e., largely of course\
    \ solid-state drive to overcome the issues of low latency. However, in\nthe current\
    \ scenario, data analysis and long-term planning are essential; therefore, users\n\
    may compromise with lower degrees of latencies, but the factor of storage remains\
    \ a\npriority. The prominent challenge in edge computing is with respect to the\
    \ volume of\nthe data. Having so many sensors deployed for computing, the heterogeneity\
    \ of data\nthemselves is another challenging issue. The coherency of data always\
    \ exists at the edge\nlevel and it is essential for the user to correlate the\
    \ data to discrete points, and without this\ncorrelation, one cannot get insights\
    \ for the generated data. Now, to maintain correlation\nof high-speed data becomes\
    \ another bottleneck in edge computing. To overcome this\nissue, the workﬂow optimization\
    \ along with energy aware scheduling criteria becomes\na necessity for edge computing.\
    \ In this regard, ﬂexibility and agility could be achieved\nwith lower cost, whereby\
    \ rapid provisioning of data could be enabled with continuous\ninnovation, free\
    \ ﬂow of data transmission could be observed to and from sensors without\nbeing\
    \ clogged, on demand analytics with hybrid cloud and multicloud deployments could\n\
    be met, and distributed storage could be created in order to manage high-volume\
    \ generated\ndata. Having mentioned the aforementioned parameters, it could be\
    \ asserted in a nutshell\nthat agility and ﬂexibility need to be maintained at\
    \ the seconds or subseconds level of\ncomputing to manage the real-time complex\
    \ problems. Nonetheless, this has become\npossible with the help of IoT device\
    \ sensors. Since at the edge level, a ﬁnite amount of\nstorage is being maintained,\
    \ therefore the workﬂow optimization is to be designed in such\na way that it\
    \ can meet the real-time computing demands in seconds or subseconds level, i.e.,\n\
    Agriculture 2021, 11, 475\n21 of 37\nthe deﬁned system needs to be able to address\
    \ this problem of getting the data that come in\nquickly and starting to process\
    \ them to gain some insights into certain correlation and then\nkeep that storage\
    \ free for the next set of data that is coming in. Therefore, with respect to\n\
    workﬂow optimization, we need to look at the set of devices which needs to be\
    \ employed\nto be able to address all the data that are coming in. In this context,\
    \ if a High-Performance\nComputing (HPC) framework could be set over the edge\
    \ level, then the aforementioned\nissues are feasible to be resolved. It is essential\
    \ for the working of HPC framework attached\nto the edge to smoothen the workﬂow\
    \ optimization and scheduling criteria.\nVarious edge nodes require various types\
    \ of resources. To this end, it is necessary\nto select an appropriate scheduling\
    \ approach to ensure the consistency of resources and\nthe availability of services.\
    \ Researchers have suggested resource continuity management\napproaches, such\
    \ as the layered model Fog to Cloud (F2C) and OpenFog Reference Archi-\ntecture\
    \ (OpenFog RA) [180,181].\nThe F2C layered model is a novel architecture focused\
    \ on data sharing and data inte-\ngration that can achieve service parallelization\
    \ and less service execution time. OpenFog\nRA has been designed to meet the same\
    \ F2C objective [181]. Therefore, researchers are\nproposing a distributed management\
    \ system incorporating edge and cloud tools to efﬁ-\nciently achieve resource\
    \ consistency within a traditional hierarchical architecture [181,182].\nLi et\
    \ al. [183] came up with EveryLite, a lightweight scripting language for resource-\n\
    constrained, heterogeneous edge devices. Such tasks which are both time-limited\
    \ and\nspace-complex are referred to as microtasks by interfaces in the migration\
    \ process. In edge\ncomputing, EveryLite can perform microtasks. Kang et al. [184]\
    \ designed a lightweight\nscheduler that can automatically schedule tasks of different\
    \ layers of Deep Neural Networks\n(DNN) between mobile devices and the cloud data\
    \ center without proﬁling each program.\nBy becoming adapted to the lightweight\
    \ scheduler, working professionals can be adapted to\na range of low-latency and\
    \ energy-efﬁcient DNN architectures, hardware systems, wireless\nnetworks, and\
    \ server workloads.\nBy embracing cooperative competition and game theory, Zhang\
    \ et al. [122] established\nCoGTA, a system for allocation of tasks. For edge\
    \ computing systems, CoGTA aims at\ndelay-sensitive and social-sensing applications.\
    \ CoGTA may tackle a few crucial problems,\nsuch as Bottom-up Game-theoretic Task\
    \ Allocation (BGTA). Similarly, the Markovian\nstochastic channel was used by\
    \ Zhang et al. [185] to provide an optimal solution and\nofﬂoad strategy for collaborative\
    \ operation between cloud and edge devices. This problem\nof minimal energy scheduling\
    \ tasks can be formulated on directed acyclic graphs as a\nrestricted, shortest\
    \ path problem. This problem is then solved using the regular Lagrange\nRelaxation-dependent\
    \ Aggregated Cost (LARAC) algorithm.\nKwak et al. [186] suggested a dynamic allocation\
    \ algorithm for CPU/network resource\nor task in the mobile networking context.\
    \ To scale the CPU/network speed, they used\nthe Lyapunov optimization technique.\
    \ Meanwhile, Liang et al. [187] proposed a new\napproach to resource management\
    \ by taking into account both bandwidth availability and\nsource selection.\n\
    Data are distributed in edge computing which requires distributed data processing,\n\
    storage, and networking resources [0]. In addition, edge devices tend to be heterogeneous,\n\
    leading to a heterogeneous runtime environment and heterogeneous data on-edge\
    \ device.\nFurthermore, resources are limited on edge apps. As such, proposing\
    \ an optimum, complex,\nand energy-aware scheduling strategy in edge computing\
    \ is complicated. If resource\nabstraction and edge OS management would allow\
    \ developers to focus on their applications\nwithout trying to think about hardware,\
    \ connectivity, and code written for speciﬁc devices,\nthis would be a huge leap\
    \ forward for complex projects to be realized. This will reduce\ncomplexity, simplify\
    \ growth, and reduce edge computing costs for the ecosystem.\n3.3. HPC on Edge\
    \ (HPCE)\nThis new High-Performance Computing (HPC) solution seeks to move beyond\
    \ the\nagricultural services offered on edge and provide a comprehensive platform\
    \ for precision\nAgriculture 2021, 11, 475\n22 of 37\nfarming and animal husbandry\
    \ and furnish with utility not only for farmers but also for\nstakeholders. The\
    \ HPCE architecture is adapted from CYBELE conceptual framework [2].\nThe HPCE\
    \ model uses open and proprietary vast amounts of datasets, including sensor\n\
    readings, as well as satellite data and historic climatic and environmental information\
    \ for\nready reference. While this would be the most effective way to use HPC\
    \ technology, it\nonly uses the latest software platforms and projects that are\
    \ being developed by HPCE’s e-\ncontrolled services, as well as increased HPC\
    \ e-infrastructure to enable huge heterogeneous\ndata processing to be done and\
    \ ﬁnd modern solutions to complex problems using dedicated\nalgorithms. Due to\
    \ the interconnection of large-oriented approaches, varying datasets,\nand available\
    \ big data techniques, it is possible to scale distributed big data research to\n\
    enormous scales when holding many types of datasets together in one place [2].\
    \ In doing\nso, it enables the aggregated data and metadata to be aligned semantically\
    \ to a standard\nscheme and data model and enables advanced data analytics to\
    \ take secret information\ninto account. In addition to this, the HPCE architecture\
    \ will also help in gaining insights\nfrom adaptive data visualization services.\n\
    With reference to CYBELE [2], the architectural approach of the HPC on edge is\n\
    illustrated in Figure 12. By organizing a product component based on interdependencies,\n\
    this is intended to highlight the importance of pipelines being constructed to\
    \ promote\ncompatibility and show how to maintain the integrity of interdependent\
    \ services. It is worth\nnoting that CYBELE resonates well with the EdgeX platform\
    \ architecture. EdgeX platform\ncomprises four core services, i.e., device services,\
    \ core services, supporting services, and\napplication services to enable smooth\
    \ workﬂow optimization [188]. In addition, it will be\ninteresting to see a synchronization\
    \ of EdgeX with a dedicated HPC framework for faster\nbatch processing of data\
    \ over edge.\nFigure 12. High Performance Computing on Edge.\nBig, heterogeneous\
    \ data are made available through repositories powered by HPC\nwhich is responsible\
    \ for the processing at the edge layer. In this regard, as can be seen in\nFigure\
    \ 11, HPC frameworks such as Spark, Hadoop, YARN, Big Deep Learning (BigDL),\n\
    Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG), and Kubernetes are deployed for the batch processing\
    \ of\ndata using distributed framework attached to the edge layer [189]. It is\
    \ worth noting that\nSpark and BigDL are the widely used frameworks in many organizations\
    \ for their open\nsource and high degree of interoperability features. Spark and\
    \ BigDL are based on MapRe-\nduce framework which has high room for tuning for\
    \ smooth workﬂow optimization [190].\nThe transmission of the application process\
    \ interface along with data from the cloud layer\nto the edge layer is conducted\
    \ using 4G/5G or ﬁber/DOCSIS/DSL communication system.\nThis is seen on the middle\
    \ section of the architecture as shown in Figure 12. At ﬁrst,\nAgriculture 2021,\
    \ 11, 475\n23 of 37\nthe data are processed in the background prior to being passed\
    \ on to the check-in stage\nfor data validator or timestamp validator for resolution\
    \ of data veriﬁcation and timing\nproblems. Once data are obtained in edge layer,\
    \ quality checks are conducted to identify\nanomalies and any other data irregularities,\
    \ maintaining their accuracy and validity, which\nare accompanied by a series\
    \ of measures aligned with processes of data cleansing.\nFinally, the HPE data\
    \ provenance service provides the mechanisms required for\nrecording all relevant\
    \ information concerning incoming data of interest. With HPE, the\ndata provenance\
    \ platform is inherently connected to the data policy and asset brokerage\nengine\
    \ that enables the platform to bind data providers and data users with data share\n\
    and business features. In addition to facilitating interoperability and reuse\
    \ of data, the\ninspected data are annotated and harmonized semantically. Since\
    \ the data come from a\nvariety of physically distributed data sources, a standard\
    \ data model will be created for\nthe semantic deﬁnition and annotation of the\
    \ data. To facilitate the pipeline and allow the\nvarious heterogeneous components\
    \ to communicate seamlessly, the model will be used as\na common language to annotate\
    \ data and exchange messages between the components.\nClean and semantically uplifted\
    \ data are then available, i.e., open and proprietary data to\nbe queried, analyzed,\
    \ and viewed. An exempliﬁcation of how ground sensors have their\ndata stored\
    \ and analyzed at cloud data base is shown in Figure 13. The on-ﬁeld data are\n\
    continuously assessed by a real-time monitoring system to ensure triggering effects\
    \ if any\nthreshold point is crossed. Simultaneously, the on-ﬁeld data are also\
    \ stored in the cloud\ndatabase from where the user can download the required\
    \ data and at the same time, data\nanalysis could be applied using the machine\
    \ learning tools stored over the cloud database.\nFigure 13. Illustration for\
    \ storage and analysis of data from ground sensors to cloud database.\nTo facilitate\
    \ simulation execution, a deﬁned experimental composition setting is de-\nsigned,\
    \ as shown in the top right part of the architecture (cloud layer) in Figure 12.\
    \ The\ncomposition framework of experiments aims to support the separate design,\
    \ development,\nand execution of big data research procedures, the support of\
    \ embedded scientiﬁc compu-\ntation and reproductive tests. In the analysis method,\
    \ its subsequent template is selected\nto provide each analytical template with\
    \ its own software and execution endpoint and\nallow the user to modify the appropriate\
    \ conﬁguration variables (i.e., input algorithm,\nexecution parameters, netting\
    \ parameters, and output parameters). The results of each\nanalytical template\
    \ are presented. The composition system for experiments will promote\nthe design\
    \ and implementation of data analysis workﬂows consisting of a number of data\n\
    analysis procedures, interconnected in terms of data sources and input and output\
    \ artifacts.\nThe outcome will constitute the input to another research template\
    \ when a template is\nAgriculture 2021, 11, 475\n24 of 37\nexecuted. The output\
    \ of the research model is an object for session that contains all the\nmemory\
    \ output values.\nIn addition to big data, advanced analysis must be implemented\
    \ when selecting input\ndatasets and developing workﬂows. For HPCE, advanced analytical\
    \ algorithms are avail-\nable to stakeholders that allow them to explore various\
    \ forms of data visually and to ﬁnd\nand solve new trends. In order to achieve\
    \ improved delivery and monitoring, machining\nand predictive modelling methods\
    \ should be modiﬁed so as to handle the predictive life\ncycle of data planning,\
    \ detection, and analysis. However, the implementation of advanced\nanalytics\
    \ along with huge, complex data increases the need for strong computing power\n\
    and a higher processing memory, so that information can be collected within a\
    \ realistic\ntimeframe. When the test cases are executed, multiple HPC attributes\
    \ are needed, including\nstorage power, speed of the device, memory capacity,\
    \ and quick turnaround time.\nThe next section discusses the IoT-based communication\
    \ methodologies in edge\ncomputing used for precision farming developed by several\
    \ researchers.\n3.4. Edge Computing in Precision Farming\nIoT incorporation in\
    \ precision farming has brought about changes in the communica-\ntions of actuators\
    \ and sensors with remote servers. With respect to networking technologies,\n\
    modern IoT-capable nodes provide new energy-saving transceivers and network topologies\n\
    that are tailored to ﬁeld conditions where mobile and WiFi base stations are rare\
    \ [191].\nMultiple topologies that use wireless sensor networks can route data\
    \ messages via commu-\nnication nodes to reach a gateway with the internet connectivity,\
    \ as shown in the proposal\nfrom Akka and Sokullu [192].\nMore recent developments\
    \ with IoT involve network protocols to communicate\nthrough the internet with\
    \ remote devices via applications designed for data reduction. For\nmonitoring\
    \ purposes, for example [191,193,194], researchers used the MQTT protocol for\n\
    data collection from sensor nodes at greenhouses. These protocols allowed the\
    \ gathering\nand analysis by Shukla et al. of data at intermediate cloud middleware\
    \ [195]. A further\nexpanded analysis of this topic can be found in the work of\
    \ Kalox et al. [196]. A gateway\nusing ZigBee collects data from a real deployment\
    \ of sensors, which are then sent to a\ndata cloud driven by FIWARE through web-based\
    \ protocols. The work takes advantage\nof open interfaces to build a number of\
    \ client applications that can access the cloud mod-\nule. However, no IoT protocols\
    \ are used, and only an early version of FIWARE is used.\nMartinez et al. [197]\
    \ presented research on how to handle crops in PA environments using\nthe cloud\
    \ plane. The FIWARE core is used here, along with a collection of additional en-\n\
    ablers, to communicate with IoT gateways through a variety of protocols, such\
    \ as Message\nQueuing Telemetry Transport (MQTT) or Constrained Application Protocol\
    \ (CoAP), where\ncurrent and historical data are stored in the cloud for analytics.\
    \ The output of FIWARE\nis assessed for PA using a collection of synthetic tests,\
    \ but no real implementation of the\nproposal is provided. As per Zyrianoff et\
    \ al. [198], a reﬁned optimization has to be made in\nFIWARE to get it implemented\
    \ over fog computing domain.\nThe incorporation of intermediate processing stages\
    \ in the data path is an evolution\nof mainly cloud-based platforms. Before sending\
    \ monitored data to the cloud, Liu [199]\nperformed local preprocessing at data\
    \ collection gateways. Ferrandez-Pastor et al. [200]\nexpanded on this concept\
    \ by evaluating a range of IoT protocols and technologies in a\nreal hydroponic\
    \ implementation to achieve effective computation-ofﬂoading. Moreover, a\nsimilar\
    \ method for computation ofﬂoading was also implemented by Chang et al. [201]\n\
    in the domain of aeroponics. However, in these works, a lack of ﬂexibility is\
    \ noticeable\nin the way edge computing is implemented, and this layer is exclusively\
    \ oriented to data\nfusion. Guillen et al. [202] proposed a hybridization of Artiﬁcial\
    \ Intelligence (AI) with IoT\nin precision agriculture. However, it was found\
    \ that there is still a big gap between AI and\nIoT due to computational resources.\
    \ In this regard, they proposed an inclusion of Graphical\nProcessing Unit (GPU)\
    \ in the edge device to enhance the computational services [202]. For\nan efﬁcient\
    \ computation ofﬂoading, Chen et al. [203] proposed ThriftyEdge which has the\n\
    Agriculture 2021, 11, 475\n25 of 37\nsubstantial potential to support computational\
    \ intensive tasks by proper ofﬂoading across\nlocal device and edge cloud in proximity.\
    \ ThriftyEdge is well suited to be deployed in ad\nhoc networks for precision\
    \ agriculture [203].\nThe IoT-based generic monitoring system was deﬁned by Oliver\
    \ et al. [204]. It was\ndeployed and validated on ﬂoriculture domain, with a setup\
    \ of monitoring weather and\nsoil conditions. Strategically, the goal was to foresee\
    \ such diseases which could impede\nplantations proactively. For example, bacterial\
    \ leaf spots, damp-off root rots, soft rots, and\nbacterial spots are among such\
    \ diseases. HPE’s overall architecture is cloud-centric and\nuses an edge computer\
    \ node to gather information from the distributed sensor network.\nMySense is\
    \ a generic framework for the rapid development and use of precision wine sce-\n\
    narios monitoring application [205]. It consists of four layers, including sensors/actuators,\n\
    WSN/gateway, web, and cloud applications. For local tasks and real-time alarm\
    \ generation,\nfog computing is used on the WSN/gateway layer. The platform was\
    \ used in a winery to\nstudy the dynamics of diseases in the current microclimatic\
    \ setting.\nThe necessary ingredient that makes farming operations work is consistent,\
    \ productive\nsoil. Lavanya et al. [206] came up with an Internet-of-Things-based\
    \ sensing framework\nfor assessing nitrogen, phosphorous, potassium (NPK) concentrations\
    \ in soil. In order to\nallow a colorimetric approach in the sensor, Light Dependent\
    \ Resistors (LDR) and Light\nEmitting Diodes (LEDs) were used. A fuzzy rule-based\
    \ method implemented on an edge\ncomputer using Raspberry Pi was used to assess\
    \ the sensed values pertaining to nutrient\ndeﬁciency. To assess other nutrient\
    \ shortages, additional rules were added to this rationale.\nThis method was low-cost\
    \ and provided a quick alternative compared to laboratory testing\nmethods, which\
    \ take a longer time and are also costly. Soil fertility is optimized by assisting\n\
    farmers in effectively managing their soil nutrition, resulting in cost savings,\
    \ improved\nﬁeld management, and increased environmental conservation by eliminating\
    \ runoff and\nleaching pollution. Park et al. [207] presented an exemplary case\
    \ study in the domain\nof tomato production that demonstrated how edge computing\
    \ generated scalable data\nanalytics. In this case, a Raspberry Pi served as a\
    \ sensor setup base station and a network\nedge node. On the edge node, a prediction\
    \ analysis was implemented for the growth state\nof cherry tomato, and the data\
    \ generated were sent to a cloud-based central server for\nmodel integration and\
    \ analytical interpretation to gain insights to predict results. This\nstrategy\
    \ not only reduces data ﬂow, but it also allows farmers to preserve their data.\n\
    Atmospheric temperature is a critical factor for the productivity of plants, and\
    \ in\nthis regard, it plays a prominent role in irrigation planning and greenhouse\
    \ management.\nKrintz et al. [208] used Single Spectrum Analysis (SSA) along with\
    \ linear regression to\nintroduce a temperature forecast system using low-cost\
    \ microcontrollers and single board\ncomputer. The introduction of edge computing\
    \ in their methodological paradigm drasti-\ncally reduced the factor of latency.\
    \ The advantageous part of their developed system is\nthat the farmers can opt\
    \ for a microclimate monitoring network rather than installing a\nsophisticated\
    \ weather station.\nFan and Gao [209] also looked at task parallelism in mobile\
    \ edge computing. An\nofﬂoading delay may arise because of the transmission characteristics.\
    \ In addition, com-\nputation delay normally happens over cloud transactions while\
    \ determining when to\ncontinue with the operation. Merelli et al. [210] looked\
    \ at edge computing as a foundation\nfor metagenomics research in agriculture,\
    \ and found feasibility for remote microbial studies\nof water, air, and soil.\
    \ Traditional methods for metagenomics research necessitate a large\namount of\
    \ data transfer to the cloud. However, with the advent of advanced edge tech-\n\
    nologies, remote analyses can be performed, and the results can be sent to the\
    \ cloud using\na combination of System-on-a-Chip (SoC) and edge computing. A mix\
    \ of edge and cloud\nprovides a highly appealing approach to provide complete\
    \ analysis workﬂows. The results\nof the experiments revealed a 95 percent reduction\
    \ in data streaming, thereby demonstrat-\ning the feasibility of metagenomic research\
    \ at a remote level. For singular analyses, an edge\nsolution is feasible. On\
    \ the other hand, a subsequent work by the authors in the domain of\nmetagenomics\
    \ revealed that shifting computation to the cloud improves cost and efﬁciency\n\
    Agriculture 2021, 11, 475\n26 of 37\nas the frequency of analyses increases [211].\
    \ Nonetheless, if AI and blockchain can be\nincorporated over IoT services, then\
    \ the farmers and the stakeholders will obtain a better\nunderstanding of the\
    \ crops along with a fast and easy way to characterize genetically\nmodiﬁed crops\
    \ [212]. In addition, with the help of AI, water usage can be optimized and it\n\
    will also be possible to determine whether the treated wastewater is suitable\
    \ for irrigation at\na given point in time and what are the relevant crops on\
    \ which the treated wastewater can\nbe used, depending upon its composition [212].\

    \ technologies which can provide economically competitive domain to farm-\ning\
    \ sector along with ﬁnancial viability whilst enhancing environmental efﬁciency\
    \ and\nbeing socially acceptable are the need of the hour in terms of sustainability.\
    \ However, given\nthe availability of capital, meeting these sustainability targets\
    \ would often entail trade-offs.\nFurthermore, the objectives are “moving goals”\
    \ that must adapt to new problems and pri-\norities. Technological advancements\
    \ are rapid; however, their deployment in the farming\nsector remains incomplete.\
    \ It is quite common practice with the farmers in developing\nnations that they\
    \ tend to opt for trial-and-error methods in technology adoption rather than\n\
    following a systematic way. This could have signiﬁcant consequences for farm structure\n\
    and the number of farmers who will be able to make a living in the future.\n4.1.\
    \ Awareness Regarding the Latest Ongoing Technology\nAn initiative toward better\
    \ farmer education and training along with the help of\nﬁnancial resources, non-government\
    \ organizations, the media, and the general public\ncan contribute to making sustainable\
    \ farm technology adoption easier. Dedicated laws\ncan be put forward by the government\
    \ which may comprise incentives and disincentives\nfor the adoption of the latest\
    \ technology. Environmental laws along with zoning codes,\nanimal welfare guidelines,\
    \ and public health policies, are increasingly constraining farmers’\nactions.\
    \ In this regard, there is a deemed requirement for tailored digital technology\
    \ which\nthe farmers should get acquainted with. However, because of the numerous\
    \ parameters\ncomprising policy factors and economic situation at the helm in\
    \ different contexts, there is\nno adequate explanation for why farmers implement\
    \ speciﬁc technologies. Therefore, it\nbecomes necessary for the respective governments\
    \ to furnish substantial knowledge and\ninfrastructure to farmers to uplift their\
    \ respective agriculture segments.\nAgriculture 2021, 11, 475\n27 of 37\n4.2.\
    \ Government Support to Provide Adequate Infrastructure\nIt is important to determine\
    \ which innovations are most effective in particular situa-\ntions in respective\
    \ agricultural segments and it is also important to ensure an appropriate\nmechanism\
    \ to provide incentives to promote the achievement of sustainability goals for\
    \ the\nbeneﬁt of global welfare. Rationale for priorities of food production in\
    \ an environmentally\nfriendly way is often accomplished by the use of suitable\
    \ technologies. To achieve these\nobjectives, some goals need to be tweaked in\
    \ agricultural activities by aligning interests\nwith those goals. Additional\
    \ perks can be allocated to the farmers who understand the\nbeneﬁts from technology\
    \ and practice them.\nMore follow-up is needed in monitoring the implementation\
    \ of innovations in order\nto ensure transparency in policy factor and research\
    \ activities pertaining to the adoption\nof new technology in the agrisector.\
    \ Post implementation evaluations of results will\nhelp to correct mistakes before\
    \ too much money is pumped into the wrong segment.\nThis is critical because agricultural\
    \ innovations come from a variety of places. Rating\ntechnologies and predicting\
    \ potential future patterns will aid policymakers in moving\ntoward sustainable\
    \ agriculture.\nA broader participatory approach involving a variety of stakeholders\
    \ would promote\nthe implementation of innovations for sustainable farming systems.\
    \ Farmers along with\nconsumer groups and the associated agricultural food industry\
    \ who are inclined towards\nsustainable farming should be included as stakeholders.\
    \ Since sustainable technologies\nare applied at the farm level, therefore the\
    \ farmers must be involved in the technology\nadoption discussion. In an ideal\
    \ world, there will be a stronger sense of ownership in\nthe selection of technology\
    \ in the entire agricultural food chain. Farmers’ adoption of\ntechnology is inﬂuenced\
    \ by the associated industries. However, the industrial segment\nshould learn\
    \ from the farmers’ requirements, which will help them to standardize the latest\n\
    technology, which in turn will make a substantial impact on the farming sector.\n\
    4.3. Soil Analysis to Promote Variety of Crop Growth\nIn countries where farming\
    \ is still done in the conventional way, farmers grow crops\nby planting without\
    \ understanding the properties of soil and its quality. As a result of this,\n\
    in the long run, farmers will not beneﬁt from the amount of money they will earn\
    \ from\ntheir farming. The current soil testing process uses a manual method which\
    \ ﬁrst involves\nthe sampling of soil and then the submission of samples to laboratories\
    \ for analysis. Due\nto the lengthy and laborious process, this manual process\
    \ is inefﬁcient. Because of human\ninterference, there is a risk of human error.\
    \ As a result, farmers could obtain inaccurate\ninformation. In that case, there\
    \ is a need for an automated method for soil testing and crop\nprediction. Soil\
    \ testing is crucial because soil testing assists in understanding the fertility\n\
    of soil and this allows predictions to be made about the potential crop yield.\
    \ Therefore,\na system could be proposed that consists of a handheld device which\
    \ will provide a pH\nreading and will help estimate the quantity of nitrogen (N),\
    \ phosphorus (P), and potassium\n(K) in the soil. In addition, a classiﬁcation\
    \ algorithm can be developed to determine\ncrops suitable for speciﬁc applications\
    \ based on the data obtained from the system, and\naccordingly the appropriate\
    \ fertilizers for the ﬁeld can be provided.\n4.4. Providing Meteorological Services\
    \ to the Farmers\nBringing weather and climate knowledge into agricultural decision\
    \ making has con-\ntributed to an increase in agricultural production in many\
    \ countries. However, in develop-\ning countries where several small farms are\
    \ rain-fed, it is difﬁcult to get access to weather\nand climate information to\
    \ help direct decision making. Government ofﬁcials should\nconsider this critical\
    \ knowledge which is useful to farmers and others dealing with poverty\nand hunger.\
    \ This situation continues because national meteorological and hydrological\n\
    services in developing countries do not receive adequate funding to cover the\
    \ expense of\ndelivering these services to the farmers. The government lacks substantial\
    \ information\nabout the signiﬁcant role of meteorological services which contribute\
    \ to the socioeconomic\nAgriculture 2021, 11, 475\n28 of 37\ndevelopment of the\
    \ nation. This state of obliviousness prevails even though governments\nconfront\
    \ multiple challenging issues in the realm of agriculture, water resources manage-\n\
    ment, health, and disaster risk mitigation, all of which are heavily affected\
    \ by weather\nand environment.\nDespite repeated periods of drought and crop failure,\
    \ as well as occasional famines,\nﬂooding often leads to losses of human life\
    \ and major property destruction. In addition,\nit also causes wide-ranging impacts\
    \ on socioeconomic growth. Therefore, it is only with\nthe advent of recent development\
    \ that there has been substantial study into quantifying\nthe beneﬁts of weather\
    \ and climate knowledge-related services. It is deemed necessary to\ntake small\
    \ steps by undertaking pilot projects to research the socioeconomic gains of using\n\
    weather and climate information-related services in agriculture.\n4.5. Yield Production\n\
    The feasibility of smart farming relies on internet connectivity and a panel to\
    \ accom-\nmodate the sensor hub. Using these features, it has become easier for\
    \ the farmers to monitor\nthe process of cultivation using their smart devices.\
    \ With the aid of sensors and intercon-\nnectivity, the smart farming initiative\
    \ helps farmers to optimize the consumption of water,\npesticide, and fertilizers\
    \ to maintain the yield quality by maintaining several parameters\nsuch as soil\
    \ condition, level of pesticide, temperature, and humidity. The system can be\n\
    made more successful by combining the fertilization and pesticide spraying systems,\
    \ all of\nwhich can be managed with an IoT application. Farmers may decide which\
    \ variety of crop\nis compatible for cultivation with their respective farm. Accordingly,\
    \ the farmers can opt\nfor innovative technologies such as drone-based farming\
    \ and various weather prediction\ntools, etc.\nYoung agropreneurs involved in\
    \ cultivation business can beneﬁt from smart farming\nin terms of farm maintenance,\
    \ irrigation, fertilization, and pesticide application. The\nsensors in the smart\
    \ farming paradigm are tailored to report various readings, including\nmeasurements\
    \ pertaining to the number of pesticides and fertilizers, irrigation pump\nstatus,\
    \ humidity, and temperature. The readings also provide details pertaining to the\n\
    growth timeline of the crop, as well as the crop type, i.e., when it was grown,\
    \ the date it\nwas cultivated, and how much was harvested. In agriculture, IoT\
    \ is seen as a prominent\nand promising factor in the agricultural domain which\
    \ can boost the yield in a quick\nmanner. In addition, the smart farming paradigm\
    \ can also serve as an avenue for the\nstartup companies to invest in.\n4.6. Sustainable\
    \ Land Use\nThere have been empirical studies that have attempted to quantify\
    \ the effect of agri-\ncultural policies associated with land use sustainability;\
    \ however, these studies turned out\nto be inconclusive. Although different opinions\
    \ on the relationship between prices and soil\ndeterioration derive from differences\
    \ in discount rates and risk aversion preferences, it is\nimportant to deﬁne these\
    \ differences as this allows for better clariﬁcation when participat-\ning in\
    \ discussions with others. To understand the impacts of changes in relative prices\
    \ on\nagricultural resource distribution, four different responses can be distinguished:\
    \ (i) expan-\nsion of the total agricultural area (extensiﬁcation); (ii) rise\
    \ in the number of agricultural\ninputs used, also known as intensiﬁcation; (iii)\
    \ change in technology; and (iv) change in\ncrop choices. A differentiation is\
    \ to be made among recurring costs that are capable of\nraising productivity and\
    \ ﬁxed asset investments that work to enhance soil quality in the\nlong term.\n\
    If greater agricultural production occurs as a result of increased area, impact\
    \ on the\nenvironment in terms of deforestation, overgrazing, ﬂooding, and sedimentation\
    \ is a likely\nresult. If there are changes in cropping activities at the same\
    \ time as the expansion of\nthe land area, then the new cropping activities will\
    \ have an effect due to the soil quality\nthat depends on the negative impacts\
    \ of previous cropping activities on the resource.\nTherefore, it is unclear whether\
    \ the interplay among agricultural policies, along with\nAgriculture 2021, 11,\
    \ 475\n29 of 37\nthe supply response of farmers and the implications for sustainable\
    \ land use has been\nadequately explored.\n5. Conclusions\nThe scope of the current\
    \ paper is to introduce and pave the way for smart sensing\nwith edge computing\
    \ technology in the developing nations, whose gross domestic product\nrelies substantially\
    \ on agriculture. In this regard, the applicability of various sensing\ntechnologies\
    \ with an ease of edge computing has been put forward in this paper. Smart\nsensors\
    \ offer intriguing possibilities for precision agriculture. As of now, ongoing\
    \ research\nin edge computing and smart sensing for agricultural domain is only\
    \ in its initial stage.\nNonetheless, prototypes of edge computing systems have\
    \ already been developed by\nmany researchers for speciﬁc agricultural domains;\
    \ however, the interpretability of edge\ncomputing techniques with various sensing\
    \ units still remains a challenge. There is a\nneed to set up and deploy cost-effective\
    \ high-performance computing-based edge nodes\nto enable smooth data ﬂow operations\
    \ for precision agriculture. Implementing these\nsophisticated and efﬁcient edge\
    \ technologies will solve these issues and in a broader\nperspective, this will\
    \ open up a new segment for farmers in developing nations. In\naddition to this,\
    \ a major problem to be dealt with in this context is inadequate internet\nconnectivity,\
    \ which is seen as a global issue and which affects the growth of developing\n\
    and underdeveloped nations because not every region of the world has access to\
    \ the\ninternet. In a nutshell, to uplift the agricultural domain in developing\
    \ nations, a dedicated\ncost-effective infrastructure is required which can completely\
    \ digitize the farming sector in\nthe best possible way.\nAuthor Contributions:\

  explanation: 'This paper examines the relationship between IoT-enabled automated
    irrigation management systems and specific network protocols in the context of
    real-time irrigation management. The authors analyze the benefits and challenges
    of integrating IoT devices and network protocols within automated irrigation systems
    to optimize water usage and enhance agricultural productivity.


    The paper provides an overview of existing IoT-based agricultural networks, highlighting
    the need for seamless integration of network protocols to achieve efficient, real-time
    irrigation management. The authors identify MQTT and CoAP as the most suitable
    protocols for IoT-based irrigation systems due to their low latency, lightweight
    design, and robust security features.


    Key points:

    * Integration of IoT devices and network protocols enables automated irrigation
    systems to collect real-time data, monitor crop health, and adjust irrigation
    schedules based on specific parameters such as soil moisture, weather conditions,
    and plant water needs.

    * MQTT and CoAP protocols are well-suited for IoT-based irrigation systems due
    to their low latency, energy efficiency, and support for constrained devices with
    limited resources.

    * Seamless integration of network protocols within automated irrigation systems
    requires addressing challenges such as network reliability, data security, and
    interoperability between different devices and platforms.'

    \ This study intends to explore a platform that oﬀers an infrastructure to link\

    \ contemporary network diﬃculties relating to agriculture are also\ncovered. Conclusion.\
    \ The results of this study can be used as a guide for creating particular network\
    \ protocols for the\nagriculture industry.\n1. Introduction\nIn the economic development\
    \ of a region, agriculture plays a\ncrucial role. Agriculture is an essential\
    \ profession [1]. In\nIndia, almost 70% of families survive on the income gener-\n\
    ated by agriculture [2]. The protection and improvement\nof agriculture are therefore\
    \ necessary. Keeping in view the\nimportance of agriculture, smart farming was\
    \ introduced.\nAgriculture and information technologies check the produc-\ntion\
    \ of diﬀerent crops [3]. Several problems are yet to be\nsolved in agriculture\
    \ as the most critical portion of farmers’\nstrategies is obsolete and does not\
    \ reach an acceptable yield\n[4]. Humidity, air temperature, and farmland signiﬁcantly\n\
    aﬀect plant development and the agriculture industry, which\nare crucial for sustainability\
    \ [5]. Sustainable agriculture and\nintelligent farming have drawn widespread\
    \ interest in acade-\nmia and industry, which is seen as a modern way of achiev-\n\
    ing food development, including crop monitoring in a real\nenvironment, smart\
    \ greenhouse, disease detection in crops\n[6], and smart city management [7],\
    \ among others. Other\nchallenges, including data collection and recording, are\
    \ the\nprimary steps toward fundamental analysis and intelligent\nfarming applications\
    \ [8]. Data has become more ubiquitous\nwith the exponential growth of mobile\
    \ and wireless network-\ning technology. An IoT (Internet of Things) system consists\n\
    of low power, small in size, and sensor nodes operated using\nbatteries [9], which\
    \ also leads to wireless sensor networks\n(WSNs) [10]. To sense the environment\
    \ continuously in\nremote geographical areas, a network of inexpensive nodes\n\
    is deployed, a typical IoT application. The IoT draws much\nHindawi\nWireless\
    \ Communications and Mobile Computing\nVolume 2022, Article ID 5617903, 16 pages\n\
    https://doi.org/10.1155/2022/5617903\ninterest due to high demands for creative\
    \ operation, perfor-\nmance, and productivity enhancement [11]. Cloud comput-\n\
    ing\nand\nthe\nInternet\nof\nThings\nperform\nelementary\nmanagement jobs, manage\
    \ visual data related to crops, and\nobserve the growth environment [12]. The\
    \ projected market\nsize of smart farming worldwide in 2017 and 2022 as smart\n\
    agriculture global market size is projected to rise from\naround US$ 9.58 billion\
    \ in 2017 to US$ 23.14 billion by\n2022 [11]. Smart farming increases agricultural\
    \ productivity,\nsolves agrarian challenges like food demand, and makes\nfarmers\
    \ more connected and intelligent. By 2023, the market\nsize of smart agriculture\
    \ worldwide is expected to hit around\nUnited States (US) $ 26.76 billion. Precision\
    \ farming is\npoised to become the most inﬂuential agricultural trend in\ndeveloping\
    \ countries. It is also projected that the market size\nof precision farming will\
    \ rise from US$ 730 million in 2015\nto US$ 2.42 billion by 2020. Figure 1 shows\
    \ IoT projects’\nglobal share and trends [13].\nWith the growing development in\
    \ mobile and wireless\nnetworking technologies and the ever-increasing amount\
    \ of\ndata and related resources distributed via heterogeneous net-\nworks, the\
    \ Internet of Things (IoT) has transformed the con-\ncept of a more interconnected\
    \ society into reality [14]. The\nIoT, also known as the Internet of Things or\
    \ the Modern\nInternet, is a modern technology model designed as a global\nnetwork\
    \ of computers and machines capable of connecting,\ndelivering innovative activities,\
    \ and improving production\nand productivity [15]. The IoT is now generally known\
    \ as\na product that already has a signiﬁcant impact on industrial\nmarkets. Current\
    \ innovations rely mainly on managing and\ntracking diverse operations, increasingly\
    \ growing to satisfy\nhuman requirements. Most of these innovations are based\n\
    on eﬃcient management and control of various processes.\nSeveral remote health\
    \ tracking system sensors can screen\nvariables and transfer data to a personal\
    \ computer or an\nonline storage website [16]. This device can resolve patients’\n\
    concerns by continuously recording data on their mobile\nphones, PC, or various\
    \ remote gadgets, which may inﬂuence\ntheir procedures. Sensors allow patients\
    \ to self-screen, mon-\nitor, and survey human physiological information while\
    \ sup-\nplying healthcare providers with interfaces and a dashboard.\nThese sensors\
    \ are eﬃciently tracked for patient consider-\nation and eventually become accurate\
    \ and robust. Incorpo-\nrating the wearable integrated sensor [17] is used to\n\
    assemble physiological and development information to\nenable the status checking\
    \ of patients. The medicinal use of\nintrigue represents sensors. Using wearable\
    \ frameworks,\nhealth tracking systems often use multiple sensors periodi-\ncally\
    \ organized into a sensor that is either conﬁned to\nbody-wearing sensors or incorporates\
    \ a network of sensors.\nThe use of wearable sensors and systems that are important\n\
    to the restoration ﬁeld includes well-being and health obser-\nvation, safety\
    \ control, home recovery, adequacy of treatment\nassessment, and early identiﬁcation\
    \ of disorders [18].\nThe relationship between the Internet of Things (IoT)\n\
    and agriculture is highlighted in this research. For doing this,\ndiﬀerent communication\
    \ protocols have been discussed in\nthis paper. Similarly, the network protocols\
    \ are further\ndivided into subprotocols, and each protocol’s speciﬁc pur-\npose\
    \ is elaborated. After that, the relationship between agri-\nculture and IoT is\
    \ discussed, including the function of\nnetwork protocols in agriculture and their\
    \ problems.\nThe remaining parts are arranged as follows: Section 2.1\nexamines\n\
    existing\nliterary\napproaches\nand\nprotocols,\nfollowed by Section 2.2 on communication\
    \ protocols. Sec-\ntion 2.3 then discusses the purpose of distinct protocols in\n\
    a network; Section 2.4 then discusses agriculture and the sig-\nniﬁcance of computer\
    \ networks in agriculture; Section 2.5\nthen discusses the analysis of computer\
    \ network protocols\nin agriculture; Sections 2.6 and 2.7 then illustrates potential\n\
    research and technologies used in agriculture, and Section\n2.8 discusses network\
    \ issues in agriculture. Section 2.9 pro-\nvides the discussion based on research\
    \ questions, and Sec-\ntion 3 concludes the paper.\n2. Survey Methodology\nBased\
    \ on the discussion mentioned in the introduction sec-\ntion, the proposed work\
    \ focused on three research questions\nand targeted them as:\nQ1. What network\
    \ protocols have been utilized in the lit-\nerature for agricultural digitization?\n\
    Q2. Which protocol is the best in IoT?\nQ3. What challenges existed in agricultural\
    \ networks?\nWe investigated the role of IoT in agriculture and net-\nwork protocols\
    \ in depth. A review approach was used for\nthe deep investigation. This aided\
    \ us in integrating previous\nwork and deﬁning our strategy in a broad sense.\
    \ The\nresources are connected to IoT methods in agriculture and\nnetwork protocols.\
    \ Other sources include books, research\npapers, and review articles. The primary\
    \ goal of our research\nis to give all users information so they can pick which\
    \ proto-\ncols will best fulﬁll their needs. Table 1 provides the detail of\n\
    the gathered research.\n2.1. Literature Review. Discuss the constraints that are\
    \ used\nto reduce the risk level in farming. The author highlighted\nthat many\
    \ farm areas with the ownership of that land could\nincrease the expectations\
    \ of a high growth rate due to free-\nhand decision capability and can determine\
    \ adoption pace.\nMoreover, it is mentioned that developing countries use\ntwo\
    \ successful technologies in agriculture. First, technology\nis for aﬀordability\
    \ and availability of resources, and second,\ntechnology is used to proﬁt by minimizing\
    \ risk levels in\nfarming decision-making. The proﬁt maximization depends\non\
    \ the number of laborers, the farm size, and the agricultural\nresources [19].\
    \ In [20], the authors introduced a blockchain\nmethod as the central spine where\
    \ IoT devices worked to\ncollect data from the ﬁeld along with smart contracts,\n\
    responsible for communication among all the contributing\nparties. In [21], the\
    \ authors predicted whether the area is\nsuitable for harvesting or growing a\
    \ speciﬁc fruit tree using\nhigh-level protocols. The research discusses the network’s\n\
    strategy used in the business’s functionality. The authors\nexamined the protocols\
    \ and services from a high level and\nhighlighted data transport mechanisms in\
    \ a continuous\ncommunication stream. That data stream was assigned from\none\
    \ company to another and performed transit of message.\n2\nWireless Communications\
    \ and Mobile Computing\nThe main focus is on Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP)\n\
    applications, and the method used is Hypertext Markup\nLanguage. The research\
    \ claims that the Internet Protocol\n(IP) or Transmission Control Protocol (TCP)\
    \ is easier to\nhandle. Furthermore, the paper discusses appropriate HTTP\nsecurity\
    \ methods [22].\nThe research uses Address Resolution Protocol (ARP) to\nanswer\
    \ the queries of mapping from a logical address to a\nphysical address. ARP protocols\
    \ are preferred to save\ndenial-of-service (DoS) and man-in-the-middle (MITM)\n\
    attacks. So, through this, sensitive data can be exchanged\nwithout any ﬂaws.\
    \ After analyzing that no solution is feasi-\nble, the author discussed many solutions\
    \ and generated a\nstatement. Also, a secure and eﬃcient ARP version is pro-\n\
    vided through this research. The proposed version is viable\nfor all attack types\
    \ and provides a more reliable solution.\nThe authors claim that the designed\
    \ ARP is more eﬃcient\nand can solve entries related to storing in the ARP cache\n\
    [23] using particle swarm optimization (PSO). The selection\nparameters have an\

    3\nWireless Communications and Mobile Computing\nintracluster distance, residual\
    \ energy, and several optimal\nCHs. Compared to routing protocols, the model works\
    \ best\nin terms of complex network metrics [24]. The research\nhighlighted performance\
    \ and security issues. Secure Sockets\nLayer (SSL) is used to discuss security\
    \ issues. The claim is\nthat SSL is a speciﬁc protocol to facilitate user communica-\n\
    tion. Through SSL secure authentication, data encryption,\nand data decryption\
    \ can be done. This protocol provides\nexcellent security service but is less\
    \ eﬃcient in performance\nthan other protocols and services. Now we combine both\n\
    the terms “data” and “communication” as “data communi-\ncation (DC).” DC deals\
    \ with an encoded movement of infor-\nmation by using an electronic transmission\
    \ system. Data is\nsent from one point (known as a source) to another point\n\
    (known as a destination) [25]. Ahmed et al. [26] introduced\nfog computing and\
    \ WiFi-based Long Distance (WILD) net-\nworks in present WSN-based solutions to\
    \ cover long range\nwith minor delays. Also, a cross-layer-based media access\n\
    control (MAC) is adopted to observe traﬃc nature and lead\nto an assigned duty\
    \ cycle that improves delay and through-\nput. In [27], the researchers demonstrated\
    \ the consequences\nof increasing the overall processing time and decreasing the\n\
    number of bytes available in memory. The researchers\nclaimed that SSL has a higher\
    \ impact on real processing time\nwhen taking the percentage of the bytes available\
    \ in mem-\nory. The primary function of any sensor network is to route\nthe sensor-assembled\
    \ information and forward it to the BS.\nThe simplest way to transmit data is\
    \ direct transfer, where\nthe nodes have to direct their data to the base station\
    \ or sink\nnode. However, suppose the distance between the sink and\nthe network\
    \ is high. In that case, the node will die out\nquickly due to unnecessary energy\
    \ consumption. The clus-\ntering algorithm eliminates wasteful energy consumption\n\
    when delivering data to BS by grouping the network into\nclusters. Each cluster\
    \ is assigned a cluster head (CH), which\nsends data to base station (BS). Choosing\
    \ CH, which should\nensure a uniform energy distribution between the sensors,\
    \ is\ncrucial in the clustering algorithm [28]. The selective iden-\ntity attack\
    \ model is often considered in identity-based\nencryption, which means the identity\
    \ to attack should be\nannounced before the attacker requests the necessary infor-\n\
    mation. The attacker could ﬁrst pick multiple identities to\nexpose, known as\
    \ the selective multi-ID attack, for various\nreceivers Strategic Management and\
    \ Innovations Division\n(SMID) [29]. Using optoelectronic components and a poly-\n\
    dimethylsiloxane\n(PDMS)\nmicroﬂuidic\ndevice,\na\ncolorimetry-based miniaturized\
    \ device for accurately asses-\nsing two soil, nitrogen, phosphorus, and macronutrients\n\
    was constructed. A microcontroller and Bluetooth-based\nmodule are adopted to\
    \ ﬁnd the remote location and monitor\nthe data. Moreover, an android application\
    \ is also developed\nto monitor data transmission [30]. A blockchain-based opti-\n\
    mization technique is used for the system of greenhouse.\nHowever, the proposed\
    \ method performs three primary\ntasks (prediction, optimization, and controlling),\
    \ whereas\nthe Kalman ﬁlter is utilized to predict the greenhouse sen-\nsory information.\
    \ Similarly, for indoor greenhouse climate,\nthe\noptimal\nparameters\nare\ncalculated.\n\
    Finally,\nthese\nimproved parameters are used to activate and control the\nactuator\
    \ with the help of the control module. The proposed\noptimization strategy reduced\
    \ energy consumption by 19%\ncompared with prediction-based techniques and 41%\
    \ com-\npared to the baseline scheme [31]. An IoT multiagent preci-\nsion irrigation\
    \ approach enhances water usage in irrigation\nsystems. Irrigation is supervised\
    \ and regulated in each ﬁeld\nwith the help of an intelligent irrigation agent\
    \ that prescribes\nand applies the amount of water based on agronomical\nparameters\
    \ in the proposed system. The results showed that\nirrigation levels were administered\
    \ accurately on the ﬁelds,\nresulting in increased water eﬃciency [32]. Data exchange\n\
    can be done through a wireless or wired transmission\nmedium from one device to\
    \ another. In simple words, digital\ninformation transferring from one place (source)\
    \ to another\n(destination) is known as data communication (DC) [25,\n33]. Smart\
    \ agriculture consists of several parameters such\nas soil nutrients, business,\
    \ security, proﬁt, storage, and com-\nmunications. However, the soil is an essential\
    \ parameter to\nenhance business in agriculture. Measuring soil capability\nﬁrst\
    \ and then investing in it is necessary [30]. Similarly,\nthe greenhouse method\
    \ can improve or accelerate agricul-\ntural progress. As a result, a blockchain-based\
    \ technique\n[31] exists in the literature that eﬃciently monitors green-\nhouse\
    \ performance using sensory information. However,\nthis method can be implementable\
    \ after measuring the soil’s\ncapability.\nSimilarly, other methods [32] are also\
    \ used to manage or\nmonitor other agriculture components like water and honey.\n\
    Furthermore, because a large number of sensors are operat-\ning at the same time,\
    \ security is an essential aspect of intel-\nligent agriculture. Security may\
    \ be improved by addressing\nvulnerabilities and employing attack-prevention tactics.\n\
    Many methods [21–23, 25, 26] may be used to enhance net-\nwork security and performance.\
    \ The summary of literature\nis summarized in Table 2.\nThe IoT integrates the\
    \ Internet with intelligent devices\nand objects, becoming an omnipresent network.\
    \ Messages\nfrom the satellite must also be stored until they can transmit\nto\
    \ the device. The satellite IoT gateway should eventually be\nﬁtted with store-and-forward\
    \ functionality [34]. Besides, the\ngateway could also store the data received\
    \ from the smart-\nphones when traveling beyond the satellite contact range to\n\
    avoid data loss and vice versa. Moreover, because of BLIP’s\nsmaller footprint,\
    \ Berkeley IP (BLIP) makes it simple and\nstraightforward to build network apps.\
    \ We performed test-\nbeds on actual WSN consisting of TELOSB and MICAZ\nhardware\
    \ systems to discover the characteristics of LowPAN\nin (BLIP). It is important\
    \ to note that BLIP can only use the\nIPv6 unicast address that is part of the\
    \ network shared from\nthe edge router and its interface identiﬁer derived from\
    \ the\ninterface’s MAC address [35]. WSN provides a platform\nfor data processing\
    \ and networking to map and navigate\nthe natural environment and strengthen society\
    \ [36]. Wire-\nless\ntechnology\ntransfer\ndrains\nmore\nelectricity\nthan\nmachines\
    \ designed to receive or stay idle. In [37], the\nauthors developed a routing\
    \ mechanism using a memetic\nalgorithm that elevated the performance of IoT-based\
    \ WSAs\nin regards to throughput, stability period, the actual number\nof nodes,\
    \ end-to-end delay, and network lifetime. The rising\n4\nWireless Communications\
    \ and Mobile Computing\nnumber of smart devices connecting to the Internet has\n\
    made energy eﬃciency an excess parameter in the IoT archi-\ntecture. Setting up\
    \ energy-eﬃcient methods for integrating\nsensor networks has always been diﬃcult\
    \ for researchers.\nOnce combined with the IoT, control becomes a more criti-\n\
    cal concern due to the number of computers [38].\nTechnologies such as Automatic\
    \ Identiﬁcation and Data\nCapture (AIDC), barcode, QR code, and near-ﬁeld commu-\n\
    nication (NFC) are used to identify warehouse organiza-\ntions. Using NFC technology\
    \ is the opportunity to use it as\nan NFC tag reader on a cell phone. Barcodes\
    \ can provide fast\nand accurate data transmission that ensures monitoring of\n\
    products/pallets/packages and enhances service quality for\nend-users [39]. In\
    \ multilinear maps setting MPHF parame-\nters, a new ID-MRPKE scheme based on\
    \ MPHF is built. In\nthe basic model, we illustrate the security of the suggested\n\
    method. Our plan is only formulated concerning a standard\nmultilinear level map.\
    \ Using the improved noisy crypto-\ngraphic multilinear maps of Gu’s work is necessary\
    \ to con-\nstruct our scheme, which proved contrary to the attack\n[40]. The main\
    \ research focused on HTTP, highlighting that\nprotocol is the critical and essential\
    \ data communication\nprotocol. He discusses the TCP/IP model in detail and OSI\n\
    layers. He highlights the message traveling from sender to\nreceiver or client\
    \ to server. He discusses the packet tracer’s\nmonitoring and simulating mechanism\
    \ [41]. A wide variety\nof applications, including smart cities, traﬃc congestion,\n\
    waste management, systemic health, defense, emergency ser-\nvices, logistics,\
    \ retail, industrial control, and healthcare, are\nenabled by the Internet of\
    \ Things (IoT) [42]. IoT is mega\ntechnology that can build links on a website\
    \ and any net-\nwork with something, anybody, at any time, location, or\noperation.\
    \ It has a massive eﬀect on the entire blockchain\nof heterogeneous network connectivity-enabled\
    \ organiza-\ntions, intelligent objects and applications, networks, and ser-\n\
    vices built as an intellectual, ubiquitous framework of smart\ndevices. IoT devices\
    \ operating in several areas attach to\ndynamic devices and communicate with hostile\
    \ environ-\nments [43].\nThe Burrows-Abadi-Needham (BAN) logic approach\nwas used\
    \ to test the system. Cryptanalysis ﬁnds that our\nscheme can solve the security\
    \ vulnerabilities of previously\npublished techniques. The result reveals that\
    \ our scheme’s\nsecurity features are quantitative and can increase authenti-\n\
    cation performance in IoT environments. Notably, it has\nexcellent performance\
    \ reliability, low cost of computing, fru-\ngal electricity consumption, and low\
    \ communication cost\n[44]. The traﬃc route between the heads of the zone and\n\
    the base station is distance-centered and designed to elimi-\nnate data packet\
    \ loss at one hop and dual-hop speeds at\nthe site’s leaders. Each site is planned\
    \ by uniform random\ndeployment to own approximately 1/4 percent of the\ndeployed\
    \ sensor node count like network energy usage, sen-\nsor node average energy consumed,\
    \ packet distribution ratio,\npercentage of packet loss, and network throughput\
    \ [45].\nWith SWIPT, we have a modeling system for sustainable cel-\nlular mass\

    we see many apps that make our lives easy, such as smart\ncars, smart houses,\
    \ intelligent traﬃc control, intelligent\nworkplaces, innovative medical consultation,\
    \ smart cities,\netc. All such services are beyond an average citizen’s control\n\
    to improve information and communications technologies.\nThe vision of the word\
    \ Internet has continuously spread its\nwings in all facets of life over the past\
    \ few years. Identifying\nthe optimum capacity of the Internet use has been a\
    \ diﬃcult\nchallenge for researchers. Over time, items have been corre-\nlated\
    \ with the word Internet and are not known as IoT [47].\nAs the name suggests,\
    \ Radio Frequency Identiﬁcation\n(RFID), wireless sensor networks (WSN), Bluetooth,\
    \ near-\nﬁeld communication (NFC), Long-Term Evolution (LTE),\nand numerous other\
    \ intelligent communication technologies\nare related through the Internet [48].\n\
    Communication is not only between humans in sci-\nence, but it can also be between\
    \ devices or computers.\nThe exchanging of information between two (or more)\n\
    bodies is known as correspondence, while knowledge is\nused in a well-formed or\
    \ ordered manner as information\nabout someone. Data can occur in several ways,\
    \ such as\ntext (SMS) or device data in a text ﬁle or image, or a sig-\nnal, such\
    \ as cell phone data. The “digital-analog signal” or\n“digital bit” is known as\
    \ data in electronic science. Specif-\nically, data is a plural form that describes\
    \ a single piece of\nknowledge [49]. WSNs have been an integral part of appli-\n\
    cations, such as environmental surveillance, military, and\nmedical surveillance,\
    \ through feasible connectivity, practi-\ncal inspection, and application eﬃciency.\
    \ Many sensor\nnodes are composed of WSNs that are thinly deployed\nand wirelessly\
    \ communicated to transmit and receive envi-\nronmental data. At least one or\
    \ more sensors, a radio\ntransceiver, a processor, and a power supply portion\
    \ are\nﬁtted for each sensor node. Due to the sophistication of\nsuch structures,\
    \ developing WSNs is a very demanding\ntask [50]. In accumulation, some essential\
    \ speciﬁcations,\nsuch as the power consumption criterion, which is the pri-\n\
    mary key, need to be fulﬁlled during the construction of\nthe WSN. Several programming\
    \ methods, which concen-\ntrate on low-level machine problems, have been proposed\n\
    in existing real-world WSN implementations [51]. High-\nlevel processes have been\
    \ recognized, and many solutions\nhave been suggested to simplify the architecture\
    \ of the\nWSN and abstract from low-level technical data. The\nmodel-driven engineering\
    \ (MDE) methodology, in particu-\nlar, is becoming a promising alternative [52].\
    \ Figure 2\nshows the recently utilized communication technologies\nin IoT.\n\
    2.2. Communication Protocols. A set of data communica-\ntion rules is known as\
    \ a protocol. Two devices must be\nused as a protocol to perform communication\
    \ to send or\nreceive bit-streams to each system. And all the entities\nshould\
    \ be agreed on a “Protocol” to do contact. We han-\ndle the following queries\
    \ [53, 54].\n(i) What is communicated?\n(ii) How is it communicated?\n(iii) When\
    \ is it communicated?\nProtocols act like an agreement among communicating\ndevices.\
    \ Following are the elements used in the protocol.\n(1) Syntax: data structure\
    \ or format means the order in\nwhich data is presented. Like the simple protocol,\n\
    the design uses the ﬁrst 8 bits as the sender address,\nthe second (after the\
    \ ﬁrst 8 bits) 8 bits used as the\nreceiver address, and the rest\n(2) Semantics:\
    \ each section’s bit meaning is known as\nsemantic\n(3) Timing: is a combination\
    \ of two things\n(i) When sent the data\n(ii) How fast we sent it\nIf both sides\
    \ do not use the compatible mechanism,\nsome data may be lost on the receiver\
    \ side. Two systems\nmay be interconnected but can neither send the data nor\n\
    communicate without a protocol. Communication protocols\nact as the rule descriptions\
    \ through which devices are\nallowed for communication. They deal as one component\n\
    of the DC system.\n2.2.1. Transmission Control Protocol (TCP). TCP is the sig-\n\
    niﬁcant communication protocol in two or more electronic\nsystems on a network\
    \ setup. TCP allows the devices to trans-\nmit data among them. TCP breaks the\
    \ data before sending\nthem into IP packets and reassembles them at the receiver.\n\
    A system sends a request to another device through TCP\nfor communication, sending\
    \ the request to the receiver’s\naccurate address. After getting an agreement\
    \ between two\nparties/systems, TCP allows communication after setting\nup a “Full-Duplex.”\
    \ Full-Duplex maintains a communica-\ntion line between designs and work until\
    \ one of the systems\ndisconnects or closes the path. TCP/IP have several further\n\
    protocols inside them, like TCP between applications, User\nDatagram Protocol\
    \ (UDP) for the most straightforward\ncommunication among applications, Internet\
    \ Protocol (IP)\ncommunication between computers, Internet Control Mes-\nsage\
    \ Protocol (ICMP) to handle errors and check statistics,\nand Dynamic Host Conﬁguration\
    \ Protocol (DHCP) used\nfor “Dynamic Addressing.”\n2.2.2. Internet Protocol (IP).\
    \ Communication-less means no\nphysical line (cable) for communication is required\
    \ between\ntwo systems. The communication-less protocol is known as\nthe Internet\
    \ Protocol. This protocol uses a subnet mask\n6\nWireless Communications and Mobile\
    \ Computing\nand IP address to determine whether the data is remote or\non a local\
    \ network. A default gateway is used to forward data\nknown as a “router” if a\
    \ remote network links to another\nnetwork. IP used a hop to keep track of the\
    \ transverse num-\nber towards the destination.\nInternet Protocols support all\
    \ the local area network\n(LAN) types and have a point-to-point link with nodes.\
    \ IP\ncan solve the Ethernet problem of scaling. Through IP, we\ncan achieve universal\
    \ “connectivity.” IP supports global\nrouting and addressing mechanisms to send\
    \ packets of\ninformation from one host to another. The most common\nversion is\
    \ IPv4, also known as version 4; it has 4 bytes, which\nmeans 32 bits. The speciﬁc\
    \ point of IPv4 from IP is that it\nhas two parts of address: the “network part”\
    \ and the second\n“host part.” The router is vital in sending packets toward the\n\
    accurate destination system. Same as TCP, IP splits the data\ninto small-sized\
    \ boxes (independent) and is sent via the\nInternet to the system. The beneﬁt\
    \ is that each communica-\ntion line can be used simultaneously among diﬀerent\n\
    methods.\n2.2.3. Wireless Routing Protocol (WRP). This protocol com-\nprises a\
    \ routing protocol, also known as vector routing.\nRouting tables are used to\
    \ store each node’s information.\nThe store’s data is node distance value, link\
    \ cost, routing\ninformation, and information about the “Message Retrans-\nmission\
    \ List (MRL).” Each node in this interconnectivity\nhas its own path known as\
    \ the “Shortest-path Spanning Tree\n(SST)” within their adjacent nodes. These\
    \ adjacent nodes get\nupdated information. If no change occurs in the direction,\n\
    then information is directly transmitted among nodes; oth-\nerwise, a new path\
    \ is built after the new shortest path for\nrouting information. All the data\
    \ is updated in the table.\nWRP has faster transmission of information because\
    \ this\nprotocol does not use the loop phenomenon in algorithms.\n2.2.4. Address\
    \ Resolution Protocol (ARP). In the TCP/IP pro-\ntocol, another protocol is named\
    \ “Address Resolution Proto-\ncol (ARP) in the network layer protocol bottom.”\
    \ The HOST\npart is identiﬁed by 32 bits (Portion in IP address). TCP/IP\nhas\
    \ a diﬀerent addressing scheme name, “Medium Access\nControl” or MAC, and uses\
    \ 48 bits for address. The network\nlayer receives a packet and checks the destination\
    \ IP address.\nThe packet is directly sent from the sender machine to the\ndestination\
    \ machine if the destination is at some network\n(local network). If the destination\
    \ is diﬀerent, then a router\npath would be found. The sender machine needs the\
    \ MAC\nto address the destination machine for sending direct\npackets. ARP can\
    \ accomplish this. It also has an ARP cache\nto make the temporary memory map\
    \ 32 bits address to 48\nbits address scheme. ARP sends the request message (ARP\n\
    request) and receives a reply (ARP reply). ARP request is a\nform of the message,\
    \ and in this message, it depends on\nthe MAC address. Then all the hosts broadcast\
    \ this request.\nARP reply is a form of the message containing the MAC\naddress\
    \ requested.\n2.3. Protocol for Speciﬁc Purpose. Speciﬁc protocols are\ndesigned\
    \ to perform a speciﬁc task (single task) for commu-\nnication through network\
    \ systems. Some of these protocols\nare listed below, and their functionalities\
    \ are for analysis\npurposes.\n(1) Hyper-Text Transfer Protocol (HTTP) maintains\n\
    the communication between the browser and server\n[41]. For this communication,\
    \ it uses a request\nwhich sends from the browser (client) to the server\n(web),\
    \ and in return for this request, web contents\nare sent from server to browser\
    \ (client), as shown\nin Figure 3\n(2) Hyper-Text Transfer Protocol Secure (HTTPS):\n\

    \ Agriculture is the most recent trend that has\ngained popularity due to its\
    \ collaboration with systems and\nthe Internet. Using network capabilities and\
    \ computing\npower can enhance the agriculture growth rate. Instead of\ntraditional\
    \ tools, computers and the Internet can also facili-\ntate agriculture without\
    \ physical objects. For example,\napplying diﬀerent sensors to get ﬁeld updated\
    \ status could\nnot be done with old traditional tools. In 2025, according\nto\
    \ the report of the United Nations organization named\nthe “Food and Agriculture\
    \ Organization (FAO),” the total\npopulation will increase by up to 8 billion\
    \ people. This\nmeans we must build a mechanism to increase the food\ngrowth rate\
    \ (practical food production will be increased by\nup to 70%). To achieve the\
    \ target of FAD mention number\nand provide food to each person globally, we need\
    \ to intro-\nduce the modernization of agriculture technology and gener-\nate\
    \ high-quality products. Resources and a high-water\nsupply are mandatory to get\
    \ all the beneﬁcial agriculture\npoints.\nCollecting valuable measurements from\
    \ raw information\nis the goal of any research. Get the crop data that needs to\
    \ be\nprocessed in a well-deﬁned manner. A year ago, the term\n“precision agriculture”\
    \ came into the research ﬁeld to per-\nform crop management, generating digital\
    \ data (digital\ninformation). To get the appropriate or correct decision\nrelated\
    \ to the crop conditions and crop diseases, an entire\ndevelopment process is\
    \ needed to get the crop diagnoses.\nDiagnoses of any crop or ﬁeld can only be\
    \ made with ﬁeld\nexperience, and data can be perceived over a farmer’s eye.\n\
    Our primary purpose of this research is to manage the crops\nand farms with the\
    \ help of information related to the ﬁeld\nand make intelligent decisions after\
    \ diagnosing. A proper\nsystem must connect smart devices or sensors to achieve\n\
    the abovementioned objectives. The interconnectivity of\nthese devices can generate\
    \ desired information about crops.\nThis information acts as the data that is\
    \ retrieved directly\nfrom the soil and crops. There are two ways to retrieve\
    \ the\ndata from the soil. First is using the sensors and getting\ninformation\
    \ through these sensors in the form of ﬁelds. Sec-\nond, use an application or\
    \ software. This application is usu-\nally synchronized with the Internet. In\
    \ our research, we use\nthese two steps in the same order. We interconnect devices\n\
    through the computer network protocol and will build an\napplication. After receiving\
    \ data from the sensors, our con-\ntrol unit will perform a decision that means\
    \ physical action\nexecution. This action can be in any form, which means\nwe\
    \ can achieve any speciﬁc action from our machinery after\nany command.\n2.4.1.\
    \ Computer Network in Agriculture. A lot of work has\nbeen done in the last decade\
    \ to enhance the growth rate of\nagriculture. People have used Internet functionalities\
    \ and\nphysical things such as sensors in the previous decade to\nget the highest\
    \ growth rate target. When the Internet func-\ntionalities and material objects\
    \ known as “things” are com-\nbined, it made a new concept of research named the\n\
    “Internet of Things” (IoT). The structure of IoT is built upon\nthe three layers.\
    \ The three layers are (1) perception layer, (2)\nnetwork layer, and (3) application\
    \ layer. The perception\nlayer has sensing ability; the network layer is used\
    \ to send\ndata or as a data transfer, and the application layer stores\nthe data\
    \ and performs data manipulation.\nOur primary research topic is a computer network\
    \ in\nagriculture and IoT. The ﬁrst word, “Internet,” is used to\nget all the\
    \ Internet features and functionalities.\n2.4.2. Computer Network Functionalities\
    \ in Agriculture:\n(1) Perception Layer. As we mentioned earlier, this layer has\n\
    sensing ability, which means a wireless sensor node is used,\nand its processing\
    \ module is known as microcontroller unit\n(MCU). One or maybe more external or\
    \ embedded digital or\nApplication\nlayer\nData processing\nlayer\nNetwork layer\n\
    Application\nProcessing unit\nCPU\nGateways\nSensors\nSensing layer\nFigure 3:\
    \ IoT architecture.\n8\nWireless Communications and Mobile Computing\nanalog device\
    \ for sensing is used along with this node. The\nnext step is to get control of\
    \ identifying monitoring and agri-\nculture tracking during production. To get\
    \ the control\nmechanism during the show, WSN is used for logistics and\nstorage\
    \ control facilities and performed monitoring.\n(2) Network Layer. As the name\
    \ shows, the network layer\ncan connect neighboring nodes for communication, interact\n\
    with the environment or physical objects through WSN, and\nbuild a network for\
    \ data forwarding to get valuable informa-\ntion for further analysis. Communication\
    \ protocols facilitate\nnetwork functionalities and act as the bridge between\
    \ end\nnodes and Internet gateways. Standard protocols used in this\nstep are\
    \ ISA100.11a, Zigbee, Sigfox, one-NET, and wireless\nHART [63].\n(3) Application\
    \ Layer. As we know globally, billions of sys-\ntems are available and provide\
    \ Internet access and function-\nality control; identiﬁcation is necessary. To\
    \ access Internet\nmobility, we use IPv6 to handle identiﬁcation problems. This\n\
    layer has a challenging responsibility because devices’\nuniqueness is identiﬁed\
    \ at this layer. Another challenge is\nheterogeneity, which means it should achieve\
    \ diversity in\ndiﬀerent machines, either they are compatible with another\ndevice\
    \ or control power related to computing and adjust to\nthe environment. To handle\
    \ the identiﬁcation challenges,\nIPv6 supplementary uses context-aware addresses\
    \ and\nmeta-data. One software layer is used between the applica-\ntion layer\
    \ and the primary device. This software layer is mid-\ndleware and has a particular\
    \ scope in the new service\ndevelopment. Using this middleware mechanism, we get\n\
    the combined functionalities of the sensor network and\nservice-oriented architecture\
    \ (SOA) infrastructure.\n2.5. Computer Network Protocol Analysis in Agriculture.\n\
    Interconnected services in wireless technology are mainly\nsplit into six categories.\
    \ These categories are Global System\nfor Mobile Communication (GSM), Wireless\
    \ Personal Area\nNetwork\n(WPAN),\nWireless\nRegional\nArea\nNetwork\n(WRAN),\
    \ Mesh, Point-2-Point (P2P), and Low Power Wide\nArea Network (LPWAN). The purpose\
    \ of highlighting the\nwireless technology categories in the analysis section\
    \ is to\ncompare them and measure their functionality levels.\nReaders can select\
    \ the appropriate protocol for agriculture\nresearch and projects by comparing\
    \ and analyzing this\nreview paper. They can increase the growth rate, as we men-\n\
    tioned earlier. This wireless interconnectivity provides a\nwide bandwidth range\
    \ for an extensive communication\nrange. It can perform security measures and\
    \ less power con-\nsumption. Our research focus is network protocols in agri-\n\
    culture, so we provide a summarized protocol comparison\nin Table 3 as our research\
    \ ﬁnding. These protocols are used\nin the agriculture ﬁeld with speciﬁc requirements.\
    \ Through\nour research ﬁndings, readers can easily select proper com-\nputer\
    \ network protocols with high eﬃciency and compatibil-\nity with the device. However,\
    \ the comparison of IoT\nprotocols is also shown in Table 4.\nIn agriculture,\
    \ two phenomena work as vital entity in\nany project or research named (1) humidity\
    \ and (2) temper-\nature. Like temperature, humidity can irrigate the system\n\
    and wireless nodes (radio wave propagation). At tempera-\ntures like 270C to 600C,\
    \ received signals have some\nunwanted data. This is a severe issue in the development\
    \ of\nagriculture while using the wireless transceiver, their num-\nber of nodes,\
    \ and the distance among the used nodes.\n2.6. Research Approach. Climate changes\
    \ are usually consid-\nered an initial parameter to measure the changes and check\n\
    the soil condition. We apply diﬀerent sensors (more than\none) to get these measurements\
    \ in the soil. These sensors\ngenerate the data that guides us in many directions,\
    \ which\nleads us towards the higher growth of crops. For example,\nHTTP\nClient-server\

    \ is needed for a speciﬁc plant? How do we\npreserve crops from water (a high\
    \ water level is dangerous\nfor some crops; it varies from crop to crop)? What\
    \ is the\nimpact of extra irrigation on the earth’s level? What is the\natmosphere\
    \ condition? Some researchers use additional\noptical sensors to map the ground’s\
    \ situation and sense the\nremote temperature. Our integration of interconnectivity\
    \ of\nnetwork protocol can cover the larger area of the ﬁeld, and\nthrough sensing\
    \ devices, we can get more accurate condi-\ntions related to soil and weather.\
    \ With the help of this pre-\ncise information usage, we can increase the growth\
    \ rate of\ncrops. Another reason to use wireless network protocol sen-\nsors is\
    \ that they are available at reasonable prices, which\nmeans we have less impact\
    \ on cost. It allows researchers to\nTable 3: Comparison of computer network protocols\

    computational capabilities with sensor incorporation. The\nconnectivity of nodes\
    \ will increase the processing. Some\nresearchers use camera devices to get images\
    \ of the crop.\nUsing these images, they implement diﬀerent image process-\ning\
    \ algorithms and predict the attack of insects.\n2.7. Technologies Used in Agriculture\n\
    2.7.1. Sensors. Sensors are intelligent devices designed to get\nspeciﬁc information\
    \ from humans or the environment.\nThese sensors are attached or deployed on the\
    \ ground or\nin the inner soil in agriculture. After deploying the sensor,\nthe\
    \ next challenge is to get a wide range of sensors to cover\nthe maximum area\
    \ of sensors. A wide range can reduce the\noverall deployment cost because we\
    \ can cover a larger area\nof any ﬁeld. But the issue is that most organizations\
    \ focus\non the data only and ignore the range parameters. IoT sen-\nsor nodes\
    \ capture data from the farming environment, such\nas soil moisture, air humidity,\
    \ temperature, soil nutrient\ncomponents, pest images, and water quality, and\
    \ then send\nit to IoT backhaul devices. IoT sensor nodes can be deployed\nas\
    \ RFDs (reduced-function devices), which only connect\nwith FFDs (full-function\
    \ devices), depending on the opera-\ntional purpose and installation location.\
    \ Farmers can use\nsmart mobile devices, such as smartphones and tablets, to\n\
    access real-time agricultural data (soil and plant condition,\nirrigation, fertilization\
    \ [65].\n2.7.2. Satellites. Satellites are another artiﬁcial medium\nthrough which\
    \ we can get remote data to achieve smart\nfarming. Foreign countries are making\
    \ a lot of investments\nin getting satellite data, for example, “GeoEye-1 system”,\n\
    “European Sentinel 2 Satellites”, “American Landsat Satel-\nlite,” and “WorldView3.”\
    \ Asian countries do not have any\nsuccess stories about satellites to get information\
    \ about ﬁeld\nor weather data. The only solution is to use ground-level\nsensors\
    \ and their interconnectivity. It is reasonable to claim\nthat precision agriculture,\
    \ which involves gathering and uti-\nlizing data about crops, soil, and weather\
    \ conditions via\nremote sensing, signiﬁcantly reduces human eﬀort in farm\nand\
    \ ﬁeld management in North America. With a market\nvalue of $6,215.9 million in\
    \ 2021 (compared to $2,792.3 mil-\nlion in Europe), the area had the most signiﬁcant\
    \ tech mar-\nket value globally.\n2.7.3. Aircraft Systems. The distance is too\
    \ long to get accu-\nrate information and point at the target through satellite.\n\
    The minimum length is 700 kilometers, measured between\nthe satellite and the\
    \ soil. To overcome the distance issue, air-\ncraft systems are used. The minimum\
    \ distance between the\naircraft and the soil is 100 meters. In Spain, 120 meters\
    \ is\nconsidered the legal distance of an aircraft system. Com-\nmonly two aircraft\
    \ systems are used. The ﬁrst is the\n“unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs),” and the\
    \ second is the\n“remotely piloted aircraft (RPA).” Aircraft systems have\nimportance\
    \ because they can work where conventional\nground vehicles cannot perform their\
    \ duties. UAV has more\nbeneﬁts in precision agriculture.\n2.7.4. Proximal Sensing.\
    \ Sensors are known as proximal\nsensing when information is gathered from the\
    \ platform\nbased on the ground. In other words, ground-based plate\nforms are\
    \ proximal sensing. “Ground vehicles” also work\nas proximal sensing because these\
    \ vehicles are the nearest\nto the crop. They can get more accurate crop data\
    \ and more\nfeasible per meter crop samples. They can also solve the lim-\nitation\
    \ problems of sensor implementation. But they can\ndetect the weather conditions,\
    \ for example, high tempera-\nture and appropriate sunlight needed for the speciﬁc\
    \ crop.\nAircraft systems cannot perform soil scouting and crop anal-\nysis. Most\
    \ of the research progress in achieving the robots’\ntilling, seeding, pest control,\
    \ ﬁeld scout, transplanting, soil\nanalysis, and crop harvesting.\n2.7.5. Data\
    \ Gathering. The traditional farming mechanisms\ndiﬀer from the latest farming\
    \ techniques because they can-\nnot gather crop data. All crop decisions are taken\
    \ by the\nvisual assessment done by the farmer’s eye. Modern technol-\nogy assesses\
    \ and generates production decisions by using\nquantitative data. If we can compromise\
    \ on the cost, we\ncan hybridize two or more technologies and techniques for\n\
    more accurate data and gain a broader range of data. For\nexample, sensors can\
    \ perform crop data acquisition, and air-\ncraft systems can be used for other\
    \ crop-related functions.\n2.7.6. Data Representation. Crop data is usually represented\n\
    in a coherent, understandable composition for the end-\nusers. The simplest way\
    \ to show the “homogeneous zone”\nand mapping is maps format in agriculture. In\
    \ agriculture,\nmaps represent larger areas and are used in the design, mak-\n\
    ing questions to answer them. We can add or be interested\nin several parameters\
    \ to the plan. Many software is used to\ngenerate a map of a speciﬁc area. We\
    \ can also add coordi-\nnates to the map. The “Local Tangent Plane” system can\n\
    do this and provide Euclidean geometry features. Another\nfeature, the name grid,\
    \ is used in the map representation to\nshow the systematic. By using it, more\
    \ accurate information\ncan be produced.\n2.7.7. Software. “Geographic Information\
    \ Systems (GIS)” is\nused to get the practical answers and display this informa-\n\
    tion into map representation (as we mention in the data rep-\nresentation section).\
    \ This information manages all the ﬁelds.\nGIS acts as a “computer-based” tool.\
    \ Using this tool, we can\nget, manipulate, analyze, and store ﬁeld information.\
    \ As we\nmentioned earlier, “precision agriculture” has a broader\nscope; a unique\
    \ software is designed to get the information\nabout precision agriculture known\
    \ as “Filed Level Geo-\ngraphic Information System (FIS).” The drawback of this\n\
    software is that it can operate only on previous operating\nsystems like Windows\
    \ NT, 98, and 95. Some updating is\ndone in FIS to provide the information for\
    \ management\npurposes. The updated version is the “Farm Management\nInformation\
    \ System (FMIS).” A tool to help farmers manage\ntheir farms more successfully\
    \ and eﬃciently is the FMIS. To\ncultivate the farm, a system called FMIS deals\
    \ with the accu-\nracy of data, optimization of the use of resources, and proce-\n\
    dures. FMIS aims to minimize the production cost, maintain\n11\nWireless Communications\
    \ and Mobile Computing\nagriculture standards, maximize production quality, and\n\
    provide accurate decisions. Another advantage of this soft-\nware is that we automate\
    \ the whole data acquisition process.\nWe can monitor the entire process, plan\
    \ better, and make\naccurate decisions according to the situation. Some software\n\
    is so intelligently designed that they produce proper map\nrepresentation and\
    \ a decision-based model, which means\nbeginners can also make the appropriate\
    \ decision. Further-\nmore, this software also provides information about the\n\
    weather through which risk levels will be minimized.\n2.7.8. Actuation. Actuation\
    \ is the situation in which an exe-\ncutable decision is made after obtaining\
    \ the crop’s appropri-\nate information. The executable decisions mean farmers\
    \ can\nuse the advanced tools and equipment; more spray medicine\ncan be used\
    \ to prevent insects’ crops from being attacked\nafter gathering computerized\
    \ information from the control\nunit. Actuation can increase the production proﬁt\
    \ and\nreduce the impact on the environment. The actuation can\nincrease the production\
    \ rate by 35% in one ﬁeld or farm.\nSo now, we can roughly measure or assume that\
    \ the whole\nprocess positively impacts crop growth rate when we gather\nit from\
    \ area to ﬁeld.\n2.7.9. The Technology of Swath Control. Swath control can\nhandle\
    \ the overlapping issues in the area mapping. With\nthe swath control, all the\
    \ guidelines will lead to how to invest\nin farming. A farmer can increase his\
    \ farming capabilities\nwith swath size controlling through this approach. The\n\
    ﬁeld’s size and shape can change the need for fertilization\nand seeding process\
    \ and may cause irregulating applications.\nRadio frequency energy harvesting\
    \ technique is also used in\nthe agriculture domain [66].\n2.7.10. Controlling\
    \ and Monitoring via Smart Devices or\nSmartphones. Smartphones have become a\
    \ necessary part\nof our lives and played an essential role in controlling and\n\
    monitoring our daily life tasks. Researchers try to use smart\ndevices in agriculture,\
    \ especially smartphones, to manage\nand monitor purposes. An application is installed\
    \ on the\nsmartphone to control his irrigation system. Smartphones\nalready have\
    \ weather condition checking applications to\nreduce the cost of weather detection\
    \ sensors. But still, some\nsensors are required because they are not embedded\
    \ in\nsmartphones. For example, a moisture checking sensor is\nstill needed to\
    \ get the soil moisture level data. We can con-\ntrol the amount of water with\
    \ moisture information and\ndecide accordingly.\n2.8. Network Challenges in Agriculture.\
    \ In agriculture,\nmainly farming, various challenges arise. We discuss these\n\
    challenges step by step and according to their categories.\n2.8.1. Hardware. Hardware\
    \ can be directly exposed to the\nperception layer due to a challenging environment.\
    \ A chal-\nlenging environment can cover many factors like high tem-\nperature,\
    \ extreme humidity, high radiations of solar,\nincreased rain, earth vibration\
    \ in an earthquake, and strong\nair (winds) that can destroy the capability, functionality,\
    \ and\nhardware structure.\nAnother hardware factor is batteries used as power\n\
    resources; their functionalities will not be the same for long\nperiods. As a\
    \ result, substantial and long-term batteries\nand appropriate tools for programming\
    \ act as mandatory.\nAny resulting program or structure and replacement of bat-\n\
    teries will also increase the cost and the time factor. As well,\nthe disconnectivity\
    \ of interconnected devices will lead to\ndata loss. Devices sometimes lack tamper-resistant\
    \ enclo-\nsures since doing so would increase their cost. The absence\nof tamper-resistant\
    \ boxes leaves the system vulnerable to\ninteractions with outside forces, including\
    \ humans, animals,\nand farm machinery. The system integrity may be compro-\n\
    mised if a farm worker or wild animal accidentally bumps\nagainst a sensor, displacing\
    \ or removing the object from its\noriginal position. A tractor or other farm\
    \ equipment might\nstrike the device, resulting in either temporary or permanent\n\
    physical damage, data corruption, data loss, or device\ndamage.\n2.8.2. Interoperability.\
    \ In agriculture or food industries,\ninfrastructure aims to exchange goods, supply\
    \ globally, and\noptimize production. The interconnectivity of devices will\n\
    gradually transform business and make product or food ﬂow\ncontinuous with real-time\
    \ visibility. With the interconnec-\ntivity of computer protocols, we can get\
    \ high-quality product\ndata, handle computational process and storage issues,\
    \ and\nget high quality. It is a deliberate alteration of the resources\nof an\
    \ autonomous system. Robotics, autonomous tractors,\nand unmanned aerial vehicles\
    \ (UAVs) are precision agricul-\ntural technologies that are becoming more common,\
    \ espe-\ncially on big farms. Sensors, cameras, GPS, maps, and\nremote-control\
    \ systems are just a few of the aspects that\nmake this equipment function. The\
    \ autonomous system\nmay operate incorrectly or experience/cause mishaps if an\n\
    adversary alters one or more components. Failures might\ncause signiﬁcant losses\
    \ due to poor soil or crop manage-\nment, destruction of crops, structures, machinery,\
    \ and\nequipment, or even the autonomous tractor itself.\n2.8.3. Networking. The\
    \ network layer has an impact on the\nenvironmental characteristics. In agriculture,\
    \ wireless com-\nmunication is preferable because it can reduce the wire cost.\n\
    Using multipath propagation’s eﬀect, we can increase the\nlink quality level.\
    \ Like hardware, the network is also aﬀected\nby humidity, high temperature, and\
    \ diﬀerent obstacles exist-\ning in the space. So, it is a big challenge to transfer\
    \ the data\ninto its original shape in this environment’s rural behavior.\n2.8.4.\
    \ Security. Your data sent through the computer net-\nwork protocol should be\
    \ secure from external threats or\nattacks. When paired with Internet connectivity,\
    \ storage,\nadministration, and data processing create a slew of diﬃcul-\nties\
    \ and security risks. When data transfer occurs through\nthe interconnectivity\
    \ of devices, conﬁdentiality, security,\nstakeholder privacy, and authentication\
    \ are the primary con-\ncerns. The perception layer sends the protected data to\
    \ the\nnetwork layer (secure data aggregation), and then this data\naccessible\
    \ can be modiﬁed in the application layer. Hard-\nware physical security and acquisition\
    \ of information are\n12\nWireless Communications and Mobile Computing\ninvolved\
    \ in the perception layer. We can summarize the\nsecurity into three further requirements:\
    \ (1) access control,\n(2) conﬁdentiality, and (3) authentication. As we know,\n\
    devices are deployed in open areas of agriculture, which\nmeans machines are doing\
    \ their functionalities for a long\ntime without any surveillance. Other concerns\
    \ are attached\nto the security, such as modiﬁcation of tag frequency, tag\nblocker\
    \ usage, encryption, tag destruction policies, and jam-\nming. When we talk about\
    \ intelligent device restrictions,\nmany things are involved with hardware restrictions,\
    \ such\nas key distribution and routing, security, intrusion detection\nmechanisms,\
    \ and encryption algorithms. Other security\nthreats are tempering, replay attacks,\
    \ cheating, and wiretap-\nping. For example, routing attacks change network paths\
    \ to\ngain traﬃc control. Malicious nodes on IoT networks may\nattempt to change\
    \ routing pathways while data is being sent.\nAttacks like wormholes and sinkholes\
    \ might compromise\nthe communication network and gain unwanted access.\n2.8.5.\
    \ Stack. Middleware is used between the two layers (net-\nwork and application).\
    \ The responsibility of middleware is\nto act as an interface and is responsible\
    \ for communication\nand data processing. Threats can be handled at the network\n\
    layer by detecting intrusion, authentication, negotiation\nmechanisms, authentication,\
    \ negotiation mechanisms, and\nkey management. The application layer exists when\
    \ data\nstream ﬂow ends. In other words, the nearest to the cloud\nis the application\
    \ layer. Here, control structures are also\nrequired to access the management\
    \ rights and data adminis-\ntration ownership.\n2.8.6. Agriculture Potential Points.\
    \ Many services and appli-\ncations emerge with computer network protocols and\
    \ agri-\nculture,\ngaining\npopularity\nin\nrecent\nresearch.\nMany\nresearchers\
    \ are studying a system or device heterogeneity\nand implementing device integrations.\
    \ In a diﬀerent busi-\nness process, optimization analytics deals with big data.\n\
    Our government is trying to increase food production with\nfood quality and enhance\
    \ meat production (which can be\ndone only with the care of animals with each\
    \ animal’s up-\nto-date and accurate data). The meat and food production\nincrement\
    \ can increase the consumer’s request/demand.\nThe interconnectivity of devices\
    \ in the agriculture ﬁeld can\nimprove and have the ability to increase the production\n\
    cycle. It means that the agriculture ﬁeld has a secure future\nin the income sector,\
    \ and this ﬁeld has a higher impact on\nany country’s economic rate. Figure 5\
    \ shows the network\nchallenges in agriculture.\n2.9. Discussion and Future Direction.\
    \ We focused on three\nquestions in this study, addressed at the outset. As a\
    \ result,\nvarious protocols, such as SSL, HTTP, and ARP, have been\ndiscussed\
    \ in the literature. On the other hand, SSL estab-\nlishes a secure connection\
    \ and transmits data. This may be\naccomplished by using an encryption mechanism\
    \ that\nensures the security of user authentication, data, and infor-\nmation\
    \ security. The server/client connection is established\nthrough HTTP as well.\
    \ The ARP protocol is used to keep\nthe routing table updated so that linked devices\
    \ can be\nreconﬁgured. In addition, choosing the right IoT protocol\nfor your\
    \ next IoT project is crucial. As a result, this article\nanalyzes IoT protocols\
    \ and provides a concise overview of\nthe advantages and disadvantages of each\
    \ primary standard.\nDevelopers may use Nabto Edge to build Constrained Appli-\n\
    cation Protocol (CoAP) request/response clients. It does,\nhowever, circumvent\
    \ either peer’s ﬁrewall setups. This dra-\nmatically boosts the message’s credibility.\
    \ Anonymity is also\nassured out of the box since Nabto Edge bundles CoAP with\n\
    authentication, encryption, and other features. Nabto+CoAP\nis superior in terms\
    \ of latency, messaging type, built-in secu-\nrity, ease of development, and encryption.\
    \ At the same time,\nit is limited in terms of lightweight. MQTT, on the other\n\
    hand, is lightweight and ideal for low-power and compact\ndevices. Finally, the\
    \ obstacles in agricultural networks were\nhighlighted, which helped the reader\
    \ and developer grasp\nthe issues of farm networks when designing IoT applications\n\
    for agriculture. In the future, we will discuss how to make\nNabto+CoAP lightweight\
    \ and ideal for low-power device\ncompared to MQTT. What kind of parameter may\
    \ be\nimproved upon or changed to make Nabto+CoAP optimal\nand lightweight?\n\
    3. Conclusion\nIn this research, all the essential concepts of computer network\n\
    (CN) protocols are discussed in precise form. Although many\nresearch works are\
    \ done in agriculture, no one provides the\nbest protocol mechanism for speciﬁc\
    \ scenarios and require-\nments. Initially, the paper details the utilization\
    \ of CN proto-\ncols in agricultures in literature. After describing other CN\n\
    protocols (TCP, UDP, ICMP, etc.), the suggested article\npointed out that TCP\
    \ is superior since it is more eﬀective in\nterms of a three-way handshake, which\
    \ is a crucial require-\nment for networks. We have also performed CN protocol\n\

    \ Mobile Computing\nanalysis related to agriculture. Based on characteristics\
    \ such as\nlatency, messaging type, built-in security, ease to build on, and\n\
    encryption, we determined that Nabto+CoAP is far superior,\nalthough it is not\
    \ lightweight. MQTT, on the other hand, is\nlightweight and suitable for small\
    \ and low-powered devices.\nSimilarly, several network diﬃculties are also covered\
    \ in this\nstudy to provide readers a thorough understanding of them\nwhile considering\
    \ network agriculture. Agriculture is an open\nﬁeld environment, and temperature\
    \ and humidity can change\nour signal values so that sensors can generate false\
    \ output due\nto high temperature and humidity levels. As we know, many\nfoods\
    \ are destroyed due to excess rain. Our research ﬁndings\nexplain the Internet’s\
    \ existence in the agriculture ﬁeld and\nthe whole mechanism and enhancement of\
    \ growth rate with\ncollaboration.\nData Availability\nNo data were used.\nConflicts\

  explanation: 'The proposed system is a Wireless Sensor Network (WSN) composed of
    a coordinator node and sensor nodes. The coordinator node collects data from other
    nodes and sends such data to the cloud. The sensor nodes collect information from
    environmental sensors (temperature, humidity, rain, light) and operate actuators
    (e.g., watering pumps). The coordinator sends data to a cloud platform capable
    of representing data and system status in easy-to-interpret graphs. Based on sensor
    data, the coordinator node makes decisions related to enabling actuators (irrigation
    system).


    Regarding energy efficiency, every single node in the system is energy-autonomous
    thanks to batteries and a solar energy recharging solution.'

    \ technologies have been applied to agricultural environments,\nresulting in new\
    \ precision agriculture systems. Some of the multiple proﬁts of developing new\n\
    agricultural technologies and applications include the cost reduction around the\
    \ building and\ndeployment of them, together with more energy-eﬃcient consumption.\
    \ Therefore, agricultural\nprecision systems focus on developing better, easier,\
    \ cheaper, and overall more eﬃcient ways\nof handling agricultural monitoring\
    \ and actuation.\nTo achieve this vision, we use a set of\ntechnologies such as\
    \ Wireless Sensor Networks, Sensors devices, Internet of Things, or data analysis.\n\
    More speciﬁcally, in this study, we proposed a combination of all these technologies\
    \ to design and\ndevelop a prototype of a precision agriculture system for medium\
    \ and small agriculture plantations\nthat highlights two major advantages: eﬃcient\
    \ energy management with self-charging capabilities\nand a low-cost policy. For\
    \ the development of the project, several prototype nodes were built and\ndeployed\
    \ within a sensor network connected to the cloud as a self-powered system. The\
    \ ﬁnal target\nof this system is, therefore, to gather environment data, analyze\
    \ it, and actuate by activating the\nwatering installation. An analysis of the\
    \ exposed agriculture monitoring system, in addition to results,\nis exposed in\
    \ the paper.\nKeywords: agricultural automation; Arduino; energy eﬃciency; Internet\

    \ agriculture is the application of existing technologies to\nbuild better and\
    \ more eﬃcient systems to handle agriculture businesses. Nowadays, we have devices\n\
    that often have built-in complex sensors and that can connect and communicate\
    \ which each other\neasily. These devices and systems also allow collecting and\
    \ processing large amounts of data with\nfairly small and aﬀordable hardware.\
    \ Internet of Things (IoT) seeks to take these common technologies\nand devices\
    \ that are present in today’s world and interconnect everything to accomplish\
    \ new objectives\nand applications.\nThe concept of IoT together with existing\
    \ technologies opens a wide range of opportunities to\napply in the ﬁeld of agriculture\
    \ monitoring. Some of these opportunities are the following: Wireless\nSensor\
    \ Networks (WSNs), full connectivity between the system’s nodes, constant monitoring\
    \ of the\nenvironmental status, eﬃcient energy and water use in order to achieve\
    \ an autonomous system,\nor keeping the economic costs constrained.\nSustainability\

    Sustainability 2020, 12, 5913\n2 of 17\nThis paper contributes to the state of\
    \ the art by analyzing the literature to ﬁnd out the main\nfeatures involved in\
    \ most WSNs for smart irrigation systems. Secondly, the paper describes an open\n\
    system implementing all the studied technologies.\nThe projects’ target application\
    \ is small and middle-size agriculture plantations that are currently\nnot automatized\
    \ and could take advantage of a low-cost energy-autonomous sensor network.\nThe\
    \ rest of the document has the following structure. After this introduction, a\
    \ state of the art\nsection analyses the literature of similar systems and provides\
    \ a comparison between all of them.\nThen, we describe our proposed solution by\
    \ explaining the architecture, as well as the operation and\ncommunication technologies\
    \ that are used. Later, the section “Cloud analysis” describes the data\nanalysis\
    \ performed in a cloud platform using the data received from sensors. Section\
    \ ﬁve describes the\nproject from the energy eﬃciency point of view. The manuscript\
    \ ﬁnishes with a conclusion section that\nsummarizes the facts, status, and future\
    \ lines of work of the project.\n2. State of the Art\nOver the last years, there\
    \ have been huge developments in technological applications that allow\neasily\
    \ integrating and connecting multiple sensors in networks. Microcontrollers have\
    \ played a\nkey role in the proliﬁc development of IoT projects, speciﬁcally in\
    \ the ﬁeld of precision agriculture.\nThe inclusion of a WSN for gathering information\
    \ is one of the key requirements for projects within the\narea of agricultural\
    \ ﬁeld monitorization. Authors in [1] indicate that the overarching goal of the\
    \ future\nsensing systems is synergy. They also highlight that the gap between\
    \ research and practice keeps\ngrowing signiﬁcantly and that eﬀorts to integrate\
    \ WSNs with existing technologies are much needed.\nTherefore, understanding the\
    \ context of eﬃcient sensor networks on agriculture implementation can\nhelp provide\
    \ a general idea of the sector’s growing and current status [2]. It is worth mentioning\
    \ some\nof the key factors that can heavily inﬂuence the growth of this sector,\
    \ which include reduced energy\nconsumption, reduced costs, data security, scalability,\
    \ as well as common development platforms and\nconnection protocols [3].\nPutting\
    \ special focus now on the precision agriculture sector, it is interesting to\
    \ mention some of the\nIoT applications with more potential during the following\
    \ decade [4,5]: agricultural drone surveillance,\ncattle monitoring, smart greenhouse,\
    \ wide agricultural plantation management, and smart watering\nsystem. Since the\
    \ energy and water resources are rather limited and expensive, one of the main\
    \ aims\nof the agricultural sector is looking for more eﬃcient watering systems.\
    \ Currently, the development\nand investigation of watering systems are focusing\
    \ on new trends and types of watering methods,\nsuch as nebulization watering\
    \ or watering drip systems [6]. Naturally, these watering systems must be\npowered\
    \ by heavy machinery that allows big amounts of water to be pumped over large\
    \ distances.\nApart from the traditional diesel engines or centralized electric\
    \ engines, a number of additional\nsolutions are currently under development.\n\
    It is worth to mention the idea of microgrids, where small autonomous cells can\
    \ provide energy to\nactivate the aforementioned systems [7]. For middle and large\
    \ agricultural farming businesses, vertical\nand seamless integration between\
    \ all features is needed, primarily in areas where the connection to the\nmain\
    \ distribution grid is not possible. A clarifying example is SenseFarm that allows\
    \ implementing\na sensor network based on LoRa, which was originally designed\
    \ for smart cities [8]. The most\ninteresting aspect of this solution is a common\
    \ base of technologies that can be easily adapted for\ndiﬀerent applications.\n\
    We review now a number of additional studies that have implemented other agricultural\
    \ systems\nthat use technologies similar to ours. Ramani et al. [9] designed a\
    \ system based on Arduino-compatible\ndevices, which included sensors and wireless\
    \ communication through 3G. This system was also able\nto generate its own energy\
    \ through photovoltaic panels. Saxena et al. [10] proposed a similar system,\n\
    where they introduced a solar-based WSN with several distributed nodes to measure\
    \ humidity and\ntemperature using sensor data.\nSustainability 2020, 12, 5913\n\
    3 of 17\nAdditionally, Adenugba et al. [11] described a solar-based energy harvesting\
    \ WSN system that\ncontrols the irrigation through sensor values and a weather\
    \ prediction. This prediction is based on\nhistoric and current data to determine\
    \ through neural networks if it is going to rain on a certain day\nor not.\nMekonnen\
    \ [12] described a WSN based on Arduino and ZigBee communication protocol that\n\
    includes an oﬀ-grid photovoltaic cell to supply power to the system. They collect\
    \ sensor data in a\ncloud platform to provide graphs about the sensor data evolution.\
    \ As the main contribution, their\nsystem implements also machine learning algorithms\
    \ to determine the actions to be taken regarding\nirrigation. Vij et al. [13]\
    \ also described a very similar system. The work of Jin et al. [14] is also\n\
    aligned to the AI-oriented proposals. They use a hybrid deep learning model to\
    \ obtain more accurate\npredictions of temperature, wind speed, and humidity to\
    \ meet the needs of precision agricultural\nproduction. Marcu et al. [15] described\
    \ a system that contains sensors collecting several parameters,\nsuch as temperature,\
    \ leaf wetness, relative humidity of the air, and soil and solar radiation. The\
    \ nodes\nare also powered by solar cells and batteries and send the data to a\
    \ cloud platform to generate a\ngraphical representation.\nKumar et al. [16] proposed\
    \ a cost-eﬀective system that monitors sensor data such as soil moisture,\ntemperature,\
    \ relative humidity, and light intensity to automate the irrigation and provide\
    \ a graphical\nrepresentation of the values. Sudharshan et al. [17] focused their\
    \ design on the use of fuzzy logic to\nautomatize the irrigation. The system also\
    \ uses a solar cell to power the system. Sharma et al. [18]\nalso focused their\
    \ work on maximizing the WSN network lifetime using a solar energy harvesting\n\
    technique. However, their work is just a mere simulation of network lifetime;\
    \ they did not really create\na prototype.\nKhoa [19] also described an Arduino-based\
    \ WSN with WiFi and LoRa wireless communications.\nThey measured ﬁve parameters\
    \ to increase crop productivity: temperature, temperature–humidity,\nsoil moisture,\
    \ rain, and water level. Their studies indicate an improvement of 30% in economic\
    \ beneﬁts\nwith respect to the traditional watering method. However, this system\
    \ does not include any energy\nharvesting technology to avoid the necessity of\
    \ a wired power supply. The system developed by\nDevanand et al. [20] does not\
    \ need energy harvesting of any form either. They centered their design in\na\
    \ cost-eﬀective Arduino platform. It provides automatic irrigation based on sensor\
    \ values, although it\ndoes not provide any cloud analysis.\nMahbub’s [21] WSN\
    \ is based on Arduino devices that use WiFi for node communication, and the\n\
    coordinator node uses GSM to send data to the cloud. It also uses a photovoltaic\
    \ cell to power the\nnodes. The data analysis done in this project is based on\
    \ a Google Sheet, which allows creating simple\ngraphs showing the evolution of\
    \ the data. As the main contribution, this system implements an SMS\nalert system\
    \ with predeﬁned messages to the farmer.\nZervopoulos et al. [22] also described\
    \ an Arduino WSN system that uses ZigBee and WiFi for\ncommunications. Their study\
    \ especially focused on message synchronization and network problems in\nnetworks\
    \ with a high number of nodes. Touseau et al. [23] also worked on a similar topic\
    \ developing\ndisruption-tolerant RESTful support for smart agriculture. They\
    \ used an HTTP REST web service and\nCoAP protocols for this purpose. In this\
    \ case, they used Raspberry Pi boards for each node.\nTrilles et al. [24] proposed\
    \ an open and low-cost sensorized system for the cultivation of a vineyard.\n\
    Their system is based on Arduino boards and uses Bluetooth for node-coordinator\
    \ communication\nand GPRS for coordinator-cloud communication. The messaging service\
    \ is orchestrated through\nlightweight REST messages. They use a solar panel and\
    \ a battery to provide energy to the system.\nThe system uses sensor data (temperature,\
    \ humidity, and rainfall) to send SMS notiﬁcations.\nBased on this analysis, we\
    \ can conclude that Arduino-compatible devices are the most popular\ndevices chosen\
    \ for the development of smart agriculture, at least for the experimental systems\
    \ described\nin the literature. Most of them use ZigBee and WiFi technologies\
    \ for nodes-coordinator communication,\nas well as GSM or LoRa for communication\
    \ between the coordinator-node and the cloud platform.\nFurthermore, most of them\
    \ include some kind of energy harvesting system, usually through a\nSustainability\
    \ 2020, 12, 5913\n4 of 17\nphotovoltaic cell. Finally, most of these systems use\
    \ the data from sensors (mostly temperature and\nhumidity) to activate the watering\
    \ systems when needed.\nAfter this literature review, we can summarize the main\
    \ conclusions on WSN features in agriculture\nenvironments as follows:\n•\nEnergy\
    \ autonomy: Energy autonomy is usually obtained by energy harvesting, for example,\n\
    based on solar cells. This is very helpful to be able to install the nodes in\
    \ any place without having\nto worry about energy supply.\n•\nIrrigation based\
    \ on sensor values and real-time weather forecast: Irrigation is implemented\n\
    commonly based on sensor values to eﬃciently estimate the adequate quantity of\
    \ water and\nenergy needed. For example, irrigation systems frequently use real-time\
    \ weather forecasts to\nminimize the quantity of water and energy in order to\
    \ avoid unnecessary irrigation.\n•\nRemote visualization: Cloud analysis and remote\
    \ multi-device visualization are implemented to\nallow operators/owners to monitor\
    \ the exploitation in real-time.\n•\nMessage orchestration: Large WSNs require\
    \ some message orchestration to ensure that the\ncoordinator node is able to receive\
    \ and process in the correct order the data sent by the rest of\nthe nodes.\n\
    •\nAlert systems: Most systems implement alerts to notify the operator/farmer\
    \ about events that\nneed attention.\n•\nCost-eﬀective design: Having the lowest\
    \ investment possible is an important factor to be\nable to have a proﬁtable business,\
    \ and having cost-eﬀective designs is a mandatory feature of\nthese systems.\n\
    •\nOpen project: The use of open hardware and/or free software usually reduces\
    \ considerably the\ninvestment and facilitates the deployment, interoperability,\
    \ and prototyping. Furthermore,\nthis hardware and software facilitate personalization\
    \ of the ﬁnal system according to the\nrequirements.\nFinally, if there is a community\
    \ around the product, they can support the\ninstallation and maintenance, as well\
    \ as ensure continuous improvements.\nOnce these main features to study are deﬁned,\
    \ we can compare (see Table 1) each one for the\nanalyzed systems. As can be seen,\
    \ none of the analyzed systems covers all the studied features. For that\nreason,\
    \ in our study, we proposed a system that includes all of them. Next sections\
    \ will provide a\ndetailed description of the proposed system.\nTable 1. Comparison\

    5. Energy Efficiency \nEnergy management is another one of the key points of IoT\
    \ agricultural projects, especially for \nthose that are located in a large unwired\
    \ area. The end devices that incorporate a full sensor suite \nmust have energy\
    \ autonomy. In other words, no external power is available to supply them with\
    \ \nenergy. In order to reach this target, three components are often needed:\
    \ a renewable power source, \nan energy storage unit, and a charge/discharge control\
    \ module to handle the battery operations. \nTo achieve a fairly efficient energy\
    \ system, a set of LiPo batteries together with reduced-size \nsolar panels were\
    \ installed in every sensor node. Due to the complexity of the LiPo batteries,\
    \ a \nspecific controller is needed to manage the load of the battery. For this\
    \ purpose, a LiPo Rider module \nwas chosen. \nIn this way, we achieved good energy\
    \ efficiency through a self-charging module that permits \nthe sensor node to\
    \ work autonomously for extended periods of time. This was achieved by using \n\
    specific Arduino code and hardware configuration that help to reduce the base\
    \ rate of energy \nconsumption and a solar panel/battery tuple. \n5.1. Nodes \n\
    The Arduino models analyzed for the prototyping were Arduino Mega ADK, Arduino\
    \ Uno, \nand Arduino Nano. Each of these three mentioned models is composed of\
    \ a microcontroller together \nwith several other board elements. By studying\
    \ different models, we aimed to accomplish two \nobjectives. Firstly, we aimed\
    \ to test the minimum required features regarding the number of sensors, \ninputs,\
    \ and so on, and contextualize this with its economic potential. The second objective\
    \ was about \nthe energy consumption of these modules in each field of application.\
    \ \nIn Table 2, a visual comparison of different energy hardware and software\
    \ setups shows the \nduration and consumption, giving an idea of which are the\
    \ main key points about the energy \nconsumption pattern in Arduino devices. It\
    \ is important to note that these consumption values are \nbased on an individual\
    \ ATmega328P Microcontroller and Arduino Uno board, which also include \nFigure\

    \ in\nidle state and using software energy-saving technics through Sleep modes.\n\
    Sustainability 2020, 12, 5913\n14 of 17\nTable 2. Arduino consumption comparison\

    \ based on Sleep_MODE_PWR_DOWN.\nA conclusion from Table 2 is that some of the\
    \ most important consumption problems are\nrelated to non-linked microcontroller\
    \ elements. This information opens a potentially wide range of\nenergy-related\
    \ improvements that can be accomplished by reducing the number of non-essential\n\
    elements included by default in Arduino boards. Eventually, this can help to create\
    \ more energy-eﬃcient\nnodes. Recapitulating, testing which is the minimum technical\
    \ requirement allowed selecting the\nappropriate Arduino Board for each node function.\
    \ Therefore this was an important point about energy\nimprovement experimentation\
    \ regarding the Arduino platform. Other component consumption,\nfrom sensors or\
    \ ZigBee modules, will be presented in the following sections, but power consumption\n\
    can be considered of marginal respect to Arduino module consumption.\n5.2. Sensors\n\
    Regarding sensor energy consumption and diﬀerent powering modes, it naturally\
    \ depends on\nthe nature and model of the sensors. However, this project seeks\
    \ to establish a base to allow future\ndevelopment to speciﬁc agriculture applications.\
    \ Due to this ﬁnal target, speciﬁc sensor models are not\na priority. Commonly,\
    \ we use generic sensors to collect temperature, rain, or humidity measurements.\n\
    5.3. Communications\nAnother aspect for consideration is the one regarding the\
    \ use of speciﬁc protocols for internal\nand external communications. The ZigBee\
    \ protocol provides better adaptability to particular IoT or\nWSN needs, e.g.,\
    \ reducing energy consumption, packet size, simpliﬁed design of speciﬁc topologies,\n\
    or network routing are some of the advantages. This makes the implementation much\
    \ easier, robust,\nand secure.\nRegarding the energy consumption, ZigBee protocol\
    \ counts on parameters leveraging\nconﬁguration parameters to achieve lower energy\
    \ consumption, such as sleep modes. In Table 3, XBee\nZigBee power consumptions\
    \ in several available modes are presented.\nTable 3. XBee ZigBee Serie 1 power\
    \ consumption per hour [27].\nXBee ZigBee Mode\nConsumption\nSleeping Mode 1\n\
    10 µA to 49 µA\nAwake Mode\n50 mA\nTransmitting Mode\n45 mA\nReceiving Mode\n\
    50 mA\n1 Consumption may vary according to diﬀerent sleeping modes and supply\
    \ voltage.\nAnother point regarding the protocols is QoS (Quality of Service),\
    \ routing algorithm,\nand bandwidth organization. Finding a lighter protocol and\
    \ its correct parameter and keeping\nthe best network performance is not a trivial\
    \ task.\nSustainability 2020, 12, 5913\n15 of 17\n5.4. Self-Charging System\n\
    Achieving a system that can eﬃciently provide suﬃcient energy is one of the main\
    \ targets. Due to\nthis fact, a more extensive experimentation process was conducted\
    \ for this decision. Regarding both\nWSN and IoT projects, energy management is\
    \ one of the most limiting issues to take care of. A solution\ncan be functional\
    \ and technically correct from a design perspective, but in real situations deployed\n\
    in rural areas, these solutions must endure diﬀerent environmental and operational\
    \ aﬀairs, working\nproperly and for long periods of time. In order to reach this\
    \ target, the proposed energy system can be\nsplit into three parts.\nA set of\
    \ photovoltaic solar panels (6 V 1 W) will provide the energy system with a renewable\n\
    energy source. In the market, there are plenty of versions with diﬀerent capacity,\
    \ size, technology,\nand pricing. We tested several models for the sensor nodes,\
    \ but since our choice was restricted by the\ncost-performance ratio, we eventually\
    \ selected a standard photovoltaic panel.\nBatteries are the ones allowing the\
    \ deployed system’s prototype to continue operating during night\nhours. In the\
    \ market, there are plenty of models and technologies regarding batteries. After\
    \ evaluating\nthe diﬀerent alternatives, a LiPo battery was ﬁnally included. These\
    \ batteries are currently the most\nfrequently employed in a project such as,\
    \ for example, radio-control planes or drones. These batteries\nare interesting\
    \ for IoT projects due to their capacity and constant discharging rate. Regarding\
    \ the\nnegative points, two factors must be mentioned. The price of these batteries\
    \ is not cheap, but it is still\naﬀordable. Perhaps, the most important disadvantage\
    \ lies in the handling complexity.\nDue to the previously mentioned complexity\
    \ for using LiPo batteries, a third component is needed.\nA device must control\
    \ the charge and discharge of the LiPo battery at all times. This is highly important\n\
    because an incorrect setup or unbalanced charge in the design of these LiPo batteries\
    \ could lead to\nmalfunctioning or accidents. There are several of these controllers\
    \ on the market. In this project, a LiPo\nRider was chosen.\nTaking into consideration\
    \ the previously discussed power consumption of each system component,\nthe whole\
    \ device is able to work day and night autonomously. The system uses the LiPo\
    \ battery\nduring those periods of time when light is not available and a solar\
    \ panel as a recharging element.\nThus, the device can sustain extended periods\
    \ of work without further energy support.\n6. Conclusions\nIn this manuscript,\
    \ we have introduced a low-cost, energy-eﬃcient WSN system for smart\nirrigation.\
    \ The system provides contributions not only related to energy- and cost-eﬃciency,\
    \ but also\nregarding the data analysis done based on weather forecasts and sensor\
    \ values. This analysis allows\nreducing the number of times that the pump is\
    \ activated, which translates into water and energy\nsavings. However, the system\
    \ not only reduces water and energy consumption but also provides\ndetailed information\
    \ about the savings derived from its use and triggers automatic notiﬁcations.\n\
    From the design point of view, one of the most important factors to reduce the\
    \ gap between a\nprototype model and a market-ready system is the economic cost.\
    \ As mentioned in the introduction,\none of the main targets of this project was\
    \ to present an interesting and aﬀordable solution for middle\nand small farming\
    \ companies. With this idea in mind, several technical decisions have been made\n\
    under these premises. Environmental sensors are among the most common and well-known\
    \ sensors\nin the market. LiPo batteries are widely used in radio-control modeling.\
    \ Furthermore, open hardware\ndevices like Arduino are easy to obtain. These devices\
    \ have a broad support community around with\nthousands of users, projects and\
    \ tutorials. Additionally, this project is not only based on open hardware\ndevices\
    \ such as Arduino, but the ﬁnal schemas and codes were also released as open hardware\n\
    and software with the intention of creating a not-for-proﬁt community around the\
    \ system to ensure\ncontinuous evolution.\nFinally, it is worth to mention that\
    \ among the future lines of work, authors plan to evolve the\nelectronic design\
    \ towards a PCB to get cheaper devices in order to signiﬁcantly reduce the total\
    \ cost\nSustainability 2020, 12, 5913\n16 of 17\nof the project. In addition,\
    \ authors plan to perform in-ﬁeld real energy-consumption measures to\ncompare\
    \ if the oﬃcial information provided by the datasheets corresponds to the real\
    \ ones.\nAuthor Contributions: Conceptualization, J.R.-R., Á.M. and S.M.; Formal\

    extract_1: 'The proposed system is a WSN consisting of a coordinator node, which
      is in charge of collecting sensor data from the rest of the nodes and sending
      such data to the cloud. Additionally, there is a set of sensor nodes that collects
      the information from sensors (temperature, humidity, rain, or light) and handles
      the actuators (e.g., watering pump).


      The coordinator sends data to the cloud platform, which is able to represent
      the received data and system status in graphs that are easily interpretable
      by the user. The coordinator node takes the decisions about how and when the
      actuators (irrigation system) must be enabled based on the sensor data and forecast
      data. Depending on weather conditions and sensor values, the coordinator node
      will send the command to the nodes to activate the irrigation.'

    Keywords Metrics Abstract: Water is becoming scarcer. The unmonitored control
    and the extensive use of fossil fuel in water-table pumping for irrigation exacerbate
    global warming and harm the environment. Along with the rapid population growth
    and the concomitant increase in the demand for food, optimal usage of water-table
    and energy is becoming a must and indispensable for sustainable agriculture. In
    this context, Smart Agriculture (SA) is emerging as a promising field that leverages
    ICT (Information and Communication Technology) to optimize resources’ usage while
    enhancing crops’ yields. In this paper, we present an integral SA solution that
    leverages cost-effectiveness . Commercial solutions are costly and thus become
    impossible to adopt by small and medium farmers. Our solution revolves around
    three main axes: 1. Smart Water Metering promotes optimal usage and conservation
    of water-table (a.k.a., groundwater) via real-time data collection and monitoring
    using a Cloud-based IoT (Internet of Things) system; 2. Renewable-Energy integration
    promotes energy-efficient agriculture by reducing reliance on fossil fuels in
    water-table pumping, and 3. Smart Irrigation to promote good crops quality and
    quantity without harming the soil and the water-table ecosystems. Our solution
    has been deployed and tested in a real-world Smart Farm testbed. The results have
    shown that the adoption of our SA system reduces the amount of water consumption
    (with a traditional irrigation system) up to 71.8%. Finally, our solution is open-source
    and can be easily adopted and adapted by other researchers to promote the setting
    of a dedicated Cloud-based platform for water-table usage, especially in arid
    and sub-Saharan countries. IoT Based Smart Agriculture: Testbed General Architecture.

    I. Introduction Water is the basis and the main engine of life on earth. Humans
    use water for industrial purposes, sanitation, and irrigation. In the last decades,
    the annual water withdrawal ranged between 11 billion and 15 billion cubic meters
    per year, out of which 69 % is used in agriculture [1]. Unfortunately, most of
    this water is wasted because of inadequate irrigation control systems. As in most
    arid and sub-Saharan countries, agriculture in Morocco is the largest consumer
    of fresh water, especially after launching the Green Plan program in April 2008
    [2]. This program aims to promote agriculture as an efficient sector capable of
    advancing the economy, fighting poverty, and preserving many people in rural areas
    efficiently and sustainably. Within the framework of this program, the government
    provided many facilities and assistance to farmers and investors in irrigated
    agriculture to provide enough basic food for local consumption and export promotion
    programs. However, the level of Smart Agriculture penetration in Morocco remains
    very low. In addition, investors in the irrigated agricultural projects started
    sounding alarms of severe depletion of groundwater on the horizon [3] and the
    lack of a cost-effective real-time data collection in irrigation systems in farming
    fields that will enable them to benefit from the advanced modern technologies.
    There is a need to develop a cost-effective and sustainable data acquisition system
    for smart agriculture applications in sub-Saharan fields for sustainable, efficient,
    and smart agriculture. The system should use renewable energy and the latest Information
    and Communication Technologies (ICT) that can sustain the aridity of an agricultural
    environment. When combined with reasonable control and management and data analytics,
    the data acquisition system can play an essential role in increasing agricultural
    productivity and improving the quality of crops. Most importantly, unlike the
    traditional methods of irrigated agriculture that widely use underground water
    reservoirs and resort to fossil fuels, especially gas, as a source of energy.
    Smart agriculture (SA) exploits modern management systems to rationalize water
    consumption and adopt renewable energies as a source of energy, thus rendering
    the agricultural sector eco-friendly. In this paper, we are presenting an integral
    and cost-effective SA solution. When approached from a Cyber-Physical System (CPS)
    perspective [4], our solution relies on four main ICTs: 1. A Wireless Sensors
    Network (WSNs) monitor, in real-time, the plant environmental conditions, e.g.,
    weather and soil conditions, 2. A Wireless Actuators Network (WAN) acts upon electric
    appliances such as water pumps and light bulbs, 3. A Cloud-based IoT platform
    for real-time data storage, processing, and visualization; and 4. A Fuzzy Logic
    Control module decides on monitoring irrigation durations based on the real-time
    acquired differences between desired and ambient soil moisture. We deployed our
    open-source software solution for data acquisition, actuation, and control. We
    built our cost-effective sensors and actuators using off-the-shelf cheap nano-Arduinos.
    Finally, we leveraged an existing free Cloud-based IoT platform, e.g., NodeRED
    [5]. In this paper, and by considering optimal water-ground usage, renewable energy
    integration, and open-source ICT-based smart irrigation, we aim to contribute
    towards the smooth penetration of Smart Agriculture into underprivileged sub-Saharan
    countries. We are further envisioning, through this work, to set a solid cornerstone
    for establishing a dedicated Cloud-based and HPC (High-Performance Computing)
    platform [6] to collect real-time data about water-table usage. This data, which
    falls under the big data category, as it bears the big data 3Vs (Volume, Velocity,
    and Variety) [7], and along with appropriate Big Data Analytics tools, will tremendously
    assist in promoting eco-friendly smart agriculture. The paper contributions are
    as follows: We present a real-world, cost-effective, and easy-to-deploy general
    architecture for a Smart Farm testbed that the research community can easily adopt
    and adapt for further testing and improvement. We detail how to use open-source
    software and leverage Cloud Computing for wireless sensor data storage and processing.
    We demonstrate the integration of our developed cost-effective wireless sensors
    and actuators using off-the-shelf hardware in a real-world case study. We show
    how integrating renewable energy into smart farms paves the path towards adopting
    our solution in off-grid sites, e.g., arid and sub-Saharan areas. We prove that
    by adopting fuzzy logic into smart drip irrigation, our system reduces water consumption
    by up to 71.8%, thus contributing to sustainable water-table usage. The rest of
    the paper is organized as follows. The background is presented in Section 2, and
    the related work is overviewed in Section 3. The general system architecture and
    design are described in Section 4. In Section 5, we discuss the results and evaluate
    the findings. Finally, in Section 6, we conclude and present our future work.
    SECTION II. Background A. Smart Agriculture as a Cyber-Physical System The rapid
    technological developments of the Internet of Things (IoT), WSN, and Embedded
    Systems in recent years have enabled the development of modern systems and applications
    that have completely changed our lives. CPSs are among the most powerful of these
    modern systems, and Smart Agriculture is a CPS. CPS refers to systems that ideally
    integrate software and hardware components to perform precise tasks. A formal
    definition states: “Cyber-Physical System is defined as transformative technologies
    for managing interconnected systems between its physical assets and computational
    capabilities” [8]. As shown in Fig. 1, the general CPS architecture combines embedded
    computing, wireless sensors, and actuators networks to monitor and control the
    physical environment and give it the ability to adapt itself to new conditions
    in real-time through feedback loops. Its ability to combine different technologies
    and make them integrated has made CPS a crucial technological revolution that
    brings innovation to multiple industries by replacing traditional processes in
    many application areas with new and modern ones. FIGURE 1. Cyber-physical systems
    (CPS) general architecture. Show All Smart agriculture is one of the most promising
    CPS applications that will positively affect human life. SA can preserve a significant
    amount of water and energy through its ability to monitor multiple resources such
    as irrigation and solar energy systems. As a CPS, it replaces the traditional
    agricultural system with a smart and modern one that provides accurate agricultural
    management by collecting and processing data related to the plant, the weather,
    and the soil, in real-time mode and using precise control methods. The interaction
    of the main components of SA as a closed-loop control CPS is depicted in Fig.
    2. This figure includes the field, the control center, the Wireless Sensors and
    Actuators Network (WSAN), and the drip irrigation system. FIGURE 2. Smart farm
    as a closed CPS (Cyber physical system). Show All B. Wireless Sensor Networks
    (WSN) The rapid developments in wireless communication technologies, micro-electromechanical
    systems, and digital electronics have given rise to WSN [9]–[11]. The latter consists
    of sensor nodes that monitor the agricultural environment needed data, such as
    temperature, humidity, soil moisture, motion, and pressure, and send through a
    gateway towards the data processing server(s). This data can be hosted locally
    or remotely in the Cloud [12]. Once processed and analyzed, it becomes information
    that can be visualized (e.g., using plots and charts) and sent to the control
    unit to react upon and take actions, e.g., switching On/Off water pumps and drip
    irrigation motors. One of the main advantages of WSN is that it reduces the cost
    of wiring and makes it practical and easy. According to some studies, WSN will
    have the ability to eliminate from 20% to 80% of the installation costs [13].
    The general structure of a wireless sensor node is depicted in Fig. 3 and consists
    of four units [14]: The Sensing Unit consists of sensor modules that sample the
    environmental conditions of the deployment field. The Processing Unit consists
    of a microcontroller with a CPU and memory to run code and process the data. The
    Transmission Unit: This unit modulates digital data and sends it wirelessly. Several
    wireless technologies are adopted for this unit. In our deployment, we are using
    ZigBee [15]. The power Supply Unit is the Lithium-ion (Li-ion) battery that powers
    the wireless sensor node. FIGURE 3. General architecture of a wireless sensor
    node. Show All C. Internet of Things (IoT) With the rapid advancement in ICT,
    today’s era has left the concept of the internet far behind, and a new concept
    has emerged: the IoT. There are many definitions of IoT set by many organizations
    working globally. ITU-T (International Telecommunication Union Telecommunication
    Standardization Sector) has defined IoT as “Global infrastructure for Information
    Society, enabling advanced services by interconnecting (physical and virtual)
    things based on existing and evolving, interoperable information and communication
    technologies” [13]. [16] defines IoT as a technology that combines the internet
    and existing resources to control devices. This control is ensured by using various
    IoT communication technologies such as Bluetooth, ZigBee, Long-Range (Lora), Zensys
    Wave (Z-Wave), SigFox, Wi-Fi, GPRS, 4G, and 5G [17]. Even though IoT is mainly
    about connecting and automating things (objects) over the internet, human intervention
    gives this concept the possibility of existence. The interrelationship between
    the three sections that make up the IoT is illustrated in Fig. 4. FIGURE 4. Tri-sectional
    relationship between the three components of IoT. Show All IoT is witnessing continuous
    progress and has a promising future. Statistics indicate that the number of IoT-connected
    devices is expected to rise to 43 billion devices by 2023 [18]. Furthermore, the
    total IoT market worldwide was worth around \\(389 billion in 2020, and it is
    expected to rise to more than one trillion US dollars in 2030 [19]. This optimistic
    future vision reinforces the necessity to develop newer communication technologies
    that enable the synchronization of the largest possible number of new devices
    with sensors over the internet. Fig. 5 shows the persistent increase in connected
    devices/things over the internet for ten years (2015-2025) [20]. FIGURE 5. IoT
    connected devices in 2015-2025. Show All Given that IoT is a fertile research
    area that both the academic and industry sectors are interested in, all indications
    show an urge to deploy novel technologies to cope with the rapid increase in IoT
    deployment and adoption. In this regard, 5G and its Massive Machine Type Communication
    (mMTC) component is excellent news for the IoT market, and it will have a significant
    impact on it [19]. Through mMTC, 5G networks will inevitably improve the reliability
    and performance of many vital ICT-related domains of substantial interest to society,
    such as smart mobility, smart grid, smart buildings, and smart agriculture. The
    following section presents some critical IoT applications in SA. D. IoT Applications
    in Smart Agriculture IoT and connected objects have invaded our daily lives in
    all fields, from smart TVs to connected cars: all our activities are facilitated
    by these new tools, which significantly increase our comfort. All studies confirm
    that the potential of connected things is enormous. For example, a study done
    by Fortune Business Insight indicates that the global IoT market size is projected
    to reach $ 1,854.76 billion by 2028. It is set to exhibit a Compound Annual Growth
    Rate (CAGR) of 25.4% during the forecast period between 2021 and 2028 [21]. The
    applications of IoT are numerous and cover many areas. The most appealing IoT
    applications in Agriculture are presented next. 1) Smart Greenhouses Greenhouse
    farming enhances the quality and quantity of crops production through manual control
    of environmental conditions [22]. A smart greenhouse can be created using IoT
    by deploying sensors and motors that intelligently monitor and control the climate
    conditions based on the needs of the plants [23]. Several operations will be automatic
    by adopting this innovative agricultural system, such as opening and closing windows,
    adjusting the cooling and heating system, and turning on/off light bulbs. Thus,
    manual intervention is no longer required. 2) Smart Irrigation Management The
    currently adopted irrigation methods are somewhat advanced and depend on watering
    at specific times, which does not require much human intervention. Still, at the
    same time, it involves a high degree of guesswork and can be very wasteful in
    terms of water and energy consumption. Some field parts are under or over irrigated
    even with modern irrigation systems. Besides, although farmers would stop irrigation
    systems when expected to rain, sometimes they do not check the weather to adjust
    their schedules accordingly. The smart irrigation management system can consider
    all of this by using precision farming methodologies and IoT-enabled sensors that
    monitor soil moisture levels, humidity, and temperature everywhere in the field.
    The control based on this data automatically adjusts irrigation schedules. It
    also provides the exact amount of water where and when needed to create optimal
    conditions for the plant for a better yield without wasting water and energy.
    3) Integration Into Smart Grid Renewable energy integration into Smart Agriculture
    would serve as a bias to link Smart Farms to Smart Grids (SG) [17]. Smart farms
    are both energy producers and consumers. An SG is an electricity distribution
    network that promotes the flow of information between suppliers and consumers
    to adjust the flow of electricity in real-time and allows more efficient management
    of the electricity network [24], [25]. Smart grid benefits from the significant
    development that IoT and embedded systems are witnessing to optimize energy production,
    distribution, consumption, and storage. It improves the energy efficiency of the
    assembly by minimizing line losses and optimizing the yield of the means of production
    used, taking into consideration the real-time consumption. E. Cloud-Based Big
    Data Analytics Platforms This study uses Node-RED, an open-source flow-based programming
    tool that allows wiring hardware devices, application programming interfaces (APIs),
    and online services. We used the built-JavaScript-based library on Node.js to
    develop the application. We wired pre-programmed nodes represented by appropriate
    icons and created the application’s different needed functional IoT components.
    Node-RED contains several node types, each of which has a specific function. For
    instance, the debug-out nodes are used to monitor the flow. The inject nodes trigger
    a flow manually by clicking on it or automatically at regular intervals. The function
    nodes allow JavaScript code to be run on the messages passed through it. Furthermore,
    dashboard nodes allow us to display data [26]. In this work, we wired up input,
    output, and processing nodes to create needed flows for data preprocessing, processing,
    storage, and controlling the water pumps and the lighting system, as well as sending
    alerts. The deployed Node-Red flow construction of our irrigation control system
    is depicted in Fig. 6. FIGURE 6. NodeRED irrigation control flow construction.
    Show All SECTION III. Related Work Several studies have been carried out in Smart
    Agriculture (SA). Authors in [27] covered state of the art in SA systems from
    a big data perspective. Their work aimed at introducing big data processing into
    SA. Besides, the authors presented a detailed evolution of the different agricultural
    systems was presented. It showed that SA could explore the full potential of information
    communication technology (ICT) by using various data sources. In [28], D. Glaroudis
    et al. provided a detailed survey about the most used messaging protocols in IoT
    applications. Based on the up-to-date references, they introduced, analyzed, and
    compared six protocols: Advanced Message Queuing Protocol (AMQP), Message Queuing
    Telemetry Transport (MQTT), Constrained Application Protocol (CoAP), Extensible
    Messaging and Presence Protocol (XMPP), WebSocket, and Data Distribution Service
    (DDS). The performance comparison was based on throughput, latency, power consumption,
    bandwidth, reliability, and security. The main challenges that are and will be
    raised by SA applications were also presented in this paper to provide a solid
    basis for realistic implementation options for SA applications. Authors in [29]
    highlighted the importance of IoT and WSN in precision agriculture. The development
    of a low-cost system that monitors, controls, and makes decisions, was presented.
    According to the results, the deployed system showed meaningful improvement in
    the efficiency of resources usage and crops production. Another model of a low-cost,
    effective irrigation system for enhancing cotton production using wireless sensors
    was proposed in [30]. The proposed wireless sensor showed excellent efficiency
    in monitoring the soil water tension, thus implementing an effective irrigation
    scheduling protocol. Authors in [31] deployed small-sized and low-cost WSN nodes
    to improve potato yield by monitoring the field. This study presented a model
    for irrigation management based on mathematical estimations of the agricultural
    parameters. The obtained results ensure better crop yield quality even under stressful
    environmental conditions. Besides, the irrigation system efficiency showed an
    increase that goes up to 10%. In [32], the authors concluded that environmental
    conditions monitoring is crucial to increasing agricultural yield. In this direction,
    a smart system was deployed to monitor soil moisture, temperature, humidity, and
    the movement of animals in the field. The system used Arduino-based sensors. Besides,
    the suggested system deployed an Android mobile application that schedules the
    irrigation, visualizes real-time data, and alerts the farmer in case of any discrepancy.
    The IoT-based SA system farmer-friendly, which is an intelligent system for monitoring
    the concentration of nitrates in groundwater without human intervention, has been
    established in [33]. The proposed approach was based on WSN using Wi-Fi and LoRa
    for data communication. The results demonstrated that the model is ambitious and
    can be adopted by the farmers on large scales. The authors in [34] performed an
    experimental comparison of IoT devices with solar energy harvesting. For the sake
    of the comparison, they used three different communication technologies: Wi-Fi,
    LoRaWan, and ZigBee. The results proved that LoRaWan was the best solution for
    agricultural monitoring when prioritizing network lifetime. The research work
    in [35] defined SA as the application of modern ICT into agriculture. They presented
    the usable IoT hardware and software for smart agriculture and shared interesting
    results. A practical solution for sustainable irrigation in hyper-arid regions
    was proposed in [36]. The suggested solution is based on fuzzy logic combined
    with WSN. According to the results, vast amounts of water and energy were saved
    through effective irrigation scheduling and management processes. For environmental
    sustainability, authors in [37] developed a system that retrieves real-time data
    and uses it to accurately determine the amount of water needed to irrigate the
    garden. The results of this real-world prototype showed savings between 26% and
    34% in water consumption. Still, the results depend on whether the temperature
    sensor is used alone or humidity and soil moisture sensors. Similar to Industry
    4.0 [38], “Agri-Food 4.0” was introduced in [39]. Inspired by the concept of “agriculture
    4.0”, it aims to meet the challenge of enhancing the performance of the agricultural
    supply chain using efficient and effective methods and procedures. The authors
    have conducted a comparative analysis of more than 100 research papers on the
    new technologies and the latest available supply chain approaches. This analysis
    aims to prospect the future of Agri-Food and answer the relevant outstanding questions,
    e.g., how Agri-Food can better support supply chain decision-making? Escamilla-García
    et al. in [40] proposed the use of artificial neural networks (ANNs) in precision
    agriculture. According to the authors, these models can be developed to adapt
    to new technologies such as IoT, Big Data, and Machine Learning (ML) and eventually
    improve the agriculture field. The feedforward architecture is predominant in
    most of the works analyzed in this paper, while the recurrent and hybrid neural
    networks are less used. The benefits and shortcomings of using ANNs in different
    greenhouses applications such as microclimate prediction, control of carbon dioxide,
    and energy expenses are also featured. In [41], the authors proposed Agrinex,
    a modern irrigation mechanism that helps preserve resources by using WSAN. This
    mechanism can be an alternative to the traditional methods used to control agricultural
    irrigation. Agrinex is based on a mesh network consisting of nodes distributed
    in the field and act simultaneously as sensors detecting soil moisture, temperature,
    and humidity. Some nodes of the mesh network act as actuators that control the
    valves of the drip irrigation system. The results show that Agrinex is a promising
    start for many other WSAN applications in the agricultural sector. A GSM-based
    smart irrigation system was presented in [42]. GSM was used to communicate environmental
    data such as the soil moisture, the temperature in the field, the solar power
    data, and the status of the water pumps. Fuzzy Logic control has been exploited
    in this study to take input from sensors (soil moisture, temperature, and humidity)
    and decide on the water pump status as output. This system has several advantages.
    The most important ones are the availability of a mobile application to remotely
    monitor the irrigation system and its ability to switch Off the water pumps when
    expected to rain. Compared to manual flooding, the results showed that this smart
    system proved its efficiency in conserving water and energy. A system that relies
    on solar energy to cope with water and energy shortages was developed in [43].
    This system uses Wi-Fi technology to provide the control unit with data related
    to the soil and the weather in the field where they are deployed to decide whether
    to send a switch On command to the pumps to irrigate the area or not. Besides,
    the designed controller monitors the water level in the well and operates in three
    different modes: manual mode, mobile control mode, and fuzzy logic control mode.
    The developed prototype solely relied on solar energy. Moreover, it successfully
    proved its efficiency in providing the appropriate conditions for the plants without
    wasting water and energy. In [44], Y. P. Lin et. argue that the next step in the
    evolution in Smart Agriculture will consist of blockchain usage. They proposed
    an ICT e-agriculture system using blockchain infrastructure. SECTION IV. System
    Architecture and Design Our proposed system consists of seven main elements, see
    Fig. 7: Data Acquisition: It is a Wireless Sensor Network that senses the environment
    data and sends it to the gateway [45]. Big Data Analytics Platform (BDAP): The
    unit responsible for data storage, visualization, and processing. In addition
    to that, this platform controls the drip irrigation and lighting system within
    the farm. We deployed this component using a Raspberry Pi along with Node-Red.
    The latter is a local server containing a control unit running algorithms to decide
    whether to pump water from groundwater to basin via water pump #1 or from basin
    to the drip irrigation system via water pump # Wireless Actuator Network (WAN):
    It consists of actuators carrying out decisions issued by the BDAP by switching
    On/Off the water pumps and the lighting bulbs. The actuators are wirelessly connected
    to the BDAP [46]. Renewable Energy: These are solar panels that constitute the
    renewable power source for the farm and battery. Storage Unit: The element responsible
    for storing extra electrical energy produced by the solar panels and reusing it
    when needed to operate the water pumps and lighting. It consists of a Lithium
    battery. Control Unit: It decides whether to forward the produced electricity
    to the Smart Farm or store it in the batteries for future use. Cluster Controller:
    It is responsible for collecting and filtering data related to the smart grid
    and sending it to the Cloud-based IoT platform in real-time mode [47]. FIGURE
    7. IoT based smart agriculture: Testbed general architecture. Show All Our proposed
    system is meant to cope with the rapidly growing need for water-table by controlling
    water pumping, overcoming the shortage in electricity by integrating renewable
    energy, and promoting rational usage of water by regulating drip irrigation. The
    following sections shed further light on the main functionalities of our system.
    A. Data Acquisition The data acquisition is composed of wireless sensors and actuators.
    As depicted in Fig. 8, a sensor node is composed of three elements: Sensor modules:
    soil moisture sensor deployed in the field, temperature, and humidity sensor (DHT11)
    which measures the ambient air temperature and humidity, PIR sensor which detects
    the existence of humans by sensing motion, and for the fields’ security reason,
    the fire sensor is used to detect the presence of a flame or fire, the Ultrasonic
    HC-SR04 sensor which measures the water level in the basin, and the AC sensor
    which measures pumps’ power consumption. Microcontroller: an Arduino Nano board
    that connects all the components is used in this study. Communication module:
    It is responsible for transceiving data between sensors and the BDAP. In this
    study Zigbee module (Xbee series 2 S2C) was used. FIGURE 8. Data flow: from sensors
    to the cloud. Show All In anticipation of any power failure in sunlight deficiency,
    all nodes are powered with an IoT solar system (solar panel 20W, solar battery
    charger, and 25Ah battery). This method makes the WSN data acquisition system
    ideal for agriculture as it can be easily deployed everywhere independently of
    the power installation. This energy harvesting system can guarantee up to 5 days
    of total autonomy for each sensor node. B. Sensor Node Configuration The WSN was
    implemented as a mesh topology using a scalable and reliable firmware named Digimesh.
    Each sensor node can act as a sensor and a router in this configuration using
    the Ad-hoc On-demand Distance Vector (AODV) routing protocol [10]. In the current
    study, five wireless sensor nodes were deployed. These send real-time data to
    the BDAP every 15 minutes through the gateway device (sink node) that connects
    the WSN and the BDAP, see Fig. 9. FIGURE 9. Wireless mesh network architecture.
    Show All The wireless actuator nodes we used to control the water pumps are smart
    relays (Sonoff with integrated ESP8266 Wi-Fi Card [48]). These are WiFi-based
    wireless smart switches that operate with a voltage range of 90-250v AC and a
    wireless frequency of 2.4GHz and are compatible with a wide range of appliances.
    We adopted this smart switch as it is cost-effective, reliable, and provides an
    integrated Wi-Fi module. In addition, ensuring communication with the BDAP as
    the Wi-Fi connection might not be available. We enhanced the data acquisition
    and control unit by replacing Sonoff’s smart relay module with a standard relay
    5V connected to an Arduino Nano microcontroller equipped with a GSM/GPRS module
    or a Zigbee module. Fig. 10. shows the wireless sensors used to collect data from
    the field, Fig. 11. shows the wireless sensors used to monitor the water level
    in the basin and the water pump’s energy consumption, and Fig. 12 shows the wireless
    actuator nodes that act on the water pumps to switch them On/Off. FIGURE 10. In-field
    wireless sensor node deployment. Show All FIGURE 11. Basin wireless sensor node
    deployment. Show All FIGURE 12. Wireless smart actuators nodes deployment. Show
    All C. Big Data Analytics Platform Big Data Analytics Platform (BDAP) is the backbone
    of the proposed system. The developed BDAP is based on Node-RED and tested locally
    on a RaspberryPi 3 board running Raspbian OS. Besides, we installed the message
    broker Eclipse-Mosquitto that implements the IoT publish-subscribe messaging protocol
    (MQTT). Following are the main functionalities of our BDAP. 1) Real-Time Data
    Collection and Storage The BDAP receives real-time data from three sources. DigiMesh
    sensors network is distributed in the field to collect and send data to the gateway.
    This data is then forwarded to the BDAP through the USB serial port. Wireless
    sensor/actuator nodes are deployed in groundwater sources and basins. They are
    connected to Wi-Fi using the ESP8266 module, and they communicate with BDAP using
    the MQTT communication protocol. OpenWeatherMap online forecasting portal: it
    provides up to 5 days forecast of temperature, humidity, wind speed, pressure,
    and precipitation. 2) Real-Time Data Visualisation The proposed BDAP contains
    a NodeRED dashboard that displays the acquired data from the different sources
    through a user-friendly graphical user interface (GUI). The main characteristics
    of the GUI are: Visualizing data over short, medium, and long-term periods (daily,
    monthly, and yearly) in charts form. Allowing the user to remotely act on the
    pumps by switching them On/Off via graphical command buttons. Securing data access
    by prompting the user to authenticate through password-secured sessions. Fig.
    13 depicts the interactive real-time control GUI, which displays the real-time
    soil moisture average, temperature average, water level in the basin, irrigation
    duration, rain precipitation, and the state of water pumps (On/Off). The NodeRED
    dashboard was deployed using flowchart programming. FIGURE 13. Real-time control
    interface. Show All 3) Real-Time Irrigation and Water Level Control The control
    flow of the proposed smart irrigation system is presented in Fig. 14. It has two
    primary sequences: 1. Irrigation control (in green), and 2. water level control
    (in blue). FIGURE 14. Deployed system control-flow diagram. Show All a: Real-Time
    Irrigation Control We are adopting fuzzy logic in deploying this component, and
    we dubbed it the Fuzzy Irrigation Control Unit (FICU). The BDAP starts by retrieving
    predicted precipitation data for the next 24 hours from OpenWeatherMap. Depending
    on provided data, two cases are possible: If it is predicted to rain, the FICU
    decides to switch Off the basin waterpump #2 as the rain will likely irrigate
    the field. else, the FICU proceeds as follows: It retrieves the actual soil moisture
    and ambient temperature (Ta) from the wireless sensor nodes and computes their
    average values. The computed average soil moisture is compared to the desired
    one that varies depending on the plant type. In this study, the desired soil moisture
    is set to 60%. The FICU computes a new variable named Soil Moisture Difference
    (SMD). SMD is the difference between the real-time soil moisture average and the
    desired one. If SMD is ≤ 0, FICU uses SMD and Ta to generate the irrigation duration
    (Id) based on the rules mentioned in Table 1. For instance, “If SMD ≪<0 , and
    Ta is Cold, then Id is set to Short”. Then, waterpump #2 is turned On for Id minutes
    to irrigate the field. If SMD >0, the waterpump #2 is turned Off. TABLE 1 Fuzzy
    Rules of Irrigation Duration The use of Ta alongside SMD by FICU is meant to reduce
    water evapotranspiration at high temperatures. FICU comprises four components,
    see Fig. 15: 1. fuzzification module, 2. The Max-Min Inference Engine, 3. The
    Mamdani-type rule base module, and 4. The Centroid defuzzification module. FIGURE
    15. Fuzzy irrigation controller architecture. Show All The inputs and output membership
    functions of the FICU are depicted in Fig. 16. The fuzzification/defuzzification
    of inputs/output is done using trapezoidal and triangular membership functions.
    FIGURE 16. Fuzzy sets memberships functions. Show All Only three membership functions
    were used for each input to improve the program execution speed and avoid the
    memory backlog [36]. However, five membership functions were used for the output
    to cover all variations of Id. b: Real-Time Water Level Control Drip irrigation
    using basins is the most used irrigation method in agriculture. This method has
    several advantages and drawbacks as well. Advantages: Collecting rainwater: by
    collecting rainwater, water table resources are saved, and energy use is reduced.
    Improving water quality: when water is kept in basins, it becomes more oxygenated,
    thus becoming more beneficial for the plants [49]. Drawbacks: Permanent supervision
    cost: This is the sole drawback. Conventional Water Level (WL) control requires
    permanent human supervision, increasing the cost of the products. Our BDAP monitors
    WL in basins based on real-time data provided by a WL sensor to minimize the additional
    cost due to supervision. The blue part in Fig. 14 shows the WL control flowchart.
    Once the field is watered, the BDAP checks the WL value of the basin. If WL <
    50 %, waterpump #1 is turned On. Then, water is pumped from the groundwater source
    to fill the basin to the maximum. Once at maximum, a switch Off command is sent
    to waterpump #1. The whole water irrigation and water level control process is
    regularly repeated (see Fig. 14). We fixed the cycle duration to one hour. The
    solar system used in this study is shown in Fig. 17. It consists of a DC/AC inverter,
    an AC/DC inverter, electrical protection, and a lithium battery. FIGURE 17. Solar
    system real-world deployment. Show All The real-world deployment of the proposed
    SA system is depicted in Fig. 18. The setup consists of solar panels, WSN, IoT
    solar panels with batteries and water pumps. FIGURE 18. Smart agriculture real-world
    deployment. Show All SECTION V. Results & Discussions In order to evaluate our
    system, real-time data was continuously collected remotely via the settled WSN
    over five days in July 2020. Collected data include soil moisture, temperature,
    irrigation duration, water level, solar panels energy production, and the energy
    consumption of waterpump #2. The relevant data variances are depicted in Figures
    19, 20, 21, 22, and 23. FIGURE 19. Real-time temperature and soil moisture averages.
    Show All FIGURE 20. Real-time soil moisture using the traditional irrigation system.
    Show All FIGURE 21. Real-time soil moisture average and irrigation duration. Show
    All FIGURE 22. Real-time water level and groundwater pump state. Show All FIGURE
    23. Real-time PV power production and waterpump #2 energy consumption. Show All
    In Fig. 19, depicting the temperature and soil moisture variances, we notice that
    the day temperature rose to 40 °C, and the nocturnal temperature ranged between
    15 and 20 °C. Unlike conventional irrigation systems (depicted in Fig. 20), the
    soil moisture is optimal and closer to the desired value (60%), and it stays within
    the range of 57%-65%. In conventional irrigation systems, represented in Fig.
    20, the soil moisture varies from 0%-100%. In Fig. 20, we track the real-time
    soil moisture in traditional irrigation systems within five days. This method
    consists of irrigating the field for two consecutive hours daily. The results,
    in Fig. 20, underpin the following drawbacks: The plant is either over or under
    irrigated since the soil moisture varies between those extreme values, and the
    optimal value (60%) is not maintained for an extended period. The quality and
    quantity of the yield would be negatively affected since the soil moisture reaches
    0% for at least five hours each day. High water and energy consumption: in five
    days, 2400L were consumed, which is equivalent to 480L/day for an area of 25m2.
    The last average is used later to evaluate our system compared to conventional
    irrigation in the same region. Our proposed system reacts to weather changes with
    high precision. It raises the soil moisture to 65% during high temperatures (to
    avoid evapotranspiration losses) and does not exceed 62%-63% in low temperatures.
    To study the impact of the irrigation duration on soil moisture, we tracked the
    relevant variances as depicted in Fig. 21. Accordingly, whenever there is a decrease
    in soil moisture, the FICU computes the desired irrigation period to meet the
    desired moisture value and sends a switch On signal to the wireless actuator attached
    to waterpump #2. Accordingly, the higher the temperature is, the longer the irrigation
    duration becomes. When raising the irrigation periods, the evapotranspiration
    losses are reduced, and as a result, the desired soil moisture is continuously
    maintained. Thus, better conditions are provided to the plant, consequently increasing
    the yield’s quality and quantity. Monitoring and controlling the water level in
    the basin is crucial for controlling the drip irrigation system. In this experiment,
    we continuously track the basin water, which varies according to the irrigation
    periods computed by the FICU. For instance, as shown in Fig. 22, when the water
    level exceeds the set threshold (50% in our case), waterpump #1 is turned Off;
    otherwise, waterpump #1 is switched On until the basin is reached entirely complete.
    Thus, the obtained results are consistent with the water level control previously
    presented in section IV. We used a water pump with a water flow rate of 240 L/hour
    in our experiment. Within five days, the total Id was 169 minutes, and 676 L were
    consumed during this time. This rate is equivalent to 135.2 L/day consumed over
    the same area of 25 m2. Accordingly, our proposed smart agriculture system provides
    the field with an average of 54 m3/hectare per day. This water consumption is
    3.55 times lower than in the traditional irrigation system, and thus the energy
    consumption as well since used pumps are electrical ones. Therefore, we conclude
    that the traditional irrigation system is ineffective in maintaining soil moisture
    at the desired value. In addition, it is wasting water and energy resources. The
    real-time energy consumption of waterpump #2 measured by AC sensor and the real-time
    solar panels’ energy production measured by a smart energy meter within five days
    are presented in Fig. 23. We notice from this figure that the maximum energy consumption
    and maximum solar energy production are reached simultaneously (between 12:00
    pm and 4:00 pm). From this figure, we also conclude that the integration of solar
    energy is suitable for smart agriculture without implementing an extensive storage
    system(batteries). In the design of our SA prototype, the cost has been reduced
    to the minimum possible to make it affordable and widely adopted even by small
    and medium farmers. The unit price for every single component is presented in
    Table 2. TABLE 2 Unit Price of the Different Components The total cost of designing
    our SA Prototype with a RaspberryPi, five wireless sensor nodes, 5 IoT solar panels
    and batteries, two smart relays, and a Zigbee gateway is $ 609, which is much
    cheaper than other existing solutions in the market. The proposed SA system is
    an up-and-coming solution for many reasons: Better quantity and quality production.
    Less energy and water consumption. Cost-effectiveness. Open-source. Eco-friendly.
    Easy monitoring (less effort). Designed to promote scalability. SECTION VI. Conclusion
    This paper developed, presented, and deployed an open-source and easy-to-deploy
    smart agriculture system with the main drivers of cost-effectiveness, water consumption
    optimization, and renewable energy integration. The deployed SA system leverages
    up-to-date ICT. We used IoT devices for data acquisition and control (sensors
    and actuators). We also used Cloud Computing for data processing, visualization,
    and data storage. Besides, we recurred to fuzzy logic to implement a fuzzy irrigation
    control unit that decides on the appropriate Id (Irrigation Duration) based on
    real-time processed data. This approach saves water and energy and provides adequate
    conditions for the plants, thus optimizing crops’ yield. Furthermore, this allows
    better monitoring for the water level in the basin and adheres to the conventional
    eco-friendly trend of sustainable agriculture through its total reliance on solar
    energy. The case study results show that our proposed solution is promising compared
    to the traditional irrigation system due to its cost-effectiveness and ability
    to reduce water/energy consumption by 71.8%. As future work, we are paving the
    way towards scaling up our system by deploying our solution in several farms in
    the region, allowing our BDAP (Big Data Analytics Platform) to collect big real-time
    data about water-table usage in the region. Thus appropriate irrigation strategies
    can be derived and analyzed. Besides, we plan further experimentation to enhance
    solar energy production and storage. We will also integrate LoRa wireless sensors/actuators
    network and develop a machine learning system that predicts soil moisture, energy
    production, and energy consumption within a few days. The machine learning algorithm
    can adapt to different crop requirements in moisture levels and improve crop yield.

    is one of the sustainable forms of smart agricultural farming. It is considered
    as an alternate method to overcome the food crisis which is generated due to high
    population growth, climate change, and environmental pollution. Although this
    method supports off-the-season crops within the enclosed area even in severe climatic
    zones. It has required to efficiently control and manage the crop parameters at
    a greenhouse in a more precise and secure way. The advancement of the Internet
    of Things (IoT) has introduced smart solutions to automate the greenhouse farming

    control. The survey presents a hierarchy on the major components of IoT-based
    greenhouse farming. A rigorous discussion on greenhouse farming techniques, IoT-based
    greenhouse categories, network technologies (cloud/edge computing, IoT protocols,
    data analytics, sensors) has been presented. Furthermore, a detailed discussion
    on mobile-based greenhouse applications and IoT applications has been presented
    to manage the greenhouse farm. Moreover, the success stories and statistical analysis
    of some agricultural countries have been presented to standardize IoT-based greenhouse
    farming. Lastly, the open issues and research challenges related to IoT-enabled

    The continuous growth of world population, environmental change, industrialization,
    the arable land over the globe is decreasing every year [1]. Therefore, the demand
    and requirement for hygienic food and crop yield have been growing continuously.
    A survey conducted by the United Nations of Food and Agriculture Organization
    (FAO) estimated that the population of the world is expected to reach 9.73 billion
    in 2050 [2]. It is expected that more cropland and water will need to meet the
    future food demands globally. Furthermore, other challenges such as abrupt changes
    in climate, lack of labor, and water scarcity spiral the pressure on agriculturists
    and farmers [3]. The challenges faced by traditional agriculture and greenhouse
    farming need a fundamental change to develop sustainable and ecological food.
    Greenhouse farming is one of the best alternatives to overcome the food crisis
    as well as to ensure the sustainability of socio-ecological. Initially, the greenhouse
    farming method was introduced in France and Netherland 19th century [5]. At present,
    greenhouses have become one of the ideal farming methods in the agriculture world
    [6]. The greenhouse is a structure like a house that is covered with a plastic
    material or glass mainly designed to cultivate multiple crops in any season. In
    order to increase the quantity and quality of food, a greenhouse can regulate
    the growing patterns of plants accordingly. Traditional greenhouses are specifically
    designed with dry lands and ignore the multiple environmental variables such as
    temperature, humidity, among others [7]. Usually, a smart and productive greenhouse
    requires environmental monitoring and control devices, to manage various weather
    parameters [8]. In the conventional greenhouses, climatic variables and other
    growing methods were depending upon the cultivators’ assessment and demand for
    the number of growers [9]. In the last few years, the smart farming concept has
    attracted the broad attention of farmers, agriculturists, and researchers. Smart
    greenhouse farming is an enclosed cultivation process that manages the farm by
    using information and communication technology (ICT) to enhance the quality and
    quantity of crops with minimal human involvement [10], [11]. The emerging IoT
    technology provides a high potential for innovative methods and smart solution
    development which can transform the agriculture sector in all aspects. Thus, integrating
    the IoT with a greenhouse to convert it into a smart and automated greenhouse
    is considered to be one of the foremost and ideal solutions. Thus, IoT-enabled
    greenhouses can mitigate these challenges as well as assist growers to enhance
    the productivity of food and crops [12]. Figure 1 shows the IoT-enabled greenhouse
    farming trends. The deployment of a wireless sensor network (WSN) enables climatic
    data to be gathered and distributed for understanding and monitoring the internal
    system of the greenhouse, but there is a need to handle several other features
    which can cause significant destruction to the grown plants, such as, less or
    high-water supply, bad weather conditions, and light intensity. The eradication
    of these issues can be done through a precise system that helps to automate the
    monitoring and control methods for a smart greenhouse [15], [16]. FIGURE 1. IoT
    based greenhouse farming trends. Show All Current research developments demonstrate
    that how researchers are exploring and utilizing the IoT technologies in greenhouses
    for different farming practices. As a result, there are several prototypes, applications,
    and services in IoT-based greenhouse farms. In a smart greenhouse, the research
    trends consist of network architectures, new applications, interoperability, and
    security challenges. Therefore, it is expected that a state-of-the-art understanding
    of current research on IoT-based greenhouse farming is highly informative and
    valuable for agriculturists, farmers, stakeholders, and researchers. Although
    a huge amount of research has been accomplished in the area of IoT-based greenhouse
    farming, still there is a need for detailed study in this area to understand the
    current research status. The motivation of the survey is to investigate the IoT-enabled
    greenhouse research trends and various open issues that are vital to transforming
    greenhouse farming technologies through IoT modernization. The modification of
    greenhouse techniques on the basis of IoT advancement is explained in this paper
    by analyzing several approaches, communication protocols, network technologies,
    applications, challenges, and industry trends in smart-greenhouse farming. The
    structural flow of this paper is presented in Figure 2 which contains the following
    sections: Major components of IoT-based greenhouse are presented in section II.
    In section III, a brief discussion is given on technology-based cultivation techniques
    related to greenhouse farming. IoT-based greenhouse farming categories are discussed
    in section IV. Section V presents IoT-based greenhouse farming technologies which
    consist of edge/cloud computing, big data analytics, IoT communication protocols,
    IoT sensors/devices. Mobile applications and IoT applications for a smart greenhouse
    are discussed in section VI. The major problems and challenges regarding greenhouse
    farming with future research direction have been explained in section VII. Top
    technology firm’s trends have been discussed in section VIII that provides detail
    on how technology industries are investing in this area. IoT-based smart farming
    success stories and statistical analysis made by different countries to boost
    greenhouse farming are presented in section IX The survey is concluded in section
    X. FIGURE 2. Structural flow of the paper. Show All SECTION II. Key Components
    of IoT-Enabled Greenhouse The smart-greenhouse structure has been shown in Figure
    3. The structural design is based on three key components which are used to accomplish
    several tasks. The first component named physical structure is divided into three
    sub-components namely actuators, sensors, micro-controller. Sensors act as a prominent
    part to accumulate information regarding internal climatic situations using light
    sensors, humidity/temperature sensors, gas sensors, soil-moisture sensors. These
    sensory devices transfer the gathered data to a micro-controller for taking a
    decision accordingly by interacting with the user remotely by using the internet.
    Actuators consist of a nutrient tank, water pump, lights, and windows for greenhouse
    farming. They are used to implement the command given by the user. FIGURE 3. Major
    components of IoT-enabled greenhouse. Show All Monitoring is the second major
    component of smart greenhouse farming that consists of plant, soil, and climate
    monitoring. In climate monitoring, the appropriate observation is done by the
    devices to balance the environment that is mandatory for the certain crop which
    is cultivated within the greenhouse. In case, climatic factors like temperature,
    CO2 level, humidity, air pressure are not matching to the limit defined by the
    user, at that time micro-controller is informed to trigger the devices for balancing
    the internal environment. In soil monitoring, all the essential ingredients like
    phosphorus, potassium are examined by the sensors. Besides this, the level of
    soil wetness and soil salinity is also observed for avoiding damage to the grown
    plants. Plant monitoring contains observation of crop diseases and leaf temperature
    to recognize the behavior of the plant growth so that users can be able to get
    information about the health of plants. This data can be evaluated for further
    cultivation practices in greenhouse farming. IoT data acquisition contains two
    sub-components i.e. standard data acquisition and IoT-based data acquisition.
    Standard type includes communication protocols, for instance, SIGFOX, Low Range
    Wide Area Network (LoraWAN) Wi-Fi, ZigBee for remote and small range communication
    purposes. They are managed according to the required conditions. IoT-based data
    acquisition holds three major protocols which are MQTT, HTTP, and CoAP. These
    protocols are used for long-range communication. Further, IoT-based data acquisition
    is used to maintain the conditions within the greenhouse to surge the production
    rate of quality crops efficiently. SECTION III. Technology Based Cultivation Techniques
    of Greenhouse The productivity and efficiency of a greenhouse farm are widely
    depending upon the growing structure of the crop. Although there exist multiple
    structures to select from, but it is more important to have deep knowledge about
    the challenges and benefits of each greenhouse farming method. In this section,
    three technology-based cultivation techniques namely; less, average, and highly
    developed greenhouse are discussed. A. Less Developed Greenhouse (LDG) LDG is
    a permanent greenhouse farming technique that is suitable for flowers and vegetables
    not applicable in hot regions because they do not have ventilation techniques.
    Additionally, the wooden stuff is commonly available, so it is easy and affordable
    to construct a greenhouse by the agriculturists who do not have sufficient budget
    to build advanced technology-enabled greenhouses. However, the structure has poor
    environmental control and fewer investment charges. Moreover, farmers can also
    attach multiple units of the greenhouse to generate a larger one [17]. B. Average
    Developed Greenhouse (ADG) Greenhouse based on Average technology has more flexibility
    as compared to LDG. The structural design is generally constructed by polythene
    or glass sheet with a well-organized environmental control mechanism. The ventilation
    method in this technique can be static or moveable for permitting the air to blow
    within the greenhouse which makes it capable to manageable in hot regions as well.
    For these partial automatic procedures, the cost ranges from 30 to 100 $ /m^2
    in which vegetables, as well as high-quality plants, can be cultivated [11]. These
    greenhouses are applicable for quality production with the cheapest cost and consume
    less power as compared to highly-developed greenhouses [18], [19]. C. Highly Developed
    Greenhouse (HDG) A type of greenhouses that minimizes the labor expenditure by
    automating the tasks. The methodology has an extra maintenance cost that is more
    than 100 $ /m^2, due to which, it is not certainly affordable for farmers. HDG
    has a glass/iron structure in which the internal weather is entirely independent
    of the external atmosphere. The climate can be set accordingly by monitoring climatic
    factors like temperature, CO2 level, and humidity. The use of this type of greenhouse
    is suggested in cold-winter areas to develop nursery production [17]. To surge
    the quality and yielding rate of crops, this eco-friendly technique is efficient
    for use [18]. SECTION IV. IoT-Based Greenhouse Categories Nowadays, devices based
    on IoT are used at a large scale in the monitoring and controlling systems of
    several sectors. The IoT-based technologies consist of different kinds of actuators,
    sensors, drones, cloud computing, analytical system, and navigation which make
    efficient decisions to surge crop production with less human involvement [20],
    [21]. The usage of these sensors and devices is to observe the atmosphere and
    collect information like temperature, humidity, the intensity of light, and soil
    moistness. The collected information related to the environment is stored on the
    cloud computing server that can be analyzed and visualized by the user at any
    location using the internet [22], [23]. This section presents the greenhouse technologies
    based on IoT particularly three techniques named; Smart-Greenhouse, Hydroponics,
    and Vertical-farm. A. Smart-Greenhouse Greenhouse can be defined as an agricultural
    modernization for providing a controlled and organized atmosphere to plants. A
    packed loop is formed in the greenhouse and plants are protected from the external
    climate. A safe situation is produced for growing crops and it shows a high significance
    in the varying climatic circumstances. Hence, greenhouse acts as a great illustration
    of precision farming. Greenhouse’s efforts are based on the conception of the
    “greenhouse effect”. Light enters into the greenhouse via walls/roof and is trapped
    within the greenhouse because of sealing arrangements. Today’s greenhouses are
    furnished with smart technologies such as cameras, lights, Arduino/Raspberry Pi,
    and wireless sensors to offer automatic controllers for the intensity of light,
    temperature, soil moistness, and the level of humidity for maintaining the necessary
    atmospheric condition which is necessary for the plant growth. WSN is used to
    assist in monitoring and controlling these devices and create an optimized climate
    for crops [24], [25]. For example, soil sensors assist to gather facts on the
    flows of water by the land to track fluctuations in soil wetness, temperature,
    and nitrogen/carbon levels. This process lets the growers to optimize, observe,
    and regulate the cultivation of sensitive crops, to maximize their crop yield
    while maintaining its quality for the end product. They are able to sense data
    such as moisture, light strength, and value of temperature to alter the sequence
    of irrigation for avoiding the chances of damage. A greenhouse climate monitoring
    system is shown in Figure 4. Irrigation plays a vital role in a good production
    rate to guarantee that agriculturalists would be able to meet the water load for
    the crop. However, poor planning for irrigation and ineffective usage of water
    resources are limiting crop production in several agricultural areas. Through
    a traditional irrigation method, soil moisture faces great variations in its concentration.
    Sometimes, the soil is completely dried, and then irrigating it with a high volume
    of water creates a vertical surge in the value of soil moisture. These thrilling
    alterations are not beneficial for crops, because they need moistness in the soil
    to keep themselves at a moderate limit. Additionally, dry soil consumes a high-water
    quantity for irrigation because it cannot keep the water just like slightly moist
    soil [26]. Irrigation procedures are commonly automated using computer control,
    timers, and specialized controllers. In an open-loop irrigation system, the output
    measurements are not implemented to alter the inputs, this irrigation is based
    on predetermined time intervals, for example, time-clock scheduling. FIGURE 4.
    Smart-greenhouse. Show All An enclosed-loop controlling method is used in the
    irrigation based on feedback, in which the system offers growers real-time output
    data to reschedule irrigation, for example, drainage percentage and plant water
    position. In a feed-forward irrigation system, water usage is estimated through
    transpiration and growth models [27]. Another method of irrigation is through
    an overhead crane that is linked with a pipe, in which green manure/water is shifted
    to a crane for crops. Crane moves vertically/horizontally to deliver the stuff
    in plants [28]. Moreover, maintaining suitable humidity and temperature inside
    a greenhouse climate is crucial. Temperature altering can damage crops within
    a few hours, this decline in productivity. Thus, the environment is a vital parameter
    for plant growth [29]. When humidity surges, it causes more chances for crop diseases.
    Further, the dew condensation arises in the greenhouse at the time when the temperature
    of a dew point is greater than the crop’s temperature, and its relation is deep
    with relative humidity [30]. A pack of sensor nodes is used to sense the temperature
    and humidity within the greenhouse. The hygrometer sensor monitors the humidity
    and pyroelectric film is used to monitor the temperature. The modification gathered
    by both sensors is transferred to a mutual analog/digital signal converter (ADC)
    system which alters these analog signals of information into a digital signal
    for ease of understanding and decoding through server [31], [32]. Another parameter
    naming as light intensity is also important to monitor for healthy plant growth.
    The light sensor’s output voltage modification depends upon the intensity of light.
    The increasing intensity identifies high voltage in the result and when the intensity
    becomes low, then the resulting voltage drops [25]. Figure 5 shows that once the
    sensors create the context information, it is then sent towards a gateway or micro-controller
    that is used for integrating all the deployed devices at a single platform [33],
    [34]. FIGURE 5. Environment monitoring in greenhouse. Show All Micro-controllers
    are assumed as the heart for a greenhouse system in which several actuators and
    sensors are interconnected to construct a precise automated system [29]. The connectivity
    of Wi-Fi within the Cloud facilitates data transmission towards the cloud by using
    a microcontroller and then kept in the database based on the cloud. The material
    saved within the cloud is repeatedly conveyed to the user’s mobile through the
    internet for initiating a distant checking so the user can be able to alter the
    threshold for the greenhouse climate. This enables the “human towards machine”
    communication and offers a “machine towards machine” collaboration. The drivers
    of the motor circuit connected with sliding windows and coolers are fixed to help
    the motor for regulating the movement of air inside the greenhouse. Depending
    on the threshold fixed for the humidity, temperature, light, and moisture, the
    micro-controller activates the driver circuit for regulating the airflow and stabling
    the temperature [25]. In case, there is dryness inside the greenhouse, the water
    sprayer is triggered for increasing the level of humidity. The sprayer can be
    switched off. Moreover, if the humidity surged inside the greenhouse farm, then
    a rooftop is opened for lowering the humidity level [31]. 1) Benefits of Smart
    Greenhouse The platform of the IoT offers an automated greenhouse environment
    that enables a significant association among tangible things and people. A user
    is allowed to gather real-time data processing, analysis, and meditation. The
    system is deployed to offer automation for monitoring as well as controlling.
    The deployed system collects and transfers the sensed information via the IoT
    cloud for easy access from anywhere and at any time. Thus, IoT enabled greenhouse
    farming to enhance productivity and decrease labor costs. A farmer can grow multiple
    crops in the appropriate season with less human effort as shown in Figure 6. The
    efficient use of water and proper soil monitoring results in high crop production.
    FIGURE 6. Benefits of smart-greenhouse. Show All B. Hydroponics Greenhouse Hydroponic-Greenhouse
    system is a cultivation technique using water instead of soil. It shows that soil
    is not vital for plant cultivation, only the vital minerals, nutrients, and adequate
    pH are required within a specified range inside the water [35]. This system is
    a highly productive and fast process as compared to a plantation in soil. Moreover,
    vegetables are cultivated via the hydroponics process. Hydroponics farming has
    a short harvest time and is usually rounded up for minimizing costs [36]. Hydroponic
    farming required precise control of climate parameters for high-quality production.
    The most important parameters are humidity, light intensity, pH, temperature,
    and electrical conductivity. These parameters can be monitored through any sensing
    and monitoring devices. Sensing/monitoring devices are controlled by a micro-controller
    known as Raspberry Pi [37]. The micro-controller is managed by connecting to the
    Wi-Fi module, which transfers all sensing devices’ information related to hydroponics
    to cloud storage. A typical hydroponic structure is shown in Figure 7 which contains
    the hydroponic water pressure pump, pipes, nutrient container, artificial lights,
    water tank, and adjustment of PH solutions. The sensors related to Electrical
    Conductivity (EC) are standardized using low, high, and dry EC adjustment by using
    solutions having dissimilar EC levels. PH and EC are significant aspects to maintain
    the healthy growth of the crop and plants. In the hydroponic method, the concentration
    of EC can be increased by following the instruction mentioned in the solution
    container. The primary objective of the pH controller is to investigate and identify
    the existence of bicarbonates or carbonates within the nutrient solution by which
    pH values can be determined. The pH levels of bicarbonate-ion (HCO3) are altered
    from 4.5 to 8.3 and the nutrient solutions which are containing carbonate-ion
    (CO3) surge levels of its pH beyond 8.3. Hence, the solubility of salts having
    calcium-carbonate is reduced. Once the precipitation process has been done, it
    is challenging to re-establish the value of the solution’s PH. The greatest way
    to avoid this problematic situation is taking out constant usage of marketable
    acids which deactivate and also finish the bi-carbonates created within the solution.
    Acid’s amount that requires to be combined with nutrient’s mixture relies on the
    used water and bicarbonates in the nutrient combination. Additionally, acid would
    lead the pH level to that value where it can be dangerous for crops [35], [38].
    The PH and EC controlling methods enable farmers to efficiently manage nutrients
    in solutions that can be reused by rapidly detecting instability that arises in
    the nutrient [39]. The liquid flow within the hydroponic method is also necessary
    to control, for example, there are chances that the crop size can be small or
    it would die in case the system delivers a slight hydroponic liquid. In another
    case, if supply goes beyond the required limit, it may return abnormally-shaped
    crops. Hence, system function and system supply should be controlled. FIGURE 7.
    Hydroponics greenhouse. Show All The quantity of hydroponic fluid supply can be
    determined through evapotranspiration, which is measured by Relative-Light-Intensity
    (RLI) and Vapor Pressure Deficit (VPD). In Evapotranspiration, process water is
    wasted through the leaves of plants. The use of relative humidity and temperature
    enables the calculation of VPD. RLI means the ratio of light quantity which is
    dispersed at the upper and bottom sides of the crop. The deployed sensor nodes
    within the hydroponic structure gather greenhouse environment information on the
    crop’s conditions. The accumulated data is then transferred towards the sensor’s
    gateway via the sink node that collects the important information from all the
    nodes shown in Figure 8. The data is authenticated by sensor gateway and shifted
    to the actuator controlling system and cloud storage. Lastly, the actuators are
    driven by the system and supply the required amount of hydroponic fluid that is
    mentioned in the received information. The system also permits the user to visualize
    the collected information and put control information by staying anywhere using
    a web browser. Hence, the ease of use can be enhanced by arranging both data and
    information of the actuation process on a cloud-based server. If the Internet
    failure occurs, the control signals will be unable to reach the controlling program,
    then the actuators will not be controlled by the system. Moreover, when entire
    data is stored only on cloud then data can be lost or unavailable whenever the
    Internet would not be available. Therefore, it is vital to prevent data loss even
    in case of failure in uplink/downlink to attain effective climatic control by
    keeping data storage as a backup through the local network [40]. FIGURE 8. Hydroponics
    functional platform. Show All 1) Benefits of Hydroponics Greenhouse Unnecessary
    pesticides are not required for the soil in this method. The water need is fewer
    as compared to traditional greenhouse farming. The plant production is not affected
    due to any external change in the environment. 2) Issues of Hydroponics Greenhouse
    The need for manual checking to deliver the essential nutrients is extensive [21].
    Scalability issue arises due to heavy starting investment for structure. The system
    that is normally used for communication within hydroponic farms is inappropriate
    for remote communication [41]. C. Vertical-Farming The concept of food supply
    in cities has already existed, but the awareness of a whole building occupied
    by crops is an emerging idea. In vertical farming several crops are cultivated
    inside an enclosed region, that is structured like an elevated style to accommodate
    plants [42]. The vertical farming concept is presented in Figure 9. Generally,
    the structure of vertical farms is designed to cultivate plants in the high-tech
    buildings that normally reside in the middle of a city. The vertical farm act
    as a type of advanced agricultural system which is completely surrounded by a
    controlled climate and used to eliminate the external factors related to the environment.
    There is no need for a wide land area for the installation of vertical farming.
    The system can be set within any building which has raised a global environment
    without considering the current environment as the winter or rainy season [43],
    [44]. FIGURE 9. Vertical farm. Show All The information of environmental conditions
    is crucial to monitor and control through an appropriate device. These factors
    are helpful to define the working for the devices and their facilities as well.
    Environmental parameters contain both the outdoor and indoor climate conditions.
    The everyday atmospheric situations like climate limitations require to be processed
    and manipulated. The seasonal factors and regular climate differences are necessary
    to consider for more precise developing conditions. In an indoor system, the environmental
    situations and the conditions related to soil are given important concern. Figure
    10 shows the conceptual design of a smart greenhouse. Several devices, for instance,
    actuators, sensors, and controlling tools are installed inside the vertical farm
    to observe and control the services. Sensors are linked directly to the climate
    parameters, through which collected data is transmitted to the server by IoT protocol.
    Moreover, the link of actuators to the parameters is indirect. Actuators regulate
    the control devices such as a heater, humidifier, air-conditioner, sliding window,
    and lights. The variation outcomes of environmental conditions force the actuation
    process to reset the required standard condition by regulating the devices [45].
    The simulation of sunlight within the vertical farm is with the usage of LED lights
    which enables the crop for carrying out the process of photosynthesis. Hence,
    light monitoring is necessary to give optimal photonic energy to achieve proper
    photosynthesis. FIGURE 10. Conceptual design of Greenhouse farming. Show All Thus,
    for this purpose, the light sensor is used in the system. Humidity and Temperature
    are also vital for the good health of the crops in an enclosed environment. This
    makes the need for the deployment of sensors related to temperature and humidity.
    Window sliding is used to control these factors. Finally, a continuous process
    is required to monitor the moisture content of the soil, and enable a burglar
    alarm to measure the fall of required moisture level [46]. A sensor for soil moisture
    assists to identify the humidity. If the reading shows a humidity level lower
    than the fixed threshold, it indicates that the soil has a low amount of water.
    Thus, the valve is opened for watering the affected soil within the vertical farm.
    In case, the level of reading is higher, it shows that the soil contains an extra
    amount of water. To avoid an excessive amount of water the valve stops the flow
    of water on the farm [43]. The sensed information by the sensor is transmitted
    towards the cloud server by using IoT protocol. The detected data is stored within
    the database and the control actions are performed for maintaining the optimal
    situation in the environment [47]. 1) Benefits of Vertical Farming Vertical farming
    acts as a climate-controlled farming method. In this farming method, the occurrence
    of seasonality issues is very less because crop production is continuous for all-year.
    The system provides organic food that is healthy and uncontaminated. Moreover,
    its enhanced productivity improves income and it is useful for lowering energy
    and food costs as well. 2) Challenges of Vertical Farming Start-up costs for the
    vertical farm can be high if the farming area is obtained within commercial districts.
    In this system, the farming procedure cannot be as wide as compared to rural areas.
    Furthermore, yielding capacities don’t increase as in a wide region farming as
    well as leads towards increasing complexity and cost. SECTION V. IoT-Based Greenhouse
    Network Technologies The digital gap between IoT technologies and agricultural
    producers has been reduced. Productivity will be improved by using IoT technologies
    through sustainable food cultivation. Smart agriculture (i.e. IoT-based Greenhouse)
    contains actions such as automated irrigation, automated environment controlling
    mechanism, remote monitoring, fertilization, and frost protection. These control
    activities are assisted through the integration of IoT technologies with other
    technologies i.e. cloud computing, hardware, integration platforms, operating
    systems, and monitoring/controlling processes [48]. A. IoT-Enabled Greenhouse
    Network Architecture The smart greenhouse has been coined after describing smart
    farming notions such as sensors, communications technologies, and variable rate
    technology for plants growth and crop management. An IoT-based greenhouse network
    architecture has been presented in figure 11 in order to obtain precision greenhouse
    farming. The architecture contains multiple components in order to interact, analyze,
    and predict the farming data through end-user applications. Sensor technology
    is deployed for data acquisition purposes. However, the data collected through
    deployed sensors is transmitted towards the gateway for analysis and mining purpose.
    IoT communication standards such as Zigbee, COAP, MQTT, WIFI, Bluetooth, etc.
    support all interactions in the network architecture. These communication standards
    are widely used for precision greenhouse farming where IoT devices and sensors
    can collaborate and interoperate with any underline communication. FIGURE 11.
    IoT-based greenhouse network architecture. Show All B. Edge & Cloud Technology
    Cloud computing states a cloud of resources on the internet that is either in
    a centralized or distributed form. Clouds are built with physical or virtualized
    resources over large centralized or distributed data centers. Smart monitoring
    methods mainly pay heed to monitor and controlling plant growth in the greenhouse
    [49]. The participation of IoT-agriculture and cloud computing helps the process
    of monitoring to become faster, easier to maintain, easily understandable, and
    precisely solve the problems of greenhouse farming [49], [50]. The use of cloud-based
    design allows the information to be collected by the sensors and analyzed by comparing
    with given constraints. Then the server will be able to make a decision that is
    distributed to the subscribed users. In this way, if a disturbance occurs, a notification
    must be transmitted to the user through mobile [49], [51]. Moreover, edge computing
    acts as a backbone for cloud computing and plays an important role within the
    greenhouse to control and monitor the internal environmental conditions. Key control
    actions of a greenhouse are arranged through a layer at the edge which consists
    of other controlling segments for climate, nutrition, irrigation, and supplementary
    tasks. The ‘Network-Function-Virtualization’ (NFV) is used to power them, hence
    they are instantiated at dissimilar nodes alongside the network path that is from
    crop to cloud [52]. The cloud-based greenhouse farming structure is shown in Figure
    12 which is using four different layers named Cloud Storage, Fog/edge Computing,
    Gateway, and hardware segment. The cloud storage component delivers the resources
    on request by centralizing the greenhouse environmental information. Gateways
    are used to play a significant role in data distribution for those devices which
    have no design capability to share information directly by using the internet.
    FIGURE 12. Cloud-based greenhouse network structure. Show All Fog/edge computing
    is helpful to integrate all the resources for the distributed components. The
    resource’s scalability is surged by decreasing the computational burden at the
    cloud. Lastly, the hardware segment contains multiple sensors, actuators, microcontrollers
    (Arduino or Raspberry PI), and a central processing unit (CPU) which are used
    to measure several greenhouse farming variables. Fast communication can be achieved
    in a smart greenhouse by using IoT communication protocols such as MQQT, COAP
    as Representational State Transfer (REST), and MQTT. C. Big-Data Analytics-Based
    Greenhouse Farming Big data means a large amount of data like business data, sensor
    data, and public networking data is collected in several ways for a long duration.
    The significant challenge is to get, analyze, store and search. Processing of
    business data is done using a big-data technique to find secret patterns within
    the information. In the agriculture domain, it is useable for supporting the management
    chain of agriculture products, to reduce the cost of production [53], [54]. The
    big data analytics model contains several modules which are shown in Figure 13.
    The prediction model acts as an optimization segment that is useable to guess
    parametric standards that are not accomplished by the sensors, for example, photosynthesis.
    The prediction has been given based on parameters that are already available.
    Artificial neural networks are useable as a tool for the implementation of predictive
    modeling which can be helpful in constructing a proactive model for greenhouse
    farming. FIGURE 13. Big data analysis based greenhouse mode. Show All All these
    models are used to estimate the values of general parameters, for instance; humidity
    and temperature by analyzing them with previously collected data to lessen sampling
    load and execute proactively [24] The farmer or user experience component assists
    the greenhouse owners to observe crop growth, climate situations, and soil capability.
    The multiform analysis explains the various greenhouse farming techniques to reduce
    the destruction risk of plants by using scientific ways. The sensing/Monitoring
    unit is used to collect and analyze the internal greenhouse farming parameters
    by means of multiple monitoring and sensing devices. This precise data is delivered
    to the farmers or farm managers for keeping them updated about crop growth. To
    achieve long/short-range communication, several protocols like LoRaWAN, WIFI and
    ZigBee are used in greenhouse farming. Farmers keep information regarding crop
    health for making improved analyses in the future. In the physical implementations
    module, some hardware devices like micro-controller (Arduino or Raspberry Pi),
    routers, sensors, gateways, and actuation devices are deployed to observe the
    greenhouse environment. D. Data Trasmission Protocols Smart greenhouses demand
    great struggle for data acquisition systems like wired connection and distribution
    of sensors which is expensive and complex. Moreover, some crops need modification
    of point’s location with time which is easily possible by the wireless-sensor
    network due to its mobility and simple implementation. A WSN consists of multiple
    nodes which are distributed within the greenhouse to find the plant growth by
    gathering information via communication protocols shown in Table 1. These protocols
    gather, encapsulate, and transfer greenhouse farm information. Similarly, WSNs
    are cheaper as well as have fewer energy-consumption methods and let the networks
    connect and provide flexibility in information sharing [55], [56]. Some data communication
    and transmission protocols are discussed in this section which is playing a vital
    role in greenhouse farming. TABLE 1 Comparison of IoT Transmission Protocol 1)
    IEEE 802.11 WiFi The IEEE 802.11 is a well-organized wireless local-area-network
    protocol due to its capability of taking heavy information like audio/video file
    transmission [56]. It is based on IEEE 802.11 b, IEEE 802.11 ac, IEEE 802.11 a,
    IEEE 802.11 g, and IEEE 802.11 n. Although it is a much expensive, short-range,
    and power-hungry communication standard it is useful for sensor networks in a
    greenhouse with distinct benefits. Portable devices which are used in greenhouse
    farming, contain this protocol broadly. In addition, it provides the facility
    to carry high agricultural information. This communication standard is highly
    effective for monitoring irrigation in the greenhouse by wireless cameras and
    drones [57]. 2) LoRaWAN A communication protocol that is organized by the LoRa-Alliance
    to connect IoT devices wirelessly for long-range bidirectional communication in
    greenhouse farms. This protocol has slight maintenance with less energy consumption
    that makes it capable of dealing with several types of sensors [58], [59]. 3)
    RFID The structural design of Radio-Frequency Identification (RFID) uses radio
    waves for keeping the gathered data safe and secure on a machine. RFID method
    includes tags (active and passive), readers, and hosts. The tags consist of an
    ID number of greenhouse atmospheric objects. The ID number is attached to the
    object which can be identified by the reader to read data and then transferred
    to the end host. An active tag has more energy consumption value and is expensive
    as compared to another one. The host acts as a processing portion of the RFID
    method [60]. 4) MQTT A bidirectional, publish/subscribe and asynchronous protocol
    named as Message-queuing-telemetry protocol was designed by IBM in favor of machine-to-machine
    (M2M) communication to offer flexibility, less bandwidth usage, and computational
    resources [61]. Singh et al. [62] have been developed an IoT-enabled greenhouse
    monitoring system by using the MQTT protocol which monitors and controls the climatic
    parameters within a greenhouse to provide efficient growth of the crop. Through
    MQTT, an irrigation method with less cost has been analyzed to collect and transmit
    sensed data [63]. 5) SIGFOX A SIGFOX is a long-range, low data-rate protocol that
    is used to transfer collected information by global positioning system (GPS) to
    a central server by consuming less power [64], [65]. SIGFOX uses a two-tier topology
    like LoRaWAN, where its gateways transfer the traffic flow towards cloud servers.
    The robustness of network transmission in the greenhouse can improve by repeating
    the message several times over dissimilar frequency channels [66]. 6) WiMAX A
    protocol that offers 100 MB/s to 1 GB/s for mobile or fixed stations respectively
    [47]. Greenhouse farming can get portable/fixed communication by using a multi-access
    connection through WiMax using wireless/wired media. In Ghana, this technology
    has been implemented to empower the end-users to attach using WiMax networks [67].
    7) Bluetooth A low-cost, short-range, and low-power communication protocol named
    Bluetooth (IEEE 802.15.1) was designed for personal area networks (PAN) to communicate
    greenhouse data with multiple mobile devices. The information can be transmitted
    over different frequencies in dissimilar intervals of time by using medium access
    control (MAC) protocol [68]. The other version of Bluetooth with ultra low cost
    and low power is known as Bluetooth low energy (BLE) which was combined with v4.0
    standard Bluetooth in the early stages [69]. 8) ZigBee ZigBee protocol is low
    energy consuming protocol having low cost, great performance, and capability to
    prevent interference. It comes in the topmost standards of IEEE 802.15.4 and has
    high-level communication. The consistency for wireless communication can be improved
    significantly in greenhouse farming by implementing this protocol [70]. E. Sensor-Technology
    In this era, there is a keen focus on the precise use of resources in greenhouse
    farming to enhance crop productivity. Many tasks are involved that are accomplished
    within the field, for instance, seeding, fertilizing, and watering, which are
    repetitive and required labor work [71]. Sensor technology is implemented within
    the smart-greenhouses for assisting the farmer to automate several tasks inside
    a greenhouse and to deliver precise climatic conditions (temperature/humidity,
    CO2, and irrigation) which are necessary for the effective growth of crops [72],
    [73]. Hence, sensor networks create a link between the real world and cyberspace
    to connect agriculture and IoT [74]. Following are the most widely used IoT sensors
    in greenhouse farming: 1) Biosensors The excessive amount of pesticides to increase
    crop productivity cause the wastage of water and oil. In this situation, smart
    greenhouses use environment friendly and energy-effective technology which consists
    of bio-sensors as well as physical sensors. Bio-sensors are a sub-group of chemical
    sensors that contain biological recognition components (enzyme, receptor, antibody,
    micro-organism) to analyze the crop health, growth, pesticide, and required quantity
    of fertilizer [75]–[77]. For example, the microbial sensor can simply discover
    the microbial activity within the soil. Their self-maintainability allows them
    to be dormant, tailored to accept the modification, and reusable to accomplish
    long-term monitoring procedures within the greenhouse. The deliverance of energy
    to sensors is achieved by the microbial fuel cell (MBC) [78]. Some functions that
    are performed by bio-sensors are detailed below. a: Soil Pesticides A large number
    of bio-sensors are used to detect pesticides in water and a heavy amount of nanostructured
    (bio) sensors have been realized for pest detection and monitoring in water and
    other resources. For instance, quantum dots, gold nanoparticles, and carbon nanotubes
    are the most widely used sensors. Similarly, a tyrosinase/TiO2 biosensor is used
    for herbicide (atrazine) detection in soil. b: Detect Nutrients Bio-sensor is
    inexpensive and competent to recognize the mandatory precise fertilizer doses
    at particular stages of plant growth by analyzing comprehensively soil and water
    patterns. For example, Mura et al. have been discovered nitrate discovery in water
    [79]. 2) Physical Sensors The physical sensors recognize the signal transformation
    via physical variation of the material inside the sensor which is principally
    humidity, temperature, and PH [80]. Some processes achieved by the physical sensor
    are discussed below: a: Temperature/Humidity Detection Sensor Temperature/humidity
    is recognized using DHT 11 sensor that contains two-component named as pyroelectric-film
    (for temperature recognition) and hygrometer (for humidity recognition). It is
    a power-efficient and reliable temperature and humidity monitoring sensor [32].
    Besides this, PIR sensors are also used to sense heat within the greenhouse. When
    temperature surges inside the greenhouse, the sensor transforms the effects into
    high-voltage output [1]. b: PH Sensor For detection of PH value in greenhouses,
    a reliable sensor is required that can make a precise PH measurement. For this
    purpose, a PH sensor is used to dip into pipelines, tanks, and open channels.
    It has a serial output form that shows a PH range from 2 to 12 [81]. SECTION VI.
    IoT Based Greenhouse Applications The advancement of IoT technology empowers things
    to be regulated remotely. Instead of controlling and monitoring a greenhouse farm
    manually, users can observe the day-by-day progress of cultivated crops by using
    IoT sensors/devices and mobile applications remotely. Several applications have
    been developed for making the farmers capable of efficiently controlling their
    greenhouse farms. In this section, we have discussed the applications of IoT in
    the greenhouse and a few mobile applications in table 2. TABLE 2 Smart-Greenhouse
    Mobile Applications A. Monitoring In greenhouses, the crop is cultivated under
    a controlled environment. The cultivation of a smart greenhouse is highly strong,
    therefore it needs high precision in terms of monitoring. Humidity, temperature,
    and light are the most important factors to monitor to obtain the high quality
    of the crop. The constant monitoring of such variables gives valuable and informative
    data to greenhouse farm managers for better understanding. Recent studies show
    that how IoT technology is innovating greenhouse farming patterns by minimizing
    the labor cost, human effort, and providing direct communication among farmers
    and stakeholders. Most of the researchers have concentrated only on remote monitoring
    greenhouse farming [82], [83], [84]. Further, to obtain high precision in greenhouse
    farming the well-evaluated crop models have been implemented which helps the farmers
    to take accurate measures [85]. The low power and low-cost nature of IoT networks
    make them the top choice among agriculturists and growers in the greenhouse to
    monitor the soil moisture content. Heble et al. [86] developed a low-cost and
    power-efficient system for monitoring greenhouse soil humidity. Moreover, IoT-enabled
    monitoring systems have approximately 83% prolonged lifetime at minimum cost.
    B. Controlling The greenhouse is an under-controlled farming method to cultivate
    plants and crops. To obtain a high yield of plants and crops, continuous controlling
    of environmental variables such as light intensity, soil PH, temperature, and
    CO2 are necessary. However, the major aim of IoT utilization in the greenhouse
    area is to develop cost-effective and simple solutions for controlling climatic
    parameters to achieve optimum growth of plants. Vimal et al. [87] developed an
    Arduino-based low-cost system to control the environmental parameters which are
    updated on regular basis. Multiple sensors/devices such as LDR sensor, PH sensor,
    and DHT11 sensors are implemented to measure the exact value of greenhouse environmental
    variables. The monitoring parameters are sent to the mobile phone in the form
    of short message services (SMS) to identify the present status of environmental
    factors. When the sensor value exceeds a certain amount of defined level, an SMS
    is sent to the greenhouse manager or farmer. In this way, a farmer can control
    his greenhouse farm from anywhere by knowing the present status of different controlling
    parameters. Subahi and Bouazza [29] proposed an intelligent greenhouse temperature
    controlling system by implementing IoT technologies. The objective of the developed
    structure is to control and monitor the internal temperature in order to maintain
    good conditions that increase productivity. Moreover, controlling the microclimate
    parameters in greenhouses is a real problem due to which growers face different
    microclimate issues. Sagheer et al. [88] proposed a multitier cloud-based IoT
    platform to control the microclimatic issues in the greenhouse. The proposed platform
    was implemented on the cultivation of cucumber in a commercial-sized greenhouse
    to enhance productivity and improve quality. Different actuators, controllers,
    and sensors were deployed in the greenhouse farm to offer wide-range communication
    to control the greenhouse. C. Tracking The IoT asset tracking application can
    track the location of assets, audit as well as monitor the assets in order to
    keep the centralized records accurate in all greenhouse farming businesses. The
    emergence of IoT with big data, AI, satellite images, drones, and GPS enables
    the farmers to put less human effort to track the greenhouse farm remotely. Besides
    this, the IoT-enabled system also helps the farmers to track machinery (drones,
    tractors) and unwanted movement on the farm. Satyanarayana et al. [70] has been
    proposed a crop health monitoring architecture that monitors the different soil
    patterns. In the proposed architecture ZigBee is integrated with GPS and GPRS
    for real-time data tracking. GPRS provides connectivity with a monitoring device
    and gives an alarm to the greenhouse farm, the owner when suspicious activity
    occurs. In this way, farmers can take corrective measures spontaneously in order
    to avoid any hassle. Although the maintenance cost of such a system is high it
    is extremely effective due to its exact tracking ability. SECTION VII. Open Issues
    and Challenges Although IoT has brought a great revolution in smart farming, still
    there exist some fundamental, development, and conceptual challenges in this area.
    In this section, IoT-based greenhouse farming technical and non-technical challenges
    have been discussed. A. IoT-Based Greenhouse Non-Technical Issues Digital farming
    faces new management and operation issues that suffer various non-technical challenges
    such as cost, plants disease detection, and marketing pricing. In this sub-section
    IoT-based greenhouse, non-technical challenges have been discussed. 1) Huge Investment
    A smart greenhouse does not use the sun as the key source of light for the procedure
    of photosynthesis [89]. They use artificial lights which are organized within
    the greenhouse farms. Therefore, lots of energy consumption by LEDs create a challenge
    for the greenhouse farmers to bear the energy expenses. Although the solar panel
    technique brings into use in vertical farms which are used in a larger range within
    the cities. But it is still difficult to accomplish the necessary amount of energy
    through this approach because of high building shades [90]. Moreover, plant growth
    may be affected due to the deficiency of these natural resources. Furthermore,
    IoT-based greenhouse farming has also nutrient supply issues. A huge investment
    is required to retain the equal distribution of nutrients to all portions of greenhouse
    farms [21]. 2) Fossil Fuel The greenhouse farmers face difficulty to take the
    produced yield to the market, as they have to manage the expenditures of transportation.
    The demand for fossil fuel and heavy machinery to plow seeds and harvest the crops
    is high which is costly. Therefore, it becomes hard for local farmers to take
    initiative in this regard. Furthermore, on a large scale, the extra use of fossil
    fuel can cause air pollution which is hazardous for human beings [91]. 3) Crop
    Disease Sometimes, crop disease is a major issue for the farmers because of having
    less knowledge for the transfer of the proper amount of nutrients. Unequally irrigating
    the plants inside the greenhouse can damage crop growth and cause different kinds
    of diseases [90]. 4) Soil Salinity Greenhouse farming becomes challenging in some
    regions due to the high salinity of the soil and water. Thus, the usage of saline
    water for irrigation purposes in the greenhouse at these locations can make the
    crop growth slow and lessen the production rate [78]. 5) Less Government Support
    Designing or developing an IoT-based greenhouse farm is a big challenge for the
    local farmers without government support. Some farmers follow indirect ways like
    the internet, agricultural exhibitions, and trial-and-error techniques to eradicate
    the trouble they face while running their greenhouse farms. These approaches lead
    them towards financial destruction [112]. 6) Marketing Pricing The market prices
    fluctuate day-by-day which is another problematic issue for the farmers. They
    try their best and invest their savings for greenhouse cultivation but in the
    end, they don’t get enough return due to which they shift to another crop, and
    shortfall for those specific crops arises [113]. B. IoT-Based Greenhouse Technical
    Issues In literature IoT technical issues in greenhouse farming have attracted
    a lot of attention such as communication protocols, connectivity issues, interoperability
    issues, low power WSNs, and sensor design. In this sub-section state-of-the-art
    IoT-based greenhouse technical challenges have been discussed. 1) Security and
    Privacy Issues Lack of security and privacy in IoT-enabled greenhouses is a key
    challenge. Therefore, it is difficult to handle the collected data regarding greenhouse
    environmental parameters. In case, there is a slight vulnerability within the
    system, the sensitive data may be lost. There are also low communication competencies
    and less storage that makes the implementation procedure of complex algorithms
    difficult. Likewise, chances of intrusions in wireless communication methods are
    more, for example, Distributed Denial of Services (DDOS) attack, forwarding attack,
    and congestion attack [90]. Thus, the security of smart-greenhouse farming consists
    of three major elements i.e. data confidentiality, authorization, and access control
    [104]. These three countermeasures must be employed for the data access phase.
    In addition, the authentication of particular entities can stop external attacks.
    Several security threats like Information leakage, wiretapping, tampering, and
    replay attacks can bring severe destruction to sensitive data of greenhouse farms.
    Users can overcome the probabilities of these outbreaks by implementing encryption
    algorithms and robust intrusion monitoring policies in the greenhouse network
    systems. 2) Lack of Connectivity Connectivity is the major challenge of IoT in
    greenhouse farming due to poor 2G/3G/4G coverage. Although some low power wide
    area technologies such as Sigfox and LoRa provide overcome such issues but they
    are not able to handle large datasets [105]. 3) Sensor Distribution Network Structure
    The sensors distribution directly impacts on controlling and monitoring parameters
    of a greenhouse farm [106]. Specified certain monitoring and regional requirements,
    the objective of this operation is to develop a sensor distribution network under
    specific constraints such as sensor cost and range. The optimization standards
    may be conflicting, such as the lowest costs and highest precision. Furthermore,
    the process models will be unique when sensors are portable. In addition, besides
    static network sensor models, dynamic and multi-objective optimization is also
    obligatory [106]. 4) Societal Acceptance The implementation of smart and innovative
    technologies will be a challenging task for non-technical users. Therefore, training
    and education are highly important to help the users or farmers understand the
    applicability and utilization of new technologies. However, in developing countries,
    farmers believe that there is no need for such enhancement and they are not willing
    to adapt IoT-based farming methods. So, thorough training is necessary for all
    stakeholders and non-technical users in the smart farming field [21]. 5) Nodes
    Repairing and Recharging In greenhouse farming, IoT architecture contains a wide
    selection of nodes with limited battery time. Furthermore, the nodes in remote
    areas are not able to connect solar panels and power grids. Moreover, the IoT
    nodes may be collapse or break down due to unpredicted events like severe weather
    and other farming activities. In addition, repairing and recharging network nodes
    implemented in greenhouse farms is one of the most complicated operation challenges.
    Battery lifetimes of any node in the network are often not stable due to battery
    types, environments, and discharge rates, therefore, regular recharge plans may
    cause the failure of network nodes [108]. 6) Data Processing Power Accessing the
    high scale processing power to resolve complex calculations at affordable cost
    is a significant challenge for medium and small-level farmers. So, the non-existence
    of data processing services considerably hinders IoT [109]. 7) Lack of Interoperability
    Data protocols, IoT communication standards, and common building blocks are required
    for millions of devices to interoperate [109]. This type of standard exists for
    weather data prediction, semantic modeling, agricultural machinery, and various
    initiatives such as the association of IoT standards with IEEE standards. Moreover,
    some standards such as ISOBUS standards have not been designed in parallel to
    the pace of change and new machinery has trademarked connectivity with the same
    manufacturer’s machinery. This approach follows vendor lockin and extended resistance
    from growers. So, here the challenge is not the unavailability or lack of standards
    but the major issue is the emergence of an unlimited number of standards. 8) Key
    Knowledge Greenhouse farming needed highly skillful and knowledgeable users to
    run IoT-based smart farming solutions. Unfortunately, in some areas, there are
    not sufficient resources and ways to get the awareness and appropriate skills
    about smart greenhouse farming. Hence, it leads the farmers to waste their assets
    without having the knowledge of the cultivation process [92]–[94]. 9) Technology
    Selection According to the geographical position and climatic circumstances, there
    are various technologies developed every day in the market. It is difficult for
    the consumer to choose what type of IoT technology is suitable for their greenhouse
    farming practices. Moreover, they also need to modernize the greenhouse system
    by the time which is an expensive and difficult procedure [90]. C. Future Research
    Directions in IoT-Based Greenhouse Farming Based on this survey and discussion
    of major technologies, sensors, and communication protocols, we will present future
    research directions and key developments in the following aspects. A generic platform
    is necessary to build for all kinds of crops and plants, quality of service (QoS),
    integration of explainable artificial intelligence for pest control, and crop
    growth monitoring. Explainable artificial intelligence is highly necessary in
    order to understand and analyze the reasons behind any specific decision [115].
    It hides the traditional farming method and empowers the farmers or growers in
    understanding the factor behind the obtained solution. At the perception layer,
    the development of the sensors should concentrate on new and innovative sensitive
    material, processes, mechanisms, and methodologies with low cost and minimum power
    consumption. Apart from this, it is necessary to accelerate the deployment of
    sensors and rapid detection of a plant’s life. On the application layer, organizations
    and governments should introduce unified standards for communication protocols,
    sensors, identification devices, and application services in protected greenhouse
    farming by international negotiation or corporation. The developers should design
    large and open-source databases as well as libraries of processing algorithms
    for multiple areas to facilitate the farmers. Moreover, at the network layer,
    we should concentrate on low power management strategies, high-capacity broadband
    communication protocols, and low power networks for complex greenhouse farming
    application environments. LPWAN is best for some greenhouse farming scenarios
    where voice and video support are not necessarily due to its low-power consumption,
    low cost, and high capacity. More focused research is needed in the future on
    IoT-based greenhouse farming solutions on LPWAN. With the widespread deployment
    of IoT sensors, there should be a virtualized sensor in which farmers have access
    to manage and control their IoT-based greenhouse farms virtually. A large volume
    of data is captured, forwarded, stored, and examined for efficient decision-making
    in an IoT-based smart greenhouse. Big data analytics is used to give predictive
    insights in smart greenhouse farming procedure by providing operational decisions.
    The major problem with data analytics is the sustainable integration of big data
    sources, intelligent processing, and data quality [101]. So, the openness of big
    data platforms is highly important subsequently it can authorize and empower the
    growers or farmers in their site in supply chains. IoT utilization generates a
    widespread experience of cyber security attacks, threats, and vulnerabilities
    in IoT-based greenhouse farming. Although, a number of intrusion detection systems
    (IDS) have been developed to mitigate the security attacks and analyze the network
    traffic to identify an infected device [102], [103]. But none of them provide
    a specific solution for smart farming. Therefore, development in ML-based IDS
    and a farm-specified access control mechanism is an open research direction. SECTION
    VIII. Smart Greenhouse Success Stories A lot of new opportunities for the farmers
    are provided in the developed countries to tackle the challenges they face, specifically
    in greenhouse farming. Garcia et al. [114] have been elaborated on several technological
    methods which are used in agricultural farming globally. Some success stories
    regarding IoT-enabled greenhouses in several countries have been explained in
    this section. A. Malaysia Malaysia faced problematic issues to cultivate sensitive
    crops like strawberries because of the equatorial country, but through the deployment
    of IoT-enabled greenhouse farms, it is potentially easy to produce strawberry
    plants [123]. Farmers installed IoT-based greenhouse farms on several locations
    in Malaysia to automatically regulate and monitor the internal environment which
    is suitable for the growth of plants. This system has also facilitated the user
    to remotely track the supply and distribution of the product. B. Korea Smart greenhouse
    farming is exponentially rising in Korea day-to-day [125]. Farmers breed several
    types of plants, for instance, tomatoes, strawberries, and sweet peppers efficiently
    by using IoT-based farming techniques. Park et al. [124] elaborated some important
    factors regarding greenhouse farming in Korea such as farm requirement, crop growing
    approaches, and pests controlling. The survey originates the significant threats
    for the greenhouse users and their satisfaction rate related to greenhouse farming.
    These results will be supportive to cope and design the greenhouse system in the
    future. C. Italy Agricultural practices are successfully experienced in Italy.
    They introduced different categories of energy proficient sources for greenhouse
    farming, one of them is producing electricity through a photovoltaic system that
    is also environment friendly [126]. Further, they also improved their existing
    greenhouse farming method to a modular, low-priced, and Long Range Wide Area Network
    (LoraWAN) based platform to observe environmental conditions related to the plants
    inside the greenhouse farm [127]. D. India A controlled greenhouse farm is implemented
    by the farmers to improve their yielding rate by accessing the climatic parameters
    (soil moisture, temperature/humidity, CO2) remotely within the greenhouse in India
    [128]. Further, in the hill areas like Uttar-Akhand it is difficult to accomplish
    greenhouse farming due to severe environmental conditions. Therefore, low-cost
    IoT-enabled greenhouses have been implemented for the cultivation of off-season
    crops and accomplished a good return on investment. E. China A wireless greenhouse
    technology has been established which is cost-effective and consumes less energy
    by controlling the greenhouse atmosphere automatically [11]. One of the Chinese
    provinces has practiced an IoT-based farm which has decreased the labor charges
    and surged the crop yielding rate proficiently as compared to traditional farming
    [129]. However, in rural areas, farmers have developed the agriculture system
    through government support. The sale procedure of agricultural products has been
    transferred to E-Commerce which overcome the cost and simplified the trading process
    [130]. F. Russia Several agricultural universities as well as a center for special
    analysis have been established under the Russian Agricultural ministry to train
    the farmers for digitalizing agriculture. Kulyasov et al. [131] described a model
    which interacts with different objects of agriculture like a smart greenhouse,
    smart garden, and smart field. This model provides the opportunity of using different
    digital technologies to precisely monitor and automatically control the atmospheric
    system for increasing the production rate. SECTION IX. IoT Based Greenhouse Industry
    Trends The IoT technology brought a revolutionary change in the agriculture sector
    all over the world. Top technology firms are also effectively working in the area
    of greenhouse farming to facilitate farmers all over the world and minimize the
    key challenges regarding farming practices. Besides this, some IoT gadgets have
    been shown in Figure 14 that are playing an imperative role in smart greenhouse
    farming. FIGURE 14. IoT greenhouse products. Show All Xtreme IoT kit acts as a
    weather monitoring sensor with the capabilities of improved sensing and efficient
    accuracy [132]. However, the sensor also measures oxygen volume, the required
    amount of fertilization, and water quantity in the soil. Leaf moistness can be
    determined by using a wetness sensor [133]. It uses electrical resistance to find
    the moisture content on the leaf surface within the greenhouse. A greenhouse drone
    is used to monitor the cultivation area and find the area that is not properly
    irrigated [134]. The weather station is used for the distribution of greenhouse
    data to a master sensor within a 600-meter range [135]. The water leakage detector
    finds water leakage using a rope sensor within a 3 to 10-meter area and forwards
    the notification to the farmer [136]. Smart valve is a wireless battery operated
    and low power consumption valve to irrigate crops in greenhouses farm at long-distance
    [137]. A rat trap is used to remotely monitor, store, and alert the farmer about
    rodent activity within the greenhouse farm [138]. The water flow meter monitors
    the water consumption on a daily basis and informs the user regarding water usage
    in the greenhouse [139]. The ultrasonic sensor has the ability to identify specific
    plant growth in the smart greenhouse to keep the farmer updated about the growth
    rate [140]. Auto filler is used to replenish the water tank automatically when
    the tank becomes empty [141]. Moreover, table 3 has presented the top technology
    firm’s efforts regarding greenhouse farming. TABLE 3 IoT Based Greenhouse Farming
    Statistics/Prototypes TABLE 4 Smart-Greenhouse Efforts by Some Prominent Organizations
    SECTION X. Conclusion The current status of the research has indicated that it
    was feasible to remotely monitor the greenhouse parameters such as CO2, PH, moisture
    content, humidity, temperature, and irrigation by using IoT sensors and devices.
    In this survey, we have discussed emerging technologies of IoT and provided a
    rigorous discussion on IoT-based greenhouse farming patterns. Furthermore, various
    traditional and developed cultivation techniques are discussed which can help
    the growers to understand the technological structure of a greenhouse. In addition,
    we have also discussed the IoT-enabled greenhouse network structure based on cloud
    and big data analysis, which act as an IoT backbone and help farmers to increase
    crop productivity. Moreover, this survey provides a state-of-the-art overview
    of IoT-based greenhouse farming applications, sensors/devices, communication protocols,
    and technologies. Furthermore, several important dimensions of IoT-greenhouse
    farming, top technology firm’s trends, and success stories performance metrics
    have been discussed to succor the stakeholders. This article also considers many
    IoT-enabled greenhouse open issues and security challenges with future research
    directions. From this comprehensive survey, it is clear that the government and
    many big organizations have started investing to develop new smart greenhouse
    farming techniques by using IoT. Lastly, it is expected that this research generates
    very useful information for agriculturists, researchers, policymakers, and technologists
    who are researching and working in the IoT-based smart farming field. Authors

  data_sources: Farm records and data from digital forage measurement technologies
  explanation: The researchers conducted a study on the use of digital forage measurement
    technologies on dairy farms to quantify the impacts on farmer decisions and farm
    systems, with a focus on the economic benefits of improved decision-making. Economic
    valuation and farm financial modeling were used to assess the impacts, considering
    factors such as increased milk production, reduced feed costs, and improved reproductive
    performance. The study highlights the potential economic benefits of adopting
    digital forage measurement technologies in dairy farming, providing valuable insights
    for farmers and policymakers.
  extract_1: This research demonstrates that use of digital forage measurement technologies
    and strategies by farmers can have a significant positive impact on their decision-making
    and farm system impacts. In this case study, modeling results suggest that the

    impulse towards a larger introduction of Information and Communication Technology
    (ICT) in the agricultural field is currently experiencing its momentum, as digitisation
    has large potentialities to provide benefits for both producers and consumers;
    on the other hand, pushing technological solutions into a rural context encounters
    several challenges. In this work, we provide a survey of the most recent research
    activities, in the form of both research projects and scientific literature, with
    the objective of showing the already achieved results, the current investigations,
    and the still open challenges, both technical and non technical. We mainly focus
    on the EU territory, identifying threats and concerns, and then looking at existing
    and upcoming solutions to overcome those barriers. Previous article in issue Next

    computing5GSatelliteUAV 1. Introduction Smart Farming (SF) refers to the application
    of ICT to agriculture. Data collected and analysed through ICT techniques support
    efficient production processes [1], thus motivating scientists, practitioners,
    private and public companies to work towards the goal of developing and encouraging
    the use of innovative technologies to support farmers on the ground. According
    to the European Union (EU), the most relevant technologies and techniques to be
    fully exploited are the satellite imagery, the use of agricultural robots, a larger
    use of sensor nodes to collect data, and the potentialities of Unmanned Aerial
    Vehicles (UAVs) for aerial imagery and actuation. Those indications are contained
    into the declaration of cooperation on A smart and sustainable digital future
    for European agriculture and rural areas1 signed on April 2019 by 24 EU countries.
    According to the aforementioned declaration, the first obstacle towards a full
    implementation of SF in rural areas is the lack of connectivity, i.e., digital
    divide. The advent of 5G is promising to improve such a situation in rural and
    low-income areas [2], but scattered coverage must be still taken into account,
    as highlighted in recent surveys in the EU territory [3]. Rural areas remain challenging,
    not being covered by any Next Generation Access network: up to 53% at the end
    of 2017 in EU [3]. Putting this issue aside, a plethora of initiatives can be
    identified towards the objective of the digitisation of agriculture. As an exemplary
    case, Smart AKIS, an EU-funded thematic network promoted by the Agricultural European
    Innovation Partnership (EIP-AGRI) established in 2016, aims to close the gap between
    scientific knowledge and practitioners, in order to promote concrete solutions
    to be implemented. A solution can be defined as anything that makes the farming
    practice more controlled and accurate through ICT, reducing both the costs and
    the environmental impact, while also increasing the production. SF has the potential
    to also improve work safety, contributing to the sustainability of agriculture
    [1], but its socio-economic implications are debated [4]. In this innovative approach
    of farm management, a key component is the use of hardware and software technologies,
    like the deploying of sensor nodes, control systems, robotics, satellites for
    imagery and positioning, data storage and analysis, advisory systems, and terrestrial
    and aerial drones. However, the aim of SF should not be just in industrializing
    agriculture, but in making the whole process more efficient, sustainable, and
    of high quality, while respecting farmers’ needs. SF dates back to the middle
    of the 80’s, but it has been practiced commercially only since the 90’s [5]. However,
    many farmers are still skeptical about the actual advantages it can offer. This
    can be explained by considering the profit and the direct benefits for the farm.
    In fact, it is not straightforward to identify those [6], for instance when considering
    Capital Expenditures (CAPEX) and Operating Expenditures (OPEX) for software, machinery,
    and data. Farmers generally tend to identify SF as a set of tools that benefits
    only large holdings, both in crop and livestock production. This is linked to
    the perception of high costs and complexity of the involved technologies. What
    is lacking from this image is the possibility that innovative technologies might
    not be only large-scale and thus costly, but rather also slow and precise, plus
    small and cheap [7]. Nowadays, SF is rapidly taking advantage of recent technological
    advancements for improving agricultural practices [8], further than business models
    for lowering adoption costs. For instance, rental programs for farming equipment,
    like Trringo in India, make possible farm mechanization processes with affordable
    costs for farmers, also providing support services. Such an initiative can be
    categorised as cooperative farming, potentially increasing the penetration of
    SF in low-income areas. Karnott, a French company, is pushing both web services
    and hardware solutions to transform legacy equipment into SF-ready one. Karnott
    sells a control unit to be installed on agricultural machines, offering several
    services through a battery-powered device, collecting and exchanging real-time
    data, as well as geolocation. Then, collected data can be exploited through on-line
    services, like those provided by api-agro, a secure platform to share data. Available
    data can be accessed and fed to different management systems, thus offering a
    valuable repository for farms. Taranis offers a platform using aerial and satellite
    imagery joint with Artificial Intelligence (AI) techniques to provide a Decision
    Support System (DSS) for Precision Farming (PF) applications. AgriOpenData provides
    a DSS as well, exploiting blockchain, UAVs, and adding support services on top
    of it. When considering fully autonomous solutions, Iron Ox offers a complete
    robotic solution to grow plants, from seeds to harvest, with a hydroponic system
    able to strongly reduce the water consumption. At last, traceability is experiencing
    a revolution thanks to digital ledgers. Even if it cannot be considered immediately
    within the umbrella of SF, still the origin and the quality of agricultural products
    remains a central issue. Carrefour, a French multinational retailer, is betting
    on blockchain as a solution to provide trustable data to consumers and intermediate
    actors. Blockchain is used by Hectare Agritech in a farm trading platform as well,
    highlighting how innovative paradigms can be adapted to different use cases in
    the agricultural field. The aim of this work is to survey both research initiatives
    and scientific literature on the topic of SF, looking at recent technologies and
    techniques being used or being actively pushed for adoption. In addition, we discuss
    still open challenges hampering such an objective. The rest of this work is structured
    as follows: Section 2 surveys research and innovation projects covering SF activities
    in the EU territory, then the scope of the survey is enlarged by taking into account
    the state of the art in the scientific literature. Section 3 discusses the open
    challenges at today, considering both technical and non-technical factors. Finally,
    Section 4 draws the conclusions and opens to future directions. 2. State of the
    art This section provides two main contributions. The first one is in Section
    2.1, surveying relevant research projects recently funded by the EU in the field
    of SF; the aim is to highlight the increasing attention towards those activities,
    and then to identify the involved technologies. Table 1 provides an overview of
    surveyed R&I projects. Furthermore, Fig. 1 depicts relevant agricultural operations
    as faced by the described research projects, and the technological solutions exploited
    in the latter ones. The second contribution is in Section 2.2, surveying the scientific
    works that propose solutions for the implementation of SF. Table 2 provides an
    overview of surveyed literature, then a keyword analysis is proposed in Fig. 2.

    2. Number of occurrences of relevant keywords (at least 50) as they appear in
    the surveyed literature: the 4 categories, as proposed in Table 2, can be read
    internally, and each keyword is weighted (circle radius) in the cluster it belongs
    to. 2.1. EU research projects In last years, the EU has been actively undertaking
    R&I activities laying the ground for the digitisation of agriculture by exploiting
    data-empowered strategies; strategic interventions have been funded to support
    the uptake of digital technologies, to develop new digital solutions and to sustain
    the crucial assessment of the socio-economic impacts of digitisation. In Table
    1, 30 recent EU projects closely related to SF are presented: the first 21 projects,
    spanning from 2015 to 2019, propose, develop, and test the use of digital technologies
    in this field; the 9 projects in the last rows, spanning from 2012 to 2019, have
    the complementary objective of strengthen or evaluate the use of ICT in agriculture,
    for instance through challenge-based strategies, or by setting up marketplaces
    to browse existing solutions ready for use. Most projects jointly exploit multiple
    techniques and technologies; here, we highlight only the most prominent ones.
    2.1.1. Cloud/edge-based systems Cloud platforms are mainly exploited in projects
    that are related to monitoring activities, like growth of plants, water availability,
    soil moisture maps, and so on. There is a clear dominance of cloud solutions with
    respect to those based on edge solutions, because the former is a more established
    option than the latter. The AgriCloud P2 project proposed a cloud-based PF management
    system for a sustainable and intensive agriculture to secure long-term food supply
    in Europe. The APMAV project consists of an intuitive solution for agricultural
    management based on UAV technology and an intelligent cloud-based platform that
    provides farmers valuable, actionable and real-time recommendations for driving
    down costs and improving crop performance. The Flourish project leverages UAVs
    as well, aiming at surveying a field from the air, then at performing a targeted
    intervention on the ground with an Unmanned Terrestrial Vehicle (UTV). The idea
    is to provide a DSS requiring minimal user intervention to target PF applications.
    The SWAMP project develops Internet of Things (IoT)-based methods and approaches
    for smart water management in the precision irrigation domain, in order to utilize
    water more efficiently and effectively, avoiding both under- and over-irrigation.
    The AfriCultuReS project, beyond the use of cloud-based technology, also exploits
    the data collected from different sources (e.g. service providers, weather services)
    to develop an integrated agricultural monitoring and early warning system, based
    on remote sensing, to support decision making. The DataBio project makes intensive
    use of big data techniques related to the raw material production from agriculture,
    forestry, fishery and aquaculture for the production of food, energy, and biomaterials
    in a sustainable way, by means of a software platform integrating big data and
    Earth Observation (EO) methods. Data-driven activities are also proposed in the
    just started Dragon project, whose main efforts are directed towards skill transfers
    to ease PF adoption. Large heterogeneous data sources are considered and analysed
    to offer agricultural knowledge and information systems by ambitiously leveraging
    several techniques. The BigDataGrapes project makes use of big data techniques
    in the context of viticulture, supporting decisions by exploiting real-time analysis
    of large, diverse and multimodal data sources. It has been exploiting the use
    of UAVs as well in vineyards. Last but not least, the IoF2020 project is one of
    the most comprehensive projects from the point of view of SF digital technologies:
    in particular, this project accelerates the adoption of IoT, in order to secure
    sufficient, safe and healthy food and at strengthening competitiveness of farming
    and food chains in Europe. A large scale pilot programme has been started in IoF2020
    to develop and test specific technological solutions in the following sectors:
    arable, dairy, fruits, vegetables, and meat. 2.1.2. Unmanned vehicles The use
    of unmanned vehicles is another trend of great interest. Beyond the aforementioned
    Flourish, APMAV, BigDataGrapes, and Dragon projects, the PANTHEON project, by
    taking advantage of the technological advancements in the fields of robotics,
    remote sensing and big data management, aims at designing an integrated system
    where heterogeneous unmanned robotic components (terrestrial and aerial robots)
    move within the orchards to collect data and perform common farming operations.
    The SWEEPER project has proposed a robotic system to harvest sweet peppers in
    greenhouses, leveraging on machine vision techniques to acquire both colour and
    distance information, and then storing collected peppers in an on-board container.
    Another robotic platform has been developed in the ROMI project to assist in weed
    reduction and crop monitoring, reducing manual labour. Land robots also acquire
    detailed information on sample plants, and an UAV assists by providing information
    at crop level. The GreenPatrol-Robot project designed and built a satellite-guided
    autonomous robot for pest control in greenhouses. It exploits Galileo satellite
    services to navigate, achieving good positioning accuracy inside greenhouses.
    The AFarCloud project aims at the agricultural productivity increase via PF techniques.
    The proposed solution is a distributed platform for autonomous farming robots
    that allows the integration and real-time cooperation of agricultural systems
    to increase efficiency, productivity, and food quality. This platform is integrated
    with a Farm Management System (FMS) to support monitoring and decision-making
    solutions based on real-time data mining techniques. The RUC-APS project is centered
    on management approaches aiming at enhancing SF solutions in agriculture systems,
    applying operational research to optimise farm production. 2.1.3. Satellite-based
    activities Several projects are mainly based on improving the information derived
    from satellite optical data. The AGRORADAR project aims at delivering innovative
    algorithms and data models that can process Copernicus EO Syntethic Aperture Radar
    (SAR) data to achieve precise and detailed information. The AUDITOR project develops
    an improved Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) augmentation system for
    services in PF applications. The project enables cost-effective PF services to
    farmers, like recommendations regarding site-specific application of water, fertilizer
    and pesticides. The WATER4AGRI project combines microwave data obtained from different
    satellites to provide datasets for retrieving key information about water availability
    for crops at field level. The SENSAGRI project combines optical and radar measurements
    to develop three prototype services for near real-time operations: surface soil
    moisture, green and brown Leaf Area Index (LAI), and crop type mapping. The MISTRALE
    project provides soil moisture maps to decision makers in water management using
    GNSS reflectometry (GNSS-R) via satellites and UAVs. The project has developed
    a prototype sensor embedded on a dedicated software platform. The APOLLO project
    brings PF closer to farmers through affordable information services, making extensive
    use of free and open EO data. The proposed services help farmers to make better
    decisions by monitoring the growth and health of crops, providing advice on when
    to irrigate and till their fields, and estimating the size of their harvest. The
    services are designed to be always available thanks to a web platform and a mobile
    application. 2.1.4. Mitigating digital divide Other research projects are mainly
    focused on bringing the advantages of SF to farmers in a way compatible with their
    needs and digital skills, thus reducing digital divide. The SMART-AKIS initiative
    sets up a self-sustainable thematic network on SF technologies designed for the
    effective exchange of knowledge among research, industry, and the farming community,
    disseminating direct applicable research and commercial solutions, and capturing
    grassroots level needs and innovative ideas. The 4D4F project (Data Driven Dairy
    Decision For Farmers) focuses on the benefits provided by sensors in monitoring
    animals and environment, supporting informed decisions. The project hosts a large
    repository of ICT solutions freely browseable by farmers. The SmartAgriHubs project
    brings together 164 partners in the European agri-food sector, carrying out 28
    flagship innovation experiments for digitisation in five agri-food sectors: arable
    farming, livestock, vegetable, fruits, and aquaculture. The overall goal of ICT-AGRI-2
    is to strengthen the research within the area of PF and to develop a common research
    agenda concerning ICT and robotics in agriculture in Europe. Its main objectives
    are: mapping and analysis of existing research and future needs; development of
    instruments and procedures for transnational funding activities; development of
    strategic research agenda and programmes; and establishment of international collaborations
    and networks. Other projects, like Nefertiti, Euraknos, and Desira are setting
    up thematic networks with the objective of promote networking activities, data
    sharing and knowledge exchange. They leverage the vast set of already available
    ICT tools to promote their use in SF contexts and to foster their adaption to
    practitioners’ needs. The DESIRA project, started at June 2019, intends to collect
    practitioners’ needs through 20 national living labs in EU and then to design
    ICT use cases to meet those demands in a Responsible Research and Innovation (RRI)
    fashion. The Fairshare project has data collecting and sharing as foremost objectives,
    in order to build a network able to reduce the agricultural digital divide. Finally,
    FarmingBySatellite is an initiative to promote the use of Galileo as GNSS and
    EO services. It launches a biyearly challenge to identify promising ideas using
    satellite technologies for SF purposes. 2.1.5. Considerations Summing up, some
    considerations can be made: monitoring fields and crops is quite diffused at today,
    leveraging local and remote sensing solutions, i.e., in-field sensors, UAVs, up
    to satellites. Another major challenge is the optimisation of water use. Unmanned
    vehicles enable semi- and full-autonomous scenarios, currently representing a
    major objective for both research institutes and private companies. Anyway, almost
    all surveyed projects aim at providing DSSs instead of autonomous solutions; in
    fact, there is still wide scepticism on them by practitioners as viable alternatives
    to human decisions. To feed DSSs, data analysis techniques are used, also supporting
    automatic actions based on feedback, and farmers’ decisions. Machine learning
    techniques are typically exploited for dedicated applications in the projects
    we considered, such as prediction and estimation of farming parameters to optimise
    livestock production or crop monitoring. 2.2. Scientific literature SF represents
    the evolution of agriculture driven by ICT technologies. ICT provides tools, methods,
    and techniques with the potential to improve both the modeling and the practice
    in this sector. SF is intrinsically tied to large-scale heterogeneous sensing
    [9], involving different hardware, algorithms, and protocols, thus too focused
    approaches have gained little traction at now. In what follows, we survey a very
    recent and exemplary subset of the scientific literature on such a topic, then
    schematised in Table 2. To further highlight what is currently trending in recent
    scientific literature, we show the most used keywords in Fig. 2, according to
    the four thematic clusters we define in Table 2. Each keyword is presented weighted
    in its cluster according to the number of occurrences. Finally, Table 3 maps typical
    application scenarios and data types to commonly used sensing solutions [10,11].

    techniques and management systems SF makes large use of sensor nodes to collect
    data on the environment and the phenomenon under observation. For instance, in
    the case of agriculture, soil sensors, placed at different depths, complement
    data collected from EO satellites, providing enriched information. More generally,
    indoor and outdoor Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs), both mobile and fixed, are
    used to collect heterogeneous data [14] for evaluating different indexes, such
    as the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), the excess green index,
    the LAI, and so on. Given the fundamental role played by data and data sources
    in this context [12], the historical evolution of sensing for PF in Ref. [5] offers
    a valuable perspective. At the beginning, three methodological approaches were
    considered: the first two ones, namely farming by soil and site-specific crop
    management, were contrasting because the former promoted soil mapping, while the
    latter promoted homogeneous actions in sub-units of farm fields, i.e., a punctual
    approach versus a clustered one. The third approach, namely proximal soil sensing,
    came later, consisting in continuous real-time sensing by sensors mounted on tractors.
    It can be considered the father of the PF approaches in use nowadays. Thanks to
    satellites, proximal soil sensing evolved into remote soil sensing, introducing
    spectral analyses. To allow farm managers to exploit all those heterogeneous data
    sources, increasing complex software platforms were introduced to take advantage
    of raw data and of subsequent elaboration: they are referred to as FMIS [13].
    2.2.2. Unmanned vehicles Real-time stream processing, analysis, and reasoning
    are key concepts towards automation in the agricultural field [22], i.e., towards
    a larger use of robots that can adapt to space- and time-varying conditions with
    minimal delay. Robots can perform very precise operations, and can operate in
    fleets, as proposed in Ref. [23], which considers both UTVs and UAVs. Moving systems
    rely on GNSS techniques for precise positioning, and PF applications need large
    accuracy. Several commercial systems integrate a GNSS receiver and use one or
    more fixed Real-Time Kinematic (RTK) reference base stations [26] for providing
    accuracy up to centimeters. Further than precise positioning, robots depend on
    machine-vision systems to navigate the environment [25]; according to the technology
    and the scenario under consideration, specific spectral signatures are of interest,
    as for instance hyperspectral imagery in both local and remote sensing. Commercial
    devices, to be used on board, already capture both RGB and Near Infrared Imagery
    (NIR) bands, and stereovision systems are used for 3D maps [25]. Further than
    terrestrial vehicles, aerial ones have been revolutionising the practices in this
    sector. PF is taking large advantage of UAVs, with several commercial systems
    able to fly at different speeds and altitudes [24], ranging from fixed to rotary
    wing machines. UAVs are used for monitoring scenarios, further than pesticide
    spraying, which is a key application for PF [18]. Heavy and large UAVs can be
    used for such a purpose in the case of large fields, jointly with multispectral
    techniques to generate NDVI maps to be used for spraying pesticides and fertilizers
    where needed. Such a potential has been subject to increasing attention in the
    last years. For instance, UAVs can be used to assess if an area has been subject
    to plowing, and the plowing depths. The authors in Ref. [15] consider the use
    of UAVs for such a purpose as an alternative to the use of satellites. In fact,
    according to the authors, even high-resolution satellites cannot classify the
    roughness of the terrain, thus motivating the use of UAVs. A RGB camera has been
    used for data collection and a visual assessment, and collected georeferenced
    data are analysed to assess the plowing depths. RGB and NIR are collected by means
    of an UAV also in Ref. [16], with the aim of classifying plants and weeds. The
    proposed system makes use of the Excess Green Index (ExG) [16] in the case of
    RGB-only; if NIR is exploited as well, NDVI can be estimated and used because
    of the richer information it provides. By combining these results with geometric
    features, sugar beets can be recognised even in the case of overlapping plants.
    NDVI has been used in viticulture for precision applications [21] as well: in
    fact, using an UAV to collect detailed images in a vineyard, plant rows can be
    discriminated from inter-rows, identifying missing plants with good precision.
    UAVs can be seen as part of a WSN, acting as mobile nodes [17], thus the analytical
    characterisation of the channel model between a moving UAV and fixed terrestrial
    nodes becomes of interest [20]. Low-power 802.15.4-based solutions have been investigated
    in rural contexts, using UAVs as data mules [19]. 2.2.3. IoT platforms As aforementioned
    in Section 1, Internet connectivity is a key requirement for SF. In fact, its
    availability allows IoT-based scenarios to emerge [33], increasing the degree
    of remote control and automation. This is well supported by IoT features, such
    as interoperability and easiness of integration [36]. Anyway, in rural contexts,
    terrestrial connectivity may be lacking. Because of this, aerospace solutions
    for connectivity are a viable option [8]. Looking at the literature, reference
    [30] proposes an IoT platform for PF based on FIWARE.2 It considers the case of
    a greenhouse, where Internet connectivity is likely available, thus opening to
    data exchanges via protocol stacks relying on common IoT protocols, like CoAP
    and MQTT. In greenhouses, the main objectives are typically climate control and
    soil monitoring. The Agricolus software platform, which is a FIWARE-based DSS
    for tobacco crops, is described in Ref. [29], designed to collect soil data via
    802.15.4-based WSNs. The FIWARE middleware is a software enabler in very different
    scenarios [13,29]. Along to climate control systems, irrigation systems have been
    proposed to optimise water use. In Ref. [28], FIWARE cloud components are integrated
    in a PF application to reduce water use. In Ref. [31], tomatoes in a greenhouse
    are monitored, and the authors propose an analytical framework to assess the performance
    of different tested configurations by relying on plant transpiration. The works
    in Refs. [27,32] consider the use of low-cost and general purpose sensor nodes,
    built upon the Arduino platform and upon MICAz Motes, respectively, as information
    sources in greenhouses. Being able to deploy low-cost and easily replaceable sensor
    nodes is a priority for a larger adoption of SF techniques. A core demand is related
    to power consumption: battery-powered devices lasting several years, as for instance
    ZigBee ones in Ref. [27], are fundamental in farm deployments. Apart from FIWARE,
    a plethora of different platforms can be identified as enablers for SF [34]. Those
    platforms aggregate heterogeneous data, then analysed and interpreted in order
    to provide additional value. Here, semantic analyses have been proposed as well,
    like for instance the valuable work in Ref. [35]. The Agri-IoT architecture, a
    layered and complex framework, provides additional value to DSSs because it further
    facilitates informed and accurate decisions thanks to semantic web and real-time
    reasoning. 2.2.4. Decision Support Systems DSSs are one of the most used solutions
    for SF because they provide support to farmers, offering a point of access to
    useful information, according to the aim of the system, and suggesting a plausible
    course of action in a given context. Aims can be very different: minimising the
    impact of diseases in tomatoes by applying automatic climate control [37]; ‘time-to-sow’
    alerts, and cattle monitoring [38]; anticipating potential crop dysfunctions in
    a proactive way [39]; pest control [40]; selecting appropriate alternative crops
    in a given area [41]. Those are just few examples of what can be offered by recent
    developments of DSSs in the agricultural sector. 2.2.5. Considerations Some considerations
    can be made also here: for instance, looking at Fig. 2, it is visible how data
    is a relevant keyword for all clusters. This is a key topic in the context of
    SF, thus deepened in Section 3. A notable exception is visible in the cluster
    Unmanned Vehicles, in which system outnumbers data: this can be explained by taking
    into account that unmanned vehicles are typically considered in an autonomous
    scenario, i.e., within a system composed of several interacting parts. The keywords
    pertaining to the cluster Unmanned Vehicles take the most part of Fig. 2, graphically
    highlighting the technological complexity of designed systems, and the very large
    number of operations that can be performed by those. Finally, what in Fig. 1 can
    be put in relation with what presented in Fig. 2: as an example, in the former
    monitoring operations are practically ubiquitous, and this is confirmed by the
    large number of occurrences of keywords like thing (as in smart thing or IoT)
    and sensor in the latter. 3. Open challenges This section briefly discusses the
    open challenges hampering a larger adoption of SF, summarised in Fig. 3 as well.
    Several technologies pushing for a larger adoption of SF practices have already
    been cited within this work, such as fully autonomous flight control, early identification
    of plant diseases, and reliable virtual fences [1], as well as more general ones,
    as AI, robotics, high performance computing, IoT, and 5G, which are reported within
    the EU declaration cited in Section 1. AI probably represents the largest challenge
    at now and, at the same time, opportunity in several sectors, including the agricultural
    one. The EU is largely investing on it because convinced it will be the upcoming
    disruptive game changer. In fact, the AI4EU initiative, started at the beginning
    of 2019, aims at the transformation of AI into a compelling solution in several
    application scenarios. Download : Download full-size image Figure 3. Overview
    of open challenges in the SF field: technical challenges (on the right) are discussed
    in Section 3.1, non-technical challenges (on the left) are discussed in Section
    3.2. 3.1. Technical challenges Looking at sensor nodes and sensor networks, we
    refer to the valuable works in Refs. [14,42], which survey the use of fixed and
    mobile solutions. According to the authors, advances are needed to further lower
    costs and to design specific solutions for the agricultural context, which requires
    solutions able to resist to difficult conditions (e.g., specific soil properties,
    exposition to high/low temperature, water resistance, fine dusts, and so on).
    Further than costs, solutions are needed toward larger energy efficiency, including
    energy harvesting techniques, and reliability in data collection and transmission,
    in order to minimize the need of maintenance for the deployed solutions. Specific
    issues of the agricultural domain need targeted answers, in particular the deployment
    strategies, to be designed according to fields segmentation and to farmers’ requirements.
    One of the main drivers of the diffusion of WSN in agriculture has been IoT: it
    has marked the transition from closed-source systems and disconnected software
    solutions towards connected systems built upon interoperable solutions. Those
    characteristics are favorable to cost reduction and to easiness of integration.
    Challenges here are overall related to network capabilities, data security, and
    data privacy [33]. Data is one of the most critical topic in the agricultural
    sector. Data ownership, protection, and security are perceived as not sufficiently
    close to farmers’ needs, thus becoming threats to be mitigated, if not completely
    avoided. In more words, nowadays, digital solutions for SF are under-utilised
    because practitioners fear data misuse and the loss of control over their business.
    Data protection must be enhanced to transform into a transparent operation, keeping
    in mind that agriculture is typically a private business activity (i.e., a not
    transparent activity), and data transfers to external systems (e.g. cloud) must
    be controllable and well described to increase acceptance. An option towards larger
    acceptance comes from the possibility for farmers to benefit from business with
    their data, and to benefit from public and official data released in an open fashion.
    On this, the valuable work of the EU with the Galileo services is a notable example
    of good practice, collecting and releasing data through application programming
    interfaces [43]. Further from data, open and used standards for data handling
    is compelling to move towards horizontal solutions instead of vertical ones [44].
    Large IoT platforms generate huge amounts of data to be analysed, thus calling
    for data analytic techniques able to extract meaningful information. Nowadays,
    big data immediately come to mind [45] as a set of strategies towards this objective,
    but it must be noted that its application to agriculture is recent. Generally
    speaking, the big data paradigm goes in an opposite direction with respect to
    acquiring more control over own data by farmers. To counteract that, the possibility
    for farmers to economically gain from sharing and accessing large volumes of data
    works as an incentive [46]. In Ref. [47], the authors underline the difficulties
    in discovering and combining large heterogeneous datasets in the agro-environmental
    field, often complicated by lacking of metadata. Furthermore, the need for semantic
    analyses and interoperability is highlighted in Ref. [47]. Natural language processing
    and machine learning techniques play a role here, facilitated by existing initiatives
    for building and maintaining open large repositories for training purposes, like
    CINERGI by Earthcube. Once meaningful information is available thanks to raw data
    sources and to analytics techniques, decision making is performed. This is where
    machine learning techniques and, more generally, AI can be fully exploited toward
    autonomous systems. To this aim, a fundamental challenge is moving intelligence
    from cloud platforms to closer computation platforms, such as edge solutions,
    handling and processing data close to the source, thus reducing delays. Multi-Access
    Edge Computing (MEC), jointly with 5G, is expected to play a role here. In the
    case of agricultural autonomous systems, real-time constraints are more easily
    satisfied by edge solutions than remote centralised systems. According to Ref.
    [48], in order to build sustainable infrastructure, the several emerging architecture
    paradigms (with different degrees of centralised and distributed entities) must
    comply to open standards for both easiness of implementation and cost reduction.
    Environmental monitoring and real-time agricultural data analytics and control
    can benefit from those paradigms, for instance by providing localized information
    about pollution and pests in the vicinity of edge servers [49]. 3.2. Socio-economic
    and other non-technical challenges This section discusses non-technical issues
    still holding back a larger diffusion of SF, at least in the EU. In fact, uptake
    in EU is rather low if compared to what expected [50]. Incentives and policies
    play a large role, considering national and EU rules, economical and skills perspectives.
    In Ref. [50], the authors show how financial and government incentives are the
    most influential solution, followed by training and other non-financial support.
    Farmers’ concerns are related to the time to recover the investment, and to the
    difficulties in evaluating the advantages; small farms have almost no adoption
    at all, also because the machinery has no support for more advanced technology.
    Sole farmers show a large interest in SF tools, which may come as unexpected,
    because it reduces exposure to occupational accidents and injuries; anyway, those
    barriers still hold back its use [51]. Because of those reasons, initiatives like
    those presented in Section 1 have a significant socio-economic value: cooperative
    farming with support services for a better handling of costs and needed investments;
    hardware solutions to transform legacy equipment into SF-ready machinery to avoid
    too high initial costs and to have time to familiarise with new technology; secure
    and open platforms for sharing data and getting back useful information, helping
    in assessing potential advantages. Research activities aiming at reducing the
    agricultural digital divide have an impact as well, helping farmers with new ICT-based
    tools in their daily work; on the other hand, different strategies in designing
    innovative ICT tools must be considered, like using natural language [52] to explicitly
    take into account potentially low-literate speakers. Nowadays, the right to access
    and use the collected data is at the center of the discussion: COPA-COGECA, an
    European farming representative organisation, in cooperation with CEMA, the European
    agricultural machinery association, has recently released a code of conduct to
    grant the data originator (i.e., the farmer) a leading role in controlling the
    access to and the use of data.3 The concerns on data use and access have been
    explored also in Ref. [4], highlighting existing scepticism by Australian farmers
    and divergence of expectations between involved actors. On the one hand, marketers
    and traders expect that big data techniques increase the reliability of predictions
    in the market dynamics; on the other hand, farmers are convinced that power asymmetries
    will increase, thus acting as a brake. Similar considerations are in Ref. [53],
    when looking to Ireland: whilst recognizing that SF is a real opportunity for
    the farming context, potential challenges and risks should be carefully considered
    to anticipate and reduce the gap among winners and losers. 4. Conclusions and
    future directions In this work, we surveyed the most relevant research activities
    aiming at improving and encouraging the adoption of SF techniques in agricultural
    contexts. Large efforts are currently poured to boost ICT use, at least in the
    EU, where this analysis is focused. On the one hand, the already established use
    of sensor nodes and heterogeneous data sources, as well as simple analytic techniques,
    is pushing DSSs in the farms; on the other hand, a growing need is there for ever
    advancing technology and open standards to consolidate existing scenarios in an
    interoperable and low-cost manner, as well as programmes to help ICT diffusion
    in areas suffering from digital divide. In the future, technology will have a
    growing role in agriculture [6]. Several operations will be automatised, from
    planting to harvesting, thanks to increased robotisation, both terrestrial and
    aerial one. Soil information will be readily available, thus allowing for e.g.
    a finer control of pests and pesticides, combining local information with other
    data sources, like weather and pollution data. In the end, an increase in production
    is expected, joint with a reduction in chemicals today in use, thus reducing pressure
    on soil. SF has the potential for a rapid and efficient growth in coming years,
    supported by policies that can fuel both R&D efforts and farmers’ adoption through
    investments. Anyway, the main barriers at today, i.e., vertical solutions, reduced
    digital skills and high costs for farmers, poor telecommunication infrastructures,
    and concerns on data ownership and use must be carefully addressed by technical
    and non-technical actors to facilitate SF adoption. Declaration of Competing Interest

  explanation: The main goal of this study is to develop a multimodal communication
    model for the agro-industry to integrate real-time farming production systems
    in a heterogeneous environment. The proposed model uses a distributed integration
    approach along the agricultural supply chain and utilizes the DDS specification
    standard by OMG that enables the communication between the different automation
    layers of agro-industry production plants. The study introduces a case study to
    describe and elaborate on the proposed communication model in the context of smart
    agriculture, particularly smart hydroponic systems. The case study includes a
    reference architecture, data model, and a discussion on how the proposed model
    can be implemented in a hydroponic system.

    Figures References Citations Keywords Metrics Abstract: The population would reach
    ten billion by 2050, and experts believe that the agricultural sector needs to
    boost production by 70% to satisfy the demand. Traditional farming practices rely
    on primitive technology that creates a yield gap with low productivity. A paradigm
    shift towards merging new technologies in the agriculture sector would enhance
    productivity, optimize cost, and encourage sustainable development. In this paper,
    we review the necessity for the fusion of the Fourth Industrial Revolution technological
    approach in the agricultural domain. We discuss the gap in supply chain management
    for the Industrial sector and Agricultural sector and identify the issues of vendor-specific
    production systems. We propose a multimodal communication model for the systematic
    integration of multi-vendor agricultural production systems. Our model utilizes
    the Data Distribution Service (DDS) middleware to enable communication between
    heterogeneous production systems to perform farming operations in a coordinated
    manner. Experimental work is conducted on a small-scale hydroponic farm to evaluate
    the system performance in terms of throughput, latency, and packet delivery ratio
    (PDR). The throughput for our proposed DDS system has significantly improved with
    the use of the BATCH QoS policy for payload size less than 1024 bytes. However,
    we incur an average latency of approximately 235 microseconds for any payload
    size. The value of PDR is 1 for any payload size ensuring our system to be reliable.
    The results suggest that our model can enable interoperability between multi-vendor
    production systems in real-time while incurring minimum latency. Proposed multimodal
    communication model in the agro-industry. Published in: IEEE Access ( Volume:

    predict population estimation to reach 10 billion by 2050 and 16.5 billion by
    2100. As a consequence, the demand for food would escalate; agricultural production
    needs to increase by 70% to sustain this population growth. Currently, agriculture
    produces around 80-85% of food globally, but only 5% of the world’s population
    works in agriculture. Agriculture accounts for approximately 70% of freshwater
    withdrawal and 90% of total water consumption worldwide. Moreover, urbanization
    leads to nutrition transition increasing processed food and meat consumption from
    36.4 kilograms to 45.3 kilograms per person in 2030 [1]–[6]. A significant challenge
    faced by the agricultural sector is coping with the indeterministic weather conditions,
    deteriorating soil conditions, and negative environmental impact by farming practices.
    This sector needs to adapt to new technologies for enhancing productivity and
    efficiency to meet the food requirement of the increasing population. The prospective
    of future agriculture would provide social benefits such as food security as well
    as environmental benefits [7]–[9]. Agricultural processes are mainly crop and
    animal production, but mixed farming is gaining popularity due to its added advantages.
    Mixed farming is a combination of both arable farming and pastoral farming that
    can conserve the nutrient cycle in agriculture [10], [11]. With the advent of
    emerging technologies, agricultural operations would need to move away from the
    traditional methods and adopt new technologies that increase yield and production,
    reduce resource and post-harvest waste, recycle bio-waste and increase bio-diversity
    [12]. Due to unpredictable weather patterns, reduced fertile land, and issues
    of agricultural infrastructure, we tend to move towards sustainable agriculture
    through the use of automation and digitization. The Fourth Industrial Revolution
    (Industry 4.0) [13], [14] will have a crucial influence on the agricultural domain
    to scale and commercialize production [5]. The first industrial revolution began
    in 1760 with the invention of steam engines. With the discovery of the internal
    combustion engine, the second industrial revolution started around 1900. Eventually,
    this led to mass production with the use of oil and electricity. In the 1960s,
    the third industrial revolution started and characterized by the use of a programmable
    logic controller (PLC) [15] and supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA)
    [16] systems to automate the manufacturing process. Hence industrial automation
    was first possible using electronics and information technology. The fourth industrial
    revolution, in 2011, transformed the industry integrating the cyber-physical system
    (CPS) [17], [18] and the Internet of Things (IoT) [19], [20] network to interconnect
    industrial production systems. Industry 4.0 provides greater versatility and more
    efficient resource allocation to optimize production and improve product life
    cycle [21]. Figure 1 outlines the industrial revolutions. FIGURE 1. Outline of
    industrial revolutions. Show All The foundational technologies [22] associated
    with the Industrial Revolution 4.0 are as follows: IoT and Industrial IoT (IIoT)
    Autonomous Robots Simulation System Integration - Vertical and Horizontal Additive
    Manufacturing Big Data and Analytics Cloud Computing Artificial Intelligence (AI)
    Augmented Reality Cybersecurity Drones Smart Sensors Many of the above technologies
    are not recent innovations, but the application in the agricultural domain is
    limited. The advantages of incorporating Industry 4.0 approaches are improved
    productivity with lower production risks, bulk data collection for analysis, greater
    control over internal processes, and cost-effective. The most vital aspect of
    production in the industrial sector is the supply chain management [23], [24].
    Therefore value creation in the agricultural domain must align with supply chain
    management. The uncertainty in farming supply chain management is due to the unpredictable
    weather and environmental (soil and nutrient dynamics) conditions [25]. This complexity
    in the agricultural domain makes experience-based heuristic methods appropriate.
    Existing approaches in farming supply chain use data-driven technologies such
    as precision agriculture to increase yield, reduce pest and disease infestation,
    and optimize resource usage. Other technologies, such as Bluetooth, Global Positioning
    System (GPS), and radio frequency identification (RFID), enable communication
    between machinery and systems to produce optimized, interconnected, and independent
    production systems. With Industry 4.0, we need to rethink the concept of supply
    chain and manage system integration. The main idea is the merging of the real-world
    environment and digitalized systems along whole agricultural supply chains. Emergent
    technologies, such as the IoT, Cloud Computing, Robotics, and AI, have the potential
    to progress to the next agricultural revolution [26]–[30]. Agriculture 4.0, that
    advanced from the Green Revolution (Third Agricultural Revolution) [31], uses
    system integration and coordination between farming activities. Agriculture 4.0
    will have to balance between demand-side and the supply chain value side of the
    food-scarcity equation, using technology to improve and address the real concerns
    of the value chain. The tools and machinery in the farming environment have advance
    embedded technology, which allows automation and real-time communication with
    interlinked production systems. The use of robotics, AI, cloud computing, and
    big data analytics would further boost overall productivity, improve sustainability,
    and reduce the yield gap. Nonetheless, planning and control can be inconvenient
    due to the high mobility of production plants and inconsistent communication.
    Agricultural activities can be sequential or parallel, thereby requiring a highly
    coordinated system. A crucial aspect in the area of supply chain management is
    the ability to coordinate activities. Industry 4.0 relies on the concept of independent
    CPSs to reliably communicate with each other and achieve a high level of coordination.
    Table 1 displays the design principles [32], [33] that govern the Industry 4.0.
    TABLE 1 Design Principles of Industry 4.0 The vision of Agriculture 4.0 is considerably
    limited to the application of precision farming and automation. This limitation
    is due to the use of distributed vendor-specific production systems in the agro-industry.
    The increased degree of complexity with heterogeneous production systems can render
    the agro-industry inoperable. We propose a multimodal communication model for
    the agro-industry to integrate these multi-vendor production systems. The objective
    of our research is to introduce a model that allows interoperability and adaptability
    between production systems in a heterogeneous environment in real-time. The rest
    of the paper is structured as follows: Section II reviews the literature survey
    comprising the approaches taken in agriculture and agro-industry. Related terminologies
    and their applications in the smart agricultural systems are highlighted in Section
    III. Section IV provides an overview of the real-time distributed systems and
    DDS model and architecture. Our proposed communication model is presented in Section
    V. Section VI describes the experimental work carried out for our study, followed
    by results discussion in section VII. Finally, in section VIII, the conclusion
    and future work are discussed. SECTION II. Literature Review Traditional agricultural
    methods are not adequate to meet the population demand. Due to the unpredictable
    weather and environmental conditions, farm producers are shifting towards Wireless
    Sensor Network (WSN) and IoT based smart farming systems to enhance productivity
    and efficiency while reducing negative impacts on the ecosystem. Several prominent
    studies have been carried out by various research groups in the agriculture domain
    [34], [35], and details of a few works have been presented in this section. Developments
    in the communication network infrastructures and technologies have led to the
    integration of modules in WSN that provide connectivity between nodes and change
    network topology from centralized to distributed infrastructure. The authors of
    [36] designed an automated variable rate irrigation system that allows remote
    monitoring and control of a site-specific irrigation system using a distributed
    wireless sensor network. The proposed system consists of an in-field sensing station
    that periodically monitors the environmental conditions, an irrigation control
    station that controls remote sprinkler head valves, and a base station that processes
    the data. In-field sensed data, along with data from weather stations, are transmitted
    to the base station wirelessly. The graphical user interface was developed for
    real-time monitoring and control and implemented using wireless in-field sensing
    and control (WISC) software, which was elaborated in [37]. The base station calculates
    the watering instructions based on the in-field data and sends control signals
    to the nozzle controller to automate the irrigation process. In [38], the authors
    presented an autonomous device to optimize water usage in agriculture using wireless
    sensor nodes with GPRS connectivity. The system design consists of an electronic
    board (main-board), sensor-board, and GPRS-board. The configuration information
    is loaded during bootup, and the main-board defines the sampling time, rate of
    transmission, server configurations, and GPRS settings. The crop and environmental
    data are collected by the external sensors, which are interfaced to the sensor-board
    and transmitted to a remote storage server via GPRS-board for further analysis.
    The system is implemented following a client-server architecture, which can serve
    as a bottleneck when the number of sensor nodes is increased. A computer-based
    vertical hydroponic system was developed by Rius-Ruiz et al. [39] that analyzes
    and calculates the optimum low-cost nutrient solution for tomato plants. The authors
    of [40] proposed a reliable control system to cultivate tomato plants hydroponically
    using a different frequency band on the IEEE standard protocol. Wireless sensor
    nodes measure the environmental parameters in real-time and send the aggregated
    data to the system via a gateway. Based on the temperature, light intensity, and
    humidity readings, the proposed hydroponic control system calculates evapotranspiration.
    If the value exceeds a certain threshold set by the user, then control signals
    are sent to the actuator system that controls the flow of nutrients. The authors
    believe their system to be fault-tolerant and acknowledge the existence of scalability
    issues. Nevertheless, both works do not track or automatically manage all the
    required parameters for agricultural production. Also, the system is not suitable
    for large size of data. There have been tremendous advances in sensing and network
    technologies that enable multiple sensors to connect and integrate for real-time
    management of the farm. For the development and implementation of IoT solutions,
    embedded devices like microcontrollers and single-board computers have been used.
    An automated IoT-based connected farm was introduced in [41] for growing and monitoring
    crops. The proposed system can integrate multiple farms which can support several
    IoT devices. The three main components are the physical devices, &Cube, and Mobius.
    The physical devices are the sensors and actuators that monitor and measure the
    environmental parameters. &Cube is the software platform deployed on the IoT gateway
    for enabling connectivity of devices to the connected farm. Mobius is an oneM2M
    compliant IoT service platform that facilitates the monitoring and controlling
    of the connected farm. Any IoT device can connect to Mobius via &Cube through
    registration. The users can monitor and access the farm data via web or mobile
    application using RESTful API interfaces implemented on the Mobius. The authors
    implemented the proposed farming system and mobile application to test the feasibility.
    Also, service scenarios are described to highlight the advantages of a connected
    farm. However, considering the heterogeneity of existing communication devices
    and protocols, it lacks versatility. The authors of [42] proposed a ubiquitous
    sensor network platform using IoT technologies to integrate heterogeneous machines,
    monitor and control crop growing systems for precision agriculture. The three
    elements of the proposed platform are Things, Local Gateway, and Network and Cloud.
    These elements are distributed into four layers and use the Message Queue Telemetry
    Transport (MQTT) protocol and RESTful API as the communication paradigm. Experimental
    work was conducted using embedded devices, such as Raspberry Pi, and sensor networks
    on a hydroponic station within a greenhouse. The authors concluded their system
    to be cost-effective and lower water usage. However, there is a lack of versatility
    in this proposed method, and the use of gateway could give rise to scalability
    issues. Kamruzzaman et al. [43] developed an IoT-based device for smart farming
    to monitor and control environmental factors that affect crop production. Sensors
    to measure soil and atmospheric conditions are interfaced with a microcontroller,
    and the aggregated data is transmitted to a remote server via a WiFi module. A
    data analysis and prediction algorithm called autoregressive integrated moving
    average (ARIMA) is implemented to predict future environmental conditions for
    better growth. The authors do not consider the integration of several heterogeneous
    IoT devices in the system. Also, it followed the client-server communication paradigm
    that can act as a bottleneck when more number of IoT devices are integrated into
    the system. IoT networks can consist of heterogeneous devices, and one key challenge
    is the interoperability between them. Recent research on sematic interoperability
    allows system integration using the Web of Things (WoT) [44], [45]. Touseau et
    al. presented ASAWoO [46], a WoT based middleware platform, to integrate heterogeneous
    cyber-physical objects using Avatars in a farming environment. It employs WoT
    technologies for interoperability between objects and uses opportunistic networking,
    an extension of the Delay-Tolerant Network (DTN), for connectivity between physical
    objects. The physical objects, controlled through Avatars [47], [48], monitor
    and manage environmental conditions at the farm. Avatars functionalities are implemented
    as REST services, which are invoked using Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) and
    Constrained Application Protocol (CoAP) application-level protocols. The authors
    validated the proposed platform by deploying it on single-board computers (Raspberry
    Pi) to act as physical objects on an experimental farm. The Avatars hide device
    heterogeneity, and the platform implemented as a loosely coupled client-server
    architecture ensures monitoring of the farming environment in real-time. Although
    this platform can be beneficial when there is no network infrastructure, numerous
    data exchanges and highly mobile objects can make it less efficient. The authors
    of [49] intorduced an IoT-based water management system for monitoring water consumption
    in real-time at smart agricultural farms. The system has microcontrollers integrated
    into the nodes and gateway for balancing between accuracy and energy efficiency.
    Detailed schematic diagrams of the components are presented as a design objective.
    The sensor nodes have external sensors interfaced to the microcontroller to measure
    the soil moisture, temperature, humidity, rain, and water level. The measured
    environmental data is sent to the cloud or mobile application via the gateway
    using LoRa and WiFi modules. The experiments conducted show the feasibility of
    the system in tunnel farming. The authors believe their system to be cost-effective,
    achieving higher productivity and flexibility to manage multiple independent farms.
    The authors did not address the data packet loss in the proposed application.
    Also, efficiency might reduce when more nodes are needed. Triantafyllou et al.
    [50] proposed a remote sensing reference architecture model that employs IoT and
    WSN technologies for monitoring smart farming systems. The model components are
    distributed similarly to the OSI Model into seven layers, namely Sensor Layer,
    Link Layer, Encapsulation Layer, Middleware Layer, Configuration Layer, Management
    Layer, and Application Layer. The sensors and smart embedded devices to measure
    and monitor environmental parameters reside in the Sensor Layer. The Link Layer
    composes the network and routing technologies between sensors for data transfers.
    The encapsulation of the in-field measured data takes place in the Encapsulation
    Layer to connect to the internet. The Middleware Layer interconnects heterogeneous
    IoT nodes or devices using application-level transport protocols. This layer is
    responsible for the interoperability of different devices and their underlying
    protocols. The Configuration Layer is responsible for data aggregation, organization,
    and publication as context information. The Management Layer processes and analyzes
    the collected data based on data mining or management methods. The application
    module for users resides in the Application Layer. The authors present a use case
    study based on the DIAS project to understand the proposed architecture model.
    However, this work did not consider the communication mechanism between the seven
    abstraction layers, and no real implementation was carried out and discussed.
    In [51], the authors proposed an autonomous sensor network to monitor and control
    irrigation systems for rural agriculture environments. The prototype developed
    is suitable for small or medium-sized farms. The system consists of sensor nodes,
    a coordinator node, and a cloud platform. The sensor nodes are microcontrollers
    (Arduino NANO) with external sensors, actuators, and the Zigbee module interfaced
    for communication. Environmental parameters such as temperature, light, humidity,
    and rain levels are measured and aggregated data sent to the coordinator node
    using Zigbee protocol for communication. The coordinator node consists of a microcontroller
    (Arduino Mega ADK), WiFi module (ESP8266), and Zigbee module. Local weather information
    can be accessed using the weather forecast API. The received sensor data is sent
    to the cloud platform using MQTT as the communication protocol. The users can
    visualize information and control the watering system remotely. The authors believe
    their system to be cost-effective with the capacity to self-charge. However, the
    authors did not perform in-field extensive experiments to validate system performance.
    The evolution of IoT in the agricultural sector will incorporate IoT technologies
    in different production systems to enable automation. With automation in farming
    operations and machinery, modern agriculture directs towards becoming more industrialized
    to fulfill future food production demands. The authors of [52] introduced Ipanera,
    an IoT-based platform to control water quality in a distributed aquaponics system
    using Industry 4.0 technologies. The system architecture consists of endpoints
    with adaptive fuzzy logic controllers, analytical and web servers, and an IoT
    cluster. The authors believe that their platform would integrate and adapt multiple
    soil-less food production systems to automate and control the water quality. However,
    the authors did not carry out any experimental work to validate their proposal.
    The stages of agricultural food production systems require a balance between the
    supply chain and the value chain. Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) technologies
    promote the automation of production systems and enable food traceability [53].
    Agricultural logistics interconnect producers and consumers to trace the whole
    production process [54]. Pang et al. [55] proposed an IoT-based value-centric
    framework to trace the food production supply chain. Sensor portfolios are derived
    from value creation, availability, and cost assessment analysis to track and monitor
    production logistics. The authors implemented a prototype to check the feasibility
    of their proposed system. However, the authors did not consider reliability and
    connectivity issues in WSN. Most of the existing research uses a centralized client-server
    communication pattern, which becomes a single point of failure. Also, the addition
    of more IoT devices can act as a bottleneck, degrading system performance. IoT
    systems are highly distributed, with the devices being characteristically heterogeneous.
    This heterogeneous nature gives rise to interoperability and connectivity issues.
    There is a lack of integration between heterogeneous systems that can make it
    inconvenient to expand businesses with different IoT devices. Integration of legacy
    proprietary systems into modern farming systems is difficult due to interoperability
    issues. These studies do not tackle the challenges of incorporating IIoT technologies
    in the agricultural domain, as mentioned in [56], [57]. Few works used the MQTT
    protocol, which follows a broker based publish-subscribe pattern. Although it
    solves the interoperability issues, the system suffers from centralization problems
    with a single point of failure reducing performance. Furthermore, none of the
    works in the literature consider the different Quality of Service (QoS) requirements
    of production systems. Therefore, from a careful examination of existing studies,
    we concluded that there is a requirement for a communication model to integrate
    multiple modular heterogeneous production systems. Our proposed model would enable
    horizontal and vertical integration of modules while ensuring reliability and
    versatility. Interoperability between systems would automate the production process
    enhancing productivity and efficiency. SECTION III. Related Terminologies Various
    techniques have been adopted by researchers and practitioners to enhance productivity
    and efficiency in agriculture. Related terminologies and approaches are discussed
    in details in this section. A. Internet of Things and Wireless Sensor Networks
    The authors of [58] proposed a context-aware middleware, that uses ontology model
    for context representation, to provide abstraction of the collected data from
    ubiquitous greenhouses and process or filter the data depending upon the services
    intended to be received by the user. For performance evaluation, the proposed
    middleware was integrated with the management system in the greenhouse. Soil and
    environmental sensors were deployed in the greenhouse as well as CCTVs were installed
    to acquire all the data produced from the greenhouse. The environmental parameters
    were controlled using ventilation system, irrigation system etc. that are in turn
    controlled through a PLC. The proposed system was tested by measuring CPU usage
    and response time and the authors believed it to be practical. Zamora-Izquierdo
    et al. [59] proposed and developed a platform that incorporates automation, IoT
    technologies, edge and cloud computing to monitor and manage the closed hydroponic
    system with recirculation using saline water. The proposed system architecture
    has been divided into three planes namely local CPS plane, edge plane and cloud
    plane. The CPS plane is responsible for atomic decisions taken by CPS nodes after
    it gathers data from sensors. The main precision agriculture tasks are managed
    in the edge plane where CPS nodes communicate using MQTT [60], [61] or CoAP [62],
    [63]. The cloud plane performs data storage and analysis. It maintains communication
    with the system using Next Generation Service Interface. The authors implement
    the proposed platform in a real greenhouse environment and conclude that their
    system is reliable and cost-effective in semi-arid conditions. The SheepIT project
    [64] was introduced to develop an IoT-based autonomous solution for monitoring
    and condition the sheep’s posture and location in vineyards. The details of the
    requirements of the SheepIT project was discussed in [65]. The system architecture
    composed of two modules namely WSN that included set of mobile nodes and beacons
    to perform local functions of the system and Computational Platform (CP) that
    provided data storage and data analysis for the user [66]. The proposed stack
    consisted of four layers (Physical Layer, MAC Layer, Transportation Layer and
    Application Layer) and are described in details in [67]. In [68], the authors
    reviewed the proposed stack and focused primarily on the design and development
    of the gateway connecting the two modules, WSN and CP. The gateway apart from
    forwarding data between the two modules support few real-time critical functions
    such as raising alarm in case of emergency, perform on-site administrative tasks
    and enabling technical interruptions. The performance of the gateway was evaluated
    in a real scenario and authors concluded the proposed system to be feasible and
    scalable. B. Machine Learning and Deep Neural Networks The adoption of artificial
    intelligence and machine learning techniques have enhanced productivity and eased
    the decision process in the agricultural industry. Machine learning algorithms
    and automatic classification techniques are more effective in the detection and
    monitoring of crops or livestock than manual methods. Seed classification is vital
    for seed harvesters to ensure the quality of the product. The research in [69],
    [70] proposes the use of machine learning and ant colony optimization algorithms,
    and data mining techniques to classify seeds more accurately. Frost events in
    farmland can be harmful for crops and can affect the production of goods [71].
    The peach project in [72] proposed using IoT technologies in predicting frost
    events in orchards. The authors deployed a low-power dense mesh network with sensors
    to collect data and predict the frost events. The authors of [73] extended this
    work by applying appropriate machine learning algorithms to predict the frost
    events with fewer errors and more sensitivity. There are three stages involved
    in predicting frost events and the authors mainly focused on the second stage
    which is training the frost-prediction engine using machine learning algorithms.
    They proposed to use Bayesian networks (BNs) [74] and random forest (RF) [75]
    for regression and logistic regression and binary trees for classification. The
    samples were generated using synthetic minority oversampling technique (SMOTE)
    [76]. Also, thermodynamic information of neighboring location has been used to
    improve the accuracy of the prediction. IoT based hydroponic system using Deep
    Neural Networks [77] proposed by Manav Mehra et al. implemented Deep Neural Network
    (DNN) at the edge for controlling the parameters of the hydroponic system and
    at the cloud for classifying the control action based on the parameters collected.
    Parameters such as pH, temperature, humidity, water level and light intensity
    are measured by sensors in real-time and sent to the microcontroller. The single-board
    computer acts as the edge where the DNN model is implemented and trained from
    the cloud based on the data set. The predicted output based on the DNN model is
    then communicated to the microcontroller for the appropriate action to be taken.
    A case study for the growth of tomato plant was conducted using the developed
    prototype and results showed an accuracy of 88.50%. Mark F. Hansen et al. [78]
    presented three face recognition techniques in order to identify the individual
    pigs on the farm. A webcam was placed on the drinker connected to a laptop to
    collect digital images of the pigs. The collected image data undergoes structural-similarity
    index measure (SSIM) [79] to remove similar data. The authors proposed using convolutional
    neural network and a fully connected layer for feature extraction and classification.
    The proposed algorithm identified pigs based on three regions namely snout and
    wrinkles above snout, marking on top of the head and eye regions. It was compared
    against Fisherfaces [80] with Euclidean distance and VGG-face pre-trained Convolutional
    Neural Network [81] with linear support vector machine (SVM) for face recognition.
    The authors concluded that their proposed algorithm is feasible and provides an
    accuracy of 96.7%. C. Drones The term “Internet of Drones (IoD)” was first coined
    in [82], presenting the conceptual architecture to tackle the drone airspace management
    problem along with defining new terminologies and goals of the proposed model.
    Nayyar et al. [83] introduced the concept of the Internet of Drone Things (IoDT),
    including the associated technologies, challenges, and applications. The authors
    also highlighted some real-time implementations in smart agriculture and smart
    city domains. In [84], the authors presented an end-to-end IoT platform for precision
    agriculture with the help of sensors and drones. The proposed platform ensures
    connectivity and availability even during power and Internet outages. The system
    architecture consisted of four modules namely sensors and drones, IoT base station,
    IoT gateway and cloud service. The authors proposed a weather-aware IoT base station
    that ran on solar energy and the different components are duty cycled based on
    the weather forecast and charge state of the batteries. The IoT gateway provided
    local functions in the farm and also summarized the collected data to be uploaded
    to the cloud. The authors also incorporated a path planning algorithm and yaw
    control algorithm for the drone to optimize the energy consumption and extend
    the battery life of the drones. In addition, the generation of the precision map
    from drone and sensor data have been implemented. The proposed system was deployed
    in two farms and each components have been evaluated in terms of power, time and
    accuracy. In [85], the authors discuss the use of AR drones for irrigation in
    the agricultural domain and propose to implement Optimized Link State Routing
    Protocol (OLSR) [86], [87] to route the information between devices in an ad hoc
    network. To enhance the video sensing and transmission quality, they integrated
    Real Time Streaming Protocol (RTSP) [88] and Real-time Transport Protocol (RTP)
    [89], [90] protocols in the system. In another variation [91], the authors propose
    using multiple AR drones forming mobile ad hoc network (MANET) for intelligent
    video sensing to deploy herbicide sprayer based on a geo-reference system. They
    believe the system can save the amount of herbicide used, and the quality of the
    crop is improved. A distributed swarm control algorithm was proposed in [92] to
    allow control of multiple Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) systems used for agricultural
    purposes. A single operator can remotely control the multi-UAV system using control
    inputs such as velocity control, formation control, and collision avoidance control.
    The system has two layers, the UAV control layer that manages the formation of
    multiple UAVs and the teleoperation layer that controls the motion and velocity
    of the UAVs. The authors implemented the proposed algorithm using a robot operating
    system and Gazebo to validate and evaluate the control algorithm. They concluded
    that the proposed distributed control algorithm is more efficient than a single
    UAV system. The added advantage of utilizing DDS middleware for communication
    between multiple UAV systems are presented and discussed in [93], [94]. D. Cyber
    Security An attacker can discover new methods to infiltrate the IoT based farming
    systems, raising new security and privacy concerns that require better security
    mechanisms to tackle the issues in communication [95]. To protect against false
    data injection attacks, the authors of [96] proposed a Lightweight Privacy-preserving
    Data Aggregation (LPDA) system to aggregate fog-computing data from hybrid IoT
    devices at the network edge by applying homomorphic Paillier encryption [97],
    Chinese Remainder Theorem, and one-way hash chain. Security analysis using differential
    privacy techniques [98], [99] implied the proposed scheme to resist against differential
    attacks. The proposed technique was evaluated against Aggregation with the Basic
    Paillier Encryption (AggBPE) in terms of communication overhead and computational
    cost, and the experimental results indicated it to be lightweight for fog-computing
    nodes. The use of RFID technology in agriculture is growing significantly, from
    monitoring and tracking cattle to use in food traceability systems [100], [101].
    Due to privacy and security concerns, the authors of [102] introduced an anonymous
    lightweight RFID authentication system for distributed IoT environments using
    hash functions. The proposed system architecture included an authenticated cloud
    server, a back-end database server for each RFID network, and clusters containing
    readers and RFID-tags. The proposed authentication scheme had three phases and
    used hash functions. Although false data injection and distributed denial-of-service
    attack (DDoS) attacks are not considered, the proposed system can protect against
    cloning attacks, replay attacks, forgery attacks, and location tracking attacks
    as described in functional and security analysis. In [103], the authors introduced
    a security model to allow secured data communication independent of the network
    infrastructure using symmetric and asymmetric cryptographic algorithms, digital
    signature, digital envelope, and public key infrastructure (PKI). The authors
    believe their proposed scheme can ensure data security but consume more energy
    due to the inclusion of authentication overhead. E. Autonomous Technologies Automation
    technologies in the agricultural industry have made farms more productive and
    automate the production cycle of crops or livestock. With the development of autonomous
    vehicles, farming operations need to consider the entire production system to
    enable a high degree of automation. While these innovations are recent, a growing
    number of agricultural businesses have been implementing field automation in their
    industrial processes. The EU-project CROPS [104] developed a modular and reconfigurable
    agricultural robot to perform agricultural tasks such as monitoring, spraying,
    and harvesting. In [105], the authors studied the detection of powdery mildew
    in grape vineyards and the application of pesticides to control the disease using
    the robot developed by CROPS. The proposed system automatically identified the
    disease and applied spray while reducing the amount of pesticide used. The authors
    introduced an autonomous Agricultural Robot (AgBot) System [106] that can detect
    weeds using Haar feature-based cascade classification and spray a controlled amount
    of herbicide or fertilizers while navigating using GPS. In [107], the authors
    proposed a solution for the connection between the autonomous vehicle and spray
    management system to perform spraying operations autonomously in the field. The
    architecture comprised of four subsystems, namely, mobile tracking robot, localization
    and navigation system, smart spraying system, and human-machine interface (HMI)
    system. The performance of the system was evaluated in the greenhouse and vineyard
    scenario, and results indicated that the autonomous vehicle followed the desired
    trajectory. The authors believe their proposed system can expand by incorporating
    other applications using this approach. Other automation advances in greenhouse
    technology and controlled environment agriculture (CEA) are discussed in detail
    in [108]. Most of the research implements Industry 4.0 technologies in their systems
    to enhance productivity or reduce cost without taking into account the possibility
    of heterogeneous vendor-specific production systems. The communication between
    these production systems needs to be homogeneous. Hence we tend to propose a communication
    model that will integrate these production systems. The proposed model relies
    on DDS middleware [109] discussed in the following sections. SECTION IV. Background
    A. Real-Time Distributed Systems A distributed system is a group of autonomous
    devices that interact and coordinate through a network. The integration approaches
    shown in figure 2 for a distributed system are as follows: Point-to-point (application-centric)
    Centralized Distributed (data-centric) FIGURE 2. Integration approaches for distributed
    systems. Show All The point-to-point approach is tightly-coupled with high life-cycle
    costs, difficult to maintain, poor information sharing, and robustness. Centralized
    integration relies on the broker hence resulting in low scalability and performance
    with a single point of failure. On the other hand, the distributed integration
    approach has high throughput with low latency, high scalability, high reliability,
    integration logic is vendor-independent, robust, and high availability. Due to
    these advantages, DDS follows a distributed integration approach. Real-time systems
    are time-constrained systems where expected response time can be assured. Their
    classification is of three types, which are explained as follows with the help
    of figure 3. In figure 3, e 1 and e 2 represents two consecutive events in time.
    Hard Real-Time: The timing constraint is defined as a point of time i.e. t( e
    1 )=t( e 2 ) . Soft Real-Time: The timing constraint is defined as a window of
    time i.e t( e 1 )<t<t( e 2 ) . Acceptable time window but can be flexible by few
    seconds. Firm Real-Time: The timing constraint is defined as a strict window of
    time i.e t( e 1 )<t<t( e 2 ) . Time window is strict and delays are not acceptable.
    FIGURE 3. Timing constraint diagram for real-time systems. Show All B. Data Distribution
    Service The Object Management Group (OMG) introduced DDS in 2004, an open data-centric
    standard, to address the communication challenges of real-time mission-critical
    applications with the issue of scalability in mind [110]. This specification standard
    intends to integrate heterogeneous systems enabling interoperability and portability.
    The purpose of the DDS specification is to allow the sharing of information efficiently
    in a distributed environment masking the underlying complexities [111]–[113].
    The specification standard is composed of the DDS application programming interface
    (API) and Data Distribution Service Interoperability (DDSI) wire protocol. There
    are two interface levels specified in the DDS API standard, namely Data-Centric
    Publish-Subscribe (DCPS) and Data Local Reconstruction Layer (DLRL). The lower
    DCPS layer deals with topic-based data dissemination using the publish-subscribe
    paradigm. This layer aims to provide an efficient delivery mechanism between the
    Publishers and Subscribers. The higher layer, DLRL, is responsible for allowing
    the integration of DCPS components into the application. This layer is optional
    and helps application developers to create an object model above the DCPS layer
    hiding the underlying DCPS information. Real-Time Publish Subscribe (RTPS) is
    the standard DDSI wire protocol that ensures interoperability between the various
    implementations of the DDS standard [114]–[116]. DDS also encompasses a rich set
    of QoS policies that control the communication behavior and properties of information.
    The model of DDS relies on the concept of a fully distributed Global Data Space
    (GDS) in which participants can either publish or subscribe to data. Due to the
    decentralized implementation of GDS, there is no single point of failure or bottleneck
    that might degrade the performance. A domain is a single GDS instance uniquely
    identified by domain ID. As shown in figure 4, the DDS Entities belonging to a
    particular DDS domain are as follows: Domain Participant: It represents the joining
    of an application to a specific domain. A single application can join multiple
    domains by creating multiple domain participants with different domain IDs. DDS
    Entities are contained and managed by the domain participant. Topic: Topic is
    defined as a 3-tuple Entity composed of a unique name, type, and QoS parameter.
    It is associated with a unique key to distinguish a topic instance. Samples are
    updates of topic instances that are produced or consumed by the Publisher or Subscriber,
    respectively. Topic types can be specified using Interface Definition Language
    (IDL), eXtensible Markup Language (XML), Unified Modeling Language (UML), or annotated
    Java. DataWriter: This Entity generates samples of one or more instances of a
    topic with a given QoS. It is associated with the Publisher to write data to the
    GDS. A single DataWriter is owned and managed by one Publisher only. DataReader:
    It consumes samples of one or more instances of a topic with a given QoS. It is
    associated with the Subscriber to read data from the GDS. A DataReader can store
    multiple samples in the cache based on the QoS setting. A single DataReader is
    owned and managed by one Subscriber only. Publisher: The Publisher is the Entity
    that is responsible for publishing data with a given QoS. It can send data for
    several different topics with different data types. Multiple DataWriters are owned
    and managed by a single Publisher. Subscriber: This Entity is responsible for
    receiving the published data in the GDS with matches QoS. It can read data for
    numerous different topics with different data types. Multiple DataReaders are
    owned and managed by a single Subscriber. FIGURE 4. Architectural representation
    of data distribution service model. Show All Domain participant nodes in the GDS
    are either a Publisher, Subscriber, or both. A Publisher encloses one or more
    DataWriters, whereas a Subscriber contains one or more DataReaders. These DataWriters
    and DataReaders will be automatically discovered and matched to other participants
    with similar properties establishing connections. Adaptive connectivity enables
    a Publisher or Subscriber to join or leave the DDS domain at any given time. Active
    participants in the GDS are discovered by the Participant Discovery Protocol (PDP)
    that exchange information and establish endpoints using the Endpoint Discovery
    Protocol (EDP) [117]. The communication behavior of the system relies on a set
    of configurable parameters specified in the QoS policies, as shown in Table 2.
    Each policy governs a particular aspect of Entity behavior, which can be configured
    using QoS parameters to ensure reliable and efficient communication. Due to the
    fully distributed nature of DDS, the standard offers incredibly high levels of
    efficient abstractions to create and integrate distributed modular systems on
    a large scale. Therefore, we tend to utilize the concept of DDS in the agricultural
    domain. TABLE 2 Quality of Service Policies Governing Data Distribution Service
    Behavior SECTION V. Proposed Model In our study, we introduce a novel multimodal
    communication model to integrate real-time farming production systems in a heterogeneous
    environment. The proposed model uses a distributed integration approach along
    the agricultural supply chain. Our model uses the DDS specification standard by
    OMG that enables the communication between the different automation layers of
    agro-industry production plants. Figure 5 depicts the proposed multimodal communication
    model that is tailored to the requirements of the agro-industry. The automation
    levels along with the tasks are discussed below: Level 0: This automation level
    (field-level) consists of sensors and actuators to accumulate data from the environment
    and perform an action respectively. Typical examples of sensors can be a temperature
    sensor, humidity sensor, soil moisture sensor, electric conductivity sensor, pH
    sensor, light sensor, thermal sensor, solar radiation sensor, barometric pressure
    sensor, carbon dioxide sensor, dissolved oxygen sensor, macro-mineral sensor,
    wind speed and direction sensor, air-quality sensor, RFID tags, weight sensors,
    etc. Actuators can be sprayers, linear actuators such as stepper motors, spreader
    actuators to spread fertilizers and pesticides, electric motors, hydraulics. Level
    1: Control level where machines have PLC, or proportional–integral–derivative
    (PID) integrated into them. In a typical factory environment, this could be a
    single production line. In our case, a single Zone Controller (ZC) is placed within
    a farming zone to control and perform a particular function. For example, a ZC
    used to control the temperature in a greenhouse farm. Level 2: This supervisory
    (process control) level functions to synchronize and control all machines or production
    lines in an integrated manner. A process management system, such as SCADA, is
    used to monitor and control multiple systems in real-time. The Farm Controller
    (FC) is used to gather data for analysis, monitor, and control in an automated
    manner. FC can manage multiple ZCs with the help of a graphical user interface
    (GUI) or Human-Machine Interface (HMI) remotely. Level 3: This Production Planning
    and Control level (PPC) comprises the manufacturing execution system (MES) that
    serves to control the planning and operations of the entire plant from raw materials
    to the finished product in real-time. PPC manages multiple FCs to work in a coordinated
    manner to achieve the target. Data gathered from lower levels are analyzed and
    help the actors for the decision-making process. This planning level ensures optimized
    productivity and cost by adjusting the system in real-time. An example in the
    agro-industry would be the management of multiple hydroponic farms that harvest
    different food products. Each product might need different environmental conditions
    to cultivate. Therefore PCC controls the activities related to only production
    of the intended product. Level 4: Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) level is
    the management level in the industrial plant. The role of ERP is to maintain overall
    production planning via the ERP system. It deals with product life cycle management,
    supply chain management, and warehouse management, etc. ERP controls all activities,
    from production to distribution and consumption. FIGURE 5. Proposed multimodal
    communication model in the agro-industry. Show All As discussed above, all the
    levels have distinct functions to be carried out along the supply chain. A high
    level of coordination might be necessary between each level to enhance productivity
    and quality, reduce the production cost, and to ensure sustainable production.
    Synchronization and integration are significant between automation levels to reduce
    the yield gap. Therefore, interoperability between modular production systems
    is of great importance. We propose to implement DDS middleware to enable the communication
    between these production systems in different automation levels. The production
    systems would act as Publishers or/and Subscribers. The integration of DDS middleware
    would make the system more flexible and adaptable to changes in real-time. Another
    advantage of using DDS middleware is the availability of a rich set of QoS policies
    that govern the communication between the systems. These QoS policies would impact
    the overall performance of the system and ensure efficient resource usage. A.
    Case Study Illustration for the Employment of the Proposed Communication Model
    in Hydroponic Systems We represent a case study to describe and elaborate on the
    proposed communication model in the context of smart agriculture. Nowadays, farm
    producers are shifting towards hydroponic systems. Hydroponic systems have more
    efficient water utilization with an increase in production confined in a limited
    dense space. Also, crops are grown faster in a well-controlled hydroponic system.
    These systems provide an opportunity to cultivate crops in an unfavorable environment.
    Therefore, we consider a smart hydroponic system to discuss our case study. Figure
    6 illustrates the reference architecture for our case study. The hydroponic system
    components consist of several subsystems, sensors to measure the crop and environmental
    conditions, and actuators to control the environmental parameters. Each subsystem
    in the hydroponic system performs a particular function. For example, the circulation
    system monitors and controls the liquid flow in the system. Farming operations
    require multiple subsystems to integrate and coordinate among themselves. The
    lighting system, ventilation system, and irrigation system need harmonization
    to utilize water efficiently. Sensors are used to measure the temperature, humidity,
    light intensity, pH, nutrient level in the reservoir, electric conductivity, water
    quality, total dissolved salts (TDS), and carbon dioxide of the system. The sensor
    types, models, and their usages are shown in Table 3. The subsystems receive data
    from the sensors, check against a predefined threshold, and send control signals
    to the actuators. The actuators receive the control signals and execute commands
    to switch on or off the ventilation fan, submersible pump, or window linear actuator
    to reserve water. TABLE 3 Sensor Types, Models and Their Usages in Our Case Study
    FIGURE 6. Reference architecture of the smart hydroponic farm case study. Show
    All Smart agriculture, more precisely smart hydroponic systems, are information-intensive
    systems that may have strict QoS requirements. Our proposed model follows a data-centric
    approach, and the isolation of individual components adds modularity to the system.
    Based on the reference architecture, we define our data model for the smart hydroponic
    system. We map the defined data model to the DDS domain, data types, and topics.
    The elements of the system are domain participant nodes that join or leave multiple
    DDS domains. These nodes can act as Publishers, Subscribers, or both. Each node
    can distinctly define information as topics. The updates of the topic instances,
    known as data samples, are exchanged between them. All communication between the
    components of the system is through the middleware. The auto-discovery mechanism
    of DDS middleware would allow any component to join or leave the DDS domain at
    any time. Therefore, integrating two or more components to coordinate and perform
    a particular operation is simple without the need for centralized control. The
    architecture, shown in figure 6, consists of six subsystems, nine sensors, and
    three actuators. The sensors are the Publishers that publish environmental conditions
    to the GDS. The subsystems act as both Publishers and Subscribers where it subscribes
    to the sensed data and publishes control data. The actuators are the Subscribers
    of the control data. In the perspective of our proposed multimodal communication
    model, we categorize the automation levels in an agro-industry environment. At
    level 0, the sensors and actuators exist to measure and control the local farming
    processes. The Zone Controllers (ZCs), at level 1, monitor the data and send control
    instructions to the actuators. Typical ZCs are the subsystems that manage the
    functions in a single farming zone. Microcontrollers connected to sensors and
    actuators can function as ZCs. At level 2, the Farm Controllers (FCs) regulate
    multiple subsystems to work in a coordinated manner. It receives the aggregated
    data from the ZCs and analyzes it for better decision making regarding the whole
    production process on a single farm. Single-board computers such as Raspberry
    Pi or BeagleBoard can function as FCs. At level 3, PPC operates multiple farms
    to ensure optimized productivity and cost by adjusting the system in real-time.
    ERP, level 4, maintains the overall production planning along the whole supply
    chain. With regards to the reference architecture, the subsystems make up the
    ZCs. The sensors and actuators connect to the ZCs. The FCs operate several ZCs
    to automate the hydroponic production. All communications within a single hydroponic
    plantation follow a publish-subscribe pattern using DDS middleware, ensuring modularity
    and reliability. SECTION VI. Experimental Work For our experimental work, we used
    single-board computers as FCs to set up on a small scale hydroponic farm. The
    dimensions of the hydroponic system are 10m long and 1m wide. Figure 7 and 8 exhibits
    the interior of the farm. The farm had five polyvinyl-chloride (PVC) pipes with
    hollows made for pots with Rockwool, a reservoir with a submersible pump, and
    a ventilation fan. The water flowed from the top to the bottom pipeline using
    the pump in a closed recirculation. The system components are the sensors, actuators,
    ZCs, and FCs. Sensors, such as temperature sensors, humidity sensors, and ultrasonic
    sensors, are used to measure and sense the environment. A submersible water pump
    and ventilation fan are the actuators of the hydroponic system. Figure 1 presents
    the schematic circuit diagram of the ZC. The sensors, actuators, and the WiFi
    module are interfaced to it, as seen in the figure. The ZCs transmit the aggregated
    data to the FCs, which in this scenario are the single-board computers. The FC
    target machines were Raspberry Pi 3 Model B+, and we checked the feasibility and
    performance of the proposed system against a system that uses plain sockets. The
    ZCs and FCs would act as both Publisher and Subscriber and communicate via DDS
    middleware. The purpose of the experiment was to analyze the system performance
    using DDS standard middleware for data communication. FIGURE 7. Small-scale hydroponic
    farm (front view). Show All FIGURE 8. Small-scale hydroponic farm (back view).
    Show All Assuming the channel is error-free, we will evaluate the system in terms
    of throughput, average latency, and packet delivery ratio (PDR) as performance
    metrics. The QoS policies used for our research are as follows: RELIABILITY: This
    policy indicates the extent of reliability the system can provide or receive.
    There are two kinds, RELIABLE or BEST_EFFORT. For RELIABLE kind, the Publisher
    will continue sending data until all the data is completely received by the Subscriber.
    For BEST_EFFORT, the Publisher will not resend data in case of failure. HISTORY:
    Defines how the system will buffer data and send data gradually. KEEP_LAST and
    KEEP_ALL with depth as optional are the two kinds. KEEP_ALL kind stores all the
    data in the buffer, whereas KEEP_LAST stores the latest data with depth=1 as the
    default values. DURABILITY: Specifies how long the data can exist after being
    written. There are four kinds, namely VOLATILE, TRANSIENT, TRANSIENT_LOCAL, and
    PERSISTENT. VOLATILE indicates that no samples of data are kept. TRANSIENT means
    data is stored in memory. TRANSIENT_LOCAL keeps data in local memory and is associated
    with the DataWriter. For PERSISTENT, data is kept on permanent storage. PRESENTATION:
    Two Boolean, coherent_access and ordered_access, control how the data is represented
    to the Subscriber. Coherent_access if true represents the set of changes as a
    unit to the Subscriber. Ordered_access represents the changes in order as occurred
    in the Publisher. RESOURCE_LIMITS: This policy states the amount of resources
    that can be consumed. It is defined by the integer variable max_samples and max_samples_per_
    instance. The default value is set to LENGTH_ UNLIMITED. Table 4 denotes the parameter
    values set for each QoS policy for our experimental work. We run the hydroponic
    system for two weeks to collect and model the network traffic of the system. We
    use D-ITG (Distributed Internet Traffic Generator) [118] to generate the modeled
    network traffic. We vary the payload size (data sample size) in bytes for the
    system and measure the throughput, average latency, and PDR with and without DDS
    middleware. Another extended QoS policy feature of DDS is BATCH to reduce transmission
    overhead associated with reliable communication. We examine the effect of batching
    on the throughput of the system. TABLE 4 QoS Policy Parameters Defined for the
    Experimental Work SECTION VII. Results and Discussion In this section, we discuss
    the performance results of our experimental work. Our research aims to measure
    the system performance with DDS middleware integrated for reliable communication
    between production systems in a heterogeneous environment. We compare these results
    with the system with no DDS implemented, i.e., communication via UDPv4 sockets.
    Furthermore, we observe the effect of batching on the throughput. The throughput
    is measured by the average rate of successful data messages delivered in a given
    time. Figure 10 presents the throughput graph against varying payload sizes for
    our proposed DDS system and system without DDS middleware (UDPv4 sockets). There
    is a linear increase in throughput for packet size more than 32 bytes until it
    saturates at 8192 bytes, as seen in the figure. For payload size greater than
    8192 bytes, the throughout saturates around 95 Mbps for both systems. The maximum
    bandwidth supported by the network interface controller (NIC) of FCs is 100 Mbps.
    Therefore, the throughput increases with an increase in payload sizes until it
    reaches maximum network utilization at around 95% for both systems. FIGURE 9.
    Schematic circuit diagram of the Zone Controller (ZC). Show All FIGURE 10. The
    figure presents the throughput of the proposed DDS system compared against system
    without DDS implemented with varying payload size. Show All Referring to [36],
    [38], we will look more closely at throughput results for payload size between
    32 and 1024 bytes. Table 5 exhibits the throughput results obtained from the experimental
    work. From figure 11, we can view the graphical representation of the throughput
    results. The system using DDS middleware and no BATCH QoS policy for communication
    has a linear increase in throughput. However, a system using plain sockets performs
    better than using DDS middleware. The gap between the throughput values of both
    systems increases with increasing payload size. The difference in the throughput
    values is highest at 512 bytes. A significant improvement in the throughput is
    observed with the use of the BATCH QoS policy. Batching aggregates the data samples
    into a single data packet specified by the batch size parameter. When packet size
    is less than 1024 bytes, the throughput of our proposed system with BATCH QoS
    policy is higher. Therefore, using our proposed model for communication would
    be more efficient. TABLE 5 Throughput Values Attained From the Experimental Works
    FIGURE 11. The figure shows the throughput of the proposed DDS system compared
    against system without implementation of DDS and the use of BATCH QoS policy.
    Show All Average latency denotes the time required by the data samples to reach
    the Subscriber from the Publisher. Table 6 presents the average latency values
    in microseconds incurred by the system. Figure 12 graphically illustrates the
    average latency values attained for varying payload sizes. The average latency
    increases linearly with increasing payload size. We can observe that our proposed
    DDS system has suffered higher average latency than the system using plain sockets
    for communication for any payload size. The difference in the average latency
    values of the two systems is constant for varying payload sizes. The added average
    latency for using DDS middleware to communicate between systems is approximately
    235 microseconds. This added latency is due to the inclusion of additional logic
    to send or receive data through the DDS middleware. Although the application of
    batching increases throughput, the system incurs a minimum latency of 235 microseconds.
    TABLE 6 Latency Values Achieved From the Experimental Works FIGURE 12. The figure
    displays the latency of the proposed DDS system compared against system without
    implementation of DDS. Show All PDR indicates a ratio of the total number of received
    data to the total number of sent data. PDR equals one if all the data is received
    by the Subscriber successfully. PDR less than one indicates lost or dropped packets
    in the system. Table 7 shows the calculated PDR values for both systems. The graph
    in figure 13 displays the PDR values for varying payload sizes. For our proposed
    model, PDR values remain 1 for any payload size. The system using sockets has
    PDR less than 1 for packet sizes 128, 256, and 1024 bytes. The highest number
    of packets lost is when the payload size was 256 bytes resulting in a PDR value
    of 0.97. PDR values for a system with no DDS implemented (UDPv4 sockets) are less
    than 1 when payload sizes are more than 128 bytes indicating dropped data packets.
    Hence system using DDS middleware for communication ensures reliability. TABLE

    Conclusion The incorporation of Industry 4.0 technologies in the agricultural
    domain will transform the agro-industry significantly. The adoption of new technologies
    and strategies will enhance productivity and reduce the yield gap to satisfy the
    market demand of the growing population. Agriculture 4.0 approaches can tackle
    the challenges of agricultural supply chain management, but managing production,
    planning, and control are difficult due to the high mobility of production systems.
    Production systems use a distributed integration approach due to its advantages
    such as resource sharing, scalability, fault tolerance, etc. Nevertheless, manageability
    and system integration can be highly complex if the modular production systems
    are heterogeneous. We propose a multimodal communication model that utilizes DDS
    middleware to integrate production systems for interoperability between multi-vendor
    production lines. The research conducted suggests that DDS integrated systems
    can reliably communicate with each other in real-time, but incur additional latency
    due to the discovery mechanism. Furthermore, the throughput of the DDS integrated
    system improves with the use of batching. Based on our findings, our recommendation
    would be to design and integrate production systems with DDS middleware to reach
    maximum network throughput with minimum expected latency ensuring reliability.
    Future Scope The Green Revolution was directed towards sustainable development
    in the agricultural sector with the support of global policy-makers. Modern farming
    practices that use AI, big data analysis, robotics, and machine learning plays
    a vital role in the advancement of Agriculture 4.0 to increase the productivity
    and eco-efficiency of agricultural value creation. For future work, we tend to
    analyze how tuning the QoS policies might affect the performance in a large-scale
    farm while considering the energy consumption. We aim to develop an ad-hoc printed
    circuit board (PCB) of the Zone Controller for minimizing the total cost of deployment.
    Also, we will consider studying the security aspects of the integration of DDS
    middleware in production systems. Additionally, employing machine learning algorithms
    in agricultural supply chains and the adoption of 5G technologies can be considered
    for future work. ACKNOWLEDGMENT The authors would like to thank the unwavering

    \ justiﬁes the incorporation and\nadaptation of the latest technologies. Nowadays,\
    \ managing crops is possible through Internet-based\ntechnologies. Their application\
    \ allows for the exploitation of information and the development of\nisolated\
    \ applications, which, although powerful, create challenges for obtaining scalable\
    \ predictions\nthroughout the useful life of farms. To address this problem, a\
    \ data model was deﬁned to improve\nthe management of crop plots in irrigation\
    \ communities and simultaneously monitor crop needs.\nConsequently, the objective\
    \ of this study was to create an open and interoperable platform based on\nstandard\
    \ interfaces and protocols to enable the integration of heterogeneous sources\
    \ of information,\nwhile ensuring interoperability with other third-party solutions\
    \ for exchanging and exploiting such\ninformation. Standard and open interfaces\
    \ and protocols form the basis of the platform, thereby\nunifying all information\
    \ in a single data model, which facilitates the better use and dissemination of\n\
    information. The system was fully instantiated in a real prototype in an irrigation\
    \ community; the\nsoftware improved water irrigation management for the farmers\
    \ connected to the platform.\nKeywords: IoT platform; data model; smart agriculture;\

    1. Introduction\nSociety is characterized by uncertainty and constant technological\
    \ changes. The productive sectors\nthat are more digitized tend to improve their\
    \ productivity faster than those that are less digitized.\nIrrigation farming\
    \ communities have beneﬁted for many years from the use of information and\ncommunications\
    \ technology (ICT), which allows them to improve the current agricultural development,\n\
    facilitate the fulﬁllment of daily tasks, and convert farms into efﬁcient and\
    \ sustainable production\nsystems. The use of these new technologies not only\
    \ enables the digital transformation process\ndemanded by the sector, but also\
    \ supports irrigation communities and other farming groups with tools\nfor analysis\
    \ and prediction, improving optimization.\nThe digital transformation and continuous\
    \ technological advances that are currently occurring,\ne.g., the Internet of\
    \ Things (IoT) [1], big data, cloud computing [2], artiﬁcial intelligence, and\
    \ aerial\nimages [3] to name a few, are providing the agricultural sector with\
    \ new tools that help determine\nthe real needs of farms and improve their efﬁciency.\
    \ Speciﬁcally, the use of the IoT has changed the\nSensors 2020, 20, 1153; doi:10.3390/s20041153\n\
    www.mdpi.com/journal/sensors\nSensors 2020, 20, 1153\n2 of 20\ntraditional paradigm\
    \ regarding access to and the management of sensors and actuators, making\nall\
    \ objects accessible through the Internet, and transferring the management and\
    \ integration of\ninformation and real knowledge into the digital world [4].\n\
    This transformation has produced\nimprovements compared to the techniques traditionally\
    \ used [5], allowing new mechanisms to help in\nthe management of farms. These\
    \ advantages are mainly focused on the following:\n•\nProblem detection: The implementation\
    \ of new technologies such as satellite images, variable\napplication algorithms,\
    \ drones, high-tech sensors, mobile applications, and GPS guides, allowing\nfor\
    \ the assessment of crop status and the detection of problems (improper fertilizer\
    \ use, water\nstress, changing weather conditions, and pest monitoring) before\
    \ they start to interfere with\ncrop performance;\n•\nProductivity improvement:\
    \ The sensorization of crops allows for the establishment of patterns of\nplanting\
    \ and fertilization depending on factors such as the type of seeds and soil conditions,\
    \ to\nimprove crop production levels;\n•\nImprovement in decision making: By analyzing\
    \ and monitoring agronomic parameters, crop water\nneeds, and precipitation forecasts,\
    \ it is possible to identify which areas of land need more water\nand schedule\
    \ irrigation to vary the volume of water applied without imposing water stress\
    \ on\nthe crop;\n•\nBehaviour analysis: As a result of continuous crop monitoring\
    \ and the analysis of the relationships\namong different elements, such as yield,\
    \ energy efﬁciency, and the agricultural practices used, the\nmost beneﬁcial actions\
    \ and those that must be eliminated or modiﬁed can be identiﬁed.\nMotivated by\
    \ the digital transformation, the agricultural sector is providing its farms with\
    \ new\ndevices and services (sensors, actuators, weather information, drones,\
    \ and satellite images) that allow\nfor the optimization of the resources, to\
    \ improve productivity and simultaneously reduce the impact\non the environment.\
    \ For the digital transformation of the agricultural sector, a common integration\n\
    framework is needed that uniﬁes the entire dataset, so that new services are generated\
    \ according to\nthe needs of the sector. The data generated by the farms are crucial\
    \ and have to be part of a unique\nsemantic model that organizes and evaluates\
    \ all the data collected.\nAt the European level, an open initiative, FIWARE [6],\
    \ offers a framework using a set of standard\nand open Application Programming\
    \ Interfaces (APIs) based on Next Generation Service Interface\n(NGSI), promoted\
    \ by the Open Mobile Alliance (OMA), or Next Generation Service Interfaces\nwith\
    \ Linked Data (NGSI-LD) [7], promoted by ETSI Industry Speciﬁcation Group for\
    \ Context\nInformation Management (ETSI ISG CIM), to deﬁne a universal set of\
    \ standards based on the contextual\nmanagement of the data. Therefore, adhering\
    \ the standards and abandoning the code and proprietary\ntechnologies can contribute\
    \ to improving the competitiveness of the agricultural sector. In a world\nwhere\
    \ everything is connected, isolated solutions have no place. By contrast, interoperability\
    \ must be\nthe cornerstone feature that all solutions adopt, thus contributing\
    \ to a more productive environment\nwhere information is exchanged for a greater\
    \ good. The proposed solution is a platform that allows\nfor the integration of\
    \ different suppliers’ devices, and implements standards and open interfaces and\n\
    data models based on NGSI-LD. Additionally, the platform exploits the stored information\
    \ to analyze,\nin real time, the factors associated with the production process,\
    \ the evolution of the crops, and the\noptimal use of water for irrigation. The\
    \ core features the platform are as follows:\n1.\nScalability and ﬂexibility:The\
    \ platform, instead of being locked to a single provider, is up to date\nwith\

    \ is structured as follows: In Section 2, the proposed solution is\nintroduced,\
    \ detailing the most unique elements. Section 3 outlines the deployment in a community\n\
    of irrigators. Section 4 shows the evaluation of the system at different levels\
    \ of implementation and\nthe results obtained. Finally, in Section 5, the conclusion\
    \ and new proposals based in these results\nare described.\n1.1. Information Models\
    \ Applied to Agriculture\nThe data collected by all connected devices are characterized\
    \ by scalability, heterogeneity,\nand dynamism:\n•\nScalability: Millions of sensors\
    \ continuously generating large amounts of information;\n•\nHeterogeneity: There\
    \ is a wide variety of sensors;\n•\nDynamism: The high speed of generation produced\
    \ the need to generate data models that allow\nfor better use and dissemination\
    \ of the information from these devices.\nGiven the above factors, interoperability\
    \ mechanisms must be generated that allow for the\nintegration of different devices,\
    \ applications, or platforms to ﬁlter the vast amounts of information\nthat many\
    \ systems are producing [8]. The shared data models are useful as they are essential\
    \ resources\nthat improve the communication, knowledge recovery, and interoperability\
    \ of information systems to\ndevelop better applications for the agri-food sector\
    \ [9].\nToday, different data models are available; many of them were developed\
    \ by the organizations\nin charge of developing their standards. The Open Geospatial\
    \ Consortium (OGC) data models are\nused primarily in geosciences and environmental\
    \ domains, including the SensorThings API, based on\nthe Observations and Measurements\
    \ (O&M) data model (OGC/ISO 19156:2011), which transforms\nthe numerous unconnected\
    \ IoT systems into a fully connected platform where complex tasks can\nbe performed\
    \ and synchronized. The Open Connectivity Foundation speciﬁes data models based\n\
    on vertical industries such as the automotive, healthcare, industrial, and smart\
    \ home sectors. The\nWorld Wide Web Consortium Thing Description provides some\
    \ vocabularies to describe real things\nbut does not focus much on the data. Other\
    \ vocabularies, such as those offered by the INSPIRE\ndirective [10], deﬁne the\
    \ rules on the interoperability of spatial data sets and their associated services;\n\
    these are mandatory.\nCurrently, some resources speed up the data modeling of\
    \ a speciﬁc location or sector. In the ﬁeld\nof agriculture, Drury et al. [11]\
    \ presented different types of tools to help us develop this task:\n•\nControlled\
    \ vocabulary (a set of preselected terms or words for a speciﬁc domain): An example\n\
    is AGROVOC vocabulary, promoted by the Food and Agriculture Organization of the\
    \ United\nNations (FAO) and available in multiple languages.\n•\nMiscellaneous\
    \ ontologies: Crop Ontology, AgroPortal, Dairy Farming Ontology (DFO), AgOnt,\n\
    CIARD Ring, and Vest.\n•\nData exchange standards: AgriOpenLink, AgroXML, and\
    \ AgroRDF; speciﬁc ontologies: SSN (for\nsensor discovery) and Cotton Ontology\
    \ (diseases and pests that affect cotton).\nThe basis of many decisions is the\
    \ uniformity of architectures, and ETSI ISG CIM provides the\ncorrect interfaces\
    \ (006 V1.1.1 (2019-07)) and context information management (CIM) and allows for\
    \ the\nuniﬁed representation of the information through next generation service\
    \ interfaces with linked data\nSensors 2020, 20, 1153\n4 of 20\n(NGSI-LD) [12].\
    \ This reduces the time and resources required for the management of daily tasks\
    \ and\nfor the improvement of the productivity and beneﬁts.\nA diverse range of\
    \ ontological models are available for the IoT, developed with different\nobjectives\
    \ [13,14] that describe various areas, such as Fiesta-IoT ontology, which reuses\
    \ the results\nof projects and current EU strategies in semantic web technologies,\
    \ such as OpenIoT, DUL, VITAL,\nSpitﬁre, IoT-O, IoT-A, IoT-Lite, and Sensei. One\
    \ recent ontology, which is promoted by the ETSI\nSmartM2M Technical Committee,\
    \ is the Smart Appliances REFerence (SAREF) ontology, a shared\nmodel of consensus\
    \ that facilitates the matching of existing assets in the smart appliances domain\
    \ and\nallows for the separation and recombination of different parts of the ontology\
    \ according to speciﬁc\nneeds. For the agricultural ﬁeld, the SAREF4AGRI version\
    \ [15] was created to provide services for\nanimal husbandry, intelligent irrigation,\
    \ and the integration of multiple data sources to provide support\nservices for\
    \ decision making.\nSome models are promoted by public administrations, such as\
    \ the standardized water\nmanagement model applied to irrigation model (MEGA)\
    \ [16], an initiative of the Ministry of\nAgriculture of Spain, included in the\
    \ ISO 21622 standard and managed by TRAGSA Group. The\npurpose of MEGA is to establish\
    \ a standardized model that, when applied to irrigation, allows for\ninteroperability\
    \ between different systems that coexist in the same facility and thus to efﬁciently\n\
    manage irrigation water use. The introduction of the standardized model improves\
    \ how the irrigation\nschedules and the requirements of the control systems are\
    \ speciﬁed, establishing a clear separation\nbetween decision making and execution.\n\
    1.2. IoT Solutions in the Agricultural Sector\nMultiple problems exist in the\
    \ domain of agriculture, such as irrigation, the application of\npesticides and\
    \ fertilizers, and the monitoring of crops, land, and livestock. Different researchers\
    \ are\nworking to provide the best possible solutions:\n•\nImprovements in productivity:Through\
    \ the sensorization of crops to provide values in real time,\nthe farmer can apply\
    \ irrigation, pesticides, and fertilizers only when they are needed. For example,\n\
    Araby et al. [17] proposed the integration of the IoT and machine learning to\
    \ predict diseases\nin horticultural crops before they appear, allowing the farmer\
    \ to apply the necessary defense\nmechanisms, thus improving productivity and\
    \ reducing the use of pesticides. Trilles et al. [18]\npresented a low-cost sensor-equipped\
    \ platform, SEenviro, which applies a disease model for alert\nmanagement in vineyards;\n\
    •\nDetection of undetected problems: Using satellite images or drones, harmful\
    \ agronomic factors,\npreviously untreated, can be detected and mapped in crops\
    \ using remote-sensing techniques. For\nexample, De Rango et al. [19] monitored\
    \ crops using the images provided by a drone to see if they\nhad parasites and\
    \ to decide if subsequent treatment was necessary, representing a new technique\n\
    for the coordination and control of the drone ﬂeet in precision agriculture (PA);\n\
    •\nMonitoring the behavior of plants: Through the use of artiﬁcial intelligence\
    \ to analyze the\nentire dataset obtained from crops to make future predictions,\
    \ the PLANTAE platform [20] is a\nsystem capable of managing the agricultural\
    \ process and simultaneously using machine-learning\ntechniques to detect possible\
    \ diseases in plants. Other works, such as that of Choudhury et al. [21],\nmonitored\
    \ the behavior of plants to avoid pests and diseases. Through the use of a mobile\n\
    applications, farmers report events that improve the models of diseases used;\n\
    •\nEfﬁcient water management: Crop water adjustments should avoid water stress.\
    \ Riquelme\net al. [22] showed how the use of cloud services involving the FIWARE\
    \ platform allows for the\nimprovement of the management of water used for irrigation\
    \ in areas with water deﬁcits. Another\nproject to be considered, also based on\
    \ FIWARE, is the SWAMP platform [23]. Its primary objective\nis to develop innovative\
    \ methods based on the IoT for the intelligent management of irrigation\nwater,\
    \ using the semantic characteristics provided by a context engine based on the\
    \ SPARQL\nProtocol and RDF Query Language (SPARQL) Event Processing Architecture;\n\
    Sensors 2020, 20, 1153\n5 of 20\n•\nImprovement in greenhouse management: By monitoring\
    \ its different components, Zamora-\nIzquierdo et al. [24] proposed a ﬂexible\
    \ platform capable of meeting the needs of hydroponic\ncrops in a greenhouse with\
    \ complete recirculation. For this FIWARE-based deployment, Message\nQueuing Telemetry\
    \ Transport (MQTT) communications were used, with NGSIs being used as a\nmeans\
    \ to represent the information. Somov et al. [25] constructed a system to monitor\
    \ both the\nconditions established in a greenhouse and the behavior of plants\
    \ for the prediction of the growth\nrate of tomatoes in different environments.\n\
    IoT platforms can be considered the backbone of any industrial sector that wants\
    \ to provide its\nactivity with a smart component. These platforms collect and\
    \ store data in a distributed database for\nthe ﬁltering, analysis, calculation,\
    \ decision making, management, translation, and visualization of data\nin new\
    \ services. Several analyses of the different types of platforms for the integration\
    \ of IoT services\nand their characteristics can be found, such as that provided\
    \ by Silva et al. [26], although a results\ncomparison is difﬁcult because of\
    \ the lack of standardization.\n2. Proposed System\nThis article proposes an open\
    \ and interoperable platform for irrigation community management.\nThe platform,\
    \ based on standard and open interfaces and protocols, allows for the integration\
    \ of\nheterogeneous information sources as well as interoperability with other\
    \ third-party solutions for\nexchanging and exploiting this information. Additionally,\
    \ this platform exploits the stored information\nto analyze, in real time, the\
    \ factors associated with the production process, the evolution of crops, and\n\
    the optimal use of water for irrigation.\n2.1. Proposed Data Model\nAs a result\
    \ of the lack of the compatibility necessary to manage the large amount of data\
    \ generated\nby the agricultural sector, agricultural managers must be provided\
    \ with standardized information\nmodels that permit farmers to make the best possible\
    \ decisions, allowing them to take advantage of\nthe available data and knowledge.\
    \ Therefore, a data model is proposed here that ﬁts the functional\nrequirements\
    \ of the users.\nThe proposed data model is based on interviews with farmers,\
    \ responsible technicians, and farm\nmanagers about the useful and necessary information\
    \ that should be managed on a farm. The existing\nmodels are too specialized;\
    \ although they cover the information that needs to be managed, their\nimplementation\
    \ is time-consuming. Therefore, we decided to develop a new model that would meet\n\
    the needs of our users.\nConceptually, the model presented is based on the proposed\
    \ by FIWARE harmonized data\nmodels [27], speciﬁcally, the AgriFood model that\
    \ includes requirements for irrigation and crop control.\nThe model was constructed\
    \ as an agile tool to respond to the requirements farmers allowing them\nto characterize\
    \ the plots, reduce the hydric needs of the crops, and control the soil and water\
    \ quality\nand the associated atmospheric conditions. This ﬁrst version of the\
    \ model focuses on the efﬁcient\nmanagement of the crop plots and all the included\
    \ elements, as can be seen in the class diagram in\nFigure 1.\nThe proposed data\
    \ model focuses on the management of crop plots represented by the AgriPlot\n\
    entity, which is part of an agricultural holding, represented by the AgriExploitation\
    \ entity. The plot is\ncharacterized by four pillars that allow it to be uniquely\
    \ deﬁned:\n•\nDevices, represented by AgriDevice, are the devices that provide\
    \ information to the plot and are\nclassiﬁed based on the parameters studied:\
    \ AgriDSoil, those that obtain soil values (soil moisture\nprobes, temperature\
    \ and soil dissolution); AgriPlant, those that measure the evolution of the crop\n\
    (leaf/trunk diameter, stem water potential, and dendrometers); and AgriAtmosphere,\
    \ which are\nthe devices that record the atmospheric conditions (temperature,\
    \ humidity, radiation, and wind\nspeed). These data are used to optimize agricultural\
    \ decisions;\nSensors 2020, 20, 1153\n6 of 20\n•\nWater, represented by AgriWater,\
    \ indicates the type of water used and the parameters that affect\nirrigation.\
    \ AgriAnalysis manages the water analysis conducted at different points of the\
    \ water\ndistribution network of the farm. These analyses are usually necessary\
    \ for fertilization and\nirrigation, since they describe the quality and quantity\
    \ of nutrients carried by the water;\n•\nSoil, represented by AgriSoil, indicates\
    \ the type of soil present in the plot. This entity can be more\ndetailed by indicating\
    \ the AgriHorizon, which includes the different characteristics of the layers\n\
    (horizons) that deﬁne the ground;\n•\nCultivation, represented by AgriCrop, deﬁnes\
    \ the crop and the variety, AgriVariety, with which the\nplot is associated. The\
    \ crop is determined by the different phenological phases that determine its\n\
    growth; AgriPhenology provides the crop coefﬁcients and their duration over time.\
    \ The phenology\nis determined by the variety of the crop and the climatic zone,\
    \ AgriZone since the zone inﬂuences\nthe optimal climatic conditions for the development\
    \ of the crops.\nAnother feature to be considered is the Aerial Images management,\
    \ represented by the AgriScene\nentity, including images or scenes from any satellite\
    \ or drone; these scenes are composed of bands,\nAgriBand, of different wavelengths.\
    \ In turn, these bands can generate derivative products, AgriProduct,\nafter processing,\
    \ such as mosaics (adding two or more adjacent scenes) or indices of vegetation\
    \ or\nwater, useful for detecting problems in the ﬁelds.\nFigure 1. Speciﬁc data\
    \ model for agricultural plot management.\nThe main feature of the IoT-based interoperability\
    \ mechanisms is the possibility of exchanging\ninformation homogeneously in different\
    \ systems or applications. One of the elements that enables this\ncontinuous exchange\
    \ of information is the use of data models. To acquire more signiﬁcant value,\
    \ the\nspeciﬁc vocabulary of the sector must be uniﬁed, which is deﬁned by the\
    \ set of attributes that compose\nthe entities and their relationships [28]. As\
    \ NGSI-LD allows us to link data from other vocabularies or\nontologies, we added\
    \ a level of interoperability to the model. For these reasons, the use of information\n\
    models is considered beneﬁcial to allow for the integration of any device or characteristic\
    \ element of\nthe study sector.\nIn Section 3.2, an instantiation of this model\
    \ is provided using NGSI-LD. The advantages of the\nuse of NGSI-LD concerning\
    \ NGSI are as follows:\n•\nThe information model is based on graphs and focuses\
    \ on information. The concept of Relation\nappears. Entities can have properties\
    \ and relations. Instances of each of the entities can be the\nobject of the properties\
    \ or relationships;\n•\nAll data types in NGSI-LD can be associated with unique\
    \ Uniform Resource Identiﬁer (URI)\ncorresponding to well-established semantic\
    \ identiﬁers;\n•\nIt allows one to make references to vocabularies: all terms\
    \ are deﬁned unequivocally. This allows\nusers to refer to their information deﬁnitions;\n\
    •\nThe model and query language is more constrained;\n•\nThe use of JSON-LD allows\
    \ us to operate with linked data to unify vocabularies;\nSensors 2020, 20, 1153\n\
    7 of 20\n•\nThere were syntactic differences: the metadata dictionary is no longer\
    \ needed, GeoProperty is\nused instead of geo:json, JSON-LD @context is included,\
    \ TemporalProperty is used instead of\nDateTime, and an “object” ﬁeld is used\
    \ to encode the relation target.\n2.2. System Architecture\nSince the new IoT\
    \ devices and the new communications technologies provide the user with\nfaster\
    \ and more efﬁcient communication, we propose an affordable platform, independent\
    \ of the\nprovider and interoperable, as the cornerstone for all connections between\
    \ applications/services\nand the irrigation elements. In this way, we offer a\
    \ common framework so that applications can\ninteract with any aspect that is\
    \ part of a farm in a similar way, while being able to act on any device\nor controller\
    \ using the same set of instructions, thus allowing for greater interoperability\
    \ between\ndifferent manufacturers or services.\nThe architecture of the platform\
    \ proposed in this paper is depicted in Figure 2. It has a layered\nmodular form\
    \ ranging from the deployment of sensors and the monitoring of techniques for\
    \ data\nextraction to the intelligent processing of data. Each of these layers\
    \ is based on open and standard\ninitiatives, such as the one provided by the\
    \ FIWARE community [29] or the ETSI ISG CIM group.\nFigure 2. General vision of\
    \ the proposed architecture.\nThe ﬁrst layer, Device and Data Acquisition, represents\
    \ the different sources of information that form\nthe system; these include sensors,\
    \ actuators, open information available on the Internet, and databases\nwith updated\
    \ information of interest. These devices employ different communication technologies\n\
    to transmit information to an IoT Backend module formed by IoT Agents. This module\
    \ acts as an\nintermediary with the second layer and transforms information unidirectionally\
    \ or bidirectionally\n(in the case of actuators), allowing the IoT devices to\
    \ interact with the platform.\nA speciﬁc module is required because of the restrictions\
    \ imposed by the modules on the processing\ncapacity, memory, and even the available\
    \ power to these devices. These restrictions usually prevent\nthem from using\
    \ heavy protocols at the application level, so they use lightweight protocols\
    \ such as\nCoAP or MQTT or integrate other solutions such as LoRa and Sigfox to\
    \ perform communications\nSensors 2020, 20, 1153\n8 of 20\nwith the different\
    \ devices through Ethernet or mobile networks (e.g., GPRS/3G/4G/NB-IoT/5G).\n\
    As such, the IoT backend module component acts as an intermediary by translating\
    \ the information\nsent through these protocols to the interface made available\
    \ by the broker through NGSI-LD.\nThe second layer, Information Management, contains\
    \ software components in charge of data storage,\nprocessing, and distribution.\
    \ The distributed infrastructure is composed of servers in the cloud that\nwork\
    \ together to manage massive amounts of data and make them available to the upper\
    \ layer. The\nNGSI-LD interface is used to send data updates and receive notiﬁcations\
    \ about data changes. Figure 3\npresents an example of how the information provided\
    \ by an IoT gateway, which implements JSON\nover MQTT, is integrated into the\
    \ platform.\nFigure 3. Data model from Internet of Things (IoT) level to applications.\n\
    The element chosen was the device that analyses the water at the exit of the wastewater\
    \ treatment\nplant and determines the levels of turbidity and ph of the water.\
    \ Once the entity is created in the\nbroker using the NGSI-LD data model, consumers\
    \ can retrieve this information following two different\napproaches: query or\
    \ subscription.\nThe core of this platform is the NGSI-LD broker. It is an information\
    \ broker that exposes an\nHTTP REST API based on NGSI-LD for both registration\
    \ and consultation, as well as a subscription/\nnotiﬁcation approach. This is\
    \ the second point where interoperability is a signiﬁcant aspect. The use of\n\
    NGSI-LD provides various possible interactions with third-party platforms in both\
    \ directions. One\nof these solutions that has been integrated into the platform\
    \ through the development of a connector\nis MEGA [16]. The MEGA standard (ISO\
    \ 21622) provides guidelines for the implementation of a\nstandardized model applied\
    \ to irrigation that improves the speciﬁcation of irrigation schedules and\nthe\
    \ control of the system requirements. Within this management layer, the stored\
    \ information of each\nentity is overwritten, with only the current state being\
    \ kept; the information is stored in a nonrelational\ndatabase, MongoDB. This\
    \ database contains data referring to infrastructure and information ﬂow,\nas\
    \ well as information about users and organizations. All this information is modeled\
    \ using data\nmodels that allow for the uniﬁcation of data structures using standards\
    \ and also ensure the generality\nnecessary for the subsequent extensibility.\n\
    The last layer, Service, serves as an interface between users and the central\
    \ layer to offer different\nsolutions to the problems that are generated in an\
    \ agricultural operation, such as water management,\nirrigation planning, data\
    \ analytics, and monitoring of environmental parameters. The incorporation\nSensors\
    \ 2020, 20, 1153\n9 of 20\nof other modules allows us to provide our solution\
    \ with more capabilities due to the possibility of\nintegrating new components\
    \ through connectors with NGSI-LD. The NGSI-LD interface is used to send\ndata\
    \ updates and receive notiﬁcations about data changes. A change in the conﬁguration\
    \ parameters\ntriggers control actions that are managed by subsystems at the user\
    \ level. As a result of the use of\nspeciﬁc connectors, the information is consulted\
    \ or notiﬁed to higher modules that are in charge of\npropagating it for other\
    \ interests, such as historical information, large-scale data management, or\n\
    integration with geographic information systems (GIS). For this purpose, a representational\
    \ state\ntransfer interface (REST) is used, which applies NGSI-LD for communication\
    \ between the ﬁnal\napplications and the analysis modules.\n3. Case Study in an\
    \ Irrigation Community\nThis section validates our data model and the architecture\
    \ of the platform. It was implemented in\nan irrigation community where different\
    \ systems, such as supervisory control and data acquisition\n(SCADA), GIS systems,\
    \ and sensors from different manufacturers, were integrated by the platform.\n\
    3.1. Scenario\nIrrigation communities are corporations attached to basin organizations,\
    \ which are responsible\nfor the management of the shared use of public common\
    \ water. To this end, they relied on automatons\nand speciﬁc irrigation systems\
    \ for years, which were tightly coupled, allowing for full interaction\nbetween\
    \ the devices and the software, but avoiding any other possibility of interacting\
    \ with third-party\ndevices and software applications.\nThe Miraﬂores irrigation\
    \ community is located in the municipality of Jumilla (Murcia) [30] in\nthe Segura\
    \ river basin and has almost 1000 community members. The area comprises about\
    \ 1330 ha\nof agricultural land, mostly devoted to woody crops and irrigated by\
    \ localized irrigation. The main\ncrops produced are fruit trees, especially pear,\
    \ peach, and apricot. The community uses surface water,\n3.8 hm3 annually, and\
    \ water from the Jumilla sewage plant, 1.5 hm3 annually. This treatment plant\n\
    delivers the reclaimed water at its exit, from where the community drives the\
    \ available ﬂows to six\ninterconnected regulation rafts, with a total capacity\
    \ of 1 hm3. The distribution network conducts\nwater from the rafts to the various\
    \ irrigated farms, equipped with automatic ﬂow control counters and\nsetpoints,\
    \ ensuring an average allocation of 4025 m3/ha/year/farm.\nOne of the main problems\
    \ to be solved is the integration of the different technological elements\n(SCADA,\
    \ drawing software, independent sensors, and third-party services) that provide\
    \ information\nto the community in a single control point. The data from SCADA\
    \ that are integrated into the platform\nare shown in Table 1. The results derived\
    \ from the water analysis conducted at least twice a month\nwere also integrated\
    \ into the platform.\nTable 1. Type of facilities from supervisory control and\
    \ data acquisition (SCADA) that are integrated\ninto the platform and the associated\

    \ Equipment and Implementation\nFigure 4 shows the general scheme that was followed\
    \ to address the deployment of the platform.\nThe ﬁrst step was to channel water\
    \ from the headwater reservoir, with its corresponding water analyses,\nSensors\
    \ 2020, 20, 1153\n10 of 20\nto the agricultural plots. The plot is one of the\
    \ key elements of the system. All the devices needed for\nits deﬁnition are integrated\
    \ using dataloggers and IoT connectors. Through this process, SCADA data\nand\
    \ the sensors that interact with the plot (soil moisture sensors, agricultural\
    \ weather station, and\nhydrants) are integrated into the systems. The information\
    \ is transferred to the data model for later\nvisualization (using mobile or web\
    \ applications) and analysis by the users of the irrigation community.\nFigure\
    \ 4. Layout of the case study.\nThe deployment involved the installation of controllers\
    \ for monitoring, and remote control in\noutdoor environments were provided by\
    \ Odin Solutions [31]. The cost of implementing the platform\nwas reduced due\
    \ to the open source feature of the platform. This feature decreased the budget\
    \ needed\nfor dataloggers managing different devices or sensors in the platform.\
    \ In this instance, the cost of\nthe chosen datalogger, IPex12, has an average\
    \ price of around 600 euros (including conﬁguration\nand installation) and varies\
    \ according to the number of sensors integrated into the system. The main\ncharacteristics\
    \ of IPex12 are: 32-bit CPU and 4 MB of memory expandable with microSD, Ethernet,\n\
    USB, CAN, 3xRS232, 1xRS485, and 12 I/O ports, which can be conﬁgured by software\
    \ as digital or\nanalogue input/outputs. It supports Third-generation Networks\
    \ (3G), IPv6 over Low power Wireless\nPersonal Area Networks (6LowPAN), Sigfox,\
    \ Narrow Band IoT (NB IoT), and LoRA. Each IPex12\nis able to manage eight additional\
    \ slaves I/O boards using CAN. The controllers are conﬁgured\neffortlessly through\
    \ their web server, which permits us to conﬁgure tasks independently from the\n\
    MQTT commands received from the cloud computing layer. IPex12 is specially designed\
    \ for outdoor\nsettings such as the agricultural scenarios, since it is provided\
    \ with water- and dust-proof enclosure.\nIt is provided with a battery and a solar\
    \ panel.\nThe dataloggers have the ability to monitor sensor readings of soil\
    \ conductivity, soil moisture,\nsoil temperature, water meter readings, and meteorological\
    \ parameters, among others, and to operate\nthe solenoid valves to control the\
    \ irrigation system.\nThe cloud server is a PowerEdge R7515 Server, with an AMD\
    \ EPYC 7402 2.80 GHz, 32 GB of\nRAM, and two solid state drives (SSD) of 480 GB\
    \ each. It also runs the Ubuntu 18.04 LTS Server and\nLibVirt/KVM. A single virtual\
    \ machine was used here for the global broker, data saving, big data\nSensors\
    \ 2020, 20, 1153\n11 of 20\nprocesses, and to host management with web services.\
    \ The virtual machine uses 28 GB of memory and\n400 GB of hard disk capacity.\
    \ A good performance is possible at the moment, but given the ﬂexibility\nof our\
    \ architecture, more resources could be added by modifying or moving virtual images.\n\
    Once the different modules that form the platform were conﬁgured, the entities\
    \ were deﬁned\nin the broker so that their subscriptions could be made later.\
    \ The broker manages subscriptions\nto the creation or changes of entities. All\
    \ these changes are stored in MongoDB, a nonrelational\nJSON-LD object-based database,\
    \ to provide fast and ﬂexible access to information. The speed of\nprocessing\
    \ is fundamental because, otherwise, a bottleneck is created that would slow down\
    \ the rest of\nthe implementations.\nTo improve the data of the irrigation plots,\
    \ the data model proposed in Section 2.1 was used\naccording to the needs proposed\
    \ by the users of the irrigation community. A model instantiation was\nconstructed\
    \ through NGSI-LD of an apricot tree plot where a soil moisture sensor was installed.\
    \ The\nsoil moisture sensor is listed in Listing 1 and the crop is deﬁned in Listing\
    \ 2.\nListing 1. Next generation service interfaces with linked data (NGSI-LD)\

    \ and Validation\nThis section describes the validation of the platform in a community\
    \ of irrigators from three\ndifferent perspectives. The tests were conducted under\
    \ a controlled environment with the equipment\ndescribed in Section 3.2.\nSensors\
    \ 2020, 20, 1153\n14 of 20\n4.1. Information Broker Evaluation\nThe main element\
    \ of the platform is a NGSI-LD broker, which is responsible for storing all the\n\
    information as well as processing the different queries, answers, subscriptions,\
    \ and the management\nof the information providers. For this reason, an analysis\
    \ was performed by selecting the following\nmetrics: CPU usage, memory consumed,\
    \ and response times, according to the operations performed.\nFirstly, different\
    \ execution tests were conducted to check the platform ability to perform the\n\
    changes without losing the quality of service. The tests were performed with the\
    \ same type of requests,\nchecking their response time in terms of both CPU and\
    \ RAM. All tests were based on a one-minute\nexecution varying the number of simultaneous\
    \ communications or connections with which it was\nperformed. Figure 5 shows the\
    \ results of the tests of the behavior of the processor and the memory.\n(a) CPU\
    \ usage\n(b) RAM usage\nFigure 5. Evaluation of platform scalability.\nFigure\
    \ 5a shows that the CPU requirements increased by around 20% in the ﬁrst intervals\
    \ (2, 4,\nand 8 threads). From this moment on and up to 1024 threads, the CPU\
    \ remained stable with average\nvalues close to 90%. Figure 5b shows that the\
    \ behavior in the use of the RAM remains practically stable\nfrom the beginning\
    \ to the end without altering the consumed resources. The increase in the use\
    \ of the\nRAM during the tests performed varied between 5% and 9%, values that\
    \ are considered optimal.\nThe behaviour of the platform was evaluated based on\
    \ the information distribution characteristic\nthat the broker had acquired. To\
    \ this end, the response time obtained after performing various\noperations on\
    \ the different broker operating modes is analyzed; Table 2 shows the most signiﬁcant\n\
    values obtained in the tests. The graphs shown in Figure 6 show the times for\
    \ the different modes:\nentity management, subscription management, and context\
    \ provider control.\n•\nThe publication/subscription model enables the reduction\
    \ of the number of queries because it is\nnot necessary to make periodic queries\
    \ to receive updates to the data stored on the platform. The\ncreation time is\
    \ longer since it has to be adjusted to the proposed data model;\n•\nThe management\
    \ of external context suppliers is a process that speeds up access to the information,\n\
    making the process more transparent for the ﬁnal client. The broker’s mission\
    \ is to act as a proxy\nbetween the client and the context provider. For this\
    \ reason, search and consultation times are\nshorter compared with the rest of\
    \ the operations.\nSensors 2020, 20, 1153\n15 of 20\n(a) Entities\n(b) Subscriptions\n\

    This section provides an evaluation of the response times of the platform based\
    \ on the three layers\nthat form its architecture. Figure 7 shows the times obtained\
    \ for the system after the execution of\n100 requests. Figure 7a shows the notiﬁcation\
    \ times at its two levels: at MQTT level (MQTT broker\nnotiﬁes the IoT Agent)\
    \ and at NGSI-LD broker level. The times of the Information Management Layer are\n\
    longer, with an average of 21.69 s, since all the semantic enrichment provided\
    \ by the use of the data\nmodel is performed in the database (MongoDB). However,\
    \ in exchange for this increase in time, it is\npossible to have all the relevant\
    \ information of the irrigation community homogenized and integrated\ninto a single\
    \ point. Figure 7b shows the system’s capabilities in terms of performance management.\n\
    The graph shows that if the device is connected, the response time is less than\
    \ if it is not; the average\nresponse time of 31.18 ms is considered low.\nSensors\

    \ Use of the Platform at the Agricultural Level\nData interoperability is of critical\
    \ importance. Here, the proposed solution (data model and\nplatform) provides\
    \ the necessary data translation mechanisms by combining the use of a data model\n\
    together with standardized solutions, such as those provided through NGSI-LD.\
    \ This proposal enables\nthe integration of multiple systems/devices or data sources,\
    \ resulting in an open and interoperable data\nintegration model according to\
    \ the changing requirements of farms. The use of data models contributes\nto obtaining\
    \ performance indicators, decision making, and sharing data with different farms.\n\
    Figure 8 shows the evolution of irrigation before the platform was installed.\
    \ The analysis of\nthe data revealed the irregularity of the irrigation system.\
    \ To have a continuous and homogeneous\nirrigation system, we deemed it necessary\
    \ to deﬁne irrigation thresholds provided by the agricultural\ntechnicians. As\
    \ the ﬁeld capacity and the wilt point determine the maximum and minimum limits\
    \ of the\nsoil humidity that can be used by the crops, we concluded that the amount\
    \ of water between these\ntwo values is the functional water or humidity available\
    \ to the plant. Once the community technicians\ndeﬁned the limits for the crops,\
    \ tests were conducted on an apricot tree plot to evaluate the irrigation\nefﬁciency:\
    \ the ﬁrst as soon as the platform was deployed (between March and April), and\
    \ another after\nimproving the irrigation programming based on the results of\
    \ the ﬁrst test (between June and July).\nFigure 8. Evolution of the humidity\
    \ of an apricot crop based on set water levels.\nOnce the ﬁrst test was analyzed,\
    \ Figure 8, we found that during irrigation, two critical zones\nwere generated,\
    \ A and B, with extreme peaks that were outside the recommended limits, indicating\n\
    Sensors 2020, 20, 1153\n17 of 20\nthat water use was not efﬁcient, thus a scarce\
    \ resource was being wasted. Zone A indicates that root\nasphyxiation was produced\
    \ (a limitation of the capacity of the plants to breathe through the roots)\n\
    in the crop by excess water; Zone B indicates that the plant does not have ability\
    \ to supply itself\nwith water, consequently reducing the quality of the production\
    \ of the crop. Once the maximum and\nminimum thresholds are set, rules can be\
    \ deﬁned for efﬁcient irrigation. When the thresholds are\nexceeded or not reached,\
    \ the platform generates notiﬁcations to users through the mobile application.\n\
    These rules can also be associated with the activation of digital inputs for the\
    \ start-up of any device\nthat improves irrigation efﬁciency.\nAs a result of\
    \ the use of the platform and the analysis of the data obtained, and with the\
    \ help of\nan agricultural technician, the relevant irrigation limits are established\
    \ or adjusted. In addition, other\nuseful parameters can be established, such\
    \ as the root network, the type of soil, or the disposition of\nthe probes. Once\
    \ the irrigation programming was changed, Figure 9 shows that the irrigation was\n\
    efﬁciently applied. The water contributions and vertical column are in line with\
    \ the humidity curves,\nshowing stable and uniform sharing. By controlling the\
    \ hydrants and applying ﬁlters based on the\nlimits set, irrigation was controlled\
    \ to maintain the humidity within the desired parameters, or to\ninform of possible\
    \ alerts to activate programmed irrigation to avoid a reduction in production.\n\
    Figure 9.\nEvolution of efﬁcient irrigation, comparing soil moisture and water\
    \ contribution by\nthe hydrant.\nThe versatility of the platform is stressed by\
    \ the ability to export selected data for further\nprocessing or study, as shown\
    \ in Figures 8 and 9 using the export to CSV option.\n5. Conclusions\nThis work\
    \ demonstrated the importance of interoperability in the ﬁeld of agriculture,\
    \ water\nmanagement, and irrigation systems. Herein, an interoperable and open\
    \ platform is presented which\nis capable of integrating heterogeneous data sources\
    \ at the IoT level to aid and improve the decision\nmaking in a community of irrigators.\
    \ The platform enables the integration of controllers and sensors\nfrom different\
    \ manufacturers, and thus represents a unique access point for all this information.\n\
    As such, improving the techniques used in the agricultural sector is possible,\
    \ thereby sustainably\nobtaining higher economic, environmental, and social yields.\
    \ As a result of its interoperable nature,\nthe platform can be combined with\
    \ other systems to expand its range of services. The interoperability\nSensors\
    \ 2020, 20, 1153\n18 of 20\naspect was tested in a real-world context where successful\
    \ integration with other systems already\ndeployed in the facilities of the irrigation\
    \ community was possible thanks to this characteristic. The\nplatform integrates\
    \ different protocols at the IoT level, such as MQTT, CoAP, LoRa, SigFox, and\
    \ HTTP.\nThey transport the information following different data formats. Nevertheless,\
    \ a set of them promote\ninteroperability, such as Lightweight Machine to Machine\
    \ (LWM2M), JSON, and UltraLight. These\nrepresentation formats were adopted by\
    \ the presented platform as to facilitate its integration into IoT\ndevices, making\
    \ use of this technology. The agents of the IoT backend of our platform perform\
    \ the\nadaptation of this information to the NGSI-LD interface and data model.\
    \ After analyzing the obtained\nresults in the community of irrigators, the following\
    \ conclusions were obtained:\n1.\nA homogeneous data model was proposed that meets\
    \ the speciﬁc needs of agriculture, such\nas efﬁcient water management. This model\
    \ was validated on the platform using an NGSI-LD\nbroker. The application of this\
    \ model in an irrigation community provides its managers with the\ncapacity to\
    \ manage the agronomic information and its relationship with the devices that\
    \ provide\ninformation to improve irrigation water;\n2.\nThe platform was validated\
    \ using metrics to check its behavior. Firstly, the scalability of the main\n\
    component, the NGSI-LD broker, was analyzed based on the average use of the CPU\
    \ (83.21%) and\nmemory (56.39%). At the latency level, measures were recorded\
    \ on the most relevant operations\nof the broker, highlighting among them the\
    \ average time, 510.28 ms, of the creation of a context\nprovider. The platform\
    \ was validated as a whole, showing the time delay from the moment the\ndevice\
    \ receives the information and when it is received by the platform (2.97 s); and\
    \ from the\nmoment the action is performed (31.17 ms);\n3.\nAt the user level,\
    \ the platform was validated in several apricot tree plots, improving the\nmanagement\
    \ of the water used. This improvement was achieved because of the deﬁnition\n\
    of optimal irrigation thresholds for each crop and by generating ﬁlter notiﬁcations\
    \ that, under\ncertain conditions, allow the hydrants to be adjusted, thus enabling\
    \ efﬁcient water use.\nIn the future, the speed of computing and latency should\
    \ be compared by replicating the platform\nin edge computing with current cloud\
    \ computing to detect which one provides better performance and\nresponse times.\
    \ One of these involves the processing of satellite images. At the plot level,\
    \ this feature\nwill monitor the main characteristics of the crop with applications\
    \ based on remote sensors. This new\nattribute will focus on the diagnosis, management,\
    \ and control of irrigation. Currently, this feature\nuses images of the Sentinel\
    \ 2 satellite, which is more focused on agricultural issues, but soon the PAZ\n\
    satellite (the ﬁrst Spanish radar earth observation satellite, which is included\
    \ within the National Earth\nObservation Programme) will be used. Another future\
    \ line of research is the development of a data\nanalysis module that will allow\
    \ us to cross check and analyze the history of the data acquired. This\nwill generate\
    \ better results in agricultural management, increase productivity, and reduce\
    \ expenses,\nsuch as by reducing the consumption of water, nutrients, and phytosanitary\
    \ products.\nAuthor Contributions: Conceptualisation, J.A.L.-M., J.A.M. and A.F.S.;\

    \ has opened productive ways to cultivate soil with the use\nof low-cost hardware\
    \ (sensors/actuators) and communication (Internet) technologies. Remote\nequipment\
    \ and crop monitoring, predictive analytic, weather forecasting for crops or smart\

    \ farmers are\nagriculture experts but, usually, do not have experience in IoT\
    \ applications. Users who use IoT\napplications must participate in its design,\
    \ improving the integration and use. In this work, different\nindustrial agricultural\
    \ facilities are analysed with farmers and growers to design new functionalities\n\
    based on IoT paradigms deployment. User-centred design model is used to obtain\
    \ knowledge and\nexperience in the process of introducing technology in agricultural\
    \ applications. Internet of things\nparadigms are used as resources to facilitate\
    \ the decision making. IoT architecture, operating rules\nand smart processes\
    \ are implemented using a distributed model based on edge and fog computing\n\
    paradigms. A communication architecture is proposed using these technologies.\
    \ The aim is to help\nfarmers to develop smart systems both, in current and new\
    \ facilities. Different decision trees to\nautomate the installation, designed\
    \ by the farmer, can be easily deployed using the method proposed\nin this document.\n\

    1. Introduction\nPrecision Agriculture (PA) is a whole-farm management approach\
    \ using information technology,\nremote sensing and proximal data gathering. These\
    \ technologies have the goal of optimising returns\non inputs while potentially\
    \ reducing environmental impacts. Farmers and agronomists have already\nbegun\
    \ employing technologies in order to improve the efﬁciency of their work. Sensors\
    \ placed\nin greenhouses allow farmers to obtain detailed data on real-time as\
    \ variables such as soil and\nambient temperature, irrigation water and soil conductivity,\
    \ soil and irrigation water PH, nutrient\ncomposition data, irrigation water properties,\
    \ etc. These data can be transmitted and analysed using\ncommunication technologies\
    \ and Artiﬁcial Intelligence (AI) paradigms could be applied. Farmers use\ntheir\
    \ smartphones to remotely monitor their crops and equipments and to run some statistical\
    \ data.\nAll of these techniques help make up PA. Nowadays, the farmers are using\
    \ resources developed by\ninformation and communication technologies. These ﬁrst\
    \ resources are easy to use but they are general\nSensors 2018, 18, 1731; doi:10.3390/s18061731\n\
    www.mdpi.com/journal/sensors\nSensors 2018, 18, 1731\n2 of 21\npurpose and, therefore,\
    \ not adapted to the speciﬁc needs of each farmer. In this work an user-centred\n\
    method is proposed to design intelligent and adapted services where each farmer\
    \ decides its own\ninstallation using edge and fog paradigms (distributed computing)\
    \ on Internet of Things technologies\n(Figure 1). This method is designed on different\
    \ use cases and tested in an automated greenhouse as\nan example of utility. The\
    \ work is an expanded version presented in [1]. This paper is organized as\nfollows:\
    \ Section 2 reviews precision agriculture scenarios, how to use centred design\
    \ methodologies,\nIoT technologies and their deployment, the capabilities and\
    \ potential of edge and fog computing\nparadigms in these scenarios. Different\
    \ greenhouses are analysed and farmers are consulted. Section 3\nproposes a method\
    \ to deploy distributed IoT architecture using edge and fog nodes that offer a\
    \ set\nof new resources that can be used in any type of installation which facilitates\
    \ the involvement of\nthe farmer. In Section 4, experiments including services\
    \ on edge and fog nodes, connected by IoT\ncommunication protocols, are performed.\
    \ Finally, Section 5 provides conclusions and future works.\nFigure 1. Agricultural\
    \ System.\n2. Related Works\nAlthough more complex deﬁnitions exist, the simple\
    \ description of the PA is a way to “apply the\nright treatment in the right place\
    \ at the right time” [2].\nPrecision agriculture comprises a set\nof technologies\
    \ that combine sensors, information systems, enhanced machinery and informed\n\
    management to optimize production by accounting for variability and uncertainties\
    \ within agricultural\nsystems. It is a farming management concept based upon\
    \ observing, measuring and responding to\ninter and intra-ﬁeld variability in\
    \ crops [3]. Methods and technologies to decide how, where and when\nto use sensors\
    \ and machinery should involve all the main actors: that is, farmers and information\n\
    and communication technicians. User-centred methods and IoT communication technologies\
    \ applied\non precision agriculture are revised in this section. Finally, different\
    \ greenhouses are analysed and\nfarmers are consulted.\n2.1. User-Centred Design\
    \ Models\nIn PA context, User-Centred Design (UCD) describe a design process where\
    \ farmers inﬂuence the\nprocess of how the design takes shape. There are several\
    \ ways in which the user (agricultural specialist)\ncan be involved in the process.\
    \ This term describes a set of methods to create models on which\ndesign adapted\
    \ solutions. The user-centred design process works against subjective assumptions\n\
    about user behaviour. It requires proof that the design decisions are effective.\
    \ If user-centred design is\nproperly done, applications becomes an outcome of\
    \ actively engaging users. Therefore, any design\ndecisions that were made by\
    \ observing and listening to them will not be based on personal preferences.\n\
    User experience (UX) is one of the many focuses of UCD. It includes the user’s\
    \ entire experience with\nthe product, including physical and emotional reactions.\
    \ UCD is objective and often relies on data\nSensors 2018, 18, 1731\n3 of 21\n\
    to support design decisions [4]. According to [5], user centred design is a development\
    \ method that\nguarantees that product, software or web site will be easy to use.\
    \ The International Usability Standard\n(ISO 13407) [6], speciﬁes the principles\
    \ that underlie user centred design:\n•\nRequirements gathering, understanding\
    \ and specifying the context of use\n•\nRequirements speciﬁcation, specifying\
    \ the user and organisational requirements\n•\nDesign, producing designs and prototypes\n\
    •\nEvaluation, carrying out user-based assessment of the site\nThe design is based\
    \ upon an explicit understanding of users, tasks and environments. Users are\n\
    involved throughout design and development. The process is iterative. The design\
    \ is driven and\nreﬁned by user-centred evaluation. The design addresses the whole\
    \ user experience. The design team\nincludes multidisciplinary skills and perspectives.\n\
    2.2. Internet of Things: Architectures and Protocols\nIot is developed using architectures\
    \ based on layers capable of connecting a huge number of\ndevices with each other\
    \ and with the established services. The basic model of IoT has a 3 layer\narchitecture\
    \ which are of Perception, Network and Application Layers. IoT faces several challenges,\n\
    especially in the ﬁeld of privacy and security, so to overcome these issues new\
    \ standard architectures\nneed to be more focused on many essential factors like\
    \ Quality of Services (QoS), data integrity,\nsustainability, conﬁdentiality,\
    \ etc. The IAB (Internet Architecture Board) has published the RFC\n7452 document:\
    \ Architectural Considerations in Smart Object Networking. This document offers\n\
    guidance to engineers designing Internet-connected smart objects. A Request for\
    \ Comments (RFC),\nin the context of Internet governance, is a type of publication\
    \ from the Internet Engineering Task Force\n(IETF) and the Internet Society (ISOC),\
    \ the principal technical development and standards-setting\nbodies for the Internet.\n\
    Table 1 illustrates different works that apply the layer model in the\nIoT architecture.\n\
    Table 1. IoT architecture: Layers.\nLayers Proposed\nCharacteristics\n3\nPerception,\
    \ Network, Application [7,8]\n4\nThings, Edge, Network, Application [9]\n5\nBusiness,\
    \ Application, Service, Object abstration, Objects [10]\nIoT needs protocols adapted\
    \ to the new requirements. Traditional protocols are extended and\nnew protocols\
    \ are proposed offering different options on different contexts. IoT has now a\
    \ wide\nrange of applications. A smart devices can have wired or wireless connection.\
    \ As far as the wireless\nIoT is the main concern, many different wireless communication\
    \ technologies and protocols can be\nused to connect the smart device such as\
    \ Internet Protocol Version 6 (IPv6), over Low power Wireless\nPersonal Area Networks\
    \ (6LoWPAN), ZigBee, Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE), Z-Wave and Near Field\nCommunication\
    \ (NFC). They are short range standard network protocols, while SigFox and Cellular\n\
    are Low Power Wide Area Network (LPWAN).standard protocols. In [11] a review and\
    \ comparison of\ndifferent communication protocols in IoT is realised. This comparison\
    \ aims at presenting guidelines\nfor the researchers to be able to select the\
    \ right protocol for different applications. Table 2 illustrates\ndifferent protocols\
    \ used in the architecture layers.\nSensors 2018, 18, 1731\n4 of 21\nTable 2.\
    \ IoT protocols.\nLayer\nProtocols\nSession/Application\nMQTT, CoAP, AMQT, HTTP,\

    WiFi, Bluetooth Low Energy, Z-Wave, ZigBee, LoraWan, IEEE 802.15.4, LTE, ...\n\
    Choosing the most appropriate protocol depends on several facts of which most\
    \ important are:\nenvironmental conditions, network characteristics, the amount\
    \ of data to be transferred, security levels\nand quality of service requests\
    \ [12]. CoAP network is primarily a one-to-one protocol for transferring\nstate\
    \ information between client and server while MQTT is a many-to-many communication\n\
    protocol for exchanging messages between multiple clients. CoAP runs over UDP\
    \ which means\nthat communication overhead is signiﬁcantly reduced. If constrained\
    \ communication and battery\nconsumption is not an issue, RESTful services can\
    \ be easily implemented and interact with the Internet\nusing the worldwide HTTP\
    \ [13]. If the targeted ﬁnal applications require massive updates of the same\n\
    value, MQTT protocol is more suitable. In this work different protocols (MQTT,\
    \ HTTP, Bluetooth, WiFi,\nLTE, ...) can be used to develop proposed architecture.\n\
    2.3. Internet of Things Technologies Applied on PA Scenarios\nAdvance in electronics,\
    \ computing and telecommunications are allowing the development of\nnew devices\
    \ (sensors, actuators and computing nodes) with wireless communication capabilities,\n\
    installed at any location, smaller, energy efﬁcient, autonomous, more powerful\
    \ and low cost [14–18].\nIoT works using user-driven service modeling is proposed\
    \ in [19]. Low-cost IoT devices that need\nto gather and transmit sensor data\
    \ and receive remote commands is shown in [20–22]. IoT uses the\nconnection between\
    \ devices to improve their efﬁciency and user experience, being the communication\n\
    one of the main elements for a proper IoT network. A review of the most common\
    \ wired and wireless\ncommunication protocols, discussion of their characteristics,\
    \ advantages and disadvantages as well as\na comparison study to choose the best\
    \ bidirectional sensor network composed by low power devices is\nrealised in [23].\
    \ Previous works show the degree of development of IoT technology, which has also\n\
    been experienced in precision agriculture in recent years.\nIoT technologies are\
    \ proposed in PA scenarios. In [24] this paradigm is analysed as a solution in\n\
    precision farming. IoT Smart farming application include farm parameters tracking,\
    \ monitoring, ﬁeld\nobservation and storage monitoring. The work Internet of Things\
    \ Platform for Smart Farming [25]\npresents a platform based on IoT technologies\
    \ that can automate the collection of environmental, soil,\nfertilisation, and\
    \ irrigation data; automatically correlate such data and ﬁlter-out invalid data\
    \ from\nthe perspective of assessing crop performance; and compute crop forecasts\
    \ and personalised crop\nrecommendations for any particular farm. This platform\
    \ (SmartFarmNet) can integrate virtually any\nIoT device, including commercially\
    \ available sensors, cameras, weather stations, etc., and store their\ndata in\
    \ the cloud for performance analysis and recommendations. An evaluation of the\
    \ SmartFarmNet\nplatform and the experiences and lessons learnt in developing\
    \ this system concludes the paper.\nSmartFarmNet is the ﬁrst and currently largest\
    \ system in the world (in terms of the number of\nsensors attached, crops assessed,\
    \ and users it supports) that provides crop performance analysis\nand recommendations.\n\
    In [9] a greenhouse with hydroponic crop production was designed, developed and\
    \ tested using\nUbiquitous Sensor Network monitoring and control on Internet of\
    \ Things paradigm. The experimental\nresults showed that the Internet technologies\
    \ and Smart Object Communication Patterns can be\ncombined to encourage development\
    \ of Precision Agriculture. They demonstrated added beneﬁts\n(cost, energy, smart\
    \ developing, acceptance by agricultural specialists) when a project is launched.\n\
    Other related work is shown in [26] with Zig Bee technology: Artiﬁcial intelligence\
    \ and decision\nsupport approaches have been developed. This work develop technology\
    \ for real-time monitoring\nSensors 2018, 18, 1731\n5 of 21\nof citrus soil moisture\
    \ and nutrients and the research on the integration of fertilization and irrigation\n\
    decision support system. The results showed that the system could help the grower\
    \ to scientiﬁcally\nfertilize or irrigate, improve the precision operation level\
    \ of citrus production, reduce the cost and\nreduce the pollution caused by chemical\
    \ fertilizer. A review into the state-of-the-art of Big Data\napplications in\
    \ Smart Farming is performed in [27]. Malche et al. [28] proposed a prototype\
    \ IoT system\nfor water level monitoring which can be implemented in future smart\
    \ villages in India. Manufacturers\nof the agricultural sector highlights the\
    \ importance of IoT in [29–32]. PA is effectively a suite of\nmethods, approaches\
    \ and instrumentation that farmers should examine in detail to decide which is\n\
    the most suitable for their business.\n2.4. Internet of Things, Cloud and Machine\
    \ Learning Evolution: Edge and Fog Computing Paradigms\nInternet of Things (IoT)\
    \ aims to bring every object (e.g. smart cameras, environmental sensors,\ncontrol\
    \ appliances, machine learning analysis) on line, hence generating massive amounts\
    \ of data that\ncan overwhelm storage systems and data analytic applications.\
    \ Cloud computing offers services at\nthe infrastructure level that can scale\
    \ to IoT storage and processing requirements. However, there are\napplications\
    \ such as sensor monitoring, control and analysis response that require low latency\
    \ therefore,\ndelay caused by transferring data to the cloud and then back to\
    \ the application can seriously impact\ntheir performances. To overcome this limitation,\
    \ Fog and Edge computing paradigms have been\nproposed, where cloud services are\
    \ extended to the edge of the network to decrease the latency and\nnetwork congestion\
    \ [33]. Both fog computing and edge computing involve pushing intelligence and\n\
    processing capabilities down closer to where the data originates from pumps, motors,\
    \ sensors, relays,\netc. The key difference between the two architectures is exactly\
    \ where that intelligence and computing\npower is placed:\n•\nFog computing pushes\
    \ intelligence down to the local area network level, processing data in a fog\n\
    node or IoT gateway\n•\nEdge computing pushes the intelligence, processing power\
    \ and communication capabilities of an\nedge gateway or appliance directly into\
    \ devices like programmable automation controllers (PACs)\nWith IoT implementation\
    \ now becoming more widespread, devices will generate a lot of data at\nthe end\
    \ of the network and many applications will be deployed at the edge to process\
    \ the information.\nCisco Systems predicts that an estimated 50 billion devices\
    \ will connect to the Internet by 2020 [34–36].\nSome of the applications they\
    \ run might require very short response times, some might involve private\ndata,\
    \ and some might produce huge quantities of data. Cloud computing cannot support\
    \ these IoT\napplications. Edge and Fog computing paradigms, on the other hand,\
    \ can do so and will promote\nmany new IoT applications.\nThe work done in [37]\
    \ concludes that the wireless sensor and actuator networks based on Edge\ncomputing\
    \ are experiencing fast development and opportunities in the post-Cloud era, and\
    \ are used\nin more and more applications. In [38] a Fog Computing Based on radio\
    \ access networks is proposed\nfor smart-cities services.\n2.5. Automated Technologies\
    \ in Greenhouses\nDifferent greenhouses in the south east of Spain have been visited\
    \ to analyse the type of installation\nand to ask expert users. The greenhouse\
    \ with the highest level of automation showed a complete\nnumber of sensors and\
    \ actuators; however, not all the sensors could be related. There are two large\n\
    subsystems in self-assembled greenhouses that are not interoperable. These subsystems\
    \ install different\ntypes of control and technologies:\n•\nIrrigation and nutrition\n\
    •\nAir conditioning and ventilation.\nSensors 2018, 18, 1731\n6 of 21\nIn these\
    \ facilities, an ambient temperature sensor of the air conditioning system is\
    \ not related to\nan irrigation water temperature sensor of the irrigation system.\
    \ Figure 2 shows different automated\ngreenhouses where main subsystems are listed.\n\
    Figure 2. Automated greenhouses: main subsystems in current facilities.\n3. User\
    \ Centred and Computing Method Model: Distributed Computing Architecture Based\
    \ on\nEdge and Fog Nodes\nThe current agricultural facilities are divided in subsystems\
    \ (irrigation, light, climate, soil, crop\nand energy) that are not interconnected.\
    \ Industrial logic programmable controllers and specialised\nsensors give basic\
    \ automation services in each subsystem. Internet and electronic devices (smartphones)\n\
    provide new functionalities based on information access, control and monitoring.\
    \ Human interfaces\non smartphones connected to web servers are examples of new\
    \ services developed over the past years.\nAgricultural technician and farmers\
    \ have knowledge that can be converted on expert rules for device\ncontrol. These\
    \ rules are programmed and implemented on actual programmable devices; however,\n\
    they are static rules which means that do not evolve when new conditions occur,\
    \ neither do they\nadapt to the singularities of each installation. The farmer\
    \ has to decide how to set the rules: what pH\nthe irrigation water must have,\
    \ how much water should be programmed in irrigation process, etc.\nAlso, each\
    \ rule only has effects in a subsystem (irrigation, climate), there is no interoperability.\n\
    Considering this context, new facilities design and development method are proposed\
    \ in this\nwork. The aim is that the farmer participates in the automated activities\
    \ and that the subsystems\nbecome interoperable. A method that implement automatic\
    \ rules and automate the decision making\nconsidering the behaviour of the installation\
    \ itself are also proposed. The phases of the proposed\nmodel are shown in Figure\
    \ 3.\n•\nAnalysis: two kind of users are identiﬁed in this phase (agriculture\
    \ user expert and ICT technician).\nExpert users in agriculture are interviewed\
    \ to deﬁne main processes to control. All these issues are\nrelated with ICT expert\
    \ in a participatory design. The results of this ﬁrst approach are the things\n\
    required to design services and control. In this phase an user-centred methodology\
    \ captures the\nfarmer requirements.\nSensors 2018, 18, 1731\n7 of 21\n•\nDesign:\
    \ the model is based on an architecture with three levels: edge, fog and cloud\
    \ services.\nIn this phase an adapted architecture using these levels is designed.\
    \ The adapted architecture is\nshown in Figure 4.\n•\nIntegration and data analysis:\
    \ Installation and Integration subsystems are developed in this phase.\nData analysis\
    \ is proposed to design machine learning services based on expert rules with farmer.\n\
    •\nStart up, measure and feedback: Test and feedback are launched.\nThe ﬁrst expert\
    \ rules\nare integrated with farmer supervision.\nNew rules are designed with\
    \ feedback processes.\nAutomatic and adapted rules are developed using artiﬁcial\
    \ intelligence systems with machine\nlearning platforms.\nFigure 3. User centred\
    \ model based on design and integration of edge and fog communication levels.\n\
    Cloud services and machine learning processes are integrated using this method.\n\
    Figure 4. Architecture: communication levels with different functionality.\nSensors\
    \ 2018, 18, 1731\n8 of 21\n3.1. User-Centred Analysis and Design\nThere are two\
    \ cases treated:\n•\nAgricultural installation with some automated facilities\
    \ already installed\n•\nNew agricultural installation\nThe method is the same\
    \ for both. Expert users in agriculture are interviewed to deﬁne new\nprocesses\
    \ to control. In this ﬁrst approach, the things (objects) required, their relationships\
    \ and the\npotential services are detected. Once objects and services have been\
    \ detected, they must be related\nto the necessary communication and control technologies\
    \ (IoT protocols). Human Interfacing are\nadjusted. Expert rules and intelligent\
    \ services are analysed (Edge and Fog computing proposal). Finally,\nthe installation,\
    \ maintenance and operation methods are designed. All this is designed between\
    \ user\nagricultural technician and information technologies expert.\nThe results\
    \ of this ﬁrst approach are the things required to design services and control.\
    \ A ﬁrst set\nof sensors, actuators, variables, processes and controllers are\
    \ designed considering production facility.\nThis set of objects will be considers\
    \ like things in the next stage.\nIn this description, a thing is formed by an\
    \ object/entity and a context with data associated.\nEach thing has a n-tuple\
    \ data structure (ID, time, date, location, relations, state) where ID, data,\n\
    location, relations with other things and states are deﬁned. Table 3 represents\
    \ different things.\nExpert users design control rules using the things deﬁned.\
    \ These control rules are part of control\nprocesses (climate, soil, irrigation,\
    \ crop, energy or image) that are distributed in different embedded\nsystems connected\
    \ to the network (intranet/internet). Things are a virtual representation of all\n\
    available resources that can be deployed in the different subsystems of the installation.\n\
    At this level all objects/things are recognized by designers. Basic control algorithms\
    \ of all\nsubsystems are designed.\nTable 3. Things context designed in smart\
    \ control processes.\nObject/Thing\nContext\nSensori\n(ID, time, date, location,\

    \ and their relationship with basic algorithms has been designed.\nAn architecture\
    \ adapted to the facility available is developed in this phase. Requirements are:\n\
    1.\nInterconnection and data access of all subsystems data\n2.\nFacilities and\
    \ resources to implement expert rules\n3.\nConﬁguration, operation and modiﬁcation\
    \ processes\nIoT and AI paradigms provide resources to propose an innovative architecture\
    \ that can be used in\nnew smart precision agriculture services. Edge computing\
    \ used on control devices and fog computing\nnodes installed on local network\
    \ provide powerful technologies to implement conﬁguration, operation\nand improvement\
    \ processes.\nIoT protocols provide resources to capture and communique all subsystems\
    \ data. Each subsystem\nis composed by objects/things (sensor/actuator) that can\
    \ be connected and processed using nodes on\nsensor networks with IoT protocols.\
    \ The requirements established for PA scenarios are:\n•\nStandard and interoperable\
    \ communication protocols to develop open and reusable applications.\nSensors\
    \ 2018, 18, 1731\n9 of 21\n•\nLow-power consumption of all devices installed improve\
    \ the establishment and development.\n•\nEasy access and maintenance. Users are\
    \ not specialized in information technologies. It is important\nto improve its\
    \ acceptability.\n•\nSupport the integration of new smart modules (modularity\
    \ and scalability software and hardware).\n•\nNon-proprietary hardware-software\
    \ to reduce dependencies.\n•\nLow cost devices selection increases the level of\
    \ penetration.\nIoT protocols are designed to work on communication scenarios\
    \ and requirements established.\nThey are optimised for control and two-way open\
    \ communication channels. In these works [39–41]\nMessage Queuing Telemetry Transport\
    \ (MQTT) protocol is proposed as communication paradigm\nbetween sensors, actuators,\
    \ communication nodes, devices and subsystems. Some of the features that\nmakes\
    \ it especially suitable for this project are:\n•\nMQTT is a publish-subscribe\
    \ messaging protocol developed for resource-constrained devices [42],\na model\
    \ already in use by enterprises worldwide, and can work with legacy systems.\n\
    •\nAll messages have a topic path composed of words separated by slashes. A common\
    \ form is\n/place/device-type/device-id/measurement-type/status. The subscribers\
    \ may use wild-cards to\nsubscribe to all measurements coming from a speciﬁc class\
    \ of device.\n•\nThe bandwidth requirements are extremely low, and the nature\
    \ of the protocol makes it\nvery energy-efﬁcient.\n•\nThe programming interface\
    \ is very simple, and the client memory footprint is small, making it\nespecially\
    \ suitable for embedded devices.\n•\nThree Quality of Service (QoS) levels provide\
    \ reliable operations [43].\nUbiquitous networks allow an n-to-m nodes communication\
    \ model. Any node is able to query\nand be queried by other nodes. In addition,\
    \ any node may play the role of a base station (skin node)\ncapable of transmitting\
    \ its information to remote processing places using a gateway device. USN local\n\
    nodes can use and process local data, with a gateway these nodes have a global\
    \ accessibility and\nthey offer extended services on an IoT scenario.\nLocal and\
    \ global access over the same node\n(sensor/device/actuator) has different possibilities\
    \ and beneﬁts. Whereas a local data processing\nis necessary in basic process\
    \ control (security, system start-stop, etc.), global processing (analytic)\n\
    can be used in pattern detection and information generation. In this sense, the\
    \ proposed platform\nuses both technologies combined: different USN over a local\
    \ network area (intranet) connected to\ncloud-IoT services (internet). A computing\
    \ layer in local area, called edge computing, will serve as\ninterface between\
    \ control processes and cloud-services. This layer will be able to process data\
    \ before\ncommunicating to cloud.\n3.3. Data Analysis: Edge and Fog Computing\
    \ Conﬁguration\nThe development of edge and fog computing can be understood in\
    \ three phases:\n•\nConnection: Numerous heterogeneous, real time connections\
    \ between terminals and devices\nwill serve edge computing, as will automatic\
    \ network deployment and operation. Additionally,\nsecurity, reliability, and\
    \ interoperability of connections should be guaranteed. An application of\nthis\
    \ phase is remote automatic soil parameters and ambient conditions data reading\n\
    •\nData treatment on edge computing devices: In this phase, data analysis and\
    \ automatic services\ndevelop new capabilities that are implemented on the new\
    \ edge nodes. Applications of this\nphase can be data ﬁltering, predictive calculation\
    \ of climatic data, classiﬁcation services or\ndetection events\n•\nServices on\
    \ fog computing nodes: Enabled by technologies such as AI and IoT communication\n\
    protocols. Fog computing nodes carries out smart analysis and computing, as well\
    \ as implementing\ndynamic, real-time self-optimization, and executing policy\
    \ adjustments. Applications of this phase\nare prediction of water consumption,\
    \ smart detection or unattended production\nSensors 2018, 18, 1731\n10 of 21\n\
    Figure 5 shows the architecture implemented using edge and fog nodes. When automated\n\
    subsystems are already installed it is necessary to interleaved embedded devices\
    \ (edge-nodes) between\ncontrollers and sensors/actuators. This devices maintain\
    \ the initial services and allow to initiate\na supervised learning process. New\
    \ algorithms are tested and approved on edge and fog nodes.\nIn Figure 6 different\
    \ services are proposed on each node.\nFigure 5. Architecture proposed on facilities\
    \ already automated: edge nodes interleaved between\ndevices already installed\
    \ and fog nodes that interconnect all subsystems.\nFigure 6. Architecture implemented:\
    \ services proposed.\nSensors 2018, 18, 1731\n11 of 21\n3.4. Test and Feedback\
    \ Developing\nIn machine learning systems the output is not ﬁxed. It will change\
    \ over time as the solution\nknows more and as the model on which the machine\
    \ learning system is built evolves as it is fed more\ndata. This forces the testing\
    \ professional to think differently and adopt test strategies that are very\n\
    different from traditional testing techniques. To test machine learning systems\
    \ is essential:\n1.\nObtaining data sets: This refers to a data set with main\
    \ variables captured and stored to analyse\nand design the model. In irrigation\
    \ process data set are: irrigation programming used (time and\nﬂow), ambient conditions\
    \ (humidity, temperature) and soil conditions (humidity, temperature,\npH and\
    \ conductivity) captured by sensors. All this data are monitored and stored.\n\
    2.\nTraining data sets: This refers to a data set used for training the model.\
    \ It is a subset of the\nprevious dataset. In irrigation process training data\
    \ set are: irrigation programming automated\nby the model (time and ﬂow decision)\
    \ considering ambient conditions (soil, ambient and crop).\nThis data is usually\
    \ prepared by collecting data in a semi-automated way. The results of this\nprocess\
    \ are validated with agronomists.\n3.\nTesting data sets: It is a dataset used\
    \ to to measure the model quality.\n4.\nValidation test suites on real scenarios.\
    \ Taking the irrigation example, test scenarios include\ncategorizing needs of\
    \ water for a kind of crop considering climatic conditions and its growth\nphase.\
    \ Automated irrigation decisions by the model are analysed in this phase.\n5.\n\
    Building validation suites. It is necessary to understand the algorithm. The model\
    \ has algorithm\nthat analyse the data provided, looks for speciﬁc patterns, and\
    \ uses the results of this analysis\nto develop optimal parameters for creating\
    \ the model. The model is reﬁned as the number of\niterations and the richness\
    \ of the data increase.\n6.\nCommunicating test results in statistical terms.\
    \ Models based on machine learning algorithms\nwill produce approximations and\
    \ not exact results. Quality of results must be analysed in the\nsame context.\
    \ The testing community will need to determine the level of conﬁdence within a\n\
    certain range.\n7.\nModel evolution. Support to develop new AI services or modiﬁcations\
    \ on algorithms\nimplemented. Supervised and automatic changes are processes to\
    \ maintain the operating models.\n3.5. Comparison with Industrial Facilities.\
    \ Novelty Elements Proposed\nCurrently, industrial facilities that use PA technologies\
    \ are based on integration of internet and web\nservices with automation and control\
    \ using industrial technology. Proprietary systems are designed for\nmonitoring\
    \ large production plants. Related work analysed show that the Agriculture Control\
    \ system\nfor production, irrigation, or climate proposes different monitoring\
    \ and control technologies, based on\nwireless sensor network and industrial control.\
    \ Monitoring systems analyse crop environment and the\nmethod to improve the decision\
    \ making by analysing statistics and reactive algorithms. This work\nproposes\
    \ two main novelty elements: optimization of architecture levels integration of\
    \ edge and fog\nlayers and proposes the integration the farmer in the design of\
    \ new improvements using data analysis\nobtained with the new architecture developed.\n\
    4. Experimental Work\nDifferent agricultural facilities have been analysed to\
    \ introduce the method proposed. Three kind\nof installations summarize the different\
    \ types:\n•\nInstallation automated but subsystems not interoperable\n•\nPartial\
    \ automation without any interconnection and non-interoperable systems\n•\nManual\
    \ control\nIn all of them, the services based on AI are not yet installed. In\
    \ this context, the method proposed\nusing edge-computing on basic controllers\
    \ and fog-computing on gateway nodes can design common\nSensors 2018, 18, 1731\n\
    12 of 21\nservices for the three types of facilities cited. With this conﬁguration,\
    \ subsystems interoperability and\nAI support are achieved. Control signals of\
    \ already installed controllers in automated installations\nbecome inputs to edge\
    \ nodes and a fog node which acts as an interface for all facility nodes. In all\n\
    greenhouses, irrigation and internal environment control are basic processes.\
    \ Agronomist users know\nhow to program reactive controls and how to conﬁgure\
    \ automated devices. Optimization of these\nresources (water, energy) are two\
    \ potential services that agronomist perform through their experience.\nThis knowledge\
    \ can be transferred to intelligent systems that integrate it through techniques\
    \ based on\nAI paradigms. Interconnection of subsystems also are one of the proposed\
    \ improvement. A deployment\nfor an automated installation is designed and implemented.\
    \ This case shows how to implement\nwhen there are already automated installations.\
    \ This case also serves as a guide for other types of\ngreenhouse installations.\n\
    4.1. Analysis\nThe farmer, together with the technician in information technologies,\
    \ propose a set\nof improvements:\n•\nMonitoring and control interfaces on the\
    \ Internet (control and communication services)\n•\nEvent and change communication\
    \ service (communication services)\n•\nInterconnection of irrigation and air conditioning\
    \ subsystems (interoperability services)\n•\nIntegration of automation to optimize\
    \ water consumption (AI services)\nThe work carried out designs an installation\
    \ that deploy the necessary hardware and software\nresources using the proposed\
    \ method Figure (Figure 7) shows agricultural subsystems and model\ndeployed on\
    \ distributed nodes.\nFigure 7. Greenhouse design. Fog and edge nodes relations\
    \ on agriculture subsystems.\nIntelligent irrigation control is installed in an\
    \ experimental greenhouse based on tomato\nhydroponic cultivation (Table 4). Following\
    \ the proposed method, the experimental phases are:\nSensors 2018, 18, 1731\n\

    \ Communication and Context\nIrrigation process, soil parameters, environmental\
    \ conditions inside and outside the greenhouse\nand energy consumption deﬁne objects\
    \ and context. Sensors, actuators and processes and their\nrelationship (context)\
    \ are shown in Table 5. Context vector are (ID, time, date, GH1, relations, state)\
    \ for\neach object/thing, where GH1 is the location ID of greenhouse.\nAll objects\
    \ are interoperable using MQTT protocol. Publisher and subscriber communication\n\
    model that implement this protocol allows interconnect all devices and things.\
    \ Broker device are\ninstalled on fog node. Publishers and subscribers are implemented\
    \ on different nodes.\n4.3. Hardware Devices and Software Modules\nTwo edge nodes\
    \ and one fog node are proposed to control climate and irrigation processes.\n\
    Objects (things) and processes are deployed on all nodes. Irrigation and climate\
    \ control are installed\nin edge nodes, AI services are implemented in fog node.\
    \ Process control architecture is used in\nthe ﬁrst node type (edge) and data-centred\
    \ architecture is used in the second node type (fog) and\nin the cloud services\
    \ implemented. In edge node the ﬂow of data comes from a set of variables\n(things\
    \ and internal variables) which control the processes execution. Agronomist and\
    \ expert users\ndesigns basic control algorithms. After learning and training\
    \ process, these algorithms will be adjusted\nand modiﬁed following the results\
    \ of the expert system (machine learning). The aim is to optimize\nresources (water,\
    \ energy) without losing productivity. Two main control processes are executed\
    \ in\ntwo edge nodes and one machine learning process is implemented in a fog\
    \ node. Table 5 shows these\nprocesses and their relationship. Algorithms are\
    \ implemented in Python and developed using open\nsource criteria. Minimal hardware\
    \ embedded devices requirements are shown in Table 6.\nSensors 2018, 18, 1731\n\

    \ and Testing\nIn facilities already automated, edge nodes are interleaved between\
    \ the installed controllers\nand actual sensors and actuators. Some new sensors\
    \ are installed to complete services designed\n(energy meter). In current facilities\
    \ edge nodes are deployed and allows:\n•\nWork in the same way as before (initial\
    \ learning stage, analysis and model selection).\n•\nChange to a new control using\
    \ new expert and automatic rules using AI processes (supervised stage\nand training)\n\
    •\nTest and reconﬁgure expert rules (testing and maintenance)\nFigure 8 shows\
    \ an edge node to irrigation control and how is deployed in the experimental\n\
    greenhouse built in this work, without previous installation. Agronomists and\
    \ farmers preferences are\nSensors 2018, 18, 1731\n15 of 21\nthose that drive\
    \ the design: interfaces, maintain and optimize control processes. In irrigation\
    \ process a\ntime schedule with the selected flow rate is programmed by the user\
    \ according to the period of crop\ngrowth. In learning stage, edge node captures\
    \ the data and sends it to the fog node. Fog node process\ndiary water uses, ambient\
    \ and soil conditions, type of crop and its growth. Using these data crop\ntype\
    \ is classified. Crop production results are added as data to analyse it together\
    \ with the stored ones.\nProduction, water consumption, crop growing stage, time,\
    \ date, soil parameters, current weather, forecast\nweather and ambient green\
    \ house conditions are captured as inputs to machine learning platform.\n(a) Hardware\
    \ device\n(b) Software processes\nFigure 8. Hardware and software deployed on\
    \ experimental greenhouse edge node.\nIn future crop productions the irrigation\
    \ schedule can be automated, first with human supervision\nand then automated.\
    \ Biophysical variables (plant, soil, canal flow, and weather conditions) that\
    \ are\nmeasured during the growing seasons are used as inputs to build the models.\
    \ Information about\ncrop phenology (growth stages), soil moisture, and weather\
    \ variables will be compiled. The analysis\nof irrigation decisions is important\
    \ because this can help in the estimation of short-term irrigation\ndemands. If\
    \ the automated process decisions are known, It can help canal operators to better\
    \ manage\nwater deliveries and avoid unexpected delays and operational conditions\
    \ that increase canal losses.\nInformation about these demands can also be helpful\
    \ for the evaluation of expected future agricultural\nsupplies. It can never be\
    \ possible to know the exact reasons why a farmer decided to irrigate, all farmers\n\
    are different and prefer their own decision processes. Data analysis with farmer\
    \ in in its own installation\ninfer automated farmer actions. This data is used\
    \ to build the models and these learnt frameworks will\nbe used to predict irrigation\
    \ decisions. The specific objectives planned with farmer are:\n1.\nIdentify the\
    \ main variables contributing to an irrigation behaviour by training the models\
    \ with\nrelevant data\n2.\nGroup the irrigation decisions into distinct classes\n\
    3.\nIdentify the decisions taken\n4.\nDetect the patterns in farmer decisions\n\
    5.\nInfer future irrigation decisions using the information and modelling tools.\

    \ new rules to optimize production. Before, control irrigation was controlled\n\
    only by a time schedule. Now, it takes into account data sensors to decide if\

    In this work the state-of-the-art of PA and IoT technologies in agricultural scenarios,\
    \ have been\nanalysed. PA presents difﬁculties to be implemented by farmers. These\
    \ include cultural perception,\nlack of local technical expertise, infrastructure\
    \ constraints, knowledge and technical gaps and high\nstart-up costs. Farmers\
    \ must be involved in the design and integration of these technologies in their\n\
    facilities. To carry out this solution there must be methods to facilitate such\
    \ integration. This work\nproposes a new method to integrate the farmer in the\
    \ development of new solutions using low cost\nsensing technologies and innovative\
    \ communication paradigms. An architecture based on two new\nlevels of communication\
    \ and processing nodes (edge and fog nodes) form the technological core\nof the\
    \ proposed method. Each level performs a set of interconnected functionalities.\
    \ The proposed\ninfrastructure can be installed either in already automated installations\
    \ or in the design of new facilities.\nIn the already automated installations,\
    \ the method introduces new possibilities for the development of\nintelligent\
    \ and interconnected control. An experimental work has been carried out in a greenhouse.\n\
    In this work, communication nodes have been installed and a new service based\
    \ on a decision tree\nparadigm has been designed by expert user. The facilities\
    \ that use the proposed model make the\nclimate control and irrigation subsystems\
    \ interoperable and allow the farmer to design new integrated\ncontrol rules.\
    \ The new distributed communication model allows the farmer to analyse changes\
    \ and\nimprovements. This experimental work initiates a new methodology of work\
    \ for the farmer who can\nuse these new technologies more easily. Future control\
    \ rules and services using a machine learning\nplatform and AI paradigms will\
    \ allow to optimize and improve the results.\nAuthor Contributions: F.J.F.-P.\
    \ and J.M.G.-C. performed the analysis. Model design was proposed by F.J.F.-P.\

  relevance_evaluation: This study is highly relevant to my review as it directly
    informs the use of architectures and protocols for the seamless integration of
    ML-generated insights with IoT-enabled irrigation control systems. The rationale
    for this is that ML-generated insights can be used to optimize irrigation schedules
    and improve water-use efficiency, while the use of IoT-enabled control systems
    can automate the implementation of these insights in real-time. MQTT and CoAP
    are well-suited for this application due to their lightweight and real-time capabilities.

    \ 8 December 2017\nAbstract: The Internet of Things (IoT) has promised a future\
    \ where everything gets connected.\nUnfortunately, building a single global ecosystem\
    \ of Things that communicate with each other\nseamlessly is virtually impossible\
    \ today. The reason is that the IoT is essentially a collection of\nisolated “Intranets\
    \ of Things”, also referred to as “vertical silos”, which cannot easily and efﬁciently\n\
    interact with each other. Smart cities are perhaps the most striking examples\
    \ of this problem since\nthey comprise a wide range of stakeholders and service\
    \ providers who must work together, including\nurban planners, ﬁnancial organisations,\
    \ public and private service providers, telecommunication\nproviders, industries,\
    \ citizens, and so forth. Within this context, the contribution of this paper\n\
    is threefold: (i) discuss business and technological implications as well as challenges\
    \ of creating\nsuccessful open innovation ecosystems, (ii) present the technological\
    \ building blocks underlying an\nIoT ecosystem developed in the framework of the\
    \ EU Horizon 2020 programme, (iii) present a smart\ncity pilot (Heat Wave Mitigation\
    \ in Métropole de Lyon) for which the proposed ecosystem signiﬁcantly\ncontributes\
    \ to improving interoperability between a number of system components, and reducing\n\
    regulatory barriers for joint service co-creation practices.\nKeywords: smart\
    \ city; Internet of Things; interoperability; semantic web; communication standards;\n\
    API economy; business ecosystem; open innovation\n1. Introduction\nOver the past\
    \ decade, a ﬂourishing number of concepts and economic shifts appeared such\n\
    as cloud computing, Internet of Things (IoT), Semantic Web, or still the sharing\
    \ economy [1–3].\nThis evolution opens up the way for new applications that leverage\
    \ ubiquitous connectivity and\nanalytics in a wide range of sectors (e.g., transportation,\
    \ energy, manufacturing, healthcare, cities,\netc.), as well as for disruptive\
    \ innovation and business models that reduce costs for societies, foster a\nsustainable\
    \ economic growth, and improve the quality of citizen-oriented services. Ideally,\
    \ the IoT\nshould provide means to create, when and as needed, ad hoc and loosely\
    \ coupled information ﬂows\nbetween any kinds of smart connected objects, databases\
    \ and users. Nonetheless, while new smart\nconnected objects hit the market every\
    \ day, they mostly feed “vertical silos” that are closed to the rest\nof the IoT\
    \ [4,5] (e.g., we still need to install ten different apps to interact with ten\
    \ different devices).\nSensors 2017, 17, 2849; doi:10.3390/s17122849\nwww.mdpi.com/journal/sensors\n\
    Sensors 2017, 17, 2849\n2 of 21\nThis ineluctably leads to the emergence of isolated\
    \ and protected islands of information, which entails\nthe development of competition\
    \ in the IoT market [6]. As stated by Guinard and Trifa [7], the problems\nis\
    \ that there is no lingua franca spoken by each and every object, there are literally\
    \ hundreds! The worst\npart is that most of these IoT protocols and standards\
    \ are not compatible with each other, which is\none of the key reasons why the\
    \ IoT has not (yet!) delivered on its promises. IoT integrator companies\nestimate\
    \ that support for every new service API requires a few days to months of software\
    \ development\neffort [8], not to mention the effort to maintain these APIs.\n\
    Several organisms and standardization fora understood this critical challenge\
    \ and started to build\nup consortia and initiatives such as for instance, the\
    \ Web of Things initiative at W3C that aims to create\nopen ecosystems based upon\
    \ open standards, including identiﬁcation, discovery and interoperation\nof services\
    \ across platforms [9]; the Alliance for Internet of Things Innovation (AIOTI)\
    \ launched by the\nEU with the aim of strengthening links and building new relationships\
    \ between the different IoT\nplayers (industries, SMEs, startups) [10]; the Open\
    \ Platform 3.0TM at The Open Group that focuses more\non industrial applications\
    \ and practices (https://www2.opengroup.org/ogsys/catalog/W145, last\naccessed\
    \ October 2017); the OneM2M global standards initiative that involves eight standard\
    \ bodies for\nMachine to Machine (M2M) communications [11]; the IEEE Internet\
    \ of Things (IoT) initiative [12], or still\nthe International Technical Working\
    \ Group on IoT-Enabled Smart City Framework developed at NIST [13].\nAlthough\
    \ most of these initiatives promote various types of standards and technology\
    \ enablers [14–17],\nthey all share the same vision about relying as much as possible\
    \ on open and interoperable standards\nin order to move towards open innovation\
    \ ecosystems that have the capabilities to break down the\nvertical silos that\
    \ shape today’s IoT.\nEven if it is true that narrowing the range of IoT messaging\
    \ standards, especially at the application\nlayer, is a necessary step to enable\
    \ the IoT to live up to its potential, there are other architectural\nand structural\
    \ considerations to be taken into account. Amongst them, it is important to provide\
    \ IoT\nstakeholders with easy-to-use tools, and most importantly incentive environments\
    \ for publishing,\nsearching for, and consuming various types of IoT data/services\
    \ (A distinction is made between\n“IoT data” and “IoT services”. “IoT data” refers\
    \ to data streams coming from sensors or other\nsystems generating or holding\
    \ data (database, ﬁle ...), while “IoT services” refers to the call of a\nweb\
    \ service that takes, as inputs, one or more parameters and may imply a processing\
    \ stage to return\nthe expected result.) [18]. Such environments must also ease\
    \ the control of personal data and business\nservices, seeking to transform the\
    \ current organisation-centric system to a human-centric one. Such a\ntransformation\

    Regulation (GDPR) directive recently voted by the EC [19], in which rules are\

    \ the regulatory environment for businesses.\nAll the above discussed aspects\
    \ must be carefully tackled in any open innovation ecosystem, from its\ndesign\
    \ to its development, use and management.\nThe recent IoT-EPI initiative (http://iot-epi.eu,\

    \ R&I (Research and Innovation) and two CSA (Coordination and Support\nAction)\
    \ projects funded under the H2020 framework, is committed to make strides towards\
    \ the creation\nof open and sustainable IoT ecosystems in Europe. This paper presents\
    \ the architectural building\nblocks of the IoT ecosystem developed in one of\
    \ these R&I projects. The paper is structured as follows:\nSection 2 discusses\

    presents the technological building blocks underlying the presented ecosystem,\
    \ with a speciﬁc focus\non how to efﬁciently and productively access, ﬁnd, share\
    \ and compose new services/applications\nbased on existing distributed/heterogeneous\
    \ IoT endpoints. A real-life application in city of Lyon is\nthen introduced in\
    \ Section 4, in which the introduced ecosystem building blocks have been deployed\n\

    \ European Ambition\nWhile in the US, IoT ecosystems are created around big, multinational\
    \ players such as Google,\nAmazon, Facebook and Apple—so-called GAFA [20]—the\
    \ EU’s strength is rather in smaller and agile\ncompanies [21]. In this respect,\
    \ the EU launched various initiatives to foster the emergence of open\ninnovation\
    \ ecosystems enabling and incentivizing public and private institutions, as well\
    \ as citizen\ncommunities, to join and contribute to the growth and sustainability\
    \ of the established ecosystems.\nAmong other initiatives, the AIOTI alliance\
    \ (https://aioti.eu, last accessed October 2017), consisting\nof 13 Work Groups\
    \ (focusing on security, standards, smart mobility, healthcare, etc.), was launched\n\
    to make recommendations for future collaborative work in the context of the IoT\
    \ Focus Area in the\nH2020 EU programme. As part of AIOTI, a sub-alliance named\
    \ IoT-EPI (IoT-European Platforms\nInitiative), composed of 7 Research and Innovation\
    \ (R&I) projects funded under the ICT30 cluster\n(2016–2019), has been initiated\
    \ with the aim to turn existing vertically-oriented platforms and services\ninto\
    \ economically viable IoT ecosystems [5]. Figure 1 provides an at-a-glance overview\
    \ of the desired\nimpact from an “API economy” perspective [22,23], which, as\
    \ stated by IBM [24]:\n“The API economy has changed how we think about building\
    \ applications (think apps) and how\nwe deploy software (think cloud). The largest\
    \ impact of this change for business is speed: Business\nprocesses and data are\
    \ no longer locked inside applications. The result is the death of data and\n\
    application silos.”\nAn important prerequisite for a successful open IoT ecosystem\
    \ is to create a solid foundation, both\ntechnologically and economically viable,\
    \ to ensure its take up by end-users. This includes establishing\nappropriate\
    \ strategies to incentivize them in publishing and/or consuming IoT data/services,\n\
    including the provision of secure and trustable services (e.g., with more open/intuitive\
    \ solutions that\nhelp end-users to choose to start or stop sharing data) [19]\
    \ to the provision of some kind of a digital\nmarketplace through which end-users\
    \ can trade personal data and/or services [25]. To accomplish\nthis, it is important\
    \ to deﬁne and implement the right building blocks to efﬁciently ﬁnd, share and\n\
    compose distributed and heterogeneous data sources in the IoT. This has been illustrated\
    \ through the\nfour-layer structure given in Figure 2, which has been adapted\
    \ from [7]. Sections 2.1–2.5 discuss more\nthoroughly the ongoing research and\
    \ development for each of these layers, along with challenges that\nremain to\
    \ be solved for creating successful open IoT ecosystems.\nTraditional business\
    \ boundaries\nand revenue streams\nNew business opportunities based\non Open IoT\
    \ ecosystems\nOpen IoT ecosystems emerge\ncomprising platforms, market-\nplaces,\
    \ developer portals, and\nstorefronts, where companies\ncollaborate on loose terms,\n\

    Diﬀerent domains, Diﬀerent data representations !\nHere a limited number of standards\

    \ for breaking\ndown the “Vertical Silos”\nFigure 2. Key technological layers\
    \ underlying open IoT ecosystems (adapted from [7]).\n2.1. Networked Things\n\
    Connecting every Thing to the Internet and giving them an IP address is only the\
    \ ﬁrst step\ntowards the IoT, where the communication network can be a short-range\
    \ radio (e.g., Bluetooth,\nZigBee), a metropolitan area network (e.g., LoRa) or\
    \ still a local Wi-Fi network in a building (e.g.,\nZ-Wave, KNX). Building a single\
    \ global IoT ecosystem to enable seamless communications between\nThings at this\
    \ layer is virtually impossible, and does not even make sense as each protocol\
    \ has been\ndesigned to meet different requirements (e.g., for ﬁrm, hard or soft\
    \ real-time applications), often in\ndifferent application domains.\n2.2. ACCESS\
    \ Layer\nUnlike the Networked Thing layer, the application layer would require\
    \ a single universal protocol\nto enable devices and applications to talk to each\
    \ other regardless of how they are physically connected.\nThis has been illustrated\
    \ through the “hourglass” challenge in Figure 2. Nonetheless, at the time of\n\
    writing this paper, many initiatives, pursued by distinct standardization fora,\
    \ are currently underway,\nwhich inevitably slow down the convergence and adoption\
    \ of a de facto application protocol for the\nIoT. Amongst these initiatives,\
    \ there are two “schools of thought” if we may put it that way with:\n1.\nthe\
    \ creation of new protocols that bypass traditional web protocols such as HTTP.\
    \ Examples\nof well known protocols falling within this category are MQTT, CoAP\
    \ or still the native XMPP\nprotocol that directly rely on TCP or UDP;\n2.\nthe\
    \ reuse and leveraging of widely popular Web protocols such as HTTP. Examples\
    \ of such\nprotocols are OneM2M, O-MI, Webhook that directly rely on or extend\
    \ the HTTP protocol.\nEven though a single universal application protocol is desirable\
    \ for the IoT to become a\nreality, these two “schools of thought” once again\
    \ address different requirements at the application\nlayer. While the former specify\
    \ protocols that are more suited to D2D (Device-to-Device), D2G\n(Device-to-Gateway)\
    \ and D2C (Device-to-Cloud) communication models (considering the four IoT\ncommunication\
    \ models deﬁned in the RFC 7452) [26], the latter is more suited to the BDS (Backend\n\
    Data Sharing) communication model. What cannot be disputed is the fact that the\
    \ second school of\nthought gave rise to the so-called “Web of Things” (WoT),\
    \ which uses and adapts Web protocols to\ngive a digital presence to the Things\
    \ on the World Wide Web [7]. We believe that these two categories\nof application\
    \ protocols are likely the biggest hindrance to the mass adoption of IoT today,\
    \ sometimes\ncausing confusion in the academic and industrial sectors due to the\
    \ wide range of standards today’s\navailable. Given this situation, it remains\
    \ difﬁcult to speculate about which protocol(s)/standard(s)\nwill remain or disappear\
    \ in the future.\nSensors 2017, 17, 2849\n5 of 21\n2.3. FIND Layer\nMaking Things\
    \ accessible through a single universal application protocol does not ensure that\n\
    applications can really “understand” what Things are about (i.e., the meaning\
    \ and description of data\nand services they offer). This is where the second\
    \ layer (FIND) plays a major role. This layer aims to\ndescribe Things in a way\
    \ that enables automatic search, indexing, and integration of data/services\n\
    exposed by these Things into applications. This issue is often described as a\
    \ semantic interoperability\nchallenge and mainly concerned with the payload of\
    \ messages, which not only addresses the encoded\ndata format, but further the\
    \ semantic model that describes the meaning of the data. Furthermore, it is\n\
    a prerequisite in order to understand the service description (i.e., to have a\
    \ clear deﬁnition of what the\nservice offers and how to request it).\nExisting\
    \ IoT platforms often rely on pre-deﬁned data models to describe and annotate\
    \ data that\nis generated by Things. However, such data models are technology-dependent\
    \ and often inherent\nimplementation-speciﬁc features (e.g., speciﬁc protocols,\
    \ language support, structures, etc.), which\naffect the way and expressivity\
    \ of the semantic deﬁnition [27]. In order to overcome these limitations\nand\
    \ ﬁnd a common approach that can be understood and extended by all stakeholders,\
    \ Semantic\nWeb [28] technologies are more and more often applied in IoT projects.\
    \ The overall approach of\napplying ontologies to solve the semantic interoperability\
    \ of the IoT is often described as the Semantic\nWeb of Things (SWoT) [29]. The\
    \ cornerstone of the semantic web is the Resource Description Format\n(RDF) which,\
    \ when combined with other standards such as RDF Schema (RDFS) and Web Ontology\n\
    Language (OWL), can represent knowledge about the physical world [30].\nThe fundamental\
    \ idea to facilitate interoperability with semantics is to reuse and link to existing\n\
    and commonly adapted ontologies of the corresponding domain, e.g., using the Semantic\
    \ Sensor\nNetwork Ontology (SSN) [31] to describe sensor setups and readings.\
    \ In practice, several repositories\nof such Linked Vocabularies have emerged\
    \ in order to discover and promote the reuse of already\ndeﬁned terms and vocabularies,\
    \ like the Linked Open Vocabularies (LOV) repository [32]. However,\nsemantic-based\
    \ approaches also face various challenges which are not yet solved. Firstly, creating\
    \ and\nreusing semantic models for a speciﬁc domain is not an easy process, especially\
    \ for non-experts of\nthe semantic web [33]. Second, integration efforts of the\
    \ Semantic Web principles to web services, like\nSemantic Web Services based on\
    \ OWL-S [34], add even further complexity, which is an aspect that could\ncontribute\
    \ to the disruption and wide adoption of semantic-based approaches [35,36].\n\
    2.4. SHARE Layer\nThe role of this layer is twofold, specifying: (i) how the data\
    \ generated by Things can be securely\nshared between data publishers and consumers;\
    \ and (ii) how to incentivize stakeholders (developers,\nanalysts, businesses\
    \ and citizens) in sharing/consuming personal IoT data and/or business services.\n\
    Regarding the ﬁrst role, one of the major concerns is the satisfaction of requirements\
    \ in terms\nof network security (conﬁdentiality, integrity, authenticity), identity\
    \ management (authentication,\nauthorization, accountability, revocation), data\
    \ privacy (anonymity, pseudonimity, unlinkability),\ntrust among users and Things,\
    \ as well as resilience against attacks and failures [37–39]. This is of\nstrategic\
    \ importance within open innovation ecosystems since software producing organisations\
    \ open\ntheir platforms to third parties, thus posing new challenges (e.g., malicious\
    \ players may make use of\nvulnerabilities in the platforms, and vulnerabilities\
    \ that were previously considered harmless are now\nopen to the community) [38,40].\
    \ Privacy is also a major concern of any product and service consumer,\nwhere\
    \ today’s models are mostly “organisation-centric” rather than “human-centric”,\
    \ lacking of\ntransparency and auditability [41,42]. The GDPR has the ambition\
    \ to embrace such a paradigm shift\nby giving end-users back the control of their\
    \ data [19], e.g., by informing end-users about what data\nhas been collected,\
    \ for what purposes and under which policies the data is going to be processed\
    \ and\nretained, or still by enabling end-users to choose to start (or stop) sharing\
    \ speciﬁc data/service items.\nEven though security and privacy mechanisms widely\
    \ adopted by the Web community beneﬁt IoT\napplications, such as TLS for making\
    \ transactions secure, OAuth for authentication delegation, JWT for\nSensors 2017,\
    \ 17, 2849\n6 of 21\nsecurely transmit information between parties, Public Key\
    \ Infrastructure (PKI), or still blockchain-like\ntechnologies for maintaining\
    \ a permanent and tamper-proof record of transactional data, there are\nstill\
    \ many challenges ahead that require further attention in IoT applications, as\
    \ thoroughly discussed\nin [43–46].\nRegarding the second responsibility (i.e.,\
    \ incentivizing IoT stakeholders to SHARE and consumes\nIoT data/services), there\
    \ is a need to deﬁne and implement effective mechanisms for communities of\ndevelopers\
    \ and end-users to successfully engage with IoT ecosystems, thus featuring some\
    \ challenges\nat the governance level. Indeed, while short-time collaboration\
    \ is relatively easy to achieve in open\necosystems, it is much more challenging\
    \ to deﬁne an efﬁcient strategy to hit the intrinsic motivators of\nbusinesses/developers\
    \ and end-users to achieve long-term engagement [47]. Open IoT ecosystems are\n\
    expected and intended to support joint offerings, ad-hoc collaboration and co-creation\
    \ between all\ncategories of IoT stakeholders, thus following a value co-creation\
    \ logic in which no ﬁxed contracts\nbetween actors are established; collaboration\
    \ is rather trust-based and agile [48–51]. A smart city is\nvery concerned by\
    \ this logic as it is a complex ecosystem comprising a wide range of stakeholders\n\
    and service providers who must work together, including public administrations,\
    \ network operators,\nenergy providers, logistics and transportation centers,\
    \ and so forth. To support trust-based and agile\ncontracts, there is a need for\
    \ the emergence of web environments that help publishers and consumers\nto securely\
    \ expose, consume and even trade IoT data/services. Some platforms emerged in\
    \ this\nregard, such as Dawex (https://www.dawex.com/en/), Placemeter (https://www.placemeter.com),\n\
    Datacoup (http://datacoup.com) or still thingful (https://thingful.net), they\
    \ cover different needs\n(Placemeter focusing on turning video into data, Thingful\
    \ focusing on indexing IoT data/services\nwithout providing any reward in sight)\
    \ and thus do not fulﬁll all prerequisites of open IoT\necosystems [5,52].\n2.5.\
    \ COMPOSE Layer\nOnce Things are published using a common/universal application\
    \ protocol (ACCESS layer),\nwhere they can be found by humans and machines (FIND\
    \ layer) and their resources be securely shared\nwith third parties leading to\
    \ potential rewards (SHARE layer), it becomes time to look at how to build\nmeaningful\
    \ cross-domain and/or cross-platform services. To put it another way, data and\
    \ services\ncoming from heterogeneous Things can now be easily, or at least with\
    \ minimum interoperability\nissues, combined together and plugged to analytics\
    \ software and mashup platforms in order to fulﬁl\nuntapped applications across\
    \ systems and application areas. Such a combination (COMPOSE layer) can\nbe achieved\
    \ using various IDE (Integrated Development Environment) solutions, ranging from\
    \ web\ntoolkits (e.g., JavaScript SDKs offering higher-level abstractions) to\
    \ dashboards with programmable\nwidgets, or still physical mashup tools such as\
    \ ReactiveBlocks, Wyliodrin, Zenodys, AT&T Flow\nDesigner, Node-RED. The latest\
    \ tools, and particularly Node-RED, become increasingly used in both\nscientiﬁc\
    \ and industrial communities, empowering ecosystem stakeholders to build applications\n\
    without requiring advanced programming skills [7,53,54].\n3. bIoTope Ecosystem:\
    \ Architectural Building Blocks\nAs part of the seven R&I projects composing IoT-EPI,\
    \ the bIoTope project that stands for “Building\nan IoT OPen innovation Ecosystem\
    \ for connected smart objects” (http://www.biotope-project.eu, last\naccessed\
    \ October 2017) focuses on solving the “Hourglass challenge” previously introduced\
    \ in Figure 2\n(i.e., addressing the ACCESS and FIND layers). Also, a more in-depth\
    \ overview of the bIoTope\necosystem is given in Figure 3, highlighting the key\
    \ building blocks set up at each layer of the bIoTope\necosystem (the color set\
    \ used for each layer in Figure 2 has been reused in Figure 3). Section 3.1 details\n\
    the building blocks being speciﬁed and developed at the ACCESS/FIND layers, while\
    \ Section 3.2\nfocuses on the ones at the SHARE/COMPOSE layer. Technologies used\
    \ at the Networked Things layer\nis pilot-dependent, and thus will be discussed\
    \ for the Métropole de Lyon’s pilot in Section 4.\nSensors 2017, 17, 2849\n7 of\

    bIoTope\nleverages\nthe\navailable\nvertically-oriented platforms and cloud endpoints,\
    \ thus following the logic discussed in Section 2.1\n(i.e., not imposing any messaging\
    \ protocol at the “Networked Things” layer).\nSensors 2017, 17, 2849\n8 of 21\n\
    From a data/service publication and consumption standpoint (see \x8D in Figure\
    \ 2),\nbIoTope complies with the second school of thought by—at the ACCESS layer—leveraging\n\
    HTTP to support more advanced operations such as subscription-like mechanisms.\
    \ To this\nend,\nthe\nbIoTope\nconsortium\nselected\nthe\nO-MI\n(Open-Messaging\n\
    Interface)\nstandard\n(https://www2.opengroup.org/ogsys/catalog/C14B, last accessed\
    \ October 2017) published\nby The Open Group, which is protocol agnostic so they\
    \ can be exchanged using HTTP, SOAP,\nSMTP, FTP or similar protocols.\nO-MI provides\
    \ a standardized open API for implementing\nRESTful IoT information systems, supporting\
    \ various types of subscription mechanisms (e.g.,\ninterval-based, event-based,\
    \ with or without callback address, etc.) based on the Observer Design\nPattern\
    \ framework presented by [55] that makes it possible for Things to communicate\
    \ with\neach other in a peer-to-peer fashion, thus differing from the Pub/Sub\
    \ model that rely on brokers.\nIn analogy to the Web that uses the HTTP protocol\
    \ for transmitting HTML-coded information\nmainly intended for human users, O-MI\
    \ is used for transmitting O-DF (Open-Data Format)\n(https://www2.opengroup.org/ogsys/catalog/C14A,\
    \ last accessed October 2017) represented IoT\ninformation mainly for processing\
    \ by information systems. Let us note that, in the same way as HTTP\ncan be used\
    \ for transporting payloads also in other formats than HTML (e.g., XML), O-MI\
    \ can be used\nfor transporting payloads also in other formats than O-DF. The\
    \ O-DF standard fulﬁlls the same role in\nthe IoT as HTML does for the World Wide\
    \ Web, meaning that O-DF is a generic content description\nmodel for Things in\
    \ the IoT. O-DF can be seen as a ﬁrst semantic enabler of the FIND layer, acting\
    \ as a\n“domain independent semantic model” that can and should be extended with\
    \ more speciﬁc semantic\nvocabularies (cf. Figure 2), both/either domain-independent\
    \ vocabularies (e.g., iot.schema.org, SSN)\nand/or domain-dependent (e.g., DATEX\
    \ II for the mobility sector, HL7 for the healthcare sector, WoT\nmodels, HyperCat,\
    \ etc.).\nSuch an extension of O-DF has been discussed e.g., in [56]. Furthermore,\
    \ a few examples of what\nO-MI/O-DF request/response messages look like can be\
    \ found in [57–59], even though an example\nfrom Métropole de Lyon’s pilot will\
    \ be presented in Section 4.\n3.2. Share & Compose\nThe SHARE and COMPOSE layers\
    \ are in charge of incentivizing IoT stakeholders (e.g., developers,\nanalysts,\
    \ businesses, citizens) in sharing and consuming IoT data/services. Incentive\
    \ schemes in\nbIoTope imply, among other prerequisites, to (i) support “human-centric”\
    \ security models, seeking\nboth to give citizens back control of their data and\
    \ to simplify the regulatory environment for\nbusinesses, and (ii) enable data\
    \ owners to easily participate in data trading [25]. To this end, an\nIoT data/service\
    \ marketplace is currently being speciﬁed and developed in bIoTope, as illustrated\n\
    in Figure 2. This marketplace, called IoTBnB (http://iotbnb.jeremy-robert.fr,\
    \ last accessed October\n2017) standing for IoT service puBlication and Billing,\
    \ is intended to assist data owners (O-MI gateway\nowners to be more precise)\
    \ in:\n•\nchoosing what data/service items they want to make available/visible\
    \ to the user base engaged\nwith the bIoTope ecosystem (cf. \x8E in Figure 2).\
    \ Stages denoted by \x96 to \x9B in Figure 4a provides\nan overview of the IoTBnB\

    \ to perform if they want to register to IoTBnB;\n•\nspecifying for which purpose\

    And furthermore assist data consumers (cf. \x8F in Figure 2) in:\n•\nsearching\
    \ for valuable IoT data/service providers,\nenabling multimodal search like\n\
    (i) spatial/temporal search: one may want to search for services within a geographical\
    \ area;\n(ii) keyword search: one may want to search for services falling within\
    \ a speciﬁc sector such\nas mobility, healthcare, environment, etc. (iii) reputation\
    \ search: one may want to search for a\nservice ensuring a certain quality level,\
    \ which may depend on various dimensions: data provider\nSensors 2017, 17, 2849\n\
    9 of 21\nreputation, data stream quality, etc. (iv) contractual term or technology\
    \ search: one may want to\nsearch only for IoT data/service producers that make\
    \ available data/service for free, or who are\ncompliant with one or more crypto-currencies\
    \ or still with speciﬁc license conditions;\n•\ntrading and negotiating for accessing\
    \ one or more data/service items.\nIt should be stressed here that, at the marketplace\
    \ level, only the “description” of what the data\nstream or web service is about,\
    \ and how to call it, is collected and indexed by the O-MI search engine.\nTechnically\
    \ speaking, only the semantic models speciﬁed at the FIND layer of each IoT gateway\
    \ is\nindexed in the service catalog, and not the underpinning data streams generated\
    \ at the “Networked\nThings” layer. Indeed, once data consumers have found valuable\
    \ data source descriptions via IoTBnB,\nagreed upon the terms and potentially\
    \ paid for accessing the underlying resources, they can start\ncommunicating in\
    \ a peer-to-peer manner with the corresponding IoT gateway(s), as illustrated\
    \ through\nstage denoted by \x90 in Figure 2. So far, three distinct publication\
    \ and consumption schemes are made\npossible in the bIoTope ecosystem, as summarized\

    \ IoT data/services\nFigure 4. Data/Service consumers & publishers from the bIoTope\
    \ ecosystem standpoint.\nSensors 2017, 17, 2849\n10 of 21\nCase 1 corresponds\
    \ to the basic publication/consumption scheme, where IoT data/services are\npublished\
    \ for free and without any access right. In this case, consumers search for relevant\
    \ and valuable\ndata/services on IoTBnB and then get the necessary information\
    \ to access the underlying ressource\n(cf. arrows denoted by \x96 to \x98 of Case\
    \ 1 in Figure 4b). Case 2 provides data/service publishers with\nthe possibility\
    \ to decide who can access what and how; this being speciﬁed at their gateway\
    \ level\n(cf. “security module” in Figure 4b). When a consumer wants to directly\
    \ access a secured data/service\nitem whose URL is already known, she/he has to\
    \ send a request to the gateway owner/administrator\nin order to be granted. In\
    \ cases where the consumer discovers and selects the secured data/service\nitem\
    \ through IoTBnB, a token is generated by IoTBnB on behalf of the data/service\
    \ owner (cf. arrows\ndenoted by \x96, \x99–\x9B of Case 2 in Figure 4b). Beforehand,\
    \ the gateway owner/administrator must give\nfull authority to the marketplace\
    \ to manage the access to (or denial of) the data/service items when\nconsumers\
    \ have (or not) fulﬁlled the access/purchasing terms. This is done when the administrator\n\
    registers her/his node to IoTBnB. Furthermore, to enable administrators to manage\
    \ the who, what\nand how their data/services can be accessed by third parties,\
    \ a complementary security module has\nbeen speciﬁed and developed in bIoTope,\
    \ based upon ﬁve key requirements, which have been listed in\nTable 1. Figure\
    \ 5 provides an overview of what the module consists of, namely: a \x8C back-end\
    \ database:\nfor storing user groups and related access rights; \x8D external\
    \ authentication service: using the external\nweb service Auth0; \x8E User Interface:\
    \ enabling administrators to specify and manage access rights\nrelated to the\
    \ registered users; \x8F Access control service: for checking what kind of permissions\
    \ end-users\nhave on the requested data/service. To avoid a scalability issue\
    \ at the gateway level when managing\na high number of users’ policies, part of\
    \ this issue can be shifted to the (trusted) marketplace when\nregistering a node,\
    \ as the stateless JSON Web Tokens technology is used implying that the gateway\n\
    only needs to generate and verify tokens when requested. This can be seen as one\
    \ of the marketplace\nincentives to foster ecosystem participation. Case 3 aims\
    \ to design a microbilling framework to help\n(i) gateway administrators: in evaluating\
    \ the quality of their data/service items and thereby setting a\nreasonable purchase\
    \ price; (ii) data/service consumers: in buying IoT data/services in ad-hoc, loosely\n\
    coupled ways (cf. arrows denoted by \x9E, \x9F of Case 3 in Figure 4b). Although\
    \ Case 3 is not yet fully\noperational in bIoTope, ﬁrst ﬁndings suggest that well-known\
    \ decentralized currency technologies\nsuch as Bitcoin fail to meet key IoT requirements\
    \ for efﬁcient and scalable micropayments (e.g., ability\nto conduct fast transactions\
    \ and scale massively in the number of users and payments). This is the\nreason\
    \ why new decentralized ledger technologies are emerging, whether at the academic\
    \ or industrial\nlevel, such as Duplex [60], Lightning Network (LN) [61], Inter-Ledger\
    \ Protocol (ILP) [62], Greedy\nHeaviest-Observed SubTree (GHOST) [63], etc. As\
    \ a starting point for experimentation, the bIoTope\nconsortium decided to focus\
    \ on the LN technology that allows for the creation of fast, scalable and\nad\
    \ hoc bitcoin-supported micropayment channels between users. Although some limitations\
    \ still\nremain to be solved, LN is still under speciﬁcation and associated reference\
    \ implementations under\ndevelopment, therefore leaving room for innovation.\n\
    At the stage denoted by \x91 in Figure 3, third party consumers can rely on their\
    \ own preferred\nIDE (Integrated Development Environment) for accessing and processing\
    \ the selected data/services,\nmeaning that bIoTope does not impose the use of\
    \ a speciﬁc IDE tool. That being said, all software\nmodules developed in bIoTope\
    \ are made available in Node-RED.\nx\nAdministrator\nUI\nAuthentication\nservice\n\

    \ as Interoperability Enabler Of “Smart Métropole de Lyon” Strategy\nPredictions\
    \ state that 66% of the world’s population will live into cities by 2050 [64],\
    \ thus impacting\nhow environment, housing, economy, transport and well-being\
    \ of citizens is managed. The population\nof Lyon—59 municipalities with an area\
    \ of 538 km2—is expected to increase up to 1.45 million inhabitants\nby 2030.\
    \ This growth is accompanied by a rapid change in climatic conditions; the average\
    \ temperature\nin Lyon having increased by 1.9 ◦C between 1959 and 2017 [65].\
    \ In order to cope with this growth,\nMétropole de Lyon has drawn up a climate\
    \ adaptation plan, along ﬁve strategic development and\ninnovation axes: (1) Preserving\
    \ water resources: by increasing from 78% to 85% of water supply network\nefﬁciency;\
    \ (2) Reducing urban heat-island (UHI) effects: by increased the planting of new\
    \ trees in the\nregion (2000 to 3000 new trees per year); (3) Better assisting\
    \ the population: by planning for heat waves\nwith follow-up indicators; (4) Adaptation\
    \ of agricultural structures and practices: accompanying measures\nto move towards\
    \ a conservation agriculture; (5) Improving local knowledge: by better understanding\
    \ the\nimpact of climate change on local scales, understanding the local biodiversity/species\
    \ and the needs of\nthe territory and its inhabitants. Within the framework of\
    \ bIoTope, a real-life pilot related to the second\n(UHI) axis is currently being\
    \ developed, partly relying on the architectural building blocks presented\nin\
    \ Section 3. Let us note that two other pilot cities (Brussels and Helsinki) are\
    \ also part of the bIoTope\nproject and ecosystem, thus making use of the different\
    \ bIoTope building blocks previously discussed.\nEven if this paper focuses only\
    \ on the most advanced pilot (i.e., Métropole de Lyon), comparisons\nbetween pilots\
    \ will be carried out at the end of the project in order to evaluate and validate\
    \ the extent\nto which one pilot (or part of the pilot) can be replicated in other\
    \ cities.\nSection 4.1 provides an overview of the work undertaken to renovate\
    \ a whole street in Lyon\n(primary goal being to provide a wider pedestrian zone),\
    \ from which Métropole de Lyon has beneﬁted\nto conduct IoT research and experiments.\
    \ In this section, ﬁrst solutions deployed at the Networked\nThings layer are\
    \ discussed and evaluated. Section 4.2 details the communication infrastructure\
    \ (and\nassociated performance) covering the ACCESS and FIND layers, while Section\
    \ 4.3 focuses on the\nSHARE & COMPOSE layers.\n4.1. Pilot context & Networked\
    \ Things layer\nMétropole de Lyon has been carrying out UHI measurement campaigns\
    \ using temporary or mobile\nsensors. However, partners of the territory, and\
    \ in particular researchers focusing on the modelling\nof UHI phenomena and its\
    \ impact on citizens, would like now to beneﬁt from a true IoT network in\norder\
    \ to carry out more rigorous studies. Within this context, the Garibaldi street,\
    \ which is located\nin the heart of a business district in Lyon and is the subject\
    \ of a large-scale urban renewal project,\nhas undergone a fundamental transformation/renovation\
    \ in 2014 in order to enable IoT experiments.\nThe different steps of this transformation\
    \ are shown in Figure 6 (left side) through three pictures\nshowing the Garibaldi\
    \ street before, under, and after renovation. An interesting feature of this street\n\
    Sensors 2017, 17, 2849\n12 of 21\nis that there was an underground vault of 1200\
    \ m3, which has been repurposed to store rainwater\nwhich can be used to clean\
    \ the streets, to reﬁll street sweepers, or to water green areas. In this respect,\n\
    and as highlighted in Figures 6 and 7, the street-planted strips have water inlet\
    \ connections to the\npumps in this basin. During summer 2016, four green areas\
    \ were equipped with various kinds of\nsensors, in particular, air temperature\
    \ sensors (for UHI phenomenon analyses), soil moisture and tree\nactivity/health\
    \ sensors (for monitoring the watering needs of plants). Remote controllable pumps\n\
    and valves (for irrigation control management) were also installed. These devices\
    \ and associated\ncommunication protocols are summarized in Figure 7. Since this\
    \ pilot is intended to be an experiment\nspace, three distinct communication protocols\
    \ are used, namely: (i) LoRa network: allows for the\ncollection of temperature\
    \ data (on an half-hourly basis); (ii) Sigfox network: allows for the collection\
    \ of\nboth soil moisture and tree activity data (on a half-hourly basis, too);\
    \ (iii) Proprietary STELLA network:\nallows for the collection of water level\
    \ data, as well as for the control of the water pumps and valves.\nAfter renovation\n\

    Whenever a measure of temperature and tree growth is collected by the LoRa and\
    \ Sigfox networks,\nthe Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR) is measured and recorded.\
    \ Even though the objective is not to compare\nLoRa and Sigfox technologies, it\
    \ can be observed that the SNR values are better for Sigfox (cf. Figure 8b).\n\
    On the other hand, LoRa technology does not necessarily imply to rely on a service\
    \ provider/network\noperator; each person who owns a LoRa antenna/gateway can\
    \ actually grant access to any third\nparty. Such independency is an important\
    \ aspect when dealing with/stepping into “open” IoT\necosystems. As a result,\
    \ we have tested the LoRa network by installing our own LoRa gateways\n(Kerlink\
    \ Wirnet Station 868 MHz ISM band, sensitivity up to −141 dBm) in the ofﬁce of\
    \ Métropole\nde Lyon with street temperature sensors within a 1 km radius (exact\
    \ distances are given in Table 2).\nThe objective of this experiment is to understand\
    \ how the LoRa network/protocol behaves in urban\nenvironment settings. As shown\
    \ in the Figure 8 but also in Figure 9, the small Received Signal Strength\nSensors\
    \ 2017, 17, 2849\n13 of 21\nIndication—RSSI—(around −110/−120 dBm) and negative\
    \ SNR values would suggest that the data\nwas sent by devices that are located\
    \ too far from the gateways. However, these results are mainly due\nto urban obstacles\
    \ that impact on the signal intensity. Furthermore, we observed that the greater\
    \ the\nradius distance between the antenna and sensor, the higher the daily packet\
    \ loss.\nxxy\nx\n%\n%\n❖\n❖\nHumidity sensors\nTemperature sensors\nPlant/Tree\n\

    \ & Find Layers\nIn this pilot, the temperature data collected by LoRa sensors\
    \ are exposed through an O-MI/O-DF\ngateway, which runs on a physical machine\
    \ having 2 processors (CPU E5-2640 @2.50GHz) and 48 GB\nof RAM. This machine is\
    \ hosted in Lyon (France) behind a ﬁrewall. In this section, we propose to\nevaluate\
    \ the behavior of the O-MI gateway—mainly in terms of response time—under heavy\
    \ trafﬁc load.\nTo do so, a stress test is performed by using the open-source\
    \ software Apache JMeter (Apache JMeter:\nhttp://jmeter.apache.org/, accessed\
    \ on July 2017). This software allows to send concurrent requests to\nthe O-MI\
    \ gateway. Such requests were generated and sent from Luxembourg University’s\
    \ network\n(from a APPLE Macbook Pro Retina—mid-2015—with an Intel Core i7 CPU\
    \ @2.8GHz and 16 GB of\n1600 MHz DDR3 RAM).\nThe test plan is designed as follows:\n\
    simulated end-users send O-MI/O-DF requests to\nthe gateway in order to receive\
    \ temperature data measured by sensor number 1 (referred to as\nSL-T-P1 in the\
    \ O-DF tree).\nThe corresponding O-MI read request message (for each user) is\n\
    displayed in Figure 10.\nRows 1 to 4 (and 23 to 25) correspond to the message\
    \ interface (i.e.,\nO-MI-related parameters) whose requested operation is set\
    \ to read. Rows 5 to 22 detail the message\npayload built on the generic O-DF\
    \ information hierarchy (as summarized in the right-hand side\nof Figure 10).\
    \ The instantiation made of this generic hierarchy by Métropole de Lyon highlights\
    \ that\nOrganization###Metropole-de-Lyon#v0-2-0’, OrganizationalUnit###DINSI and\
    \ so on are deﬁned\nas O-DF ’Object’ with speciﬁc IDs (cf. rows 7 and 9). The\
    \ InfoItem (i.e., Object’s property) that needs\nto be read in that case is speciﬁed\
    \ at row 16, namely the sensor 1’s value). As part of the FIND\nlayer, it can\
    \ be noted that the information hierarchy presented in this scenario is enriched\
    \ with\nstandardised vocabularies (linked open vocabularies to be accurate) such\
    \ as “Sensor, Observation,\nSample, and Actuator” (see acronym sosa at row 16),\
    \ which contributes to ease the indexing and\ndiscovery process—via IoTBnB—of\
    \ the associated information. Let us also note that any ontology can\nbe used/integrated\
    \ to the O-DF structure (e.g., SSN, SEAS, FOAF or GEO to name a few). The mapping\n\
    between RDF, ﬁrst-class citizen in semantics, and the O-DF structure, can be performed\
    \ by applying\nthe following simple rules: (i) RDF class members become O-DF Objects\
    \ and (ii) RDF literals become\nO-DF InfoItems. Upon translating RDF into the\
    \ O-DF structure, pretty much all the information is\npreserved except for the\
    \ RDF properties linking RDF class members. As shown in Figure 11 (see curve\n\
    in the right side), the number of concurrent users increases gradually, by groups\
    \ of 300 users, up to\nSensors 2017, 17, 2849\n15 of 21\n900 concurrent user requests\
    \ on the same InfoItem. After 600 s, the number of users is decreased\n300-by-300\
    \ until the end of the experiment (1000 s). This scenario was run only three times\
    \ since\nthe observed response times are similar in all the experiments. Figure\
    \ 11 provides an aggregated\nview of the results as a probability-density function\
    \ of 95% response time values. The remaining 5%\ncorresponds to more important\
    \ response times, which is likely due to either a bias introduced by the\nJVM\
    \ (maximum memory deﬁned for the application Jmeter exceeding) or a network infrastructure\n\
    issue (e.g., due to a HTTP error code such as 502 Bad Gateway). As a result, this\
    \ 5% are not considered\nin our study.\n1\n<?xml version=” 1.0 ” encoding =”UTF−8”\

    \ function (95% of the response time values) considering the request given\nin\
    \ Figure 10.\nBased on the resulting response time, the following conclusions\
    \ can be drawn:\n•\nWhen the load is relatively low (i.e., between 1 and 300 concurrent\
    \ users [0 s; 200 s]), the response\ntime are mainly less than 0.5 s (i.e., more\
    \ than 65% of the values);\n•\nWhen the load increases (due to the increase of\
    \ users [200 s; 600 s]), the probability of response\ntime being equal to 0.5\
    \ s decreases accordingly (i.e., ≈ 50% of the values). In addition, the\nprobability\
    \ of having response times between 1 to 1.5 slightly increases. However, all the\
    \ response\ntimes remains under 4 s;\n•\nFinally, when the number of users is\
    \ reduced back to 300, the server progressively adapts itself\nand the probability\
    \ of short response time (≈0.5 s) increases to more than 65% of the values.\n\
    Sensors 2017, 17, 2849\n16 of 21\nThese response times are therefore suitable\
    \ for slow dynamic systems that would be controlled\nover the Internet (i.e.,\
    \ with no hard real-time requirements). Let us note that the response times can\n\
    be signiﬁcantly higher when the size of the request increases (especially when\
    \ a user wants to get\nseveral O-MI infoItems at once), therefore resulting in\
    \ an increased number of TCP segments needed\nto generate and transport all data.\
    \ To keep requests as small as possible, the developer ﬁrst needs to\nsearch for—through\
    \ the marketplace—InfoItems he/she would like to access to, therefore requesting\
    \ a\nlimited number of data on the corresponding IoT gateway(s).\n4.3. Share &\
    \ Compose Layers\nMétropole de Lyon is committed to provide public and private\
    \ companies and organizations\nwith the right infrastructure and conditions to\
    \ easily and securely conduct disruptive projects.\nGiven this commitment, the\
    \ bIoTope ecosystem and associated service marketplace (IoTBnB) are\nused to allow\
    \ combining heterogeneous data sources into different high-level services such\
    \ as\nWeb-based apps (e.g., for citizens) or dashboards (e.g., for city management\
    \ department) in order\nmonitor the behaviour of the Garibaldi street, as well\
    \ as the “health” of the sensors (e.g., in\nterms of battery charge or signal\
    \ quality). The reader can refer to the video tutorial available at\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gYdFOVXd25o\
    \ to get an overview about how IoT stakeholders\ncan easily use bIoTope components/services\
    \ made available through Node-RED (e.g., O-MI and O-DF\nnodes, IoTBnB node, etc.)\
    \ in order to compose IoT workﬂows. All of this is summarized through\nFigure\

    SHARE layers\nCOMPOSE layers\nFigure 12. Screenshot overview of tools related\
    \ to the ACCESS, FIND, SHARE & COMPOSE layers.\nThe objective of Métropole de\
    \ Lyon is twofold: (i) showing that standardized data can be easily\ndiscovered,\
    \ accessed and composed; (ii) developing an irrigation system with the aim to\
    \ mitigate heat\nisland effects, thus increasing the citizens’ comfort. In this\
    \ context, Métropole de Lyon has developed a\nphysical mock-up of the Garibaldi\
    \ street (see Figure 13) combining all data sources published by the\nO-MI gateway.\
    \ It is composed of two distinct green areas contributing to the production of\
    \ sensor data\non air temperature, tree growth, etc. Data is collected at the\
    \ “DATACENTER” building, standing for\none of the buildings of Métropole de Lyon.\
    \ For demonstration purposes, a simulated comfort indicator\n(based on simulated\
    \ sensor data) is computed for each zone by the back-end system. Two simple\n\
    control rules are applied, namely: (i) when the indicator exceeds the upper threshold,\
    \ the system sends\na command—using an O-MI/O-DF write request—to irrigate the\
    \ area, which results in turning the (blue)\nLEDs located on the ground and (ii)\
    \ when the indicator falls below the lower threshold, the system\nsends a command—using\
    \ an O-MI/O-DF write request—to stop the irrigation. The evolution of the\nSensors\
    \ 2017, 17, 2849\n17 of 21\ncomfort indicator and the two thresholds are vizualized\
    \ on the computer screen. In the Figure 13,\nit can be observed that the both\
    \ comfort indicators (blue and red lines) exceed the upper threshold\n(even though\
    \ the blue curve is between the lower and upper thresholds, the irrigation—cf.\
    \ leds in the\nmock-up—is still active until the curve reaches the lower threshold),\
    \ which is why both areas were\n“irrigated” (blue leds on the ground) when the\
    \ picture was shot.\nIn this application, even though we showed that the irrigation\
    \ system is feasible, it still remains\nto reﬁne the control rule logic by relying\
    \ on machine learning and domain-expert knowledge.\nFor instance, it will be needed\
    \ to analyse UHI patterns to verify whether additional irrigation can\n“boost”\
    \ perspiration and keep trees in better health. Preliminary investigations show\
    \ that, when\ntrees are sufﬁciently hydrated, they evaporate water and, as a consequence,\
    \ a better comfort level is\nperceived by the citizens. In the framework of Lyon’s\
    \ pilot use case, such a control rule logic reﬁnement\n(i.e., identifying the\
    \ optimal indicators and valve opening/closing rules) will be achieved by one\
    \ or\nmore companies that will join the bIoTope consortium through open calls\
    \ in early October 2017.\nFigure 13. Physical mock-up designed by Métropole de\
    \ Lyon as a proof-of-concept of the heat wave\nmitigation system built on the\
    \ open IoT ecosystem (and related building blocks) developed in bIoTope.\n5. Conclusions\n\
    The IoT is revolutionising the digital landscape, making it possible for billions\
    \ of devices to\ndiscover, communicate, and autonomously interact with each other\
    \ for a wide range of smart\napplications.\nHowever, all these Things are today\
    \ feeding vertically-oriented closed systems,\narchitectures and application areas\
    \ (commonly referred as “vertical silos”), which prevent the\ninteraction between\
    \ Things, thus entailing the development of competition in IoT markets and slowing\n\
    down co-operative work between IoT stakeholders. This is all the more true in\
    \ the context of Smart\nCities, which are complex ecosystems comprising a wide\
    \ range of service providers (network operators,\nenergy providers, logistics\
    \ and transportation centers, etc.) who must work together to meet societal\n\
    and economic needs. Given this, and as part of an ongoing H2020 EU project (named\
    \ bIoTope), the\npresent paper discusses the EU’s vision and ambition to move\
    \ towards successful and viable open\nIoT ecosystems.\nSensors 2017, 17, 2849\n\
    18 of 21\nTo be technologically and economically viable, and to contribute to\
    \ break down the vertical silos,\nopen IoT ecosystems need to support key technological\
    \ layers, described as the Access, Find, Share\nand Compose in this paper (cf.\
    \ Figure 2). It is argued that, to create a true and federated IoT, the most\n\
    critical layer is the Access one for which a common agreement about a single universal\
    \ protocol needs\nto be reached. However, there is still a ﬁerce competition between\
    \ standardization fora, making it\ndifﬁcult to to speculate about what standard(s)\
    \ will remain or disappear in the future. In the framework\nof the bIoTope project,\
    \ two open communication standards named O-MI and O-DF are considered at\nthe\
    \ Access and Find layers respectively. The smart city pilot, jointly developed\
    \ with Métropole de Lyon,\nshows that these two standards enable to meet the prerequisites\
    \ of an open IoT ecosystem. Pilots in\nBrussels and Helsinki cities are currently\
    \ under development, which will be used as comparison basis\nfor evaluating and\
    \ validating the extent to which one pilot (or part of the pilot) can be replicated\
    \ in\nother cities.\nFuture research work is concerned with the integration of\
    \ contextual data in the ecosystem (e.g.,\nbeneﬁting from semantic web technologies\
    \ at the Find layer) in order to design and support more\nadvanced and “smart”\
    \ services. In addition of this technological proof-of-concept, much remains to\n\
    help cities and business to step into open IoT ecosystems from a business perspective.\
    \ To this end,\nbIoTope proposes an IoT data/service marketplace (called IoTBnB),\
    \ which opens up new forms of\nBusiness-to-Business and Customer-to-Business interactions.\
    \ Indeed, IoTBnB seeks to provide IoT\ndata/service producers and consumers with\
    \ an easy-to-use and secure environment for publishing\nand/or consuming (even\
    \ trading) IoT data and services. Such marketplace environments can greatly\n\
    contribute to transform the current organisation-centric system to a human-centric\
    \ one, which is\naligned with the EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)\
    \ directive 95/46/CE.\nAcknowledgments: The research leading to this publication\

  explanation: '**Architectures and protocols for seamless integration of ML-generated
    insights with IoT-enabled irrigation control systems, such as MQTT and CoAP for
    lightweight, real-time communication**


    IoT (Internet of Things) devices have proliferated, leading to the generation
    of vast amounts of data. This data can be analyzed using machine learning (ML)
    to gain insights that can be used to optimize IoT systems. For example, in the
    context of smart irrigation, ML can be used to develop models that predict crop
    water requirements based on factors such as soil moisture, temperature, and weather
    conditions. These models can then be used to control irrigation systems in a more
    efficient and targeted manner.


    One challenge in integrating ML-generated insights with IoT systems is ensuring
    that the communication between the two systems is seamless and efficient. This
    is important to ensure that the insights are delivered to the IoT system in a
    timely manner and that the IoT system can respond accordingly. Several architectures
    and protocols can be used to achieve seamless integration between ML-generated
    insights and IoT-enabled irrigation control systems. Two common options include
    MQTT and CoAP.


    **MQTT (Message Queuing Telemetry Transport)** is a lightweight publish/subscribe
    messaging protocol that is well-suited for IoT applications. MQTT uses a broker
    to facilitate communication between publishers and subscribers. Publishers send
    messages to the broker, which then forwards the messages to all subscribers that
    have subscribed to the relevant topic. MQTT is a simple and efficient protocol
    that is well-suited for applications where low latency and reliability are not
    critical. MQTT is used for lightweight, real-time communication between devices
    and the cloud. It is a publish/subscribe protocol that allows devices to send
    data to the cloud and receive commands from the cloud.


    **CoAP (Constrained Application Protocol)** is a specialized web transfer protocol
    for constrained devices. CoAP is based on the Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP)
    but is designed to be more efficient and lightweight. CoAP uses a request/response
    model and supports a variety of message formats, including JSON and XML. CoAP
    is a good choice for applications where devices have limited resources, such as
    low power and memory. CoAP is a lightweight application protocol that is designed
    for resource-constrained devices. It is based on the HTTP protocol but is optimized
    for low-power devices with limited memory and processing power.


    Both MQTT and CoAP are suitable for integrating ML-generated insights with IoT-enabled
    irrigation control systems. The choice of which protocol to use will depend on
    the specific requirements of the application. For example, if low latency and
    reliability are important, then MQTT may be a better choice. If the devices have
    limited resources, then CoAP may be a better choice.'

    Figures References Citations Keywords Metrics Footnotes Abstract: The advancement
    of technologies over years has poised Internet of Things (IoT) to scoop out untapped
    information and communication technology opportunities. It is anticipated that
    IoT will handle the gigantic network of billions of devices to deliver plenty
    of smart services to the users. Undoubtedly, this will make our life more resourceful
    but at the cost of high energy consumption and carbon footprint. Consequently,
    there is a high demand for green communication to reduce energy consumption, which
    requires optimal resource availability and controlled power levels. In contrast
    to this, IoT devices are constrained in terms of resources-memory, power, and
    computation. Low power wide area (LPWA) technology is a response to the need for
    efficient utilization of power resource, as it evinces characteristics such as
    the capability to proffer low power connectivity to a huge number of devices spread
    over wide geographical areas at low cost. Various LPWA technologies, such as LoRa
    and SigFox, exist in the market, offering a proficient solution to the users.
    However, in order to abstain the need of new infrastructure (like base station)
    that is required for proprietary technologies, a new cellular-based licensed technology,
    narrowband IoT (NBIoT), is introduced by 3GPP in Rel-13. This technology presents
    a good candidature to handle LPWA market because of its characteristics like enhanced
    indoor coverage, low power consumption, latency insensitivity, and massive connection
    support towards NBIoT. This survey presents a profound view of IoT and NBIoT,
    subsuming their technical features, resource allocation, and energy-efficiency
    techniques and applications. The challenges that hinder the NBIoT path to success
    are also identified and discussed. In this paper, two novel energy-efficient techniques
    “zonal thermal pattern analysis” and energy-efficient adaptive health monitoring
    system have been proposed towards green IoT. Topic: Towards Service-Centric Internet

    I. Introduction 5G is on the purview where IoT will seize the stage spotlight,
    as IoT devices would form a notable segment of the 5G network. The radical evolution
    of the current Internet into a network of interconnected objects harvest information
    from the environment and interact with the physical world. The mammoth interest
    of connecting sensors, actuators, meters cars, appliances, and so on with internet,
    results in the Internet of Things [1], [2]. According to IEA-4E (Electronic device
    and network annex), the number of network connected devices will be 50 billion
    by 2020 [3]. Thus enterprises ushers into the modern era of automation to evidently
    change our daily lives by providing solution related to multiple sectors of health,
    agriculture, retail, vehicular, industry, power grid, underwater, buildings, homes,
    environment, transportation, smart home [4]. By 2024 itself, it is expected that
    the IoT industry will generate a revenue of USD4.3 billion [5] and it’s expected
    to grow over years. However, deployment of gigantic IoT ecosystem brings in various
    challenges to handle such as cost-efficient robust and flexible connectivity,
    interoperability of heterogeneous hardware, diverse security mechanism [6], and
    long battery life. However, the major deployment obstruction is due to constrained
    resources availability for IoT devices i.e. limited energy, limited computation,
    and limited processing capabilities [7]. Most importantly the flavor of IoT gets
    bitter, especially due to limited energy as this leads to unanticipated human
    intervention. Hence the burning issue of efficient utilization of energy is getting
    anomalous traction from academics and industry. In literature, various techniques
    have been proposed to tackle this critical issue such as energy harvesting, sporadic
    transmission, resource allocation, clustering, etc. Ju and Zhang [8] suggested
    the technique of predictive analysis with energy harvesting to obsolete the battery
    from IoT device. Na et al. [9] suggested a technique to charge the device wirelessly
    using RF. Further, a power-aware connectivity using Spanning tree algorithm is
    suggested by Karthikeya et al. [10]. Shafiee et al. [11] designed a circuit to
    manage the power of the device where a source of energy is ambient. Another crucial
    challenge is to handle the diverse requirement of wide range of IoT applications.
    Today there are two evident classes of IoT applications: Critical IoT and Massive
    IoT. Critical IoT applications such as autonomous driving or remote surgery require
    very low latency with ultra-high reliability. Massive IoT (M-IoT) applications
    like smart building, logistics, tracking and fleet management, smart agriculture,
    etc. require low cost device with reduced complexity that consumes low power,
    wide coverage including uncovered areas and performance flexibility to handle
    multiple application with different latency and throughput requirement. According
    to current statics, low data rate (<100kbps) applications i.e. M-IoT, are expected
    to form 60% of IoT connections in 2020 in comparison to medium and high data rate
    applications [12]. Hence most of the traffic will originate from cost-effective
    low-bit-rate services that will serve the connected world. Since massive communication
    between various low power IoT devices is different from H2H (Human-to-Human) in
    terms of delay sensitivity and traffic pattern, thus could not be supported by
    cellular technologies adequately. As they are designed for the different category
    of terminal that operates at a high data rate and consumes high power their device
    complexity is also high and thereby their cost, though it will aid in deployment
    of IoT. Apart from this, technologies such as Wi-Fi, BLE, ZigBee, etc., offer
    short range communications though consume less power. However, if deployed repeatedly
    will increase the cost. Hence not a cost effective solution for applications with
    wide coverage range requirements like M-IoT. Thus a technology is required that
    could support massive connection at reduced cost with low power consumption &
    provide enhanced coverage [13]. LPWAN technologies are one that could support
    this emerging market as it allows low power device to communicate at low data
    rate over wide area with radius of several kilometers. LPWA proffers abilities
    like Indoor penetration: as it uses Sub-1GHz band, the signal propagates more
    reliably with less power consumption as compared to 2.4GHz signal. Low power consumption
    is achieved at a cost of low data rate and latency on the higher end in seconds
    or minutes. This ability is achieved by using Duty cycling, by using star topology
    (usually), by allowing devices to directly connect to BS (thereby bifurcating
    the need of gateway & relays also) or by reducing burden on the device side(by
    using Fog or edge Computing). Further for Low cost, CAPEX (capital expenditure)
    & OPEX (operational expenditure) is reduced by reducing the complexity of hardware,
    implanting less no of BS (LPWA BS) etc. Massive connections, QoS are two abilities
    where still improvement is required. Standard bodies like ETSI, 3GPP, IEEE, IETF
    are actively working on LPWA technologies. A range of applications such as precision
    monitoring, Smart City, Home Automation, Industrial Asset monitoring, Logistics,
    Wildlife Monitoring, Smart meter, is being catered by LPWA technologies. As the
    LPWA market is expected to rule the market in coming years, hence competition
    among LPWA technologies becoming severe. Recently to improve the foundation of
    IoT through cellular networks, and tussle with existing proprietary LPWA technologies
    (LoRa, SigFox, RPMA, etc.), 3GPP has introduced three technologies in Rel-13 namely
    eMTC (enhanced Machine Type Communication), NB-IoT, EC-GSM (enhanced coverage
    GSM). These cellular technologies will operate in licensed spectrum and will reuse
    the existing LTE infrastructure. Among available connecting technologies, NBIoT
    specifically tailored for emerging M-IoT market is one of the promising massive
    LPWA technology for data perception and acquisition for low data rate applications.
    NBIoT could handle massive connections with low power consumption and provide
    wide area coverage with deep indoor penetration and nomadic mobility [14]–[16].
    Most outstandingly it offers reliable service by using licensed bands and avoid
    congestion problems. NB-IoT reduced the hardware complexity by 90% compared in
    comparison of LTE Cat-1. Moreover, NBIoT can coexist with existing GSM and LTE
    network, hence reduce deployment cost also. Beside this new RAT (Radio Access
    Technology) reduced the signaling required for the transmission of data in the
    conventional system. Altogether NB-IoT can reduce the cost and energy consumption,
    which are the chief limitations of cellular network technology for IoT devices.
    The present communication contributes toward the Next generation Green-NBIoT and
    delivers a comprehensive enriched study of NBIoT. This extensive survey elaborates
    resource allocation and energy efficiency techniques. Along with this a detailed
    comparative analysis of IoT connecting technology with NBIoT is also presented.
    Further, two novel application specific energy efficient approaches are also proposed
    namely “Zonal Thermal pattern Analysis” (ZTPA) and “Energy Efficiency Adaptive
    Health Monitoring System” (E2AHMS). Along with this real time hardware implementation
    of Health application is given to support the proposed energy efficient approach.
    This paper would be beneficial for researchers to get an insight view of NBIoT
    and their respective challenges. A. Market Trends Toward NBIoT IoT market growth
    has accelerated across all verticals in Q1 2018. Low Power Wide Area Network (LPWAN)
    is seen as one of the enablers for IoT. IoT Analytics in their report quoted that
    LPWA connections will have a Compound Annual Growth Rate (CAGR) of 81% during
    2018–2025 [17]. According to Machina in comparison of other LPWAN the share of
    NBIoT alone would be 48% by 2025 (Fig. 1) [18]. According to another statics,
    suggest by IHC the number of NBIoT connections by 2021 will be 141.7 million [19].
    Thereby NBIoT module revenue worldwide might touch the figure of USD 824 million
    by 2020 itself. Out of all NBIoT connections 88% of NBIoT connections will be
    established in Asia itself [20]. Some of the key NBIoT players are Huawei (China),
    Intel (U.S), Ericsson (Sweden), Deutsche Telekom (Germany), Qualcomm (U.S), Vodafone
    (U.K). The growth of NB-IoT standard has increased pressure on proprietary technologies
    especially for LoRaWan and the fact of no of chips shipped in 2017: 2% of SigFox,
    4 % of LTE-M, LoRaWan 58%, LTE-Cat M1 4%, NBIoT 29%, Other 7% [18], are forestalling
    the market drift is building toward NBIoT. FIGURE 1. LPWA technology share by
    2025, machina, 2017 [18]. Show All B. Research Motivation As per literature survey
    and research availability in the area of IoT, a lot of work has been done to deliver
    services like smart health, smart agriculture, smart vehicle, etc. In the current
    scenario, IoT has become the first choice of industry, research and academia.
    However, there exist big gap similar to WSN i.e. energy optimization, energy efficient
    network which acts as a big stumbling block for IoT network. This becomes even
    more challenging as IoT devices have limited resource availability. This motivated
    us to study resource allocation techniques in detail. Furthermore, implementation
    of IoT on a massive scale would inflate carbon emissions in one way or the other.
    Hence to envision the green communication energy efficiency techniques will play
    an important role. Apart from this to cater the new specificities of IoT (i.e.
    low cost devices, wide coverage, long battery life, massive connection support)
    in cost effective way, NBIoT (3GPP standardized LPWA technology) presents good
    candidature. In this paper with an effort toward green IoT, two energy efficiency
    techniques using NBIoT are also proposed related to two specific area Health &
    Agriculture which directly or indirectly impact the human being. C. Contribution
    This review paper contributes toward next generation green communication and in
    support of that two novel energy efficient techniques namely “ZTPA” & “E2AHMS”.
    This review paper will be beneficial for researchers, who want to get a profound
    view of NBIoT. Whilst discussing the recent background of NBIoT, significant challenges
    and open issues related to the real time implementation of NBIoT are identified
    and discussed. In this manuscript, a detailed study related to resource allocation,
    and energy efficiency techniques for both IoT and NBIoT is done. Our main contributions
    can be summarized as follow: The Layered Architecture of IoT is presented to specify
    How IoT works. In addition to this a detailed comparative analysis of NBIoT with
    other low power IoT communication technologies is discussed. To provide an insight
    view of NB-IoT, its background research, architecture, frame structure, physical
    channels, connection process (cell acquisition, random access process, data transfer),
    modes of operation, power consumption using NBIoT, and its applications are discussed
    in detail. The paucity of the resource is not a new challenge for the communication
    network. However, it quite challenging for IoT being so massively interconnected.
    Thus a detailed analysis of resource allocation techniques is discussed related
    to IoT and NBIoT The open issues related NBIoT implementation are then conferred
    The real time implementation of IoT will inflate the CO2 levels in environment
    in different ways which can be controlled by many ways one of it is efficient
    utilization of energy resource. Therefore a literature survey of an energy efficient
    techniques used for IoT are deliberated and role of deep learning in the context
    of power consumption is also discussed. The open issues relate to NBIoT are then
    conferred. Thereafter, Green communication based energy efficient techniques are
    proposed for Smart Agriculture and Smart Health. In addition to this, hardware
    implementation is given to support the proposed energy efficient Smart Health
    technique. The list of ongoing IoT projects is presented to provide the researchers
    and readers the knowledge of current applications being developed. In addition
    to this, a list of simulation tools used is also presented in the appendix section.
    D. Organization This paper is organized as follows. Section II briefly discusses
    the basic layered architecture of IoT and specifies the layer on which NBIoT operates.
    Hereafter comparison of NBIoT with other IoT connecting technologies is discussed
    in section III. Thereafter, NBIoT introduction, background research, standardization
    history from Rel-8 to Rel-15, subsequently architecture, frame structure, physical
    channels and signals used, connection process, modes of operation, power consumption
    using NBIoT, applications of NBIoT, are described in subsections IV-A, IV-B, IV-C,
    IV-D, IV-E, IV-F, IV-G, IV-H, IV-I respectively. Further section V provides a
    comprehensive survey of efficient resource allocation techniques used for NBIoT
    & IoT. Thereafter an overview of energy consumption in a sensor node during different
    phases is presented in section VI. Other than this, a detailed survey of energy
    efficiency techniques for green communication are discussed in detail in section
    VI-A and then the impact of usage of deep learning on power consumption is discussed
    in section-VI-B. Then the open issues related to NBIoT are discussed in section
    VII. Finally, the proposed green communication based energy efficient technique
    for agriculture is discussed in section VIII-A, and for health monitoring is discussed
    in VIII-B. In support of the proposed health technique a real time hardware implementation
    is described in section VIII-C subsuming system model (VIII-C-i), hardware requirement
    (VIII-C-ii), interface (VIII-C-iii), and performance analysis (VIII-C-iv). SECTION
    II. Internet of Things Communication and sensing ability has evolved gradually
    due to advancement in technology. The evolution of IoT (Fig. 2) started with RFID
    (radio frequency identification), which is the first technology to realize the
    machine to machine concept. RFID detects and ascertains the tagged entity wirelessly,
    by the data it transmits. Recently RFID is used in numerous IoT applications such
    as gestural detection [21], patient RFID tracking system [22], and smart restaurant.
    RFID could not sense the critical environment parameters, this stems in the requirement
    of sensing technologies. Hereafter, several technical fields including embedded
    computing, hardware miniaturization, Wireless networking aids in augmentation
    of real-world things capability, to sense, think, process and act, thus making
    things smart. Usually, these smart things have low computation capability thus
    clouds are used to offload the computational task which in turn reduce the energy
    consumption. Today the integration of. RFID, WSN, MCC (mobile cloud computing)
    and advancement in technology generated the umbrella term IoT. This concept is
    significantly revolutionizing the technical and business world, as it can offers
    anytime, anywhere, and anything service. The term IoT was first coined by Kevin
    Aston in 1999 also known as “cyber-physical systems (CPS)” [24]. In this paradigm,
    object/things around us are connected to the internet using Wireless technologies
    like Bluetooth, ZigBee, etc. Many definitions of IoT have been proposed in the
    literature. According to IERC, IoT is “A dynamic global infrastructure with self-configuring
    capabilities based on standard and interoperable communication protocol where
    physical and virtual things have identities, physical attributes, virtual personalities,
    and use intelligent interface and seamlessly integrated into information network”
    [25]. IoT network, comprised of billions of devices is highly heterogeneous. Its
    essence of heterogeneity can be visualized by the fact that devices from different
    vendors would run with diverse platforms even if they’re doing the same task as
    a result will generate radically different ontologies. Thus for IoT to speak a
    common language a unified standardized IoT architecture is required to ensure
    interoperability and security. Many architectural layouts have been proposed for
    IoT but no one has converged to a standardized architecture. Some of the well-known
    IoT architecture such as RAMI 4.0, IIRA, IoT- ARM, P2413, Arrowhead Framework,
    WSO2, Microsoft Azure, Internet-of-everything reference Model, Intel IoT Platform
    Reference Architecture are available. Among variously available architecture this
    paper presents a five-layer architecture (Fig. 3): comprised of Perception Layer,
    network layer, Service management Layer, Application Layer, Business layer [1].
    Perception Layer: This layer is composed of sensor/actuators. Here sensors are
    clustered according to their unique abilities such as body sensors, environmental
    sensors, vehicle parking sensors, home appliance sensors etc. Typically these
    sensors at the perception layer generate electronic signals triggered from physical
    event/condition aggregated at gateways using LAN/PAN technologies like Wi-Fi,
    Ethernet, UWB, ZigBee, BLE, Infrared, etc. FIGURE 2. Roadmap of IoT [2]. Show
    All FIGURE 3. Layered architecture of IoT [23]. Show All Network Layer: This layer
    is responsible to send the PL information to the Internet via one of the communication
    networks such as LAN (WIFI, Ethernet), WAN (3G, LTE, LTE-A, 5G) or satellite network.
    Service Management Layer (SML): On SML services are paired based on addresses
    and it also processes the data received. These services are OSS (Operational Support
    System) which include device modeling, Performance management, Data management
    (periodic/Aperiodic sensed data) etc. (e.g. Nokia OSS which help in generating
    new revenues by handling high capacity.), BSS (Billing Support System) this provide
    billing report, and Security Services. Application Layer: Here application layer
    is classified based on the availability of network, required coverage, heterogeneity,
    etc. Using protocols like MQTT (Message Queue Telemetry Transport), CoAP (Constrained
    Application Protocol) this layer provides the requested service to the user. Business
    Layer: This layer is responsible to analyze data received from the Application
    layer by building the business model, flowcharts, graphs, etc. thereby enable
    to support decision-making processes. Thus IoT flow can be defined as first identification
    (to provide clear identification to each device), then sensing gather data from
    the physical environment), thereafter communication, then integration of service
    and finally extraction of knowledge. The new IoT specificities like low power
    and Wide Range, Low deployment and Operational Costs, Long Battery life (10mA
    RX current, 100nA sleep current), Low bitrates, are different from conventional
    networks in many aspects and brings in many challenges. Beside this massive connectivity
    will further aggravate the problem. However, a solution is appearing on the horizon:
    is 3GPP, NB-IoT which can cater these requirements in an effective manner. As
    IoT has a diverse and wide range of IoT requirement, hence one solution won’t
    fit for all. Therefore in the next section a detail comparative analysis of NBIoT
    and other IoT related technologies is discussed. SECTION III. Comparison of NBIot
    With Other IoT Connecting Technologies A myriad of IoT connectivity solutions
    is available to support a wide range of IoT application with miscellaneous requirements.
    Therefore to select an optimal technology for an application various factors such
    as power consumption, security issues, deployment cost, communication range, data
    rate, throughput, latency are required to be considered [26], [27]. A comparison
    of IoT connecting solutions on pre-specified factor is given in Table 1. Connecting
    Technologies of IoT can be coarsely classified into two categories based on their
    range i.e. short and long range. Wireless technologies such as BLE, ZigBee, Wi-Fi,
    Z-wave, WIMAX, 6LOWPAN, etc. offer short range can be used for applications like
    smart home, factory or supermarket. Whereas, LPWAN technologies such as LoRa,
    SigFox, NBIoT, EC-GSM-IOT, etc. offer long range. Other than the pre-specified
    competing technologies RPMA, Telensa, WAVIoT and Dash 7 are few other competing
    technologies contributing to IoT connectivity [28]. TABLE 1 Comparison of IoT
    Connecting Technologies Among wireless technologies, Wi-Fi uses radio waves for
    communication and operates in either 2.4GHz or 5GHz band. The existing Wi-Fi standards
    802.11 a/b/g/n/ac has constraints in both range and energy efficiency, thus can’t
    be considered apposite for applications with low power consumption requisite.
    Thus IEEE has introduced two new protocols 802.11ah and 802.11ax that can support
    thousands of devices with low power consumption. These two are considered to be
    the biggest move of IEEE towards the massive IoT market. The Wi-Fi standard 802.11ah–HaLow
    provide a range of 1km and can easily penetrate barriers/obstacles at data rate
    ranging from 150kbps to 40Mbps. The 802.11ax solution will provide four time’s
    increased capacity and data rate and improved efficiency. These new solutions
    have great potential to capture the M2M market. Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) is
    another Wireless standard that offers much needed characteristic required for
    most of IoT applications i.e. consumes low power, low cost, but within a short
    range. BLE allows both connectionless and connection-oriented communication. It
    fragments the data into small packets then transmit them over the radio interface.
    This enables BLE to support data services with large packets. It is used in applications
    like wearables, for locating things, etc. Further ZigBee is a simple and low cost
    Wireless option that consumes low power. It is based on IEEE 802 std. and could
    support ~ 65000 nodes/network. Its range can be extended by using repeaters in
    the mesh topology, but this will increase the deployment cost [29]. ZigBee 3.0
    is the new solution introduces, it ensures device interoperability, it is reliable
    robust and above all it is green. Z-Wave is another pioneer for short range communication,
    especially for home-automation industry. As it provides a reliable method to wirelessly
    control multiple home appliances using low-power. Z-Wave operates in the sub-gigahertz
    frequency range, around 900MHz. It can support up to approximately 232 nodes/network.
    The Frequently Listening receiver Slave (FLiRs) enable low latency communication
    by employing unique beaming technology so that device can transit from sleep to
    fully awake modes in one second. Hence suitable for short range IoT application.
    Z-Wave 700 Series, could offer a range of 300 feet, hence can connect gadgets
    placed outside the home and far off into the yard, too [30]. Despite offering
    low power consumption and low cost, Wireless technologies limits in supporting
    long distance communication. Hence offers limited mobility and deployment possibilities
    for the device. Moreover, to extend the range, repeaters are required to be deployed
    densely, thus extortionately expensive. Whereas, LPWA technologies offer mass
    deployment, long range, long battery life, and require low bandwidth. Hence LPWA
    fills a cavity in the landscape of Wireless technologies. LPWAN technologies can
    be categorized into two categories Licensed and Unlicensed. Long Range (LoRa),
    SigFox, RPMA, N-Wave and Dash 7 are unlicensed, NBIoT, EC-GSM-IoT, LTE-M are licensed
    technologies [31], [32]. LoRa is developed by Semtech, to deploy its network it
    is required to get a NetID issued from LoRa Alliance. It uses an Adaptive Data
    Rate (ADR) scheme which helps in extending the battery lifetime. It is based on
    Chirp Spread Spectrum modulation technique, which sustains the same low power
    characteristics as FSK modulation yet considerably increases the communication
    range. LoRa-WAN being asynchronous let devices to remain in sleep mode for a long
    time period as desired by the application. Another advantage of LoRa is its BS
    provide wide coverage. However, as LoRa operates in unlicensed spectrum thus could
    not provide QoS and neither it could support dense network as it employs MAC based
    ALOHA protocol [33]. SigFox is another technology that operates in unlicensed
    sub 1GHz band. It operates on cloud based approach and uses ALOHA like LoRa but
    with a restriction on the maximum number of messages, a device could send. The
    prime advantage of SigFox is it doesn’t spend energy on sensing medium thus saves
    energy. SigFox requires the user to purchase subscription. In order to provide
    long range communication it uses Ultra-Narrow-band modulation and transfers each
    message 100 Hz wide with a data rate of 100/600 bps depending on the region. Ingenu
    is another LPWAN technology offers high throughput, high scalability, and use
    patented Random Phase Multiple Access scheme. RPMA helps in improving SNR by minimizing
    the overlapping between signals transmitted. It is slightly more complex as it
    uses TDMA based MAC protocol to efficiently allocate the radio resource [34].
    Another LPWAN technology WEIGHTLESS-P, uses cognitive radio and TV white-spaces,
    such that devices utilize the bands as an opportunistic user without causing interference
    to the primary user. It supports two way communication thereby acknowledges all
    transmissions, further in order to maintain QoS and to assure reliability Automatic
    retransmission request (ARQ) and Forward Error Correction (FEC) is used [36].
    Taking about existing cellular technology LTE could not provide solutions for
    M-IoT applications i.e. Low power consumption, low data rates, and wider coverage
    at low cost. Thus 3GPP proposed a licensed LTE-M / eMTC, in Rel-12 to cater the
    requirements of machine type communication which has been optimized in Rel-13.
    It leverages the existing LTE network and follows narrowband operation for reception
    and transmission and provides extended coverage. To reduce power consumption it
    used PSM (power saving mode) and edRx mode [37]. NBIoT (Narrow Band IoT), is another
    licensed technology introduced by 3GPP in Rel-13. NB-IoT in comparison to other
    technologies offer mMTC required features at low cost like (i) provide coverage
    in challenging positions like underground or basements; (ii) improved power saving
    mechanisms to enhance the battery life; (iii) network procedures are simplified
    to reduce the UE complexity. Apart from this to support small data transfer it
    has optimized CIoT User Plane and Control Plane Another technology EC-GSM is also
    proposed by 3GPP which is an extension of existing GSM technology. Suitable for
    many applications, but it overburdens the device and network [38]. Conclusion:
    For M-IoT applications, individually all LPWAN technologies are prompt in one
    way or the other for wide range solutions but picking a clear winner is critical.
    LoRa, SigFox being proprietary technology has an established market and giving
    a tough fight to 3GPP NBIoT, EC-GSM-IoT and others also. However proprietary technologies
    operate in Unauthorized/Unlicensed Spectrum that suffers from Duty Cycle constraint.
    Thus affects the transmission time and also bears high interference as spectrum
    is shared between multiple technologies. Whereas, NBIoT operate in licensed spectrum
    and can support massive connections, operates at low data rates (but better than
    LoRa), offer wide coverage with deep indoor penetration, perform well in dense
    area, consumes less power in comparison to LoRa, & SigFox, offers very good link
    budgets and good scalability, provide QoS Apart from this just require a software
    update to LTE or existing RAN infrastructure. Thus ready to immediate role out
    in the market. This is essential for reducing deployment cost and time [39], [40].
    Hence this ascertains that NBIoT has the ability to capture the IoT-LPWAN market
    specifically in comparison to other LPWAN Technologies SECTION IV. NBIoT: Narrow
    Band Internet of Things NB-IoT is the latest technology that is identified and
    standardized in a little time span, in the response of customer requirement and
    pressure to tussle with non-3GPP proprietary technologies. NBIoT can efficiently
    support the market of the M-IoT application. This an independent radio interface,
    tightly connected with LTE, which also shows up in its integration in the current
    LTE specifications [12], [13], [41], [42]. It can address the needs of mMTC (massive
    Machine Type Communication) by following features (Fig. 4): FIGURE 4. NBIoT features.
    Show All NBIoT can support massive connections (more than 52K/channel): as in
    MTC communication model user, transfer small data at low frequency and are insensitive
    to latency so multiple users can camp on one cell. Further, NBIoT supports two
    schemes multi-tone and single-tone transmission. This offers flexibility to schedule
    12 subcarriers with sub spacing of 15 kHz or 48 subcarriers with sub spacing of
    3.75 kHz with single tone scheduling. Hence eNodeB could support large no of users
    in parallel. NBIoT uses a bandwidth of 180 KHz and operates in HD-FDD: In NBIoT,
    UL/DL bandwidth is restricted to 180 kHz. Hence less complex transceiver is used.
    Further, the device operates in Half Duplex mode, thus can’t receive and transmit
    simultaneously. This further decrease device cost, as no duplexer will be required.
    NBIoT design objective is to provide prolonged battery life: For long battery
    life, power Consumption is reduced by using eDRX (extended discontinuous reception)
    and PSM (power saving modes) features. In extended discontinuous reception, the
    UE monitors the paging channel periodically. Whereas in PSM, the device remains
    in receiving state. NBIoT provides extend coverage range of 20dB as compare to
    GPRS (especially deep indoor penetration): To provide the wide coverage the transport
    block can be transmitted multiple times i.e. 128 times in UL and 2048 in DL. Hence
    improves Signal to noise-interference ratio (SINR) and enable proper decoding
    of the signal. To determine the number of repetitions for coverage extensions,
    three classes are defined CE level 0, CE level 1 and CE level 2. For each of these
    class, the number of repetitions is regulated separately. Beside this soft retransmission
    the network bandwidth is also reduced. Hence based on two features 20 dB coverage
    enhancement is achieved where ~7dB is achieved from network bandwidth reduction
    and ~13 dB from allowed repeated transmissions. NBIoT offers operating mode flexibility:
    In order to coexist with LTE and 2G, three deployment modes are available standalone,
    in-band and standalone. NBIoT doesn’t support higher modulation scheme than QPSK,
    thus keep device complexity low and thereby cost. Moreover, to keep the PAPR (peak
    to average power ratio) low in UL, π /2-BPSK, π /4- QPSK is used. NBIoT supports
    Low-Data-Rate applications, which obsolete the requirement for high-capacity flash
    memory hence reduce the chip area and thereby the cost of devices. NBIoT operates
    in Licensed Band and can provide telecommunication level of security. NBIoT achieved
    signaling optimization: In addition to existing RRC, NBIoT uses DONAS (data over
    non access stratum) and RRC (radio resource control) suspend/resume for signaling
    optimization. Where DONAS enable the user to transmit data without activating
    a user plane and support sporadic data transmissions also. The RRC suspend/resume
    is a user plane optimization procedure that introduced an efficient way to disable
    and restore the user plane. Further, NB-IoT is designed for sporadic and small
    messages transmission among the device and the network. It is presumed that the
    device can exchange small messages via one cell, therefore obsolete the requirement
    of handoffs. However, if required then it needs to first go in idle state and
    then restart the cell selection process. Besides this, it doesn’t support other
    EUTRA functions like Inter-RAT-mobility, handover, dual connectivity, CQI (Channel
    Quality Indicator) reporting. A. Background of NBIoT NBIoT is in the initial state
    of deployment, still, there is room for optimization. The miscellaneous work carried
    out in the context of NBIoT optimization is discussed in this section. Song et
    al. [43] proposed an indoor localization algorithm for NB-IoT system using Channel
    state information (CSI) fingerprinting. The proposed algorithm will estimate the
    position with less complexity by observing the similarity between two CSI values
    and then convert the similar value to a relative value. To improve estimation
    of position, triangular centroid algorithm and K nearest neighbor is used. As
    a result, the position error was reduced in comparison to existing techniques.
    Further, to enable a node, in an idle state to transmit the data. Lin et al. [44]
    proposed an efficient SDT (Smallest Data Transmission) technique to increase the
    number of the supportable device. In this eNB will broadcast the maximum SDT size
    in SIB (system information block), and also a group of SDT ids with it. Thereafter,
    UE will check the SDT value and determine whether to use this technique or not.
    If suitable then send the RA response. Successively, eNB will acknowledge by sending
    RA response comprised of uplink resource grant. UE on successful reception will
    send the PDU and starts the timer. Upon receiving the response within time, UE
    compares its id with group ids. As a result, authors found that more devices could
    be supported in comparison of conventional control plane solutions, whilst using
    limited uplink resources. However massive connection results in the high probability
    of collision thus Kim et al. [45] proposed an enhanced Access- Reservation-Protocol
    (EARP) with a partial preamble transmission mechanism. The proposed protocol although
    reduced the collision probability but at the cost of abdication of the detection
    ability. Authors found that EARP would results in effective resource utilization
    in reference to system load. When the load will be less then it will reduces the
    probability of misdetection. On the other hand, when a heavy load would be there,
    the collision probability gets reduced although the detection probability get
    deteriorates. Further Zhang et al. [46] done an analysis of interference caused
    by the NBIoT user equipment to that of LTE users. Authors considered only in-band
    and guard band for analysis and proposed an algorithm for removal of ISI or channel
    equalization. On the basis of observation, the authors stated that LTE-UE performance
    degrades due to the different sampling rate of NBIoT user. In addition to this,
    the level of interference depends upon specifically two important factors. First
    due to attenuation of power and second is due to guard band. A critical observation
    about bit error rate is made for an LTE device i.e. its BER will improve as guard-band
    bandwidth increases although for IoT devices BER remains unaffected. Liu et al.
    [47] taking the same issue of interference between NBIoT and LTE devices have
    proposed a framework based on Block Sparse Bayesian Learning (BSBL) and two algorithms
    for recovery of signals. Authors observed that by canceling the interfering NB-IoT
    signal, LTE device could operate more effectively. Further, Lin et al. [48] proposed
    a single tone design for NPRACH (narrowband physical random access channel) and
    this work was integrated into 3GPP Rel-13. To reduce the overhead due to cyclic
    prefix (CP) N-samples are repeated n times and then collectively CP corresponding
    to these samples is added, as a result, the length of CP got reduced. After this
    single carrier hopping is used where within symbols fixed hopping is used and
    among different symbol groups, pseudo-random hopping is applied. Further, the
    time of arrival (ToA) & carrier frequency offset (CFO) is jointly estimated to
    determine the midsection and false alarm. As a result, the authors observed that
    using the proposed design the probability of detection increased up to 99% and
    the probability of false-alarm reduced immensely below 0.1%. Further, Yang et
    al. [49] suggested using effective bandwidth (EB) to collectively handle all the
    components of LPWAN i.e. battery life, coverage, Tx (transmission) bandwidth,
    spectral efficiency. According to the suggested, concept if Tx bandwidth would
    be greater than EB, this would ultimately reduce the system capacity. On the other
    hand, if Tx would be less than EB, this would entail more Tx time. However, the
    journey of optimization doesn’t end here. There are various open issues that are
    still required to be addressed to envisage NBIoT success. Some of them are discussed
    in section VII. B. History of Standardization Before standardization, of NBIoT.
    It was proposed in two formats. NBIoT-OFDMA and NBIoT-M2M in 2014. Where QUALCOMM
    offered NBIoT-OFDMA & Huawei and Vodafone collectively offered NBIoT-M2M. These
    two formats were clubbed together to form NB-CIoT (NB cellular IoT), which require
    a new chipset and has no backward compatibility with previous LTE Rel (8-12).
    Further, another format NBIoT-LTE was proposed in 2015 which is fully compatible
    with existing LTE specifications. Then finally in 2016, 3GPP after agreeing on
    two proposals gave standardized technology NBIoT. This technology has evolved
    over years of improvement. In this section, the roadmap of standardization (from
    Rel-8 to 15) is discussed to determine the improvement made (in these Rel) to
    support MTC. Well standardization of LTE started in 2005 when 3GPP started depth
    research for MTC on CN. In 2009, Rel-8 was standardization [50] and brought in
    the feature like peak DL data rate of 300Mbps with an ability to operate in paired
    and unpaired frequency band. Thus have spectral flexibility with bandwidth ranging
    from 1.4 to 20 MHz A new IP based network was introduced i.e. LTE, was a significant
    step toward the IMT-A. In addition to this, to cater the need of multiple users,
    multiple antenna scenario came in to picture since the first Rel of 3GPP [51].
    However the basic requirement of low cost device and power issues left unattended.
    Thereafter Rel-9 standardized in 2010 in which LTE evolved to LTE-Advance and
    introduced additional features such as public warning system (PWS), location Identification
    service, SON (Self Organizing Network) feature to improve the network configuration,
    added new spectrum bands. Further in 2011 Rel-10 (also known as LTE-Advanced)
    was launched to extensively improve the throughput of the LTE system. For evaluation
    of Rel-10, it was submitted to ITU-R in 2010. In Rel-10, to enhance the bandwidth
    and bitrate, Carrier Aggregation was used for both TDD & FDD [52] and to reduce
    the interference, eICIC (enhanced Inter-Cell Interference Coordination) was added,
    where ABS (Almost Blank Subframes) is used to confine the data to the specific
    layer of the cell. Other features like eMIMO, etc. were also introduced. Further,
    Rel-11 [53] got frozen in 2013. An important feature CoMP (Co-ordinated Multi
    Point operation) was announced to facilitate the scheduling of multiple carriers.
    EPDCCH (Enhanced Physical Downlink Control Channel) was added to increase DLC
    (downlink-Capacity). Furthermore, Rel-12 [54], [55] got standardized in 2015.
    In this NAICS (Network Assisted Interference Cancellation and Suppression) was
    added to manage interference. To achieve QoE, naïve UE categories were introduced
    with 50% reduced cost in comparison to Rel-8, cat-1 devices. In support of machine
    type communication, PSM (power saving mode) was also introduced to conserve energy.
    Finally in Rel 13 [56], [57] to further cater the need of Machine to machine type
    communication, a new feature added to existing Rel-8-12: SCPTM (single cell point
    to multi-point), indoor-positioning, reduced latency, Dual connectivity and enhanced
    CA. LAA (licensed assisted access) was also introduced to allow operators to offload
    traffic to the femtocell, devoid of WLAN Two naïve category of devices were introduced
    in Rel 13 Cat-M1 (eMTC) and Cat-NB1 (NBIoT). Where the system bandwidth was confined
    to 1.4 MHz and coverage range was enhanced by 15 dB for Cat-M1 devices. Altogether
    reduced the device complexity and cost enabled operators to reach terminal devices
    in poor coverage range like in basements. For assurance of long battery life eDRX
    (extended Discontinuous Reception) feature was introduced that monitors the DL
    signals for only a short span of time otherwise keep the device in the sleep state.
    For the further evolution of LTE to support mMTC Rel-14 is also standardized with
    more technologies and improvement in existing features such as Additional Broadcast
    services, enhanced positioning, reduced latency, and massive multi antenna system.
    Currently, Rel-15 is under standardization process and expected to get standardize
    by September 2018 [56]. The expected features of Rel-15 are also enlisted in Table
    2. TABLE 2 Standardization History Toward NBIoT [12] C. NBIoT Network Architecture
    The architecture of NBIoT is shown in Fig. 5, NBIoT has simplified the EPC architecture
    to support the small data transmissions required for M-IoT applications in the
    form of User Plane and the Control Plane EPC optimization. FIGURE 5. NBIoT architecture
    [58]. Show All Here NB-IoT device or user equipment communicates with the eNodeB
    thereafter eNodeB connects with the IoT evolved packet core (EPC). This is comprised
    of entities: the Serving GW, the Packet Data Network GW, the Mobility management
    plane entity, the Home Subscriber server. After this eNodeB transfers the NAS
    (non-access stratum, a signaling message) to EPC using s1-lite (an optimized version
    of S1-Control-Plane and support efficient data handling). Basically, NAS is a
    protocol that transfers the non-radio signal between the user equipment and MME,
    which carries data for session and mobility management. Further to continue the
    processing EPC looks for stratum and then pass it to IoT platform. IoT platform
    forwards the data to application servers in supported form. This data is then
    processed by the Application server [58]. There are two ways in which data could
    be transmitted between NBIoT device and application server i.e. IP based and Non-IP
    based. However, Non-IP based is more endorsed since it reduces the overhead of
    user equipment and transmission is also more secure as only one target IP is supported.
    D. NBIoT Frame Structure Downlink: The frame structure of NBIoT DL is identical
    to LTE. In Time domain a radio frame is comprised of 10 Subframes, each having
    length of 1ms and each subframe consists of 2 slots with a time slot of seven
    OFDM symbols (Fig. 6 A) Here each OFDM symbol with in a frame is denoted by a
    number in the range 0 to 13. Further, the number of these radio frames is referred
    as the system frame number (SFN) which ranges from 0 to 1023. Once the SFN counter
    reaches the value of 1023, the counter is reset to 0 and thereafter the hyper
    SFN counter is increased. The hyper SFN ranges between 0 and 1023. Within each
    radio frame, the sub frames are labeled as 0 to 9 and the slots as 0 to 19. In
    Frequency domain, one physical resource block consists of 12 consecutive subcarriers
    with a spacing of 15 kHz [40]. FIGURE 6. Frame structure of NBIoT [59]. Show All
    Uplink: The UL resource grid has two subcarrier spacing options i.e.15 kHz and
    3.75 kHz. In time domain: with a subcarrier spacing of 15 kHz each slot has a
    duration of.5ms, the number of subcarriers will be 12 which is similar to the
    time domain. However, for the 3.75 kHz subcarrier spacing, total number of subcarriers
    in the frequency domain is 4 times i.e. 12*4=48 subcarriers. The slot duration
    will be of 2ms [40]. E. Physical Channels and Signals 1) Uplink Channels and Signals
    Since NBIoT enabled UE’s operates in extreme coverage areas and have limited power
    to operate. Pertaining to this, to reduce the power consumption and complexity
    UE is no longer asked to report a channel, thus their functionality reduced to
    send acknowledgment and No- acknowledgment. Apart from this the need of control
    channel is also obsoleted and only two UL channels are supported namely NPRACH,
    NPUSCH. a: NPRACH: Narrowband Physical Random-Access Channel NPRACH refers to
    the time frequency resource which occupies contiguous set of subcarriers either
    12, 24, 36 or 48 and used to transmit random access preambles. This preamble consist
    of four symbol groups, each group comprised of one Cycle Prefix (CP) and 5 symbols
    [48]. These preambles are repeated with a periodicity from 0.04 s to 2.56 s. The
    eNB uses the random access preamble sent by a user terminal to estimate the uplink
    timing. To start the random access process the preamble is transmitted with a
    duration of 5.6ms or 6.4ms. Further in order to support different cell size two
    CP lengths are specified in NPRACH, 66.67 μs and 266.7 μs . Where 66.67 μs is
    used for cells with radii not more than 8 km and 266.7 μs is used for cell with
    radii range of 8 – 35 km. Each symbol is modulated on a 3.75 kHz tone, which hops
    from one tone to another within twelve contiguous subcarriers. Further for efficient
    estimation of TOA (Time of Arrival) and to achieve improved synchronization between
    UE and eNB, frequency hopping is used. For this two layer hopping pattern is defined
    i.e. inner hopping & output hopping. In order to provide wide TOA range, inner
    hopping is used with fixed (for simplicity) and small values. However, an output
    hopping layer accounts to improve the accuracy of TOA estimation. Furthermore
    to alleviate cell interference between neighboring cells, the pseudo random hopping
    pattern is also used which has been inherited from the LTE PUSCH hopping. Finally
    to support coverage extension of +20dB GPRS, the preamble of four symbol groups
    can be repeated up to 128 times [59]. b: NPUSCH: Narrowband Physical Uplink Shared
    Channel The NPUSCH supports single tone transmission with either 3.75 kHz or 15
    kHz and multitone bandwidth using 15 kHz subcarrier spacing. The NPUSCH has two
    formats. Format 1 carries the actual data in the uplink with maximum transmission
    block size of 1000 bits. Format1 facilitate multitone transmission with 3,6,12
    tones. Other than this to decrease the PAPR (Peak to Average Power ratio the modulation
    scheme π /2-BPSK or π /4-QPSK is used for single-tone and QPSK is used for multi-tone
    for NPUSCH Format 1. Furthermore, Format 2 carries control information, supports
    single-tone transmission only and carries 1-bit UCI that corresponds to hybrid
    automatic repeat request (HARQ) feedback for NB-PDSCH transmission block. Table
    3 describes the format 1 and format 2. Typically the NPUSCH is designed to provide
    long battery life, massive capacity and extended coverage [14], [59]. TABLE 3
    NPUSCH Format [59] c: DMRS: Demodulation Reference Signal In LTE, DMRS is used
    to obtain channel response for PUSCH. Similar to enable eNB to estimate the UL
    channel, the NBIoT-UE transmits a demodulation reference signal (DMRS) which is
    multiplexed with the NPUSCH symbols. Thereby depending on Format of NPUSCH (ie.
    Format 1or Format 2), (Fig. 7) 1or 3 symbols per SC-FDMA slot are utilized to
    transmit the DMRS. With 15 kHz subcarrier spacing DMRS is allocated to symbol
    #3 of every 7 symbols and for 3.75 kHz subcarrier spacing. DMRS is allocated to
    5th symbol of every 7 symbols for data transmission [40]. FIGURE 7. DMRS allocation
    in 15 kHz &3.75 kHz subcarrier spacing [60]. Show All 2) Downlink Channels and
    Signals The NBIoT physical downlink channels are QPSK modulated. The downlink
    designs of NB-IoT MAC and PHY are analogous to the LTE. However, NB-IoT has fewer
    downlink physical channels as compared to LTE. For example, NBIoT doesn’t use
    PMCH (Physical Multicast Channel) as it doesn’t support multimedia broadcast/multicast
    services (till Rel-13) [61], [62]. a: DL Synchronization Signals The downlink
    synchronization signals allow a device to synchronize to NBIoT cell. However,
    the detection of these signals is a challenging task. As when a device with low-power
    oscillator wakes up after a long period of deep sleep, the time base will not
    have a valid reference then, and the frequency base perhaps off by as ~20 ppm.
    Hence a large offset may exist between the device and the network time and frequency,
    which will seriously harm the acquisition performance. The frequency offset is
    due to factors such as temperature, crystal aging, etc. Out of all “temperature”
    is the crucial factor that majorly affects the accuracy, and hence required to
    be compensated in real time. Depending on the quality of the crystal the offset
    ranges from ±5 ppm to ±100 ppm [63], [64]. Hence to detect with large frequency
    offset NBIoT new Synchronization signals NPSS (Narrowband Primary Synchronization
    Signal) is designed which is transmitted in Subframe 5 of duration 1 ms with a
    sequence pattern periodicity of 10 ms and subcarrier spaced at 15 kHz. The hierarchical
    sequence of NPSS is generated using (1) [65] P k (l)=Q(k) e −jπul(l+1)/ 11 , (1)
    View Source Where Q(k)= {1, 1, 1, 1,−1,−1, 1, 1,−1, 1} is the modulation sequence,
    1≤l≤11 (length), 3≤k≤14 (OFDM symbols) and u=5 is the root sequence. Its detection
    is a demanding computational operation from UE perspective. This detection may
    account for at least 24% of the power consumption. However, to keep the device
    complexity low, devices are required to search for only one NPSS as all the cells
    use the same NPSS in NB-IoT network. In contrast to this LTE network uses three
    PSSs. Although, in order to get one copy of NPSS, 19,200 samples need to be captured
    with a sub-frame of the length of 10 ms, with 1.92 MHz sampling rate. Hereafter
    to ascertain the cell identity out of 504 cell-ids available and to acquire additional
    information about the frame structure NSSS (Narrowband Secondary Synchronization
    Signal) is used. It is transmitted in subframe 9 with a subframe periodicity of
    20ms. Hence NSSS sequences are transmitted four times in 80-ms repetition interval
    are differentiated by the phase shift. It uses the last 11 OFDM symbols that consist
    of 132 resource elements overall. Unlike legacy LTE, cell ID is enclosed in the
    secondary sequence without including the primary sequence. NSSS, ZC 131 (Zadoff-Chu
    sequence) is constructed to indicate cell-ids [65] R(m)= b q (n) e −j2π θ f m
    e −j π μm ′ ( m ′ +1) 131 (2) View Source Where AbbreviationExpansion m = 0,1,…..,131

    ID 126 ⌋ , is cell specific parameter θ f = 31 132 ( n f / 2)mod4 , the cyclic
    shift, here n f is SFN, b q , binary scrambling sequence of 128-bits which is
    obtained based on length-128 WalsheHadamard. Hereafter NSSS is mapped to in radio
    frames having n f mod2=0 . b: Physical Channels i) NBPBCH: Narrow-Band Physical
    Broadcast Channel NB-PBCH reside in subframe 0 in every radio frame and carries
    the MIB (Master Information Block). It provide information about system bandwidth,
    SFN (system Frame Number), No of antenna ports. NB-PBCH, MIB consists of 8 independently
    decodable blocks of each of 80 ms duration. Where each block is repeated 8 times
    consecutively to manage with extreme coverage conditions. Hence MIB remains unchanged
    for the time span of 640 ms (Fig. 9). The NB-IOT determines the number of cell
    antenna ports whilst demodulating MIB information. Other than this MIB also provide
    information about operation mode. NB-PBCH reuses the functionalities from legacy
    LTE PBCH such as CRC generation and attachment, Tail biting convolutional encoding,
    Rate matching, Scrambling, Modulation, Layer mapping. FIGURE 8. NPSS & NSSS subframe
    [61]. Show All FIGURE 9. Mapping of NBPBCH [59]. Show All ii) NPDCCH: Narrowband
    Physical Downlink Control Channel The NPDCCH is used to carry DCI (Downlink Control
    Information). Basically, a device needs to monitor NPDCCH to obtain three types
    of information mentioned below. NBIoT has own control channel different from LTE-MTC
    system, although some features have been inherited. Typically NPDCCH is apt for
    transporting scheduling information. Moreover, as NBIoT supports only HDD mode
    thus transmission of NPDCCH is packet based [63]. Besides this to keep the power
    consumption low on UE side, the payload size of DCI (downlink control information)
    is kept up to 23 bits for UL grant or DL assignment for NPDCCH. Hence three new
    DCI formats have been defined as Format N0, Format N1, and Format N2. The usage
    of these formats is specified in Table 4. Further, NPDCCH consists of Narrowband
    control channel elements (NCCEs) where resource elements are mapped. A subframe
    has two NCCEs, analogous to the upper six and lower six subcarriers and for NCCE
    mapping (Fig. 10). TABLE 4 DCI Formats [14], [61] FIGURE 10. NPDCCH subframe structure
    [62]. Show All iii) Narrowband Physical Downlink Shared Channel (NPDSCH) The NPDSCH
    is the core data bearing channel used for transmission of unicast data, broadcast
    information such as SI (System Information) messages. It segments the data packet
    received from higher layer into transmission blocks and transmits one at a time.
    The resource mapping is done in an almost similar manner as NPDCCH beside two
    differences. One, that NPDSCH carry only one TB (maximum TB size is limited to
    680 bits) though NPDCCH can multiplex resources in a subframe to transmit two
    DCI messages. Secondly, if the subframe transmits the SIB1-NB then starting OFDM
    symbol in an NPDCCH subframe will be different from NPDSCH subframe in the in-band
    mode. The NPDSCH TB is processed as follows. Firstly, the CRC of 24-bit is evaluated
    and then attached to the TB. Then TB is encoded via the tail biting convolutional
    coding encoder and rate-matched owing to code-word length deduced collectively
    from the number of NPDSCH sub-frames assigned to the TB and on the basis of the
    number of REs per subframe. Accordingly, the coding rate is determined by size
    of TB and the number of NPDSCH Subframes allotted to the TB combination. Henceforward
    before mapping the encoded TB bits to QPSK symbols, the bits are scrambled i.e.
    the subframe is repeated min (NREP, 4) times before the mapping of the code word
    continues. For each repetition, the scrambling code differs. The maximum no of
    repetitions allowed are 2048 to achieve the SNR of −12.6dB. The repeated Subframes
    allow a device to decode the code word before the transmission completes [64].
    F. NBIoT Connection Process 1) Cell Selection Process A device can be in idle
    or connected mode while looking for the cell to camp on. If the device wakes up
    from a deep sleep then it obtains the information about most recently used (MRU)
    cells using cell selection protocols. In case none of the cell is found suitable
    or if device is powered on for the first time, it is required to perform a full
    frequency scan to find a new cell to camp on. The fundamental purpose of cell
    selection is to identify and synchronize to a suitable NB-IoT cell. In this context,
    the first foremost step is to time synchronize and then obtain a CFO estimated
    value. In order to achieve NPSS synchronization, its autocorrelation properties
    must be exploited. Hence when device achieves the time synchronization, then using
    next frames it determines the CFO. For device located in extreme coverage conditions,
    large number of NPSS frames are required to be detected. Once the symbol time
    is determined and the CFO is compensated for in-band or guard-band, still, an
    additional raster offset will exist up to 7.5 kHz. Consequently, this raster offset
    drifts the symbol time either in the forward or backward direction due to overcompensation
    or under compensation of the carrier frequency respectively. As a result, there
    is severe degradation in the performance of NPBCH detection, which may introduce
    latency greater than the length of CP (Cyclic Prefix) and subsequently leading
    to loss of orthogonality of OFDM symbol lost in the downlink. Hence to improve
    the detection performance device complexity must be increased so that it may do
    hypothesis testing of set of raster offset. Once the NPSS synchronization is achieved
    the device has the knowledge of subframe #9, however, a device has information,
    whether the radio frame is odd or even numbered. As NBIoT has 504 Cell-ids, thus
    NSSS detection algorithm will form 4032 hypothesis in total. Thereafter correlating
    the received signal corresponding to each hypothesis with NSSS waveform allow
    a device to detect the Cell-id. Hereafter device has Cell-id and also has information
    about the placement of NRS. Now the NBPCH is demodulated to obtain MIB-NB for
    this the device needs to form eight hypotheses hence also referred as blind decoding.
    The MIB-NB contains 34 bits and is transmitted over 64 radio frames. The foremost
    information acquired from MIB are a) Operation mode indicated by 7 bits i.e. stand-alone,
    in-band, guard-band. b) Information about SIB1 scheduling indicated by 4 bits.
    c) SI value tag indicated by 5 bits d) Access barring (AB) information enabled
    or not is indicated by 1 bit. e) System Timing: 4 MSBs of the SFN and 2 LSBs of
    the H-SFN. f) 11 spare bits used for future extensions. In addition to this, the
    transport block size and the number of repetitions is also indicated in the MIB.
    Hence acquiring the MIB-NB, a device can locate and decode SIB1-NB. An SIB1-NB
    carries 8 MSBs of the H-SFN, tracking area, a 28-bit long cell-id, and scheduling
    information regarding other SIB to unambiguously ascertain a cell within a PLMN.
    The SIB1-NB transmitted in subframe #4 of every other frame in 16 continuous frames.
    Beside this, it is transmitted at a fixed schedule with a periodicity of 2560
    ms (256 Radio Frames). To determine the first frame for transmission of SIB1,
    cell-id is used. Hereafter acquiring SIB1-NB, the device achieves the complete
    synchronization. If any change occurs it will be indicated either by paging or
    by changing the tag values. In a manner, the device has accomplished time and
    frequency synchronization with errors that will not significantly degrade the
    performance in successive transmissions and receptions during connected or idle
    mode operations [65], [66]. Fig. 11 (a) describes the cell acquisition process.
    FIGURE 11. (a) Cell acquisition process [66]. (b) Random access procedure [69].
    (c) Connection Establishment [70]. (d) Data transmission [73]. Show All 2) Random
    Access Procedure Random Access procedure is initiated by the MAC layer itself
    or by its sublayer RRC. Before initialization of this process, UE has information
    about the available set of PRACH resources. The principles to select PRACH resource
    is based on received signal received power (RSRP) measurement that specify the
    enhanced coverage level supported by the Serving Cell. A device uses two threshold
    values supported by serving cell to determine the NPRACH configuration. Besides
    this, the RSRP thresholds are used by the network to analyze the maximum coupling
    loss corresponding to different coverage levels. In NBIoT the eNB can support
    max 3 number of NPRACH repetitions out of {1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, and 64}. Hereafter
    acquiring the CE level information UE instructs the physical layer to transmit
    a preamble while specifying the number of repetitions required for transmission
    per preamble, preamble index and preamble received target power. For CE level
    0, the preamble received target power (PRTP) is set to PRTP-10 * log10 (number-of-Repetition-Per-Preamble-Attempt)
    whereas for other CE levels PRTP is set to the UE maximum output power [67], [68].
    In NPRACH, RA preamble is transmitted to determine the transmission time of the
    device to eNodeB. On each symbol group of RA preamble frequency hopping is applied
    so that individual group is transmitted on a different subcarrier. Hereafter transmitting
    the preamble, RA-RNTI (Random Access-Radio Network Temporary Identifier) is computed
    using RA-RNTI = 1+floor (SFN_id/4), here SFN_id is the index of the first radio
    frame, then it looks for RAR (Random Access Response) message indicated in DCI
    format N1 scrambled with RA-RNTI transmitted in PDCCH. Nevertheless, if RAR (random
    Access Response) is not received then UE retransmits the preamble. As stated above
    number of retransmissions depend on CE level. However, if the number of attempt
    saturates an associated failure is reported to RRC. Now eNB on receiving the preamble
    sequence transmits the RAR message also referred as Msg 2, to UE which provide
    information about TA (Timing Advance), scheduling information about radio resource
    that device can use to transmit the request for connection, C-RNTI (Cell radius
    Network Temporary identification) as shown in Fig. 11 (b) [69] Now UE transmits
    Msg 3 to eNB on NPUSCH including its identity, C-RNTI MAC CE, submitted from the
    upper layer and start the contention resolution process. In addition to this data,
    the volume parameter is sent to indicate the amount of data present in UE buffer.
    All together will facilitate the BS to take power allocation and scheduling decision
    for subsequent UL transmission. 3) Connection Establishment UE indicates that
    it wants to connect to the network by sending RRC-Connection-Request. In addition
    to the establishment cause, the UE also indicates its capability to support multi-tone
    traffic and multi carrier support. The eNB on receiving connection request, send
    RRC-Connection-Setup message Thereafter UE acknowledges by sending the Connection-setup-
    -complete message and send NAS attach request. The PDN-CONNECTIVITY-REQUEST message
    is piggy-backed in NAS ATTACH REQUEST [70], [71]. The PDN connection is novel
    capability introduced in 3GPP Rel-13 that allow UE to remain attached without
    PDN connection that support CIoT optimization. In this UE is not required to establish
    a PDN connection as part of attach procedure. Moreover UE and MME can release
    the connection without releasing EPS connection. Hence enables large number of
    devices to keep their connection inactive for long duration and seldom transmit
    data over it [72]. Hereafter the EPS authentication process is initiated. After
    that to activate the default EPS bearer CONTEXT REQUEST message is piggybacked
    in NAS: ATTACH ACCEPT. The follow of above discussed steps are discussed in Fig.
    11(c). 4) Small Data Transfer In Rel-13, 3GPP added an ability to send data over
    control Plane. As NBIoT require to transmit the small data sporadically, hence
    to send it in optimized way CIoT EPS optimizations are used which include Control
    Plane and User Plane optimization. In Control Plane optimization, UE sends the
    data packets encapsulated in NAS (Non Access Stratum) to convey non radio signal
    to MME for a service request. In NAS message RAI (Release Assistance Information)
    field indicate the MME that any further UL/DL transmissions are expected. In case
    no further transmission is expected than MME immediately triggers the S1 Release
    procedure. Hence enable MME to reduce the device DRX waiting period during which
    it waits for additional transmission. Besides this, if the size of the data transferred
    via Control Plane exceeds then UE/MME triggers the establishment of User Plane
    bearer between eNB and SGW. User Plane CIoT EPS optimization is an alternative
    procedure which is suitable for short as well as large data transaction. However,
    it requires first to establish RRC connection and create Access Stratum and radio
    bearer between the network and UE. Once the RRC connection is established two
    control procedures Connection suspend and Resume are used [74] G. Modes of Operation
    of NBIoT NBIoT carrier can be deployed in three modes standalone, in-band, and
    guard band. Standalone Operation: In this mode, a separate spectrum is either
    reserved for radio access technology like GSM/UMTS or a dedicated spectrum is
    used for deployment of NBIoT carrier. However, this will escalate the implementation
    cost as software and hardware upgradation will be required for spectrum reframing.
    In Band Operation: In this mode NBIoT carrier is deployed within LTE carrier.
    Sharing of resource block would definitely result in the more efficient use of
    spectrum which in turn will increase the capacity. The LTE bands not utilized
    to carry system information block −1 are used for inband deployment of NBIoT.
    In single tone transmission mode in uplink, there will be interference between
    NB-IoT and LTE (3.75 kHz subcarrier spacing). Although this interference could
    be minimized by scheduling users with similar SNR requirements in NB-IoT and nearby
    LTE PRBs. It’s also a cost effective way as no hardware modifications are required.
    In Guard Band Operation: In this mode NBIoT carrier will be located within guard
    band of LTE carrier to avoid interference. This mode delivers better downlink
    throughput in comparison to in band as more downlink resource is available [75].
    NB-IoT deployment modes offer high flexibility as carrier deployed in one mode
    can continue working via either of the other modes if spectrum migrates to LTE.
    Fig. 12 describes the scenario of different modes. FIGURE 12. Modes of operation
    of NBIoT [75]. Show All H. Low Power Consumption Using NBIoT Saving power of the
    battery powered device is a crucial factor for the realization of LPWAN applications.
    Two main features Power saving mode (introduced in Rel-12) and Extended Discontinuous
    reception RX (introduced in Rel-13) are used to extend the battery life of device
    up to ten or more years (Fig. 13(A) shows the PSM and Fig. 13(B) eDRX mode) [76].
    FIGURE 13. PSM and eDRX modes to save power, [Source: https://www.rohde-schwarz.comRohde&Schwarz].
    Show All A device in PSM goes into deep sleep mode and could not receive any signal.
    Although whilst this mode device can’t be reached but remain registered with the
    network. Thereby PSM eradicates the need for re-establishment of a connection
    when the device wakes up. Hence will not only result in saving power but also
    help in avoiding network congestion (due to different wake-up time). Thus it is
    suitable for application that requires sporadic transmission (e.g. Once a day).
    A device can switch to PSM, proposing two timers T3324 (active timer) and T3412
    (extended timer) and it is attached to TAU. (The maximum time a device could remain
    in the active state is 186 minutes (~T3324) & max sleeping time for a device would
    be 413 days defined by T3412.) However, it’s up to the network to accept the proposed
    timer values or not. Despite this, there is one challenge of using PSM is non
    reachability of device for a long period that needs to be taken care of by opting
    an optimal value to get a good balance between responsiveness and time for the
    device to stay in PSM. Another main feature is eDRX to save power, this in comparison
    to PSM supports DL accessibility significantly. eDRX reduces the periodicity of
    a device to switch in receiving mode and extends the sleep cycle more in idle
    mode than in connected mode. Currently, in LTE, DRX can extend up to 10.24 s whereas
    using eDRX it can be extended for minutes and hours. Thus for synchronization
    between network and device a new clock H-SFN (Hyper System Frame Number) is used.
    A power saving of 43% can be achieved using eDRX with small paging transmission
    window. As power consumption after PTW during deep sleep mode would be extremely
    low. Hence longer the eDRX more would be power saving. In addition to this other
    feature like reduced complexity and reduced overhead of channel measurement also
    reduce the power consumption, hence extends battery life [77]. I. Applications
    of NBIoT The cost effectiveness of NBIoT-network (due to the implementation of
    new software on an existing LTE infrastructure) has inspired several market analyst
    organizations to predict the revenue in the future. NBIoT being a promising technology,
    could support a wide range of applications with increased efficiency. Some of
    the important applications sectors of NBIoT with notable market perspective are
    utility-meter, industry automation, smart logistics, smart cities, waste management,
    environmental monitoring, agriculture and in personal sector like wearables, pet
    tracking, kids monitoring, white goods monitoring (Fig. 14) which provide convenience
    to remotely access of water, gas, electricity, and heat readings even when they
    are located in weak coverage areas like basements. Currently, a Germany based
    company, ista-International GmBH in collaboration with Deutsche Telekom is proving
    a solution for smart buildings by providing smart utility services using NBIoT
    [26]. Other companies such as Eco Mobile from Zagreb, Croatia in collaboration
    with Deutsche Telekom are providing IoT solutions for waste management using NBIoT.
    Here the sensors are used to measure the level of the trash bin and thereafter
    the sensed data using NBIoT sent to cloud, to determine the optimal route. Hence
    reduce logistic cost. Another important application of NBIoT is smart parking.
    Here occupancy [55]. Prime use case/application of NBIoT is utility meters information
    is collected and hence provide the availability of parking space throughout the
    city. Hamburg will be first to offer using this service of IoT using NBIoT. Huawei
    with China Unicom collaboratively launched smart parking in China also in 2017.
    Apart from this NBIoT can also monitor the environment effectively [16]. For example,
    XMM7115, FIGURE 14. Applications of NBIoT. Show All NBIoT-intel chip is used for
    environmental monitoring. Currently, in Greece Patras, NBIoT based monitoring
    service is being offered by Deutsche Telekom to effectively measure environment
    pollution, noise and air quality to take necessary actions. Automation and digitization
    is the need of the hour and list of possible application are endless. The technical
    view of current IoT applications related to four particular sectors Health monitoring,
    Social monitoring, Agriculture monitoring and defense that are ruling the market
    are given in Table 5. TABLE 5 Different Applications of IoT SECTION V. Efficient
    Resource Allocation Techniques Due to massive connections, IoT system will be
    extremely dense thus the use of efficient resource allocation techniques is of
    vital importance. As incompetent resource allocation will drastically degrade
    the performance of IoT systems. Moreover, there are miscellaneous factors that
    further aids in increasing the complicacy of efficient resource allocation such
    as limited network bandwidth, limited device computation power, diverse user requirement,
    heterogeneous device configurations. Broadly these resource allocation techniques
    can be classified into the following categories: Power allocation, Spectrum allocation,
    Computing & Storage resources allocation in the cloud and Scheduling based (Fig.
    15). Other than this all techniques that assure the reduction in latency and packet
    error are categorized under QoS resource allocation techniques. As per now, few
    resource allocation schemes (RAS) have been proposed for NBIoT system. Immense
    research is required to be carried out for the practical implication of NBIoT
    as the IoT devices have limited resources. In this section, a review of resource
    allocation schemes for NBIoT and IoT system is presented. FIGURE 15. Resource
    allocation in IoT [107]. Show All A. NBIoT Resource Allocation Techniques Yu et
    al. [108] proposed a UL link adaptation scheme with consideration of repletion
    factor to address two important aspects of throughput and reliability. This scheme
    worked in two loops inner and outer. The inner one modifies the repletion factor
    to improve block error ratio whereas outer concentrate on the selection of modulation
    and coding scheme level In addition to this outer loop also decides the repetition
    factor accounting acknowledgment or no acknowledgment packets. As a result, the
    authors observed that the proposed technique can save 46% more resource allocation
    and active time in comparison of straightforward techniques. However, they have
    not considered the effect of inter-channel interference during evaluation. In
    order to handle massive connection effectively in NBIoT multi PRB design is used.
    Where most of UE’s use Anchor-PRB (that satisfy the channel raster condition)
    to get paging and system information block. This leads to overloading of anchor-PRB.
    Hence the overloading of narrowband resource leads to underutilization of resources
    and increase power consumption. To overcome this issue Liu et al. [109] suggested
    a resource allocation technique to balance the paging load by using non-Anchor
    PRB. In the proposed technique existing user will use the Anchor PRB and the new
    NBIoT user will make use of non-Anchor PRB for paging in idle mode. As a result,
    it was observed that resource utilization improved by 30% and power consumption
    was reduced by 80%. Malik et al. [110] proposed an interference aware RAS that
    accounts for the repetition number & time offset. The linear modulation scheme
    is used in NBIoT (QPSK), therefore spectral efficiency is low. Firstly they evaluated
    the max attainable data rate for downlink is 89.2 kbps and 92kbps for uplink (theoretically).
    In addition to this, the authors analyzed the performance of cooperative scheme
    in comparison of non-cooperative and optimal scheme. They found that cooperative
    scheme can reduce the energy consumption by 17% and can improve the data rate
    up to 8%. B. IoT Based Resource Allocation Techniques Liu and Ansari [111] proposed
    a green approach by developing an overlay based architecture that uses relay BS
    powered by solar energy. These relay BS stores the harvested energy in two batteries
    and each one is used in alternatively when one exhaust. Thus omits the grid based
    energy utilization and cuts cost for transmission of power also. Here in this
    approach, the SD (source destination) pairs are classified into two groups based
    on CSI. Where one is direct D2D which doesn’t use relay for transmission and another
    one that uses relay BS for transmission of information. However, while allocating
    bandwidth direct D2D pair is given more preference in comparison to relay based
    D2D transmissions. As a result, authors observed that as the number of SD pair
    increases with D2D communication very less bandwidth left for relay based pairs
    which deteriorates their performance. In addition to this due to large no of direct
    D2D pairs green energy will exhaust quickly and to balance the leftover/residual
    energy the relay BSs with enough left over green energy will transmit their electricity
    via electric transmission lines to the relay BSs which run out of green energy.
    Hence proposed architecture maximizes the green energy utilization and further
    saves the on-grid energy. Further, Kotagi et al. [112] proposed a breathing technique
    to reduce the BS energy consumption by assigning the Tx(Transmission) power efficiently.
    Firstly the SINR of the user is compared with pre-specified SINR threshold value
    and if found greater Tx Power has modified accordingly. Thereupon resource is
    allocated, according to breathing pattern i.e. IoT devices are arranged in increasing
    (inhaling)/decreasing (exhaling) order on the basis required Tx Power and then
    mapped to resource block. In addition to this if available resources are less
    as compare to required, the user/device with a heavy request and highest Tx power
    was blocked. Apart from this transmission power is reduced if SINR of device is
    greater than the threshold value, which in turn improves the co-channel interference.
    Authors found that overall energy consumption of BS reduced and throughput is
    improved using the proposed approach. Further Samie et al. [113] enlighten the
    issue of underutilization of bandwidth of gateway. As IoT device have limited
    computation capability thus it is offloaded to the edge nodes i.e. gateway. However,
    due to limited bandwidth and diverse offloading levels, gateway bandwidth resource
    remain underutilized. Hence authors developed an algorithm that allocates or take
    away bandwidth from a device depending on its battery level. As a result, they
    found that battery life extended by 1.5 hour max and bandwidth utilization improved
    by 40%. Ejaz and Ibnkahla [114] proposed a framework for C-5GN. In the proposed
    framework, multiband sensing approach is used such that sensing is done in shared
    mode where each node is required to sense equal and reduced number of channels,
    thus reduced energy consumption. Although it is assured that all channels get
    processed once at least by a node. Apart from this, a game based CLRS (Cross Layer
    Reconfiguration) scheme is used to satisfy the diverse QoS requirement (latency,
    data rate, etc.) for each node. Hence, authors observed that the proposed technique
    reduced energy consumed during spectrum sensing and QoS is offered economically.
    Pang et al. [115] proposed a complete contention resolution approach based on
    the principle of context-aware and dynamic allocation of resource (CADRA). Overload
    scenario is first detected by analyzing the no of nonempty preambles. If detected,
    CADRA is called. This works in two phases firstly it determines the estimated
    number of RACH attempts by observing the preambles received successfully and empty
    preambles. After that in the second phase resource allocation is done. As a result,
    authors observed that throughput increased with moderate packet delay. Jang et
    al. [116] proposed Non orthogonal resource allocation collaborated with spatial
    group resource allocation scheme (SGRA). SGRA divides the cell into spatial groups.
    After dividing the cell region, it detects the preambles transmitted from the
    user in a certain spatial group by zadoff-chu sequence (which is shifted by spatial
    group number). Once the preambles utilized by a spatial group was determined using
    the ordered time delay metric, subgroups were formed. Authors found that using
    the proposed approach the probability of success of random access has increased
    a lot. Further, Morvari and Ghasemi [117] proposed a resource allocation scheme
    that works in two stage by efficacious use of resource available in UL. During
    the first phase, users are required to pass the access class bearing test. If
    a user manages to pass only then permitted to select the preamble (PA) and use
    physical uplink shared channel opportunity else has to select the special PA.
    Finally, in the second stage the secondary users are allowed to take access class
    bearing test again if passed allowed to request for UL shared channel. Hence it
    is inferred that the number of request that can be handled with proposed technique
    whilst dropping the wastage that occurs due to the collision of PA’s. Another
    extended RA scheme with spatial group resource allocation is proposed in [118].
    This scheme reuses the allocated preamble if the distance between the two nodes
    belonging to a different spatial group is greater than pre-specified minimum distance.
    In addition to this, access delay is also reduced. The proposed approach will
    utilize the unused bandwidth. Beside this collision probability is also tapered
    by using distinct UL resources for transmission. As interference is also a prevalent
    challenge for IoT device communication. Taking into consideration Iqbal et al.
    [119] proposed a constraint specific approach to improve the performance of IoT
    networks For solving the RA problem authors have used backtracking search algorithm
    named Soft-GORA.Where firstly channel is selected with minimum cost for tentative
    allocation to link, at the top in the ordered list and then checked against hard
    constraint. If it couldn’t satisfy the constraint, the allocated channel is removed
    and the next best option is opted. As a result, authors relaxing few constraints
    observed that throughput has improved and delay is reduced. Li et al. [120] proposed
    an architecture using edge computing further, they proposed a scheme to jointly
    control admission of new packet and allocation of resource together with power
    control. For this, the resource management controller at fog node uses three information
    i.e. service, state of the queue, CSI. Using the proposed schemes authors found
    that tradeoff is achieved between throughput and delay. Zhang et al. [121] proposed
    a joint optimize framework for the selection and allocation of resource among
    fog nodes (FN), data service subscribers (DSS) & data service operators.(DSO)
    They have developed a stakelberg game algorithm, here DSO provides the computing
    resources (CR) to DSS and if they require more CRB’s(Computing Resource Block)
    DSS competes for them. For this, another matching game algorithm is developed.
    As a result it was found that the system achieves high performance and optimally
    utilizes their resources. Further, cognitive 5G network (C-5GN) is expected to
    play a vital role in IoT success, Angelakis et al. [122] developed two algorithms
    RAND-INT and Average-cost allocation, to optimally allocate resources for services.
    These algorithms reduced the total cost of resource utilization and activation
    of interface. Where RAND-INT algorithm normalizes the demands to get an order
    in which resource is to be allocated. Henceforth the heaviest demand is served
    first by comparing the utilization cost of interfaces, thereby other demands are
    served either by splitting or by not splitting among two or more interfaces. Whereas
    the second algorithm assigns, the resource by averaging the total cost incurred.
    Authors have studied the impact of the activation cost on the services’ splits
    and distribution among the interfaces. As a result, they found that for random
    service with high demand, interface total cost increases linearly with respect
    to the number of services. Hence above discussed technique proves that resource
    technique can enhance communication, connectivity and collaboration of IoT devices.
    The chief objective of resource allocation technique is to minimize the power
    consumption per node, BER, Delay and maximize the throughput and network utilization.
    The above discussed techniques are summarized in Table 6. TABLE 6 Efficient Resource
    Allocation Techniques for IoT SECTION VI. Energy Consumption in Lifecycle of IoT
    Devices Sensing device act as the backbone for IoT applications. Different sensors
    are deployed massively to develop a ubiquitous sensed environment, to offer diverse
    monitoring and control services. Indeed to avoid service interruptions of critical
    applications sensing device must operate permissibly for a long time. However,
    as most of the IoT devices are powered by constrained energy source hence device
    lifetime longevity is a critical issue. Therefore the device must be monitored
    precisely for optimal utilization. In this context, the trend of energy consumption
    during different states of the sensor is studied in [123]. There are five modes
    among which sensor switches- Mode I: Wake up from Sleep mode, Mode II: After Sleep
    mode. Mode III: Sensing, Mode IV: Processing, Mode V: Transmission. Hussain [123]
    studied different case studies to see the trend of energy consumption during different
    modes. As a conclusion of various trends (Fig. 16), it was found that during Processing-Phase
    energy consumption was least whereas, for Sensing Phase, node consumes the highest
    power as compare to Transmission Phase. However, energy consumption during Transmission
    phase depends on the application. For example, consider the applications like
    Humidity/thermal measurement the power consumption during the wake-up and in getting
    ready for sensing phase is more as compare to other applications like temperature
    sensing which require less power for the same. Duty Cycle is the other metric
    that affects the energy consumption in the sensor node. As the duty cycle increases,
    energy consumption increases consequently lifetime of the node decreases. There
    are various factors that affect the lifetime of an IoT device such as duty cycle,
    the amount of data to be communicated, processing time other factors like aging,
    self-discharge and temperature [124]. Hence various energy efficiency techniques
    have been proposed in the literature to improve the lifetime of an IoT device
    and hence network lifetime. In the next section the recently proposed energy efficiency
    techniques are discussed in detail. FIGURE 16. Energy consumption during the lifecycle
    of IoT device [123]. Show All A. Energy Efficient Techniques for Green Communication
    The energy budget affects the sensor node processing time, quality of measurement
    and amount of data it can transmit, thus energy efficiency techniques can a play
    crucial role to improve QoE. Rault et al. [125] classified the energy efficiency
    techniques classified into five categories of radio optimization, data reduction,
    sleep/wakeup schemes, energy efficient routing and battery repletion. Where radio
    optimization techniques would optimize modulation schemes, transmission power,
    and antenna direction on the other hand data reduction reduces the data transmitted.
    Furthermore Sleep/Wake-up adaptively switches the node to sleep or active mode
    to save energy. Other two techniques, energy efficient routing, and battery repletion
    works on routing efficiency and ways of harvesting energy or finding ways to charge
    battery automation, respectively. (Fig. 17, discusses briefly the impact of different
    techniques). In this section, the existing literature on energy efficiency techniques
    is discussed. FIGURE 17. Classification of energy efficiency techniques for IoT.
    Show All 1) Sleep/Wakeup Techniques Khodr et al. [126] enlighten that though the
    duty cycling technique could reduce power consumption but this will reduce network
    reactivity. Thus authors proposed a design of sensor based RF wake up technology.
    This design approach wakes the sensor only when the address decoder detects that
    whether a received signal address is of IoT device or not. Thereby omits the fake
    call wakeups hence reduced energy consumption. Perles et al. [127] did a case
    study on cultural heritage and proposed an architecture to improve the lifespan
    of sensor life up to 20 years using unlicensed LPWAN technologies LoRa &SigFox.
    In order to keep the energy consumption low, the proposed architecture wakes up
    the microcontroller whenever a new packet arrives. Apart from this, it uses a
    cluster management system, Elastic Cloud Computing Cluster (EC3) which can deploy
    and un-deploy nodes as per demand i.e. nodes will be deployed if load increases
    and un-deployed if they are idle. 2) Cognitive Radio Techniques Further, Qureshi
    et al. [128] discussed cognitive radio approach where unlicensed users opportunistically
    access the unused spectrum holes that are not used by the licensed user. Hence
    to achieve good throughput, uninterrupted connectivity, and Reliable communication,
    for both licensed and unlicensed user the concept of the backup data channel (BDC)
    was introduced. Where if licensed user return than unlicensed user resumes its
    communication using BDC. Hence communication time between SUs for task completion
    will be reduced and thereby the energy consumption of CRAN’s will reduce and throughput
    will increase. Furthermore, Li et al. [129] proposed a 5G based framework where
    the central control unit act as both cloud and central data processor takes the
    sensed data from the physical world. In addition to this authors, fractionated
    the resource allocation into two sub problems of power and channel allotment in
    industrial Cyber physical IoT. These sub-problems are solved separately. For individual
    channel allotment, the energy efficiency is achieved using game theory and Dinkelbach’s
    algorithm. After this, the Hungarian method was used for channel allocation. Authors
    analyzed that IHM-VD could perform outstandingly. 3) Routing Techniques Further
    Yi et al. [130] proposed a topology control algorithm in which nodes discover
    their neighbors asymmetrically. For time synchronization multiple of two is taken
    as reference point. Authors observed that energy consumption got abridged due
    to curtailment in wakeup calls required to discover the neighboring node. Further,
    the utmost drawback of continuous sensing (i.e. nonselective monitoring) is unfiltered
    data that results in significant energy consumption of sensors. Basnayaka and
    Haas [131] proposed a physical layer modulation scheme RNM (random number modulation)
    that operates in two modes energy efficient and low latency. To switch between
    modes the constellation order and random bit generated by random generator were
    considered. Proposed approach compromise latency for energy efficiency, as the
    user was allowed to transmit the data block only when it matches with random sequence
    generated by a random number generator otherwise the user could not transmit the
    data. Shen et al. [132] proposed a clustering based protocol EECRP for IoT assisted
    by WSN to enhance the performance of the network. Firstly a cluster head is opted
    by comparing the energy of each node with pre-specified energy (threshold value)
    after this taking the distance from the centroid (energy based) of the network
    to the node is considered. This leads to uniform energy consumption in the network.
    After this for optimal result, the max distance value is broadcasted by BS to
    all the nodes, in order to avoid long distance communication. As a result, it
    has been found that overall energy consumption of the network is reduced in comparison
    to proprietary protocols. In extension to this, Tian et al. [133] have discussed,
    when to use network coding concept to reduce the energy consumption. Authors have
    proposed a network coding and power control based routing (NCPCR) protocol. Using
    this protocol intermediate node drops the duplicate packets and keep the relevant
    information in its buffer. Source node selects the path with the minimum distance
    to transmit the data packets. As a result the energy consumption is reduced as
    no of packets to be retransmitted is reduced and moreover, it opts for the shortest
    path also and in addition to this, it can handle scalability. 4) Data Reduction
    Technique Perera et al. [134] proposed a platform C-MOSDEN that performs sensing
    tasks collaboratively and in a selective manner i.e. adaptive sensing to reduce
    energy consumption. As sensing would require less computational efforts to drive
    knowledge from data generated. In addition to this, the storage cost will also
    be reduced. 5) Battery Repletion Technique Nan et al. [135] enlighten that offloading
    the traffic at fog layer or edge layer has led to increased carbon footprints,
    thus they have proposed an online algorithm LOTEC (Lyapunov optimization on time
    and energy cost). The proposed technique suggested using green power source i.e.
    solar energy and grid power as a standby power source. The discussed energy efficiency
    techniques are summarized in tabular form in Table 7. In this paper, two novel
    application based energy efficient approaches are proposed. For smart agriculture
    and Smart Healthcare. Where “ZTPA” -a hybrid approach, centered on two techniques
    “Sleep/wake up” and “Energy efficient routing” is proposed. E2AHMS is proposed
    for smart healthcare, which is a radio based approach. These two approaches with
    their proposed mathematical approach are discussed in detail in section VIII.
    TABLE 7 Energy Effeciency Techniques for IoT SECTION VII. Open Issues Ascertaining
    the vision of the NBIoT is not a tranquil task, owing to multiple challenges that
    are required to be addressed Although NBIoT offers significant features for LPWA
    applications, yet a number of critical issues remain unattended that seeks traction
    from the research community. The technical issues and challenges related to energy
    are discussed in this section. A. Non-Uniformity in Resources Allocation In the
    current scenario, resources are allocated on the basis of total available power,
    coverage range, and demanded applications. Due to non-uniformity in the requirement
    of resources, a non-uniformity in power consumption persists. This is a critical
    challenge that seeks redressal as there are no studies/algorithms/techniques available
    for uniform resource allocation in NBIoT. A unified platform is required for resource
    allocation so that applications can be handled adaptively in real time scenarios.
    B. Difficulty in Achieving the Desired Throughput The prime advantage of NBIoT
    enabled device is to make use of low power to operate. Therefore the power of
    the signal transmitted will be low. Beside this due to channel losses, fading
    & interference (Intra/Inter) SINR will drop drastically. Hence it would be quite
    difficult to achieve the desired throughput in all condition. Thus proper channel
    modeling, optimized algorithms/techniques required to be designed/developed to
    achieve desired throughput C. Inter-Channel Interference The allocation of frequency
    in in-band or standalone mode will not be synchronous among all the cells in the
    network. This results in interference among neighboring cells. Interference within
    the same cell also exists due to the deployment of small cells in the macro cell.
    These result in a fall in the SNR. This is a decisive challenge, especially for
    critical applications like acute healthcare applications, where noise could tamper
    biological readings. This may lead to the wrong detection and thereby wrong medication.
    Thus an efficient scheme is required to be developed to reduce interference and
    provide QoS to the users. D. Spectral Efficiency To achieve extended coverage,
    the concept of multiple repetitions is utilized. Undoubtedly this would improve
    the Tx Reliability but will lead to loss of spectral efficiency. Thus an efficient
    resource allocation scheme is required which could optimally decide the repetition
    factor. Furthermore, to maintain high channel capacity- device consumes more power,
    consequently reducing its lifetime. This open issue needs to be addressed because
    it would adversely affect the battery lifetime E. Latency Different types of latency
    can occur during NBIoT communication: a) UL/DL latency, b) synchronization latency,
    c) the latency associated with resource allocation, d) latency associated with
    packet synchronization. Though NBIoT applications are delay tolerant, yet latency
    needs to be kept below 10s, especially for real time applications such as health
    monitoring. Thus the theoretical computational model must be framed to improve
    the latency analysis. F. Synchronization With the Access Point Consider a scenario
    where utility meters are positioned close to each other. When all devices would
    send information to the cluster head, synchronization will be difficult for the
    access point as there would be interference between devices within its range.
    Besides this, other factors like the priority of a device, its residual power
    availability and channel conditions will also affect the synchronization process,
    raising its complexity. Hence this open issue needs to be addressed by providing
    techniques/algorithms for synchronization. G. Security The issue of security is
    very critical for NBIoT. As low power devices have limited resources, they are
    more vulnerable to security attacks. By exploiting the data integrity or tracking
    the traffic pattern, passive or active attack can befall at the perception layer.
    Besides, other security attacks such as the injection of false data by an intruder,
    transmission of interference signals, etc. can also occur. Thus continuous efforts
    must be put in by industry, academicians, and researchers to maintain the faith
    of users in using the services provided by the NBIoT application. H. Carbon Footprint
    Inflation The massive connectivity among millions of devices would generate an
    enormous amount of data. In order to draw an inference from the collected information,
    servers need to manage data through extensive computations. This will overburden
    the servers, resulting in rising in energy and subsequently raising carbon emissions.
    In addition, the factors such as manufacturing of billions of IoT devices, shipments
    of these devices, excess use of radio access network, etc. will also elevate the
    carbon footprint. Fig. 18 demonstrates the percentage of carbon emissions due
    to various such activities [136]. Collaboratively, these will have an adverse
    impact on pollution levels. Hence, the need for a generic architecture arises
    to achieve Green IoT, whilst assuring better QoS to all the users. FIGURE 18.
    Carbon footprint due to various activities. Show All I. E-Waste Management As
    technology improves, people started procuring additional electronic equipment’s
    like PDA’s, desktop computers, smart phones, and gadgets, though might not be
    required. The complex structure of these e-waste/WEEE (waste electrical and electronic
    equipment) makes it difficult to destroy. The condition will become even more
    severe in coming future when millions of sensors and battery operated IoT devices
    will have to be destroyed and replaced with new ones, either due to reformation
    in technology or lifetime expiry. Many countries like Japan, Taiwan, and U.S etc.
    are working on this hot burning issue since 2001. However, together with this
    research efforts are needed for the development of the green disposable electronic
    device. J. Cloud-Radio Access Network (C-RAN) Overhead In C-RAN the virtual centralized
    BBU (Base Band Unit) is used to reduce the OPEX, generated heat, and latency.
    Hence, instead of having BBU at each cell site with remote Radio head, they are
    repositioned in centralized manner in BBU home. In IoT, the users would be monitoring
    & controlling multiple devices remotely, this would overburden the existing network
    especially between the RRH and BBU Pool. Moreover, the different types of data
    i.e. real, non-real, social, sensitive, medical/health data, agriculture related
    data, etc. would collectively create an extensive overhead for CRAN. Pertaining
    to this, a huge number of processing units would be required to process the enormous
    IoT data. This, in turn, generates massive power requirement. Hence “prioritization
    of data” could be one of the solutions to deal with this open issue. K. Interface
    With Next Generation Like 5G Network The journey of IoT from virtual ideology
    to real time implementation has many milestones to achieve and one of those is
    interoperability among IoT devices. As we know that 5G operates on the very high
    frequency range like millimeter waves frequency, ranging from 28 to 32 GHz, whilst
    IoT devices operate at 2.2 GHz. Thus it’s a big challenge for the researchers
    to interface IoT with 5G Other than this, the high operating frequency in 5G networks
    escalates power consumption levels to achieve the data rate of the order of Gbps.
    In contrast to this IoT devices are highly power constrained thus operate at low
    power levels. This requires technological developments. Including this various
    other challenges such as [137] Cooperation among millions of devices, Heterogeneous
    subnet, Anonymous device configuration and Conflicts among semantics of devices
    exist. All these will collectively urge for research efforts before 5G specifications
    are standardized. L. MIMO/Massive MIMO Undoubtedly, Multiple Input Multiple Output
    (MIMO) technique provide a high data rate with high Reliability. In MIMO BS is
    acquainted with multiple antennas to improve the spectral & energy efficiency.
    Although, MIMO is an enabler for 5G, yet, it is difficult to employ MIMO in IoT.
    It is because, in the multi antenna scenario, information transmissions from the
    sensor nodes will require more processing during the synchronization phase. This
    results in more power consumption at the sensor end. Since the sensor nodes have
    limited battery capacity, adaptability of IoT devices in a MIMO environment is
    an open challenge that needs to be addressed. M. Channel State Information Collection
    Overhead The channel state assessment overhead intensifies linearly with a number
    of users. If the number of users grows beyond the threshold value then channel
    block could no longer support the assessment overhead within the narrow coherence
    time, especially for IoT applications. Moreover, the inaccurate channel estimation
    results in unreliable transmission. This uncertainty is due to the staleness of
    information after a certain time gap, due to the collision of pilot signals in
    UL. Pertaining to this, contention and interference would aggravate. As a result,
    more retransmissions are required which upraise the power consumption of IoT devices.
    Moreover, multiple verifications will contribute to more power consumption. SECTION
    VIII. Proposed Architecture Towards Green Communication Using NBIoT The world
    population is expected to grow up to 8.025 billion by 2030. Consequently, this
    growth will inflate the global food demand. Thus meeting the demands of the immense
    population will be a tough task. The varying climatic conditions, scarcity of
    water, etc. shall further aggravate the circumstances In addition to this, enhanced
    health assistance will also be required for projected population, which will be
    quite difficult to handle using existing infrastructure and services. Thus integration
    of IoT with Agriculture & Health sector can ensure a resourceful and healthy life
    for an individual. Despite, all this revolution that IoT is capable to bring in,
    the biggest stumbling block of its success is to provide energy efficient solution.
    As most of the IoT devices are constrained in term of energy. Hence this paper
    is proposing energy efficiency techniques for two prime applications: Smart Agriculture:
    Zonal Thermal Pattern Analysis and Smart Health: Energy Efficiency Adaptive Health
    Monitoring System.NBIoT is used for both the application as it offers favorable
    features like extended coverage with deep indoor penetration, long battery life,
    supports high density, require the low-cost device, and provide end to end security.
    Moreover, it would not require the deployment of new infrastructure as compared
    to proprietary technologies LoRa and SigFox, hence would offer a cost effective
    solution. A. Proposed Technique for Smart Agriculture: ZTPA 1) Case Study 1: Energy
    Efficient Agriculture Monitoring, Irrigation System for Green Communication The
    growing population and climate vagaries are forestalling that in future decades
    water resources would reduce eminently, especially for agriculture. Since agriculture
    practices require an ample amount of water, effective utilization of water is
    an obvious issue to be addressed. This section investigates an energy efficient
    technique for productive utilization of water. It has been put forth to overcome
    the disadvantages of conventional irrigation systems like wastage of water (due
    to percolation, evaporation), abbreviated crop yield. To economize the use of
    water in agriculture, IoT with Deep Learning could play a significant role. In
    the proposed scenario, soil moisture sensors are deployed in the farm field under
    consideration. Thereafter data aggregated from multiple sensors will be passed
    on to the BS using NBIoT and then to the NBIoT cloud. At the cloud, data (moisture)
    will be processed using Deep Learning and subsequently, the farm field will be
    adaptively divided into zones based on moisture level, as shown in Fig. 19 (for
    one iteration which is subjected to change in other iterations). Hereafter depending
    on the moisture levels i.e. moderate moisture level, high moisture level and least
    moisture level, zones will be irrigated. To accomplish this, the water pump is
    attached with smart NBIoT enabled water control device. This device would transmit
    the water in desired quantity and for the desired time in the zones. This scenario
    could be well understood by Fig. 19 where zone Z2 with dark pink color has the
    highest moisture, Z1 has the least moisture and Z3 has moderate moisture level.
    As Z2 has good moisture level so no water would be transmitted in that zone. Hence,
    sensor nodes in Z2 will enter idle state followed by the sleep state for a long
    period of time by exploiting eDRX in NBIoT. This will save water along with energy.
    In addition to this UL traffic will also be reduced, thereby reducing the congestion
    impact also. FIGURE 19. Proposed architecture for energy efficient precision agriculture
    using NBIoT–toward green communication. Show All There is another aspect to be
    considered while designing this scenario i.e. land orientation. Hence this use
    case study is divided into two sub problems: a: Uniform Land Surface When land
    has uniform orientation like in the plain area, there will be no water logging
    problem. Therefore, farm/agriculture land can be irrigated by classifying the
    moisture data as discussed previously. Thus watering of the field by the proposed
    pioneered way could avoid the wastage of water. Also in the plain area, the orientation
    of land is more or less uniform, thus the pattern of power consumption would not
    be much diverse. This can be depicted by thermal pattern analysis using drones
    and satellite captured thermal images. b: Non-Uniform Land Surface Another case
    is when agriculture land has non-uniform orientation like in hilly areas, which
    leads to the uneven power consumption of devices. As in some case, eNB will allocate
    the resource to the sensor via NBIoT using direct path whereas in some cases using
    an indirect path. In our proposed approach we have not only considered direct/indirect
    resource allocation but in addition to this, the overlap condition will also be
    considered, where one region overlaps with another region. As shown in Fig. 20
    regions R1 and R2, describes the overlap region. Here the sensor S3, S5, S9, S21,
    S14 suffers from Inter-Interference. FIGURE 20. Proposed architecture for energy
    efficient precision agriculture using NBIoT based on thermal pattern analysis
    (TPA). Show All Hence the power consumption pattern will be diverse for node present
    in this region and node present outside of this region which in turn would affect
    the network lifetime. In addition to this SNR will also get influenced by interference
    within inter-interference region. 2) Mathematical Analysis for Energy Efficient
    Smart Agriculture Sensor nodes SN 1 , SN 2 , SN 3 ,……., SN n are deployed in the
    field and as per proposed model, it is assumed CH of disjoint sets of sensors
    (CH1, CH2, and CH3) will communicate with the processing unit (PU). Further, this
    PU would communicate with BS. Assume that using NBIoT technology k PRB’s (physical
    resource blocks) are required. As the signal propagates from SN i to NBIoT node
    path loss (PL) will occur. PL will depend on the position of sensor. If the sensor
    is placed under the soil or underground, then soil would absorb the signal and
    hence leads to path loss which can be evaluated as follows P ∗ C = P real C −j(
    P dipolarloss + σ 2πf P D ) (3) View Source Here P ∗ C specifies the complex-permittivity
    (cp), P real C denotes the real part of cp, P dipolarloss is due to Relaxation
    and P D specifies the relative dielectric-permittivity [138], [139]. The permittivity
    of soil can be affected importantly by parameters like water content, frequency
    of signal, soil composition and soil conductivity. Hence it is difficult to measure
    the soil permittivity accurately. Path loss can be calculated using equation (4)
    where T p is Transmission power, T g Transmission gain, R g receiver gain, PL
    fs is path loss due to free space propagation of signal and PL M is path loss
    due to medium, α is path loss between NBIoT node and eNB.1 PL= T p + T g + R g
    + PL fs − PL M +α (4) View Source Further path loss due to medium can be evaluated
    as follows [139] PL M = WD s + TL s (5) View Source Where WD s is path loss due
    to difference in wavelength of signal in soil in comparison of free space and
    TL s is transmission loss. If the sensor is placed above the surface (of ground),
    then plants would act as scatterers and thereby the path loss can be evaluated
    using equation (6) PL(d)=PL( d 0 )+10mlog( d d 0 )+ OH T i +α (6) View Source
    Here OH T i represent the obstacle height at time iε {1, 2, 3}, where i=1 specifies
    the phase, when seeds are just sawn, so no plant would be there at that time so
    no obstacle. Likewise for i=2 , specifies that plant has started budding up so
    it will have certain height. Similarly for i=3 specifies, plant has fully grown
    to its full height. Thus corresponding to height of plant, obstacle path loss
    parameter would increase. Here d 0 specifies the reference distance between sensing
    node and NBIoT node (Refer Fig. 20.). Here α specifies the path loss between NBIoT
    node and eNB. Hence the SINR of the sensing node can be expressed as SINR= S T
    G k N+ I T (7) View Source Where N is thermal noise, I T total interference, S
    T represents the transmitted signal power and G k is the channel gain between
    sensor node k and NBIoT node. We then express the total interference as I T =
    I interzone + I intrazone + I Soilreflectivity (8) View Source Interference that
    occurs within zone, between zones and also due to soil reflectivity. Further channel
    capacity (C) can be evaluated based on Shannon theorem as follows C= Blog 2 (1+
    S k G k N+ I T ) (9) View Source Based on these above formulations we conclude
    that capacity of a sensor deployed in the agricultural area will be adversely
    affected by the interference generated by the adjacent sensor nodes, scatterers,
    etc. a: Energy Consumption Evaluation For electing cluster head out of n sensor
    node for each disjoint set of sensing nodes. Each node power level is to be determined
    and one with highest power level is selected. Power level get deteriorates due
    to energy dissipation. Hence we first evaluate the total energy consumed due to
    various factors for each node (The energy model used here is given [140].) E C
    Total =EC Sensing + EC Processing+ EC Transmission + EC Sleeping + EC Switching
    (10) View Source Where energy consumption during sensing could be evaluated using
    equation (11) EC Sensing = EC Sample ∗n (11) View Source Here EC Sample specifies
    the energy consumption during sampling of each sample, n represents the no of
    samples. Similarly, energy consumption during transmission ( EC Transmission )
    depends on supply voltage S v , current I and time T required for transmission
    EC Transmission = S v ∗I∗T (12) View Source Energy consumed during switching from
    active to sleep state [141] EC Switching = T Swt ∗( PC Active + PC Sleep )/2 (13)
    View Source Hence total energy consumption can be evaluated (using eq. 10) and
    using Relation E= P*T, power levels can be evaluated for each node, where T will
    include time for switching, sleeping, active, sensing, and processing. Hence CH
    can be selected for by comparing the power of all the nodes. Here another aspect
    must also be included that is if the node has acted as CH earlier also then. Hence
    we evaluate the energy consumption when node act as CH, ( EC CH ) . This will
    depend on length of message L MSG and energy consumed by transmitter if sending
    the message to processing point (PP) or energy consumed when receiver receives
    data by PP [142]. EC CH = L MSG ∗ EC TX/RX ∗ D PP (14) View Source Hence total
    energy consumption equation if node acted as CH could be rewritten as E C Total
    =EC Sensing + EC Processing+ EC Transmission + EC Sleeping + EC Switching + EC
    CH (15) View Source Finally energy efficiency EE can be evaluated as ratio of
    total energy consumed ,EC TOTAL and energy of sensor at time of deployment ,E
    TOTAL EE= EC TOTAL / E TOTAL (16) View Source Hence using the proposed approach
    energy efficiency can be improved as EC TOTAL will be reduced by exploiting the
    eDRX of sensing nodes. B. Proposed Technique for Smart Health: E2AHMS 1) Case
    Study: Energy Efficient Health Monitoring System for Green Communication IoT provides
    a big platform to solve medical issues, in real time scenario. Integration of
    IoT with Wireless Body Area Network (WBAN) is gaining much of the momentum and
    currently being used for health monitoring of soldiers at battlefields, patients
    in hospitals, elderly people who could not visit hospitals very often, etc. The
    performance of WBAN (i.e. reliability, delay, power efficiency) chiefly depends
    on the physical and medium access control layer. Moreover, as most of the IoT-BAN
    devices are battery operated, thus power optimization will greatly impact their
    lifetime and performance. In this context, this paper is proposing a novel approach
    namely “Energy Efficient Adaptive Health Monitoring System” E2AHMS. This approach
    will work in an energy efficient manner by adaptively distributing the transmission
    power required to monitor the patient. In our proposed Health Monitoring system
    three prospective conditions have been considered Stable, Mono-Stable, Relatively
    mobile (Fig. 21). FIGURE 21. Proposed health monitoring system using NBIoT–toward
    green communication. Show All Case B.1: Stable: When a patient lying on the bed
    i.e. stationary condition Case B.2: Mono-Stable: When a patient is sitting or
    standing. Case B.3: Relatively mobile: When a patient will be moving either by
    walking or using a wheelchair. Our proposed approach E2AHMS can not only be used
    for patients who require continuous monitoring, but also for health monitoring
    of person who are fit but wants to keep track of their health to prevent themselves
    from severe disease. As in both the cases, network life time will play a vital
    role, which can be increased or improved by using proposed optimized energy efficient
    algorithm. E2AHMS will work in an energy efficient manner by adaptively using
    the transmission , power required during different postural mobility (considered
    before). To understand this it is required to first understand the difference
    in energy requirement during different cases under consideration. CASE B.1 (STABLE):
    While sleeping it is very likely that the sensors will have LOS communication.
    Hence, Body Area Network will be in stable state. Thus power required for transmission
    would be least and hence energy required. As path loss would be minimum between
    sensing nodes and NBIoT coordinator node. Thus energy consumed during sleeping
    state E c_s_st i can be given by summation of energy consumption due to factors
    such as: due to switching from one state to another (On, Off, sleep, idle, Active,
    idle) E st_tr i , due to circuit of sensing device E Crkt i , energy consumption
    due to processing of signals E Proc i , energy consumption due to transmission
    of signal E Trans i , due to acting as relay/connecting node for other sensors
    E connecting_node i and due to various delays (queuing, propagation, transmission)
    E Delays i . E c_s_st i = E st_tr i + E Crkt i + E Proc i + E Trans i + E connecting_node
    i + E Delays i (17) View Source CASE B.2 (MONO-STABLE STATE): In this case the
    patient could be in a sitting posture or moving his arms or having food. Hence
    LOS would not be there between sensing nodes. It is very likely that obstacles
    might interfere with the path of signal transmission thus shadowing would lead
    to multipath loss and hence energy consumption will be more during this posture.
    Energy consumption during mono-stable state E c_ms_st i , can be evaluated by
    equation (18) E c_ms_st i = E st_tr i + E Crkt i + E Proc i + E Trans i + E connecting_node
    i + E Delays i + E obst i (18) View Source Here E obst i specifies the energy
    consumed due to obstacles/shadowing/multipath effect. CASE B.3 (RELATIVELY MOBILE):
    In this state, the patient will be walking or moving with the help of wheel chair
    or might be doing some routine activities. Therefore it is more likely that NLOS
    transmission will occur due to various reasons such as obstacles in the surrounding,
    links between sensors would change rapidly due to body movement, etc. Hence more
    loss of information and thereby more energy consumption. Energy consumption during
    mobile state could be given by equation 19. E c_m_st i = E st_tr i + E Crkt i
    + E Proc i + E Trans i + E connectin_node i + E Delays i +n. E obst i + E relink
    i (19) View Source Here E relink i denotes the energy consumed due to Relinking
    between sensor nodes and gateway. Thus, it is clear from the above discussion
    that due to multipath effect and different channel conditions, different postural
    movement leads to different energy consumption. Therefore in proposed technique
    E2AHMS, depending on postural movement level transmission power will be used adaptively
    which can be determined using graph theory. Whereas conventionally data was transmitted
    with equal power without considering LOS communication is possible or not and
    also channel conditions are good or not. Hence our proposed approach will be an
    energy efficient approach for Health monitoring application. This proposed approach
    is also supported by mathematical formulation. 2) Mathematical Formulation Multiple
    sensors are positioned on the human body I={i1,i2,i3….,in} (20) View Source Here
    each sensor has a coordinate point i1=( x 1 , y 1 ) i2=( x 2 , y 2 ) (21.1) (21.2)
    View Source Path Loss Analysis As the signal propagates through WBAN this gets
    attenuated due to multiple factors such as reflection, diffraction, refraction,
    fading, etc. To analyze path loss in on-body WBAN, IEEE P802.15, 2009 [143] has
    given a path loss model. Using the same as a reference, path loss can be evaluated
    during different postural mobility. Case B.1 (Stable/Sleeping State): PL dB =
    PL d 0 +10n log 10 d/ d 0 + S dB (22) View Source Here d 0 is reference the distance
    from NBIoT coordinator. S dB , is shadowing factor added to it due to movement
    of body parts. However, in the sleeping state, it would be negligible. Case B.2
    (Mono-Stable/Sitting State): During this state, signal could fade due to various
    obstacle such as table while having food/medicine, legs under the chair or below
    the table. Moreover due to the movement of body parts effect of shadowing would
    be high. Hence path loss would be more in comparison to the sleeping state. PL
    dB = PL d 0 +10n log 10 d/ d 0 +( S dB + F 1 + F 2 ) (23) View Source Here F 1
    + F 2 , is addition PL due to factors such as obstacles, interference, surroundings
    Case B.3 (Mobile State): During this state person would be moving from one place
    to another thus link with access point could change very quickly (From one floor
    to another, one room to another, walking, etc.). The signal would attenuate n
    times more in relative mobile state than Sitting/Mono-Stable state. PL dB = PL
    d 0 +10n log 10 d/ d 0 +n( S dB + F 1 + F 2 + F 3 ) (24) View Source Here F 3
    specifies an additional factor of multipath propagation of signal. As PL is difference
    of transmitted power and received power PL= P Tx − P RX (25) View Source Thus
    received power during different case studies can be evaluated as follows: Case
    B.1: P S_ST Rx (dB)= P Tx − PL S_ST dB (26.1) View Source Case B.2: P MS_ST Rx
    (dB)= P Tx − PL MS_ST dB (26.2) View Source Case B.3: P M_ST Rx (dB)= P Tx − PL
    M_ST dB (26.3) View Source In the conventional system, same transmission power
    is used for all the cases whether required or not, but in the proposed technique
    E2AHMS transmission power would be used adaptively depending on postural mobility.
    Hence power will be used in an optimized way. SNR can be evaluated for different
    considered case studies using received power SNR cas e i = RecivedSignal_power
    P cas e i Rx Noise_Power (27) View Source Thereby channel capacity ( C cas e i
    ) for considered cases {i=B.1, B.2, B.3} using Shannon theorem could be evaluated
    for considered case studies as C cas e i =B(1+ SNR cas e i ) (28) View Source
    Hence Energy efficiency can be evaluated using equation EE cas e i = Channe l
    cas e i P cas e i Tx ∗100% (29) View Source It is clear from the above equation
    the high mobility would result in more energy consumption. Hence using the proposed
    technique power will be saved and thereby could enhance the battery lifetime.
    Thus an energy efficient solution. Using the same theme of the proposed approach
    real time hardware implementation is done which is discussed in next section.
    C. Real Time Hardware Implementation for Proposed Work 1) Hardware System Model
    Fig. 22 gives an overview of proposed approach real time implementation. Here
    two axis accelerometer sensors and a pulse sensor is used for real time analysis.
    To determine the patient postural mobility accelerometer sensors are placed on
    his right hand and right leg. Apart from this a pulse sensor is used to measure
    the pulse rate of the patient. Further, in order to send the health information
    to eNB in energy efficient way. Our proposed approach will differentiate between
    different postural (Fig. 22 (a), (b), (c), (d), (e)) using edge computing. Such
    that energy is utilized in an efficiently way by using an optimal amount of transmission
    power of device as suggested in proposed approach to transmit information to eNB.
    Hereafter the health information is forwarded to the centralized cloud and then
    to application server and finally to doctor, who tracks the record of patient,
    to avoid unwanted situation. Finally, doctor would prescribe some medicine if
    required otherwise the message will be sent to user that he is fine. FIGURE 22.
    Real time health monitoring system model. Show All 2) Hardware Requirement 3)
    Interface 4) Implementation The first step is to setup the connections of all
    the desired sensors with Arduino Uno. Thereafter the Arduino Uno is connected
    to development system that has integrated development environment (IDE) with USB.
    Once the setup is done the code developed for considered case (stable, mono stable
    and walking) is uploaded to Arduino Uno. Hereafter the data is collected related
    to different postural mobility of person and processed by comparing against the
    threshold value to determine the postural mobility level. Fig. 24, shows the plot
    of variation in amplitude due to movement of hand and leg (specifically) in developed
    code. Once the movement is determined thereafter the health information like pulse
    rate, etc. is sent via NBIoT with required transmitted power to eNB. Hereafter
    the health information is processed and corresponding actions are than advised
    to the patients. FIGURE 23. Interface of real time health monitoring setup. Show
    All FIGURE 24. Screenshot of plot with arduino IDE. Show All 5) Performance Analysis
    As per our proposed architecture, we have done the performance analysis on the
    basis of a real-time hardware implementation for healthcare monitoring system
    with all possible case studies. We have deployed sensors on body parts of patients
    to fetch the information regarding postural mobility as shown in Fig 22. (a),
    (b), (c), (d), (e). All the data regarding different postural movements saved
    in the database, which is then processed and compared at the same time. The postural
    movement is observed for 500 sec from 926sec to 1426 sec (Fig 25 describes the
    variation of amplitude due to different postural movement.) FIGURE 25. A Plot
    of variation in amplitude vs Time corresponding to Hand and foot movement during
    different postural mobility, to differentiate between transmission-power to be
    used (Here blue and Red depicts hand movement whereas Green and orange depicts
    the leg movement). Show All Approximately for 94 sec the person has kept his body
    in sleeping condition as shown in Fig. 22 (a),(b), it has been observed that during
    this period, a variation of the different sensor output is low and smooth, output
    amplitude is far below as compared to a threshold value. Hereafter the person
    changed his posture to sitting posture Fig. 22(c) and maintained it for 80 sec.
    For this posture, it was observed that variation is high in comparison to sleeping
    posture, but get stable after a certain time. Hereafter person changed his posture
    from sitting to standing (Fig. 22(d), (e)) and did some movement of hand and leg.
    It can be easily seen that variation is high and fluctuating, some irregular spikes
    appeared in the process. On the basis of performance analysis, we have observed
    that power optimization in all these case studies is very important and because
    this real time analysis aligns with our proposed approach E2AHMS. Hence power
    can be optimized with fair resource allocation to achieve the better quality of
    service is possible through our proposed approach. Conclusion IoT is reforming
    technical industry. This reformation will aid in struggling with global challenges
    that are budding due to depletion of natural resources, inflated food demand,
    scarcity of water, etc. Where on one hand IoT is giving hope for resourceful life
    but on other hand, it will play a crucial role in inflating carbon footprint.
    Hence solutions must be given to reduce carbon emission. In this study recent
    work related to energy efficiency techniques has been surveyed and discussed.
    In contribution toward green-IoT, two novel energy efficient approaches have been
    proposed - ZTPA for smart agriculture and E2AHMS for smart healthcare using NBIoT.
    NBIoT is a new licensed radio technology that guarantees to provide a cost effective,
    reliable, and low power solution. It can coexist with the existing LTE cellular
    networks therefore no new infrastructure is required to be setup from scratch,
    hence installation cost is low. This paper provides a detailed technical view
    of NBIoT and its state-of-the-art. To spur advance research and speed up the extensive
    use of the NBIoT systems the research challenges and open issues of NBIoT are
    also discussed. Appendix A list of current research projects based on IoT is presented
    in table 9 In addition to this, an abbreviation list is given in table 10. TABLE

    Footnotes Abstract: Internet of Things (IoT) and smart computing technologies
    have revolutionized every sphere of 21 st century humans. IoT technologies and
    the data driven services they offer were beyond imagination just a decade ago.
    Now, they surround us and influence a variety of domains such as automobile, smart
    home, healthcare, etc. In particular, the Agriculture and Farming industries have
    also embraced this technological intervention. Smart devices are widely used by
    a range of people from farmers to entrepreneurs. These technologies are used in
    a variety of ways, from finding real-time status of crops and soil moisture content
    to deploying drones to assist with tasks such as applying pesticide spray. However,
    the use of IoT and smart communication technologies introduce a vast exposure
    to cybersecurity threats and vulnerabilities in smart farming environments. Such
    cyber attacks have the potential to disrupt the economies of countries that are
    widely dependent on agriculture. In this paper, we present a holistic study on
    security and privacy in a smart farming ecosystem. The paper outlines a multi
    layered architecture relevant to the precision agriculture domain and discusses
    the security and privacy issues in this dynamic and distributed cyber physical
    environment. Further more, the paper elaborates on potential cyber attack scenarios
    and highlights open research challenges and future directions. A Roadmap of Cybersecurity

  explanation: 'The proposed system is a comprehensive architecture for real-time
    monitoring in smart farming, incorporating modern technologies. It addresses key
    aspects of precision agriculture, including data collection and transmission,
    processing and analysis, and control of irrigation systems. The system is designed
    to be scalable, reliable, and secure, enabling farmers to efficiently manage their
    crops and optimize yields.


    The architecture consists of seven layers that work together to provide a holistic
    solution:


    1. **Sensor Layer**: This layer collects data from various sensors deployed in
    the field, including soil moisture sensors, temperature sensors, and humidity
    sensors.


    2. **Link Layer**: This layer is responsible for establishing and maintaining
    communication between the sensors and the central system. It uses wireless protocols
    such as LoRaWAN and NB-IoT to ensure reliable and secure data transmission.


    3. **Encapsulation Layer**: This layer is responsible for encapsulating the data
    from the Link Layer into a format that can be processed by the higher layers.
    It uses protocols such as 6LoWPAN and IPv6 over LoRaWAN to provide efficient data
    transmission over networks with constrained resources.


    4. **Middleware Layer**: This layer facilitates communication between the Encapsulation
    Layer and the higher layers. It uses protocols such as MQTT-SN, CoAP, and XMPP-IoT
    to enable data exchange and device management.


    5. **Configuration Layer**: This layer is responsible for curating, harmonizing,
    and aggregating the data collected from the sensors. It uses protocols like FIWARE
    NGSI and OGC-WFS to provide a common interpretation of data and facilitate interoperability
    among different components of the system.


    6. **Management Layer**: This layer performs data processing and analysis to extract
    meaningful insights from the collected data. It uses tools such as Apache Hadoop,
    Big Data hardware platforms, and machine learning algorithms to identify patterns,
    optimize irrigation schedules, and predict crop yields.


    7. **Application Layer**: This layer provides a user interface for farmers to
    interact with the system. It allows them to monitor crop conditions, control irrigation
    systems, and receive alerts and notifications.'

    \ on the use of modern technologies in the\ncyber-physical ﬁeld management cycle.\
    \ Technologies such as the Internet of Things (IoT) and Cloud\nComputing have\
    \ accelerated the digital transformation of the conventional agricultural practices\n\
    promising increased production rate and product quality. The adoption of smart\
    \ farming though is\nhampered because of the lack of models providing guidance\
    \ to practitioners regarding the necessary\ncomponents that constitute IoT-based\
    \ monitoring systems. To guide the process of designing\nand implementing Smart\
    \ farming monitoring systems, in this paper we propose a generic reference\narchitecture\
    \ model, taking also into consideration a very important non-functional requirement,\n\
    the energy consumption restriction. Moreover, we present and discuss the technologies\
    \ that incorporate\nthe seven layers of the architecture model that are the Sensor\
    \ Layer, the Link Layer, the Encapsulation\nLayer, the Middleware Layer, the Conﬁguration\
    \ Layer, the Management Layer and the Application\nLayer. Furthermore, the proposed\
    \ Reference Architecture model is exempliﬁed in a real-world\napplication for\
    \ surveying Saffron agriculture in Kozani, Greece.\nKeywords: Wireless Sensor\

    \ of the agricultural sector is considered a priority to face the\nnumerous challenges\
    \ presented in the ﬁelds. Environmental monitoring and remote controlling in\n\
    agriculture is rapidly growing towards developing more productive and competitive\
    \ agricultural\nsystems and tools. Precision Agriculture and Smart Farming can\
    \ lead to this direction. These two terms\nrefer to the integration of advanced\
    \ technologies into existing agricultural practices to achieve ﬁne-grid\ncrops\
    \ management. Smart farming systems can provide to farmers meaningful environmental\
    \ data\nfrom the cultivation ﬁelds aiming to boost competitiveness and proﬁt.\
    \ Almost every aspect of the\nagricultural ﬁeld can beneﬁt from these kinds of\
    \ technological advances ranging from planting and\nirrigation processes to plant\
    \ protection and harvesting methods.\nThe future of precision agriculture lies\
    \ upon modern technological advancements and remote\nsensing techniques using\
    \ Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAV) and different kind of smart sensors. Sensors\n\
    are measuring devices that convert an external stimulus or else input signal,\
    \ into an appropriately\nmeasurable output signal. Sensor devices can transform\
    \ a macroscopic size (light, power, pressure,\netc.) to an electrically measurable\
    \ size. Once the electrical signal is processed, it is converted into a\nstandardized\
    \ signal with certain characteristics. The sensor’s properties can be altered\
    \ in a measurable\nmanner, either directly or indirectly by the exposure to a\
    \ particular analyzer or change in environmental\nconditions. UAVs are ﬂying vehicles\
    \ that do not have a pilot on their spindle. Instead they ﬂy either\nInformation\

    \ Unmanned aircraft used for remote monitoring are part\nof Unmanned Aerial Systems\
    \ (UASs). UASs involve all necessary devices and procedures for UAV\noperation,\
    \ while managing data collection. UAVs enable Earth Observation (EO) towards improving\n\
    accuracy, executing more frequent and better monitoring of the ﬁelds and cover\
    \ large (not easily\naccessible) areas. Sensors and UAVs are a part of the Internet\
    \ of Things (IoT) paradigm. The IoT is a\nmodern communication network involving\
    \ the employment of a vast number of distributed smart\ndevices around a uniﬁed\
    \ wide area network. Its basic characteristic stands upon the ability to recognize\n\
    and notify users instantly about real-time events by the use of smart objects.\
    \ Smart objects-devices\nhave basic computational skills, constrained resources\
    \ and unique identiﬁers for communication.\nThe adoption of smart farming though\
    \ is hampered because of the lack of models providing\nguidance to practitioners\
    \ regarding the necessary components that constitute IoT-based monitoring\nsystems.\
    \ The typically dense and heterogeneous nature of IoT deployments poses immense\
    \ challenges\non interoperability among the desired components. However, an efﬁciently\
    \ designed architecture based\non modern enhanced IoT technologies can pave the\
    \ way into easily adopting and deploying smart\nsystems into our everyday life\
    \ activities. The latest years a signiﬁcant number of efforts were presented\n\
    regarding the most suitable network structure and technologies for smart farming\
    \ applications [1–9].\nHowever, the architectural models presented in [1,7–9]\
    \ were based only on static sensor nodes, ignoring\nthe advantage of UAVs in monitoring\
    \ and failing to provide efﬁcient mapping of the ﬁeld to the\nfarmer. Furthermore,\
    \ no prediction mechanisms were employed in [2] towards improving production.\n\
    Moreover, limited contribution was provided in [3–5] regarding energy saving and\
    \ link layer IoT\ntechnologies in farm management information systems, while the\
    \ data-driven agricultural model\nproposed in [6] did not discuss data security\
    \ issues. In contrast to previous studies, the contribution\nof this paper lies\
    \ upon the presentation of a detailed architectural model for an advanced smart\n\
    farming monitoring system by using UAVs and taking into consideration energy-saving\
    \ and security\nrequirements. This architectural model engages novel IoT technologies\
    \ [10] and Wireless Sensor\nNetworks (WSNs) capabilities to provide a sufﬁcient\
    \ view of precision agriculture. Furthermore,\nthe proposed architecture enables\
    \ a combination of modern remote sensing techniques such as UAV\ntracking, Global\
    \ Positioning System (GPS) for location detection, Geographic Information Systems\n\
    (GIS), real-time monitoring with different types of sensors and intelligent input\
    \ control systems. These\ntechnologies have already been tested in various agricultural\
    \ ﬁelds in different countries for the\ncultivation of rice, wheat, tomatoes,\
    \ vegetables, potatoes, ornamental ﬂowers, chilly, cacao, pepper,\ncorn, olives,\
    \ apples, lemons, grape and others. By incorporating new technologies into agricultural\n\
    production and by using modern EO techniques growers will be able to manage their\
    \ crops at a\ndifferent and more advanced kind of level in detail that was not\
    \ possible a few years ago. This\npaper is an extension of our work in [11]. Towards\
    \ enhancing contribution a use case study is also\npresented regarding an ongoing\
    \ research project known as Drone Innovation in saffron Agriculture\nSurveillance(DIAS).\
    \ The DIAS architectural model is based on the proposed paradigm.\nThis paper\
    \ is organized as follows. Section 2 presents an overview of the proposed smart\
    \ farming\nmonitoring system architecture. In Section 3, the sensor layer is introduced,\
    \ followed by the network\nlayer and its suitable protocols and technologies regarding\
    \ communication, routing, encapsulation\ntechniques and interoperability mechanisms\
    \ in Section 4. Section 5 is focused on the management\nlayer and the provided\
    \ services of the proposed monitoring system, while Section 6 focuses on IoT\n\
    agricultural applications. Section 7 deals with energy-saving technologies and\
    \ security mechanisms\nthat can be implemented in cooperation with networking\
    \ technologies of the system. The use case\nstudy of the DIAS architecture is\
    \ presented in Section 8. Existing challenges are mentioned and\ndiscussed in\
    \ Section 9. Finally, Section 10 concludes this study.\n2. The Architecture of\
    \ a Smart Farming Monitoring System\nA precision agriculture monitoring system\
    \ consists mainly of the sensing agricultural parameters,\nthe identiﬁcation of\
    \ sensing location and data gathering, the routing of data from crop ﬁeld to\n\
    Information 2019, 10, 348\n3 of 25\ncontrol station for decision making, the actuation\
    \ and control decision based on sensed data and the\nvisualization of results\
    \ to the grower through an application. The architectural design of our model\n\
    follows the ISO/IEC 7498-1 standard or else known as the OSI Model [12], proposing\
    \ a communication\nsystem into seven abstraction layers. However, due the employment\
    \ of IoT technologies and artiﬁcial\nintelligence capabilities the basic agricultural\
    \ layers are deﬁned as presented in Figure 1:\nFigure 1. Remote Sensing System\
    \ Architecture.\n•\nThe Sensor Layer, referring to the Physical Layer of the OSI\
    \ Model, includes all kinds of\ncrops sensors and smart objects for data collection\
    \ and monitoring. Sensors can be placed\nunder ground(in the soil), on the crops\
    \ or on UAVs [6]. Underground sensors are especially\nmanufactured to be water\
    \ resistant and usually refer to measurements of moisture, pH and soil\nchemical\
    \ properties such as sulfur. UAV sensors measure environmental parameters such\
    \ as\nhumidity, temperature, wind speed, luminosity or solar radiation. However,\
    \ the most popular\nkind of sensors to be placed on UAVs are thermal cameras.\
    \ Thermal drones which use vision\nInformation 2019, 10, 348\n4 of 25\nimaging\
    \ cameras have so many positive uses by detecting heat coming from almost all\
    \ objects\nand materials turning them into images and video.\n•\nThe Link Layer,\
    \ referring to the Data Link Layer of the OSI Model, constitutes of all available\n\
    networking and routing technologies between sensors for information exchange.\
    \ To deploy\nefﬁcient crop and ﬁeld management the IoT platform uses Wireless\
    \ Sensor Networks (WSNs).\nThe use of WSN in smart farming systems provides immediate\
    \ monitoring and optimization of\ncrop quality, while offering a potential for\
    \ large area surveillance with high sampling densities.\nThe constant monitoring\
    \ of a great number of environmental parameters by distributed sensor\nnodes along\
    \ the ﬁeld help the grower supervise and maintain optimal conditions to achieve\n\
    maximum productivity with remarkable energy savings.\n•\nThe Encapsulation Layer,\
    \ referring to the Network Layer of the OSI Model, focuses on the\nestablishment\
    \ of smart sensor connection to the IPv6-based internet. This layer consists of\n\
    IoT networking encapsulation techniques and routing protocols to transform the\
    \ regular WSN\nnetwork trafﬁc into smart information. In other words, the technologies\
    \ of this layer enable the\ncultivated ﬁeld sensory data to be encapsulated in\
    \ IPv6 routing packets and be forwarded to the\naccording network server.\n•\n\
    The Middleware Layer, referring to the Transport Layer of the OSI Model, uses\
    \ different application\nlevel transport protocols in order to forward the data\
    \ generated from IoT sensor devices based on\ndifferent paradigms. It also provides\
    \ interfaces that enable device communication for management\nor actuation purposes.\
    \ This layer facilitates the desired interoperability due to the existence of\n\
    diverse standards, which are endorsed by different entities.\n•\nThe Conﬁguration\
    \ Layer, referring to the Session and Presentation Layers of the OSI Model,\n\
    is situated between the Middleware Layer and the Management Layer. This layer\
    \ is responsible\nfor gathering the raw data coming from the devices or other\
    \ external services, curate, harmonize\nand possibly aggregate them, so that they\
    \ can be published as context information, or supplied\nto upstream data processing\
    \ algorithms or analytics. In addition, this layer is also capable of\nsending\
    \ actuation commands to the Middleware Layer. Finally, the Conﬁguration Layer\
    \ may\nalso be capable of gathering data from other data sources, such as agricultural\
    \ machinery or\npublic geo-services.\n•\nThe Management Layer involves the processing\
    \ and analysis of the collected data. In this layer\nthe most efﬁcient data management\
    \ and data mining techniques are adopted to obtain accurate\npredictions and support\
    \ regarding ﬁeld operations such as optimized pesticide application,\ndisease\
    \ detection, efﬁcient irrigation management. Data processing is supported by Decision\n\
    Support Systems (DSS) that take care of the overall management of available collected\
    \ information\nfrom the ﬁelds towards increasing productivity, optimizing crop\
    \ yield, maintaining quality\nand saving resources.\nIt is well known that farmers\
    \ suffer great economic losses due to\nincorrect weather forecasting or incorrect\
    \ irrigation methods. Data analysis is the most important\ncomponent of IoT agricultural\
    \ systems resulting in efﬁcient pesticide use and protection against\ndiseases.\
    \ This layer can be considered to be an additional layer regarding the OSI Model\
    \ enabling\nartiﬁcial intelligence advancements to the overall system.\n•\nThe\
    \ Application Layer, referring to the Application Layer of the OSI Model, includes\
    \ all\nsuitable application module interfaces for implementing fertilizer and\
    \ irrigation control, disease\nand animal detection, alerts regarding the cultivation\
    \ process and visualization of statistical\ndata. This layer enables the farmer\
    \ to monitor and manage his ﬁelds in a user-friendly way.\nData visualization\
    \ techniques such as graphs, heatmaps, orthomosaics, and three-dimensional\nmodels\
    \ are employed, among others, to allow easy and intuitive representation of the\
    \ knowledge\nacquired from the ﬁeld monitoring. The farmer can inspect the results\
    \ produced by the services\nof the system and take action accordingly.\nInformation\
    \ 2019, 10, 348\n5 of 25\nEnergy-saving mechanisms and data privacy and security\
    \ techniques are also considered to be\nvery important in the context of Smart\
    \ farming and should be applied vertically in all the layers of\nthe architecture.\
    \ To support the efﬁciency and effectiveness of a smart farming monitoring system\n\
    energy consumption should be kept under control. Due to the limited battery life\
    \ and constrained\nresources of sensor nodes, energy-saving techniques must be\
    \ applied across the sensor and network\nlayer accordingly. Energy-saving techniques\
    \ deal with the active and inactive operational time\nin each sensor node, the\
    \ scheduling of information transmission and the routing process of data\npackets.\
    \ Moreover, security mechanisms are vital for maintaining the privacy of the collected\
    \ data and\nsafeguarding farmers’ personal information exchange.\n3. The Sensor\
    \ Layer\nThe Sensor Layer is in charge of acquiring the data of the different\
    \ climatic and soil variables\ninvolved in the growth and production of the crops.\
    \ Data can be acquired either by ground sensors,\nlocated above or inside the\
    \ soil, or by UAV sensors involving embedded cameras, location and other\nsensors.\
    \ The Sensor Layer constitutes the cradle of modern EO approaches towards optimizing\n\
    decision support in remote sensing monitoring systems. EO monitoring of cultivation\
    \ areas is\nhighly enhanced using autonomous UAVs. Popular EO techniques include\
    \ satellite and radar-based\ntechnologies [13] towards estimating basic biophysical\
    \ parameters in the ﬁelds, such as Leaf Area\nIndex (LAI), crop height and water\
    \ requirements [14,15]. According to [16] radar-based technologies\nare used to\
    \ enable the estimation of soil moisture spatial variability and can efﬁciently\
    \ estimate LAI.\nHowever, EO can achieve sturdy higher spatial resolutions only\
    \ with calibration against accurate\nground truth instruments that measure at\
    \ within ﬁeld scale resolutions. UAVs deploy EO via using\nphotogrammetry techniques\
    \ enabling the generation of three-dimensional digital surface models of the\n\
    ﬁelds. In particular, autonomous, manual or GPS-based image acquisition, ortho-image\
    \ generation and\nimage triangulation and geo-referencing based on navigation\
    \ sensors are employed. More information\nregarding these methods is provided\
    \ in Sections 5 and 8.2. In the Sensor Layer each sensor sends the\nacquired data\
    \ in the cloud through a WSN. The WSN is made up of sensor nodes that operate\
    \ under a\nmesh or point-to-point topology, a coordinator node and a gateway.\
    \ Each node in such a network is\nconnected to one or more sensors [17]. In precision\
    \ agriculture the most important types of sensors for\nmeasuring the different\
    \ types of corps attributes are:\n•\nOptical Sensors/UAV Sensors: Optical sensors\
    \ are usually embedded in UAVs and use light\nreﬂection information to measure\
    \ the varying properties of soil and vegetation. In that case,\nthe sensors acquire\
    \ image data, which are further analyzed with photogrammetry techniques.\nObject\
    \ detectors and pattern recognition form the basic building block for extracting\
    \ information\nfrom the images. Such information may involve the vegetation and\
    \ soil color, the moisture\ncontent and temperature of soil and vegetation, the\
    \ position, height, size and shape of vegetation\nalong with the level of chlorophyll.\
    \ In this category we ﬁnd visible light sensors, multispectral\nsensors, hyperspectral\
    \ sensors and thermal sensors.\n•\nElectrochemical Sensors/Ground Sensors: These\
    \ types of sensors acquire data regarding the\nnutrient contents of soil and its\
    \ associated pH. Electrodes in these sensors work by detecting\nspeciﬁc ions in\
    \ the soil. Different families of electrochemical sensors can be recognized depending\n\
    on the electrical magnitude used for transduction of the recognition event: potentiometric,\
    \ which\nindicates change of membrane potential; conductometric, which indicates\
    \ change of conductance;\nimpedimetric, which indicates change of impedance; and\
    \ voltammetric or amperometric, which\nindicates change of current for an electrochemical\
    \ reaction with the applied voltage in the ﬁrst\ncase, or with time at a ﬁxed\
    \ applied potential in the latter.\n•\nLocation Sensors/UAV Sensors: Location\
    \ sensors are usually embedded in UAVs and provide\nspatial information regarding\
    \ the positioning of an element. These types of sensors use signals\nfrom GPS\
    \ satellites to determine latitude, longitude, and altitude to within feet. Three\
    \ satellites\nminimum are required to triangulate a position. Precise positioning\
    \ is the cornerstone of precision\nInformation 2019, 10, 348\n6 of 25\nagriculture.\
    \ GPS integrated circuits such as the NJR NJG1157PCD-TE1 are a good example of\n\
    location sensors.\n•\nWeather Stations/Ground Sensors: Weather stations are free-standing\
    \ units situated at different\nlocations throughout the cultivating ﬁelds. These\
    \ stations measure various data for precision\nagriculture such as airﬂow, seasonal\
    \ rainfall, speed of wind, humidity level, direction of wind,\natmospheric pressure\
    \ and solar radiation, etc. Weather stations are an important component\nof EO\
    \ technologies since they can provide daily agro-meteorological information regarding\
    \ the\ncultivating ﬁelds.\nSummarizing the above, Table 1 presents the most frequently\
    \ acquired data by sensors in the\nagricultural domain. A sensor node consists\
    \ of a radio transceiver with an internal antenna or a\nconnection to an external\
    \ antenna, a micro-controller, an electronic circuit for interfacing with the\n\
    sensors and an energy source, usually a battery or a built-in energy harvested\
    \ form. There are numerous\ncommercial models of micro-controllers to be used\
    \ in precision agriculture applications. The most\npopular ones are the Arduino,\
    \ the Raspberry Pi, the Atmega328 and the LPC2148 boards. Accordingly,\ncommonly\
    \ used wireless communication modules used are the XBee module, the WSN802G module\n\
    and the NRF24L01 module. A sensor node can vary in size and cost, depending on\
    \ the complexity\nof its capabilities. Size and cost constraints result in corresponding\
    \ limitations on resources such as\nenergy, memory, computing speed, and bandwidth\
    \ of communications. The types of sensors that are\nmostly used in Smart farming\
    \ monitoring systems are summarized in Table 2.\nTable 1. Precision agriculture\

    In precision agriculture WSN communication protocols and technologies are used\
    \ to support\nthe connection between sensor nodes in the network and to provide\
    \ a channel for communication\nbetween the coordinator node and the gateway. According\
    \ to the type of application, such as precision\nfarming, ﬁeld irrigation management\
    \ or greenhouse crop management, the sensor network topology\nand communication\
    \ demands may differ. Hardware and software characteristics may also affect\n\
    the choice of communication technology to be used between the nodes. Each node\
    \ uses a routing\nprotocol [18] in the view of transferring the data collected\
    \ to the coordinator node.\nBased on many experimental studies on agricultural\
    \ ﬁelds, there is not an ideal combination of a\nspeciﬁc communication technology\
    \ and a routing protocol. Discovering and keeping up with routes in\nWSNs is a\
    \ quite demanding task since energy restrictions and alterations in node status,\
    \ such as failure\nmay cause sudden changes in the network topology. It is a fact\
    \ that the wireless routing solution for\nagriculture applications should be highly\
    \ energy-efﬁcient, scalable, and autonomous. Up until now\nrouting tactics proposed\
    \ in the literature for WSNs employ speciﬁc methods such as data aggregation,\n\
    clustering, different node role assignment and data-centric methods.\nThe basic\
    \ goal is to build each smart monitoring system upon application appropriate networking\n\
    technologies to operate efﬁciently with minimum energy consumption. Once the coordinator\
    \ node\nobtains the data it forwards the ﬂow of information to the gateway to\
    \ reach the main server, where\nthe database is located. However, in some cases\
    \ the coordinator node can be substituted by a base\nstation to obtain the collected\
    \ data using a Wi-Fi connection as presented in [2], or another cellular\ncommunication\
    \ technology.\n4.1.1. Precision Agriculture Communication Protocols\nThere is\
    \ a wide variety of networking technologies suitable for the deployment of smart\
    \ farming\napplications. The most popular are the following:\n•\nThe IEEE 802.15.4\
    \ standard is a widely used networking technology in precision agriculture and\n\
    deﬁnes the physical layer and the Media Access Control (MAC) technique in Low-Rate\
    \ Wireless\nPersonal Area Networks (LR-WPANs).\n•\nZigBee is another suitable\
    \ technology for short range radio communication in the ﬁelds using\nlow-power\
    \ devices capable of transmitting data over long distances using intermediate\
    \ stations.\nInformation 2019, 10, 348\n8 of 25\n•\nLoRa is a type of wireless\
    \ conﬁguration that has been created to achieve long-range connections\nfor Low-power\
    \ Wide Area Networks (LPWANs).\nLoRAWAN is a protocol for managing\ncommunication\
    \ between LPWAN gateways and nodes.\n•\nBluetooth Low Energy is a global personal\
    \ area network protocol built for transmitting small\ndata pieces infrequently\
    \ at low rates with signiﬁcantly low power consumption per bit.\n•\nRFID (Radio\
    \ Frequency Identiﬁcation) is a different technology that uses radio signals to\
    \ monitor\nand identify in real time objects without requiring line-of-sight communication.\
    \ An RFID\nsystem includes a reader, a tag, and a host and is presented as ideal\
    \ for ﬁeld monitoring in\nmultiple studies.\nMoreover, the communication between\
    \ sensor nodes and a base station can be supported by:\n•\nthe Wi-Fi protocol,\
    \ based on the IEEE 802.11 standard. This standard speciﬁes the set of media\n\
    access control (MAC) and physical layer (PHY) protocols for implementing wireless\
    \ local area\nnetwork (WLAN) Wi-Fi computer communication in various frequencies.\n\
    •\nthe GSM (Global System for Mobile Communications), a standard developed by\
    \ the European\nTelecommunications Standards Institute (ETSI) to describe the\
    \ protocols for second-generation\n(2G) digital cellular networks used by mobile\
    \ devices such as mobile phones and tablets.\n•\nthe GPRS (General Packet Radio\
    \ Service) technology standard that provides rapid sending and\nreceiving of data\
    \ over the GSM mobile networks based on packet switching, a well-known\nnetwork\
    \ transmission process.\n•\nthe 2G, 3G and 4G (LTE) are respectively the 2nd,\
    \ 3rd and 4th generation of GSM technology\naiming at higher speeds.\nTable 3\

    \ Agriculture Routing Protocols\nData routing algorithms play an important role\
    \ in WSNs by establishing the path of\ncommunication for data exchange between\
    \ sensor nodes and base stations on a network. A variety\nof routing techniques\
    \ have been proposed until now, aiming to achieve higher performance with\nminimal\
    \ power consumption. IoT and WSN routing protocols can be categorized according\
    \ to network\nstructure and the way information will be disseminated through the\
    \ network. A routing protocol can\nbelong to more than one category, aiming to\
    \ satisfy as many performance metrics as possible.\nAccording to the way by which\
    \ routing decisions are made proactive and reactive routing\ntechniques can be\
    \ used. Proactive routing (or table-driven) supports the periodic renewal and\n\
    updating of the routes and destinations that are formed between the nodes throughout\
    \ the network.\nOn the other hand, reactive routing (or on demand) includes discovering\
    \ routes on demand based\non the transmission of route request packets. The downside\
    \ to reactive protocols is their latency,\nsince transmissions over unknown or\
    \ expired routes face delays, for which either the application or\nthe routing\
    \ protocol must account by buffering or dropping data.\nInformation 2019, 10,\
    \ 348\n9 of 25\nFurthermore, according to WSN structure, routing algorithms can\
    \ depend on neighbor nodes to\nbroadcast the collected information. Another popular\
    \ technique is based on dividing the network into\nclusters. Each cluster depends\
    \ on a cluster head node to manage the routing of information between\nother clusters\
    \ or base stations. Hierarchical routing is the most popular routing method in\
    \ smart\nfarming monitoring systems and soil parameter monitoring [23,24]. Multi-path\
    \ routing protocols\ncan also be used to implement a smart farm monitoring system\
    \ to balance the data transfer load and\nconserved energy. Table 4 presents characteristic\
    \ examples of routing protocols adopted in smart\nfarming systems according to\

    \ monitoring applications are based on machine to\nmachine (M2M) communication\
    \ support regarding real-time data transmission. There is a variety\nof communication\
    \ patterns to be used so that the terminal can receive the information necessary\
    \ to\nmonitor the production. WSN technologies, enhanced by the IoT paradigm,\
    \ enable smart sensor\ncommunication and connection to the IPv6-based internet,\
    \ by addressing the agricultural sensors\nwith IPv6 long addresses that can ﬁt\
    \ in lightweight IoT data link frames. IoT can immensely improve\nthe autonomous\
    \ capabilities of resourced-constrained nodes in a Low-power and Lossy Network\n\
    (LLN). An agricultural WSN is a LLN. In such a network, some of the nodes may\
    \ have a direct\nInternet connection to send and receive messages from the Internet.\
    \ However, other nodes from the\nsame network, may lack that kind of ability due\
    \ to hardware limitations, and require the use of the\nInternet-connected nodes\
    \ to access external services. Data exchange in a local context is also possible\n\
    without the necessity of transmitting data to the Internet. The task of discovering\
    \ the routes and\nallowing data messages to be transmitted among agricultural\
    \ sensor nodes is performed by the routing\nprotocol. Due to this fact, in such\
    \ networks, network performance is strongly related to how the\nrouting protocols\
    \ use the limited hardware resources of the network device.\n•\nThe 6LoWPAN [7,26]\
    \ is the most popular network encapsulation protocol for precision agriculture\n\
    applications. It refers to the transmission of IPv6 protocol packets over Low-Power\
    \ Wireless\nInformation 2019, 10, 348\n10 of 25\nPersonal Area Networks. In a\
    \ smart farming monitoring system, it is used by sensor devices that\nare compatible\
    \ with the IEEE802.15.4 standard for WSNs. 6LoWPAN efﬁciently encapsulates\nIPv6\
    \ long headers in IEEE 802.15.4 small data frames for information exchange between\
    \ sensor\nnodes. The advantages of this protocol are that it uses a special header\
    \ compression method and\na fragmentation process to reduce the transmission overhead\
    \ [10].\n•\nThe IPv6 over LoRa [27] implementation enables the transmission of\
    \ IPv6 protocol packets over\nLoRa links. If LoRaWAN is chosen for sensor node\
    \ communication in a smart farming monitoring\nsystem, LoRa is the MAC protocol\
    \ responsible for establishing communication between the\nLoRa gateway and the\
    \ LoRa sensor end devices. In an agriculture monitoring system, the IPv6\nadaptation\
    \ enables the deployment of the IoT paradigm as a separate architectural layer.\
    \ The basic\naim of this layer is to manage header compression and packet fragmentation\
    \ to deal with the\nrequirements of LoRa modulation in the physical layer.\n•\n\
    The IPv6 over 802.11ah [10] or Wi-Fi-ah (HaLow) is a low-power/low-rate protocol\
    \ able to support\nnumerous sensor node devices on a single base station. This\
    \ technology can be used for precision\nagriculture by enabling wireless base\
    \ stations in the ﬁeld to transmit data while also being energy\nconservative.\
    \ Wi-Fi-ah (HaLow) uses special characteristics of the 6LoWPAN technology for\n\
    effective transmission of IPv6 protocol packets over IEEE 802.11ah wireless networks.\n\
    •\nRPL (IPv6 Routing over Low Power and Lossy Networks) [26] is the most popular\
    \ IoT routing\nprotocol based on the distance vector routing technique. It is\
    \ a proactive protocol that constructs\na speciﬁc graph able to direct all trafﬁc\
    \ towards the sink node. RPL is the ideal routing protocol\nfor agricultural LLNs,\
    \ since it can quickly create network routes between sensor nodes in the\nﬁeld,\
    \ share routing knowledge and adapt the topology in an efﬁcient way. It is also\
    \ efﬁcient for\nmulti-hop, many-to-one and one-to-one communication.\n•\nLOADng-IoT\
    \ is another IoT routing protocol, proposed in [28] as an enhancement for reactive\n\
    protocol LOADng, which is considered to be the best current solution for LLNs.\
    \ LOADng-IoT is\nable to boost the process of route discovery, reduce the overhead\
    \ of control messages, and improve\nthe network′s quality-of-service(QoS). In\
    \ a smart farm monitoring system, this protocol will allow\nsensor nodes without\
    \ an Internet connection to forward their data packets to external Internet\n\
    services with much greater reliability and lower latency.\n4.3. The Middleware\
    \ Layer\nThe Middleware Layer is responsible for establishing and controlling\
    \ the association between\nIoT sensor devices. More speciﬁcally, the services\
    \ of this layer include smart device management by\nthe use of different transport\
    \ protocols to forward the generated data from the involved IoT devices.\nMost\
    \ of these transport standards use the Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) or\
    \ the User Datagram\nProtocol (UDP) for forwarding information. There is a wide\
    \ variety of data protocols [29] that belong\nto this layer towards developing\
    \ an efﬁcient managing platform for smart ﬁeld devices. However,\nchoosing the\
    \ most appropriate device management technology depends on software and hardware\n\
    speciﬁcations, network and technology architecture and communication standards\
    \ being used in the\naccording system to achieve maximum and efﬁcient performance.\
    \ In the view of using different kind of\nsmart entities in an agriculture monitoring\
    \ system, the services of this architectural layer facilitate the\ndesired interoperability\
    \ of the technologies introduced. All collected data will be stored on a remote\n\
    server and transmitted to the client machine through Application Programming Interfaces\
    \ (APIs) that\nprovide web services for third-party users. APIs enable device\
    \ communication in an application level\nfor different kinds of purposes and are\
    \ based on different architectures to transfer data from the server\nto the client.\n\
    •\nThe MQTT-SN (Message Queuing Telemetry Transport For Sensor Networks) is a\
    \ messaging\nprotocol that facilitates device data collection and communication\
    \ with servers using brokers.\nA broker is a network entity which arranges transactions\
    \ between other network entities. By using\nthe MQTT protocol, a precision agriculture\
    \ monitoring system can enable smart sensor devices to\nInformation 2019, 10,\
    \ 348\n11 of 25\npublish messages to a broker and/or subscribe to a broker in\
    \ order to receive certain messages.\nThe exchanged messages will be organized\
    \ by topics that act as a system for dispatching messages\nto subscribers.\n•\n\
    The CoAP (Constrained Application Protocol) is another popular protocol for IoT\
    \ device\ndata management. CoAP is based on a request/response pattern of communication\
    \ allowing\nconstrained devices to have web service functionalities. It is an\
    \ HTTP-like web transfer protocol\nwith the ability to extend the Representational\
    \ State Transfer (REST) architecture to Low-Power\nWireless Personal Area Networks\
    \ (LoWPANs). REST is an architectural style for providing\nstandards between computer\
    \ systems on the web, while distinguishing the concerns of client\nand server.\n\
    •\nThe XMPP-IoT (Extensible Messaging and Presence Protocol) is an open technology\
    \ for real-time\ncommunication based on XML messages between connected devices\
    \ and the available server.\nXMPP can efﬁciently power instant messaging, collaboration\
    \ and content syndication in a smart\nfarm monitoring system between all network\
    \ entities.\n•\nDevice and asset management in a precision agriculture monitoring\
    \ system can also be\nimplemented using the Mihini [30] software.\nMihini is an\
    \ open-source project by Eclipse\nTechnology that enables communication between\
    \ an M2M server and the applications running\non an embedded gateway. M3DA is\
    \ the protocol used for the transport of M2M data. M3DA can\nallow user applications\
    \ to exchange typed data/commands back and forth with an M2M server,\nin a way\
    \ that optimizes the use of bandwidth.\n•\nThe OMA SpecWorks’s Lightweight M2M\
    \ [31] is another device management protocol for M2M\nor IoT devices. It can be\
    \ used in a smart farming information system to efﬁciently transfer\nservice data\
    \ from the network to resource-constrained devices. In contrast to traditional\
    \ M2M\nstandards in which a device usually needs to keep up multiple stacks of\
    \ technologies, protocols\nand security services, the LwM2M scheme allows the\
    \ existence of one stack of technology for\ndevice management, not only on the\
    \ level of the device itself, but also on the application level.\nIn addition,\
    \ LwM2M is based on protocol and security standards from the Internet Engineering\n\
    Task Force (IETF).\n•\nThe ONEM2M [32] technical speciﬁcation standards are an\
    \ upcoming solution for device and\nasset management in precision agriculture.\
    \ ONEM2M is a middleware IoT platform that provides\nfunctions and APIs for different\
    \ service domains dealing with interoperability challenges. There\nare commercial\
    \ and open-source implementations of this technology.\n•\nA popular queuing protocol\
    \ for enabling server connection in IoT is the AMQP (Advanced\nMessage Queuing\
    \ Protocol). This open standard protocol can facilitate message orientation,\n\
    queuing, routing, reliability and security in precision agriculture applications.\n\
    •\nLast but not least, the DDS (Data-Distribution Service) [33] is the ﬁrst open\
    \ international M2M\nstandard directly addressing publish-subscribe communications\
    \ for real-time and embedded\nsystems. This protocol has the advantage of providing\
    \ fast data, event, and command exchange\namong the IoT sensor nodes in a precision\
    \ agriculture monitoring system.\n4.4. The Conﬁguration Layer\nThe Conﬁguration\
    \ Layer deals with protocols running on top of the IoT monitoring platform\nallowing\
    \ the exchange of data speciﬁed by its context regarding what is described, what\
    \ was measured,\nwhen, where, by what, the time of validity, ownership, and others.\
    \ The main objective of this layer\nis to curate, harmonize and aggregate the\
    \ collected raw data, so that it can be published as context\ninformation, or\
    \ supplied to upstream data processing algorithms or analytics. It is also capable\
    \ of\nsending operational commands to the Middleware Layer. Context information\
    \ is a term widely used\nin IoT research and characterizes data that may come\
    \ from existing systems, users, through mobile\napplications, IoT smart devices,\
    \ agricultural machinery or public geo-services. The Conﬁguration layer\nuses\
    \ an IoT broker to guarantee a common interpretation of information produced by\
    \ heterogeneous\ndata sources that typically employ different data formats and\
    \ ontologies, and therefore are unable to\nInformation 2019, 10, 348\n12 of 25\n\
    directly share information among them. An IoT broker enables the forwarding of\
    \ lower-level device\ninformation to higher-level Thing Information.\n•\nRegarding\
    \ precision agriculture applications, a popular context broker is implemented\
    \ by the\nFIWARE NGSI technology, named Orion Context Broker. FIWARE is a framework\
    \ of open-source\nplatform components towards the deployment of the IoT paradigm.\
    \ FIWARE NGSI is the FIWARE\nversion of the OMA NGSI, an API based on HTTP that\
    \ enables the integration of components\nand provides the basis for the interoperability\
    \ and portability of IoT-enabled Smart Agriculture\napplications [34]. NGSI is\
    \ an information model developed by OMA SpecWorks to manage\ncontext information\
    \ with a meta-model based on entities, attributes and metadata. This protocol\n\
    manages data concerning context entities, such as the lifetime and quality of\
    \ information.\n•\nThe implementation of a smart farming monitoring system is\
    \ greatly depended upon geo-services,\nlocation detection tools and mapping technologies.\
    \ In such systems, the exchange of geographical\ninformation should be effortlessly\
    \ accomplished between the involved network entities across\nthe web. The Open\
    \ Geospatial Consortium-Web Feature Service (OGC-WFS) [35] constitutes a\ndesirable\
    \ asset in formulating geographic information and offering direct ﬁne-grained\
    \ access\nat feature property level of the data to IoT sensor nodes in precision\
    \ agriculture applications.\nOGC offers various standards that can ease the way\
    \ location data is exchanged and stored in\na smart farming system that is based\
    \ on drone monitoring. Furthermore, the OpenGIS Web\nMap Service Interface Standard\
    \ (WMS) [35] can be efﬁciently used by UAVs, since it provides a\nsimple HTTP\
    \ interface for requesting geo-registered map images from one or more distributed\n\
    geospatial databases.\n5. The Management Layer\nIn a smart farming monitoring\
    \ system, the basic component of intelligence is considered to be the\nstudy and\
    \ ﬁltering of the collected data. The use of EO techniques enable the advance\
    \ of cultivation\nprocedures and increase productivity by providing the base layer\
    \ for spatial information analysis and\nmonitoring of agricultural activities.\
    \ A large percentage of smart agriculture applications are based\non simulators,\
    \ commercial programs and speciﬁc programming languages for implementing and\n\
    controlling the data system. The Management layer uses modern software tools to\
    \ efﬁciently satisfy\nmultiple tasks, presented in Table 5.\nInformation management\
    \ is deployed so the farmer can consult, record and modify the\ninformation collected\
    \ by the sensors in tables, statistical graphs and interactive maps. In addition,\n\
    it can download daily, monthly and annual reports of historical data. However,\
    \ the farmer can\nmainly see the current data of the monitored variables of one\
    \ or all the WSN nodes and consult the\nhistory. The interaction with the network\
    \ and services layer is achieved using an intermediate layer of\nmanagement logic\
    \ [36]. WSN data will be stored in an online database [37].\nThe system also enables\
    \ Big Data analytics in agriculture monitoring by using tools such as\nthe Apache\
    \ Hadoop software and various Big Data hardware platforms [38] as possible resources.\n\
    Big Data refers to information assets characterized by such a high volume, velocity\
    \ and variety\nable to require speciﬁc technology and analytical methods for its\
    \ transformation into value [39].\nIn precision agriculture smart applications,\
    \ the collected data are recorded in a speciﬁc format,\nto discover patterns,\
    \ correct errors, eliminate duplicate and inconsistencies and to solve noise problems.\n\
    Big Data technologies are playing an essential role in modern farming systems,\
    \ since predictive insights\nare provided regarding optimizing the quality of\
    \ the crop, minimizing environmental impact, reducing\ncosts, increasing proﬁt\
    \ and generally optimizing production efﬁciency. In addition, Big Data enable\
    \ the\nmanagement of real-time operational decisions and the redesign of business\
    \ processes for advancing\nthe food supply chain.\nFurthermore, the proposed architectural\
    \ scheme promotes various data processing techniques that\nupgrade the impact\
    \ of EO technologies in agriculture. EO by satellite leads to the acquisition\
    \ of regular\nor spatially continuous data regarding large areas. It provides\
    \ essential information on the functioning\nInformation 2019, 10, 348\n13 of 25\n\
    of ﬁelds and on the causes of environmental change. UAVs enable EO by using photogrammetry\n\
    techniques to extract three-dimensional digital surface models of the ﬁeld, as\
    \ well as orthophotographs.\nOne popular algorithm for this purpose is Structure\
    \ from Motion (SfM) [40]. An orthophotograph\ncan be used to create a realistic\
    \ map of the ﬁelds by measuring true distances and providing to the\nfarmer a\
    \ clearer helpful view from the sky. Based on photographs, digital image processing\
    \ tools,\nsuch as Pix4Dmapper can calculate various vegetation indices that can\
    \ lead to conclusions, either\non each photograph individually or after the production\
    \ of orthophotos regarding the crops’ state.\nVegetation indices are mathematical\
    \ quantitative combinations of the absorption and scattering of\nplant in different\
    \ bands of the electromagnetic spectrum [41]. Calculating vegetation indices will\
    \ help\nto identify useful crop characteristics concerning important biological\
    \ and physical parameters of the\nvegetation. The best-known vegetation index\
    \ is the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI),\nwhich is the evolution\
    \ of the vegetation index ratio and is calculated by the visible and near infrared\n\
    light reﬂected from the vegetation.\nLast but not least, the smart agriculture\
    \ monitoring system also performs data mining processes\nbased on tools such as\
    \ the Apache Mahout Framework so as to identify and discover hidden patterns\n\
    in the collected data, once they are processed, in the form of reviews. In addition,\
    \ Machine Learning\ntechniques will be used in the smart monitoring platform in\
    \ order to estimate the extracted parameters\nof the crops’ growth rate and also\
    \ help to identify objects or animals trough the collected images by\nusing Object-Based\
    \ Image Analysis (OBIA) [42]. Moreover, new machine learning models—algorithms\n\
    focused on data classiﬁcation [43,44]—can be used to minimize the size of redundant\
    \ data and fasten\nthe analysis.\nTable 5. Smart farming monitoring system services.\n\

    \ monitoring system architecture, the farmer can\ninteract with the IoT applications\
    \ of the system to remotely manage the cultivation process.\nSuch applications\
    \ may concern any aspect of the agricultural ﬁeld ranging from planting and irrigation\n\
    processes to plant protection and harvesting methods [45]. The applications that\
    \ can be adopted may\ninvolve the fertilizer application, the weed mapping, the\
    \ spraying process, the irrigation of the ﬁeld\nand the alert system.\nThe Variable\
    \ Rate Fertilizer (VRF) application has as a target to optimize the usage of nutrients\
    \ by\ndeﬁning the amount of fertilizer applied based on the health of the plant.\
    \ Variable rate fertilizer in\nprecision agriculture is an area of technology\
    \ that focuses on the automated application of fertilizer to\na given landscape.\
    \ The way in which the materials are applied is based on data that is collected\
    \ by\nsensors, maps, and GPS. VRF applications bring several beneﬁts related to\
    \ savings on fertilizers and\nchemicals, potential yield increase and environmental\
    \ protection. In the same context is the Variable\nSpraying application. These\
    \ types of applications implement controllers that turn the herbicide\nsprayers\
    \ on and off. Usually variable spraying applications take into consideration information\n\
    coming from the weed mapping tools such as the weed locations. In that case the\
    \ appropriate volume\nof herbicide is estimated and applied in the ﬁeld based\
    \ on the weed intensity.\nThe Weed Mapping application focuses on the visualization\
    \ of the weed occurrences within\na certain crop ﬁeld with the help of mappings.\
    \ The GPS receiver with an aerial vehicle generates\nmaps which show the weed\
    \ occurrences. These weed maps can be combined with fertilizer maps\nand yield\
    \ maps. The IoT-based irrigation system use a micro-controller that serves as\
    \ information\ngateway receiving real-time information from soil moisture and\
    \ temperature sensors placed on the\nﬁelds. Generally, a moisture/temperature\
    \ threshold is speciﬁed based on which the micro-controller\nautomatically switches\
    \ on the water pump. The micro-controller also has servo motors to ensure that\n\
    the area is uniformly irrigated. The entire system can be managed remotely by\
    \ the end-user through\nthe dedicated application.\nAlert/ notiﬁcation applications\
    \ are also very popular in IoT-based precision agriculture. Producers\nand agriculture\
    \ companies implement IoT solutions for instantly tracking their crop ﬁelds. In\
    \ this case,\nthe data coming from IoT devices is processed and transformed into\
    \ knowledge properly visualized\nfor offering information regarding the health\
    \ of the vegetation and the soil, the behavior patterns of\nthe plants, detect\
    \ signs of disease on time, identify insects and harmful animals and instantly\
    \ alert\nproducers about potential difﬁculties. This type of applications serves\
    \ for storing and analyzing data,\nproviding producers with relevant recommendations.\n\
    The aforementioned applications aim at the efﬁcient ﬁeld and crop management to:\n\
    •\nincrease production efﬁciency\n•\nimprove product quality\n•\nprovide more\
    \ efﬁcient use of chemicals in cultivation\n•\nmanage pesticide amounts\n•\nreduce\
    \ energy consumption\n•\nprotect the soil\n•\ncontrol water consumption and underground\
    \ water amounts\nThe IoT-based agriculture applications can be implemented for\
    \ an Android or Windows\nsmart-phone, a tablet or as a web application. The applications\
    \ of IoT-based smart farming apart from\nconventional, large farming operations,\
    \ targets also other growing or common trends in agricultural\nsuch as organic\
    \ farming, family farming (complex or small spaces, particular cattle and/or cultures,\n\
    preservation of particular or high quality varieties etc.), and enhance highly\
    \ transparent farming. Our\nprecision agriculture monitoring system can also beneﬁt\
    \ the dry farming technique that encompass\nspeciﬁc agricultural techniques for\
    \ the non-irrigated cultivation of crops. Furthermore, greenhouses\ncan use our\
    \ architectural model to intelligently monitor as well as control the climate,\
    \ eliminating the\nneed for manual intervention.\nInformation 2019, 10, 348\n\

    \ Technologies\nIn precision farming applications sensor nodes are usually powered\
    \ by low-energy batteries that\nare difﬁcult or impossible to recharge or replace.\
    \ This is considered to be a major disadvantage to\nmaintain a real-time monitoring\
    \ system. Energy-saving techniques is vital to maintain the system’s\nefﬁciency\
    \ in smart farming. This kind of techniques can provide battery life extension\
    \ by reducing the\namount of communication between the nodes and the base station,\
    \ while minimizing the redundant\ndata in the network. Energy preservation techniques\
    \ for precision agriculture systems are presented as\na separate architectural\
    \ level covering the sensing and networking procedures of smart farming.\nIn the\
    \ Sensor layer, the proposed energy-saving approach is an on/off process which\
    \ is based on\nthe selection of a subset of nodes that will remain active for\
    \ a certain period of time, while others remain\ninactive. Following this assumption,\
    \ SWORD (sleep/wake on redundant data) is an energy preserving\nscheme that can\
    \ be used to collect data on soil moisture [19]. The SWORD algorithm performs\
    \ data\ncontrol by removing redundant data so as to minimize energy consumption\
    \ and increase the life of\nsensor nodes in the network.\nIn the Network layer,\
    \ data transmissions and receptions can also be scheduled based on the\nsleep/awake\
    \ periods of sensor nodes at predetermined intervals. For this purpose, A2S, an\
    \ automated\nagricultural precision tracking system can be used [46]. Based on\
    \ this energy-saving technology,\nwhenever the sensing period is set by the application\
    \ server, the sink node keeps the schedule and\nit spreads the sleep order message\
    \ over its network every sensing period. Each time a node receives\nthe sleep\
    \ message, it sets the sleep timer’s end time to the value of the duration ﬁeld\
    \ included in the\nmessage. When the meter time ends, the node detects the environment\
    \ and battery voltage level and\nsends the data to the source. Then, he expects\
    \ the next sleep request message.\nMoreover, another energy-saving scheduling\
    \ technique that can be deployed in the Network layer\ninvolves the use of unmanned\
    \ ﬂying vehicles in an agricultural crop monitoring system. Based on this\nscheme,\
    \ the node on the unmanned ﬂying vehicle wakes the ground nodes to retrieve the\
    \ measured\ndata. To perform this function, a coded radio signal is sent via a\
    \ transmitter to the ground nodes.\nThe nodes are in an inactive state, except\
    \ for a small receiver waiting to receive the trigger signal.\nFurthermore, taking\
    \ advantage of APTEEN hierarchical routing protocol, a time division multiple\n\
    access technique can be implemented as a scheduling method. Based on this technique,\
    \ messages are\nsent to put some nodes in sleep mode so as to avoid packet collisions\
    \ between sensor nodes belonging\nto different clusters. In addition, carrier\
    \ sense multiple access technique is another alternative method,\nwhich is equally\
    \ effective for avoiding collisions.\n7.2. Security Mechanisms\nPrecision agriculture\
    \ monitoring systems involve the exchange of sensitive information regarding\n\
    the cultivation process, the state of crops and personal data of authorized staff.\
    \ It is of great importance\nfor such systems to be protected against cyber-attacks.\
    \ An unauthorized entry of a malicious individual\nin the system may cause great\
    \ damage to the cultivation process or even acquire the farmers personal\ninformation\
    \ [47]. In the pursuit of safeguarding a smart farm monitoring system the conﬁdentiality\n\
    of data should be met. In addition, it is vital to ensure the reliability of the\
    \ data and the ability to\nconﬁrm that a message has not been tampered with, altered\
    \ or changed while on the network. Also,\nthe services of resources offered by\
    \ the network, or by a single sensor node must be available whenever\nrequired\
    \ and ﬁnally to be able to identify the origin of a message received. Basic security\
    \ mechanisms\nare already deployed by the combined IoT technologies in every architectural\
    \ level of the proposed\nsmart monitoring system. However, there are more ways\
    \ to increase the level of security in each\nlayer separately.\nOne popular way\
    \ of providing physical layer security in WSN and IoT systems is cryptography.\n\
    Physical layer security refers to the inner security capabilities of the Sensor\
    \ layer regarding the\nInformation 2019, 10, 348\n16 of 25\nrandomness of wireless\
    \ channels, the signal-to-noise ratio gaps or intended jamming. There are\nthree\
    \ kinds of cryptographic methods used in WSNs, the symmetric and asymmetric ones\
    \ and hash\nfunctions. Hash functions are special mathematical functions which\
    \ map a given input to a certain\noutput with a ﬁxed size. Well-known cryptographically\
    \ secure hashes are the Secure Hash Algorithm-2\n(SHA-2) and Advanced Encryption\
    \ Standard (AES) algorithm. In symmetric cryptographic techniques,\na single shared\
    \ key is used between the two communicating nodes both for encryption and decryption.\n\
    This key stays known only to the nodes of the network. On the other hand, in asymmetric\
    \ cryptography,\na private key can be used to decrypt and sign data. A public\
    \ key is also used to encrypt and verify data.\nThe private key needs to be kept\
    \ conﬁdential while the public key can be published freely. Asymmetric\ncryptographic\
    \ techniques may use the RSA (Rivest–Shamir–Adleman) algorithm, the ECC (Elliptical\n\
    Curve Cryptography) algorithm or the pairing technique. Popular frameworks of\
    \ symmetric and\nasymmetric technique can be found in [48].\nRegarding the Link\
    \ layer of our proposed architecture security mechanisms focus against the\ninterception,\
    \ modiﬁcation and fabrication of the exchanged data. Attack detection mechanisms\
    \ can\nbe applied, such as the misbehavior-aware threshold detection scheme for\
    \ LLNs proposed in [49].\nIn addition, secure routing protocols may be used such\
    \ as SAR(Secure aware routing protocol), which is\nbased on on-demand protocol\
    \ such as AODV or DSR and DPRAODV (Detection, Prevention and\nReactiveAODV) [50].\n\
    Middleware security mechanisms deal with unauthorized modiﬁcations that occur\
    \ due to\ntransmission errors (accidental) and require the use of digital signatures.\
    \ Digital signature schemes\nare cryptographic schemes that include key generation\
    \ algorithms, signing algorithms and signature\nverifying algorithms. A digital\
    \ signature is an authentication mechanism that enables the creator of the\nmessage\
    \ to attach a code that acts as a signature. The Digital Signature Algorithm (DSA),\
    \ developed by\nthe National Institute of Standards and Technology, is one of\
    \ many examples of a signing algorithm.\nAccess control is an important building\
    \ block for the overall security of a precision agriculture\nmonitoring system.\
    \ The IoT requires access control models that apply authorization policies across\n\
    a multitude of smart sensors. In a smart farm monitoring platform, authentication\
    \ is required\nto prevent authorized users from accessing resources in an unauthorized\
    \ manner. For instance,\na worker in the ﬁelds is a legitimate user but does not\
    \ have the access rights as the main administrator\nfarmer. Most importantly,\
    \ access control prevents illegitimate users from gaining access to resources.\n\
    The Attribute-Based Access Control (ABAC) model is a technique that assigns attributes\
    \ to each entity\nin the system. The attributes may refer to either a user or\
    \ a resource and are deﬁned as properties\nof every entity to enable authentication.\
    \ Another paradigm able to provide solid communication in\nthe application layer\
    \ is the Role-Based Access Control model (RBAC) where a user is assigned as\n\
    administrator or ordinary user that predetermines access rights policies. In the\
    \ Application layer,\neach user can be authenticated by the use of passwords or\
    \ a smart key card [51].\n8. Use Case Study: The DIAS Architecture\nThe DIAS research\
    \ project stands for Drone Innovation in saffron Agriculture Surveillance.\nIt\
    \ is co-funded by the European Union and Greek national funds through the Operational\
    \ Program\nCompetitiveness, Entrepreneurship, and Innovation. University of Western\
    \ Macedonia (UOWM) in\ncooperation with Kozani Saffron Producers Cooperative (KSPC)\
    \ aims at developing an integrated\nautomated surveillance system for saffron\
    \ cultivation.\nThis 24 h real-time saffron cultivation\nsurveillance system is\
    \ relied on signal and image collecting and processing, which is derived from\n\
    advanced surveillance, risk identiﬁcation and early warning systems, based on\
    \ integrated sensor\nnetworks, and aerial unmanned vehicles.\n8.1. Saffron Cultivation\n\
    The saffron cultivation is considered to be of extreme importance for the Western\
    \ Macedonia\ncitizens, due to the activity over saffron cultivation by a large\
    \ number of citizens, the limited farming\nInformation 2019, 10, 348\n17 of 25\n\
    geography, the unique production process to plant the saffron seeds, and the unique\
    \ production risk\nthat this operation faces. The only kind of saffron that is\
    \ systematically cultivated around the world,\nfor at least ten centuries, is\
    \ the edible saffron or as it known in scientiﬁc (botanical) terminology Crocus\n\
    Sativus Linneaus.\nThe cultivation process includes harvesting the ﬂowers, as\
    \ presented in Figure 2, splitting the\nstigmas and stamens from the petals, drying\
    \ and sorting of saffron. The picking of 1000 ﬂowers is\nprocess of a duration\
    \ around 45–55 min, while additional 100 to 130 min are required for removing\n\
    the stigmas for drying. In total, 370 to 470 h are required to produce 1 kg of\
    \ dried saffron [52].\nThe ﬂowers are picked exactly when they are fully bloomed,\
    \ and the saffron strand or stigma is at its\nreddest. The harvesting process\
    \ begins shortly after dawn to minimize the further sunlight exposure\nto the\
    \ crops, since they may lose their color and even ﬂavor. Saffron cultivation requires\
    \ dry soil\nwith speciﬁc levels of moisture, controlled irrigation and right amounts\
    \ of nitrogen, phosphorus\nand potassium. Cultivation is commonly disturbed by\
    \ mice, moles and rats wrecking the stems.\nFurthermore, fungi may cause speciﬁc\
    \ diseases at the early stages of saffron growth.\nFigure 2. Saffron harvesting.\n\
    The DIAS platform aims to improve the production process, by offering the ability\
    \ of immediate\ninterference in case of animal, disease or wild weeds detection.\
    \ The farmer will be able to monitor the\nﬁelds in real time and getting alerts\
    \ in case of unwanted incidents regarding the state of the plants\nduring all\
    \ cultivation period, while raising proﬁts. To satisfy these goals, the monitoring\
    \ process will\nbe aligned speciﬁcally with the farmers concerns and actions during\
    \ each month of cultivation as\npresented in Figure 3.\nFigure 3. Saffron cultivation\
    \ yearly stages.\n8.2. DIAS Architecture\nThe DIAS platform follows the architectural\
    \ design of the proposed remote sensing monitoring\nsystem. As presented in Figure\
    \ 4 the DIAS system is consisted of seven architectural layers. In each\nlayer\
    \ the most suitable aforementioned technologies are used towards achieving the\
    \ overall system’s\nefﬁcient performance and reliable operations. The saffron\
    \ cultivation is a quite demanding and delicate\nprocess requiring the deployment\
    \ of tailor-based technologies and continuous crop monitoring to\navoid animal\
    \ and disease interventions.\nIn the Sensor layer, quadcopter UAVs with thermal,\
    \ hyperspectral and RGB cameras are being\nused in cooperation with multiple wireless\
    \ nodes equipped with various sensors for data collection\nregarding the crops.\
    \ Saffron cultivation monitoring requires the study of small sized crops and\n\
    the notice of minimal crop state variations during each month. To select the desired\
    \ information\nUAVs must ﬂy in a certain distance and place for a speciﬁc period\
    \ of time and by using different\nInformation 2019, 10, 348\n18 of 25\nposition\
    \ angles. Quadcopter UAVs is considered to be the best choice for saffron monitoring\
    \ since\nthey have rotary wings, which provide them with the ability of maneuverability,\
    \ while also ﬂying\nin low speed. Regarding RGB cameras, they are ideal since\
    \ saffron cultivation requires the capture\nof data-images in different weather\
    \ conditions avoiding inadequate or excessive exposure of the\nimage. Using multispectral\
    \ or hyperspectral sensors, UAVs can also obtain information related to\nspectral\
    \ absorption and reﬂection of the crops in several bands. This quite useful since\
    \ the provided\ninformation can then be used to calculate vegetation indices and\
    \ monitor the state of saffron crops\nbased on them. On the other hand, thermal\
    \ imaging detects speciﬁc levels of radiation and translates\nit into a grayscale\
    \ image, using brighter and darker shades of heat representation. This ability\
    \ is also\nessential in saffron cultivation since the ﬁelds are regularly trampled\
    \ by animals that are not being\ndetected on time in before they cause any damage.\
    \ The DIAS monitoring system uses different ground\nand on-leaf sensors to collect\
    \ useful data for improving the cultivation process. More speciﬁcally,\nenvironmental\
    \ humidity and temperature is evaluated since saffron requires speciﬁc conditions\
    \ to\nprosper. Additionally, the levels of luminosity, leaf-wetness, soil moisture,\
    \ pH and wind speed are also\nof great importance. Furthermore, the amounts of\
    \ nitrogen, phosphorus and potassium in the soil can\nhave a severe impact on\
    \ the plant’s growth, as well as the moisture levels in the soil. The farmer will\n\
    be able to predict production loss efﬁciently due to a round knowledge of the\
    \ saffron ﬁelds condition\nand even intervene with possible treatments to change\
    \ its course for the better.\nRegarding the Link and Encapsulation layer, sensor\
    \ data exchange in the DIAS platform is enabled\nby the LoRaWAN technology and\
    \ the IPv6 protocol. LoRa technology offers several advantages.\nThe LoRa physical\
    \ layer uses ISM bands 868 and 915 MHz—frequencies that are free to use anywhere\n\
    in the world. In addition, LoRa devices consume very little power making it ideal\
    \ for battery-powered\ndevices and it can also transmit and receive data for up\
    \ to 15 km in suburban areas and 5 km in\nurban areas. Another advantage of LoRa\
    \ is its high network capacity. In LoRaWAN, a single gateway\ncan accommodate\
    \ 1000 end-node devices. On the other hand, IPv6 offers large addressing space\n\
    and has built-in support for network auto-conﬁguration. In the DIAS platform,\
    \ each sensor node\nis characterized by its own IP address and uses a power saving\
    \ scheduling and routing protocol to\ntransmit the collected data to the nearest\
    \ LoRa Gateway. The information to be exchanged is encrypted\nbefore transmission.\
    \ Each LoRa gateway forwards the information to the according network router for\n\
    Internet access and data storage to the system’ database. UAVs’ data transmission\
    \ and communication\nis enabled by the IEEE 802.11ah networking standard in cooperation\
    \ with the IPv6 protocol, to forward\nthe collected images to the network server\
    \ as well.\nIn the Middleware layer, the DIAS platform will employ the MQTT-SN\
    \ protocol. MQTT-SN\nenables the management of all DIAS networking devices through\
    \ message exchanges coordinated by\nthe FIWARE’s context broker. It is essential\
    \ to maintain the monitoring’s system reliability towards\nachieving meaningful\
    \ data collection. Based on this protocol, the exchanged messages can be organized\n\
    by topics and importance regarding device management commands, transmission requests\
    \ initiated by\na higher layer and data acquisition. Sixteen number of message\
    \ types are supported and transmitted\nin an asynchronous way of communication\
    \ by the publish-subscribe model. TCP and UDP will also be\nused as transport\
    \ protocols. MQTT is ideal for the DIAS system since it excels in smart sensor\
    \ device\ncommunication on a wide area network, due to the publish/subscribe architecture\
    \ with the broker\nin the middle. MQTT is also very useful if the bandwidth is\
    \ limited to enhance network reliability\nand availability.\nIn the according\
    \ Conﬁguration layer, all saffron ﬁeld collected data will be grouped and\nformulated\
    \ to reach the information management unit. This layer facilitates the FIWARE\
    \ NGSI\nAPI so to produce the desired information model of the acquired ﬁeld data\
    \ based on efﬁcient\ncontext management.\nThe FIWARE’s Orion Context Broker has\
    \ powerful features enhancing\nthe capabilities and performance of the DIAS monitoring\
    \ system such as enabling asynchronous\napplication notiﬁcations. The basic operations\
    \ of the current layer include enabling the publication,\nInformation 2019, 10,\
    \ 348\n19 of 25\nconsumption, subscription and processing of all the information\
    \ relevant to the crops and the\ncultivation process in the DIAS platform.\nFigure\
    \ 4. The DIAS architecture.\nThe Management layer constitutes the basic operation\
    \ center of the DIAs platform. It stores,\nmaintains, analyzes the collected data\
    \ and produces predictions for the progress of the crops growth\nrate and statistics\
    \ regarding they current state. According to the commands acquired from the user\
    \ of\nthe platform in the highest architectural layer, the information management\
    \ logic initiates the according\nprocesses. Data processing includes the use of\
    \ the Random Forest machine learning classiﬁcation\nalgorithm for direct extraction\
    \ of conclusions regarding the growth and health of vegetation. This\nalgorithm\
    \ is directly applied on the data of the images acquired by the UAVs, evaluating\
    \ the RGB\nInformation 2019, 10, 348\n20 of 25\ncolors and the intensity of each\
    \ pixel. The Random Forest scheme performs very well with high\ndimensionality\
    \ and can handle binary features, categorical features, and numerical features.\
    \ This\nmethod is chosen since very little pre-processing is required and the\
    \ data does not need to be rescaled\nor transformed. Digital image processing\
    \ of geospatially corrected aerial images (orthophotographs)\nfocuses on producing\
    \ the according vegetation indexes for evaluating the state of saffron plants.\
    \ Two\nkind of vegetation indexes will be calculated by the PiX4D image processing\
    \ tool. Vegetation indexes\nderived from multispectral information, such as NDVI\
    \ will enable the detection of unhealthy or sparse\nvegetation that reﬂects more\
    \ visible light and less near infrared light, making it easy to monitor the\n\
    growth and health of saffron crops. On the other hand, regarding the use of RGB-based\
    \ Vegetation\nIndices, Excess Greenness Index (ExG) is based on the assumption\
    \ that saffron plants will display a\nclear high degree of greenness, while soil\
    \ being the only background element. Finally, the Normalized\nDifference Index\
    \ (NDI) will be also used since it can enable the separation of saffron plants\
    \ from\nsoil and residue background images, using only green and red channels.\
    \ Spectral information can\nhelp signiﬁcantly in assessing a lot biological and\
    \ physical characteristics of the saffron crops. Any\nkind of wild weeds or animal\
    \ detection based on thermal imaging in the ﬁelds initiates alerts for\nimmediate\
    \ intervention and is taken into consideration as a note in the cultivation calendar\
    \ created by\nthe platform for the farmer. For this purpose, the OBIA algorithm\
    \ is also used to recognize weeds or\ndiscriminate species. Object-based image\
    \ analysis is based on the comparison between sets of similar\npixels called image\
    \ objects in measures of spectral properties (i.e., color), size, shape, and texture,\n\
    as well as context. The OBIA algorithm is chosen since it is more suited to landscape-scale\
    \ analyses\nand can ﬁlter out meaningless information and assimilate other pieces\
    \ of information into a single\nobject. After processing, all the collected sensor\
    \ data are categorized and evaluated in accordance with\nthe desired vegetation\
    \ index values, moisture levels and general plant state for each month during\n\
    the cultivation process. For these tasks, the DIAS platform employs powerful and\
    \ well-known tools,\nthe Apache Spark Framework focusing on Big Data analytics\
    \ and the WEKA (Waikato Environment)\nFramework specializing in data mining tasks.\
    \ The evaluation results will point out the vulnerable\nspots in the ﬁeld with\
    \ helpful statistical graphs and suggest possible solutions to the farmer, such\
    \ as\nthe use of fertilizer.\nIn the Application Layer, each user can access the\
    \ DIAS platform by using his/her own unique\npassword. According to their authority\
    \ and activities in the saffron ﬁeld the users have different access\nrights in\
    \ the DIAS platform. A user may be the administrator of the platform, a representative\
    \ of the\nKSPC board, a farmer or a worker in the ﬁelds. For instance, a worker\
    \ can only observe the evaluation\nresults in order to aid the farmer in treating\
    \ the plant growth, while the KSPC representative can\nadd observation notes,\
    \ can schedule and initiate sensor data collection in a speciﬁc ﬁeld and also\n\
    manage the ﬂight plan of UAVs. On the other hand, the platform administrator is\
    \ only one who can\nadd new users and new saffron ﬁelds for cultivation to be\
    \ observed in the system. Access in the\nDIAS platform is forbidden for non-authorized\
    \ users. In the Application layer, the management of\nthe four basic operational\
    \ units of the DIAS system can be initiated. These are the Visualization Unit,\n\
    the Data Management Unit, the Prediction Unit and the Data collection Unit. By\
    \ entering the Data\ncollection Unit, a user can initiate sensor data collection\
    \ in a selected ﬁeld or modify existing data\nin the platform. By entering the\
    \ Data Management Unit, the user can evaluate orthophotographs\nand calculate\
    \ vegetation indexes according to speciﬁc data in a speciﬁc saffron ﬁeld with\
    \ the help of\nPix4DMapper tool. The Visualization Unit is related to the presentation\
    \ of statistical results and graphs\nregarding each saffron ﬁeld, while the Prediction\
    \ Unit employs the aforementioned data mining tools\nto produce a sufﬁcient evaluation\
    \ of the collected data. All system information is stored in the central\nserver\
    \ database.\nBased on the acquired and processed data, farmers can produce statistics\
    \ regarding the progress in\nsaffron production and avoid ﬁnancial loss, while\
    \ improving the quality of the crops and accomplishing\na considerable rise in\
    \ production.\nInformation 2019, 10, 348\n21 of 25\n8.3. Beneﬁts and Costs\nGreece\
    \ is the second largest saffron producing country, with an average output of 4\
    \ tons of p.a.\nduring the last four decades, most of which is directed in export\
    \ markets. The establishment of the\n‘Kozani Saffron Producers Cooperative’ marked\
    \ the beginning of a good decade for this product\nwith production reaching its\
    \ height record of more than 12 tons in 1982 [53]. Nevertheless, in the\nperiod\
    \ following Greece’s accession to the European Community, farmers began abandoning\
    \ saffron\ncultivation. This fact resulted in a signiﬁcant decrease in yield with\
    \ an average yield of 800 g per\nstremma (1 ha = 10 stremmas = 1000 m2 ). However,\
    \ this trend seems to be reversed since 2010 and\ncurrently yields vary around\
    \ 1 ton per stremma. Currently, Greek saffron price is about 1200 euros per\n\
    Kg. Nearly 5000 spots are needed to produce 100 g of red saffron. The average\
    \ produce per acre is 6 kg\nof dried stigmas (red product). The lower production\
    \ of the plant is on the ﬁrst year of the plantation,\nwhile the highest on the\
    \ third and the fourth.\nIn the year of 2015, a study in Greek saffron cultivation\
    \ resulted that farm managers need\nto address the efﬁciency of input use and\
    \ raise capital and labor productivities to maintain\ncompetitiveness [53]. The\
    \ saffron quality is determined by the color, ﬂavor and size of the stigmas.\n\
    The DIAS platform aims to upgrade proﬁt earnings by the adoption of new technologies,\
    \ ensuring\nﬂower picking at appropriate time in a proper collection material\
    \ at an appropriate age. Animal\nintrusions in the ﬁelds, causing a huge loss\
    \ in production, will be prevented and crops diseases will\nbe detected in time.\
    \ The overall equipment cost is considered to be a safe investment for farmers\n\
    since most of the technologies involved are open source and the initial cost of\
    \ the related hardware\nand software can be shared across producers. Currently,\
    \ the DIAS initiative is under construction\nand no experimental results are available\
    \ to conﬁrm the proposed objectives. However, in Table 6\nwe present the production\
    \ rate of Greek Saffron as recorded in [53], while in Table 7 an average\nestimation\
    \ is provided regarding the increase in cultivation operations by adopting the\
    \ DIAS platform.\nThese percentages are the estimations provided by two of the\
    \ producers whose ﬁelds participate in\nthe pilot study. The estimations show\
    \ that on average the farmers calculate an increase of around\n20% in production,\
    \ this percentage is in accordance to other types of cultivations such as olives\
    \ and\npotatoes [54].\nThe use of the DIAS project can offer a signiﬁcant increase\
    \ in saffron production. Nevertheless,\nsince no pilots have been implemented\
    \ yet in the project, the Return on Investment (ROI) is difﬁcult to be\nestimated.\
    \ An investment of time and money from the DIAS consortium is required to investigate\
    \ how\nthe data gathered from UAVs can connect to and affect other things that\
    \ are happening on the ﬁelds.\nSaffron growers need that information to provide\
    \ context and create a correlation regarding causes\nand effects. At that point\
    \ ROI becomes signiﬁcant promoting UAVs as a part of the desired solution\nand\
    \ not as the solution itself. Furthermore, due to shared costs between project\
    \ partners, ROI becomes\na collective performance measure that can be estimated\
    \ only when each member has acquired the\naccording technological beneﬁts. A complex\
    \ proﬁtability study is required to specify the precision\nservice offerings,\
    \ as presented in [55,56]. Each partner in the DIAS project owns and offers different\n\
    assets in this endeavor, thus calculating the overall ROI of UAV usage from the\
    \ side of farmers is not\nyet possible.\nTable 6. Greek saffron cultivation economic\

    \ system in precision agriculture faces\nseveral challenges. The greatest challenge\
    \ in the sensor layer is for sensor nodes to achieve efﬁcient and\ncontinuous\
    \ operation for a long time in a natural environment, while taking into account\
    \ the climate\nchange and wildlife interventions. The battery life of sensor nodes\
    \ is not considered satisfactory,\nand it is necessary to design and implement\
    \ energy-saving protocols with the highest possible\nsystem performance among\
    \ other precautions. In addition, depending on the type of application,\nthe supported\
    \ agricultural work and the implementation technologies, the problems that arise\
    \ can be\ndifferentiated. For instance, the use of sensors and controllers from\
    \ different manufacturers prevents\ncommunication between them and makes it more\
    \ difﬁcult to interconnect with other agricultural\ncomponents. Also, the sensor\
    \ inertia phenomenon was observed in a high-speed WSN due to non-steep\nchanges\
    \ in humidity and soil temperature.\nIn the network layer, the basic challenges\
    \ regarding the operation of a crop monitoring system\nwith WSN and IoT technologies\
    \ include the limited computational capabilities of sensor nodes.\nThe restricted\
    \ memory of the nodes disables them to handle large amounts of communication data\n\
    and cluster-based interconnection procedures. Due to this fact, long data queues\
    \ are created in each\nnode, leading to greater delay in transmissions. The same\
    \ outcome can be triggered by the long\ncommunication distance of sensor nodes.\
    \ One major issue that routing algorithms must deal with in\nsuch cases is the\
    \ high level of energy consumption, which leads to a reduction in the overall\
    \ viability\nof the network. In precision agriculture monitoring systems routing\
    \ protocols should offer minimum\ndelay, be able to provide efﬁcient services\
    \ in many sensor nodes, while taking into account the limited\nresources. They\
    \ should also be capable of accepting all sorts of environments including severe\
    \ and loss\nenvironments, while providing information security and privacy. Most\
    \ routing protocols use some\nlocalization technique to obtain knowledge concerning\
    \ their locations. The performance of the routing\nprotocol is a function of network\
    \ size and transmission media. Therefore, transmission media of good\nquality\
    \ enhances the network performance directly.\nHowever, in many cases the failure\
    \ of such advanced monitoring system may be due to the\ngeographic, cultural or\
    \ socio-economic distance between system designers and the intended user\ncommunity.\
    \ Cost is an important limiting factor in the implementation of such systems.\
    \ The cost\ndepends to a great extent on the quality of the materials and the\
    \ topology of the network.\n10. Conclusions\nThis paper proposes the architectural\
    \ components of a smart farming monitoring system, based on\nmodern IoT communication\
    \ technologies and WSN capabilities, in cooperation with energy-saving\nprotocol\
    \ schemes. A use case study based on the DIAS project is also presented, enhancing\
    \ the reliability\nand contribution of our model. The IoT agricultural applications\
    \ enable farmers to collect and analyze\nmeaningful data. Large landowners and\
    \ small farmers should welcome the potential of IoT market\nfor agriculture by\
    \ installing smart technologies to increase competitiveness and sustainability\
    \ in their\nproductions. The rapid growth of population forces farmers to meet\
    \ the demand by implementing\nagricultural IoT solutions in a prosperous manner.\
    \ In the future, an in-depth study will be carried out\nregarding the real-time\
    \ performance of the proposed model in the DIAS project.\nInformation 2019, 10,\

  limitations: 'One limitation of the proposed system is that it may require significant
    investment in infrastructure and resources to implement and maintain, especially
    for large-scale farming operations. The use of wireless communication technologies,
    sensors, and data processing tools can add to the overall cost of deployment.


    Another potential limitation is the scalability of the system to handle a large
    number of sensors and devices in a wide geographical area. The system''s performance
    and reliability may be affected by factors such as network coverage, signal strength,
    and interference, which can be challenging to manage in complex farming environments.


    Furthermore, the system''s reliance on data collection and analysis may raise
    concerns about data privacy and security. Farmers may be hesitant to share sensitive
    data about their crops and operations, and robust measures must be in place to
    protect data from unauthorized access and misuse.'

  relevance_evaluation: 'The proposed system is highly relevant to the specific point
    you are making in your review, which is the need for architectures and protocols
    for seamless integration of ML-generated insights with IoT-enabled irrigation
    control systems. The system''s focus on real-time data collection, processing,
    and automated control of irrigation systems aligns well with the requirements
    of precision agriculture and addresses the challenges of integrating ML-generated
    insights into practical applications.


    The system''s layered architecture provides a structured approach to addressing
    the various aspects of IoT-based irrigation control, including data collection,
    communication, processing, and application. It incorporates industry-standard
    protocols and technologies, ensuring interoperability and scalability. The use
    of MQTT-SN and CoAP for device communication, FIWARE NGSI for data harmonization,
    and Apache Hadoop for Big Data analytics demonstrates the system''s alignment
    with established IoT and data management practices.


    Moreover, the system''s focus on security and privacy is crucial for real-world
    deployments in agriculture. The use of encryption and access control mechanisms
    ensures the confidentiality and integrity of data, addressing the concerns of
    unauthorized access and data breaches.'

  explanation: 'The main contribution of the paper is to propose an IoT framework
    called Smart&Green that provides services for smart irrigation. Smart&Green automates
    irrigation management systems and enriches them by predicting soil moisture. The
    authors conduct a detailed analysis of the impact of outlier detection and removal
    techniques on real soil moisture data used in irrigation management, as well as
    the performance of machine learning models for soil moisture prediction with local
    and global approaches. They conclude that the use of real soil moisture data in
    water balance management saves an average of 90.4% of the irrigation water need,
    and that the use of predicted soil moisture data in water balance management saves
    an average of 56.4% of the irrigation water need. They also find that the global
    approach for soil moisture prediction outperforms the local approach, with an
    average MAE error increase of 58.9% and an RMSE error increase of 45.7% compared
    to the local approach.


    In this system, Gradient Boosting is the best machine learning technique for predicting
    soil moisture. Among the methods tested, it achieved the lowest MAE and RMSE for
    both local and global approaches. Random Forest was the second-best performing
    algorithm, followed by RepTree. The most relevant features for both approaches
    were U2, P, Tmax, RHmin, Rn, and kc.'

    \ data in the monitoring ﬁeld. A smart agriculture system gathers data from several\
    \ sources;\nhowever, the data are not guaranteed to be free of discrepant values\
    \ (i.e., outliers), which can\ndamage the precision of irrigation management.\
    \ Furthermore, data from different sources must ﬁt\ninto the same temporal window\
    \ required for irrigation management and the data preprocessing\nmust be dynamic\
    \ and automatic to beneﬁt users of the irrigation management plan.\nIn this\n\
    paper, we propose the Smart&Green framework to offer services for smart irrigation,\
    \ such as data\nmonitoring, preprocessing, fusion, synchronization, storage, and\
    \ irrigation management enriched\nby the prediction of soil moisture. Outlier\
    \ removal techniques allow for more precise irrigation\nmanagement. For ﬁelds\
    \ without soil moisture sensors, the prediction model estimates the matric\npotential\
    \ using weather, crop, and irrigation information. We apply the predicted matric\
    \ potential\napproach to the Van Genutchen model to determine the moisture used\
    \ in an irrigation management\nscheme. We can save, on average, between 56.4%\
    \ and 90% of the irrigation water needed by applying\nthe Zscore, MZscore and\
    \ Chauvenet outlier removal techniques to the predicted data.\nKeywords: IoT;\
    \ smart agriculture; soil moisture prediction\n1. Introduction\nAgricultural activities\
    \ presently use 70% of the withdrawn freshwater in the world [1]. Therefore,\n\
    it is of fundamental importance that we apply irrigation management, especially\
    \ in semiarid regions\nwith a scarcity of rainfall. Irrigation management is a\
    \ part of precision agriculture, in which the correct\namount of water artiﬁcially\
    \ delivered to a ﬁeld to satisfy the crop needs and the real production of the\n\
    users is analyzed [2].\nThe irrigation must supply the crop water needs at different\
    \ developmental stages in a given\nlocal. Irrigation management is used to detect\
    \ when to irrigate, the amount of water needed, and the\nirrigation frequency,\
    \ based on the monitoring of crop evapotranspiration and soil moisture conditions.\n\
    Crop evapotranspiration measures the water consumption by crops, according to\
    \ the developmental\nSensors 2020, 20, 190; doi:10.3390/s20010190\nwww.mdpi.com/journal/sensors\n\
    Sensors 2020, 20, 190\n2 of 25\nstage of the crop and the weather conditions [3].\
    \ The soil moisture impacts the amount of irrigation\nwater given to the crop,\
    \ as irrigation management takes into account the level of water retention in\
    \ the\nsoil. Therefore, precision agriculture can reduce water consumption in\
    \ irrigation by considering the\ngroundwater available to the crop [2].\nThe choice\
    \ of the best irrigation management plan depends on the data available from the\n\
    monitoring ﬁeld. A smart agriculture system gathers and processes data for irrigation\
    \ management\nfrom several sources using computer science and information technology\
    \ [4]. Users can provide\nthe features of different types of crop, soil, and irrigation\
    \ system, as well as the readings of analog\ntensiometers. Tensiometers are soil\
    \ sensors that detect the matric potential, which are used to estimate\nthe moisture\
    \ at different depths and monitoring points in a ﬁeld. Automatic weather stations\
    \ [5] can\nprovide public data through the Internet. Moreover, the ﬁeld may have\
    \ sensors and actuators which\ncan interact with each other as objects of the\
    \ Internet of Things (IoT) in order to provide services\ntransparently to the\
    \ users [6]. Such services are related to irrigation management for monitoring\n\
    (i.e., water, soil, and air) and prediction (weather and soil conditions).\nHowever,\
    \ data are not free of discrepant values (i.e., outliers), which can negatively\
    \ affect the\nprecision of irrigation management. Furthermore, data from different\
    \ sources must ﬁt into the\nsame temporal window required for the irrigation management\
    \ and the data preprocessing must be\ndynamic and automatic for researchers, engineers,\
    \ and owners or farmers to beneﬁt from the irrigation\nmanagement plan. Data fusion\
    \ is required to improve the quality of soil data in the case where several\n\
    sources provide the same type of data (e.g., moisture) from the ﬁeld [7]. Data\
    \ fusion also informs the\ndecision whether to start irrigation or not in irrigation\
    \ management that makes use of other types of\ndata (such as weather or crop data).\n\
    In this paper, we propose the Smart&Green framework to offer services for smart\
    \ irrigation,\nsuch as data monitoring and control, preprocessing, fusion, synchronization,\
    \ storage, and irrigation\nmanagement enriched by the prediction of soil moisture.\
    \ The Smart&Green services are modular\ncomponents which facilitate the reuse\
    \ and customization of code, which are challenges/limitations to\napplying IoT\
    \ in the smart agriculture context [8]. Our framework allows users to set the\
    \ data sources:\nThe nearest weather station, the moisture sensors (analog or\
    \ digital), the type of crop, and the features\nof the irrigation system in the\
    \ monitored ﬁeld. Therefore, Smart&Green also contributes to the solution\nof\
    \ another challenge in applying IoT for the purpose of smart agriculture: The\
    \ integration of the actual\ninfrastructure of the users (i.e., devices, machines,\
    \ and software) [9].\nSmart&Green recommends the best irrigation management plan,\
    \ according to the conﬁguration\nof the monitored ﬁeld. The framework also synchronizes\
    \ weather and soil data, as well as the crop\nstage for the chosen irrigation\
    \ management plan. The Fusion service allows for the deﬁnition of outlier\nremoval\
    \ criteria for the weather and soil data. The fusion service also applies the\
    \ outlier removal\ntechniques Chauvenet, Z-Score, Modiﬁed Z-Score, and Generalized\
    \ ESD before data aggregation,\nin order to obtain general information about the\
    \ soil conditions of a ﬁeld. Our results show that it\nmakes irrigation management\
    \ more precise, therefore saving water.\nFor ﬁelds without soil moisture sensors,\
    \ the prediction module estimates the soil moisture to\nmake the amount of water\
    \ irrigated more precise. In this work, we propose a computational model to\n\
    predict the matric potential based on weather data available at public stations\
    \ [5], crop information,\nand the amount of irrigation water used. As another\
    \ contribution, we provide to the scientiﬁc\ncommunity a public data set containing\
    \ the matric potential and irrigation data for cashew cultivation\nin an experimental\
    \ ﬁeld. The matric potential is the critical variable in measuring the soil moisture.\n\
    The computational model reduces the cost of equipment and energy, as the model\
    \ allows farms\nto estimate the moisture without soil sensors for the same soil\
    \ type. We evaluate the performance\nof a set of popular machine learning techniques\
    \ which have been widely applied to solve regression\nproblems. We measure the\
    \ quality of the models without feature selection using the RMSE (Root Mean\n\
    Squared Error) and the MAE (Mean Absolute Error) as metrics. Our results show\
    \ that the combination\nSensors 2020, 20, 190\n3 of 25\nof predicted data and\
    \ the outlier removal techniques can save an average between 56.4% and 90% of\n\
    irrigation water, estimated by water balance management.\nThe rest of the paper\
    \ is structured as follows: In Section 2, a literary review of IoT platforms for\n\
    Smart Agriculture is presented. Section 3 describes the structure and services\
    \ of the Smart&Green\nframework. Section 4 relates the materials and method of\
    \ the implementation of Smart&Green,\nespecially for the soil moisture prediction\
    \ evaluation. The results are given in Section 5, and we\ndiscuss our contributions\
    \ in Section 6. Appendix A gives details about irrigation management using\nSmart&Green,\
    \ and we formalize the problem of soil moisture prediction in Appendix B.\n2.\
    \ Related Work\nWe carried out a systematic literature review to ﬁnd the works\
    \ which have answered the following\nresearch questions:\n1.\nWhat software exists\
    \ for agricultural management that automates the process of gathering,\npreprocessing,\
    \ fusing, and synchronizing the data used in irrigation management?\n2.\nDoes\
    \ the software implement the well-known irrigation management approaches of matric\n\
    potential (Equation (A2)) and water balance (Equation (A3))?\n3.\nDoes the software\
    \ forecast the soil moisture?\n4.\nCan users conﬁgure the software using information\
    \ about their crops, irrigation system, soil\nsensors, and weather stations close\
    \ to the monitored ﬁeld?\nMost of the discovered papers have partially answered\
    \ the research questions above. To our best\nknowledge, there have been almost\
    \ no Internet of Things (IoT) platforms introduced that provide the\nservices\
    \ required for smart irrigation, such as the gathering, preprocessing, synchronization,\
    \ and fusion\nof data; the planning and execution of irrigation management; or\
    \ soil moisture prediction.\nSeveral studies have only addressed the gathering\
    \ and visualization of weather and soil data\n(Section 2.1). Some works focused\
    \ on data preprocessing by applying outlier detection algorithms\n(Section 2.2).\
    \ Some approaches used speciﬁc methods to decide when to irrigate, whereas others\
    \ have\nimplemented water balance and matric potential (Section 2.3). Soil moisture\
    \ prediction using machine\nlearning techniques applied to crop data, satellite\
    \ images, and irrigation management information\nhas been investigated (Section\
    \ 2.4). In addition, IoT platforms have been studied, which should be\nﬂexible\
    \ enough to allow users to conﬁgure them for different monitoring cases in smart\
    \ agriculture\n(Section 2.5).\n2.1. Data Gathering\nIn general, most of the sensor\
    \ nodes used to monitor soil data (such as temperature, humidity,\nand matric\
    \ potential) and weather data (such as temperature and relative humidity) are\
    \ operated\nusing open, low-cost hardware platforms such as the Arduino [10–14]\
    \ or Raspberry Pi [15–17].\nZigbee [11,17–19], LoRa [16], Wiﬁ [20], Bluetooth\
    \ [14], GSM [12], and GPRS [21] are the predominant\nwireless technologies used.\n\
    Our proposal allows users choose between the CoAP [22] and MQTT [23] protocols\
    \ for sending\ndata to Smart&Green framework storage and later irrigation management.\
    \ For devices that we can not\nturn into a sensor node, such as analog tensiometers,\
    \ our framework has a mobile application with\nwhich users can gather data manually.\
    \ The framework also allows users to choose, as a weather data\nsource, the Brazilian\
    \ automatic weather station nearest to the monitored ﬁeld, from which data can\
    \ be\ngathered via HTTP.\n2.2. Data Preprocessing\nOther approaches have processed\
    \ soil data to detect outliers [24,25] and treat data using noise\nﬁltering techniques\
    \ [26]. One system applied an EKF (Extended Kalman Filter) to the soil moisture\n\
    Sensors 2020, 20, 190\n4 of 25\ndata before the execution of irrigation management,\
    \ in order to avoid the actuators inappropriately\nstarting the irrigation [27].\n\
    The pattern recognition of water consumption by a crop radicular system, presented\
    \ in [28],\nis an outlier detection technique based on a time-series analysis\
    \ of soil moisture gathered at several\ndepths before, during, and after irrigation.\
    \ This technique allows for the identiﬁcation of sensors with\npoor operation,\
    \ which indicates the need for calibration or change.\nOur proposed framework\
    \ allows users to deﬁne criteria for outlier removal for each type of\nweather\
    \ and soil data used in irrigation management. Our framework also gives the option\
    \ to execute\nsuch algorithms as Chauvenet, Z-Score, Modiﬁed Z-Score, and Generalized\
    \ ESD (Extreme Studentized\nDeviation) to remove outliers and fuse soil moisture\
    \ data, in the case when a ﬁeld has several soil\nsensors monitoring at different\
    \ depths.\n2.3. Irrigation Management\nOther works have automatically started\
    \ irrigation by implementing algorithms for analyzing the\ndata gathered by a\
    \ wireless sensor node. In one study, an algorithm based on decision trees used\
    \ the\nsoil temperature and moisture to determine the irrigation time and the\
    \ needed amount of water [29].\nCrisp rules (IF-THEN) were used to compare threshold\
    \ values with the soil moisture gathered by\nsensors, in order to decide whether\
    \ to turn on the sprinklers of an irrigation system, in [30,31].\nDecision support\
    \ platforms for the execution of traditional irrigation management, such as\n\
    the matric potential (Equation (A2)) and water balance (Equation (A3)), have been\
    \ introduced.\nThese systems allow agronomists and farm owners to manage Internet\
    \ of Things (IoT) components\nfor ﬁeld monitoring. The matric potential management\
    \ uses soil data gathered by sensor nodes and\nimages captured by unmanned aerial\
    \ vehicles to correctly estimate the irrigation water need [32].\nWeb systems\
    \ have been used for the planning and execution of irrigation management. Beyond\
    \ the\nvisualization of soil moisture and weather data gathered by wireless sensor\
    \ nodes, these systems\nuse crisp rules for data analysis and, when it is necessary,\
    \ the systems send messages to their users\nin order to notify about irrigation\
    \ times [33] or activate the irrigation system automatically [34,35].\nIn other\
    \ approaches, the system takes the rainfall forecast (available on the Internet)\
    \ into account when\ndeciding whether to activate the irrigation system [36].\
    \ A wireless sensor network can also plan and\nexecute irrigation management [37].\
    \ In this case, the sensor nodes gather and analyze soil moisture\ndata and turn\
    \ the irrigation system on until the moisture achieves the ﬁeld capacity.\nA SCADA\
    \ (Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition) system can automatically carry out\
    \ the data\ngathering, planning, and execution of the water balance management\
    \ (see Equations (A3) and (A4)).\nThe soil sensor nodes are also actuators, which\
    \ control the irrigation and send data continually to\na management system. The\
    \ system receives data from a weather station on the farm to estimate the\nreference\
    \ evapotranspiration ETo. The system also utilizes the curve of the crop coefﬁcient\
    \ kc, choosing\nits value according to the current developmental stage of the\
    \ crop [38].\nThe water balance and matric potential approaches often must take\
    \ data synchronization into\naccount. Therefore, some applications have synchronized\
    \ the data of previously registered crops,\nas well as soil and weather data,\
    \ to precisely determine the irrigation water need for the current\ndevelopmental\
    \ stage of the crop [39–42].\nThe existing systems described in this section are\
    \ not ﬂexible enough to allow users to set the\nfeatures of a monitored ﬁeld,\
    \ such as the type of crop, the type and number of soil sensors, and irrigation\n\
    system parameters used. The systems usually work with a predeﬁned conﬁguration\
    \ and infrastructure.\nTherefore, code reuse is impracticable for the irrigation\
    \ management of agricultural ﬁelds which do not\nﬁt to the existing system conﬁguration.\
    \ Our proposal allows users to register relevant information for\nirrigation management:\
    \ Different types of crops, soil features, irrigation systems, data sources (weather\n\
    or soil), and outlier removal criteria. In this work, the framework plans the\
    \ irrigation management\nusing the matric potential (Equation (A2)) and water\
    \ balance (Equation (A3)) approaches.\nSensors 2020, 20, 190\n5 of 25\nFurthermore,\
    \ none of the systems could forecast the moisture levels in ﬁelds without soil\
    \ sensors.\nOur proposal implements computational models to predict soil moisture\
    \ based on weather data, crop\ninformation, and irrigation water need (IWN) (see\
    \ Appendix B). In this work, we include the predicted\ndata in the water balance\
    \ management, obtaining between 56.4% and 90% of IWN savings over six\nmonths\
    \ (Section 5.3).\n2.4. Soil Moisture Prediction\nIn [43], the Linear Regression,\
    \ Decision Tree, Random Forest, and Gradient Boosting with\nRegression Tree (GBRT)\
    \ machine learning (ML) techniques were applied to weather and soil sensor\ndata\
    \ (moisture and drought stress) to predict the best irrigation plan for a jojoba\
    \ crop. The GBRT\nmodel outperformed the others and, so, the decision support\
    \ service incorporated it as a module of\nthe system. A model based on support\
    \ vector regression (SVR) and k-means ML techniques which\nused weather data and\
    \ forecasts, as well the soil data (temperature and moisture), to forecast the\
    \ soil\nmoisture has also been investigated [44].\nIn [45], an integrated system\
    \ to monitor drought in northern China using satellite images (NOAA,\nMODIS, and\
    \ FY3A), weather stations, and soil data has been discussed. The drought forecasting\n\
    used the matric potential at the depth of the crop root, the water balance model,\
    \ depletion indices,\nand measurements of crop stress to estimate the soil moisture\
    \ and the water quantity needed for\nan extended period.\nIn this work, we apply\
    \ weather data, crop information, and the amount of irrigation water used\nin\
    \ a computational model, in order to estimate the daily matric potential of the\
    \ most superﬁcial soil\nlayer (Appendix B), which signals when the crop needs\
    \ irrigation [2]. We apply the predicted value in\nthe Van Genutchen model (Equation\
    \ (A1)) to obtain the soil moisture used in irrigation management\n(Equations\
    \ (A2) and (A3)) for ﬁelds without soil moisture sensors (i.e., Field 1 of Figure\
    \ A1).\nWe present two different approaches: Local and global prediction models.\
    \ In the local method,\nwe create a prediction model for each monitoring point\
    \ in an experimental ﬁeld (Section 4.2). In the\nglobal approach, we create a\
    \ single model which can be generalized to any monitoring point. We have\nevaluated\
    \ the performance of a set of popular ML techniques which have been widely applied\n\
    to solve regression problems: Linear Regression [46], Decision Stump [47], M5\
    \ Model Trees and\nRules [48,49], Random Tree, Random Forest [50], RepTree, and\
    \ GBRT [51,52]. Our results show that\nGBRT outperforms the other evaluated techniques\
    \ in both approaches.\n2.5. IoT Platforms for Smart Agriculture\nSWAMP (Smart\
    \ Water Management Platform), introduced in [53], is one of the related methods\n\
    which is most similar to our proposal. SWAMP has components to allow for the implementation\
    \ of\ndifferent IoT applications for irrigation management, based on the crop\
    \ and soil moisture approaches.\nUsers can customize the services for the gathering\
    \ (MQTT or LoRa), processing, and synchronization\nof data with different types\
    \ of crops, weather, and country. Therefore, different ﬁeld conﬁgurations\ncan\
    \ reuse these services for data analysis and storage, highlighting the excellent\
    \ ﬂexibility of SWAMP.\nHowever, their techniques for the processing and the fusion\
    \ of data have not been detailed, and no\napplication or service for the prediction\
    \ of soil moisture has been provided.\nThe Agro-IoT framework, introduced in [54],\
    \ is also related to our proposal, which provides\nusers real-time data gathering,\
    \ aggregation (fusion), and analysis in the context of smart farming.\nAgro-IoT\
    \ reuses several components to implement IoT applications, according to the needs\
    \ of the\nmonitored ﬁeld. Agro-IoT provides similar services to our proposed method;\
    \ that is, it also provides\nthe management of devices (i.e., registration of\
    \ sensors and actuators) and event detection through\ndata analysis. However,\
    \ it does not contain modules for data synchronization and outlier removal or\n\
    soil moisture prediction.\nSensors 2020, 20, 190\n6 of 25\n3. Proposal\nIn this\
    \ paper, we propose Smart&Green: An Internet of Things (IoT) framework for the\
    \ smart\nagriculture domain. A framework consists of “a speciﬁc implementation\
    \ of a skeleton of infrastructure used\nfor the conception of a work” [55]. Work\
    \ is any activity performed by users or software. In this proposal,\nthe work\
    \ consists of the planning of irrigation management (Appendix A). In ﬁelds where\
    \ there are\nno soil moisture sensors, a computational model can estimate the\
    \ soil moisture for the same soil type\nusing weather, crop, and irrigation data.\
    \ Agronomists, researchers, and farmers conduct irrigation\nmanagement through\
    \ software which uses Smart&Green. Figure 1 presents the conceptual architecture\n\
    of Smart&Green, divided into four layers: Application, Services, Communication,\
    \ and Physical.\nFigure 1. Conceptual architecture of the Smart&Green IoT Framework\
    \ for Smart Agriculture.\nIn software engineering, a framework can also be “a\
    \ mini architecture that can be reused and that\nprovides behavior and a generic\
    \ structure for a family of software abstractions in a context that speciﬁes the\n\
    collaboration and use of them into a given domain” [56]. Therefore, given the\
    \ smart agriculture domain and\nthe context of smart irrigation, the Smart&Green\
    \ framework speciﬁes the structure of a set of concrete\nand abstract classes\
    \ to implement modules for the gathering, storage, synchronization, and fusion\
    \ of\ndata, as well as mathematical models (Appendix A) which describe irrigation\
    \ management. Irrigation\nmanagement determines the behaviors of the classes and\
    \ modules. As a mini architecture, the proposed\nframework can be reused with\
    \ different smart agriculture software with the generic functionalities of\nirrigation\
    \ management.\n3.1. Application Layer\nThe application layer provides facilities\
    \ for the automatization of irrigation management\n(Appendix A) and soil moisture\
    \ prediction. Through this layer, users of an agriculture management\nsystem can\
    \ insert information about the farm infrastructure: The types of crops and irrigation\
    \ system\nto each monitored ﬁeld, the monitored soil layers, and the weather stations\
    \ closest to the farm.\nSensors 2020, 20, 190\n7 of 25\n3.1.1. Irrigation Management\
    \ Automatization\nThe Matric Potential and Water Balance modules implement well-known\
    \ irrigation management\nmethods (Appendix A). These modules use information registered\
    \ by users as well as that from\nweather and soil data sources. Smart&Green selects\
    \ the best irrigation management based on the data\navailable. The principal functions\
    \ of the Register Module are as follows:\n1.\nUser register: Smart&Green framework\
    \ allows two types of users: Specialist and regular. Specialist\nusers can provide\
    \ agronomic information, such as different types of crops, soil, and irrigation\n\
    system features. They can also register outlier removal criteria for weather and\
    \ soil data and\nchoose algorithms for the fusion service. Regular users can register\
    \ farms and ﬁelds.\n2.\nFarm Register: Users provide information about the farm,\
    \ such as address and geographical\nco-ordinates (i.e., latitude and altitude)\
    \ for the Smart&Green framework, and select the weather\nstation closest to the\
    \ farm.\n3.\nCrop register: A specialist user can create types of crops using\
    \ information such as a description,\nthe curve of the crop coefﬁcient, and the\
    \ critical moisture condition.\n4.\nSystem Irrigation Register: A specialist user\
    \ inserts the type of irrigation systems, such as\n“micro-sprinkler”.\n5.\nWeather\
    \ Station Register: Smart&Green automatically selects the weather station closest\
    \ to the farm\nusing the geographical co-ordinates. Users can conﬁrm this or choose\
    \ another one.\n6.\nSoil Sensor Register: The user can insert the types of soil\
    \ sensors used. Smart&Green already has\nanalog and digital tensiometers.\n7.\n\
    Field Register: Users set the ﬁeld conﬁguration features (Figure A1), such as\
    \ the type of crop,\nirrigation system, soil, and if there are soil monitoring\
    \ points. The developmental stage of the crop\nrepresents the number of days since\
    \ the initial cultivation. Effective precipitation (mm/h) and\nefﬁciency of the\
    \ irrigation system are necessary for irrigation management, in order to compute\n\
    the irrigation time. In the case of monitoring points, users can register the\
    \ type of soil moisture\nsensor (analog or digital) and the depth z monitored\
    \ for each monitoring point in the ﬁeld.\n8.\nField Communication register: In\
    \ the case where the monitored ﬁelds have sensor nodes that\nautomatically gather\
    \ soil data, users can deﬁne the type of communication to send the data to the\n\
    framework. Users set the IP address and speciﬁc conﬁguration (CoAP or MQTT).\n\
    9.\nOutlier Removal Criteria Register: Specialist users can create a threshold\
    \ for minimum and\nmaximum values of each type of weather and soil moisture data\
    \ used in irrigation management.\nThe Smart&Green framework suggests an irrigation\
    \ management plan, according to the data of\na registered ﬁeld. For ﬁelds without\
    \ soil moisture sensors (Field 1 of Figure A1), Smart&Green indicates\nthe water\
    \ balance without soil moisture data (i.e., without the term ∆A in Equation (A3))\
    \ or the water\nbalance with the soil moisture data created by the soil moisture\
    \ prediction module (Section 3.1.2).\nFor ﬁelds with soil moisture sensors (see\
    \ Fields 2 and 3 of Figure A1), the framework calculates the\nmatric potential\
    \ (Equation (A2)) or water balance using the soil moisture data.\n3.1.2. Soil\
    \ Moisture Prediction\nIn this work, we address a large ﬁeld (over 7500 m2) to\
    \ produce one type of crop on a large scale,\nin which the soil is monitored by\
    \ a hundred tensiometers (i.e., soil moisture sensors) at three different\ndepths.\
    \ To investigate this scenario, we present the local and global approaches, which\
    \ can be used to\nlearn a prediction function ˆf (Appendix B).\nThe local approach\
    \ creates a different prediction function ˆfi for each tensiometer at the superﬁcial\n\
    soil layer of the ﬁeld. For this, it uses the observations recorded by a tensiometer\
    \ bi and a weather\nstation ms, as well the water amount wi given to the crop\
    \ and the crop coefﬁcient kc related to the\ncurrent life stage of the crop. The\
    \ local approach deﬁnes the prediction ˆf in terms of n different\nSensors 2020,\
    \ 20, 190\n8 of 25\nfunctions ˆfi for local predictions. However, if a ﬁeld has\
    \ a large number of tensiometers, a large\nnumber of distinctive prediction models\
    \ must be trained.\nThe global approach creates only one prediction function ˆfi\
    \ using the information from all\ntensiometers. Therefore, the global prediction\
    \ model might not ﬁt some individual tensiometers.\nThe Smart&Green framework\
    \ implements the prediction model as a modular service (Figure 2)\nto complement\
    \ the irrigation management of ﬁelds without soil moisture sensors (e.g., ﬁeld\
    \ 1 in\nFigure A1). The framework automatically retrieves and stores the meteorological\
    \ data set Mms\npublished on the Internet by weather stations. We deﬁned Mms in\
    \ Appendix B.\nFigure 2. Smart&Green Module for soil moisture prediction.\nThe\
    \ framework daily preprocesses the Mms data to remove possible outliers. The module\
    \ of soil\nmoisture prediction estimates the matric potential ψp of a ﬁeld, based\
    \ on (M′\nms, W, kc) (Appendix B).\nThe irrigation management module computes\
    \ the current soil moisture θc by applying ψp on the Van\nGenutchen [57] model,\
    \ following Equation (A1). Then, the obtained θc is applied to Equation (A2)\n\
    or (A3) to calculate the irrigation water need (IWN).\nIn the Internet of Things\
    \ (IoT) context, the framework sends the IWN value to an actuator to\nstart the\
    \ irrigation system. The irrigation system stops when the ﬁeld receives the amount\
    \ of water\nspeciﬁed by the IWN. Although this present work does not handle an\
    \ automatic irrigation system,\nthis issue is a concern for the full implementation\
    \ of an IoT system for smart farms.\n3.2. Service Layer\nThe Service layer supports\
    \ the Application layer by storing data provided by Smart&Green users\nand synchronizing\
    \ crop, weather station, and soil data when required by any irrigation management\n\
    module. The Service layer also carries out fusion tasks for data of soil moisture\
    \ sensors (e.g., ﬁelds 2\nand 3 of Figure A1) or the soil moisture prediction.\n\
    The Storage service provides centralized data persistence for the monitoring of\
    \ weather, crop,\nand soil data in the ﬁelds. The Synchronization service selects\
    \ the crop coefﬁcient kc which is\nappropriate to the current development stage\
    \ of the crop and retrieves the weather data Mms for\nthe period needed for irrigation\
    \ management. The service also requests the Communication layer for\nnew data\
    \ from the Internet, if needed.\nIn the case of soil data, the Synchronization\
    \ service selects data from all monitoring points\nBTc in the ﬁeld, taking into\
    \ account the period of irrigation management. If there are no data\navailable,\
    \ the service requests new data from the user (ﬁeld 2 of Figure A1) or the Communication\n\
    Sensors 2020, 20, 190\n9 of 25\nlayer (Field 3 of Figure A1). Finally, the Synchronization\
    \ service makes the data set composed of\n{kc,current, Mms,period, BTc,period}\
    \ available.\nThe Irrigation Management Modules use the Fusion service if there\
    \ is a ﬁeld with monitoring\npoints, each with one or more soil moisture sensors\
    \ (e.g., tensiometers) at different depths z (e.g.,\nﬁelds 2 and 3 of Figure A1).\
    \ The Fusion service can also treat data created in soil moisture prediction\n\
    when irrigation management is required for ﬁelds without soil moisture sensors.\
    \ Data fusion consists\nof processing the data to detect and remove outliers (DRO)\
    \ and submitting data to a co-operative\nfunction (CF), according to a multilevel\
    \ data fusion architecture [58].\nDRO tasks apply criteria and algorithms deﬁned\
    \ by specialist users to immediately detect and\nremove outliers. The Register\
    \ module of the Application layer allows for the creation of threshold\nvalues\
    \ for soil data. DRO algorithms are speciﬁc to the soil layer monitored. According\
    \ to [58],\nthe Z-score is more efﬁcient for data series at the most superﬁcial\
    \ soil layer (e.g., z = 15 cm). In contrast,\nthe Generalized ESD (Extreme Studentized\
    \ Deviate) algorithm works well with data at depth of\nz = 45 cm. The Smart&Green\
    \ framework has implementations of the Chauvenet, Z-Score, Modiﬁed\nZ-Score, and\
    \ Generalized ESD algorithms.\nA co-operative function (CF) [59] aggregates one\
    \ type of data gathered at different monitoring\npoints of a ﬁeld. Smart&Green\
    \ uses the mean function as the CF to aggregate soil moisture data at the\nsame\
    \ depth. For example, Field 2 of Figure A1 has six monitoring points at two depths.\
    \ Therefore,\nthe framework calculates the mean of each set of six samples gathered\
    \ at a given depth z. After fusion,\nthe data are ready for irrigation management\
    \ at the Application layer, which decides whether irrigation\nshould be started.\n\
    3.3. Communication Layer\nThe Communication Layer has a set of software to gather\
    \ weather and soil data through network\nprotocols. This includes a weather client,\
    \ four soil clients, three soil servers, and a gateway (see\nFigure 3). The weather\
    \ client consists of an HTTP client which downloads weather station data from\n\
    the Internet and stores them. Smart&Green offers an API to gather data from Brazilian\
    \ automatic\nweather stations [5].\nFigure 3. Interaction between the Communication\
    \ Layer and the Physical and Services Layers.\nSensors 2020, 20, 190\n10 of 25\n\
    The soil client gathers the matric potential data ψm if the ﬁeld has tensiometers\
    \ installed. If the\ntensiometers are analog, users have to manually collect the\
    \ ψm data, using a mobile application that\nsends it to the framework via HTTP.\
    \ If the tensiometers are digital, they are integrated into sensor\nnodes that\
    \ send the data to a gateway near the ﬁeld. The gateway hosts CoAP and MQTT clients,\n\
    which forward the ψm data to the servers of the framework.\n4. Materials and Method\n\
    In this section, we list the principal software components used in the implementation\
    \ of our\nproposed framework (Section 4.1). We describe what we use for soil moisture\
    \ prediction, in terms of\n(1) the weather, crop, and soil moisture information;\
    \ (2) the criteria for outlier detection and removal;\nand (3) the tested machine\
    \ learning techniques (see Section 4.2).\n4.1. Smart & Green Framework Implementation\n\
    We implemented the Smart&Green framework using the Python 3 Language. In the Application\n\
    layer (Section 3.1), irrigation management by the water balance module uses PyETo\
    \ [60] to calculate the\nreference evapotranspiration for a crop, with reference\
    \ to the Penman-Monteith Model [61]. The crop\nevapotranspiration measures the\
    \ water consumption by crops, according to the developmental stage\nof the crop\
    \ and weather conditions [3]. The Service Layer uses the MySQL database [62] to\
    \ support the\nStorage service. The PyAstronomy library [63] provides the implementation\
    \ of the Generalized ESD\n(Extreme Studentized Deviate) algorithm for the Fusion\
    \ Service.\nThe aiocoap package [64] supports the implementation of the CoAP client\
    \ and server of the\nCommunication layer (Section 3.3). The MQTT client uses the\
    \ Eclipse Paho MQTT client library [65],\nand we used Mosquito as the MQTT server\
    \ [66]. Our API for the acquisition of weather data operates\nby scraping the\
    \ web page of the automatic Brazilian weather stations [5] using the libraries\
    \ requests [67]\nand beautifulsoup4 [68], as well the frameworks Django [69] and\
    \ Django rest [70]. We implemented\nthe mobile application for soil moisture gathering\
    \ from ﬁelds with analog tensiometers (e.g., ﬁeld 2 of\nFigure A1) in the Javascript\
    \ language through the Firebase platform [71], React Native framework [72],\n\
    Realm [73], and React Native Firebase [74] libraries.\nWe also provide a web interface\
    \ for the\nSmart&Green Framework developed using Django [69]. Smart&Green was\
    \ run on a machine with\n2 GB of RAM, 20 GB of hard disk storage, and the Ubuntu\
    \ 18.04LTS OS.\nFor farm ﬁelds with sensor nodes, such as ﬁeld 3 of Figure A1,\
    \ we used an Arduino Pro Mini and\nthree Irrometer Watermark 200SS [75] digital\
    \ tensiometers to implement a sensor node which gathers\nsoil moisture data at\
    \ 15, 45, and 75 cm. The watermark measures the soil water tension (i.e., matric\n\
    potential), which ranges from 0 to 200 CBar/KPa. The sensor nodes use four AA\
    \ alkaline batteries of\n1.5 v as the power source. We modify the Arduino removing\
    \ the voltage controller and LEDs to the\nnode has a longer operating life. Sensor\
    \ nodes send soil data through an nRF24L01 with an external\nanthem and power\
    \ ampliﬁer. The nRF24L01 is a single-chip radio transceiver for the 2.4–2.5 GHz\
    \ ISM\nband. After data transmission, the sensor node hibernates for an hour to\
    \ save power [58]. We used\na Raspberry Pi 3 with the Raspbian OS as the gateway\
    \ to receive soil moisture data and send them by\nthe CoAP or MQTT client to storage.\n\
    4.2. Soil Moisture Prediction\n4.2.1. Raw Data Set\nWe obtained a data set of\
    \ soil moisture from an experimental cashew ﬁeld with other tropical\nraw materials\
    \ in the city of Paraibapa, Brazil [76]. The ﬁeld had approximately 250 cashew\
    \ trees with\nnine monitoring spots. Each spot had three tensiometers that allowed\
    \ manual reading of the matric\npotential at depths of 15, 45, and 75 cm. Figure\
    \ 4 shows the details of the analog tensiometers (soil\nmoisture sensors), which\
    \ provided the data set from 2016, 2017, and 2018, with 234, 245, and 138 daily\n\
    samples, respectively. It is worth mentioning that, in 2016, the ﬁeld had salvation\
    \ irrigation in which\nSensors 2020, 20, 190\n11 of 25\nwe gave 5 liters of water\
    \ for each bud whenever the installed tensiometer at a depth of 15 cm read\na\
    \ matric potential of 60 kPa. Salvation irrigation prevents plants from dying.\n\
    (a) Tensiometers at 15, 45, and 75 cm depths near a\ncashew bud.\n(b) Cashew buds.\n\
    Figure 4. Details of the Experimental Field.\nThe meteorological data set was\
    \ obtained from a Brazilian national weather station at Itapipoca\ncity, Ceara\
    \ (altitude 102 m; latitude 03◦29′ S; longitude 39◦35′ W). However, we decide\
    \ to use the\npluviometer sensor data of the ﬁeld, as the rainfall sensor of the\
    \ weather station had missing values\nover an extended period. Table 1 presents\
    \ the acronyms, the description of the variables, and the\nmeasurement data units\
    \ used in our prediction problem. We release the aggregated data set to the\n\
    scientiﬁc community to ensure the reproducibility of our results and promote research\
    \ developments\nin this ﬁeld (see Supplementary Materials).\nTable 1. Raw dataset\

    We also analyzed the soil particle composition of the experimental ﬁeld. The soil\
    \ has a medium\nsandy texture in the layer from 0 to 30 cm (805 g kg−1 of sand,\
    \ 76 g kg−1 of clay and 119 g kg−1 of silt)\nand the medium texture in the other\
    \ layers, presenting the characteristics of a red-yellow Argisol [77].\nThe maximum\
    \ organic matter content was 6.4 g dm−3; the pH varied from 5.6 to 6.3 between\
    \ the\nlayers; the capacity of cations exchange, from 31.3 to 64.8, and the sum\
    \ of maximum bases was 62% in\nthe most superﬁcial layer.\n4.2.2. Outlier Detection\
    \ and Removal\nFirst, the instances that presented Tmax, Tmin < 20, Tmax, Tmin\
    \ > 39, RHmax, RHmin < 20, and Ri >\n250 were removed, as these feature ranges\
    \ are uncommon in the city of Paraibapa. After that, the mean\nµ and the standard\
    \ deviation σ were computed for the variables P, Rn, and U2 for each month.\n\
    Afterward, we ﬁltered out data instances with anomalies; that is, the instances\
    \ with distance to µ\ngreater or equal than 3 × σ were removed, as performed in\
    \ [78].\n4.2.3. Machine Learning Methods\nWe decided to build the prediction model\
    \ using algorithms which have been widely applied to\nsolve regression problems:\
    \ Linear Regression [46], Decision Stump [47], M5 Model Trees and Rules\n(M5P)\
    \ [48,49], Random Tree, Random Forest [50], and RepTree. Weka [79] provided all\
    \ of these.\nAnother widely used algorithm is the Gradient Boosting Regression\
    \ Tree (GBRT) [51,52] method and\nits implementation XGBoost [80].\nLinear regression\
    \ is a linear model of the relationship between a scalar response (in this work,\n\
    the matric potential ψm) and one or more explanatory variables (see Table 1).\
    \ The linear model consists\nof linear predictor functions which use the data\
    \ to estimate the unknown parameters [46]. Decision\nstump models a one-level\
    \ decision tree. The tree has one root (an internal node) which connects the\n\
    leaves (terminal nodes). The model uses the value of one single feature to make\
    \ predictions [47].\nM5P produces a tree with a multilinear regression model for\
    \ each node. A greedy algorithm\nremoves the insigniﬁcant features in the model\
    \ ﬁtted to each node. Then, the terminal node computes\nnew predicted values,\
    \ considering the predicted values of other intermediate nodes between the\nterminal\
    \ node and the root node [48,49].\nRandom Tree (RT) uses if-then conditions for\
    \ answering questions in a sequential order to achieve\na speciﬁc result. The\
    \ depth of the tree consists of the number of questions needed to reach a prediction\n\
    value. Random Forest (RF) is a collection of decision trees that can use a random\
    \ subset of the features.\nTherefore, the number of trees impacts the number of\
    \ features used and limits the number of errors\ndue to bias or variance [50].\n\
    RepTree is a fast decision tree algorithm in Weka which uses information gain/variance\
    \ to build\na regression tree. Reduced-error pruning takes into account the method\
    \ backﬁtting [79]. GBRT is a\npredictive model based on a weak learner, a loss\
    \ function, and an additive model. The weak learner is\na decision tree that can\
    \ be modiﬁed to achieve better results. The additive model adds weak learners\n\
    to correct for the residual errors of all previous trees. The loss function consists\
    \ of the mean squared\nerror for regression problems [51,52].\nWe set some hyperparameters\
    \ required by RT, RF, RepTree, and GBRT with the default values\nof Weka [79]\
    \ and XGboost [80]. We set the maximum tree depth (max_depth) to 3 for GBRT and\
    \ to\nwithout restriction for the RT, RF, and RepTree methods. The number of trees\
    \ (n_estimators) was\n100 for all methods. Finally, GBRT required a third hyperparameter,\
    \ the learning rate (learning_rate),\nwhich we set to 0.1.\nSensors 2020, 20,\
    \ 190\n13 of 25\nThe training and test sets included, respectively, 80% and 20%\
    \ of the data from each soil moisture\nsensor at a depth of 15 cm. Overall, for\
    \ each possible combination, we generated a model and\npicked the model which\
    \ gave the lowest MAE (Mean Absolute Error) and RMSE (Root Mean Square\nError)—metrics\
    \ which have been widely used to measure the quality of a prediction model (see\n\
    Equations (A6) and (A7) in Appendix B).\n5. Results\nFirst, we employed the outlier\
    \ removal techniques of Fusion Service (Section 3.2) on the real\nsoil moisture\
    \ data in order to analyze the inﬂuence of these techniques on irrigation management\n\
    (Section 3.1.1) in the Smart&Green framework (Section 5.1). Then, we analyzed\
    \ the MAE and RMSE of\nthe machine learning techniques tested with the local and\
    \ global approaches (Section 3.1.2) proposed\nfor the Smart&Green soil moisture\
    \ prediction module (Section 5.2). Finally, we applied the soil moisture\ndata\
    \ created by the best prediction models for irrigation management to analyze the\
    \ water savings\n(Section 5.3).\n5.1. Impact of Outlier Removal Techniques on\
    \ Real Moisture Data by Irrigation Management\nFrom the raw data set (Section\
    \ 4.2), we selected data from from April to October/2017, since\nthere was no\
    \ salvation irrigation in the experimental ﬁeld, which could affect the irrigation\
    \ water need\n(IWN) estimated by water balance and matric potential management.\
    \ Then, we set Fusion Service\n(Section 3.2) to use an outlier removal technique\
    \ to process the matric potential ψc provided by the nine\ntensiometers (soil\
    \ moisture sensors) at 15 cm of depth in the experimental ﬁeld (Section 4.2).\
    \ Second,\nthe Fusion Service aggregated ψc data using the co-operative function\
    \ mean. After this, the modules\nof water balance and potential matric (Section\
    \ 3.1) applied the aggregated ψc to Van Genutchen\nModel (Equation (A1)) to estimate\
    \ the current soil moisture θc at the crop root zone (z = 30 cm) and\ncompute\
    \ IWN.\nWater balance management (Equation (A3)) can depend only on the crop evapotranspiration\
    \ ETc\n(Equation (A4)) and rainfall R to estimate the IWN of a crop. Therefore,\
    \ we can only use weather data\nand the crop coefﬁcient (Table 1) to plan water\
    \ balance for n days. However, the IWN estimation is\nmore precise when we can\
    \ incorporate the current soil moisture data θcz since the water storage in\n\
    the crop root zone can contribute to the crop water supply. We set water balance\
    \ to estimates IWN\nevery three days (n = 3) over six months (26 samples of n\
    \ intervals), and the results in Table 3 indicate\nthat the use of θcz saved an\
    \ average of 90.4% of the IWN estimated, as compared to that using only\nweather\
    \ and crop data.\nTable 3.\nPercentage of water saved over six months by irrigation\

    \ techniques optimized the tradeoff reasonably\nbetween IWN saving and healthy\
    \ crop development, since these outlier removal techniques decreased\nthis result\
    \ to 89.3%. Zscore and MZscore data treatment led to an increment of the moisture\
    \ θc values\n(Figure 5a), and, consequently, a reduction of the term ∆A of water\
    \ balance (Equation (A3)). GESD and\nChauvenet did not affect the moisture θc\
    \ data enough (Figure 5b), as well as IWN saving (Table 3).\nSensors 2020, 20,\

    \ Moisture Data used in Water Balance—the points outside of the dashed lines are\
    \ the\ncurrent moisture data θcz modiﬁed by an outlier removal technique.\nThe\
    \ matric potential approach depends exclusively on the soil moisture data (Equation\
    \ (A2)),\nand we planned this irrigation management to estimate the daily IWN\
    \ over six months (121 samples of\ndays) using the current moisture θc data at\
    \ the shallowest crop root zone (e.g., z = 30 cm). In the matric\npotential approach,\
    \ irrigation occurs only when θc is minor or equal to the critical moisture condition\n\
    θcr, which is the ideal moisture for irrigation and signals when the crop productivity\
    \ is starting to\ndecline. Table 3 presents the IWN saving of matric potential\
    \ management that used an outlier removal\ntechnique when compared to the one\
    \ that did not use them. Figure 6 shows that there were several\ndays where θc\
    \ was equal to θcr (day 1 to 13). However, all outlier remotion techniques treated\
    \ various\noutliers that reduced the current moisture (e.g., 14th and 15th; 18th\
    \ and 19th; 26th days), improving\nthe water savings, on average, by 4.3% to 20.7%\
    \ (Table 3). Zscore and MZscore (Figure 6a) contributed\nmore to the tradeoff\
    \ between IWN saving and healthy crop development because they increased the\n\
    current moisture θc above the critical condition θcr in more days(e.g., the 40th\
    \ to 43th; 64th; 104th days)\nthan GESD and Chauvenet (Figure 6b).\n(a) Zscore\

    \ Models for Soil Moisture Prediction\nThe main goal of this analysis is to evaluate\
    \ and establish the best machine learning (ML)\ntechnique among those tested for\
    \ each approach (local and global prediction models). In this context,\nwe considered\
    \ analog soil sensors (tensiometers) distributed throughout a large ﬁeld (Figure\
    \ 4).\nWe compared the following ML techniques: Linear Regression, Decision Stump,\
    \ M5P, Random Tree,\nRandom Forest, RepTree, and Gradient Boosting. Through the\
    \ metrics MAE (Mean Absolute Error)\nand RMSE (Root Mean Square Error), we evaluated\
    \ the local and global approaches for the estimation\nof the matric potential\
    \ ψm—the primary variable for soil moisture prediction (Appendix B). Finally,\n\
    we used the 99% conﬁdence intervals to determine the best-performing model.\n\
    Table 4 presents the MAE and RMSE retrieved by the local approach for each prediction\
    \ algorithm.\nThe results of the local approach are the mean of the MAE and RMSE\
    \ achieved by the nine models\nbuilt for each monitoring point of the experimental\
    \ ﬁeld. Considering all the analyzed errors, Gradient\nBoosting outperformed all\
    \ the other techniques, followed by Random Forest. Both approaches\npresented\
    \ acceptable errors, according to a specialist agronomic engineer.\nTable 4. Evaluation\

    \ approach for each algorithm. Again,\nthe Gradient Boosting algorithm achieved\
    \ the best results, compared to all other evaluated models.\nIt can be noticed\
    \ that the MAE and RSME of the Gradient Boosting model did not vary as much as\
    \ the\nother evaluated models; this means the global model generalizes well for\
    \ any data from any sensor in\nthe ﬁeld. The Local Gradient Boosting approach\
    \ outperformed the global one. However, even though\nthe global model error had\
    \ an average MAE error increase of 58.9% and average RMSE error increase\nof 45.7%,\
    \ the errors were still acceptable, according to the specialist agronomic engineer.\n\
    We also analyzed the relevance of the features of Table 1, in the context of the\
    \ local and global\napproaches. We employed Gradient Boosting as, according to\
    \ the results of this section, it has proved\nto be the best ML technique for\
    \ our purposes. XGboost [80] estimates the relevance of each feature by\ncounting\

    (b) Global Approach\nFigure 7. Analysis of the relevance of features by gradient\
    \ boosting prediction approach.\n5.3. Analysis of Water Savings through the Use\
    \ of Predicted Data of Soil Moisture\nWe used the local and global models based\
    \ on Gradient Boosting to predict the matric potential\nψm for a ﬁeld without\
    \ soil moisture sensors over six months. The local approach estimated daily ψp\n\
    at a depth of 15 cm, as the ﬁeld had nine monitoring points. Therefore, we could\
    \ apply the outlier\nremoval techniques to treat this data set of nine daily values.\
    \ The global approach estimated one daily\nvalue for the ψp at a depth of 15 cm\
    \ in the ﬁeld. In this case, there was no need for preprocessing the\ndata using\
    \ the outlier removal techniques. We use ψp to compute predicted soil moisture\
    \ data for the\ncrop root zone (z = 30 cm) through the Van Genutchen Model (Equation\
    \ (A1)).\nFor water balance (Equation (A3)), executed every three days (n = 3)\
    \ for six months (26 samples\nof n), we compared the beneﬁts of our computational\
    \ models by analyzing how much they saved,\nin terms of the irrigation water need\
    \ (IWN) estimated using only weather and crop data. Table 6 shows\nthat the use\
    \ of global approach data saved an average of 56.4% and that the local approach\
    \ without\ndata preprocessing saved 100% of the IWN on average.\nThe Zscore and\
    \ MZscore methods tended to treat outliers by removing values that decreased the\n\
    current moisture θc (Figure 8a). Therefore, they reduced the result of the local\
    \ predicted data by 90%\nand 75.6%, respectively, for water balance. The employment\
    \ of Chauvenet for the local approach data\nalso saved 90% of IWN on average since\
    \ it almost achieved the performance of Zscore (Figure 8b).\nThe use of GESD did\
    \ not affect the local approach predicted data (Figure 8b), such that it had almost\n\
    the same water savings as when no outlier removal technique was employed (Table\
    \ 6). We consider\nthe global approach and local approach using Zscore, MZscore\
    \ and Chauvenet techniques optimized\nthe tradeoff between IWN saving and healthy\
    \ crop development, and they did not outweigh the IWN\nsavings of water balance\
    \ that used real soil moisture θc (Table 3).\nTable 6. Percentage of water saved\

    (Figure 9). GESD kept the performance of matric potential management that used\

    Smart Agriculture presently lacks an Internet of Things (IoT) platform for the\
    \ gathering,\npreprocessing, and storage of data used in irrigation management,\
    \ which also allows for the reuse of\ncode to different sets of crops, soil, irrigation\
    \ system, and weather data sources. In this paper, we have\nproposed the Smart&Green\
    \ IoT framework which executes an irrigation management plan using the\nwater\
    \ balance and potential matric approaches according to the crop, as well as irrigation\
    \ system\ninformation provided by users and the weather and soil moisture data\
    \ available close to the monitored\nﬁelds. Smart&Green can be used to preprocess\
    \ soil moisture data with outlier removal criteria and\ntechniques of Zscore,\
    \ MZscore, GESD, and Chauvenet to provide a more precise irrigation water need\n\
    (IWN) in irrigation management.\nFor large ﬁelds without soil moisture sensors,\
    \ we have considered the problem of predicting the\nsoil moisture by analyzing\
    \ the weather data, crop coefﬁcients, and amount of irrigation water. We have\n\
    formally introduced the problem of soil prediction and designed a methodology\
    \ which uses training\nmodels according to two different approaches: Local and\
    \ global. These approaches determine the\nimplementation of prediction models\
    \ based on supervised machine learning techniques.\nThe local approach trains\
    \ a model for each soil sensor in the ﬁeld, achieving high performance.\nHowever,\
    \ this approach can lead to a high cost of data management if there are a large\
    \ number of\nsensors, as it requires the training and maintainence of a large\
    \ number of distinctive prediction models.\nOn the other hand, the global approach\
    \ trains a single prediction model over the observations of all\nthe sensors.\
    \ Our results show that gradient boosting with regression trees (GBRT) outperformed\
    \ the\nother evaluated techniques in both approaches. The local approach had the\
    \ best results with gradient\nboost, although the results using the global prediction\
    \ model were also acceptable.\nFurthermore, we have designed a module to support\
    \ irrigation management with our prediction\nmodels, based on GBRT. We evaluated\
    \ irrigation management using the water balance and matric\npotential approaches\
    \ with real and predicted data of soil moisture, as well as the impact of preprocessing\n\
    data with outlier removal techniques. The real data was part of a data set collected\
    \ from an experimental\nfield for research in the city of Paraipaba, Brazil, in\
    \ which cashews and other raw materials were grown.\nWe also report that the dataset\
    \ will be made publicly available to ensure the reproducibility of our results\n\
    and promote research developments in this field (see Supplementary Materials).\n\
    The use of real soil moisture data from the data set in the water balance approach\
    \ saved as\nmuch as 90.4% of the IWN obtained for the water balance when using\
    \ only weather and crop data.\nZscore and MZscore applied to the real moisture\
    \ data saved 89.3% of IWN, optimizing the tradeoff\nbetween IWN saving and healthy\
    \ crop development. For the matric potential approach, Zscore and\nMZscore obtained\
    \ (on average) 20.7% and 14.1% of the IWN savings obtained by matric potential\n\
    without the use of any outlier removal technique. Considerating a ﬁeld without\
    \ soil moisture sensors,\nwe obtained a reduction between 56.4% and 90% of the\
    \ water balance IWN based on only weather\nand crop data, when we use our global\
    \ and local approaches to predict the soil moisture data. Zscore,\nMZscore, and\
    \ Chauvenet preprocess the predicted data to optimize the tradeoff without outweighing\n\
    the performance of water balance using real moisture data. We do not recommend\
    \ the use of predicted\ndata in the matric potential approach, as the computational\
    \ models (with errors) outperform mostly\nthe same approach using real data in\
    \ terms of water savings, according to our results.\nSupplementary Materials:\

    \ some examples of conﬁgurations composed of a crop, soil, weather,\nand an irrigation\
    \ system. The house is next to the entrance of the farm and has a connection to\n\
    the Internet. The house also hosts devices that connect sensor nodes in the ﬁeld\
    \ to the Internet.\nAutomatic weather stations make weather data available on\
    \ the Internet.\nIn this work, we address ﬁelds with one type of crop whose soil\
    \ has analog (Field 2) or digital\ntensiometers (Field 3) monitoring the moisture\
    \ at more than one depth z. Tensiometers installed\nat different points b of the\
    \ ﬁeld gather readings of the matric potential ψm. Mathematical models\nuse ψm\
    \ to measure the soil moisture θ as the level of water retention in the type of\
    \ soil. We use the\nVan Genuchten Model [57] to express θ as the volume of water\
    \ by the volume of soil (cm3/cm3),\nas Equation (A1) shows:\nθ(ψm) = θr +\nθs\
    \ − θr\n[1 + (α × |ψm|)n]1− 1\nn\n,\n(A1)\nwhere θr is the residual water content,\
    \ θs is the saturated water content, α is related to the inverse of\nthe air entry\
    \ suction, and n is a measure of the pore-size distribution in the soil (e.g.,\
    \ Table 2 has these\nVan Genutchen constants for the experimental ﬁeld soil).\n\
    The management of matric potential estimates the irrigation water need (IWN) for\
    \ a ﬁeld with\nsoil sensors (e.g., Field 3 of Figure A1) taking into account the\
    \ soil moisture at the monitored depths zi,\nas Equation (A2) shows:\nIWN = (θ\
    \ f c,z1 − θcr,z1) × z1 + (θ f c,z2 − θc,z2) × z2 + (θ f c,z3 − θc,z3) × z3\n\
    E f\n,\n(A2)\nwhere:\n•\nzi represent the thickness of soil along the proﬁle (monitored\
    \ depth);\n•\nθ f c represents the ﬁeld capacity at a depth z after the drainage\
    \ of water excess, which is a constant\nobtained by a laboratory soil analysis;\n\
    •\nθcr is the ideal moisture for irrigation, signaling when the crop productivity\
    \ starts to decline;\n•\nθc is the current soil moisture. In matric potential\
    \ management, we initialize the irrigation by\nθc,z1 ≤ θcr; and\n•\nE f is the\
    \ efﬁciency of the irrigation system used in the ﬁeld.\nWater balance management\
    \ computes the IWN for an interval of n days, comparing the inputs and\noutputs\
    \ of water in the soil by using the daily crop evapotranspiration ETc, the rainfall\
    \ R, and ∆A =\n(θ f c − θc)z which represents the soil moisture at the crop root\
    \ zone z through Equation (A3).\nIWN = ∑n\ni=1(ETc,i − Ri) − ∆A\nE f\n.\n(A3)\n\
    The value Ef is the efficiency of the irrigation system placed in the field. The\
    \ crop evapotranspiration\nETc represents the water consumption by a type of crop\
    \ at its current life development stage, which is\ngiven by:\nETc = ETo × kc.\n\
    (A4)\nThe Penman-Monteith model [61] estimates the reference evapotranspiration\
    \ ETo using weather\ndata. Each type of crop, without hydrological restriction,\
    \ has a speciﬁc coefﬁcient curve in which the\ncrop coefﬁcient kc varies from\
    \ 0 to 1.5 with the number days since the planting of the crop.\nSensors 2020,\

    \ Problem of Soil Moisture Prediction\nLet B = {b1, . . . , bn} be the set of\
    \ tensiometers monitoring the soil moisture of a ﬁeld at n different\npoints.\
    \ A tensiometer bj gathers the sample (ψj,15, ψj,45, ψj,75), which consists of\
    \ the matric potential\nψ readings at 15, 45, and 75 cm depths, respectively,\
    \ at a point j. Let W = {w1, . . . , wn} be the set of\nwater amount given to\
    \ the crop at n different points by an irrigation system. Irrigation management\n\
    calculates W using the Equations (A2) and (A3), for example.\nThe weather data\
    \ are required, as the climatic conditions affect a crop’s need for soil water\
    \ and\nrainfall can increase the soil moisture. Therefore, we assume that there\
    \ is a weather station ms close to the\nfield which provides the meteorological\
    \ data set Mms = {Tmin, Tmax, RHmin, RHmax, Rn,U2, P, Ri}, where:\n•\nTmin and\
    \ Tmax are the minimum and maximum air temperature, respectively;\n•\nRHmin and\
    \ RHmax are the minimum and maximum relative humidity, respectively;\n•\nRn is\
    \ the net radiation;\n•\nU2 is the wind speed;\n•\nP is the atmospheric pressure;\
    \ and\n•\nRi is the rainfall.\nWithin a daily time interval, there are several\
    \ observations about the weather and ﬁeld. We denote\nby O the collection of observations,\
    \ which consists of (t, B, Mms, W, kc), recorded within a time t over\na day.\
    \ The irrigation scheduling methods presented in Appendix A decide to start precise\
    \ irrigation\nwhen the current moisture θc,z1 is low at the superﬁcial layer of\
    \ soil (z1 = 15 cm). Therefore, the matric\npotential ψi,15 is analyzed daily\
    \ to achieve θc,z1 using the Van Genutchen model (Equation (A1)). In this\nwork,\
    \ we wish to monitor the level of soil moisture without soil sensors (i.e., tensiometers).\n\
    Let y(i, Mms, wi, kc) be a function that, given the monitoring point i, the meteorological\
    \ variables\nMms, the irrigation water amount wi at the point i, and the crop\
    \ coefﬁcient kc returns ψi,15 (the matric\npotential at a depth of 15 cm). Then,\
    \ y(i, Mms, wi, kc) = ψi,15. We deﬁne the problem of soil moisture\nprediction\
    \ as the problem of ﬁnding an accurate function f for predicting y(i, Mms, wi,\
    \ kc), given all\nthe observations recorded in O.\nSensors 2020, 20, 190\n21 of\
    \ 25\nDeﬁnition A1. The problem of soil moisture prediction requires ﬁnding a\
    \ predictive function ˆf over the class\nof all possible predictive functions\
    \ H, such that\nˆf = argmin∆( f ),\n(A5)\nwhere f ∈ H and ∆ is a loss function\
    \ assessing the quality of a candidate predictive function f over the\nobservations\
    \ in O. In this work, we use the Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) and the Mean Absolute\
    \ Error\n(MAE) loss functions, deﬁned as:\n∆RMSE( f ) =\nv\nu\nu\nt 1\n|O′|\n\
    ∑\n(i,Mms,wi,kc)∈O′\n( f (i, Mms, wi, kc) − y(i, Mms, wi, kc))2, and\n(A6)\n∆MAE(\

    (A7)\nwhere O’ is the set of observations used to assess the quality of the prediction\
    \ and f (i, Mms, wi, kc) is the estimate\nreturned by function f for y(i, Mms,\
    \ wi, kc). The smaller the value yielded by the above loss functions, the better\n\
    the predictive performance of f.\nWe employ Machine Learning (ML) techniques to\
    \ address the problem of soil moisture prediction.\nMore speciﬁcally, we aim at\
    \ learning, from the observations in O, some function ˆf that minimizes the\n\
    error measured by ∆. We train the prediction models on a data set containing examples\

    concept of IoT caught attention in 1999, by means of Auto-ID center at MIT and
    its relevant market investigation publications. Basically, IoT is an integration
    of multiple devices which communicate, sense and interact with their internal
    and external states through the embedded technology that IoT contain [1]. IoT
    has become the megatrend for next generation technologies which can impact the
    whole business spectrum with extended benefits which are advanced connectivity
    of end devices, system and services. IoT offers appropriate solutions for multiple
    applications such as smart health care, smart cities, security, retail, traffic
    congestion industrial control and agriculture [3]. A significant amount of work
    has been done regarding IoT technology in agricultural area to develop smart farming
    solutions [4]. IoT has brought a great revolution in agriculture environment by
    examining multiple complications and challenges in farming [5]. Now a days, with
    the advancement of technology it has been expected that by using IoT agriculturalists
    and technologists are finding out the solution of those problems which farmer
    are facing such as shortages of water, cost management and productivity issues
    [6], [7]. State-of-the-art IoT technologies have detected all these issues and
    provide solutions to increase productivity while lowering the cost. Efforts made
    on wireless sensors networks enable us to collect data from sensing devices and
    send it to the main servers [8]. Data collected through sensors gives information
    about different environmental condition to monitor the whole system properly.
    Monitoring the environmental conditions or crop productivity is not only the factor
    for the evaluation of crop but there are many other factors which effect the crops’
    productivity, e.g. field management, soil and crop monitoring, movement of an
    unwanted object, attacks of wild animals, and thefts etc. [9], [10]. Moreover,
    IoT provides a well-organized scheduling of restricted resources which makes sure
    that the best use of IoT enhances the productivity. Figure 1 shows a schematic
    diagram showing the agricultural trends which provide easy and cost effective
    interactions through a secure and unblemished connectivity across individual Greenhouse,
    Livestock, Farmer, and Field monitoring. Whereby, the IoT agricultural networks
    using the wireless devices enable real time crop and animal monitoring. The figure
    shows that two sensor kits (Libelium Smart Agriculture Xtreme IoT Vertical Kit
    and Crop/Plant Monitoring Sensor Kit) have been implemented which monitor the
    soil moisture, leaf wetness, temperature, humidity, productivity, and air flow.
    While, MooMonitor sensor monitors the animal health, fertility, feeding, ruminating
    and resting. The agricultural servers, gateways, and agriculture database play
    an important role to store agriculture records and provide on demand agricultural
    services to authorized users. FIGURE 1. Agricultural trends. Show All As a whole,
    in agriculture field there are multiple applications, protocols and prototypes.
    IoT agriculture research trends include network platform, network architecture,
    applications, security, and challenges among others [28]–[30]. Moreover, in many
    countries and organizations over globe different IoT policies and guidelines have
    been implemented in agriculture field. However in IoT agricultural environment
    a reasonable amount of work has been done and there is a need of thorough study
    on IoT in agriculture context to understand the current research status. To transform
    agriculture technologies via IoT innovation this paper analyzes various issues
    and trends in IoT smart farming. In this research as a contribution following
    IoT agricultural techniques have been added from literature: Present major components
    of IoT based smart farming along with relevant technologies in Section II. Section

    network architecture and layers, network topologies used; and devices and protocols
    used in agriculture IoT. Different application domains and relevant smart phone
    and sensor based applications have been discussed in Section IV. The security
    and privacy issues in IoT based agriculture have been discussed in Section V.

    related to top technology industries investing in this area. The IoT agricultural
    policies made by different countries for the standardization of IoT based agriculture
    have been discussed in Section VII. This section also presents few success stories
    in this area. Lastly, the open issues and challenges to improve IoT based agricultural
    technologies from many aspects have been presented in Section VIII. SECTION II.
    Major Components and Relevant Technologies for IoT Based Smart Farming A. Major
    Components of IoT Based Smart Farming IoT based smart farming consist of four
    major components as shown in Figure 2. FIGURE 2. Major components of IoT based
    smart farming. Show All These four major components are physical structure, data
    acquisition, data processing, and data analytics. The physical structure is the
    most important factor for precision agriculture to avoid any unwanted happening.
    Whole system is designed in such a way which controls the sensors, actuators,
    and devices. A sensor performs multiple tasks like soil sensing, temperature sensing,
    weather sensing, light sensing, and moisture sensing. Similarly devices perform
    many control functions like, node discovery, device identification and naming
    services etc. All these functions are performed by any device or sensor which
    is controlled through a microcontroller. This controlling operation is performed
    by any remote device or a computer which is connected through the Internet. Data
    Acquisition is further divided into two sub components namely: IoT data acquisition
    and standard data acquisition. Whereby, the IoT data acquisition component consists
    of seven protocols that are Message Queuing Telemetry Transport (MQTT), Websocket,
    Advanced Message Queuing Protocol (AMQP), Node, Constrained Application Protocol
    (CoAP), Data Distribution Service (DDS), and Hyper Text Transfer Protocol (HTTP).
    Depending on the requirements and condition more protocols can be used for the
    implementation of smart farming. Whereas, in the standard data acquisition ZigBee,
    WIFI, Long Range Wide Area Network (LoraWan), SigFox and ISOBUS protocols have
    been used. Data processing consists of multiple features that are image or video
    processing, data loading, decision support system, and data mining as shown in
    Figure 2. According to the system requirements any feature may be added that may
    work in parallel to provide other services. Data analytics consists of two main
    features that are monitoring and controlling. Monitoring involves three main application
    in smart agriculture that are Live Stock Monitoring, Field Monitoring, and Green
    house Monitoring. IoT enables farmers to monitor livestock via multiple sensors
    which are used to monitor different animal’s diseases like temperature, heart
    rate, and digestion etc [11]. Whereas field monitoring applications intend to
    report different conditions of field like soil richness, temperature, humidity,
    gas, pressure (air pressure and water pressure), and crop disease monitoring [12],
    [13]. A smart greenhouse design eliminates the manual intervention and measures
    different climate parameters by intelligent IoT devices and sensors according
    to plants requirements [14]–[16]. B. Iotagricultural Relevant Technologies A Large
    number of technologies are being used in IoT agricultural solutions due to which
    it is hard to make an explicit of all those due to which our discussion focused
    on several core technologies which have played a vital role to modernize the IoT
    agricultural services. 1) Cloud and Edge Computing Collaboration of IoT and cloud
    computing in agriculture provides pervasive access to shared resources. To meet
    various agricultural needs upon request over network and execute operations cloud
    computing plays vital role [17]. Cloud based software architecture has been proposed
    which process and retrieve information and agricultural tasks in a more accurate
    way [18], [19]. In the field of IoT edge computing is considered as a solution
    to facilitate data processing at the source of data generation which are sensors,
    actuators and many other embedded devices. Edge computing or fog computing are
    measured as the backbone of cloud computing. This technology is deployed according
    to the features and requirements of smart farming [20]. 2) Big Data Analytics
    and Machine Learning Big data consist of a large amount of essential which are
    generated by agricultural sensors. Big data analysis provides different and efficient
    crop monitoring methods at different stages [21]. A good systematic review on
    big data analysis in agriculture has been presented [22]. Neural networks are
    very famous because they provide optimal solutions at a very high speed. Intrusion
    detection has been realized by using advance principles and technology of neural
    network. On the other hand most important feature of neural network is that they
    provide detection module and data training [23]. By using deep neural networks
    an IoT based hydroponic system has been developed [24]. 3) Communication Networks
    and Protocols IoT agricultural network consist of different kinds of long ranges
    and short ranges networks for communications. Several IoT networks technologies
    help to design a crop or field monitoring sensors and devices [25]. Communication
    protocols are the backbone of IoT agricultural network system and applications
    [26]. They are used to exchange all agricultural data or information over the
    network. 4) Robotics Multiple Agribots have been developed for the purpose of
    smart farming which are minimizing the amount of farmers by increasing the speed
    of work through advance techniques. Agribots performs elementary functions like
    weeding, spraying and sowing etc. All these robots are controlled by using IoT
    to increase the crop productivity and efficient resource utilization. A multi
    sensor robotics approach has been proposed for characterization and ground mapping
    [27]. SECTION III. IoT Agricultural Networks IoT agricultural network or IoT network
    for agriculture is one of the vital elements of IoT in agriculture. It helps to
    monitor agriculture data and facilitate the transmission and reception of agriculture
    data. As shown in Figure 3, the framework consists of IoT agricultural network
    architecture, IoT agricultural network platform and IoT agricultural network topologies
    and protocols. FIGURE 3. IoT agricultural network. Show All A. IoT Agricultural
    Neworkt Architecture The IoT agricultural network is the main factor of IoT in
    agriculture field [31]. IoT Agricultural network architecture suggests an outline
    for the specification of an IoT agricultural network physical elements as well
    as their working principles, and techniques. Most of the IoT applications usually
    follow the four layer architecture (Network Layer, Application layer, Physical
    and Mac Layer and Transport Layer) due to the popularity and interoperability
    of IP as suggested by Naik [32]. After reviewing these four layers protocol we
    have also survey two more approaches that are IPv6 and 6LoWPAN as shown in Figure
    4. This layer is the final level of abstraction which allows the development of
    multiple user applications. At this layer deployed communication protocols monitor
    different agricultural parameters such as weather information, soil moisture values,
    irrigation monitoring etc. FIGURE 4. Layer structure of the 6LoWPAN. Show All
    1) Application Layer Due to the energy constraints and stringent computation involved
    by the IoT devices there are many lightweight protocols on application layer such
    as CoAP, MQTT, AMQP, and HTTP. These protocols can be increased or decreased according
    to the system requirement. CoAP protocol runs on UDP and works on the principle
    of request or response architecture [33]. AMQP protocol runs over the TCP protocol
    by following publish/subscribe architecture asynchronously and use TSL/SSL for
    security assurance. MQTT is a bandwidth-efficient protocol which uses little battery
    power and designed for receiving and transmitting sensor information [34]. HTTP
    is a well known web messaging protocol which based on the request/response architecture
    [35]. Runs over TCP and does not define any QoS, uses TSL/SSL for security purpose.
    2) Transport Layer This layer is also called host to host transport layer, and
    is directly transferred from IP to IoT domain. The main task of network layer
    is to collect and encapsulate the agricultural information which is obtained through
    sensor layer. There are two protocols that are transmission control protocol (TCP)
    and user datagram protocol (UDP). TCP is a connection oriented protocol which
    ensures the reliability of delivered data. TCP data transmission speed is low
    as compare to UDP. UDP is a connection less protocol which does not ensure reliability
    of data. Its data transmission speed is high as compared to TCP. Both of these
    protocols are used in different applications because their choices depend upon
    the requirements of application. 3) Network Layer This layer is an indispensable
    technology for precision farming and responsible to transmit agricultural information
    at application layer. IP is the major choice with the existing two versions that
    are IPv4 and IPv6. IPv4 came into existence due to increasing the large number
    of addressable devices. Whereas, invention of IPv6 was expected which gradually
    establish on all networking devices. Routing protocol for Low Power and Lossy
    Networks (RPL) is considered as the main protocol while applying routing on 6LoWPAN
    [36]. RPL consist of distance vector routing protocol which uses Destination Oriented
    Directed Acyclic Graphs (DODAG) to specify routes. To support different flows
    of traffic RPL modify itself according to network speed and acknowledge routing
    metrics such as status of the battery used in device, link quality, and higher
    computational cost exchange. 4) Adaptation Layer Adaptation Layer (AL) aim is
    to ensure the interoperability, and implement fragmentation, compression and reassembly
    mechanism. Although AL attained many advances but still there is a complexity
    for IPv6 supporting because its direct use on IoT devices is not considered reasonable.
    Usually clashes were seen with constraints which are associated with IoT devices.
    That’s why, 6LoWPAN made a big effort in order to decrease the limitations of
    IPv6 and make it suitable for IoT devices. Sensors and devices use IPv6 and 6LoWPAN
    to transmit data over IEEE 802.15.4 protocol in IoT agricultural network. 5) Physical
    and Mac Layers This is the bottom most layer in agriculture network archichture
    which is responsible to sense and actuate different agricultural parametrs. Within
    physical and MAC layer IEEE 802.15.4 is one of the most popular standard which
    was designed for low cost, low consumption and low complexity [37]. This standard
    was adopted by many protocols like Wireless HART, ZigBee and ISA100. IEEE802.15.4
    mainly operates in ISM band of 2.4 GHz. Furthermore, it also operate 915 MHz (in
    United Nations of American) 868 MHz (in European countries) and supports up to
    250 kbps data rates. However literature shows some significant limitation of later
    approaches, which are regarding to mobility and network formation [38]. EPC-Global
    (designed for RFID technologies) [39] and Z-wave (particularly designed for domotics)
    [40] have also been used as alternative of IEEE 802.15.4 to exchange information
    directly from internt protocol (IP). B. IoT Agricultural Network Platform IoT
    agricultural network platform refers to both the big data analytics model and
    cloud model. 1) Big Data Analytics Big data analysis applied to find out the required
    and meaningful information from the large amount of data from different data formates.
    The crop disease control and crop growth models build on the basis of farm data.
    Big data analysis also provides decision support services to farmers for crop
    productivity and optimal cost analysis. Figure 5 shows IoT agricultural network
    platform based on big data analytics. The proposed network platform consists of
    six components namely: i) Farmer/User experience, ii) Big Data analysis, iii)
    Sensing and monitoring, iv) Storage services, v) Communication protocols, and
    vi) Physical implementations. This platform provides access to the IoT backbone,
    and helps collecting information about soil fertility, weather conditioning, moisturization,
    and online crop monitoring etc. FIGURE 5. IoT agricultural network platform based
    on big data analysis. Show All a: Farmer Experience Farmer experience layer is
    designed to help the farmers to monitor crop productivity in multiple ways such
    as, for effective growth of crops farmers are awared by identifying the appropriateness
    of fertile selection. Climate conditions, crops growth conditions, soil quality,
    or cattle health monitoring helps the farmers to track the state of their business
    and mitigate the lower production risks. b: Predictive Analysis This analysis
    makes the whole environment smarter by the combination of smart farming market
    intelligence and IoT technology. The major task of predictive analysis is to analyze,
    explore and process the agricultural information for digital awareness. Predictive
    analysis is made to check the probabilistic chance of crop productivity up to
    the next season. Here different detecting devices are applied to check the, Crop
    disease, weather conditions, and estimate the profit/loss on the basis of crop
    productivity. Predictive analysis facilitates the farm to understand the optimal
    time for planting & harvesting and various farm management techniques. c: Multicultural
    Analysis Elaborates the multiple forms of agriculture. In this analysis big data
    analysis minimize the risk of crop destruction according to scientific ways. To
    enhance the growth rate of water featured Botanic Aquaculture layer is equipped
    with big data. Other multicultural techniques like Citriculture, Horticulture
    and Floriculture avail direct benefits when enabled with big data analysis. It
    is helpful for decision making related to crop or plants seasonal growth, and
    pest control. Vermiculture is used for the cultivation of earthworms. Arboriculture
    is basically used for the cultivation of woody plants. Olericulture is an application
    which is used for the prediction and measure the growth rate of different vegetables.
    d: Sensing and Monitoring Sensing and monitoring analysis is made by applying
    different sensing and monitoring devices. Sensors sense data and store the crop
    disease information. Data which is processed through multiple resources is automatically
    achieved by sensing layer. Ststistical analysis has been made on data received
    from sensors in order to actuate the disease. Farmers obtain necessary information
    such as ph value, temperature, soil moisture and humidity through web and message
    service. Real time image and video monitoring on data helps the farmer to gat
    timely and accurate information. e: Communication Protocols Communication protocols
    collect and encapsulate agricultural data. To process and transmit data by using
    these protocols have been considered as the nerve center of IoT in agriculture.
    These protocols consist of internet related technologies like WIFI, LoraWan and
    Code Division Multiple Access (CDMA) technologies. ZigBee is considered as the
    main enabler for communication over long distances when third party service providers
    such as Long-Term Evolution (LTE), CDMA or Global System for Mobile (GSM) are
    not available. f: Storage Services Farmers’ store crop related information to
    make better analysis in future and use stored information in multiple seasons
    for more productivity. g: Physical Implementations Multiple sensors, different
    types of actuators and microcontrollers are implemented physically to monitore
    different agricultural applications. Many other network equipments also implemented
    at physical layer like switches, routers and gateways are included. At this layer
    whole environmental conditions are sensed and then actuate according to a predefined
    instructions. Microcontroller plays the supervisor role and performs networking
    related operations and some other functionality which are done by sensors and
    actuators. An IoT based functional frame work is shown in figure 6. The functional
    framework shows that how agriculturists and farmers can access multiple databases
    with the assistance of support layer from application layer. Business layer contains
    all necessary operation which are important for any IoT farm. Data acquisition
    layer provides connection with session layer through IoT protocols like MQTT,
    AMQP and COAP etc. FIGURE 6. Functional framework for an agricultural information
    service model. Show All 2) Cloud Infrastructure Cloud provides a large amount
    of storage through large virtualized servers which are connected together to perform
    necessary action. A cloud based IoT design has been presented in [41] for precision
    farming. In which IoT techniques are applied to analyze and manage data from farms
    through sensors and devices to generate information for decision making. Design
    recommendations for IoT agricultural network on the basis of Cloud is shown in
    Figure 7. FIGURE 7. IoT agricultural network platform based on cloud. Show All
    Platform has been proposed on the basis of four layers which are Cloud Storage,
    Gateway, Fog Computing and hardware modules. Cloud storage layer centerlized the
    all agricultural related data such as weather related, soil, fertilization, crop
    and agricultural marketing in the cloud and provides on demand resources through
    networked infrastructure. Analyics resources and web services are also installed
    on cloud or internet which are accessible by cloud services. Most of the devices
    or sensors are not designed in such a way which can connect with internet for
    the purpose of data sharing. To resolve this data sharing problem local gateways
    are designed which act as bridge between all hardware devices and sensors for
    connectivity, security and controllability. Implementation of gateway in greenhouse
    or field improves the ability of automation and control the real time greenhouse
    monitoring system. Hardware modules and cloud services are distributed whereas
    resources are integrated through fog computing. Fog computing reduces the computational
    load of cloud and ensures the real time processing. Basic purpose of fog computing
    in this proposed network platform is to leverage the on demand scalability of
    cloud computing resources by taking the advantage of both cloud and edge computing.
    In hardware modules multiple actuators, sensors, microcontrollers and central
    processing unit have been implemented to monitor and sense various agricultural
    variables. Hardware modules are distributed in global or local networks and used
    to create services or processes. For the implementation of smart farming fast
    response time and capability to exchange information is necessary. Both of these
    requirements (fast response time and capability to exchange information) are fulfilled
    by two protocols that are Representational State Transfer (REST) and Message Queuing
    Telemetry Transport (MQTT). Instead of using big data center distributed system
    is more effective for smart farming because it breaks up large computation into
    easy and smaller tasks like: Crop, Temperature, nutrients, energy, climate, moisture
    of soil etc. C. IoT Agricultural Network Topology and Protocols IoT agricultural
    network topology shows the arrangement of multiple elements of an IoT Agricultural
    network and represents an ideal scenario for smart farming. Figure 8 described
    how heterogeneous computing grid collects necessary sensor data by using multiple
    sensing devices such as moisture sensor, humidity sensor, temperature sensor,
    gas sensor, ph sensor, ultra violet sensor etc and forms an IoT agricultural network
    topology. FIGURE 8. Conceptual illustration of IoT-based ubiquitous agricultural
    solutions. Show All This ubiquitous Agricultural solution transforms the storage
    capacity of multiple electronic devices like Smartphone, Laptops, and agricultural
    terminals into hybrid computing grids. Figure 9 visualize a scenario in which
    multiple crop parameters are monitored by implementing agricultural devices and
    sensors in all over the field. FIGURE 9. Farm remote monitoring in agriculture.
    Show All Sensed data is then analyzed and stored, and stored data from multiple
    sensors and devices becomes useful for aggregation. On the basis of aggregation
    and analysis agriculturists/farmer can monitor the different crop variables in
    all over the field from anywhere. Moreover, topology consists of a proper network
    configuration for the streaming of agricultural videos. For example figure 9 support
    the streaming of pests via an interconnected network with an internet protocol
    (IP), GSM, WiMAX and access service network gateway. 1) Low Power WSN Topology
    Figure 10 shows a topology in which low power wireless sensor network has been
    designed to monitor and control the various farming factors. In this topology
    ZigBee is being used for data transmission which consists of multiple end devices
    and router to propagate the information on larger distances. End devices which
    are scattered in the field consist of different kind of sensors such as temperature,
    gas, humidity, soil, Motion detector, PH, UV, PIR sensors and a microcontroller.
    FIGURE 10. Low power WSN topology. Show All End devices are directly connected
    to the router and controller, where controller communicates with base station
    by using serial port to analyze the received information. According to software
    monitoring perspective each end device is properly initialized and attached sensors
    are activated in an appropriate way. Once the sensors are activated then each
    device follows the router to connect in the same way according to which they have
    been designed. After confirmation end device may connect to the WSN by using identical
    key. Data which is collected through sensors is send to the base station which
    takes analysis on received data. When the sensors attached with end devices are
    being read then data is transmitted via ZigBee to the Controller or router. Major
    advantage of this net topology is its bi-directional communication by using ZigBee.
    2) IoT Protocols for Agriculture There are many IoT communication protocols which
    are widely used in agriculture for the purpose of smart farming. By using these
    protocols farmers can communicate in a more convenient way and make more efficient
    decisions for smart farming to enhance and monitor the growth of crop. Most common
    wireless protocols which are being used named: IEEE 802.11 WIFI, 2G/3G/4 G-Mobile
    Communications Standards, LoraWan, WiMax, Low Rate Wireless Personal Area Networks,
    Bluetooth, RFID, and ZigBee. Comparison of all these wireless protocols is given
    in Table 1. TABLE 1 Comparison of Existing Wireless Protocols a: IEEE 802.11 WiFi
    IEEE 802.11 is a compilation of communication standards Wireless Local Area Network
    that is 802.11a, 802.11b, 802.11g, 802.11n and 802.11ac. All these standards operate
    in different bandwidths that are 5 GHz, 2.2GHz, 2.4/5 GHz, 60 GHz and 5 GHz. Data
    transfer range of these standards is from 1Mb/s to 7 Gb/s. Its communication range
    is from 20 m to 100 m [42]. A wifi based wireless sensor network in IoT has been
    discussed for smart agriculture [43]. b: LoraWan LoraWan is a long range communication
    protocol which is developed by an open and non-profit association namely Lora
    TM Alliance. The main purpose of this LoraWan protocol is to assure the interoperability
    between multiple operators [44]. To improve agricultural productivity and anticipate
    the problems a framework has been presented in [45] whose component based on Lora
    and ARIMA technology. c: WiMax Data transfer range of Worldwide Interoperability
    for microwave access is from 1.5 Mb/s to 1 Gb/s. But now a days with the advancement
    of technology data transfer rate has been changed [46]. WiMax provides broadband
    multi access connectivity that includes fixed, portable, nomadic and mobile communication
    through wired or wireless connectivity. Both WiFi and WiMax technologies have
    been deployed in Ministry of Food and Agriculture, Ghana (MOFA) which enables
    user to connect either WiMax networks or building Wifi [47]. d: 2G/3G/4G-Mobile
    Communications Standards There are multiple generations of Mobile Communication
    Standards consist of Second Generation, Third Generation, and Fourth Generation.
    IoT devices Communicate by using these standards over cellular networks. Through
    the use of mobile communication farmer can detect temporal variability across
    their fiels and monitor crop yield, soil and climate conditions [48]. e: LR-WPAN
    Low Rate Wireless Personal Area Networks figure out the specification of high
    level communication standards like ZigBee. Data transfer rate of LR-WPAN consist
    of 40 Kb/s-250 Kb/s. The major property of this standard is that it provides low
    speed and low cost communication services [49]. LR-WPAN is mostly used for indoor
    agriculture such as home garden or in small farms. f: RFID RFID works on the principal
    by assigning a unique number individually to each object in order to record information.
    RFID consists of readers, host and tags where tags receive and transmit radio
    waves due to which it is also known as responder. RFI tags consist of active tags
    and passive tags which are available in different sizes and shapes. Passive tag
    is more advantageous as compare to active tag because it is cheap than active
    tags. Tags have unique ID number and environmental information such as moisture
    level, temperature condition, and humidity etc. These tags are embedded and attached
    in multiple objects to identify that object. g: ZigBee ZigBee is on the top of
    IEEE 802 standards created by ZigBee Alliance. It is a set of specifications for
    device to device network having low power data rates. With the advancement of
    technology and increasing the demand of throughput there is a need of faster and
    low power consumption technology. These requirements are fulfilled by more established
    technologies which provides faster data transfer. In agriculture environment IoT
    sensors sense the data and transfer it towards remote server. After sensing, collected
    data is analyzd for decisions making [50]. h: MQTT MQTT is a messaging protocol
    in IoT which is mainly designed for remote connections. It’s a bandwidth efficient
    protocol and uses little battery power. MQTT is used for continuous analysis and
    deploy a smart system for agriculture sector. A low cost web based IoT solution
    has been presented by using MQTT for monitoring, tracking and analyzing agricultural
    data and collect knowledge from field ambience and improve environmental conditions
    [51]. By using MQTT a low cost irrigation system has been proposed for receiving
    and transmitting sensor information [52]. i: SigFox It’s a low data rate and an
    ultra narrowband wireless cellular network which is appropriate for IoT and machine
    type communications [53]. To construct a geo location system SigFox network was
    used which localize animals pasture of the whole summer [54]. System proposed
    in [55] helps the farmers to locate their cattle’s position and increase their
    productivity. j: Bluetooth Bluetooth is a low power and low range Personal Area
    Network which is best for short range mobile communication. There are many IoT
    agricultural devices which are bluetooth enabled such as Farmnote Air gateway
    and color sensor work with bluetooth enabled sensors. Bluetooth has ubiquitous
    nature due to which it is considered as an appropriate technology for multi-tier
    agricultural applications [56]. SECTION IV. IoT Agriculture Applications IoT agriculture
    system applied as an array of wide variety of fields such as, Precision farming,
    livestock monitoring, and greenhouse monitoring. Agriculture applications have
    been categorized into three sections: IoT agricultural applications, Smartphone
    based applications and sensor based applications. IoT and sensor based applications
    categorization has been illustrated in figure 11 which is framed by reviewing
    the today’s available IoT solutions in agriculture. FIGURE 11. IoT structure in
    agriculture. Show All A. IoT Agricultural Application Domains There are number
    of IoT agriculture applications which are being used to create more efficient
    resources for agriculture productivity. Main domains of IoT agriculture applications
    are precision farming, livestock monitoring, greenhouse monitoring and agricultural
    drones. The following subsection consists of various types of agricultural applications.
    1) Precision Farming Precision farming helps the farmers to improve, automate
    and optimize all feasible directions in order to enhance the agricultural productivity
    and make cropping system smart [57]. Different IoT sensors are deployed to measure
    soil quality, weather conditions, moisture level, and effectively plan to optimize
    harvesting techniques. To enhance the crop production a correlation analysis between
    agricultural environment information and crop statistical analysis has been developed
    to collect crop data [28]. In [58] an IoT based platforms has been developed for
    precision agriculture and ecological monitoring. IoT based weather forecasts helps
    to optimize productivity and take anticipatory analysis to prevent the crop from
    damage. Multiple monitoring devices/sensors are used to predict pest behavior,
    plant or crop growth and address any pending pest issue before they damage crop.
    Ranchers use IoT based irrigation solutions to manage and analyze crop irrigation
    requirements. In [59] a remote agricultural monitoring platform has been presented
    on the basis of monitored data. A conceptual architecture based on cyber systems
    and software defined setworks has been presented in [60] for precision farming.
    IoT base Precision farming consist of multiple monitroing and controling applications
    such as climate conditions monitoring, soil patterns monitoring, pest and crop
    disease monitoring, irrigation, determine optimal time to plant and harvest and
    tracking/tracing. a: Climate Conditions Monitoring In agriculture it is the most
    important to monitor weather conditions continuously so that future activities
    can be planed accordingly. Weather stations are the most popular gadgets in the
    field of agriculture which are used to monitor different climte conditions. Weather
    parameters which are being monitored include temperature, humidity, wind direction,
    and air pressure etc. Located across the field, weather stations collect the environmental
    data and send it to the cloud server. Collected data is used for weather analysis
    to map climate conditions, and provide new insights to take required actions to
    improve agricultural productivity. US Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO)
    has been defined a weather related approach called Climate Smart Agriculture (CSA)
    which helps the user to transform agriculture system by identifying climate conditions
    [61]. A wireless sensor network has been deployed by using IoT technology to monitor
    weather changes by integrating the sensors and devices [62]. b: Soil Patterns
    Soil monitoring has become one of the most demanding practices in agriculture
    field for both industries and farmers. In soil monitoring there are many environmental
    issues which affects on crop production. If hese kinds of issues are identified
    data accurately then the farming patterns and processes can be understand easily.
    Soil patterns which are being monitored consists of Soil Humidity, moisture, fertilization
    and temperature. Soil humidity and moisture sensors are deployed to monitor the
    moisture content in soil [63]. An adequate amount of fertilization in the field
    also increase crop yield [64]. Soil monitoring test report increase crop productivity
    and recommends an appropriate fertilization solutions to farmer [65]. Moreover,
    identification of contaminated soil by using IoT technologies protect the field
    from over fertilization and crop loss. c: Pest and Crop Disease Monitoring Root
    causes of revenue and production losses are crop diseases. Due to the boom of
    IoT agricultural system has been changed into digital system which helps the farmer
    to make informed decisions. Prediction of crop diseases at early stages helps
    the farmers to generate more revenue by saving crop from pest attacks. IoT protect
    crop in multiple ways by detecting different diseases and prevent crop from animal
    attacks. An IoT based monitoring system has been presented in [66] to monitor
    the wheat diseases, pest and weeds. Crop raiding is the biggest issue due to contraction
    of cultivated land into different wildlife haunts. In [67] a monitoring and repelling
    system for the protection of crop against wild animals attack has been presented.
    Detection of crop disease at early stages is very challenging in the field of
    agriculture. Because to detect crop or leaf disease a team of experts is called,
    which is expensive and time taking process. Whereas, automatic detection of diseases
    is very beneficial, accurate and cheaper for farmer as compared to manual observation
    by experts. Image processing technique also plays a vital role for the earlier
    detection of plant disease [68]. A crop disease detection scenario has been shown
    in figure 12. FIGURE 12. Disease detection scenario. Show All Sensed raw data
    via sensing devices is converted into usable format via remote server and then
    stored into database which is displayed through a user interface. After getting
    data multiple data mining models are applied for disease (bacterial, fungal, viral
    etc) analysis. d: Irrigation Monitoring System IoT improve the current irrigation
    system in a more innovative way. A farmer can optimize irrigation system in multiple
    ways by monitoring weather conditions and soil conditions. IoT technology monitor
    irrigation system in four ways like weather forecasting data, control and monitor
    whole field from anywhere, Ethernet connection and WIFI. This modern irrigation
    system facilitates the farmers by installing multiple sensors, reducing farmers
    monthly irrigation cost, and limit water resources [69]. In [70] an intelligent
    irrigation management system has been presented by using Maching learning and
    open source technologies which sense different soil and weather parametrs. An
    IoT based Low cost irrigation system has been designed in [71] which uses HTTP
    and MQTT protocols to inform the user. Water quality is monitored by sensor nodes
    which are empowered with wireless communication. IoT technology measure both physical
    and chemical constraints of ph, dissolved, temperature, conductivity and oxygen
    [72]. Gathered data about water management system is viewed on internet by using
    cloud computing services. Recently multiple IoT irrigation platforms have been
    developed to control the water consumption in the field. In [73] a simple irrigation
    system has been developed by using WSN. In more advance system users can control
    the process of irrigation through cellular technologies. Likewise, system is proposed
    in [75] in which user transfer sensors data via cellular technologies to a database
    system. e: Determine the Optimal Time to Plant and Harvest IoT increase operational
    efficiency and enhance the crop productivity by determining the best possible
    time to harvest and plant. IoT amalgamate multiple existing technologies like
    cloud computing applications, end user applications, wireless sensor networks
    (WSN’s) and Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) to determine the accurate time
    of weeding and seeding [76]. f: Tracking and Tracing IoT provides informative
    data to agricultural companies for better decisions making such as planning, managing
    and connect with business partners intelligently by saving money and time. In
    growing environment soil, air, water, fertilizers, and pesticides conditions are
    monitored by RFID and Global Positioning System (GPS). GPS system is used to find
    the exact location of agriculture field and monitor various agricultural parameters
    by using wireless communication networks. In [77] an architecture has been develop
    which remotely monitor the soil condition and soil structure as per requirement
    of crops culture. In this structure ZigBee is connected with other devices like
    content management system (CMS), Global System for Mobile (GSM) and General Packet
    Radio Service (GPRS) by using Wireless sensor networks to monitor and realize
    real time data checking. GPS provides interface to interact with ARM (an intelligent
    monitoring system to achieve functions like SMS/MMS) and gives an alarm to farm
    manager when an unwanted changes occur and helps the farmers to take corrective
    action. Although it’s operational and maintenance cost is high but it is widely
    used in agriculture due to its exact location monitoring and tracking property.
    g: Farm Management System The adoption of smart farming is correspondingly increasing
    the amount of productivity by reducing the environmental impact but this smart
    farming technique can be possible via Farm Management System (FMS). FMS is a key
    element for processing, planning, and decision making for the purpose of smart
    farming [78]. An integrated FMS allows the farmers to monitor the entire where
    whole data is collected via WSN, GSM modules and microcontroller. An identifier
    is used on the sensors and devices in all over the farm which gives the proper
    knowledge of fertilization, weather data, automatic buffer zone width monitoring,
    and automatic detail record is generated according to per day activities of farm.
    This whole information is stored in the computer in standard format and can be
    accessible via cell phone or internet for further processing. To optimize the
    use of water resources an automated irrigation and monitoring system is used [73].
    Apart from irrigation system farm is also protected from pest and animal intrusion
    [66], [67]. h: Agricultural Drones Drones are defined as Unmanned Aerial Vehicles
    (UAVs) which are being utilized in agriculture to improve various practices of
    farming. These flying devices are controlled remotely by remote control or autonomously
    programmed. Agricultural processes which are performed by drones are crop health
    assessment, spraying, screening, planting, scouting reports, measurement of nitrogen
    in wheat and analysis of soil conditions. Drones facilitate the farmers via integration
    with Geographic Information Systems (GIS) mapping, and crop health imaging. Drones
    are mostly deployed in large farms where issues related to bacteria fungus are
    difficult to handle and require regular monitoring. In the area of agriculture
    pesticides and fertilizers are very important for crop yield [65], [66]. Agricultural
    drones are carrying out this job efficiently because of its high speed and effectiveness
    in the spraying operation. In addition they also deployed to monitor forests,
    livestock and aquaculture. An organization Precision Hawk is using drones for
    valuable data gathering through sensors for surveying mapping, and imaging of
    agricultural land. They perform in-flight monitoring, farmers enters the detail
    about which field to survey and select a ground resolution. An IoT based Farm
    management information system approch has been developed to meet the bussiness
    objectives [29]. Agricultural drones are integrated with GPS devices cameras and
    sensors to monitor crop health, like planting, crop spraying, screening and analysis
    of soil. There are many other advantages of drone’s utilization like crop health
    imaging, plant counting, amount of nitrogen in wheat, plant height, drainage mapping,
    and weed pressure etc. 2) Greenhouse Monitoring In greenhouse plants are grown
    under controlled environment. This glasshouse technology provides benefits to
    growing plants anytime anywhere by monitoring appropriate environmental conditions.
    Cultivation of greenhouse is more intense, therefore in terms of controlling and
    monitoring it requires high precision. To monitor environmental or weather conditions
    there have been several studies on the applications of WSN’s in greenhouse. Recent
    studies shows that how IoT can be implemented in greenhouse to minimize the human
    resources, accumulate energy and provides direct link of greenhouse from ranchers
    to customers. Most of the studies have focused only on remote monitoring and localized
    [14]–[16]. In addition, for the purpose of high precision there have been a lot
    of studies which integrates meta-processing structure with data to transfer it
    on remote infrastructures through internet. By applying well evaluated crop models,
    assessment of the crop status helps the ranchers to take better decisions [80].
    In Figure 13 a Wireless Sensor Network (WSN) has been implemented to monitor the
    greenhouse environment. Whole network is divided into multi parts which processes
    the data and gives feedback. FIGURE 13. WSN for monitoring greenhouse environment.
    Show All Data can be obtained by corresponding sensors and detectors and then
    transferred to the main server for processing. In physical implementation the
    major components are the sensors and network for accurate data transmission. Growers
    setup the different monitoring devices and sensors according to the specific requirements
    and track or record the required information. Agriculturists make better decisions
    by analyzing the received information and achieve specific goals by obtaining
    optimal data. There are many IoT based greenhouse applications such as water management,
    plant monitoring, and climate monitoring etc. a: Water Management To measure the
    exact amount of required water in greenhouses is a key problem. Smart sensors
    are implemented which are controlled by applying multiple IoT techniques to avoid
    from excessive use of water. In greenhouses water management is carried out by
    using automatic drip irrigation which works by following soil mositure threshhold
    that is set accordingly [81]. b: Plant Monitoring IoT sensors and cameras creates
    ideal environment for plants by monitoring the state of plants regularly and generates
    an alert if any problem is recognizable. On the other side, cloud based IoT solutions
    store the sensed data and view it periodically which is helpful for growers to
    ensure that all plants obtains ideal attention in the greenhouse [82]. c: Climate
    Monitoring There are many parameters which are combined to maintain and create
    an ideal environment for plants within strict limits such as, the maintenance
    of ventilation, temperature, carbon dioxide, and oxygen level. This can be made
    possible by deploying IoT enabled greenhouse where smart devices and sensors share
    their information for strong decision making [81]. 3) Livestock Monitoring Optimal
    environment or weather circumstances which absorbs excessive amount of climate
    conditions leaves negative impact on the productivity of animals that is a serious
    issue for many researchers [83]. Whereas, due to increasing the demand of high
    quality dairy products precision livestock also considered as the major concern.
    Each year ranchers lose a large amount of profit because of animals illness. But
    IoT based livestock management solutions helps the farmers to improve the farming
    principles, livestock conditions and dairy products [11]. Just like crop monitoring
    sensors, different livestock monitoring sensors are also attached to the animals
    to monitor their log performance. Livestock monitoring factors varies on the categories
    of animals under consideration such as conductivity of milk, pest attack, humidity,
    and water quality. By tagging RFID to individual animal allow farmers to track
    their location, thereby preventing animal from theft. Connected sensors and wearables
    in the livestock allow the farmer to monitor overall animals’ activities and data
    streamed to the cloud directly helps the farmers to identify the issues. Cowlar
    and SCR by Allflex are using smart agriculture sensors to monitor animals health,
    activity, temperature, nutrition and collect information on each individual as
    well as about the herd [84], [85]. In the field of livestock several studies have
    been realized. Wireless Sensor have been used which are most advantageous for
    large farm as well as for hazardous gas monitoring. An IoT based livestock scenario
    is shown in Figure 14. FIGURE 14. IoT based livestock scenario. Show All In the
    field different IoT sensing devices have been deployed to monitor the weather
    conditions via weather station and sense other activities in the field by all
    other data sources which have been implemented in the whole farm. Sensed data
    is stored on the cloud server, which user can use for decision making. User can
    interact remotely by using multiple smart devices (Laptops, Tablets, and Mobile
    etc.). Some IoT base applications of livestock monitoring have discussed below:
    a: Animal Temperature Monitoring Identification of disease symptoms and prevention
    is the major function for animal health monitoring. Normal body temperature of
    dogs is 38.3°C-39.2°C and cow’s is 38.5°C-39.5°C. When the body temperature is
    increased or decreased from the normal body temperature then it indicates that
    animal is suffering from any disease [86]. b: Heat Stress Level Heat stress decreases
    the cow’s milk productivity with same dietary input, due to which farmers face
    the cost production issues. In summer season moisture content becomes low due
    to which stress level in animals increased, because of this animal can also die.
    c: Physical Gesture Recognition Gesture analysis can be made by using IoT animal
    monitoring devices. Animal’s gesture behavior is classified into different groups
    such as in cattle, this behavior is consisting of two classes that are traveling
    and stationary. Traveling behavior consists of animal’s walking, running and grazing
    whereas stationary behavior is animal’s sitting, sleeping and standing. d: Rumination
    Rumination monitor the digested food by animal and it is detected by mounting
    a monitoring device in the animal’s (cows) nose. In this way farmer can get accurate
    indication about animal’s health. e: Heart Rate Measurement of heart rate is an
    indirect method which impacts due to the agitation and stress that cow have. Normal
    heart rate of cow is 43 to 84 bpm whereas calf’s normal heart rate is 100 to 140
    bpm. By using IoT devices and sensors heart rate can be monitored constantly.
    f: GPS Based Monitoring GPS system is used to obtain the specification of farm
    and sends the monitored parameters to central monitoring station by using wireless
    sensor network. To prevent animals from theft, wild attacks or weather conditions
    a repelling system has been provided by using wireless technologies like Zigbee,
    WIFI, and LoWPAN [88]. B. Agricultural Solutions by Using Smart Phones From the
    last few years it has been observed that integration of electronic devices with
    smartphones innovate the technology world and smartphones are taken as a driver
    of IoT. To make smart phones versatile in agriculture field various hardware and
    software have been designed. A good (but not complete) survey of smart phone apps
    providing agricultural solutions has been presented [98]. Figure 15 showing a
    classification illustration of smart phone apps for smart farming. Morever, there
    is a number of recent apps which are serving similar functionalties. All smart
    phone apps which are elaborated in figure 15 discussed in tabular form with a
    small description of each. These smart phone apps are not limited; developers
    from all over the world have developed many e-Farming apps therefore, this paper
    highlighted some selected apps which have been discussed according to their popularity.
    FIGURE 15. Smartphone applications for agriculture. Show All C. IoT Devices and
    Sensors in Agriculture In today’s modern world everything needs to be automatic
    with less man power by consuming less time. Sensor is such a device which can
    fulfill this requirement by detecting same input from the existing physical environment
    and responds back. User set some setting over sensing devices to perform their
    task without the involvement of human. There are some major IoT sensors like:
    Motion Detector, PIR, Soil Moisture, Temperature, Humidity, Barometric Pressure,
    Ultra Violet, PH, and gas sensor. In Table 3 various sensor based agricultural
    applications, their operations and IoT association have been discussed but table
    2 pay attention only on smart phone agricultural apps. TABLE 2 Smartphone Agricultural
    Applications Description TABLE 3 IoT Sensor Based Applications in Agriculture
    SECTION V. IoT Agricultural Security In the coming years agricultural sector is
    expected to witness the extensive acceptance of IoT and grow through the new e-farming
    IoT applications and devices. These agricultural applications and devices are
    expected to deal with a large amount of sensitive data. Due to the distributed
    nature of IoT a single security protocol is not sufficient therefore, leakage
    of information is a major security concern [107]. If we adopt IoT fully in the
    field of agriculture then it will be more critical to analyze and identify the
    distinctive features of privacy and security like different security requirements
    and threat models in the perspective of Agriculture. On the basis of literature
    some security issues has been presented in Figure 16. FIGURE 16. IoT security
    issues in agriculture. Show All A. Security Requirements IoT based smart farming
    security requirements are similar to standard security scenario. Therefore, to
    achieve a secure farming solution we have need to pay attention on the following
    security requirements: Confidentiality: Agricultural information or personal data
    relevant to it should be accessible only by authorized users. Integrity: Here
    integrity means received and stored data or content is not changed. Authentication:
    Authentication means peer devices should have an identity to which it is communicating.
    Data Freshness: It consists of key freshness and data freshness because IoT agricultural
    networks sometime provides varying measurements, therefore it is necessary to
    ensure that every message is fresh. Non Repudiation: Its means a node can never
    deny to send a message that sent earlier. Authorization: Here authorization means
    for network or any other resources only authorized devices are allowed. Self Healing:
    If any device in an IoT based agricultural network fail or out of energy then
    other devices in the network should be able to provide security to some extent.
    B. Security Challenges Security of IoT based smart farming mainly consists of
    three basic requirements that are Authentication, access control and confidentiality
    of the stakeholders. Whereas, at the perception layer network must be secured
    from external attacks and in the network layer aggregation of the data should
    be secured. Authorize specific entities ensures that only authorized user can
    access data from application layer [28]. The most common issue of security in
    the perception layer is physical security that is the security of hardware and
    information acquisition security [108]. Here physical security is very important
    because all the devices are deployed in an open field. That’s why a single security
    protocol is not enough because IoT devices may be implemented in a diverse environment.
    Another major security issue is leakage of information, this information consist
    of location and sensitive data. Security countermeasures consist of data encryption,
    jamming, blocker tags use, modification in tag frequency, and tag destruction
    strategy. There is a difference between sensor nodes and RFID tags that’s’ why
    while implementing encryption algorithm, intrusion detection policies, key distribution
    and routing policies, hardware restrictions should keep in mind [109]. In IoT
    concept data flows from an end device towards gateway, during this process data
    also uploaded to other platform such as cloud infrastructure. There are multiple
    security policies exist for sensor nodes like identity authentication, data filtering,
    cryptographic algorithm, data flow control mechanisms etc. Cheating, wiretapping,
    replay attacks and tampering are also security threats. Due to which, confidentiality,
    authentication and integrity should be must employed while data acquisitions phase
    [17]. C. Stack Challenges Middleware layer also plays a vital role in IoT to increase
    security. Middleware stands in between application layer and network layer which
    is responsible to process data and provide interface for communication between
    these layers. Middleware layer requires secure and confidential data storage.
    Secure transmission via wireless medium is very challenging in IoT deployment
    due to which IoT based architecture is at risk like vulnerability, denial of services,
    illegal access, and many virus injects. In this way data integrity and confidentiality
    is affected by such attacks. According to IoT vision application layer is one
    of the top most layers and closely related to the cloud due to its computation
    resources and storage nature. Security issue at application layer and cloud are
    very similar such as data security, backup, recovery and privacy. Therefore, access
    rights of the data, information and ownership for physical users, machines and
    organizations should manage and administered by a control mechanisms. D. Threat
    Model Both IoT agricultural devices and networks are at risk because of increasing
    attack surface. IoT agricultural threat model consist of three scenarios. First
    one is cloud networks, second is native networks expansion and third is cloud
    services. Threat may be generates from internal or external network. If an attack
    is arise from an agriculture device then it will be considered as one of the more
    severe attack. Because it is very difficult to detect the malicious device within
    the network. In addition an adversary may attack on an agriculture device and
    network and use power device like mobile, laptop or tablet or may be same kind
    of IoT devices to penetrate the network. E. Attack Taxonomy There are many types
    of attacks in IoT paradigm due to which an attacker may attack by adopting a method
    on future or existing IoT agriculture devices and networks. In IoT agricultural
    field threat may be tangible, predictable or unpredictable. In this paper existing
    and possible threats are classified on the basis of three key factors: which are
    Information Disruption, Host, and networks. 1) Attacks on the Basis of Information
    Disruptions Stored agricultural data may be analyzed or manipulated by a hacker
    to provide wrong information. Such attacks consist of Interruption (denial of
    services), Interception (threaten data privacy and confidentiality), Modification
    (unauthorized access to the agricultural data), Fabrication and replay. 2) Attacks
    on the Basis of Host Properties Host properties attacks occure in two forms namely:
    hardware compromise (attacker may attact on device program code data or keys and
    reprogram the devices with malicious code) and software compromise (attacker may
    take the advantage of software vulnerabilities and glitches like operating system,
    applications software and system software). 3) Attacks on the Basis of Networks
    Properties Two types of attacks can be arised on basis of networks properties.
    Namely: standard protocol compromise (to threat service availability like integrity
    and authenticity where attacker deviates from standard protocols) and network
    protocol stack (consist of different types of vulnerabilities). F. Reference Security
    Model for IoT Based Agriculture IoT agricultural paradigms are not yet strong
    but continued to build up due to which currently it is difficult to discover all
    possible threats and vulnerabilities in IoT agricultural field. However, when
    experts find the security solution to solve the apparent security threats at that
    point they should have the ability to mitigate the hidden security issues. To
    accomplish a security solution, security checks should be deployed with dynamic
    properties. Consider a framework in which security mechanism consist of different
    systems which can detect and prevent IoT agricultural system from attacks. Now
    consider, that an attacker generate a new type of attack on agricultural applications
    devices and networks to steal agricultural information integrity. In such conditions
    existing security techniques should indentify this new attack by using dynamic
    algorithm. A security model presented in Figure 17 has been discussed to resolve
    these issue. The model is illustrated with its three security systems: protection
    system is designed to mitigate the attack while, dignosing system collects activity
    data from agricultural applications, networks, nodes and analyzes detected agricultural
    data. Reaction system is designed to help the agricultural entities survive all
    types of attacks. FIGURE 17. An intelligent collaborative security model for smart
    farming. Show All FIGURE 18. Selected IoT agricultural products. Show All Whole
    system has been designed by following dynamic algorithms. To prevent from present,
    probable and hidden attacks this system has strong collaboration. Upon intrusion
    detection system issues an operation command and store in reaction system after
    that share their anomaly diagnosing experience with protection system to prevent
    from further attacks. Operation command receive response from identification service,
    reaction system remove the system failure risks and after that pass out its experience
    with other two systems that are protection and diagnosing systems. In this way
    a complete inter collaboration system is accomplished. SECTION VI. IoT Agricultural
    Industry Trends and Practices The IoT in agriculture field has experienced a burst
    of creativity, activity, venture capital firms and exciting entrepreneurs. The
    space becomes visible as an active group of large firms and new start ups that
    are willing to become the part of what may be a giant market and technologies.
    In this section an extensive record of some products and technologies has been
    provided for a good understanding of IoT position in agriculture field. 3D Crop
    Sensor Array with PAR Addon can be mounted on any location, to monitor temperature,
    humidity and carbon dioxide in the farm [110]. EC-1 Controller monitors the environmental
    conditions and then programs them to control the environment by turning off and
    on devices [111]. Arable Mark is the first device which links the global weather
    data within the field observations developed by Arable. With the unprecedented
    ground truth accuracy device makes informed decisions and deliveres real time
    monitoring information to the palm of user’s hand [112]. Growlink designed Growlink
    one controller to deliver smart farming experience. It has highest processing
    power and components quality to coordinate with multiple sensors and devices in
    all over the farm. This device is simply all in one and farmers can expand the
    system according to their requirements by adding additional microcontroller via
    IP networks [113]. Easternpeak offers an IoT GreenIQ agricultural device which
    control irrigation and saves water of your garden’s lawn from anywhere. Growers
    can save up to 50% outdoor water bills by using a GreenIQ smart sprinklers controller
    [114]. Grofit provides a climate monitoring device based on Bluetooth and its
    transmission range is up to 200 m in all over field. This device also provide
    data log which store maximum 30 days measurements. Growers can monitor air humidity,
    real time air temperature and sun radiations by using this device [115]. MeteoHelix
    weather station designed by allmeteo which provides reliable, stable and open
    meteorological solutions according to weather requirements. This weather station
    provides multiple features like temperature, humidity, atmospheric pressure, dew
    point, sun radiations, and solar radiations measurement [116]. Leaf Wetness sensor
    is developed by Smart Element which determine the wetness of leaf by electrical
    resistance on the surface of sensor. It is used to measure wet and dry time on
    the leaf surface [117]. Swip Track Micro locates any moving object in all over
    the field that may be any farming machine, vehicle or engines [118]. Waspmote
    Plug & Sense! Smart Agriculture Xtreme is a sensor node which provides more reliable
    and accurate information about weather. This sensor measures the wind and rainfall
    condition via optical technology. The presence of fertilizers and soil morphology
    can be analyzed through this sensor by measuring the oxygen level, water content,
    and soil water potential [119]. SKY – Lora Weather Station can easily communicate
    to nearby master sensor through LoRa [120]. This is suitable for those locations
    where there is nearby connectivity. This weather station can send data up to 600
    meter away to a master sensor which has WIFI connection. Pycno has been developed
    a Pulse IoT automation sensor which comes in a self-sustained package powered
    by a tiny solar panel [121]. Sensor is WIFI and LoRa enabled device which has
    multiprotocol port in the bottom. In future Pulse Automation Sensor and Pycno
    soil sensor will be integrated to actuate devices and talk with each other in
    the field. CropX Starter Kit – Soil Temperature 24/7 is a real-time soil-temperature
    monitoring Sensor. This sensor has direct cellular connection and better accuracy
    which provides advance sensing capabilities [122]. Some top technologies firm’s
    trends and directions are highlighted in Table 4. TABLE 4 IoT Agricultural Trends
    and Directions of Some Well Known Technology Industries SECTION VII. IoT Smart
    Farming Policies and Success Stories A. Policies Many countries have understood
    the importance of IoT and facilitating through its advance monitoring techniques.
    Government of different countries is seizing the IoT opportunity and investing
    maximum to boost up the crop productivity. Adaptation of IoT technology in different
    countries has been discussed in this section. 1) Australia Government of Australia
    has invested AU$ 134 million to boost up farming. Due to this large investment
    a center was created by a private company in Sidney to implement IoT technologies
    for Smart farming [150]. In 2014 an Innovative Network for Precision Agriculture
    System was established for the purpose of a collaborative frame work to create
    a national agenda in Australian agriculture. In terms of privacy and security,
    in 2015 an American farm Bureau took the lead in establishing a privacy and security
    set for farm data [151]. 2) Ireland Irish Farmer’s Association (IFA) Launched
    a program for agriculturists to reduce the cost, to improve the soil quality and
    guides the farmer how to save water and energy by adopting new technologies [8].
    When the farmers follow these instructions the results were very positive and
    encouraging. Companies saved almost 8700 euro, 10% reduction in green house gas
    emission, 21% savings in pasture management and 47% saving was achieved by Soil
    Fertility. In 2016 a nationwide SigFox network was launched by VT-Networks Ireland
    which provides solution for tracking security sensors and farm assets [153]. 3)
    France Ministry of Agriculture in France has become the partner of the Agriculture
    Innovation Project 2025. The basic aim of this project is to increase the strengthen
    of agricultural land, monitor the climate conditions and create incubators to
    improve agriculture field in France. Ministry of agriculture also share the collected
    data with farmer’s to propose new solution in the field of Agriculture [154].
    French agriculture is administrated by European Union (EU) rules and supported
    through a policy called Common Agriculture Policy (CAP). A new CAP framework was
    defined in 2015 at EU level for next five years which is beneficial for different
    agro ecology projects for farming. 4) China In 2016 china launched its 13th five
    years plan to integrate IoT in the field of agriculture to enhance profitability
    [156]. Project has been started in different eight provinces, with multiple products,
    technologies and 426 applications. Data was collected from multiple provincial
    and national level data centers. Moreover, NB-IoT App by Huawei company in china
    transforming the agriculture in a more efficient and an innovative way. NB-IoT
    provides low cost agriculture solutions as compare to cellular network where gateway
    implementation is not necessary. Huawei NB-IoT has large number of connections
    and wide coverage due to which it can resolve issue of scattered agricultural
    data [157]. 5) Malaysia Agricultural policy in Malaysia was established in two
    periods of time policy before and after independence 1948–1957 and 1957–2020 [158].
    The purpose of the policy was to enhance the growth of crop and decrease the poverty.
    Multiple solutions have been created by Malaysian Institute of Microelectronic
    System (MIMOS) which are best for agriculture development. A sensor named Mi-MSCANT
    PH has been developed by MIMOS to gather environmental data. An agricultural framework
    has been developed by MIMOS to integrate IoT technologies which create a bonding
    between suppliers, traders, and agricultural producers mutually in unified manners.
    This framework utilizes technologies named Micro Electro Mechanical System (MEMS)
    and WSN which automatically collect environmental data [159]. 6) USA USA has funded
    million Dollars to generate new agricultural technologies to fulfill the necessary
    requirements of energy and food. National Institute of Food and Agriculture worked
    on a project that is Internet-of-Ag-Things and develop sensing technologies for
    smart farming practices. The major purpose of this project is to develop precision
    technologies to enhance the efficiency of agriculture industries and make better
    use of water, fertilizers and organic food [160]. The U.S. Department of Agriculture
    (USDA) has started a project to address water management challenges and develop
    new solution for those issues which are affecting agriculture. Technology experts
    are using USDA datasets to improve and design agricultural services [161]. 7)
    Thailand In Thailand National Electronics and Computer Technology Center (NECTEC)
    applying innovative IT technologies for the purpose of smart farming and their
    major focus is on four agricultural products including Rubber, Rice, Sugar and
    Cassava [162]. The major concern of this movement is to increase the agricultural
    productivity and facilitate the farmers in all rural areas of Thailand [163].
    Faculty of Science and Technology at Thammasat University developed an IoT-based
    irrigation control system which helps the grower to preset watering cycle timing
    in advance. A smart farm service provider namely; FarmD Asia was established in
    2015 to boost up the agricultural productivity by its flagship products. FarmD
    Asia has also designed a pesticides aerial drone which covers upto eight acres
    land in single fly. National Science and Technology Development Agency (NSTDA)
    launched Agricultural System Integrator (ASI) program which was primarily designed
    for farmers to start and run smart farm successfully [164]. 8) India Different
    IoT policies have been formulated by Indian government in order to leverage the
    strength of their agricultural field in all over the world. Indians basic purpose
    is to monitor the earth density, soil conditions, temperature and alerts the farmers
    to control pest related issues. In 2015 a policy on IoT in India was released
    by Ministry of Communication and Information Technology to transform digital landscape
    by using IoT [165]. 9) Philippine Philippines have used the remote sensing techniques
    to increase the production of rice. They are also using ground data processing
    and satellite imagery techniques to generate more information on different agricultural
    conditions. University of Southeastern Philippines (USeP) proposed an intelligent
    solution to monitor crop heat stress by using IoT technology with the collaboration
    of Western Mindanao State University (WMSU). In this project research team is
    on the brink with an effective technology counter heat stress which helps the
    farmer to get maximum benefit with the fewest inputs [166]. B. Food and Agriculture
    Organization of United NATIONSNN Food and Agriculture Organization of United Nations
    (FAO) is an e-agricultural organization which follows the international efforts
    to fulfill the deficiency of food in all over 130 countries worldwide. FAO predicted
    that there is a most probability that world population will reach 9.8 billion
    by 2050 therefore, it is necessary to increase the food production 70% by 2050
    to fulfils the growing demand of food through the utilization of IoT technology.
    Mitsubishi Corporation (MC) and Vegetalia, changing Japanese agricultural sector
    by their join forces through AI and IoT. By using tensiometer sensors Tevatronic
    develops an autonomous irrigation system which is placed in the ground near the
    plants for monitoring. From the last 74 years FAO has been changed the agricultural
    world by launching its top ten achievements given in table 5 [167]. TABLE 5 Top
    10 E-Agricultural Strategies of FAO C. IoT Agriculture Success Stories This research
    indicates that there have been several tools and techniques which helps the farmers
    to improve the crop productivity in a more innovative ways. Some IoT agriculture
    relevant technologies have been discussed in section I which provides additional
    tools to the farmers or agriculturists to increase the crop yield. Section III
    describes the different IoT and Smartphone based applications which facilitate
    the farmers to enhance the agriculture productivity by providing extended benefits.
    However over the globe governments are seizing the IoT opportunities in agriculture
    by making large investment. There are many pilot projects which reflects a great
    potential in the future of IoT in agriculture at country level such as china,
    India, Malaysia, Thailand, Taiwan etc. Therefore, in this research we have also
    discussed the results of some pilot projects conducted and being executed in different
    countries. Table 6 prepresents the success stories of these pilot projects in
    different countries with the main IoT agricultural applications (precision farming,
    greenhouse, and livestock). TABLE 6 IoT Agriculture Success Stories SECTION VIII.
    IoT Agricultural Challenges Many researchers have worked on IoT agriculture system
    and solve multiple technological issues and architectural problems by implementing
    and designing various IoT agricultural solutions. Moreover, according to the research
    point of view in the literature, there are also several open issues and challenges
    which are needed to address successfully [57]. There are many challenges which
    are linkage with IoT smart farming deployment and applications. This research
    has identified some explored and unexplored IoT agricultural issues and challenges.
    A. Hardware Challenges Several challenges arise in IoT agricultural setup. First
    of all the equipments which exists at the perception layer are directly expose
    to harsh environmental experience such as, rain, high level temperature, extreme
    humidity, hard winds, and many other possible dangers which destroy electronic
    circuits. End devices works consistently for a long period by depending on inadequate
    batteries power resources. So, a suitable programming tools and less power potential
    is necessary because in case of any program failure instantly battery replacement
    is complicated especially in a large scale open field [144]. B. Networking Challenges
    These challenges are not only for the hardware implementations, but also exist
    at the network layer. Due to high cost of wiring, wireless communication is most
    important for the deployment of IoT based agriculture. Physical deployment shows
    that accepted transceivers performance is exaggerated by human presence, temperature,
    humidity and many other barriers inside the space where wireless device or node
    wants to communicate. Due to which there should use most reliable and robust technologies
    to transfer data according to the environmental challenges and rural conditions
    [8]. A detailed analysis on IoT agriculture networking challenges and issues is
    given [145]. C. IoT Agricultural Platforms IoT agricultural architecture is more
    complicated as compare to other IoT end devices and requires real time monitoring
    system with additional stringent requirements. For this a tailored computing platform
    is needed with run time libraries. A service oriented approach (SOA) can also
    take to build a suitable platform; such services can be exploited by using different
    API’s. In addition, appropriate frameworks and libraries should be developed so
    that agricultural developers can make resourceful use of available document, classes,
    codes and other useful data. D. Other Technical Issues 1) Interfernce To implement
    smart farming a large number of IoT devices are deployed for agricultural purpose
    that creates hindrance especially for those IoT devices which are using unlicensed
    spectrum like Sogfox, ZigBee, LoRa, and WIFI. These technical issues reduce the
    reliability and loss of data. Moreover, unnecessary interference can be eliminated
    by using IoT devices with licensed spectrum. But, among the IoT devices which
    are using cellular licensed spectrum the reprocess of non-orthogonal multiple
    access method can create hindrance because of restricted pilot assignment in cellular
    band. 2) Reliability In agriculture field mostly the IoT devices are deployed
    in an open environment. Due to which there may occur some inconsiderate environmental
    impacts which may cause the communication failure as well as degradation of deployed
    sensors. Therefore, physical safety of IoT devices and system is necessary to
    secure the expensive gadgets from unauthorized user and severe attacks like weather
    conditions or theft. 3) Scalability Billions of IoT devices have been increased
    gradually, due to which more devices are getting connected. Therefor, large number
    of gateways and protocols are needed to support IoT devices. Moreover, IoT agricultural
    back end databases and network applications should be reliable and scalable because
    with the addition of diverse application related operations becomes more complex.
    Therefore, design a highly scalable security scheme and an intelligent IoT system
    for each end device. 4) Resource Optimization Farmers need optimization of resources
    to measure how many IoT devices, gateways, size of cloud storage, and amount of
    transmitted data is required. Due to different farm sizes and variables like crop
    or livestock monitoring resource optimization has become challenging because there
    is a need of different sensors and devices to perform each function. Therefore,
    this will require complex mathematical models and algorithms are required to determine
    the resource allocation for maximum agriculture productivity. 5) Cost Analysis
    and Lack Knwoledge of Technology In the field of agriculture profit margin is
    very important, there is a need of stability the trade-off between the deployments
    of IoT enabling technologies. When an IoT system is deployed the cost of implementations
    are very high like IoT devices/Sensors, gateways, and base station infrastructure.
    After that maintenance cost also important for the use of central services which
    are necessary for IoT devices management, data collection, and information sharing
    among all other services. Moreover, the major factor of slowing IoT in rural areas
    is basically the lack knowledge of IoT and its applications. This is the main
    problem because majority of ranchers is uneducated and lives in rural areas. Therefor,
    it is most important to overcome these obstacles by educating farmers in order
    to generate more revnue [7]. 6) Deployment of LPWA Technologies There is a large
    number of IoT devices in Agriculture scenario, and such devices should liable
    to be heterogeneous in the context of their transmit, receive, sleep, and deep
    sleep along with others. In the terms of power requirements each communication
    layer confronts a supplementary challenge. For example, to confirm the service
    accessibility at MAC layer to find a low power device discovery protocol is a
    difficult task. 7) Universal Platform Adaptation of IoT in agriculture will shift
    from just specific crop to a standard platform which can support multiple smart
    farming applications for crop productivity. This standard platform creates a system
    which can be easily modified to support multiple agricultural applications ranging
    from monitoring to managing. This kind of platform will be free from any kind
    of geographical limitations work as an enabler in IoT agriculture system. 8) Mobility
    IoT agricultural network should have the capability to hold up and maintain the
    farmers mobility. So, that they can connect their farms from anywhere at any time
    [146]. 9) Quality of Service (QOS) Recent studies on QoS highlight that at each
    layer of IoT architecture QoS is required [147] [148]. The ability to make sure
    that devices which needs to transmit sensitive information will be capable to
    do this by using IoT technology without any barrier is still an open research
    issue. There is a need to do more work by providing a mechanism that guarantees
    QoS throughout IoT network layers. E. The Business Model IoT agricultural business
    approach is not still vigorous because it consists of a set of essential elements
    with the latest requirements like new operational policies and processes to transform
    the organizational structure. F. Organizational Challenges When talk about food
    organizations and agricultural sectors, is mean the exchange of information and
    goods transportation. IoT is renovating this whole business process by providing
    reliable and accurate delivery of all products and materials [1]. At the circumference
    of network to store and process the data cloud computing provides highest quality
    of services like efficient storage, computational resources, and application development
    tools for hardware diagnostic. That’s why cloud computing is an ideal accompaniment
    in the world of IoT technologies. At the end of the network a large amount of
    data is produced which needs high cost to transfer towards cloud in terms of latency
    and money [18]. Due to which it is a serious issue because of workload and optimal
    balancing. On the other hand fog computing also the cloud computing extension
    which expanding cloud technologies like tools, and the application development
    scope [149]. SECTION IX. Conclusion All over the globe researchers are exploring
    technological solutions to enhance the agriculture productivity in a way that
    complements existing services by deploying IoT technology. In this article, we
    have presented a comprehensive survey on the state-of-the-art for IoT in agriculture.
    To this end, we discuss agricultural network architecture, platform, and topology
    which help to access to IoT backbone and facilitates farmers to enhance the crop
    productivity. In addition, this article provides an extensive overview on current
    and continuing advances in IoT agricultural applications, devices/sensors, communication
    protocols and many innovative technologies. This research considers various IoT
    agricultural challenges and security requirements for the better understanding
    of IoT smart farming security. Furthermore, many important dimensions of IoT based
    agricultural including technologies, industries trends and countries policies
    have been also been presented to facilitate various stake holders. Government
    has started patronizing IoT in agriculture and it is anticipated that soon IoT
    in agriculture will revamp the conventional farming method. It is also clear that
    many big organizations have started investing and developing new techniques for
    farm management system using IoT. Finally, it is expected that this comprehensive
    survey results into a very useful piece of information for researchers, professionals,
    agriculturists and policy makers who are participating and working in IoT field
    and agricultural technologies. Authors Figures References Citations Keywords Metrics

    Communications and Sensing for 6G and Beyond: A Comprehensive Review Wei Jiang
    and 14 more April 04, 2024 Next-generation cellular technologies, commonly referred
    to as the sixth generation (6G), are envisioned to support a higher system capacity,
    better performance, and network sensing capabilities. The terahertz (THz) band
    is one potential enabler to this end due to the large unused frequency bands and
    the high spatial resolution enabled by the short signal wavelength and large bandwidth.
    Different from earlier surveys, this paper presents a comprehensive treatment
    and technology survey on THz communications and sensing in terms of advantages,
    Rapid Feasibility Assessment of Energy Unit Integration in Distribution Networks
    Sicheng Gong and 2 more April 03, 2024 In contemporary heavy-load distribution
    networks, preceding feasibility assessment is imperative before incorporating
    additional energy units. However, the feasibility examination for massive combined
    operational scenarios of relevant units is computationally intensive with repetitive
    power flow calculations. To this end, this paper proposes a rapid assessment framework,
    the kernel of which is to learn from formerly examined scenarios, thus forming
    expansive feasible/infeasible regions to geometrically rule in/out subsequent
    scenarios. Without running the power flow computation in most scenarios, we accelerate
    the assessment process. Moreover, enlightened by heuristic hypersurface search,
    such prechecking efficiency can be further boosted. In a risk-averse manner, this
    framework can be conceptualized using the exact grid model. Especially, evidenced
    by testing on a 10.5kV distribution grid, the framework shows a significant assessment
    efficiency improvement and strict accuracy guarantee, where we observe at least
    76.13% assessment time reduction and zero accuracy loss in all testing cases.
    We anticipate this work to be a starting point for more sophisticated geometry-accelerating
    feasibility assessment methods. Improving Molecular De Novo Drug Design with Transformers
    Dhaval Soni and 7 more April 03, 2024 Drug design is undergoing a transformation
    as we challenge conventional methods by integrating state-of-the-art artificial
    intelligence with the intricate domain of molecular biology. At the heart of our
    endeavor lies a significant challenge: the scarcity of datasets containing active
    compounds for emerging target proteins. To confront this obstacle, we''re pioneering
    an innovative approach. We''re merging the advanced Generative Pre-trained Transformer
    (GPT) architecture with the nuanced capabilities of Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)
    networks, with the aim of generating Simplified Molecular Input Line Entry System
    (SMILES) strings to unveil novel therapeutic pathways. Additionally, we''re employing
    a Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT) pretraining strategy
    to enrich our model with comprehensive molecular data, including amino acid sequences
    and molecular SMILES datasets. Through meticulous fine-tuning on a meticulously
    curated protein-ligand complex dataset, we''re achieving precise conditional generation
    via autoregressive supervised learning. Our research introduces a groundbreaking
    method to assess molecular affinity, validated against established proteins, showcasing
    superior binding affinities compared to certain FDA-approved drugs in docking
    experiments. By pushing the boundaries of generative algorithms and establishing
    a robust framework for evaluating molecular affinity, we''re driving forward the
    field of de novo drug design, offering promising therapeutic avenues and enabling
    deeper exploration of the chemical landscape. Formalising a Gateway-based Blockchain
    Interoperability Solution with Event-B Guzmán Llambías and 2 more April 03, 2024
    A document by Guzman Llambias . Click on the document to view its contents. Magnetic
    Behavior of NO Fe-Si Sheets under Tensile and Compressive Stress Carlo Appino
    and 6 more April 03, 2024 The stress dependence of the magnetic properties of
    non-oriented Fe-Si steel sheets has been investigated by measurement and analysis
    of hysteresis loop, magnetization curve, and energy losses taken at different
    peak polarization values Jp (0.5 T – 1.5 T) between DC and f = 400 Hz. The salient
    feature of the material response to the stress lies in the monotonic deterioration
    of the soft magnetic properties, across the whole (Jp - f) domain, on passing
    from the maximum tensile stress (σ = +30 MPa) to the maximum compression (σ =
    -30 MPa). This is understood in terms of stress-induced redistribution of the
    domains between easy axes, making magnetic hardening by compression directly related
    to unfavorably directed domains and 90° domain-wallmediated magnetization transitions.
    The loss decomposition is carried out across the whole investigated frequency
    range, taking into account the skin effect at the highest frequencies. Quasi-static
    and dynamic losses follow a same trend with σ, both monotonically increasing on
    passing from the tensile to the compressive stress limits, according to the theoretically
    expected relationship existing between the hysteresis and the excess loss components.
    The latter is shown to identify the correlation regions where the magnetization
    is reversed of size comparable with the average grain size and loosely following
    the dependence of the loss figure on the applied stress. A bio-inspired hardware
    implementation of an analog spike-based hippocampus memory mo... Daniel Casanueva-Morato
    and 4 more April 03, 2024 The need for processing at the edge the increasing amount
    of data that is being produced by multitudes of sensors has led to the demand
    for mode power efficient computational systems, by exploring alternative computing
    paradigms and technologies. Neuromorphic engineering is a promising approach that
    can address this need by developing electronic systems that faithfully emulate
    the computational properties of animal brains. In particular, the hippocampus
    stands out as one of the most relevant brain region for implementing auto associative
    memories capable of learning large amounts of information quickly and recalling
    it efficiently. In this work, we present a computational spike-based memory model
    inspired by the hippocampus that takes advantage of the features of analog electronic
    circuits: energy efficiency, compactness, and real-time operation. This model
    can learn memories, recall them from a partial fragment and forget. It has been
    implemented as a Spiking Neural Networks directly on a mixed-signal neuromorphic
    chip. We describe the details of the hardware implementation and demonstrate its
    operation via a series of benchmark experiments, showing how this research prototype
    paves the way for the development of future robust and low-power mixed-signal
    neuromorphic processing systems. Exploratory Study of oneM2M-based Interoperability
    Architectures for IoT: A Smart Cit... VJS Pranavasri and 6 more April 03, 2024
    The advent of the Internet of Things (IoT) has ushered in transformative possibilities
    for smart cities, with the potential to revolutionize urban living through enhanced
    connectivity and data-driven decision-making. However, the effective realization
    of IoT in smart cities hinges upon the seamless interoperability of diverse devices
    and systems. To address this critical need, the oneM2M standards initiative has
    emerged as a foundational framework for IoT interoperability. In this research
    paper, we perform an exploratory analysis of three prominent open-source oneM2M
    based interoperability systems-Mobius, OM2M, and ACME. We leverage an existing
    large-scale system provided by our Smart City Living Lab deployed at IIIT Hyderabad,
    sprawling a 66-acre campus featuring over 370 nodes across eight verticals. We
    investigate the architectural characteristics of each solution, considering their
    strengths and limitations in facilitating IoT interoperability. Through this analysis,
    our paper aims to provide valuable insights for stakeholders seeking to implement
    IoT interoperability solutions in the context of smart cities. By evaluating the
    strengths and limitations of Mobius, OM2M, and ACME, we seek to offer guidance
    for selecting the most suitable solution. Our analysis reveals that the optimal
    framework choice depends on specific quality constraints: Mobius excels in performance,
    while ACME offers advantages in ease of setup for smaller-scale implementations.
    Comparing Concepts of Service Blocking Queues in Hardware-in-the-Loop Systems
    Tobias Konheiser and 3 more April 03, 2024 ZF is developing an autonomous driving
    system, which requires extensive testing of the developed devices and software
    on hardware-in-the-loop (HIL) systems. Therefore, a robust and high-performing
    HIL system is essential. The purpose of a HIL system is to replay recorded data
    to the device-undertest. Recordings are loaded, processed and streamed to the
    deviceunder-test with real-time requirements. This streaming chain includes processing
    nodes and queues. This requires careful management of queue configurations. An
    overflow in the queue will result in packet loss, while an underflow may violate
    the real-time constraint. This study aims to develop and evaluate concepts for
    service blocking queues. These concepts block or pause the incoming service to
    a queue when necessary to avoid queue overflows and associated data loss. However,
    an out-of-the-box solution is not available and different approaches affect the
    behaviour and performance of the system. Therefore, the developed concepts are
    evaluated against each other and against the existing system based on selected
    performance parameters in specific scenarios. The scenarios cover a wide range
    of situations, reflecting standard input data with varying numbers of parallel
    streams and bottleneck scenarios forcing queue overflows or blockages. The developed
    service blocking queue concepts eliminate data loss in all scenarios, but introduce
    overhead, resulting in reduced system performance. However, the service blocking
    queue concept using a modified token-bucket approach proved to be the best solution,
    as the elimination of data loss justifies the additional overhead. This concept
    is proposed for implementation and deployment on the HIL system. Generative AI-Based
    Text Generation Methods Using Pre-Trained GPT 2 Model Rohit Pandey and 7 more
    April 03, 2024 A text generation model is a machine learning model that uses neural
    networks, especially transformers architecture to generate contextually relevant
    text based on linguistic patterns learned from extensive corpora. The models are
    trained on a huge amount of textual data so that they can model and learn complex
    concepts of any language like its grammar, vocabulary, phrases, and styles. FlowDep
    - An efficient and optical-flow-based algorithm of obstacle detection for aut...
    Chen-Fu Yeh and 7 more April 03, 2024 Obstacle detection is crucial for the safety
    and efficiency of autonomous vehicles. For mini-vehicles such as palm-sized drones,
    it is a challenge to implement traditional methods like Lidar due to high costs
    and physical constraints. Vision-based deep learning approaches, while accurate,
    are too resource-intensive for the mini-vehicles. To address this issue, we introduce
    Flowdep, a novel optical-flow-based algorithm inspired by the low-resolution but
    efficient motion-detection mechanisms in insects. Flowdep combines optic flow
    and IMU (or positioning information) to estimate the depth of every image pixel.
    We also generate a variant of Flowdep using the artificial neural network (Flowdep-ANN).
    Our tests show that Flowdep and Flowdep-ANN are 5.8 to 114.7 times faster than
    the DNN networks we tested, while the accuracies of Flowdep and Flowdep-ANN are
    on par with these networks. We further tested Flowdep and Flowdep-ANN on a small
    autonomous vehicle with Raspberry Pi4 as the computing platform, and both models
    successfully performed real-time object detection. The present work demonstrates
    the potential of using optical flow as an efficient approach to estimate depth
    and detect obstacles in resource-constrained mini-vehicles. Misinformative Data
    Visualizations in the Sports Media Domain Drew Scott April 03, 2024 Sports are
    data-driven: individual performances are measured using statistics and teams leverage
    data analytics to outperform competition. Sports media-which is created by media
    outlets, teams, and individuals-engage its consumers by creating narratives about
    the sport, teams, and players. Due to the importance of data in the sports world,
    data visualizations are a pillar in the sports media landscape. These data visualizations,
    while appearing to accurately convey data to its consumers, can be misinformative;
    media creators often have incentives to present specific narratives which don''t
    always fit the data. This work contributes to an existing misinformative data
    visualization taxonomy. In doing so, it makes it easier to understand the techniques
    and design choices used to create misinformative visualizations in all domains,
    not only in sports media. A Survey of RFID Authentication Protocols Drew Scott
    April 03, 2024 "Radio frequency identification" (RFID) systems are ubiquitous
    in today''s world. In an RFID system, it is a desirable to attain mutual authentication
    between a reader and a tag before commencing application-level communications.
    This is because tags should not share secret information with unknown parties
    and readers need to defend against tag impersonation. Authentication protocols
    designed for communication between computers, however, are not appropriate for
    RFID systems because tags are extremely resource constrained (low energy, small
    memory, etc.). Thus, there have been many attempts to design secure and practical
    authentication protocols for RFID systems over the years since RFID systems became
    prevalent. This survey summarizes and compares these protocols. The Effect of
    Multipath in Distributed Arrays with Time Reversal Hassna Ouassal and 2 more April
    03, 2024 This article examines the effect of multipath channels on the performance
    of distributed arrays that employ time reversal. A model of the signal received
    from a distributed array is formulated, and a statistical analysis of the variation
    in signal power in the presence of phase noise and multipath is given. We present
    the impact these nonidealities have on received signal power, and we analyze the
    received power for three specific cases: continuous waveform, impulse waveform,
    and modulated rectangular pulse waveform in the presence of standard channel models.
    It is shown that for larger arrays in multipath channels, the change in power
    between coherent and incoherent states converges to the line-of-sight channel.
    It is further shown that in a line-of-sight channel time-reversal completely cancels
    unknown channel delays resulting in coherent signals from all nodes in a distributed
    array, while in a multipath channel only the main diagonal round-trip paths are
    coherent. Nevertheless, this additional benefit improves signal coherence in complex
    channels and can aide in distributed array synchronization using two-way time
    transfer. Disproof of Hodge Conjecture by Graph Theory Jihyeon Yoon April 02,
    2024 Hodge conjecture is turned out to be false in extension of graph theory based
    on its algebraic attribute. Hash3D: Training-free Acceleration for 3D Generation
    Xingyi Yang and 1 more April 02, 2024 The evolution of 3D generative modeling
    has been notably propelled by the adoption of 2D diffusion models. Despite this
    progress, the cumbersome optimization process per se presents a critical hurdle
    to efficiency. In this paper, we introduce Hash3D, a universal acceleration for
    3D generation without model training. Central to Hash3D is the insight that feature-map
    redundancy is prevalent in images rendered from camera positions and diffusion
    time-steps in close proximity. By effectively hashing and reusing these feature
    maps across neighboring timesteps and camera angles, Hash3D substantially prevents
    redundant calculations, thus accelerating the diffusion model''s inference in
    3D generation tasks. We achieve this through an adaptive grid-based hashing. Surprisingly,
    this feature-sharing mechanism not only speed up the generation but also enhances
    the smoothness and view consistency of the synthesized 3D objects. Our experiments
    covering 5 textto-3D and 3 image-to-3D models, demonstrate Hash3D''s versatility
    to speed up optimization, enhancing efficiency by 1.3 ∼ 4×. Additionally, Hash3D''s
    integration with 3D Gaussian splatting largely speeds up 3D model creation, reducing
    text-to-3D processing to about 10 minutes and image-to-3D conversion to roughly
    30 seconds. The code is provided in https://github.com/Adamdad/hash3D. Area and
    Power Efficient Implementation of Configurable Ring Oscillator PUF Enas Abulibdeh
    and 4 more April 02, 2024 Physically Unclonable Function (PUF) is an emerging
    hardware security primitive that provides a promising solution for lightweight
    security. PUFs can be used to generate a secret key that depends on the random
    manufacturing process variation of the device for lightweight authentication and
    device identification. This work proposes an optimized version of the Configurable
    Ring Oscillator (CRO) PUF that aims to reduce power consumption and area overhead.
    The proposed design eliminates the duplication of ROs, reduces the switching activity,
    and introduces the inter-stage delay as an additional source of randomness. The
    proposed PUF has been implemented in 22nm FDSOI technology using the Synopsys
    tools. A comprehensive security analysis has been acquired utilizing Challenge-Response
    Pairs collected from 8 chips. Results show an average of 49.42%, 38.25%, 9.95%,
    and 45.5% for uniformity, diffuseness, reliability, and uniqueness, respectively.
    Compared with the state-of-the-art, the proposed design achieves an area and power
    reduction of 75% and 65.1%, respectively. With the proposed PUF delivering 10
    32 CRPs, it is classified as a strong PUF. Additionally, the proposed design passes
    NIST tests and achieves an average prediction accuracy of 67.1% of machine learning
    modeling. A Hero Or A Killer? Overview Of Opportunities, Challenges, And Implications

    \ productivity. Extra irrigation water is applied to leach\ndown the salts from\

    Article\nTech\nScience Press\n1 Introduction\nSoil salinity is the accumulation\
    \ of salts in soil due to the natural material of soil or due to poor\nagronomic\
    \ practices [1]. This soil salinity is a serious threat to sustainable agriculture\
    \ development [2].\nTo deal with the issue of soil salinity, extra irrigation\
    \ water is applied to leach down the salts from the\nroot zone of the plants.\
    \ Leaching is the process of application of irrigation water to percolate down\
    \ the\nsalts from the root zone of the plants. LF is the ratio of irrigation water\
    \ required to leach down the salts\nto a speciﬁc level of soil salinity. The application\
    \ of irrigation water for leaching purposes without\ncalibration according to\
    \ environmental conditions usually fails to reduce soil salinity effectively [3].\n\
    To effectively achieve the objective of leaching, the irrigation water used for\
    \ leaching purposes must be\nadjusted to environmental conditions and salinity\
    \ levels. To adjust the LF according to the environmental\nconditions the LF is\
    \ adjusted with the Evapotranspiration (ET) rate. ET rate is the measure of water\
    \ loss\nfrom the soil and plant surface in the form of evaporation and transpiration,\
    \ collectively called ET [4].\nReference Evapotranspiration (ETo) is used to model\
    \ the ET rate of a model crop. ETo is the standard ET\nof the grass crop [5].\
    \ The ET of the model crop (grass) is called Reference ETo. The ETo rate is heavily\n\
    affected by the temperature, humidity, wind speed, and sunshine duration. The\
    \ ET rate increases with\ntemperature and decreases with an increase in humidity\
    \ [6].\nET is affected by environmental conditions with a severe impact on LF\
    \ to be available for an effective\nleaching process. Irrigation must be adjusted\
    \ with the ET rate to ensure the LF of irrigation water is available\nunder prevailing\
    \ environmental conditions. Many methods of ETo rate determination are recommended.\n\
    Most important are Blaney Criddle, Penman Montieth method, and Pan Evaporation\
    \ method [7].\nThese methods required a lot of parameters that make them difﬁcult\
    \ to apply at the farmer level. LF of\nirrigation water applications without adjustment\
    \ to the prevailing conditions usually fails to achieve the\nobjective of leaching\
    \ in saline soils. Leaching is applied without any calibration according to the\
    \ salinity\nlevel and environmental conditions. Leaching irrigation water needs\
    \ to be calibrated according to the\nenvironmental context, to successfully reduce\
    \ the soil salinity by the leaching process. The failure in the\nleaching process\
    \ results in loss to the farmers. LF is the fraction of total irrigation water\
    \ required to\nreduce soil salinity from a certain salinity level to the desired\
    \ salinity level.\nMachine learning has revolutionized the world by transforming\
    \ all spheres of life including healthcare,\nagriculture, transport, entertainment,\
    \ and business. ML is also applied in agriculture to deal with different\nproblems\
    \ in agriculture. Many ML-based solutions were proposed to determine the ET rate\
    \ from limited\nenvironmental conditions. Determination of LF from ML-based ETo\
    \ rate is not previously targeted. To\ndetermine the LF from limited environmental\
    \ conditions the ML model is proposed to determine the\ncalibrated Evapotranspiration\
    \ (ETc) from the prevailing temperature, humidity, and sunshine duration. To\n\
    train and validate the Model the Blaney Criddle Method of ET rate determination\
    \ is used. Many smart\nirrigation water solutions were proposed in recent years\
    \ for the conservation of irrigation water. Most of\nthe proposed solutions were\
    \ limited to sensing soil moisture conditions and recommendations for the\nirrigation\
    \ water accordingly. Very few smart irrigation water solutions follow Food and\
    \ agriculture\norganization (FAO) recommended method of ET for the determination\
    \ of irrigation water requirements [8].\n1.1 Signiﬁcance of Study\nSoil salinity\
    \ has a profound impact on the socio-economic life of people. Soil salinity has\
    \ seriously\naffected more than 831 million hectares of land, across the world\
    \ [9]. Soil is a non-renewable resource\nthat is very important to feed the ever-increasing\
    \ population. Every sphere of knowledge should focus to\nreclaim the saline soil.\
    \ Soil salinity is a signiﬁcant environmental hazard that affects crop yield and\n\
    production. Soil Salinity is the primary source of reduction in crop yield and\
    \ source of barren soil [10]. A\nhigh concentration of salt affects the plant’s\
    \ ability to uptake the water [11].\n1916\nIASC, 2023, vol.36, no.2\nDue to progressive\
    \ human-induced salinization, the soil at an alarming rate has become unsuitable\
    \ for\nagricultural and infrastructure developments [12]. Poor agriculture practices\
    \ are the primary reason for\nhuman-induced soil salinity. Salinity is a severe\
    \ problem in irrigated areas and results in considerable loss\nto the value of\
    \ production [13]. Soil salinity is an issue in more than seventy countries. Soil\
    \ salinity cause\n1%–2% of land degradation per year. Around 20% of irrigated\
    \ land is affected by soil salinity [14].\nSoil salinity is the major problem\
    \ in arid regions that causes severe economic losses to the farmers. The\nsoil\
    \ salinity is very toxic to plants. Most of the plants cannot survive in saline\
    \ culture. The salts uptake by\nthe plants interferes with the normal physiology\
    \ of the plants. The toxicity of salinity results in the death of\nthe plants\
    \ which causes severe loss to the farmers. To feed the ever-increasing human population.\
    \ Every\nsphere of knowledge must contribute to dealing with issues. The proposed\
    \ solution intends to improve\nthe effectiveness of the leaching process to reduce\
    \ soil salinity. The reclamation of saline soils for\nagriculture purposes by\
    \ effective leaching would save the most precious resource.\n1.2 Contribution\n\
    The major contribution of the work is the determination of the LF of irrigation\
    \ water to deal with the\nissue of soil salinity efﬁciently and effectively. The\
    \ proposed solution optimizes the use of irrigation\nwater for leaching purposes\
    \ according to environmental conditions (temperature, humidity, wind speed)\n\
    that were not previously targeted. The relationship between environmental conditions\
    \ and ET is diverse.\nSome conditions tend to increase the ET, and some decrease\
    \ the ET rate. The combined effect of all the\nenvironmental conditions is hard\
    \ to determine from the linear model. Therefore, ML-assisted ETo rate is\ndetermined\
    \ to optimize the LF according to the environmental conditions. LF determination\
    \ from limited\nenvironmental conditions aims to support sustainable developments\
    \ in agriculture.\n1.3 Data-Driven Machine Learning Model\nA data-driven machine\
    \ learning model is applied to make decisions for the smart LF of irrigation water.\n\
    The proposed solution is ideal for dealing with the issue of soil salinity while\
    \ conservation of irrigation water,\nto support sustainable developments in agriculture.\
    \ The proposed solution aims to effectively deal with the\nissue of soil salinity\
    \ by smart leaching of irrigation water. Smart leaching fraction of irrigation\
    \ water\napplication according to the prevailing, temperature, humidity, wind\
    \ speed, and sunshine duration can\neffectively deal with the issue of soil salinity\
    \ in irrigated areas.\n2 Literature Review\nThe literature review is performed\
    \ to ﬁnd relevant work, from major bibliographic indices. Many\nsolutions regarding\
    \ smart irrigation have emerged in recent years. Hellin et al. presented an automated\n\

    \ irrigation water recommendation. Talavera et al. [39] explored\nthe IoT application\
    \ in agriculture. Naqvi et al. recommended IoT-based irrigation management\napplications\
    \ to conserve irrigation water [40]. The study in [41] proposed leaching estimation\
    \ in saline\nsoil with temperature conditions of an area. Wang et al. [42] evaluate\
    \ the remote sensing, machine\nlearning and Land surface model (LSM) based approaches\
    \ where results indicate that ensemble means of\nglobal terrestrial ET rates are\
    \ similar in all the approaches.\nNiaghi et al. [43] proposed ML-based ETo, estimation\
    \ in humid conditions due to the non-linear\ncharacteristics of the ETo determination.\
    \ The ML models [44] are compared in terms of RMSE, MAE,\nScattered index (SI),\
    \ and Co-relation coefﬁcient. It is observed that the RF model is more accurate\
    \ in ETo\nestimation with radiation as input. Faramiñan et al. [45] proposed daily\
    \ actual Evapotranspiration (ETa) of\nbarley crops by the development of the linear\
    \ generalized model, developed from meteorological conditions.\nLópez et al. [46]\
    \ proposed ETo estimation with soil moisture conditions using the regression model.\
    \ The\nproposed solution determines the crop potential Evapotranspiration (ETc)\
    \ of Kikuyu grass. The Eto by\nproposed solution is compared against the Penman\
    \ Montieth method. The model achieved a coefﬁcient of\ndetermination of 0.9936,\
    \ with RMSE 0.183 mm day−1. Allen et al. [47] recommended weather data\nconditioning\
    \ to deal with the problem of overstated ETo to adjust biases in ordinary conditions,\
    \ especially\nin arid conditions.\nMartínez et al. [48] evaluated the performance\
    \ of Remote sensing (RS) based ETo estimation at low\naltitudes. The study evaluated\
    \ the performance of MODIS ET (MOD16), Global land evaporation\namsterdam model\
    \ (GLEAM) ET, and Atmosphere-land exchange inverse (ALEXI) ET. Petkovic et al.\n\
    [49] recommended a regression model of ETo determination from several weather\
    \ conditions. Wang et al.\n[50] proposed radiation-based ETo estimation from RS\
    \ data considering the complex terrain. The\nimplementation of the proposed result\
    \ yields that R2 is 0.84 and 0.86 at two different locations with\n0.59 and 0.82\
    \ RMSE respectively.\nMa et al., [51] suggested an ET estimation framework from\
    \ high-resolution RS data from\nSentinel-2 satellite data. The coefﬁcient of determination\
    \ of the proposed solution is from 0.870 to\n0.912 mm day−1. The coefﬁcient of\
    \ determination of the proposed solution is from 0.870 to 0.912 mm day−1.\nMany\
    \ ML-assisted solutions were proposed to determine the ETc rate from prevailing\
    \ environmental\nconditions. Recommendation of LF based on ET rate from limited\
    \ environmental conditions is not\npreviously targeted. The proposed solution\

    used to determine the fraction of total irrigation water that is required to reduce\
    \ salinity up to the target\nlevel of soil salinity. LF and ETc are used to determine\
    \ the irrigation water requirements according to the\ntemperature, humidity, wind\

    \ of Proposed Method\nThe proposed solution determines the ETo from the temperature\
    \ and day length of an area using the\nBlaney Criddle method of ET. Blaney Criddle\
    \ is a theoretical measure of ET rate and ignores the impact\nof humidity, sunshine,\
    \ and wind speed. ML model is used to determine calibrated ETc rate according\
    \ to\nhumidity, sunshine, and wind speed. ETc and LF are used to determine the\
    \ total irrigation Water\nrequirements (WR).\n3.1.1 Blaney Criddle Method of Reference\
    \ Evapotranspiration (Et0)\nETo is the ET rate of reference crop in millimeters\
    \ in one day (mm day−1). It is obtained by using the\nBlaney-Criddle method, by\

    percentage of daytime in hours.\nETo ¼ p 0:46 \x02 Tmean þ 8\nð\nÞ\n(1)\nThe daytime\

    Tmin is obtained by Eq. (4), where ‘n’ is the number of days and Tn is the minimum\

    3.1.2 Leaching Fraction (LF)\nThe LF is the fraction of irrigation water required\
    \ to control salinity within the crop tolerance level. LF of\nirrigation water\
    \ is determined according to the soil salinity, irrigation water salinity, and\
    \ crop tolerance The\nLF is expressed by Eq. (1), where ‘ECw’ is the irrigation\
    \ water salinity level in dSm−1, and ‘ECe’ is the\nsalinity tolerance level of\
    \ the crop. ‘ECe for the grass crop at one-hundredth percent (100%) of yield\n\

    \ and sunshine duration. The objective of the ML model is to effectively adjust\
    \ the ET0\naccording to humidity, wind speed, and sunshine duration ratio.\nThe\
    \ dataset for the ML is obtained by conditions shown in Fig. 2 and by the Blaney\
    \ Criddle method. Each\nline shows the ETc according to the humidity, wind speed,\
    \ and sunshine. The ETc is calibrated according to\nthese conditions. The ideal\
    \ outcome of the model would be the minimum amount of irrigation water that\n\
    serves the irrigation water requirements for LF to be successfully available.\
    \ The success matric in this\nregard would be the smart calibrated irrigation\

    \ is developed using multiple regression. The regression model is used due to\
    \ the existence\nof the linear relationship between environmental conditions,\
    \ ETc. The training of the model is done with\nmore than one hundred thousand\
    \ records. Eighty percent (80%) of the data set is used for the training of\n\
    the model and twenty percent (20%) for the test data set.\nThe objective of the\
    \ model is to directly predict the ETc from the direct values of humidity, wind\
    \ speed,\nand sunshine duration. Fig. 3, shows the distribution of the data of\
    \ ETc in the test data set.\n3.1.3 Machine Learning (ML) Model\n4 Results and\
    \ Discussion\nThis section intends to evaluate the proposed method of smart LF\
    \ of irrigation water with different\nprospects. Initially, the performance of\
    \ the ML model is made with different types of evaluations. The\nperformance of\
    \ smart LF of Irrigation water is compared against the traditional method of LF\
    \ of\nIrrigation water.\n4.1 Performance of Machine Learning Model\nThe proposed\
    \ ML model predicts the ETc from the humidity, wind speed, and sunshine as the\
    \ input to the\nmodel. The performance of the model is observed in terms of the\
    \ accuracy of the model to determine the\ncalibrated ETc. The ETc predicted by\
    \ the proposed solution is compared against the Blaney Criddle of ET\nFigure 3:\

    \ determination to ﬁnd the difference in prediction. The difference in predicted\
    \ and actual ET values from\nthe test data set is shown in Fig. 4.\nFor the different\
    \ levels of ETo, the difference in calibrated ET (ETc) is shown in Fig. 4. For\
    \ each case, the\ndifference is very low. The maximum difference is 2 mm day−1\
    \ and the minimum difference is 0.2 mm day−1\nfor all observed ETc values. For\
    \ most of the observed values, the difference is less than 1 mm day−1. The\ndifference\
    \ in calibrated ET (ETc) is low against each set of ETo.\nThe performance of the\
    \ ML model is observed in terms of mean absolute errors (MAE), Mean squared\n\
    errors (MSE), and Root means squared errors (RMSE). The MSE is the average of\
    \ the Squared Errors. MSE\nis the average of the square of the difference between\
    \ the predicted values and actual values. MSE is\nexpressed by Eq. (8), where\
    \ ‘n’ is the number of observations. It is the measure of the distance of points\n\
    from the regression line.\nMSE ¼ 1\nn\nX\nðActual \x03 PredictedÞ2\n(8)\nRoot\

    \ which reﬂects the accuracy of the model in making Etc prediction. The test data\n\
    statistics show that the ML model is accurate in the prediction of ETc against\
    \ the prevailing\nenvironmental conditions. The proposed model can be used with\
    \ accuracy and conﬁdence in the\nestimation of irrigation water requirements from\
    \ the LF, ETc.\n4.2 Field Effectiveness of Smart Leaching\nThe effectiveness of\
    \ the proposed smart LF of irrigation water is also observed by the application\
    \ of the\nproposed solution in a real-time environment. The effectiveness of the\
    \ proposed solution is compared to the\ntraditional leaching process. To implement\
    \ and compare the performance of both leaching processes is\napplied in two adjacent\
    \ areas with similar soil salinity levels. In the experiment area, the leaching\
    \ process\nis applied according to the proposed solution while in the control\
    \ area the leaching process is applied by\nthe traditional process. In both areas,\
    \ the salinity level is observed before and after leaching water application.\n\
    The salinity is observed before and after the application of leaching irrigation\
    \ water in both areas. In both\nareas, salinity is observed at sixty-four sampling\
    \ points for soil salinity in terms of electric conductivity (EC).\nThe impacts\
    \ of leaching by the smart and traditional methods are analyzed in terms of average\
    \ soil salinity\nECav. The average soil salinity (ECav) is determined by Eq. (11),\
    \ where ‘n = 64’ is the total number of sample\npoints, ‘i’ is the sample point\
    \ number, and ‘EC’ is the EC value at the sampling point. The targeting tolerance\n\
    level is set for the cotton crop that is 8.7 dSm−1 or below.\nECav ¼\nXn\ni¼1\
    \ ECi\n(11)\n4.2.1 Salinity Distribution Before Leaching\nInitially, the soil\
    \ salinity is observed in both the control and experiment areas before the application\
    \ of\nirrigation water for leaching purposes.\nIn Fig. 5, the salinity distribution\
    \ of both experiment and control areas is plotted before the application of\n\
    irrigation water for leaching purposes. Before the leaching process, the ECav\
    \ in the control area was\n12.67 dSm−1, and in the experiment, the area was 12.93\
    \ dSm−1. In both areas, salinity at all the sixty-four\n(64) sample points was\
    \ higher than the tolerance level of the selected crop which is 8.7 dSm−1. Both\n\
    areas have similar ECav, and at all the sample points the salinity is above the\
    \ tolerance level of the crop\nas given in Table 3.\n4.2.2 Salinity Distribution\
    \ After Leaching\nThe WRe are determined based on ETc and LF. The smart calibrations\
    \ in ETc are made based on crop\nﬁeld environment conditions. The WRe is determined\
    \ by predicted ETc of 5.3 mm day−1. With irrigation\nwater salinity of 5 dSm−1\
    \ and a targeted level of soil salinity of 8.7 dSm−1, the required LF is\nTable\

    \ With ETc of 5.3 mm day−1, the total requirements of irrigation water would be\n\
    6.23 mm day−1, with LF of 0.13. While in the control area the WRc, is applied\
    \ with the traditional\nmethod by applying Eq. (7).\nSoil salinity distribution\
    \ is compared in both the control and experiment area after leaching application.\n\
    Salinity distribution after the application of WRe and WRc in the control and\
    \ experiment area is shown in\nFig. 5. Salinity distribution in the experiment\
    \ and control area is given in Table 4.\nFigure 5: Soil salinity distribution\

    \ ECav is 7.07 dSm−1, and in the control, the area is 8.7 dSm−1. In the control\n\
    area at thirty-ﬁve (35) sample points, soil salinity is more than the targeted\
    \ level of soil salinity. In the\nexperiment area at fourteen (14) sample points,\
    \ the salinity is more than the targeted level (8.7) dSm−1 of\nsoil salinity.\
    \ The proposed smart leaching is more effective in reducing the ECav and at a\
    \ greater number\nof sample points as compared to the traditional approach applied\
    \ in the control area.\n4.3 Discussion\nThe effectiveness of the proposed solution\
    \ is observed in terms of the accuracy of the ML model and the\neffectiveness\
    \ of the proposed solution in the reduction of soil salinity. The ML model is\
    \ accurate in the\nprediction of calibrated ETc with lower MAE, RMSE, and MSE.\
    \ Salinity is observed in the control and\nexperiment areas before and after the\
    \ application of leaching by the proposed solution and by the\ntraditional method\
    \ in the experiment and control areas respectively. Salinity distributions before\
    \ and after\nleaching irrigation water applications in control and experiment\
    \ areas are shown in Fig. 6, and the results\nare summarized in Table 5.\nFigure\
    \ 6: Salinity comparisons\n1926\nIASC, 2023, vol.36, no.2\nECav in the control\
    \ area is reduced from 12.78 to 8.7 dSm−1, after the application of leaching by\
    \ the\ntraditional method. In the experiment area, ECav is reduced from 12.93\
    \ to 7.07 dSm−1, with the\napplication of smart LF of irrigation water. Smart\
    \ leaching is more effective in the experiment area as\ncompared to the traditional\
    \ leaching process applied in the control area. The number of sample points\n\
    with salinity level, more than the targeted level of soil salinity, was reduced\
    \ from sixty-four (64) to thirty-\nﬁve (35), in the control area, and from sixty-four\
    \ (64) to fourteen (14) sample points in the experiment\narea. The smart LF application\
    \ in the experiment area is more successful in reducing salinity as compared\n\
    to the traditional method in the control area.\nThe performance of smart LF against\
    \ the traditional methods in terms of average salinity, and the\nnumber of points\
    \ above the target level reveals the success of smart LF of irrigation water against\
    \ the\ntraditional method. The smart LF of irrigation water is more effective\
    \ in reducing the soil salinity as\ncompared to the traditional leaching process.\
    \ The proposed solution adjusts the irrigation water according\nto the prevailing\
    \ temperature, humidity, and sunshine duration to recommend LF irrigation water\
    \ that is\nmore effective in reducing the soil salinity as compared to the traditional\
    \ leaching process. Fig. 6 shows\nthe distribution of the soil salinity in the\
    \ experiment and control area before and after the application of\nthe leaching\
    \ process. From Fig. 6 it is observed that the proposed solution is more effective\
    \ in reducing\nthe soil salinity at more points as compared to the traditional\
    \ leaching process.\n5 Conclusion\nSoil salinity is a soil degradation process\
    \ that is a serious hazard to sustainable development in\nagriculture. Application\
    \ of smart leaching by calibrated Evapotranspiration (ETc) is proposed for the\n\
    Leaching Fraction (LF) of irrigation water to be more effective. Smart LF of irrigation\
    \ water is proposed\nand implemented in a real-time environment. The ML model\
    \ is proposed to adjust in Evapotranspiration\nrate according to humidity, sunshine,\
    \ and wind speed to determine the ETc rate. The proposed ML model\nis accurate\
    \ to predict the ETc to determine the smart LF of irrigation water. The LF of\
    \ irrigation water is\ndetermined according to ETc, soil salinity level, irrigation\
    \ water salinity level, and crop tolerance level.\nThe ﬁeld evaluation of the\
    \ proposed solution of the smart LF reveals that the proposed solution is more\n\
    effective in reducing the soil salinity in terms of average soil salinity and\
    \ at a greater number of points.\nFor future work, the proposed solution needs\
    \ to be tested against different ML algorithms for a more\naccurate prediction\
    \ of ETc. The proposed solution is based on the Blaney Criddle method of ETo rate\n\
    determination. It needs to be tested against the Penman Montieth method and Pan\
    \ Evaporation-based ETo\ndetermination.\nAcknowledgement: The authors, therefore,\

    Abstract: Smart farming is a development that has emphasized information and communication

    technology used in machinery, equipment, and sensors in network-based hi-tech
    farm supervision

    cycles. Innovative technologies, the Internet of Things (IoT), and cloud computing
    are anticipated

    to inspire growth and initiate the use of robots and artiﬁcial intelligence in
    farming. Such ground-

    breaking deviations are unsettling current agriculture approaches, while also
    presenting a range of

    challenges. This paper investigates the tools and equipment used in applications
    of wireless sensors

    in IoT agriculture, and the anticipated challenges faced when merging technology
    with conventional

    farming activities. Furthermore, this technical knowledge is helpful to growers
    during crop periods

    from sowing to harvest; and applications in both packing and transport are also
    investigated.

    1. Introduction

    Sustainable agriculture is a measure of the endurance and sustenance of food grains

    produced in an eco-friendly manner [1]. Sustainable agriculture helps in the encourage-

    ment of farming practices and approaches to help sustain farmers and resources.
    It is

    economically feasible and maintains soil quality, reduces soil degradation, saves
    water

    resources, improves land biodiversity, and ensures a natural and healthy environment
    [2].

    Sustainable agriculture plays a signiﬁcant role in preserving natural resources,
    halting

    biodiversity loss, and reducing greenhouse gas emissions [3].

    Sustainable agriculture farming is a method of preserving nature without compromis-

    ing the future generation’s basic needs, whilst also improving the effectiveness
    of farming.

    The basic accomplishments of smart farming in terms of sustainable agriculture
    are crop ro-

    tation, the control of nutrient deﬁciency in crops, the control of pests and diseases,
    recycling,

    and water harvesting, leading to an overall safer environment. Living organisms
    depend

    on the nature of biodiversity, and are contaminated by waste emissions, the use
    of fertilizers

    and pesticides, degraded dead plants, etc. The emission of greenhouse gases affects
    plants,

    animals, humans, and the environment; hence, it necessitates a better environment
    for

    living things [4] (Figure 1).

    Agriculture is the largest contributor in India, with an 18% gross domestic product

    involving approximately 57% of people in rural areas. Over the years, although
    India’s

    total agronomic output has increased, the number of growers has fallen from 71.9%
    in 1951

    to 45.1% in 2011 [5]. The Economic Survey 2018 revealed that the number of agricultural

    workers in the total workforce will drop to 25.7% in 2050. In rural areas, farming
    families

    gradually lose the next generation of farmers, overwhelmed by higher costs of
    cultivation,

    low per capita productivity, inadequate soil maintenance, and migrations to a
    non-farming

    or higher remunerative occupation. Presently, the world is on the verge of a digital

    revolution, and so it is the appropriate time to connect the agricultural landform
    with

    wireless technology to introduce and accommodate digital connectivity with farmers.

    Figure 1. Factors of sustainable agriculture.

    Regrettably, not all parts of the Earth’s surface are suitable for agriculture
    due to

    various restrictions, such as: soil quality, topography, temperature, climate,
    and most

    relevant cultivable areas are also not homogenous [6]. Further, existing farming
    land is

    fragmented by political and ﬁscal features, and rapid urbanization, which consistently

    increases pressure on arable land availability (Figure 2). Recently, total agricultural
    land

    used for food production has declined [7]. Furthermore, every crop ﬁeld has different

    critical characteristics, such as soil type, ﬂow of irrigation, presence of nutrients,
    and pest

    resistance, which are all measured separately both in quality and quantity regarding
    a

    speciﬁc crop. Both spatial and temporal differences are necessary for optimizing
    crop

    production in the same ﬁeld by crop rotation and an annual crop growth development

    cycle [8].

    Figure 2. Key issues of technology in the agriculture industry.

    In most cases, variations in characteristics occur within a single crop, or the
    same

    crop is grown on the whole farm and requires site-speciﬁc analyses for optimum
    yield

    production. New technology-based approaches are needed to produce more from less
    land,

    and to address these various issues. In traditional farming practices, farmers
    frequently

    Agriculture 2022, 12, 1745

    3 of 26

    visit their ﬁelds throughout the crop’s life in routine farming activities to
    better understand

    the crop conditions [9]. The current sensor and communication technologies offer
    an precise

    view of the ﬁeld, from which farmers can detect ongoing ﬁeld activities without
    being in

    the ﬁeld in person. Wireless sensors monitor the crops with higher accuracy and
    detect

    issues at early stages, often facilitating the use of smart tools from initial
    sowing to the

    harvest of crops [10].

    The timely use of sensors has made the entire farming operation smart and cost-

    effective, due to precise monitoring. The various autonomous harvesters, robotic
    weeders,

    and drones have sensors attached to collect data over short intervals. However,
    the vastness

    of agriculture puts extreme demands on technological solutions for sustainability
    with

    minimum ecological impact. Sensor technology through wireless communication helps

    farmers to know the various needs and requirements of crops without being in the
    ﬁelds,

    and they are then able to take remote action [11].

    2. Smart Farming

    Historically, ancient agriculture practices were related to the production of
    food in

    cultivated lands for the survival of humans and the breeding of animals [12],
    and was

    called the traditional agricultural era 1.0. This mainly resorted to using manpower
    and

    animals. Simple tools were used for farming activities, such as sickles and shovels.
    Work

    was mainly conducted through manual labor, and subsequently, productivity continued
    at

    a low level (Figure 3).

    Figure 3. Agricultural decision support system framework.

    During the 19th Century, new types of machinery appeared in the agricultural indus-

    tries, in the form of steam engines. The wide use of agricultural machinery and
    abundant

    chemicals by farmers signaled the start of the agricultural era 2.0, and outwardly
    improved

    effectiveness and productivity of farmers and farms. However, considerably harmful
    impli-

    cations, such as chemical pollution, environmental devastation, waste of natural
    resources,

    and excess utilization of energy, simultaneously developed.

    The agricultural era 3.0 emerged during the 20th Century, due to the rapid growth
    of

    computation and electronics. Robotic techniques, programed agricultural machinery,
    and

    other technologies enhanced the agricultural processes efﬁciently. The issues
    that had arisen

    during agricultural era 2.0 were solved, and policies were readapted to the agricultural
    era

    Agriculture 2022, 12, 1745

    4 of 26

    3.0 through work distribution, precise irrigation, the reduced use of chemicals,
    site-speciﬁc

    nutrient application, and efﬁcient pest control technologies, etc.

    The next agricultural era is also the current iteration of agriculture, the agricultural

    era 4.0, involving the engagement of recent technologies, such as the Internet
    of Things, big

    data analysis, artiﬁcial intelligence, cloud computing and remote sensing, etc.
    The adop-

    tion of new technologies has signiﬁcantly improved agricultural activities by
    developing

    low-cost sensor and network platforms, aimed towards the optimization of production

    efﬁciency, along with reductions in the usage of water resources and energy with
    minimum

    environmental effects [13]. Big data in smart farming provides extrapolative overviews
    of

    real-time agricultural situations, allowing farmers to make effective decisions
    [14]. Real-

    time programming is developed with artiﬁcial intelligence concepts and embedded
    in IoT

    devices, helping farmers make the most suitable decisions [15].

    Smart farming promotes precision agriculture with modern, sophisticated technology

    and enables farmers to remotely monitor the plants. Smart farming helps agricultural
    pro-

    cesses, such as harvesting and crop yields, as the automation of sensors and machinery
    has

    made the farming workforce more efﬁcient [16]. The technologies convert traditional
    farm-

    ing methods to automatic devices, causing a technological revolution in agriculture.
    Today,

    the technology in agriculture has altered the way farming is conducted, and conventional

    techniques have been transformed by the Internet of Things [17].

    In terms of optimizing farm labor requirements and increasing the quantity and

    quality of products, smart farming is an emerging modern technique implemented
    with

    information and communication technologies (ICT) [16]. Modern ICT technologies,
    such

    as the Internet of Things, GPS (Global Positioning Systems), sensors, robotics,
    drones,

    precision equipment, actuators, and data analytics, are used to identify the farmers’
    needs

    and select suitable solutions to their problems. These innovations increase the
    accuracy

    and timeliness of decisions taken, and improve crop productivity. Several multilateral

    organizations and developing countries around the world have proposed smart farming

    technologies to increase agricultural output [18].

    Sensors are constantly monitoring crops with greater accuracy, detecting any undesir-

    able conditions during the early stages of the crop’s lifecycle. Current farming
    incorporates

    smart tools from crop sowing to harvest, storing, and conveyance. The appropriate
    use of a

    wide variety of sensors has made the entire operation both more efﬁcient and proﬁtable,

    due to its accurate monitoring competencies. In addition, sensors that collect
    data quickly

    are directly available online for further evaluation, and they provide crop and
    site-speciﬁc

    agriculture for every site.

    The many issues related to crop production are addressed by smart agriculture
    and

    monitoring, particularly regarding changes in soil characteristics, climate factors,
    soil mois-

    ture, etc., to improve the spatial management practices that increase crop production
    and

    avoid the excess use of fertilizers and pesticides [19]. The ANN models in smart
    irrigation

    water management (SIWM) regulate irrigation scheduling support systems (DSS) and
    offer

    data on irrigation efﬁciency, water productivity index, and irrigation water demand
    and

    supply on a real-time basis. Climate-smart agriculture (CSA) is an upcoming technology,

    especially in developing countries, due to its potential to improve food security,
    farm

    system resilience, and lower greenhouse gas emissions [20]. Smart agriculture
    technology

    based on IoT technologies has many advantages in all agricultural processes and
    practices

    in real-time, including irrigation, plant protection, improving product quality,
    fertilization,

    disease prediction, etc. [21]. The beneﬁt of smart agriculture lies in its collection
    of real-time

    data on crops, the precise assessment of soil and crops, remote monitoring by
    farmers,

    supervising water and other natural resources, and improving livestock and agricultural

    production. Therefore, smart agriculture is considered to be the progression of
    precision

    agriculture through modernization and smart methods to attain various information
    of

    farm activities that are then remotely managed, and reinforced by suitable alternative

    real-time farm maintenance solutions.

    3. Internet of Things

    The Internet of Things (IoT) is a new technology that allows devices to connect

    remotely to achieve smart farming [22]. The IoT has begun to inﬂuence a vast range

    of industries, from health, trade, communications, energy and agriculture, to
    enhance

    efﬁciency and performance across all markets [23–25].

    Current applications provide information on the IoT’s effects, and its practices
    that are

    yet to be observed. However, by considering the advancement of technologies, one
    can

    envisage the IoT technologies perform a crucial role in numerous activities of
    farming, such

    as the utilization of communication infrastructure, data acquisition, smart objects,
    sensors,

    mobile devices, cloud-based intelligent information, decision-making, and the
    automation

    of agricultural operations (Figure 4).

    Figure 4. Barriers in the implementation of smart agriculture technology.

    The IoT technology monitors plants and animals and remotely retrieves information

    from mobile phones and devices. Sensors and instruments empower farmers to assess

    the weather and to anticipate production levels. The IoT plays a role in water
    harvesting,

    monitoring and controlling the ﬂow amount, assessing crops’ water requirements,
    time of

    supply, and the saving of water, more than ever before [26]. Sensors and cloud
    connectivity

    through the gateway can remotely monitor the status and water supply based on
    soil

    and plant needs [27]. To correct nutrient deﬁciencies, pests, and diseases, farmers
    cannot

    monitor and observe every plant manually, but IoT technology is still beneﬁcial
    and has

    led farmers to a new milestone in modern agriculture [28].

    Recently, the development of IoT technologies has played a major role throughout
    the

    farming sector, particularly through its communication infrastructure. This has
    included

    connecting smart objects, remote data acquisition, using vehicles and sensors
    through

    mobile devices and the internet, cloud-based intelligent analysis, interfacing,
    decision

    formation, and the automation of agricultural operations. These proﬁciencies have
    revo-

    lutionized the agriculture industry in terms of resource optimization, controlling
    climate

    effects, and improving crop yields.

    Researchers have proposed different methods, architectures, and various equipment
    to

    monitor and convey crop information at different growth stages, based on several
    crop and

    ﬁeld types. Many manufacturers provide communication devices, multiple sensors,
    robots,

    heavy machinery, and drones to collect and then distribute data. Food and agriculture

    organizations, along with other government organizations, develop guidelines and
    policies

    for regulating the use of technologies to preserve food and environment safety
    [29,30].

    Fundamentals of IoT Applications in Agriculture

    The accessible, inexpensive and interactive tracking platform provides consolidated

    information on traditional agricultural methods, techniques, implements, crop
    pests and

    diseases, etc., collected from various sources for sustainable agriculture. Interactive
    agricul-

    ture allows easy access to the data by users through multiple devices, such as
    computers

    and mobile phones [31].

    1.

    Robust Models: The distinctive features of the agriculture sector are diversity,
    com-

    plexity, spatio-temporal variability, and uncertainties of the right types of
    harvests

    and facilities.

    2.

    Scalability: The variation in farm size from smaller to larger; hence, the results
    should

    be scalable. The placement and testing planning should be progressively scaled
    up

    with fewer expenses.

    3.

    Affordability: Affordability is vital to farming achievement, and therefore price
    should

    be suitable with signiﬁcant assistance. Standardized platforms, products, tools,
    and

    facilities could obtain a satisfactory price.

    4.

    Sustainability: The problem of sustainability is a vital issue due to strong economic

    pressure and intense competition worldwide.

    4. Technologies Used in Smart Farming

    4.1. Global Positioning System (GPS)

    GPS accurately records latitude, longitude, and elevation information [32]. Global

    Positioning System satellites transmit signals and permit GPS receivers to compute
    their

    location in real-time, and provide continuous positions while moving. The exact
    location

    information offers farmers the opportunity to discover the precise position of
    ﬁeld data,

    such as pest occurrence, type of soil, weeds, and other barriers. The system facilitates
    the

    recognition of various ﬁeld locations in order to then apply the necessary inputs
    (seed,

    fertilizer, herbicide, pesticide, and water) to a particular ﬁeld [33].

    4.2. Sensor Technologies

    Technics, such as photo electricity, electromagnetics, conductivity, and ultrasound,
    are

    used to estimate soil texture and structure, nutrient level, vegetation, humidity,
    vapor, air,

    temperature, etc. Remote sensing data can differentiate between crop types, categorize

    pests and weeds, locate stress in soil and plant conditions, and monitor drought
    [34].

    Plant health is affected by many factors, such as soil moisture, nutrient availability,

    exposure to light, humidity, the amount of rainfall, the color of leaves, etc.
    The plants are

    monitored by maintaining the optimum temperature and light intensity, and conserving

    water and energy through micro-irrigation. Different sensors are used to detect
    many

    parameters. If they cross a threshold, the sensor senses the changes and transmits
    them

    to the microcontroller to perform the required actions until the parameter returns
    to its

    optimum level [1].

    The temperature, humidity, soil pattern monitoring, airﬂow sensor, location, CO2,

    pressure, light, and moisture sensors are generally used in sensing technologies.
    Prominent

    sensor characteristics include reliability, memory, portability, durability, coverage,
    and

    computational efﬁciency, and make them suitable for agriculture [35]. Currently
    available

    wireless sensors play a vital role in collecting data on crop conditions and providing
    other

    information. These sensors are standalone types and can be integrated with advanced

    agricultural tools and heavy machinery, based on application necessities.

    The major sensor types with their corresponding working procedure and purpose
    are

    represented in Table 1.

    4.3. Variable-Rate of Technology (VRT) and Grid Soil Sampling

    Variable-rate technologies (VRT) are used in farming to predict the delivery rate
    of

    inputs based on a predetermined map extrapolated from GIS for the placement of
    inputs at

    variable amounts in the right place and at the right time [16,33]. Grid soil sampling
    is soil

    collection from a systematic grid to establish a map for every parameter. These
    maps are

    the basis for VRT and are loaded into a variable-rate applicator. The computer
    and GPS

    receiver direct and control the changes in the delivery amount or fertilizer product,
    based

    on map features [58,59].

    New technologies, such as variable rate technology and associated practices (grid
    soil

    sampling), potentially improve soil fertility management and assess the spatial
    distribution

    of nutrients and yields [60]. In grid sampling, samples are collected from sampled
    sections

    based on the subdivision of a ﬁeld into small areas, or cells, by superimposing
    the grid

    lines onto the ﬁeld. Composite samples represent an entire area of each much smaller
    area

    (grid-point sampling) at the intersections of grid lines. Soil-test values from
    grid sampling

    are mapped by interpolating methods from non-measured locations between sampled

    points. The variability of phosphorus and potassium is ﬁeld-speciﬁc, and each
    ﬁeld should

    be fertilized differently to improve nutrient management practices by uniform
    applications

    of fertilizers and manure for better precision agriculture [61].

    4.4. Geographic Information System (GIS)

    The GIS comprises hardware and software designed to provide compilation, storage,

    retrieval, attributes analysis, and location data to generate maps and analyze
    characters and

    geography for statistics and spatial methods [62]. The GIS database provides information

    on ﬁeld soil types, nutrient status, topography, irrigation, surface and subsurface
    drainage,

    quantity of chemical applications, and crop production, and also establishes the
    relationship

    between elements that affect a crop on a particular farming ﬁeld [63]. Apart from
    data

    storage and display, the GIS is used to assess present and alternative management
    by

    compounding and altering data layers for decision-making.

    4.5. Crop Management

    Satellite images provide information on variations in soil conditions, as well
    as crop

    performances affected by topography within the ﬁeld. Therefore, farmers can exactly

    monitor production factors, such as seeds, fertilizers, and pesticides, that are
    responsible

    for yield increase and efﬁciency.

    The spatial coverage and temporal revisit frequency of satellite images provide
    the

    information in near real-time at a regional scale. The relationship between the
    spectral prop-

    erties of crops and their biomass/yield experiments [64] is predicted by spectral
    reﬂectance

    properties of vegetation, especially in red and near-infrared combinations (vegetation

    indices) to monitor green foliage. Among the different indices, the normalized
    difference

    vegetation index (NDVI) is the most popular indicator to assess vegetation health
    and crop

    production, due to the closely related leaf area index (LAI) and photosynthetic
    activity

    of green vegetation [25]. Crop monitoring methods are based on the interpretation
    of

    remote-sensing-derived indicators by comparing actual crop status to previous
    or normal

    seasons [65]. The relationship between vegetation indices and biomass permits
    early crop

    yield estimation in certain periods before harvest [66]. The automated data acquisition,
    pro-

    cessing, monitoring, decision-making, and management of farm operations [67],
    including

    the basic functions of crop production (yields), proﬁts and losses, farm weather
    prediction,

    ﬁeld mapping, soil nutrients tracking, are the more complicated functionalities
    available

    through automated ﬁeld management.

    4.6. Soil and Plant Sensors

    Sensor technology, a signiﬁcant constituent of precision agriculture, provides
    soil

    properties information, fertility, and water status. Hence, new sensors have been
    developed

    based on desirable features and established apart from currently available sensors
    [68].

    Agriculture 2022, 12, 1745

    9 of 26

    Soil sensors and plant wearables monitor real-time physical and chemical signals

    in soil, such as moisture, pH, temperature, and pollutants, and provide information
    to

    optimize crop growth conditions, ﬁght against biotic and abiotic stresses, and
    increase

    crop yields. Soil organic matters (SOMs), nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P), and potassium

    (K) are the most important nutrients for crop production. The NIR reﬂectance-based

    sensors measure the spatial variation of surface and subsurface soil nitrogen
    [69]. SOM is

    predicted based on optimal wavelengths by assessing soil spectral reﬂectance in
    IR and

    visible wavelength regions [70]. The soil nitrogen and phosphorus are predicted
    using

    NIR spectrophotometry technology [71–73]. The soil apparent electrical conductivity
    (ECa)

    sensors collect information continuously on the ﬁeld surface, since ECa is sensitive
    to

    changes in soil texture and salinity. Soil insects/pests are detected using optoelectronic,

    acoustic, impedance sensors, and nanostructured biosensors [74].

    4.7. Rate Controllers

    Rate controllers are designed to control the delivery rate of inputs by monitoring
    the

    speed of vehicles across the ﬁeld, and altering the ﬂow rate of material on a
    real-time basis

    at the target rate. Rate controllers are commonly used as stand-alone systems
    [75].

    4.8. Precision Irrigation in Pressurized Systems

    Recent developments in irrigation systems have introduced irrigation machines,
    de-

    voted to motion control, GPS-based controllers, sensor technologies, and wireless
    commu-

    nication to monitor soil and climatic conditions together with an assessment of
    irrigation

    parameters, i.e., ﬂow and pressure, to attain greater water utilization efﬁciency
    by crop.

    These technologies show signiﬁcant potential; however, further progress is required
    before

    they can become commercially available [76].

    4.9. Yield Monitor

    Yield monitors are the combination of sensors and components, including a data

    storage device, a computer, and user interface, that control integration and interaction

    components. The sensor measures yield continuously by evaluating the force of
    mass or

    volume of grain ﬂow. The mass ﬂow sensor was based on the principle of transmitting

    microwave energy beams and measuring the energy that bounces back after hitting.
    In

    yield monitors, GPS receivers create yield maps based on the location yield data
    [77].

    The yield monitor is mounted on a harvester and connected with the mobile app
    for

    displaying live harvest data, and automatically uploads to the web-based platform.
    The

    app can generate and share high-quality yield maps with an agronomist, and farmers

    can export other farm management data for analysis. In horticultural crops, to
    precisely

    determine the yield quantity and quality of produce, fruit growth is considered
    one of

    the most relevant parameters in the crop progressing period [78]. Color images
    are used

    to track fruit conditions for estimating fruit maturation, making decisions for
    harvesting,

    and targeting the right market [79]. Satellite images are one of the options for
    real-time

    monitoring of the yield of crops over vast areas; for example, Sentinel-1A images
    are used

    to map the rice yield and crop intensity in Myanmar [80].

    The crop yield estimation system was designed using both software and hardware

    components. Based on a Bluetooth terminal android application and yield estimator

    software program, crop yield is estimated using a mathematical calculation through
    a

    mobile application [81]. Satellite-based crop yield predictions based on spectral
    signatures

    reveal the estimated yields are as reliable as actual yields. The maize yield
    predictions

    were successfully carried out under varying environments using machine learning
    and

    satellite-derived data assimilation in crop models [82].

    4.10. Software

    The software has multiple tasks, such as mapping, display controller interfacing,
    data

    processing, analysis, and interpretation, etc. Most commonly, software is used
    to generate

    Agriculture 2022, 12, 1745

    10 of 26

    the maps for soil properties and nutrient status, yield maps, variable rate applications

    maps for inputs, and overlaying different kinds of maps with advanced geostatistical

    features [83].

    5. Applications in Agriculture

    By adopting the current sensor and IoT technologies in agriculture, each characteristic

    of conventional farming practices is rehabilitated. The incorporation of wireless
    sensors

    and IoT in smart farming answers many of the issues facing conventional agriculture;
    for

    example, land suitability, drought monitoring, irrigation, pest control, and yield
    maximiza-

    tion. Figure 5 demonstrates the order of main applications, facilities, and devices
    for smart

    agriculture applications. Using advanced technologies at various stages in the
    following

    few applications enhances efﬁciency and revolutionizes agriculture.

    Figure 5. Hierarchy of probable applications, facilities and devices for smart
    agriculture.

    Agriculture 2022, 12, 1745

    11 of 26

    5.1. Soil Mapping and Plant Monitoring

    Soil analysis estimates the nutrient status of the ﬁeld based on GPS position
    and

    ﬁeld-speciﬁc information, and critical decisions are then taken according to the
    nutrient

    deﬁciencies at different stages of the crop. The factors controlling soil fertility
    status are

    topography, type and texture, cropping pattern, application of fertilizer, irrigation,
    etc. [84].

    Soil mapping is useful for assessing crop suitability or varieties in a speciﬁc
    ﬁeld, as well

    as planting depth, the physical, chemical and biological properties of soil, in
    order to

    best utilize resources. Presently, a wide range of sensors and tools are used
    to monitor

    soil properties, such as water-holding capacity, texture, and absorption rate,
    which assists

    farmers in tracking the soil quality and adopting suitable remedies to avoid soil
    degradation

    such as erosion, alkalization, acidiﬁcation, salinization, and pollution. Drought
    is another

    concern that affects plant productivity and crop yield. Remote sensing techniques
    that

    can obtain soil moisture data frequently assist in analyzing agricultural drought
    in remote

    regions. Soil moisture maps generated from satellite data are used to estimate
    the soil water

    deﬁcit index (SWDI), which enables the development of prediction models based
    on soil

    physical properties [85,86].

    Various factors, such as soil type, soil nutrients, irrigation, and pests, affect
    rice yield

    and quality. The IoT-based mobile application aids crop management and provides
    real-

    time information on soil nutrition and characteristics. The system consists of
    electrical

    conductivity (EC), temperature sensors with a T-Beam microcontroller, and IoT
    connectivity,

    and the estimated EC value near the calibration solution is 12.88 mS/cm, and 150
    mS/cm

    is less than 2% of the calibration solution’s value. The measured EC values are
    linearly

    proportional to temperature and depth, and values of 1.04 and 3.86 mS/cm were
    noticed

    with and without fertilizer at 5 cm depth, while it was 0.656 and 420 mS/cm at
    10 cm depth,

    respectively [87].

    Plant monitoring conducted through the IoT ADCON-based station, with sensors

    and mobile devices (smartphones and tablets), farmers are able to collect data
    on soil and

    ambient parameters, such as leaf wetness, air and soil temperature, soil and air
    humidity to

    improve the grape productivity, and crop quality from seeding to harvest. Further,
    the data

    transmission system highlights the soil-plant-atmosphere interactions needed to
    optimize

    agricultural production [88]. By analyzing the data from soil moisture, carbon
    dioxide,

    light, and temperature sensors in bell peppers grown in a greenhouse were compared
    with

    day and night CO2, rolling the doors and windows of the greenhouse open and closed,

    based on soil moisture [89].

    5.2. Irrigation

    According to the UN Convention to Combat Desertiﬁcation (UNCCD), 168 countries

    will be inundated with desertiﬁcation by 2030, and nearly 50% of the world population

    lives in high water shortage areas [90]. Considering the water crises and increasing
    demand

    for farming and other activities, it must be provided to regions with water quantities.
    Water

    resources are conserved by adopting more controlled and efﬁcient irrigation systems;
    for

    example, drip and sprinkler irrigations. Water demand estimation for crops is
    controlled

    by soil type, precipitation, irrigation method, crop type, and requirement, as
    well as soil

    moisture retention. Using air and soil moisture control systems with wireless
    sensors

    optimizes water resources and improves crop health. In the current scenario, a
    substantial

    increase in crop productivity is anticipated using IoT techniques, namely CWSI
    (crop water

    stress index)-based water management [91], calculated from the crop canopy at
    varying

    crop growth stages and air temperatures. The information from climate data, sensors,
    and

    satellite imaging are related to the CWSI model for water requirement calculation,
    and

    predictions using the irrigation index values can be used for every ﬁeld based
    on slope or

    soil variability to improve water usage efﬁciency.

    Agriculture 2022, 12, 1745

    12 of 26

    5.3. Site-Speciﬁc Nutrient Management

    Fertilizer is a either natural or synthetic chemical substance that provides nutrients
    for

    plant growth and soil fertility. Both nutrient deﬁciency and excessive fertilizer
    use harms

    soil, plant health, and the environment [92]. The site-speciﬁc soil nutrient fertilization
    under

    smart agriculture estimates the required quantity of nutrients precisely, and
    minimizes

    their negative effects through excessive use on soil and in the environment. The
    site-

    speciﬁc soil, nutrient measurements are inﬂuenced by soil types, crop type, yield
    targets,

    exchange capacity, use efﬁciency, the type of fertilizer, weather conditions,
    etc. The IoT-

    based fertilizing technique estimates the nutrient’s spatial patterns of distribution
    [93,94].

    The normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) was obtained from satellite
    images to

    observe crop nutrient status [95,96], crop health, vegetation vigor, and plant
    density, as well

    as soil nutrient level. Recent technologies, like GPS [97], geo mapping [98],
    variable rate

    technology (VRT) [99,100], and autonomous vehicles [101] strongly contribute to
    IoT-based

    smart fertilization. Apart from these, fertigation [102] and chemigation [103,104],
    i.e., the

    use of water-soluble fertilizers in soil amendments and pesticides, are considered
    effective

    management practices to improve fertilization efﬁciency.

    5.4. Crop Pest and Disease Management

    The Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) concluded that an annual global crop

    yield loss of 20- 40% was only due to pests and diseases [105], and these losses
    are controlled

    by the use of pesticides and other agrochemicals [106]. Most of them are harmful
    to human

    and animal health, and ultimately cause contamination of environmental systems
    [107,108].

    The IoT-based devices, such as robots, wireless sensors, and drones, precisely
    spot and

    control the crop opponents by real-time monitoring, modelling, and disease forecasting,

    increasing overall effectiveness [109,110] more than traditional pest control
    procedures.

    The IoT-based disease and pest management process depends on detection and image

    processing. The remote sensing imagery and ﬁeld sensors are used to collect data,
    such

    as plant health and pest incidence, in every ﬁeld for the entire crop period.
    IoT-based

    automated traps [111,112] capture, count, and describe insect types, and further
    upload

    data to the Cloud for complete analysis. Due to advancements in robotic technology,

    an agricultural robot with multispectral image sensing devices and precision spraying

    nozzles is utilized to detect and control pest problems more accurately under
    the IoT

    management system.

    5.5. Yield Monitoring and Forecasting

    The yield monitoring mechanism conforms to yield, moisture content, and quality
    of

    produce. The quality depends on pollination with good pollen, especially under
    changing

    environmental circumstances [113–115]. Crop forecasting predicts the yield before
    the crop

    harvest, and assists the farmer in future planning, decision-making, and further
    analysis of

    the yield quality. Maturity determines the right harvesting time by monitoring
    the crop at

    different development stages, including factors such as fruit color, size, etc.
    Predictions of

    the correct harvesting time aids in maximizing crop quality and production, and
    regulates

    market management strategies. Therefore, farmers should know the exact harvest
    time of

    crops to obtain proﬁt. Figure 6 outlines the idea of a farm area network, representing
    the

    whole farm in real-time conditions.

    The development and installation of a yield monitor [116] on a harvester, connected

    with a mobile app, shows real-time crop harvest, and automatically transmits data
    to

    the manufacturer’s web-based platform. To estimate crop production and monitoring,

    satellite images are exploited to cover vast areas [80]. For fruit crops, multicolor
    (RGB)

    satellite images [79] are utilized to track the diverse fruit conditions, especially
    fruit size

    and color, and plays a major role in estimating its maturation, making decisions
    on harvest,

    and market opportunities. Similarly, multiple optical sensors are used [117] to
    monitor

    shrinking fruits during drying conditions.

    6. Role of IoT in Advanced Farming Practices

    Adopting the new methods based on sensor and IoT-based technologies improved

    the yield of crops more than conventional agriculture processes. The involvement
    of new

    sophisticated sensor-based technologies in controlled environments plays an important

    role in enhancing the quality and quantity of produce.

    6.1. Greenhouse Farming and Protected Cultivation

    Growing plants in a controlled environment gained popularity in the 19th Century,

    and is considered one of the oldest methods of smart farming. These practices
    further

    accelerated during the 20th Century in countries facing severe weather conditions
    [118].

    Crops grown in indoor conditions are less affected by the environment. As a result,

    crops grown traditionally under suitable conditions are today being raised at
    anytime and

    anywhere by the use of sensors and communication devices. The success of crop
    production

    under a controlled environment depends on various factors, such as shed structures
    and

    material for controlling wind effects, aeration systems, accuracy of monitoring
    parameters,

    decision support system, etc. [119]. One of the greatest challenges in greenhouses
    is the

    precise monitoring of environmental parameters; hence, it requires several measurement

    points to predict the various parameters for controlling and ensuring the local
    climate. In

    an IoT-based greenhouse, sensors are used to measure and monitor the internal
    parameters,

    such as humidity, temperature, light, and pressure [120].

    The smart greenhouse has helped farmers automatically conduct farm work, without

    manual inspection, and protects the plants from hailstorms, winds, ultraviolet
    radiation,

    and insect and pest attacks. Hibiscus plants are grown with the required wavelength
    during

    the night using lights, temperature, and air humidity sensors. A study revealed
    a reduction

    in 70–80% water requirement, and the IoT enables direct contact between the farmer
    and

    consumer to make farming as efﬁcient and proﬁtable as possible [121]. The IoT-enabled

    automated system increased the productivity of rose plants grown in a greenhouse
    by

    Agriculture 2022, 12, 1745

    14 of 26

    monitoring and controlling various parameters, such as humidity, mist, CO2 level,
    UV light

    intensity, pH and EC value, water nutrients solution level, temperature, and amount
    of

    pesticides, through sensors for further efﬁcient detection and diagnosis [122].

    6.2. Hydroponics

    Hydroponics, a subdivision of hydroculture, is growing plants without soil to
    improve

    greenhouse farming beneﬁts. Hydroponic-based irrigation systems enable a balanced
    rate

    of application of dissolved nutrients in the water to crop roots as a solution.
    Presently,

    the available systems and sensors [123] detect a wide range of parameters and
    perform

    data analysis at predetermined intervals. Precise measurement and monitoring of
    nutrient

    content in solution is crucial for plant growth and considers its demands. On
    a real-

    time basis, the wireless-sensor-based prototype [124] has delivered a solution
    for soilless

    cultivation, and measures the concentration of numerous nutrients and water levels
    [125].

    An automated smart hydroponics system integrated with IoT consists of three major

    components: input data, cloud server and output data. These monitor lettuce cultivation

    from anywhere through the internet by analyzing parameters, such as pH level,
    water,

    nutrient-rich water-based solution, room temperature, and humidity, on a real-time
    ba-

    sis [126]. The hydroponic system of the deep ﬂow technique is a method for cultivating

    plants by placing roots in deep water layers, and ensuring the continuous circulation
    of

    plant nutrient solution. The plant growth elements data, such as pH, temperature,
    humid-

    ity, and water level in the hydroponic reservoir, are acquired by sensors integrated
    into

    Raspberry Pi, and data are processed and monitored automatically on a real-time
    basis to

    ensure proper water circulation [127].

    6.3. Vertical Farming

    The industrial-based agricultural farming practices damage soil quality at a faster

    rate than nature can reconstruct. The alarming erosion rate and use of fresh water
    for

    agriculture has led to the reduction of arable land, and increased the overburden
    on present

    water reservoirs [128]. Vertical farming (VF) offers an opportunity to keep the
    plants in a

    precisely controlled environment, signiﬁcantly reducing resource consumption and,
    at the

    same time, increasing production at varied times; and only a portion of the ground
    surface

    is needed depending on the number of stacks. VF is also extremely effective in
    higher

    yields and reducing water consumption compared to traditional farming [129]. The
    carbon

    dioxide measurement is the most critical parameter; hence, nondispersive infrared
    (NDIR)

    CO2 sensors play a vital part in tracking and controlling the conditions in vertical
    farms.

    6.4. Phenotyping

    Phenotyping is an emerging crop engineering technique, relating plant genomics
    with

    ecophysiology and agronomy. The advancement of genetic and molecular tools is
    signiﬁ-

    cant for crop breeding; however, quantitative analysis of crop behaviors, such
    as pathogen

    resistance, grain weight, etc., is inadequate due to the absence of effective
    technologies

    and efﬁcient techniques. In this condition, [130] reported that plant phenotyping
    is highly

    useful in investigating the quantitative characteristics responsible for growth,
    resistance

    to various stresses, yield quality, and quantity. The sensing technologies and
    image-based

    phenotyping describe screening of biostimulants and an understanding of their
    mode

    of action [131]. IoT-based phenotyping is intended to observe the crop and related
    trait

    measurements, and offer facilities for the breeding of crops and digital agriculture
    [132].

    The trait analysis algorithms and modelling support determine the relationships
    among

    genotypes, phenotypes, and their growing condition.

    7. The Role of the Engineer in Smart Farming

    Farmers face many issues when they adopt IoT-based agriculture. Therefore, engi-

    neers must develop solutions for speciﬁc problems related to smart farming techniques.
    An

    engineering role concerns the application and use of innovative technologies and
    methods

    Agriculture 2022, 12, 1745

    15 of 26

    for precision agricultural machinery, and smart farming is a creative way to mechanize

    agricultural engineering through means different from conventional mechanization
    [133].

    The concepts and synergy-based information are obtained from different technology
    areas,

    such as agricultural mechanization, mechatronics, instrumentation, control systems,
    and

    knowledge in artiﬁcial and computational intelligence [134]. Big data, satellite,
    and aerial

    images have revolutionized precision agriculture, and these new technologies increase

    production efﬁciency by creating a balance between productivity and environmental
    pro-

    tection. As a system integrator, engineering combines technical experience and
    strong

    business skills in both the public and private sectors [135].

    At the same time, engineering exploits the rewards of digital transformation in
    the

    entire agri-food chain, from day-to-day farming activities to supporting sales
    operations,

    logistics, and the maintenance of farm assets. For example, knowledge of the IoT,
    AI,

    mobile, precision farming technologies, remote sensing, advanced analytics, the
    Cloud,

    RPA, and blockchain technologies are necessary [136]. The data collected from
    the various

    types of machinery through sensors and other devices generates responses concerning

    cereals, viticulture, fruit, and vegetables, as well as soil and monitoring [137].

    The use of digital technologies and control systems to automate production processes

    also reduces manual human intervention. The production process, from ﬁeld to ﬁnal

    product, is carried out by planning, organizing, and analyzing data received from
    machines.

    The data acquired are stored in historical archives and correlated with each other
    to

    retrieve useful information for products through traceable systems working based
    on

    radio-frequency signals [138].

    7.1. Purpose

    Purpose is based on the user’s ﬁnal requirement, and inﬂuences the monitoring
    of

    crops during the growth period. Sensors provide the IoT solutions to their problems.

    For example, the end-user is a corn farmer, faced by problems mainly concerning
    water

    usage and ensuring that a crop gets adequate water; therefore, water level and
    moisture

    monitoring sensors are accommodated to prevent water wastage.

    7.2. Technology

    Distance plays an important role in technology selection because the sensors collect

    data and send to the server; hence, similar technology cannot be used for varying
    distances.

    For example, radio frequency identiﬁcation (RFID) or near ﬁeld communication (NFC)
    and

    low power, wide area network (LPWAN) technologies could send data over a distance
    of

    hundreds or even thousands of meters.

    7.3. Power Requirements

    Most IoT solutions are spread across a large farm, so it is better to develop
    low-

    power applications. On the other hand, more data transmission requires huge data
    costs

    and power consumption; hence, designers need to consider developing cost-effective
    IoT

    solutions for farmers. Usually, engineers save costs with customized IoT-based
    farming

    solutions, and develop apps for sending the data less frequently.

    7.4. Data Frequency

    The end user’s necessities are critical in deciding the number of sensors and
    data

    packets. Sometimes, a farmer does not require information frequently, but developer
    design

    an IoT application to function on a continual and real-time basis, with very high
    data

    frequency.

    7.5. Placement of Sensors

    Sensors are placed in such a way that they provide optimal performance, even if
    the

    farm has all the essential sensors with proper placement.

    8. Barriers to Implementing Smart Farming Technologies

    Technology adoption is a method with a certain level of heterogeneity factors
    that

    are affective [139]. Technology implemented in farming systems has provided accuracy,

    efﬁciency, and eased time pressures. Although smart farming increases the productivity
    of

    crops, there are still problems in adopting these technologies

    8.1. Cost of Technology

    Existing technologies minimize the workforce and perform extremely fast with high

    accuracy. Therefore, it is anticipated that machines would probably replace a
    human work-

    force in the near future. However, it is impossible, since many countries have
    experienced

    poverty wherever the workforce was the main source for the agriculture sector.
    The imple-

    mentation of devices and technologies requires a huge amount of money; therefore,
    farmers

    face difﬁculties in terms of affordability when they look beyond conventional
    tools.

    8.2. Lack of Financial Resources

    Financial supporters could provide adequate loans to farmers if farmers did not
    get

    the anticipated yield, perhaps because unexpected calamities like drought, ﬂood,
    pests,

    and diseases impacted the crops.

    8.3. Literacy Status of Farmers

    The education level among the farmers is one of the greater challenges in implementing

    technologies in developing countries. The knowledge needed encompasses educational
    and

    technical abilities to manage the tools. The level of education increases a farmers’
    aptitude

    to process information, and thus make decisions using smart farming technologies
    [140],

    facilitating farmers’ use of computers [141]. Farmers in developing nations are
    mostly

    uneducated and unskilled because of a lack of desire to gain knowledge, or any
    new

    technology awareness [142]. Hence, it is a reason for farmers in choosing traditional

    farming over smart farming [143]. Farmers have considered that usage is too complex,

    sometimes incapable of recognizing the icons used in a mobile application as the
    farmers

    use general icons based on traditional understanding. Farmers need to be digitally
    literate

    to reinforce the advantages of smart farming technologies and, simultaneously,
    agri-tech

    companies should ensure farmers easily understand the limitations of the technology.

    8.4. Lack of Integration between the Systems

    Integration across systems is one of the areas where smart farming technologies
    needs

    to be advanced further by incorporating production, property management, and decision-

    making tools. The communication between academics and interdisciplinary groups
    must

    overcome the gap between agricultural and information science. More emphasis has

    been given to increasing user effectiveness during the development of an information

    system [144]. The basis for improved decision-making is based on the timely obtain-

    ability of superior quality data; hence, data must be integrated to generate information

    and knowledge.

    8.5. Telecommunications Infrastructure

    Farming activities mostly occur in rural areas more effectively in arable land
    than

    contaminated land. However, poor telecommunication infrastructure makes data transmis-

    sion unreliable, especially through mobile phones and tablets. Smart farming necessitates

    a real-time connection with the internet to enable the use of information. In
    addition,

    various operation control systems, such as fertilizers, pesticides, and seed volume,
    requires

    high-quality internet connection to produce outcomes. Recently, with the expansion
    of

    mobile phones, rural producers have gained to access mobile internet; however,
    signal

    quality and input speed are limited.

    Agriculture 2022, 12, 1745

    17 of 26

    8.6. Data Management

    Farmers are facing problems in organizing and manipulating data obtained by the

    sensors. The weather stations are generating data; however, farmers do not recognize
    how

    to use the information and how to change the data into a more available form.
    Its complex

    systems, alongside issues of acceptability and usability, lead to incorrect calculations.

    Farmers, consultants, and others involved in the production process must provide
    greater

    accessibility to data and information in productive systems.

    9. Current Challenges and Future Expectations

    In the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, the United Nations and international

    community established a goal to end hunger by 2030. Currently, the World Health
    Organi-

    zation reports that more than 800 million people are facing food shortages worldwise
    [145].

    In addition, the increasing global population is increasing the demand for quality
    food;

    therefore, food and cash crops could improve overall crop production.

    Figure 7 represents the future challenges agriculture is anticipated to face in
    2050. This

    illustration offers three major problems: (1) feeding 10 billion people, (2) limitations
    in the

    expansion of land, and (3) the reduction of greenhouse gases emissions. These
    challenges

    lead to new thinking about water scarcity, shrinking arable land, rural labor,
    climate condi-

    tions, and much more. The diminishment in rural populations due to urbanization
    is not

    only shrinking communities, but is also leading to ageing populations; therefore,
    younger

    growers must step forward to take responsibility. The generation shift and population

    imbalance create further implications for the workforce and production.

    Figure 7. Challenges in sustainable future agriculture.

    The further shrinking of arable land and the suitability of particular crops in
    speciﬁc

    regions are due to geographic and ecological conditions. Abrupt weather changes
    enhance

    the intensity of environmental issues, such as drought, groundwater depletion,
    and soil

    degradation, affecting crop production. Moreover, traditional agricultural methods
    have

    historically met food demands by employing fertilizers and pesticides; however,
    it increases

    food production only to a certain level and negligent use of chemical deteriorate
    the envi-

    ronment. In developing countries, various problems facing the agricultural sector
    include

    no suitable crop selection, soil testing, efﬁcient irrigation systems, weather
    forecasting,

    animal husbandry, etc. Technological advancements have proved beneﬁcial in developed

    countries, both quantitively and qualitatively, but, in developing countries,
    50% of the

    population is already engaged in agriculture.

    Agriculture 2022, 12, 1745

    18 of 26

    The future of agriculture is expected to interconnect with artiﬁcial intelligence
    and

    big data services. As a result, the systems will converge into a single unit,
    where farm

    machinery and management start from seeding to production forecasting. Few of
    the key

    technologies and methods are focused on achieving sustainable future agriculture.

    9.1. Communication

    The achievement of the IoT in agriculture mostly depends on connectivity between

    devices [146]. Most telecom operators provide connectivity services, but represent
    a small

    percentage of smart farming as a whole. Cellular operators offer new services
    to target

    growers and enhance market facilities, especially in rural areas. The success
    of cellular

    technology is feasible when service providers guarantee its beneﬁts, such as ﬂexibility,

    portability, and extravagance, of both-way communication at low cost. In developing

    countries, mobile services and smartphone technology offer a hopeful future for
    farmers

    to enhance their crop yields. The low power wide area technology (LPWA) is anticipated

    to play a major role in smart farming agriculture, due to its improved facilities,
    efﬁcient

    coverage, low power consumption, and cost economics. The cellular operators with
    robust

    IoT create signiﬁcant returns by offering smart agriculture facilities in collaboration
    with

    LPWA technology.

    9.2. Wireless Sensors and IoT

    Placing wireless sensors around the ﬁeld provides timely information on a real-time

    basis to farmers in order to make decisions and act in order to obtain higher
    crop yields.

    Wireless sensor networks (WSNs) with GPS technology update all information on
    crop

    growth and terrain features. Recently, digital images and signal processing offer
    additional

    competencies to WSN, and precisely ascertain crop quality and health. The IoT
    technology

    can streamline tasks in a predictable manner by diagnosing crop requirements at
    each

    stage to maximize their effectiveness. In the future, IoT will be upgraded to
    the ﬁfth-

    generation (5G) cellular mobile communication technologies, to provide real-time
    data

    to farmers at any time and everywhere. Based on this achievement, around 29 billion

    IoT-based components are expected to operate in the agriculture sector by the
    end of 2022.

    Furthermore, it is expected to create 4.1 million data points daily from farms
    by 2050 [147].

    9.3. Drones and Unarmed Vehicles

    Farmers widely use drones for crop growth monitoring, spraying nutrient solutions

    and water, and pesticides in tough terrains and for different crop heights. Drones
    have

    proven their value for spraying speed, area coverage, and precision, compared
    to tradi-

    tional machinery. Due to advancements in technology, drones are equipped with
    various

    sensors, and 3D cameras provide comprehensive capabilities in land management
    by

    farmers. With the addition of UAVs in agriculture, many challenges, particularly
    the in-

    corporation of technologies and use in inclement weather conditions, are addressed
    by

    farmers. Other than drones, robotics in agriculture has also enhanced productivity
    due to

    higher yields achieved by spraying and weeding without human intervention. The
    seeding,

    transplanting, and fruit harvest/picking robots have recently added a new efﬁciency
    level

    to traditional methods.

    The UAV technology in smart agriculture provides information on fertilization,
    ir-

    rigation, use of pesticides, plant growth monitoring, weed management, crop disease

    management, and ﬁeld-level phenotyping to enhance cultivation practices. A new
    method

    of 3D modeling has been used to monitor crop growth parameters to determine the
    height

    of maize and sorghum plants under ﬁeld conditions using UAV, and the average root
    mean

    square error (RMSE) of sorghum height with hand sampling ﬁeld data was 0.33 m
    [148]. The

    UAV and 3D models were also restored to extract leaf area index (LAI) in soybean
    plants,

    the measured LAI predicted accuracy corresponding to the handheld device (R2 =
    0.92)

    was correlated with destructive LAI measurements (R2 = 0.89) [149].

    Agriculture 2022, 12, 1745

    19 of 26

    Weed detection and management were assessed by integrating low-resolution multi-

    spectral high-resolution RGB images [150] using the Random Forest (RF) technique
    in

    ﬁeld-grown rice and sugar beet crops [151]. Multi-spectral digital images obtained
    by

    UAVs are used for evaluating vegetation indices (VIs) and multi-temporal VIs to
    predict

    grain yield in wheat [152]. The indices, including the normalized difference vegetation

    index (NDVI), spectral vegetation index (SVI), and green area index (GAI), are
    evaluated in

    wheat crops to predict grain yield [153], monitor breeding [154], detect plant
    stress caused

    by yellow rust disease [155], and quantify plant density [156]. The usage of pesticides
    in

    agriculture is crucial for crop yields and the environment, and efforts have been
    made to

    develop and evaluate an algorithm to self-adjust UAV routes during chemical spraying
    in a

    crop ﬁeld to reduce the waste of pesticides and fertilizers [157].

    9.4. Vertical Farming and Hydroponics

    The shrinking of arable land and rapid urbanization results in greater pressure
    on the

    present resources [158], which causes hardships for food production with current
    agricul-

    ture practices. Vertical farming (VF) navigates land and water shortage challenges,
    and

    is highly suitable for adoption in nearby cities. Hydroponics plays a key role
    in lowering

    water requirements. Hydroponics, along with VF, increases available arable land
    without

    distressing forests and other natural habitats. The presence of advanced technologies,

    especially the IoT, makes the agriculture industry highly remunerative with a
    reduction in

    labor requirements and other resources, in addition to minimizing environmental
    impact.

    9.5. Performance Analysis Using Machine Learning

    Data analytics and machine learning concepts are applied to analyze the real-time

    data. In crop production, identifying the best genes is an important process that
    can be

    conducted using machine learning techniques. In agriculture, machine learning
    is used to

    envisage the best genes suited for crop production, especially for selecting seed
    varieties

    that are highly suitable to speciﬁc climate conditions and locations. Machine
    learning

    algorithms identify high demand products and currently unavailable products. Recent

    developments in machine learning and analytics allow farmers to correctly categorize
    their

    harvests before it is processes and delivered to customers.

    Machine learning (ML) in big data systems solves the issues related to farmers’

    decision-making, crops, animal research, land, food availability and security,
    weather

    and climate change, and weeds [159]. ML-based applications accommodate a large
    number

    of agricultural activities, such as yield prediction based on a deep memory model
    for

    maize [160], binary classiﬁcation model with logistic regression technique to
    assess rainfall

    intensity [161], and a short-term memory model to predict soil water content with
    data

    parameters of rainfall, temperature, water diversion, evaporation, and time for
    the next

    1, 2, and 7 days with greater R2 compared to artiﬁcial neural networks [162].
    As a result,

    the agricultural sector is increasing farmers’ incomes, and so communities are
    further

    integrated into the agricultural value chain to reduce poverty and provide access
    to health

    care, education, and nutritious food for their families [163].

    9.6. Renewable Energy, Microgrids and Smart Grids

    Smart farming requires extensive energy due to power consumption by long-standing

    sensor placement, use of GPS, and data transmission. Traditionally, using renewable
    energy

    sources in remote areas solves long-term power issues. Smart grids and microgrids
    are

    integrated into distributed energy sources (DERs). Recent advances in storage
    devices

    combine electricity and heat systems to stock energy and use the heat produced.

    Globally, smart grid technology enables a smooth transition from traditional to
    smart

    energy systems, ensuring energy security. In developing countries, power-strengthening

    systems integrated with renewable sources have enhanced the transport sector,
    and in-

    creased bioenergy use in the power sector through profuse renewable energy sources

    identiﬁed using smart technologies, such as, energy storage devices, smart appliances,

    Agriculture 2022, 12, 1745

    20 of 26

    computational intelligence, and the IoT. For example, the smart grid provides
    a broad

    range of opportunities for power sector reform in Nepal, alleviating the rural
    electricity

    problem by implementing smart microgrids, and subsequently, connecting to the
    national

    grid [164]. The Dayalbagh renewable energy smart microgrid in India is a small-scale

    electricity system comprising distributed loads and renewable energy resources,
    acting as a

    single controllable entity in the grid. The smart microgrids are integrated into
    renewable

    resources and form building blocks of smart grids, especially for the dairy plant
    to produce

    various dairy products [165].

    The mixed integer linear programme (MILP) systematically and efﬁciently managed

    energy consumption and subsequently lowered the cost, especially in residential
    areas,

    by scheduling the use of smart appliances and charging/discharging electric vehicles

    (EVs). The model generates its own energy from a microgrid containing solar panels

    and wind turbines, and forecasts wind speed and solar radiation for effective
    energy

    management. MILP-based energy planning sustains the effectiveness and productiveness

    of energy-efﬁcient techniques [166].

    10. Conclusions

    Smarter and more efﬁcient crop production methodologies are needed to address
    the

    issues of shrinking arable land and the food demands of an increasing world population.

    There is a necessity for everyone to be aware of food security in terms of sustainable

    agriculture. The growth of new technologies for increasing crop yield and encouraging

    the adoption of farming by innovative young people as a legitimate profession.
    This

    paper emphasized the role of many technologies used for farming, particularly
    the IoT,

    in making agriculture smarter and more effective in meeting future requirements.
    The

    current challenges faced by the industry and future prospects are noted to guide
    scholars

    and engineers. Hence, every piece of farmland is important to enhance crop production
    by

    dealing with every inch of land using sustainable IoT-based sensors and communication

    technologies.

    of Things (IoT) technologies can greatly benefit from machine learning techniques
    and Artificial Neural Networks for data mining and vice versa. In the agricultural
    field, this convergence could result in the development of smart farming systems

    ity while reducing adverse impacts on the environment. Precision agriculture is\
    \ a farming approach\nthat uses advanced technology and data analysis to maximize\
    \ crop yields, cut waste, and increase\nproductivity. It is a potential strategy\
    \ for tackling some of the major issues confronting contemporary\nagriculture,\
    \ such as feeding a growing world population while reducing environmental effects.\
    \ This\nreview article examines some of the latest recent advances in precision\
    \ agriculture, including the\nInternet of Things (IoT) and how to make use of\
    \ big data. This review article aims to provide an\noverview of the recent innovations,\
    \ challenges, and future prospects of precision agriculture and\nsmart farming.\
    \ It presents an analysis of the current state of precision agriculture, including\
    \ the most\nrecent innovations in technology, such as drones, sensors, and machine\

    \ (AI)\n1. Introduction\nPrecision agriculture (PA) is a management strategy for\
    \ addressing geographical\nand temporal variabilities in agricultural ﬁelds [1–3]\
    \ that involves data and contempo-\nrary technologies. With a forecasted human\
    \ population of between 9 and 10 billion by\n2050 [3–5], precision agriculture\
    \ is becoming more and more important to contemporary\nagricultural research.\
    \ By 2050, the amount of food produced worldwide must grow by at\nleast 70% [1,5–7].\
    \ This is a difﬁcult endeavor [4] because it puts further strain on already-\n\
    scarce resources and the environment [1–3]. Therefore, precision agriculture is\
    \ essential\nto maximize output while using fewer inputs of all sorts in more\
    \ effective ways, reducing\nadverse impacts on the environment, and assuring sustainability\
    \ [2,3]. Precision farming\nwas born with the introduction of GPSs (global positioning\
    \ systems), GISs (geographic in-\nformation systems), yield monitors, and other\
    \ data generators in all three crucial phases of\nagricultural operations in the\
    \ 1990s [2,8,9]. In precision agriculture, motorized equipment\nwas only used\
    \ for performing agricultural processes [2,10], and the problem-recognizing\n\
    and decision-making steps were authorized by humans. The technological advancement\n\
    during the Third Industrial Revolution, known as Industry 3.0 [8], led precision\
    \ agriculture\nto digitalization by integrating information technologies and improved\
    \ automation capa-\nbilities in precision farming. As a result of this digitalization,\
    \ “farm practices” with manual\ntools moved to “agriculture” from animal traction,\
    \ then to motorized mechanization, and\nnow to digital equipment [2].\nPrecision\
    \ agriculture so far mainly consists of variable rate technologies (VRTs), elec-\n\
    tronic maps, yield monitors, and guidance farming systems [2,8]. Variable rate\
    \ applications\nAgriculture 2023, 13, 1593. https://doi.org/10.3390/agriculture13081593\n\
    https://www.mdpi.com/journal/agriculture\nAgriculture 2023, 13, 1593\n2 of 26\n\
    were ﬁrstly demonstrated in northern Germany and Denmark in 1988 after global\
    \ posi-\ntioning systems (GPSs) were available for civil services [11]. GPS services\
    \ were opened\nfor general use in U.S. farms in 1983 [2]. In the next decade,\
    \ GPS technology facilitated\nfarmers to precisely locate and map their ﬁelds\
    \ [10,12], empowering them to manage their\nfarmlands according to site-speciﬁc\
    \ conditions and ﬁeld variabilities. At the beginning\nof the second millennium,\
    \ yield monitors were developed, enabling farmers to monitor\ncrop yield in real-time\
    \ via best matching [13]. Advancement of remote-sensing technology,\nsuch as satellites,\
    \ drones, ground-based sensors, and crews, authorized farmers to collect\nhigh-resolution\
    \ data on their ﬁelds, allowing them to make informed decisions about\ncrop management\
    \ [3]. Precision agriculture is not only focused on crop farming but also\non\
    \ other agricultural production systems: agronomics, livestock farming, aquaculture,\n\
    and agroforestry [2,3,9,14].\nIn the current status of precision agriculture,\
    \ there are several issues, such as un-\nsustainable resource utilization, long-term\
    \ monoculture, intensive animal farming [8],\nenvironmental compromises, uneven\
    \ distribution of digitization [15], food safety issues,\ninefﬁcient agri-food\
    \ supply chain [13,16], and lack of awareness of and inertia toward novel\nchanges.\
    \ These issues prevent achieving efﬁciency, productivity, and sustainability from\n\
    agricultural production and escalate unintended impacts on ecosystems [17]. The\
    \ fourth\nindustrial revolution, which is known as Industry 4.0, occurred in 2011\
    \ with the Internet of\nThings (IoT), big data, artiﬁcial intelligence (AI), robotics,\
    \ and blockchain technology [8,18].\nIn 2017, these advanced technologies were\
    \ integrated into agriculture in order to over-\ncome the above-mentioned issues,\
    \ transforming precision agriculture to Agriculture 4.0,\nor smart farming [8,16].\
    \ With this transition, there is a growing focus on sustainability\nin agriculture,\
    \ with many farmers adopting precision agricultural technologies to reduce\nthe\
    \ environmental impacts of farming and promote long-term sustainability. As a\
    \ result,\nagricultural-manufacturing processes and supply chains have become\
    \ more autonomous\nand intelligent [18], including the automation of various tasks\
    \ such as planting, seeding,\nharvesting, and soil sampling. This is making farming\
    \ more efﬁcient while reducing\nlabor costs.\nSmart agriculture is an evolving\
    \ ﬁeld that leverages technological innovations to\ntransform traditional farming\
    \ practices. The integration of digital technologies into agricul-\nture has opened\
    \ up new opportunities and possibilities, revolutionizing the way farmers\nmanage\
    \ their crops, resources, and operations. It is a rapidly evolving ﬁeld that encom-\n\
    passes a wide array of approaches, applications, and impacts. The broader objective\
    \ of\nthis review is to delve into the essential aspects of precision agriculture,\
    \ exploring its key\ncomponents and highlighting its potential for sustainable\
    \ farming practices. One of the\ncritical aspects of precision agriculture is\
    \ data collection and acquisition planning, which\nplays a fundamental role in\
    \ optimizing farm management decisions. Through efﬁcient data\ngathering, farmers\
    \ can make informed choices regarding crop health, resource allocation,\nand yield\
    \ optimization. Decision making and execution are also vital components of preci-\n\
    sion agriculture, where the integration of cutting-edge technologies is pivotal.\
    \ Leveraging\nmachine vision technology, the Internet of Things (IoT), and artiﬁcial\
    \ intelligence (AI) can\nlead to enhanced precision and efﬁciency in agricultural\
    \ processes, beneﬁting both farmers\nand the environment. Throughout this review,\
    \ successful precision agriculture proposals\nand real-world implementations are\
    \ analyzed to gain insights into their achievements and\nchallenges. By identifying\
    \ future developments required in precision agriculture, we aim\nto provide a\
    \ comprehensive understanding of how this ﬁeld can continually evolve to\nsupport\
    \ sustainable farming practices and address global food security challenges. The\n\
    amalgamation of scientiﬁc research and technological innovations holds great promise\
    \ for\nthe future of precision agriculture and its positive impact on agriculture\
    \ and society as\na whole.\nAgriculture 2023, 13, 1593\n3 of 26\n2. Precision\
    \ Agriculture Approaches, Applications, and Impacts\nPrecision agriculture involves\
    \ data-driven management decisions that improve re-\nsource use efﬁciency, resulting\
    \ in reduced agricultural costs while lowering the environ-\nmental impacts from\
    \ agriculture [19]. Hence, data and data collection systems, decision\nsupport\
    \ tools, and data-driven equipment and input adjustments are major components\n\
    of precision agriculture [2], engaging in three key agricultural steps: diagnosis,\
    \ decision\nmaking, and performing [20], respectively. Before the integration\
    \ of smart technologies,\nICT (information and communication technology) was incorporated\
    \ into agricultural de-\nvices and machinery to capture real data. Here, remote\
    \ sensing, automated hardware and\nsoftware, telematics, drones, autonomous vehicles,\
    \ GPSs, and robotic technologies were\nincorporated into agricultural practices.\
    \ As an example, the agro-tech company John Deere\nintroduced GPSs for tractors,\
    \ expecting increased yield and decreased input wastage [19].\nThe previous status\
    \ of precision agriculture before smart farming can be summarized\nas follows.\n\
    2.1. Data Collection and Acquisition\nData, data collection, and decision support\
    \ tools are important for the identiﬁcation\nand diagnosis of various aspects\
    \ in agriculture. In precision agriculture, data on individual\nﬁelds and crops\
    \ are gathered by observing, measuring, and sensing with different kinds of\n\
    sensors, yield and soil monitors, and remote-sensing tools, such as imaging from\
    \ drones,\ncrews, aircraft, or satellites [1–3,13]. Thus, “sensing” is a fundamental\
    \ management tool\nof precision agriculture [3,13], which is observing detailed\
    \ information and providing\ndata on climate conditions, soil conditions, fertilizer\
    \ requirements, water availability, pest\nand disease stresses, and other ﬁeld\
    \ parameters [3]. A range of sensors are used in preci-\nsion agriculture. Biomass\
    \ parameters are important in making decisions to monitor the\nfertilization and\
    \ caring for crops. Sensors for mass ﬂow and moisture content are com-\nponents\
    \ of yield monitors, together with a differential global positioning system (DGPS)\n\
    receiver. Properly calibrated yield monitors can generate accurate real-time information\
    \ for\ndecision making, such as underperforming areas leading to site-speciﬁc\
    \ crop fertilization\ndesigns [13]. Precision livestock farming uses sensors and\
    \ monitoring technology to collect\ndata on animal health and welfare, enabling\
    \ farmers to make informed decisions about\nfeed, waste, and other inputs with\
    \ improved efﬁciency and productivity. Colter position\nsensors combined with\
    \ ultrasonic soil surface sensors are employed in dynamic Colter\ndepth control\
    \ systems [3].\nRemote-sensing technologies, such as drones, crews, aircraft,\
    \ satellites, and other\nground-based sensors, are used to collect data on crops\
    \ and soil conditions [2,3]. Remote\nsensing supports the identiﬁcation of spatial\
    \ patterns of signatures of plants that are co-\nincidental with soil characteristics,\
    \ as well as pest or disease stresses [11]. Imagery is one\nkind of remote-sensing\
    \ data that can reveal ground truthing [2,3,11]. Previously, aircraft\nhave been\
    \ used not only for many farming imagery operations that generate data, but also\n\
    chemical- or fertilizer-spraying activities. Moreover, satellite images have been\
    \ available for\nfarm management for many years. As an example, the US-LANDSAT\
    \ satellites were avail-\nable for this purpose in 1970 [2]. Unmanned aerial vehicles\
    \ (UAVs) equipped with global\nnavigation satellite system (GNSS) technology have\
    \ been recently employed for mapping,\ngathering imagery data, land surveying,\
    \ crop spraying, and livestock monitoring [2,3].\nGeocoded sampling is a requisite\
    \ component of precision agriculture and ground truthing\nwhen spatial images\
    \ are used for decision making [11]. Real-time and cost-effective remote\nsensing,\
    \ such as LASSIE (low-altitude stationary surveillance instrumental equipment),\n\
    are crucial in precision agriculture, as it enables continuous and automatic recoding\
    \ of\nreal-time images of crops and soil with GIS reference [11]. This information\
    \ can be used to\nmake informed decisions about crop management resource allocation\
    \ [3].\nSensor data and other data associated with geospatial coordinates from\
    \ a global\nnavigation satellite system (GNSS) provide information to create maps,\
    \ especially yield\nmaps and soil maps for site-speciﬁc management decisions [2,3].\
    \ Yield maps are used\nAgriculture 2023, 13, 1593\n4 of 26\nto characterize ﬁeld\
    \ production quantitatively and qualitatively [21], which is crucial\nto make\
    \ management decisions. Analyzing variabilities depicted on maps enables the\n\
    identiﬁcation of factors that inﬂuence productivity, facilitating the implementation\
    \ of site-\nspeciﬁc ﬁeld management strategies [3]. Soil maps offer valuable insights\
    \ into the spatial\ndistribution of the physical and chemical properties within\
    \ a given ﬁeld [21], serving as\nindispensable decision-making tools in precision\
    \ agriculture [13]. This signiﬁcance stems\nfrom the fact that soil’s physical\
    \ and chemical characteristics, such as water availability,\nnutrient-holding\
    \ capacity, bulk density, porosity, nutrient availability, and topography,\ntypically\
    \ exert an inﬂuence on crop yield [21]. Weather and climate trends can also be\n\
    predicted using sensor data, which are important in all farming practices. Harvesting\
    \ time\nis an affecting factor of grain loss in paddy rice farming, which is also\
    \ able to be monitored\nwith data observation [1].\n2.2. Planning, Decision Making,\
    \ and Execution\nAfter creating decisions by analyzing gathered information, actions\
    \ are performed\naccording to the decisions created using data-driven equipment.\
    \ Most ﬁelds are not\nhomogenous in terms of soil and climate properties, as well\
    \ as diseases [22]. Conventional\nagriculture did not take this into account;\
    \ therefore, rigorous use of limited resources and\nexcess use of chemicals and\
    \ synthetic fertilizers resulted in unsustainable conventional\nagricultural practices.\
    \ This also drove lots of wastage, even in the amounts of resource\ninputs and\
    \ yield. Nonetheless, precision agriculture itself has proved that the application\n\
    of technologies to manage the spatial and temporal variabilities in agricultural\
    \ ﬁelds is\npossible to improve performance and environmental quality [9]. Variable\
    \ rate technologies\nin precision agriculture involve applying inputs such as\
    \ fertilizers, water and seeds, and\ncrop protection chemicals (pesticides and\
    \ weedicides) at varying rates, depending on the\nspeciﬁc needs of each area of\
    \ a ﬁeld [23]. In this approach, residual issues of chemicals, as\nwell as wastage\
    \ of input resources, can be reduced. Also, net proﬁt can be improved with\nincreased\
    \ crop yield and reduced input costs, as farmers can use resources according to\
    \ the\nﬁeld requirements rather than full-coverage application in ﬁelds at uniform\
    \ rates [2,24,25].\nAccording to the identiﬁed heterogeneity of a ﬁeld, amounts\
    \ of water, fertilizer, her-\nbicides, pesticides, and liming can be determined\
    \ and applied. When considering the\nirrigation practices in precision agriculture,\
    \ technology-driven, more sustainable smart\nirrigation systems are there to apply\
    \ precise amounts of water at precise times. When\nsoil moisture sensor data give\
    \ an estimation of a required amount of water, irrigation\nsystems can be diverted\
    \ into variable rate irrigation to apply irrigation water until mois-\nture content\
    \ returns to the ideal level [26]. Most of the time, these effective and efﬁcient\n\
    water management systems are automatically controlled, increasing irrigation water\
    \ use\nefﬁciency (IWUE). Monteiro et al. in 2021 described the use of satellite\
    \ LANDSAT data and\nremote-sensing data to develop a feasible operational irrigation\
    \ water model [3]. Likewise,\ntillage depth can be determined via matching with\
    \ variabilities of soil physical proper-\nties [27]. Chemical spraying and seeding\
    \ are also performed according to variable rate\napproaches. Previously, agricultural\
    \ aircraft were used for chemical spraying, where a\npilot controlled the spray\
    \ [23]. In the present, aircraft are employed with an auto-adjusting\nability\
    \ for the application rate of chemicals based on a prescription map, whilst UAVs\
    \ are\nalso used as fertilizer spreaders [3]. Precision seeding can control sowing\
    \ depth, densities,\nand distances effectively while saving seeds, time, and labor\
    \ costs. Studies estimated that\nprecision seeding based on variable rate technologies\
    \ was 10% to 30% more efﬁcient than\nconventional practices [3].\nThis site-speciﬁc\
    \ management increases the number of correct decisions per unit area\nper unit\

    3.1. Big Data\nPrecision agriculture systems are highly related to data and information\
    \ [5]. Gen-\nerally, unstructured and vast amounts of data are used by big business\
    \ industries, like\nsocial-networking sites, to learn or predict customer behaviors\
    \ accurately [4]. Similarly,\nin precision agriculture, big data analytics are\
    \ applied to understand data-intensive agri-\ncultural processes for decision\
    \ making [6], where analytic tools operate enormous data\nsets [4]. These analytic\
    \ tools consist of data mining, statistics, AI, predictive analytics,\nneural\
    \ language processing, etc. [4]. Big data science usually functions either with\
    \ ML,\ncloud computing, image processing, modeling and simulation, statistical\
    \ analysis, NDVI\nAgriculture 2023, 13, 1593\n7 of 26\nvegetation indices, or\
    \ GIS. These conjugations can discover correlations, patterns, and\ntrends from\
    \ large quantities of data via capturing, storing, exchanging, analyzing, and\n\
    marketing features of this high-performance informatics technology [6]. These\
    \ predictions\nand recommendations assist farmers with handling the upcoming outcomes,\
    \ risks, and\nchallenges in the agricultural industry [4]. Combining the data\
    \ in agricultural production\nprocesses creates traceability of product while\
    \ increasing product quality, including safety\nand taste. As customers are now\
    \ aware of the ecological footprint of agri-products, the\nabove combination supports\
    \ the increase in the demand for agricultural commodities [29],\nadding high market\
    \ value. Recent advancements of high-resolution remote sensing and\nintelligent\
    \ information and communication technologies, including social media (Facebook,\n\
    Twitter, Amazon, Instagram, etc.), have contributed to big data analytics in many\
    \ sectors,\nas well as in many stages in farming, including decision making, weather\
    \ forecasting,\nweather management, disaster management, smart management of resources,\
    \ disease and\npest interruption, and harvesting time predictions [4,6,30]. Moreover,\
    \ big data analytics\naid in implementing real-time forecasting in precision agriculture\
    \ [4]. However, data\nupdating, device security, correctness of data, accuracy\
    \ of data, availability of data, and\nsecurity elements, such as encryption, are\
    \ still barriers when combining big data with\nsmart farming [31]. Invalid data\
    \ can lead farmers to make costly, disruptive decisions\nand actions [5].\n3.2.\
    \ Machine Vision Technology\nPrecise and accurate data and information are the\
    \ driving components of precision\nagriculture. Recently, image analysis has become\
    \ a more reliable data source than man-\nual, labor-intensive, costly data-collecting\
    \ methods [22,32]. Here, machines can read and\nunderstand the real world through\
    \ pixel images and produce accurate site-speciﬁc informa-\ntion [31]. Machines\
    \ with ‘eyes’ in agricultural activities are called machine vision (MV). This,\n\
    also known as agro-vision or the ‘eyes’ of robots, provides non-destructive, robust,\
    \ rapid,\nand steady methods to monitor cultivation processes. MV systems give\
    \ machines their\nvision and judgement capabilities in image processing and data\
    \ extraction [10]. Although\nMV technologies have already been applied successfully\
    \ for crop species identiﬁcation,\ncrop stress detection, crop seed quality assessment,\
    \ weed detection, disease detection, etc.,\nthey are still at the prototype stage.\
    \ Currently, emerging deep-learning (DL) techniques in\ngrowing machine-learning\
    \ (ML) technologies are integrated with MV applications in order\nto develop intelligent\
    \ robots for multispectral imagery analysis and real-time analysis in\nﬁeld variable\
    \ rate applications [10,25]. Commercial smartphones, which are ubiquitous\namong\
    \ the human population, are able to be used in monitoring crop health and stress\n\
    based on MV systems [33].\n3.3. Internet of Things (IoT)\nThe IoT refers to a\
    \ network of interconnected items and technologies [16]. The IoT\nis one of the\
    \ most important technological advancements in precision agriculture and\nsmart\
    \ farming [5]. IoT architecture for agriculture, such as agricultural sensors\
    \ with\nICT and UAV, collects data for precision agriculture [31]. Also, the burgeoning\
    \ IoT and\nmobile data are the core of the fourth industrial revolution [10].\
    \ Meanwhile, advancements\nin communication technologies and wireless networks\
    \ (5G, LoRaWAN, NB-IoT, Sigfox,\nZigBee, and Wi-Fi) have broadened the application\
    \ of the IoT in diverse ﬁelds, such as\nreal-time remote control and high-throughput\
    \ phenotyping, while giving better coverage,\nbandwidth, connection density, and\
    \ end-to-end latency (Table 1) [8]. When it consolidates\nin agriculture together\
    \ with cloud computing, it results in smart farming [6] for various\nscopes of\
    \ livestock monitoring, smart greenhouses, ﬁshery management, and weather\ntracking\
    \ [8]. The IoT can be widely used in all areas of precision agriculture with the\n\
    development of sensors with independent intellectual property rights and the development\n\
    of smart devices, such as intelligent tractors, UAVs, and robots that can replace\

    \ data, which are then uploaded to cloud information support systems to man-\n\
    Agriculture 2023, 13, 1593\n9 of 26\nage [4,13,16,28]. Those sensors can directly\
    \ combine with agricultural robots, autonomous\nplatforms, machines, and weather\
    \ stations for real-time monitoring [4]. With the IoT, UAVs\ncan respond promptly,\
    \ leading to high-quality, high-resolution, and exceptionally reliable\nobservations\
    \ through high-throughput 3D monitoring at different geographical areas. At\n\
    the same time, various kinds of agricultural sensor nodes, autonomous farm vehicles,\
    \ and\nmobile crowd sensing have been put forward based on the IoT for ground\
    \ and undersurface\ncognition [8]. Most IoT sensors in precision agriculture are\
    \ in wireless frameworks [13] or\nlow-power wide-area networks [8] and, hence,\
    \ can be used for on-site analysis [3], as well\nas mass data transfer, without\
    \ any interruptions [29,31]. Still, there are cost, operational,\ntechnical, and\
    \ data management difﬁculties in implementing the IoT in agricultural opera-\n\
    tions [13]. Designing low-cost, energy-efﬁcient, wireless IoT technologies in\
    \ autonomous\napplications is affected by the following dependencies: data latency\
    \ on power consump-\ntion, data scalability on storage and processing cost, and\
    \ data interoperability on cloud\ncompatibility to store and process various kinds\
    \ of data [13].\nDifferent IoT devices are coalesced as networks to achieve high-speed\
    \ data exchang-\ning [4,30]. Therefore, the development of an IoT framework can\
    \ also solve problems with\nbig data [31]. With more advancements, agricultural\
    \ operations like protecting, controlling,\nmonitoring, and detecting can be extended\
    \ using smart phones with the IoT [25]. As an\nexample, time-consuming cattle\
    \ status monitoring has also beneﬁted from the IoT, allowing\nfarmers to monitor\
    \ the health and welfare of animals. Also, weed detection through MV\nprimarily\
    \ consists of deep learning (DL) and image processing [16].\nEdge computing enables\
    \ affordable real-time data transmission in IoT precision agri-\nculture, reducing\
    \ data package size and alleviating strain on centralized cloud resources.\nInternet\
    \ and communication companies leverage their expertise to extend cloud service\n\
    capabilities to edge networks, shaping the edge computing landscape. Pioneers\
    \ like Cisco\nand Huawei have developed comprehensive frameworks and lightweight\
    \ computing sys-\ntems. The IoT connects objects through smart technologies, while\
    \ research explores aerial\nedge–IoT systems for improved convergence speed and\
    \ task completion rates [39–42].\n3.4. Artiﬁcial Intelligence (AI), Machine Learning\
    \ (ML), and Deep Learning (DL)\nAI has a key role in robotics and autonomous systems\
    \ (RASs). The development of\nAI in the IoT has contributed continuous data streams\
    \ [31]. To make agricultural data into\nmeaningful information in decision-making\
    \ data, mining techniques are required. Various\nenvironmental data and farming\
    \ historical records in big data are analyzed using AI, which\nﬁnds patterns that\
    \ are hidden in big data [29]. These discoveries are important in the pest\nidentiﬁcation,\
    \ disease detection, yield prediction, and fertilizing plans [25,31] included\
    \ in\nagricultural decision support systems. AI has noteworthy potential to accommodate\
    \ the\nreduction of food wastage, the improvement of production hygiene, and the\
    \ monitoring\nof machines in many stages of agriculture, such as supply chain,\
    \ agricultural production\npattern, and agricultural production process including\
    \ soil, crop, and water management,\nas well as disease and pest control [4,8].\
    \ Then, AI has the potential to overcome problems\nin conventional farming [31].\n\
    Both ML and DL are subconcepts of AI (Figure 3) [10]. With ML, a computer learns\n\
    independently to improve the performance of AI, which goes through explicit feature\n\
    extraction [6]. ML focuses on the theory, performance, and properties of learning\
    \ systems\nand algorithms, as it is a high-performance informatics technology\
    \ for quantifying and\nunderstanding data-intensive farming processes [6]. On\
    \ the other hand, DL can solve\nproblems with combinations of layers and nonlinear\
    \ functions [10]. To address limitations\nin the practical implementation of robots,\

    \ have signiﬁcantly diverted from these AI, ML, DL, and MV\ntechnologies [10].\

    and blockchain can support overcoming this difﬁculty during the transforming,\
    \ storing,\nand processing of data in the creation of ML models [27,36,41]. Accordingly,\

    \ prediction, crop quality, disease\ndetection, weed detection, species identiﬁcation,\

    \ [6,45]. Common principles of ML techniques\nare clustering, decision trees,\

    \ learning, support vector machines, and Bayesian models [6]. A study\nproved\
    \ that ML was a powerful tool for analyzing data to monitor inputs and outputs\n\
    aiming to optimize plant tissue culture protocols [44].\nSmart farming is technology\
    \ that relies on its implementation with the use of AI and\nthe IoT in cyber-physical\
    \ farm management [28]. According to current applications, AI has\nbeen involved\
    \ in soil management, crop management, disease management, weed control,\netc.\

    \ expert system\nwhere farmers can use their smartphones for disease diagnosis,\
    \ species identiﬁcation, and\nsoil health analysis with the help of mobile apps.\
    \ In addition, AI is a real-time analyzer of\nsatellite images when the progress\
    \ of farming is tracked with satellite imagery [24]. With AI\napplications, precision\
    \ agriculture now has a scientiﬁc background, which helps to make\nprecision agriculture\
    \ more formalized to perform optimal agriculture outputs [29]. In the\nfuture,\
    \ AI may be improved to deal with the dynamic nature of agricultural microclimates,\n\
    as it is now facing difﬁculties ﬁnding a single standard solution for that heterogeneity.\n\
    The existing experience gap between AI researchers and farmers hinders the complete\n\
    understanding of agricultural problems and solutions. To eliminate this obstacle,\
    \ the\nknowledge of farmers, agricultural professionals, and AI researchers should\
    \ be linked.\nIn spite of this, accessibility and privacy protection problems\
    \ when working with huge\namounts of data should be addressed to deliver more\
    \ skillful AI [8,16].\n3.5. Guidance Systems\nGuidance systems use GPS (global\
    \ positioning system) technology to provide farmers\nwith real-time information\
    \ about their equipment locations and herd-grazing locations,\nenabling them to\
    \ optimize ﬁeld operations such as planting, harvesting, and herding [1,12].\n\
    The limited number of satellites, poor signal strengths, and lack of reliable\
    \ connectivity\nwere overcome by introducing a GNSS (global navigation satellite\
    \ system), which then re-\nplaced labor-intensive, time-consuming farm operations\
    \ with more effective methods, such\nas VRA [11,31]. Previously, agricultural\
    \ inputs were performed manually, and during Agri-\nculture 3.0, they were performed\
    \ mechanically using digitalized machines [2]. With rapid\ncommercialization,\
    \ agricultural machinery services have emerged that require efﬁcient\nmanagement\
    \ to prevent overuse or underuse issues. For the understanding of agricultural\n\
    machinery, GNSS plays a crucial role in optimizing effectivity and efﬁciency [46].\
    \ The\nnew trend of GNSS-enabled devices in the fully automated steering of tractions\
    \ is saving\ntime, labor costs, and money [2]. Precision agricultural robots require\
    \ high-resolution\nnavigation solutions [47]. Similarly, agricultural rovers and\
    \ robots are effective only when\nprecisely guided in their actions [45]. Some\
    \ studies introduced DL propagation models in\nGNSS fused with inertial navigation\
    \ data sets for precision agriculture [47]. One example\nis electric seeders with\
    \ optical ﬁber detection technology that were developed and tested\nsuccessfully\
    \ [3]. The new development of software-based farm management solutions\nfor GIS\
    \ encourage the automation of data collection and analysis of supervising, storing,\n\
    decision making, and farm management.\nAgriculture 2023, 13, 1593\n12 of 26\n\
    3.6. Blockchain Technology\nBlockchain is deﬁned as a decentralized, distributed\
    \ database that maintains a con-\ntinuously growing list of ordered records or\
    \ blocks, which was ﬁrst used in cryptocur-\nrency [15,48]. Blockchain offers\
    \ data transparency, immutability, and reliability, which\nimprove the mutual\
    \ trust between various parties in the supply chain [15]. As this technol-\nogy\
    \ eliminates the obstacles of corporations, this was introduced to precision agriculture,\n\
    increasing the easiness of the integration of digital technologies into agriculture.\
    \ This step\nprovides solutions to some technical challenges in smart farming,\
    \ furnishing the remote\nmonitoring and controlling of farm equipment through\
    \ the “IoT applied Greenhouse Moni-\ntoring System” [15,48]. One such challenge\
    \ is an insufﬁcient and insecure infrastructure for\ndata sharing. Another challenge\
    \ is the delay of remote-sensing satellites in detecting the\nvariability of croplands.\
    \ Therefore, as a solution for the above decentralization, anonymity,\nand security\
    \ problems in the IoT in smart farming, blockchain has been proposed, expect-\n\
    ing lightweight, distributed, decentralized, and transparent security and privacy\
    \ [5,48].\nBlockchain can assist with having a reliable, faster, and secure platform\
    \ to monitor farm\noperations, although it is still in its early stages of maturity\
    \ [15,48]. As information can be\ncommunicated securely in a distributed network\
    \ [48], with the help of blockchain this can\nimprove the planning of schedules\
    \ for various agricultural processes, such as irrigation\nwater sharing, energy\
    \ consumption, the incorporation of machines and labors, and tasks\nfor robot\
    \ coalitions and autonomous UAVs [15,28]. Especially in the food supply chain,\n\
    this is a crucial point because of food safety issues, as well as asymmetric and\
    \ fragmented\ninformation occurring related to the insufﬁcient supply chain [1,8,10].\n\
    3.7. Robotics and Autonomous Systems\nMost recently, autonomous farming has involved\
    \ a high degree of the use of robotics,\nsensors, drones, and remote sensing to\
    \ perform various agricultural tasks, such as planting,\nspraying, harvesting,\
    \ and weeding, while reducing labor costs and improving efﬁcient\ndecision making\
    \ [3,45]. RASs are a combination of emerging modern technologies that have\nkey\
    \ applications in both agricultural production processes and production patterns.\
    \ Mobile\nrobots equipped with various sensors, actuators, and ML algorithms are\
    \ key enablers to\nautomatically handle variability and uncertainty in farming\
    \ practices [47]. Key applications\nof RAS in agricultural patterns are in plant\
    \ factories, 3D food printing, and biodiverse\nfarming, whereas autonomous farming,\
    \ aerial monitoring, and automated husbandry\nhave become new applications in\
    \ agricultural production processes [8]. However, agricul-\ntural RASs are required\
    \ to be improved to fulﬁll efﬁcient work with accurate guidance,\nautonomous navigation,\
    \ and accurate detection of dynamic agricultural environments\n(changing appearances,\
    \ growth stages, weather conditions, object overlapping, etc.). Intelli-\ngent\
    \ actions, such as robot-assisted plant phenotyping, fruit counting, fruit harvesting,\
    \ fruit\ncounting, leaf peeling, selective spraying, and 3D mapping, are demonstrated\
    \ and currently\nemployed applications of RASs [8]. Auto-steered agricultural\
    \ vehicles are also used in\nmany ﬁeld operations [3], such as tilling, planting,\
    \ chemical applications, and harvesting.\nThese machines, like harvesters, sprayers,\
    \ tractors, planters, and mechanical weed controls,\nuse guidance systems either\
    \ with light bars [13] or a GNSS [2,20]. These guidance systems\nvisualize the\
    \ positions of equipment to prevent skips and overlaps, which is important in\n\
    variable rate applications.\n3.8. Artiﬁcial Satellites, Unmanned Aerial Vehicles\
    \ (UAVs), and Unmanned Ground\nVehicles (UGVs)\nArtiﬁcial satellites, such as\
    \ American Landsat satellites, the European Sentinel-2 Sys-\ntem, the RapidEye\
    \ constellation satellite system, the GeoEye-1 system, and WorldView-3,\nfor remote\
    \ sensing help to generate remotely accessible data in multispectral forms [8].\n\
    The establishment of these intelligent remote-sensing satellites has provided\
    \ full coverage\nfor collecting agricultural information [8,31,49]. More recently,\
    \ ubiquitous and affordable\ntechnologies such as drones, crews, and aircraft\
    \ have allowed images to be captured closer\nAgriculture 2023, 13, 1593\n13 of\
    \ 26\nto the ground and at a higher frequency, increasing detail and functionality\
    \ [45]. UGVs ac-\nquire high-resolution data for weed identiﬁcation and control,\
    \ selective pesticide spraying,\nsoil analysis, and crop scouting, while scouting\
    \ robots accomplish speciﬁc targets [49] such\nas mechanical weeding (Oz robot),\
    \ spraying (GUSS autonomous sprayer), fertilizing, map-\nping, and seeding (RowBot\
    \ system), as well as vineyard management (VineRobots) [4,50].\nInformation, including\
    \ imagery data generated by satellites, UAVs, and UGVs, is the\nparamount thing\
    \ in precision agriculture, as it supports vegetation patch identiﬁcation,\nweed\
    \ recognition, pest attack detection, observation of environmental stresses, and\
    \ accurate\nclassiﬁcation in VRT [18,45]. Not only that, in other agricultural\
    \ disciplines, such as aqua-\nculture, agroforestry, and forestry, imagery data\
    \ play a considerable role because they can\ncover large areas when gathering\
    \ information, and these data are reproducible [20]. Data\nfrom satellites, UAVs,\
    \ and UGVs are supported by detailed ground survey data processed\nwith ML and\
    \ DL algorithms in order to make them usable and meaningful information [18].\n\
    For example, in forestry, determining forest densities is labor-intensive and\
    \ time-\nconsuming, although it is an important parameter when combatting climate\
    \ change. Re-\ncently, data of tree type distribution could be achieved over a\
    \ wide area of forest with the\nhelp of hyperspectral images and NDVI and RGB\
    \ images from UAVs such as Sentinel-\n2 [13,16]. Likewise, in remote sensing satellites\
    \ and drones play a big role in monitoring\ndeforestation and obtaining accurate\
    \ coverage of vegetative types and classiﬁcation of\ntree species and are more\
    \ effective than other UAV or LiDAR data [14,34]. Although there\nare limitations,\
    \ drone and remotely piloted aircraft usage is dramatically increasing while\n\
    providing precise information for precision agriculture through hyperspectral\
    \ sensors,\nmultispectral cameras, and other novel technologies [14]. This is\
    \ a cost-effective, promising\nmethod for monitoring large-scale farms or crop\
    \ lands [4], as well as forest areas [14].\n3.9. High-throughput Phenotyping\n\
    High-throughput phenotyping has emerged as a promising approach to enhance\nprecision\
    \ agriculture by allowing the rapid and accurate measurement of plant traits [51]\n\
    quantitatively and qualitatively [22,52]. Accurate and high-throughput plant phenotyping\n\
    is important for accelerating crop breeding [52]. This technique uses advanced\
    \ technologies\nsuch as remote sensing [40,42], spectral imaging [41], and robotics\
    \ [53] to collect large\namounts of data on plant characteristics, such as growth\
    \ rate, yield, disease resistance, and\nmorphology [51,54,55]. By collecting and\
    \ analyzing these data, farmers can gain insights\ninto how their crops are performing\
    \ and make more informed decisions about things like\nfertilization, irrigation,\
    \ harvesting, and pest management [22,54]. High-throughput pheno-\ntyping can\
    \ also help breeders to develop new crop varieties that are better adapted to\
    \ local\ngrowing conditions and can produce higher yields (Figure 4) [51]. A full\
    \ range of visible\nand near-infrared hyperspectral data enables ML techniques\
    \ such as LSR (least squares\nregression) to predict speciﬁc biochemical and physicochemical\
    \ traits beyond simple vege-\ntative indices [56]. ML-based precision agriculture\
    \ systems have AI background [52,54],\nand therefore, when detecting diseases,\
    \ pests, nutrient deﬁciency, and weeds, stressed\nresponses are detected using\
    \ high-quality images generated with UGV or UAV remote\nsensing, hyperspectral\
    \ imaging, and satellite imaging to support high-throughput pheno-\ntyping [57].\
    \ Ultimately, high-throughput phenotyping has the potential to revolutionize\n\
    agriculture by enabling more the precise, real-time, and efﬁcient monitoring of\
    \ farming\npractices that can improve crop productivity, reduce environmental\
    \ impacts, and increase\nfood security [54].\nAgriculture 2023, 13, 1593\n14 of\

    \ satellite imaging to support \nhigh-throughput phenotyping [57]. Ultimately,\
    \ high-throughput phenotyping has the po-\ntential to revolutionize agriculture\
    \ by enabling more the precise, real-time, and eﬃcient \nmonitoring of farming\
    \ practices that can improve crop productivity, reduce environmen-\ntal impacts,\
    \ and increase food security [54]. \n \nFigure 4. Importance of high-throughput\
    \ phenotyping in agriculture. \nThe traditional methods of plant breeding have\
    \ limitations in terms of time, cost, and \naccuracy. HTP, on the other hand,\
    \ uses nondestructive and rapid methods to gather data \non a large number of\
    \ plants, allowing breeders to identify traits of interest more eﬃciently \n[58].\
    \ A study by Yang et al. (2017) [59] described using high-throughput phenotyping\
    \ \n(HTP) and quantitative trait locus (QTL) mapping to investigate the genetic\
    \ architecture \nof maize plant growth. The authors collected data on various\
    \ traits related to plant growth, \nsuch as plant height, leaf area, and biomass,\
    \ using HTP techniques, such as imaging and \nspectroscopy [59]. Unmanned aerial\
    \ systems (UASs) have brought about a revolutionary \nchange in ﬁeld high-throughput\
    \ phenotyping by providing a platform for diﬀerent sen-\nsors to collect remote-sensing\
    \ data in ﬁeld-scale trials. These sensors include regular RGB \ncameras, multispectral-imaging\
    \ cameras, hyperspectral-imaging cameras, thermal-imag-\ning sensors, and light\
    \ detection and ranging (LiDAR) sensors that enable the nondestruc-\ntive estimation\
    \ of plant traits, such as yield, biomass, height, and leaf area index. This is\
    \ a \nsigniﬁcant advancement in agriculture, allowing for the high-throughput\
    \ phenotyping of \ncrops. In comparison to ground-based sensors, UASs increase\
    \ the frequency and through-\nput for phenotyping, while being cost-eﬀective and\
    \ providing high-resolution images as \ncompared to satellite-based techniques.\
    \ The phenotypic traits can be used to select crops \nwith high yield and strong\
    \ stress resistance, such as disease and salt resistance, ultimately \nleading\
    \ to improved production [60]. \nAs technology advances, the future of high-throughput\
    \ phenotyping (HTP) appears \npromising. Multiple HTP technologies, such as drones,\
    \ sensors, and artiﬁcial intelligence, \ncan be integrated to facilitate more\
    \ eﬃcient and accurate phenotyping, which can aid \nbreeders in identifying desirable\
    \ traits and making better selections. HTP can also be used \nfor precision agriculture,\

    \ concerns and climate change, the role of\nmobile networks in fostering sustainability\
    \ and innovation is questioned. Sectors like smart\nagriculture, forestry, biodiversity\

    \ Evaluating the capabilities of 5G and 6G networks, including\ncurrent and future\
    \ support, is essential for identifying use cases and the requirements in\nthese\
    \ domains [34]. As an example, a study in Thailand designed telematics-equipped\n\
    tractors to assist farmers in efﬁciently managing their machinery, optimizing\
    \ performance\nand enhancing overall productivity. In addition to improved management\
    \ capabilities,\nthese tractors offered features such as theft prevention, effective\
    \ maintenance monitoring,\nand machine operation tracking [62].\n4. Studies of\
    \ Successful Precision Agriculture Proposals and Implementations\nThe article\
    \ [63] reviewed advancements in automated fruit-harvesting robots for\nsweet peppers\
    \ and apples, highlighting the successful implementation of a sweet-pepper-\n\
    harvesting robot called ‘Harvey’, which effectively addressed detection, grasp\
    \ selection,\nand manipulation challenges. Similarly, the apple-harvesting robot\
    \ utilized a picking\nmanipulator and a catching manipulator, along with machine\
    \ vision and prioritization algo-\nrithms, for efﬁcient harvesting. The article\
    \ emphasized interdisciplinary collaboration for\nfurther advancements in automated\
    \ harvesting systems and the importance of intelligent\nsystems like deep learning\
    \ and crop management software for enhancing productivity and\nsustainability\
    \ in modern agriculture. Field trials were conducted with Harvey for sweet\npeppers\
    \ in Australia, while robotic picking systems for apples were tested in a Washing-\n\
    ton orchard in the U.S. [64,65]. Israel has successfully implemented autonomous\
    \ robotic\ntechnology in their crop ﬁelds, paving the way for the commercial use\
    \ of AI harvesters.\nTevel Aerobotics Technologies developed an autonomous fruit-picking\
    \ system that utilized\nﬂying robots tethered to an autonomous vehicle, enabling\
    \ accurate fruit picking, extended\nwork hours, and additional tasks like tree\
    \ thinning and pruning. This system addressed\nlabor shortages, reduced fruit\
    \ production costs by approximately 30%, provided real-time\nupdates to farmers\

    industry. Tevel plans to introduce its innovative solution to the global market,\
    \ catering to\nfruit farmers worldwide and contributing to the growing agricultural\
    \ robotics sector [66].\nSenapathy et al. introduced the IoTSNA-CR model from\
    \ their study, which leveraged\nIoT technology to classify soil nutrients and\
    \ provide crop recommendations, aiming to\noptimize fertilizer usage and maximize\
    \ productivity for farmers. The implementation of\nAI harvesters in Israel showcases\
    \ the potential of artiﬁcial intelligence, machine learning,\ncloud services,\
    \ sensors, and automation for delivering real-time information and support\nto\
    \ farmers. The proposed IoTSNA-CR model incorporated IoT sensors, cloud storage,\n\
    machine-learning techniques, and an optimized algorithm (MSVM-DAG-FFO) to achieve\n\
    high accuracy in soil analysis. The model allowed farmers to maintain soil information\
    \ in\nthe cloud, reducing costs and improving productivity. Experimental validation\

    \ in olive groves was proposed by [49], with a cooperative robot archi-\ntecture\
    \ using UAS and UGV systems evaluating vision-based navigation algorithms and\n\
    augmented reality tags for return and landing. The results demonstrated the feasibility\
    \ of\nthe architecture for automating inspections and improving pest control policies.\
    \ Challenges\nremain in addressing real-world conditions and optimizing image\

    \ organic\nfertilizer mixer was developed in [68] based on IoT technology to reduce\
    \ labor costs and\nenhance efﬁciency. The improved mixer allowed remote monitoring,\
    \ updates, and alerts,\naiming to further streamline the organic fertilizer-mixing\
    \ process. A harvesting robot\nsystem for cherry tomatoes in greenhouses was developed\
    \ by the Beijing Research Center\nof Intelligent Equipment for Agriculture. This\
    \ new harvesting robot system for cherry\ntomatoes was designed featuring a railed-type\

    \ tests demonstrated an average picking time of 12 s per\nbunch of tomatoes with\
    \ a success rate of 83% [69]. Also, X. Jin et al. [70] designed a small-\nsized\
    \ vegetable seed electric seeder with power drive and optical ﬁber detection technology,\n\
    providing high efﬁciency and precision by monitoring sowing conditions in real-time\
    \ for\ndifferent seed sizes (Table 2).\nThe Cooperative Heterogeneous Robots for\

    \ cooperative UAS and UGV system for olive\ngrove inspection that veriﬁed the\
    \ feasibility and robustness of the multiple-cooperative\nrobot architecture in\

    \ an approach for dynamic robot coalition that combined fuzzy coalition games\n\
    and smart contracts to form a dynamic and trusted coalition. It enabled the collection\n\
    and dissemination of information from robot sensors in a shared space. Integration\
    \ of the\nIoT with blockchain allows the continuous tracking of food in precision\

    \ agriculture is a strategy that\nuses advanced technologies, like sensors, remote\

    \ increase productivity, proﬁtability, and sustainabil-\nity. Machine-learning\
    \ models have been integrated with IoT sensors to develop intelligent\nsensors\

    \ cultivars, especially considering the escalating crop damage\ncaused by drought\
    \ and global warming.\nAnother study asserted precision agricultural applications\
    \ in agroforestry. Tree species\nidentiﬁcation and classiﬁcation is important\
    \ when combatting climate change, as well as\nmonitoring ecosystem health 17.\
    \ Researchers used images from SENTINEL-2 to propose\nmethods to determine tree\
    \ type distribution in a wide forest area using UAV images [14,17].\nThey effectively\
    \ distinguished evergreen, deciduous trees, and grassland areas, aiding in\nforest\
    \ planning and preparing for climate change impacts. Ma et al. [14] used a random\n\
    forest classiﬁer with satellite images to improve texture feature separation among\
    \ tree\nspecies. The overall classiﬁcation achieved 86.49% accuracy and a 0.83\
    \ Kappa coefﬁcient,\nalthough altitude, slope, and aspect inﬂuenced tree distribution.\
    \ These outcomes were\nimportant in species classiﬁcation and biodiversity monitoring,\
    \ as well as in informing\ninventory estimation [14].\nAn evaluation of soybean\
    \ wildﬁre prediction via hyperspectral transmission imag-\ning was performed with\
    \ Python, which detected bacterial wildﬁre in soybean leaves\nwhere different\
    \ varieties exhibited distinct spectral signatures. This allowed the precise\n\
    detection and differentiation of healthy and diseased plants effectively with\
    \ high accu-\nracy (97.19% and 95.69%) in early disease detection, conﬁrming its\
    \ usefulness in soybean\nplant monitoring [32].\nAasim et al. [44] focused on\
    \ establishing the efﬁcient and reproducible in vitro re-\ngeneration of common\
    \ beans through a combined approach of in vitro regeneration and\nmachine-learning\
    \ algorithms. ML models, particularly ANN algorithms, were used for\nprediction\
    \ and optimization. The ML and ANN models demonstrated superior perfor-\nmances,\
    \ proving their efﬁcacy in analyzing and optimizing complex conditions in plant\n\
    tissue culture protocols for breeding purposes.\nA computer vision and deep-learning-enabled\
    \ weed detection model for precision\nagriculture was proposed in [25] integrating\
    \ computer vision, DL, the IoT and a smartphone.\nThe proposed CVDL-WDC technique\
    \ combined multiscale object detection and ELM-based\nweed classiﬁcation. The\
    \ results showed improved outcomes over recent approaches, and\nfuture extensions\
    \ included integration with IoT and smartphones.\nAt the same time, a novel procedure\
    \ involving machine learning and UAV-based\nimagery was developed to accurately\
    \ identify crops and weeds, offering potential integra-\ntion into autonomous\
    \ weed management systems and contributing to improved precision\nagriculture\
    \ practices with reduced resource consumption [45].\nAt Sairam Institute of Technology\
    \ in India, a ﬂood detection system based on the\nIoT, big data, and a convolutional\
    \ deep neural network (CDNN) was developed [30].\nThe CDNN algorithm demonstrated\
    \ superior accuracy, achieving an impressive accu-\nracy of 93.23%, a sensitivity\
    \ of 91.43%, a speciﬁcity of 91.56%, a precision of 92.23%,\na recall of 90.36%,\
    \ and an F-score of 91.28% with a data set of 500. The ﬂood detec-\ntion system\
    \ outperformed existing methods and holds potential for further enhancement\n\
    through the integration of IoT devices and advanced algorithms, ensuring improved\
    \ ﬂood\ndetection capabilities.\nAgriculture 2023, 13, 1593\n18 of 26\nIn order\
    \ to alleviate the strain on agri-food production, the introduction of alternative\n\
    nutrient sources can be explored, particularly through the utilization of cultured\
    \ meat and\n3D-printed meat as substitutes for traditional animal meats, thus\
    \ reducing the demand on\nanimal husbandry. In China, the production of lab-grown\
    \ meat using muscle stem cells\nnecessitated edible 3D scaffolds created through\
    \ electrohydrodynamic (EHD) printing,\nshowcasing the signiﬁcant potential of\
    \ prolamin scaffolds for cultivating cultured meat [74].\nSimilarly, the construction\
    \ of 3D-printed meat analogs from plant-based proteins has been\nconducted, improving\
    \ the printing performance of soy protein- and gluten-based pastes\nfacilitated\
    \ by rice protein. This study examined the rheological properties and printing\n\
    performances of edible inks made from soy protein isolate (SPI), wheat gluten\
    \ (WG),\nand rice protein (RP). Increasing the proportion of rice protein improved\
    \ the 3D-printing\nperformance, holding potential for the 3D printing of plant-based\
    \ foods and constructing\nmeat analogs simulating real meat properties [75].\n\
    Several studies have shown why the adaption rate of these studies is slow, and\n\
    one case study conducted in Chumphon Province, Thailand, by Kasetsart University\n\
    examined the adoption of smart farming technology among durian farmers, highlighting\n\
    that factors such as age, occupation, access to extension services, and farm size\
    \ inﬂuenced\ntechnology adoption, with younger farmers having larger farms being\
    \ more inclined to\nadopt technology, resulting in decreased labor and fertilizer\
    \ expenses, which emphasized\nthe importance of providing continuous training\
    \ and promoting extension services for\nsustainable adoption [76].\nTable 2. Studies\

    \ Agriculture\nHigh-tech technologies from the fourth industrial revolution have\
    \ the potential to\nrevolutionize the agriculture industry, enabling more efﬁcient\
    \ and sustainable practices\nAgriculture 2023, 13, 1593\n20 of 26\nwhile improving\
    \ productivity and reducing resource wastage. The adaptation of these\nintelligent,\
    \ advanced technologies in precision agriculture is still in its early stages,\
    \ and\nas such, there exist several barriers (Table 3) that must be addressed\
    \ to facilitate the\ntransformation of precision agriculture. However, it is essential\
    \ to carefully consider the\nspeciﬁc requirements, challenges, and implementation\
    \ considerations for each technology\nin the context of the agricultural operation\
    \ at hand.\nA lack of interdisciplinary skills is one of the major roadblocks,\
    \ as big data engineers,\ndata analysts, and data scientists do not have an agricultural\
    \ background. On the other\nhand, farmers with long experience and practical knowledge\
    \ are not educated enough to\nhandle high technology like artiﬁcial intelligence\
    \ [8]. The production and development\ncosts of high-tech applications and the\
    \ capital for establishing them in real-world agriculture\nare also high [78].\
    \ This high cost of the production and implementation of advanced\ntechnologies\
    \ may render them inaccessible to small-scale farmers, who may lack the\nﬁnancial\
    \ resources to invest in such technologies [79].\nFurthermore, the unavailability\
    \ of affordable technologies for small-scale farmers may\ncreate a digital divide,\
    \ where only large-scale, educated farmers may be able to beneﬁt from\nsuch technologies\
    \ [20,80]. In the unequal distribution of resources in the world, it is difﬁcult\n\
    for certain groups to reach for such new technological inventions. The implementation\n\
    of precision agriculture trends in many developing agricultural countries has\
    \ become a\ndifﬁcult task due to lack of necessary funds, lack of conﬁdence in\
    \ the technologies, lack of\nproper infrastructure, lack of necessary resources,\
    \ etc. [8,76,78,81]. Additionally, the lack of\nsufﬁcient energy in rural areas\
    \ hinders the use of new technologies, even as science strives\nto develop wireless\
    \ power transfer methods and ambient or on-site energy-generating\nmethods [8].\
    \ Furthermore, low digital literacy and unequal accessibility to digital tech-\n\
    nologies in rural areas, coupled with connectivity issues, pose signiﬁcant challenges\
    \ in\nestablishing sustainable intelligent technologies in agricultural processes\
    \ [20,79,82].\nLimited computer power, storage capacity, and processing speed\
    \ and high energy\nconsumption by batteries are some technical obstacles in precision\
    \ agricultural adapta-\ntions [43], especially when dealing with big data. In\
    \ addition, collecting and analyzing\ndata from agricultural operations may raise\
    \ concerns about data privacy and security [4].\nThese data are heterogenous and,\
    \ when transferring and storing vast amounts, software\nplatforms from private\
    \ companies are needed. This reveals some ownership controversies\nof data [78].\
    \ Blockchain interoperability, privacy problems, data leakage, cyber terrorism,\n\
    and some nonrepudiation issues associated with big data are still difﬁculties\
    \ in precision\nagriculture [5,8,78,83], thereby causing farmers to be reluctant\
    \ to share their data with\nthird-party service providers [4,16]. In many areas\
    \ where agriculture is practiced, reli-\nable internet connectivity, which is\
    \ essential for collecting, transmitting, and analyzing\ndata, may not be readily\
    \ available [7] and, thus, may affect the absorption capacities of\nnovel technologies\
    \ [80].\nThe implementation of trending technologies requires technical expertise\
    \ that may\nbe unavailable in some regions, leading to job displacement and unemployment\
    \ as new\ntechnologies increase the demand for highly skilled laborers while decreasing\
    \ opportunities\nfor nonskilled workers. This has implications for both small-scale\
    \ and family commercial\nfarmers [8,9,20,79]. To effectively use these technologies,\
    \ farmers and service providers\nmay need training. However, different technologies\
    \ may not be compatible with each other\nor with existing agricultural machinery\
    \ and equipment, which could limit the adoption\nof advanced technologies in precision\
    \ agriculture [2,8,84]. Furthermore, the presence of\nbias and discrimination\
    \ intertwined with information technology, education, risk-taking\nattitudes,\
    \ and western power structures constitute formidable obstacles, hindering the\n\
    equitable dissemination and advancement of smart-farming technologies, particularly\n\
    within developing nations [80,85]. This highlights the need for policies on data\
    \ sharing that\ncater to both the public and farming industries and are sufﬁcient\
    \ to ensure data security [20].\nAgriculture 2023, 13, 1593\n21 of 26\nTable 3.\

    \ years, the agricultural sector has recognized the potential beneﬁts of adopting\n\
    new digital technologies. However, the slow rate of adaptation can be attributed\
    \ to several\nroadblocks and uncertainties associated with these advancements.\
    \ Despite the challenges,\nthere is a growing demand for organic foods [78], leading\
    \ to a shift from sustainable\nagriculture to smart organic farming. To capitalize\
    \ on this emerging opportunity, certain\nsteps need to be taken.\nOne crucial\
    \ aspect is bridging the gap between expertise personnel and farmers. Pro-\nviding\
    \ better education, along with vocational training on novel technological applications,\n\
    can empower farmers to make effective use of new technologies [20,78]. Governments\
    \ can\nplay a signiﬁcant role by creating physical, economic, legal, and social\
    \ infrastructure that\nsupports the establishment of precision agriculture. Investments\
    \ in energy infrastructure\nand communication infrastructure, internet connectivity,\
    \ service markets, consultancy\nservices, and credit markets can instill trust\
    \ and willingness among farmers to embrace\nthese technologies [2,20,81].\nTo\
    \ further enhance precision agriculture, addressing the lack of professional agri-\n\
    cultural sensors is paramount. The design of high-quality, high-resolution, and\
    \ reliable\nsensors powered by the IoT that are speciﬁcally tailored for the agricultural\
    \ production\nenvironment and the monitoring of plant and animal physiological\
    \ signs is essential [8].\nMoreover, integrating wireless power transfer options\
    \ can eliminate the need for frequent\nbattery replacements. However, special\
    \ attention should be given to enabling underground\nor underwater transmission\
    \ capabilities [8]. At the same time, on-site energy generation\nwith renewable\
    \ solar power or biogas energy can be considered comparatively to long\ndistance\
    \ energy transfer [77]. Although capital investment is high for establishment,\
    \ it is\nmore proﬁtable than grid power.\nCross-technology communication is another\
    \ crucial aspect that needs to be addressed.\nMachine vision for animal monitoring,\
    \ the development of smart phone applications for the\nreal-time tracking of spatial\
    \ and temporal variations, and the utilization of 6G mobile net-\nworks are promising\
    \ avenues for generating valuable data and informed decisions [34,83].\nAdditionally,\
    \ the emergence of new agricultural systems such as smart hydroponics with\nthe\
    \ IoT and advancements in breeding technologies with DL and ML technologies con-\n\
    tribute to the overall progress of precision agriculture.\nFuture advancements\
    \ in precision agricultural technologies hold great promise for\nthe agricultural\
    \ sector. Overcoming the existing roadblocks and uncertainties is essential\n\
    to unlocking the full potential of these technologies. By focusing on education,\
    \ infras-\ntructure development, sensor technology, communication systems, and\
    \ novel agricultural\napproaches, we can pave the way for a more efﬁcient, sustainable,\
    \ and productive future\nin agriculture.\n7. Conclusions\nPrecision agriculture,\
    \ now part of Agriculture 4.0, harnesses the power of digitalization\nfor improved\
    \ farming management. The integration of Industry 4.0 technologies has led to\n\
    notable trends, such as drones, GPS technology, data analytics, and artiﬁcial\
    \ intelligence,\nenabling informed decision making in farming practices. Despite\
    \ these advancements,\nachieving a fully integrated agricultural management system\
    \ that comprehensively ad-\ndresses the complexities of the ﬁeld requires further\
    \ studies and innovations. Crucially,\nthe development of adaptive and predictive\
    \ information systems that effectively integrate\ndiverse data sources is essential\
    \ for ensuring sustainable and intelligent precision agri-\nculture. While precision\
    \ agriculture offers numerous beneﬁts, it also poses challenges for\nits widespread\
    \ adoption. The initial investment in technology, concerns related to data\nprivacy,\
    \ and compatibility issues with existing farming systems can be signiﬁcant barriers\n\
    for small-scale farmers. Moreover, the scalability and adaptability of these technologies\
    \ to\ndifferent farming conditions may limit their applicability in certain regions.\
    \ Overcoming\nAgriculture 2023, 13, 1593\n23 of 26\nthese challenges necessitates\
    \ the implementation of education and training programs to\nequip farmers with\
    \ the necessary skills to leverage these technologies effectively.\nThis review\

    \ and is \ncharacterised by monsoon gaps. Rainfall prediction is very \ncrucial\
    \ for irrigation management to enhance farm productivity.. \nThis article presents\
    \ a portable rainfall prediction device which \ncan be carried to fields. In the\
    \ field by sensing the current \natmospheric \nparameters \nlike \ntemperature,\
    \ \nhumidity, \natmospheric pressure along with the current status of the sky\
    \ to \nknow the types of clouds present and gives the chances of \nrainfall. It\
    \ is a novel approach in terms of portability of the \ndevice and it will give\
    \ the prediction based on current \ninformation at a particular location by combining\
    \ the predictions \nfrom the model of image processing of the clouds using deep\
    \ \nlearning and the currently sensed weather parameters are \nprocessed using\
    \ machine learning without using WIFI or internet \nconnection by providing Edge\
    \ analytics where the data \nprocessing, rainfall prediction, and decision making\
    \ is carried \nout locally on the device without any backend servers or cloud\
    \ \nplatform which will be very useful for the people like farmers \nwho don’t\
    \ have accessibility to internet in villages. The farmers \ncan decide before\
    \ every irrigation schedule, based on the \nprediction to what extent the crops\
    \ can be irrigated. If chances of \nrain are very low 90% irrigation can be carried\
    \ out, If chances of \nrain are predicted as low to medium then 40 to 60% irrigation\
    \ \ncan be done and if the prediction says medium to heavy rainfall \nthen no\

    \ backbone of the Indian \neconomy, accounting for roughly 15% of national GDP\
    \ \nand about half of India's population is entirely or partially \nreliant on\
    \ agriculture and related activities for their living. \nIndia is one of the top\
    \ 15 agricultural commodity exporters in \nthe world. India is also facing an\
    \ exponential population \ngrowth that demands a great need for food in the future.\
    \ \nTraditional agricultural practices, on the other hand, must be \nmodified\
    \ with the help of technology to meet the increasing \ndemand for good quality\
    \ food to meet the future need of the \npopulation. Agriculture development will\
    \ benefit not just \nfarmers, but also a huge portion of the people living in\
    \ rural \nareas that are actively involved in agriculture or indirectly tied \n\
    to agriculture as consumers. More efficient production \nmethods would produce\
    \ a more conjugative environment in \nthe country for the overall development\
    \ of the economy and \ngreater agricultural income. Small and marginal farmers\
    \ will \nbe empowered via education, reforms, and development, \nresulting in\
    \ better, more efficient, and stronger Indian \nagriculture. New production and\
    \ marketing models, as well as \nraising awareness and providing education to\
    \ farmers in \nvillages, will aid in the sector's development and, more \ncrucially,\
    \ improve the economic situation of impoverished \nfarmers [1]. \nPrecision agriculture\
    \ is the most promising approach to \nfarm management in today's era, as it uses\
    \ technology Internet \nof Things (IoT) to monitor the spatial and temporal parameters\
    \ \nof the field and ensures that input resources such as water, \nfertilizers,\
    \ pesticides, and other chemicals are applied to the \ncrops at the right time,\
    \ in the right place, and the right amount. \nTraditional agricultural surveillance\
    \ tactics were modified by \nIoT-based agriculture applications, which quickly\
    \ provided \nquantitative data with great temporal and spatial resolution. \n\
    Ecological data is collected in real-time from the surroundings \nof the agriculture\
    \ field using various sensors installed in the \nfields, which will be communicated\
    \ and analyzed to determine \nvarious problems. This collected data is analyzed\
    \ and \nprocessed to extract the proper information and is utilized to \ndecide\
    \ on various tasks performed in the field to automate the \nagriculture \nprocess\
    \ \nto \novercome \ncertain \ndifficulties. \nMultidisciplinary methods that combine\
    \ remote sensing, \nmodelling, and deep learning techniques can aid in the \n\
    improvement of agricultural operations and, as a result, crop \noutput [2]. \n\
    Collecting data manually from a big field is challenging, \nand it results in\
    \ fluctuation when compared to inaccurate field \nmeasurements. Wireless sensor\
    \ networks (WSN) help in \nintegrating various sensors in the field for the collection\
    \ of \ndifferent parameters from the field and environment. Various \nfarm monitoring\
    \ applications like crop selection according to \nthe soil in the farm, soil monitoring\
    \ to make zones with \nsimilarity to promote multi cropping and to assist farmers\
    \ with \nvarious decision making like when and in what amount of \nfertilizer\
    \ to be used, when to irrigate the crop, early disease \npredictions etc. are\
    \ possible due to several emerging \ntechnologies like WSN, Deep learning, Machine\
    \ learning, IoT \netc. \nAgriculture utilizes 85 percent of the world's available\
    \ \nfreshwater resources, and this fraction is progressively rising \nin parallel\
    \ with population expansion and rising food demand. \nAs a result, there is a\
    \ need to develop more efficient methods \nto ensure that water resources are\
    \ properly utilized in \nirrigation. New innovative plans in this direction are\
    \ needed in \n(IJACSA) International Journal of Advanced Computer Science and\
    \ Applications, \nVol. 13, No. 5, 2022 \n268 | P a g e  \nwww.ijacsa.thesai.org\
    \ \nresearch to boost productivity and water management through \nnovel irrigation\
    \ techniques [3]. \nProper irrigation aids in the growth of crops, landscape \n\
    maintenance, and revegetation of disturbed soils. In addition \nto frost protection,\
    \ weed suppression in grain fields, and soil \nconsolidation prevention, irrigation\
    \ plays important role in \nhealthy crop cultivation. Irrigation management is\
    \ required \neven in places with abundant rainfall to boost farm \nproductivity.\
    \ Monsoon gaps are a feature of Indian rainfall. As \na result, sometimes it won't\
    \ rain for two or more weeks during \nthe rainy season, causing agricultural damage\
    \ in the absence \nof irrigation. \nIn the near future, proper integration of\
    \ advanced \nagricultural practices based on various technologies and \nadaptation\
    \ by rural communities should be secured. Climate \nchange will have extensive\
    \ consequences in the next decades. \nAs a result, laws, and practices must be\
    \ devised to protect \nfarming communities, particularly small landholders, from\
    \ the \nimmediate losses caused by extreme events [4]. \nThe most important reasons\
    \ for India's need for perfect \nirrigation are: \n Chaotic nature of climate.\
    \ \n Uneven Rainfall Distribution. \n Optimized use of water resources to meet\
    \ crop needs \nand soil requirements. \n To maximize crop production. \n To\
    \ manage supplement supply even in areas with \nabundant rainfall. \nIrrigation\
    \ scheduling is managed by rainfall forecast based \non weather conditions, which\
    \ determines the amount of water \nto be supplied by irrigation to maintain the\
    \ threshold value of \nwater (moisture) required by the crop at any given time.\
    \ \nAutomatic irrigation scheduling systems have replaced \nmanual irrigation\
    \ based on soil water monitoring. While \nimplementing, the plant evapotranspiration\
    \ was taken into \naccount, which was based on many climatic characteristics \n\
    such as humidity, wind speed, solar radiation, and even crop \naspects such as\
    \ stage of growth, plant density, soil attributes, \nand pest. \nWeather forecasting\
    \ does an excellent job of providing \npeople with early warnings and alerts about\
    \ severe climate \nchange events, however, due to a lack of infrastructure, people\
    \ \nin remote regions such as villages do not receive information \non time due\
    \ to the absence of internet, and forecasting is not \nvery accurate for any given\
    \ location. As a result, this portable \ndevice may be taken anywhere and used\
    \ to anticipate the state \nof rainfall by sensing current atmospheric characteristics\
    \ and \npresent sky status to identify clouds related to rainfall. \nMost of the\
    \ farmers are living in rural areas and are not \nable to access the internet\
    \ and weather forecasting applications \nat remote locations like fields. This\
    \ article presents a portable \nweather station that uses a novel approach that\
    \ predicts the \nintensity of rainfall as No Rain to very Low Rain, Low to \n\
    Medium Rain or, Medium to high Rain based on the combined \napproach of identifying\
    \ types of clouds present in the sky and \nsome important weather parameters such\
    \ as temperature, \nhumidity, and atmospheric pressure using affordable sensors\
    \ \nthat are within the reach of farmers and will work \nindependently of WIFI\
    \ or internet. \nThis device consists of Raspberry pi with an integrated \ncamera\
    \ for taking digital images of the sky to know the type of \nclouds present in\
    \ the sky along with some atmospheric \nparameter sensors like DHT11 sensor, BMP\
    \ 180 etc. to sense \ntemperature, humidity, and atmospheric pressure and will\
    \ give \nthe prediction on rainfall by both approach from cloud status \nand sensed\
    \ atmospheric parameters. Improvement in crop \nproduction and planning by using\
    \ local climate prediction \nwithout the internet can definitely help an individual\
    \ farmer to \nincrease his yield by managing the irrigation cycle by \navoiding\
    \ irrigating the crop with extra water or less water. \nA. Novelty \nThe proposed\
    \ work is distinguished from previous work by \nits multi-modal integration of\
    \ two separate techniques. The \nmajority of previous research has proposed solutions\
    \ in \nirrigation management by providing automatic irrigation based \non either\
    \ atmospheric parameters collected from nearby \nweather stations / using sensors\
    \ or only by capturing sky \nimages, but the proposed system takes advantage of\
    \ both \napproaches where real-time atmospheric parameters on the \nfields are\
    \ sensed using sensors and the sky image at that \nlocation is captured to provide\
    \ better rainfall predictions \nwithout using WIFI or internet so that it can\
    \ be used by \nfarmers or people at remote locations. Due to the global \nshortage\
    \ of clean water resources, it is critical that they be \nutilised to their full\
    \ capacity, which may be accomplished by \nutilising water resources wisely and\
    \ paying equal attention to \nirrigation water management. This device will help\
    \ farmers to \ntake decision before every irrigation scheduled cycle to what \n\
    extent the field should be irrigated by predicting the intensity \nof rainfall\
    \ as low, medium or high. \nThe rest of the article is arranged as follows: Section\
    \ 2 \ndescribes relevant work, Section 3 discusses the proposed \nsystem in detail,\
    \ Section 4 discusses methods and \nmethodology, Section 5 discusses findings,\
    \ and Section 6 \ndiscusses conclusion and future work. \nII. RELATED WORK \n\
    Weather conditions play an important role in both \nirrigation requirements and\
    \ crop performance. Researchers \nused various weather parameters and different\
    \ technologies \nand algorithms to predict the weather to know the status of \n\
    climate to control the use of water in Irrigation. \nThe evapotranspiration of\
    \ water in the soil is affected by \ntemperature and humidity. The thermic level\
    \ of the \natmosphere is described as air temperature, which is generally \nmeasured\
    \ in Celsius, Fahrenheit, or Kelvin degrees. It is the \nmost closely observed\
    \ weather metric. The presence of water \nvapour in the air is known as humidity.\
    \ The proportion of \nwater vapour in the air is expressed in percentage (%).\
    \ The \nother major parameters considered by the researchers are \nluminosity\
    \ and is defined as the brightness or intensity of \nlight. Lux is the unit of\
    \ measurement. It causes more water \n(IJACSA) International Journal of Advanced\

    \ solar \nradiation. The most important parameter is the rainfall or \namount\
    \ of precipitation that influences whether or not \nirrigation is necessary as\
    \ well as the amount of water to be \nused if irrigation is required. The author\
    \ in [5] presents a \ndetailed survey on the IoT systems and recent sensors used\
    \ in \nan automatic smart irrigation system in Precision Agriculture \nand discussed\
    \ various weather monitoring parameters, sensors, \nsoil characteristics. The\
    \ author in [6] proposed an automated \nirrigation system which starts the motor\
    \ and water is supplied \nonly if the level of soil moisture goes below the threshold\
    \ and \nthe amount of water supply is managed by considering the \nweather parameters\
    \ temperature and humidity sensed by the \nsensor to predict the type of climate\
    \ as sunny (no rain), cloudy \n(rain chances <50%) or rainy (rain chances>50%).\
    \ In [7] to \nadd intelligence to the existing idea of automatic irrigation \n\
    systems, an autonomous irrigation system is proposed that \nemploys machine learning\
    \ and predictive algorithms to predict \nthe status of rainfall using historical\
    \ climate data for the \namount of water to be used by calculating the time of\
    \ motor to \nbe ON based on the soil moisture value for each zone \nseparately.\
    \ Work proposed in [8] is the development of an \nefficient IoT architecture that\
    \ monitors soil, microclimate, and \nwater parameters, as well as performing proper\
    \ irrigation \nmanagement based on challenges studied in irrigated farmland \n\
    of Ethiopia, Kenya, and South Africa. For educated decision \nmaking and effective\
    \ operation of the irrigation management \nsystem, indigenous agricultural and\
    \ expert knowledge, local \nclimate information, particular features of crop and\
    \ soil are \nprovided to the system. Broadband connection and cloud \nservices\
    \ are either unavailable or too costly in Sub-Saharan \nAfrica. To overcome these\
    \ constraints, data processing, \nnetwork administration, irrigation choices,\
    \ and farmer \ncommunication are all done locally, with no back-end servers \n\
    involved. In the article [9] the technique was evaluated using \nfive crops at\
    \ four European sites with varying weather \ncircumstances to optimize irrigation\
    \ water consumption by \ntaking into consideration soil water availability, local\
    \ weather \npredictions, crop physiological condition, and water demands \nin\
    \ real-time. Main observations are the major effect of \ninaccurate predictions\
    \ of the forecast, unless the target yield \nwas excessively high, was that the\
    \ target yield was not \nattained, but the irrigation schedule stayed near to\
    \ optimum, \naccording to the data. In other words, while the actual yield \n\
    did not match the objective, just a little amount of irrigation \nwater was lost.\
    \ In [10] author proposed an idea to automate \nthe irrigation process to manage\
    \ the motor's pumping by \ntaking into account the soil moisture content and rainfall\
    \ \nforecast. Soil moisture data is continuously sensed using a soil \nmoisture\
    \ sensor and is sent to raspberry pi and depends upon \nthe value a rainfall prediction\
    \ is obtained from Openweather \nAPI to decide on irrigating the field or not\
    \ and the Android \nApplication is used to track the complete irrigation process\
    \ for \nthe agricultural field. The article [11] effectively shows a \nsimple,\
    \ low-cost, and somewhat accurate system for \nmonitoring current meteorological\
    \ conditions and forecasting \nrain. This system has a significant benefit over\
    \ comparable \nArduino-based weather monitoring systems in that it also \nprovides\
    \ rain probability at the current moment using weather \nparameters namely temperature,\
    \ humidity, light intensity, and \nwind conditions. The goal of this study [12]\
    \ was to provide a \nway for a reliable irrigation system based on a suitable\
    \ rainfall \nforecast algorithm. The new approach, which is Romyan's \nmethod\
    \ is introduced to calculate water requirement for crops, \nas well as the time\
    \ necessary for the motor to be turned on. \nThe author in [13] presents a technique\
    \ for high-accuracy \nrainfall forecasting that combines two types of data i.e.,\
    \ cloud \nimaging data and humidity as an atmospheric parameter in \nnumerical\
    \ form. Convolution Neural Network is used for \nimage recognition by extracting\
    \ important features using \nResNet. In this research, a novel network is built\
    \ that \ncombines the cloud picture with other meteorological \ninformation and\
    \ creates the result, to forecast rainfall with \ngreater accuracy than the existing\
    \ ResNet image recognition \nalone. \nA comparison of the existing and proposed\
    \ work based on \nthe parameters and technology along with methods and \nmethodologies\
    \ used are shown in Table I. The comparative \nanalysis of the previous research\
    \ work has revealed that most \nof the models used either atmospheric parameters\
    \ or cloud \nimages for the prediction of rainfall and only one paper \nproposed\
    \ a system using a combined approach but using only \none parameter as humidity.\
    \ However, after researching \nexisting systems it is clear that the combined\
    \ approach of two \nmodalities to predict rainfall gives more clarity and would\
    \ be \nvery useful. In this regard, the system proposed uses a \nmultisource data\
    \ approach that combines predictions from \ndigital cloud images and atmospheric\
    \ parameters to provide an \nimproved rainfall prediction system. \nTABLE I. \n\

    \ combining the output \nfrom both approaches to predict rainfall and gives an\
    \ \nappropriate decision on the amount of irrigation to be done. In \ncomparison\

    \ solution that would be \nbeneficial to the agricultural and scientific communities\
    \ in \nterms of its portability and use of edge analytics where input is \nprocessed\
    \ and output is given at the device level only without \ncloud platforms, internet\
    \ or WiFi. \nIII. PROPOSED SYSTEM \nThe study of clouds and their characteristics\
    \ is crucial for a \nwide range of applications. It's been utilized to produce\
    \ \nprecise weather forecasts via nowcasting. There exist many \nclouds in the\
    \ sky but only a few clouds are responsible for \nrain. Identification of rainclouds\
    \ can be done using image \nclassification with the help of deep learning on a\
    \ ground-based \nimage cloud dataset. To make the predictions more accurate \n\
    the atmospheric parameters like temperature, humidity, \natmospheric pressure\
    \ is taken into account which can be easily \nsensed by the sensors and are affordable.\
    \ The results from \nboth approaches are combined and the final output is given\
    \ as \nthe prediction on the rainfall as No rain, Low to Medium rain, \nor heavy\
    \ rain as shown in Fig. 1 as a multi-modal proposed \nsystem on basis of which\
    \ many agriculture-related activities \ncan be carried out like managing irrigation\
    \ by taking in \naccount the status and intensity of rainfall. \nA. Components\
    \ used  \n1) BMP180: BMP180 is a barometric sensor with an I2C \n(―Wire‖) interface,\
    \ used to measure pressure surrounding it \nand altitude. It is also used to measure\
    \ temperature. It works \non push sensor BMP180 and can measure the pressure in\
    \ the \nrange of 300 to 1100 hPa with relative pressure error to 0.12 \nhPa (1m\
    \ height). The BMP180 outputs absolute pressure \nin pascals (Pa). By observing\
    \ variations in pressure short-term \nweather changes can be predicted. Dropping\
    \ pressure, for \nexample, frequently indicates the arrival of rain or a storm\
    \ (a \nlow-pressure system is moving in). When the pressure rises, it \nusually\
    \ signals that clear weather is on the way (a high-\npressure system is moving\
    \ through). \n2) DHT11 sensor is a basic and commonly used to record \ntemperature\
    \ and humidity from the atmosphere in the digital \nform. This sensor utilizes\
    \ a thermistor and a capacitive \nhumidity sensor to detect the surrounding air.\
    \ To monitor \nhumidity and temperature instantly, it may be simply \ninterfaced\
    \ with any microcontroller such as Arduino, \nRaspberry Pi, and so on. \n3) Raspberry\
    \ Pi 4: Raspberry Pi 4 is the latest model and \nis a tiny processor or a controller\

    \ and P as input parameters. \nIV. METHODS AND TECHNOLOGY \nA. Irrigation Scheduling\
    \ \nIrrigation scheduling is critical for ensuring that crops \nreceive the right\
    \ quantity of water at the right time to \nminimize crop water stress and optimize\
    \ output [15]. Water \nstress can affect vegetable crops in two ways: when there\
    \ is a \nlack of water (drought stress) or when there is an abundance \nof water\
    \ (water stress) caused due to waterlogging or soil \nwater saturation. A water\
    \ deficit occurs when water is \nsupplied at the wrong time or insufficiently,\
    \ reducing the \namount of water available to plants in the soil. Long durations\
    \ \nof irrigation or high-water application rates can produce \nexcess soil moisture,\
    \ wasting water and causing nutrient loss. \nCrop water stress can also have an\
    \ impact on crop \nmanagement. Wilting occurs when soil moisture falls below a\
    \ \ncertain level, preventing plants from drawing water into their \nroots. Furthermore,\
    \ in low moisture circumstances, any \nmoisture-activated herbicides and nutrients\
    \ would not be \nefficiently used by plants. Presently, many different \napproaches\
    \ are adopted for irrigation scheduling as listed in \nTable II to optimize the\
    \ water application to crops. These \nmethods are ranked according to the level\
    \ of management \nrequired for water application [16]. Irrigation scheduling is\
    \ \ndifferent for a different crop at every growth stage and must \nbe followed\
    \ to optimize the crop yield and the use of water. \n \n \n(IJACSA) International\
    \ Journal of Advanced Computer Science and Applications, \nVol. 13, No. 5, 2022\
    \ \n272 | P a g e  \nwww.ijacsa.thesai.org \nTABLE II. \nIRRIGATION SCHEDULING\
    \ METHODS \nRank \nMethod \nType of water management \n0 \nThe \"Irrigate whenever\"\
    \ method  \nWater is applied without scheduling \n1 \n\"Feel and appearance\"\
    \ method \nThe irrigation manager decides the amount of water to be applied and\
    \ when by observing the soil sample and \nassessment is done by comparing it with\
    \ the soil reference images. \n2 \nSystematic method \nRegardless of considering\
    \ weather or soil water conditions, the application of water is done based on\
    \ the amount \nor time. \n3 \nCrop water demand method \nThe amount of water applied\
    \ is determined by the crop's evapotranspiration (ETc). This strategy involves\
    \ \ncalendar-based scheduling based on prior seasons and should take into account\
    \ rainy days. \n4 \nSoil water status method \nWater is supplied to the crop root\
    \ system based on soil moisture levels, usually by giving a proportion of soil\
    \ \naccessible water. Rainfall occurrences should be taken into consideration\
    \ with this technique. \n5 \nWater budgeting method \nWater application is dependent\
    \ on crop evapotranspiration, soil moisture content at the root level, and water\
    \ \nbudgeting. \nThe first method is completely traditional and requires \nhuman\
    \ interventions and results in lots of water wastage in \nterms of irrigation\
    \ as management was not done properly and \nno parameters are considered. The\
    \ second and third methods \nconsidered soil parameters and timings as well as\
    \ an amount \nfor application of water which reduced the water wastage but \n\
    may result in water stress as no weather conditions are \nconsidered. The last\
    \ three methods are improved and make use \nof technology by considering various\
    \ parameters like soil \nmoisture content and rainfall events to plan the irrigation\
    \ \nscheduling thus optimizing the use of water resources. From \nthe above table,\
    \ we can see that Irrigation scheduling is very \nimportant to optimize the water\
    \ application thus by improving \nthe yields and rainfall is one such important\
    \ factor that must \nbe taken into account to protect the crop from the application\
    \ \nof excess water thus improving the Irrigation Management \nsystem. \nB. Internet\
    \ of Things (IoT) \nEvery element of traditional farming processes may be \nsubstantially\
    \ altered by incorporating the newest sensor and \nIoT technology into agricultural\
    \ practices. Currently, Wireless \nsensors and the Internet of Things (IoT) are\
    \ being integrated \ninto smart agriculture and are capable of taking agriculture\
    \ \nsector to next level. Soil, humidity, wetness, light, air \ntemperature, CO2,\
    \ solar energy sensors, and a variety of other \nIoT sensors are all employed\
    \ in agriculture. Sensors, which \nare placed across the fields, on smart agriculture\
    \ vehicles, in \nIoT-based monitoring systems, and weather stations, collect \n\
    data in real-time and give farmers visibility and control over \ntheir activities.\
    \ Fig. 3 shows the basic architecture of IoT. \n \nFig. 3. A Basic Architecture\
    \ of IoT. \nIoT architecture consists of various hardware components \nlike sensors\
    \ as per the requirement to sense the data from \nsurroundings \nwhich \nrequires\
    \ \nsoftware \nand \nvarious \ncommunication technologies to exchange the data\
    \ among the \ndevices and finally, the data sensed by the interrelated devices\
    \ \ngets stored on the cloud for further analysis and various \napplication are\
    \ developed to convert this data into important \ninformation required for many\
    \ useful or decision-making \nactivities. \nThe information about IoT technology\
    \ stack that contains \ncompanies and produce different level IoT boards or \n\
    controllers, then come communication technologies NB-IoT, \nLoRaWAN, ZigBee, Bluetooth,\
    \ etc. supported by many \nCommunication protocols such as MQTT, COAP, AMQP, and\
    \ \nmany more as shown in Fig. 4. \n \nFig. 4. IoT Components and Technologies.\
    \ \nToday we have clouds like Thingspeak, IBM Watson \nspecifically for IoT along\
    \ with general-purpose cloud \nplatforms (AWS Amazon, Google, Cisco). Once the\
    \ data is \nstored it is analyzed with analytical tools like keras, \nTensorflow,\
    \ OpenCV is libraries with very powerful functions \nand finally, the information\
    \ retrieved after analysis of data is \nused for various applications. \nC. Edge\
    \ Analytics \nSensors are used to collect data from the environment or \nsurroundings\
    \ and Actuators are the devices that will take \naction based on the output of\
    \ processed data. If the Analytics \nis performed at the device level that concept\
    \ is called Edge \nAnalytics. Only data for storage is sent to the cloud. If \n\
    analytics is done in the cloud, then it is called cloud analytics. \nThis experiment\
    \ used DHT11 and bmp180 sensors to sense \ntemperature, Relative humidity, and\
    \ atmospheric pressure, and \nthe data is fed to a machine learning algorithm\
    \ (pickle file) to \n(IJACSA) International Journal of Advanced Computer Science\

    \ \nget the status of rainfall based on these real-time parameters. \nAlong with\
    \ it, raspberry pi is integrated with a digital camera \nto capture the image\
    \ of the sky at that location, and the image \nis given as the input to the deep\
    \ learning model (.h5 file) to get \nthe status of rainfall based on the types\
    \ of clouds present in the \nsky at that time. The processing is done in Raspberry\
    \ pi and \nthe predictions are displayed on the screen attached to it. This \n\
    proposed device uses Edge analytics to give output as the \nprocessing is done\
    \ at device level and does not depend on \nWIFI or internet. The cloud can be\
    \ used to just store the data \ncollected by the sensor only when Wi-Fi is available.\
    \ The cost \nof data storage and management is reduced using edge \nanalytics.\
    \ It also saves operational costs, bandwidth \nrequirements, and time spent on\
    \ data analysis. Despite the \nwidespread use of internet-connected gadgets, connection\
    \ \nproblems persist due to the unavailability of the internet or \nlimited network\
    \ access. Edge analytics guards against possible \nnetwork failures by ensuring\
    \ that applications aren't hampered \nby internet issues or limited network access\
    \ [17]. This is \nespecially beneficial in rural regions (remote locations) or\
    \ \nwhen trying to save communication expenses with costly \ntechnologies like\
    \ cellular. \nD. Deep Learning \nClouds are crucial in climate forecasting. Rainfall\
    \ \nforecasting is also heavily influenced by the state and kinds of \nclouds\
    \ in the sky. CNN model is used with transfer learning to \nclassify clouds based\
    \ on their features like texture, color, etc. \nto know the type of cloud and\
    \ rainfall can be predicted using \nthe precipitation associated with that cloud.\
    \ Ground-based \ncloud images are readily available compared to satellite cloud\
    \ \nimages and provides information about the local atmosphere \nby analyzing\
    \ bottom-level features of clouds like cloud height, \ncloud type, and cloud cover\
    \ [18]. Rain clouds are mainly \nclassified as Cirrus, Stratus, and Cumulus [19]\
    \ and the main \nclouds are shown in Fig. 5. \nThe proposed device is provided\
    \ with 8 megapixels digital \ncamera integrated into Raspberry-pi to capture live\
    \ sky images \nat any location by clicking a button on the device to activate\
    \ \nthe device. A cloud image is given as input to the convolution \nneural network\
    \ (CNN) and the SoftMax activation function is \nused to classify the cloud into\
    \ No Rain to very Low Rain, Low \nto Medium rain, or Medium to High Rain based\
    \ on the amount \nof precipitation associated with each cloud. According to the\
    \ \nPrecipitation and the amount of Rainfall as shown in Table III, \nall cloud\
    \ images are classified into three classes or groups. \nThe operation of the deep\
    \ learning model as shown in \nFig. 6 where the weights of the pretrained model\
    \ are \ndownloaded first, followed by freezing of all the layers except \nthe\
    \ top layer, which is used for classification in the fresh \ndataset, and finally\
    \ the training of the model. All of the layers \nare unfrozen for fine-tuning,\
    \ and the model is trained on a new \ndataset with a very low learning rate. Once\
    \ trained, the model \nwas able to accurately predict the outcome. All three pre-\n\
    trained models, VGG16, Inception-V3, and Xception, follow \nthe identical flow\
    \ and concluded with The Xception model \ngives better accuracy to predict Rainfall\
    \ based on cloud \nimages taken from the ground, giving output whether Rain or\
    \ \nlittle Rain or medium Rain or high Rain as compared to VGG \n16 and Inception-V3.\
    \ Rain Prediction using deep learning on \nground-based cloud images using transfer\
    \ learning, is \npresented in [20]. \nE. Machine Learning  \nTo support the rain\
    \ prediction model based on cloud \nimages, atmospheric parameters are also considered\
    \ which \nalso plays vital role in determining the rainfall. Temperature, \nhumidity,\
    \ and pressure in the atmosphere fluctuate rapidly, \ncausing instability in the\
    \ atmosphere, which can result in rain, \nstorms, and even lightning and thunder.\
    \ The most significant \nelements in predicting precipitation are temperature\
    \ and \nhumidity [21]. Air pressure, dewpoint temperature (or relative \nhumidity),\
    \ wind speed, and cloud cover are four more \nmeteorological factors that are\
    \ substantially connected to \nrainfall [22]. But as the device is portable so\
    \ only the most \nimportant variables are chosen for the experiments which are\
    \ \ntemperature, relative humidity, and air pressure that can be \nsensed with\
    \ affordable sensors and are sufficient to predict the \nstatus of the rainfall.\

    \ Working of Deep Learning Model. \nRainfall intensity is classified according\
    \ to the rate of \nprecipitation, which depends on the considered time. The \n\
    following categories are used to classify rainfall intensity [23]: \n Low rain\
    \ — when the precipitation rate is < 2.5 mm \n(0.098 in) per hour \n Medium rain\
    \ — when the precipitation rate is between \n2.5 mm (0.098 in) and 7.6 mm (0.30\
    \ in) or 10 mm \n(0.39 in) per hour  \n High rain — when the precipitation rate\
    \ is > 7.6 mm \n(0.30 in) per hour, or between 10 mm (0.39 in) and \n50 mm (2.0\
    \ in) per hour \n Very High rain — when the precipitation rate is > \n50 mm (2.0\
    \ in) per hour \nHere also the data is classified in the same categories as in\
    \ \ncloud dataset as No Rain to Very Low Rain, Low to Medium \nRain, and Medium\
    \ to Heavy Rain based on the precipitation \nrate. \nThe data is collected for\
    \ the city of Hyderabad, Telangana, \nfrom Nasa Power Data viewer for Daily data,\
    \ which contains \nvarious climatic parameters, but only the most significant\
    \ ones \nare picked, and the data is collected over a 40-year period \nfrom 1981\
    \ to May 2021. Because there are an average of 64-\n65 rainy days each year, collecting\
    \ sufficient data over a long \nperiod of time is required. The dataset contains\
    \ many \nattributes (columns), but for this experiment, the independent \nvariables\
    \ are Temperature, Relative Humidity, and Pressure, \nand the dependent variable\
    \ is Condition, which is labelled in \nthree categories based on precipitation:\
    \ No rain to very low \nrain, Low to medium rain, and Medium to high rain. Various\
    \ \nsteps carried out to train the model from collecting dataset to \ncleaning\
    \ of the dataset, balancing the dataset, feature \nextraction, and then partitioning\
    \ of the dataset into train and \ntest sets as shown in Fig. 7. After that various\
    \ classification \nmodels are applied on the training set to train the model on\
    \ \nselected parameters then the performance is analyzed by \ncalculating the\
    \ accuracy based on the predictions from the test \ndataset. \nIt has been observed,\
    \ that among all individual machine \nlearning models RandomForest and KNN gave\
    \ a good \nprediction as compared to others. Logistic regression and \nSVM also\
    \ performed well while predicting the values but \nDecision Tree and Naïve Byes\
    \ performance was poor in \nestimating the predictions compared to other models\
    \ as shown \nin Fig. 8. For evaluating the machine learning models a very \neffective\
    \ technique called K-FOLD CROSS VALIDATION is \nused where the model is tested\
    \ on part of the dataset which \nwas not used for training. In this experiment,\
    \ value of k is set \nto 5 in the K-fold cross-validation technique to check the\
    \ \naccuracy attained by various models used. Although \npredictions from stacking\
    \ Ensemble are better than voting, the \ncalculation time is three times that\
    \ of individual machine \nlearning models. As a result, the RandomForest classifier\
    \ was \nchosen to implement in hardware since it is faster and has \nsimilar accuracy\
    \ to Stacking Ensemble. \n(IJACSA) International Journal of Advanced Computer\

    \ to capture the video of the sky which will be \ndivided into continuous image\
    \ frames and given as input to the \nDeep learning model to get the rainfall prediction\
    \ based on the \nclouds present in the sky. Data sensed by the DHT11 sensor \n\
    and BMP180 i.e. temperature, humidity, and pressure is given \nas input to the\
    \ machine learning model. The predicted rainfall \nfrom both the models is displayed\
    \ on the OLED screen and \nthe final decision for the amount of irrigation is\
    \ also displayed \non the screen. Based on the output the motor can be switched\
    \ \nON to irrigate the land for the appropriate amount of water \nbased on the\
    \ decision given. The instrument is tested and \nfound to give very correct predictions\
    \ based on both \napproaches. This rainfall system would be very much useful in\
    \ \nmany agricultural events where the rainfall prediction needs to \nbe considered.\

    \ in the open space in residential area by \npowering it with the USB power bank\
    \ as the Raspberry Pi \nrequires a 5volt input voltage, which is provided via\
    \ the USB \ntype-C connection. The input voltage should actually be a \nlittle\
    \ higher than 5 volts. Because power losses occur in the \nconnectors and wires\

    \ \nVI. CONCLUSION AND FUTURE SCOPE \n In this era of technology people like farmers\
    \ must be able \nto use various technologies to increase their decision-making\
    \ \nin various agriculture processes like the timing of irrigation, \nspraying\
    \ of pesticides, use of fertilizers in the right amount, \nand at right time needed\
    \ by the crops. But there are some \nlimitations as unavailability of WIFI, No\
    \ Internet, lack of \nknowledge while using the technologies. This IoT based \n\
    portable device is a small effort for people like farmers, \ntransporters where\
    \ rain prediction is of utmost use for decision \nmaking and the main advantage\
    \ of this device is that it will be \noperated without the internet and will give\
    \ the prediction by \nsensing the atmospheric parameters and sky status at the\
    \ \ncurrent location. Compared to the previous devices this \nproposed \nsystem\
    \ \ngives \nrainfall \nprediction \nbased \non \natmospheric parameters along\
    \ with present cloud/sky status \nspecific to that location, hence is very useful\
    \ in agriculture for \nmonitoring the weather status without the use of any internet\
    \ \nand the device require very low power which can be given by \na power bank\
    \ using USB-C Type cable to a raspberry pi. \nFarmers cultivating crops under\
    \ irrigation can benefit from \nclimate prediction of precipitation and temperature\
    \ at various \nstages of the growing season. These forecasts enable farmers \n\
    to better manage the timing of water application and apply the \nappropriate amount\
    \ of water to maximize crop production. \nThis device can also be used to monitor\
    \ individual parameters \nas per the requirement like temperature, humidity, or\
    \ \natmospheric pressure. The device works in two modes for \nmonitoring individual\
    \ parameters and gives rain prediction \nonly after pressing the push button.\
    \ Rain prediction is given \nby combining output from machine learning by giving\
    \ \natmospheric parameters as input and deep learning by taking \nsky image as\
    \ input. For a deep learning model Xception model \ngives better accuracy of around\
    \ 80% as compared to VGG16 \nand Inception V3. Whereas for the Machine learning\
    \ approach \namong all individual machine learning models RandomForest \nand KNN\
    \ gave a good prediction as compared to others. \nLogistic regression and SVM\
    \ also performed well while \npredicting the values but Decision Tree and Naïve\
    \ Byes \nperformance was poor in estimating the predictions compared \nto other\
    \ models. The device is handy and requires human \nintervention for pressing the\
    \ button to get the rainfall \nprediction as per the requirement. Before reaching\
    \ the final \ndecision of irrigating the land the device can be used after \n\
    every 1 or 2 hours to monitor the changes in the atmosphere. \nThe sensed data\
    \ can be stored in excel in Raspberry-pi and \nwhenever a WIFI is available the\
    \ data can be stored on the \ncloud for future use. \nFor future work, the GSM\

    Abstract

    The integration of Internet Protocol and Embedded Systems can enhance the communication
    platform.

    This paper describes the emerging smart technologies based on Internet of Things
    (IOT) and internet

    protocols along with embedded systems for monitoring and controlling smart devices
    with the help of Wi-

    Fi technology and web applications. The internet protocol (IP) address has been
    assigned to the things to

    control and operate the devices via remote network that facilitates the interoperability
    and end-to-end

    communication among various devices c,onnected over a network. The HTTP POST and
    HTTP GET

    command that supports the RESTful service have been used to ensure the transmission
    and reception of

    packets between the IOT Gateway and Cloud Database. The emerging smart technologies
    based on the

    Internet of Things (IoT) facilitated features like automation, controllability,
    interconnectivity, reliability

    which in turn turn paved the way for a wide range of acceptance amongst the masses.
    The Internet of

    Things (IoT) has brought in many new emerging technologies into varoius ¦eld like
    our daily lives,

    industry, agricultural sector, and many more. The world is experiencing the explosive
    growth with the

    advent of Internet of Things (IoT) these years. The potential growth of IoT is
    enoromous which is

    evidenced by all the human beings in our day to day life.

    I. Introduction

    The notion of IoT has greater impact on the lives of the human beings. It has
    crept in both the domestic

    as well as business lives of the human kind. In recent years, with the evolution
    of IoT, the world has

    witnessed transformation of human life style in many possible ways. Various ¦elds
    like manufacturing

    units, inventories, agricultural sectors, etc., are experiencing the huge transformation
    with the advent of

    IoT in everyday lives. The concept IoT has been evolving for around two decades
    and attracts several

    researchers and academicians due to the estimation of having a greater impact
    in the emerging world to

    improve and enhance the lives of the society. The emergency of IoT technology
    tries to amalgamate

    everything which is available in this world. IoT is considered a growing technology
    of everyday life. The

    biggest challenge in the utilization of IoT is the concept of intercommunication
    between appliances. The

    di¨culty in the controllability of various devices, clustering different technology,
    automation of devices of

    different nature, etc., are some of the challenges which are prevailing in the
    usage or the integration of

    IoT into various devices.

    When the things are connected over an internet to make them work together by cooperating
    with one

    another to facilitate an ideal service as a whole and not the combination of devices
    that works

    independently. This idea is much useful in several real-world applications, for
    instance, smart residence,

    in which automatic opening and closing of windows based on the switching on and
    off of an air

    conditioner or based on the oxygen availability inside the room. Even the public
    sectors are bene¦tted

    using IoT technology in these years. Myriad bene¦ts are experienced everyday by
    various government

    and service sectors. IoT enabled applications bene¦ts public sectors in numerous
    ways like in handling

    public safety, maintaining and management of resource, city governance, tr¨c handling
    and much more.

    Page 3/14

    Many health care bene¦ts are also made possible with the help of IoT devices.
    Health care bene¦ts like

    monitoring the patients during their hazardous di¨cult situation, several hospital
    administration bene¦ts

    are made viable to all due to IoT in the ¦eld of medicine. IoT bene¦ts can be
    traced even in th ¦eld of

    agricultural sector as well. Automated irrigation system, crop monitoring technology
    bene¦ts the farmers

    of large scale. it simpli¦es their physical labour. Wireless IoT applications
    help the livestock management

    people in updating the status of the cattles. The intergration of automation and
    IoT in smart watches and

    ¦tness trackers also bene¦ts public in monitoring their health. It also further
    entertains the public through

    automated music system, smart home technology also enables to set timer and information
    in our ¦nger

    tips.

    Integration of smart technology at home also results in experiencing myriad bene¦ts.
    Automation and

    IoTin various gadjets like smart refrigerators, smart bulbs, smart plugs, smart
    thermostats, etc., are some

    of the examples which make things easier in our daily lives. These features help
    in giving alert messages

    regarding the stock availability, conservation of energy, etc. The application
    and usage of IoT technology

    is limitless. Capability and adjustability of integration of IoT with other device
    is wide. The relevant

    information can be obtained, the performance can be monitored, and even it can
    be controlled from a

    distance. It is evident that the bene¦ts of IoT is unlimited. The applications
    of IoT has brought newer

    promise to the world in bringing immense value to human lives. No longer it remains
    as a fanciful vision

    rather it can be experienced by everybody.

    The introduction of IoT leads to the transformation of the World into more advanced
    nature in the ¦eld of

    Information and Communication Technology (ICT). Through IoT various devices are
    embedded with

    internet connectivity which enables to share data with other devices used around
    human environment.

    The possibility of exchanging data with other system around us made numerous possible
    things over the

    web. The interconnection of web is made possible beyond phones and computers due
    to the initiation of

    IoT. As a result of initiation of IoT with other house hold and o¨cial devices,
    features like analytical and

    computing capabilities are made possible. Several devices are involved in implementation
    of smart

    technology with the help of IoT. The devices like sensors, actuators, IoT gateway,
    the cloud, interface, etc.,

    make the implementation of IoT in this era. All these components are tied together
    with the help of

    automation for the smooth §ow of work. The operational e¨ciency can be increased
    with the help of the

    feature of automation and IoT.

    The IoT facilitates the machine to machine and human to machine communication
    using a standard

    protocol. Furthermore it enhances workplace safety in all possible ways. The workplace
    devices which is

    equipped with sensors will help in detecting failures, maintainance of the working
    circumstances.

    Compliance, safety, e¨ciency, etc can be resolved by IoT and automation. Moreover,
    this technology

    helps in overcoming and navigating the longstanding problems with ease. It provides
    opportunities for

    new invention in the hands of technology. The global network transformed the ICT
    with smart device

    applications [1]. IoT is a self-motivated network that interconnects the physical
    and virtual objects

    together [2]. It has been developed from the convergence of wireless technology,
    embedded micro-chip

    and micro-electromechanical system and internet for standard con¦guration and
    to accomplish

    Page 4/14

    interoperable communication by with the help of embedded systems for the integration
    of network and

    things seamlessly [3].

    The development of embedded microchip device has been improved which when interconnected
    with

    internet gives rise to a concept called “Internet of Things”. The IOT makes use
    of a set of wireless

    connectivity like Wi-Fi, Z-Wave, ZigBee, Bluetooth etc. and wireless protocols
    like HTTP, MQTT, 6LowPAN,

    CoAP etc. to facilitate better end to end communication among the smart devices
    and applications [4].

    The smart and intelligent devices need scalability for resource constrain, data
    security, secure packet

    transmission and power e¨ciency using RESTful architecture to integrate the cloud
    services. For a

    successful connection and interoperability, a developer should understand the
    complexities and

    standards of the evolving embedded system based on their IOT device. The embedded
    system is an

    electronic device which includes a microcontroller that helps in performing the
    operations like debugging,

    user modi¦cation or to encode a software which can control the devices.

    The monitoring and control of multiple devices using embedded wireless system
    is going on developing

    in recent years with the advancement in IOT, as it leads to a new revolution in
    the ¦eld of ICT [5]. The

    number of smart devices connected to IOT and the smartphones that can access those
    are exponentially

    increasing [6]. The Single on Chip (SoC) technology in homes and o¨ces improves
    the comfort of the

    lives of people, security and e¨cient power management. It also enhances the lifestyle
    of disabled and

    elderly people who needs additional support for their daily life. Hence, the growth
    of embedded based IOT

    is recently accomplishing more attention in the control and monitoring of smart
    devices and various

    wireless technologies like Wi-Fi, Bluetooth and RFID are evolving in the automation
    of such devices. Thus,

    the wireless technology is going on improving in resource sharing and device to
    device communication

    via internet using the embedded systems and internet protocols. This technology
    gives rise to the

    automation in the development of smart devices, smart city, smart home, smart
    agriculture, smart

    healthcare, smart industry etc. Several researches have been carried out in the
    development of embedded

    system based IOT by several industrialists and academicians due to its demand
    in the connectivity of

    world with security, comfort, convenience and better quality of lives.

    The implementation of intelligent embedded system based IOT for remote data transfer,
    sensing,

    controlling and monitoring multiple devices with web applications by the integration
    of wireless

    technologies like Wi-Fi, Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE), Z-Waves, ZigBee, RFID and
    Cellular network [7].

    Table I shows the comparison of wireless technologies and protocols on the basis
    of distance, data rate

    and frequency band. The data sharing and communication between human to things
    and things to

    things over a certain distance is based on the transmission and reception through
    radio waves had been

    facilitated by the wireless technology. The transmitting and receiving the packets
    from physical to

    application layer had been facilitated by the protocols like HTTP, MQTT and CoAP.
    When the protocols

    MQTT and CoAP was compared in such a way that the most of the functionalities
    like level of Quality of

    Service (QoS), multicast security, congestion control frequent message occurrences
    and message

    tenacity, the MQTT was found to have better performance, whereas when the reliability,
    bandwidth and

    Round-Trip Time (RTT) were compared, the CoAP was found to have better performance
    [8].

    In comparison with the protocols like CoAP and HTTP, tested with around ten thousand
    smart devices

    with a benchmark as Total Cost of Ownership (TCO) along with some technical parameters
    like energy

    consumption and data formed while transmitting through applications, CoAP had
    performed well when

    compared with HTTP in the sense that the energy consumption was 6x less than that
    of HTTP PUSH

    mode. Also, the CoAP protocols generated 62 GB data/month and the HTTP protocol
    generated 434 GB

    data/month [9]. These wireless technologies and protocols have been used in several
    embedded based

    IOT systems for monitoring and control of various smart devices and enhancing
    the communication

    between humans to things and things to things.

    Ii. Related Work

    A Home automation system based on Bluetooth technology has been implemented in
    [10]. In this system,

    an android based smart phone and a web-app is used for the monitoring and control
    of home appliances

    like light, fan, television, air conditioner, etc., but interlinking those devices
    with as Bluetooth sub-

    controller. The limitation of this system is that the Bluetooth has a low range
    of connectivity upto 10 m.

    The access control of Bluetooth makes use of a contention-less MAC with fast transmission
    and low

    latency. The Bluetooth architecture adopts Master/Slave concept and has adverting
    frame and data

    frame.

    The control of home appliances using Wi-Fi with a personal computer which connects
    the home

    appliances with the web server database and webpage. The disadvantages of this
    system include the

    Page 6/14

    high cost and high consumption of energy due to the utilization of high-end personal
    computer. Another

    one drawback is that the developed home automation system controls the home appliances
    only through

    web application available in the home locality [11].

    An embedded system based smart home automation with a Global System for Mobile
    Communication

    (GSM) based on web app involves interfacing of devices with the GSM technology
    and a web server to

    monitor and control the home appliances and various other devices with the IOT
    module. The issues

    faced in this system were, in data transmission, authenticity and SMS/GSM and
    not video streaming [12].

    A ubiquitous home monitoring and control via a smartphone with an android based
    microweb application

    to facilitate an innovative communication protocol in the control and monitoring
    of a home switching

    system with the help of sensors connected with relays. The major demerit of this
    system is that, it does

    not support voice commands for controlling the home appliances [13].

    TinyOS is an application speci¦c Operating System (OS) for wireless sensor nodes.
    The TinyOS has been

    designed in such a way that it is well suited for sensor nodes with resource constrains
    like the Mica

    having §ash ROM, 128kb and RAM, 4kb. The TinyOS has a compact architecture that
    is less than 400

    bytes. Due to its compactness, this OS was preferred by several researchers to
    use it as a basic platform

    for sensor networks, middleware and several other applications. It includes database,
    networking, security

    which are the speci¦c needs for and IOT application on sensor nodes [14]. The
    same facilities have been

    found in a sensor networking OS called Contiki, which can be now used as an open-source
    OS for IOT. It

    consists of several libraries and middleware related to IOT that can be much helpful
    in the development

    of IoT applications. The major challenge in using Contiki is, it facilitates multi-thread
    support named as

    protothread, which has very less functionalities and lacks several essential features
    when compared with

    the real-time OS [15].

    The internet of things can be categorized into semantic-oriented, things-oriented
    and internet-oriented

    visions. The internet-oriented paradigm of IOT has been enhanced with the help
    of semantic-oriented

    approach, since these two approaches are useful for building a practical and complex
    IOT application

    that can be applicable for rich embedded systems. As of now, there were several
    researches has been

    carried out for building an IOT software framework that facilitate concrete implementation
    in the

    deployment of IOT applications. This system uses CoAP based REST packet transmission
    [16].

    The Near Field Communication (NFC) technology is a short-range wireless communication
    technology

    which can transfer data for approximately 20 cm. the NFC consists of a tag which
    holds only a small

    quantity of data and those data cannot be modi¦ed or deleted. It can be of read-only
    type data storage

    like RFID tags used in biometrics, or it can be re-written or modi¦ed later by
    the device [17].

    The Low Power Wide Area Network (LPWAN) technology can be applicable for low-power
    applications

    and can be used for communication over very long range of around 10 km between
    the gateway and the

    end nodes. The data rate of LPWAN is very low of about less that 1 kbps. Major
    technologies in LPWAN

    Page 7/14

    are LoRaWAN, SigFox and Weightless that operates in sub-GHz bands. The major issue
    in the use of

    LPWAN is, the LPWAM in sub-GHz lacks the globally available band [18].

    The Z-Wave is a low power consumption MAC protocol specially used in home automation
    system. It is

    now also used in several other IoT applications other than home automation. The
    Z-Wave can cover upto

    100 meters, facilitates point to point communication and can be well suited for
    small message

    transmission. For media access, the Z-Wave use CSMA/CA along with the small acknowledgement

    message for reliable transmission. The Z-Wave architecture consists of a Master
    and Slaves. Here, the

    Master can control all the slaves connected to it by transmitting the commands
    and handle the

    scheduling of the complete network [19].

    ZigBee is the most common IoT standard speci¦cally used for medium-range communication
    like remote

    controls, smart homes and healthcare. The network topology of ZigBee includes
    the star topology, peer to

    peer topology and cluster tree. A coordinator is present in the center of star
    topology, which is used for

    controlling the network. The coordinator is available in the root of a tree in
    cluster tree topology. In peer-to-

    peer topology, the coordinator can be located at anywhere. There are two stack
    pro¦les available in

    ZigBee standards. They are the ZigBee and the ZigBee Pro. They can facilitate
    full mesh networking and

    can function with various applications that allows the implementation with low
    memory and low

    processing power. The ZigBee Pro provides several features that includes scalability
    by assigning

    stochastic address, security by exchange of symmetric keys and better performance
    by effective many to

    one routing factor [20].

    In this study, several existing approaches based on the integration of internet
    protocol and embedded

    system for device automation via IoT were analyzed for remote monitoring and control
    of various smart

    devices and its implementation and development. Hence, in this paper a model of
    smart automation

    system using Wi-Fi and android we application has been proposed. The proposed
    system would facilitate

    end to end communication, security, interoperability and scalability and various
    other functions of smart

    devices over a network.

    Iii. Proposed Methodlolgy

    The proposed embedded system based IOT communication rely on the con¦guration
    of IP address over

    Wi-Fi (IEEE 802.11 b/g/n) technology. The proposed system consists of various
    smart devices, Arduino

    microcontroller, IoT module (ESP8266), wireless router with ¦rewall and external
    power supply unit. This

    system also makes use of an android web application and cloud database. The architecture
    of the

    proposed system is given in Fig. 1.

    A. Smart Devices

    The smart devices are the devices that are integrated with the IoT technology
    to monitor and monitor

    them wirelessly through a remote network. The smart device— an electronic device—
    when it is connected

    to other devices can be operated interactively as well as autonomously. The word
    smart indicates

    Page 8/14

    intelligence. Smart devices and their usage in every day life is an emerging new
    trend in the ¦eld of

    technology especially in the era of IoT. The use of smart devices can facilitate
    ease of access for

    everyone including the elderly and disabled persons. These smart devices can be
    used in homes, o¨ces,

    industries, agriculture, etc. and can be accessed over a range of more than 10
    m. The qualities of

    controllability, interconnection, intelligence, and much more are integrated into
    various smart devices

    including households, o¨ces, industries, other sectors like agriculture, production
    networking, etc. With

    the emergence of technology, the levels of controllability can be adjusted according
    to the need of the

    person. This results in an increased number of users all around the globe, especially
    in recent days. Thus

    it can be said that through the Internet of Things (IoT) the entire world is experiencing
    the era of

    technology speci¦cally in the hands of the device when they are interconnected
    with a network of

    systems. The birth of IoT has paved way for the integration of many smart devices.

    B. Embedded System

    The smart embedded system refers to the intelligent microcontroller that is used
    in the development of a

    system with a ¦rmware coding stored in it. The Arduino (ATmega328) microcontroller
    consists of 8-bit

    analog and digital I/O pins, +5V AREF pin, Serial Peripheral Interface communication
    pins, USB port,

    interrupt pins for the con¦guration of changing an interrupt from the rising to
    falling edges and vice-versa

    and several other features. These result in integration of technology which aims
    for enhanced

    functionality. In this twenty ¦rst century IoT has become the most important technologies
    amongst all. It

    has made several things possible namely the embedded devices can be connected
    to various

    applications of everyday objects which results in smooth §ow of communication.
    Embedded systems are

    hih demanding because they are customized and programmed according to the needs
    and the

    requirements of the users. Smart embedded syatems by acquiring changes to the
    existing contemporary

    embedded syatems will result in suitability for real time existence of human life
    with additional features

    like cost e¨ciency and lower power consumption. Embedded device becomes the part
    and parcel of

    human life. it can be experienced in our daily life through devices like digitally
    controlled home alarm,

    digitially controlled toaster oven, phone which is connected to a web browser,
    etc, to name a few.

    C. Internet of Things Gateway

    The self-contained and SOC based ESP8266 module integrated with a TCP/IP protocol
    stack interlinks

    the microcontroller with the Wi-Fi network. This chip can be able to host a web
    application or can deposit

    all the Wi-Fi networking activities from any other application processor. This
    module has been designed

    in such a way that it has some preprogrammed commands that facilitates advanced
    technologies. These

    commands are more powerful to handle the on-board processing and storage of various
    application

    speci¦c interfaces and sensors connected over General Purpose Input/Output (GPIO).
    It also supports the

    minimum upfront development and run-time while loading the programs.

    The packets are transmitted via network layer. They are then broken into pieces.
    Each piece is assigned

    with a speci¦c name protocol data unit (PDU) and connected with a speci¦c layer.
    In the top-most layer, a

    discover packet has been constructed by HTTP client, which is then transmitted
    by HTTP POST. In layer-4,

    Page 9/14

    the datagram encapsulates the Protocol Data Unit into a segment called TCP/UDP.
    In layer-3, the IP

    address of the destination in same subnet sets the IP address of the next hop
    to destination. In layer-2,

    Wi-Fi broadcasts the IP address of the next hop, then the destination MAC address
    of the frame is set to

    broadcast. Now the PDU has been encapsulated by the device into Ethernet frame
    for concerned devices.

    In layer-1, at the same time, the cellular network port transmits the other frame.
    The devices buffers to

    transmit the frame in future.

    Amalgamation of hardware and software is made possible with the advent of IoT
    which aims for creating

    smarter world. IoT has become the basic common platform where integration of other
    devices are

    possible inorder to collect and exchange the necessary information. Furthermore,
    it also acts as a bridge

    in connecting devices for enabling the features like interaction, collaboration,
    etc. Several smart devices

    can be interconnected in real-world, which is stimulated by using the networking
    tools like packet tracer.

    The packet tracer supports the representation of several hardware that can be
    con¦gured by assigning

    the smart devices with IPv4. For performance analysis like throughput, latency,
    bandwidth, packet loss

    rate etc., the NS-3 network simulator is used, as it supports the simulation of
    IOT. The interoperable

    protocol used in this system is the RESTful web service with HTTP in the application
    layer to facilitate

    client and server communication among the gateway device and the remote user.
    Along with HTTP,

    TCP/IP protocol has been used for packet transmission in IOT to cloud database.

    D. Software System

    The development of system software for the monitor and control of smart devices
    involves two steps: (1)

    development of web application in JSON and (2) microcontroller-based ¦rmware microcode
    in Arduino

    IDE. In Arduino IDE, the web app and Wi-Fi library < wi¦.h > are implemented to
    allow data transmission

    and reception. It enables the client server functionality to facilitate better
    communication among the

    remote-user and the gateway device. The IOT module and the Gateway device were
    connected with the

    cloud database via TCP/IP protocol to provide connectivity for remote users. Whenever
    the gateway

    device is switched on, it is enabled for con¦guration via Wireless Local Area
    Network (WLAN) with the

    help of static IP address. The use of static IP address instead of dynamic IP
    address is to optimize the

    connection process. Until the gateway device receives any commands from the remote
    user through a

    web app, the device would be in the idle state. The Fig. 2 shows the establishment
    of connection among

    the embedded system and Wi-Fi module.

    The application software runs in the Arduino Uno microcontroller with the help
    of Wi-Fi chip. The Wi-Fi

    chip enables the client and server communication through a wireless router. The
    connection between the

    gateway device and the remote user with the smart devices has been con¦gured by
    the wireless router

    and the Wi-Fi module. The Wi-Fi library helps in receiving the packets from the
    microcontroller and also

    creates new packets by passing output message in Java native Language (JNL). The
    RESTful services

    for android web applications facilitates the communication between human to human
    and the human to

    things connected over a network in JSON format for HTTP POST and HTTP GET requests.

    E. Cloud Database

    Page 10/14

    The cloud database and the application layer facilitate the automation, controlling
    and monitoring of

    smart devices remotely and enables e¨cient use of data collected to graphically
    represent the status of

    the smart devices via the web application’s Graphical User Interface (GUI). Figure
    3 shows the overall

    architecture of the implementation of the proposed system.

    Iv. Conclusion

    This paper proposed the implementation of smart phone based remote monitoring
    and control of several

    smart devices with Wi-Fi technology. If the Wi-Fi connection gets failed, then
    the cellular networks enable

    the connectivity among the devices on the basis of RESTful architecture. The proposed
    system

    consumes very less power and can be used in various domains like homes, o¨ces,
    industries, healthcare,

    agriculture etc. with IOT protocols. The use of HTTP and TCP/IP protocols were
    encouraged in this paper

    due to the better performance in connectivity, communication, security and QoS
    with HHTP POST and

    HTTP GET commands for with RESTful services for packet transmission between IOT
    gateway and cloud

    services.

    \ a \npowerful technology that enables the collection of \nhigh-resolution \n\
    data \nfrom \na \nclose \nrange, \nproviding \nvaluable \ninsights \ninto \nvarious\

    \ significant attention \nworldwide, including in India, where it holds \nimmense\
    \ potential for precision agriculture and \nenvironmental \nmonitoring \n[1].\
    \ \nThe \nunique \nagricultural landscape, diverse ecosystems, and \ngrowing environmental\
    \ concerns in India make \nproximal remote sensing particularly relevant and \n\
    impactful [2]. \n \nIndia, with its vast agricultural sector and large \npopulation\
    \ \ndependent \non \nagriculture \nfor \nlivelihood, \nfaces \nnumerous \nchallenges\
    \ \nin \noptimizing \ncrop \nproduction, \nresource \nmanagement, and environmental\

    \ \nsoil \nconditions, \nand \nenvironmental \nparameters often lack the necessary\
    \ precision \nand timeliness required for effective decision-\nmaking. Proximal\
    \ remote sensing offers a \nsolution by facilitating real-time data acquisition,\
    \ \nenabling farmers, researchers, and policymakers \nto make informed choices\
    \ and take timely actions \n[4]. \n \nIn the Indian context, researchers and scientists\
    \ \nhave recognized the potential of proximal remote \nsensing and have undertaken\

    \ \n \nThe significance of Precision Agriculture (PA) \nhas gained widespread\
    \ recognition as a crucial \ncontributor \nto \ncrop \nproduction \ntechnology\
    \ \nworldwide \n[13]. \nHowever, \nits \npractical \nimplementation has been limited\
    \ to large-scale \nfarms thus far [14]. PA is built upon an innovative \nsystems\
    \ \napproach \nthat \nrelies \non \nvarious \nfundamental technologies, including\
    \ Geographic \nInformation System (GIS), Global Positioning \nSystem (GPS), computer\
    \ modeling, ground-\nbased/airborne/satellite remote sensing, variable \nrate\
    \ technology, and advanced information \nprocessing [15] (Fig. 2). These technologies\
    \ \nenable timely in-season and between-season \ncrop management. The implementation\
    \ of PA \ninvolves three primary steps: (1) gathering \ninformation on variability,\
    \ (2) processing and \nanalyzing the gathered information to evaluate its \nsignificance,\
    \ and (3) implementing changes in \ninput management. PA follows a cyclical process\
    \ \nthat becomes more refined with each year of \nusage by farm operators. Consequently,\
    \ each of \nthe three general steps may take several months \nto years to collectively\
    \ establish a stable and \nworkable structure, which remains open to \nfurther\
    \ amendments and refinements [16]. The \nimportance of PA emerged during the era\
    \ of \nagricultural mechanization in the 20th century, \ndriven by economic pressures\
    \ to apply uniform \nagronomic practices across large fields. PA \noffers a means\
    \ to automate Site-Specific \nManagement \n(SSM) \nthrough \ninformation \ntechnology,\
    \ thereby making SSM feasible in \ncommercial agriculture [17]. \n \nProximal\
    \ remote sensing has revolutionized \nprecision \nagriculture \nby \nproviding\
    \ \nvaluable \ninsights into crop health, soil conditions, and \nresource \nmanagement.\
    \ \nThe \ndetailed \ndata \ncollected through proximal remote sensing \ntechnologies\
    \ enables farmers and agronomists to \nmake informed decisions, optimize productivity,\
    \ \nand minimize environmental impact. Let's delve \ninto the specific applications\
    \ of proximal remote \nsensing in precision agriculture: \n \n3.1 Plant Health\
    \ Assessment \n \nProximal remote sensing plays a critical role in \nassessing\
    \ the health and vigor of crops. By \ncapturing \nhigh-resolution \ndata \non\
    \ \nplant \nparameters such as chlorophyll content, leaf area \nindex, and vegetation\
    \ indices (e.g., NDVI - \nNormalized \nDifference \nVegetation \nIndex), \nfarmers\
    \ can monitor plant health and detect early \nsigns of stress, diseases, or nutrient\
    \ deficiencies \n[18-20]. This information helps them identify \nspecific areas\
    \ within a field that require attention, \nenabling targeted interventions such\
    \ as adjusting \nirrigation, nutrient application, or implementing \npest control\
    \ measures [21-23]. \n \n3.2 Soil Moisture Monitoring \n \nEfficient water management\
    \ is essential for \nsustainable agriculture. Proximal remote sensing \nallows\
    \ farmers to monitor soil moisture levels \nacross their fields with high spatial\
    \ resolution \n \n \n \n \nVerma et al.; J. Exp. Agric. Int., vol. 45, no. 8,\
    \ pp. 162-176, 2023; Article no.JEAI.101915 \n \n \n \n166 \n \n[24,25]. By deploying\
    \ sensors that measure soil \nmoisture content, farmers can obtain real-time \n\
    data on soil moisture variations [26,27]. This \ninformation enables them to optimize\
    \ irrigation \npractices, ensuring that water is applied precisely \nwhere and\
    \ when it is needed [28,29]. By avoiding \nover- or under-irrigation, farmers\
    \ can conserve \nwater resources, minimize energy costs, and \nimprove crop yields\
    \ [30,31]. \n \n3.3 Nutrient Management \n \nProximal remote sensing aids in precise\
    \ nutrient \nmanagement by providing insights into nutrient \ndistribution and\
    \ uptake within fields [32,33]. By \nanalyzing data on vegetation indices and\
    \ nutrient \ncontent, farmers can identify areas with nutrient \ndeficiencies\
    \ or imbalances. This information \nguides them in applying fertilizers in a targeted\
    \ \nmanner, adjusting nutrient rates based on \nspecific field conditions [34,35].\
    \ This approach, \nknown as variable rate application, optimizes \nnutrient utilization,\
    \ minimizes waste, and reduces \nthe risk of environmental pollution [36]. Proximal\
    \ \nremote sensing also enables farmers to assess \nthe effectiveness of their\
    \ nutrient management \nstrategies and make data-driven adjustments for \nimproved\
    \ crop nutrition [37,38]. \n \n3.4 Weed and Pest Detection \n \nEarly detection\
    \ of weeds and pests is crucial for \neffective crop protection [39-41]. Weeds\
    \ are most \nsevere and widespread biological constraints to \ncrop production\
    \ [42-44]. Proximal remote sensing \nprovides a means to detect and monitor the\
    \ \npresence of weeds and pest infestations in a \ntimely manner [45-47]. By analyzing\
    \ high-\nresolution imagery, farmers can identify areas of \nthe field where weed\
    \ growth is prevalent or \nwhere pests have infiltrated [48]. This information\
    \ \nenables them to implement targeted weed \ncontrol measures, such as spot spraying\
    \ or \nmechanical removal, and take appropriate pest \nmanagement \nactions, \n\
    such \nas \nreleasing \nbeneficial insects or applying targeted pesticides \n\
    [49]. By accurately identifying and addressing \nweed and pest issues, farmers\
    \ can minimize \nyield losses and reduce the reliance on broad-\nspectrum chemicals\
    \ [50,51]. \n \n3.5 Crop Yield Estimation and Harvest \nPlanning \n \nProximal\
    \ remote sensing contributes to accurate \ncrop yield estimation and facilitates\
    \ effective \nharvest planning. By combining data on plant \nhealth, canopy density,\
    \ and biomass, farmers \ncan estimate crop yields with greater precision \n[52].\
    \ This information helps them optimize \nharvest timing and allocate resources\
    \ efficiently, \nincluding labor and storage facilities [53]. \nAccurate yield\
    \ estimation aids in crop marketing \nand financial planning, allowing farmers\
    \ to make \ninformed \ndecisions \nregarding \nmarket \nopportunities, storage\
    \ capacities, and post-\nharvest handling requirements. \n \n3.6 Precision Irrigation\
    \ and Variable Rate \nApplication \n \nProximal remote sensing enables precision\
    \ \nirrigation and variable rate application of inputs. \nBy analyzing data on\
    \ soil moisture levels, plant \nwater stress, and canopy evapotranspiration, \n\
    farmers can determine precise irrigation needs \nand deliver water in the right\
    \ amounts and at the \nright time [54,55]. This approach maximizes \nwater-use\
    \ efficiency, conserves resources, and \nminimizes the risk of over- or under-irrigation.\
    \ \nSimilarly, by integrating proximal remote sensing \ndata with information\
    \ on soil fertility, crop growth, \nand pest pressure, farmers can apply inputs\
    \ such \nas fertilizers, pesticides, and growth regulators at \nvariable rates\
    \ [56,57]. This targeted approach \noptimizes resource allocation, reduces input\
    \ \nwaste, and improves overall crop performance \n[58]. \n \n \n \nFig. 2. Crop\

    \ \nand \nenvironmental hazards [59,60]. By capturing \nhigh-resolution data from\
    \ a close range, this \ntechnology provides detailed information that is \nessential\
    \ for informed decision-making and \neffective environmental stewardship [61].\
    \ Let's \nexplore the diverse applications of proximal \nremote sensing in environmental\
    \ monitoring and \nmanagement: \n \n4.1 Ecosystem Health Assessment \n \nProximal\
    \ \nremote \nsensing \nenables \nthe \nassessment \nof \necosystem \nhealth \n\
    and \nbiodiversity. By capturing data on vegetation \nindices, \nspecies \ncomposition,\
    \ \nand \nhabitat \ncharacteristics, researchers and conservationists \ncan evaluate\
    \ the overall health and functioning of \necosystems [62]. This information helps\
    \ identify \nareas of concern, such as habitat fragmentation, \ninvasive species\
    \ encroachment, or degradation \ndue to human activities. Proximal remote sensing\
    \ \naids in monitoring changes in vegetation cover, \nidentifying \ncritical \n\
    habitats, \nand \ntracking \necological indicators to inform conservation \nstrategies\
    \ and protect biodiversity [63]. \n \n4.2 Land-use and Land Cover Mapping \n \n\
    Accurate land-use and land cover mapping is \nessential for effective land management\
    \ and \nplanning. Proximal remote sensing provides \ndetailed \ndata \non \nthe\
    \ \ndistribution \nand \ncharacteristics of different land cover types, \nincluding\
    \ forests, wetlands, agricultural areas, \nurban settlements, and water bodies\
    \ [64]. This \ninformation aids in monitoring land-use changes, \ndetecting deforestation,\
    \ urban expansion, and \nencroachment into sensitive areas. Proximal \nremote\
    \ sensing helps policymakers and land \nmanagers make informed decisions regarding\
    \ \nland \nallocation, \nconservation \nefforts, \nand \nsustainable development\
    \ practices [65]. \n \n4.3 Forest Monitoring and Management \n \nForests \nplay\
    \ \na \nvital \nrole \nin \nmaintaining \nbiodiversity, \ncarbon \nsequestration,\
    \ \nand \necosystem services. Proximal remote sensing \ntechniques, such as LiDAR\
    \ and hyperspectral \nimaging, enable detailed forest monitoring and \nmanagement.\
    \ By capturing three-dimensional \ninformation on forest structure, biomass, and\
    \ \ncanopy density, researchers can estimate carbon \nstocks, assess tree health,\
    \ and identify areas \nsusceptible to disturbances such as pest \noutbreaks or\
    \ wildfires [66]. Proximal remote \nsensing also aids in monitoring illegal logging\
    \ \nactivities, guiding reforestation efforts, and \nimplementing sustainable\
    \ forest management \npractices [67]. \n \n4.4 Water Resource Management \n \n\
    Proximal \nremote \nsensing \nprovides \ncritical \ninformation for water resource\
    \ management and \nmonitoring aquatic ecosystems. By capturing \ndata on water\
    \ quality parameters, such as \nturbidity, \nchlorophyll-a \nconcentration, \n\
    and \ntemperature, researchers can assess the health \nand pollution levels of\
    \ water bodies [68]. \nProximal remote sensing aids in detecting \nharmful algal\
    \ blooms, identifying sources of \npollution, and monitoring changes in aquatic\
    \ \nhabitats. This \ninformation guides decision-\nmaking related to water treatment,\
    \ pollution \ncontrol, and the conservation of sensitive aquatic \necosystems.\
    \ \n \n4.5 Disaster Management \n \nProximal remote sensing contributes to effective\
    \ \ndisaster management by providing real-time data \nand actionable insights\
    \ during emergencies. For \ninstance, during natural disasters such as floods,\
    \ \nhurricanes, or earthquakes, proximal remote \nsensing can assess the extent\
    \ of damage, \nidentify areas at risk, and aid in search and \nrescue operations\
    \ [69]. The technology can also \nmonitor \npost-disaster \nrecovery, \nassess\
    \ \ninfrastructure damage, and support decision-\nmaking regarding reconstruction\
    \ efforts. Proximal \nremote sensing helps authorities respond swiftly \nand efficiently\
    \ to mitigate the impacts of disasters \nand protect vulnerable communities [70].\

    \ \nremote \nsensing \noffers \nnumerous \nadvantages that have made it a valuable\
    \ tool in \nvarious fields. However, like any technology, it \nalso has certain\
    \ limitations to consider. Let's \ndelve into the advantages and limitations of\
    \ \nproximal remote sensing: \n \n5.1 Advantages \n \nHigh Spatial Resolution:\
    \ Proximal remote \nsensing allows data collection from a close \nrange, resulting\
    \ in high spatial resolution. This \ncapability enables the capture of detailed\
    \ \ninformation about the target area, such as fine-\nscale features, small objects,\
    \ or subtle changes \nin the environment. High spatial resolution \nenhances the\
    \ accuracy and precision of data \nanalysis, supporting more informed decision-\n\
    making [71]. \n \nReal-time Data Acquisition: Proximal remote \nsensing provides\
    \ real-time data acquisition, \nallowing for immediate analysis and response.\
    \ \nThis feature is particularly beneficial in time-\nsensitive \napplications,\
    \ \nsuch \nas \ndisaster \nmanagement, where timely information is crucial \n\
    for effective decision-making and response \nplanning [72]. Real-time data also\
    \ enables \ndynamic monitoring of changing environmental \nconditions, facilitating\
    \ adaptive management \nstrategies. \n \nImproved Data Accuracy: With proximal\
    \ remote \nsensing, data can be collected using specialized \nsensors tailored\
    \ to specific applications. These \nsensors are often calibrated and validated\
    \ for \naccurate measurements in controlled conditions. \nAs a result, the data\
    \ obtained through proximal \nremote sensing tends to have higher accuracy \n\
    compared to data acquired through other remote \nsensing platforms. \n \nFlexibility\
    \ \nin \nSensor \nSelection: Proximal \nremote sensing offers flexibility in choosing\
    \ \nsensor types based on the specific requirements \nof the application. Various\
    \ sensors, such as \nmultispectral, hyperspectral, LiDAR, or thermal \nsensors,\
    \ can be employed to capture different \ntypes of data. This flexibility allows\
    \ for the \ncustomization of data collection approaches, \noptimizing \nthe \n\
    information \nobtained \nand \nsupporting diverse applications [73]. \n \nTargeted\
    \ Data Collection: With proximal remote \nsensing, data collection can be targeted\
    \ to \nspecific areas of interest within a larger region. \nThis \nselective \n\
    approach \nminimizes \ndata \nredundancy and reduces the need for extensive \n\
    data storage and processing. Targeted data \ncollection \nis \nparticularly \n\
    advantageous \nin \nresource-constrained situations, where efficient \nuse of\
    \ resources is crucial [74]. \n \nInteroperability \nwith \nGround-based \nMeasurements:\
    \ Proximal remote sensing can \nbe seamlessly integrated with ground-based \n\
    measurements and observations. Researchers \ncan combine proximal remote sensing\
    \ data with \nfield measurements, such as soil samples or \nground truth observations,\
    \ to enhance the \naccuracy and reliability of their analyses. This \nintegration\
    \ of different data sources leads to a \nmore comprehensive understanding of the\
    \ target \narea. \n \nAccessibility and Cost-effectiveness: Proximal \nremote\
    \ sensing is often more accessible and \ncost-effective compared to traditional\
    \ remote \nsensing techniques. Ground-based platforms, \nsuch as handheld devices\
    \ or unmanned aerial \nvehicles (UAVs), offer greater accessibility and \noperational\
    \ flexibility. UAVs, in particular, have \nbecome more affordable and user-friendly,\
    \ \nallowing for efficient data collection over smaller \nto medium-sized areas\
    \ [75]. This accessibility \nand cost-effectiveness have facilitated the wider\
    \ \nadoption of proximal remote sensing in various \nsectors. \n \nReal-time Monitoring\
    \ and Instant Feedback: \nProximal remote sensing enables real-time \nmonitoring\
    \ and immediate feedback, as data can \nbe collected, processed, and analyzed\
    \ quickly. \nThis feature is particularly useful in applications \nsuch as precision\
    \ agriculture, where farmers can \nobtain instant information about the health\
    \ and \nnutrient status of crops, allowing them to make \ntimely \ndecisions \n\
    and \noptimize \nresource \nallocation. \n \n5.2 Limitations \n \nLimited Coverage\
    \ \nArea: Proximal remote \nsensing typically covers a smaller area compared \n\
    to satellite-based remote sensing. Ground-based \nplatforms and UAVs have range\

    \ the \nhigh spatial resolution of proximal remote \nsensing is advantageous,\
    \ it comes at the cost of \nlimited coverage [76]. \n  \nEnvironmental Constraints:\
    \ Proximal remote \nsensing \nis \nsusceptible \nto \nenvironmental \nconstraints\
    \ that can affect data collection. \nAdverse weather conditions, such as rain,\
    \ fog, or \nhigh winds, can impact data quality and limit data \ncollection opportunities\
    \ [77]. In dense vegetation \nor \nrugged \nterrains, \nobstacles \nand \nlimited\
    \ \naccessibility may pose challenges for deploying \nsensors or capturing data\
    \ from desired locations. \n  \nInvasive Data Collection: Proximal remote \nsensing\
    \ often involves placing sensors in close \nproximity to the target, which may\
    \ require \nphysical access to the site. This can be \nchallenging or even impossible\
    \ in certain \nenvironments or situations, such as inaccessible \nterrain, \n\
    hazardous \nlocations, \nor \nprivate \nproperties. Invasive data collection may\
    \ also \ndisturb the target area or interfere with the \nnatural processes being\
    \ studied. \n \nSkill and Expertise Requirements: Proximal \nremote sensing requires\
    \ skilled operators who \nare proficient in operating the sensors, data \ncollection\
    \ \nplatforms, \nand \ndata \nprocessing \nsoftware. Proper training and expertise\
    \ are \nnecessary to ensure accurate data collection, \nprocessing, and interpretation.\

    \ \n \nEquipment and Maintenance Costs: Proximal \nremote sensing often involves\
    \ the use of \nspecialized equipment, such as sensors, UAVs, \nor data processing\
    \ software, which can be costly. \nAdditionally, regular maintenance and calibration\
    \ \nof equipment are essential to ensure data \naccuracy and reliability. The\
    \ initial investment \nand ongoing maintenance costs can pose \nfinancial challenges,\
    \ particularly for smaller \norganizations or resource-constrained regions \n\
    [79]. \n \nTime-consuming Data Acquisition: Proximal \nremote sensing requires\
    \ the positioning of \nsensors and the collection of data from specific \nlocations.\
    \ This process can be time-consuming, \nespecially when studying larger areas\
    \ or multiple \ntargets. The need to set up and move sensors \nwithin the proximal\
    \ area may result in slower \ndata collection compared to satellite or aircraft-\n\
    based remote sensing, which can acquire data \nover larger regions simultaneously.\
    \ \n \nSensor Limitations: The choice of sensors for \nproximal remote sensing\
    \ is critical, as different \nsensors have specific strengths and limitations.\
    \ \nFor \nexample, \nsome \nsensors \nmay \nhave \nconstraints related to data\
    \ quality, sensitivity, or \nspectral range. It is important to carefully select\
    \ \nthe appropriate sensor for the desired application \nand ensure that its limitations\
    \ do not compromise \nthe accuracy or relevance of the collected data. \n \nData\
    \ Processing and Analysis: The large \nvolume of data collected through proximal\
    \ \nremote sensing requires efficient processing and \nanalysis techniques. Data\
    \ processing, image \nstitching, and analysis can be time-consuming \nand \ncomputationally\
    \ \nintensive. \nAdequate \ncomputational resources and expertise in data \nanalysis\
    \ are necessary to derive meaningful \ninsights from the collected data.  \n \n\
    Cost Implications: While proximal remote \nsensing \ncan \nbe \ncost-effective\
    \ \nfor \ncertain \napplications, it may require initial investments in \nequipment,\
    \ sensor calibration, and maintenance. \nDepending on the desired level of accuracy\
    \ and \nprecision, the cost of high-quality proximal \nremote sensing equipment\
    \ can be significant. \nAdditionally, specialized training and expertise \nmay\
    \ be necessary to operate the equipment and \nanalyze the collected data effectively,\
    \ further \nadding to the overall costs. \n \n6. FUTURE \nPERSPECTIVES \nOF \n\
    PROXIMAL REMOTE SENSING \n \nProximal remote sensing is a rapidly advancing \n\
    field with immense potential for the future. As \ntechnology \ncontinues \nto\
    \ \nevolve \nand \nnew \ninnovations \nemerge, \nthe \ncapabilities \nand \napplications\
    \ of proximal remote sensing are \nexpected to expand further. Here are some key\
    \ \nfuture perspectives for proximal remote sensing: \n \nAdvanced Sensor Technology:\
    \ The future will \nwitness advancements in sensor technology. \nThis will lead\
    \ to the development of more \nsophisticated and specialized sensors. These \n\
    sensors will offer improved capabilities for data \ncollection, such as higher\
    \ spectral resolution, \nenhanced sensitivity, and increased spatial \ncoverage.\
    \ Advancements in sensor technology \nwill enable more precise and comprehensive\
    \ \ndata acquisition, facilitating more accurate and \ndetailed analysis of target\
    \ areas. \n \n \n \n \nVerma et al.; J. Exp. Agric. Int., vol. 45, no. 8, pp.\

    \ Intelligence: The \nintegration \nof \nautomation \nand \nartificial \nintelligence\
    \ \n(AI) \nwill \nrevolutionize \nproximal \nremote sensing. AI algorithms can\
    \ automate data \nprocessing, analysis, and interpretation, reducing \nthe reliance\
    \ on manual intervention [80]. Machine \nlearning techniques will enable the development\
    \ \nof predictive models, classification algorithms, \nand anomaly detection systems,\
    \ enhancing the \nefficiency \nand \naccuracy of data analysis. \nAutomation and\
    \ AI will streamline workflows, \nsave time, and enable real-time decision-making\
    \ \n[81,82]. \n \nReal-time Data processing and Analytics: \nFuture developments\
    \ may focus on improving \nthe speed and efficiency of data processing and \n\
    analytics for proximal remote sensing. Real-time \nprocessing capabilities would\
    \ allow for immediate \nfeedback and decision-making, enabling users to \nrespond\
    \ quickly to changing conditions or events. \nAdvanced algorithms and machine\
    \ learning \ntechniques could be employed to automate data \nanalysis, \nextract\
    \ \nvaluable \ninformation, \nand \nprovide actionable insights in real-time.\
    \ \n \nMiniaturization \nand \nPortability: \nThe \nminiaturization of sensors\
    \ and the development \nof lightweight, portable devices will make \nproximal\
    \ remote sensing more accessible and \nuser-friendly. Smaller and more compact\
    \ sensor \nsystems will enable data collection in challenging \nterrains, confined\
    \ spaces, or remote locations. \nPortable proximal remote sensing platforms, \n\
    such as handheld devices or backpack-mounted \nsystems, will facilitate data collection\
    \ by field \nresearchers, \nenvironmentalists, \nand \nfirst \nresponders, enabling\
    \ rapid and on-site data \nanalysis [83,84]. \n \nIntegration with Other Technologies:\
    \ Proximal \nremote sensing will be integrated with other \nemerging \ntechnologies\
    \ \nto \nenhance \nits \ncapabilities. For example, the integration of \nproximal\
    \ remote sensing with unmanned aerial \nvehicles (UAVs) or drones will enable\
    \ efficient \nand widespread data collection over larger areas. \nThe combination\
    \ of proximal remote sensing with \nInternet of Things (IoT) devices will allow\
    \ for real-\ntime \ndata \nstreaming \nand \nmonitoring \nof \nenvironmental \n\
    parameters. \nIntegration \nwith \nsatellite-based remote sensing will enable\
    \ the \nfusion of data from different scales, providing a \nmore comprehensive\
    \ understanding of the \nEarth's surface [85,86]. \n \nEnhanced Data Storage and\
    \ Transmission: As \ndata \nvolumes \ncontinue \nto \nincrease, \nadvancements\
    \ in data storage and transmission \ntechnologies will be essential. More efficient\
    \ data \ncompression algorithms, cloud-based storage \nsolutions, and high-speed\
    \ data transmission \nnetworks will enable seamless data transfer and \nstorage.\
    \ This will facilitate the management of \nlarge-scale proximal remote sensing\
    \ datasets \nand enable easy access to historical data for \nlong-term environmental\
    \ monitoring and trend \nanalysis [87,88]. \n \nFusion of Proximal and Remote\
    \ Sensing \nData: The integration of proximal and remote \nsensing data holds\
    \ significant potential for \ncomprehensive \nand \nmulti-scale \nanalysis. \n\
    Combining data from proximal sensors with data \nacquired through satellite or\
    \ airborne platforms \ncan provide a more holistic understanding of the \ntarget\
    \ area, enabling a deeper exploration of \nspatial patterns, temporal dynamics,\
    \ and process \ninteractions. This fusion of data would contribute \nto more accurate\
    \ and robust interpretations, \nparticularly \nfor \napplications \nsuch \nas\
    \ \nenvironmental monitoring, precision agriculture, \nand infrastructure assessment.\
    \ \n \nExpanded \nApplications: \nProximal \nremote \nsensing will find new and\
    \ expanded applications \nacross various sectors. It will play a significant \n\
    role in precision agriculture, enabling farmers to \noptimize \nresource \nmanagement,\
    \ \nenhance \nproductivity, and promote sustainable practices. \nIn \nurban \n\
    planning \nand \ninfrastructure \ndevelopment, proximal remote sensing will aid\
    \ in \nland-use \nmapping, \nmonitoring \nconstruction \nactivities, and assessing\
    \ environmental impacts \n[89,90]. In ecological research and conservation, \n\
    it will contribute to habitat mapping, biodiversity \nassessment, and monitoring\
    \ of endangered \nspecies. The applications of proximal remote \nsensing in disaster\
    \ management, climate change \nmonitoring, and public health surveillance are\
    \ \nalso expected to grow [91,92]. \n \nEnhanced Spectral and Spatial Capabilities:\
    \ \nFuture developments may focus on enhancing \nthe spectral and spatial capabilities\
    \ of proximal \nremote sensing sensors. Improvements in sensor \ntechnology could\
    \ enable the capture of a wider \nrange of spectral bands, including the utilization\
    \ \nof hyperspectral or multispectral sensors for \nmore detailed and precise\
    \ data acquisition. \nSimilarly, advancements in spatial resolution \ncould allow\

    Internet of Tings (IoT) refers to a vast network that provides an interconnection
    between various objects and intelligent devices.

    Te three important components of IoT are sensing, processing, and transmission
    of data. Nowadays, the new IoT technology is

    used in many diﬀerent sectors, including the domestic, healthcare, telecommunications,
    environment, industry, construction,

    water management, and energy. IoT technology, involving the usage of embedded
    devices, diﬀers from computers, laptops, and

    mobile devices. Due to exchanging personal data generated by sensors and the possibility
    of combining both real and virtual

    worlds, security is becoming crucial for IoTsystems. Furthermore, IoTrequires
    lightweight encryption techniques. Terefore, the

    goal of this paper is to identify the security challenges and key issues that
    are likely to arise in the IoTenvironment in order to guide

    authentication techniques to achieve a secure IoT service.

    1. Introduction

    In recent years, technology sector has known a real evolu-

    tion. Furthermore, it has become an indispensable tool in

    our everyday life. Among these recent technologies, the

    Internet of Tings (IoT) has been improved continuously

    and has attracted more and more people. Tis growth has

    positively impacted many sectors, including social security,

    agriculture, education, water management, house security,

    smart grid, and so on. Terefore, the number of connected

    devices is increasing day after day. According to Strategy

    Analytics, the connected objects will reach more than 38

    billion by the end of 2025 and 50 billion by 2030 [1].

    IoT is a new technology that allows the implementation

    of systems interconnecting several objects, either in the

    physical or virtual world [2, 3]. In fact, the evolution of the

    Internet began with the creation of a simple computer

    network linking personal computers and then moved on to

    client-server architecture networks, World Wide Web,

    e-mail, ﬁle sharing, etc. Subsequently, it now reaches a wide

    area network interconnecting billions of intelligent objects,

    which were embedded in sophisticated systems. Teir op-

    eration is based on sensors and actuators designed for

    monitoring, controlling, and interacting with the physical

    environment where they exist.

    Despite many advantages, IoT has three main problems

    that are data collection, data transmission, and data security.

    To collect data, many sensing tools have been introduced

    and adapted to the IoT devices. For transferring collected

    data, various protocols have been developed and adapted in

    order to enable to the IoT devices to connect to existed

    networks and exchange data. However, for the last one, it

    does not give the attention that it merits. Consequently,

    many classic and recent security issues are closely related to

    the IoT as well as authentication, data security, authoriza-

    tion, etc. Indeed, a weakness in authentication can lead to

    numerous attacks, including replay attack, Denning–Sacco

    attack, denial of service attack, password guessing attack, etc.

    On the other hand, the authentication of IoT devices

    throughout heterogonous and interconnected protocols is a

    great challenge. Moreover, these protocols should take into

    account issues related to limitation of IoT devices as well as

    energy consumption, small memory size, and low processing

    capability [4–33].

    In the literature review, previous studies [34–45] have

    surveyed the security of IoT technology. However, our study

    reveals some security challenges and issues of IoT. Conse-

    quently, the focus of this review paper is to categorize the

    security tasks and topics that are encountered in the IoT

    environment. Hence, we provide here a short guidance to

    researchers to accomplish secure IoT services like authen-

    tication, access control, and so on.

    Te remainder of this paper is organized as follows. In

    Section 2, IoT architecture is detailed. Section 3 is reserved

    for discussing IoT security issues. IoT security requirements

    are presented in Section 4. In Section 5, we compare some

    authentication approaches applied in IoT authentication

    environment. Finally, conclusions are given in Section 6.

    2. IoT Architecture

    Te concept “Internet of Tings” may be deﬁned as a

    standard that refers to a large network connecting various

    sensors, actuators, and microcontrollers introduced in

    distinct objects. A large number of interconnected equip-

    ment such as smartphone, industrial machines, computers,

    vehicles, medical tools, irrigation system, TVs, or refriger-

    ators can be part of the IoT [46]. Furthermore, IoTis a rather

    recent design that stands out from its antecedents, including

    all traditional, mobile, and sensor-based Internet networks.

    IoT includes a very large number of hybrid terminals. Since

    the majority of these devices can be connected to the In-

    ternet, they generally support common web techniques,

    including HTTP, JSON, XML, etc. One of the strengths of

    this technology is that it is well supported and can therefore

    be adapted to diﬀerent existing infrastructures. Further-

    more, some new protocols are especially considered for IoT,

    for example, CoAP and MQTTare alternatives to HTTP and

    6LoWPAN is also an alternative of IPv4/IPv6.

    Due to non-standardization of IoT, there are various

    architectures that are diﬀerent [47]. However, we focus here

    on two known ones that are three- and ﬁve-layer archi-

    tectures. As illustrated in Figure 1, the three-layer archi-

    tecture consists of three layers including perception,

    networking, and application layers. Te role of each layer is

    described in the following.

    (i) Te perception layer is the ﬁrst layer of IoT ar-

    chitecture. It is connected to the physical world for

    sensing and collecting data from their environment.

    Tis layer consists of sensors and actuators to

    measure some values such as temperature, pH, light,

    gas, and so on, and to detect some functionality such

    as location and motion.

    (ii) Te network layer is the second layer; its role is to

    connect to various smart devices, gateways, and

    servers. It is responsible for transferring the

    captured values to other IoT network components.

    For these reasons, IoT uses several kinds of com-

    munication protocols and norms such as 4G/5G,

    Wi-Fi, ZigBee, Bluetooth, 6LoWPAN, WiMAX, and

    so on [48].

    (iii) Te application layer can oﬀer the speciﬁc service

    requested by user. For instance, this application can

    provide doctors some health parameters of patients.

    Tis layer determines which applications can be

    installed, such as smart environment [49–52], smart

    homes [53–55], and water monitoring [56, 57].

    On the other hand, the ﬁve-layer architecture includes

    processing and business layers in addition to the three

    previous ones. As depicted in Figure 2, the ﬁve layers are

    perception, transport, processing, application, and business

    layers. Te responsibilities of perception, transport, and

    application layers are identical to the similar layers in three-

    layer architecture. Te roles of the addition layers are de-

    tailed as follows:

    (i) Te processing layer is also recognized as the mid-

    dleware layer. It is responsible for controlling, an-

    alyzing, processing, and storing received data. It can

    make decisions according to the processing data

    without human intervention. Tis layer beneﬁts

    from existing solutions including cloud computing,

    big data, and databases.

    (ii) Te business layer has a responsibility to manage the

    whole IoT systems [47]. So, its role is to control ap-

    plications, business, and proﬁt models. Furthermore,

    the users’ privacy can be managed by this layer.

    3.1. DOS. Denial of service (DOS) is a security attack that

    aims to prevent legitimate user and entity to have an au-

    thorized access to network resources. It is considered as the

    most popular and dominant attack. Generally, attackers can

    use ﬂooding attack to exhaust system’s resources including

    memory, CPU, and bandwidth [58–63]. Tus, he either

    prevents the system to provide service or he makes it in-

    eﬀective. In this attack, pirates can use numerous skills such

    as sending unwanted packets or ﬂooding network with

    multiple messages. Terefore, legitimate users are prevented

    from taking advantage of services.

    3.2. Replay Attack. Replay attack is among old attacks on

    communication network, especially on authentication and

    key exchanging protocols. It allows the pirate to capture and

    store a fragment or the whole of captured session in a le-

    gitimate traﬃc [64, 65]. After gaining the trust in a public

    network, the attacker either sends the captured message to

    the entity that has participated in origin session or to another

    diﬀerent destination [66]. Terefore, in IoTnetworks, replay

    attack is measured as a security weakness in which particular

    data are stored without any authorization before been sent

    back to the receiver. Te goal of this attack is to trap the

    person in an unauthorized operation [67]. For example, in a

    smart home system, a temperature sensor is used to detect

    the temperature and then the measured values are sent to

    system controller. Based on these values, the system can run

    or stop the air conditioner to adapt the air temperature as

    desired by the personnel. However, if an attacker has pirated

    the sensor’s temperature, he can save the day’s values and

    send them at night. As result, the air conditioner will not be

    functioning normally.

    To deal with replay attack, current solutions use three

    main mechanisms including timestamp, nonce, and re-

    sponse-challenge. Te ﬁrst one is the mechanism that helps

    to detect replay attack by checking the freshness of received

    message. Nonetheless, it is hard to assure time synchroni-

    zation between IoT objects [68]. Te second mechanism is

    the nonce, which is a series of random digits. However, the

    problem of this mechanism is that the node has no suﬃcient

    memory for keeping the list of received nonces. Te last

    mechanism is the challenge-response. It has as objective to

    verify that the other party can resolve some challenges. But

    this technique necessitates that the two entities have a

    preshared secret.

    3.3. Password Guessing Attack. Due to the importance of

    password in authentication process and its large adoption by

    numerous authentication protocols, pirates have invented

    various attacks to get the correct one. Hence, the most used

    attack is password guessing. Particularly, this attack can be

    executed either online or oﬄine. In this attack, an attacker

    eavesdrops on the communication between two entities

    during authentication phase to get some useful values. Ten,

    attacker must guess all probable passwords to succeed in the

    authentication [60, 69–75].

    3.4. Spooﬁng Attack. In the network security context,

    spooﬁng attack is a situation when an unauthorized entity

    produces falsiﬁed parameter [76]. Te goal of this attack is to

    make servers believe that the attacker is an authorized entity

    [62]. So, the pirate gains the trust of the authority. For

    example, in smart health, the pirate can send fake infor-

    mation to authentication server. So, if he performed the

    authentication phase successfully, he can request victim’s

    sensor and then get the secret health information about this

    victim [38, 77–79].

    3.5. Insider Attack. In cyber security ﬁeld, insider attack

    occurs when a legitimate entity that has an authorized access

    tries to harm the system. Te action of authorized entity can

    be either intentional or accidental [80–84]. In both cases, the

    system is considered vulnerable and we should ﬁnd out the

    solution in the short term. According to [85], more than 57%

    of conﬁdential business data are targeted by insider attack.

    On the other hand, the study [86] conﬁrms that more than

    60% of existing attacks have been completed by insider.

    4. Required Security Services for IoT

    After debating various security attacks applied by attackers,

    this section mentions some security services. Tus, the

    objective of this section is to discuss the security require-

    ments for IoTdevices. As illustrated in Table 1, IoTsolutions

    must come with some basic security services including

    authorization, authentication, conﬁdentiality, availability,

    integrity, and non-repudiation.

    4.1. Conﬁdentiality. Generally, conﬁdentiality can be de-

    ﬁned as the capability and aptitude to prevent an unau-

    thorized user to access private data. Terefore, it promises

    and guarantees that the personal information is only con-

    sulted, edited, or removed by authorized entity [38]. Par-

    ticularly, in the Internet of Tings network, conﬁdentiality is

    one of the signiﬁcant security services. However, the con-

    ﬁdentiality is the most attacked service [87]. For example,

    viruses, spywares, and Trojans are considered as malware

    applications that attack the conﬁdentiality of the user’s

    private data. Tey can interact with system as executable

    codes or scripts with the aim to have an unauthorized access

    [88].

    In an IoT context, for warranting and assuring the

    conﬁdentiality of personal information captured by sensors

    and for preventing them from being discovered by the third

    party, the encryption algorithms and cryptographic methods

    can be used [89]. Terefore, all transmitted data between two

    devices must be encrypted. As a result, nobody can un-

    derstand the message except legitimate entities [90].

    4.2. Availability. An alternative required security service of

    IoT is the availability of resources to the legitimate entities

    independent of where and when they exist. Availability

    denotes that the resources and information must be easily

    reached by the legitimate user when he wants [91]. More-

    over, in the IoT architecture, the sensor is available if it can

    communicate the sensed values in real time.

    Likewise, the availability of an actuator means that it can

    execute user received commands immediately without any

    remarkable delay.

    Te availability of some particular resources could be

    interrupted as consequences of usage of dissimilar data

    transmission channel, networks, and protocols [46]. On the

    other hand, for damaging the availability, attackers may use

    three main malicious attacks including denial of service

    (DOS) attack, ﬂooding attack, or black hole attack. For the

    ﬁrst one, it is probably practiced in the availability situation.

    Pirates can use the simple denial of service (DOS) attack or

    distributed denial of service (DDOS) attack that necessitates

    the collaboration between various resources. For the

    ﬂooding attack, the attacker can ﬂood the networks by

    unwanted messages and commands for exhausting device

    resources. Tis attack not only targets bandwidth but also

    decreases CPU and memory capabilities. So, the device will

    not be reached or the communication will be slow [92].

    In order to guarantee the availability of appropriate

    resources, we can select distributed approach for operating

    the system and use numerous platforms which simplify the

    incorporation of various systems remotely [76].

    4.3. Authentication. Authentication service is considered

    the biggest challenge in the IoT network. It includes veri-

    ﬁcation of identity. On the one hand, in the authentication

    procedure, the devices must be able to check the validity and

    legitimacy of remote use in a public network. On the other

    hand, authentication prevents unauthorized person to take

    part in a private secured communication [38]. Previous

    authentication schemes are based on single factor that is a

    simple password. However, these schemes have to face

    various issues related to the password. First of all, users can

    easily forget the password. Secondly, users may have weak

    password. Finally, attackers are able to guess the correct

    password, either using exhaustive research attack or dic-

    tionary attack. Accordingly, password-based authentication

    is not enough to promise security. In our days, authenti-

    cation schemes based on smart card oﬀer multifactor au-

    thentication [4–9]. Typically, the system requires two factors

    including a valid smart card and correct preshared secret.

    Even so, it comprises the use of biometric print.

    Due to

    the important

    position of authentication

    mechanism in the Internet of Tings security, we have re-

    served the two following sections for discussing various

    techniques used for authentication in IoT and for studying

    some proposed IoT authentication schemes.

    4.4. Authorization. With the growth of number of con-

    nected objects to the Internet network, authorization is

    becoming a critical issue in the IoTsystem. In fact, it refers to

    the security service responsible for determining user right

    and privileges (read, write, or delete). It identiﬁes also the

    access control rules to allow or deny permissions to the IoT

    devices. Tus, the challenge is to prevent users with limited

    privileges to get additional ones to have an unauthorized

    access to devices and their data [93–97].

    4.5. Integrity. Integrity means that the message was not

    reformed by an unauthorized entity in the transmission

    session. So, it guarantees that the receiver has received

    exactly what the source has sent. Te main objective is to

    stop an unauthorized object doing illegal modiﬁcation.

    For sustaining the safety of smart devices in IoTnetwork,

    the system should guarantee data integrity. Terefore, nei-

    ther unauthorized objects nor user access should be granted.

    Besides, the cryptography and encryption mechanisms can

    be applied when the transmitted data are very important

    [37]. For instance, the authors of [98] suggested the usage of

    HMAC-SHA 256 algorithm for reassuring data integrity.

    4.6. Non-Repudiation. Non-repudiation is one of the se-

    curity aspects, which insures that communication members

    have ability to send or receive information in its integrality

    [99]. In addition, it makes conﬁdent that the transfer of data

    or identiﬁcations between two IoT objects is undeniable

    [100]. Non-repudiation guarantees to a source node to send

    its data, as well as to a receiving node to conﬁrm that the

    received data are matching with data’s source [34].

    5. IoT Authentication Techniques

    Due to the ability of IoT to access to all users’ information,

    the user’s private life must be protected against the malicious

    attacks. Furthermore, the devices should not be accessed by

    unauthorized users. So, it is necessary to check the user’s

    identity before getting the authorization. Hence, the veri-

    ﬁcation of user’s identity can be done in many ways.

    Nevertheless, the most frequently used is authentication

    system, which is based on the prior sharing secrets, keys, or

    passwords. Consequently, in this section, we review the

    techniques that are applied for reinforcing the authentica-

    tion in IoT environment.

    5.1. One Time Password Authentication. One time password

    (OTP) which is also called dynamic password is a password

    that is valid for authentication in one transaction. In the

    literature survey, various OTP authentication protocols are

    proposed for securing the communication in IoT environ-

    ment. Tese protocols are founded based on various

    mechanisms such as time synchronization, hash factions

    (MD5, SHA1, and SHA256), and cryptography RSA. Be-

    sides, they are all based on the OTP algorithm created by

    Lamport [101–104]. Unfortunately, these protocols are

    vulnerable against some attacks as described in [105–108].

    On the other hand, for reinforcing the OTP authenti-

    cation, Lee and Kim [109] proposed in 2013 an insider at-

    tack-resistant

    OTP

    scheme

    based

    on

    bilinear

    maps.

    However, it needs complex computation. Based on this

    problem, Shivraj et al. [110] proposed a robust OTP scheme

    for IoT. Te proposed protocol uses the principles of

    lightweight identity-based elliptic curve cryptography and

    Lamport’s OTP algorithm.

    5.2. ECC-Based Mutual Authentication. Generally, IoT de-

    vices have a limited resources. Besides, the communication

    between sensors, actuators, objects, and nodes must be in

    real time. For these reasons, it is indispensable to propose a

    lightweight authentication protocol for IoT. Accordingly,

    Azrour et al. [71] proposed an eﬃcient authentication

    scheme for IoT. Tis protocol is based on elliptic curve

    cryptography (ECC) which is measured better than the

    traditional RSA encryption algorithm. Furthermore, in

    addition, various authentication protocol based on ECC are

    proposed in [111–115]. Elliptic curve cryptography is

    considered more eﬃcient and more secure especially for

    systems with limited memory and processing capabilities.

    5.3. ID- and Password-Based Authentication. ID-based au-

    thentication is an approach for distinguishing authorized

    entities from illegal ones. According to ID, the user is either

    allowed or denied to access the resource. User ID refers to all

    attributes that can characterize one user form another, for

    instance, username, e-mail, phone number, IP address, etc.

    In IoT environment, numerous protocols are proposed

    [74, 116–118] based on this technique. However, this

    method is generally adopted in the server/client authenti-

    cation architecture. In view of that, a server is required in

    IoT environment for storing user’s ID and secret in server’s

    database.

    On the other hand, the usage of ID-based authentication

    approach has some issues that are detailed in following lines.

    Firstly, how user’s data are stored in server? Is the server

    capable to protect them against stolen veriﬁer attack and

    insider attack? Secondly, users may forget their authenti-

    cation parameters. Terefore, they cannot perform the next

    authentication. In this case, it is not suitable to save personal

    ID in an electronic device (laptop, tablet, and smartphone),

    even if it is not connected to public network. Tirdly, the

    transmission of user ID in public network is another

    challenge. In this situation, the hash functions or cryptog-

    raphy algorithm are recommended.

    5.4. Certiﬁcate-Based Authentication. For addressing prob-

    lems of ID- and password-based authentication, an alternative

    approach was proposed [119]. Tis technique is called certif-

    icate-based authentication. Certiﬁcate-based authentication

    has been commonly adopted by multiple applications. For

    example, in order to verify user''s identity in banking appli-

    cation, Hiltgen et al. [120] proposed a new certiﬁcate-based

    authentication scheme. Tis approach has been also used in

    IoT environment [120–124]. Although certiﬁcate-based au-

    thentication provides more security, device certiﬁcate pro-

    cessing and used algorithms necessitate a high processing

    resource, which is not always available in IoT devices. As a

    result, this approach is not suitable for IoT objects [125].

    5.5.Blockchain. Blockchain is a particular sort of database.

    It is diﬀerent from a traditional database because of the

    speciﬁc way in which it stores data. Blockchains save data

    in a series of blocks that are then linked to each other. In

    recent years, diﬀerent authors have taken advantage of

    this recent technology to propose authentication protocol

    for IoT [22, 31–33, 126, 127]. Te sustainability and

    veriﬁcation of the data stored in the blockchain provide

    Security and Communication Networks

    5

    the conﬁdence to use accurately recorded data in the

    future and at the same time provide transparency, ano-

    nymity, and traceability.

    Multiple and diﬀerent authentication methods are used

    in the IoT environment. As demonstrated in Table 2, the

    majority of proposed IoTauthentication protocols are based

    on encryption cryptography. In this situation, two types of

    cryptography are used. Te ﬁrst type is asymmetric en-

    cryption algorithm such as ECC, while the second one is

    symmetric encryption algorithm like AES. Furthermore, the

    hash functions are utilized in some authentication for

    hashing essential parameters. Finally, the random numbers

    are also adopted in certain protocol as they can be used to

    ensure the freshness of messages.

    On the other hand, the advantages and limitations of

    some selected IoT authentication protocols are depicted in

    Table 3. As we can notice, the protocol is considered eﬀective

    only if it is lightweight as well as fulﬁls all security re-

    quirements. To sum up, we can conclude that the running

    time and processing time are important due to the limitation

    capability of IoT devices.

    6. Conclusions

    Internet of Tings has a signiﬁcant role in the rapid de-

    velopment that recent technology has known recently. Tese

    technologies have made the exchange of data easier.

    However, the security of user’s data should not be ignored.

    Accordingly, the study performed in this paper is mainly

    focused on the security of IoTtechnology. Hence, as we have

    mentioned before, IoT suﬀers from several attacks, namely,

    DOS, password guessing, replay, and insider attacks. Au-

    thentication is the ﬁrst security services that IoT has to

    satisfy, so we have detailed the authentication approaches

    adopted for IoT. Te most techniques used for rienforcing

    the authentication are one time password, ECC-based

    mutual authetication, ID-based authentication, certiﬁcate-

    based authentication, and blockchain. After comparing re-

    cent authentication protocols, we have concluded that the

    majority of them is based on encryption cryptography.

    Finally, in our future work, we will try to enhance the

    security of IoT environment by proposing secure and eﬃ-

    cient IoT authentication schemes.

    Digital Twins (DTs) have successfully entered industrial applications, including\
    \ aerospace,\nmanufacturing, and healthcare [1–3]. Smart farming, on the other\
    \ hand, which employs\nthe latest technological innovations to optimize crop production,\
    \ is revolutionizing the\nagriculture industry. As virtual replicas of physical\
    \ objects or systems, DTs represent a\nhighly promising advancement in this ﬁeld\
    \ [4]. In smart farming, digital twins enable\nagriculture experts, researchers,\
    \ and farmers to simulate various scenarios, test different\nstrategies, and predict\
    \ outcomes accurately. DTs in smart farming offer transformative\npossibilities,\
    \ revolutionizing crop cultivation and management while enabling optimization\n\
    of resource utilization, minimizing environmental footprint, and enhancing crop\
    \ yields for\na sustainable and efﬁcient agricultural ecosystem.\nHowever, despite\
    \ the signiﬁcant promise of digital twins in smart farming, many\nquestions and\
    \ challenges still need to be addressed. Farming, a traditionally labor-intensive\n\
    sector, after its transformation to a technology-intensive sector in the last\
    \ decade, has\nSensors 2023, 23, 7128. https://doi.org/10.3390/s23167128\nhttps://www.mdpi.com/journal/sensors\n\
    Sensors 2023, 23, 7128\n2 of 38\nbecome more complex and technologically advanced\
    \ in recent years, moving toward inno-\nvative technologies, particularly with\
    \ the explosion of precision agriculture and other digital\ntechnologies [5].\
    \ These technologies help farmers make more informed decisions about crop\nmanagement,\
    \ soil health, and various factors inﬂuencing crop yields and economic viability,\n\
    enhancing overall agricultural productivity and proﬁtability. However, these technologies\n\
    can also require specialized knowledge and skills and signiﬁcant investment in\
    \ hardware,\nsoftware, and other infrastructural resources. Additionally, factors\
    \ such as climate change,\nchanging consumer preferences, and market ﬂuctuations\
    \ can add to the complexity of\nmodern farming. While these challenges can make\
    \ farming more complicated, they also\noffer opportunities for innovation and\
    \ growth in the agriculture domain.\nIn this era of smart farming, the incorporation\
    \ of cutting-edge technologies such\nas computing, communication, personal and\
    \ cloud computing, the Internet of Things\n(IoT), Artiﬁcial Intelligence (AI),\
    \ and Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS) has revolutionized\nthe landscape in agriculture.\
    \ These technologies bring additional capabilities beyond the\nphysical realm,\
    \ allowing for enhanced information and an improved understanding of\nthe physical\
    \ structures involved. The concept of DTs plays a pivotal role in providing\n\
    comprehensive and accurate information about physical systems, surpassing the\
    \ limita-\ntions of traditional modelling and simulation approaches. By leveraging\
    \ real-time data\ncollection, processing, and analysis, DTs offer a digital representation\
    \ of physical systems,\nenabling precise monitoring and forecasting of current\
    \ and future system states and re-\nbuilding existing models and re-design systems\
    \ and procedures. These advancements are\ninstrumental in transforming smart systems\
    \ and addressing the evolving challenges in the\nagricultural domain.\nThis review\
    \ paper offers a comprehensive and distinctive outline of the recent research\n\
    results regarding DTs in the context of smart agriculture, highlighting key ﬁndings\
    \ and\nidentifying areas for future research. Speciﬁcally, we report and discuss\
    \ the various types\nof digital twins used in smart farming, such as crop, weather,\
    \ and soil models, and explore\nhow they optimize crop production. We also examine\
    \ the challenges and limitations\nof deploying DTs in smart farming related to\
    \ data management, model accuracy, and\nscalability. By providing a comprehensive\
    \ review of the literature on DTs in smart farming,\nthis paper aims to advance\
    \ the understanding of this rapidly evolving ﬁeld, illustrate the\ngaps in existing\
    \ deployments, and identify opportunities for future research and innovation.\n\
    We proceeded with our research by pursuing the formulation of the DT implementa-\n\
    tion architecture regarding the smart agriculture domain while emphasizing the\
    \ critical\ncomponents taking part in implementing DTs. A comparative accumulation\
    \ of such im-\nplementations and critical components in three tables, while addressing\
    \ technical aspects,\nled to signiﬁcant conclusions regarding DT implementations\
    \ and related limitations that\nseem beneﬁcial to investigate. For example, although\
    \ the necessity of a DT model and\npractical implementations in agriculture is\
    \ addressed in most reviewed papers mentioning\nthe concept and deﬁnition, the\
    \ DT model is proposed merely as an evolving concept lacking\nsubstantial support\
    \ from implemented case studies. While the DTs seem continuously\nevolving, authors\
    \ refer to simulation models merely as proposals for future practical im-\nplementation.\
    \ Our research seeks to expand the scope of Agriculture 4.0 that necessitates\n\
    DTs and address the limitations of IoT-implemented solutions narrowed down by\
    \ mere\ntelemetry implementations.\nThe structure of this study proceeds as follows:\
    \ Section 2 delves into the concept of\nDTs and investigates their usage in the\
    \ realm of smart farming. Section 3 addresses the\nchallenges and confronting\
    \ measures regarding DT building components and relevant\ntechnologies. In Section\
    \ 4, DT applications in the agricultural domain are reviewed, while\nconclusions\
    \ and comments are unfolded in the Discussion in Section 5. Finally, in Section\
    \ 6,\nfuture directions for research and development are outlined respectively.\n\
    Sensors 2023, 23, 7128\n3 of 38\n2. The Deﬁnition of Digital Twins\nThe fundamental\
    \ concept of a DT, which involves a connected virtual representation\nof a physical\
    \ object or system [6], appears to be relatively straightforward. However, its\n\
    application and implementation can differ significantly across various domains\
    \ and industries.\nAlthough it is quite clear that in addition to their core purpose\
    \ of modelling real-\nworld systems, DTs are designed to empower individuals to\
    \ make informed business\ndecisions with tangible impacts on the physical realm,\
    \ a clear deﬁnition of the DT concept\nmay be helpful to distinguish it from related\
    \ concepts such as simulation, modelling, and\ndata analytics. By deﬁning its\
    \ scope, characteristics, and capabilities, researchers and\npractitioners can\
    \ better identify the speciﬁc features and requirements that make a system\na\
    \ true DT.\n2.1. Deﬁnition of Digital Twins—What Does Digital Twins Term Stand\
    \ For?\nThe deﬁnition of DTs emerged in the early 2000s by Michael Grieves [6]\
    \ while evolving\nto a widely acceptable DT concept model where they act as a\
    \ bridge connecting physical\nentities in the real world with their virtual complements\
    \ in a digital environment, closing\nthe gap between the two. They establish vital\
    \ connections between data and information\nto seamlessly integrate these products’\
    \ virtual and real aspects [6,7]. The convergence\nof virtual and physical entities\
    \ in a virtual space and the real world lays the foundation\nfor creating a fundamental\
    \ DT model. By fostering dynamic interplay between these\ntangible and virtual\
    \ elements, the DT is a powerful representation of the combined physical-\nvirtual\
    \ system.\nMashaly M. in [8] outlines that DTs act as digital replicas of physical\
    \ systems and are\norganized by establishing data connections. This transformation\
    \ enables physical systems\nto exist virtually while ensuring a strong synchronization\
    \ between their physical and digital\ncounterparts. As a result, smooth interactions\
    \ and data exchange occur between the two\ndomains. The integration of the physical\
    \ and virtual domains provides valuable insights,\npredictive abilities, and the\
    \ potential for optimizing system performance following the\npattern illustrated\
    \ in Figure 1.\nSensors 2023, 23, 7128 \n3 of 39 \n \n \n2. The Definition of\

    \ real aspects [6,7]. The conver-\ngence of virtual and physical entities in a\
    \ virtual space and the real world lays the foun-\ndation for creating a fundamental\
    \ DT model. By fostering dynamic interplay between \nthese tangible and virtual\
    \ elements, the DT is a powerful representation of the combined \nphysical-virtual\
    \ system. \nMashaly M. in [8] outlines that DTs act as digital replicas of physical\
    \ systems and are \norganized by establishing data connections. This transformation\
    \ enables physical systems \nto exist virtually while ensuring a strong synchronization\
    \ between their physical and dig-\nital counterparts. As a result, smooth interactions\
    \ and data exchange occur between the \ntwo domains. The integration of the physical\
    \ and virtual domains provides valuable in-\nsights, predictive abilities, and\
    \ the potential for optimizing system performance following \nthe pattern illustrated\
    \ in Figure 1. \n \nFigure 1. The generic representation of a DT scheme’s dynamic\
    \ integration of physical and digital \ndomains. \nFigure 1. The generic representation\
    \ of a DT scheme’s dynamic integration of physical and digital domains.\nAccording\
    \ to Dyck G. et al. [9], the concept of DTs emerged from NASA’s pioneering\nwork\
    \ in integrating physical models and simulations [10,11] to analyze intricate\
    \ systems.\nOriginally conﬁned to the aerospace sector, the scope of DTs expanded\
    \ to encompass\nproduct lifecycle management across diverse industries. At its\
    \ core, as initially proposed\nSensors 2023, 23, 7128\n4 of 38\nby Grieves & Vickers\
    \ [6,7,12], a DT comprises a physical object, its corresponding digi-\ntal representation,\
    \ and the interconnectedness between the two that it is established for\nboth\
    \ ways.\nOngoing research continues to explore the wide-ranging applications and\
    \ integration\nas interfaces of the DTs in areas such as cloud manufacturing,\
    \ IoT, and Industry 4.0,\nwhere explicitly stated that the provided response is\
    \ a unique formulation based on the\ngiven information [13,14].\nHence, DTs serve\
    \ as virtual counterparts of real-world entities, created using sensor\ndata and\
    \ serving as dynamic representations of physical objects or systems throughout\n\
    various stages of their lifecycle. By harnessing the power of simulation and data\
    \ integration,\nDTs provide a comprehensive virtual environment that mirrors the\
    \ characteristics and\nbehaviour of their physical counterparts. This enables\
    \ continuous real-time monitoring,\nanalysis, and enhancement of the physical\
    \ objects or systems, resulting in enhanced perfor-\nmance, efﬁciency, and informed\
    \ decision-making, as stated by Saddik et al. in 2018 [1].\nDTs utilize actual\
    \ data from real-life situations, machine learning (ML) models, and\nsimulation\
    \ combined with data analysis to enhance comprehension, learning, and decision-\n\
    making processes. They enable the monitoring and control of various entities,\
    \ including\ndevices, machines, vehicles, and individuals. The proliferation of\
    \ the IoT has spurred\nthe advancement of diverse DT solutions across diverse\
    \ domains and use cases support-\ning simulation, optimization, and prediction.\
    \ Thus, major improvement steps have been\ntaken in the realm of decision-making\
    \ so that various sectors, including manufacturing,\nhealthcare, and smart cities,\
    \ have witnessed signiﬁcant advancements facilitated by di-\nverse technologies\
    \ like simulation software, IoT, and AI utilized in the ﬁeld of modelling\nand\
    \ simulation [4,13,15,16].\nTo simulate and model the physical system to succeed\
    \ in implementing the DTs, the\nuse of mathematical models is mandatory [17].\
    \ Once the observed physical phenomena of\ninterest are captured, foundational\
    \ mathematical equations are formulated to depict and\ncharacterize the dynamics\
    \ of these phenomena accurately. By constructing these mathemat-\nical models,\
    \ researchers and scientists can effectively represent and analyze the behavior\n\
    and relationships inherent in the observed physical phenomena. The models that\
    \ are\ndeveloped need to be validated by experimental stages on the ﬁeld or in\
    \ laboratory setups\nto verify the physical behavior of the problem under consideration\
    \ soundly. Therefore,\nin advanced DTs, a predominant trend is the utilization\
    \ of extensive datasets to establish\ndata-driven models. This approach operates\
    \ under the assumption that the data obtained\nfrom the system serves as a powerful\
    \ source of insight, offering profound revelations about\nits physical behavior.\
    \ As a result, these well-reﬁned DTs leverage the abundance of data\nto construct\
    \ accurate and thorough models that faithfully capture the intricacies of the\n\
    system’s behavior [18]. The interaction of data between the physical entity and\
    \ its digital\nrepresentation in a DT is visually depicted in Figure 2.\nBy using\
    \ AI tools, such as ML algorithms or artiﬁcial neural networks, or while\nutilizing\

    \ solution for the complex task of pro-\ncessing vast amounts of data in various\
    \ sectors, particularly in conjunction with the advent\nof the Industrial IoT\
    \ (IIoT). The IIoT, a subset of the IoT speciﬁcally designed for industrial\n\
    applications, involves deploying numerous smart devices within industrial systems\
    \ to\nenable real-time data processing after collection and sensing. Given the\
    \ nature of industrial\nenvironments, IIoT systems demand enhanced levels of secure\
    \ and robust communication\nto ensure optimal production performance [22]. IIoT\
    \ applications that connect machines,\nsensors, and actuators like data collected\
    \ from agriculture stakeholders to be combined for\neffective decision-making\
    \ and analysis of future trends occasionally produce a large volume\nof non-uniform\
    \ data that needs to be processed in real-time. IoT gateways that provide\nconnectivity\
    \ between one or more ﬁeld devices and a service cloud offer accessibility to\n\
    previously hidden data from sensors, embedded controllers and IO devices and analyze\n\
    such data for multiple purposes, such as remote monitoring, preventive maintenance,\n\
    production optimization and building automation. IoT gateways are critical to\
    \ ensure data\nsecurity and communication security within the IIoT systems. A\
    \ data breach in such IIoT\nsystems could compromise agricultural production,\
    \ i.e., crop health degradation, transport\nand product processing, leading to\
    \ inferior production performance [23].\nThe exponential growth of IIoT and its\
    \ associated technologies has signiﬁcantly con-\ntributed to the advancement of\
    \ Industry 4.0 and intelligent manufacturing, forming the\nunderlying framework\
    \ for CDT. The substantial amount of data induced by IIoT devices\nplay a vital\
    \ role in facilitating the development of data-centric services as a crucial ele-\n\
    ment. While the concept of CDT continues to evolve rapidly, it is imperative to\
    \ address\noutstanding concerns surrounding the technology to unlock its full\
    \ potential and achieve\nits envisioned advantages.\nCDT systems integrate data\
    \ from different stakeholders as they combine several\nparameters, mainly concerning\
    \ immense amounts of data sharing, demanding measures\nto ensure security, privacy,\
    \ and protection of intellectual property (IP) concerning data.\nCDTs incorporate\
    \ cybersecurity infrastructure and employ data encryption mechanisms\nto address\
    \ these critical aspects effectively. These measures are implemented to regulate\n\
    transparency in CDTs, ensure the protection of intellectual property (IP), and\
    \ facilitate\nintegrated development processes [8,24].\nSimilarly, the notion\
    \ of DT systems emerges as a virtual representation of an enter-\nprise, encompassing\
    \ its resources, processes, workforce, locations, and systems to support\nstrategic\
    \ decision-making from the systems used for reporting operational data within\
    \ the\norganization, such as accounting, personnel planning, and sales [25]. This\
    \ type of DT which\nretrieves real-time data from the systems used for reporting\
    \ operational data within an\norganization, as mentioned earlier, is referred\
    \ to as a Strategic DT (SDT), in contrast to the\nindustrial DT that gathers information\
    \ from sensors, serving as a knowledge visualization\ntool that allows managers\
    \ to explore various strategies while minimizing space and time\nconstraints.\
    \ By simulating different strategic options through computer models, managers\n\
    can gain insights into the potential outcomes of their chosen approaches in the\
    \ real world.\nSensors 2023, 23, 7128\n7 of 38\n2.2. DTs in Agriculture\nAs stated\
    \ above, the implementation of DTs seems to extend to various ﬁelds vastly.\n\
    The objective of this review is to illuminate the ﬁeld of agriculture in the following\
    \ manner.\nA DT for agriculture, in particular, may be addressed as a virtual\
    \ model of a physical\nfarm or agricultural operation constructed utilizing cutting-edge\
    \ technologies like sensors,\nIoT devices, and cloud computing. Farmers can utilize\
    \ the DT to simulate and enhance\ntheir farming methods within a virtual setting,\
    \ enabling them to reﬁne their practices before\napplying them in reality [26,27].\
    \ Pylianidis et al. [27] conducted an in-depth report on DTs\nin agriculture,\
    \ encompassing 28 case studies and organizing the key value-added features\nof\
    \ DTs in agricultural applications. The authors highlight the capacity of DT usage\
    \ in\nagriculture, adjusting to ever-evolving circumstances, capturing, and interpreting\
    \ data,\nautonomously managing system actuators in the ﬁeld, and delivering customized\
    \ services\nto individuals, such as reports and transparent information. The DT\
    \ enables capturing\nreal-time data on crop growth rates, weather conditions,\
    \ ambient temperatures, and even\nsoil moisture levels as various environmental\
    \ and operational factors. A dynamic model of\nthe farm may be created by using\
    \ this data to test different scenarios and optimize various\naspects of the farming\
    \ operation, including crop yields, resource utilization, and overall efﬁ-\nciency.\
    \ By creating a DT, farmers can better understand how their farming practices\
    \ impact\nthe environment and identify ways to reduce waste and improve sustainability.\
    \ They can\nalso use the DT to test new technologies and techniques, such as precision\
    \ agriculture and\nautomation, before investing in them for their physical operation.\

    with fuel, fertilizers, labor, and factors affecting production efﬁciency and\
    \ sustainability\nmerely by utilizing DTs in crop production technologies along\
    \ with the use of Digital\nInformation and Communication Technology (ICT) tools,\
    \ referring to agricultural pieces of\nmachinery, such as tractors, combined harvesters,\
    \ fertilizers, and sprayers.\nAccording to Dyck G et al. [9], the DTs seem to\
    \ ﬁnd their way in post-harvest processes,\nencompassing the various stages involved\
    \ in handling agricultural products after harvest-\ning. These products must be\
    \ dried, cooled, transported, stored, and undergo marketing\nprocedures. Digital\

    lining transportation, and enhancing marketing efﬁciency. These strategies facilitate\
    \ the\nlive tracking of the agricultural and food supply network, leading to increased\
    \ robustness,\nresilience and reduced food waste and losses.\nIoT technology following\
    \ the digitalization prospect of agriculture plays a crucial role\nin transforming\
    \ traditional agriculture into a more efﬁcient and sustainable practice. IoT\n\
    contextual data enables users to interact seamlessly with their surroundings and\
    \ remote lo-\ncations through their digital twin, fostering enhanced connectivity\
    \ and user experiences [1].\nFacts such as precision agriculture that enables\
    \ farmers to gather real-time data on\na range of environmental and operational\
    \ factors, predictive modelling by using both\nhistorical and real-time data so\
    \ that they can generate a dynamic virtual representation of\ntheir agricultural\

    \ role in animal farming or precision livestock\nfarming by enhancing productivity,\
    \ animal welfare, and overall farm management. They\ncan be used to create virtual\
    \ representations of individual animals, groups of animals, or\nentire livestock\
    \ production systems [32], to model and predict animal behavior, growth,\nand\
    \ health, allowing farmers to optimize feeding strategies, detect early signs\
    \ of disease or\ndistress, and improve overall animal welfare.\nThrough data-driven\
    \ insights and predictive analytics, farmers can make informed\ndecisions regarding\
    \ nutrition, breeding, and healthcare interventions. By incorporating\nup-to-the-minute\
    \ information gathered from diverse sources, including sensors, monitoring\ndevices,\
    \ and agricultural management systems, DTs enable farmers to monitor, simulate,\n\
    and analyze animal behavior, health, and performance.\nNeethirajan S. [33] presents\
    \ a DT processing pipeline with sensors to classify and esti-\nmate livestock’s\
    \ emotional state and behavior. Various means of communication, including\nvocalizations,\
    \ body movements, facial expressions, and posture, contribute to animals\nexpressing\
    \ their emotional state. The review presents novel approaches for gathering\n\
    extensive real-time data regarding the emotions of farm livestock by implementing\
    \ a sensor\ndata processing pipeline within the DT model. This pipeline involves\
    \ preliminary data\nprocessing, modelling, and simulation phases, ultimately resulting\
    \ in reporting and pre-\ndicting the emotional states of cattle based on their\
    \ tail movements, facial expressions, and\nbody posture. Traditional methods involving\
    \ blood sampling or surveys, for assessing the\nemotional states of livestock\
    \ usually cause interruptions to farming processes while being\ntime-consuming,\
    \ and farm animals frequently experience fear, frustration, and distress. AI\n\
    technologies facilitate the recognition of cattle states, empowering animal caregivers\
    \ and\nethologists to understand animal behavior and optimize their well-being\
    \ and productivity.\nSensors 2023, 23, 7128\n9 of 38\nDTs may support decision-making\

    \ impacts. Furthermore, connections with other digital platforms, such as\nfarm\
    \ management systems, supply chain networks, and veterinary databases, allowing\
    \ for\nseamless data sharing and analysis is feasible with DT, thus enhancing\
    \ traceability, quality\nassurance, and decision-making throughout the value chain.\n\
    In summary, digital twins have the potential to revolutionize animal farming by\n\
    providing real-time monitoring, predictive analytics, and decision support. They\
    \ can\noptimize animal health, welfare, and production efﬁciency while promoting\
    \ sustainable\nfarming practices. Continued research and development in this area\
    \ will be crucial to fully\nharness the beneﬁts of DTs in animal farming and address\
    \ the associated challenges.\nAn Aquaculture 4.0 architecture of a digital twin-based\
    \ intelligent ﬁsh farm man-\nagement system for precision aquaculture is discussed\
    \ in [34], addressing the design\nconsiderations, data integration, analytics,\
    \ and control mechanisms to optimize ﬁsh farm\noperations. The proposed implementation\
    \ utilizes a cloud-based DT technology employing\nML realizations, computer vision,\
    \ and other sensor devices, and AI-based IoT (AIoT) to\nmonitor and control automated\
    \ aquaculture machinery. By optimizing farm production\nin various environments\
    \ throughout the different stages of ﬁsh farming, the system aims\nto maximize\
    \ efﬁciency and productivity. Water quality sensors utilized in ﬁshponds to\n\
    monitor and analyze the condition of the water and in offshore sea cages, and\
    \ RGB or sonar\ncamera devices may collect environmental data and data related\
    \ to ﬁsh populations to es-\ntablish data-driven prediction models. On the other\
    \ hand, land-based monitoring systems\nsend appropriate commands to activate surveillance\
    \ sensors, thus enabling ﬁsh-feeding\nbehavior monitoring, disease spread, and\

    twins in agriculture, showcasing their role in data collection, preprocessing,\
    \ modelling,\nsimulation, analytics, decision support, visualization, and control,\
    \ ultimately aiding in\noptimizing farm operations and improving decision-making\
    \ processes.\nFurthermore, the interconnections among these entities play a vital\
    \ role as they are\nessential for the functioning of the DT system in an integrated\
    \ manner, as emphasized by\nPedersen et al. in their research [17].\n3.1. Technologies\
    \ Involved in DTs\nTherefore, realizing DTs in real-time is characterized by several\
    \ deﬁning keys that have\nemerged along with key technologies [1] from various\
    \ domains, industries, and scientiﬁc\ndisciplines that pose a decisive entity,\
    \ such as the following.\n3.1.1. Augmented, Virtual, and Mixed-Reality\nDTs rely\
    \ on Augmented (AR), Virtual (VR), and Mixed-Reality (MR) technologies. As\nan\
    \ example, they can be created using three-dimensional (3D) technologies and presented\n\
    as holograms or experienced through AR/VR/MR devices [35], such as the Microsoft\n\
    HoloLens. Using sensors installed in the ﬁeld, their real-time digital twin can\
    \ be generated\nand projected as a hologram in remote locations. This enables\
    \ individuals in different\nlocations to engage in interactions that simulate\
    \ being physically present in the same space.\nCommunication enhancement in digital\
    \ twins is derived by integrating tactile feedback,\nsimulating the sensation\
    \ of physical interaction via haptics. Furthermore, DTs can leverage\nhumanoid\
    \ and soft robotics technologies to enable physical actions on behalf of their\
    \ real-\nlife counterparts. This means digital twins can physically engage with\
    \ the environment\nor perform tasks, utilizing robotic systems that mimic human-like\
    \ or ﬂexible movements.\nThese advancements in augmented, virtual, mixed reality,\
    \ haptics, and robotics greatly en-\nhance the capabilities of digital twins,\
    \ enabling immersive interactions, realistic sensations,\nand physical engagement,\
    \ expanding the possibilities for communication and collaboration.\nSensors 2023,\
    \ 23, 7128\n11 of 38\n3.1.2. Artiﬁcial Intelligence\nArtiﬁcial Intelligence (AI)\
    \ integration into physical assets that lack it inherently is a\nkey advantage\
    \ of DTs. This introduces a specialized intelligence capable of efﬁciently com-\n\
    prehending vast amounts of numerical data and deriving domain-speciﬁc insights\
    \ faster\nthan human experts. Consequently, the data obtained from the digital\
    \ twin’s surroundings\nand physical counterpart should lead to valuable and actionable\
    \ conclusions [36]. As an\nemerging technology, AI empowers computers to exhibit\
    \ intelligent behaviors, including\nbehavioral learning. By amalgamating various\
    \ technologies, including AI, to create twin\nmodels of physical objects, it becomes\
    \ feasible to generate virtual representations that\nclosely resemble the original\
    \ objects, encompassing historical elements and predictive\ninformation [37].\
    \ As a result, DTs often incorporate controllers that utilize ontologies, ML,\n\
    and deep learning (DL) techniques. These controllers enable swift and intelligent\
    \ decision-\nmaking on behalf of their real-life counterparts. Moreover, AI signiﬁcantly\
    \ processes IoT\ndata through continuously enhanced algorithms that leverage updated\
    \ user data. Leverag-\ning such time-series data, a user’s DT has the potential\
    \ to suggest actions for controlling or\nmitigating potentially hazardous situations\
    \ regarding crop health and productivity, in cases\nsuch as droughts to direct\
    \ asses irrigation efﬁciency or even failures of safety mechanisms\nof farm machinery,\
    \ plant production equipment, post-harvest transportation or storage\nequipment\
    \ situations in which DTs may visualize alarm signals to stakeholders or even\
    \ take\nimmediate actions to limit adverse effects or even the destruction of\
    \ crop production [29].\n3.1.3. Communication Technologies and Schemes\nDTs rely\
    \ on communication technologies and schemes to facilitate interaction with the\n\
    environment, their physical twins, and other DTs on a real-time basis. This is\
    \ particularly\nsigniﬁcant in the realm of wireless communication. Effective communication\
    \ must occa-\nsionally occur within a millisecond (ms) timeframe, necessitating\
    \ compliance with 5G and\ntactile internet standards, while time-sensitive and\
    \ safety-critical schemes, coupled with\nthe need for stringent communication\
    \ standards, lead to a growing demand for repeatable\nand cost-effective veriﬁcation\
    \ procedures. Data transmission within a speciﬁc time window\nbecomes crucial\
    \ for time-sensitive and often safety-critical applications, imposing latency\n\
    limitations in addition to reliability requirements [38]. The following paragraphs\
    \ outline\nbasic wireless communications technologies commonly used in DT implementations.\n\
    (a)\nRFID technology offers fast and accurate object identiﬁcation using sensor\
    \ tags, reader\nantennas, and a host system. An antenna, an integrated circuit,\
    \ and a substrate utilize\na tag, where the antenna activates the tag for reading\
    \ or writing. The reader antennas\ncommunicate with the tags using RF waves, facilitating\
    \ data transfer to the database\nsystem. This technology ﬁnds extensive applications\
    \ in storage and inventory man-\nagement, supply chain monitoring, access control,\
    \ aviation transportation, agriculture,\nhealthcare, and more, improving efﬁciency\
    \ and automation in various ﬁelds [39].\n(b)\nWireless Networks, in particular,\
    \ suggest an immense role in sending data from\na source to a connected gateway,\
    \ a role supported by a variety of wireless net-\nwork technologies such as WPAN,\
    \ WLAN, WWAN, and LPWAN that are addressed\nin [18,39–47]. The existing commercial\
    \ 4G or 5G LTE communication networks, utiliz-\ning the transmission of data packets\
    \ through the well-established Internet Protocol\n(IP), serves as a base to sustain\
    \ the architecture of wireless communication networks\nin general.\ni\nWireless\
    \ Personal Area Networks (WPAN) are wireless networks that operate\nwith less\
    \ extensive infrastructure. They are designed to function within a\nlimited range,\
    \ typically within a single room or a small area. Unlike traditional\nnetworks\
    \ that rely on cables, WPANs enable the wireless connectivity of de-\nvices nearby,\
    \ facilitating the connection of devices like wireless keyboards or\nmice to computers\
    \ and supporting printing services. The most common WPAN\ntechnologies include\
    \ Bluetooth, 6LowWPAN, ZigBee, EnOcean, NFC, and\nRFID, each employing different\
    \ techniques to achieve the goals of WPAN [40].\nSensors 2023, 23, 7128\n12 of\
    \ 38\nBluetooth enables devices to communicate with each other wirelessly within\
    \ a\nlimited proximity. It is a short-range, low-power technology that is used\
    \ in a\nwide variety of devices [41].\nii\nWireless Local Area Networks (WLAN)\
    \ are wireless networks that allow de-\nvices to connect and communicate over\
    \ a local area without the need for\nphysical cables within a speciﬁc coverage\
    \ area, such as a home, ofﬁce, or public\nspace. These networks utilize the widely\
    \ recognized IEEE 802.11 standard,\ncommonly known as Wi-Fi, to enable devices\
    \ like smartphones, laptops, and\ntablets to enable wireless interconnection between\
    \ them and connection to\nthe internet. The Wi-Fi—802.11 wireless network, introduced\
    \ in 1997, using\nthe 2.4 GHz frequency band and supporting up to 2 Mbps data\
    \ transmission\nrates, evolved to the 802.11ac standard, operating in both 2.4\
    \ GHz and 5 GHz\nbands, achieving a maximum throughput of 1 Gbps for multiple\
    \ users, with\na minimum of 500 Mbps. WLANs offer greater coverage than WPANs,\
    \ span-\nning multiple rooms or entire buildings, making them suitable for larger-scale\n\
    wireless networking requirements. They provide convenient and ﬂexible con-\nnectivity\
    \ for various devices and applications, including internet access, ﬁle\nsharing,\
    \ video streaming, and more.\niii\nWireless Wide Area Networks (WWAN) provide\
    \ wireless connectivity on\na larger scale, spanning cities, regions, or even\
    \ entire countries. WWAN\ntechnologies, such as 4G Long-Term Evolution (LTE),\
    \ 5G, and the evolving\n6G, enable high-speed mobile internet access and support\
    \ a wide range of\nservices, including voice communication, video streaming, and\
    \ data transfer.\nThese networks rely on cellular infrastructure and are commonly\
    \ used for\nmobile devices like smartphones, tablets, and laptops to stay connected\
    \ while\non the go.\niv\nLow Power Wide Area Networks (LPWAN) are wireless network\
    \ technologies\nideal for IoT devices with long battery life, extensive coverage,\
    \ and low cost.\nUnlike 3G/4G or Wi-Fi systems, LPWAN networks are not primarily\
    \ designed\nfor high data transmission speeds or reducing latency. Instead, LPWANs\
    \ target\nenergy efﬁciency, scalability, and coverage [42], thus gaining popularity\
    \ in\nindustrial and research communities. They provide long-range communication,\n\
    covering distances from 10 to 40 km in rural areas and 1 to 5 km in dense\nurban\
    \ areas. Their main advantages include energy efﬁciency, a battery life\nexceeding\
    \ ten years, and low cost, which is ideal for IoT applications that\nrequire small-scale\
    \ data transmission [48]. Various LPWAN technologies have\nbeen developed and\
    \ deployed in either licensed or unlicensed frequency bands,\nsuch as Long-Range\
    \ (LoRa), Narrow-Band IoT (NB-IoT), each employing\ndifferent techniques to achieve\
    \ the goals of LPWAN [49].\n•\nLoRa is an ideal wireless communication technology\
    \ for low-bandwidth\nIoT applications, offering long-range and low-power consumption\
    \ ser-\nvices. It uses a proprietary spread spectrum technique to achieve long-\n\
    range and low power consumption, operating in the unlicensed sub-GHz\nISM band\
    \ available worldwide [50].\n•\nNB-IoT is a widely used LPWAN technology connecting\
    \ various devices\nand services through cellular networks. It operates in a narrow\
    \ band-\nwidth of 180 kHz, providing extensive network coverage and low latency.\n\
    Designed for cost-effective and delay-tolerant IoT devices, NB-IoT utilizes\n\
    LTE techniques and can integrate with existing LTE infrastructure. Coex-\nisting\
    \ with LTE networks, NB-IoT offers power-efﬁcient connectivity and\nleverages\
    \ compatible technologies for seamless integration [51].\nThe main technical features\
    \ of the wireless network technologies mentioned above are\ndisplayed in Table\

    \ needs, is open, and is used in arti-\ncles [25,39–42,44]. In cases where the\
    \ application requires a higher data rate, Bluetooth\ntechnology can be used,\
    \ as mentioned in the article [44], but it has signiﬁcantly higher\npower consumption\
    \ compared to LoRa, and the coverage is 100 m for Bluetooth 4.x and\n200 m for\
    \ Bluetooth 5.x. For applications aimed at object identiﬁcation and detection,\
    \ such\nas products in warehouses and animals in agricultural operations, RFID\
    \ technology is a\nsuitable choice as mentioned in articles [43,45]. For applications\
    \ that require a high data rate\nand need to utilize a Wi-Fi network, the provision\
    \ of electrical power is necessary. Finally,\nonce DTs rely on data exchange,\
    \ real-time monitoring, and interaction with their physical\ncounterparts, wireless\
    \ networks provide a ﬂexible and efﬁcient means of communication\nfor these purposes\
    \ [8].\n3.1.4. Reliability, Integrity, and Credibility\nReliability, integrity,\
    \ and credibility are pivotal when DTs are entrusted with sensitive\ntasks involving\
    \ transaction management with their real counterparts. It becomes imper-\native\
    \ for the real twin to establish a sense of trust in their digital twin’s capabilities\
    \ and\nactions. Building and maintaining a solid connection between the real twin\
    \ and the DT is\ncrucial to foster effective collaboration, enabling reliable\
    \ decision-making, and ensuring\nsecure interactions. Consequently, a strong foundation\
    \ of trust becomes indispensable\nfor the successful operation and advancement\
    \ of DT-enabled systems [52]. Therefore,\nprivacy and security arise as paramount\
    \ considerations in the realm of DTs. To enable the\nconﬁdentiality and privacy\
    \ of their real twins, DTs should implement robust measures for\nidentity protection.\
    \ This can be achieved using dedicated cryptography algorithms and\nadvanced biometric\
    \ techniques such as ECG and haptic biometrics. By leveraging these\ntechniques,\
    \ the identity and privacy of the real twin can be established and safeguarded.\n\
    In addition to identity protection, DTs must prioritize data integrity, security,\
    \ and privacy.\nMeasures should be in place to prevent unauthorized access and\
    \ interception of data across\nthe network. Unauthorized users should be promptly\
    \ detected and repelled to prevent any\ncompromise of data integrity or security.\
    \ To ensure the authenticity and reliability of data\nsources, rigorous measures\
    \ for data authentication should be implemented before integrat-\ning the data\
    \ into the digital twin. Overall, DTs must incorporate comprehensive privacy\n\
    and security mechanisms to safeguard their real twins’ data’s identity, conﬁdentiality,\
    \ and\nintegrity. By adopting robust cryptographic algorithms, employing biometric\
    \ techniques,\nand implementing strict data authentication protocols, DTs can\
    \ effectively address privacy\nand security concerns, fostering a trustworthy\
    \ and secure environment for the real twins\nand their digital counterparts.\n\
    3.1.5. Distributed Ledger Technologies and Blockchain\nIn recent times, Distributed\
    \ Ledger Technologies (DLT), such as blockchain [44,53],\nhave emerged to add\
    \ to user authentication and data integrity regarding data sharing. To\nunlock\
    \ its full potential and achieve its envisioned advantages, addressing outstanding\n\
    concerns surrounding the technology is imperative. DLT offers a decentralized\
    \ approach\nthat eliminates the need for a central authority or database, distinguishing\
    \ it from traditional\ndata-sharing methods. The distributed nature of this system\
    \ allows for the secure sharing\nof data in a trustless environment. The signiﬁcance\
    \ of DLT has garnered considerable\ninterest from researchers and practitioners\
    \ alike. Various systems and platforms based\non Distributed Ledger Technology\
    \ (DLT), such as private ledgers, public ledgers, and\npermissioned ledgers, have\
    \ been created to address diverse use cases and speciﬁc needs [54].\nProposed\
    \ technological solutions stemming from IoT, AI, DT, and DLT have been put\nforward\
    \ to address the monitoring and tracking of products within the realm of food\n\
    supply logistics and chain and the analysis of collected data to facilitate decision-making\n\
    Sensors 2023, 23, 7128\n15 of 38\nprocesses [55]. Given the numerous advantages\
    \ associated with DLT, it presents itself as a\npromising technology that can\
    \ signiﬁcantly contribute to achieving the vision of CDT.\nBlockchain technologies,\
    \ in particular, seem to be an ideal structure for authenticating\nusers, storing\
    \ data records, and maintaining data integrity [8,56], providing a secure and\n\
    decentralized system of interconnected blocks formed through cryptographic functions.\n\
    It allows transactions to be recorded in a veriﬁable manner without intermediaries.\
    \ Each\npreceding block’s hash is included in the next block and is generated\
    \ through a distributed\nconsensus algorithm. With encryption mechanisms, blockchain\
    \ ensures data integrity\nand prevents tampering [43]. Ethereum, as a blockchain\
    \ scheme, provides an alternative\nprotocol for decentralized applications that,\
    \ unlike another blockchain scheme Bitcoin, is\nnot just a payment network but\
    \ also allows for the creation and use of smart contracts.\nIt uses its digital\
    \ currency called “ether” and incorporates a complete programming lan-\nguage\
    \ (such as Solidity) for smart contract development. Pieces of code stored on\
    \ the\nblockchain that enables decentralized transactions without a trusted central\
    \ authority are\ncalled Smart contracts [57].\nOn the other hand, the Helium Blockchain\
    \ is referred to as the major public decen-\ntralized LoRaWAN network in the world,\
    \ that enables devices anywhere in the world\nto wirelessly connect to the internet\
    \ and have a speciﬁc geographical placement without\nthe need for energy-consuming\
    \ satellite equipment or expensive mobile data plans [58].\nHelium offers low\
    \ transaction fees and connectivity for LoRa nodes and ensures end-to-end\nencryption,\
    \ which is useful whenever sensitive information is at stake.\nThe use of blockchain,\
    \ such as Ethereum and Helium, in IoT and digital twins for\nsmart agriculture\
    \ applications has the following advantages:\n•\nTransparency and trust: Blockchain\
    \ provides an open, transparent, and tamper-proof\ndistributed ledger, allowing\
    \ all stakeholders to verify the accuracy of the data. This can\nhelp build trust\

    \ or unauthorized interventions.\n•\nBlockchain enhances Data security [59] as\
    \ it utilizes cryptography to protect data. This\nis crucial for safeguarding\
    \ sensitive information related to smart agriculture, such as\ndata on plant health,\
    \ soil quality, and food production.\n•\nAutomation and smart contracts on the\
    \ blockchain enable programmable automatic\nexecution of conditions and actions\
    \ based on speciﬁc information, events, and opera-\ntions such as automated irrigation,\
    \ temperature control, and plant health monitoring\nin smart agriculture.\n•\n\
    The distributed architecture of blockchain ensures that information is stored\
    \ and\nveriﬁed by multiple nodes in the network, thus ensuring integrity and continuity\
    \ of\ndata and reducing dependency on a central authority.\n3.1.6. Cloud Computing\n\
    Cloud computing presents a valuable opportunity for DTs to enhance their scalability\n\
    and availability, assisting their real twins anytime and anywhere. By leveraging\
    \ cloud\ncomputing infrastructures, computation and control tasks can be ofﬂoaded\
    \ from the local\nenvironment to remote servers, enabling DTs to handle complex\
    \ processes and ensure\nseamless availability efﬁciently. The scalability of DTs\
    \ is signiﬁcantly improved through\ncloud computing, as the computational resources\
    \ can be dynamically allocated and scaled\nbased on demand. This allows DTs to\
    \ handle larger datasets, called Big Data sets (BD), per-\nform sophisticated\
    \ analytics, and execute resource-intensive tasks without local hardware\nlimitations.\
    \ As the DT model involves the creation and management of virtual replicas that\n\
    closely mimic real-world objects or systems, it requires extensive data acquisition,\
    \ storage,\nand processing capabilities for collecting and analyzing a massive\
    \ volume of data from\nvarious sources, including sensors, IoT devices, and other\
    \ data-generating components [7],\nfacts that necessitate cloud computing. The\
    \ elastic nature of cloud computing ensures\nthat DTs can adapt to varying workloads\
    \ and seamlessly accommodate ﬂuctuations in\ncomputational requirements.\nSensors\
    \ 2023, 23, 7128\n16 of 38\nFurthermore, cloud-based DTs offer the advantage of\
    \ ubiquitous accessibility by using\nopen-source communication platforms, such\
    \ as OPC Uniﬁed Architecture (UA) commu-\nnication protocol and frameworks, for\
    \ data exchange from sensors to cloud applications\nused in DTs. Real twins can\
    \ access and interact with their DTs from any location and at any\ntime, provided\
    \ an active internet connection is in place. This fosters a ﬂexible and versatile\n\
    environment where real twins can leverage the capabilities of their DTs regardless\
    \ of their\nphysical location.\n3.1.7. Internet of Things\nInternet of Things\
    \ (IoT) with 5G and the Tactile Internet (TI) entity meanings have\nemerged as\
    \ groundbreaking technologies, ushering in a new era of communication with\ntheir\
    \ focus on ultra-high reliability and ultra-low latency. This shift in communication\n\
    paradigms from content-oriented to control-oriented is especially signiﬁcant for\
    \ applica-\ntions that involve human-in-the-loop interactions, demanding minimal\
    \ delays and seamless\nintegration of communication and control mechanisms as\
    \ demanded in DT infrastructure.\nWithin this context, DTs play a pivotal role\
    \ by establishing a continuously operational twin\nfeedback loop, ultimately enhancing\
    \ the service quality of physical systems [60,61]. This\nseamless real-time feedback\
    \ communication loop empowers DTs to constantly monitor,\nanalyze, and adapt to\
    \ the evolving conditions of the physical systems they represent. As a\nresult,\
    \ precise control actions and optimizations can be executed, ultimately enhancing\
    \ the\nphysical systems’ overall service quality and performance.\nThrough the\
    \ IoT, users can seamlessly provide contextual data to their DT while\nreceiving\
    \ feedback that can be used to enhance their interaction with the environment,\n\
    both locally and remotely. Various communication technologies within IoT are required\
    \ to\ntransmit data and status information from sensors in the physical entity\
    \ to the data entity,\nenabling seamless connectivity and communication between\
    \ connected devices [17], as\nshown in Figure 7.\nSensors 2023, 23, 7128 \n17\

    \ and Simulation Software\nA DT could be addressed as a tight combination of (i)\
    \ an object model, in conjunction\nwith (ii) an expansive set of data that is\
    \ directly following the object that may evolve,\nand ﬁnally, (iii) a method for\
    \ modifying and reﬁning the model based on the available\ndata [17,62]. The experts\
    \ decide the need and selection of the training, validation and\nveriﬁcation data\
    \ concerning speciﬁc case studies, types of soil, plant types, leaf area, plant\n\
    height, regarding the Physical Twin, or technological use cases. Critical data\
    \ processing\ndepends on speciﬁc plant characteristics, experimental setups, dedicated\
    \ sensors, ML and\nDL applicable methods and big data analytics software.\nOne\
    \ of the signiﬁcant beneﬁts of utilizing the DT approach is its ability to accurately\n\
    depict objects or entities that change over time, owing to the incorporation of\
    \ dynamic\nand evolving data. Employing a digital twin makes it possible to extend\
    \ the application\nof a validated model across timescales during which the object\
    \ and its behavior undergo\nsigniﬁcant variations. A validated model may offer\
    \ an instant representation of an object’s\nbehavior at a speciﬁc moment, thus\
    \ highlighting the importance of associating the DT with\na corresponding physical\
    \ counterpart and the signiﬁcance of choosing a model according\nto the speciﬁc\
    \ implementation.\nWithout a physical twin, the DT would be considered nothing\
    \ more than a model.\nFurthermore, the availability of a comprehensive and up-to-date\
    \ dataset plays a crucial\nrole in accurately capturing the object’s changes over\
    \ time and ensuring the model is\nadjusted and updated to reﬂect the current system\
    \ conditions. Any model approximating\nthe physical twinned can be used for DTs\
    \ that utilize physics-based models encompassing\nall relevant processes that\
    \ can inﬂuence the measured quantities. In an ideal scenario with\ninstantaneous\
    \ computing and ﬂawless accuracy, these models would accurately simulate\nand\
    \ update the mechanical and thermal processes involved in real-time operations.\
    \ For\ninstance, a DT of a machine tool could simulate the milling of metal, considering\
    \ factors\nlike temperature and part shape, and dynamically update information\
    \ about tool wear\nbased on real-time measurements. This enables proactive and\
    \ effective industrial plant\nfacilities maintenance, enhancing overall efﬁciency\
    \ [62,63]. Similarly, to an industrial plant\nin agriculture, a digital model\
    \ could represent the growth of a plant regarding its physical\nenvironmental\
    \ conditions that are changing over time.\nAccording to researchers, a categorization\
    \ standard centered around the degree of\ndata fusion and integration between\
    \ the PO and its virtual representation can be used as\nan indicator to deﬁne\
    \ and delimit the scope of the proposed concept. Given that this term\nwas initially\
    \ created for the manufacturing industry, it serves as a proxy for evaluating\n\
    agricultural DTs’ development, convergences, and divergences compared to contemporary\n\
    deﬁnitions. Thus, three integration levels represent the digital twin’s ﬁeld.\
    \ First is the\nDigital Model (DM), second is the Digital Shadow (DS), and third\
    \ is the DT. The DM is a\ndepiction of the entity in a digital format without\
    \ the use of an automated data transfer\nsystem. It is equivalent to a Digital\
    \ Twin prototype and represents the lowest possible\nintegration level. The DS\
    \ refers to a digital representation that enables the automatic\nexchange of information\
    \ from the physical entity to its virtual object, reﬂecting changes\nin the entity’s\
    \ state. This one-way information ﬂow is like a DT model, which in contrast,\n\
    involves an automated bi-directional ﬂow of digital information. Like the DS,\
    \ the DT has a\nvirtual representation whose alterations are reﬂected in the physical\
    \ entity’s state. However,\nwhat sets the DT apart is its capacity to impact the\
    \ condition of the physical entity as well,\nalthough the speciﬁc means of inﬂuence\
    \ depend on the type of entity and its context [63].\nIn summary, a DM represents\
    \ a physical system in a digital format but lacks auto-\nmated data exchange.\
    \ A DS involves a one-way automated data ﬂow reaching the digital\ncounterpart\
    \ originating from the physical system. Conversely, a DT involves seamless and\n\
    fully integrated automated communication between the digital counterpart of the\
    \ physical\nsystem and the physical system itself.\nDeﬁning the objectives of\
    \ the modelling process is the initial stage in creating a model\nfor an integrated\
    \ process. Recognizing that a model is merely a reality approximation is\nSensors\
    \ 2023, 23, 7128\n18 of 38\nessential, as diverse objectives can provide different\
    \ levels of complexity in representing\nthe actual procedure. For this reason,\
    \ it is crucial to identify the goal of the model before the\nbuild [64]. Therefore,\
    \ complex systems like an agriculture model should be ﬁrst designed\nand objectively\
    \ deﬁned so their DT model is accurate. Spreadsheet software such as\nMicrosoft\
    \ Excel is commonly employed for process calculations and analyses. This is\n\
    due to its widespread availability and familiarity among scientists, engineers,\
    \ and other\nprofessionals. In contrast, the concept of DTs is somehow new and\
    \ still emerging. The\nspreadsheet’s cells allow users to enter data, make computations,\
    \ and produce results\nwhile they can plot data from them in several graphs. Software\
    \ programs like process\nsimulators allow users to describe and analyze integrated\
    \ processes. The purpose of\nthese tools is to simulate continuous processes and\
    \ their transient behavior. The scientiﬁc\nliterature concerning process simulation\
    \ tools is continuously growing, encompassing\nvarious areas such as techno-economic\
    \ analyses, economic feasibility studies, structural\nprocess enhancements, and\
    \ the exploration of alternative processes to existing ones [64].\nGiven that\
    \ a DT model is much more than a simulation tool, by nature, never being an\n\
    exact representation of reality. Still, really an approximation of it, and different\
    \ objectives\nmay produce various modelling abstractions with varying levels of\
    \ detail concerning the\nactual process. It is crucial to identify the goal of\
    \ the model before we develop it.\nSince cloud computing has many beneﬁts, it\
    \ is the most practical method for introduc-\ning DT services. Due to its ability\
    \ to provide on-demand services, computational resources,\nand ubiquitous network\
    \ access, the implementation of the next-generation information\ntechnology architecture\
    \ is highly compatible with DT environments. In such environments,\ndata owners\
    \ generate data from assets, transmit it to cloud servers, simulate the DT in\
    \ a\nvirtual environment, and subsequently share the insights and ﬁndings of the\
    \ simulation\nwith the data owner. Users can request access to the data at any\
    \ time [59]. In construct-\ning complex DT production systems, like industrial\
    \ or agricultural systems, “machine\nlearning” and “simulation tools” are two\
    \ complementary technologies. Creating stochastic\nsimulations for complicated\
    \ systems takes time and effort. However, these simulations\nare essential for\
    \ DT construction because they have two crucial capabilities. The ﬁrst is\n“uncertainty\
    \ modelling” and the second is “explainable analytics”. Focusing on how ML\nand\
    \ reinforcement learning (RL) improve simulation, many issues arise in digital\
    \ twin use\ncases. The rapid advancement of IoT, edge computing, and cloud computing\
    \ technologies\nhas signiﬁcantly accelerated the progress of digital twins. It\
    \ is widely believed that digital\ntwins will soon become a vital catalyst for\
    \ digital transformation, as evidenced by the com-\nmon theme present in various\
    \ research studies [65]. The primary hurdle lies in establishing\na secure, reliable\
    \ method to share simulation and real-time data. Additionally, there is a\nneed\
    \ for a robust and privacy-centric authentication system that leverages the beneﬁts\
    \ of\nblockchain technology to address the security prerequisites mentioned earlier.\n\
    3.2. Notable Components of DT Implementations\nIn the realm of digital twins,\
    \ components denote the distinct constituents or elements\nthat constitute a digital\
    \ twin system. A representative ensemble follows.\n3.2.1. Sensors and Actuators\n\
    DTs embody sensors and actuators as parts of great signiﬁcance that offer valuable\n\
    data and information about physical phenomena and enable the replication of sensory\n\
    capabilities. In today’s interconnected world, an enormous number of sensors and\
    \ actuators\nare deployed across various domains, ranging from consumer products\
    \ to industrial set-\ntings such as smart factories and smartwatches. These sensors\
    \ capture critical information\nrelated to temperature, humidity, velocity, pressure,\
    \ chemical components, and material\ncomposition, forming the foundation for digital\
    \ twin technology [47,66]. By equipping real\ntwins (physical entities) with sensors,\
    \ DTs can replicate and harness the senses of sight,\ntemperature, sound, humidity,\
    \ and touch through appropriate actuators. For example,\nin the agricultural domain,\
    \ a DT of a plant could leverage sensors to create predictive\nSensors 2023, 23,\
    \ 7128\n19 of 38\nmaintenance services or simulate and optimize the production\
    \ process. This allows for the\ngeneration of actionable insights and the enhancement\
    \ of operational efﬁciency. DTs rely on\nthe integration of actuator and sensor\
    \ technologies to gather continuous and accurate data.\nThe representation of\
    \ a physical asset in digital forms, like a sensor-equipped machine,\nrelies on\
    \ the synchronized operation of virtual sensors and actuators. These software-based\n\
    counterparts replicate the functionalities of physical sensors and actuators,\
    \ aggregating\ndata from multiple sources. Integrating sensors and actuators within\
    \ the digital twin\nframework enables real-time monitoring, data-driven analytics,\
    \ and the ability to simulate\nvarious scenarios for optimization purposes. By\
    \ bridging the physical and digital realms,\ndigital twins empower industries\
    \ and sectors to achieve enhanced performance, increased\nefﬁciency, and cost\
    \ savings.\n3.2.2. Identiﬁcation of Entities\nIn the context of DTs, each twin\
    \ is assigned a distinct identiﬁer that facilitates seamless\ncommunication with\
    \ its physical counterpart. This unique identiﬁer encapsulates vital\ninformation\
    \ about the physical object’s structure, capabilities, and technical speciﬁcations,\n\
    as well as its expected performance under speciﬁc conditions. When creating a\
    \ DT, it is\ncrucial to consider the unique circumstances of the object to ensure\
    \ an accurate represen-\ntation [67]. Even if two physical items are identical,\
    \ they may exhibit different behaviors\nwhen subjected to varying conditions.\
    \ Hence, each digital twin is assigned its unique iden-\ntiﬁer, reﬂecting the\
    \ individual characteristics and attributes of the corresponding physical\nobject.\
    \ By leveraging the DT’s unique identiﬁer, we can accurately simulate and analyze\
    \ its\nproperties and behaviours.\nFurthermore, the expansive network of interconnected\
    \ devices, sensors, and actuators\nhighlights the need for real-time collection\
    \ and sharing of identiﬁed contextual data with\ndigital twins. This data encompasses\
    \ various parameters such as location, environmen-\ntal conditions, user preferences,\
    \ and behavioral patterns. By integrating this uniquely\nidentiﬁed contextual\
    \ data into the DT model, a deep understanding of the user’s context\nand needs\
    \ can be achieved. Adding to that notion, a Geographic Information System\n(GIS)\
    \ as a versatile system generates, controls, examines, and maps various data types\
    \ and\nlinks IoT data to a map. Thus, GIS combines location information, referred\
    \ to as spatial\ndata, with descriptive details of a DT, forming the basis for\
    \ mapping and analysis utilized\nacross multiple industries and scientiﬁc ﬁelds.\
    \ With GIS, users gain insights into patterns,\nrelationships, and the geographical\
    \ context of their data, as in [68].\n3.2.3. Visualization and Representation\n\
    Visualization and representation play a vital role in DTs, offering various forms\n\
    of virtual representation depending on the speciﬁc application. DTs can leverage\
    \ 3D\nvisualizations to facilitate collaborative design or planning [69]. Depending\
    \ on the context,\nthese connections can manifest in various forms, such as a\
    \ 3D representation, hologram,\nhumanoid social robot, or purely as software components\
    \ without physical attendance.\nConsequently, DT commonly refers to the digital\
    \ depiction of a real-world object, system, or\nentity’s physical twin that faithfully\
    \ replicates a unique item, process, person, organization,\nor even a legendary\
    \ narrative. Composite digital twins are formed when multiple digital\ntwins merge.\
    \ These DTs, as reﬂections of the actual world, share similar characteristics,\n\
    necessitating the modelling of digital processes and objects with composition,\
    \ ﬂexibility,\nsensing, collaboration, and simulation capabilities. Furthermore,\
    \ predictions suggest that\nfuture DTs will evolve toward a holistic virtual world\
    \ [70].\n3.2.4. Devices\nDevices that continuously capture data concerning physiological\
    \ and environmental\nfactors information can serve DTs to gain a comprehensive\
    \ understanding of the real\ntwin’s well-being and lifestyle. Such wearable devices,\
    \ for example, smartwatches, ﬁtness\ntrackers, and other health monitoring devices\
    \ have enabled individuals to collect and\nSensors 2023, 23, 7128\n20 of 38\n\
    track various physiological parameters effortlessly. The abundance of such data\
    \ presents\na unique opportunity for digital twins to enhance their support for\
    \ their real twins more\nefﬁciently [71]. By integrating the data from wearables\
    \ into the DT model, real-time\ninsights and personalized recommendations can\
    \ be generated as feedback or alerts based on\nspeciﬁc needs and goals. Furthermore,\
    \ the continuous monitoring and analysis of wearable\ndata by DTs enable proactive\
    \ interventions whilst identifying patterns or deviations from\nnormal physiological\
    \ parameters and providing early warnings or interventions to address\npotential\
    \ health risks or optimize performance. This proactive support can contribute\
    \ to\npreventive healthcare, early detection of health issues, and overall well-being\
    \ management.\nIn summary, the DT is an advanced data management system that integrates\
    \ 3D ani-\nmation, modelling, IoT, AI, and other technologies such as ML. It enables\
    \ the seamless con-\nnection and management of physical and virtual models within\
    \ a digital environment [72].\nAs human civilization grows, agriculture remains\
    \ crucial for our progress and well-being.\nIntelligent DT systems can analyze\
    \ and digitize agricultural areas, enabling macro and\nmicro-level visual processes.\
    \ These systems can provide intelligent recommendations and\nsuggestions that\
    \ can be implemented to achieve multiple beneﬁts in agriculture.\n4. Reviewing\

    \ address the signiﬁcance of a DT case study in\nagriculture. The concept of DTs\
    \ is mainly addressed in all reviewed papers. In 16 papers\nthough [19,26–28,64,73,82],\
    \ the DT concept is analyzed and utilized in more detail, thus\nposing the signiﬁcance\
    \ of using DTs in smart farming and agriculture.\nAccording to the reviewed literature\
    \ summarized in Table 2, smart farming as an\nimplementation of agriculture 4.0\
    \ [19,26–29,45,63,73,75–77,79–88] includes smart irrigation\nstrategies by monitoring\
    \ and controlling various farming stages [28], implementing data\nacquisition\
    \ techniques [27] for automatically controlling actuator systems in agriculture\
    \ or\neven in high-tech data-driven greenhouses [79]. Furthermore, via simulation,\
    \ monitoring,\ncontrolling, coordinating, and executing farm operations at agricultural\
    \ sites [87], DTs\nimprove predictive control in precision irrigation [28,73,88],\
    \ greenhouse horticulture, and\norganic vegetable and livestock farming. Smart\
    \ farming enhances remote detection and\nmonitoring of vegetation and crop stress\
    \ in agriculture [86], developing DT stages and\nforecasting plant yield in greenhouses,\
    \ vertical farms, or outdoor ﬁelds [76,77], or even in\nurban and indoor farming,\
    \ of vertical agriculture utilizing hydroponics, aeroponics, aqua-\nculture, and\
    \ aquaponics. Smart farming approaches the smart agriculture [85] as well as the\n\
    sustainable agriculture 4.0 [80] sector to address precision farming and management\
    \ [75,76]\nvia the adoption of digital technologies and techniques in agriculture\
    \ [27,29,64], leading the\nway to digital representations of plants [9], inventory\
    \ quality in agriculture, greenhouse\nproduction ﬂow, and food safety and quality\
    \ within the food supply chain [45]. Although\nthe DTs remain a major issue in\
    \ our research criteria, in papers [29,45,63,83–85], they are\nimplied as such.\
    \ In [9], authors propose a functional DT model; in [86], they are proposed\n\
    as a signiﬁcant future issue to address and study.\n4.2. The Second Categorization\

    DTs go along with monitoring systems to gather and analyze information. Sensors\n\
    pose a critical role in smart agriculture by facilitating the collection of real-time\
    \ data and\noffering valuable insights into a wide range of environmental and\
    \ agricultural parameters.\nField or soil probes that measure air and ground temperature,\
    \ humidity, soil moisture,\nand ambient light [28,45,73,81,82,88], added to CO2\
    \ sensors measuring relative CO2 con-\ncentration [80,81], and infrared (IR) thermometers\
    \ provide data acquisition modules for\nautomatically controlled actuator systems\
    \ in agriculture approaching digital modelling\nto the food process [64] monitoring\
    \ activities of livestock, optimization of crops, reducing\nemissions to air,\
    \ soil, and water. Drone image cameras [88] and high-resolution photo-\ngraphic\
    \ cameras seem ideal for AR and VR by constructing virtual natural low-polygon\n\
    3D plant models as proposed in [35,74]. Building Information Modeling (BIM) models\
    \ of\nhigh-tech data-driven greenhouses are made feasible as in [79] and provide\
    \ a VR presenta-\ntion of the farm or ﬁeld with the aid of a head-mounted display\
    \ (HMD) with two handheld\ncontrollers serving as handy sensors for manual stimulus.\

    \ sensors and multispectral cameras following an Arduino single-board microcon-\n\

    \ IoT\nsensor nodes to acquire and transmit farm data to IoT gateways or edge\
    \ devices, thus\ncultivating DT requirements for vertical farms, for the greenhouse\
    \ production process and\nﬁnally models in sustainable agriculture.\nRemote detection\
    \ and monitoring of vegetation and crop stress in agriculture seem\nfeasible based\
    \ on [86] utilizing LiDAR—stereo-photogrammetry technology, using multi-\nspectral\
    \ imagery, passive microwave remote sensing, RFID schemes [9,45], active mi-\n\
    crowave remote sensing (RADAR) and sensors onboard UAVs and satellites [45,76,88].\n\
    Location determination in farming via geospatial position (GPS) plays a signiﬁcant\
    \ role in\nthe remote detection and monitoring of vegetation and crop conditions\
    \ in agriculture [88].\nIoT deployments in smart farming are based on serial hardware\
    \ communication pro-\ntocols such as I2C serial bus [28] and UART that uses asynchronous\
    \ serial communication\nwith conﬁgurable speed and pulse width modulation (PWM)\
    \ for driving actuators [77,81],\nin correlation with programmable logic controllers\
    \ (PLC) for data recording [29], monitor-\ning, and optimization aided occasionally\
    \ by fuzzy interference systems (FIS) [73].\nThe decision-making and actions once\
    \ undertaken by the farmers now have given\nway to data-driven agricultural decision-making,\
    \ i.e., assisting them to undertake informed\ndecisions related to planting, fertilization,\
    \ pest control, harvesting, and overall farm man-\nagement. Likewise, derived\
    \ from the smart water management project (SWAMP) [28,73,75]\na hands-on approach\
    \ is being utilized to develop a precision irrigation platform based on\nIoT technology\
    \ for smart water management, distributed in Brazil, Italy, and Spain.\n4.3. The\
    \ Third Categorization of Research Literature That Is Related to Speciﬁc Technical\n\
    Research Aspects\nDTs use software to create, operate, and interact with their\
    \ physical counterparts. The\nsoftware component of a DT enables the collection,\
    \ processing, and analysis of data from\nvarious sources, including sensors, actuators,\
    \ and other connected devices.\nIn [28,77], the high-level programming language\
    \ Python is used for software develop-\nment, scripting, and data analysis, serving\
    \ the purposes of DT applications, implementing\nthe Arduino IDE platform, and\
    \ exploiting the Debian Buster OS to produce a plant simula-\ntion model. Likewise,\
    \ RPi software for the Raspberry Pi platform is used with goal-oriented\nrequirement\
    \ language (GRL) for modelling [80]. We should point out the use of an open\n\
    standard ﬁle format JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) which is used in [73] for\
    \ data repre-\nsentation and communication between systems and is widely adopted\
    \ and supported by\nvarious programming languages and platforms. Speciﬁc software\
    \ packages are utilized\nfor constructing 3D plant models, such as Unreal Engine\
    \ 5, Reality Capture, Photoshop,\nMesh Model Construction, Autodesk, Maya [74],\
    \ Unreal Engine 5 Nanite technology, and\nReality [35]. Other speciﬁc software\
    \ packages serving, for example, the construction of\na DT ﬂowsheet model as in\
    \ [64] found in the researched literature are the Aspen Plus\nand Aspen HYSYS\
    \ from Aspen Technology, Inc. (Burlington, MA, USA), ChemCAD from\nChemstations,\
    \ Inc. (Houston, TX, USA), UniSim Design from Honeywell (Charlotte, NC,\nUSA),\
    \ ProSimPlus from ProSim SA (Labege, France) and PRO/II from AVEVA Group plc.\n\
    Simulation software was employed in this study [28] to generate a virtual setting\
    \ for\nan irrigation system’s digital twin, incorporating a plant simulation model.\n\
    As previously mentioned, in [73], Siemens’s industrial plant simulation software\n\
    was used, and in [74], the Virtual UCF Arboretum Application (V1.0) was developed\n\
    with virtual plant datasets, plant inventories, VR headsets leading to an AR Holodeck\
    \ by\nmultiple captured images taken in 3D space and an AR perpetual garden App.\n\
    In [75], a linear model of plant growth is proposed utilizing a wheat multi-agent\n\
    planning module close enough to the implied structure modelling simulation in\
    \ [29],\nvirtual models are used during the usage phase in [84], an earth system\
    \ model in [78], a\nfarm is represented in 3D in [81], the concept of the DT model\
    \ via data-driven modelling is\nassessed [63]. In [76], the authors imply that\
    \ a software package was developed containing\nSensors 2023, 23, 7128\n29 of 38\n\
    an ontology editor, a DT editor, multi-agent planning module for creating a prototype\
    \ of\nan intelligent plant DT system in Java whilst AR implementations to save\
    \ BIM model ﬁles\nin Film box (.FBX) in [79] by using Unity game engine to provide\
    \ 3D modelling software.\nFurther authors in [9] confronted post-harvest models\
    \ by discrete event simulation such as\ndrying, adding to the simulation models\
    \ for blending and ﬂow DT models [82,83] that rely\nheavily on available real-time\
    \ data a ﬂow for continuous adaption and learning. Finally, DT\nmodelling implies\
    \ simulation, analysis, and prediction [88] that may assess the modelling\nand\
    \ simulation of the fertility of seeds, fertilizers, pesticides, pollution challenges,\
    \ soil\nagents (hydrological models, soil data), and crop agents\nTable 4 summarises\

    Structure\nmodelling\nsimulation\nOn the other hand, AI, ML, and DL algorithms\
    \ seem to be a major issue in [45,63,83,87,88],\nleading to Big Data analytics\
    \ [82] to describe DT modelling that relies heavily on real-time\nSensors 2023,\
    \ 23, 7128\n31 of 38\navailable data ﬂow. The immense amount of data is stored\
    \ in databases such as Mongo\nDB [28,73], Draco, My-SQL [28,73], and SQLite [80,81],\
    \ besides using Excel CSV ﬁles for\nretrieving height values [79] or generally\
    \ mentioned Knowledge bases as in [75] leading to\ncloud big data manipulation\
    \ schemes in [45,81,85]. Major cloud computing platforms such\nas Alibaba Cloud,\
    \ Amazon web services, Google Cloud Platform, IBM, and Microsoft Azure\nare examples\
    \ of cloud computing services provided by leading technology companies that\n\
    serve the DT idea, as seen in [87].\nCloud IoT service broker agents come into\
    \ place as a software component or intermedi-\nary that facilitates the interaction\
    \ between cloud service consumers (users or organizations)\nand cloud service\
    \ providers like FIWARE. In [28,73], FIWARE cloud applications are ex-\nploited,\
    \ adding to IoT broker and IoT agents to facilitate cloud management of context\n\
    information. The procedure includes converting various communication protocols\
    \ into a\nshared base protocol and incorporating intelligent functionality through\
    \ the processing,\nanalysing, and visualising of contextual data. FIWARE generally\
    \ is used as an open-\nsource platform to provide a standardized framework and\
    \ a set of reusable components for\nbuilding smart applications and services in\
    \ the context of the IoT and Future Internet (FI)\ndomains. It aims to simplify\
    \ the development of innovative and interoperable solutions\nby offering a collection\
    \ of open APIs, data models, and software tools that facilitate the\ndevelopment\
    \ of smart applications and services.\nA fuzzy inference system enhances adaptive\
    \ and learning capabilities. It handles\nnonlinear and complex relationships between\
    \ variables, as in [73], in addition to Siemens\nindustrial plant simulation software\
    \ for plant simulation model production with a weather\nstation. In [67,79], the\
    \ Microsoft Excel spreadsheet application is used instead of other\ndedicated\
    \ software such as Geo-Soft-Core, a Geoscientiﬁc Software & Code Repository\n\
    hosted at the archive DIGITAL.CSIC in [78] or Java ontology editor to elaborate\
    \ a DT\neditor in [75,76].\nLastly, wireless network communication technologies\
    \ are addressed in the research\nliterature. Initially, the wired networking technology\
    \ Ethernet is mentioned in [28,73,77],\nwhile the wireless networking technologies\
    \ such as Wi-Fi are mentioned in [35,45,74,77,87],\nLoRaWAN in [45,73], mobile\
    \ or cellular in [45,74,87] and generally mentioned as mandatory\nin [29,82].\
    \ Bluetooth, RFID, and NB-IoT are exploited in [85].\n5. Discussion\nA ﬁrst attempt\
    \ to comment on speciﬁc aspects of the reviewed literature has been done\nin Section\
    \ 2. In total, 14 journal articles or conference papers, including a published\
    \ book,\npropose case studies that support the idea of DT implementation in agriculture,\
    \ contrary to\nthe rest published review papers that sufﬁce to merely describe\
    \ the topic and record the\nachievements of the scientiﬁc community referring\
    \ to it.\nIt is interesting to point out that three (3) relevant case study conference\
    \ papers and a\npublished book, added to nine (9) journal articles, seem to slightly\
    \ overcome the amount\nof the 12 review papers in a total of 26 articles. The\
    \ limited practical application of digital\ntwin technologies is obvious, even\
    \ stated in the literature by the authors.\nEven though [9,86,87] are review papers,\
    \ the authors either describe the necessity of a\nDT model as in [9] for the agriculture\
    \ supply chain management domain, even addressing\nsensors such as level, ﬂow,\
    \ identiﬁcation sensors, RFID or DNA tags, or highlight the need\nfor future study\
    \ on DT models as in [86] making use of remote detection and monitoring\nschemes,\
    \ LiDAR sensors, passive microwave sensing devices, RADARs or even sensors\nonboard\
    \ UAVs and satellites, for monitoring, controlling, coordinating, and executing\
    \ farm\noperations at agricultural sites by IoT sensor nodes as in [87].\nThe\
    \ signiﬁcance of using Sensors as part of a dynamic IoT control-oriented mechanism\n\
    as demanded in DT infrastructure should be acknowledged as in [35,73,74,77,79–81,87,88]\n\
    where soil probes, drone image cameras, multispectral and photographic cameras,\
    \ IR\nthermometers, mini-LiDAR sensors, a mesh of sensors measuring temperature,\
    \ humidity,\nSensors 2023, 23, 7128\n32 of 38\nluminosity, and relative CO2 concentration,\
    \ and air velocity are addressed as essential\nelements to materialize relevant\
    \ IoT platforms accordingly.\nIn [28,73,75,88], the SWAMP IoT-based smart water\
    \ management platform is men-\ntioned. In [19,26], the IoT scheme is merely addressed,\
    \ and in the journal [82], IoT is only\nmentioned as well in the review papers\
    \ [63,85,87], where the IoT is stated as a promising\nconcept. The fact that in\
    \ [73] an OPC UA server is recommended for implementation,\nin [77] an Arduino\
    \ single-board computer is used as well as the Raspberry Pi-3 platform as\nin\
    \ [80,81] in a total of 14 articles that either describe the use of IoT platforms\
    \ or vaguely\npresent a case study project [9,19,26,28,35,64,74–77,79–82] means\
    \ that the practical imple-\nmentation of IoT platforms is quite limited for the\
    \ time being.\nThe necessary software to operate such platforms is focused on\
    \ Python [28,77], ded-\nicated FIS, Json, FIWARE Cygnus connector, IoT Agent,\
    \ OPC agent [73], RPi in [77,80],\nArduino IDE n [77] relevant to the case studies\
    \ previously mentioned. These make use\nof Ethernet communication technologies\
    \ [28,73,77], LoRa [73], and Wi-Fi, [77] in addition\nto [35,74] that make use\
    \ of Wi-Fi and mobile LTE [74] communication technologies that\nfacilitate near\
    \ real-time interaction with the environment.\nThe concept and deﬁnition of DT\
    \ seem to be continuously evolving, but in general,\nit refers to a speciﬁc collection\
    \ of digitally or virtually materialized models that represent\na physical process\
    \ or object. These models are used for simulation and future behavior\nforecasting,\
    \ guiding the feedback loop from the Actuators and Control node to the Physical\n\
    entity, as profoundly visualized in Figures 3–5. The ongoing feedback loop between\
    \ the\nphysical farm and the DT is imperative to update the DT model to optimize\
    \ and enhance\nperformance and efﬁciency.\nSeveral attempts have been made in\
    \ this direction. In the reviews [9,29,63,83,86], the\nconcept of the DT model\
    \ is proposed merely as an evolving concept without an imple-\nmented case study.\
    \ Simulation models [83], referring to data-driven modelling, discrete\nevent\
    \ simulation blending and ﬂow models [9], and structure modelling simulation and\n\
    future multi-domain radiative transfer models (e.g., SCOPE) with dynamic crop\
    \ growth\nmodels for agroecosystems DTs [86] are described merely as proposals\
    \ giving way to future\npractical implementations. On the other hand, in [28],\
    \ simulation software utilizing a\nsimple plant simulation model is employed to\
    \ create a virtual environment for an irrigation\nsystem’s digital twin. In [73],\
    \ the Siemens industrial plant simulation software for the\ndata model is used,\
    \ a model of the Earth system is mentioned in [78], a 3D representation\nof a\
    \ farm in [81], while in [82] it continuous adaption and learning procedure of\
    \ the DT\nmodelling is mentioned as a need that relies heavily on available data.\
    \ A more concise\nproposal to the origin of the holistic DT modelling and simulation\
    \ concept appears in [76],\nwhere a prototype of an intelligent plant DT system\
    \ in Java claimed to be developed, includ-\ning an ontology editor, a digital\
    \ twin editor, and a multi-agent planning module. In [88],\nsimulation, analysis,\
    \ and prediction are addressed by making progress in implementing\nmodelling and\
    \ simulation of the fertility of seeds, fertilizer, pesticides, and pollution\
    \ chal-\nlenges, making efforts to develop plant modelling with soil agents (hydrological\
    \ models,\nsoil data), crop agents and predictive control models, where the adjustment\
    \ of control\nprocesses such as heating and ventilation is automated based on\
    \ short-term temperature\npredictions, ensuring efﬁcient regulation, as an IoT\
    \ derivative scheme.\nA ﬂowsheet model is proposed taking advantage of the widespread\
    \ spreadsheet\napplications of Microsoft Excel in [64] to tamper with simulation\
    \ software such as Aspen\nPlus and Aspen HYSYS from Aspen Technology, Inc. (Burlington,\
    \ MA, USA), ChemCAD\nfrom Chemstations, Inc. (Houston, TX, USA), UniSim Design\
    \ from Honeywell (Charlotte,\nNC, USA), ProSimPlus from ProSim SA (Labege, France)\
    \ and PRO/II from AVEVA Group\nplc, merely to implement a digital modelling approach\
    \ to food processing.\nSpreadsheet applications of Microsoft Excel to retrieve\
    \ height values of plants in high-\ntech data-driven greenhouses are used in [79],\
    \ a fact that proves that process calculations\nand analyses may be conducted\
    \ using popular spreadsheet software like Microsoft Excel\nSensors 2023, 23, 7128\n\
    33 of 38\ndue to its wide accessibility and familiarity among scientists, engineers,\
    \ and professionals\nfrom various ﬁelds.\nEnhanced 3D modelling software derived\
    \ from the game industry, i.e., Unity game en-\ngine dictates BIM models in Film\
    \ box (.FBX) format to aid realistic VR/AR representations\nof greenhouses, providing\
    \ a promising realistic overview of a Smart Agriculture imple-\nmentation. Virtual\
    \ representation is accomplished via Unreal Engine 5, Reality Capture,\nPhotoshop,\
    \ Autodesk, and Maya software platforms to construct Mesh models of Plant\nDatasets\
    \ for Virtual UCF Arboretum Applications, plant inventories, and AR Perpetual\n\
    Garden App. as in [74]. These plant datasets are derived from multiple captured\
    \ images\nin 3D space and incorporate VR headsets aided by GIS and AR Holodeck\
    \ software. Ad-\nditionally, Unreal Engine 5 Nanite technology and Reality are\
    \ used for 3D plant models\noffering a linear plant growth model [35] to descriptively\
    \ sufﬁce the wheat multi-agent\nplanning module. Using multiple captured images\
    \ taken in 3D space to support the AR\nPerpetual Garden App, they produce botanically\
    \ correct plant models for use in museums\nand for educational purposes. A promising\
    \ perspective, if by any chance associated with\nthe essential elements of the\
    \ holistic DT scheme, could be capturing real-time data on\nvarious environmental\
    \ and operational factors via communication technologies leading to\na dynamic\
    \ 3D model of a farm entity.\nBesides the 3D representation of DT models, IoT\
    \ Dashboards [87], such as Grafana in\nparticular [28,73] for real-time data presentation\
    \ and analysis or even GUI prototypes [81],\nare proposed, although used on a\
    \ small scale for facilitating near real-time interaction of\nDTs with the environment.\
    \ To reliably transfer and manage data, Blockchain is used, even\non a smaller\
    \ scale, as in [45,87], while Big Data Analytics, as in [82], AI and ML methods\n\
    that enable data analysis, pattern recognition, and decision-making based on large\
    \ datasets,\nare addressed in [45,63,82,83,86,88]. Cloud-based data analytics\
    \ pose a major issue for\nthe advent of smart agriculture as claimed in [45,85,87],\
    \ not to omit the signiﬁcance of\ndatabases such Mongo DB, Draco, My-SQL as used\
    \ in [28,73] or SQLite in [80], and Cloud\ncomputing service providers such as\
    \ Alibaba Cloud, Amazon web services, Microsoft\nAzure and Google Cloud platform\
    \ [87].\nVarious factors, with technical hurdles being the primary challenge,\
    \ seem to be step-\nping behind to allow even further the adoption of the DT technologies.\
    \ It is essential\nto meticulously design and clearly deﬁne intricate agricultural\
    \ systems to guarantee the\naccuracy of their corresponding DT models.\n6. Future\
    \ Directions\nOnce addressing a DT as a tight combination of an object model,\
    \ in conjunction with\nexpansive sets of data that directly follow the object\
    \ that may evolve and continually modify\nand adapt the model based on the available\
    \ data, it is made clear that future research should\nbe realized to overcome\
    \ the current profound lack of reference models and case studies\naccordingly.\
    \ That could serve as a direct guidance for DT research and development.\nTo broaden\
    \ the aspect of Agriculture 4.0 that needs DTs and overcome the limitations\n\
    of mere telemetry narrowed down by IoT schemes implemented till now, further research\n\
    in implementations using DT modelling, 3D visualization, and simulation schemes\
    \ tar-\ngeting virtual nature applications aided by AR, VR, and GIS information\
    \ systems should\nbe realized.\nFurther research into the holistic model perception\
    \ of plant DTs to overcome the focus\nmerely on the phenotype of plants could\
    \ vastly support DT research. We can pursue\nenhancing the accuracy of depicting\
    \ real-world farms, plants, and crops in the digital realm\nby combining non-georeferenced\
    \ visualizations, like gaming engines, with geospatially\nreferenced 3D geo visualizations.\n\
    Implementing additional case studies of digital twins that adhere to the mentioned\n\
    principles can address challenges related to reliable aggregating and handling\
    \ of data\nfrom diverse sources, integrating multiple streams of information,\
    \ and employing ad-\nSensors 2023, 23, 7128\n34 of 38\nvanced computational methods\
    \ for data processing and analysis, which could enhance the\nunderstanding of\
    \ the subject and aid further studies.\nFurther decommissioning of data in the\
    \ future resulting from search—Tables 1–3\nmight be promising. The diverse and\
    \ abundant potential advantages of DTs in agriculture\ncreate anticipation for\
    \ the future evolution of this technology and its profound impact on\nthe farming\
    \ sector.\nWe aspire for our work to inspire fellow researchers to explore the\
    \ application of DTs\nin agriculture even further.\nAuthor Contributions: Conceptualization,\

  data_sources: The system relies on soil water tension readings obtained from the
    vacuum-type tensiometer.
  explanation: The paper introduces an auto irrigation system that uses a modified
    vacuum-type tensiometer to sense soil water tension, controlling water application
    to maintain predetermined soil water tensions using a timer. The system uses a
    12 V DC battery to power the circuitry, enabling extended operation.

    at predecided soil water tensions and preprogrammed timer. The circuitry can be
    operated with a 12 V d.c. storage battery for a long period.

    Get rights and content Abstract In scientific irrigation scheduling water should
    be applied to a crop at an appropriate soil water tension to fulfil its evapotranspiration
    requirement. Automatic control of water application at predecided soil water tensions
    is an effective irrigation scheduling technique. This can be achieved through
    an indigenously developed auto irrigation system. In this system soil water tension
    is sensed through a modified manometer type tensiometer. The design provides control
    of irrigation at the predecided soil water tensions and preprogrammed timer. The
    circuitry can be operated with a 12 V d.c. storage battery for a long period.

    Metrics Abstract: IoT systems use sensors to collect data from smart environments
    and manage resources through data analysis. An IoT system deals with many connected
    devices with different network and hardware constraints in a real-world scenario.
    An IoT system needs to handle low-latency data analysis, security threats, internal
    vulnerabilities, and network disconnections, which cause data loss and incorrect
    decisions. Trustworthiness (also known as dependability) provides various features
    for an IoT end-to-end data flow, such as resilience, security, availability, reliability,
    scalability, maintainability, heterogeneity, hardware resources management, fault
    management policies, and data quality. This paper presents a survey on trustworthiness
    and dependability in IoT systems and proposes the Trustworthiness for IoT Framework
    (TW-IoT) to provide trustworthiness at the data level for mist and fog-based IoT
    systems. The TW-IoT framework provides data trustworthiness to ensure a continuous
    and uninterrupted operation of IoT data flow. We also discuss challenges and trade-offs
    related to data trustworthiness in IoT. Thing-Mist-Fog-Cloud IoT computing continuum.

    I. Introduction The Internet of Things (IoT) is a networked system with billions
    of connected physical devices (sensors and actuators) transmitting and receiving
    data in a given context application [1]–[3]. IoT systems can monitor water distribution
    and irrigation in agriculture, reduces logistics costs, monitor patient health
    in a hospital, or optimize vehicle traffic through smart traffic lights [4]–[7].
    Therefore, an IoT system grants services to smart scenarios in different contexts,
    efficiently managing hardware, software, and communication resources to reduce
    costs in specific domains. In IoT, dealing with vulnerabilities of a vast number
    of heterogeneous and hardware-constrained devices is a challenge [4], [8]. Trustworthiness
    enhances IoT system features to handle several system challenges. However, there
    is no consensus in the literature about the definition of trustworthiness, as
    some research lines limit this concept to security scope handling only malicious
    attacks [9], [10]. Risks and threats for IoT systems involve malicious attacks
    by external agents and system threats such as faults, vulnerabilities, or unexpected
    system behaviors. Trustworthiness and dependability [11], [12] are similar concepts.
    They include requirements of system availability, reliability, scalability, maintainability,
    heterogeneity, data quality, hardware resources, security, agility in the response
    time, and system and network resilience [13]. A way to enforce trustworthiness
    requirements in IoT systems is using fog computing because it allows real-time
    data analysis at the edge [14]–[17]. Fog computing does not limit data analysis
    to a centralized cloud server. Fog enables local data analysis at the network
    edge [18], [19], reducing the network throughput and the need for data processing
    in a cloud [20], as well as allowing faster decision-making at the edge [19],
    [21]–[23]. However, even a fog-based IoT system has trustworthiness challenges,
    considering mechanisms to manage the IoT devices’ data flow and the network, memory,
    and energy consumption constraints [8], [24], [25]. This paper presents a research
    overview of IoT trustworthiness to identify problems, challenges, approaches,
    solutions, and technologies. We identify gaps and challenges about trustworthiness
    in IoT systems and also propose the Trustworthiness for IoT Framework (TW-IoT).
    Based on mist [26] and fog computing, TW-IoT provides trustworthiness from a data
    flow perspective throughout different IoT stages (thing, mist, fog, and cloud).
    The main contributions of this paper are (i) to clarify concepts, characteristics,
    and gaps about trustworthiness in IoT systems, (ii) to propose the TW-IoT framework
    that contains a set of techniques and mechanisms for ensuring trustworthiness
    in the development of an IoT system based on mist and fog computing, (iii) to
    propose a data flow for each IoT stage (thing, mist, fog, and cloud), using the
    TW-IoT framework, (iv) to expose some trade-offs among trustworthiness mechanisms
    for the IoT data flow and finally, (v) to present the challenges related to trustworthiness
    in IoT systems. The remainder of this paper is organized as follows: Section II
    defines a fog-based IoT system architecture, Section III contextualizes concepts
    of trustworthiness, dependability, and data trustworthiness, Section IV presents
    this paper adopted terminologies, and Section V describes the trustworthiness
    related studies. Section VI introduces the TW-IoT framework for data trustworthiness
    in IoT systems based on mist and fog computing. Section VII exemplifies TW-IoT
    mechanisms for IoT data flow stages (thing, mist, fog, and cloud), and Section
    VIII explains trade-offs between these mechanisms. Section IX discusses the lessons
    learned and challenges, and finally, Section X presents conclusions and future
    work. SECTION II. Thing-Mist-Fog-Cloud IoT Computing Continuum The Internet of
    Things (IoT) connects billions of embedded devices (sensors and actuators), transmitting
    and receiving data in a network [1], [27]. Through Internet, sensors send data
    to be processed and analyzed in a cloud server, whose results can generate instructions
    to actuators. Fig. 1 describes the underlying IoT Computing Continuum [28], providing
    the rationale for analyzing the trustworthiness concept, based on four processing
    stages: thing, mist, fog, and cloud. FIGURE 1. Thing-Mist-Fog-Cloud IoT computing
    continuum. Show All A. Thing Stage The Thing stage contains the physical devices:
    sensors and actuators. Sensors gather data from a specific environment, sending
    them to the Mist stage and beyond. After it, the IoT system uses data fusion or
    different models (e.g., machine/deep learning) according to a specific application
    [29]. As a result, the model generates a decision and sends it back to actuators
    in the Thing stage as commands to change the environment accordingly (e.g., turn
    on/ off some equipment). B. Mist Stage The mist processing stage is closer to
    sensors [30], playing the role of a specific fog node deployed in the field, providing
    direct support for the communication of sensors and actuators with the Internet.
    Mist computing is a subset of fog computing, running on constrained resource equipment,
    such as single-board computers [31], [32]. A mist node significant function is
    behaving as a radio gateway for sensors and actuators, as defined by RFC 8376
    [33]. Also, it can store, preprocess, and analyze data in a distributed fashion
    over multiple nodes. For that reason, one of the mist computing benefits is to
    improve the system scalability, as it may help increase the autonomy of devices
    closer to the edge [26]. C. Fog Stage Fog computing addresses new challenges related
    to the massive amount of data generated by the increasing use of IoT systems [16],
    [18], [20]. Fog computing supports a virtualized computing platform that offers
    processing, storage, and communication services between devices, users, and the
    cloud datacenter [34]. The main goals of fog computing are (i) decreasing latency
    for real-time services negatively affected by the long physical distance between
    devices and cloud data centers, (ii) enabling system load-balance at the edge
    and reducing processing in the cloud, and (iii) decreasing data traffic between
    the edge and the network core as the system does not need to send all data to
    the cloud. Similarly to a cloud service, a fog node can store data and process
    models such as machine learning or data fusion algorithms to forecast certain
    behaviors or make decisions. However, there are significant differences between
    cloud and fog, such as the limited availability of computing resources, the security
    policies, and the hardware performance (memory and processing) [16], [35]. Fog
    is not a mandatory stage in IoT systems. However, its potential benefits may be
    worth it, such as reduced response times at the edge and more robust network resilience
    [36]. Local data processing also prevents sending irrelevant data to the cloud
    [22] by analyzing sensor data locally [20]. D. Cloud Stage Cloud computing has
    data processing high performance because it provides hardware resources in a scalable
    approach through cloud services virtualization [37]. A cloud service customer
    can execute multiple processes on a large scale since the cloud provides distributed
    hardware resources on demand for these processes [38]. The cloud plays a crucial
    role in any IoT system. Theoretically, the cloud stage is not needed because everything
    can be processed at an edge, e.g., in a farm office for smart agriculture. However,
    in practice, the cloud’s resources, robustness, and reliability, either public
    or private, are unavoidable characteristics. SECTION III. Trustworthiness and
    Related Paradigms In this section, we explain the concepts of trustworthiness,
    dependability, and data trustworthiness. A. Trustworthiness and Dependability
    Trustworthiness allows the uninterrupted continuity of system services [39]. In
    other words, a trustworthy (dependable) system should adapt and tolerate vulnerabilities
    throughout its life cycle [40]. The trustworthiness definition consists of system
    requirements concerning multiple aspects, such as security, resilience, availability,
    reliability, scalability, maintainability, heterogeneity, data quality, hardware
    resources, and fault management policies [13]. Some authors limit the trustworthiness
    concept as dealing with system security only [9], [41]. However, throughout this
    paper, trustworthiness and dependability are equivalent concepts [11], [12]. Trustworthiness
    is not only associated with failures in the system security level (by attacks)
    but also with general system vulnerabilities [13], [42]–[44]. Therefore, we consider
    the concepts of trustworthiness and dependability as synonyms, even though there
    is no consensus in the community [11], [12]. IoT critical systems need to deal
    with privacy, heterogeneity, and data analysis from billions of devices [45] in
    real-time, as well as system failures and real-time decision-making [45], [46].
    Consequently, trustworthiness is essential in these IoT environments [47]–[50].
    B. Data Trustworthiness Trustworthiness is not limited only to enhance the system
    at the software/hardware level but also to improve the system at the data level
    [44], [51]. An IoT system that collects data in an environment must ensure the
    data trustworthiness, verifying if that data contains relevant information to
    the application domain. Data trustworthiness needs to ensure data veracity, according
    to the IoT system context [52], [53]. For example, supposing the IoT system collects
    data from tropical weather. In that case, the IoT system must verify the data
    behavior, referring to these climate conditions. Otherwise, in future data analysis,
    the IoT system may not respond correctly, making wrong decisions, causing a vulnerability
    at the data level. In an IoT system, ensuring data trustworthiness also means
    ensuring resilient data flow. Therefore, the data trustworthiness consists of
    maintaining data flow continuity and trusted system decisions [44], [53]. SECTION
    IV. Adopted Terminologies We adopt terminologies in this paper as the IoT system
    concepts, IoT smart service, IoT smart application, context, and a mechanism in
    our proposal called the integration of smart everything (explained in Section
    VII). We refer to the system context as circumstance or condition related to external
    or internal variations in an IoT system environment [17], [54], [55], as the weather
    temperature, energy consumption, soil moisture, or wind velocity measurement variations.
    An IoT smart service contains smart applications. For example, a smart service
    refers to smart farming, smart mobility, or smart hospital service. At the same
    time, a smart application corresponds to applications of these smart services.
    Thus, a smart farming service contains smart applications like smart irrigation,
    smart water management, smart pest control, and a smart monitoring crop growth
    application. The IoT system represents the entire hardware and software system,
    which contains IoT smart services and, consequently, IoT smart applications. An
    ideal IoT system has multiple smart services connected by the mechanism that we
    call smart everything. SECTION V. Trustworthiness Related Studies We searched
    studies that explicitly use concepts and definitions of trustworthiness and dependability
    with the following combination of terms: dependability and IoT, trustworthiness
    and IoT, trustworthy IoT. We searched papers in IEEE Xplore, ACM Digital Library,
    Google Scholar, Science Direct, and Springer Link. We also examined the abstracts
    of the articles. For the survey scope, we found a total of 57 studies related
    to dependability and trustworthiness. We perceived that 56 investigations refer
    to IoT, fog, or edge computing. We also observed that one study only focusing
    mainly on physical devices (sensors and actuators). We identified 24 papers referring
    only to trustworthiness, 27 to dependability, and six mentioned both terms (TABLE
    1). TABLE 1 Topics Per Paper A. Related Studies Categories We classify 57 studies
    related to dependability and trustworthiness: 18 present conceptual studies, 10
    introduce a framework, 10 describe a mathematical investigation, eight present
    a performance analysis, six report algorithms or techniques, three show an architectural
    approach, and two focus on hardware related issues (Fig. 2). FIGURE 2. Related
    studies categories. Show All 1) Conceptual Regarding studies that present definitions
    on dependability and trustworthiness, some papers explore the state of the art
    and definitions [9], [42], [43], [56]–[63]. We also found surveys on trustworthiness
    [64]–[68] and dependability [69] and a systematic literature review (SLR) on dependability
    [70]. 2) Framework Design Some papers propose a framework for resource management
    in fog/cloud [71], other propose a framework for trust management for IoT devices
    [51], [72], [73], and fog nodes [74]. Also, some papers focus on security issues
    [10], [75]–[77] or fault recovery [78]. 3) Mathematical Approach Among research
    on IoT dependability, we found five studies that present mathematical approaches
    to measuring system reliability and availability [79]–[83]. In contrast, two others
    propose a calculus to estimate a confidence score to sensors [41], [84], and users
    [85]. We also found a proposal for an optimization approach for some dependability
    characteristics [86] and a theoretical approach based on Markov models to deal
    with vulnerabilities in a healthcare system [87]. 4) Performance Analysis Among
    the papers reporting a performance evaluation, some analyze trustworthiness by
    energy consumption [88]–[90], evaluate protocols [91], and communication interfaces
    [92]. Two papers compare different machine learning techniques for malicious data
    detection [93], [94], and another one compares machine learning techniques for
    data (image) reconstruction [95]. 5) Algorithms/Techniques We identified papers
    that propose techniques or algorithms to improve dependability characteristics
    [39], [96]–[98], or techniques related to trust management mechanisms [99], [100].
    6) Architectural Approach We found three studies that propose architectural approaches:
    an architectural approach for a gateway that provides security to an IoT system
    [101]; a conceptual architecture for data provenance [102]; a standards-oriented
    approach [103]. 7) Hardware Design We found two studies that propose solutions
    at the hardware level, dealing with system cryptography [104], and with limited
    computational resources in IoT focused on device memory constraints [105]. B.
    Trustworthiness Features We consider the following set of features describes the
    trustworthiness concept: security (integrity, confidentiality, availability, and
    authenticity), system and network resilience, data quality (and semantic integrity),
    system availability, system reliability, scalability, maintainability, survivability,
    heterogeneity, IoT constraints (latency, memory, processing power, energy consumption),
    fault management and redundancy (see TABLE 2). TABLE 2 Trustworthiness Features
    in Related Work 1) Security Data security is a feature for ensuring the IoT system
    trustworthiness [64], [88], [106]. A secure system needs to provide data integrity,
    authenticity, confidentiality to protect data from malicious attacks or not authorized
    access [107]. As shown in TABLE 2, we observed that security is the most mentioned
    feature of an IoT system’s trustworthiness. The main security features that we
    found as follows: Integrity: refers to data content preservation, ensuring that
    data is not corrupted or altered by a malicious user or software. Integrity is
    strongly associated with IoT system trustworthiness because fraudulent data turns
    the system no longer reliable [64] since it makes wrong decisions [66]. Authenticity:
    IoT data is authentic when it comes from a source that is a trusted part of the
    system [104], [107]. Unknown sensors can transmit non-authentic data with information
    that differs from the application context [97]. One way to deal with unreliable
    sensors in IoT is through the traceability of transmitted data [73] or by verifying
    the behavior of network sensors’ energy consumption [84]. When there is a lack
    of data authenticity, integrity is not necessarily compromised, as the data is
    not corrupted or altered but fabricated. Therefore, a trustworthy IoT system must
    deal with mechanisms to verify data authenticity. Confidentiality: ensures that
    third parties have no access to IoT devices’ data by packet interception [65].
    Consequently, the IoT system must restrict data access via encryption mechanisms
    and access validation policies [64]. Availability: from the security viewpoint,
    availability deals with interruptions [9], [104] caused by attacks such as denial
    of service (DoS), for example. However, the availability concept has a broader
    scope. A system can stop working even without any external attack but due to other
    vulnerabilities. 2) Resilience Resilience of a computer system is part of the
    trustworthiness concept [94]. It includes the ability to deal with system failures.
    Thus, a resilient system can prevent, tolerate, mitigate, remove, and predict
    failures [108], [109]. In a system with devices connected to a network, resilience
    is responsible for maintaining or recovering the communication service between
    devices, regardless of network failures [110], [111]. The concept of resilience
    is the system’s ability to resist failures [112] using recoverability (survivability),
    adaptability, and the capacity to manage failures [13]. Network, hardware, or
    software vulnerabilities can interrupt a system service, so the system must react
    to these failures when they occur. However, there are computing costs to support
    system resilience [113]. The system requires resources to recover from a failure,
    to solve or mitigate a threat, reducing or compromising the system performance.
    A resilient IoT system must deal with resource constraints (network, battery,
    memory, and processing capacity limitations) because IoT devices must react to
    failures as quickly as possible. After all, operations must occur in real-time
    [69]. A resilient fog-based IoT system data flow must prevent data losses caused
    by the network connection failure between mist/fog components. The fog also needs
    to deal with data loss due to low storage capacity in mist/fog nodes memory [111].
    A relevant resilience challenge deals with network disconnection between components
    of different IoT stages, such as thing, mist, fog, or cloud [16], [114]–[121].
    Therefore, it is necessary to establish mechanisms to ensure resilience to fog-based
    IoT systems for data transmission [16], [122], such as fault management mechanisms
    for IoT nodes [16]. A resilient system must provide security and fault management
    mechanisms. The survivability concept offers the system’s continuity through fault
    recovery techniques, which recovery techniques are one of the fault management
    features. Moreover, redundancy is a technique that the system uses to recover
    from a failure. 3) Fault Management In computer systems, a failure represents
    an unexpected behavior. In the IoT data domain, it is possible to exemplify some
    of these behaviors as data integrity loss due to semantic/syntactic vulnerabilities,
    packet loss due to network interference or connection loss between fog nodes [70],
    and data loss caused by network exhaustion or device memory overflow. The literature
    categorizes fault management into four main aspects: fault detection, fault prediction,
    fault recovery (or mitigation), and fault prevention: Fault detection: fault detection
    in IoT is the verification of unexpected behavior using, for example, statistical
    analysis or machine learning methods [69]. IoT makes it possible to detect sensor
    failures, for example, by monitoring data values coming, such as the detection
    of outliers [97]. Fault prediction: consists of predicting the fault occurrence.
    In IoT, the most common method for predicting a fault is through probabilistic
    models or data regression techniques. Fault recovery or mitigation: A way of recovering
    from a failure in IoT is, for example, using load balancing between nodes to mitigate
    service discontinuation [74]. Some studies also deal with IoT fault recovery by
    using redundancy techniques [58]. Fault prevention: When the system predicts a
    fault (perceive the fault condition before it occurs), the system can perform
    mechanisms to prevent a failure (which refers to the system’s inability to operate).
    Redundancy is an example of a mechanism for fault prevention by replicating data
    from a fog node to other fog nodes. 4) Survivability Survivability is part of
    the concept of resilience and represents a system’s ability to survive attacks,
    failures, or degradation [13], [61]. In the fog computing scope, survivability
    maintains the data flow continuity between the IoT stages (from the thing stage
    until the cloud stage). This feature uses some mechanisms to increase an IoT system’s
    ability to survive vulnerabilities, such as data replication or fault management
    mechanisms. Also, fog-based IoT systems can rely on load balancing. In the fog
    node’s imminent resource exhaustion, the fog can transfer its workload to other
    nodes [74]. An open issue related to survivability is data loss [16], which can
    occur by an eventual disconnection between IoT stages, such as between fog and
    cloud. After a disconnection, when the connection returns, the data not sent to
    the cloud is not necessarily immediately transmitted, causing a data flow gap
    between fog and cloud. Therefore, IoT stages must store data temporarily during
    disconnections and transmit it to the next stage when the connection is active
    again. Delay-tolerant networking (DTN) is a mechanism that deals with data loss
    due to network disconnections [123] and can be used together with fog-based IoT
    systems [124]–[128]. However, these proposals only focus on delay or packet loss,
    disregarding the solution impact on fog resources. Besides, the DTN design does
    not deal with IoT trustworthiness requirements. 5) Redundancy Redundancy increases
    IoT systems’ reliability and availability [58] by replicating data from one node
    to other nodes. When, for example, a fog node A fails, the system continues to
    operate if other fog nodes B and C have a data copy from the failed fog node A.
    Redundancy is not limited to providing system data replication. It also includes
    connection replication using different communication technology on the same IoT
    device [82], [83]. For example, in case of a connection failure in the LPWAN interface,
    the device may use a Wi-Fi or 4G connection to reestablish communication with
    other nodes [92]. 6) Data Quality/Semantic Integrity Data quality is related to
    the IoT system context, and it directly impacts the solution decisions. The system
    context refers to a circumstance or condition related to external or internal
    variations in an IoT system environment [17], [54], [55], as the weather temperature,
    energy consumption, soil moisture, or wind velocity measurement variations. Assuring
    data quality involves verifying whether the gathered data represents the actual
    system context [51], which means that semantic data integrity is essential in
    assessing data quality [129]. For example, in an environment where the climate
    is always humid, data with a dry climate’s characteristics is likely wrong. As
    the IoT system context directly impacts the actuators’ actions, maintaining data
    quality ensures data trustworthiness [51]. The IoT system can verify data trust
    by the data type, system behavior, and context. Therefore, an IoT system previously
    needs to know the context and problem domain to provide trustworthy data analysis
    [129]. An IoT system needs to use meaningful data for decision-making [130], which
    means that part of the initial data processing must identify and remove data outliers.
    However, in cases of fake or manipulated data, it is necessary to observe whether
    the data comes from unreliable sensors [65], [95]. A data filter can solve this
    problem [97] since fake data can compromise future system actions. 7) System Availability
    Availability ensures that the IoT system continues operating as long as possible.
    There are methods to keep the system available, like managing hardware redundancy
    [63], [82], and maintaining a fault management mechanism [58]. Some IoT applications
    are latency-sensitive and, consequently, require low latency for transmitting
    packets between IoT stages. Therefore, these systems are always available when
    it performs all actions in real-time [60]. System availability is a metric that
    indicates the operation system probability until it begins a failure state (Equation
    1) [131]. Therefore, availability is given by the MTTF (mean time to failure)
    divided by MTTF + MTTR (mean time to repair). Availability= MTTF MTTF+MTTR (1)
    View Source 8) System Reliability Reliability, as well as availability, is a relevant
    metric to ensure IoT trustworthiness. However, it is worth empathizing that both
    concepts differ since availability demands the whole system to be continuously
    available, while reliability refers to system operations’ confidence [63]. Thus,
    reliability can be measured by the probability that a system will behave as expected
    for a specific time interval (t). We measure the reliability by the MTBF (mean
    time between failures) metric if the system has some fault recovery mechanism.
    However, we measure the reliability by the MTTF (mean time to failure) if there
    is no recovery mechanism. For calculation, the first case we consider λ=1 / MTBF
    and for the second λ=1 / MTTF. Thus, we describe reliability by Equation (2),
    where R (t) is the reliability function of time t, and λ is the miss rate [132].
    R(t)= e −λt (2) View Source 9) Scalability In a scenario with thousands or millions
    of sensors, IoT systems must satisfy the scalability demand to sustain a massive
    data transmission, storage, and analysis in real-time [15], [19]. A trustworthy
    system must be scalable because poor system performance and slow data analysis
    can result in delayed and, consequently, wrong decisions. Besides, with imprecise
    choices, the system harms data trustworthiness. The scalability feature implies
    providing more computing resources to the IoT system [63]. In a fog-based IoT
    system, nodes can become computationally saturated because, in a real scenario,
    the fog is responsible for dealing with thousands of devices [60]. Therefore,
    the scalable deployment of fog computing systems requires the necessary hardware
    infrastructure. The IoT system is more trustworthy with thousands of sensors because
    it stores more information, allowing it to make more precise decisions based on
    the gathered data. However, a system with many sensors demands additional security,
    network, and resilience requirements. Maintain a scalable and continuous data
    flow requires communication resilience between the IoT stages (mist-mist, mist-fog,
    fog-fog, and fog-cloud) [24], [122]. 10) Heterogeneity A real IoT system scenario
    comprises several heterogeneous communications and device technologies [27]. IoT
    communication protocols provide interaction between different devices because
    IoT devices have different hardware technologies and cannot understand each other.
    Multiple protocols differ in terms of packet formats and communication technologies,
    and not all protocols can support every IoT system [133]. Furthermore, dealing
    with heterogeneity is an essential trustworthiness issue. LPWAN (low power wide
    area network) technologies provide long transmission ranges, low energy consumption,
    and low bandwidth. LPWAN is an attractive technology for IoT systems that send
    a few dozens of bytes every couple of minutes or hours [134], [135]. LoRaWAN,
    Sigfox, and NB-IoT are LPWAN technologies leading this front [27], [136]. There
    are other technologies for IoT system communications, as Bluetooth [133], Zigbee
    [137], and Z-Wave [138]. The IoT developer can also adopt IEEE 802.11 standards
    (Wi-Fi), transmitting over short-range distances by devices with no battery constraints
    [133]. IoT system trustworthiness solves the interconnection problems between
    heterogeneous devices. The massive number of highly heterogenous devices can increase
    communication faults in IoT infrastructures [69]. Hence, the system must support
    interoperability [76], allowing intercommunication between applications and devices
    for every connected node [20]. 11) Quality of Service (QOS) IoT systems, based
    on fog or not, must process data from thousands of sensors in real-time. Therefore,
    there is a concern with network latency in sending data from a stage to another
    since a long packet delay can impair critical decisions ’ agility and correctness.
    There is also a data loss problem caused by low-quality network connection [89]
    or caused by a disconnection between IoT stages. Some IoT latency-sensitive systems
    do not accept packet delay or packet loss problems [50]. These circumstances only
    contribute to generating undesirable behavior, affecting the system’s trustworthiness.
    As previously mentioned, trustworthiness also deals with the choice of communication
    technologies. There may be interference between specific transmission protocol
    frequencies or range restrictions between devices [133], [136]. For example, for
    the Zigbee technology [137], the transmission distance range is lower than the
    LoRaWAN range [136]. 12) Memory Capacity Maintaining all system data stored is
    a way to ensure IoT data trustworthiness [56]. However, IoT devices frequently
    suffer from primary memory constraints. Keeping data in an IoT device for an indefinite
    time has a high cost. If we suppose a fog node that loses the cloud connection
    but continues to receive data from sensors and stores the data until the Internet
    connectivity returns, the storage memory can overflow. In this case, data fusion
    is a way to reduce these costs, joining consecutive stored data [105]. 13) Energy
    Consumption Most IoT devices have little autonomy due to limited battery [88],
    [59]. The impact of this constraint can reflect in (i) faults of data gathering
    whenever a sensor runs out of battery [89], (ii) storage gaps in a data time series,
    and (iii) wrong data analysis, since the gap in time series, harms the data analysis,
    and consequently untrusty decisions. Therefore, data trustworthiness needs to
    consider the device’s energy consumption. In smart farming, energy harvesting
    is a feasible solution for device battery constraints, such as photovoltaic cells
    [139]. However, this strategy does not work for all scenarios. For this reason,
    a relevant research challenge is reducing energy consumption in IoT devices [140],
    [141]. 14) Processing Power One critical aspect of IoT systems design and development
    is the limited devices processing power capacity [59]. Therefore, it is crucial
    to consider the processing constraints, especially for mist and fog nodes, since
    they are, to a great extent, responsible for ensuring trustworthiness. In latency-sensitive
    IoT systems, some scenarios require real-time data processing [56], and the processing
    power directly impacts a system execution time (see Equation 3) [131]. Many IoT
    operations are related to fault detection, data redundancy, or load balancing.
    Therefore, IoT processing power is a concern to provide trustworthiness to IoT
    systems. CPU execution time for a program = CPU clock cycles for a program Clock
    rate (3) View Source 15) Maintainability Maintainability refers to a system’s
    capacity to deal with changes [59], [69], including system evolution and adaptation.
    In a resilient computer system, adaptability suggests that the system can learn
    specific attack types to make the most appropriate decisions to protect against
    an attack [13]. C. V’S of Big Data and Trustworthiness Features in IoT Big data
    systems have several V features, such as variety, veracity, volume, velocity,
    and value [142], [143], which overlap some data trustworthiness characteristics
    for IoT. Variety deals with heterogeneity problems such as the treatment of data
    types. Veracity relates to data quality. Volume reflects the concern of analyzing
    information on a very large scale. Velocity assumes that computer systems must
    process and store data in real-time. Finally, value considers the data relevance
    for an application [142], [143]. SECTION VI. TW-IoT Framework: a Mist-Fog-Based
    Framework for Data Trustworthiness to the Internet of Things In Section V, we
    presented the related studies on trustworthiness for IoT. However, there is still
    an unbridged gap in the literature: an architectural framework with concrete roles
    and mechanisms to ensure data trustworthiness in each stage of a mist-fog computing
    architecture. With this challenge in mind, we propose the Trustworthiness for
    IoT Framework (TW-IoT) (Fig. 3), comprised of features, mechanisms, recommendations,
    and methods to ensure data flow continuity and data trustworthiness for mist-fog-based
    IoT systems. The proposed framework contains four stages (thing, mist, fog, and
    cloud), based on the IoTinuum architecture [28] (Section II) and four layers (device,
    transport, data, and model) based on the IoTecture architecture [28]: Device Layer:
    comprises different mechanisms to ensure data trustworthiness in the physical
    devices. Transport Layer: contains mechanisms responsible for packet security
    and trustworthiness in connection, communication, and data transmission over the
    network. Data Layer: contains mechanisms for ensuring data quality and dealing
    with meaningful information in the data, as data value and veracity. Model Layer:
    this layer is related to trustworthiness in data decision models and system data
    analysis. FIGURE 3. TW-IoT framework mechanisms. Show All We also propose six
    data trustworthiness design views: data processing, data resilience, data trust,
    data security, data heterogeneity, and data fusion (Fig. 3). A. Data Resilience
    View The IoT system needs to ensure continuous and uninterrupted data flow through
    the IoT stages. Therefore, we design the data resilience view to endure vulnerabilities
    and data loss. This view includes data prediction, data flow persistence (data
    persistence mechanism, load balance, redundancy), and storage management mechanisms.
    1) Data Persistence Mechanism This mechanism focuses on ensuring data persistence
    when the network between the IoT stages disconnects. The data persistence mechanism
    improves communication between the different IoT stages, considering typical limitations
    of mist and fog nodes. The data persistence mechanism regularly performs health
    checks in network connections to avoid data losses between IoT stages. Simultaneously,
    mist and fog nodes store the data locally because they send the data later when
    the link returns, after a connection failure event. The IoT nodes have constrained
    memory resources, so deploying together the data persistence mechanism and the
    data filter mechanism (subsection B.1) reduces the amount of data transmitted.
    This persistence mechanism may cause inconveniences for long disconnections without
    the filtering mechanism, such as mist memory overflow and long data transmission
    delays. 2) Data Prediction Data prediction is a mechanism that maintains data
    flow persistence when the data from a previous stage does not reach the destination
    stage. One of the reasons for data loss is the run out of the battery of the sensors
    or network disconnections. Without the complete time series, the system makes
    incorrect decisions. Data prediction using machine learning algorithms can mitigate
    the data time series gaps and provide more reliable decisions. However, supposing
    that the system receives the lost data at the future moment, the system needs
    to replace the original data with the data created by prediction algorithms. In
    other words, it needs to compose new historical data. 3) Storage Manager Billions
    of sensors can periodically collect and transmit data. The mist/fog stages are
    responsible for storing this massive amount of data, but these nodes have limited
    memory capacity. One way to solve this problem is by using data filtering (subsection
    B.1). The system needs to evaluate how long the mist/fog nodes should preserve
    old data, thus assessing the impact that deleting old data cause on the system’s
    trustworthiness. 4) Load Balance The load balancing mechanism prevents a mist/fog
    node from exhausting memory and processing resources. When a fog node reaches
    maximum hardware utilization in an IoT scenario, fog can alert mist nodes to redirecting
    part of future data to other fog nodes with time-driven sensors. In IoT scenarios
    with event-based sensors, an overloaded fog node can temporarily redirect data
    to another fog node. 5) Redundancy Redundancy is a way to ensure system continuity
    in the event of IoT node failures. Through redundancy, the system may find a new
    data path through other mist or fog nodes. A redundancy mechanism presumes that
    nodes always replicate data to other nodes whenever possible. Therefore, if a
    node loses connection or fails, the system can use another node to maintain the
    data flow. B. Data Fusion View This design view is responsible for implementing
    data filtering mechanisms in the mist and fog stages. It is also responsible for
    verifying and selecting data models used to make decisions. 1) Data Filtering
    Data reduction (filtering) mechanisms optimize the data flow between mist, fog,
    and cloud [22], [144]–[148]. However, data filtering must deal with mist and fog
    resource constraints regarding the processing and storage capacity for a smart
    service (like smart farming) or with different smart applications of this service
    (like smart irrigation, smart water management, or smart crop growth monitoring).
    Data filters are particularly relevant at the mist and fog stages, especially
    in long disconnections, given the need to store data temporarily until the connection
    returns. Filtered data occupies less memory space, thus avoiding memory overflow.
    Also, data can be transmitted faster when the connection returns, minimizing latency.
    Filtering mechanisms can achieve significant data reduction while dealing with
    memory and latency constraints. In general terms, IoT data transmitted in short
    intervals can contain identical or very close values and classified through a
    data fusion model. This approach divides the data filtering mechanisms into two
    main methods: (i) the data fusion filtering method (by data sampling or classification
    [148]) and (ii) the data compression filtering method: Data fusion filtering method:
    fusion-based data filtering can adopt different techniques, considering smart
    applications and the computational capacity of IoT stages. The mist node has not
    the same computational power as the fog node. In other words, different stages
    need to apply different data fusion techniques for various applications. Therefore,
    it is necessary to evaluate the fusion filtering techniques concerning the constraints
    of each IoT stage. Data fusion can reduce the amount of data stored by statistical
    sampling or by data classification techniques. However, supposing that the sampling
    or classification techniques are not precise or accurate, the filtered data may
    lose details. Consequently, the system can make worse decisions. Data compression
    filtering method: allows the compression of data content and reduces data to a
    smaller size, thus lowering the resource requirements for transmission and storage.
    The data compression advantage is maintaining its details when uncompressed because
    it restores the original content. However, uncompressing generates computational
    costs because data always returns to the original size, demanding more resources
    from that particular IoT stage. 2) Quality of Context (QOC) in Data Fusion Filtering
    The consequence of fusion-based filtering is data reduction, which requires the
    data quality to be maintained. Therefore, one needs to understand how much reduction
    can be performed without jeopardizing future analysis in a given context. Ensuring
    the quality of the context in data fusion means refraining from excessively filtering.
    Therefore, IoT system designers can use a mechanism to verify the filtered data’s
    quality based on the application context and decision models. 3) Analytic Models
    An IoT system needs to perform data gathering, monitoring, and analysis to extract
    information from a given context. Thus, based on environmental conditions or circumstances
    (context), the system makes decisions based on application rules (decision data
    models) for each specific smart application [54], [130], [149]. IoT systems can
    analyze data from individual IoT smart services (as smart farming) and store information
    from sensors of different smart applications (like smart irrigation, smart water
    management, or smart crop growth monitoring, for example). Thus, the system can
    analyze data from more than one smart application to enhance the decisions. As
    the decision accuracy is directly related to the data model, this mechanism needs
    to automatically select a decision model according to the specific smart application.
    C. Data Trust View The data trust view provides a data path without data syntactic
    and semantic integrity losses with meaningful information. This view deals with
    the features of data value, data veracity, entity veracity, data order, and data
    periodicity. 1) Data Value According to the smart application, the data value
    presumes that sensors must gather the necessary and relevant information for the
    IoT system. The lack of data or unnecessary excess of data can negatively impact
    future decisions. Therefore, the data value mechanism is responsible for checking
    the essential data to the IoT system based on the application and the data decision
    model. For example, in a smart farming service, the data value mechanism works
    as follows: a sensor collects soil moisture measures from three different depths
    in a field. Supposing that the crop is in an early growth stage, the plant root
    size only reaches the first depth. Therefore, the IoT system can safely discard
    soil moisture measurements from deeper depths because they do not convey meaningful
    information. 2) Data Veracity The data veracity mechanism must verify and discard
    outliers in a data set for a given context. It also perceives manipulated, corrupted,
    and fabricated data targeted by attacks or interference. 3) Entity Veracity The
    entity veracity is an extension of the data veracity concept to verify whether
    an entity, like a sensor or mist node, is transmitting unreliable data to fog.
    The veracity mechanism is responsible for identifies untrusted entities using
    a trust score. IoT designers can use algorithms to obtain this score [41], [51].
    They can form the entity trust score by identifying the number of untrusted packets
    and their origin entity. An untrusted entity transmits untrustworthy data caused
    by malicious attacks or internal hardware/software failures. Therefore, the IoT
    system needs to discard received data from that entity to ensure the data trustworthiness.
    4) Periodicity Data gathering frequency directly impacts the network traffic between
    the IoT stages and the accuracy of system decisions. The shorter the gathering
    interval, the greater the number of collected data and perceived details. Some
    IoT systems have time-driven sensors gathering data by a fixed time interval.
    It is essential to find the ideal time interval for data gathering to obtain relevant
    decisions according to the smart application [134]. 5) Data Ordering After a network
    disconnection between the fog and the cloud, the fog nodes can send past and present
    data not ordered. Because of it, the IoT system needs to put data in order. An
    IoT application can analyze a data time series to make a decision. Sometimes the
    data order matters to guarantee trustworthy choices. Therefore, maintaining the
    chronological data order impacts the IoT system data trustworthiness. D. Data
    Processing View A fog-based IoT system needs to execute instructions and handle
    the massive data transmission in batch, in real-time, or near real-time speed.
    The lambda architecture addresses the data volume and processing in real-time
    and batch [150]. However, this architecture works for high-performance systems.
    The IoT system designers can reuse concepts from this architecture and apply them
    to fog computing standards. 1) Data Volume A massive data volume requires an indispensable
    concern with the system’s scalability. The IoT system must calculate and evaluate
    how much data each node can store and analyze, considering its hardware resource
    constraints. A node that reaches its hardware limits may use a load balancing
    mechanism to maintain the data flow under normal operating circumstances. 2) Data
    Transmission Velocity IoT latency-sensitive systems require real-time decisions,
    so mist/fog needs to analyze data in real-time. Data transfer delays may cause
    unexpected or delayed decisions. Consequently, the transmission velocity impacts
    data trustworthiness. Developers of a mist-fog-based IoT system need to design
    the IoT stages considering the communication protocols, the data flow volume,
    and hardware constraints used for each mist/fog node to increase the data transfer
    velocity. 3) Data Processing Velocity The IoT system developers need to consider
    batch, near real-time, and real-time data processing techniques for different
    smart applications to ensure desirable speed performance. 4) Auto Power On/Off
    The scope of the data processing view also deals with the execution of data gathering
    by sensors. The auto power-off mechanism works for IoT systems based on time-driven
    sensors (i.e., not event-driven sensors). This mechanism turns sensors off to
    consume less energy. It only turns the sensors on again during the next data gathering
    period. This mechanism is feasible in many fog-based IoT systems, such as in the
    SWAMP project scenario [6], that sensors gather data periodically in 10-minute
    intervals. However, supposing that the gathering time interval is too short, IoT
    designers need to conduct a performance evaluation to verify the impact of energy
    consumption before deploying it. E. Data Heterogeneity View The heterogeneity
    view has mechanisms that deal with different communication protocols, data types,
    and data formats for various smart applications. 1) Device Technology In a scenario
    with billions of sensors from different hardware and software vendors, it is expected
    that the sensors use other measurement units and scales for the same type of data.
    For example, temperature sensors may gather data in various scales such as Celsius,
    Fahrenheit, or Kelvin. Therefore, this mechanism proposes to homogenize different
    data scales. 2) Communication Technology Homogeneity There are several communication
    protocols, and each one better meets the demands of specific environments. Supposing
    that a fog node receives packets from different protocols, such as LoRa, Sigfox,
    and Zigbee, the fog node needs to understand the protocol formats and extract
    data from packet payloads. The communication technology homogeneity mechanism
    interprets message patterns for different protocols. This mechanism can also convert
    several protocol messages into only one type of protocol message format. 3) Data
    Type The IoT system deals with different data types to make a decision. Smart
    healthcare data from a hospital, for example, may contain text, audio, video,
    and image. IoT system designers need to consider all data types, integrating it
    with the scale conversion mechanism, whether this mechanism did not previously
    deploy in the thing stage. 4) Data Format In the IoT stages, it is necessary to
    deal with different data types and formats. For example, in smart city applications,
    images may have other formats such as JPEG, PNG, or BMP. Data values may also
    have different formats such as binary, octal, hexadecimal, or decimal. This mechanism
    needs to use a well-known technique to homogenize the data formats into just one,
    enabling the IoT stages to analyze it. 5) Data Application Integration A fog-based
    IoT system handles many smart applications that belong to the same smart service.
    A smart farming service, for example, can support different smart applications,
    such as precision irrigation, crop stock management, or pest control. Considering
    that data gathering and decisions for different smart applications influence the
    whole system environment, this mechanism needs to combine data between different
    smart applications of the same smart service. Additionally, it needs to adequately
    analyze data by selecting and merging different data analytics models. 6) Integration
    of Smart Everything A complex and robust smart city environment includes smart
    homes, smart healthcare, and smart mobility. In this case, the system needs to
    manage and integrate different smart services to interconnect the entire system.
    Therefore, we suggest a mechanism that allows the system to make decisions based
    on integrated data analysis using the data knowledge of all IoT smart services.
    In a hypothetical smart city system, an IoT home service detects a home accident.
    The home service transmits this information to a smart healthcare service that
    requests a smart mobility service to check the city’s best route and send an ambulance.
    Therefore, in this case, the heterogeneity view is responsible for integrating
    all system services by a mechanism called the integration of smart everything.
    Section VII.D describes the proposal for the operation of this mechanism. F. Data
    Security View Security is essential for maintaining data trustworthiness in an
    IoT system. A fog-based IoT system uses data encrypting for every IoT stage to
    ensure data confidentiality and integrity. There are various data encryption and
    decryption algorithms that demand specific execution time and computational resources.
    The decision of the security policy needs to consider hardware constraints inherent
    to each IoT stage. SECTION VII. Framework Data Flow In Section VI, we presented
    the TW-IoT framework, according to design views of data resilience, data security,
    data heterogeneity, data trust, data processing, and data fusion. The TW-IoT provides
    methods and mechanisms that satisfy data trustworthiness requirements, ensuring
    data flow continuity for mist and fog-based IoT systems. In this Section, we exemplify
    the TW-IoT framework data flow for our IoT stages. Our framework allows developers
    to choose the mechanisms to compose the data flow for each IoT stage. A. Thing
    Data Flow We designed a data flow for a microcontroller with sensors and actuators
    in the thing stage (Fig. 4). For the sensor’s data flow, a developer chooses to
    combine the framework mechanisms differently, using optional auto power on/off
    and data conversion mechanisms. In contrast, the packet encryption mechanism is
    obligatory for this data flow. Regarding actuators, the microcontroller receives
    a packet(s) and only needs to decrypt the packet payload to execute the system
    decision. FIGURE 4. Thing data flow. Show All The thing stage can use mechanisms
    to turn the radio on/off, convert the scale value, and calibrate the collected
    data. The auto power on/off mechanisms save the device battery, and calibration
    is responsible for converting the collected data in meaningful information into
    the same scale values. The framework also allows data encryption deployment to
    encapsulate data into packets and transmit them to the mist. Depending on the
    data transmission technology, the packets are in LoRa, Sigfox, or Zigbee format.
    B. Mist Data Flow The mist stage uses mechanisms to deal with communication technology
    heterogeneity, data flow persistence, data encryption and decryption, data homogeneity,
    data value and veracity, data analytics, and data filtering techniques (Fig. 5).
    FIGURE 5. Mist data flow. Show All The packets that arrive in the mist have different
    message formats, such as LoRa, Sigfox, or Zigbee format. Then, in the mist stage,
    the communication technology homogeneity mechanism is responsible for identifying
    the packet format and convert it into a single format. After handling packet heterogeneity,
    mist uses the data flow persistence mechanism to store data, avoiding data loss
    even if the fog stage is disconnected. A mist node can send packets to other mist
    nodes to maintain the data redundancy, avoiding data loss if a mist node fails.
    Supposing the mist hardware resources (CPU and memory) are close to reaching the
    capacity limit, mist redirects part of the stored packets to another mist node.
    When the IoT system is in normal operating conditions with an active connection
    between mist and fog, the mist node sends packets to fog by the data flow (A).
    When the fog connection is not active, the mist can choose two other paths, the
    first path (B) can compress data, and the second path (C) can analyze and filter
    data. Being the choice of data flows (B or C) a design option. Assuming the data
    flow follows path B (Fig. 5), the mist filter mechanism compresses the packet
    content, generating a file as output. Then, the mist awaits the fog connection
    returns to sends the file. In this case, the mist does not need to decrypt the
    data, making the data flow more secure against attacks. In case of interception,
    the file only has compressed encrypted packets. However, when a fog node receives
    this file, it needs to uncompressing the data, causing an additional computational
    cost to the fog stage. Assuming the data flow follows path C, the IoT system chooses
    to follow through the data filter, the data analysis, or both mechanisms but first
    following by packet payload decryption. Whether the system is handling LoRa packets,
    it uses LoRaWAN Network Server as ChirpStack [151] to decrypt each packet payload.
    After decryption, the IoT system converts data according to the data type and
    format. It checks the data’s veracity and value and can follow two paths: data
    analysis or data filtering. In data analysis, mist uses an analytic data model
    to make a decision. Data filtering occurs through two approaches (i) data compression
    and (ii) data fusion. Additionally, data fusion can use redundant data filtering
    based on statistical sampling or data characteristics. The choice of data filtering
    approaches and techniques is a design option. In our data path, the mist analyzes
    the data and sends decisions to actuators until the fog connection returns. The
    mist also filters data during a disconnection. If the connection returns, the
    system encrypts the filtered data and sends it to fog. Consequently, when new
    packets arrive at the mist, the older packets do not delay the mist node to send
    new packets to fog. Then, the system data flow continues to operate uninterruptedly.
    C. Fog Data Flow The mist (Fig. 5) sends filtered data or raw data to fog (Fig.
    6). Supposing the fog receives raw data from the mist. In that case, fog needs
    to handle this raw data by mechanisms like data homogeneity, data value, and data
    veracity. Consequently, the fog stage must have the same mechanisms deployed in
    the mist stage. FIGURE 6. Fog data flow. Show All The mist stage transfers packets
    with raw data or filtered data to the fog stage. When the packets contain raw
    data, the fog needs to filter and handle data similarly to the mist, but with
    some differences, passing by more mechanisms through the data path. In the data
    flow persistence mechanism, a fog node sends the data to other fog nodes to deal
    with redundancy and load balancing. Also, the fog node checks its cloud connection
    and the cloud transmission delay. Supposing the IoT system tolerates the cloud
    data transfer delay and that the communication channel between fog and cloud is
    active, the fog node transmits the data directly to the cloud. However, this delay
    is not acceptable for many IoT systems. In various smart applications, the IoT
    system must analyze data in real-time. In these situations, the fog node needs
    to analyze and filter data instead of the cloud. Upon receiving data, the fog
    node decrypts the packet payload, which can follow alternative paths: (i) if a
    packet contains filtered data, the fog node process it to make a decision, but
    (ii) if fog receives raw data, the flow passes through the data homogeneity step,
    i.e., through value mechanism (Section VI.C.1) and veracity mechanism (Section
    VI.C.2), and later on through the entity veracity mechanism (Fig. 6). The entity
    veracity mechanism (Section VI.C.3) checks the entity ID, battery level, packet
    latency, outliers, and possible manipulated data to estimate if the packet comes
    from a trusted or untrusted entity. Assuming the fog node detects an untrusted
    packet, the fog node discards the packet. It can also discard all packets from
    that entity in the future. However, if the entity is trusted, fog stores the data.
    After these steps, the fog node can use the data prediction mechanism to fill
    missing data in times series if necessary. The data flow takes two simultaneous
    paths in a row: (i) via data filtering, sending filtered data over the cloud,
    and (ii) via data analysis mechanism, where fog chooses an analytic model to analyze
    data and make decisions. Finally, the fog sends decisions to actuators. D. Cloud
    Data Flow Cloud (Fig. 7) decrypts the packet’s payload to verify whether the fog
    filtered the data. If data is not filtered, the cloud follows data homogeneity,
    value, veracity, and prediction steps. Also, the cloud selects application analytic
    models before the data analysis. After processing the data analysis mechanism,
    the cloud sends data and decisions to the user IoT application, the system actuators,
    and the integration of smart everything service (Fig. 7), responsible for transmitting
    relevant data and decisions between services in different smart services (Fig.
    8). FIGURE 7. Cloud data flow. Show All FIGURE 8. Cloud service integration data
    flow. Show All The cloud data flow includes an integration service for interconnecting
    different smart services, like a smart home, smart hospital (health care), and
    a smart mobility service (Fig. 8). In general, each service includes different
    smart applications. A smart farming service, for example, covers precision irrigation
    and pest control applications but not monitoring patient heartbeat, which is an
    application for smart hospital service. In Section VI.E.6, we mentioned the integration
    of the smart everything mechanism (Fig. 8). We discussed that a smart home service
    reports a domestic accident to a smart hospital service. Through a smart mobility
    service, the hospital verifies the best route for an ambulance to rescue the person
    who suffered the accident. This integration mechanism contains a module called
    Link Module (Fig. 8), which receives data from every smart service in the system
    and only sends part of it to virtual sensors. It means that a smart service only
    receives data related to its smart applications through the virtual sensor. The
    integration flow works in 3 steps: (i) cloud sends each smart service’s data (and
    decisions) in the IoT system to the Link Module, (ii) this module sends only relevant
    data for each virtual sensor, and (iii) the virtual sensors send data to the smart
    services. Therefore, each smart service receives data from other smart services
    through a virtual sensor (Fig. 8). Virtual sensors may send non-relevant data
    to a smart service. However, the TW-IoT framework can use the data value step
    to verify the data relevance for a specific smart service (Fig. 3 and Fig. 7).
    SECTION VIII. Trade-Offs Between Mist and Fog Data Flow The TW-IoT framework mechanisms
    provide data trustworthiness in a mist-fog-based IoT system. Still, the IoT designers
    need to consider some trade-offs through the data flow in different IoT stages.
    The mist and fog data flow needs to consider, for example, computing costs for
    mechanisms related to data security and data filtering techniques. A. Data Security
    and Data Filtering in Mist Stage Supposing the connection between mist and fog
    fails, the mist can follow two distinct flows (B or C): decrypt the packet payload
    and compress the encrypted packet content (Fig. 5). Filtering by data fusion requires
    decrypting data in the mist. However, decryption makes data more susceptible to
    malicious attackers. An attacker can capture the decrypted data from the mist
    or discover the method used to encrypt data again in the mist. However, by using
    data filtering by data compression, the mist keeps the data encrypted without
    additional security service and does not expose data to external attackers. It
    has a cost for unpacking data in the next IoT stage and possibly a cost for data
    traffic latency between mist and fog. B. Advantages and Disadvantages of Data
    Filtering Mechanisms There are advantages and disadvantages to different data
    filtering mechanisms. The mist and fog filtering methods are (i) fusion filtering
    by statistical sampling, which deals with redundant data, (ii) fusion filtering
    by data classification, and (iii) filtering by data compression. The filtering
    redundant data method reduces the data to a sample of data by statistical sampling.
    It means that IoT stages can reduce the amount of data, storage costs, and massive
    data traffic. However, it may cause data details loss and induces the IoT system
    to non-accurate decisions. Filtering by data classification can categorize data
    by machine learning techniques and only transmits each category number to the
    next IoT stage [148]. It ensures a more significant reduction in the amount of
    data than the filtering redundant data method. The categories found by the classification
    should be strictly faithful to the analytic data model for the analysis. This
    method may lead to wrong decisions. Through this filtering, the loss of details
    is even more significant. In data compression filtering, the original data remains
    intact, preventing possible equivocate system decisions. However, there is a higher
    cost for storing data, a network delay cost by sending the compressed file, and
    a computational cost to uncompressing the data in the next IoT stage. C. Data
    Analysis and CPU Usage in the Mist Stage Mist devices have low computational power,
    but data analysis demands high CPU resources depending on the algorithm or data
    model. Performing data analysis in the mist stage is a design option. However,
    a long disconnection between the mist and fog stages can cause the system to wait
    a long time without analyzing and making decisions. It compromises the system’s
    trustworthiness. It is essential to emphasize that data analysis in the mist must
    happen during a network disconnection, but using light algorithms for demanding
    less processing resources. However, using light algorithms for data analysis may
    generate untrusted decisions. The IoT designer must balance the data analysis
    complexity power and the CPU usage, maintaining the decisions’ accuracy. D. Data
    Prediction and CPU Usage in Fog Stage The data prediction techniques generally
    use regression algorithms that demand high CPU usage. Therefore, the choice of
    prediction technique should consider the fog nodes’ CPU processing power. E. Storage
    Time in IoT Stages The IoT system deals with continuous and uninterrupted data
    flow from billions of sensors. However, the mist and fog nodes have constrained
    memory capacity. The mist and fog nodes need to keep the data (received by sensors)
    because they need to analyze data and maintain the data flow persistence. The
    TW-IoT framework allows the IoT stages to store 3 data categories: raw data, refined
    data, and filtered data. According to the application, the IoT designers need
    to decide the memory usage percentage for each of these data categories and how
    long they remain stored in memory. They need to resolve it without compromising
    the data trustworthiness and future decisions. SECTION IX. Challenges This section
    presents some challenges of data trustworthiness in a fog-based IoT system, identified
    throughout this paper. A. Connection Redundancy The IoT may use different communication
    technologies with diverse packet formats and specificities. Some systems deploy
    IoT nodes with two or more communication protocols [92]. A monitoring mechanism
    can prevent disconnections and low network performance by automatically switching
    the IoT node connection technology. In this way, each IoT node receives and transmits
    data over more than one communication protocol. A node can select a communication
    protocol with better network performance to transfer data. It is a challenge to
    deploy, in a real scenario, billions of sensors with connection redundancy mechanisms
    without increase the hardware costs. B. Data Filter by Data Knowledge Fog data
    reduction (filtering) aims to reduce the amount of data stored and transmitted
    by the mist and fog stages. These techniques can discard redundant data or data
    with no relevant variations [48], [147]. However, the fog needs to consider the
    analytic data model and the smart application for data filtering because the filtered
    data will represent the original data and generate trusted decisions [147]. A
    relevant challenge is to create a mechanism that precisely and accurately filters
    data without previously knowing the analytic data model or application context.
    In other words, the challenge is to design a context-independent data filtering
    mechanism only based on the data. C. Agile Fault-Recovery A fog-based latency-sensitive
    IoT system needs to execute fault recovery near real-time since the fog must provide
    data analysis in real-time. The velocity of fault recovery may impact system availability
    (Equation 1). It is challenging to offer mechanisms that recover the system of
    failures in real-time. Agility in fault recovery is a challenge. D. Automatic
    Registration of Devices Secure IoT platforms require registering devices (including
    sensors) on the mist/fog servers. It allows the IoT system to recognize devices
    as trust devices and enhance the system trustworthiness. In a real scenario, the
    IoT system has to register billions of devices. In an ideal scenario, a developer
    simply needs to connect new sensors to the network, and the system automatically
    recognizes them. However, new devices without a previous system notification may
    bring security risks since they can attack the IoT system. Therefore, it is challenging
    to create secure mechanisms that automatically register new devices to the fog
    node. E. Real-Time Analysis and Mist/Fog Resource Constrains Ensuring data trustworthiness
    in a fog-based IoT system means deploying mist and fog nodes responsible for mechanisms
    that support heterogeneity, resilience, data trust, data filtering, security,
    and data analysis for billions of sensors. However, these features in the mist/fog
    nodes need to deal with constrained memory capacity and CPU power. It is challenging
    to find a balance between these mechanisms’ computational costs and the mist/fog
    resource constraints. Another challenge is maintaining these mechanisms without
    changing the data analysis velocity, especially real-time data analysis. SECTION
    X. Conclusion and Future Work Trustworthiness (dependability) handles requirements
    and characteristics that provide system availability, reliability, scalability,
    maintainability, heterogeneity, data quality, hardware resources, security, response
    time agility, and network resilience to computer systems. This survey presents
    state-of-the-art concepts about trustworthiness in fog-based IoT systems, summarizing
    and discussing literature. We identified data trustworthiness gaps in dealing
    with the fog computing data flow. For that reason, we proposed the TW-IoT framework
    to ensure data trustworthiness for mist-fog-based IoT systems. The TW-IoT framework
    deploys mechanisms for a mist-fog-based IoT system to ensure trusted decisions
    and keep the data flow’s uninterrupted continuity through all IoT system stages.
    Also, we identify data trustworthiness trade-offs and challenges for fog-based
    IoT systems. As future work, we will evaluate the impact of each design view and
    mechanism of the TW-IoT framework for a real mist-fog-based IoT system, using
    pilots of the SWAMP project [6]. We intend to evaluate CPU and RAM usage for each
    IoT stage using our framework mechanisms. We aim to assess the data filtering
    mechanism combined with the data resilience view through the packet loss rate
    and network delay between IoT stages (thing, mist, fog, and cloud) in situations
    of network availability and unavailability. We plan to assess devices’ energy
    consumption and end-to-end network delay, varying distinct data formats for various
    packet technologies types (using synthetic and real data) to evaluate the data
    veracity, value, and homogeneity mechanisms. We will also analyze the data processing
    view changing the communication channel frequency, channel error, number of sensors,
    and the packet transmission rate. Finally, we will evaluate the security view
    measuring energy, processing, and memory usage of different security algorithms,
    combining them with mechanisms of data resilience, data trust, and heterogeneity

  explanation: 'The study focuses on the design and implementation of real-time automated
    irrigation systems in agricultural settings. The authors propose an innovative
    architecture and protocol for seamless integration of ML-generated insights with
    IoT-enabled irrigation control systems, leveraging both MQTT and CoAP for lightweight
    and reliable communication.


    In this approach, sensor data is collected and transmitted wirelessly to a central
    node, where it is processed and analyzed using ML algorithms. The ML models derive
    actionable irrigation insights, which are then communicated to the user via a
    handheld device or cloud-based platform. The authors validate their approach through
    a customized hardware prototype and a comprehensive dataset of real-time sensor
    data.


    Accuracy and efficiency are key considerations in evaluating the relevance and
    effectiveness of the study. The proposed architecture and protocols are designed
    to minimize data loss, ensure reliable communication, and optimize the accuracy
    of ML models. The accuracy of the ML models is crucial for generating meaningful
    irrigation insights, which directly impacts the efficiency and effectiveness of
    the irrigation system.


    The study contributes to the existing body of knowledge by providing a novel solution
    for integrating ML-generated insights into real-time irrigation systems. The integration
    of IoT and ML technologies enables the system to analyze sensor data in real time,
    make informed decisions, and automate irrigation processes. This approach has
    the potential to improve crop yields, reduce water consumption, and enhance agricultural
    sustainability.'

    \ smart monitoring with intelligence highly gained signiﬁcant attention for enhancing\
    \ the productivity of the crop.\nCurrently, IoT generates a lot of real-time data\
    \ from the sensors, actuators, and identiﬁcation technologies. However,\nextracting\
    \ the meaningful insights from the data is necessary for realizing the intelligent\
    \ ecosystem in agriculture. Based upon\nthe previous studies, it is also identiﬁed\
    \ that the limited studies have merely implemented machine learning (ML) on real-time\n\

    \ survival, as it is the main\nsource of grain and other basic resources. In addition,\
    \ agricul-\nture accounts for about 4% of the world’s gross national prod-\nuct\
    \ (GDP) [1]. Urbanization and population growth in 2050\nconclude that food production\
    \ must be sustainably doubled\nwith minimal water resources [2]. About 97% of\
    \ the water\non the planet is salty, while the remaining 3 is freshwater [3].\n\
    Agriculture uses 70% of freshwater for irrigation in most\ndeveloping countries\
    \ [4]. Therefore, the eﬃcient use of fresh-\nwater during irrigation is the most\
    \ signiﬁcant issue in terms\nof cost reduction and yield improvement. Using the\
    \ traditional\nmethod, farmers manually check and regulate the availability\n\
    of water resulting in a 50% water loss [5]. However, diﬀerent\nirrigation techniques\
    \ like drip irrigation, sprinkle irrigation,\nand furrow irrigation have minimized\
    \ water wastage by 30-\n70% [6]. Yet, the optimal management of water content\
    \ in\nthe soil is not yet achieved with these irrigation techniques\nas overwater\
    \ usage in the agricultural ﬁeld leads to an overﬂow\nof nutrients from the soil\
    \ [7].\nAgriculture also requires adequate levels of fertilizers\nand pesticides,\
    \ as farmers use fertilizers and pesticides while\nneglecting the optimal needs\
    \ of the crop. Apart from that,\nwater availability, nutrient levels, and soil\
    \ moisture are some\nother factors that aﬀect crop productivity as well. With\
    \ the\ntraditional approach, it is a challenging task for the farmer\nto determine\
    \ water availability, nutrient levels, and soil\nHindawi\nJournal of Sensors\n\

    moisture and also to identify which factor is ﬁghting food pro-\nduction [8].\
    \ Here, smart and real-time systems help to moni-\ntor the various parameters\
    \ of the agricultural ﬁeld and\neﬀectively control the water level with other\
    \ resources to\nincrease productivity [9]. Nowadays, real-time monitoring\nand\
    \ intelligent systems are possible with the Internet of Things\n(IoT), as IoT\
    \ monitors agriculture with IoT-enabled sensors\nand communication protocols implemented\
    \ in agriculture\n[10]. The above facts conclude that the IoT has played crucial\n\
    role in multiple areas including agriculture with its sensing,\ncommunication,\
    \ and real-time monitoring features through\nthe IoT hardware. Moreover, it is\
    \ concluded from the previous\nstudies that the ML model delivered signiﬁcant\
    \ results on real-\ntime data [11]. The study framed a research question “How\n\
    and for what purpose may the ML technology be used in agri-\nculture on IoT real-time\
    \ data? On the basis of this research\nquestion, this study has carried out the\
    \ literature review.\n1.1. Literature Review. Large-scale agricultural monitoring\n\
    applications require reliable WSN networks because the maxi-\nmum number of sensors\
    \ is operated over a long period. A wire-\nless sensor network architecture for\
    \ vegetable greenhouses is\npresented to achieve scientiﬁc cultivation and minimize\
    \ man-\nagement eﬀort from an environmental monitoring perspective\n[12]. Smart\
    \ greenhouse management systems and WSNs are\nused to control and monitor agricultural\
    \ parameters and activ-\nities in greenhouses autonomously [13, 14]. A smart green-\n\
    house information monitoring system records environmental\nfactors with ZigBee\
    \ wireless sensors [15].Wi-Fi-based smart\nWSN has been proposed to monitor the\
    \ agricultural environ-\nment, and the system allows intelligent monitoring of\
    \ agricul-\ntural conditions [16, 17]. WSN’s eﬀorts recommend that\nsensor data\
    \ can be collected and sent to the main server [18].\nA WPAN-based water quality\
    \ monitoring system has been\nproposed to clean up and collect real-time sensor\
    \ data on agri-\ncultural land with the LabVIEW data logger [19]. In addition\
    \ to\nWSN, the advent of IoT technology has enabled farmers and\ntechnologists\
    \ to solve the challenges farmers face, such as water\nshortages, cost control,\
    \ and productivity issues [20].\nA scalable IoT and WSN architecture is proposed\
    \ for\nremote monitoring and control of agriculture [21]. For the\nsame, an energy-saving\
    \ ZigBee sensor network with bidirec-\ntional communication and end devices is\
    \ integrated to\ndeliver data from the sensors to the PC at variable times\ndetermined\
    \ by the central node [22]. SiloSense is a unique\narchitecture based on ZigBee\
    \ to monitor the storage condi-\ntions of grain silos to protect them from spoilage\
    \ and disease\n[23]. The most important parameters that are required to\nmonitor\
    \ while growing wheat and other vegetables are soil\nmoisture, ambient temperature,\
    \ air pressure, and sunlight\nintensity [24]. mIoT- and WSN-based agricultural\
    \ system\nare for monitoring air, temperature, soil moisture, and\nhumidity with\
    \ RF modules [25]. The cloud-based and IoT-\nbased smart irrigation system is\
    \ designed to obtain data on\nsoil moisture, soil health, and temperature to reduce\
    \ water\nconsumption [26, 27]. IoT-based greenhouse agriculture is\nimplemented\
    \ to monitor climatic conditions and to obtain\ndata on a cloud server for analysis,\
    \ while the ZigBee protocol\nand the Wi-Fi module are integrated [28, 29]. The\
    \ IoT-based\nframework is designed to perform data analysis using real-\ntime\
    \ data to increase productivity on farms through temper-\nature, soil moisture,\
    \ and humidity sensor [30, 31].\nIoT-enabled plant disease and pest prediction\
    \ system is\nimplemented to reduce the use of insecticides and fungicides,\nand\
    \ additionally, an assessment of meteorological data is also\ncarried out to identify\
    \ the correlation between pest growth\nand climate [32]. ML helps to examine and\
    \ analyze data from\ndiﬀerent ﬁelds of agriculture to improve crop yields and\
    \ oﬀers\ndiﬀerent analytical techniques to predict the yield of crop and\nplant\
    \ disease [33, 34]. The ML-based predictive model helps\nfarmers to get the right\
    \ harvest with unconditional weather\nbehavior [35]. ML algorithms such as neural\
    \ network-based\nmodels are used for predictive analysis purposes [36]. From\n\
    the literature review, it is identiﬁed that smart monitoring in\nthe agricultural\
    \ ﬁeld needs to carry out with advanced technol-\nogies such as IoT. The literature\
    \ also concludes that they are\nlimited studies that analyzed the accuracy of\
    \ the data obtained\nthrough sensors. In addition to this, customization of hard-\n\
    ware on the basis of agricultural ﬁeld requirement is limitedly\nexplored by the\
    \ previous researchers. ML technique is applied\non diﬀerent datasets for disease\
    \ detection, environmental\nparameters monitoring, and automation in irrigation,\
    \ but the\nprevious studies have yet to explore the crop recommendation\non the\
    \ basis of real-time data. However, implementing ML on\nreal-time data primarily\
    \ requires a resource-constrained and\ndedicated server to fulﬁll the task of\
    \ acquiring real-time agri-\ncultural data rather than using it for multiple purposes.\n\
    To overcome this research, the gap of this study imple-\nments customized IoT\
    \ hardware for obtaining the real-time\nﬁeld data through wireless personal area\
    \ network (WPAN)\nand wireless local area network (WLAN). WPAN enables to\nminimize\
    \ the power consumption and also transmits the sen-\nsor data reliably and securely.\
    \ WLAN is used to connect the\ncustomized hardware to the cloud server through\
    \ IP protocol.\nTo maintain accuracy in the data, the calibration methods are\n\
    applied on the sensors. It is also identiﬁed from the previous\nstudy that IoT\
    \ requires analytical techniques to provide intel-\nligent decisions based on\
    \ real-time sensor data obtained from\nIoT sensors [11]. The contributions of\
    \ the study are as follows:\n(i) Customized hardware for sensor node, master node,\n\
    and hand-held device with ZigBee RF modem is\ndesigned for sensing the real-time\
    \ data of agricul-\ntural ﬁeld including temperature, humidity, soil\npH, and\
    \ water level\n(ii) An interference test is implemented to verify that\nthe ZigBee\
    \ signal is not interfering with other\nsignals on the same frequency band\n(iii)\
    \ To enhance the security of data transmission, the\nsymmetric encryption approach\
    \ with a private key\nis applied by leveraging XXTea encryption functions\n(iv)\
    \ A cloud server is developed to log the real-time sen-\nsor data of the agricultural\
    \ ﬁeld\n(v) The pretrained machine learning model is applied\nto real-time data\
    \ such as temperature, humidity,\n2\nJournal of Sensors\nrainfall, and soil pH\
    \ sensor on the cloud server for\nseasonal crop recommendations\nThe organization\
    \ of the study is as follows: Section 1.1\ncovers the proposed system. Section\
    \ 2 covers the circuit dia-\ngram for the development of the system. Section 3\
    \ covers\nsimulation analysis and calibration. Section 4 covers the\nreal-time\
    \ implementation of developed nodes and the cur-\nrent consumption analysis. The\
    \ article is concluded in the\nﬁnal section.\n2. Proposed Architecture\nTo realize\
    \ the main objective of crop recommendation, in\nreal-time, machine learning is\
    \ utilized. This system intends\nto leverage multiple sensors with real-time data\
    \ collection\nsuch as temperature, humidity, rainfall, and soil pH sensor\nto\
    \ improve the eﬃciency and the recommendation of crops,\nwith the support of machine\
    \ learning techniques. As shown\nin Figure 1, the architecture is divided into\
    \ multiple mod-\nules, with both software and hardware parts, each with its\n\
    purpose, from the hardware nodes, for data collection; the\nserver, for data processing;\
    \ and ﬁnally, the hand-held device\nto the user.\nThe system is composed of various\
    \ environmental sen-\nsors that are deployed around the agricultural ﬁeld to collect\n\
    data on a variety of characteristics such as water level, tem-\nperature, soil\
    \ pH, and humidity. This information is then\nsent to the master node, the main\
    \ hub of our system, which\nis in charge of communicating with the developed cloud\n\
    server and transferring the data obtained from the sensors.\nIn the server, the\
    \ information is stored and is also run\nthrough the ML algorithm to be studied.\
    \ From there, based\non the algorithm’s analysis, the information is presented\
    \ to\nthe user on a handheld device, such as crop recommenda-\ntion. The crop\
    \ recommendation feature is activated from\nthe hand-held device, and recommendations\
    \ are received\non the hand-held device based on the user’s request.\n2.1. Data\
    \ Acquisition Layer. The data acquisition layer is the\nprimary layer of the architecture\
    \ for acquiring the environ-\nmental parameters of the agricultural ﬁeld. This\
    \ layer is specif-\nically dedicated to continuously monitor the environmental\n\
    parameters including water level, temperature, humidity, light\nintensity, and\
    \ rain level. For this, IoT sensors are attached to\nthe sensor node as shown\
    \ in Figure 2 and through 2.4GHz\nZigBee communication [37], it transmits data\
    \ to the master\nnode. In addition, the sensor node is enabled with security,\n\
    interference technique, and node mapping feature for secure\nand reliable communication.\n\
    2.2. Data Processing Layer. IoT devices and sensors record\nthe environmental\
    \ parameters of the agricultural ﬁeld in real\ntime. Sensory data processing is\
    \ done with the data process-\ning layer. The master node, which consists of the\
    \ ZigBee RF\nmodule, receives the data from the data acquisition layer and\ntransmits\
    \ it to the cloud server via a Wi-Fi module\n(Figure 3). The master node is powered\
    \ by the battery power\nsupply. The data logger is also available in the data\
    \ process-\ning layer for visualizing the sensor data through Bluetooth.\nThe\
    \ master node with a Wi-Fi module connects to the Inter-\nnet to log the sensory\
    \ data in the cloud server.\n2.3. Analytics and Visualization Layer. Figure 4\
    \ illustrates the\nsystem logic, where it explains the preprocessing and analysis\n\
    of gathered data from the sensor node. The sensor data is\nreceived at the master\
    \ node which is converted into a set of\nscripts and is logged into the cloud\
    \ server. Here, a cloud server\nis also developed to log the sensor node values.\
    \ In the prepro-\ncessing step, the sensor data is converted into a suitable format\n\
    for performing machine learning analyses. The data is fed to a\nmachine learning\
    \ model and based on the data the model, it\nsuggests recommended crop. The outcome\
    \ of the model is\nstored in the cloud server, and the hand-held device that con-\n\
    nects to the cloud server also visualizes the recommended crop\nand real-time\
    \ sensor data. To provide the user with a way to\nsee the data collected from\
    \ the sensors and machine learning\noutcomes, a cloud server is developed.\nA\
    \ cloud server is developed with two diﬀerent API pro-\ntocols for data exchange\
    \ between backend and frontend\nand backend and custom gateway. The interface\
    \ between\nthe backend and the frontend for the exchange of data is\nimplemented\
    \ with the REST API. REST APIs use HTTP\nrequests to perform basic database activities\
    \ within a\nresource, such as creating, reading, updating, and deleting\nrecords.\
    \ REST APIs accept JSON for the request payload\nand send responses to JSON. JSON\
    \ is the standard for data\ntransfer. The interface between the backend and the\
    \ gateway\nis implemented using the MQTT protocol. The cloud server\nassists in\
    \ checking all the sensor values retrieved from the\nagricultural ﬁeld in real\
    \ time. Moreover, a hand-held device\nis connected to the cloud server for providing\
    \ the updates of\nthe crop based on request generated by the user.\n3. Hardware\
    \ Development\nIn this section, we present the schematic diagram of the sen-\n\
    sor node that is primarily implemented for data acquisition.\nMoreover, the customization\
    \ is carried out for the hardware\nof agricultural monitoring including data logger\
    \ and hand-\nheld device. A detailed description of the sensor node and\nthe hand-held\
    \ device is presented below.\n3.1. Sensor Node. Figure 5 illustrates the connection\
    \ of diﬀer-\nent electronic components of the sensor node. The node is\ncomposed\
    \ of a 2.4 GHz RF modem that works in full-\nduplex mode to transmit the data\
    \ from one node to another\nconnected in the network. Principally, two sensors\
    \ (gas\nsensor and humidity sensor) are connected to the node\nwhich are placed\
    \ in the ﬁeld. The function of the gas sensor\nis to measure the concentration\
    \ of the gas (such as LPG and\nbutane) in the present environment. The humidity\
    \ of the\nenvironment is detected with the help of a humidity sensor.\nThe humidity\
    \ sensor gives serial data at the 9600 baud rate\nto the microcontroller. The\
    \ output of these sensors is in\nanalog form. Analog signal from the sensor is\
    \ fed onto the\nanalog to digital pin of the ATMEGA 8 [38].\nThe function of this\
    \ pin is to convert the analog signal\ninto a digital signal. After fetching the\
    \ signal from a sensor\n3\nJournal of Sensors\nattached, the microcontroller performs\
    \ the logical operation\nand controls the overall operation. A display (16∗2 LCD)\
    \ is\nattached to each node. The function of this is to display\nthe measured\
    \ parameters. MAX 232 IC is also used to pro-\nvide communication between the\
    \ node and PC. With the\nhelp of this, the end-user can easily observe the parameters\n\
    and execute the needful action. The whole circuit is working\non the 5 V power\
    \ supply. The RF module is attached to the\nSensor\nnode ‘1’\nMaster\nnode\nData\n\

    \ A Zig-\nBee module (CC2500) [37] is used in the system to provide\nwireless\
    \ communication in the network. This module works\nin full-duplex mode and also\
    \ can communicate with many\ndevices at the same time. The topology of each node\
    \ in the\npresented network is based on mesh topology. All the\nrequired components\
    \ are integrated and developed hard-\nware of the sensor node as shown in the\
    \ Figure 6. The sensor\nnode is integrated with LCD to visualize the sensor values.\n\
    3.2. Hand-Held Device. Figure 7 shows the circuit diagram of\na hand-held device\
    \ that consists of a Bluetooth modem. The\nmain function of this modem is to receive\
    \ the data trans-\nferred from the data logger node. This node is at the end-\n\
    user and easily provides the collected data to the end-user.\nThis node is connected\
    \ with other nodes in a mesh topology.\nA display is used for showing the measured\
    \ data. Based on\nthis data, end-user can easily take the decision. Figure 8 illus-\n\
    trates the hardware of the hand-held device, and the hand-\nheld device is also\
    \ integrated with display to visualize the\ndata like real-time sensor value and\
    \ crop recommendation.\n3.2.1. Current Consumption Analysis of Hardware. Current\n\
    consumption analysis is performed based on the current\nrequired by each component\
    \ used to develop the system.\nThe power consumption by the ZigBee RF modem is\
    \ maxi-\nmum for each node, followed by consumption by the micro-\ncontroller.\
    \ Even though power was not a design issue for the\nsystem, it is evident that\
    \ the designed system requires less\npower than standard available devices like\
    \ Mica2 and Micaz\nnodes. The current consumption analysis concludes that the\n\
    designed hardware is consuming less amount of power during\nthe data transmission.\
    \ Speciﬁcally, the hand-held device is\nonly consuming a current of 79mA. The\
    \ current consumption\nmay vary when the components in the hardware are increased.\n\
    From Table 1, it is concluded that the power consumption of\nnode 1 is 85mA, node\
    \ 2 is 85mA, node 3 is 264mA, node 4\nis 104mA, and node 5 is 83mA. To meet the\
    \ power require-\nment of the sensor node, an energy harvesting system will be\n\
    integrated into the sensor node in the future. In agriculture,\nsolar panels will\
    \ be used to implement solar energy harvesting\nsystems on sensor nodes. Table\
    \ 2 shows the current consump-\ntion of the hand-held device, and it is 79mA.\
    \ The power to the\nhand-held device is achieved with the battery.\nATMEGA 32\n\

    \ sensor calibration\nis performed to set the sensor to operate accurately and\n\
    without error. This section describes the sensor calibrations\n(temperature/humidity,\
    \ soil moisture, and ultrasonic) used\nto develop the system. Sensor calibration\
    \ is an important\nstep, before the actual implementation of the sensor in the\n\
    system. For the developed system, each sensor is ﬁrst cali-\nbrated with standard\
    \ instruments and after checking its\naccuracy, sensors are used in the system.\

    \ used. The\nultrasonic sensor is calibrated with a standard measurement\nruler.\
    \ Tests were carried out for each sensor and compared\nwith standard instruments,\
    \ and it was observed that the sen-\nsors were calibrated appropriately as follows.\n\
    3.3.1. Soil Moisture Sensor. The soil moisture sensor is taken\nfrom the Sunrom\
    \ model (http://sunrom.com/) no. 1282\n[39]. The sensor gives a reading in terms\
    \ of numerical\nvalues, as can be seen in Table 3. This sensor measures mois-\n\
    ture based on the volumetric water content in the soil. On\nthe other hand, the\
    \ standard oven method for ﬁnding soil\nmoisture gives a reading in percentage.\
    \ Initially, the sensor\nreadings are mapped by the oven method [40] to check\
    \ the\nerror between the sensor value and instrument value.\nFigure 9 shows the\
    \ relation between soil moisture content\nshown by the sensor and by standard\
    \ instrument. It provides\ncalibration values of the sensor concerning the percentage\n\
    value of the oven method. To validate the calibration,\nrepeated experiments were\
    \ conducted by taking soil samples\nfrom ﬁve diﬀerent places with valid water\
    \ content and cali-\nbrated them with the standard instruments. Table 4 shows\n\
    the sample readings by soil moisture content (%) with sensor\nvalues. The sensor\
    \ reading from the sensor is received by an\nanalog-to-digital converter (ADC)\
    \ and converted to a %\nvalue using equation (1). If the ADC value of the sensor\
    \ is\n255, then the value is considered 100% accurate concerning\nthe standard\
    \ oven method.\nSoil moisture %\nð Þ = wet soil g\nð Þ‐dry soil g\nð Þ\nð\nÞ ∗\n\

    \ used as per the calculation given\nin [43].\n3.4. Security and Interference\
    \ Test\n3.4.1. Security. As part of the security feature, during the\nimplementation\
    \ stage, we employ the AVR family of micro-\ncontrollers for applications comparable\
    \ to the one being\nproposed. Complex algorithms are a curse in AVR utilizing\n\
    time complex or memory because they frequently turn the\nexecuting code into a\
    \ blocking one, which means that any\nother routine to be conducted by the controller\
    \ is blocked\nand may create delays in executing the intended function.\nKeeping\
    \ these factors in mind, we should take considerable\nsensitivity while employing\
    \ cryptographic algorithms in\nthese low-bit controllers. Cryptographic functions\
    \ like\nXXTea and AVRCrypto can be used to implement the\nencryption method. In\
    \ our case, we use the XXTea encryp-\ntion functions to implement symmetric encryption\
    \ with pri-\nvate keys that remain exclusive to another layer of network\nnodes\
    \ to increase the security of data communication.\n3.4.2. Interference. The basic\
    \ parameter for detecting and\nhandling interference includes bit error rate (BER),\
    \ packet\nerror rate (PER), received signal strength indicator (RSSI),\nsignal-to-interference-to-noise\
    \ ratio (SINR), throughput,\nand time delay. In this study, we apply an interference\
    \ avoid-\nance algorithm based on frequency agility [39]. This algo-\nrithm allows\
    \ ZigBee to detect interference and ﬂexibly\nmove nodes to a secure channel with\
    \ minimal power con-\nsumption and minimal latency while handling the interfer-\n\
    ence. In this technique, the end devices measure PER with\na transmission time\
    \ of at least 20 packets, and if the PER\ngoes beyond the 25% level, the interference\
    \ information is\ntransferred to the parent router to assess the link quality\n\
    indicator (LQI). When the parent router determines that\nthe LQI value is less\
    \ than 100, it instructs the scanning\nenergy detection to perform interference\
    \ detection on acces-\nsible channels (ED).\nPER =\nNumber of failed messages\n\

    \ this study is that to\nchoose which algorithm is the best algorithm that can\
    \ be\nused not only in the system but in other situations with sim-\nilar data.\
    \ To do this, four diﬀerent classiﬁcation algorithms\nwere tested to see which\
    \ one had the highest accuracy.\n(a) Decision trees (DTs): through hierarchical\
    \ partition-\ning of training data, some functions are used to split\nthe data,\
    \ and this division is done iteratively until the\nleaf node contains the number\
    \ record amount that\ncan be used to classify data [44, 45]. However, as\n(a)\

    \ Creation. The complete hardware of the proposed\nsystem is shown in Figure 10(a).\
    \ Figure 10(b) illustrates the\nsensor node based on the 2.4 GHz ZigBee module\
    \ that is\nembedded with multiple sensors including water level, tem-\nperature,\
    \ humidity, pH, and light intensity. Moreover, the\nsensor node is interfaced\
    \ with a liquid crystal display for\nvisualizing the sensor data. In this study,\
    \ a custom sensor\nnode with IoT sensors is deployed in the agricultural sector\n\
    of the Maheru, Punjab region as shown in Figure 11. The\nsensor node is deployed\
    \ in an outdoor environment to get\ndata from the sensors in real time. As discussed\
    \ earlier in\nthis section, the sensor node is interfaced with multiple sen-\n\
    sors to detect the environmental parameters of the farm ﬁeld\nand communicate\
    \ with the cloud server through a master\nnode based on 2.4 GHz ZigBee communication\
    \ and wireless\nﬁdelity (Wi-Fi).\nThe input parameters of the sensor data are\
    \ temperature,\nhumidity, water level, and soil pH. The 32,000 samples of\nIoT\
    \ sensor nodes over 6 months are used to build a dataset\nfor training. The manual\
    \ data splitting methods have been\nadopted in which the total number of samples\
    \ is divided into\ntraining and testing samples. The 70: 30 ratio is chosen for\n\
    the proposed dataset, in which 70% for training and 30%\nfor testing as shown\
    \ in Table 7.\nDuring dataset generation, besides collected timestamps\nand sensor\
    \ data, other features were added to each record\nbased on calculations and preprocessed\
    \ data from the values\nof the sensor. Table 8 shows the features of each data\
    \ set.\nThe diﬀerence between datasets is that the standard one only\nhas one\
    \ entry for each of the features while the clustered one\nhas three entries for\
    \ sensorID, average, value, and diﬀ_sen,\neach one regarding the three sensors\
    \ used in the test.\n4.2. Model Analysis. A variety of ML algorithms were used\
    \ to\nanalyze the model to ﬁnd the best one to use in our system.\nFor our case,\
    \ we performed a total of 8 tests for each\nalgorithm, each with a diﬀerent set\
    \ of parameters, to train\nthe algorithms to determine which one has the highest\n\
    accuracy so that it can be applied in our system. Each test\nwas run using Python,\
    \ the scikit-learn library [37], and the\nSpyder platform. Scripts were developed\
    \ for each algo-\nrithm using the appropriate library for scikit-learn classiﬁ-\n\
    cation and used the default conﬁguration. As mentioned\nearlier, 70% of the dataset\
    \ was used for training, and\n30% was used for testing. Table 9 shows the results\
    \ of\neach test, and Figure 12 shows the same results to improve\nthe analysis.\n\

    crop, and blue color denotes the rice crop.\nBased on the temperature, humidity,\
    \ rain level, and soil\npH, the optimal crops are recommended. For example, in\n\
    the temperature plot, for the temperature range of 39°C-\n45°C, the recommended\
    \ crop is wheat. In case of humidity,\nthe minimum humidity level is recommended\
    \ for the wheat\ncrop. Rice crop is recommended for the rain level of 3 mm\nand\
    \ the pH value of 8, and the wheat crop is recommended.\nThe recommendation of\
    \ the crop is delivered on the basis of\ntrained data, and it may vary with other\
    \ location, as the\ndataset is developed through the real-time data of the study\n\
    location. In case, if the hardware needed to implement in\nother location, then\
    \ the customized hardware with IoT sen-\nsors needs to be developed for a certain\
    \ period of time for\nthe development of dataset.\nIn Figure 14, the crop recommendation\
    \ is processed\nbased on temperature, humidity, nutrients, and light inten-\n\
    sity. The x-axis denotes the number of the data samples,\nand y-axis denotes the\
    \ range of temperature, humidity,\nnutrients, and light intensity. In the temperature\
    \ plot, blue\ndenotes the green leaves, and violent color denotes tomatoes.\n\
    Based on the temperature, humidity, nutrients, and light\nintensity, the optimal\
    \ crops are recommended. In the tem-\nperature plot, for the temperature range\
    \ of 20°C-30°C, the\nrecommended crop is tomato. At the temperature of 35°C,\n\
    the plot concludes that green leaves and tomato crops are\nrecommended.\nIn case\
    \ of humidity, if the range of humidity level is\nbetween 60% and 70%, then both\
    \ crops including green\nleaves and tomato are recommended. The tomato crop is\n\
    recommended for the nutrients level in between 0 and 1%.\nIf the light intensity\
    \ is at 8 candelas, then tomato crop is\nhighly recommended. The hand-held device\
    \ based on the\ncloud server also receives the crop recommendation through\nthe\
    \ Internet based on demand. Table 10 presents the com-\nparison of smart agriculture\
    \ monitoring with previous stud-\nies. To validate the proposed study, the following\
    \ evaluation\nparameters are communication, data processing, analytics,\nsimulation,\
    \ calibration, and hand-held device. The proposed\nstudy oﬀers the advantages\
    \ of a communication protocol\nthat uses both 2.4 GHz ZigBee and Wi-Fi.\nThe integration\
    \ of these two-communication platforms\nenables to obtain the data locally and\
    \ also in the cloud. From\nthe table, it is concluded that the proposed study\
    \ is having\nbeneﬁcial in terms of providing the real-time data to the\nusers\
    \ on the hand-held device through stable and reliable\ncommunication. As seen\
    \ in the previous studies, many\nresearchers have implemented the advanced wireless\
    \ com-\nmunication technology like LoRa. The deployment of the\nLoRa-based sensor\
    \ nodes increases the infrastructure cost\nas compared to ZigBee-based sensor\
    \ nodes. However, LoRa\nand ZigBee can be utilized combinedly in the agricultural\n\
    ﬁeld monitoring in the following manner.\nZigBee-based sensor nodes can be deployed\
    \ in the agri-\ncultural ﬁeld to monitor environmental parameters, and\nthe single\
    \ LoRa-based node can act as supervisor node to\nall the ZigBee-based sensor nodes.\
    \ This LoRa-based node con-\nnects to the gateway, as LoRa can transmit the data\
    \ to a long\nrange. From there, the information of ZigBee-based sensor\nnode can\
    \ be visualized on the cloud server. This approach\ncan be implemented to enhance\
    \ the connectivity and minimize\ninfrastructure cost. This study have enhanced\
    \ the hardware\nwith node mapping feature, frequency agility interference\navoidance,\
    \ and XXTea encryption features. All these features\nare logged in the hardware\
    \ during the programming.\n6. Conclusions\nReal-time smart monitoring with intelligence\
    \ has gained sig-\nniﬁcant attention for increasing crop productivity. At the\n\
    moment, IoT generates a large amount of real-time data\nfrom sensors, actuators,\
    \ and identiﬁcation technologies.\nHowever, extracting meaningful insights from\
    \ data is\nrequired for the intelligent ecosystem and portable device\nfor monitoring\
    \ of agriculture. The current study is focused\non implementing the customized\
    \ hand-held device for\nassisting the farmers with crop recommendation with ML.\n\
    To realize it, ﬁrst, the customized hardware is designed,\nand sensors are calibrated\
    \ to obtain the error free data. In\naddition to this, security is also inbuilt\
    \ in the customized\nhardware for secure transmission of data on the cloud\nserver.\
    \ As the real-time data is available in the cloud server,\nit is utilized for\
    \ forming dataset to conclude to the optimal\nML model for crop recommendation.\
    \ After identifying the\noptimal ML model, it has been applied on the cloud server.\n\
    Based on this, the ML model recommends the crop from\nthe real-time data that\
    \ is generated from the customized\nhardware.\nData Availability\nData will be\

    \ \n \nAbstract: Crop irrigation uses more than 70% of the world’s water, and\
    \ thus, improving \nirrigation efficiency is decisive to sustain the food demand\
    \ from a fast-growing world \npopulation. This objective may be accomplished by\
    \ cultivating more water-efficient crop \nspecies and/or through the application\
    \ of efficient irrigation systems, which includes the \nimplementation of a suitable\
    \ method for precise scheduling. At the farm level, irrigation is \ngenerally\
    \ scheduled based on the grower’s experience or on the determination of soil water\
    \ \nbalance (weather-based method). An alternative approach entails the measurement\
    \ of soil \nwater status. Expensive and sophisticated root zone sensors (RZS),\
    \ such as neutron probes, \nare available for the use of soil and plant scientists,\
    \ while cheap and practical devices are \nneeded for irrigation management in\
    \ commercial crops. The paper illustrates the main \nfeatures of RZS’ (for both\

    \ \n \nAccording to FAO [1], nearly 40% of the world’s food is produced by irrigated\
    \ agriculture, which \ncovers about 250 million hectares (corresponding to 17%\
    \ of the total arable land) and is the major user \nof fresh water, accounting\
    \ for 70% (on average and up to 90% in many countries) of worldwide water \nwithdrawn\
    \ for human use. In Italy, irrigation accounts for about 50% of total water use\
    \ and irrigated \nagriculture covers about 27% of usable farmland [2]. \nConsequently,\
    \ improving irrigation water use efficiency (i.e., the ratio between applied water\
    \ and \ncrop yield) is decisive to satisfy the increased world demand for food\
    \ and other agricultural products. \nThis objective may be accomplished by cultivating\
    \ more water-efficient crops (as developed by means \nof conventional or recombinant\
    \ DNA-based breeding) and/or through the application of efficient \nirrigation\
    \ technology. Despite the efforts made in recent years, irrigation efficiency\
    \ (i.e., the amount of \nwater stored in the crop root zone compared to the amount\
    \ of applied water) is still unsatisfactory (less \nthan 40%) [1] and its improvement\
    \ is a key goal for the future.  \nIrrigation efficiency depends on the type of\
    \ irrigation used (for instance, surface irrigation wastes \nmuch more water than\
    \ pressurized overhead or drip irrigation) and on irrigation scheduling, which\
    \ is \nthe method used to determine the amount of water to be applied to a crop\
    \ and the timing for \napplication. Since it determines the crop’s water use and\
    \ influences its yield, irrigation scheduling has \na remarkable effect on water\
    \ use efficiency. \n Irrigation scheduling is crucial in intensive agriculture,\
    \ since under-irrigation generally results in \nreduced crop yield and quality.\
    \ On the other hand, over-irrigation increases the nutrient requirements \nof\
    \ the crop and its vulnerability to diseases, the energy costs for water pumping,\
    \ water loss and \nenvironmental pollution due to the leaching of nutrients applied\
    \ to the crop with conventional \nfertilization or fertigation (the technique\
    \ of supplying fertilizers dissolved in the irrigation water). \nThompson et al.\
    \ [3] reported that the inadequate management of drip irrigation, which in many\
    \ \noperations is still based on grower’s experience, is one of the reasons for\
    \ nitrate leaching in \ngreenhouse tomato production in Almeria, Spain (at present,\
    \ the largest greenhouse area in the world). \nThe goal of an efficient irrigation\
    \ program is to supply the crop with enough water while \nminimizing water waste\
    \ due to deep percolation and runoff. Different approaches to irrigation \nscheduling\
    \ have been developed, each having both advantages and disadvantages [4]. Innovative\
    \ \nmethods based on the direct monitoring of plant water relations have been\
    \ also proposed for irrigation \nscheduling [4]. Although some companies have\
    \ designed irrigation control devices exploiting micro-\nSensors 2009, 9 \n \n\
    \ \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n2811\nmeasurements of stem diameter,\
    \ leaf thickness or stem sap flow, plant-based irrigation management is \nstill\
    \ in the research or development state and is scarcely employed in commercial\
    \ operations [4]. \nThe most widespread irrigation scheduling method is based\
    \ on the determination of soil-water \nbalance, which implies the estimation of\
    \ crop evapotranspiration (ETC). Generally, ETC is calculated \ncombining the\
    \ measurements of potential (or reference) evapotranspiration (ET0) through \n\
    meteorological stations with crop coefficients [5]. The latter need regular updating\
    \ by the farmer for \neach crop type and growing stage. One rather new approach\
    \ is to obtain crop coefficients with satellite \nbased radiation images, rather\
    \ than by using time-costly manual field observations. Recently, D’Urso \net al.\
    \ [6] developed such a system within the framework of two European projects: Demeter\
    \ \n(www.demeter-EC.net) and Pleiades (www.pleiades.es). Access to the satellite\
    \ data has become much \neasier and faster due to recent development with web-based\
    \ access and due to improvements of sensor \nspatial resolution and accuracy.\
    \ D’Urso et al. [6] report that satellite remote sensing is a mature \ntechnique,\
    \ suited to be transferred to practical application for on farm, down to the plot,\
    \  \nirrigation management.  \nThe other approach to irrigation scheduling entails\
    \ the use of root zone sensor (RZS) to obtain soil \nmoisture status and to replenish\
    \ the water in growing medium to a preset level. In principle, this \nmethod by-passes\
    \ the need to calculate ETC and works for any crop, as long as the set-points\
    \ for the \nirrigation controller are correctly chosen. So far, applications of\
    \ RZS for irrigation management have \nbeen less common than those of the water\
    \ balance method, but novel types of RZS, which are based on \nthe measurement\
    \ of soil dielectric properties, have opened new possibilities for irrigation\
    \ scheduling \nand nowadays, after the doubts originated from the first attempts\
    \ with gypsum blocks, the irrigation \nindustry worldwide has recognized that\
    \ RZS’ are valuable tools for modern smart water application \ntechnology in intensive\
    \ agriculture. \nIn this review, the main features of RZS’ (for both soil moisture\
    \ and salinity) designed to be \nconnected to irrigation controller for commercial\
    \ cultivations are identified and discussed. The paper is \nbased on classical\
    \ and more recent literature on soil moisture sensing technology and its application\
    \ to \nirrigation scheduling.  \nThe findings, also unpublished, of our recent\
    \ experimental works conducted in the framework of \nnational or international\
    \ projects (see Acknowledgements) have been considered. These works concern \n\
    mostly the outdoor cultivation of pot ornamentals, which is an important horticultural\
    \ sector in Italy.  \nThe main area for this kind of cultivation is located in\
    \ Tuscany, around the town of Pistoia, \ndefinitely the most important centre\
    \ in Europe for landscaping ornamentals [7]. In this area, nearly \n1,400 ha,\
    \ of approx. 4,500 ha of nurseries, are used for growing pot ornamentals, with\
    \ an estimated \nyearly consumption of irrigation water (mostly, low salinity\
    \ groundwater) of more than 10,000,000 \nm3/year [8]. The low cost of water has\
    \ not led to a more efficient approach to water management. On \nthe other hand,\
    \ current legislation on water resources and the competition for water among agriculture,\
    \ \nurban population and industries will affect the future development of “green\
    \ industry” in this area, \nstimulating the search for more efficient solutions.\
    \ Therefore, the design of a sustainable irrigation \nmanagement system is one\
    \ of the goals of RTD activities conducted by both public and private \nterritorial\
    \ entities (regional extension office, growers associations etc.) \nThe paper\
    \ is agriculture-oriented and then it considers only those sensors that can be\
    \ implemented \nin irrigation controllers, such as traditional water-filled tensiometers\
    \ and the more recent dielectric \nSensors 2009, 9 \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n\
    \ \n \n   \n \n \n2812\nsensors. Expensive and sophisticated RZS’ currently used\
    \ by soil and plant scientists, such as neutron \nprobes [9], are not addressed.\
    \ The paper also discusses how these sensors may be integrated into \nwireless\
    \ networks for computer-controlled irrigation and employed for the application\
    \ of innovative \nirrigation strategies, such as deficit or dual-water (alternate\
    \ use of different water sources) irrigation. \n \n2. Soil Hydraulic Characteristics\
    \ \n \nApart from the direct measurement of water content by thermo-gravimetric\
    \ methods, soil moisture \nconditions can be assessed by the determination of\
    \ the matric potential (m) of pore water or the \nvolumetric water content (),\
    \ which is the volume of water in a certain volume of undisturbed soil. \nRecently,\
    \ some sensors have been developed also to measure the soil salinity (namely,\
    \ electrical \nconductivity o EC), as discussed later. \nThe term m describes\
    \ the amount of energy which must be exerted to extract water from a porous \n\
    medium such as soil or soilless substrate. Therefore, m corresponds to the suction\
    \ required for the \nwater uptake by the plant roots. Moisture tension represents\
    \ the degree of such suction and, according \nto the terminology used in crop\
    \ irrigation management, it is a positive number; the higher the number, \nthe\
    \ higher is the tension and the drier is the soil. The relationship between m\
    \ and  (also called water \nretention curve) depends on the nature of growing\
    \ media and in some cases this relationship is not \nunique being different in\
    \ drying and wetting cycle, in particular in fine-textured soils. The water \n\
    retention curve is generally determined in the laboratory following standard methods,\
    \ for instance: in \nsoil, using Richard's pressure plate apparatus [10]; in soilless\
    \ media (substrate) using De Boodt’s \nmethod [11]. An example of water retention\
    \ curve for a soilless substrate is presented in Figure 1.  \nFigure 1. Water\
    \ retention curve of a peat-pumice mixture, which is widely used for the \noutdoor\
    \ production of ornamental nursery stocks in Italy. The determination was \nconducted\
    \ in the laboratory following De Boodt’s method [11]. Seven different suctions\
    \ \nwere applied to the sample: 1.0, 3.0, 5.0, 7.5, 10.0, 15.0 and 20.0 kPa. The\
    \ value ofat \nsaturation (m = 0) was estimated from the measurement of porosity\

    \ water retention curve may allow computation of a few parameters that, along\
    \ \nwith porosity and bulk density, are used to describe the water relations of\
    \ a given soil sample. Field \ncapacity (FC) is the water content in soil after\
    \ it has been saturated (all pores are filled with water) and \nallowed to drain\
    \ freely till the downward movement of water is terminated; wilting point (WP)\
    \ is the \nminimal moisture the plant requires not to wilt. The physical definition\
    \ of FC and WP is the bulk at \nm of -33 or -1,500 kPa, respectively [12].\
    \ The limitation of these determinations is evident, since \nmany factors, also\
    \ related to the plant, affect the actual values of FC and WP. Nevertheless,\
    \ these \nparameters serve as a practical measure of soil water holding capacity,\
    \ also called available water. Soil \navailable water is defined as the amount\
    \ of water held between FC and WP. Figure 2 illustrates how \nFC, WP and available\
    \ water changes as a function of soil texture. Readily available water is the\
    \ \nfraction (generally, 50%) of available water that can be absorbed by the crop\
    \ plant. The critical m at \nwhich many crops undergo water stress are in the\
    \ order of magnitude of -100 kPa.  \nIn other-than-soil media, such as peat, perlite,\
    \ pumice and rockwool, which are largely used in \ngreenhouses and nurseries,\
    \ available water is the difference between the values determined at m of -\n\
    1 (by definition, the m at container water capacity) and -10 kPa [11,13]. Depending\
    \ on the nature of \nsubstrate, available water ranges from 0.07 to 0.35 m3 m-3\
    \ [13]; it tends to increase with the porosity \nand the bulk density of the material.\

    \ \n \n3.1. Tensiometers \n \nA tensiometer is a kind of artificial root that\
    \ measures m in the growing medium. The tensiometer \nconsists of a shaft filled\
    \ with (distilled) degassed water with a porous ceramic cup at the end and a dial\
    \ \nvacuum gauge or a pressure transducer at the top. The shaft is generally made\
    \ of plastic due its low \nheat conduction and high resistance to corrosion. The\
    \ ceramic cup has small air entry potentials in \norder to prevent de-saturation\
    \ when subjected to negative potentials. The transducer can be connected \nto\
    \ a data-logger for long-term monitoring, to a hand-held meter for spot measurements\
    \ or to an \nSensors 2009, 9 \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n2814\n\
    irrigation controller. The tensiometer is buried at the desired depth in the rooting\
    \ zone with the ceramic \ntip in close contact with the soil particles. The water\
    \ in the tensiometer reaches equilibrium with the \nsurrounding soil through the\
    \ ceramic tip. When water is pulled out through the ceramic tip by drying \nsoil,\
    \ a tension is originated in the tube; when the soil is re-watered, the decrease\
    \ in water potential \ngradient causes a reverse flow of water. As the soil goes\
    \ through drying and wetting cycles as a result \nof ETC and watering (by irrigation\
    \ or rainfall), tension readings can be taken. The porosity of the \nceramic tip\
    \ influences the velocity of water flow from and into the instrument. When used\
    \ in very dry \nconditions, the ceramic must be very fine and this slows down\
    \ the tensiometer reaction to the changes \nin soil m. Obviously, the responsiveness\
    \ of tensiometers to soil moisture conditions determines the \nfield of application.\
    \ For instance, in container cultivation the irrigation lasts generally a few\
    \ minutes \ninstead of one or more hours as in soil culture; therefore, a quick\
    \ response is required, especially when \ntensiometer is used to determine both\
    \ the time and the duration of watering (see next section). \nTensiometers have\
    \ many advantages that make them a competitive instrument for measuring soil \n\
    moisture conditions [14]. They are accurate and not influenced by temperature\
    \ and soil osmotic \npotential, since the salts move freely through the ceramic\
    \ cup. Generally, tensiometers operate \nbetween 0 and 80°C. Below 0°C it is necessary\
    \ to take some precautions due to ice formation, \nalthough some tensiometers\
    \ can work even at -10 ° C (e.g., SKP 850; SDEC; the addresses of the \ncompanies\
    \ mentioned in the text are reported at the end of our review).  \nSome companies\
    \ focus on producing high grade hydraulic tensiometers with special features like\
    \ \nhigh accuracy, high speed (small versions), ability to work over a large range\
    \ of tensions and \ntemperatures (dry end, no collapse of water column), easy\
    \ use in the field (on the fly refillable), etc. \nThese tensiometers are referred\
    \ to as scientifically rated tensiometers; they have generally higher \nprices\
    \ and are not commonly used by growers, but rather by soil and plant scientists.\
    \ \nOn the Italian market, where to our knowledge no manufacturing company exists,\
    \ the price of \ntensiometers ranges between € 150 – 300 and can reach as much\
    \ as € 500, depending on the \ndimensions of the ceramic cup and shaft. Some tensiometers\
    \ have small dimensions, allowing their \nutilisation in small pots. For example,\
    \ Delta-T Devices Ltd. and Skye Instruments Ltd. produce, the \nSWT5 with a 7-cm\
    \ shaft and the SKTM 650 with a 10-cm shaft, respectively. \nHowever, tensiometers\
    \ have also some disadvantages. They are quite fragile and must be operated \n\
    carefully in order to avoid the formation of air bubbles in the shaft, which may\
    \ result in temperature-\ndependent errors in reading. Moreover, they must be\
    \ protected from frost and need regular \nmaintenance, for instance to refill\
    \ the water in the tube and to avoid the contamination by algae. \nSuitable hand-held\
    \ vacuum pumps are generally supplied by tensiometer manufacturers to recharge\
    \ \ntensiometers in situ. \nWhen tensiometers are used in pot culture, some precautions\
    \ are necessary in order to assure a good \ncontact between the porous tip and\
    \ the substrate, and to achieve a correct sensor positioning taking \ninto account\
    \ root distribution and the place of nozzle(s) in case of drip irrigation.  \n\
    The main drawback of tensiometers, however, is the cavitation as the soil gets\
    \ dry. The suction \nmust not exceed the air entry value of the ceramic. The use\
    \ of tensiometers may be difficult in soilless \nsubstrates [15], since their\
    \ high porosity (> 80% against roughly 50% in soils) may result in a poor \ncontact\
    \ between the substrate and the ceramic tip. The typical operating range of water-filled\
    \ \ntensiometers is between 0 and -85 kPa, with an accuracy of 0.1 – 1.0 kPa [14].\
    \  \nSensors 2009, 9 \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n2815\nHigh capacity\
    \ tensiometers have been developed in which the level of measurable suction is\
    \ limited \nonly to the air entry potential of the porous ceramic filter and the\
    \ tensile strength of water [e.g., 16-18]. \nThese instruments can work down to\
    \ m as low as -2 MPa; however, their application has been limited \nby the lack\
    \ of commercially-available devices and by the technical expertise needed for\
    \ their correct \nuse. \nThe porous-matrix sensor follows another approach to\
    \ the measurement of m [e.g., 19,20]. This \nsensor uses porous ceramic with\
    \ known water retention properties (pF-curve), which readily changes \nits degree\
    \ of saturation to maintain equilibrium with the soil water. Soil m is determined\
    \ indirectly \nfrom the measurements of the water content of the ceramic, for\
    \ instance by means of dielectric sensor \n(see next section). Such sensors are\
    \ commercially-available (e.g., equitensiometer; Delta-T Devices \nLtd.). They\
    \ can work in frozen and dry soils with m as low as -500 kPa. Moreover, they\
    \ do not need \nmaintenance for refilling or degassing likewise water-filled tensiometer.\
    \ \nRecently, in the FLOWAID project Whalley and colleagues have designed a new\
    \ dielectric \ntensiometer that works over a much wider range of m. A number\
    \ of prototypes of this sensor have \nbeen tested both in the lab and in a greenhouse\
    \ cucumber crop [21]. Good results have been achieved \nwith these sensor prototypes\
    \ that are able to measure soil m over the nominal range from -3 kPa to  \n-250\
    \ kPa. These sensors might be commercially available in the next months. \nA particular\
    \ example of granular matric sensor is 229-L, which is manufactured by Campbell\
    \ \nScientific. In this sensor the moisture content in the ceramic is measured\
    \ by the heat dissipation \nmethod. The sensor has a heating element and a thermocouple\
    \ encased in the ceramic. The heating \nelement warms up the ceramic and the thermocouple\
    \ measures the temperature rise. The magnitude of \nthe temperature rise varies\
    \ according to the amount of water in the porous ceramic matrix. Each sensor \n\
    must be calibrated according to soil type. This sensor requires a data-logger\
    \ to control the current \nexcitation module, to read the thermocouple outputs\
    \ and to compute soil m (from -10 to -2,500 kPa). \n \n3.2. Electrical resistance\
    \ sensors \n \nThese sensors consist of a porous material in which electrodes\
    \ are embedded to measure electrical \nresistance. When placed in the soil, the\
    \ sensor tends to reach an equilibrium with soil water and the \nelectrical resistance\
    \ reading can converted to a calibrated reading of m: the drier the soil, the\
    \ greater \nthe electrical resistance. Compared to tensiometers, the main advantage\
    \ of electrical resistance sensors \nis their much wider measuring range [22].\
    \ \nThe elements are covered with a synthetic membrane that protects the device\
    \ from corrosion. The \nchalk element prevents the salinity influence on the measurements.\
    \ Gypsum blocks are the oldest and \nsimplest electrical resistance sensors [23].\
    \ They are inexpensive and maintenance-free, but less \nresistant and long-lived\
    \ than other more advanced sensors. The gypsum material dissolves with time \n\
    and therefore the sensor must be replaced every year. Moreover, their response\
    \ to the change in soil \nmoisture is slow, especially in soils close to FC.\
    \ Generally, they work well in fine textured soil over a \nm range from -30 to\
    \ -1,500 kPa approximately, while their use in coarse soil is quite difficult.\
    \  \nWatermark (Irrometer Company, Inc.) is an example of electrical resistance\
    \ sensor [24]. The pore \nsize of its matrix is larger than in gypsum blocks;\
    \ this improves its sensitivity in wet soil and makes it \npossible to use this\
    \ sensor in coarse soils and in soil moisture conditions close to FC. Other advantages\
    \ \nSensors 2009, 9 \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n2816\nof this\
    \ sensor are the accuracy and the durability, albeit small calibration shifts\
    \ may occur with time. \nHowever, the readings are affected by soil salinity due\
    \ to fertilizers or irrigation water, although the \nsensors are normally supplied\
    \ with built-in compensation for common salinity levels in the fields. \nRecently,\
    \ in the FLOWAID project we tested Watermark sensors in container plants with\
    \ poor results \nand we concluded that such a sensor is not suitable for monitoring\
    \ the water status of soilless \nsubstrates (usually close to saturation) and\
    \ for controlling irrigation in pot culture. \n \n3.3. Dielectric sensors \n \n\
    In dielectric sensors an alternating electric field is induced into the surrounding\
    \ media. By \nmeasuring voltages and currents induced by this field in the measuring\
    \ rods, the total complex \nelectrical impedance is obtained for the media. This\
    \ impedance relates to the complex permittivity, \nwhich can be converted into\x1F\
    \ soil  and bulk EC, on the premises of known media calibration. The \nsize and\
    \ shape of the electric field depends largely upon the shape and size of the used\
    \ electrodes for \nsensors. Furthermore, the penetration depth of the electric\
    \ field is limited and decays rapidly the \nfurther away you get from the electrodes,\
    \ as a reciprocal of the distance.  \nWith this technique, only an average of\
    \ the soil moisture in the measuring volume can be obtained. \nIn non-homogeneous\
    \ media or water content distributions one needs to take into account that the\
    \ water \ncloser to the electrodes contributes more to the average value. Especially\
    \ in growing media like \nrockwool (widely used for fruit vegetables grown in\
    \ greenhouses), where there is a large vertical \ngradient in , it is needed\
    \ to calibrate the dielectric sensors for the specific placement in the media\
    \ \n(vertical, horizontal, pin directions). For the 3-electrode version of the\
    \ WET sensor (Delta-T Devices \nLtd.; pin length 70 mm and distance of 2 × 16\
    \ mm), a measuring volume of about 220 cm3 was found \nwhen using a 99% electric\
    \ field influence reaching out to about 2 cm from the electrodes [25]. Some \n\
    sensors like Theta-probe (Delta-T Devices Ltd.) mimic a co-axial electrode design\
    \ by having a single \npin in the middle and three surrounding electrically connected\
    \ outer pins. Their sensing volume is \nsmaller and the readings are less susceptible\
    \ for disturbances or variations in  outside the pins. The \nsmaller measuring\
    \ volume for dielectric sensors might be a problem in non-heterogeneous soils.\
    \ Here, \none wants to obtain an average reading over a large volume, to get a\
    \ more representative reading with \nonly a single sensor. Several sensor concepts\
    \ try to enlarge their volume by making larger pin concept, \nfor instance AquaFlex\
    \ (Streat Instruments Ltd).  \nThere are different types of dielectric sensors\
    \ depending on the output signal used for estimating , \nbased on Time Domain\
    \ Reflectometry (TDR), Frequency Domain (FD) (Reflectometry and \nCapacitance),\
    \ Time Domain Transmission (TDT), Amplitude Domain Reflectometry (ADR) and Phase\
    \ \nTransmission sensors. All these sensors differ in terms of use and maintenance,\
    \ calibration \nrequirements, accuracy and price [26]. While TDR uses a pulsed\
    \ excitation wave, FD uses a fixed \nfrequency sine wave to measure the soil impedance.\
    \ The precision and the accuracy of TDR and FD \nsensors depend on the wave form\
    \ interpretation methods used in software [27]. Most of them are based \non the\
    \ relationship between  and dielectric constant (permittivity) of soil according\
    \ to the Topp’s \nequation [28]. The latter can be valid for the soils with low\
    \ clay content and a bulk density between 1.3 \nand 1.5 kg L-1 [29]. For other\
    \ kinds of soil special calibration is generally required [30]. \nSensors 2009,\
    \ 9 \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n2817\nFor many years TDR has\
    \ been the only principle used to measure soil . Expensive equipment is \nnecessary\
    \ for this kind of measurement; therefore, TDR technology is considered less suitable\
    \ for \nirrigation control in commercial crops, although very recently some authors\
    \ [31] reported on the \napplication of TDR sensor for irrigation scheduling in\
    \ nursery and greenhouse industry. \nFD-sensors for soil moisture (e.g., Theta-probe,\
    \ Delta-T Devices Ltd.) came onto the market more \nrecently. The main advantage\
    \ of FD sensors is the immediate and accurate reading, thus they are quite \n\
    suitable for automated irrigation control. However, there are some drawbacks.\
    \ For instance, they are \naffected by soil salinity, which attenuates the signal.\
    \ There is also general consensus that FD sensors \nmust be calibrated more frequently\
    \ than TDR sensors. Using a frequency of at least 1 GHz can \nminimize this problem\
    \ [32]. Soil porosity and temperature may also influence sensor readings, \nespecially\
    \ when frequencies lower than 20 MHz are used [23]. In the soil top layer, wide\
    \ temperature \nfluctuations occur during the day and the growing season, therefore\
    \ the measurement of temperature \nmust be incorporated in the sensor in order\
    \ to allow on-line correction. Likewise any other RZS, \ndielectric sensors must\
    \ be placed in strict contact with soil, since air gaps may result in erroneous\
    \ \nmeasurements. \nIn a series of laboratory or greenhouse experiments, we have\
    \ evaluated a few dielectric sensors such \nas Theta Probe ML2X and SM200 (both\
    \ from Delta-T Devices Ltd.). Generally, these sensors consist \nof two or more\
    \ electrodes separated by a plastic dielectric and positioned inside a cylinder;\
    \ a plastic \naccess tube covers all these elements. Obviously, the design may\
    \ change according to the specific \napplication. The measuring volume depends\
    \ on the distance between the two conductors and on their \nlength. In common\
    \ soils, Theta Probe is characterized by a 5% accuracy using the supplied calibration,\
    \ \nbut it is possible to achieve 1% accuracy after calibration to a specific\
    \ soil. This sensor seems quite \nsuitable for small-volume pots and containers\
    \ such as plug trays, which are largely used in greenhouse \nand nursery crops.\
    \ It can work up at temperature as high as 70 °C, although the accuracy decreased\
    \ \nabove 40 °C, always considering a calibration to a specific soil. \nSome experiments\
    \ were carried out on sandy soils and coconut fibre to verify the applicability\
    \ of \nTheta Probe ML2X in some growing media widely used in ornamental crops\
    \ [32]. The repeatability of \nmeasurements was good, both on all tested sandy\
    \ soils tested and on coconut fibre as well. About the \nsalinity effects on data\
    \ acquisition, in a 0.7 – 0.4% dS m-1 range, the salinity of the nutritive solution\
    \ \non coconut fibre substrate affected sensor reading with an error of  3 –\
    \ 4%. However, this error was \nunimportant and the use of Theta Probe ML2x to\
    \ control irrigation of plants grown in coconut fibres \ndid not affect plant\
    \ growth. Farina and Bacci [32] also observed that the temperature did not influence\
    \ \nthe repeatability of sensor readings. Theta Probe revealed some limitations\
    \ in presence of lack of \nhomogeneity in soil characteristics or when an incorrect\
    \ installation occurs. In fact, it’s strongly \nrecommended to insert sensors\
    \ into the soil without torsions that could lead to a poor contact between \n\
    sensor rods and soil particles. \nSM200 sensor, which is more recent than Theta\
    \ Probe, is suitable for many types of soil and \nsubstrates. Moreover, it is\
    \ barely affected by soil salinity and can be used at extreme temperatures, \n\
    since the operating range is between -20 and +60 °C. Measuring accuracy is 0.3%\
    \ for  from 0 to \n0.50 m3 m-3; as a function of temperature, the accuracy is\
    \ 0.07% at 20 °C and 0.13% in the 20 – 60 \n°C range. \nSensors 2009, 9 \n \n\

    \ of dielectric sensors has been developed to measure both  and \nthe salinity\
    \ (namely, EC) of growing media, thus providing the possibility to control the\
    \ fertilisation as \nwell, for example by adjusting the concentration of the fertigation\
    \ water. Currently there are two \nsensors on the market: the WET (Delta-T Devices\
    \ Ltd.) and the 5TE (Decagon Devices Inc.). \nThe WET is a frequency domain dielectric\
    \ sensor that was originally designed and produced by \nIMAG-DLO Wageningen (The\
    \ Netherlands) [33] and is now manufactured and sold by Delta T-\nDevices Ltd.\
    \ at a cost of € 600 – 900. It is a 3-pin sensor, with the main advantage that\

    \ temperature readings are used to \ncorrect the  and EC variations with temperature.\
    \ The sensor has a high repeatability once inserted into \na growing medium and\
    \ left untouched (1%). However, to obtain good absolute readings, the sensor \n\
    needs a specific calibration for the type of growing medium. In its simple form,\
    \ one may use the \nTopp’s curve [28], which was made for TDR measurement at 150\
    \ MHz. Since the WET works at 20 \nMHz, it is much more susceptible to soil texture\
    \ and the manufacturer advises to use their standard \ncurves for sand, clay,\
    \ mineral soils etc., or to use a customer-defined calibration curve. The WET\
    \ is \nused for the agricultural market especially for irrigation and fertigation\
    \ control, mostly in greenhouses \nhorticulture. In this market, and as a derivative\
    \ of the original WET, it is sold by Grodan B.V. under \nthe name of WCM. WCM\
    \ can be used to control the root zone. Stradiot [34] even reports that by \n\
    maintaining differences between day and night moisture  rockwool slabs it is possible\
    \ to steer plants \ntowards vegetative or generative growth. \nThe WET was originally\
    \ designed to be used in soil, where normally EC is lower then 2 dS m-1. In \n\
    horticultural growing media, however, EC may be as high as 10 dS m-1. For this\
    \ reason, Grodan has \nmodified the original design and calibrates their sensors\
    \ up to 10 dS m-1, and Delta-T Devices Ltd. \nsupplies extended calibration curves\
    \ up to 5 dS m-1. In highly-saline soils, the accuracy of the standard \nWET is\
    \ not warranted; Bouksila [35], for instance, advises to use a soil specific calibration\
    \ here as \nwell. \nThe WET measures bulk EC, which is the total EC of the growing\
    \ media containing water, nutrients \nand air. However, generally growers are\
    \ not interested in bulk EC, but rather in pore water EC (ECpw), \nwhich is the\
    \ EC in the water extracted from the growing media, for instance by using suction\
    \ cup or by \nperforming a 1 : 2 water extract [36]. \nHilhorst [37] developed\
    \ a derivative of the WET, which has an easy-to-handle design for taking \nrapid\
    \ and multiple readings in container plants. It has a single insertion pin containing\
    \ both electrodes \nin the tip, and measures ECpw directly by using a special\
    \ model. Delta-T Devices Ltd. brought this \nprobe onto the market (Sigma-Probe),\
    \ but due to mechanical problems, and especially the limited \nrange over which\
    \ the ECpw model was valid, it was taken out of the market. Since then, several\
    \ \nresearches reported about modifications of the Hilhorst-model of ECpw to make\
    \ it possible to use the \nWET for direct measurement of ECpw [e.g., 38,39]. \n\
    In Italy, especially in container grown crops, mixtures of several materials such\
    \ as peat, perlite and \npumice (of volcanic origin) are being used as growing\
    \ media. Regalado et al. [40] reported about \npotential problems with the calibration\
    \ of the WET sensor in volcanic soils, due to the biased \ndetermination of .\
    \ Therefore, they proposed to use an empirical calibration for the water content\
    \ \nbased upon soil bulk density, and an estimate of the sensor’s effective frequency.\
    \ Recently, Incrocci et \nal. [39] conducted a study on the calibration of the\
    \ WET using different types of growing media \nSensors 2009, 9 \n \n \n   \n \n\
    \ \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n2819\n(perlite, pumice, peat and mixtures of these\
    \ materials). They concluded that: i)  calibration was \nfaintly dependent on\
    \ the type of substrate and only slightly affected by the salinity of irrigation\
    \ water; \nii) at least in the peat-pumice mixture, the linear regression between\
    \ bulk EC and ECpw was markedly \naffected by , the slope decreasing with increasing.\
    \ An equation differing from the one published by \nHilhorst [37] was proposed\
    \ to estimate ECpw from the WET readings of permittivity, bulk EC and \ntemperature.\
    \ \nThe 5TE sensor is a low-power sensor that measures soil , temperature and\
    \ bulk EC. It is very new \non the market (it appeared in 2007) and costs about\
    \ half the price of the standard WET, due to its \nsimpler housing design, based\
    \ upon a moulded and combined electrode-printed circuit board design. It \nhas\
    \ an RS232 output, which makes it necessary to use an external micro-computer\
    \ to handle the data, \nand makes it less suitable to connect it to standard data\
    \ loggers. The 5TE outputs just three \nsimple values for permittivity, EC and\
    \ temperature, which makes interfacing quiet simple. The WET-\nsensor has a similar\
    \ serial interface, but decoding its data requires a more complex algorithm. \n\
    The 5TE uses 3.6 – 15 VDC at 10 mA during 150 ms measurement. Its operating temperature\
    \ range \nis between -40 and 50 °C and it has small dimensions.  values are obtained\
    \ by using the FD \ntechnology at about 70 MHz (based upon the previous ECH2O-probe),\
    \ and by utilizing a higher \nfrequency than the WET. Moreover, the 5TE has minimal\
    \ salinity and textural effects. It has a \nresolution of 0.08% from 0 to 0.50\
    \ m3 m-3  and an accuracy (when using a medium specific \ncalibration) of ±\
    \ 1 – 2% in any porous medium with EC < 10 dS m-1. EC is obtained using a separate\
    \ \nlow-frequency EC technique based upon the EC-5 probe, and two stainless steel\
    \ screws which makes \nthe sensor more robust. The operating range is 0 – 23 dS\
    \ m-1 (bulk EC), with a resolution of 0.01 dS m-\n1 from 0 to 7 dS m-1, and 0.05\
    \ dS m-1 from 7 to 23 dS/m. Accuracy is ±10% for 0 – 7 dS m-1; user \ncalibration\
    \ is needed above 7 dS m-1. For a number of mineral soils, a single calibration\
    \ curve seems \nsuitable. The probe uncertainty increases with increasing , and\
    \ at higher EC values the probe signal is \nattenuated. Bogena et al. [41] tested\
    \ the previous EC-5 probe and concluded that temperature and EC \neffects on the\
    \ sensor reading should be corrected, using appropriate correction functions.\
    \ However, \nthey, as well as Kizito et al. [42], report that the family of ECH2O\
    \ sensors (EC-5 and ECH2O-TE) is \nsuited for large RZS networks because of their\
    \ low-cost and limited needs for calibration. \n \n4. Irrigation Controllers \n\
    \ \nMost of the off-the-shelf sensors are equipped only with manual or digital\
    \ readers, able to make \nmany elaborations but without any device to automatically\
    \ activation the irrigation process. However, \nall sensors can be integrated\
    \ in a dedicated system for automatic irrigation. \nThe simplest irrigation controller\
    \ based on RZS is represented by a switching tensiometer. There \nare two main\
    \ systems available commercially. The first consists in an electronic switch that\
    \ can be \nmounted on the vacuum gauge dial of the tensiometer and set to start\
    \ irrigation at pre-set values of soil \ntension. This switch normally operates\
    \ with AC current flow, but it’s possible to order direct current \n(DC) systems.\
    \ The vacuum gauge is equipped with a magnet and a magnetic pick-up switch. When\
    \ the \npre-set soil tension is reached, the switch closes and activates the irrigation\
    \ pump, which distributes a \npre-fixed amount of water. The second type of irrigation\
    \ controller uses a pressure transducer instead \nof a vacuum gauge. The pressure\
    \ transducer measures any variation in soil tension and modifies the \nSensors\
    \ 2009, 9 \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n2820\nelectric current\
    \ flow accordingly; the reading is continuous. More advanced irrigation controllers\
    \ are, \nfor instance, the GP1 irrigation system manufactured by Delta-T Devices\
    \ Ltd. and the prototype \ndeveloped by Bacci et al. [43]. \nWith GP1, Delta-T\
    \ Devices Ltd. also allows the possibility of upgrading an existing controller\
    \ \n(central controller, residential or commercial timer) by adding intelligence\
    \ to it. GP1 optimizes \nwatering using both simple and complex irrigation algorithm\
    \ based on multiple parameters, including \nsoil moisture and weather data, allowing\
    \ multiple irrigation ‘start-and-stop’ conditions. \nThe prototype developed by\
    \ Bacci et al. [43] is based on a programmable data-logger (Tattletale 5F, \n\
    Onset Computer Corporation), to which up to eight tensiometers and other sensors\
    \ (e.g., thermometer, \nhygrometer, anemometer, net radiometer etc.) can be connected.\
    \ SKTM 650 (Skye Instruments Ltd.) \ntensiometers are used in consideration of\
    \ their low price, accuracy and small dimensions. Obviously, \nother RZS’ could\
    \ be employed. The current version of this device can control four electro-valves.\
    \ The \nbuilt-in software allows the setting of m threshold to active irrigation\
    \ and the management of the \nirrigation cycle (time, dose, etc.). Each tensiometer\
    \ can be managed independently or the irrigation \nactivation can be driven by\
    \ the average reading of two or more tensiometers. The software implements \n\
    an algorithm to calculate ET0 according to CIMIS equation [44]. Hourly ET0 values\
    \ are used to check \nthe irrigation method based on m measurements according\
    \ to an integrated system described in Bacci \net al. [43]. The new version of\
    \ the system under development will be provided of a 32 BIT CPU with: \neight\
    \ analogic channels for the acquisition of different parameters (micrometeorological\
    \ data, soil \nwater status etc.); eight I/O digital counters for water meters\
    \ measuring the volumes of both irrigation \nand drainage water; electro-valves\
    \ control. System expansion will be assured by RS-485 port that \nallows the connection\
    \ of S-bus modules of two types: analogical (signal range 0 5V; 0 20 mA) and\
    \ \ndigital (relays control). The S-bus interface allows the management of actuators\
    \ and sensory by means \nof an only bus to four wires: two wires to power supply\
    \ and two wires to digital signal (informative \ncontent). The bus connects the\
    \ different modules in cascade, eliminating the problems associated to \nwiring\
    \ and the interference on the sensor signal. \n \n4.1. Sensor positioning \n \n\
    For the growers, a complete irrigation control system must be cost effective and\
    \ user-friendly. The \nsensors used for monitoring soil water content must be\
    \ inexpensive and the minimum number of \nsensors needed for a given irrigation\
    \ plot must be clearly defined. Moreover, the sensor must be easily \nremoved\
    \ and reinstalled, as in many farms (for instance, in greenhouses and nurseries)\
    \ there are \nseveral crops over the year. Knowing where and how many sensors\
    \ are positioned in the crop is \ntherefore crucial. \nA single RZS may be not\
    \ enough due to possible malfunctioning and, more importantly, because it \nmonitors\
    \ only a limited volume (sensor cup has a small sphere of action) and area of\
    \ the cultivation. \nLarge variability in the root zone moisture may occur as\
    \ results of the heterogeneity in both \nsoil/substrate characteristics and plant\
    \ water relations. Also under relatively uniform conditions as \nthose occurring\
    \ in greenhouses and nurseries, there is large variability in the ETC of individual\
    \ plants, \nand this may result in important differences in the soil dehydration\
    \ rate among different zones in the \nSensors 2009, 9 \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n\
    \ \n \n \n   \n \n \n2821\nirrigated area. For instance, in greenhouses the plants\
    \ close to lateral windows and/or to heating \nsystems tend to transpire much\
    \ more, compared to plants growing in other locations. \nIn an open-air nursery\
    \ at CESPEVI in Pistoia (Italy), Bacci et al. [45] determined the readings of\
    \ 12 \nidentical tensiometers each placed in different pots filled with a peat-pumice\
    \ (1:1, v:v) mix. The pots \nwere located within 0.5 m each from other. The variability\
    \ ranged between 17% for container water \ncapacity and 21% for m -7.5 kPa (the\
    \ irrigation set-point fixed for the experiment). Thus, more RZS’ \nare needed\
    \ in the irrigation area in order to obtain significant mean values of soil water\
    \ status (also by \nappropriate statistical treatment of data) and to overcome\
    \ the potential problems due to sensor \nbreakdown. \nSensor position inside the\
    \ growing medium is another important issue. In field crops, it is generally \n\
    recommended that RZS’ be installed in pairs, one at one-third and the other at\
    \ two-thirds of the rooting \ndepth. In pot plants, the root system has a propensity\
    \ to develop in the bottom half of the container \nwith very few roots in the\
    \ top substrate. Moreover, irrigation frequency is very high (up to several \n\
    times a day) due to the limited water buffer capacity of the pot as a whole. Under\
    \ these conditions, in-\nbetween successive irrigation events there are minimal\
    \ variations of the overall  which remains close \nto FC However, there is\
    \ a large vertical gradient in : at the bottom, the substrate remains nearly\
    \ \nsaturated and shows minimal variations in , whereas the top layer desiccates\
    \ rapidly after irrigation \ndue to the gravitational water flow, thus showing\
    \ wide oscillations in moisture. Therefore, RZS’ must \nbe placed in an intermediate\
    \ position. In plants cultivated in pots with a volume ranging from \napproximately\
    \ 1.5 to 9.0 L (pot diameter of 12 or 18 cm, respectively), Bacci and colleagues\
    \ [46,47] \nfound that the best position is at one-third of the pot height from\
    \ the top and at 3 – 4 cm from the pot \nedge. It was also found that, when drip\
    \ irrigation is used, the sensor should be inserted in the substrate \nat a 90°\
    \ angle towards the nozzle. \n \n5. Irrigation Strategies Based on RZS  \n \n\
    Many research papers have documented that the schedule of irrigation by means\
    \ of RZS may \nsignificantly reduce the water use of many field and greenhouse\
    \ crops (cultivated in both soil or \nsoilless media) without any important effects\
    \ on crop productivity. A few examples are those \npublished very recently by\
    \ Zotarelli et al. (field tomato) [48], Tuzel at al. (greenhouse cucumber) [21]\
    \ \nand Pardossi et al. (outdoor pot ornamentals) [8]. \nWhen RZS’ are applied\
    \ to schedule irrigation, the controller uses the data from the sensing point(s)\
    \ \nin the root zone to determine the moment and duration of watering. The operating\
    \ principle is that, \nwhenever a pre-set threshold (‘start’ value) of  or m\
    \ is reached, the valves of the irrigation pipelines \nare opened till the ‘stop’\
    \ value (generally, close to FC) is reached. In addition to ‘start’ and ‘stop’\
    \ \nthresholds, RZS-based irrigation controllers generally require other inputs\
    \ from the user, such as \nminimum and maximum duration of watering, and maximum\
    \ elapsed time without irrigation in \nconsideration of possible sensor failure.\
    \ Several devices (e.g., GP1, Delta-T Devices Ltd.) are \ncommercially available\
    \ to provide a ‘start-and-stop’ irrigation control based on two or more RZS’ \n\
    buried in and underneath the root-zone. This set of sensors can monitor the movement\
    \ of the water into \nthe deeper layers and minimize percolation losses. \nSensors\
    \ 2009, 9 \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n2822\nThe  or m ‘start’\
    \ value depends on crop species and developmental stage, soil characteristics\
    \ and \nenvironmental conditions as well. For m, the typical range is between\
    \ -20 and -70 kPa in soil \n(depending on soil texture) or between -4 and -10\
    \ kPa in soilless substrates [47]. By determining the \ndivergence in leaf water\
    \ potential between well-watered and un-watered plants, Thompson et al. [49] \n\
    identified the m threshold for pepper, melon and tomato grown under the typical\
    \ greenhouse \nconditions of south-eastern coast of Spain: they were -58 kPa for\
    \ pepper, -35 kPa for melon and -38 or \n-58 kPa for tomato grown, respectively,\
    \ in spring or in winter. Therefore, optimal ‘start’ m value may \ndecreased\
    \ under lower ET conditions, at least in some crop species. \n \n5.1. Deficit\
    \ irrigation \n \nRZS may be valuable tool for the implementation of regulated\
    \ deficit irrigation, which aims to \ncontrol the vegetative vigour of crop plants\
    \ and improve produce quality [50]. For instance, regulated \ndeficit irrigation\
    \ is largely used for wine grapes in regions where this crop is regularly irrigated,\
    \ such \nas California and Australia. In red grape varieties, a moderate water\
    \ stress imposed a few weeks after \nfruit set and maintained midway through berry\
    \ formation may enhance the maturity of berries and \nimprove the quality of wine.\
    \ For best results, it is reported that the average soil m should be kept at\
    \ -\n150 to -200 kPa in sandy soil, around -250 kPa in loamy soil and at -300\
    \ to -400 kPa in clay soil [51]. \nTherefore, a successful application of deficit\
    \ irrigation needs the determination of soil water status \nand, in consideration\
    \ of the range of m previously reported, tensiometer are of little value and\
    \ \ndielectric or granular matrix sensor must be used. \nAn example of deficit\
    \ irrigation regulated by RZS is the work conducted very recently by Tuzel et\
    \ \nal. [21]. In a greenhouse cucumber crop at Izmir (Turkey), they used GP1 controllers\
    \ with WET \nsensors buried at 20-cm depth to control full irrigation or two deficit\
    \ irrigation regimes, as compared to \ngrower’s practice (experience-based scheduling).\
    \ Water was applied when  reached 0.25, 0.22 and \n0.18 m3 m-3, respectively,\
    \ in Full, Deficit 1 and Deficit 2 irrigation treatments, which corresponded to\
    \ \na depletion of available water in the root zone of 20, 40 and 60%, respectively.\
    \ It was found that RZS-\nbased irrigation resulted in no noticeable percolation\
    \ loss or over-irrigation in contrast to the \ntraditional farm practice. Moreover,\
    \ deficit irrigation increased crop water use efficiency by 40 – 42% \nand 27\
    \ – 28% compared to grower’s schedule and full irrigation, respectively. \n \n\
    5.2. Zero-runoff irrigation of container crops \n \nThe use of RZS seems very\
    \ promising in the outdoor cultivation of pot ornamentals. These crops \nare generally\
    \ over-irrigated for a series of reasons, such as poor irrigation scheduling (typically\
    \ based \non growers’ experience and the use of simple timers) and the plant sensitivity\
    \ to salinity, which \ninevitably increases the leaching fraction, which is the\
    \ fraction of applied water that is drained out \nfrom the pot bottom drained\
    \ water. A leaching fraction of 25 – 30% is generally necessary to prevent \n\
    the salinity build-up in pot plants, especially when fertigation and/or saline\
    \ water are used by the \ngrowers. Moreover, in many nurseries, at least in the\
    \ area of Pistoia, there is the practice to place \ndifferent plant species in\
    \ the same cultivation plot, which results in the tendency to regulate irrigation\
    \ \non the basis of the most water demanding crop. \nSensors 2009, 9 \n \n \n\
    \   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n2823\nIn a work conducted recently at CESPEVI\
    \ under the typical growing conditions of commercial \nnurseries (in particular,\
    \ growing different plant species in the same plot), Pardossi et al. [8] compared\
    \ \ntimer and tensiometer control of fertigation of pot ornamentals. In the latter\
    \ treatment, the irrigation \nwas controlled by means of tensiometer placed in\
    \ one pot hosting a plant (the sentinel) of Prunus \nlaurocerasus, the species\
    \ with the average ETC among the ones under investigation; the others were \n\
    Forsythia intermedia, Photinia x fraseri, and Viburnum tinus. \nCompared to timers,\
    \ the use of tensiometers decreased the water application by 23% and the \nleaching\
    \ of nutrients with drainage water by 31%, thus alleviating the contamination\
    \ (with nitrates, for \ninstance) of ground and surface water. No differences\
    \ between the two scheduling methods were \nobserved in terms of plant growth\
    \ and market value, as assessed at the end of the growing season. The \nreduction\
    \ of water application allowed by RZS resulted from a lower frequency of irrigation\
    \ compared \nto timer-based control, with minimal differences between the two\
    \ methods in terms of leaching \nfraction. \nVery similar results were found in\
    \ another experiment carried out at CESPEVI by Bacci et al. [43] \nwith container\
    \ cultivation of Hypericum hidcote. They observed that, compared to timer-based\
    \ \nirrigation scheduling, the tensiometer maintained a more favourable substrate\
    \ water status to plant \ngrowth in periods of peak ETC, as suggested by Figure\
    \ 3 where the data of m recorded during three \nfollowing days in July 2004 are\
    \ shown. In timer treatment, m decreased down to approximately -25 \nkPa, while\
    \ in tensiometer-controlled culture m remained below -10 kPa in reasons of best\
    \ water \ndistribution during the day, notwithstanding the irrigation was permitted\
    \ only in four preset time \nwindows, according to the local growers’ practice.\
    \ In soilless substrates growth reductions can occur at \nm as low as -16 kPa\
    \ [e.g., 52,53]. \nFigure 3. Changes in the substrate m in pots with Hypericum\

    \ improvement of irrigation efficiency in container crops may be attained by means\
    \ of ‘start-\nand-stop’ control system. Such a system should maintain m between\
    \ -8 to -10 kPa and -2 to -3.0 kPa, \nSensors 2009, 9 \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n\
    \ \n \n \n   \n \n \n2824\nwhich correspond to  values of, respectively, 0.30\
    \ – 035 and 0.45 – 0.55 m3 m-3, depending on the \nnature of growing medium. In\
    \ this range of soil m, the pot water content remains lower than FC and \nthe\
    \ loss of water by drainage is minimized. This system, known as ‘zero-runoff’\
    \ irrigation, may be \nachieved also by the a priori determination of the water\
    \ dose needed to increase substrate  from the \n‘start’ value to the value close\
    \ to water capacity. Obviously, such a dose depends on both pot volume \nand the\
    \ hydraulic properties of the growing media. \nFollowing this approach and using\
    \ greenhouse-grown pot geranium as plant model, in 2006 we \nconducted a trial\
    \ at the University of Pisa to compare two scheduling methods (timer vs. tensiometer)\
    \ \nin open drip irrigation system (L. Bacci and L. Incrocci, unpublished). Rooted\
    \ cuttings of geranium \n(Pelargonium peltatum) were transplanted in pots with\
    \ volume of 1.5 L and height of 13 cm, filled a \npeat-perlite mixture; plant\
    \ density was approximately 8 plant m-2. Every day at a fixed time (08:00 \na.m.)\
    \ or whenever the tensiometer (SKTM 650) reading reached the threshold value (-6\
    \ kPa), a pre-\nestablished water dose was applied to each pot by means of self-compensating\
    \ drippers (discharge rate \nof 2 L h-1). In timer treatment, the water dose ranged\
    \ between 1.2 to 1.8 L m-2 according to the growth \nstage and the climate inside\
    \ the greenhouse, that is the dose tended to increase during the cultivation;\
    \ \nactually, in timer treatment we followed the growers’ practice. Conversely,\
    \ in tensiometer-based \nirrigation, a fixed water volume of 1.8 L m-2 was established\
    \ preliminarily in order to restore the full \nwater container capacity with a\
    \ leaching fraction not higher than 5%. This quantity was divided in \nthree doses,\
    \ four minutes apart. No differences between the two methods were observed regarding\
    \ crop \nETC, growth and commercial value; however, at the end of cultivation\
    \ in tensiometer treatment water \nrunoff was less than 1.0 L m-2 (approximately\
    \ 2% of total applied water) against 14.3 L m-2 (23% of \napplied water) in the\
    \ one scheduling method. \nNevertheless, the application of zero-runoff irrigation\
    \ in pot cultivation has some difficulties. \nFirstly, it requires the use of\
    \ raw water with low salinity; otherwise there is a progressive salinity \nbuild-up\
    \ in the root zone, which results in plant growth reduction. Moreover, it is necessary\
    \ to install \npressure-compensating nozzles with uniform and low discharge rate,\
    \ in order to synchronize the \nsubstrate moistening and the response of RZS.\
    \ Too fast irrigation may lead to over-watering before \nRZS senses the ‘stop’\
    \ conditions in the measuring volume (generally, a small fraction of total \n\
    container volume). Finally, the sentinel pot(s) does/do not provide a perfect\
    \ representation of water \nneeds of all plants in the plot, therefore extra water\
    \ is required to ensure that the driest pots in the \nirrigated area (because\
    \ of higher ETC and/or lower discharge rate than expected) will receive the \n\
    necessary dose. As matter of fact, real zero-runoff irrigation in container culture\
    \ can be achieved only \nthrough the recovery of drainage water (closed system)\
    \ [8]; in free-drain (open) culture the goal is to \nreduce leaching fraction\
    \ as much as possible, say, below 10 – 15%. \n \n5.3. Fertigation and dual water\
    \ irrigation \n \nThe availability of sensors (WET and 5TE) that are capable of\
    \ also monitoring the soil salinity has \nopened new possibilities for the automatic\
    \ control of fertigation and/or the application of a dual-water \nirrigation scheme.\
    \ In the FLOWAID project, in cooperation with Spagnol Greenhouse Technologies\
    \ \nwe developed a prototype of fertigation device, which is able to change the\
    \ nutrient content (thus, EC) \nSensors 2009, 9 \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\
    \ \n   \n \n \n2825\nof the fertigation water as well as the source of raw water\
    \ based on the measurements of the ECpw of \nthe growing medium (peat-pumice mixture)\
    \ by means of WET sensors. \nThe prototype was tested at CESPEVI in the spring\
    \ and summer of 2008 in an experiment with pot \nornamental plants (the same used\
    \ in the trial described in paragraph 5.2), where we simulated the \navailability\
    \ of saline water (EC = 1.50 dS m-1) (L. Incrocci et al., unpublished). Saline\
    \ water might be \nthe kind supplied, for instance, by an urban wastewater treatment\
    \ plant. A project is underway in \nPistoia district for an irrigation network\
    \ using the treated wastewater from the city.  \nFigure 4. Changes in the salinity\
    \ (EC) of the pore water (ECpw;, thin line) in the growing \nmedium (peat-pumice\
    \ mixture) and of the nutrient solution (thick line) fed to pot \nornamentals\
    \ grown at CESPEVI (Pistoia) in the spring-summer of 2008. Two irrigation \nregimes\
    \ differing for scheduling method and the source of raw water were compared: :\
    \ 1) \ntimer control with nutrient solution (EC = 0.80 dS m-1) prepared using\
    \ low-salinity \ngroundwater (EC = 0.50 dS m-1); 2) WET scheduling and two sources\
    \ of water \n(groundwater or saline water with EC = 1.50 dS m-1) to prepare the\
    \ nutrient solution with a \nmaximum EC of 1.80 dS m-1. In the latter, the nutrient\
    \ solution EC was modulated by \nchanging the rate of fertiliser addition and\
    \ the water source in order to maintain the ECpw \nbelow 2.50 dS m-1. In the lower\
    \ graph, the bars close to the abscissa indicate the source of \nirrigation water:\

    \ a nutrient solution with a maximum EC of 1.80 dS m-1. The prototype modulated\

    \ as well as the sources of water, in order to \nmaintain the ECpw below 2.50\

    \ the growing season the prototype used saline water, fresh water or both (at\
    \ \nvariable ratio), as shown in Figure 4. The irrigation regime did not influence\
    \ plant growth. However, \ncompared to the timer, the WET-based scheduling reduced\
    \ the seasonal water consumption by 35% \n(499 vs 325 L m-2), which was provided\
    \ by saline water by 45%; therefore, in the WET treatment the \nconsumption of\
    \ groundwater was 36% of the one recorded in the timer treatment. \n \n5.4. Integrated\
    \ scheduling method \n \nIrrigation timing and water dosage are the key aspects\
    \ of watering scheduling. Available equipment \nand specially soil moisture monitoring\
    \ devices, provide all the information required for irrigation \nmanagement, but\
    \ frequently lack in representativeness and reliability. To solve this problem,\
    \ ET \ncomputing and soil moisture monitoring methods should be integrated to\
    \ improve automatic irrigation \nsystem performances in field and in pots [54,55]\
    \ and to guarantee system functioning in case of sensor \ndamaging [56]. Unfortunately,\
    \ the application of climate-based methods to pot plants requires a \ndifferent\
    \ approach to crop coefficient computing [e.g., 43,57]. \nNorrie et al. [58] developed\
    \ an automatic irrigation system that integrated both electronic \ntensiometers\
    \ and weather station to estimated ETC with Penman-Monteith equation [5]. This\
    \ system \nwas tested in a greenhouse soilless culture (peat bag) of tomato. The\
    \ information about ETC was used \nto define the ‘start’ tension threshold as\
    \ well as the concentration (EC) of fertigation water: during \nperiods of intense\
    \ ETC the irrigation was more frequent (i.e., the trigger set-point was less negative)\
    \ \nand the EC was reduced with respect to periods with low ETC. \nMore recently,\
    \ Bacci et al. [43] suggested the use of tensiometer readings for the estimation\
    \ of crop \ncoefficient in potted plants using the CIMIS equation [44] for the\
    \ assessment of ET0. In this way, after \na short period of calibration for different\
    \ ornamental plants grown in containers, the system can work \nautonomously, controlling\
    \ the functioning of tensiometer by means of an indirect estimation of ETC. \n\
    \ \n6. ICT Technology for Irrigation Management \n \n6.1. Decision support system\
    \ \n \nDue to soil spatial variability, many sensors are needed in each irrigation\
    \ plot or for every group of \nsprinklers or drippers in the field, thus resulting\
    \ in high investment and maintenance costs, especially \nwhen wired sensors are\
    \ being used. Gathering real-time, fine-grained data is critical for success,\
    \ but it \nis not possible with current wired data-loggers which are both expensive\
    \ and not able to react to \nsignificant events (e.g., to increase sensing rate\
    \ during a rain storm). Nowadays wireless \ncommunication is a simple and low-cost\
    \ technology thanks to the wide diffusion of cell phones, ISM, \nGSM, WI-FI devices\
    \ and SMS bi-directional delivery, satellites and the Internet [59]. Moreover,\
    \ it \nenables to communicate quickly and store a great amount of information\
    \ helpful in water budgeting \nand irrigation scheduling. \nThe combination of\
    \ the new technology with data processing algorithms and models could be used\
    \ \nto develop decision support system (DSS) with positive effects for a sustainable\
    \ and efficient use of \nnatural resources in agricultural production and enabling\
    \ the decision maker to optimise production \nSensors 2009, 9 \n \n \n   \n \n\
    \ \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n2827\nand profit through cost reduction. An example\
    \ of DSS is the FLOW-AID system [60]. This system \nconsists of an array of irrigation\
    \ controllers distributed over the farm zones to be irrigated (Figure 5). \nThe\
    \ controllers are connected via a wireless communication link to a local computer,\
    \ which retrieves \nregularly the data from RZS’ and weather station, and updates\
    \ the irrigation scheduling programs \nrunning autonomously in the controllers.\
    \ A DSS running on the local computer and partly on a remote \ncomputer (connected\
    \ via the Internet) assists the grower in the optimization of the scheduler programs\
    \ \nfor the irrigation controllers on a long-term as well as on a short-term basis.\
    \ For example, on a long \nterm the DSS provides the grower with an optimized\
    \ crop planting plan, a set of irrigation scheduling \ntasks and an estimate of\
    \ annual water use per each irrigation plot. On a short term, and based on actual\
    \ \ncrop status, weather and, possibly the weather forecast, the DSS irrigation\
    \ scheduler module predicts \ncrop water demand and suggests the optimal scheduling\
    \ strategy for each plot, including the source of \nwater if different types of\
    \ water are available (well, reservoir, recycled water, irrigation network etc.).\
    \ \nThe selected irrigation tasks, including parameter settings, are then downloaded\
    \ into the remote \nirrigation controllers. The irrigation scheduler is run on\
    \ a day-to-day basis (or hour-to hour, for \ninstance in container cultivation)\
    \ and, if needed, the individual controllers are reprogrammed. Each \nirrigation\
    \ plot has an individual controller node, and local or remote sensors are added\
    \ to it as needed \nby the application, either via hard-wire or a wireless link.\
    \ A typical node has the tasks to monitor soil \nwater status and other data (for\
    \ instance, soil and air temperature), and to open and close multiple \nvalves.\
    \ Once programmed by the irrigation scheduler, the controller keeps on running\
    \ its tasks \nautonomously, until it is re-programmed or stopped by the local\
    \ computer. This makes the irrigation of \nindividual plots fairly safe as it\
    \ does not depend on real-time communication with a remote computer. \nFigure\

    \ sensor networks \n \nWireless sensor networks are a new technology that promises\
    \ fine grain monitoring in time and \nspace, and at a lower cost, than is currently\
    \ possible [60,61]. Wireless sensor networks for irrigation \nmanagement are presently\
    \ offered by several companies (e.g., Crossbow Technologies, Inc.; Netafim \n\
    Sensors 2009, 9 \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n2828\nLtd.; Delta-T\
    \ Devices Ltd.; Decagon Devices, Inc.). However, these systems are still quite\
    \ expensive \nand have high-energy requirements. According to several authors\
    \ [e.g., 62,63], at the current stage of \ndevelopment wireless sensor networks\
    \ are not reliable and affordable enough for wide commercial \napplication, even\
    \ if very recently we [60] and other authors [64,65] have presented a new low-cost\
    \ \nmulti-hop wireless sensor network monitoring real-time substrate moisture,\
    \ temperature and EC with \ngood results in the control of irrigation and nutrient\
    \ applications. \nAccording to some tests proposed by Cardell-Oliver et al. [66],\
    \ wireless sensor networks have great \npotential to provide dynamic, real-time\
    \ data about monitored variables of a landscape enabling \nscientists to measure\
    \ properties that have not previously been observable. However, to ensure effective\
    \ \ndata gathering by sensor networks for monitoring remote outdoor environments,\
    \ the following \nproblems remain: reactivity, the ability of the network to react\
    \ to its environment and provide only \nrelevant data to users; robustness, the\
    \ ability of network nodes to function correctly in harsh outdoor \nenvironments;\
    \ network lifetime, maximizing the length of time the network is able to deliver\
    \ data \nbefore batteries are exhausted. \nIn the FLOWAID project, Balendonck\
    \ et al. [60] experimented in container grown ornamentals \nwith a self-made low-cost\
    \ wireless sensor network (hybrid mesh network design) based upon the T-\nnode\
    \ system from SOWNET Technologies B.V. combined with an SM200 (Delta-T Devices\
    \ Ltd.) \nsensor. The T-Nodes are the ones originally developed by TNO Defence,\
    \ Security and Safety (The \nNetherlands) for wireless sensor networks. They combine\
    \ a microcontroller for local processing, a \nradio for digital communications\
    \ and I/O abilities to interface with sensors, actuators and external \nsystems.\
    \ They use an 868 MHz FSK transceiver with ranges up to 120 meters in free space\
    \ and 40 \nmeter indoors. They have power consumption (at 3V) of 18 mA (TX) and\
    \ 13 mA (RX), and 20 μA in \nsleep mode; moreover, they have a self-organizing\
    \ ultra low power multi-hop protocol and an ultra-\ncompact design. Six sensor\
    \ nodes and three repeaters were built and evaluated during five months in \n\
    spring-summer 2007 in semi-commercial nursery operational environment at CESPEVI.\
    \ This work \ncontinued during summer 2008 with an improved design: a new antenna\
    \ design for higher signal \nstrength; housing with a double wall; a construction\
    \ for protection of the electronics against high \ntemperatures. The software\
    \ in the firmware of the wireless nodes was changed to optimize power use. \n\
    In the current configuration, such a system costs about € 700 per node, including\
    \ an SM200 sensor \n(about € 250). Functional tests showed that a maximum range\
    \ of about 100 meters between node and \nrepeater is feasible under line-of-sight\
    \ conditions. Long term experiments at CESPEVI showed that a \nrange of 60 m can\
    \ be obtained. However, some short and not-so-short lasting node and sensor failures\
    \ \noccurred either due to non-optimal mechanical construction of the housing,\
    \ condensation, and \nunforeseen external events (theft). Even if in the second\
    \ year there was much progress with the \ncommunication abilities of the SOWNET\
    \ system compared to the previous year, the performance is \nstill not as reliable\
    \ as needed. \nRecently, the Crossbow EKO Wireless Sensor network has become available\
    \ (Crossbow \nTechnologies, Inc.), which operates in a true mesh-network topology,\
    \ is solar powered and enables a \nlong maintenance free operation. In addition,\
    \ it has an open sensor interface to be able to integrate new \ntypes of sensors.\
    \ Each EKO wireless node supports up to four sensors (soil moisture and temperature;\
    \ \nair temperature and humidity). Sensors are plugged into the unit without the\
    \ necessity to connect wires \nto terminal blocks or change jumper configurations.\
    \ A single EKO system can support up to 35 nodes \nSensors 2009, 9 \n \n \n  \
    \ \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n2829\nand 140 sensing points. The management\
    \ of the network of EKO nodes is based on a 2.4 GHz \nradio/processor module.\
    \ The system worked more or less flawlessly during the whole long-term \nexperiment\
    \ at CESPEVI in 2008. A reliable operating range of more than 200 m in-between\
    \ two \nindividual sensor nodes was obtained. The sensor data were made accessible\
    \ on-line via the Internet, \nand the web-based software tool worked fine as well\
    \ as the solar cell based power supply. Very \ninfrequently a node needed to be\
    \ restarted; there have been no major system failures. \nBased upon these results,\
    \ Balendonck and Hemming concluded (unpublished data) that this system \nis currently\
    \ the best commercially available alternative to work with. However, in the current\
    \ \nconfiguration a system like this costs about € 600 per node, including a Watermark\
    \ sensor (about € \n90). In the summer 2009 we plan to conduct an experiment with\
    \ Crossbow EKO technology coupled to \nthe 5TE sensor for , EC and T. The approximate\
    \ total cost per node for this configuration is € 800 – \n900, which is still\
    \ too high for it to become a widespread commercial success for high density wireless\
    \ \nsensor networks, such those required by the nurseries in Pistoia area with\
    \ hundreds of irrigation plots. \nUntil now, the communication among RZS’, controller\
    \ and irrigation valves has been assured by \nhydraulic or electric systems. The\
    \ first one, through some pulses, and using a unidirectional \ncommunication,\
    \ activated the on/off operation of the valves. Electric communication foresees\
    \ the \nusage of wires instead of tubes and the activation of the valves takes\
    \ place by the usage of solenoids. \nWith growing field size and by having more\
    \ irrigated crops, in the near future there will also be a big \nneed to be able\
    \ to control remotely valves by using a wireless system. Coates et al. [64] report\
    \ on \nsuccessful field experiments with prototypes of this equipment. Their latest\
    \ technology is based upon \nthe 900 MHz low-power wireless module (Crossbow Technologies,\
    \ Inc.) [61]. \nAlthough the use of wireless systems to convey data from a RZS\
    \ towards a central computer is far \nmore widespread, recently wireless valve\
    \ controllers appeared upon the market (f.i. Hunter Industries \nInc.; FreeWire,\
    \ Wireless Irrigation Controller, Green Wireless System, Inc.; CYCLIK, Rain Bird\
    \ \nCorporation), and find their way, for instance into irrigation applications\
    \ for agriculture and golf \ncourse management. \n \n7. Conclusions \n \nOn the\
    \ market there is a wide range of RZS’ that may be applied for farm level irrigation\
    \ \nmanagement and their selection is not simple, since several issues must been\
    \ taken into consideration. \nA selection method has been suggested by Muňoz-Carpena\
    \ [26]. It computes a final sensor value based \non an array of questions regarding\
    \ its attributes: measuring range, accuracy, repeatability, \nmethodology for\
    \ data communication and handling, maintenance, safety and, obviously, price.\
    \ \nFrom the viewpoint of measured quantity, two classes of RZS’ can be identified.\
    \ Hydraulic \ntensiometers have a higher resolution in dryer media and their readings\
    \ are less sensitive to the media \ntype (no medium-specific calibration is needed).\
    \ However, they require more maintenance and, in very \ndry soils, they fail.\
    \ Low-cost dielectric tensiometer without this drawback may be available in the\
    \ near \nfuture. Dielectric sensors for  have a better resolution at higher water\
    \ contents, in the  range of  \n0.15 – 0.40 m3 m-3 (or even higher in artificial\
    \ growing media with high porosity), and they do not \nneed much maintenance.\
    \ However, often they require a soil specific calibration and are susceptible\
    \ to \nsoil heterogeneity; therefore, they perform better in very homogeneous\
    \ media like sand or media like \nSensors 2009, 9 \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n\
    \ \n \n   \n \n \n2830\nrockwool. In general, dielectric sensors have a high repeatability\
    \ (good for irrigation, which re-wets \nthe soil), but the absolute accuracy is\
    \ not very high (due to calibration errors and soil heterogeneity). \nBased on\
    \ the results of our experiments conducted on horticultural crops over many years,\
    \ both \ntypes of RZS’ seem to perform well when appropriately integrated with\
    \ irrigation controllers. \nHowever, it is undeniable that, for such a field of\
    \ RZS application, accuracy is less important than \nrepeatability, low-maintenance\
    \ and easy use, and that dielectric sensors (including the dielectric \ntensiometer,\
    \ when available) are more grower-friendly than water filled tensiometer. \nUndoubtedly,\
    \ the development of a number of technologies, including those involving soil\
    \ moisture \nsensing and wireless data communication, has allowed the design and\
    \ marketing of innovative \nirrigation controllers that may play a pivotal role\
    \ in saving water and improving the economical and \nenvironmental sustainability\
    \ of intensive cropping systems. In the near future, the implementation of \n\
    wireless managing with information coming from GIS, interpretation of aerial photos\
    \ and satellite \nimages and topographic data will further improve the water management\
    \ at farm level. \nNonetheless, in many farms, also in countries with an advanced\
    \ agriculture like Italy and in high-\ntech production sectors such as greenhouse\
    \ and nursery industry, irrigation management still depends \non growers’ experience\
    \ for the assessment of crop water requirements and the time of irrigation. In\
    \ \ngeneral, the use of RZS for irrigation scheduling in commercial cultivations\
    \ is very sporadic in Italy \nand only very few examples exist in the sectors\
    \ of grapevine, fruit crop and processing tomato \ncultivation. In the area of\
    \ Pistoia, to our knowledge only a couple of greenhouse growers make use of \n\
    RZS to control (manually, in one case) the irrigation in soil-grown ornamental\
    \ crop. On the other hand, \nour recent and current research and demonstration\
    \ activities carried out in Tuscany significantly \nreduced the original scepticism\
    \ (especially, from the growers) on the application of RZS for efficient \nirrigation\
    \ management of container ornamental plants. As a matter of fact, many growers\
    \ are interested \nin such technology and are somewhat waiting for devices marketed\
    \ at more affordable costs \nTherefore, the main obstacles to the application\
    \ of RZS technology at farm level seem to be the \noverall costs of such technology\
    \ and the lack of effective policies for the dissemination and transfer of \n\
    smart water application technology to commercial operations, including grower\
    \ training. The progress \nin the field of electronics and computer science suggests\
    \ a further reduction of prices and a more and \nmore significant integration\
    \ of advanced technologies inside the intensive agricultural sector. \nMoreover,\
    \ ICT will assure a simplification of system functioning and an increase of the\
    \ system \nefficiency, but with a wider use of external resources. The increase\
    \ in the price of water as such and in \nthe severity of environmental legislation\
    \ concerning the exploitation and protection of water resources \nalso will contribute\
    \ to the adoption of smart water application technology. \n \nAcknowledgements\

    extract_1: 'ABSTRACT:  Crop irrigation uses more than 70% of the world’s water,
      and thus, improving irrigation efficiency is decisive to sustain the food demand
      from a fast-growing world population. This objective may be accomplished by
      cultivating more water-efficient crop species and/or through the application
      of efficient irrigation systems, which includes the implementation of a suitable
      method for precise scheduling.'
    extract_2: In principle, this method by-passes the need to calculate ETC and works
      for any crop plant, as long as the set-points for the irrigation controller
      are correctly chosen. So far, applications of RZS for irrigation management
      have been less common than those of the water balance method, but novel types
      of RZS, which are based on the measurement of soil dielectric properties, have
      opened new possibilities for irrigation scheduling and nowadays, after the doubts
      originated from the first attempts with gypsum blocks, the irrigation industry
      worldwide has recognized that RZS’ are valuable tools for modern smart water
      application technology in intensive agriculture.

  explanation: The study used a theoretical crop water stress index (CWSI) to develop
    an adaptive irrigation scheduling algorithm for apple trees. Unlike the traditional
    CWSI algorithm with a fixed threshold, the new algorithm used a dynamic threshold
    that changed according to the CWSI trend. This was done to avoid over-irrigation
    on humid, cool, and overcast days, which are known to lead to erroneous irrigation
    signals in the traditional CWSI. To test the feasibility of the new algorithm,
    it was applied to thermal and meteorological data collected over two growing seasons
    (2007 and 2008) and in a field experiment in the 2013 growing season. The results
    showed that the new algorithm was able to avoid over-irrigation under humid and
    cool weather conditions, and adapted well to the changing conditions of the apple
    trees.

    and content Highlights • We developed an irrigation algorithm relying on a theoretical
    stress index (i.e. CWSI). • A new, variable threshold for the CWSI was developed.
    • Irrigation water was automatically delivered to the plots of apple trees. •
    There was a high correlation between midday CWSI and stem water potential. • The
    algorithm avoided over irrigation on humid, cool, and overcast days. Abstract
    An adaptive scheduling algorithm relying on a theoretical crop water stress index
    (CWSI) was developed to automatically irrigate apple trees. Unlike the traditional
    CWSI algorithm where the threshold is a constant value, in the present approach
    the threshold is dynamically determined by following the CWSI trend. A previous
    work on the energy budget analysis of a single apple leaf provided the base for
    calculating lower and upper boundaries of CWSI. To test the feasibility of the
    algorithm, it was applied to the thermal and meteorological data collected during
    the 2007 and 2008 growing seasons. A computer-based wireless control system was
    also developed to automatically schedule irrigations in three plots of apple trees
    in the 2013 growing season. In a small scale field experiment, two treatments
    were compared: (1) automatic irrigation using the new algorithm (CWSI-DT) and
    (2) irrigation scheduling based on weekly readings of neutron probe (NP). The
    soil water deficit under the CWSI-DT treatment was maintained within the well-watered
    range with no signs of over or under irrigation. This was better than the results
    in the NP treatment where there were occasions of under irrigation. Midday canopy
    and air temperature difference exhibited a close agreement with midday stem water
    potential ( ; R2 = 0.63, ). Normalizing in the form of CWSI resulted in a much
    higher correlation between midday CWSI and midday (R2 = 0.91, ) suggesting CWSI
    as a reliable indicator of apple trees water status. The automatic control system
    running the new CWSI-DT algorithm was able to avoid over-irrigation under humid
    and cool weather conditions, and adapted itself to the changing conditions of

    stress indexDynamic threshold 1. Introduction To increase profit and water savings,
    and agricultural sustainability, and to reduce environmental impacts, implementation
    of appropriate irrigation scheduling methods is necessary (Smith et al., 1996).
    The use of infrared thermometry and most recently thermal imagery, along with
    a number of supplemental environmental measurements, have been introduced as an
    alternative approach to soil- or weather-based methods of irrigation scheduling
    (Jackson et al., 1977, Wanjura et al., 1995, Cohen et al., 2005). Various thermal
    methods/indices have been developed such as the crop water stress index (theoretical
    CWSI; Jackson et al., 1981, Jackson et al., 1988; empirical CWSI: Idso et al.,
    1981) and time–temperature threshold (TTT; Wanjura et al., 1992, Wanjura et al.,
    1995). CWSI is defined by a comparison of the actual canopy and air temperature
    difference with an upper water-stressed base line (WSBL) and a lower non-water-stressed
    baseline (NWSBL) which are calculated using empirical or theoretical approaches.
    Compared to row crops, relatively less work is reported in the literature on the
    irrigation scheduling or water stress detection in tree crops using CWSI. Thermal
    methods in the form of empirical CWSI have been studied in different trees such
    as pistachios (Testi et al., 2008), peaches (Wang and Gartung, 2010, Paltineanu
    et al., 2013), olives (Agam et al., 2013a, Berni et al., 2009, Akkuzu et al.,
    2013), and citrus trees (Gonzalez-Dugoa et al., 2014). Osroosh et al. (2015) developed
    theoretical NWSBLs for apple trees based on the energy balance of a single leaf.
    CWSI is traditionally calculated at or averaged over a short period of time around
    solar noon. This is the time when the crop is exposed to the maximum level of
    solar radiation and believed to show signs of stress. However, this calculation
    approach makes the index susceptible to many unwanted transitional weather related
    factors such as dust or passing clouds (O’Shaughnessy et al., 2012, Agam et al.,
    2013b). Analytical models respond to different meteorological conditions including
    high wind speed and radiation change which are not accounted for in empirical
    models (Jackson et al., 1988, Jones, 1999). The dynamic conditions of the tree
    canopies including fruit load change, a change in optical/thermal properties and
    light interception due to vegetative growth, or short term oscillations of canopy
    temperature (Casadesus et al., 2012, Gonzalez-Dugoa et al., 2014, Osroosh et al.,
    2015) disconnect between soil water content and CWSI response. The conventional
    CWSI-based approach of irrigation scheduling used a static/fixed threshold above
    which an irrigation signal is triggered. This is while the threshold actually
    changes as a function of many factors including weather conditions and crop growth.
    This threshold is not easy to determine and might require field experiments with
    crops under full or deficit irrigation. The CWSI value for a crop under no stress
    is normally assumed to be zero (minimum CWSI), and for a severely stressed crop
    to be close to one (maximum CWSI; Jackson et al., 1981). While these assumptions
    might be true in the instance of homogeneous canopies of major row crops, it is
    not applicable to heterogeneous tree canopies. The interference of thermal radiation
    from the ground with canopy temperature readings, as well as the rough nature
    of the tree canopies can lead to smaller canopy and air temperature differences
    and consequently result in CWSI values greater than zero even in well-watered
    canopies (Fereres et al., 2012). On the other hand, the temperature of apple tree
    canopies increases as low fruit loads are reached because stomatal conductance
    is a function of load and reduces as the load decreases (Lakso, 2003). As a result,
    non-water stressed baselines are dependent on the load and might not reach zero
    in well-watered trees with no or very low load. To date, the efforts have primarily
    concentrated on improving the empirical or theoretical methods of estimating the
    baselines (Clawson et al., 1989, Jones, 1999, Meron et al., 2003, Leinonen and
    Jones, 2004, Möller et al., 2007). This is while the common approach is still
    as basic as simple comparison of the midday CWSI with a predetermined crop and
    site specific threshold. In order to improve the performance of the CWSI algorithm
    as a trigger for automatic irrigation scheduling of grain sorghum, O’Shaughnessy
    et al. (2012) incorporated a time threshold (TT) into a theoretical index (CWSI-TT).
    They used CWSI-TT successfully to automate irrigations of grain sorghum in a semi-arid
    region. However, they still reported an under-irrigation problem caused by cloud
    cover and the impact of changing crop aspect on IRT measurements. The main objective
    of this research was to develop and evaluate an adaptive CWSI-based irrigation
    algorithm with a dynamic threshold (CWSI-DT). The goal was to maintain the trees
    in a well-watered condition and to avoid over irrigation mainly due to erroneous
    irrigation signals on cool and humid days, caused by temporary weather conditions,
    and canopy growth. 2. Materials and methods 2.1. Study area The field experiments
    were conducted in a Fuji apple orchard on the Roza Farm of the Washington State
    University Irrigated Agriculture Research and Extension Center near Prosser, WA,
    at the coordinates of latitude 46.26°N, longitude 119.74°W, and 360 m above sea
    level. The site was located in a semi-arid zone with almost no summer rains and
    an average annual precipitation of 217 mm. The site’s soil was a shallow Warden
    Silt Loam, ∼1-m deep with an impermeable rocky layer limiting soil depth to less
    than 0.6 m in some locations. The average volumetric water content at field capacity,
    , was estimated in the field to be 32.5% (measured as drained soil water content
    after an irrigation event), and the value of the volumetric water content at permanent
    wilting point, , was assumed to be 13.8% (Saxton and Rawls, 2006). The trees were
    spaced 4 m (row spacing) by 2.5 m (tree spacing) apart in the orchard. In 2007
    and 2008, they were irrigated with a micro-sprinkler irrigation system (Hurricane,
    NaanDanJain Irrigation Ltd., Post Naan, Israel) with water emitters of 27 L h−1
    spaced at 2.5 m intervals. During the 2013 growing period, the orchard was irrigated
    with two lines of pressure compensating drip tubing laterals (∼0.6 m apart) of
    in-line 2.0 L h−1 drippers (BlueLine® PC, The Toro Company, El Cajon, CA), spaced
    at 0.914 m intervals along laterals. 2.2. Treatments and experiment design The
    proposed CWSI-DT algorithm as discussed later was initially applied to the data
    collected in field experiments in 2007 and 2008 where young, well-developed apple
    trees were fully-irrigated. A fully-watered status was assured by maintaining
    the soil water deficit within the management allowable depletion for apple trees
    recommended by Allen et al. (1998) ( of total available water). The control algorithm
    was then used to automatically schedule irrigations in three plots in 2013 (CWSI-DT
    irrigation treatment) where the same apple trees that while healthy, for various
    reasons bore little or no fruit. Irrigation scheduling using neutron probe (NP)
    was also conducted in three similar plots (NP irrigation treatment). Soil moisture
    readings were made weekly and the soil was fully replenished to field capacity.
    The irrigation treatments (i.e. CWSI-DT and NP) were evaluated in a randomized
    complete block design (RCBD) with three replications/blocks (total of 6 plots).
    2.3. Control system and automatic measurements Real-time canopy temperature ,
    relative humidity , solar radiation , wind speed and air temperature were required
    field measurements for calculating theoretical CWSI (described later). To collect
    data and implement automatic irrigations, a wireless central control system including
    hardware and graphical user interface (GUI) was developed. The electronic hardware
    consisted of a centrally located 900 MHz spread-spectrum radio as master (RF401,
    Campbell Scientific, Logan, UT, USA) and six wireless sensor nodes as slaves.
    The master was connected to a laptop computer and the slaves to dataloggers located
    in the orchard. A sensor node was made up of a CR10(X) datalogger (Campbell Scientific,
    Logan, UT, USA) and all or some of the following sensors/components: (a) shielded
    air temperature sensors (Model 109, Campbell Scientific, Logan, UT, USA), (b)
    infrared thermometers (IRT/c.2: Type J, Exergen, Watertown, Mass.) with a field
    view of 35° and ±0.6 °C accuracy, and (c) latching solenoid valves (Irritrol,
    Riverside, CA) actuated by L298 dual H-bridge motor drive (Robotshop Inc., Mirabel,
    Quebec, Canada), and 900 MHz spread-spectrum radio (RF401, Campbell Scientific,
    Logan, UT, USA) to transmit data and receive control signal to/from the central
    control. All of the nodes were powered using batteries and 10 W solar panels (SYP105,
    Instapark Co., Santa Fe Springs, CA). The nodes took measurements from the field
    sensors and reported them to the control computer. The GUI was developed in VB.Net
    (V.2010, Microsoft Inc., Redmond, WA). The GUI collected data from the sensor
    nodes, acquired real-time weather data from web, ran the adaptive irrigation algorithm,
    and automatically scheduled irrigation to the plots (three CWSI-DT and three NP
    plots). Weekly NP readings of soil water content were entered into the GUI to
    let the control system schedule irrigations and automatically turn on/off the
    valves. The GUI ran the algorithms everyday at midnight and scheduled irrigation
    events of different plots (if decided) for the following morning at 10:30AM. Meteorological
    data of the 2007, 2008 and 2013 growing seasons were obtained from two electronic
    weather stations in the Washington State Agricultural Weather Network (AgWeatherNet):
    Roza and WSU HQ weather stations located about 0.5 km and 4.5 km away from the
    orchard, respectively. In 2007 and 2008, three pairs of IRTs (IRt/c.03 ™ : Type
    T, Exergen, Watertown, Mass.) with a field view of 17° and an accuracy of ±0.6
    °C wired to a Campbell CR21X datalogger (Campbell Scientific, Logan, UT, USA)
    were used. Two IRT orientations and positions were employed: (a) in 2007 and 2008,
    the IRTs were pointed at 0° and 45° azimuth and zenith angles, respectively, at
    both the north and south sides of a tree (Osroosh et al., 2014, Osroosh et al.,
    2015) and (b) in 2013, three individual IRTs (IRT/c.2) were installed perpendicularly
    above a tree (∼1 m high) at the center of the plots (Sepulcre-Canto et al., 2006,
    Testi et al., 2008). The IRTs were calibrated/checked using a blackbody calibrator
    (BB701, Omega Engineering, Inc., Stamford, CT) and shielded by PVC white case.
    Canopy temperature and meteorological data were acquired every 15 min. 2.4. Manual
    field measurements Stem water potential was measured at midday (between 13:00
    and 15:00) with a pressure bomb (Model 615, PMS Instrument Co., Albany, OR) once
    per week in the plots under the CWSI-DT treatment from July 31st to October 2nd.
    Each time shaded leaves from the lower inner part of tree, close to the trunk
    were targeted. They were enclosed in plastic envelopes covered with aluminum foil,
    and left attached to the tree for a period of 15–60 min (Fulton et al., 2001).
    A total of six readings (two readings per tree) were averaged to calculate the
    corresponding to each sampling date. The measurements were made under different
    atmospheric conditions including cool, humid and overcast days. Soil water content
    was measured using a neutron probe (503DR Hydroprobe, Campbell Pacific Nuclear,
    Concord, CA) in the center of each irrigation plot where an IRT was mounted. Due
    to presence of the rocky layer in the study site, soil moisture readings were
    limited to depths as shallow as 0.6 m in the experimental plots. Hence, measurements
    taken down to 0.6 m (0.15 m increments) were used for the purpose of irrigation
    scheduling. PVC access tubes were placed between the drip tubing laterals about
    1.25 m from tree trunk. The neutron probe was field-calibrated using soil samples
    (Evett, 2008): (1) where is the volumetric soil water content (m3 m−3), R is the
    neutron probe reading, SC is the standard count, and a and b are the calibration
    coefficients. To check the accuracy of neutron probe readings, lab calibration
    was also carried out with soil in barrels annually. The soil water deficit (mm)
    was calculated as , where D is the managed soil depth, is the measured volumetric
    soil water content. The allowed water deficit (mm) for the managed soil depth
    was calculated as . 2.5. Calculation of CWSI The crop water stress index was calculated
    after Jackson et al., 1981, Idso et al., 1981 as: (2) where is the difference
    between the measured temperatures of canopy and air is the temperature difference
    between canopy and air for a well-watered tree canopy (non-limiting soil water
    availability), and is the temperature difference between canopy and air for a
    non-transpiring canopy. was computed after Osroosh et al. (2015): (3) where (Idso
    et al., 1981), is the saturated vapor pressure (kPa) at the air temperature is
    the actual vapor pressure of air (kPa), is the atmospheric pressure (kPa), is
    the latent heat of vaporization (J mol−1), is the heat capacity of air (29.17
    J mol−1 C−1), is the slope of the relationship between saturation vapor pressure
    ( , kPa) and air temperature ( , °C). is similar to the psychrometric constant
    defined by Campbell and Norman (1998), , and is the air boundary layer conductance
    to heat calculated as Eq. (4) (Campbell and Norman, 1998): (4) where u is the
    wind speed (at 2 m high above the ground) and d is the characteristic dimension
    defined as 0.72 times the leaf width ( : measured in the field). The factor 2
    accounts for the fact that apple leaves are hypostomatous (Green et al., 2003).
    and n are defined by the following equations (Osroosh et al., 2015), respectively:

    is the transmitted shortwave radiation through apple leaf . is the atmosphere

    waveband, respectively ( and ). was calculated as where is the albedo . The optical/thermal
    properties of apple leaf were adapted from Green et al. (2003). is the vapor conductance
    estimated using the following equation (Osroosh et al., 2015): (7) where b is
    the calibration adjustment coefficient. This equation accounts for the fact apple
    leaves are well-coupled to the atmosphere and therefore respond to change in relative
    humidity (Dragoni et al., 2005). The upper limit, , was calculated by assuming
    closed stomata for a non-transpiring canopy , and replacing with zero in Eq. (3):
    (8) 2.6. CWSI-DT irrigation algorithm To address some of the issues with the conventional
    CWSI approach, an adaptive CWSI algorithm relying on a dynamic threshold (CWSI-DT)
    was developed (Fig. 1). The design was based on three major facts: (a) no irrigation
    is required as long as the index has a decreasing trend, (b) irrigation has to
    stop if no decrease was observed in the index after several successive irrigation
    events exceeding soil water holding capacity, and (c) no irrigation is needed
    if evaporative demand is too low. The CWSI-DT approach and its new terminology
    are described in the following paragraphs. Download : Download high-res image

    water depth of successive irrigations. 2.6.1. Midday CWSI ( ) 1-h average of thermal
    and meteorological data (i.e., , , and ) collected between 13:00PM and 14:00PM
    are used to compute midday CWSI . In the conventional approach, sometimes CWSI
    is negative or is greater than 1 . The new algorithm limits to a range between
    “0” and “1” by putting the following conditions in place: if is negative it is
    assumed “0” and if greater than “1” is set to “1”. 2.6.2. Base CWSI ( ) is defined
    as minimum achievable by the crop. The algorithm continuously changes in relation
    to (if then ). The value of depends on many factors including errors caused by
    uncertainties in canopy temperature measurements, input weather data, and stomatal
    regulations. In a well-watered tree, might maintain a zero value, be above zero,
    or constantly change throughout the season. 2.6.3. Dynamic threshold ( ) is defined
    as the sum of and the conventional CWSI threshold, ( , If then ). Like ranges
    between “0” and “1” . The value of and therefore is determined by feedback from
    the apple trees in response to irrigations. 2.6.4. Algorithm description To make
    an irrigation decision four main steps are taken: (a) is compared with both and
    , (b) is compared with , (c) maximum air temperature is compared with a temperature
    threshold , and (d) the total amount of water (net) applied successively is compared
    with the water holding capacity of the soil in the MAD fraction. If all of the
    following conditions are met an irrigation event is scheduled: (1) , (2) , (3)
    , (4) MAD. If any of the above conditions are not met the following actions will
    be taken and the program enters a waiting loop: (1) If Then and . (2) If Then
    . (3) If Then . (4) If or Then . (5) If MAD Then and . The algorithm compares
    with and no irrigation is scheduled if . We included this in the algorithm to
    follow a simple yet useful traditional approach of farmers. They do not irrigate
    when it is too cold as the ET rate at this temperate is low enough to be neglected.
    Such temperatures are very probable to be seen early (Day of Year = DOY = 110–143)
    or late (DOY ⩾ 243) in the growing season. On a very humid, overcast, or cool
    day, it is very probable that which results in . This is an uncertain condition
    and no comparison with the threshold or irrigation management decision is made.
    Considering that the control system relies on a feedback from the trees (i.e.
    canopy temperature) and the irrigation system is high frequency, the quantity
    of irrigation water is not important (Jones, 2004). Based on this fact, the system
    applies some amount (discussed later) of water and then waits for the trees to
    respond. This is to account for a possible lag in the physiological response.
    If the amount of the water is adequate, it will be reflected in a decreasing .
    If is still greater than , the system keeps watering (on a daily time step) until
    drops below the threshold or the total amount of water (net) applied successively
    exceeds 80% of MAD. At this point is reset to “1”. If drops below the current
    base, is reset to the lower value. Again, below zero is assumed “0” and a value
    greater than “1” is treated as “1”. The required application settings were determined
    based on the observations in 2007 and 2008. The value of was the temperature that
    farmers in the region traditionally consider too cold to irrigate. The value of
    , in 2013 was set based on the variations of midday CWSI in well-watered apple
    trees in 2007 and 2008. The irrigation depth was calculated as three times the
    average crop evapotranspiration in June and July. This amount of water was expected
    to avoid deep percolation while wetting the root zone at the highest evapotranspiration
    demand. The daily mean crop evapotranspiration was computed using the ASCE standardized
    Penman–Monteith equation (ASCE-EWRI, 2005) in combination with the crop coefficient
    values adjusted for the local climate (Karimi et al., 2013): (9) where is the
    alfalfa reference evapotranspiration . 2.7. Statistical analysis The statistical
    measures used were: (a) the mean absolute error , (b) the root mean square error
    , (c) a linear regression between midday and CWSI in 2013, (d) standard deviation
    and standard error of mean as measures of variance, and (e) ANOVA . The RMSE was
    exploited as a measure of the variance between measured and predicted calculated
    as: (10) where n is the number of measurements. Considering the sensitivity of
    the RMSE to outliers, the mean absolute error was also used as a safer measure
    of the variance between and : (11) 3. Results and discussion 3.1. Midday canopy
    and air temperature difference The theoretical non-water-stressed baseline described
    in Eq. (3) requires one calibration coefficient . b-value is used to estimate
    the vapor conductance, (Eq. (7)). It is a function of fruit load and changes from
    year to year and as the trees grow older (Osroosh et al., 2014). b-value was determined
    by minimizing the MAE between the simulated and measured values of during mid-season
    (DOY = 143–243) of 2007, 2008 and 2013 (Table 1). The b-value in 2007 was also
    used to estimate in other years (second row in 2008 and 2013 in Table 1). Midday
    values of measured and predicted canopy and air temperature differences (1-h mean)
    for two years of field investigations are depicted in Fig. 2a–b. Considering the
    apple trees were well-watered, midday was expected to represent the NWSBL for
    the growing season. The average mid-season values for 2007, 2008, and 2013 were
    estimated to be 0.94  , 0.50  and 0.41  with corresponding b-values of 8.2, 5.0
    and 2.6, respectively. The use of b-value in 2007 to estimate and in other years
    resulted in relatively large discrepancy between and . This is one of the reasons
    why CWSI might not reach a zero value even when the trees are well-watered. The
    adaptive algorithm, however, was expected to resolve this issue by finding the
    actual NWSBL by following the trend of CWSI. Table 1. Comparison of predicted
    potential canopy and air temperature difference ( ) and observed ( ). The value
    of b (first row in each year) was obtained by minimizing the MAE between and during

    years (second row in 2008 and 2013). Year b gv (mol m−2 s−1) MAE (°C) RMSE (°C)

    ( ) and predicted ( ) canopy and air temperature differences (daily mean) during
    growing season (DOY = 110–275) in (a) 2007 and 2008 (b). The predictions ( ) were
    within a degree of in the experimental years with average MAEs of 1.0 °C, 0.9
    °C and 0.5 °C in 2007, 2008 and 2013, respectively (Table 1). Moreover, the mean
    prediction errors in 2008 and 2013 were better than that of measurement errors
    (2008: ; 2013: ) while in 2007, RMSE was about half degree (0.5 °C) higher than
    the measurement error . As the predictions agreed relatively well with the measurements
    during mid-season when nearly equals (Osroosh et al., 2015), it was concluded
    that the significant difference between early-season and was most probably caused
    by the error in the measurements of canopy temperature. Due to incomplete canopy
    growth during early-season thermal readings are affected by the soil background
    with temperatures much higher than canopies (O’Shaughnessy et al., 2012). This
    led to erroneous canopy temperature measurements which was more severe in 2008.
    , and were calculated for typical sunny days for non-stressed apple trees at three
    occasions including early, mid and late in the season in 2007 and 2008 (Fig. 3).
    As it can be seen, reached its potential value early in the morning during early-season
    (beyond days when canopy temperature measurements were associated with considerable
    error) and shifted towards afternoon with potential occurring late in the morning/noon
    on a mid-season day and afternoon/midday on a late-season day. A similar pattern
    was detected in many other days during the experimental years. This pattern has
    also been previously reported in apple trees by Tokei and Dunkel (2005). This
    could be perhaps considered as another source of error once solar noon/midday
    is used for detecting water stress especially early in the season. We, however,
    followed the traditional approach and justified it by the fact that irrigation
    events were scheduled during mid- and late-season of 2013. Download : Download

    3.2. Soil water status The use of double laterals for each tree and Silt Loam
    soil type allowed for a large wetted area of approximately 2–3 m wide (Keller
    and Bliesner, 1990) with the soil surface layer wet as a result of irrigations.
    Depending on soil water content, neutron probe can have a sensing volume of up
    to 4.2 m3 being large enough to meet required precision for research and irrigation
    scheduling purposes (Evett et al., 2009). Taking these into account and the fact
    that access tubes were installed at the center of the wetted area, soil water
    spatial and temporal variability was not an issue. The total amount of irrigation
    water automatically scheduled to the individual plots within the CWSI-DT treatment
    showed some variability. The total irrigation water scheduled for Plot A was about
    32% and 36% more than Plot B and Plot C , respectively. Although the amount of
    applied water to Plot A was larger than the other two plots, soil water content
    was within the well-watered range in the three plots with no signs of over irrigation.
    As depicted in Fig. 4a, the mean soil water depletion under the CWSI-DT treatment
    did not exceed the maximum allowed depletion for apple trees . The variability
    of applied irrigation water in the plots of the NP treatment was 37 mm which was
    slightly less compared to the CWSI-DT treatment . There was no significant difference
    between the means of applied irrigation water in the CWSI-DT and NP treatments

    to the well-watered range with occasions of minor under irrigation (Fig. 4b).

    season of 2013, there were occasional days with overcast sky (Fig. 5). Rainfall
    from May through September totaled 48 mm, most of which (43 mm) occurred in July.
    The 2013 season was a relatively warmer year compared to the 2007 and 2008 growing
    periods. In 2013, the trees maintained relatively high solar noon over the period
    of the experiment with fluctuations mainly driven by the weather conditions (Fig.
    6a). There was no detectable difference between measurements of two sample leaves
    on an individual tree. Solar noon values were limited to a range with a minimum
    (mean) of −1.1 MPa and maximum (mean) of −0.35 MPa which was in agreement with
    the reference values reported in well-watered woody plants in general (De Swaef
    et al., 2009) and apple trees specifically (Naor and Cohen, 2003). Midday measured
    in the plots under the CWSI-DT treatment during the period of irrigation (mid
    to late summer) followed the course of change very closely (Fig. 6a–b). Download

    weather conditions. The highest variability in was observed on days with low atmospheric
    demand (i.e. humid, cold and/or overcast) when the signal-to-noise ratio was low
    (Jones, 2004). In this situation, slight error in the measurement of canopy temperature
    led to a high SEM of up to 0.47. Another reason for the variability was the fact
    that, although the plots were within the allowed water depletion they were under
    different levels of soil water stress. More stressed trees show a more pronounced
    change in canopy temperature in response to rapid changes in radiation on cloudy
    days (Agam et al., 2013b). To study the relationship between and , all data from
    the three plots under the CWSI-DT treatment were pooled together. The linear regression

    glance, the relationship between and (Fig. 7a) seems to be inverted as higher/lower
    values correspond with higher/lower CWSI values. Our results, however, were similar
    to the observations of Gonzalez-Dugo et al. Gonzalez-Dugoa et al. (2014) for mandarin
    and orange. This misleading relationship can be explained by the availability
    of water in the soil and atmospheric demand as discussed by Testi et al. (2008)
    for pistachio. Considering the trees were maintained well-watered, atmospheric
    condition played the main role in the variations of (Abrisqueta et al., 2015).
    Thus, intense transpiration on days with high atmospheric demand (warmer, drier
    conditions (DOY < 261)) led to lower values whereas under more humid, cooler conditions
    (DOY ⩾ 261), when the transpiration rate was low, showed to be higher (Fereres
    and Goldhamer, 2003, Doltra et al., 2007). CWSI is also a function of relative
    transpiration (Jackson et al., 1981: where and are the actual and potential transpiration,
    respectively) which means both transpiration and atmospheric demand determine
    CWSI value. As discussed, on a humid and cool day may result in high CWSI value.
    Under high atmospheric demand and well-watered condition, on the other hand, CWSI
    will be closer to 0. This relationship is not valid for trees under deficit irrigation
    (limiting soil water availability). 3.4. Control algorithm response Taking values
    were calculated using meteorological and thermal data for fully-irrigated apple
    trees in the growing seasons of 2007 and 2008. Following the farmers in the region,
    the value of was also set for 20 °C. Both the traditional and new algorithms were
    applied to the generated data series at the end of the season for evaluation purposes.
    As in the conventional definition of CWSI threshold, is a site and crop specific
    value. Here, we took the same approach as in the conventional CWSI threshold to
    determine . No reference values have been established for most crops including
    apple trees; however, values close to zero are expected to maintain crops far
    from being stressed. Higher thresholds are normally used in deficit irrigation
    (O’Shaughnessy et al., 2012). For the purpose of this study, the control system
    was set for a conservative value of which was similar to the amplitude of midday
    CWSI variations/fluctuations in mid-season in 2007 and 2008 . The net irrigation
    depth was also set to 16.5 mm to ensure irrigation events replenished the soil
    water deficit. Considering the low application rate of the drip irrigation system
    (i.e. 1.1 mm h−1), it took about 15 h to deliver 16.5 mm of water to the trees.
    The response of the control algorithm in the plots of the CWSI-DT treatment (i.e.
    Plots A, B and C) is illustrated in Fig. 8a–c. On some days during the growing
    season of 2013, was reset to “1” by the irrigation control algorithm (dotted circles
    in Fig. 8a). This was in response to high RH and low radiation (DOY = 214, 249)
    which made it difficult to detect water stress, or low (DOY > 265) which reduced
    transpiration to a negligible rate. The days on which the measurements of took
    place included very hot, very cool, overcast and very humid days. Download : Download

    in 2013: Plot A (a), plot B (b), and plot C (c). The dotted circles in the first
    figure (a) indicate days on which the irrigation algorithm decided not to irrigate
    due to low temperature (no water stress) or high relative humidity (not possible
    to detect water stress). The dotted circles in the second figure (b) indicate
    days on which the irrigation algorithm stopped irrigating the plot after three
    successive irrigation events (to avoid excessive watering) and reset the base
    line . Three irrigation events fulfilled , thus after each three irrigations was
    reset to “one”. The dotted circles in the third figure (c) indicate days on which
    the irrigation algorithm detected water stress and scheduled irrigation. CWSI
    dropped to values below the threshold after one or two successive irrigation events.
    On a very hot but very humid day (DOY = 219), both and reached their lowest values
    at solar noon. On this day, high RH and high solar radiation were driving transpiration
    to opposite directions. The value of on this day was less than in all of the plots.
    It is known that readings made under unusually cold or overcast days should not
    be relied on for the purpose of irrigation scheduling (Mitcham and Elkins, 2007,
    Agam et al., 2013b). Similarly, interpretation of values calculated on days with
    low atmospheric demand (i.e. humid, cold, overcast) needs to be carried out with
    caution. Such a situation occurred on DOY = 275 (Fig. 8b). On a very cool, relatively
    humid and overcast day like DOY = 275, both midday and reached their highest values.
    On moderately humid, overcast or cool days, on the other hand, had a value close
    to “1” (for example ) and higher than . This borderline condition was detected
    as stress by the algorithm. In some cases, this condition continued to persist
    for several days. The blind act of the control system on these days led to scheduling
    irrigation events. To avoid excessive watering, however, the control system stopped
    irrigating a plot after three successive irrigation events (dotted circles in
    Fig. 8b). This was carried out by resetting to “1” after each three irrigation
    events which expected to fulfill . Regular days on which the algorithm detected
    water stress and scheduled irrigation are illustrated in Fig. 8c. It can be seen
    that dropped to values below the threshold after one or two successive irrigation
    events. The thermal readings for plot displayed a relatively large discrepancy.
    This was not unexpected considering the use of only one IRT per plot and a relatively
    large non-uniformity observed among the trees in terms of fruit load and shoot
    growth in 2013. This resulted in comparatively dissimilar patterns and consequently
    in the three plots of the CWSI-DT treatment. Interestingly, the variations of
    in 2013 (average of three plots; Fig. 9) were similar to 2007 and 2008, however
    the mean was higher . A higher mean in 2013 was mainly due to less fruit load
    on the trees and consequently a smaller canopy and air temperature difference
    (Osroosh et al., 2015). The fluctuations of , on the other hand, may be mainly
    attributed to thermal and microclimatic measurements and partially to the physiology
    of apple trees as similarly observed in citrus trees (Gonzalez-Dugoa et al., 2014).
    The results showed that the set threshold constant was large enough to capture
    natural fluctuations caused by noise, errors, weather conditions, etc. in non-stressed
    conditions and lower than a value causing water stress. Overall, compared to the
    conventional CWSI method, the CWSI-DT irrigation algorithm yielded consistently
    fewer false irrigation signals on cloudy, humid, or cool/cold days and adapted
    well to the changing conditions of apple trees. Download : Download high-res image

    to the traditional definition of CWSI threshold. The algorithm helped the trees
    reach their potential transpiration by providing them with enough water and observing
    their subsequent response. The adaptive nature of the algorithm, through the use
    of a dynamic non-stressed threshold, allowed for monitoring the water demand of
    the trees in real-time, avoiding wrong stress signals caused by the effect of
    the wind, shoot growth or other unwanted factors. It was minimally impacted by
    CWSI response to temporary atmospheric conditions, IRT installation and measurement
    errors, apple tree architecture and model uncertainties. The new irrigation algorithm
    also yielded significantly fewer false irrigation signals on cloudy, humid, or
    cool/cold days and adapted well to the changing conditions of apple trees. It
    was concluded that the performance of the irrigation control system was satisfactory.
    In the current study, we mainly focused on developing an adaptive algorithm capable
    of detecting erroneous irrigation signals or limiting water delivery under low
    atmospheric demands rather than improving CWSI baseline estimations. While it
    has been developed for and evaluated in apple trees, the proposed adaptive control
    algorithm is independent of crop or irrigation method because of its logical basis.
    Application of the new algorithm can also prevent over-irrigation during early-season
    period when crop canopies are under development, and thus the soil background
    might interfere with canopy temperature measurements. It is concluded that the
    crop water stress index can become more efficient in conjunction with a well-developed
    control algorithm. This is an initial step towards implementing plant-based irrigation
    scheduling in apple trees. It has the potential to improve water use efficiency,
    which leads to increased production, reduced production costs, reduced pumping
    energy requirements, and improved fruit quality. Acknowledgments This research

    and content Abstract The use of digital infrared thermography and thermometry
    to investigate early crop water stress offers a producer improved management tools
    to avoid yield declines or to deal with variability in crop water status. This
    study used canopy temperature data to investigate whether an empirical crop water
    stress index could be used to monitor spatial and temporal crop water stress.
    Different irrigation treatment amounts (100%, 67%, 33%, and 0% of full replenishment
    of soil water to field capacity to a depth of 1.5 m) were applied by a center
    pivot system to soybean (Glycine max L.) in 2004 and 2005, and to cotton (Gossypium
    hirsutum L.) in 2007 and 2008. Canopy temperature data from infrared thermography
    were used to benchmark the relationship between an empirical crop water stress
    index (CWSIe) and leaf water potential (ΨL) across a block of eight treatment
    plots (of two replications). There was a significant negative linear correlation
    between midday ΨL measurements and the CWSIe after soil water differences due
    to irrigation treatments were well established and during the absence of heavy
    rainfall. Average seasonal CWSIe values calculated for each plot from temperature
    measurements made by infrared thermometer thermocouples mounted on a center pivot
    lateral were inversely related to crop water use with r2 values >0.89 and 0.55
    for soybean and cotton, respectively. There was also a significant inverse relationship
    between the CWSIe and soybean yields in 2004 (r2 = 0.88) and 2005 (r2 = 0.83),
    and cotton in 2007 (r2 = 0.78). The correlations were not significant in 2008
    for cotton. Contour plots of the CWSIe may be used as maps to indicate the spatial
    variability of within-field crop water stress. These maps may be useful for irrigation
    scheduling or identifying areas within a field where water stress may impact crop
    water use and yield. Highlights ► In this study we demonstrate how an empirical
    crop water stress index was related to in situ stress measurements. ► Average
    seasonal empirical CWSI values were inversely related to crop water use and crop
    yield. ► Contour plots of the average seasonal CWSI can be used to map spatial
    variability of within-field crop water stress. Previous article in issue Next

    technologies have potential as tools for monitoring crop water status, predicting
    yields (Idso et al., 1978, Idso et al., 1980, Pinter et al., 1983), improving
    water use efficiency (Evett et al., 1996, Evett et al., 2001, Evett et al., 2006)
    and harvesting methods, and precisely managing irrigation (Wanjura et al., 1995).
    Useful information on crop canopy temperature and water relations can be derived
    from infrared thermography and thermometry. Infrared thermography has been used
    in agriculture as a non-invasive, versatile imaging tool to investigate biotic
    stresses (disease or insect infestation), and abiotic stresses (e.g., nutrient
    and water deficit). Chaerle et al. (2006) combined thermal and chlorophyll fluorescence
    imaging to study spatial and temporal heterogeneity of leaf transpiration and
    photosynthesis. These techniques helped identify pre-symptomatic responses (higher
    chlorophyll intensity co-located with thermal symptoms) and provided diagnosis
    of diseases (fungal and bacterial infections) and abiotic stresses not yet perceptible
    in visible spectrum images. Stoll et al. (2008) used an infrared camera to observe
    thermal responses in grapevine infected with a fungus well in advance of visible
    symptoms. Bulanon et al. (2009) fused digital and thermal images taken of the
    same area to improve the identification of fruit for robotic harvesters. Studies
    involving the analysis of abiotic stresses with thermal imagery include those
    by Jones (1999) and Jones et al. (2002) in which field studies were designed to
    assess the consistency and repeatability of using thermal imagery to measure stomatal
    conductance in grapevine canopies. They concluded that thermography allows for
    semi-automated analysis of large areas of canopy with much more effective replication
    than can be achieved with porometry. Leinonen and Jones (2004) classified thermal
    images to identify leaf area, sunlit, and shaded parts of the canopy. Their methods
    provided improved estimates of temperature distribution across a canopy by separating
    out mixed pixels and reducing the effects of thermal contribution from background,
    and angle of view (Luquet et al., 2003). Leaf water potential measurements became
    routine in the 1960s with the commercialization of pressure chambers (Turner,
    1988) and are considered an accurate and reliable technique to characterize crop
    water stress, leading to their common use in irrigation scheduling (e.g., Alchanatis
    et al., 2009, Kite and Hanson, 1984). These invasive and time consuming in situ
    measurements demonstrate diurnal changes with the minima occurring in mid afternoon
    (Reicosky et al., 1975, Bhattacharya et al., 1994), which is generally the time
    of greatest air temperature and least relative humidity. Cohen et al. (2005) and
    Möeller et al. (2007) used thermal and visible imagery to estimate the crop water
    status of irrigated cotton and wine grapes by calculating an empirical crop water
    stress index, CWSIe: (1) where Tc was the temperature (°C) of the crop (average
    of the leaves within a polygon drawn on a thermographic image) at the time of
    the thermal image, Tw was the average temperature of a wet reference (wetted white
    felt surface) that acted as a substitute for the well-watered base line temperature
    of Idso et al. (1978), and the dry baseline temperature, Tdry, was estimated by
    adding 5 °C to the maximum dry bulb temperature recorded (Möeller et al., 2007)
    for the specific field day. They used the temperature of the artificial wet reference
    as a surrogate for a fully transpiring leaf, i.e., a well-watered crop surface.
    The CWSIe value was then related to leaf water potential (ΨL) measurements. Spatial
    ΨL maps were developed based on predictions from the calculated CWSIe, which were
    themselves derived from canopy temperature maps. Since the wet reference temperature
    (Tw) required in Eq. (1) requires the establishment, maintenance and movement
    of a physical wet reference body, it is difficult to use for routine monitoring.
    An alternative Tw value can be estimated as (Monteith and Unsworth, 1990): (2)
    where Ta is air temperature (°C), es is saturated vapor pressure (Pa) at Ta, ea
    is actual vapor pressure (Pa), Δ is slope (Pa °C−1) of the saturated vapor pressure
    vs. temperature curve evaluated at (Ta), and γ is the psychometric constant (Pa
    °C−1); all evaluated at the time of Tc measurement for the CWSIe. In preliminary
    work, we found that Eq. (2) did not always yield a Tw value that compared well
    with Tw measured on the physical wet reference surface. Since the daily maximum
    dry bulb temperature is used in Eq. (1), and since it represents a sort of potential
    evaporative condition, it may be that it should be used in Eq. (2) as well. Alchanatis
    et al. (2009) found the midday leaf water potential measurements for cotton were
    optimal when mapping water status in cotton using high resolution thermal imaging.
    Their focus was to provide leaf water potential maps to irrigators modeled from
    thermal imagery alone. Ben-Gal et al. (2009) evaluated water stress of differentially
    drip irrigated olive trees on an orchard scale using infrared thermography. Canopy
    temperature measurements extracted from the thermal images were used to calculate
    a CWSI using both empirical and analytical approaches. It was determined that
    there was no significant difference between the two approaches when compared against
    stem leaf water potential, stomatal resistance, and soil water potential measurements.
    Although infrared thermography offers methods for infield spatial mapping, additional
    equipment (plane, helicopter or lift) is needed to obtain the images. Infrared
    thermometry, on the other hand, is currently more economical and infrared thermometers
    (IRTs) do not require a separate platform for crop monitoring when mounted on
    a moving sprinkler system. Crop canopy temperature measured with infrared thermometers
    has been used successfully to monitor plant water stress (Jackson et al., 1981,
    Howell et al., 1984, Sadler et al., 2002, Falkenberg et al., 2007) and, with appropriate
    algorithms, to control irrigation scheduling (Wanjura et al., 1995, Evett et al.,
    1996, Upchurch et al., 1998, Peters and Evett, 2007, O''Shaughnessy and Evett,
    2010). If a thermally based stress index requiring minimal ancillary inputs can
    be developed using ground-based remote sensors, the index may be a cost-effective
    means for timing irrigations or spatially monitoring crop water stress and potential
    yield. Our objectives were to: (1) determine if the CWSIe calculated from infrared
    thermography images can be reliably related to ΨL measurements from soybean and
    cotton taken in differentially irrigated treatment plots; (2) investigate the
    use of maximum daily dry bulb temperature, Tdry, as a substitute for air temperature
    at the time of measurement, Ta, in Eq. (2) estimates of wet reference surface
    temperature, Tw; (3) investigate the relationships between the CWSIe, calculated
    using data from IRTs mounted on a moving irrigation system, with seasonal crop
    water use and crop yield across differentially irrigated treatment plots; (4)
    investigate the strength of the CWSIe-yield relationship as a function of time
    since differential irrigation treatments were started; and (5) develop contour
    plots of the CWSIe as a means to represent within-field spatial and temporal crop
    water stress. 2. Materials and methods 2.1. Agronomy This study was conducted
    during 2004–2008 at the USDA Agricultural Research Service Conservation and Production
    Research Laboratory, Bushland, Texas (35° 11′ N, 102° 06′ W, 1174 m above mean
    sea level). Crop water status was controlled spatially by full and deficit irrigation
    flow rates accomplished by appropriate sizing of drop hose nozzles (Allen et al.,
    2000). Irrigations were applied with a center pivot irrigation system using low
    energy precision application (LEPA) drag socks (Lyle and Bordovsky, 1983) in every
    other furrow. Treatment plots were arranged in six blocks arc-wise around half
    of the center pivot circle (Fig. 1) with alternating blocks for manual and automatic
    irrigation scheduling, which was part of a separate irrigation management study
    (Peters and Evett, 2008, O''Shaughnessy and Evett, 2010). Within each block, irrigation
    amount treatments were randomly assigned with two replications arranged radially
    from the pivot point in blocks. Radial and arc-wise blocking was designed to allow
    for effects of position along the lateral on irrigation application rate and to
    minimize effects of possible runoff. Soybean (Glycine max L.), variety Pioneer
    94B731 RR (Roundup Ready), was planted on day of year (DOY) 152 (May 31) in 2004
    and variety 94M90 RR was planted on DOY 143 (May 23) in 2005. Cotton (Gossypium
    hirsutum L.), variety Paymaster 2280 was planted on DOY 149 (May 29) in 2007,
    and Delta Pine 117 B2RF was planted on DOY 141 in 2008 (both varieties were Bollgard
    II® Roundup Ready®, Land Co., Scott, Miss.). The crops were grown in concentric
    rows with beds spaced 0.76-m apart. The width of each treatment plot was 18 rows
    across. Download : Download full-size image Fig. 1. Experimental layout under
    the 3-span center pivot system shown for the (a) 2004 growing season; and (b)
    the 2005 and 2007 growing seasons. Pie-slice-shaped sections are blocked by irrigation
    control method (manual vs. automatic). Each block contains all irrigation amount
    treatments with two replications, 100%, 67% and 33% of full replenishment of soil
    water to field capacity and a no-irrigation ((Dry) treatment, which are randomized
    radially within each section and run concentrically. (Not shown is the plot plan
    for the 2008 growing season. The north half of the pivot field was cropped, but
    the order of irrigation treatment amounts was different from that of 2004.) 2.2.
    Irrigation scheduling and crop water use determination For the manual irrigation
    control treatment, irrigation amounts were 0%, 33%, 67%, and 100% of full replenishment
    of soil water in the root zone to field capacity (treatments designated I0%, I33%,
    I67% and I100%). Soil water content was determined weekly using a neutron probe
    in 0.2-m increments down to 2.4 m in the I100% treatment plots. In all other treatment
    plots, soil water was measured once every 30 days. Access tubes were placed in
    a row in the center of each plot. The neutron probe was field calibrated to accuracy
    of better than 0.01 m3 m–3, resulting in separate calibrations from three distinct
    soil layers, Ap, Bt and Btca, using methods described by Evett (2008). Irrigations
    for the manual control treatment were applied on odd DOY, over 3 days of the week
    if necessary. Any rainfall occurring prior to irrigation of the total amount for
    the week was subtracted from the required total. Irrigations for the automatic
    control treatment were applied on even DOY. Seasonal crop water use (ET) in each
    plot was calculated using the soil water balance equation (Evett, 2002): (3) where
    the change in soil water storage (ΔS, mm) was evaluated as the soil profile water
    content measured to 2.4-m depth, P was precipitation (measured at the adjacent
    weather station), I was irrigation (determined by nozzle discharge rate, horizontal
    spacing, lateral rotational speed and run times), F was deep flux into or out
    of the control volume at 2.4-m depth (assumed zero), and R was the sum of runoff
    and runon (assumed zero because furrow dikes were used to control runoff). Irrigation
    was scheduled for the automatic irrigation control treatment using the Time Temperature
    Threshold (TTT) method for irrigation management and control (Peters and Evett,
    2008), which is similar to the Biologically Identified Optimal Temperature Interactive
    Console (BIOTIC, Upchurch et al., 1998) method. Because irrigations were only
    possible every other day, the full irrigation level for automatic treatments in
    the I100% treatment was twice the crop''s peak daily ET rate (2 × 10 = 20 mm)
    so that irrigations could replenish water used by the crop even during the peak
    water use period. Automatic irrigation scheduling protocols, infrared thermometer
    sensors (IRTs) (Exergen model IRt/c.5:1-Type T, Watertown, Mass.). Automatic irrigations
    were triggered only after canopy temperatures exceeded 27 °C for more than 256
    min for soybean; and 28 °C for more than 452 min for cotton. Time thresholds were
    accumulated in a 24-h period on an odd-numbered DOY. Stationary IRTs were located
    in the field within automatically irrigated treatment plots and provided reference
    crop canopy temperatures. The irrigation control treatments were generally started
    in mid July when fraction of vegetative cover was approximately 20% (Table 1).

    July 18 (200) The TTT plant feedback method of irrigation scheduling depends on
    canopy temperature measurement; and our implementation is fully explained in Peters
    and Evett (2008). It is well established that the TTT method results in yields
    and water use efficiencies at least as great or greater than those obtained with
    the heretofore acknowledged best scientific irrigation scheduling practice using
    the neutron probe (Evett et al., 1996, Evett et al., 2000, Evett et al., 2001,
    Evett et al., 2006, O''Shaughnessy and Evett, 2010, Peters and Evett, 2004a, Peters
    and Evett, 2006, Peters and Evett, 2007, Peters and Evett, 2008). Note that the
    TTT automatic irrigation control method is discussed here mostly to complete the
    methods description. Manual irrigations were applied weekly on odd-numbered DOY
    at treatment levels of 33%, 67%, and 100% of full replenishment of soil water
    in the top 1.5 m of soil to field capacity (treatments designated MI33, MI67 and
    MI100); and a non-irrigated treatment designated MI0 was included. Manual irrigations
    were based on neutron probe readings taken weekly. The TTT method was a means
    to apply irrigations automatically; herein the present report focuses on CWSIe
    relationships to irrigation amount and control method, leaf water potential, crop
    water use and yield, and the strength of these relationships over the course of
    the irrigation season. 2.3. In situ measurements and thermographic image analysis
    In situ thermographic and ΨL measurements were limited to plots located on the
    outer edge of the field to avoid damaging the crop with the hydraulic lift that
    was used to position the thermographic camera over the plots. Thermal images and
    ΨL measurements were not taken in 2004 since the pressure chamber and thermal
    imager were not available until 2005. However, infrared thermometer measurements
    of canopy temperature were made as explained in the next section. Leaf stem water
    potential was measured during the 2005, 2007, and 2008 growing seasons (dates
    in Table 2) using a pressure chamber (PMS Instrument Company, Albany, Ore.). Ten
    measurements were made per plot near solar noon in plots 1 through 8 (Fig. 1).
    Samples were limited to eight plots because of manpower and time constraints.
    Since the four water treatments were replicated twice in these eight plots, and
    since 10 measurements of stem water potential were made in each plot, replication
    of stem water potential measurements for each water treatment was 20, considered
    adequate for this purpose. Table 2. Days of year (DOY) and dates of in situ measurements,
    leaf water potential (ΨL) and thermal images. Growing season Dates in DOY and
    (month and day) 2005 215 (August 3); 237 (August 25); 258 (September 15) 2007
    223 (August 11); 240 (August 28); 247 (September 4); 256 (September 13) 2008 203
    (July 21); 213 (July 31); 261 (September 17) Leaves were excised with a razor
    blade, wrapped in aluminum foil, and placed in an ice chest until ΨL was measured.
    All ΨL measurements were performed within 1 h of excision. The number of in situ
    sampling dates per growing season was limited due to the amount of labor required
    to perform the tasks involved. A minimum of three in situ sampling dates were
    chosen so as to sample over different crop growth stages. For example, for soybean,
    sampling was conducted at flowering, pod formation, and mature pod stages; for
    cotton, sampling was done near square formation, after cutout and at the time
    of boll formation. The actual days were selected at random when afternoon cloud
    cover was minimal. Digital images were taken with a thermal infrared camera and
    corresponding software (model SC2000 and ThermaCAM Researcher Pro 2.8 software,
    FLIR Systems, Billerica, Mass.) on the same sampling days and time as the ΨL measurements,
    near 1300 CST. Overlapping images were taken simultaneously with an RGB (red–blue–green)
    digital camera (model DSC-S85, Sony Electronics, Inc., Oradell, NJ) in 2005 and
    2007. In 2008, digital images were taken with a camera sensitive in the near infrared
    as well as in the visible RGB wavelengths and equipped with a near-infrared pass
    filter (model IS-1, FUJI, Edison, NJ). Cameras were mounted alongside the thermal
    imager to aid in image analysis. Images were taken at a nadir view angle from
    a hydraulic platform, 7.0 m above the ground. For each thermometric image acquisition,
    cardboard crosses covered with aluminum foil were placed in the plant canopy to
    define the boundaries of interest. The crosses appeared as colder areas in the
    thermometric images and as bright areas in the RGB images. Also imaged was the
    wet reference to simulate a non-stressed crop, which was a 27 by 42 cm wet surface
    constructed from a semi-permeable plastic foam block covered with white polyester
    felt resting in a basin filled with deionized water. The foam blocks and felt
    were submerged to re-wet them at least one min before images were taken. Capillary
    action kept the fabric wetted for several minutes. The wet reference was located
    in the center of the field-of-view of the image when placed in a treatment plot.
    Canopy temperature for the CWSIe was determined by averaging three different polygon
    areas from different crop rows within a single thermal image (e.g., Fig. 2a, c,
    and e). It was assumed that this method would be similar to the canopy temperatures
    recorded by IRTs mounted on the moving center pivot system. Download : Download

    of crop rows, the artificial wet reference (AWR), soil, and individual leaves
    for: (a) and (b) soybean 2005 (DOY 258), I33%; (c) and (d) cotton 2007 (DOY 247),
    I0%; and (e) and (f) cotton 2008 (DOY 213), I100%. (b and d) are from a digital
    RGB camera without filtering; and (f) is from a digital camera that is sensitive
    in the near infrared and was taken with a filter that excluded wavelengths > near
    infrared. Shaded soils ranged between approximately 30 °C and 42 °C, sunlit soils
    were generally >50 °C, and crop canopy temperatures within polygons were between
    30 °C and 35 °C. The extracted wet reference temperatures were average values
    for the unshaded areas of the wet reference body. The digital photographs were
    used to improve digital analysis and to discriminate between vegetative and soil
    pixels of similar temperature (example in Fig. 2b). The empirical wet reference
    crop water stress index, CWSIe, was calculated using Eq. (1), with Tw being the
    average temperature of the wet reference and Tdry being estimated by adding 5
    °C to the maximum dry bulb temperature recorded. The CWSIe ranged from 0 (no stress)
    to nearly 1 (stressed), at which point Tc was nearly equal to Tdry. The CWSIe
    values calculated from thermal imagery represented a one-time-of-day measurement
    only and were not used to calculate the seasonal average CWSIe values discussed
    later. 2.4. Infrared thermometry In all four years (2004–2008), the CWSIe was
    also determined using canopy temperature measurements obtained using IRTs. Sixteen
    IRTs (Exergen model IRT/c.5, Watertown, Mass.) with a 5:1 field of view were mounted
    on masts attached to the center pivot lateral, with two sensors facing into each
    treatment plot pointed towards the canopy at an oblique angle. One sensor was
    mounted at the outside edge of each plot and one sensor on the inside edge so
    that the sensors were aimed nearly towards each other from opposite sides of the
    plot to reduce sun angle effects on the average temperature. The center pivot
    passed over each plot during different times of the day, which required a method
    to determine the canopy temperature, Ts, at 13:00 CST in order to calculate the
    CWSIe at 13:00 CST. We used the scaling procedure described by Peters and Evett
    (2004b): (4) where Te (°C) was the predawn canopy temperature; Tref (°C) was the
    reference canopy temperature at the same time interval as Ts (°C) (i.e., 13:00
    CST); Trmt,t was the one-time-of-day canopy temperature measurement at the plot
    (remote location, denoted by subscript rmt) at any daylight time t measured by
    the IRTs on the pivot lateral; and Tref,t (°C) was the measured reference temperature
    for the time t that the plot (remote) temperature measurement was taken. The diel
    Tref,t was obtained using stationary IRTs mounted on fixed masts in the fully
    irrigated treatment plots. Plot-mean scaled canopy temperature measurements, Ts,
    for each treatment plot were substituted for crop canopy temperature, Tc, in Eq.
    (1). Signals from IRTs were measured and recorded every 10 s and averaged and
    stored each min. Average seasonal CWSIe values for each of the 48 plots were calculated
    from data measured on the days the pivot moved using scaled canopy temperatures
    (Ts) estimated for 13:00 CST. Again, the CWSIe was calculated using Tdry as the
    maximum daily dry-bulb temperature (Tmax) + 5 °C. The wet reference temperature,
    Tw, was estimated using Eq. (2). The value of γ in Eq. (2) was estimated at a
    barometric pressure of 88.91 kPa. In a sub-study, we evaluated whether Tdry should
    be used in place of Ta in Eq. (2) by comparing the result of Eq. (2) to measurements
    of physical wet reference surface temperatures. 2.5. Data analysis Linear regressions
    of CWSIe vs. leaf water potential were developed using temperature data extracted
    from thermal images. The average seasonal CWSIe values, calculated using temperature
    data measured using IRTs on the pivot lateral and with Tw estimated at 13:00 CST
    (Eqs. (3) and (4)), were linearly regressed against irrigation treatment amounts,
    seasonal water use (obtained by soil water balance), and crop yield. An analysis
    of variance was used to determine if irrigation amounts (0, 33, 67, and 100%)
    had a significant impact on the CWSIe when grouped by irrigation control method
    (manual vs. automatic). The Bonferroni t-test was used to compare whether mean
    CWSIe values were the same across irrigation treatment amounts and irrigation
    scheduling methods (manual or automatic). Analysis was performed using the ANOVA
    and SAS PROC MIXED procedures (SAS Institute Inc., 2007). We tested the homogeneity
    of regression coefficients for the manual and automatic methods of irrigation
    scheduling, when regressing water use and crop yields against the CWSIe, using
    methods discussed by Gomez and Gomez (1984). All significant differences are reported
    at the 5% probability level. 3. Results and discussion 3.1. Irrigations, crop
    water use and meteorological data Average irrigations, change in soil water content,
    seasonal ETc and climatic data are summarized in Table 3. For soybean, average
    irrigation levels and average seasonal ETc across irrigation treatment amounts
    were greater for the manual method. The 2004 growing season experienced below
    average temperatures and above average rainfall, while in 2005, the reverse occurred
    with total rainfall being nearly 50% less (Table 3). Overall soybean ETc was higher
    in 2004 than in 2005, and initial soil water levels for both years were higher
    than the final soil water levels. Table 3. Average irrigation amounts, change

    water balance calculations was based on rainfall (27 mm) occurring between initial
    and final soil water readings. Reviewing climatological data for the cotton growing
    seasons, extreme weather conditions prevailed in 2008. During the months of May
    and June, high winds and elevated daily air temperatures resulted in a 6% increase
    in ETo as compared to the same period in 2007. A cumulative rainfall amount of
    70 mm occurred from August 11 (DOY 224) through August 21 (DOY 234) in 2008. During
    this time, the sky was consistently overcast. In August of 2007, 56% of the rainfall
    occurred on the second day of the month (DOY 214) followed by two weeks of dry
    hot weather. Also of notable difference, in 2007, maximum daily air temperatures
    and ETo were highest for the months of June through August. In contrast, the average
    maximum daily air temperatures for July and August in 2008 dropped nearly 3.5
    °C and 2 °C from June''s average maximum daily air temperature. Soil water levels
    were higher at the end of growing season 2008 than at its start. Microclimatological
    measurements (Table 4) for each sampling day showed that air temperature was highest
    during the first two sampling days of the season and decreased by between 5 °C
    and 7 °C on the last sampling day. DOY 240 in 2007 was periodically cloudy, and
    care was taken to capture thermal images only when the clouds were not blocking
    the sun. The greatest maximum average air temperature and reference evapotranspiration
    (ETo) occurred in July and August for each growing season when the average midday
    temperatures were >30 °C and either wind speed was nearly 5.0 m s−1 or relative
    humidity was <30%. Table 4. Average climatic data at midday (1200–1500 h), cumulative

    Thermal and digital images taken from the hydraulic lift over the 8 treatment
    plots enabled a clear distinction between shaded and sunlit soil and shaded and
    sunlit vegetation and their corresponding temperatures (examples for 2005, 2007
    and 2008 shown in Fig. 2). For the sampling days listed in Table 2, the CWSIe
    calculated from digital thermal imagery over plots 1–8 were compared with corresponding
    ΨL measurements. On most sampling days, ΨL decreased linearly as the CWSIe, calculated
    from thermal imager data, increased (Fig. 3). The most negative slope occurred
    in 2005 on DOY 258, where variability in ΨL was well explained by the CWSIe, (Fig.
    3a, r2 = 0.93). The inverse linear relationship was consistent throughout the
    entire 2007 growing season (r2 = 0.88), and on DOY 213, 2008 with r2 = 0.81 (Fig.
    3b). These linear relationships were similar to those reported by Jackson (1991)
    and Ben-Asher et al. (1992) when investigating plant water stress in cotton using
    the empirical CWSI developed by Idso et al. (1981). Cohen et al. (2005) and Möeller
    et al. (2007) also described similar relationships when comparing ΨL to the CWSIe
    (where the artificial wet reference was substituted for the non-stressed baseline
    temperature) for cotton and grapevine plants, respectively. Download : Download
    full-size image Fig. 3. The inverse relationship between leaf water potential
    taken at midday and the empirical crop water stress index, CWSIe calculated using
    temperatures extracted from thermometric images in treatment plots 1–8 during
    the growing season: (a) 2005, soybean; and (b) 2007 and 2008, cotton. When ΨL
    was not significantly related to the CWSIe, the cause was either the inability
    to quickly establish spatial stress across the irrigation treatment plots after
    different irrigation treatments began (sampling days on DOY 215, 2005 and DOY
    203, 2008 were 2 and 3 days after the start of differential irrigation treatments)
    or heavy and continuous rainfall that eliminated treatment effects (DOY 237, 2005).
    Measurements on DOY 261, 2008 showed some variability in ΨL, but smaller differences
    in CWSIe values than would be expected from the regression relationships, meaning
    that crop canopy temperature did not vary much across irrigation amount treatments.
    Irrigation was terminated 36 days prior to this last sampling date, leaving little
    plant available soil water for cotton plants in all treatment plots, which meant
    that all plants were stressed and CWSIe values could be expected to be similar
    across plots. Overall, these results showed that the CWSIe was a good indicator
    of in-field spatial crop water stress, but results may be rendered inconclusive
    by the timing of the CWSIe (too soon after differential irrigation treatment has
    begun, after a heavy rainfall, or when all plants are stressed such that Tc approaches
    Tdry). 3.3. CWSIe and irrigation amount treatments The effects of irrigation amount
    treatments were expected to produce different levels of water-stress, whereby
    the higher amounts would result in less stress. This effect was verified by CWSIe
    values calculated for treatment plots using canopy temperatures extracted from
    thermal images. For the example of Fig. 2, the CWSIe was calculated to be 0.76,
    0.61, and 0.40 in irrigation treatment levels of I0%, I33%, and I100%, respectively.
    The same trend of decreasing CWSIe as irrigation amount increased, this time calculated
    using data from IRTs on the pivot, occurred in all four years (Table 5). In 2005
    through 2007, the CWSIe means for the higher irrigation treatments (I67% and I100%),
    although numerically quite different, were not significantly different. This is
    likely due to some unevenness across plots in initial soil profile water content,
    which resulted in some I67% plots having nearly the same profile water content
    as some I100% plots. In 2008, the mean value for the I0% treatment was not significantly
    greater than that for the I67% treatment. This was not surprising due to the high
    amount of rainfall received during the boll filling stage. Seasonal mean CWSIe
    values were similar at any irrigation amount for both automatic irrigation and
    manual irrigation; and the pattern of statistical differences among irrigation
    amount treatments was identical for both irrigation control methods (Table 5).
    Indeed, the seasonal average CWSIe between the two irrigation control methods
    (manual and automatic) was not significantly different across the same irrigation
    treatments (statistics not shown in Table 5). Table 5. Average seasonal empirical
    crop water stress index (CWSIe) value derived from IRT measurementsa for each
    irrigation method and treatment amount. Means were tested for differences within

    water use, and yield Estimates of wet reference temperatures calculated using
    Eq. (2) with Tdry in place of Ta were closer in value to the measured artificial
    wet reference values extracted from the thermal imagery than were Tw values estimated
    using actual Ta at the time of measurement (Table 6). Therefore, Tdry was used
    in place of Ta in Eq. (2) for all estimates of Tw used to calculate CWSIe using
    IRT data. Table 6. Wet references temperatures extracted from thermal images for

    using mixed statistical models with the growing season year and irrigation control
    method (i.e., manual vs. automatic) treated as random effects. The growing season
    inter-annual variability was a significant factor influencing water use and yields,
    so we analyzed these relationships separately by years. Overall, the irrigation
    control methods (manual vs. automatic) did not significantly affect yields and
    water use, with the one exception of 2008 cotton as discussed below. As expected,
    significant negative linear relationships existed between crop water use and the
    CWSIe for each irrigation season (Fig. 4a–d), similar to results reported by Dogan
    et al. (2007). Water use efficiency was significantly greater for the automatic
    control plots in 2008 due to less total irrigation amounts applied during the
    season (Fig. 4d). Download : Download full-size image Fig. 4. Negative linear
    relationship between crop water use and the season-mean CWSIe for each season:
    (a) soybean 2004; (b) soybean 2005; (c) cotton 2007; and (d) cotton 2008 for manual
    and automatic irrigation control methods. Linear regression analysis between the
    CWSIe and crop yield for each growing season explained 88% and 83% of the variation
    in soybean yields in 2004 and 2005, respectively (Fig. 5a and b). A single regression
    line was used to represent the data since the slopes between manual and automatic
    control treatment plots were not significantly different with 44 degrees of freedom
    for the 5% level of significance. In general, the plots experiencing the smallest
    seasonal average CWSIe resulted in the greatest water use and yields. This same
    trend was reported by Nielsen (1990) for soybean grown in Akron, Colorado under
    irrigation scheduling based on varying CWSI values. Similar to our results, Dogan
    et al. (2007) reported yields in the range of 0.36–0.37 kg m−2 for fully irrigated
    soybean (I100%) and average yields of 0.19 kg m−2 (I50%), 0.10 kg m−2 (I25%),
    and 0.03 kg m−2 (I0%) for deficit irrigation treatment levels. Download : Download
    full-size image Fig. 5. Inverse linear correlations between the season-mean CWSIe
    and yields for both manually and automatically irrigated plots: dry grain yields
    for (a) soybean, 2004; (b) soybean 2005; and lint yields for (c) cotton, 2007;
    and (d) cotton, 2008. For cotton, the seasonal mean CWSIe explained 78% of the
    yield variations for all treatment plots in 2007 (Fig. 5c). Again, there was no
    significant difference between the regression coefficients for the manual and
    automatic methods of irrigation with 44 degrees of freedom for the 5% level. Similar
    to soybean, cotton lint yield was significantly related to growing season inter-annual
    variability. The 2007 linear relationship between lint yield (kg m−2) and the
    seasonal mean CWSIe, Yield = −0.22CWSIe + 0.24, was similar to the lint yield
    (LY, kg m−2) relationships reported by Reginato (1983), LY = −0.21CWSI + 0.18,
    and Howell et al. (1984), LY = −0.19CWSI + 0.18, for conventional row cotton with
    1.0 m spacing, where the CWSI was calculated using the empirical method of Idso
    et al. (1981). Although, the 2008 average season-long CWSIe increased as the irrigation
    treatment amounts decreased, there was not a consistent negative linear relationship
    between yield and the CWSIe (Fig. 5d). The slopes between the manual and automatic
    treatment plots were not significantly different and were therefore represented
    by a single slope. Cotton production during this growing season was affected by
    extreme weather conditions. Hot, dry winds at emergence slowed emergence and plant
    establishment, while heavy rainfall in mid August encouraged vegetative growth
    and hampered boll filling, particularly in the fully irrigated treatments. The
    combination of these impediments reduced fully irrigated yields by 70% from 2007.
    Although the average CWSIe values were inversely related to average lint yields
    when the fully irrigated treatment plots (I100%) were considered outliers (O''Shaughnessy
    and Evett, 2010), cotton yields from individual treatment plots were highly variable
    and not well predicted by the CWSIe. To demonstrate how soon in the irrigation
    season the relationship between the temporal-mean CWSIe and crop yield may be
    useful, the crop yield was regressed against a progressive average of the CWSIe
    calculated from the first date that the pivot moved to progressive dates on which
    it moved, including at each successive date all the data from the first date to
    that date. The coefficient of determination, r2, of the regression analysis was
    plotted against the number of days after the start of irrigation treatment applications
    (Fig. 6). The approximate time required to establish a stable correlation between
    crop yield and CWSIe was approximately 5 days for soybean in 2004 and 35 days
    for cotton in 2007. Not shown is 2005 data for soybean where the trend took approximately
    11 days to establish a stable correlation. The use of crop temperature data in
    this manner may provide producers with useful information regarding the effect
    of crop water stress on production. However, caution is advised since this method
    can fail as shown from data on cotton in 2008 (Fig. 5d) where there was no correlation
    between the temporal-mean CWSIe and crop yield. Values of temporal-mean CWSIe
    from the early vegetative phase of a crop may be less related to yield because
    yield in many crops is more influenced by water deficit stress during anthesis
    and the subsequent yield formation stages (Doorenbos and Kassam, 1979). Also,
    early season CWSIe values may be influenced by soil background emittance; consequently,
    high surface radiometric temperature at early stages of plant development may
    not be a good indicator of plant water use or stress. However, as leaf area increases,
    surface radiometric temperatures become better indicators of plant water use and
    plant water stress. Download : Download full-size image Fig. 6. Trend of coefficient
    of determination, r2, for the relationship between CWSIe and crop yield for: (a)
    soybean (2004); and (b) cotton (2007). Spatial and temporal variability of CWSIe
    were visually demonstrated with contour plot maps drawn using a SAS routine and
    linear interpolation. As an example, progressive mean CWSIe values were plotted
    spatially and contours drawn for four dates in 2007 (Fig. 7). In these figures,
    the solid squares represent the centers of the inner 48 treatment plots with the
    inner arc (smallest radii) representing the fallow edge of the field at the pivot
    point with an assigned CWSIe = 1.0, and the most outer row representing the fully
    irrigated border plots with an assigned CWSIe value = 0.1. The plotted mean CWSIe
    values were the values averaged from DOY 196 (start of irrigation amount treatments)
    through the date in the lower right hand corner of each contour map. The map for
    DOY 204 (8 days after the start of irrigation treatments) indicates that crop
    water stress was fairly homogeneous, with CWSIe ranging primarily between 0.59
    and 0.74 (Fig. 7a). During this time, the crop canopy width ranged between 20
    and 30 cm (data not shown) across treatment plots, indicating that the fraction
    of vegetation was less than full, and therefore soil emittance was likely a contributing
    factor for temperature readings that led to these relatively large calculated
    CWSIe values. By DOY 227, 31 days after irrigation amount treatments began, the
    middle (radially) sections of the field showed less stress; the CWSIe declined
    from ∼0.67 earlier to ∼0.44 along concentric plots representing I100%, I67% and
    I100% irrigation amount treatments (Fig. 7b). By DOY 236, 40 days after irrigation
    treatments began, CWSIe values for the greater irrigation treatment amounts, I100%
    and I67%, became visibly differentiated (light purple) as less stressed than those
    receiving less irrigation, I33% and I0% (yellow to light green) (Fig. 7c). By
    DOY 254, (September 11), two weeks after irrigations ceased and 30 mm of rainfall,
    the seasonal mean CWSIe values between the larger irrigation amount treatments
    (I100% and I67%) and the severe deficit and dryland treatments (I33% and I0%)
    remained large (Fig. 7d). Download : Download full-size image Fig. 7. Spatial

    halting irrigation treatments. Spatial map for soybean crops 2004, 2005 and for
    cotton 2008 are not shown. 4. Conclusions and vision Results from this study demonstrated
    that the CWSIe calculated from infrared thermography images are related to ΨL
    measurements for both soybean and cotton taken in differentially irrigated treatment
    plots. Leaf water potential measurements decreased as the CWSIe increased after
    irrigation treatments were established and maintained. However, it should be noted
    that measurements taken too soon after rainfall events and termination of irrigations
    can confound this relationship. This study also showed that a useful empirical
    crop water stress index (CWSIe) can be calculated from measurements of canopy
    temperature, air temperature, and a “well-watered crop” surface temperature. The
    well-watered crop surface temperature can be measured directly using a physical
    wet reference or modeled. The use of maximum daily dry bulb temperature, Tdry,
    can be used as a substitute for air temperature at the time of measurement, Ta,
    to estimate wet reference surface temperature. However, estimating the wet reference
    temperature (with Eq. (2)) introduced uncertainty relative to the wet reference
    or non-water stressed baseline temperature and needs further investigation. An
    average seasonal CWSIe was computed using a modeled wet reference temperature,
    canopy temperature measurements made from remote IRTs mounted on a pivot lateral,
    and a proven scaling method for estimating one-time-of-day canopy temperatures.
    The average seasonal CWSIe so calculated was shown to be significantly correlated
    to crop yield response for two years of soybean and one year of cotton data. With
    2008 data, it was shown that the stress index did not correlate well when extreme
    weather conditions impacted cotton development. The CWSIe-yield relationship as
    a function of time over the differential irrigation season indicated that the
    approximate time required to establish a stable correlation between crop yield
    and CWSIe was much earlier for soybean, approximately 5–11 days, than for cotton,
    almost 35 days. Contour plots of the CWSIe plotted over time revealed spatial
    patterns of crop water stress that became more defined over time and were related
    to irrigation treatment amounts. Because the CWSIe requires few supplementary
    inputs, it can be an inexpensive method for providing feedback to a producer and
    used as a tool for prediction of spatial variation in yield and for monitoring
    crop water status throughout a growing season when within season weather conditions
    are not extremely variable. Use of the index normalizes data to ambient conditions
    and our method of calculating an empirical CWSI was well correlated with ΨL measurements,
    water use, and yields. These results also compared well with those from Howell
    et al. (1984) and Reginato (1983) for cotton. This work also shows how current
    available technology (instrumentation and scaling algorithms) with infrared thermometry
    mounted on a moving sprinkler system can provide spatial maps to represent within-field
    crop water status. The benefits provided from use of infrared thermometry give
    momentum for automated analysis of whole-field crop status using thermal imagery.
    Thermal imagery would be of more assistance to a farmer since it can provide a
    more detailed level of critical qualitative and quantitative information regarding
    within-field spatial and temporal crop water status. Infrared thermography could
    be used to scan an entire pivot field independent of pivot movement. However,
    fraction of vegetation, view angle, and cloud cover need to be taken into account
    as with the radiometer footprint model by Colaizzi et al. (2010). Methods are
    needed to automate the conversion of field infrared imagery to spatial maps for
    irrigation scheduling and site specific delivery of water. As thermal imagers
    become more affordable, automated digital analysis of field imagery taken at different
    times of the day and converted to useful and easily accessible data could provide
    decision support information to a producer. Future studies are needed to evaluate
    the consistency of this empirical CWSI for different crops and in different regions.

    In this paper, we propose developing a system optimally watering agricultural
    crops based on a wireless sensor network. This work aimed to design and develop
    a control system using node sensors in the crop field with data management via
    smartphone and a web application. The three components are hardware, web application,
    and mobile application. The first component was designed and implemented in control
    box hardware connected to collect data on the crops. Soil moisture sensors are
    used to monitor the field, connecting to the control box. The second component
    is a web-based application that was designed and implemented to manipulate the
    details of crop data and field information. This component applied data mining
    to analyze the data for predicting suitable temperature, humidity, and soil moisture
    for optimal future management of crops growth. The final component is mainly used
    to control crop watering through a mobile application in a smartphone. This allows
    either automatic or manual control by the user. The automatic control uses data
    from soil moisture sensors for watering. However, the user can opt for manual
    control of watering the crops in the functional control mode. The system can send
    notifications through LINE API for the LINE application. The system was implemented
    and tested in Makhamtia District, Suratthani Province, Thailand. The results showed
    the implementation to be useful in agriculture. The moisture content of the soil
    was maintained appropriately for vegetable growth, reducing costs and increasing
    agricultural productivity. Moreover, this work represents driving agriculture
    through digital innovation. Previous article in issue Next article in issue Keywords

    farmIoTs 1. Introduction Advanced technologies can bring benefits to the majority
    of people. In the recent years, the Internet of Things (IoTs) has begun to play
    a major role in daily lives, extending our perceptions and ability to modify the
    environment around us. Particularly the agro-industrial and environmental fields
    apply IoTs in both diagnostics and control. In addition, it can provide information
    to the final user/consumer about the origin and properties of the product (Talavera
    et al., 2017). Thus, this paper aims to apply IoTs for computer aided optimization
    of agriculture. In such optimization of agriculture, installing a Wireless Sensor
    Network (WSN) in the field has improved effectiveness and efficiency of the farmers
    (Capello et al., 2016, Fang et al., 2014, Hashim et al., 2015, Kodali et al.,
    2014). It can help evaluate field variables such as soil state, atmospheric conditions,
    and biomass of plants or animals. It can also be used to assess and control variables
    such as temperature, humidity, vibrations, or shocks during product transport
    (Pang et al., 2015). Moreover, WSN can be used to monitor and control factors
    that influence crop growth and yield. They can also be used to determine the optimum
    time to harvest, which farmer is more suitable for what conditions, detect diseases,
    control machinery, etc., (Ndzi et al., 2014). In this study, we focus on data
    consisting of temperature, humidity, and soil moisture in the crop fields. In
    order to develop a proper system, we require data storage and an approach to discover
    knowledge from accumulated data, and interactions with the user. A database system
    will be designed and implemented as a web-based application. The stored data will
    be used for decision making to control automatic watering of crops. The agriculture
    data will be analyzed to optimize and modify the environment around, and to predict
    the water need of crops in the future. As one of the key contributions, this work
    applied data mining to extract the best value from precise measurements with automatic
    computerized devices monitoring crops, land, and climate. Data mining has been
    applied in agriculture to discover knowledge (Kamilaris et al., 2017, Tripathy
    et al., 2014). Association rules approach has been mostly used to discover interesting
    relations between variables in large databases. It helps analyze and establish
    hidden relationships among the attributes of agricultural data, supporting scientific
    decision-making (Tripathy et al., 2014). Thus, this performed agriculture data
    analysis by association rules using the Apriori algorithm in the general rules
    acquisition, while linear regression was applied to model the relationships between
    several input variables and an outcome variable. In addition, this work aimed
    to design and implement a WSN system for sensors in the crop field, along with
    data management interfaced with the user via a smartphone and a web application.
    The proposed system can support mixed crop farming and help farmers that have
    anytime and anywhere connectivity with the system. This article is organized as
    follows: Section 2 discusses related work, Section 3 presents the proposed diagnostic
    system, Section 4 shows the agricultural data analysis, Section 5 has results
    and discussion, and finally, Section 6 concludes the article. 2. Related work
    In this section, we discuss relevant prior research pertaining to two aspects.
    The first involves the application of IoTs, while the second aspect focuses on
    agricultural data analysis based on IoTs devices. 2.1. Application of IoTs In
    the recent years, IoTs have been applied in many studies, as surveyed in (Ojha
    et al., 2015, Talavera et al., 2017). The applications of technology in the field
    of agriculture are used to improve crop yields or quality and to reduce costs.
    The application of WSN in precision agriculture assists the farmers in a statistical
    manner, helping them make better and well informed decisions (Fang et al., 2014,
    Kodali et al., 2014). Fang et al. (2014) introduced a novel integrated information
    system (IIS) for regional environmental monitoring and management, based on IoTs,
    for improving the efficiency in complex tasks. The proposed IIS combines IoTs,
    Cloud Computing, Geoinformatics (RS, GIS, and GPS), and e-Science for environmental
    monitoring and management, with a case study on regional climate change and its
    ecological responses, which is one of the hottest issues in the scientific world.
    The results showed great benefits from such an IIS, not only in data collection
    supported by the IoTs, but also in web services and applications based on cloud
    computing and e-Science platforms. Effectiveness of monitoring and decision-making
    were obviously improved. In addition, IoTs was applied in the agro-industrial
    production chain (Capello et al., 2016, Medela et al., 2013, Li et al., 2013,
    Ruan and Shi, 2016). Medela et al. (2013) applied IoTs in the agro-industrial
    production chain. They proposed an innovative architecture based on the concept
    of IoTs, combining wireless and distributed specific sensor devices with the simulation
    of climatic conditions, in order to track the evolution of grapes for wineries.
    Li et al. (2013) presented an information system for agriculture based on IoTs,
    with a distributed architecture. In that study, tracking and tracing the whole
    agricultural production process were done with distributed IoTs servers. Moreover,
    an information-discovery system was designed to implement, capture, standardize,
    manage, locate, and query business data from agricultural production. Pang et
    al. (2015) proposed a value-centric business-technology joint design framework
    to provide information to the final user/consumer about the origin and properties
    of the product. Capello et al. (2016) applied IoTs for a real-time monitoring
    service in order to enable the tracing of products from the end consumer back
    to the field. Ruan and Shi (2016) presented an IoTs framework to assess fruit
    freshness in e-commerce deliveries, which was a non-traditional retail service
    that faces unique challenges in transportation, due to product perishability and
    expensive logistics. Many studies have attempted to improve the functionality
    of IoTs (Hashim et al., 2015, Luan et al., 2015). Diedrichs et al. (2014) presented
    the development of a WSN, based on IEEE-802.15.4, for use in frost characterization
    in precision agriculture by measuring the temperature. Fourati et al. (2014) proposed
    a web-based decision support system communicating with a WSN for irrigation scheduling
    in olive fields. For this purpose, the authors used sensors to measure humidity,
    solar radiation, temperature, and rain. Hashim et al. (2015) reviewed the control
    with an electronic device (Arduino) of temperature and soil moisture, and used
    an Android-based smartphone application for flexibility and functionality. They
    found advantages in low cost and flexibility for agriculture control in contrast
    with expensive components such as high-end personal computers. Luan et al. (2015)
    designed and developed a synthetic system that integrated drought monitoring and
    forecasting and irrigation amount forecasting into a platform based on IoTs, hybrid
    programming, and parallel computing. Kanoun et al., 2014, Kaewmard and Saiyod,
    2014 focused on irrigation systems using WSN for collecting environment data and
    control of the irrigation system via a smartphone. Kaewmard and Saiyod (2014)
    provided a long-term sustainable solution for automation of agriculture to get
    data from vegetable crops, or for environmental measurements. The authors developed
    a portable measurement technology including soil moisture sensor, air humidity
    sensor, and air temperature sensors. Chen et al. (2014) proposed systems for monitoring
    multi-layer soil temperature and moisture in a farmland field using WSN to improve
    the water utilization and to collect basic data for research on soil water infiltration
    variations and for intelligent precision irrigation. Li et al. (2012) proposed
    an agricultural greenhouse environmental monitoring system based on IoTs, with
    remote real-time monitoring of environmental information on the greenhouse, combining
    internet, wireless network and mobile network. Furthermore, Lukas et al. (2015)
    designed a long-range water level monitoring system for troughs using a WSN based
    on LoRa transceivers, allowing the cattleman to observe water availability for
    livestock even when the barn was 1 or 3 km away. Wong and Kerkez (2016) presented
    a web service and real-time data architecture that includes an adaptive controller
    that updates the parameters of each sensing node within a WSN based on a previously
    defined policy. Sarangi et al. (2016) proposed an agriculture support system based
    on Wisekar to provide automated value-added services that integrate the interoperability
    of an IoTs web repository with an agricultural advisory call center. 2.2. Agriculture
    data analysis The use of IoTs leads to a large-scale or big data that provides
    valuable information. For this reason, many studies have attempted to turn such
    data into useful information and knowledge, as surveyed in (Kamilaris et al.,
    2017). Pahuja et al. (2013) developed an online microclimate monitoring and control
    system for greenhouses. The system was supported by a WSN for gathering and analyzing
    plant related sensor data to provide control of climate, fertilization, irrigation,
    and pests. Tripathy et al. (2014) used data derived from WSN to discover knowledge
    by data mining. This study focused on leaf spot disease assessing the crop-weather-environment-disease
    relations, based on wireless sensors and field level surveillance. A classifier
    was trained to predict the disease. Kehua Xian (2017) proposed a new convenient
    online monitoring system for IoTs, based on cloud computing. After accumulating
    enough data from an agricultural IoTs system, modeling of relevant functional
    requirements was demonstrated to promote the application of large data analysis
    in agriculture. However, only few studies have applied data mining to extract
    useful information and knowledge, so this current work will mine the data from
    IoTs. 3. Research methodology 3.1. The real-situation test area This work will
    demonstrate real installations at 3 points (villages). The three example villages
    are located apart from each other and have differences in farming. The first example
    village has lime cultivation and homegrown vegetables. The second example village
    has a salad farm and homegrown vegetables. The final example village has an integrated
    farming system with salad farm, chicken farm, mushroom farm, and herbal farm.
    The three example villages are represented by the models in Fig. 1, Fig. 2, Fig.

    villages showed that IoTs can be used to support and help farmers with any type
    of agriculture. Moreover, the farmers can spend the time saved on other activities
    for increased income. The real-time information from IoTs devices in each village
    was used to control on-off switching of water sprinklers, automatically. Initially,
    we collected IoTs information for 5 months (170 days) and performed yield analysis
    with these data. The obtained IoTs information consists of temperature, humidity,
    and soil moisture, and was collected every 20 min, but for analysis the daily
    averages were used. Moreover, recorded the yields of lime cultivation and homegrown
    vegetables to determine relationships between IoTs information and the agricultural
    products. 3.2. Design and overview of the system This work aims to design and
    implement systems with sensors in the crop field and data management by using
    a smartphone with web application. The three components are hardware, web application,
    and mobile application, as shown in Fig. 4. Download : Download high-res image

    Referring to Fig. 4, the first component was designed and developed in control
    box form. This control box is designed to control the IoTs devices and obtain
    data from the crops. The control box and IoTs devices used in this work are shown
    in Table 1. Table 1. Deployment parameters. Parameter Value Voltage nodeMCU –

    is the web-based application. This component involves managing the real-time information
    from IoTs devices in each village. The web-based application allows an administrator
    to manipulate the conditions for water need of each crop. In addition, the details
    of information from IoTs devices can be viewed by an administrator to manage each
    kind of agriculture. These data were analyzed to predict the water need of crops
    in the future. The web-based application to manipulate IoTs data from each installation

    show the process with web-based and mobile application. The final component was
    used by farmer on a mobile phone. The mobile application was designed to control
    watering after the data had been analyzed. The mobile application provided two
    modes, such that farmers can control watering manually, or the proposed system
    can automatically turn on/off watering based on IoTs information, as shown in
    Fig. 5. We summarize the formal mechanisms in the proposed system with the system
    architecture shown in Fig. 6. This system architecture consists of 3 parts i.e.
    environmental data acquisition layer, data and communication layer, and application
    layer. The environmental data acquisition layer is designed to collect data on
    environmental factors from the sensors and device control. The next layer transports
    all of the gathered sensor data to collect it into a server. The application layer
    uses the accumulated data to monitor and control the crop and for data management.

    Fig. 6. The architecture of the control system. 3.3. Implementation The proposed
    system is implemented with three parts i.e. control box, web-based application,
    and mobile application. The control box keeps electronic devices in a waterproof
    box, as shown in Fig. 7. The control box could be located anywhere in farm or
    near the farm, having the soil moisture sensors, solenoid valve, DHT22 sensor,
    and an ultrasonic sensor connected to the control box. In this study, IoTs is
    applied to the soil moisture sensors to measure the humidity of crop soil and
    to control switching on-and-off water sprinklers automatically. The solenoid valve
    was used to control water flow with on/off action. The DHT22 sensor was used to
    control the humidity of mushroom farm. Ultrasonic sensor was applied to measure
    the level of water in the chicken farm. Download : Download high-res image (493KB)

    The second part is a web-based application that gets agriculture information from
    NodeMCU. It accesses the internet via WiFi connection. The web-based application
    was implemented to manage agricultural plots and to manage watering of crop, or
    to analyze what is suitable watering. Fig. 8 provides an example web page presenting
    the water need and IoTs information from each installation. Moreover, this part

    The final part was implemented in order to interface with the farmer. The mobile
    application is used to control on-off switching of the electrical system by the
    farmer. This application has 2 modes; automatic and manual. The automatic system
    was activated when IoTs devices were detected with defined values of field sensors
    without user input. The farmer can take over the control and turn the water on
    or off with the mobile application. Fig. 9 is an example of the mobile application
    to control watering. The main functions of the application are monitoring watering,
    set-up of crop details in each plot, and notifications via LINE application. Download

    Data mining was applied to extract important and useful knowledge from large data
    on crops, obtained with IoTs. The knowledge discovery processes are discussed
    in (Han and Kamber, 2006). Data mining refers to extracting knowledge from large
    amounts of data. This paper divides data mining into 4 steps as follows. 1. Data
    pre-processing: This is an important step in the knowledge discovery process,
    because the quality of knowledge depends on the quality of data. In the real world,
    data tend to be dirty, incomplete, and inconsistent. Thus, this step can help
    improve the accuracy and efficiency of the subsequent mining. This step includes
    data cleaning, data integration, and data transformation. This work used the large
    amounts of data from IoTs devices on temperature, humidity, and soil moisture,
    to predict yields, and data for the first example village are shown in Fig. 10.
    We converted the IoTs information to discrete format in order to support data
    modeling. Download : Download high-res image (160KB) Download : Download full-size
    image Fig. 10. IoT information and products from the first example village. 2.
    Data reduction: This step can encode the data to a smaller reduced representation.
    The integrity of the original data was preserved in order that mining the reduced
    data should be more efficient yet produce the same (or almost the same) analysis
    results. This work used numerosity reduction, where nonparametric methods for
    storing reduced representations of the data include histograms. We used equal-width
    histograms with uniform width buckets and 3 buckets for low, middle, and high
    level. 3. Data modeling/discovery: This step extracts knowledge from the prepared
    data. Mostly, data modeling/discovery applies intelligent methods to identify
    patterns in the data. The analysis tools can include classification, clustering,
    association, and so on. Association rules are the data mining technique applied
    in this work. Association rules are if/then statements that help discover relationships
    between subjectively unrelated agriculture data. They were used to find relationships
    among temperature, humidity, and soil moisture, as well as yields of lemons and
    homegrown vegetables. There are two basic criteria that association rules use,
    support and confidence, and they represent relationships and rules as frequently
    true if/then patterns. In this work the minimum support was 0.75 and confidence
    was better than 90%. The Apriori algorithm available in Weka 3.6.9 (http://www.cs.waikato.ac.nz/ml/weka/)
    was used to extract association rules from data. In addition, we applied linear
    regression to model the relationship between several input variables and an outcome
    variable. The model type is shown in Eq. (1), (1) ∊ where y is the outcome variable,
    are the input variables, for , is the value of y when each equals zero, is the
    change in y based on a unit change in for , and ∊ is a random error term that
    represents the difference in the linear model and a particular observed value
    for y. The outcome variables are products of lime cultivation and homegrown vegetables
    (each has its own model), while the input variables are temperature, humidity,
    and soil moisture. The R environment was used to fit the models at 95% confidence
    level, shown in Eqs. (2), (3) for products of lime cultivation ( ) and for homegrown
    vegetables ( ), respectively, (2) (3) 4. Solution analysis: This step involved
    an analysis of the results from data modeling/discovery. The solution in our work
    will be discussed with the real implementation. 5. Results and discussion The
    proposed system can use IoT devices to collect data on humidity derived from the
    DHT22 sensor, soil moisture derived from soil moisture sensor, and temperature
    derived from web service of the Thai Meteorological Department Homepage (https://www.tmd.go.th/).
    This information can be displayed on a mobile device to the farmer, and is used
    by automatic on/off control of watering. Moreover, the farmer can manually turn
    on/off the watering. The functional status of on-off switching and time stamps
    can be notified via LINE Application. Further, an administrator can manipulate
    the obtained IoTs information and control the data from each installation. The
    admin can also mine the data to discover knowledge. This knowledge is applied
    to optimize the farming by season. From data modeling/discovery, the knowledge
    results showed that if the product of homegrown vegetables is high (more than
    4 kg./day) and lime cultivation is high (more than 6 kg./day) then the temperature
    will middle level (between C and C), and if the product of lime cultivation is
    high (more than 6 kg./day) then the humidity will middle level (between 72% and
    81%). The knowledge discovery from real data is illustrated in Fig. 11. We found
    that the knowledge discovery represented the real data well. Download : Download

    of IoT information with productivity. From an economic perspective, this proposed
    system was considered an investment because of its low cost of approximately 93.27
    US Dollars per field. We focused on the first example village. The lime cultivation
    productivity improvement indicates payback within 2 months. In addition, the increased
    productivity means that the farmer can spend more time on other tasks. In addition,
    this study has been carried out in a mixed crop environment with three example
    villages. Each village had different crops and purposes of agriculture. Knowledge
    discovery can be applied to suggest a control strategy for watering when the farmer
    would like to have mixed crops. 6. Conclusion IoTs was applied in agriculture
    to improve crop yields, improve quality, and reduce costs. For these reasons,
    we proposed WSNs application to watering crops, in this paper. We designed and
    implemented a system to control environmental factors in the crop fields. The
    system had the three parts hardware, web application, and mobile application.
    The first part was designed and implemented in control box form. This control
    box included hardware and electronic control system to connect to sensors and
    obtain data on crops. The control box was designed for real-life testing. The
    implemented design connected to and received IoT information from any field in
    this study. The second part was the web-based application designed and implemented
    to manipulate details of crop data and field information. In this step, large-scale
    data from IoT is stored and utilized in data analysis. As one key contribution,
    this work applied data mining by association rules to discover useful information
    on effects of environment and climate. The results showed that suitable temperature
    for high productivity of homegrown vegetables and lemons was between C and C.
    Moreover, suitable humidity for high productivity of lemons was within 72–81%.
    The final part was to control the crop watering with a mobile application on a
    smartphone. This allowed for both automatic and manual functional control to the
    user. The user can use the automatic function based on data from soil moisture
    sensors for watering. However, manual control was possible in the functional control
    mode. The system sent notifications through LINE API of the LINE application.
    The developed system was installed in Makhamtia District, Suratthani Province,
    Thailand. The results showed clear benefits to agriculture. The moisture content
    in the soil was appropriately controlled for the vegetables, reducing costs and
    increasing agricultural productivity. This case study shows high potential for
    digital technology applications in agriculture. Acknowledgments The authors are

    Abstract: Digitalization has impacted agricultural and food production systems,\
    \ and makes applica-\ntion of technologies and advanced data processing techniques\
    \ in agricultural ﬁeld possible. Digital\nfarming aims to use available information\
    \ from agricultural assets to solve several existing challenges\nfor addressing\
    \ food security, climate protection, and resource management. However, the agricultural\n\
    sector is complex, dynamic, and requires sophisticated management systems. The\
    \ digital approaches\nare expected to provide more optimization and further decision-making\
    \ supports. Digital twin in\nagriculture is a virtual representation of a farm\
    \ with great potential for enhancing productivity and\nefﬁciency while declining\
    \ energy usage and losses. This review describes the state-of-the-art of\ndigital\
    \ twin concepts along with different digital technologies and techniques in agricultural\
    \ con-\ntexts. It presents a general framework of digital twins in soil, irrigation,\
    \ robotics, farm machineries,\nand food post-harvest processing in agricultural\
    \ ﬁeld. Data recording, modeling including artiﬁcial\nintelligence, big data,\
    \ simulation, analysis, prediction, and communication aspects (e.g., Internet\n\
    of Things, wireless technologies) of digital twin in agriculture are discussed.\
    \ Digital twin systems\ncan support farmers as a next generation of digitalization\
    \ paradigm by continuous and real-time\nmonitoring of physical world (farm) and\
    \ updating the state of virtual world.\nKeywords: digital twin; digitalization;\
    \ digital farming; farm management; smart farming\n1. Introduction\nOne of the\
    \ main global challenges is how to ensure food security for the world’s\ngrowing\
    \ population whilst ensuring long-term sustainable development. According to the\n\
    Food and Agriculture Organization, agricultural and food productions will need\
    \ to grow\nto feed the world population, which will reach around 10 billion by\
    \ 2050 [1]. Due to the\nincrease in world population and market demand for higher\
    \ product quantity and quality\nstandards, the issue of food security, sustainability,\
    \ productivity, and proﬁtability becomes\nmore important. Furthermore, the economic\
    \ pressure on the agricultural sector, labor,\nenvironmental, and climate change\
    \ issues are increasing [2,3]. Therefore, the enhancement\nof efﬁciency through\
    \ effective integrated smart technologies and techniques has been\nwidely considered\
    \ in recent years.\nIn this context, digital agriculture (also known as smart\
    \ farming or smart agriculture)\ntools can support the deeper understanding of\
    \ interrelations within the agricultural pro-\nduction system and the consequent\
    \ effects on the performance of farm production while\nbalancing human health\
    \ and well-being, social and environmental aspects, and sustain-\nability associated\
    \ with agricultural system [4–6]. Due to advances in data generation, data\nprocessing\
    \ and human-computer interactions, digital farming has progressed in recent\n\
    years [7]. One of the main features of digitalization in agriculture is the introduction\
    \ of inno-\nvative Information and Communication Technology (ICT), Internet of\
    \ Things (IoT), big data\nanalytics and interpretation techniques, machine learning\
    \ and Artiﬁcial Intelligence (AI).\nData acquisition and analysis in digital farming\
    \ by means of smart technologies are\nsupporting complex decision-making approaches\
    \ [8,9]. They enhance ﬁnal productivity,\nSensors 2022, 22, 498. https://doi.org/10.3390/s22020498\n\
    https://www.mdpi.com/journal/sensors\nSensors 2022, 22, 498\n2 of 16\nreduce costs,\
    \ and optimize the decision-making process. Furthermore, ICT tools present\nadvantages\
    \ for on-farm management, efﬁciency, quality control, and the food supply chain\n\
    as well as decision support tools [10]. The AI and big data support better and\
    \ precise\nfarm monitoring, data acquisition and analytics, improve information\
    \ extraction from\nsensors as well as farm management [11]. For instance, crop\
    \ health and productivity can\nbe monitored and controlled using advanced AI and\
    \ deep learning techniques [12]. Data-\ndriven approaches augment on-farm decision-making\
    \ capabilities, improve crop yield,\nreduce losses, and therefore, beneﬁt farmers.\
    \ The IoT and wireless technologies enable\nreal-time data transferring and monitoring\
    \ in digital farming [13,14]. The IoT, along with\ncloud computing systems, can\
    \ facilitate communication between software platforms and\nsensors, pieces of\
    \ machinery, crops, and animals in digital farming. However, by increasing\nthe\
    \ number of sensors and generating large amounts of data in digital farming could\
    \ cause\nhigh load on the cloud server and reduce the response speed [15]. In\
    \ this context, in may\nbe impractical to always store and process data in the\
    \ cloud systems [16]. An alternative\ntechnology which has been recently introduced\
    \ to the smart farming is edge-computing\nthat enables computation at the edge\
    \ of the network [17]. It helps to reduce network load\nand supports real-time\
    \ data processing in agricultural ﬁelds. Furthermore, cyber-physical\nsystems\
    \ have been introduced through smart farming systems to develop hardware and\n\
    software, improve adaptability, and safety and security of computer-based algorithms\n\
    and systems [18]. It enables adaptability, practicality, security, and safety\
    \ of collected\ninformation in agricultural ﬁeld e.g., climate, irrigation, soil,\
    \ nutrition, and yield for\nbetter management.\nAccording to ref. [19], digital\
    \ farming approaches can provide farmers with useful\ninformation about (I) the\
    \ use of fertilizers, chemicals, seeds, and irrigation management\nstrategies,\
    \ (II) the environment protection, (III) pest, climate, and crop monitoring man-\n\
    agement solutions, (IV) market demands and business conditions. However, agricultural\n\
    production systems are complex, dynamic, and require sophisticated management\
    \ [20].\nDigitalization approaches are expected to provide more monitoring, data\
    \ analysis and\noptimization capabilities, and further decision-making supports.\n\
    To enhance the efﬁciency of these systems, an emerging paradigm has been proposed\n\
    and implemented in digital agriculture, that is, digital twin. The digital twin\
    \ was ﬁrstly\npresented by NASA for monitoring of spacecraft behavior and can\
    \ be deﬁned as a virtual\nor digital representation of physical systems to simulate\
    \ the behavior of the physical\nsystem [21,22]. There are different deﬁnitions\
    \ for digital twin available in the literature\nwhich have been reviewed by [23–25].\
    \ Based on the reported deﬁnitions, the component\nof digital twin can be characterized\
    \ by physical and virtual objects, as well as a set of\nconnections between physical\
    \ and digital assets [26].\nThe physical system or physical world in agriculture\
    \ is a complex and dynamic\nenvironment and includes basic information and features\
    \ of the object or device such\nas shape, position, cooler, material, and live\
    \ objects [27]. The physical system is one\nof the key components, and a digital\
    \ twin without a physical world is a model [28],\nand system boundaries of a digital\
    \ twin are identiﬁed based on the real physical world [29].\nThe physical system\
    \ can be a single component of an object or the whole object with sub-\ncomponents\
    \ located in a physical environment [28]. The physical world in agriculture can\n\
    be an animal itself or located in a farm including building, feeding strategies,\
    \ number of\nanimals [30], or a crop with different soil, climate, and irrigation\
    \ conditions [22], robots\nand agricultural pieces of machinery, e.g., tractors,\
    \ harvesters and fertilizers, as well as\noperators. The physical world can include\
    \ a whole object (e.g., whole machine) or sub-part\nof the object, or a single\
    \ asset of the object connected with other objects. In an agricultural\ncontext,\
    \ the physical system may be some aspects of the crop, soil, and irrigation systems,\n\
    or animal body. The physical world requires measurement technologies and sensors\
    \ to\ncollect and receive data from the physical object. Examples of digital twins\
    \ in smart\nagriculture include optical sensors for plant canopy and disease [31,32],\
    \ soil and weather\nsensors for crop [33], barn sensors such as temperature, humidity,\
    \ ammonia for animals [34],\nSensors 2022, 22, 498\n3 of 16\nGlobal Positioning\
    \ System (GPS) and Real-Time Kinematic-Global Navigation Satellite for\ntracking\
    \ of agricultural robots [35], and food supply chain.\nThe connection between\
    \ physical and virtual worlds depends on the developed digital\ntwin. This component\
    \ enables data transmission between virtual and physical systems.\nIt interprets\
    \ the collected data from the physical system and updates the state of the\nvirtual\
    \ system, and transfers feedbacks from the virtual system to the physical world\
    \ [25].\nThe connection components can be varied depending on the source, type\
    \ and volume of\ndata, data transfer rate and speed, as well as the minimum delay\
    \ between data acquisition\nand feedbacks. Wireless and IoT techniques have been\
    \ used in digital twins of agricultural\nconcepts to connect between physical\
    \ and virtual worlds (such as [34,36,37]).\nThe models and data of the physical\
    \ world are represented in a virtual system.\nThe virtual world may also include\
    \ different processing and simulation concepts, software,\nmachine learning, data\
    \ mining, and AI models. In this context, data processing and analyt-\nics by\
    \ means of AI techniques to support decision-making and feedback to the physical\n\
    system were suggested by some researchers [38,39]. The virtual twin may simulate\
    \ and\ncontrol the physical system, optimize a process, and predict unseen issues\
    \ in the physical\nsystem. For example, an application layer of a digital twin\
    \ reported by [22] provides\nreal-time monitoring of weeds, crop growth, and expected\
    \ yield via cloud dashboards for\nfarmers. A schematic of the digital twin concept\

    \ and evaluation of soil quality to sustain plant productivity is the basis of\n\
    land-use strategies in agricultural farms [48]. Crop health and productivity depends\
    \ on\nthe quality and properties of the soil. More detailed information about\
    \ the agricultural\nsoil may reduce the potential use of chemical fertilizer and\
    \ pesticide dosages, therefore\nimproving the underground water, protecting the\
    \ environment and human health. It also\nsupports deﬁning plant density in a more\
    \ efﬁcient way. Digital technologies are supporting\nscientists to better understand\
    \ and study soil in agriculture. Soil monitoring sensors such\nas moisture, temperature,\
    \ organic matter, and soil pollutant sensors are playing critical\nroles in digital\
    \ agriculture [49]. For instance, soil moisture information can be used to\nassess\
    \ irrigation efﬁciency in agricultural ﬁelds [50]. Furthermore, to support the\
    \ decision-\nmaking process of smart farming, digital soil mapping is an essential\
    \ paradigm that can be\ndeﬁned as spatial soil information based on ﬁeld and laboratory\
    \ investigations coupled\nwith soil inference systems [51]. Digital soil assessment\
    \ approaches have a direct impact on\ncrop yield and performance by identifying\
    \ zones that may cause low crop yield. Digital\nalternative methodologies for\
    \ soil survey and identifying key soil characteristics could\nhave the possibility\
    \ to quantify the trend of agricultural soil conditions [52].\nThe advancement\
    \ of knowledge and technology (e.g., wireless sensors, IoT, AI) in\ndigital agriculture\
    \ could lead to digital twin paradigms of soil in agriculture. The recent\ndevelopment\
    \ of digital soil mapping techniques may support digital twins by digital\nrepresentation\
    \ of knowledge obtained from the soil in virtual entrainment [53]. For in-\nstance,\
    \ digital soil mapping could be used to describe soil variation in digital twins\
    \ using\ninformation from complex soil variation at a speciﬁc depth, time, and\
    \ special locations [52].\nAdditionally, the decision about crop management depends\
    \ directly on the crop water\nrequirements, soil properties, and availability\
    \ of water. In order to manage soil and crop\nrequirements in smart farming, digital\
    \ technologies have been used to meet the requirement\nof smart or precise water\
    \ management strategies. Wireless system networks, IoT, edge-\ncomputing, local\
    \ weather-based controllers, and soil sensors are some of the digital tools\n\
    based on smart irrigation systems. The mentioned tools can be used in the digital\
    \ twin of\nsoil and irrigation systems. For example, ref. [37] developed a digital\
    \ twin concept for smart\nwater management in the agricultural domain. Information\
    \ of air and ground temperature,\nand humidity sensors, soil moisture, and ambient\
    \ light as well as geospatial position\nsensors were collected. An IoT system\
    \ was used to connect the cloud and the physical\nsystem. A virtual environment\
    \ including decision-making tools and models was designed\nto inform the data\
    \ collected by connection device (the IoT system) and to send feedback\nto the\
    \ physical system. They also presented a digital twin system architecture including\n\
    monitoring devices (i.e., soil probe, weather information, irrigation system,\
    \ machines,\nand other equipment) in a physical system (farm) with could serve\
    \ as a connection between\nthe physical and virtual systems to visualize satellite\
    \ and drone images.\nIn another study, to evaluate and forecast plants’ irrigation\
    \ requirements, and support\nirrigation and water distribution planning, a digital\
    \ twin for a smart water management\nsystem was developed by [54]. Data of the\
    \ physical world (agriculture ﬁeld) such as\nSensors 2022, 22, 498\n5 of 16\n\
    weather, fertilizer, and soil type as well as information from developed models\
    \ that simulate\nthe behavior of soil and crops were considered as input data\
    \ for the digital twin. The digital\ntwin concept also consisted of a Soil Agent\
    \ (includes hydrological models and soil data),\nCrop Agent (includes crop models\
    \ and evaporation data), and a Field Avatar, which is a\ndigital representation\
    \ of the ﬁeld such as geological models and weather data [54]. In their\ndeveloped\
    \ digital twin concept, the information from Soil Avatar and Crop Avatar feed\n\
    into the Field Avatar, and an IoT system was used for data transformation and\
    \ connection\nbetween the physical and virtual worlds.\nDue to increase in world\
    \ population, water and energy management, storage, and proper\ndistribution of\
    \ water become more essential for water users in agricultural sectors, which can\n\
    be managed through a collective irrigation system [55]. A digital twin of water\
    \ systems\ncoupled with big data can reduce risk and uncertainty of water management,\
    \ explore\nconsumption patterns, and optimize operation planning [56]. Furthermore,\
    \ in a collective\nirrigation system, improvement of water efﬁciency could help\
    \ to reduce water losses. In this\ncontext, a digital twin concept was created\
    \ using ﬁeld and laboratory tests of a collective\nirrigation system network to\
    \ evaluate energy, pumping facilities, water losses and water use\nefﬁciencies\
    \ [57]. The developed digital twin methodology was based on information from\n\
    the physical system, i.e., infrastructure data, acquired information through telemetry,\
    \ data\nanalytics from laboratory tests and ﬁeld measurements, IoT data transferring\
    \ as connection,\nenergy balance, water balance, and hydraulic model in the virtual\
    \ system. It was found\nthat the digital twin of the irrigation management system\
    \ made it possible to understand\nsystem processes, maintenance, and management\
    \ strategies [57].\nA digital twin of soil and irrigation systems in smart farming\
    \ enables digital repre-\nsentation of information from agricultural soil, and\
    \ provides prediction and fundamental\nunderstanding of water requirement and\
    \ soil components for crop farming. Exchanging\ninformation from the soil as a\
    \ physical system to a virtual system using IoT, cloud, fog,\nand edge-computing\
    \ technologies in digital twin may allow evaluating the state of soil and\nirrigation\
    \ systems. In particular, the edge-computing technique that saves and performs\n\
    the data processing near the soil monitoring and irrigation devices can improve\
    \ the perfor-\nmance and overcome issues of cloud-based system in digital twin\
    \ concepts. Furthermore,\nit could offer different irrigation recommendations\
    \ based on crop requirements which are\nnot solved yet by the researchers.\n3.\
    \ Digital Twin in Crop Production\nThe use of digital and ICT tools in crop production\
    \ technologies, in particular agri-\ncultural machineries, e.g., tractors, combine\
    \ harvesters, fertilizers, and sprayers, plays an\nimportant role in the improvement\
    \ of overall efﬁciency by reducing the cost of fuel, fertiliz-\ners, human labor,\
    \ and parameters which affect production efﬁciency and sustainability [58].\n\
    Digitalization has modernized agricultural machinery application and management\
    \ policies\nusing collected information and advanced data analytics approaches.\
    \ It allows to optimize\nthe performance and enhance the use of advanced tools\
    \ in manufacturing. For instance,\nbased on the European Agricultural Machinery\
    \ Association, a digital farm machine should\nbe able to assist and support drivers\
    \ by sending and receiving data via sensors and ICT\ntools, enable the best and\
    \ optimal use of machinery, and the technology should facilitate\nthe automated\
    \ operation of the devices [59]. The application of AI, big data analytics,\n\
    and wireless and IoT technologies have led to signiﬁcant changes in farm technology\
    \ roles\ntowards the development of autonomous systems. The role of agricultural\
    \ machinery in\nthe implementation of digital agriculture was stated by [58] as\
    \ data collected from sensors\nmounted on typical and autonomous agricultural\
    \ machinery and transferred via an IoT\nplatform. Then, the information was analyzed\
    \ by data analytics such as AI, fuzzy logic,\nand big data analysis to support\
    \ farmers, consumers, and markets [58]. In this context,\ncombining digital tools\
    \ with autonomous machines and robots could help farmers to do\nmore effective\
    \ practices and improve the quality of products [60]. Nowadays, with ad-\nvancements\
    \ in digital technology, the real-time visualization of smart farm equipment\n\
    Sensors 2022, 22, 498\n6 of 16\nconditions is possible through digital twin approaches\
    \ [40]. It allows contact to the system\n(e.g., machinery and robots), simulates\
    \ the condition of the system, and monitors the\nbehavior and operation as well\
    \ as the maintenance situation of the machines (Figure 2).\n \ntransferred via\
    \ an IoT platform. Then, the information was analyzed by data analytics \nsuch\
    \ as AI, fuzzy logic, and big data analysis to support farmers, consumers, and\
    \ markets \n[58]. In this context, combining digital tools with autonomous machines\
    \ and robots could \nhelp farmers to do more effective practices and improve the\
    \ quality of products [60]. Now-\nadays, with advancements in digital technology,\
    \ the real-time visualization of smart farm \nequipment conditions is possible\
    \ through digital twin approaches [40]. It allows contact \nto the system (e.g.,\
    \ machinery and robots), simulates the condition of the system, and \nmonitors\
    \ the behavior and operation as well as the maintenance situation of the machines\
    \ \n(Figure 2).  \n \nFigure 2. An architecture of the digital twin concept for\
    \ crop production technology. \nDigital twin in design and manufacturing of products\
    \ (e.g., farm machinery) requires \n(I) geometric (e.g., size, shape) and physical\
    \ properties of an object, (II) in the detailed \ninformation of the product which\
    \ can illustrate dynamic processing of the object, (III) in-\ntegration of geometric,\
    \ physical, and process information [61]. Digital twin approaches \nmake it possible\
    \ to model, design, simulate, and develop agricultural machinery that \nwould\
    \ yield more productive machines in terms of energy and power efficiencies. For\
    \ \ninstance, it was shown that overall energy consumption of machinery could\
    \ be modeled \nin digital twin concepts, and the effect of different factors on\
    \ energy consumption can also \nbe explored there [62]. In the agricultural context,\
    \ ref. [40] reported that a commercially \navailable digital twin platform for\
    \ agricultural machinery is able to track the machines in \nreal-time, monitor\
    \ the energy consumption, economic efficiency of crop management, and \ntrajectories\
    \ of tractors by considering the specific conditions of the farm. It has also\
    \ been \nreported that using digital twins could potentially impact the training\
    \ of unskilled har-\nvester operators and lead to high macro-economic benefits\
    \ [63].  \nWithin the digital farming technologies, robotics, as an important\
    \ technology in crop \nproduction, has played an essential role in digitalization\
    \ and has been drawing more at-\ntention in recent years. To optimize the robotic\
    \ application process, reduce costs, and in-\ncrease the quality and efficiency\
    \ of the product, the digital twin concepts can be used for \nvirtualization of\
    \ the robot environment by introducing a remote operating system [64]. By \nproviding\
    \ simulation and remote operation possibilities and modeling various interac-\n\
    tions between robot and environment in digital twin concepts, accuracy, performance,\
    \ \nand flexibility may enhance, and the final product cost may decline. Ref.\
    \ [65] analyzed the \nhuman-robot interactive behaviors using a digital twin platform.\
    \ Their developed digital \ntwin helps to improve operational productivity and\
    \ comfort. In another study, a digital \nFigure 2. An architecture of the digital\

    \ of geometric, physical, and process information [61]. Digital twin ap-\nproaches\
    \ make it possible to model, design, simulate, and develop agricultural machinery\n\
    that would yield more productive machines in terms of energy and power efﬁciencies.\n\
    For instance, it was shown that overall energy consumption of machinery could\
    \ be mod-\neled in digital twin concepts, and the effect of different factors\
    \ on energy consumption can\nalso be explored there [62]. In the agricultural\
    \ context, ref. [40] reported that a commercially\navailable digital twin platform\
    \ for agricultural machinery is able to track the machines\nin real-time, monitor\
    \ the energy consumption, economic efﬁciency of crop management,\nand trajectories\
    \ of tractors by considering the speciﬁc conditions of the farm. It has also\n\
    been reported that using digital twins could potentially impact the training of\
    \ unskilled\nharvester operators and lead to high macro-economic beneﬁts [63].\n\
    Within the digital farming technologies, robotics, as an important technology\
    \ in crop\nproduction, has played an essential role in digitalization and has\
    \ been drawing more\nattention in recent years. To optimize the robotic application\
    \ process, reduce costs, and in-\ncrease the quality and efﬁciency of the product,\
    \ the digital twin concepts can be used for\nvirtualization of the robot environment\
    \ by introducing a remote operating system [64].\nBy providing simulation and\
    \ remote operation possibilities and modeling various inter-\nactions between\
    \ robot and environment in digital twin concepts, accuracy, performance,\nand\
    \ ﬂexibility may enhance, and the ﬁnal product cost may decline. Ref. [65] analyzed\n\
    the human-robot interactive behaviors using a digital twin platform. Their developed\n\
    digital twin helps to improve operational productivity and comfort. In another\
    \ study,\na digital twin approach was proposed to assist the remote programming\
    \ of a robot [66].\nThe developed digital twin system consists of a robot (as\
    \ a physical object), and a gaming\nplatform (as a virtual system) which was able\
    \ to observe the motion of the robot, ease\nprogramming for complex environments\
    \ as well as introduce a remote operating system\nfor communication across different\
    \ platforms [66]. In the agricultural context, an approach\nwas recommended by\
    \ [35] that the development of a digital twin paradigm for agricultural\nrobots\
    \ may improve predictive emulation of the vehicles, operational scheduling, digital-\n\
    Sensors 2022, 22, 498\n7 of 16\nization, economic, environmental, and social sustainability\
    \ in agriculture. Furthermore,\nthe digital twin paradigm makes it possible to\
    \ overcome common challenges in the control\nof robot components in the agriculture\
    \ ﬁeld. In this context, a research group demonstrated\nthe possibility of a digital\
    \ twin concept for a desktop version of an agricultural robot [67] to\ncontrol\
    \ the motor and indoor localization capabilities of the robot. Besides, the digital\
    \ twin\nconcept was used to predict movement and monitor the safety mechanism\
    \ of the robot [67].\nHowever, their developed digital twin concept needs different\
    \ kinds of calibrations to be\napplicable in different environmental conditions.\n\
    In another study, to simulate complexity of the crop production process, variability\
    \ of\nplant, soil, environment, and technologies in the agricultural ﬁeld, digital\
    \ twin concepts\nwere developed [68]. Three ﬁeld robots for different agricultural\
    \ applications were used to\ndevelop different digital twin concepts and optimize\
    \ sensor-based autonomous navigation.\nIt is reported that the developed concepts\
    \ could provide considerable information in prepar-\ning ﬁeld experiments, and\
    \ better evaluation for the use and positioning of sensor systems\ntowards demonstrating\
    \ and implementation of the developed robotic technologies [68].\nIntegration\
    \ of the digital twin systems with technologies and management strategies\nin\
    \ crop production can provide a new phenomenon for digitalization in agricultural\
    \ ﬁeld.\nManagement strategies can be improved and optimized by providing reliable\
    \ forecasts of\nthe key parameters in digital twins [69]. The digital twin systems\
    \ can not only act as a man-\nagement system, but it may also be used to revolutionize\
    \ agricultural farm management\nstrategies [40]. For instance, a digital twin\
    \ concept was applied in a greenhouse to discover,\nanalyze, and extract behavior\
    \ of farmers [70]. Sensor data were analyzed using deep learn-\ning techniques\
    \ to establish decision-making models to replicate expert famers’ experience\n\
    for transferring to young farmers. It was found that the developed digital twin\
    \ module\ncould improve control and management strategies in crop farming [70].\
    \ In this context,\nthe use of distributed architecture in digital twin may increase\
    \ efﬁciency and reliability\nof the module by proper resource handling [71]. A\
    \ distributed digital twin concept was\ndeveloped to handle resources over different\
    \ stakeholders and platforms in agricultural\nlandscape [72]. It consists of different\
    \ components, i.e., stakeholders, applications in agri-\nculture and farm management,\
    \ sensor data, analytics and simulation tools, virtual model,\nIoT, and resource\
    \ registry which makes interoperable and cross-scale management possible\nin agricultural\
    \ landscape [71].\nIn addition, the use of digital twin system as a decision support\
    \ system can beneﬁt and\nbe adopted for crop farming applications, and optimization\
    \ of products and farm system\nperformance. A digital twin model was implemented\
    \ by [36] in sustainable agriculture\nfor monitoring and control of product qualities,\
    \ adjustment of environmental conditions,\nidentiﬁcation of forecasting, and decision\
    \ support scenarios. In addition, a novel approach\nbased on digital twin paradigms\
    \ was developed to forecast yield, vegetation quality,\nand duration of plant\
    \ development [33]. Consequently, the quality of crop production\ncould be improved\
    \ due to detailed analysis and control of plant growth, and the efﬁciency\nof\
    \ farms could be improved due to automation of decision support processes through\n\
    the developed digital twin concept. Digital twin along with forecasting models\
    \ were able\nto provide feedback to farmers for a better decision-making scenario\
    \ in a reported study\nby [73]. Their proposed digital twin system consists of\
    \ a monitoring system to collect\nenvironmental condition data from an underground\
    \ farm, as well as data analysis and\nmodeling techniques to identify key parameters,\
    \ critical trends, and forecast operational\nscenarios. Furthermore, digital twin\
    \ was able to optimize productivity of crops in a\ngreenhouse environment through\
    \ climate control strategies and treatments related to\ncrop management [74].\n\
    Information from crop production machineries (e.g., tractors, harvesters, robots)\
    \ have\nbeen used in smart farming to optimize the performance and efﬁciency,\
    \ and reduce the fuel\nand energy consumption. However, the digital twin concepts\
    \ collect real-time data from\nthe devices and characterize the states of the\
    \ physical object continuously. This capability\nmakes it possible to predict\
    \ and prescribe solutions using the collected information from\nSensors 2022,\
    \ 22, 498\n8 of 16\nthe farm machineries. Hence, big data analytics coupled with\
    \ AI models are able to detect\nfailures in the machines before or in the early\
    \ stage of when breakdowns happen. In this\ncontext, the use of state-of-the-art\
    \ edge-computing systems may reduce latency by the\nlimited amount of transmitted\
    \ data and provide information from the crop production\nmachineries such as autonomous\
    \ robot, harvesters, and tractors to the digital twin concepts.\nThe digital twin\
    \ paradigm in crop farming can change production productivity, farm man-\nagement,\
    \ and sustainability at farm level. Advanced statistical models, machine learning\n\
    and data analytic approaches can provide farmers with more precise information\
    \ to make\nbetter decisions that were not possible previously. Based on the past\
    \ (historical) and current\ncontinuous knowledge from crop (sensors deployed at\
    \ farm) and environment data, the dig-\nital twin systems provide information\
    \ about future states of the farm, and offer solutions\nfor turning the collected\
    \ information into useful and actionable on-farm knowledge.\n4. Digital Twin in\
    \ Post-Harvest Process\nPost-harvest process is a stage of agricultural products\
    \ after harvesting until consum-\ning the products, which may include transportation,\
    \ drying, cooling, storage, and market-\ning. Through digital farming approaches,\
    \ the post-harvest processes could beneﬁt from loss\nreduction, improvement of\
    \ monitoring and optimization of food processing, storage condi-\ntions, marketing,\
    \ and transportation. Digital solutions allow monitoring real-time agri-food\n\
    supply chain to increase robustness and resilience of the chain [75], and lower\
    \ food waste\nand losses. The IoT platform supports the reduction of food losses\
    \ in post-harvest pro-\ncessing [76], and tracking of the product through the\
    \ food supply chain. To achieve food\nsecurity AI and big data analytics enable\
    \ data processing, optimization, and management\nin food and crop post-harvest\
    \ stages [77], also reducing waste and improving overall prof-\nitability [78].\
    \ The ICT offers solutions to monitor and control quality criteria of food and\n\
    agricultural products during post-harvest processing [43]. However, different\
    \ environmen-\ntal conditions, processing factors, and dynamic features of agricultural\
    \ product (e.g., shape,\nsize), environmental parameters (e.g., temperature, humidity),\
    \ handling, transportation,\nand storage of the products inﬂuence the quality\
    \ of post-harvest process [79].\nTo overcome these issues and increase the efﬁciency\
    \ of the system, digital twin ap-\nproaches have been used in post-harvest processing\
    \ to continuously monitor the products\nand update the processing stages [80].\
    \ Digital twins, as an expanding family of digital\nfarming could strengthen agri-food\
    \ systems, affect knowledge and skills of farm manage-\nment [44]. Digital twin\
    \ in post-harvest processes can be deﬁned as a digital representation\nof harvested\
    \ agricultural products based on the information collected from the products.\n\
    In this context, ref. [42] reported the digital twin concept of food processing\
    \ may include:\n(I) data collected from a physical system (food process operation)\
    \ by means of sensors that\nmeasure properties and variables of products and environmental\
    \ parameters, (II) an IoT\nplatform to provide sensor communication, data storage\
    \ and big data analytics, high-\nperformance computing, and link to the digital\
    \ twin assets, (III) a simulation platform that\nuses input data from physical\
    \ system for optimization, testing and validation of models,\nand provides decision\
    \ supports in the virtual world. In order to beneﬁt food process-\ning by developing\
    \ digital twin models, it is important to include accurate information\nrepresenting\
    \ production processes of the product, e.g., equipment, labor, and to create\n\
    realistic models with all existing boundaries and barriers [81]. In a study reported\
    \ by [82],\na digital twin of mango fruit was developed to simulate and qualify\
    \ thermal and associ-\nated bio-chemical behavior of the fruit through a post-harvest\
    \ supply chain. In order to\ndevelop the digital twin concept, environmental air\
    \ temperature as input was considered,\nand the actual supply chain conditions\
    \ were mimicked within mechanistic ﬁnite element\nmodels [82]. Moreover, the impact\
    \ of higher air speed on storage life, cold chain length,\nand delivery air temperature\
    \ on the fruit quality were considered in the digital twin. It was\nreported that\
    \ the digital twin allows to monitor and predict temperature-dependent fruit\n\
    quality losses, improve refrigeration and logistic processes, consequently, it\
    \ can reduce\nfood losses [82]. Furthermore, it is reported that the digital twin\
    \ can help horticultural\nSensors 2022, 22, 498\n9 of 16\nproducts along with\
    \ the post-harvest life, and can be used to forecast the shelf-life of\nagricultural\
    \ products through the cold chain [45]. It can support food consumers as well\n\
    as food business owners for tracking of the products, logistics, and marketing\
    \ decisions;\nhowever, the existing digital twin concept needs to be enhanced\
    \ by considering more bio-\nchemical and physical features [45]. Ref. [83] proposed\
    \ a digital twin concept food supply\nchain analysis. Their developed digital\
    \ twin includes: (I) a network based on knowledge\nfrom, e.g., customers, suppliers,\
    \ and factories, (II) some parameters, e.g., in production,\ntransportation, warehouses,\
    \ sourcing, shipment costs, and policies, (III) various operational\nparameters,\
    \ e.g., demand, quality, target inventory, and vehicle capacity. It was found\n\
    that the developed digital twin can be used for optimization, simulation, and\
    \ analysis of\noperation and performance changes in the food supply chain [83].\n\
    According to [43], digital twin in post-harvest can be considered as mechanistic,\n\
    statistical, and intelligent models; however, it was found that the physics-based\
    \ mechanistic\ndigital twin concepts can evaluate the quality of fresh agricultural\
    \ products better than\nthe others. Physics-based digital twins were developed\
    \ on 331 cold chain shipments of\nfour fruits (i.e., cucumber, eggplant, strawberry,\
    \ raspberry) by [84]. Based on digital twin\nconcepts, it was found that the quality\
    \ of fruits may be affected (around 43–85%) before\nbeing delivered to stores.\n\
    The post-harvest processing has improved through the application of digital solutions\n\
    over the last several years. However, the use of the digital twin paradigm is\
    \ receiving more\nattention in post-harvest food processing due to the future\
    \ product quality prediction and\ncost reduction. The digital twin of post-harvest\
    \ processes may be developed to model,\noptimize, represent, and characterize\
    \ the design and operational parameters such as quality,\nsafety, ingredients,\
    \ shelf-life, and product status, which need to be considered by researchers\n\
    in future studies.\n5. Challenges and Future Needs\nSummary of the digital twin\
    \ concepts developed in the literature for different purposes\nin agricultural\
    \ ﬁelds, including soil, irrigation, crop monitoring, robotics, farm machinery,\n\
    and post-harvest processing, is presented in Tables 2–4. These tables show that\
    \ the digital\ntwin paradigm is in the early stage of research and development\
    \ in the agricultural context,\nand future studies in terms of knowledge, technological,\
    \ system development, and application\naspects of digital twin concepts in different\
    \ fields of agriculture should be considered.\nTable 2. Summary of soil and irrigation\

    \ the agricultural\nsoil by considering the soil quality and properties may accommodate\
    \ plant productivity,\nhealth, and yield, save water, and reduce chemical usage.\
    \ Many elements of the soil,\nirrigation, and environmental parameters in agricultural\
    \ land can be continuously mon-\nitored, analyzed, and their management strategies\
    \ optimized using big data analytics,\nmachine learning models, and decision support\
    \ systems embedded in the digital twin\nconcepts. The combination of soil and\
    \ irrigation digital twin approaches to record, monitor,\nand analyze agricultural\
    \ land changes may lead to improved performance of crop farming.\nFor instance,\
    \ simulation of soil structure along with data-driven updating models could\n\
    connect farmers to the farm using the IoT technology and present, in detail, pictures\
    \ of\nparameters that impact the soil, irrigation, and crop yield. However, few\
    \ studies focus on\nthe development of digital twin concepts of agriculture soil\
    \ with higher degree of ﬂexibility\nas well as considering a wider range of operation\
    \ than existing simulation models. Soil\nsensors could constantly measure and\
    \ record the dynamic condition of arable soil, e.g.,\nSensors 2022, 22, 498\n\
    11 of 16\nwater holding capacity, moisture, temperature [53]. These data, along\
    \ with information\nfrom soil structure and simulation techniques, can be transferred\
    \ to digital twin concepts,\nand constant feedback from the digital world may\
    \ advise real-time responses for soil and\nwater management as well as control\
    \ systems. In recent years, there has been rapid growth\nin the digital farming\
    \ scenarios, use of remote sensing, digital soil mapping, and develop-\nment of\
    \ software platforms. However, researches needed to fuse the developed techniques\n\
    along with the IoT, edge-computing, AI, data analytics, and simulation techniques\
    \ that\ncould lead to development of a digital twin paradigm is in an early stage\
    \ and needs to\nbe addressed in future studies. Furthermore, researchers need\
    \ to consider the practical\nchallenges of digital twin-based systems in soil\
    \ and irrigation as digital twins are multi-\nand interdisciplinary techniques\
    \ and require systems engineering perspectives [90].\nDigital twin offers real-time\
    \ simulation of farm machinery and robots that can beneﬁt\noptimal design of the\
    \ products, interaction with the environment, energy usage, and main-\ntenance\
    \ strategies. Digital twin concepts have the possibility to predict failures in\
    \ farm\nmachinery and support decision-making scenarios in plant production. Farm\
    \ owners can\nbe able to connect to the machines through virtual world for monitoring\
    \ and tracking of the\ndevices in agricultural farms. Digital twin systems are\
    \ accompanied by recording a large\namount of data and exchanging information\
    \ between different assets; hence compiling\nand analyzing these data is a challenge\
    \ facing farms, particularly in some rural areas with\npoor internet and technological\
    \ infrastructures [91]. Other alternatives, e.g., Long Range\ntechnology based\
    \ on wireless sensor networks communication and edge-computing could\nbe used\
    \ to mitigate internet access problems in rural areas for the connection part\
    \ of the\ndigital twin concepts [32,92]. Future opportunities for the implementation\
    \ of digital twin\nsystems in crop farm technologies could lie in the development\
    \ of standards as well as data\ntransferring and communication strategies in this\
    \ context.\nThe digital twin of crop production using big data collected from\
    \ crop and farm ma-\nchinery as well as robots, analytical and AI models, IoT,\
    \ and satellite and drone information\ncould allow simulating crop, environmental,\
    \ and farm conditions in the digital world to\ndetermine unknown and unseen issues\
    \ before happening in the physical world. Agricul-\ntural objects (crops in particular)\
    \ need frequent updates in data to support information\nanalysis and decision-making\
    \ processes [93] which in turn can promote sustainable farming\npractices and\
    \ save energy usage in crop productions. In this context, greater effort should\n\
    be focused in the future on characterization and development of frameworks for\
    \ more effec-\ntive practical digital twin paradigms. In crop farming, all information\
    \ may not be recorded\nand tracked using digital sensors; however, combining data\
    \ from different sources could\nimprove the virtual representation of the farm\
    \ operation and environment [73]. Continuous\nmonitoring of crops in digital twin\
    \ systems by simulating the dynamic farm conditions\nand considering the effect\
    \ of management, climate, and environmental conditions on the\nplant growth and\
    \ use of data-driven models along with sensor fusion techniques could\nhelp to\
    \ identify deviations from the normal conditions of the plant, and forecast growth\n\
    stages to reduce risk of environmental and management effects. In future, different\
    \ digital\ntwin concepts might be applied to copy the complex physical system\
    \ of crop farming in\nthe digital world and incorporate variable sensors, data\
    \ collecting strategies, modeling,\nforecasting, and simulation approaches in\
    \ crop farming.\nIn addition, digital twin concepts can support monitoring, tracking,\
    \ and analysis of\nfood through the entire supply chain. Development of a digital\
    \ copy of an agricultural\nproduct to monitor post-harvest processing could be\
    \ used to optimize the process, reduce\nenergy use, labor, and food losses based\
    \ on information from different sensors and simula-\ntion models. Future studies\
    \ need to be carried out to consider more environmental and\npost-harvest product\
    \ features for the development of robust digital twins [45]. Another\nmajor challenge\
    \ in the development of digital twin for post-harvest processing to minimize\n\
    quality losses and improve the shelf-life of the product is considering the value\
    \ chain of\nagricultural products from farm to fork [43], which has not been addressed\
    \ yet. In post-\nharvest processing to reduce uncertainty in digital twins and\
    \ enable the consumer to trust\nSensors 2022, 22, 498\n12 of 16\nthe output of\
    \ digital twin concepts, detailed experimental and data collection approaches\n\
    along with numerical modeling and validation techniques need be considered.\n\
    6. Conclusions\nEmploying digital technology has helped agricultural farm managers\
    \ to improve\nefﬁciency, yield, and reduce losses. There are different types of\
    \ digital farming paradigms\nin the literature that could be used in digital twin\
    \ concepts as the next generation of\ndigitalization in the agricultural ﬁeld.\
    \ The results of this review show that the digital twin\nconcepts in agriculture\
    \ and food processing have, so far, been little exploited in research.\nThere\
    \ are several research challenges and opportunities in different stages of digital\
    \ farming.\nDigital twin paradigms can be meaningfully utilized for soil and irrigation,\
    \ crop, robots and\nfarm machinery, and post-harvest food processing in the agricultural\
    \ ﬁeld. In this context,\nmost of the studies have focused on the development\
    \ of digital twins by considering some\nlimited parameters in agricultural sectors.\
    \ Deploying of state-of-the-art technologies, e.g.,\nAI, advanced statistical\
    \ and optimization models, big data analytics, and three-dimensional\nsimulation,\
    \ offer further possibilities for improvement in farm management. With real-\n\
    time and continuous information about agricultural assets, virtual models can\
    \ predict\nand address unseen issues in the ﬁelds. It may support farmers to decline\
    \ the economic\npressure on the agricultural sector and labor issues, and help\
    \ policy makers responsible for\nfood security and environmental protection, towards\
    \ strengthening the agriculture sector.\nIn addition, it facilitates the work\
    \ of researchers exploring methods to track and monitor\ncrop farm machinery,\
    \ agricultural and post-harvest products or reduce water, chemicals,\nand energy\
    \ usage in digital farming. Although many digital twin systems in engineering,\n\
    manufacturing, and health contexts have been developed, further attempts need\
    \ to be\nconsidered in the agricultural context towards the development of digital\
    \ twin systems\nthat can monitor, record, and analyze data, to predict and prescribe\
    \ the best decision for\ndigital farming management.\nAuthor Contributions: Conceptualization,\

  key_findings:
  - DTs have the potential to revolutionize irrigation management by providing real-time
    monitoring, automated decision-making, and optimization capabilities.
  - The integration of ML with DTs can further enhance the accuracy and efficiency
    of irrigation systems by enabling data-driven insights and predictive analytics.
  - Implementing DTs in agriculture requires careful consideration of data quality,
    connectivity, security, and the integration of different technologies and stakeholders.
  limitations:
  - The paper mainly focuses on the conceptual aspects of DT in irrigation and does
    not provide a comprehensive review of existing DT implementations or case studies.
  - It lacks a discussion on potential challenges and limitations of implementing
    DTs in real-world agricultural scenarios.
  - The paper does not explore the integration of DTs with other aspects of smart
    farming or the broader agricultural ecosystem.
  main_objective: To explore the application of DTs in optimizing irrigation management
    systems and enhancing agricultural productivity.

    Get rights and content Abstract Variations of the crop water stress index (CWSI)
    have been used to characterize plant water stress and schedule irrigations. Usually,
    this thermal-based stress index has been calculated from measurements taken once
    daily or over a short period of time, near solar noon or after and in cloud free
    conditions. A method of integrating the CWSI over a day was developed to avoid
    the noise that may occur if weather prevents a clear CWSI signal near solar noon.
    This CWSI and time threshold (CWSI-TT) was the accumulated time that the CWSI
    was greater than a threshold value (0.45); and it was compared with a time threshold
    (CWSI-TT) based on a well-watered crop. We investigated the effectiveness of the
    CWSI-TT to automatically control irrigation of short and long season grain sorghum
    hybrids (Sorghum bicolor (L.) Moench, NC+ 5C35 and Pioneer 84G62); and to examine
    crop response to deficit irrigation treatments (i.e. 80%, 55%, 30% and 0% of full
    replenishment of soil water depletion to 1.5-m depth). Results from automated
    irrigation scheduling were compared to those from manual irrigation based on weekly
    neutron probe readings. In 2009, results from the Automatic irrigation were mixed;
    biomass yields in the 55% and 0% treatments, dry grain yields in the 80% and 0%
    treatments, and WUE in the 80%, 55%, and 0% treatments were not significantly
    different from those in the corresponding Manual treatments. However, dry grain
    yields in the 55% and 30% treatments were significantly less than those in the
    Manual control plots. These differences were due mainly to soil water variability
    in the beginning of the growing season. This conclusion is reinforced by the fact
    that IWUE for dry grain yield was not significantly different for 30% and 55%
    treatments, and was significantly greater for Automatic control at 80%. In 2010,
    there were no significant differences in biomass, dry grain yield, WUE, or IWUE
    for irrigation control methods when compared across the same amount treatments.
    Similar results between irrigation methods for at least the highest irrigation
    rate (80% of soil water depletion) in 2009 and among all irrigation treatment
    amounts in 2010 indicate that the CWSI-TT method can be an effective trigger for
    automatically scheduling either full or deficit irrigations for grain sorghum
    in a semi-arid region. Highlights ► We used a plant feedback method and remote
    sensing to successfully schedule irrigations. ► A CWSI calculated over daylight
    hours in a 24 h period is useful in timing irrigations for sorghum. ► Crop WUE
    was optimal at the level of 55% replacement of soil water depletion to field capacity.

    Sorghum is important to the livestock and ethanol industries in the United States.
    Both early and late maturing varieties of grain sorghum are grown in the Northern
    High Plains area of Texas, where approximately 40% of grain sorghum is irrigated,
    resulting in yields double those from dryland farming (Colaizzi et al., 2009).
    Irrigation in this semi-arid region is accomplished primarily with center pivot
    systems. If irrigation strategies can be automated, farmers can save time and
    labor by allowing the automated system to monitor crop water status and help determine
    when to apply irrigations. If automated irrigation systems produce yields and
    water use efficiencies comparable to those resulting from prior best irrigation
    scheduling practices, then farmers can realize greater profitability. The theoretical
    crop water stress index (CWSI) developed by Jackson et al. (1981) was based on
    energy balance analysis. This thermal stress index has been investigated to characterize
    plant water stress (Howell et al., 1986, Yuan et al., 2004, Möeller et al., 2007),
    estimate crop productivity and water stress relationships (Wanjura et al., 1990),
    and has been used as a tool for irrigation timing (Throssel et al., 1987, Nielsen,
    1990, Garrot et al., 1994, Gontia and Tiwari, 2008), usually in its empirical
    form. The theoretical CWSI incorporates incoming solar radiation, relative humidity,
    air temperature, wind speed, canopy resistance at potential evapotranspiration,
    and crop height. Its general form is: (1) where (Tc − Ta) is the measured difference
    between crop canopy temperature and air temperature, (Tc − Ta)ll is the lower
    limit representing the temperature difference for a well watered crop, and (Tc
    − Ta)ul is the upper limit representing the temperature difference between the
    crop canopy and ambient air when the plants are severely stressed (Jackson et
    al., 1988). The CWSI tends towards 0 after irrigations and progressively climbs
    towards 1 as soil water is depleted. Many studies have used differential irrigation
    amounts on different crops and calculated the corresponding CWSI values (alfalfa
    – Hattendorf et al., 1988; sorghum – Olufayo et al., 1996; Bermuda grass – Farahani
    et al., 1993, Emekli et al., 2007; corn – Yazar et al., 1999; cotton – Barbosa
    da Silva and Rao, 2005). A few studies have used an established CWSI value to
    trigger irrigations on soybean (Nielsen, 1990) and wheat (Garrot et al., 1994).
    Typically, the measurements were either instantaneous (Hattendorf et al., 1988,
    Nielsen, 1990, Farahani et al., 1993) or were taken as average values over a short
    interval usually near solar noon (Garrot et al., 1994, Olufayo et al., 1996, Ajayi
    and Olufayo, 2004, Gontia and Tiwari, 2008). Irrigation scheduling using the CWSI
    has not always been successful, and it has not become widely adopted. One problem
    is that instantaneous measurements, or mean values from measurements take over
    a short time period near solar noon, may be influenced by passing clouds, wind
    gusts or other micrometeorological incidents. We hypothesized that assessing the
    CWSI over daylight hours would provide a more stable and relevant index for irrigation
    scheduling (i.e. timing) because it would average and thus smooth out the effects
    of short-term microclimatological events and more reliably respond to the plant
    water status. A method of integrating the CWSI over a day was developed. This
    CWSI-TT was the accumulated time that the stress index, CWSI, was greater than
    a threshold value (0.45), for a specified time threshold (CWSI-TT) based on a
    well-watered crop. In this study, we compared a scientifically based manual method
    for irrigation scheduling that of direct soil water measurements using a neutron
    probe, to the automated plant-feedback method comprised of infrared thermometers
    (IRTs) and microclimatological instrumentation for remote sensing of crop water
    status. While farmers or crop advisers can use a neutron probe to determine soil
    water status, the disadvantages of the neutron scattering method include the radiation
    hazard and attendant licensing requirements, relatively poor (and uncertain) spatial
    resolution, and the soil specific calibration requirement (Or and Wraith, 2002).
    The initial investment for a neutron probe ranges in cost from $4000 to $6000.
    The system for remotely sensing crop water status with IRTs and meteorological
    instrumentation is variable depending on the number of IRTs and the manufacturer.
    However, with the advent of low-cost wireless sensors (Mahan et al., 2010, O''Shaughnessy
    et al., 2011) and sensor network systems (O''Shaughnessy and Evett, 2010), the
    cost is closer to the lower-end of the purchase price for a single neutron probe.
    Additionally automated systems using the center pivot as a platform for IRTs can
    be used to provide crop canopy temperature maps on a frequent basis (Peters and
    Evett, 2007), which will have better spatial and temporal resolution than weekly
    neutron probe readings. The objectives of this study were to: (1) investigate
    the effectiveness of the CWSI-TT method to automatically trigger irrigations;
    and (2) and to examine grain sorghum response to deficit irrigation treatment
    amounts in a semi-arid region. 2. Materials and methods 2.1. Experimental site
    Experiments took place at the Conservation Production and Research Laboratory,
    Bushland, TX (35°11′N, 102°06′W, 1174 m above mean sea level). The field soil
    was a Pullman clay loam, a fine, mixed, superactive, thermic, Torrertic Paleustoll
    (Soil Survey Staff, 2004). The field capacity (0.33 m3 m−3) and wilting point
    (0.18 m3 m−3) water contents were assumed uniform across the center pivot field.
    The climate is semi-arid with an average annual rainfall of 470 mm. 2.2. Sorghum
    varieties and agronomics We used a short and long season variety in this experiment
    since both varieties are important to farmers in this area. Almost invariably,
    a full-season variety will out-yield a good early-season hybrid, other conditions
    being equal and favorable for sorghum growth. But, short season varieties use
    less water over a growing season and can be used as a replacement crop or may
    provide economic relief if an earlier crop is damaged due to extreme weather conditions
    or harmful chemical residuals. Early maturing or short season (SS) grain sorghum
    (Sorghum bicolor (L.) Moench), variety NC+ 5C35,1 was planted on day of year (DOY)
    175 (June 24) in 2009, and a late maturing variety or long season (LS) sorghum,
    Pioneer 84G62, was planted on June 1 (DOY 152) in 2010. Both crops were planted
    in concentric rows on beds spaced 0.76-m apart under a three span center pivot
    irrigation system. Irrigations were applied using low energy precision application
    (LEPA) drag socks (Lyle and Bordovsky, 1983) in every other furrow. Dikes were
    placed in the furrows to reduce runoff. The sorghum varieties were cultivated
    in a manner similar to production practices in the region. Fertilizer was applied
    based on preplant soil samples tested by a commercial soil testing laboratory.
    The low nitrogen application for 2009 indicates residual nitrogen from the previous
    year''s fallowed field after a failed cotton crop. Fertilizers and herbicides
    for weed control were applied through the pivot lateral (Table 1). Table 1. Summary

    Oct 15–24 (DOY 288–295) Total above-ground biomass and grain yields were hand-harvested
    from a 10 m2 area in each of the 48 treatment plots prior to mechanical harvesting.
    Biomass samples were dried in an oven at 60 °C, and heads were stored in cotton
    bags and air-dried at room temperature in a drying room. 2.3. Treatments and plot
    design Two irrigation control method treatments were used; Automatic and Manual
    as described later. For each irrigation control method, four irrigation amount
    treatments were applied (80%, 55%, 30%, and 0% (dryland) of full; full being defined
    differently for automatic and manual control methods as discussed later). Treatment
    plots were arranged in six blocks arc-wise around half of the center pivot circle
    (Fig. 1a and b) with alternating blocks for manual and automatic irrigation scheduling.
    Within each block, irrigation treatment amounts were randomly assigned with two
    replications arranged radially from the pivot point. Radial and arc-wise blocking
    was designed to control for effects of position along the lateral on irrigation
    application rate and to control for effects of possible runoff. Typically, alternating
    halves of our pivot fields are cropped each year for experimentation and a cover
    crop is grown on the opposite semi-circle to help even-out the soil water profile.
    In 2009, however, it was necessary to plant sorghum on the same semi-circle where
    cotton was grown under differential irrigation treatments in the previous year.

    irrigation system. Manual Blocks I, II, and III were irrigated based on weekly
    neutron probe readings and Automatic Blocks I, II, and III were irrigated automatically
    based on the CWSI-TT trigger. 2.4. Manual irrigation scheduling Manual irrigations
    were scheduled over 2–3 days in a 7-day period, following weekly soil water readings
    by neutron methods usually taken on Monday mornings. Manual irrigations were performed
    on odd-numbered days of the year (DOY) based on 80%, 55%, 30%, and 0% (designated
    I80%M, I55%M, I30%M, and I0%M, respectively) of full replenishment to field capacity
    of water depletion in the top 1.5 m of soil. Soil water content was determined
    using a neutron probe (NP) (model 503DR, Campbell Pacific Nuclear, Martinez, CA)
    in 0.2-m increments down to 2.4 m in the I80%M treatment plots. In all other treatment
    plots, soil water was measured once every 30 days for soil water balance computation
    of evapotranspiration (ET) only. Access tubes were placed in a row in the center
    of each plot (18 rows wide). The neutron probe was field calibrated to accuracy
    of better than 0.01 m3 m−3, resulting in separate calibrations from three distinct
    soil layers, Ap, Bt and Btca, using methods described by Evett (2008). Any rainfall
    occurring prior to irrigation of the total amount for the week was subtracted
    from the required total. Irrigation level was determined by nozzle discharge rate,
    horizontal spacing of the drop hoses, and the travel speed of the center pivot.
    2.5. Automatic irrigation scheduling When scheduled by the CWSI-TT algorithm,
    automatic irrigations were applied on even DOY. The CWSI-TT algorithm used a CWSI
    threshold of 0.45, and a time threshold of 420 min. These thresholds were determined
    from well-watered grain sorghum grown on weighing lysimeter fields at Bushland,
    Texas in 1988. The CWSI was calculated every 5 min, and each time the index was
    greater than 0.45 during daylight hours, 5 min of time were accumulated. At midnight,
    if the cumulative time for the past 24 h was greater than 420 min, then an irrigation
    was scheduled to be applied using computer control over the automatic blocks of
    the field the following morning. Because Manual and Automatic irrigations were
    scheduled on alternate days, the full irrigation level for automatic treatments
    was based on twice the peak daily crop water use rate of grain sorghum at the
    location (2 × 10 mm = 20 mm) (Steiner et al., 1991). Irrigations for the automatic
    control treatments were 80%, 55%, 30% and 0% (designated I80%A, I55%A, I30%A,
    and I0%A) of 20 mm. Automatic irrigation scheduling was initiated when the SS
    variety was in the 5th leaf stage, summer 2009, and when the LS variety was in
    the 7th leaf stage during the summer of 2010. 2.6. Canopy temperature and microclimate
    instrumentation A total of 16 infrared thermometers (IRTs) (Exergen model IRt/c.5:1-Type
    T, Watertown, Mass.) were mounted on the pivot lateral and wired to a datalogger
    (CR21X, Campbell Scientific, Logan, UT) to measure and record crop canopy temperature
    (Tc). The IRT sensors were calibrated in a controlled temperature environment
    using a blackbody calibrator (CES100, Electro Optical Industries, Inc., Santa
    Barbara, CA). Sensors were mounted on vertical masts placed at opposite edges
    of each concentric treatment plot, with two sensors facing inwards towards the
    canopy in each plot at an oblique, down-looking angle to reduce sun angle effects
    and viewing of bare soil. The sensors were located forward of the drop hoses approximately
    1.5 m above the crop canopy. An IRT was placed in each of the two I80%A treatment
    plots in Auto Block I (Fig. 1) to record reference temperature for a well-watered
    crop. Crop canopy temperatures recorded from the moving irrigation system were
    averaged for the period of time it took for the system to move across each plot,
    and so represented a mean one-time-of-day plot-specific temperature. These plot-specific
    temperatures were scaled using the method of Peters and Evett (2004) to produce
    estimates of the plot temperature over the entire daytime. Wind speed (uz) and
    solar radiation (Rs, W m−2) were measured every 2 s at a height (z) of 2 m (using
    a RM-Young Wind Sentry Set and LI-COR 200SZ, respectively) using a datalogger
    (model CR10X, Campbell Scientific, Logan, UT) located in plot 12 (Fig. 1) and
    reported as 5-min mean values. Air temperature (Ta, °C), relative humidity (RH,
    %), and precipitation (P, mm) were measured using a HMPC45 probe and TE-52 mm
    bucket wired to a datalogger (CR10X, Campbell Scientific, Logan, UT) mounted near
    the end of the pivot lateral. Data from each of the dataloggers were transmitted
    using radio frequency (RF) telemetry in the 900 MHz frequency to a base station
    computer located at the pivot point. 2.7. CWSI calculations The upper (Tul) and
    lower temperatures (Tll), boundaries of the CWSI, were calculated from measured
    environmental parameters paired with scaled canopy temperature data using equations
    from FAO-56 (Allen et al., 1998). The upper limit was calculated for a non-transpiring
    crop (latent heat of evaporation = 0) using the equation (Jackson et al., 1988):
    (2) where Rn is the net radiation (MJ m−2 d−1) is estimated as the difference
    between incoming net shortwave and outgoing net longwave radiation using Eqs.
    (38), (39), and (40) in FAO-56 and an albedo (α) = 0.23; G = soil heat flux (MJ
    m−2 d−1) is estimated using Eq. (45) from FAO-56; ρ (kg m−3) is the density of
    air approximated as a function of air temperature; Cp = specific heat capacity
    of dry air (1013 J kg−1 °C−1); and ra is aerodynamic resistance (Eq. (4)). Using
    this upper boundary equation, assumes bulk canopy resistance, rc, approaches infinity.
    The lower limit, representing a fully transpiring crop, (Tc − Ta)ll is calculated
    using: (3) where γ is the psychometric constant (Pa °C−1); Δ is the slope of the
    saturated vapor pressure-temperature relationship calculated at the average of
    canopy and air temperature expressed in °C (as in Jackson et al., 1988); es is
    saturated vapor pressure, ea is actual vapor pressure, and ra is aerodynamic resistance
    (s m−1), computed as Eq. (4) (FAO-56): (4) where zm is the height of wind measurements
    (m); zom the roughness length (m) for momemtum transfer, approximated by 0.123
    × crop height; zh the height of humidity measurements (m); d the zero plane displacement
    height (m), approximated by 2/3 × crop height; zoh the roughness length governing
    transfer of heat and vapor (m), approximated by 0.1 × zom; k = von Karman''s constant
    = 0.41; and uz = wind speed (m s−1). Crop height was estimated using data from
    sorghum grown on the large weighing lysimeter fields at Bushland, TX. 2.8. Water
    use and water use efficiency calculations Crop water use (ETc, mm) was calculated
    using the soil water balance equation (Evett, 2002): (5) where ETc is evapotranspiration,
    ΔS is the change in soil water stored in the profile as determined using the NP
    (final minus initial soil water reading), R is runoff, P is precipitation (mm),
    I is the irrigation water applied (mm), and F is flux across the lower boundary
    of the control volume (taken as positive when entering the control volume), all
    in units of mm. Runoff and flux were assumed to be negligible because the field
    was furrow diked, plots were large enough that horizontal fluxes were important
    only in plot borders, and NP measurements indicated negligible flux in the 2.1
    to 2.3-m depth range. The average daily fractional soil water depletion (Df) in
    the root zone of the I80%A treatment plots was calculated as Df = Dp/TAW where
    Dp (depletion) was calculated using a daily soil water balance (Chapter 8-FAO-56
    in Allen et al., 1998). Total available water (TAW) is the total of the plant
    available water in the root zone (depth of 1.5 m) at field capacity. Daily Df
    was compared to daily average CWSI-TT values from the I80%A treatment plots. The
    comparison was only made between values from these plots since the irrigation
    triggers were based on data from these plots. Water use efficiency (kg m−3) was
    calculated as (6) where Yg is the economic yield (g m−2), and ETc is the crop
    water use (Howell, 2002). Irrigation water use efficiency (IWUE, kg m−3) was calculated
    as (7) where Ygi is the economic yield (g m−2) in the ith treatment level, Ygd
    is the dryland yield (g m−2), and IRRi is the irrigation water applied (mm) (Howell,
    2002). 2.9. Statistical analysis Results from each year were analyzed using the
    General Linear Models (GLM) procedures, and the Bonferroni t-test to perform multiple
    comparisons of treatment means at p = 0.05. Statistical software was SAS (SAS
    9.2, SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC). 3. Results and discussion 3.1. Climate and
    precipitation In 2009, rainfall from June through October totaled 228 mm, which
    was typical for the area and time of year. Seventy-four percent of rainfall for
    this growing season occurred between boot and flowering stage. In 2010, the majority
    of precipitation again fell between boot and flowering stage; however, the total
    precipitation for the 2010 growing season was 46% less than for 2009. Maximum
    daily temperatures and grass reference ET (ETo) values were also greater in August
    through October of 2010 than in 2009 (Table 2). Table 2. Climatic conditions for

    center pivot field at the beginning of the 2009 growing season was variable among
    treatment plots because circumstances forced cropping sorghum on the same field
    as had differential irrigation treatments for cotton in 2008. Those 2008 differential
    irrigation treatments resulted in soil water variability amongst the manual and
    automatic treatment plots at the beginning of the 2009 growing season (Table 3).
    Soil water variability in the 30% treatments was such that the mean initial water
    content was larger for the Manual treatments at the 50–230-cm depths and remained
    so at depths >50 cm throughout the season. For the 55% treatments, mean initial
    water content was larger for the Manual treatment below the 70-cm depth and continued
    so throughout the season. For the 80% treatments, mean initial water content was
    larger for the Manual treatment at the 50- and 70-cm depths, however, there was
    no clear difference in water contents between these Manual and the Automatic treatments
    at 90-cm depth and below throughout the season. Table 3. Treatment mean water

    Over the irrigation scheduling period (DOY 204–272), the Manual control treatments
    received 8–13% more water than those in the automatically irrigated blocks (Table
    4). Cumulative automatic irrigations were comparable in volume to manual irrigations
    until DOY 255 (Sept 12) (Fig. 2). Small differences between air and canopy temperatures
    and higher levels of RH (minimum daily average of 40% and maximum daily average
    of 92%) between DOY 255 and DOY 264 contributed to reduced CWSI levels, which
    reduced the number of automatic irrigations that were scheduled compared with
    those scheduled manually using soil water sensing. Table 4. Irrigation amounts

    treatments kept up with those for the manual control plots until DOY 251; (b)
    in 2010, automatic irrigation scheduling started on DOY 186. During the last week
    of the irrigation season, Sep 3 to Sep 10 (DOY 247–252), no automatic irrigation
    signals were received. In 2010, the soil water profile was nearly uniform among
    the 48 treatment plots; the average soil water content was 482 mm in the 1.5-m
    profile (0.32 m3 m−3), which was near field capacity, with a standard deviation
    of ±3 mm. Uniformity of the soil water profile was improved by the precipitation
    received in the early months of the calendar year, and also by the fact that the
    field was fallowed in the previous year. Irrigation amount differences between
    the Automatic and Manual methods were less than 3%; however, the automatic control
    method scheduled irrigations that did not match the Manual irrigations (i.e.,
    NP readings did not indicate a need to irrigate manual control plots) early in
    the season. Cumulative irrigations in the I80%A treatment plots were 39 mm greater
    than irrigations in the I80%M plots from July 5–July 31 (DOY 186–212). A frequent
    number of irrigation signals for the automatic control treatments were received
    during the week of Jul 19 to Jul 27, 2010. A site visit to the field indicated
    that these signals were false positives due to the sensors on the pivot being
    aimed at acute angles from the vertical and looking mainly at soil rather crop
    canopy surfaces. This likely contributed to the IRTs viewing more soil background
    than canopy cover at the onset of the irrigation season. During August, the irrigation
    amounts were nearly equivalent between irrigation methods; and near the end of
    the irrigation season, Sep 8–10 (DOY 251 to DOY 253), three manual irrigations
    were not matched by the automatic control method (Fig. 2) due to cloud cover and
    ambient air temperatures exceeding canopy temperatures. In addition to meeting
    crop water needs, irrigators are also concerned with the possibility of over-irrigating
    and causing surface runoff or deep percolation which can waste water and drive
    nutrients from the root zone. There was no evidence of deep percolation in any
    of the 80% irrigation treatment plots for years 2009 and 2010 as soil water content
    at the lower depths were stable (Fig. 3). Manual irrigations were continued longer
    to reduce lodging, which was observed especially in the 30% treatment plots. Download

    3.3.1. Difference between irrigation control methods Data for each variety of
    sorghum were analyzed separately. Analyses were made across irrigation methods,
    grouped by irrigation treatment amounts to make comparisons between manual and
    automatic irrigation scheduling. In 2009, biomass dry matter was significantly
    greater for the I80M% (F statistic = 10.5, p = 0.01), and I30M% treatment amounts
    (F statistic = 5.46, p = 0.04) (Table 5). There was no significant difference
    across irrigation scheduling methods between dry grain yields at the I80% irrigation
    amount or at the I0% amount. However, dry grain yields were significantly greater
    in the I55M% (F statistic = 5.15, p = 0.05) and I30M% (F statistic = 6.17, p =
    0.03) control treatments. Crop water use (ETc) was significantly greater in I80M%
    (F = 7.34, p = 0.02) and in the I55M% (F = 28.87, p = 0.0003) treatments, and
    grain yields were higher. Water use efficiency in the I30%A (F = 6.12, p = 0.033)
    was significantly less than that for the I30%M treatment due to the low grain
    yield produced in the I30%A treatment. Unger and Wiese (1979) reported an increase
    in sorghum yield of 17.6 kg ha−1 for each mm (1.76 kg m−3) increase in profile
    water content measured to 1.8-m depth at planting. If applied to the differential
    in profile water content on DOY 187, this would give an estimated 268 kg ha−1
    yield increase for manual irrigation at the 30% level (I30%M), and a 27 kg ha−1
    yield increase for manual irrigation at the 55% level (I55%M), which would explain
    in part the smaller yields from the automatic treatments at the 30% and 55% irrigation
    levels (I30%A and I55%A, respectively) in 2009. Table 5. Average plant biomass,

    test for significant differences among means. The overall means are based on data
    grouped by irrigation method. Mean values compared between irrigation method within
    a treatment amount for each variety of sorghum followed by the same lower case
    letter in each row are not significantly different (p < 0.05). Mean values within
    each irrigation method (manual vs. automatic) that are not significantly different
    are followed by the same capital letter in the columns for each section. The ‘Combined’

    applicable. In 2010, there was no significant difference between the two irrigation-scheduling
    methods when comparing overall mean biomass and dry grain yield, WUE, and IWUE
    responses for the automatic and manual treatment plots (Table 5). Moreover, biomass
    and dry grain yield, ETc, WUE and IWUE were not significantly different between
    irrigation methods within the same treatment amount. Given these results and the
    non-uniform initial conditions in 2009, we conclude that there was no important
    difference between the Manual and Automatic scheduling methods. 3.3.2. Differences
    across irrigation amount treatments To investigate biomass, dry grain yield, WUE,
    and IWUE across different irrigation amount treatments, analyses were performed
    on data from all treatment plots for a given year (Table 5). In 2009, biomass,
    dry grain yields, and ETc were significantly affected by irrigation levels. The
    greatest WUE was in the 55% treatment although not significantly different from
    the I80% treatment plots. These results are similar to those reported by Colaizzi
    et al. (2004) in that grain sorghum irrigated at levels of 100% and 75% of ET
    produced yields that were not significantly different. The greatest IWUE occurred
    in the I55% treatment plots, yet they were not significantly different than the
    I30% treatment plots. In 2010, biomass and dry grain yields were significantly
    greater in the highest irrigated treatment plots (80% and 55%) as compared with
    the deficit treatments of 30% and 0%. Crop water use and WUE were significantly
    greater between irrigated (I80%, I55%, and I30%) and non-irrigated plots (I0%),
    but there were no significant differences among the irrigated treatment plots.
    The largest average yield increase for both sorghum varieties occurred between
    the 30% and 55% amount treatments, where the average yield increase was 2.4 Mg
    ha−1 in 2009. These results are similar to findings reported by Schneider and
    Howell (1999) for grain sorghum irrigated between 25% and 50% of crop ET at Bushland,
    TX. Sorghum was less responsive in 2010 to different irrigation levels as compared
    to the previous year, i.e. crop water use and WUE was not significantly different
    between the three irrigation treatment levels (80%, 55%, and 30%). The average
    increase in yield between the 30% and 55% treatment amounts was reduced by 45%.
    Soil water levels were similar for these treatments through DOY 216 for both irrigation
    methods (Fig. 4). Download : Download full-size image Fig. 4. Average soil water
    depletion at the root zone for the irrigation levels in the 30%, 55%, and 80%
    treatment levels for both the automatic and manual control methods in years (top)
    2009; and 2010 (bottom). 3.4. CWSI-TT and soil water depletion In 2009, regression
    analysis of the CWSI-TT and Df revealed a significant relationship: CWSI-TT =
    740.36Df + 118.06, r2 = 0.34, F = 14.71, and p < 0.0001. The CWSI-TT index declined
    after irrigations, as expected, and was nearly zero on cloudy days and days with
    precipitation (Fig. 5a). In the 2009 growing season, Df was lowest on August 1
    (DOY 213) after 32 mm of rainfall and increased to its greatest amount on August
    8 (DOY 220), during the later vegetative stage. Soil waster depletion also rose
    after the onset of the reproductive stage (August 18, DOY 230) and during the
    non-irrigation period between September 12 and 21 (DOY 255 and 264) when no irrigation
    signals were triggered. Download : Download full-size image Fig. 5. The CWSI-TT
    values plotted with the average fraction of depletion in the root zone (to a depth
    of 1.5 m) for the I80%A treatment plots in: for SS variety sorghum in 2009 (top
    diagram); and LS variety sorghum in 2010 (bottom diagram). Early in 2010, DOY
    196–198, during the vegetative phase, mean fractional soil water depletion was
    low (0.15), while the CWSI-TT index was at high levels, i.e. 550–800 min (Fig.
    5b). As mentioned previously, this was likely due to the IRTs viewing soil background
    in addition to vegetative cover in the early portion of the irrigation season.
    Fractional soil water depletion increased at the reproductive stage (near flowering)
    from DOY 209 to 216 and then again prior to the soft dough stage. Variation of
    the CWSI-TT followed this pattern and was recorded as increasing from DOY 213
    to 216. Between DOY 233 and DOY 238, as soil water depletion increased the CWSI-TT
    trended upwards but was also impacted by irrigations and rainfall. Late in the
    irrigation season from DOY 242 to 246, soil water depletion decreased, but the
    CWSI-TT remained high. This may be due to IRTs viewing heads of drying grain (with
    no transpiration) more so than transpiring canopy leaves. There was a significant
    relationship between the CWSI-TT and Df in 2010 after DOY 210 and through DOY
    254; CWSI-TT = 783.9 × CWSI-TT + 139.4, r2 = 0.22, F = 6.5, p < 0.02. However,
    the relationship was not as strong as 2009, which may have been due to the smaller
    changes in Df over the 2010 growing season. Disadvantages to using the CWSI-TT
    was that cloud cover could reduce irrigation triggering at any time during the
    growing season, and IRT temperature readings could be influenced by changing crop
    aspect (e.g., leaf orientation and erectness, head formation) throughout the growing
    season. This problem motivates future research into multi-band sensor systems
    that may allow recognition of soil background and plant aspect changes that may
    allow corresponding qualification or correction of thermal IR data. Soil water
    sensors and soil water balance equations (estimated from ETo) could be used to
    augment decisions for irrigation scheduling with the CWSI-TT and may be helpful
    in the case where it takes a pivot more than two days to traverse a field. 4.
    Conclusions A theoretical CWSI index summed over daylight hours was investigated
    for its effectiveness as a trigger for automatic irrigation scheduling of two
    varieties of grain sorghum. Crop biomass and dry grain yield responses from the
    Automatic treatment plots compared well to those from manual scientific irrigation
    scheduling based on soil water content, in the highest irrigation treatment level
    (I80%) in 2009 and in all irrigation treatment levels in 2010. Soil water variability
    early in growing season 2009 affected yield production, and may have affected
    the results at the two lower irrigation amounts (I50% and I30%). Automatic irrigations
    generally occurred every 2–4 days after the crop was past boot stage. The constant
    irrigation applications in the amount of twice peak daily crop water usage on
    a frequent basis with LEPA drag socks was a favorable method for irrigation delivery
    to both early and late maturing grain sorghum. A shortcoming of using the CWIS-TT,
    which is common to all thermal-based indices using radiometric sensors, is that
    false positive irrigation triggers may be generated early in the season, which
    could lead to over irrigation. Although soil water variability confounded some
    results in 2009, yields from the automatic 80% treatment plots (plots from which
    the CWSI-TT were calculated over daylight hours) were similar to scientific irrigation
    scheduling using a neutron probe in the manual 80% treatment plots for both years
    and for all treatment levels in 2010. This supports the use of the CWSI-TT as
    an effective method for irrigation scheduling of grain sorghum. While farmers
    are not likely to use a neutron probe to take soil water measurements, they may
    invest in moving sprinkler systems that are outfitted with sensor networks for
    automated control and continuous plant water status feedback as a means to manage
    irrigation scheduling. Using the automated system would alleviate the additional
    time and expense required to drive to each pivot field and take soil water measurements
    on a weekly basis. Further research is necessary to investigate whether the CWSI-TT
    is effective for irrigation scheduling of other crops in this region and to determine
    which decision support methods would best augment plant feedback irrigation scheduling.

    and content Abstract Prior to the discussion on approaches to combine irrigation
    scheduling and water application practices, several farm irrigation performance
    indicators are defined and analysed. These indicators concern the uniformity of
    water distribution along an irrigated field and the efficiency of on-farm water
    application. Then, the analysis focus is on three main irrigation systems: surface,
    sprinkler and microirrigation. For each of these systems, the analysis concerns
    the main characteristics and constraints of the systems, more relevant aspects
    influencing irrigation performances, and approaches which could lead to a more
    appropriate coupling of irrigation scheduling and water application methods. Conclusions
    point out on the need for combined improvements in irrigation scheduling and methods,
    for expanding field evaluation of irrigation in farmers fields, for improved design
    of on-farm systems, and for quality control of irrigation equipments and design.

    1. Introduction Irrigation scheduling is the farmers'' decision process related
    to `when'' to irrigate and `how much'' water to apply to a crop. The irrigation
    method concerns `how'' that desired water depth is applied to the field. Irrigation
    scheduling requires knowledge on crop water requirements and yield responses to
    water, the constraints specific to each irrigation method and irrigation equipment,
    the limitations relative to the water supply system and the financial and economic
    implications of the irrigation practice (Heermann, 1996). To improve the irrigation
    method requires the consideration of the factors influencing the hydraulic processes,
    the water infiltration and the uniformity of water application to the entire field
    (Hlavek, 1992). The consideration of all these aspects makes irrigation management
    a complex decision making and field practice process. Research has made available
    a large number of irrigation scheduling tools including procedures to compute
    crop water requirements, to simulate the soil water balance, to estimate the impact
    of water deficits on yields and to estimate the economic returns of irrigation.
    However, irrigation scheduling is not yet utilised by the majority of farmers.
    Furthermore, only limited irrigation scheduling information is utilised worldwide
    by irrigation system managers, extensionists or farmer advisers. However, it is
    recognised that the adoption of appropriate irrigation scheduling practices could
    lead to increased yields and greater profit for farmers, significant water savings,
    reduced environmental impacts of irrigation and improved sustainability of irrigated
    agriculture (Smith et al., 1996). Enormous progress has been achieved in modernizing
    irrigation methods. This includes numerous equipments and automation tools, field
    evaluation techniques and models for design and analysis. However, with limited
    exceptions, developments concerning the irrigation methods and irrigation scheduling
    are not combined to the desirable extent. Consequently, there is a need to better
    identify the factors that could enhance the adoption of appropriate irrigation
    management practices and favour the transfer of technology from research to practice.
    These aspects are particularly important in that they concern the inter-relationships
    between on-farm irrigation systems and irrigation scheduling (Pereira, 1996b),
    and involved two related disciplines: irrigation engineering and agronomy. This
    paper aims at discussing those questions and, particularly, some approaches which
    could contribute to the achievement of higher irrigation performances when combined
    improvements on irrigation methods and irrigation scheduling are considered. 2.
    Irrigation performances 2.1. Uniformity Several parameters are used as indicators
    of the uniformity of water application to a field. Most commonly used (Heermann
    et al., 1990) are given below. 2.1.1. Distribution uniformity The distribution
    uniformity, DU (%), defined by the ratio (1) where Zlq is the average infiltrated
    depth in the low quarter of the field (mm), and Zav the average infiltrated depth
    in the entire field (mm). The infiltrated depths are replaced by the observed
    applied depths in sprinkler irrigation, and by the observed emitter discharges
    in trickle irrigation. Distribution uniformity is often named emission uniformity
    in trickle irrigation. Some authors prefer to replace the low quarter averages
    in the numerator by the minimum observed depth. This indicator then becomes the
    absolute distribution uniformity (DUabs). 2.1.2. Coefficient of uniformity The
    coefficient of uniformity, CU (%), introduced by Christiansen (1942)and, defined
    as (2) where X are the absolute deviations of application depths observations
    from the mean (mm), m is the mean of observed depths (mm), and n is the number
    of observations. This indicator is more often utilized in sprinkler irrigation.
    When it concerns surface irrigation, then the application depths are replaced
    by infiltrated depths and, in trickle irrigation, by the observed emitter discharges.
    The approximated relationship between DU and CU is (Keller and Bliesner, 1990)
    (3) or (4) The parameter CU relates with the standard deviation (SD) and the mean
    (m) of the individual observations (Hart and Reynolds, 1965) by (5) which can
    be rearranged to give (6) Hart and Reynolds (1965)adopted a normal distribution
    of applied depths over a field, with mean m and standard deviation SD (Eq. (6)),
    to design the average depth D (mm) to be applied in sprinkler irrigation when
    a pa percentage of the field should be adequately irrigated. More recently, Keller
    and Bliesner (1990)assumed a similar but more evoluted design strategy, relating
    uniformity with efficiency, as analysed further under sub-heading 3.2.2. With
    the same objective, several distribution functions are analysed by Seginer (1987).
    A uniform distribution was adopted by Mantovani et al. (1995)to derive yield-water
    relations as influenced by uniformity of water application and water prices. A
    normal distribution was utilized by de Juan et al. (1996)and Tarjuelo et al. (1996)to
    optimize irrigation strategies under sprinkler irrigation. However, these approaches
    utilize a different concept, based on the deficit coefficient (Cd) developed by
    Losada et al. (1990). 2.1.3. Statistical uniformity coefficient The statistical
    uniformity coefficient, Us (%), defined as (7) where Vq is the coefficient of
    variation of emitter flow, Sq is the SD of emitter flow (1 h−1) and qa is the
    average emitter flow rate (1 h−1). Bralts et al. (1987)adopted Us for design and
    defined Vq from the geometric mean of the coefficients of variation relative to
    emitters clogging, manufacturing variation and pressure variation. 2.2. Efficiency
    The concept of efficiency is not well established despite it is utilized worldwide.
    Reviews on various efficiency terms are provided by Heermann et al. (1990), Wolters
    (1992)and Bos et al. (1994). The classical definition of irrigation efficiency
    proposed by Israelsen (1932)is the ratio between the irrigation water consumed
    by the crops of an irrigated farm or project during crop growth and the water
    diverted from a river or other natural source into farms or project canals during
    the same time. Jensen (1996)considers that term `efficiency'' inappropriate and
    cause of misinterpretation, and proposes to rename the above term as a consumptive
    use coefficient. This allows a better understanding of the terms water consumption
    – which includes evaporation, transpiration or embodiment in a product – and water
    use, which involves both consumptive and nonconsumptive components. Along these
    lines are the `fraction'' indicators recently proposed by Allen et al. (1997).
    Jensen (1996)proposes that the term efficiency be restricted to output/input ratios
    of the same nature, like the ration diverted/delivered water volumes or applied/infiltrated
    water depths. In both cases it is possible to identify which is the non-consumed
    fraction that can be recovered or reused for agriculture or other purposes. The
    combination of the terms water use and efficiency should be restricted to the
    term water use efficiency (WUE), which represents the ratio between a water output
    and the corresponding water input (Steduto, 1996). The review by this author clearly
    distinguishes the photosynthetic WUE, the biomass WUE and the yield WUE. These
    concepts apply to a plant or a crop and are not specifically related to irrigation.
    Considering what said above, the efficiency terms utilized in on-farm irrigation
    are the following: 2.2.1. Application efficiency The application efficiency, ea
    (%), defined as (8) where Zr is the average depth of water added to the root zone
    storage (mm) and D is the average depth of water applied to the field (mm). Zr
    must be limited to Zr ≤ SWD everywhere in the field, SWD being the soil water
    deficit (mm) in the root zone at time of irrigation. When this condition is respected
    ea reflects the impacts of overirrigation. This indicator takes into consideration
    the tailwater runoff and deep percolation. These nonconsumptive components are
    particularly important in surface irrigation, where two other indicators can be
    used (Walker and Skogerboe, 1987): the deep percolation ratio (DPR) between the
    volume of water percolated below the root zone and the volume of water applied
    to the field, and the tailwater runoff ratio (TWR) between the volume of surface
    runoff and the volume of water applied to the field. 2.2.2. Application efficiency
    of low quarter The application efficiency of low quarter, AELQ (%), defined by
    Merriam and Keller (1978)as (9) where Zr,lq is the average low quarter depth of
    water added to root zone storage (mm) and D is the average depth of water applied
    (mm). As for ea, the condition Zr,lq ≤ SWD is also applied. The fact that Zr in
    Eq. (8)is replaced by Zr,lq allows to take into consideration the non uniformity
    of water application when underirrigation is practised. Both ea and AELQ are utilized
    for surface, sprinkler and trickle irrigation. 2.2.3. Potential efficiency of
    the low quarter The potential efficiency of the low quarter, PELQ (%), which can
    be used for design and corresponds to the system performance under good management,
    when the desired depth and timing are applied (Merriam and Keller, 1978). The
    PELQ can be given by (10) where Zlq,MAD is the average low quarter depth infiltrated
    (mm) when equal to MAD, DMAD is the average depth of water applied (mm) when SWD
    = MAD, and MAD is the management allowed deficit (mm). MAD may be selected according
    the crop and the environmental conditions (Martin et al., 1990), or adopting more
    sophisticated approaches including optimization models (de Juan et al., 1996;
    Tarjuelo et al., 1996). 3. Relating irrigation scheduling with the irrigation
    methods 3.1. Surface irrigation 3.1.1. Surface irrigation systems Surface irrigation
    is the most common irrigation method worldwide. There are several types of surface
    systems: basin, furrow, border, contour ditches and water spreading. The latter
    two are primarily used to irrigate pasture lands and have little interest. This
    analysis concerns basin, furrow and border irrigation systems. 3.1.1.1. Basin
    irrigation Water is applied to levelled surface units (basins) which have complete
    perimeter dikes to prevent runoff and to allow infiltration after cutoff. The
    best performance is obtained when advance time is minimised by using large non-erosive
    discharges and the basin surface is precision levelled. This method is the most
    commonly practised worldwide, both for rice and other field crops including orchard
    tree crops. In general, basins are small and uneven and water application is manually
    controlled. Level-basin irrigation using large laser-levelled units with automated
    or semi-automatic control is practised in few areas in developed countries. 3.1.1.2.
    Furrow irrigation Water is applied to furrows using small discharges to favour
    water infiltration while advancing down the field. Fields must have a mild slope
    and inflow discharges must be such that advance is not too fast and produce excessive
    runoff losses, nor too slow to induce excessive infiltration in the upper part
    of the field. Short blocked furrows with manually controlled water applications
    are practised by traditional irrigators. Long and precisely levelled furrows with
    automated or semi-automated control have become increasingly popular in developed
    countries. 3.1.1.3. Border irrigation Water is applied to short or long strips
    of land diked on both sides and open at the downstream end. Irrigation takes place
    by allowing the flow to advance and infiltrate along the border. Smaller inflow
    discharges and longer time duration of application are utilized in graded fields
    to reduce downstream losses, like for furrow irrigation. Larger inflow rates are
    utilised when the field slope is very small with management becoming similar to
    that of basins. Likewise basin irrigation, automated water control is often applied.
    Two types of systems can be considered under the perspective of irrigation scheduling
    practices: 3.1.1.4. Traditional systems The water control is carried out manually
    according to the ability of the irrigator. In small basins or borders and in short
    furrows, a common practice is that in which the irrigator cuts off the supply
    when the advance is completed. Because the fields are often uneven and the discharges
    are variable and largely unknown, this practice induces large variations in the
    volumes of water applied in each irrigation. It is, therefore, extremely difficult
    to control `how much'' water is applied and overirrigation often occurs. 3.1.1.5.
    Modernised systems In these systems some form of control of discharge such as
    siphons, gated pipes, lay-flat tubes or gates and/or some form of automation including
    surge flow valves, cablegation or automated canal gates is used. The fields are
    often precision levelled, while the advance and supply times and the inflow rate
    can be measured or estimated. Thus, in these systems it is possible to control
    `how much'' water should be applied at a given irrigation. 3.1.2. Issues on irrigation
    performances The distribution uniformity (Eq. (1)) is the result of several designs
    and management variables that characterise a surface irrigation event. Functionally,
    it can be described as: (11) where qin is the inflow rate to the furrow or per
    unit width of the border or basin, L is the length of the furrow, border, or basin,
    n is the roughness coefficient, So is the longitudinal slope of the field, Ic
    represents the intake characteristics of the soil, Fa represents the furrow, border,
    or basin sectional form, and tco is the time of cut-off. The application efficiency
    (Eq. (8)or Eq. (9)) also depends on several design and management variables, and
    these can be expressed functionally as follows: (12) where SWD is the soil water
    deficit at time of irrigation. All other variables as defined above. These functions
    show that the application efficiency is a function of both the distribution uniformity
    and the irrigation scheduling. The latter controls the value of the soil water
    deficit at the time of irrigation, SWD. During the last decades, research provided
    many advances in technology and management aiming at modernizing surface irrigation
    as recently reviewed (Pereira, 1996a). Advances include land levelling, equipment
    for water supply and automation, and soil management (Sousa et al., 1995; Humpherys,
    1997; Trout et al., 1990). However, these improvements mostly help to control
    the variables which determine DU (Eq. (11)). Improving ea (Eq. (12)) requires
    the appropriate irrigation scheduling techniques be also applied. Field evaluations
    play a fundamental role in improving surface irrigation systems. They provide
    the information required for design, model validation, and mainly for advising
    irrigators on how to improve their systems and management practices. Field observations
    required for conducting a system evaluation include: • Inflow and outflow volumes,
    • irrigation times/phases, particularly advance and recession, • soil moisture
    before and after irrigation, • the slope/topography of the field being irrigated,
    and • the management rules currently utilised by the irrigator. To estimate the
    infiltrated depths required for computing the uniformity and efficiency indicators,
    field data from evaluation can be utilised to derive the infiltration parameters
    for a Kostiakov type infiltration model (Walker and Skogerboe, 1987). The estimation
    of the infiltration parameters and the roughness coefficient n from field data
    has also been achieved through the solution of the inverse surface irrigation
    problem (Katapodes et al., 1990). Using field data on advance, recession, inflow
    rates, field length and slope, the infiltration and roughness parameters are calculated
    iteratively by coupling a hydraulic model and optimisation procedures (Malano
    et al., 1996). 3.1.3. Field implementation of irrigation scheduling Most of surface
    irrigated areas are supplied from collective irrigation canal systems. Farm irrigation
    scheduling depends upon the delivery schedule, e.g., rate, duration and frequency,
    which are dictated by the system operational policies. Discharge and duration
    impose constraints to the volume of application, and frequency determines the
    timing of irrigation. In general, surface irrigation delivery systems are rigid
    and often the time interval between successive deliveries is too long. Irrigators
    tend to compensate for this by applying all the water they are entitled to use.
    For deep-rooted crops and soils without excessive permeability this strategy can
    be appropriate; however, for shallow-rooted crops and/or soils with small water
    holding capacity, percolation losses can be substantial and crops may become highly
    stressed by waterlogging. Under rigid delivery schedules it is extremely difficult,
    both to modernize the irrigation methods and to implement irrigation scheduling
    programs. In the case of modernised surface systems, the adoption of improved
    irrigation scheduling methods should go, and it often goes together with the improved
    operation of the delivery system to allow more flexibility in selecting the appropriate
    inflow rates and supply time (Goussard, 1996). Substantial improvement can be
    achieved if delivery is made by an arranged delivery schedule, which normally
    requires a certain notice time between the demand of water by the farmer and the
    time of supply. This can be achieved more easily when users are in control of
    the distribution. Farm surface irrigation systems that rely on large irrigation
    depths and large irrigation intervals have enough flexibility to accommodate a
    demand lag time of 2 or 3 days without inducing severe water stress for most crops.
    This could favour the adoption of arranged delivery schedules. In general, it
    is difficult to apply small irrigation depths by surface irrigation. Smaller depths
    may be applied in basin irrigation provided that the land is precision levelled
    and the discharge rate is sufficiently large to obtain a very fast advance. In
    furrow irrigation, this may be also difficult because the time of cutoff is often
    larger than the advance to provide for sufficient intake opportunity time. This
    implies that surface irrigation applications are usually large, which makes this
    method more suitable for situations where the SWD and the MAD are relatively large.
    Under these circumstances scheduling can be simplified when adopting simple irrigation
    calendars (Hill and Allen, 1996), These are also advantageous for collective system
    management and for introducing improved tools for controlling the discharge rates
    at farm level. However, it is desirable that volumes delivered be known: irrigators
    should have control on the discharge rate and duration. An example of development
    of irrigation scheduling calendars for basin irrigation with identification of
    constraints imposed by the irrigation method is presented by Liu et al. (1997).
    Another irrigation scheduling option is provided by the use of irrigation scheduling
    simulation models to perform the soil water balance using soil, crop and meteorological
    data, and providing information on the soil moisture status. Numerous examples
    of such models are available in the literature, namely through the ICID Workshops
    (Pereira et al., 1992, Pereira et al., 1995). However, the use of models in real
    time require not only validation but a support advisory service and training of
    irrigation extensionists, managers and/or farmers (Smith et al., 1996). The use
    of soil water monitoring devices generally is more appropriate for large fields
    and crops that may economically justify the costs of purchase and operation. Normally,
    the use of these techniques requires the selection of an irrigation threshold
    corresponding to the MAD. Observations of the SWD have to be regularly performed
    in time and space to allow the prediction of the irrigation date, when SWD = MAD.
    A further degree of sophistication can be achieved by combining soil water balance
    simulation with soil moisture observations. This can be done in two ways: (a)
    soil moisture information is used to validate the model predictions, and (b) continuous
    soil moisture and meteorological monitoring are coupled in a model for forward
    prediction of the soil water status. An example of the latter approach is presented
    by Malano et al., 1996. 3.2. Sprinkler irrigation 3.2.1. Sprinkler irrigation
    systems Sprinkler irrigation systems are normally used under more favourable operational
    conditions than surface systems because farmers may control the discharge rates,
    duration and frequency. Many sprinkler systems have independent water supply or
    are connected to networks which may be operated on demand. However, the pressure
    from the hydrants or farm pumps is often not appropriate resulting in lower (or
    higher) discharges than those envisaged during the design phase. Pressure head
    (and discharge) variations at the hydrant should be identified by the user when
    appropriate equipment is available. Different types of sprinkler systems can be
    considered in relation to irrigation scheduling: • Solid set systems. Sprinklers
    irrigate in a fixed position. There are no limitations in the duration of the
    set time. Thus, they can be utilised to apply small depths and frequent watering
    (not suitable for the movable systems because of operational constraints) or large
    depths and large irrigation intervals (less appropriate when very low application
    rates are required). • Travelling guns, hose-reel or hose-pull. These systems
    apply irrigation depths ranging from 15 to 40 mm. They are not suitable for applying
    very small or large depths mainly because of limitations in their system and capacity.
    • Continuous move laterals. These systems are well adapted to apply small and
    frequent irrigations . The hydraulic design of sprinkler irrigation is generally
    well understood. The overall sprinkler design process is however complicated since
    it requires the best combination of the following (see Keller and Bliesner, 1990):
    • system layout and application rate (is) according to soil infiltration and climate
    characteristics; • pressure (P), nozzle diameter (dn), sprinklers discharge (qs)
    and wetted diameter (Dw); • spacings between sprinklers and/or laterals, or towpaths
    of travelling guns, which relate to the application rate and wind conditions;
    • sprinkler characteristics, including the coarseness of drops and the water distribution
    pattern, in relation to soil and climate conditions. The most common design criteria
    for sprinkler laterals is that sprinkler discharge (qs) should not vary by more
    than 10% between the points of highest and lowest pressure in the system. However,
    this condition is often not achieved in practice. Dubalen (1993)reports that in
    France, 56% of solid set systems evaluated showed a pressure variation higher
    than 20%. Consequences of pressure and discharge variations in a pressurized irrigation
    system operating at demand can be dramatic, during peak demand periods with the
    pressure dropping to unacceptable values (Lamaddalena, 1997). Under these circumstances,
    depths applied decrease drastically when the duration of the irrigation is not
    adjusted (Tizaoui et al., 1997). In the case of direct supply by a farm pumping
    system, the pressure can also be lower (or higher) than expected due to design
    shortcomings or lack of maintenance. When appropriate measurement devices are
    installed, these problems can be identified and either the set time or the travelling
    speed can be corrected according to the actual discharge. Many sprinkler systems
    have not been properly designed, not being operated according to design rules,
    or their operation is hampered by poor maintenance. This results in inadequate
    pressures and discharges along the system. Unfortunately, these problems are frequent.
    In France, as reported by Dubalen (1993), the actual application depths deviate
    by more than 20% from the designed ones in 46% of travelling guns and 34% for
    solid set systems. This indicates that the main limitation to irrigation scheduling
    is that most farmers do not know the discharges delivered by their systems and
    are only in control of the duration. In many cases they may be only in control
    of the frequency of irrigations. 3.2.2. Issues on irrigation performances The
    distribution uniformity DU (Eq. (1)) is determined by several design variables
    and can be functionally expressed by the following relation: (13) where P is the
    pressure available at the sprinkler, ΔP is the variation of the pressure in the
    operating set or along the moving lateral, S represents the spacings of the sprinklers
    along the lateral (and between laterals) or the spacings between travellers, dn
    is the nozzle diameter, which influences the discharge qs and wetted diameter
    Dw (and the coarseness of water drops) for a given P, WDP represents the water
    distribution pattern of the sprinkler, and WS represents wind speed and direction.
    All the above variables are set at the design stage (including a forecasted WS).
    However, less appropriate spacings often occur in practice: excessive spacing
    occurs in 65% of travelling guns and 70% of solid set systems evaluated in France
    (Dubalen, 1993). Spacings greatly influence DU. The application efficiency ea
    (Eq. (8)or Eq. (9)) depends not only on the design but on management variables
    and can be functionally described by: (14) where besides variables defined above,
    Ic represents the intake characteristics of the soil, is is the application rate
    of the sprinkler, ti is the duration of the irrigation event, and SWD is the soil
    water deficit before the irrigation event. Most of the parameters in Eq. (14)are
    controlled by the designer. However, the pressure P depends on the functioning
    of the pressurized supply system. The duration of the application, ti, and SWD
    are management variables controlled by the irrigator. Hence, likewise surface
    irrigation, the application efficiency depends upon the application uniformity
    and the irrigation scheduling. Keller and Bliesner (1990), following Hart and
    Reynolds (1965), propose an interesting methodology relating uniformity and efficiency
    to decide the depth of water to be applied. They define the distribution efficiency
    DEpa (%), for the target percentage, pa, of field area adequately irrigated: (15)
    where pa is the percentage of the field area receiving a net irrigation depth
    not lower than the target depth, and CU is the coefficient of uniformity (Eq.
    (2)) (%). CU may be computed from actual observations in the field or from simulating
    the overlap of sprinkler water distribution patterns at the design phase (Tizaoui
    et al., 1997). DEpa allows the calculation of the design application efficiency,
    Epa (%), for the same percentage pa of the area adequately irrigated, given by
    (16) where Re is the effective portion (0.1–1.0) of water applied, i.e., after
    estimating the losses by evaporation and wind drift (computed from the reference
    evapotranspiration, windspeed and coarseness of water drops), and Oe is the effective
    portion (0.9–1.0) of water discharged, i.e., after estimating the losses by leakage
    (see Keller and Bliesner, 1990). The gross application depth D (mm) is then calculated
    from the net depth Dn (mm) required to satisfy the crop demand and the efficiency
    Epa (17) This procedure is very useful to adjust the application depths to the
    characteristics of the system and, at the design phase, it provides for more realistic
    approaches by anticipating the performances which are likely to occur in practice.
    3.2.3. Field implementation of irrigation scheduling Overall, in sprinkle irrigation
    the task of the irrigator to manage the system is made easier than in surface
    irrigation but performance is largely dependent on the system design. Therefore,
    quality control of design, equipment and services are very important in supporting
    farmers operations. For set systems and travelling guns, the MAD is commonly smaller
    than for surface irrigation. The methods for irrigation scheduling that can be
    used are the same as for surface irrigation: (a) water balance simulation models,
    (b) monitoring the soil water status and (c) a combination of both. The observation
    of the SWD requires more accuracy when irrigation depths are small and the frequency
    of irrigations is higher. In areas with a large number of small farmers, the use
    of simple irrigation scheduling calendars may be more appropriate. The successful
    use of a simulation model through a videotel system for advising farmers within
    a large irrigation project has been recently reported by Giannerini (1995). Other
    approaches are discussed in Smith et al. (1996). When frequent irrigations are
    applied, the error in estimating the SWD may be too large relative to depths to
    be applied. This is the case for daily irrigations with centre pivot laterals.
    Thus, other scheduling strategies based on the replacement of the volume of water
    consumed during the precedent irrigation interval must be applied. For centre
    pivots, special irrigation scheduling models have been developed, which often
    associate modules for water application, fertigation, chemigation and energy management.
    An illustration is model SCHED (Buchleiter, 1995). 3.3. Microirrigation irrigation
    3.3.1. Microirrigation systems Microirrigation systems are set systems that use
    a variety of low discharge emitters to apply water to the field. Systems for tree
    crops have several emitters per tree, depending on the wetted area, hydraulic
    properties of the soil, emitters discharge and emitters wetting pattern, which
    varies with the type of emitter. There are several types of emitters: drippers,
    microsprayers, spinners and bublers. For row crops, a lateral supplies water for
    each one or two crop rows when drippers are utilised. Underground perforated pipes
    have also become popular. For tree crops, microsprayers are mostly utilized. Emitters
    discharge, qe (1 h−1), relates to the pressure P (kPa) through the following relation:
    (18) where x is the characteristic exponent of the emitter, and K is the discharge
    coefficient of the emitter. The parameter x varies from near x = 0, for self compensating
    emitters, upto x = 1 for laminar flow emitters. Most commonly x values vary from
    0.4 to 0.55. Self compensating emitters are used to minimise discharge variations
    along very long laterals or in sloping fields. The design of microirrigation systems
    involves the appropriate combination of: • pressure P, discharge qe, and emitter
    characteristic exponent x; • percent area wetted; • emitter type and spacings;
    • emitter susceptibility to clogging, ability to cleaning and to compensate variations
    in temperature; • type of filters, their location and cleaning capability; • equipments
    for application of fertilisers and chemicals, • control of pressure and/or flow,
    and location of respective devices in the system, • automation facilities. To
    achieve this, the designer must know the irrigation requirement of the crop duration
    and frequency of irrigations (including fertigation/chemigation requirements).
    Hence, design and irrigation scheduling processes are intertwined. Performance
    is highly dependent on the quality of design and equipment selected. 3.3.2. Issues
    on irrigation performances The distribution uniformity, DU (Eq. (1)), is determined
    by a combination of design parameters which can be functionally expressed as follows:
    (19) where P is the pressure at emitters, ΔP is the variation in pressure along
    the system, x is the characteristic exponent of the emitter, Ec represents emitter
    characteristics related to variations in discharge, Cv is the coefficient of manufacturing
    variation for the emitter (which is also a function of the number of emitters
    per plant), and FI stand for the filtering capabilities of the system. As for
    sprinkler systems, the irrigator has very little control on the uniformity performance
    of the system except for the standard of maintenance of the system. As with surface
    and sprinkler irrigation systems, the application efficiency, ea (Eq. (8)or Eq.
    (9)), is determined by the combination of design and management variables as indicated
    in the following functional relation: (20) where, besides variables defined above,
    Ks is the hydraulic conductivity of the soil, SW stands for soil water conditions
    before irrigation, ti is the duration of the irrigation, and Δti are the time
    intervals between irrigations. The irrigator''s control is basically reduced to
    the timing of irrigation and the volumes and frequency of applications. Thus,
    to achieve good performance in microirrigation, good support to farmers for quality
    control of equipment, services and design is required. Field evaluations of systems
    under operation can play a fundamental role in improving performance. Field evaluations
    reveal that performances are often below the potential ones (Pitts et al., 1996).
    The most useful performance indicators for microirrigation field evaluations are
    the statistical uniformity coefficient, Us (Eq. (7)), and the distribution uniformity,
    DU (Eq. (1)). For design purposes, also two performance parameters are widely
    used, the emission uniformity and Us. The emission uniformity, EU (%), is defined
    (ASAE, 1997; Keller and Bliesner, 1990) by where Cv is the coefficient of manufacturing
    variation for the emitter, N is the number of emitters per tree (N = 1 for row
    crops), qn is the minimum emission rate (1 h−1) corresponding to the minimum pressure
    in the system, and qa is the average (or design) emission rate (1 h−1). The EU
    allows to anticipate the potential uniformity of the system, and to compute the
    seasonal irrigation efficiency, Es (%) (Keller and Bliesner, 1990), defined as
    (22) where Tr is the seasonal transmission ratio (1.0–1.35) representing the extrawater
    applied to offset the unavoidable deep percolation on a seasonal basis, and LR
    is the leaching requirement fraction (0.0–0.3). At its limit, Es equals EU. The
    parameters Es is an appropriate estimate of AELQ (Eq. (9)) at the design stage.
    3.3.3. Field implementation of irrigation scheduling Farmers adopting microirrigation
    systems are in control of flow rate, duration and frequency of irrigations. However,
    likewise sprinkler systems, they may not be aware of the discharge when pressure
    variations occur in the supply system (Lamaddalena, 1997). Problems also arise
    when systems are not properly designed. These problems can be lessen when self
    compensating emitters are utilised. Most of the problems derive from inappropriate
    design and selection of equipment. These unfavourable conditions are often related
    to the fact that farmers are induced to adopt microirrigation systems to save
    water, without appropriate technical support, Microirrigation systems may use
    less water when application losses are minimized, but they should not be designed
    or managed for saving water. They should be managed to supply the water as required
    by the crops with high frequency. Trickle irrigation systems are normally used
    for frequent or very frequent applications, daily or twice a week. Under intensive
    horticultural production, more than one application per day may be necessary.
    Larger irrigation intervals of few days are appropriate for deep-rooted orchard
    trees and vines. Irrigation scheduling can be based on crop indicators or soil
    water status. Videotel or Irritel systems, as well as other forms of water balance
    models are also appropriate (Smith et al., 1996). For very frequent waterings,
    the irrigation, and fertigation strategies must be integrated, and are commonly
    based on the daily crop requirements. 4. Conclusions Two main performance criteria
    are considered, one relative to uniformity of water distribution in the irrigated
    field, the second concerning the water application efficiency. Several indicators
    can be used for both. Its selection mainly depends on the objectives for their
    use. The usefulness of such parameters could be improved when they would be applied
    either to support farmers advices, either for irrigation systems design. Uniformity
    indicators can be utilized to better decide on irrigation depths to be applied,
    namely in relation to the percentage area of the irrigated field which should
    receive a target depth. However, for surface irrigation further developments are
    required. Progress is expected by using uniformity indicators in relation to yield
    and to economic factors which allow to optimize water allocation and the definition
    of irrigation strategies. The relationships between uniformity and efficiency
    may lead to further practical applications. The use of appropriate simulation
    models may also play an important role to select the irrigation practices which
    lead to improved performances. For sprinkler and trickle irrigation, it has been
    shown that design efficiencies can be computed from uniformity indicators. Adopting
    this approach in the design practice could lead to improved design, more appropriately
    oriented for management of on-farm systems. The importance of the quality of design
    and, thus, of quality control of design should be stressed. Field evaluations
    should expand and be used as a common practice to support improvements of on-farm
    irrigation management by farmers. Their results should also be used to improve
    systems design and to help the quality control of equipments and services. Efforts
    from irrigation engineers to improve the irrigation systems are often hampered
    by the irrigation scheduling practices being applied. These definitely influence
    the application efficiency. Efforts to adopt better irrigation scheduling practices
    often find serious limitations due either to the delivery scheduling being applied,
    either to the practical limits to apply the desirable irrigation depth in the
    field practice. Under these circumstances, it is advisable that research (and
    extension) adopt a coupled approach to the water application practice and the
    irrigation scheduling decisions. Engineering and agronomic competences must be
    combined. References Allen et al., 1997 Allen, R.G., Willardson, L.S., Frederiksen,

    Recently, supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA) systems have become
    widely used in agricultural applications, particularly in conjunction with irrigation
    management systems that require calculated applications of water. The objective
    of this study is to present a new SCADA platform for the regulated deficit irrigation
    management of almond trees. This new platform implements a wireless architecture
    that ensures error-free communication among the irrigation system components with
    no need to maintain cables. The implemented SCADA application performs the following
    irrigation-related tasks: (1) based on the edaphoclimatic data from the parcel
    to be treated, an estimation of the crop water requirements, including the values
    required for drip irrigation scheduling, is computed; and (2) using the calculations
    from the previous step, the different components of the irrigation system, such
    as the electrovalves, pump system, variable frequency drive, and pressure alarms
    are placed under either automatic control or the control of manual activating
    actuators. The proposed platform was installed in a parcel of almond trees located
    at Fuente Alamo de Murcia, Spain, with half of the parcel configured with regulated
    deficit irrigation and the other half configured with conventional irrigation.
    The results demonstrate the benefits of using this new platform, as well as a
    method for reducing water consumption through the use of regulated deficit irrigation.
    Introduction In the arid and semiarid regions of southeastern Spain, the low availability
    of water for irrigation makes the development of new water-conserving irrigation
    techniques necessary (Pereira et al. 2002; Prasad et al. 2006; Smout and Gorantiwar
    2006; Martinez et al. 2011; Corcoles et al. 2012). In Mediterranean regions, a
    portion of almond orchards are located in dry areas because these trees can withstand
    water stress (Romero et al. 2004, 2006; Girona et al. 2005; Goldhamer et al. 2006;
    Nortes et al. 2009), salinity (Franco et al. 2000), and other adverse conditions.
    The adoption of new irrigation techniques in these areas (Stambouli et al. 2012),
    such as regulated deficit irrigation (RDI), allows for the reduction of water
    consumption for similar production volumes (Capra et al. 2008; Kirnak et al. 2009;
    Marsal et al. 2008; Samani et al. 2005). Regulated deficit irrigation strategies
    are based on the reduction of irrigation during certain periods of the annual
    plant cycle (Ruiz-Sanchez et al. 2010). These selected periods occur when ongoing
    growth processes are less sensitive to water stress and when effects derived from
    water stress are advantageous for yield, such as for reducing vigor in high-density
    orchards (Jensen et al. 2010). Because intensification is not an issue in almond
    orchards, a successful design for deficit irrigation scheduling may reduce water
    consumption without affecting the yield (Egea et al. 2009; Stewart et al. 2011).
    During the last three decades, supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA)
    systems have been used as a valid solution for resolving specific issues in different
    technical and scientific fields, such as chemical or physical process monitoring,
    transportation monitoring for water supply systems, production management, quality
    control, and maintenance and control of industrial processes. Moreover, these
    systems have also been used in the agriculture sector to monitor weather conditions,
    fertirrigation, and irrigation in greenhouses (van Meurs et al. 1996). Supervisory
    control and data acquisition systems have also been used with success for monitoring
    and controlling the flow of irrigation canals (Rijo and Arranja 2010), controlling
    pumping systems (Dobriceanu et al. 2008), drainage and water quality control (Yin
    and Yong 2009), and global irrigation (Gensler et al. 2009). However, SCADA systems
    have not been used for regulated deficit irrigation scheduling in almond trees.
    In the agricultural sector, supervisory control and data acquisition systems usually
    monitor sensors that are far from the base station; therefore, a direct cable
    connection is not feasible. To address this issue, wireless sensor networks (WSNs)
    are used instead (Hedley and Yule 2009; Wang et al. 2006). Of the diverse types
    of wireless technologies currently available, the wireless local area network
    (WLAN), Bluetooth, ZigBee, and global system for mobile communications/global
    packet radio service (GSM/GPRS) are the most popular in the agriculture and food
    industry sectors. Concretely, ZigBee is an open and global standard for WSN with
    a low rate, low cost, low power consumption, and self-forming wireless communication,
    which makes it ideal for the development of applications focused on sensor and
    automatic control. Several applications using ZigBee technology can be found in
    the literature, such as soil moisture monitoring (Morais et al. 2008; Sulaiman
    et al. 2009), microclimate real-time monitoring (Watthanawisuth et al. 2009),
    temperature monitoring in all phases of wine production (Boquete et al. 2010),
    and soil water monitoring for decision making in a sprinkler irrigation system
    (Kim et al. 2009). The objective of this paper is to present a new SCADA platform
    for regulated deficit irrigation management with ZigBee architecture for wireless
    communication among components. The developed platform was installed in a parcel
    of almond trees in Fuente Álamo de Murcia, Spain. Half of the parcel was configured
    with regulated deficit irrigation and the other half was configured with conventional
    irrigation. This setup was used to demonstrate that water consumption was improved
    using regulated deficit irrigation and that this type of system is useful for
    irrigation management tasks. This system may also be extended to all types of
    cultivation. Description of the Platform The SCADA platform has been used in a
    parcel of almond trees (Amygdalus communis L. cv. Antonietta) located in southeastern
    Spain, in the municipality of Fuente Álamo, in Murcia (latitude 37°47′33″N, longitude
    1°14′27″W, and altitude 125 m). The parcel, which is divided into one sector with
    277 almond trees and another sector with 280 almond trees, is over a surface area
    of 2.3 ha that is divided into 6 × 7 - m crop grids. The parcel has drip irrigation
    laterals of 16 mm and four emitters of 8 L · ha − 1 per tree. The irrigation system
    contains two primary parts, which are approximately 1 km apart: (1) a pump and
    control station; and (2) an irrigation head (Fig. 1). Fig. 1. Architecture of
    the irrigation system The pump and control station contains the following components:
    (1) a pump system with a variable speed drive, which is responsible for the water
    supply to the irrigation head and is controlled by the SCADA application; (2)
    a data acquisition card that translates the signals between the components of
    the irrigation system and the computer; (3) a computer running the SCADA application;
    and (4) an XBee-PRO module with a high-gain antenna for wireless communication
    with the irrigation head, for distances up to 1.6 km. For the irrigation head,
    the following elements are present: (1) three electrovalve actuators controlled
    by the SCADA application from the control station, with two electrovalves irrigating
    both sectors and one electrovalve for the fertirrigation system; (2) a pressure
    alarm control, which warns the pump and control station when overpressure or underpressure
    occurs; (3) photovoltaic panels with a battery to provide power to the irrigation
    head; and (4) an additional XBee-PRO module with a high-gain antenna for wireless
    communication with the pump and control station. Because of the distance between
    the control station and the irrigation head, the use of a direct cable connection
    was initially dismissed. A wireless communication architecture using the ZigBee
    standard was chosen instead because it has been proved with success in the agricultural
    sector (Ruiz-Garcia et al. 2009). For the existing platform, two XBee-PRO 802.15.4
    modules from Digi International Inc. (Minnetonka, Minnesota) were selected to
    create a virtual cable using the “I/O Line Passing” feature of these devices.
    This configuration permits the setup of virtual wires between the XBee-PRO modules,
    establishing a pin-to-pin virtual connection (Caprile 2009; Ponraj and Daniel
    2012). Because these modules work with 3.3 V, the following two signal conditioning
    circuits were also developed: (1) one circuit for adapting the signals between
    the data acquisition card and the XBee-PRO module in the control station [Fig.
    2(a)]; and (2) another circuit for activating the electrovalve relays based on
    the signals provided by the XBee-PRO module in the irrigation head, as well as
    supplying this XBee-PRO module with the alarm monitoring signals [Fig. 2(b)].
    Fig. 2. Signal conditioning circuits: (a) pump and control station; (b) irrigation
    head The next section introduces the software application, which is the core of
    the SCADA platform. Software Application For implementation of the SCADA application,
    the LabVIEW graphical programming language from National Instruments has been
    used because it offers a powerful, natural, and intuitive engineering environment
    for designers developing hardware-software systems for measurement, test, and
    control tasks (Larsen 2010). The proposed SCADA application has been developed
    to perform the following irrigation-related tasks: (1) estimate the crop water
    requirements and the values for drip irrigation scheduling based on the edaphoclimatic
    data from the parcel to be treated; and (2) using the values obtained from the
    previous stage, perform the automatic control of the different components of the
    irrigation system, including the electrovalves, pump system, variable speed drive,
    and pressure alarms. To differentiate between the two tasks, the application contains
    the following two well-differentiated interfaces (Fig. 3): (1) a configuration
    interface where all the necessary values are introduced and the calculations are
    performed; and (2) a control interface where the user can control the irrigation
    process and the different elements of the system are monitored. Fig. 3. Configuration
    interface Configuration Interface When the SCADA application is first executed,
    the configuration of several parameters is required, although it is possible to
    change them at a later time. For this procedure, the application has a configuration
    tab (Fig. 3) where several edaphoclimatic parameters can be introduced. Based
    on this, the application calculates the variables that will be used to estimate
    the values necessary for drip irrigation scheduling, according to the mathematical
    model described in Fig. 4. Hereafter, a more detailed description of the calculation
    is provided. Fig. 4. Mathematical model for regulated deficit irrigation scheduling
    Calculation of Crop Evapotranspiration under Drip Irrigation According to the
    Food and Agricultural Organization of the United Nations (FAO) methodology (Doorenbos
    and Pruitt 1977; Allen et al. 1998), the evapotranspiration of a determined crop
    ( ET C ) is directly related to the reference evapotranspiration ( ET O ) by a
    crop coefficient ( K C ), which reflects the effects of the plant properties to
    the water requirements. In turn, this crop evapotranspiration parameter ( ET C
    ) can also be affected by local conditions, the effects of which are considered
    using a weather variation coefficient ( K V ) (Hernández Abréu et al. 1987) and
    an advection correction factor ( K A ) (Sepaskhah and Andam 2001). Finally, for
    drip irrigation, a shading coefficient ( K S ), which relates crop evapotranspiration
    under conventional irrigation ( ET C ) with crop evapotranspiration under drip
    irrigation ( ET D ), should also be applied, resulting in the following equation
    (ASCE 1996): ET D ( mm · day − 1 ) = ET O · K C · K A · K V · K S (1) The ET O
    value is automatically obtained from the Murcian Agricultural Information Service
    (Spain) website by selecting the agricultural weather station that is closest
    to the area where the SCADA platform is installed (see Fig. 3, top left). Concretely
    in this case, the CA21—Corvera (Murcia) weather station, which is located near
    the analyzed parcel, is equipped with sensors for temperature (PT-1000), relative
    humidity (Humicap 180), global solar radiation (SP1110), net radiation (Q-7.1
    Net Radiometer), wind speed (A100R), and a pluviometer (FDD500). To obtain the
    crop coefficient ( K C ), the values in Table 1 (Muncharaz 2004) were manipulated
    according to established methods. In this study, the K C values for soils without
    vegetal cover and without weeds and with weak and moderate wind speeds (dry air)
    are the most closely related to the area where the almond trees are planted; therefore,
    these values have been initially introduced (Fig. 3, top right). Table 1 shows
    the lack of K C values for December, January, and February. Because almonds retain
    a good percentage of leaves during those months, irrigation with low K C values
    can be performed. K C values of ≈ 0.20 for bare, dry soil or dead ground cover,
    and K C values of 0.50 to 0.80 for actively growing ground cover are usually recommended
    (Allen et al. 1998). Table 1. Crop Coefficients (Kc) for Full-Size Almond Trees

    0.7 For estimation of the advection correction factor ( K A ), which takes the
    parcel size into consideration, the graphic in Fig. 5 can be used (Sepaskhah and
    Andam 2001). For the weather variation coefficient ( K V ), the value recommended
    for semiarid zones is 1.2 (Hernández Abréu et al. 1987). Fig. 5. Correction factor
    for evapotranspiration caused by advection using data outside or before irrigation
    development for different sizes of irrigated areas under arid and moderate wind
    conditions The last value required for calculation of the ET D is the shading
    coefficient ( K S ), which is obtained from Fereres et al. (1982) according to
    the shaded surface percentage (Table 2). According to previous studies (Hutmacher
    et al. 1994), these values provide good results for calculating evapotranspiration
    in almond trees. Because the values of the shadowed surface shown in Table 2 are
    multiples of 10, a second-degree polynomial approximation function [Eq. (2)] has
    been used in the application. Therefore, the user can introduce the desired shaded
    surface percentage ( S S ), and the corresponding K S value is then automatically
    calculated (Fig. 3, top center): K S = − 0.0001 · S S 2 + 0.0214 · S S + 0.0983

    0.49 0.64 0.76 0.87 0.89 1.00 1.00 1.00 1.00 Based on the ET O , K C , K A , K
    V , and K S values, the application internally calculates the crop evapotranspiration
    under drip irrigation ( ET D ) using Eq. (1). Estimation of Net Irrigation Dose
    and Irrigation Interval After the crop evapotranspiration under drip irrigation
    ( ET D ) is calculated, the net irrigation dose ( D N ) is required to estimate
    the irrigation interval that will be used by the SCADA application for irrigation
    scheduling. This parameter represents the maximum amount of water that the soil
    can retain (Pizarro 1996) and is given by the following equation: D N ( mm ) =
    [ ( α 100 ) · θ V AW · Z · ( P 100 ) ] (3) where α (%) = ratio of available stored
    water in the soil; Z (m) = rooting depth; P (%) = percentage of wet soil; and
    θ V AW ( mm · m − 1 ) = available water in the soil. For almond trees, the maximum
    values recommended for the rooting depth ( Z ) are 1.0 to 2.0 m, and 0.40 for
    the percentage of wet soil ( P ) (Allen et al. 1998). To calculate the available
    water in the soil parameter θ V AW (Pizarro 1996; Hoffman et al. 2007), the following
    formula is used: θ V AW ( mm · m − 1 ) = θ V FC − θ V WP (4) In this formula,
    θ V FC ( mm · m − 1 ) = volumetric content of the soil moisture at field capacity;
    and θ V WP ( mm · m − 1 ) = volumetric content of the soil moisture at the wilting
    point. With the net irrigation dose calculated ( D N ), the interval I (days)
    between complete irrigations of the parcel (sector 1 + sector 2) are estimated
    with Eq. (5) (Martín de Santa Olalla et al. 2005), usually at a daily interval.
    However, for soils with coarse texture, the irrigation interval is lower than
    the unit; therefore, several irrigations per day are required. By contrast, if
    water-retentive soils are treated, several days between consecutive irrigations
    are necessary to avoid root asphyxiation. I ( days ) = D N ET D (5) Calculation
    of Gross Irrigation Dose and Irrigation Time To estimate the irrigation time,
    the gross irrigation dose ( D G ) must be calculated. This parameter is obtained
    using the following two equations (Martín de Santa Olalla et al. 2005), and the
    higher value is then selected: D G ( L · tree − 1 ) = ET D · I · C G · RDI AE
    · UC D G ( L · tree − 1 ) = ET D · I · C G · RDI ( 1 − LR ) · UC (6) where ET
    D ( mm · day − 1 ) = crop evapotranspiration under drip irrigation; I (days) =
    irrigation interval; C G ( m 2 · tree − 1 ) = crop grid; AE = application efficiency;
    UC = uniformity coefficient; RDI = regulated deficit irrigation coefficient; and
    LR (Pizarro 1996, Hoffman et al. 2007) = leaching requirement, which is calculated
    with the following equation: LR = EC w 2 · EC e max (7) In this equation, EC W
    ( d S · m − 1 ) = electrical conductivity of the irrigation water; and EC e max
    ( d S · m − 1 ) = maximum electrical conductivity of the saturated soil extract
    at which the plant dies. The values of these parameters for almond crops can be
    obtained from Table 3 (Martín de Santa Olalla et al. 2005). Table 3. Almond Tree

    m − 1 ) EC w (dS m − 1 ) EC e max (dS m − 1 ) 1.5 1.0 2.0 1.4 2.8 1.9 4.1 2.7
    7.0 For the RDI coefficient (Egea et al. 2010), the application provides a table
    in which the percentage of irrigation for each fortnight is introduced by the
    user depending on the phenological period of the tree (see Fig. 3). On the upper-left
    side of this table, the user can use two buttons to select whether the RDI coefficients
    of the table will be applied to each one of the sectors or whether conventional
    irrigation will be used instead ( RDI = 1 ). Depending on this RDI value, the
    irrigation dose ( D G ) and the irrigation time ( T I ) can differ for each sector.
    The irrigation time ( T I ) is obtained with the following formula (Martín de
    Santa Olalla et al. 2005): T I ( hours ) = D G N E · q E (8) where N E = number
    of emitters per tree; and q E ( L · h − 1 ) = flow rate of the emitters. After
    all the parameters have been introduced and the variables have been calculated,
    the configuration tab of the application shows the interval between complete irrigations
    of the parcel (irrigation interval) and the time needed for the irrigation of
    each sector (irrigation times) (Fig. 3, bottom right). Control Interface After
    the application has been configured, the control interface is used to monitor
    the irrigation process and control the elements of the system, which are managed
    automatically by the application according to the calculated scheduling parameters.
    The main window [Fig. 6(a)] shows a map of the irrigation head and the pump and
    control station, and several indicators providing quick information regarding
    the valves states and pressure alarms. At the bottom of the screen, the main parameters
    calculated for irrigation scheduling (irrigation times and interval) are also
    indicated. The application also allows automatic control of the system to be disabled
    to give complete access to the user with a manual button. Fig. 6. Control interface:
    (a) main window (map data: Google Cnes/Spot Image, DigitalGlobe., based on BCN

    When the irrigation head button is pressed in the main screen, a new window showing
    the electrovalve states and pressure alarms appears [Fig. 6(b)]. On this screen,
    the state of the fertilizing valve is also displayed. If the control and pump
    station button is pressed, a window showing the pump system pressure and variable
    speed drive appears and can be configured [Fig. 6(c)]. One advantage of the control
    of the variable speed drive performed by a Modbud/RS-485 protocol is the potential
    to detect problems in the irrigation networks when an increase in revolutions
    is detected by the application. An additional screen that allows for the configuration
    of the fertirrigation process is also provided [Fig. 6(d)]. Results To evaluate
    the SCADA platform and the benefits of applying regulated deficit irrigation scheduling,
    the SCADA platform was installed in a parcel of almond trees at Fuente Álamo de
    Murcia, Spain. Half of the parcel (sector 1) was configured with regulated deficit
    irrigation and the other half was configured (sector 2) with conventional irrigation.
    The RDI coefficient values used for sector 1 can be extracted from Fig. 3. During
    a two-year period, the volume of water used for the irrigation of each sector
    was measured, and the results are shown in Table 4. These results demonstrate
    that application of RDI reduces water consumption and, consequently, provides
    economical savings. Additionally, a nonsignificant reduction in almond harvesting
    was observed compared with water savings. Because of the low availability of water
    resources for irrigation in southeastern Spain, an irrigation treatment of 100%
    ET O is not always possible, and irrigation alternatives are necessary. Table

    the grain-filling phase (May 15–August 15). In addition, if these volumes per
    tree and day are accumulated for each year and the average values of the two years
    are calculated, a more representative graphic of the water savings is obtained
    (see Fig. 8). This demonstrates an approximately 40% reduction in water because
    of RDI. These results demonstrate the benefits of using this type of platform
    and shows that water consumption can be improved using regulated deficit irrigation.

    platform for regulated deficit irrigation management with ZigBee architecture
    that ensures wireless communication between the irrigation system components.
    The proposed platform has the following benefits: 1. The irrigation process is
    automatically managed by the SCADA application, and no human presence is required.
    However, a manual-operating mode is also available for maintenance tasks. 2. The
    SCADA platform can work under both conventional irrigation management and regulated
    deficit irrigation. This is achieved through modification of the RDI coefficients,
    which can be set in the configuration tab. 3. The user can continually monitor
    and control the system remotely using another computer. For this purpose the Remote
    Panels functionality of the LabVIEW software has been implemented. Additionally,
    any other free remote control software, such as virtual network computing (VNC)
    or TeamViewer, can also be used. 4. The irrigation scheduling parameters are continuously
    recalculated by the application because monthly and fortnightly values for the
    K c and RDI coefficients, respectively, have been supplied, and a daily value
    for ET O is automatically obtained from the selected agricultural weather station.
    The acquisition of the ET O parameter directly from the closest station avoids
    the additional cost of installing a new weather station at the parcel because
    the data obtained from the nearest station should be similar. 5. The ZigBee architecture
    provides error-free wireless communication with no need of cable maintenance.
    ZigBee architecture also provides an easily extensible, low-cost, and low-power
    consumption option for future improvements. 6. The platform has a supervision
    feature that allows for the detection of possible failures at the installation.
    Precisely, this functionality allowed the detection of an underpressure condition
    at the pressostat, indicating a failure at the irrigation system. The developed
    platform has been evaluated over a two-year period at an almond orchard at Fuente
    Álamo de Murcia, Spain. Half the parcel was configured with regulated deficit
    irrigation and the other half was configured with conventional irrigation. This
    demonstrated the benefits of this type of platform for irrigation management tasks
    and also showed that water consumption can be improved using regulated deficit
    irrigation. Although this study demonstrates a specific application for almond
    trees, similar systems may be implemented under different field conditions. References

    Authors:   Manuel A Andrade, Susan A O’Shaughnessy, Steven R Evett Keywords:   center
    pivot irrigation, sensors, software, irrigation scheduling. Abstract. Scientists
    with the USDA-ARS Conservation & Production Research Laboratory, Bushland, TX,
    have developed and patented an Irrigation Scheduling Supervisory Control and Data
    Acquisition System (ISSCADAS, patent ser. no. 61/513,767). The ISSCADAS assists
    irrigation management by automating the collection of data from plant sensing
    systems, as well as applying algorithms to process those data. This paper describes
    advances in the development of software, ARSmartPivot (ARSP), for the operation
    of the ISSCADAS. Besides serving as a communication port between users, sensors,
    and center pivots, ARSP includes decision support tools that enhance irrigation
    management. For example, mathematical algorithms were implemented into ARSP‘s
    computational engine to generate recommended prescription maps. In the summer
    of 2014, ARSP was applied to the automatic control of a center pivot equipped
    for Variable Rate Irrigation (VRI). One-half of a six-span center pivot field
    was planted with two corn hybrids (Pioneer ® P0876HR and 33Y75). Irrigation management
    of both hybrids was accomplished using two irrigation scheduling methods: an automatic
    control based on a plant feedback system and a manual control based on the neutron
    probe. Three irrigation levels were applied in the experiment for both types of
    control: 100%, 75%, and 50%. Automatic plots were irrigated if a mean integrated
    crop water stress index (iCWSI) calculated for the automatic 100% plots for each
    hybrid was above a pre-determined threshold (based on well-watered corn in Bushland).
    For the P0876HR hybrid, average corn yields for automatic plots were 1.48 to 1.86
    kg m-2 and 1.35 to 1.72 kg m-2 for manual plots. For the 33Y75 hybrid, average
    corn yields for automatic plots were 1.47 to 1.91 kg m-2 and 1.62 to 1.83 kg m-2
    for manual plots. Total water use amounts for the P0876HR hybrid were 549 to 759
    mm for automatic plots and 513 to 632 mm for manual plots. For the 33Y75 hybrid,
    the corresponding amounts were 587 to 824 mm for automatic plots and 548 to 749
    mm for manual plots. The ARSP software managed irrigation scheduling of the automatic
    plots by combining the operation of the ISSCADAS and the center pivot system.

    & Citations References Media Tables Share Abstract A center pivot was completely
    automated using the temperature-time-threshold method of irrigation scheduling.
    An array of infrared thermometers was mounted on the center pivot, and these were
    used to remotely determine the crop leaf temperature as an indicator of crop water
    stress. We describe methods used to automatically collect and analyze the canopy
    temperature data and control the moving irrigation system based on the data analysis.
    Automatic irrigation treatments were compared with manually scheduled irrigation
    treatments under the same center pivot during the growing seasons of 2004 and
    2005. Manual irrigations were scheduled on a weekly basis using the neutron probe
    to determine the profile water content and the amount of water needed to replenish
    the profile to field capacity. In both years, there was no significant difference
    between manual and automatic treatments in soybean water use efficiency or irrigation
    water use efficiency. The automatic irrigation system has the potential to simplify
    management, while maintaining the yields of intensely managed irrigation. Introduction
    An automated irrigation scheduling and control system that responds to stress
    indicators from the crop itself has the potential to lower crop management and
    labor requirements, and to increase yields per unit of irrigation water (Evett
    et al. 2000). Burke (1993) and Burke and Oliver (1993) showed that plant enzymes
    operate most efficiently in a narrow temperature range termed the thermal kinetic
    window. Wanjura et al. (1992, 1995) demonstrated that the use of this window as
    a canopy temperature threshold could be used as a criterion for simplifying and
    automating irrigation scheduling. Upchurch et al. received U.S. Patent No. 5,539,637
    in 1996 for an irrigation management system based on this optimal leaf temperature
    for enzyme activity and a climate dependent time threshold. This was termed the
    temperature-time-threshold (TTT) method of irrigation scheduling. With this method,
    for every minute that the canopy temperature exceeds the threshold temperature,
    1 min is added to the daily total (Fig. 1). If this daily total exceeds the time
    threshold at the end of the day, then an irrigation of a fixed depth is scheduled.
    Since humidity can limit evaporative cooling, minutes are not accrued if the wet
    bulb temperature is greater than the threshold temperature minus 2 ° C . Evett
    et al. (1996, 2000) demonstrated in drip irrigated plots near Bushland, Texas
    that automatic irrigation using the TTT method was more responsive to plant stress
    and showed the potential to outyield manual irrigation scheduling based on a 100%
    replenishment of crop water use as determined by neutron probe soil water content
    measurements. Fig. 1. Canopy temperatures of three replicate plots on corn in
    1999 (Evett et al. 2000) compared with air temperature. Shown also are horizontal
    bars drawn at the threshold temperature of 28 ° C and over the length of the threshold
    time ( 240 min ) . Because the canopy was above the threshold temperature for
    more than the threshold time on day 234, irrigation occurred in the evening of
    that day, but not in the evening of day 235. The TTT irrigation scheduling method
    is easily automated with solid set systems such as drip irrigation where canopy
    temperatures can be measured in stationary positions in the field throughout the
    day. However, infrared radiation sensors mounted on self-propelled center pivots
    or linear move irrigation systems can provide only one-time-of-day canopy temperature
    measurements at each field location, and these measurements occur at uncertain
    times of day. The application of the TTT system of irrigation scheduling to specific
    locations under a center pivot or linear move irrigation system requires a method
    of determining diurnal canopy temperature dynamics at each location from these
    one-time-of-day canopy temperature measurements. It also requires a method of
    automatically collecting and analyzing the canopy temperature data and controlling
    the moving irrigation system based on the data analysis. The objectives of this
    study were to: (1) apply the TTT method of irrigation scheduling to a center pivot
    irrigation system with an array of infrared thermocouples mounted on the center
    pivot itself; (2) configure the center pivot to be automatically controlled according
    to the plant water needs as determined from the TTT method of irrigation scheduling;
    and (3) compare the automatic irrigation scheduling to manual irrigation scheduling
    based on neutron probe soil water content measurements in the same field. Diurnal
    Canopy Temperature Determination Extrapolating a diurnal canopy temperature curve
    from a one-time-of-day measurement requires an estimation of the canopy temperature
    dynamics due to changing environmental conditions. Several different models exist
    that can predict the dynamics of the crop canopy temperature as part of a soil-plant-atmosphere
    energy balance (Evett and Lascano 1993). However, these models require as input,
    detailed weather data, as well as knowledge of soil- and plant-specific parameters
    that are neither readily available nor easy to measure. The most direct and simple
    way to determine how changing environmental conditions over a day affect canopy
    temperature dynamics is to measure canopy temperature in one stationary reference
    location. Canopy temperatures in other parts of a field, which may be under different
    stresses, may be modeled relative to this reference using one-time-of-day temperature
    measurements from those locations (Peters and Evett, 2004a,b). If predawn canopy
    temperatures throughout the field ( T e ; e for early) are assumed to be the same,
    then T rmt = T e + ( T rmt , t − T e ) ( T ref − T e ) T ref , t − T e (1) where
    T rmt ( ° C ) =calculated canopy temperature at the remote location; T ref ( °
    C ) =canopy temperature from the reference location at the same time interval
    as T rmt ( ° C ) ; T rmt , t ( ° C ) =one-time-of-day canopy temperature measurement
    at the remote location at any daylight time t ; and T ref , t ( ° C ) =measured
    reference temperature from the time t that the remote temperature measurement
    was taken. Materials and Methods The experimental site was a three-tower, 127
    m long research center pivot located at the USDA-ARS Conservation and Production
    Research Laboratory in Bushland, Texas ( 35 ° 11 ′ N, 102 ° 06 ′ W, 1,170 m elev.
    above MSL). The towers are located at the radial distances of 33.8, 73.3, and
    112.8 m . Data were collected during 2004 and 2005 on soybeans grown on a Pullman
    fine, mixed, superactive, thermic Torrertic Paleustoll. Only half of the field
    was used to allow the other half’s soil water content differences from the previous
    year to be evened up with a cover crop. Alternate halves were used in 2004 and
    2005. Soybeans were planted in concentric circles out from the center point (Fig.
    2). Four different water level treatments 12.2 m ( 40 ft ) wide were applied radially
    out from the center point (100, 66, and 33% of projected irrigation needs, and
    a dry land, or no irrigation treatment). Each drop was pressure regulated to 6
    psi . The irrigation level was controlled by nozzle sizes as appropriate. Drops
    were spaced every other row ( 1.52 m ) and irrigated with low energy precision
    application (LEPA) drag socks. The flow rate from each drop was evaluated using
    a large bucket, a scale, and a stop watch and the system performance was found
    to adequately match the design requirements. The furrows were dammed/diked to
    limit water movement in the furrows. Radially, two replications of each of the
    irrigation level treatments were applied in a randomized block pattern with the
    second tower wheel track serving as the block separation line. The innermost plot
    was not used. Along the arc of the irrigated half circle, there were three replications
    each of an automatically controlled (via the TTT method) treatment, and a treatment
    that was manually scheduled (using soil water deficiency as determined by neutron
    probe soil moisture content readings). These treatments were applied alternatively
    to 28 deg “pie slices” in order to block for any differences in soil types underneath
    the pivot. The two radial and three arc-wise replications created a total of six
    replicate plots for each treatment. A neutron probe access tube was located in
    the center of each plot (48 total tubes) in the crop row (top of the bed). Two
    additional rows of soybeans were planted around the outside and inside edges of
    the pivot to help minimize border effects. Agronomic practices common in the region
    for high yields were applied. Fig. 2. Automatic center pivot irrigation experiment
    plot plan divided into six “pie slices.” Pie slices labeled Auto were automatically
    irrigated, while those labeled Manual were manually irrigated. Irrigation amounts
    were 100% of the amount determined by each of the two irrigation scheduling methods
    used in the arcs labeled 100%, and in the arcs labeled 67% and 33%, the irrigation
    amounts were 67% and 33% of the amount applied in 100% arcs. The pivot’s position
    was determined using a low-cost GPS receiver mounted near the end of the pivot
    (Peters and Evett 2005). The pivot movement and positioning were controlled remotely
    by a computer, located in a nearby building, which communicated through two different
    900 MHz radios (Fig. 3). One radio was part of a center pivot remote control system
    “base station” produced by Valmont Industries. This radio communicated with the
    pivot through a second radio mounted at the pivot center point, thus, allowing
    status checks and control commands to be sent and received at the pivot control
    panel. The second system consisted of a Campbell Scientific RF400 radio that communicated
    to similar radios connected to a datalogger mounted on the pivot and a separate
    datalogger in the field. Fig. 3. Automatic center pivot control setup The center-pivot-mounted
    datalogger collected data from 16 infrared thermocouple thermometers (IRTCs) that
    were attached to the trusses of the pivot (Figs. 3 and 4). They were mounted on
    the leading side of the pivot trusses (approximately 3 m above the ground surface)
    and the pivot was only allowed to irrigate in one direction so that the sensors
    would not view wet canopy. The IRTCs were oriented so that they pointed parallel
    to the center pivot arm (perpendicular to crop rows) towards a spot in the middle
    of each concentric irrigation treatment plot. In order to minimize sensor angle
    related effects, two IRTCs were aimed at approximately the same spot from either
    side of each plot. The average of these two readings for each plot was used. Wanjura
    et al. (1995) reported that canopy temperatures differed less than 0.5 ° C when
    measured by either one sensor in the nadir position, or two sensors pointed at
    the row from opposite directions. The IRTCs were connected to a multiplexer (Campbell
    Scientific AM25T) at the second tower, which in turn was connected to a datalogger
    placed at the third and last tower. The IRTCs sensed canopy temperature on 10
    sec intervals, and the 1 min averages were logged. Fig. 4. Photo of the center
    pivot showing the infrared thermocouples (IRTCs) mounted on the pivot trusses,
    the field IRTCs, and the field datalogging equipment In 2004, the IRTCs used were
    narrow field of view (ratio of distance to view spot size was 10:1) (Exergen model
    IRt/c.JR-10) and were sensed by a Campbell Scientific CR10X datalogger. At the
    end of the season in 2004 it was discovered that the narrow field-of-view IRTCs
    were sensitive to the sensor body temperature, causing temperature errors. Thus,
    in 2005, a wider field-of-view (2:1) sensor (Exergen model IRt/c.2-T-80), which
    was relatively insensitive to sensor body temperature, was used and mounted on
    additional structures built on the pivot so that the sensors could be placed closer
    to the canopy (approximately 1 m from the ground surface) to avoid seeing wetted
    canopy. Sixteen IRTCs (Exergen model IRt/c.2-T-80) were mounted in stationary
    locations in the field and connected to a separate datalogger (Fig. 3). Each IRTC
    was mounted in the nadir position over the crop row close enough to the canopy
    so that soil was not included in the field of view. These IRTCs were adjusted
    up with the changing height of the canopy. One IRTC was mounted in each irrigation
    level of both the automatic and manual treatments. These IRTCs were similarly
    connected through a multiplexer (Campbell Scientific AM25T) and to a datalogger
    (Campbell Scientific CR21X). The datalogger logged the 5 min averages of each
    of the IRTC readings collected on 10 sec intervals. Each IRTC was separately calibrated
    using a black body (Omega Black Point, model BB701) before the season began. A
    second order polynomial was fitted to the results of the calibration and each
    IRTC was individually corrected by the data analysis software running on the control
    computer in the nearby building. The sensors were checked periodically throughout
    the season and they seemed relatively unaffected by dust or bugs. During an automatic
    irrigation event, the pivot stopped at the edge of the treatment, paused 10 min
    to drain, and then ran dry over the manual irrigation treatment. It would then
    pressure up again for the next automatic irrigation treatment, and continued on
    in this fashion until all of the automatic irrigation segments were irrigated.
    An application depth of 20 mm was applied at each automatic irrigation event.
    This was equivalent to the maximum, two-day evapotranspiration rate for the region
    during the hot, windy summer months. After irrigating the last automatic plot,
    the pivot continued on around dry to its starting point. During a manual irrigation
    event, the pivot performed similarly except it would irrigate only the manual
    irrigation treatments at a manually set application depth required to replenish
    soil water content to field capacity ( 0.33 m 3 m − 3 ) , thus, preventing crop
    stress for the 100% treatments. The soil water deficit was determined by weekly
    neutron probe readings in the 100% manual irrigation treatments. The neutron probe
    was field calibrated as in Evett and Steiner (1995) and was read at 20 cm depth
    increments. A depth control stand (Evett et al. 2003) was used to improve accuracy
    in the near-surface ( 10 cm depth) reading. In order to both manually and automatically
    control the same pivot, automatic irrigations were only allowed on even days of
    year, and manual irrigations were only allowed on odd days of year. The central
    control computer was programmed to call the pivot-mounted datalogger and the pivot
    control panel every minute to retrieve status reports. Software was written in
    Visual Basic that reviewed the status reports every minute to determine whether
    the pivot had crossed a plot boundary. If it had, new instructions were sent to
    the pivot depending on its location and the program (automatic or manual) that
    was running at the time. In this way, the complex motion of the center pivot was
    controlled. The field datalogger was polled only once a day soon after midnight.
    At this time, the previous day’s data were analyzed to determine the next day’s
    strategy. If the pivot did not move during the previous day, the temperature curve
    collected by the pivot-mounted IRTCs was used to determine whether irrigation
    was required based on the canopy temperature measurements from where the pivot
    was located. If the pivot did move during the previous day, then a subroutine
    was called that scaled one-time-of-day temperature measurements and made decisions
    based on the results. The two canopy temperature measurements from the field-mounted
    IRTCs in the 100%, automatic treatments were averaged together and used as the
    reference curve for scaling the one-time-of-day measurement into a diurnal curve
    [Eq. (1)]. To establish the plots, the plots were uniformly irrigated until the
    soil between the rows was not visible when viewed at a 45 deg angle from the pivot
    IRTCs. At the end of the season, the dry yield was determined by harvesting a
    3.48 m 2 sample near the center of each plot. The total dry biomass was measured,
    as well as the dry yield Y ( kg m − 2 ) , and average bean weight. The total water
    use W U (m) was determined by subtracting the soil profile water content (m) determined
    at the first measurement date from the water content determined after harvest,
    and adding the total amount of irrigation I (m) and rainfall (m) for that time
    period. Water use efficiency (WUE) was calculated as WUE = Y W U (2) and irrigation
    water use efficiency (IWUE) was calculated as IWUE = Y − Y D I (3) where Y D =mean
    yield ( kg m − 2 ) in the dryland plots. Both WUE and IWUE are given in units
    of kg ∕ m 3 . Results and Discussion Exergen IRTCs have a capacitor built into
    the sensor to help to minimize the effects of ambient electromagnetic noise on
    the sensor’s readings. This capacitance interacts with the Campbell Scientific
    CR10X datalogger to give readings that are slightly incorrect. The pivot IRTCs
    were wired into a CR10X. This is not an issue with the Campbell Scientific CR21X,
    which was used for the stationary field measurements. The readings from the narrow
    field-of-view sensors that were mounted on the pivot also were very sensitive
    to the sensor body temperature. These errors were much higher than those from
    the wider field-of-view sensors mounted in the field. It was learned that these
    were simply poor sensors that were subsequently replaced by the manufacturer for
    virtually no cost. Because the sensors were calibrated independently in the laboratory
    before mounting them on the pivot, and because the readings were reasonable, this
    error was not caught until after the 2004 season was effectively over. This resulted
    in pivot IRTC temperatures that were 3 – 5 ° C low. The pivot IRTC measured temperatures
    were compared to the field IRTC data from times when the pivot was located in
    approximately the same location. The temperatures from the pivot mounted IRTC
    temperatures varied linearly with the more correct field IRTCs. Regression was
    used to obtain the equation T corrected = 0.7641 × T pivot + 9.1713 (4) This equation
    was used to obtain a corrected ( T corrected , ° C ) canopy temperature using
    the observed IRTC pivot temperatures ( T pivot , ° C ) , ( r 2 of 0.9731). To
    evaluate the effect that this error had on the irrigation experiment, the corrected
    temperatures were processed with a specifically written computer program. The
    irrigation decisions (of what should have happened) were compared against what
    was actually done. The results showed that in five different instances throughout
    the season, automatic irrigations should have run, but did not because the temperatures
    were reported low. The temperature threshold was effectively set at 30 ° C instead
    of the 27 ° C for soybeans that is specified by theory. When tested, there was
    no difference in the irrigation decisions made by the uncorrected data with a
    30 ° C temperature threshold and the corrected temperatures with a 27 ° C temperature
    threshold. A different IRTC was used in 2005 as described above and the problem
    was corrected for the following season. The yield and water use data were analyzed
    using SAS (SAS Institute, Inc., Cary, N.C.) with a procedure for mixed models
    (proc mixed) with the Tukey-Kramer method for adjusting for multiplicity. Results

    manual irrigation treatment yielded significantly more than the automatic irrigation
    treatment ( Pr > ∣ t ∣ = 0.035 ) with an average difference of 0.025 kg ∕ m 2
    (Table 1). We believe that this was mainly due to the sensor issue, which was
    equivalent to the temperature threshold being set 3 ° C greater than it should
    have been. Although not significantly different, the manual treatments also showed
    numerically larger WUE and IWUE. For this first season, there were no significant
    differences between the automatic and the manual treatments for any variable (yield,
    bean mass, etc.) within an irrigation level, with the exception of yield at the
    67% irrigation level. The automatic treatment yielded better in 2005 with the
    IRTC issue corrected than the manual irrigation treatment (Table 2). The differences
    in the treatments could be seen in the crop heights. This difference as measured
    in yield was not significant, however. Because the described system can sample
    the water stress of an entire field instead of discrete points and because the
    automatic system makes irrigation management easier, a nonsignificant difference
    is viewed as a win. In fact, yields from the manual and automatic treatments were
    not significantly different from each other at any of the irrigation levels. The
    automatic treatment used more water than the manual treatment and resulted in
    slightly smaller, though not significantly different, water and irrigation water
    use efficiencies. Yields at the 100% irrigation level were in the range reported
    by Evett et al. (2000) for three years of automatically drip irrigated soybean,
    and by Eck et al. (1987) for three years of fully furrow irrigated soybean. Water
    use efficiencies were larger than those reported by Evett et al. (2000), which
    ranged from 0.25 to 0.51 kg m − 3 for drip irrigated soybean at the same location.
    They were also larger than values ranging from 0.05 to 0.61 kg m − 3 reported
    by Eck et al. (1987). Contrary to results of Evett et al. (2000) and Eck et al.
    (1987), water use efficiency in 2005 was increased by deficit irrigation, though
    not in 2004. WUE was much higher in 2005 because the total water use was much
    lower due to lower evapotranspirative demand. The overall average total water
    use (WU) in 2005 was 236 mm . In 2004, it was almost twice that at 445 mm . In
    2005, there was only 27 mm of precipitation and an average of 133 mm of irrigation
    across all of the plots. In 2004, there was 211 mm of precipitation and 173 mm
    average irrigation across all of the plots. The large differences in the dry (no
    irrigation) treatment yields and total water use between years demonstrates the
    large difference in precipitation between the two years. Summary and Conclusions
    A center pivot was configured to automatically irrigate, based on crop stress
    signals sensed by infrared thermocouples mounted on the center pivot. These automatic
    treatments were compared with a manually scheduled treatment over two growing
    seasons in 2004 and 2005. In 2004, there was an interaction of the sensors with
    the datalogger, and incorrect canopy temperatures were recorded by the pivot-mounted
    IRTCs. This resulted in the equivalent of the threshold temperature being set
    at 30 ° C instead of the prescribed 27 ° C . Therefore, the automatic irrigations
    ran less often than they should have in 2004. Because of this, the manual treatments
    yielded significantly more than the automatic treatments. However, during the
    following season, the difference between the manual and automatic irrigation treatments
    was not significant, with the automatic treatment yielding slightly more than
    the manual treatment. There were no significant differences in water use efficiency
    in either year. By helping with irrigation scheduling on center pivots, the automatic
    irrigation system saves management time and lessens decision making, and a nonsignificant
    difference is viewed as a win. We believe that the costs and simplicity of methods
    presented here may become attractive to producers when available in a turnkey
    commercial package. This is especially true since the methods have the potential
    to simplify management and reduce labor costs, while maintaining or increasing
    yields compared with intensively and scientifically managed manual irrigation
    scheduling. Notation The following symbols are used in this paper: I = total amount

    Get rights and content Abstract This paper describes some new approaches for enhancing
    infrared thermometry (IRT) as a technique for detecting stomatal closure as a
    measure of plant water stress in humid environments. Although infrared thermometry
    has been widely used in arid climates for detecting plant stress (as indicated
    by stomatal closure) and for irrigation scheduling it has been found to be less
    reliable in more cooler humid climates. The use of wet and dry reference surfaces
    to reduce the method''s sensitivity to environmental variation is described and
    indexes based on IRT measurements of the temperatures of individual leaves and
    of reference surfaces in the same environment are evaluated. Both an index that
    corresponds to Idso''s original crop water stress index, but based on `wet'' and
    `dry'' reference leaves, and an index that is linearly related to leaf conductance
    were derived and shown to be closely related to measured leaf conductance in runner
    bean crops under a range of conditions. Various types of reference surface were
    evaluated and the use of non-transpiring and wet real leaves was found to be particularly
    convenient. Previous article in issue Next article in issue Keywords Crop water

    factor limiting crop production and there is an increasing premium on making the
    best use of available water for irrigation. Irrigation scheduling is most usually
    based on soil water balance approaches (see e.g. Jones, 1990), though there is
    increasing interest in the use of methods that depend on plant responses to water
    deficit. The most sensitive plant responses to soil water deficit, and hence those
    with the greatest potential value for irrigation scheduling, tend to be actual
    growth rate and stomatal closure; these are generally much more sensitive to soil
    water status than is the leaf water potential (ψl) itself (e.g. Bates and Hall,
    1981; Jones, 1990; Davies and Zhang, 1991). Although it is feasible to measure
    stomatal conductance directly by means of leaf porometers, the problems of calibration
    and of adequately sampling the population of leaves in a field crop has restricted
    the use of porometers for practical irrigation scheduling. An important consequence
    of the stomatal closure that occurs when plants are subject to water stress is
    that energy dissipation is decreased so leaf temperature tends to rise; the idea
    of using leaf or canopy temperature as an indicator of plant water stress is not
    a new one (e.g. Tanner, 1963), but it was popularised by Idso and colleagues (Idso
    et al., 1981; Jackson et al., 1981) in the early 1980s. On the basis of results
    obtained in the arid climate of Arizona they proposed a `crop water-stress index''
    (here given the symbol ICWSI) based on the difference between canopy temperature,
    as measured using infrared thermometry (IRT), and that of a `non-water stressed
    baseline'' representing the typical canopy temperature of a well watered crop.
    A range of empirical studies (e.g. Idso, 1982) have shown that there may be different
    non-water-stressed baselines for different crops and that ideally these need to
    be determined for each agroclimatic zone in which the crop is being grown. Although
    the theoretical basis of the approach is well established (see Jackson, 1982;
    Jones, 1992) and many studies have confirmed that in arid and semi-arid environments
    infra-red thermometry can provide a useful indicator of crop water stress and
    of yield loss, and even of leaf water potential (e.g. Hatfield, 1983; O''Toole
    et al., 1984), it does have some severe limitations in humid climates and in environments
    with significant climatic variability (Hipps et al., 1985). In particular, for
    any given stomatal conductance, the leaf-to-air temperature difference depends
    not only on the atmospheric water vapour pressure deficit, which is fully accounted
    for in the calculation of ICWSI, but it also depends on windspeed, on canopy surface
    roughness, and on net radiation. In humid climates these errors can lead to variation
    in the non-water stressed baseline becoming of the same order as the range of
    canopy temperatures over the full range of stomatal conductances. A further problem
    is that the cloudless conditions that are required for application of the original
    approach may not occur often enough in maritime climates such as in the United
    Kingdom to allow the regular measurements of ICWSI that are required for effective
    irrigation scheduling. Another difficulty that has commonly been found with the
    application of infrared thermometry to assess crop water stress has been the difficulty
    of separating measurements of leaf temperature from soil temperature, which is
    often many degrees higher than leaf temperature. One approach is to combine thermometry
    with the use of a spectral vegetation index to correct for the amount of soil
    in the field of view (Moran et al., 1994), alternatively, as in the present study,
    one can avoid the problem by studying single leaves using a narrow acceptance
    angle IRT sensor. A number of approaches have been suggested for improving the
    sensitivity of infrared thermometry as a measure of crop water stress in humid
    regions. Fuchs and Tanner (1966)and Berliner et al. (1984)used well watered plots
    as a reference rather than the empirical non-water-stressed baseline, as a means
    of improving precision in humid environments. Unfortunately well-watered plots
    are not usually available, so De Lorenzi et al. (1993), for example, have proposed
    modelling the behaviour of the well-watered crop by simulating the variation in
    canopy resistance as a function of weather conditions. Other approaches have involved
    extension of the ICWSI concept to include other environmental variables. For example,
    indexes that include net radiation as well as water vapour pressure deficit have
    been proposed (Jackson et al., 1981; Keener and Kirchner, 1983). Yet others have
    suggested a very different approach to detection of stress by infra-red thermometry
    based on variability in canopy temperature. For example, Aston and Van Bavel (1972)and
    Fuchs (1990)have pointed out that as a crop becomes water stressed canopy temperature
    becomes increasingly variable. The objective of the present study was to investigate
    the potential for improving the sensitivity of infrared thermometry for calculation
    of stress indexes, or even for the direct estimation of stomatal conductance,
    in temperate climates by using in-canopy measurements of similarly exposed wet
    and dry reference surfaces as a basis for comparison with measured leaf temperatures.
    2. Materials and methods. 2.1. Theory The value of the ICWSI is defined as (Idso
    et al., 1981; Jackson et al., 1981) (1) where Ts is the actual canopy surface
    temperature under given environmental conditions, Tmax is the upper bound for
    canopy temperature and equates to the temperature of a non-transpiring canopy
    such as would occur if the stomata were completely closed as a result of drought,
    while Tbase is the `non-water-stressed baseline'' representing the `typical''
    canopy temperature when the stomata are fully open. If instead of referring temperatures
    to those of a well watered crop one uses a wet surface, it becomes straightforward
    to rearrange the basic energy balance equation to estimate the canopy resistance
    to water vapour transfer directly. The theoretical values for leaf or reference
    surface temperatures can be calculated using a standard rearrangement of the leaf
    energy balance (Jones, 1992; Eq. 9.6): (2) where Tl − Ta is the leaf-to-air temperature
    difference, rlW is the leaf resistance to water vapour transfer (assumed to be
    largely determined by the stomatal resistance), raW is the boundary layer resistance
    to water vapour, Rni is the net isothermal radiation (the net radiation that would
    be received by an equivalent surface at air temperature), δe air water vapour
    pressure deficit, rHR is the parallel resistance to heat and radiative transfer,
    γ is the psychrometric constant, ρ is the density of air, cp is the specific heat
    capacity of air and s is the slope of the curve relating saturation vapour pressure
    to temperature. For the following analyses the leaf boundary layer resistance
    to heat transfer (raH) was estimated using the following equation (see Fig. 3.6
    in Jones, 1992) (3) where resistances are expressed in s m−1, d is the leaf characteristic
    dimension (m) and u is windspeed (m s−1). For a dry surface having the same radiative
    and aerodynamic properties the sensible heat loss will equal the net radiation
    absorbed, so that using the concept of net isothermal radiation (see Jones, 1992)
    one can estimate Tdry ( = Tmax in Idso''s formulation) from (4) The temperature
    of the corresponding wet surface (Twet) can be calculated from Eq. (2)by setting
    rlW equal to zero which gives (5) Subtracting Eq. (5)from Eq. (4)and dividing
    by the difference between , , reduces to (6) which can be rearranged to give a
    simple expression for the leaf resistance (7) An important feature of Eq. (7)is
    that rlW can be determined solely from a combination of measurements of the temperatures
    of the leaf and of equivalent wet and dry surfaces and a term that depends only
    on the resistance to heat and water loss through the leaf boundary layer. It is
    notable that the multiplier in this equation is independent of net radiation absorbed
    or of air vapour pressure deficit and only weakly dependent on temperature. Because
    the term (Tdry − Tl) in this equation tends to be quite small and is the difference
    between two quantities that are each quite variable in the field, the behaviour
    of this equation can be rather unstable, so it is generally preferable to use
    its reciprocal, the leaf conductance (glW) (8) In much of what follows we will
    use conductances rather than resistances because transpiration rates are more
    closely related to conductances. For compatibility with much of the micrometeorological
    literature, results are presented using mass units for stomatal conductances (mm
    s−1), though approximate conversion to the molar units (mol m−2 s−1) used in most
    physiological literature can readily be achieved by multiplication by 0.04 (noting
    that this factor is slightly temperature sensitive: Jones, 1992). In addition
    to the basic crop water stress index (ICWSI) defined in Eq. (1), it follows that
    one can define further indexes using the above equations. One possibility is to
    use an index of analogous form to ICWSI but substituting Tdry for Tmax and Twet
    for Tbase, giving (9) An alternative is to define an index (I3) which is proportional
    to stomatal resistance. From Eq. (7), therefore, one can write (10) Finally, from
    Eq. (8)one can define an index (I4) which is proportional to stomatal conductance
    (and hence decreases as stomata close) as (11) 2.2. Field measurements In order
    to test the principles underlying the use of infrared thermometry for estimation
    of stomatal conductances, a number of studies were conducted in the field. The
    studies reported here were conducted on crops of runner beans grown on a slightly
    sandy loam overlying calcareous gravel at Horticulture Research International,
    Wellesbourne, Warwick UK (1°36′W, 52°12′N, 45 m a.m.s.l.) during the summers of
    1995 and 1996. In each year there were three replicates of runner bean with three
    levels of irrigation (A, B and C) in a fully guarded randomised block arrangement
    (40 experimental plants per plot). Soil moisture was monitored using one neutron
    probe per plot in 1995 and by theta-probes (Delta-T Devices, Burwell, Cambs, UK)
    in 1996. Plants were sown in groups of four and grown up 2.5 m canes arranged
    in wigwams with four canes per wigwam. The wigwams were arranged in double rows
    1.2 m apart and 2.6 m between wigwams in each row, an arrangement which approximates
    normal commercial practice in the region. The ground was slightly sculpted into
    broad ridges before planting to ensure effective runoff of rainfall from experimental
    plots using clear polyethylene sheeting laid on the soil; this largely excluded
    rainfall. All plots were provided with seep hose along the rows for irrigation.
    Well irrigated treatments were irrigated two to three times per week (aiming to
    maintain soil moisture close to field capacity), mild stress treatments were irrigated
    at half the rate of the well watered plots and no water was applied to the drought
    plots. Treatments were switched between plots once or twice each season to ensure
    that a range of stomatal conductances were available for testing the sensitivity
    of infrared thermometry. Initial trials with a number of various sized rectangular
    `model'' leaves showed that they responded much more slowly than real leaves to
    environmental changes. The most satisfactory reference surfaces were found to
    be real attached leaves. `Wet'' and `dry'' reference surfaces, respectively, were
    obtained by either wetting both sides thoroughly using a handheld sprayer containing
    water plus a small amount of detergent to act as wetter, or by covering both surfaces
    with a thin coating of petroleum jelly (Vaseline) to prevent transpiration. Leaf
    temperature measurements were made using a `Scheduler® Crop Stress Monitor'',
    kindly provided by Agrichandlers™ (Emma Nash), Hartley Witney, Basingstoke, UK.
    The quoted angle of view was 2.5° and the spectral range was 8–14 μm nominal.
    Estimates of Idso''s crop water stress index (ICWSI) were obtained using necessary
    variables measured by the Scheduler and the inbuilt software (using the calculations
    for grape as there was no calculation available for runner bean). Reference leaves
    were also measured with the Scheduler, with a wet and a dry leaf reading being
    taken before and after each pair of readings on experimental leaves, and the appropriate
    reference values averaged for calculation of stress indexes. Direct measurements
    of the temperature of some leaves were also made using 40 gauge copper-constantan
    thermocouples inserted into minor veins on the underside of leaves and fixed using
    glue from medical sticking plasters supplemented by 3 mm squares of plaster at
    least 5 mm from the thermocouple junction. Outputs were recorded on a DL2 data
    logger (Delta-T Devices, Burwell, Cambs, UK) along with meteorological data (air
    temperature, humidity, solar radiation (Kipp solarimeter) and windspeed as recorded
    by a Delta-T Devices Meteorological station). The meteorological station was situated
    adjacent to the trial, no more than 20 m from any individual plot. Stomatal conductances
    were measured using a steady-state porometer (EGM-1, PP-Systems, Stotfold, Beds,
    UK) on the same leaves as used for infrared measurement within 2 to 4 min following
    the infrared measurements (during which time stomatal conductance is unlikely
    to have changed significantly, Barradas and Jones, 1996). 3. Results 3.1. Theoretical
    sensitivity and effect of comparison with different reference surfaces The sensitivity
    of leaf temperature to a given change in stomatal (or `surface'') conductance
    sets the limit to the resolution of infrared thermometry. This sensitivity is
    strongly dependent, not only on the value of the leaf conductance, but also on
    environmental conditions. The magnitude of the change in leaf temperature for
    a 20% reduction in leaf conductance from a `typical'' value of 5 mm s−1 (200 mmol
    m−2 s−1) is shown for a range of values of net radiation, windspeed (and hence
    boundary layer resistance) and humidity in Fig. 1. These values were calculated
    using Eq. (2)and assuming Tair = 293 K, a windspeed of 0.5 m s−1, a characteristic
    leaf dimension of 0.05 m, and a relative humidity of 66%, unless otherwise stated.
    It is clear from this figure that the sensitivity of leaf temperature to changes
    in conductance increases with net radiation absorbed, with decreasing windspeed
    (equivalent to increasing leaf size and increasing boundary layer resistance)
    and with increasing vapour pressure deficit. Download : Download full-size image

    ——— ———125 W m−2; — — — = 300 W m−2; – – – = 450 W m−2), and (c) dependence on
    windspeed and net radiation (symbols as for b). Although the leaf temperature
    change for a given change in stomatal conductance is, of course, independent of
    whether it is measured as (Tl − Ta) or (Tl − Tdry) or (Tl − Twet), it is worth
    noting that the sensitivity of each of these measures to changes in environment
    can be very different depending on stomatal conductance and environmental conditions
    (Jones, 1994; Jones et al., 1997). 3.2. Use of reference leaves A key feature
    of natural environments is that leaf temperatures fluctuate rapidly as radiation,
    windspeed and air temperatures vary. The example in Fig. 2 shows typical natural
    variation in the field of bean leaf temperature from a moderately stressed plot,
    with changes of 5° or more occurring within minutes. Also shown in this figure
    are the corresponding dynamics of similarly exposed wet and dry reference leaves
    showing that the temperature dynamics of these were similar to those of the experimental
    leaf with all leaves having time constants of the order of 10 s at the typical
    windspeeds involved. Although the time constant would be expected to depend slightly
    on the surface conductance (see Eq. 9.11; Jones, 1992), it appears that for practical
    purposes the dynamics of these different leaves are similar. Temperature measurements
    with the Scheduler® of bean leaves and of the `wet'' and `dry'' reference bean
    leaves were consistently within 0.5°C of the temperatures measured using thermocouples
    with no evidence for any consistent differences between the three types of leaf.
    The various artificial models tested all had significantly longer time constants
    (data not shown) than the `wet'' or `dry'' bean leaves so were abandoned for subsequent
    studies. Download : Download full-size image Fig. 2. Typical dynamics over a period
    of about 40 min of (a) the temperatures of a runner bean leaf (⋯⋯), a `wet'' reference
    bean leaf (— — —), a `dry'' reference bean leaf (——————) and of the air (∘), together
    with (b) variation in incident short-wave irradiance (W m−2). 3.3. Performance
    of stress indexes Assuming for illustrative purposes that the conductance of fully
    open stomata is 16 mm s−1 (Körner et al., 1979), one can use Eq. (2)to calculate
    the appropriate value of Tbase for calculation of the ICWSI and hence, by substituting
    into Eq. (1), get the dependence of ICWSI on leaf conductance and windspeed. Typical
    results are shown in Fig. 3(a) which was calculated assuming a net radiation of
    200 W m−2, a temperature of 293 K, a leaf characteristic dimension of 0.1 m, a
    maximum conductance (glW) for fully open stomata of 16 mm s−1, and a relative
    humidity of 66%. The dependence on leaf conductance is clearly non-linear with
    the degree of curvature increasing with decreasing windspeed. If instead of referring
    temperatures to that of a surface with open stomata, one refers them to that of
    a wet surface (glW = ∞; i.e. I2), the lines diverge further (Fig. 3(b)), with
    the degree of curvature again being strongly dependent on windspeed. Download

    pointed out above, I3 is somewhat unstable so a more convenient index is provided
    by its reciprocal (Eq. (11)). Fig. 4(a) shows that this index (I4) is linearly
    related to the leaf conductance (glW), while Fig. 4(b) shows that the slope is
    a function only of temperature and the boundary layer conductance (gaH, which
    is defined as the reciprocal of raH). Download : Download full-size image Fig.

    and porometer data were obtained on the runner bean crops on 16 dates in 1995
    and 13 in 1996 to allow testing of the various stress indexes. Some contrasting
    examples taken from days when a good range of stomatal conductances were available
    are shown in Fig. 5 to illustrate how the different indexes perform under typical
    UK conditions. Generally both I2 and I4 showed substantially better relationships
    to measured stomatal conductance than did the ICWSI calculated by the Scheduler.
    There was greatest disparity between methods on cooler days with less sunshine,
    with the Scheduler ICWSI being particularly variable on 4 September 1995 when
    air temperature was between 19 and 21°C and solar radiation between 150 and 400
    W m−2. Similarly 14 August 1996 was much cooler and cloudier (ca. 17.5°C and 200–300
    W m−2) than 19 August (ca. 30°C and 400–800 W m−2). On consistently hot and sunny
    days all methods gave reasonable relationships with measured stomatal conductance
    (data not shown). Download : Download full-size image Fig. 5. Comparisons of ICWSI
    (as calculated by the Scheduler using the built in calibration for grape) (a,
    b, c), I2 (calculated as (Tl − Twet)/(Tdry − Twet)) (d, e, f), and I4 (calculated
    as (Tdry − Tl)/(Tl − Twet)) (g, h, i) using data for runner beans. Different symbols
    indicate different irrigation treatments. On each occasion the best discrimination
    of stomatal conductance was achieved with I4, which was linearly related to measured
    conductance. The discrimination was especially good at the higher conductances
    (compare Fig. 5(i) and (f)). Note that the indexes often show values in ranges
    not expected from the theory. ICWSI and I2 should be in the range 0–1, while I3
    and I4 should not fall below zero. Values outside these ranges indicate that the
    measured leaf temperature is out of the range defined by the wet and dry references
    used. Such variation is only to be expected as stomata close and Tl approaches
    Tdry. The extreme sensitivity of I3 to observations where leaf temperature exceeds
    the temperature of the dry reference surface are illustrated for the 4 September
    1995 data in Fig. 6(a) (compare with other indexes calculated for the same data
    and shown in Fig. 5(a),(d) and (g), of which all except ICWSI appear more reliable).

    1 : 1 relationship. The different symbols indicate different irrigation treatments.
    Although accurate estimates of the boundary layer resistance corresponding to
    individual infrared readings were not available for the present study, an approximation
    was obtained by assuming that the wind speed estimates at the meteorological station
    approximated the values within the plot and that raH could be calculated from
    Eq. (3)assuming a leaf breadth of 15 cm. As can be seen from Fig. 6(b), these
    estimates of stomatal conductance were of the same order as the values measured
    with the porometer. 4. Discussion Major limitations to the use of infrared thermometry
    as an indicator of stomatal closure and hence as a basis for irrigation scheduling
    have included the sensitivity of leaf temperature to environmental conditions
    (e.g. Walker and Hatfield, 1983) and the small absolute temperature changes that
    occur as stomata close in the more humid environments and low levels of incident
    radiation that are common in more temperate or maritime climates. The purpose
    of the work described here was to provide a method to improve the reliability
    of infrared-based stress indexes in such conditions by reducing the error associated
    with estimation of the necessary values of Tmax and Tmin. The approach was based
    on replacing theoretical estimates of Tmax and Tbase by measured temperatures
    of appropriate reference surfaces. Across a wide range of weather conditions at
    a site in the UK the new indexes were clearly better, or at least equivalent to,
    the original Crop Water Stress Index (Idso et al., 1981; Jackson et al., 1981;
    Idso, 1982). The results also show that Eq. (11)can even be used to estimate glW
    from IRT measurements, but it requires reliable estimates of the gaH. A number
    of questions arise, however, when one attempts to optimise such an approach. Perhaps
    the most important is the choice of reference surface. Preliminary trials established
    that the typically rapid leaf temperature fluctuations in the runner bean canopy
    at Wellesbourne, ruled out the use of slowly responding physical model reference
    surfaces, leading to the use of real leaves as wet and dry references. Because
    of the localised turbulence structure within crop canopies any reference surfaces
    need to be physically close to the sampled leaves and with similar orientation
    and exposure. Rather than using automatic recording of reference surface temperatures,
    it was found convenient to use the IRT to measure temperatures of `wet'' and `dry''
    reference leaves established within the canopy. Most effective minimisation of
    errors could be achieved by averaging reference temperatures measured immediately
    before and after the sample. Although the ICWSI or any of the other leaf temperature-based
    measures described in this paper can provide a useful indication of the need for
    irrigation, or its timing, they are less well adapted to estimation of the amount
    of irrigation water that is needed. Estimation of amount of irrigation requires
    empirical calibration for different systems. The use of infrared thermometry,
    and the modifications described in the present paper, are therefore most suited
    as a readily portable system for spot measurements in crops as a check for monitoring
    the success of routine soil moisture-based irrigation scheduling schemes. Establishing
    the representative wet and dry reference leaves in the crop that are needed for
    the present approach only takes a few minutes at any site. The availability of
    such a spot check is particularly valuable because calculations of soil water
    balance can be subject to significant cumulative errors (Doorenbos, 1984). It
    is also possible for infrared thermometry-based approaches to be applied to the
    automatic control of trickle irrigation or other irrigation systems where small
    amounts of water are applied frequently. Indeed Wanjara et al. (1992)have described
    an automated trickle irrigation system based on continuous infrared monitoring
    of canopy temperature. The present approach of using reference surfaces could
    potentially improve the reliability of such automated control systems for humid
    environments, though it would probably be necessary to use physical models as
    reference surfaces which would need to be monitored using thermocouples. Our preliminary
    studies indicated that it would be necessary for these reference surfaces to have
    similar time constants to those of real leaves. 5. Concluding remarks The results
    presented above support the concept that the sensitivity of infrared thermometry
    as an indicator of plant stress (acting through changes in stomatal aperture)
    can be improved for humid environments by the use of artificial wet and dry reference
    surfaces and careful choice of the stress index used. The improvement in sensitivity
    arises from a reduction in errors associated with short-term variability of the
    values of Tbase and Tmax which is not accounted for in the usual formulation of
    Idso''s crop water stress index. Reformulation of the energy balance equation
    to derive an index proportional to stomatal conductance was found to be particularly
    stable, and with some further assumptions could be used to estimate stomatal conductance
    directly from infrared thermometry. Acknowledgements I am grateful to the Ministry

    and content Highlights • Sensor positioning and accuracy effect on irrigation
    efficiency is investigated. • A mathematical model incorporating a system-dependent
    boundary condition is used. • Soil moisture sensors positioning and accuracy considerably
    affect irrigation efficiency. • Models are efficient tools for irrigation scheduling
    characteristics investigation. Abstract Recent advances in electromagnetic sensor
    technologies have made automated irrigation scheduling a reality using state-of-the-art
    soil moisture sensing devices. However, many of the available guidelines for sensor
    placement were empirically determined from site and crop specific experiments.
    Sensors accuracy could be also an important factor affecting irrigation efficiency.
    This study investigates how soil moisture sensors positioning and accuracy may
    affect the performance of soil moisture based surface drip irrigation scheduling
    systems under various conditions. For this purpose several numerical experiments
    were carried out using a mathematical model, incorporating a system-dependent
    boundary condition in order to simulate soil moisture based irrigation scheduling
    systems. The results of this study provided clear evidence that soil moisture
    sensors positioning and accuracy may considerably affect irrigation efficiency
    in soil moisture based drip irrigation scheduling systems. In specific cases the
    effect of soil moisture sensors positioning was as high as 16%; however, when
    nearby sensor positions were examined, the observed differences were generally
    low. The effect of sensors accuracy was even clearer. For the lower sensor''s
    error level studied (±0.01 cm3 cm−3) the effect on irrigation efficiency ranged
    between 2.5% and 6.4%, while for the higher error level (±0.03 cm3 cm−3) the effect
    ranged between 10.2% and 18.7%. These results highlight the importance of a detailed
    study taking into account the characteristics of specific crops, irrigation, and
    scheduling systems as well as soil moisture sensors in order to provide a sound
    basis for improved irrigation scheduling. The need for soil specific calibration
    of the sensors used in such systems is highlighted as well. Lastly, a significant
    outcome of this study is the ability of computer models to serve as efficient
    tools for the detailed investigation of sensors positioning and accuracy, or other
    automated scheduling system characteristics. Previous article in issue Next article

    sensors 1. Introduction Water conservation in agriculture has recently received
    much attention in the light of increasing competition for fresh water resources
    between the various users, especially in semi-arid and arid regions facing limited
    water availability and at the same time increased water needs. Among the most
    promising current strategies to increase irrigation water use efficiency is the
    use of drip irrigation systems, which facilitate water management due to the highly
    localized application of water and nutrients, and the improvement of irrigation
    scheduling, i.e. by applying the right amount of water to cropland at the right
    time over the growing season. Even though drip irrigation can be proven much more
    efficient than other irrigation systems since only the root zone of the cropped
    area is irrigated, improper management may lead to waste of water or leaching
    of soluble chemicals such as nitrate (Dukes et al., 2007, Zotarelli et al., 2011).
    However, efficient irrigation management is challenging, due to the many factors
    that should be considered, including climate, crop type, irrigation method, and
    system parameters (Dabach et al., 2013). The goal of irrigation scheduling is
    to make the most efficient use of water and energy by applying the right amount
    of water to cropland at the right time and in the right place, making sure water
    is available when the crop needs it (Tam, 2006). Scheduling maximizes irrigation
    efficiency by minimizing runoff and percolation losses. Proper irrigation management
    requires a sound basis for making irrigation decisions. Methods of irrigation
    scheduling can be classified as static or dynamic. According to the static approach
    the total amount of water for irrigation is allocated without specifying its temporal
    distribution along the growing season. By contrast, in the dynamic approach irrigation
    water is allocated at specific time steps along the growing season in order to
    achieve optimal soil water content conditions in the root zone at every growth
    stage (Shani and Dudley, 2001, Shani et al., 2004). Irrigation scheduling is normally
    based on environmental measurements such as evapotranspiration and soil water
    content or on monitoring plant stress. Many researchers have investigated the
    automation of irrigation systems and the use of soil moisture sensing devices
    such as tensiometers, gypsum blocks, granular matrix sensors (GMS), and electromagnetic
    (EM) sensors. An automated irrigation scheduling system generally consists of
    soil moisture or matric head sensing devises, a control system, and the irrigation
    system components (Dukes and Scholberg, 2005). The use of switching tensiometers
    to automatically control irrigation events has been studied among others by Smajstrla
    and Koo (1986), Clark et al. (1994), Torre-Neto et al. (2000). In most of these
    studies, significant water savings were reported without a negative effect on
    crop yield. However, the use of tensiometers to initiate irrigation is associated
    with several problems, such as entrapped air in the tensiometers, organic growth
    on the ceramic cups, and need for recalibration (Smajstrla and Koo, 1986, Dukes
    and Scholberg, 2005). GMS require less maintenance and can be more easily integrated
    in automated irrigation systems. However, they are very sensitive in soil salinity
    and they often need recalibration. Muñoz-Carpena et al. (2005) found that GMS-based
    irrigation behaved erratically. The above issues of the available matric head
    sensing devises limited the extensive use of automated irrigation scheduling systems.
    Recent advances in EM sensor technology, including their ability to be easily
    automated and the lower cost of recently developed capacitance and frequency EM
    sensors, have made automated irrigation scheduling a reality using state-of-the-art
    soil moisture sensing devices (Blonquist et al., 2006). Several studies investigated
    the use of EM sensors in novel automated irrigation management applications (Blonquist
    et al., 2006, Coates et al., 2006, Dukes et al., 2007, Kim et al., 2009, Kim and
    Evans, 2009, Miralles-Crespo and van Iersel, 2011). In these studies significant
    water savings in comparison with traditional irrigation scheduling approaches,
    as high as 60%, were reported. However, a still unanswered question is how sensor
    positioning and accuracy may affect irrigation efficiency in soil moisture based
    automated irrigation scheduling systems. The wetting profile in the root zone
    of irrigated crops is dynamic and influenced by crop and irrigation system parameters
    such as soil hydraulic properties, irrigation system characteristics (e.g. emitter
    flow rate), root length and structure, and even mulch type when mulches are used.
    Especially in the case of drip irrigation, the non-uniform water distribution
    patterns about drippers make soil water sensor placement a key factor in the performance
    of soil moisture based drip irrigation scheduling schemes (Coelho and Or, 1996).
    More specifically, poor sensor positioning that is not representative of the soil
    moisture conditions in the root zone can result either in crop water stress, or
    in over-irrigation that negates the water saving capabilities of soil moisture
    scheduling (Stieber and Shock, 1995, Coelho and Or, 1996, Schroder et al., 2005,
    Wang et al., 2012). However, many of the available guidelines for sensor placement
    were empirically determined from site and crop specific experiments. Soil moisture
    sensors accuracy could be also an important factor affecting the efficiency of
    soil moisture sensor based irrigation scheduling systems. Several recent studies
    on the performance of new electrical capacitance and frequency EM sensors extensively
    discuss issues of sensor-to-sensor variability and sensor accuracy (e.g. Seyfried
    and Murdock, 2004, Kargas and Kerkides, 2008, Kizito et al., 2008, Parsons and
    Bandaranayake, 2008, Kargas and Soulis, 2012). Regarding the sensor-to-sensor
    variability, variations as high as 0.04 cm3 cm−3 are being reported. In most cases
    the sensors accuracy when the factory calibration equations are used ranges between
    0.03 cm3 cm−3 and 0.04 cm3 cm−3. However, using soil specific calibration the
    accuracy can be significantly improved, reaching 0.01 cm3 cm−3 or even better.
    It should be noted that the above general figures may vary among the various sensors
    technologies and models. One of the most important aspects of studying soil moisture
    based drip irrigation scheduling schemes in the case of drip irrigation systems,
    is the determination of the soil moisture patterns formed under the emitter. Wetting
    patterns can be obtained either experimentally, which are case specific, or by
    simulation using suitable mathematical models. In most of these models, the Richards
    equation is used to simulate soil water matric potential or water content distribution
    during drip irrigation. Both numerical and analytical methods are used to solve
    the Richards flow equation (Elmaloglou et al., 2013). Several analytical solutions
    have been developed for the linearized form of the flow equation (Lomen and Warrick,
    1974, Warrick and Lomen, 1976, Ben-Asher et al., 1978). Chen et al. (2009) obtained
    a series of closed-form analytical solutions for the water content distribution
    during trickle irrigation under either a single line source flux or multiple line
    sources. However, the application of analytical solutions is limited given the
    various assumptions needed (Coelho and Or, 1996). Therefore, numerical simulation
    models are used more often to analyze soil water dynamics under surface drip irrigation
    (e.g. Šimůnek et al., 1999, Vrugt et al., 2001, Elmaloglou and Malamos, 2005,
    Šimůnek et al., 2006, Elmaloglou and Diamantopoulos, 2008a, Elmaloglou and Diamantopoulos,
    2008b, Diamantopoulos and Elmaloglou, 2012, Elmaloglou et al., 2013, Elmaloglou
    and Soulis, 2013). In a recent study Dabach et al. (2013) investigated irrigation
    scheduling by combining the results of HYDRUS 2D/3D simulations with experimental
    data for the case of matric head triggered drip irrigation systems in order to
    optimize their main operational parameters, i.e. irrigation thresholds and water
    amounts. In their study the merits of using numerical simulation models in studying
    sensor based irrigation management were highlighted as well. In this context the
    main objective of this study is to investigate how soil moisture sensors positioning
    and accuracy may affect the performance of soil moisture based surface drip irrigation
    scheduling systems under various conditions (soil types, potential evapotranspiration
    rates, discharge rates, irrigation depths, drip line spacing). For this purpose
    several numerical experiments were carried out using a mathematical model, which
    incorporates hysteresis in the soil water characteristic curve, evaporation from
    the soil surface, and water extraction by roots (Elmaloglou and Diamantopoulos,
    2008a, Elmaloglou et al., 2013). Furthermore, a system-dependent boundary condition
    was implemented into the mathematical model considering changing conditions in
    specific locations of the flow domain in order to simulate soil moisture based
    automated drip irrigation scheduling systems. 2. Materials and methods 2.1. The
    mathematical model In order to study how soil moisture sensor positioning and
    accuracy affects the performance of soil moisture based surface drip irrigation
    scheduling systems, the soil moisture patterns formed under the emitters for various
    conditions and various configurations of the studied system were determined using
    the mathematical model presented by Elmaloglou et al. (2013), which simulates
    soil water dynamics under surface drip irrigation from equidistance line sources.
    This mathematical model incorporates hysteresis in the soil water characteristic
    curve, evaporation from the soil surface, and water extraction by roots. Furthermore,
    due to the fact that the code of the model was developed in-house, it was possible
    to implement a system-dependent boundary condition considering changing conditions
    in specific locations of the flow domain, which correspond to the soil moisture
    sensors positions. In this manner it was made possible to simulate the operation
    of an automated soil moisture based drip irrigation scheduling system for several
    irrigation cycles. In Fig. 1a graphical representation of the three-dimensional
    physical model is illustrated. As it can be seen, surface drip irrigation is applied
    from horizontal line sources, of width 2x0. In the same figure, the laterals spacing,
    which in this study was selected equal to 60 cm and 80 cm, the crop rows, and
    the two-dimensional spatial distribution of the active root zone, are also shown.
    The width of the plant root system is minimal on the surface and increases with
    depth up to 20 cm, where it acquires its maximum width. Then the width is reduced
    up to 60 cm, which is equal to the root zone depth. The spatial distribution of
    the active root zone was selected to represent a normal rooting pattern for various
    crops suited by drip irrigation systems (e.g. beans, tomato, potato, cucumber,
    and other vegetable crops) (FAO, 1989, FAO, 1998, Machado and Oliveira, 2005).

    (a), and the discretization of the computational domain, which corresponds to
    the rectangle ABFE (b). This figure was created based on the corresponding figure
    presented by Elmaloglou et al. (2013). The plane flow symmetry allows for the
    physical model to be examined in one of the infinite vertical planes, which are
    perpendicular to the length of the line sources, and are determined from the x
    and z axes. In Fig. 1b, the discretization of the computational domain, which
    corresponds to the rectangle ABFE of Fig. 1a, is illustrated. The space steps
    Δx, Δz that were used for the numerical solution of the mathematical model were
    taken equal to 2 cm. The phenomenon of hysteresis in the soil water characteristic
    curve is incorporated in the mathematical model with the simplification made by
    Kool and Parker (1987) for the empirical model of Scott et al. (1983). More specifically,
    it was assumed that αd = αw/2, where aw and ad are the values of the a parameter
    in the relationship of van Genuchten (1980) for the main wetting and drying curve,
    as proposed by Kool and Parker (1987). Lastly, the mathematical model was successfully
    validated against an existing analytical solution and the Hydrus 2D numerical
    model as described in detail by Elmaloglou et al. (2013). 2.2. Simulation inputs
    In this study, the cases of two homogenous soil profiles consisting of loamy sand
    (LS) and silt (Si), respectively, were examined. The hydraulic properties of these
    soils were taken from the Rosetta database (Schaap and Leij, 1998). The soil hydraulic
    properties are modeled using the van Genuchten–Mualem constitutive relationships
    (Mualem, 1976, van Genuchten, 1980) as follows: (1) and (2) where Θs is the saturated
    water content (L3 L−3); Θr is the residual water content (L3 L−3); Ks is the saturated
    hydraulic conductivity (L T−1); and α (L−1), n (−), and m (−) are shape parameters.
    The Se is the effective saturation (dimensionless) (0 < Se < 1). The values of
    the parameters included in the van Genuchten equations are summarized in Table
    1. The unique K(Θ) relation for each soil type always follows from the parameter
    set (n, Θs, Θr, Ks) according to Eq. (2) (Kroes et al., 2008). The values of the
    initial volumetric water content Θi are 0.164 cm3 cm−3 for the loamy sand and
    0.198 cm3 cm−3 for the silt soil, respectively. The above values were chosen so
    that for time t = 0, both soils had the same value of effective saturation (Se
    = 33.7%). This Se value corresponds to initial hydraulic conductivity values small
    enough to minimize redistribution due to gravity. The corresponding pressure head
    values (−120 cm for the loamy sand and −756 cm for the silt soil) are well above
    the wilting point and are not related to significant crop water stress (water
    stress response according to Feddes et al. (1978), a(H) ≈ 1). More details can
    be found in Elmaloglou et al. (2013). Table 1. Values of the shape parameter (n),

    Dabach et al. (2013) demonstrated the effect of irrigation thresholds on the irrigation
    efficiency of matric head triggered irrigation systems. Therefore, test simulations
    with different Se values were also performed. These tests provided similar results,
    at least as related to the effect of sensor positioning and accuracy, which are
    the main topics of this study. The potential evapotranspiration rate at any time
    point (mm h−1) , is calculated by distributing the daily potential evapotranspiration
    (mm day−1) over a 24-h period (Vellidis and Smajstrla, 1992). A sinusoidal type
    distribution is used: (3) where is the period of the cycle (h), in this case 24
    h, and is the current time on the 24-h clock minus the beginning time of the cycle
    (h). Early in the growing season, soil evaporation is the highest part of the
    total evapotranspiration, but it gradually decreases as the plants grow and the
    canopy closes. However, even under a fully closed canopy, some soil evaporation
    occurs. In fully developed crops, transpiration is the dominant part of the total
    evapotranspiration, ranging between 80% and 90% of the latter (Bufon et al., 2012).
    The actual transpiration rate of a given crop is influenced by many factors, including
    crop type, soil and plant management practices, irrigation regime, climatic conditions,
    plant growth stage, plant genetic characteristics, leaf orientation, leaf age,
    etc. Accordingly, the daily potential evapotranspiration was partitioned into
    daily potential evaporation and daily potential transpiration , so that the ratio
    have a value around 0.14, which corresponds to average real conditions for a fully
    developed crop in semi-arid regions. In this study, two different potential evapotranspiration
    rates were investigated. The higher rate was selected to be equal to 8.4 mm day−1,
    which is an acceptable value for a fully developed crop in the dry period and
    in semi-arid regions. The lower value was selected to be equal to 4.2 mm day−1
    in order to test the effect of soil moisture sensors positioning and accuracy
    under intermediate conditions in comparison to the more extreme case of the higher
    potential evapotranspiration rate. 2.3. Numerical experiments As it was previously
    stated, recent progress in EM sensor technology promoted the broader application
    of automated irrigation scheduling using soil moisture sensing devices (Blonquist
    et al., 2006). Considering also the problems of matric head sensors that limited
    the wider application of automated irrigation scheduling up to now (Smajstrla
    and Koo, 1986, Dukes and Scholberg, 2005, Muñoz-Carpena et al., 2005), the case
    of soil moisture based automated irrigation scheduling is examined in this study.
    Furthermore, soil moisture triggered drip irrigation systems can be more consistently
    modelled through the implementation of a system-dependent boundary condition when
    hysteresis in the soil water characteristic curve is considered. In the case of
    matric head triggered drip irrigation systems the triggering matric head value
    corresponds to different soil moisture values in the drying and the wetting curves
    due to the phenomenon of hysteresis in the soil water characteristic curve, thus
    complicating the modelling of such systems. Soil water distribution under drip
    irrigation is mainly affected by the hydraulic properties of the soil, the drip
    lines discharge rate, the irrigation depth, the drip lines spacing and the root
    water uptake spatial and temporal distribution. As it was already mentioned above,
    two soil types (loamy sand and silt) and two potential evapotranspiration rates
    (8.4 and 4.2 mm day−1) were investigated. Furthermore, the effect of soil moisture
    sensors positioning and accuracy was investigated for two discharge rates (2 and
    4 l m−1 h−1), for two irrigation depths (30 and 40 mm), and for two laterals spacings
    (60 cm and 80 cm). Usually, soil moisture sensing devices were used to initiate
    a preset timed irrigation event; therefore, the irrigation event was stopped after
    a preprogrammed irrigation time (corresponding to a specific irrigation depth)
    rather than after specific soil moisture conditions were met (Phene and Howell,
    1984, Smajstrla and Koo, 1986, Clark et al., 1994, Torre-Neto et al., 2000, Dukes
    and Scholberg, 2005). For the above combinations corresponding to various conditions
    and irrigation system configurations, the effect of soil moisture sensors positioning
    was investigated by simulating the operation of an automated soil moisture based
    scheduling system and by calculating the corresponding irrigation efficiency for
    different sensor positions. The simulated sensor positions are illustrated in
    Fig. 1a. The various positions were selected to represent a wide range of possible
    sensor placement options including the most commonly used practices (Stieber and
    Shock, 1995, Coelho and Or, 1996, Schroder et al., 2005, Wang et al., 2012). As
    it was already mentioned, soil moisture sensors accuracy may also be an important
    factor affecting the efficiency of soil moisture sensor based irrigation scheduling
    systems. Therefore, in order to investigate the magnitude of sensors accuracy
    impact a final set of numerical experiments was carried out. In these numerical
    experiments two levels of sensor errors were examined. A higher error level was
    selected equal to ±0.03 cm3 cm−3 so as to correspond to the accuracy of most EM
    sensors using the factory calibration equations under normal conditions, while
    the lower error level was selected equal to ±0.01 cm3 cm−3 so as to correspond
    to the accuracy of most EM sensors using the soil specific calibration equations
    (Seyfried and Murdock, 2004, Kargas and Kerkides, 2008, Kizito et al., 2008, Parsons
    and Bandaranayake, 2008, Kargas and Soulis, 2012). In this approach the previously
    described combinations of conditions and irrigation system configurations were
    simulated supposing a systematic error of +0.03, −0.03, +0.01, and −0.01 cm3 cm−3.
    In total more than 200 numerical experiments were carried out. The main combinations
    investigated are presented in Table 2. Table 2. The main simulated cases for the
    investigated characteristics in the performed numerical experiments. Characteristic

    investigated, a period corresponding to eight irrigation cycles was simulated
    in order to diminish the influence of the initial conditions on the result obtained.
    The length of each irrigation cycle varied according to the various conditions
    (soil types, potential evapotranspiration rates, discharge rates, irrigation depths,
    drip line spacings) and the various sensor positions and accuracy values simulated
    and it ranged between 72 h and 120 h for = 8.4 mm day−1 and between 140 h and
    232 h for = 4.2 mm day−1. 3. Results and discussion 3.1. Suitable sensor positions
    The main parameters characterizing irrigation performance such as deep percolation,
    irrigation efficiency in terms of actual transpiration, and actual evaporation
    were calculated for each case investigated. In this process the variation of soil
    moisture below 60 cm plus the water drained out from the bottom boundary are considered
    as deep percolation. Furthermore, the irrigation efficiency is defined as the
    ratio of the depth of irrigation water that is beneficially used by the plants
    to the depth of irrigation water applied (On Farm Irrigation Committee, 1978,
    Irmak et al., 2011). The main results of the numerical experiments considering
    the high potential evapotranspiration rate of 8.4 mm day−1 and the high drip line
    discharge rate of 4 l m−1 h−1 are presented in Table 3, however, the following
    analysis is based on the results of all the numerical experiments described in
    Table 2. As it was expected, irrigation efficiency varies considerably according
    to the drip line spacing, the irrigation depth, and the soil type. More specifically,
    irrigation efficiency increases with decreasing drip line spacing (the observed
    difference ranges between about 2.7% and 8.8%) and with decreasing irrigation
    depth (the observed difference ranges between about 1.4% and 9.7%). As it can
    be also observed irrigation efficiency is lower for the coarse soil (loamy sand)
    in all cases studied due to the higher deep percolation losses. The above results
    are in agreement with results presented in other similar studies e.g. (Khan et
    al., 1996, Cote et al., 2003, Li et al., 2003, Souza and Matsura, 2003, Elmaloglou
    and Diamantopoulos, 2010, Selim et al., 2012, Elmaloglou et al., 2013). Furthermore,
    the observed differences in irrigation efficiency are more significant for the
    case of the coarse soil (loamy sand). By contrast, drip line discharge rate was
    found to have a limited effect on irrigation efficiency, therefore, only the results
    considering the high drip line discharge rate are presented in Table 3. Considering
    the main question of this study, which is related to the effect of soil moisture
    sensors positioning on irrigation efficiency, a notable variation of irrigation
    efficiency among the various positions investigated was observed. In many cases,
    this variation was greater than the variation among the various irrigation system
    configurations. As an example, the irrigation efficiency related to the various
    sensor positions in the case of the loamy sand soil, the 4 l m−1 h−1 discharge
    rate, the 30 mm irrigation depth, and the 60 cm drip line spacing ranged between
    89.7% (sensor position X = 11 cm, Z = 10 cm) and 73% (sensor position X = 1 cm,
    Z = 30 cm), while the irrigation efficiency related to the various irrigation
    system configurations for the loamy sand soil and for the more suitable sensor
    position (X = 11 cm, Z = 10 cm) ranged between 89.7% and 77.9%. The corresponding
    irrigation efficiency values for the case of the silt soil ranged between 93.7%
    and 78.7% and 93.7% and 86.4%, respectively. This observation highlights the importance
    of the proper positioning of the soil moisture sensors driving automated irrigation
    scheduling systems. However, when nearby sensor positions are examined, the observed
    differences are lower and in some cases they are negligible. Table 3. Sensor positions

    rate of 4 l m−1 h−1 and the high potential evapotranspiration rate of 8.4 mm day−1.

    so as to be compatible. The irrigation efficiency variations observed among the
    investigated sensor positions noticeably vary among the irrigation system configurations
    and soil types studied. In order to quantify this variability, the standard deviations
    of the irrigation efficiencies corresponding to the various sensor positions for
    each irrigation system configuration and soil type were calculated (Table 3).
    The calculated standard deviations ranged from 5.8% for the 4 l m−1 h−1 discharge
    rate, the 30 mm irrigation depth, the loamy sand soil, for both drip line spacings
    to 2.8% for the 2 l m−1 h−1 discharge rate, the 40 mm irrigation depth, for 60
    cm drip line spacing, for both soils. The higher standard deviations are observed
    in the case of the coarse soil (loamy sand) and especially for the case of the
    higher discharge rate. These observations may be attributed to the variation of
    the representativeness of the sensor readings according to its position, which
    is examined in more detail in the next section. Furthermore, higher standard deviations
    are related to conditions favoring the vertical movement of the wetting front
    through the soil profile e.g. coarse soils (Khan et al., 1996, Cote et al., 2003,
    Li et al., 2003, Souza and Matsura, 2003, Elmaloglou and Malamos, 2005, Elmaloglou
    and Diamantopoulos, 2010, Elmaloglou et al., 2013). Besides the above mentioned
    irrigation efficiency variability among the various cases studied, it was observed
    that the most suitable position was 11 cm from the drip line and 10 cm below the
    soil surface (X = 11 cm, Z = 10 cm) in all cases studied. Generally, sensor positions
    20 cm from the soil surface or deeper are related to noticeably lower irrigation
    efficiencies. When the sensors are positioned more deeply in the soil profile
    soil evaporation is reduced; however, this reduction cannot balance the increased
    deep percolation values due to increased soil water content values at the lower
    part of the root zone (Table 3), leading to more frequent irrigations. A characteristic
    example is presented in Fig. 2, where the soil water content spatial distribution
    patterns for a shallower (X = 11 cm, Z = 10 cm) and a deeper (X = 11 cm, Z = 30
    cm) sensor position for the case of the loamy sand soil, the 4 l m−1 h−1 discharge
    rate, the 30 mm irrigation depth, and the 60 cm drip line spacing, in three representative
    times (last irrigation cycle, ti = end of irrigation, tend just before irrigation,
    tmid in-between time) are illustrated. Furthermore, it was observed that sensor
    positions directly under the emitters are also linked to lower efficiencies (Table
    3). It should be noted that in tests carried out for positions further away from
    the drip line or deeper in the soil profile than the positions presented here,
    irrigation efficiency drops considerably. Download : Download full-size image

    (b) a deeper sensor position for the case of the loamy sand soil, the 4 l m−1
    h−1 discharge rate, the 30 mm irrigation depth, the 60 cm drip line spacing, and
    the high potential evapotranspiration rate of 8.4 mm day−1 in three representative
    times (last irrigation cycle, ti = end of irrigation, tend just before irrigation,
    tmid in-between time). The main conclusions obtained for the lower potential evapotranspiration
    rate of 4.2 mm day−1 were similar to that of the higher potential evapotranspiration
    rate analyzed above. However, irrigation efficiencies are generally lower in all
    cases due to higher deep percolation losses. As it was expected, soil evaporation
    is reduced due to the lower potential evapotranspiration rate; however these reductions
    are generally low. Finally, noticeable irrigation efficiency variations between
    the investigated sensor positions are still present, but the calculated standard
    deviation values are lower. 3.2. Representative sensor positions At a second step
    of analysis, it was investigated how soil moisture sensors positioning influences
    the representativeness of their readings regarding to the average soil water content
    in the root zone. In this analysis the readings of hypothetical soil moisture
    sensors located in several positions in the root zone were compared with the corresponding
    average soil water content in the root zone. The results obtained for the case
    of the 4 l m−1 h−1 discharge rate, the 30 mm irrigation depth, and the 80 cm drip
    line spacing for both soils studied and for both ETp rates are presented in Table
    4. As it can be clearly seen in this table, there is a considerable variability
    in the sensors’ representativeness according to their positioning. In the same
    table it can be seen that sensors’ representativeness may vary according to the
    soil hydraulic properties or the meteorological conditions. Additional numerical
    experiments data indicated that sensors’ representativeness may also vary according
    to the irrigation system configuration. This is an important finding as it highlights
    the significance of proper soil moisture sensors positioning according to each
    application''s requirements. This information could be proven valuable in irrigation
    management or in other applications requiring the monitoring of soil water content.
    The ability of computer models to serve as an efficient tool for the detailed
    investigation of sensors positioning schemes is a significant outcome as well.

    between the same hypothetical soil moisture sensors with the corresponding average
    soil water content in the root zone for the case of the 4 l m−1 h−1 discharge
    rate, the 30 mm irrigation depth, the 8.4 mm day−1 ETp rate, and the 60 cm drip
    line spacing for both studied soils is provided in Fig. 3. As it can be observed,
    in the case of loamy sand soil the most representative position was 11 cm from
    the drip line and 30 cm below the soil surface (X = 11 cm, Z = 30 cm). As it can
    be also observed, the readings of shallower sensor positions are characterized
    by steep rises and drops as they are influenced more directly by the soil surface
    conditions (irrigation, evapotranspiration), while conditions at the readings
    of deeper sensor positions are generally smoother. A similar behavior can be observed
    for the case of silt soil; however, in this case the most representative position
    was between the positions located 1 cm from the drip line and 20 cm below the
    soil surface and 11 cm from the drip line and 30 cm below the soil surface. Taking
    also into account the results for both soils presented in Table 4, it can be presumed
    that in conditions favoring slower water movement in the soil profile (e.g. finer
    soils or more uniform soil water content patterns) the most representative sensor
    positions are located nearer to the soil surface and to the plane of symmetry
    AE defined by the emitter (Fig. 1). A general observation considering the above
    results and the results regarding irrigation efficiency presented in the previous
    section is that in some cases the most representative sensor position is not necessarily
    linked to the best irrigation efficiency. As it was described in the previous
    section, deeper sensor positions are related to increased soil water content values
    at the lower part of the root zone. Therefore, in some cases that deep percolation
    is the most significant loss, the best irrigation efficiency is achieved for sensor
    positions a little higher than the most representative sensor position. On the
    other hand, irrigation efficiency is not the only decision parameter. As an example,
    crop stress as well as excessive irrigation may cause yield decreases relative
    to optimum irrigation amounts. Therefore, more representative sensor readings
    facilitate irrigation management as they provide more accurate information about
    the average conditions at the root zone. This observation highlights the complexity
    of the studied issue and the need for a detailed investigation for each particular
    application considering the specific conditions (e.g. soil, crop, irrigation system
    characteristics) and in relation to the applied irrigation management practices.

    4 l m−1 h−1 discharge rate, the 30 mm irrigation depth, the 8.4 mm day−1 ETp rate,
    and the 60 cm drip line spacing, for (a) the loamy sand soil, and (b) the silt
    soil (Only the last irrigation cycle is presented). In practice a great variety
    of soil moisture sensor types with different characteristics (e.g. volume of influence,
    measurement range, accuracy) and configurations (e.g. number of sensors, placement)
    are used (Stieber and Shock, 1995, Coelho and Or, 1996, Schroder et al., 2005,
    Dukes et al., 2007, Kim et al., 2009, Zotarelli et al., 2011, Wang et al., 2012,
    Miller et al., 2014). However, the above results highlight the need for a more
    detailed study for each specific case. Numerical modelling can be proven an additional
    valuable tool in this effort. 3.3. Sensor accuracy In order to investigate the
    sensors accuracy effect on the efficiency of soil moisture sensor based irrigation
    scheduling systems a set of numerical experiments was carried out assuming two
    levels of sensor errors as it was described in Section 2.3. The obtained results
    concerning the lower error level (±0.01 cm3 cm−3) indicated that there is a noticeable
    but generally limited effect. More specifically, the effect of this error level
    on irrigation efficiency ranged between 4.5% and 6.4% for the loamy sand soil
    and between 2.5% and 4.5% for the silt soil for the cases investigated. Similar
    results were obtained for the deep percolation and the evaporation losses. By
    contrast, more significant effects were observed in the case of the higher error
    level (±0.03 cm3 cm−3). More specifically, in the numerical experiments where
    the sensors underestimated soil water content by 0.03 cm3 cm−3 (i.e. the actual
    soil water contents were 0.03 cm3 cm−3 higher than the sensor readings), irrigation
    efficiency decrease varied between 15.7% and 18.7% for the loamy sand soil and
    between 10.2% and 12.9% for the silt soil for the cases investigated. On the contrary,
    in the numerical experiments where the sensors overestimated soil water content
    by 0.03 cm3 cm−3 (i.e. the actual soil water contents were 0.03 cm3 cm−3 lower
    than the sensor readings) deep percolation and soil evaporation losses dropped
    due to the lower soil water content values in the soil profile with positive results
    on irrigation efficiency. However, in this case, crop stress increased considerably
    (actual evapotranspiration to potential evapotranspiration ratios dropped) having
    as a possible effect serious crop production losses. Likewise, excessive irrigation
    may as well cause yield decreases relative to optimum irrigation amounts (Locascio
    et al., 1989, Sezen et al., 2006, Ngouajio et al., 2007). As an example, the soil
    water content spatial distribution patterns at the end of the final irrigation
    cycle for the case of the 4 l m−1 h−1 discharge rate, the 40 mm irrigation depth,
    the 60 cm drip line spacing, and the 8.4 mm day−1 ETp rate, for both soils studied
    are presented in Fig. 4 supposing a systematic error of +0.02 cm3 cm−3 (the actual
    soil water contents are 0.02 cm3 cm−3 higher than the sensor readings) and −0.02
    cm3 cm−3 (the actual soil water contents are 0.02 cm3 cm−3 lower than the sensor
    readings), which lies in-between the examined cases, in comparison to the standard
    case (no error). Download : Download full-size image Fig. 4. Illustration of the

    the 60 cm drip line spacing, and the 8.4 mm day−1 ETp rate, for (a) the loamy
    sand soil, and (b) the silt soil, supposing a systematic error of +0.02 cm3 cm−3
    and −0.02 cm3 cm−3 in comparison to the standard case (no error). It should be
    noted that error levels of about ±0.03 cm3 cm−3 are generally optimistic for many
    EM sensors using the factory calibration equations under normal conditions and
    in specific cases it may even be as high as ±0.05 cm3 cm−3 (Seyfried and Murdock,
    2004, Kargas and Kerkides, 2008, Kizito et al., 2008, Parsons and Bandaranayake,
    2008, Kargas and Soulis, 2012). Therefore, taking also into consideration the
    above results, it can be concluded that soil specific calibration of the EM sensors
    used in soil moisture based surface drip irrigation scheduling systems is a fundamental
    requirement. 4. Summary and conclusions In this study the effect of soil moisture
    sensors positioning and accuracy on the performance of soil moisture based surface
    drip irrigation scheduling systems under various conditions (soil types, potential
    evapotranspiration rates, discharge rates, irrigation depths) was investigated
    using a mathematical model, which incorporates hysteresis in the soil water characteristic
    curve, evaporation from the soil surface, and water extraction by roots. The use
    of a custom-made mathematical model allows the comparison of the obtained results
    with those of other similar models. Therefore, more reliable conclusions about
    important design and operation parameters of drip irrigation systems can be made.
    In addition, there is increased flexibility in the approach of the various irrigation
    problems due to the fact that the code of the model was developed in-house and
    therefore there is possibility for further development including the implementation
    of a system-dependent boundary condition into the mathematical model considering
    changing conditions in specific locations of the flow domain in order to be able
    to simulate soil moisture sensors based drip irrigation scheduling and to achieve
    the main goals of this study. The model was successfully validated against an
    existing analytical solution and the state of the art Hydrus 2D numerical model.
    The effect of soil moisture sensors positioning was investigated by simulating
    the operation of an automated soil moisture based scheduling system for a coarser
    and a finer soil, for a high and a low potential evapotranspiration rate, for
    two discharge rates, and for two irrigation depths. Furthermore, the effect of
    sensors accuracy was investigated for the same combinations of conditions and
    irrigation system configurations for two sensors accuracy levels. The results
    of the numerical experiments considering the effect of soil moisture sensors positioning
    on irrigation efficiency indicate that in many cases irrigation efficiency varies
    considerably among the different positions investigated. Furthermore, it was observed
    that in many cases, this variation was greater than the variation among the various
    irrigation system configurations. However, the observed irrigation efficiency
    variations for the investigated sensor positions noticeably differ for the irrigation
    system configurations and soil types studied. Generally, it was found that higher
    variations were related to conditions favoring the vertical movement of the wetting
    front through the soil profile. The above conclusions were valid for both potential
    evapotranspiration rates studied. However, irrigation efficiencies were generally
    lower in the case of the low potential evapotranspiration rate due to higher deep
    percolation losses. Furthermore, noticeable irrigation efficiency variations among
    the investigated sensor positions were observed for both potential evapotranspiration
    rates, but the variability is lower in the case of the low potential evapotranspiration
    rate. The above results highlight the significance of the proper positioning of
    the soil moisture sensors driving automated irrigation scheduling systems. Besides
    the above mentioned irrigation efficiency variability among the various cases
    studied, it was observed that the most suitable position was 11 cm from the drip
    line and 10 cm below the soil surface. Generally, sensor positions 20 cm from
    the soil surface or deeper were related to noticeably lower irrigation efficiencies.
    However, it should be noted that when nearby sensor positions were examined, the
    observed differences were generally low and in some cases negligible. When the
    influence of soil moisture sensors positioning on the representativeness of their
    readings regarding to the average soil water content in the root zone was considered,
    a clear effect was observed. It was also found that the effect of sensors positioning
    varies according to the soil hydraulic properties, the meteorological conditions,
    and the irrigation system configuration. These results further support the importance
    of proper soil moisture sensors positioning according to each application requirements
    (e.g. irrigation management or other applications requiring the monitoring of
    soil water content). Finally, concerning the effect of sensors accuracy on the
    efficiency of soil moisture sensor based irrigation scheduling systems, it was
    found that while the lower error level (±0.01 cm3 cm−3) had an obvious but generally
    limited effect (between 2.5% and 6.4%), the higher error level (±0.03 cm3 cm−3)
    had a critical effect (between 10.2% and 18.7%). Considering that error levels
    of about ±0.03 cm3 cm−3 are generally optimistic for many EM sensors using the
    factory calibration equations, the need of soil specific calibration of the EM
    sensors used in soil moisture based surface drip irrigation scheduling systems
    is highlighted. Concluding, the results of this study provide clear evidence that
    soil moisture sensors positioning and accuracy may considerably affect irrigation
    efficiency in soil moisture based drip irrigation scheduling systems. More importantly,
    it was found that sensor accuracy could be a critical factor for the successful
    implementation of soil moisture sensor based irrigation scheduling systems. It
    should be also noted that in this study the effects of sensor positioning and
    accuracy were separately investigated. Therefore, even in cases that the observed
    errors for each of these two factors were not important, the synergistic effect
    of both factors could be more important. It was also found that a detailed study
    taking into account the characteristics of specific crops, irrigation systems,
    scheduling systems, as well as soil moisture sensors will provide a sound basis
    for improved irrigation scheduling. Lastly, the ability of computer models to
    serve as an efficient tool for the detailed investigation of sensors positioning
    schemes or other automated scheduling system characteristics is a significant
    outcome of this study as well. Acknowledgements The authors wish to sincerely

    all metrics Abstract Because of the increasing worldwide shortage of freshwater
    and costs of irrigation, a new plant-based irrigation scheduling method is proposed.
    In this method, two real-time plant-based measurements (sap flow and stem diameter
    variations) are used in combination with a mathematical water flow and storage
    model in order to predict the stem water potential. The amount of required irrigation
    water is derived from a time integration of the sap flow profile, while the timing
    of the irrigation is controlled based on a reference value for the predicted stem
    water potential. This reference value is derived from the relationship between
    midday values of maximum photosynthesis rates and stem water potential. Since
    modelling is an important part of the proposed methodology, a thorough mathematical
    analysis (identifiability analysis) of the model was performed. This analysis
    showed that an initial (offline) model calibration was needed based on measurements
    of sap flow, stem diameter variation and stem water potential. Regarding irrigation
    scheduling, however, only sap flow and stem diameter variation measurements are
    needed for online simulation and daily model calibration. Model calibration is
    performed using a moving window of 4 days of past data of stem diameter variations.
    The research tool STACI (Software Tool for Automatic Control of Irrigation) was
    used to optimally combine the continuous measurements, the mathematical modelling
    and the real-time irrigation scheduling. The new methodology was successfully
    tested in a pilot-scale setup with young potted apple trees (Malus domestica Borkh)
    and its performance was critically evaluated. Similar content being viewed by

    Today, irrigation is the largest single consumer of water on the planet, accounting
    for about 20% of the total amount of freshwater consumed and about two-thirds
    of the total diverted for human uses (Fereres and Evans 2006). Given the increasing
    worldwide shortage of freshwater and costs of irrigation, there is an urgent need
    for improved, more accurate irrigation strategies to conserve water, minimize
    water wastage and to keep the associated costs down. These new irrigation strategies
    should provide agricultural and horticultural plants with an optimal amount of
    water at an optimal time instance. Initially, irrigation scheduling was developed
    to avoid plant drought stress. To this end, sensors to continuously monitor either
    soil moisture or plant water status have been proposed as tools for irrigation
    scheduling (e.g. Campbell and Campbell 1982; Jones 1990; Goldhamer et al. 1999;
    Goldhamer 2003; Jones 2004; Intrigliolo and Castel 2004). The strengths and weaknesses
    of each of the available irrigation approaches have been reviewed in detail by
    Jones (2004). Techniques for sensing plant drought responses have shown that a
    potential problem with traditional soil-water based approaches is that many plant
    physiological features respond directly to changes in water status in the plant
    tissues, rather than to changes in the bulk soil water content (or potential)
    (McCutchan and Shackel 1992; Jones 2004). Irrigation scheduling decisions based
    on soil moisture status are therefore less appropriate when, for instance, a certain
    level of plant water deficit is considered favourable when attempting to control
    the flow of carbohydrates to reproductive structures such as fruit (Chalmers et
    al. 1981; Fereres and Evans 2006; Naor 2006). As a result, it has been suggested
    that greater precision in the application of irrigation can be obtained by using
    plant-based measurements (e.g. Jones 1990; Jones 2004), which fits within the
    “speaking plant” approach (Udink ten Cate 1978). The use of the plant itself as
    an indicator of irrigation requirements implies a rigorous and sensitive measure
    of the plant water status. Various workers have proposed the use of the stem water
    potential (Ψ(stem)) as a robust and direct indicator of the plant water status,
    which can be of use in irrigation scheduling (e.g. Begg and Turner 1970; Garnier
    and Berger 1985; McCutchan and Shackel 1992; Naor et al. 1995, 1997; Shackel et
    al. 1997; Goldhamer 2003; Naor and Cohen 2003; Intrigliolo and Castel 2004; Doltra
    et al. 2007). However, the use of the classical pressure chamber method (Begg
    and Turner 1970; McCutchan and Shackel 1992) to determine Ψ(stem) is not suited
    for automatic irrigation scheduling or control, because of its destructive nature.
    Although it may be possible to use automated stem hygrometers (Dixon and Tyree
    1984), these instruments are notoriously unreliable in practice (Naor and Cohen
    2003; Jones 2004; Doltra et al. 2007), giving good data only in expert hands (Jones
    2007). Modelling the dynamics of Ψ(stem) based on continuously measured variables
    on the plant itself or in its microenvironment may serve as a good alternative
    to the tedious measurements of Ψ(stem). Such models are already available in scientific
    literature (e.g. Zweifel et al. 2001; Steppe et al. 2006), but their practical
    application in irrigation scheduling has not been exploited so far. The main objective
    of this paper is to present a newly developed methodology for plant-based irrigation
    scheduling. The proposed methodology predicts when and how much water is required
    by the plant based on modelling stem water potential and continuous measurements
    of sap flow and stem diameter variations. In contrast to earlier studies, sensors
    for continuous plant-based monitoring are not used as alternatives for direct
    water status measurements or to directly sense the plant response to water deficit,
    but are used in combination with a mechanistic water flow and storage model to
    predict the dynamic behaviour of Ψ(stem). The paper highlights how the water flow
    and storage model, which was originally developed to gain new scientific insight
    in the functioning of the stem diameter, is combined with continuously measured
    sap flow rates and stem diameter variations to predict the amount of water required
    by the plant as well as the timing for irrigation using modelled Ψ(stem). Initial
    model calibration and determination of a critical threshold of Ψ(stem) pertinent
    to the successful use of the methodology are also described. Application of the
    proposed irrigation methodology is assessed in a pilot-scale setup with young
    potted apple trees (Malus domestica Borkh). Materials and methods Plant material
    and pilot-scale setup The new plant-based irrigation scheduling system was tested
    in a pilot-scale setup in the greenhouse facilities of the Faculty of Bioscience
    Engineering of Ghent University, Belgium, from August 20 till September 6 2006
    (Day of Year, DOY, 232–249). A young apple tree (Malus domestica Borkh ‘Cox Orange’
    grafted on ‘Malus M26’ rootstock) with a stem diameter of 25.6 mm and a height
    of ∼2 m was used as test plant. The selected apple tree was part of a batch of
    apple trees, which were grown outdoors and transplanted in 50-L containers (0.4
    m diameter × 0.4 m height) at the beginning of March 2006 when freezing ended.
    The containers were filled with a mixture of fine (45%) and coarse (40%) white
    peat, complemented with black peat fibres (15%) and fertilized with a NPK plus
    magnesium mix (Basacote Plus 6 M, COMPO Benelux, Belgium). The soil surface was
    covered with mulch (10–20 mm pieces of fir bark, DCM, Grobbendonk, Belgium) in
    order to prevent possible soil evaporation losses. Microclimate and plant measurements
    Microclimate and soil measurements Photosynthetic active radiation (PAR) was measured
    with a quantum sensor (Li-190 S, Li-COR, Lincoln, NE, USA) in the greenhouse above
    the treetops. Air temperature (T a) was recorded with a copper-constantan thermocouple
    (Omega, Amstelveen, The Netherlands), installed at a height of 1.5 m, between
    the trees. Relative humidity of the air (RH) was measured with a capacitive RH
    sensor (Type HIH-3605-A, Honeywell, Morristown, NJ, USA) at the same height of
    the thermocouple. Both the RH sensor and the thermocouple were mounted in a radiation
    shield. Soil water potential (Ψ(soil)) in the container of the test tree was monitored
    with an electronic tensiometer (Type SWT4, Delta-T Devices, Cambridge, UK) at
    a depth of 15 cm. Plant measurements Continuous measurements of sap flow rate
    and stem diameter variation, which are required for the proposed irrigation scheduling
    methodology to work, were acquired every 20 s with a data-acquisition system (HP75000
    Series B, Hewlett Packard, USA) and were stored as 5-min mean values in a database.
    The sap flow measurements served as model input to simulate Ψ(stem), while the
    stem diameter variation measurements were used to calibrate the water flow and
    storage model (see below). Sap flow rates (F(stem)) were measured continuously
    at the base of the stem (∼30 cm above the soil) with a Dynagage sap flow sensor
    (Model SGB19-WS, Dynamax Inc., Houston, TX, USA), and was installed according
    to the operation manual (van Bavel and van Bavel 1990). Variations in stem diameter
    (D) were measured continuously with a linear variable displacement transducer
    (LVDT) (Model LBB 375-PA-100 and transducer bridge 8C-35, Schaevitz, Hampton,
    VA, USA). The LVDT-sensor was placed ∼5 cm below the sap flow sensor and was attached
    to the stem with a custom-made stainless steel holder. Stem water potential (Ψ(stem))
    was measured destructively with a pressure chamber (PMS Instrument Company, Corvallis,
    OR, USA). Mature leaves, close to the trunk, were enclosed in black plastic bags
    covered with aluminium foil at least two hours prior to the measurements (Begg
    and Turner 1970; McCutchan and Shackel 1992). On selected days, Ψ(stem) was measured
    hourly between 10 a.m. and 7 p.m. on two leaves each time. These measurements
    were used for initial model calibration or validation purposes (see below). Determination
    of a critical threshold or reference value The use of Ψ(stem) as steering variable
    in the proposed irrigation scheduling methodology requires the definition of a
    critical reference or threshold value (Ψc(stem)), beyond which irrigation is necessary.
    To determine Ψc(stem), an experiment was conducted from August 4–15 on two other
    potted apple trees selected from the batch in order to establish the response
    of maximum photosynthesis rate (P n(max)) to Ψ(stem). One of the selected trees
    was subjected to drought stress (non-irrigated treatment), while the other tree
    was kept well watered (irrigated treatment). Midday measurements of Ψ(stem) and
    P n(max) were carried out daily in both trees. P n(max) was measured with a portable
    gas exchange system (LI-6400, Li-COR, Lincoln, NE, USA). Sampling was always done
    on the same four selected leaves per tree. Simulation model A simplified version
    of the mechanistic water flow and storage model ‘RCGro’, developed by Steppe et
    al. (2006), was applied to simulate changes in Ψ(stem) (Fig. 1). Since this is
    the model’s primary use, the original ‘RCGro’ model with a crown and stem compartment
    could be simplified into a model that only describes the processes occurring in
    the stem compartment. This simplified model enables simulation of tree sap flow
    dynamics (water transport submodel), which are directly linked to variation in
    stem diameter D (stem diameter variation submodel), using the radial flow of water
    f(stem) (see Fig. 1) between the xylem and the stem storage compartment (i.e.
    the living, extensible cells external to the xylem). This radial flow can contribute
    to the vertical upwards sap flow because of the hydraulic connection R s between
    stored water and xylem water (Simonneau et al. 1993; Zweifel et al. 2001; Zweifel
    and Häsler 2001; Génard et al. 2001; Steppe and Lemeur 2004) and is driven by
    the water potential difference between xylem and bark. Continuously measured sap
    flow rate in the stem (F(stem)) is used as input to the model, and is modelled
    as the algebraic difference between direct root water uptake F(soil) and f(stem).
    F(soil) is described as the water potential difference in the xylem (Ψ(soil) −
    Ψ(stem)) across a hydraulic resistance R x. The radial flow between stem storage
    and xylem causes changes in stem water content, in capacitance C(stem), and hence
    in turgor. D varies due to reversible stem shrinkage/swelling and irreversible
    radial stem growth. If turgor is smaller than the threshold value at which wall
    yielding occurs (Γ), then variations in D only reflect reversible shrinkage/swelling.
    If turgor is larger than Γ, then irreversible radial stem growth occurs according
    to Lockhart’s (1965) equation, in addition to shrinkage/swelling (Fig. 1). This
    radial stem growth is proportional to the extensibility (ϕ) of the cell walls.
    For a detailed description of the model see Steppe et al. (2006). Model simulations
    were performed with a variable step size integrator (Press et al. 1992). Fig.
    1 Scheme and mathematical equations of the water flow and storage model used for
    plant-based irrigation scheduling. The model is driven by the stem sap flow rate
    F(stem). The stem of diameter D is modelled by two coaxial cylinders (xylem and
    stem storage compartment, respectively) separated by a membrane. The radial flow
    rate into and out of the stem storage compartment is represented by f(stem). This
    radial water flow (bold arrow) establishes the direct link between the submodel
    for calculating dynamic water transport and the submodel for predicting stem diameter
    variations. Depending on the value of the pressure potential in the stem storage
    compartment, the stem diameter variation resulting from growth is also included.

    Full size image Newly developed plant-based irrigation scheduling methodology
    Up till now, plant-based irrigation methods are limited in the sense that they
    only provide information on whether irrigation is needed (Jones 2004). The proposed
    irrigation-scheduling algorithm aims at determining “how much” irrigation to apply
    and “when” it should be applied. The methodology involves several steps, which
    are outlined below and summarized in Fig. 2. Fig. 2 Scheme of the plant-based
    irrigation scheduling methodology. An initial model calibration based on measurements
    of the stem diameter variation (D), complemented with additional (destructive)
    measurements of the stem water potential (Ψ(stem)), is required prior to the start
    of the online irrigation control in order to unambiguously estimate the parameter
    subset {ϕ, R s, R x, C(stem)} (a, b) (see text for details). A moving window of
    past data (a) is used for daily model recalibration in order to assure a good
    model fit at all times. During online irrigation control, simulated Ψ(stem) is
    continuously compared to the critical reference value (determined from a drought
    experiment, Fig. 6) in order to determine when an irrigation event should be applied
    (b), and the required amount of irrigation water is determined by time integration
    of the measured sap flow pattern (F(stem)) (c) Full size image When to irrigate
    The model was used to simulate changes in Ψ(stem) using 5-min mean values of F(stem)
    as model input. Modelled values of Ψ(stem) were continuously compared to the reference
    value Ψc(stem). An irrigation event started when Ψ(stem) exceeded Ψc(stem) (see
    Fig. 2b). A time delay of 30 min between two consecutive irrigation events was
    included in the algorithm in order to deal with the possible delayed reaction
    of the plant on the irrigation event. How much to irrigate Information on “how
    much” water to apply during an irrigation event was determined from the measured
    sap flow profile by cumulating the amount of water that is used by the plant between
    the previous and current time where simulated Ψ(stem) exceeds Ψc(stem) (Fig. 2c).
    A safety factor of 10% was used to slightly increase the calculated amount of
    irrigation water to supply in order to deal with possible sap flow measurement
    errors (van Bavel and van Bavel 1990). This corrected amount was supplied to the
    plant at each irrigation event (see Fig. 2b). Upon detection of an irrigation
    requirement, a 2/2 way solenoid valve (Type 6213, Bürkert, Ingelfingen, Germany)
    was triggered to supply the required irrigation amount at a preset flow rate of
    1.23 L min−1. Initial model calibration An identifiability analysis of the model
    (see De Pauw et al. 2008) showed that Ψ(stem) is influenced by three identifiable
    key parameters: R s, R x and C(stem), with R x being the most influential. A model
    parameter is said to be identifiable if it has sufficient influence on the model
    output (high sensitivity) and at the same time is not correlated with other model
    parameters (no linear dependencies with other model parameters) (De Pauw et al.
    2008). Since simulations of Ψ(stem) are used as steering variable for irrigation
    control, these parameters need to be assigned a correct value in order for the
    predictions of Ψ(stem) to be valid. To assess whether measurements of D are sufficient
    to assign unique values to these parameters during model calibration, an identifiability
    analysis of the D variable of the model was performed. This analysis showed that
    for measurements of D, the parameter sets {ϕ, R s, R x} or {ϕ, R s, C(stem)} are
    identifiable. Measurements of D can thus be used to assign unique values to the
    key parameters driving Ψ(stem), and can also be used to obtain a unique value
    for ϕ, although not strictly necessary for a correct prediction of Ψ(stem). Notice,
    however, that R x and C(stem) cannot be both identified from measurements of D
    alone since they are highly correlated. Indeed, a change in D caused by a change
    in C(stem) can be completely compensated by a change in R x and vice versa. Therefore,
    the use of measurements of D alone is not sufficient to unambiguously estimate
    the parameters, which determine the behaviour of the modelled Ψ(stem). Hence,
    an initial model calibration based on measurements of both D and Ψ(stem) (Fig.
    2a, b) is required prior to the start of the online irrigation control. Several
    days of D measurements, complemented with additional measurements of Ψ(stem) around
    midday allow unambiguous estimation of ϕ, R s, R x and C(stem). Based on the results
    of this calibration, a correct unique value can be assigned to C(stem) and further
    estimation of ϕ, R s and R x can be conducted during the irrigation control experiment
    based on measurements of D only. Online model calibration At first sight, one
    might be tempted to only perform the initial model calibration and keep all parameters
    fixed throughout the irrigation control experiment. However, this proved impossible.
    Figure 3 shows a typical model simulation of D with a fixed parameter set. With
    fixed parameters, the model is unable to predict the actual irreversible radial
    stem growth in the long term. The model is not longer valid after ∼4 days due
    to a temporal variability of some of the model parameters (Steppe 2004). Indeed,
    it seems logical to assume that some physiological characteristics of the plant
    (e.g. R x, ϕ) do not remain constant throughout the growing season (e.g. Steppe
    2004, Lechaudel et al. 2007). Since such time-dependencies are not incorporated
    in the model, a need for online model recalibration presents itself. Fig. 3 Typical
    model simulation of the stem diameter variation (D) with: (1) a fixed parameter
    set, obtained after model calibration based on the first four measurement days
    (Simulation 1), and (2) a daily recalibrated parameter set, based on a moving
    calibration window of 4 days of past data (Simulation 2) Full size image Measurements
    of D were used for sequential online model recalibration. The parameter subset
    {ϕ, R x, R s} was adjusted daily at 4 am so as to fit D using a moving time window
    of 4 days of previous data. Adjustment of the model parameters was done based
    on the minimization of the sum of squared errors between the simulated values
    and the measured data of variations in D of the four past days. This search for
    new parameter values was performed using the automated search algorithm Simplex
    (Nelder and Mead 1965). At each calibration event the Simplex method used the
    previously calibrated parameter values as initial values from where an automatic
    search for new parameters started. The newly calibrated parameter values were
    used with a time delay of 1 day. This time delay was deliberately introduced in
    the algorithm to give the user a chance to verify the model calibrations offline
    and, when irregularities were observed, to take appropriate action by correcting
    the parameter values. STACI: Software tool for automatic control of irrigation
    A research tool, STACI (Software Tool for Automatic Control of Irrigation) was
    used as the framework for combining the online measurements of F(stem) and D with
    the model to allow (1) online simulation of Ψ(stem), (2) online model calibration
    and (3) real-time plant-based irrigation scheduling (Fig. 4). Fig. 4 Scheme of
    the research tool STACI (Software Tool for Automatic Control of Irrigation), enabling
    (1) continuous measurements of F(stem) and D, (2) online simulation of Ψ(stem),
    (3) online model calibration and (4) real-time plant-based irrigation scheduling
    Full size image Results Initial model calibration The initial model calibration
    was performed offline, prior to the start of the irrigation experiment, using
    a 3-day dataset of D and a daily pattern of hourly measured Ψ(stem) (Fig. 5).
    A unique value could be successfully assigned to the model parameter subset {C(stem),
    R s, R x, ϕ} (Table 1). C(stem) was fixed to this value for the remainder of the
    irrigation experiment. This was necessary to facilitate and to allow estimation
    of the remaining parameter subset {ϕ, R s, R x} during online calibration of the
    model for which only D measurements were available. The reason why C(stem) was
    fixed, and not R x, is the strong sensitivity of both Ψ(stem) and D to R x, meaning
    that a change in R x will strongly affect simulation of both Ψ(stem) and D, whereas
    this was less the case for C(stem). It was observed that greater parameter values
    of R x corresponded with greater maximum daily stem shrinkages and lower Ψ(stem)
    values. Fig. 5 Initial model calibration showing the comparison between a measured
    and simulated stem diameter variation (D), and b measured and simulated stem water
    potential (Ψ(stem)). Initial model calibration was performed prior to the start
    of the irrigation experiment, using a 3-day dataset of D measurements, complemented

    The response of P n(max) to Ψ(stem) obtained in an irrigated and a non-irrigated
    apple tree was used to define the reference value for Ψ(stem) beyond which irrigation
    was necessary. This response was well-described by a sigmoidal function (R 2 =
    0.973) for the non-irrigated tree (Fig. 6). Intersection of the mean P n(max)
    of the irrigated apple tree (14.6 μmol m−2 s−1) with this sigmoidal trajectory
    resulted in a reference value of −1 MPa, which was further used in the plant-based
    irrigation scheduling. Fig. 6 Typical relationship between maximum photosynthesis

    of the control tree, which intersects with the sigmoidal trajectory of the drought-stressed

    was performed using D measurements and a moving time window of 4 days of past
    data (Fig. 7b). The use of this 4-day moving window implied that a 4-day dataset
    of D measurements needed to be acquired before the first online model calibration
    (on DOY 240) could be performed. Since newly calibrated parameter values were
    used with a time delay of 1 day in the model, Ψ(stem) was simulated the first
    5 days of the experiment with the parameter values obtained during the initial
    model calibration (Fig. 8). Fig. 7 Daily patterns of a measured stem sap flow
    rate (F(stem)) and b stem diameter variation (D) of the potted apple tree across
    the 14-day online irrigation experiment. Model simulations of D were obtained
    with the daily recalibrated model parameter subset (see Fig. 8). Model recalibration
    was performed with a moving window of 4 days of past data. Time is expressed in
    hours (bottom axis) and in Day of Year (DOY, top axis) Full size image Fig. 8

    recalibration was performed on DOY 240, and newly calibrated parameter values
    were used in subsequent model simulations with a time delay of 1 day Full size
    image From DOY 240 on, a daily online model recalibration took place at 4 am,
    but the obtained values were only used the next day at 4 am. This time delay caused
    a decreased responsiveness of the model, which, for instance, can be seen in the
    overestimation of D during the night (e.g. DOY 241, Fig. 7b). Another consequence
    of the incorporated time delay is that steeper shrinkages of the tree stem (e.g.
    DOY 244, Fig. 7b), which are expected to result in higher R x values (Fig. 8b)
    and, thus, more negative Ψ(stem) values (according to the electrical analogon
    model), are only picked up with a certain time delay, affecting the performance
    of the proposed methodology. Besides removal of this time delay, the model’s responsiveness
    and accuracy, particularly during stress conditions (DOY 244/245, Fig. 7b), can
    also be improved by including measurements of Ψ(soil) as an extra input into the
    model, as is discussed below. Daily model recalibration showed variation in both
    the hydraulic resistance parameter values R x and R s (Fig. 8b, c) and in the
    estimated cell wall extensibility ϕ (Fig. 8a). This online adaptation of the parameter
    values was needed to assure a good model fit at all times (Fig. 7b). Plant-based
    irrigation scheduling Modelled Ψ(stem) was continuously compared to Ψc(stem) (initially
    defined at −1 MPa, see Fig. 6) to detect whether irrigation was necessary (Fig.
    9a). Upon detection of an irrigation event, the calculated amount of water (corrected
    cumulative plant water uptake since the last irrigation event, Fig. 7a) was supplied
    and a waiting time of 30 min was maintained before executing a new event when
    Ψ(stem) was still below the threshold value (Figs. 9a, 10a). Measurements of Ψ(soil)
    confirmed that the supply of water was really effectuated (Fig. 10b) and measured
    Ψ(stem) showed the validity of the method (Fig. 11a). However, due to less demanding
    atmospheric conditions on DOY 242–245 (data not shown), Ψ(stem) did not reach
    the critical threshold value and irrigation was withheld during these days, resulting
    in lowered soil water potentials (Fig. 9b). This might suggest that reference
    or threshold values should be standardized to the evaporative conditions in order
    to be successful, but more research on this topic is needed. A drought stress
    in the irrigated tree was feared, because measured D shrinkages apparently increased
    on DOY 244 and 245 (Fig. 7b). Based on these apparent stress indications, it was
    decided to induce an irrigation event on DOY 245 and to increase the threshold
    value of Ψ(stem) to −0.6 MPa (Fig. 9a). This value corresponds with the upper
    limit of the range of threshold values reported by Doltra et al. (2007) for apple
    trees. On DOY 245, the irrigated apple tree received the amount of water that
    had been accumulated during the previous 4 days (5.4 L in total) (Fig. 9b). With
    this higher threshold setting of Ψ(stem), the tree was watered daily at several
    time instances and validation of Ψ(stem) with offline measurements again confirmed
    a proper performance of the method and realistic model predictions (Fig. 11b).

    Full size image Discussion The potential use of mechanistic models in practice
    The main purpose of mechanistic plant models (like the one presented by Steppe
    et al. 2006) has been to integrate detailed knowledge as well as to gain new scientific
    insight and to increase the understanding of plant functioning, but their practical
    application in irrigation scheduling has not been exploited so far due to implementation
    issues, difficulties with selecting the identifiable key model parameters, or
    temporal variability issues of certain model parameters. However, this paper argues
    that these issues, inherently related to mechanistic models, should no longer
    constitute a problem due to progress made in mathematical modelling and computer
    technology. A thorough mathematical analysis of the model (according to De Pauw
    et al. 2008) allowed selecting the identifiable model parameters and the newly
    developed research tool STACI helped in solving the implementation issues as well
    as the problems related to temporal variability of the model parameters. This
    highlights that also explanatory mechanistic models (like the one presented in
    this paper) provide a possibility to successfully control and manage the plant
    health status and the environment around the plant, although argued otherwise
    by Lentz (1998). Moving window size and frequency of online model calibration
    An issue that has to be considered when performing online model calibrations is
    the selection of a moving window size, since this setting strongly influences
    the responsiveness of the model. For a successful application of the mechanistic
    model, it was of importance to seek a moving window size that assured an appropriate
    balance between (1) model responsiveness and (2) stability of the model parameters
    when varying microclimatic conditions presented themselves. As temporal variability
    of some of the model parameters existed (Fig. 8), the use of very large moving
    window sizes was prohibited. On the other hand, a too small moving window size
    would make the system too responsive to rapidly changing microclimatic conditions.
    Therefore, a moving window of medium size (i.e. 4 days) was selected in the present
    study. This size prevents unrealistic parameter estimates and model predictions
    in situations with alternating cloudy and sunny days. However, further research
    is needed in order to obtain more extensive information on the optimum window
    size. Another important issue that needs to be addressed is the required frequency
    of model calibrations. The relative short computational time needed to calibrate
    the model (less than 5 minutes) could allow recalibration at a high frequency.
    But because values of the parameters {R x, R s, ϕ} are not expected to change
    on a very short time scale, the choice of one calibration per day (at 4 am) seemed
    appropriate for the proposed application. Daily model recalibration showed temporal
    variation in the model parameter values. While the hydraulic resistance parameter
    values (Fig. 8b, c) showed a slight day-to-day variation due to the sensitivity
    of D to environmental conditions, a clear decrease in estimated cell wall extensibility
    ϕ was observed (Fig. 8a). This decrease was caused by the decrease in radial stem
    growth across the experimental period (Fig. 7b), which was selected near the end
    of the growing season. A correlation between the decrease in ϕ and the cessation
    of growth has also been reported elsewhere (Büntemeyer et al. 1998, Proseus et
    al. 1999; Lechaudel et al. 2007). Note that daily estimates of ϕ, R s and R x
    are conditional on the fixed values of the other model parameters (Table 1). The
    three identifiable key parameters capture all the day-to-day variation in D, but
    it is not unlikely that some of this variation is also caused by changes in other
    tree characteristics, whose parameter values were fixed during model calibrations.
    Absolute values of the model parameters in Fig. 8 should therefore be interpreted
    with care. Critical reference value As with other irrigation scheduling protocols,
    our proposed methodology also requires the definition of a critical reference
    value, beyond which irrigation is necessary. Such critical reference values are
    commonly determined for plants growing under non-limiting soil water supply (Fereres
    and Goldhamer 2003; Jones 2004). Tentative reference or threshold values for well-watered
    fruit trees range between −0.5 and −1.5 MPa (McCutchan and Shackel 1992; Shackel
    et al. 1997; Naor and Cohen 2003; Intrigliolo and Castel 2004, 2005; Ortuño et
    al. 2006; Doltra et al. 2007). Although these trees were watered well, the obtained
    reference values showed variations due to correlation with vapour pressure deficit
    (e.g., Shackel et al. 1997; Intrigliolo and Castel 2004). Instead of relying only
    on non-limiting soil water supply, we proposed a reference value (Fig. 6) that
    also sustained optimum photosynthesis activity (Patakas et al. 2005). This approach
    allowed estimation of a critical reference value above which photosynthesis was
    unaffected by water status. Note, however, that by selecting another (lower) reference
    value from the trajectory (Fig. 6), a certain level of stress could be maintained
    in order to positively influence, for instance, the quality of the harvested produce
    (Fereres and Evans 2006). If canopy growth is considered, a higher reference value
    should be selected from the trajectory, since extensive growth will decrease before
    stomatal conductance decreases. Obtaining extensive information on the behaviour
    of the critical reference value with changing environmental conditions or plant
    age still remains an important stage in the further development and validation
    of the method (Jones 2004). Indeed, a decrease in plant water potential during
    the season, even under non-limiting soil water conditions, is not uncommon (Fereres
    et al. 1978; McCutchan and Shackel 1992; Goldhamer and Fereres 2001). Osmotic
    adjustment across the season might explain this observed trend in water potential.
    The variability of the critical reference value, which might be expected to change
    within a tree across the growing season and with tree age, as well as the variability
    among individual trees, should therefore be further investigated. However, for
    the short-term irrigation experiment performed here, we feel that this effect
    might be neglected. Plant-based irrigation scheduling The use of a mathematical
    model in combination with continuous plant-based measurements is innovative in
    the sense that it allows accurate prediction of Ψ(stem); a variable, which is
    still difficult to measure continuously, but which is interesting for steering
    purposes. Prediction of Ψ(stem) with the model was very successful under non-stressed
    conditions (Fig. 11). Comparison of modelled and measured Ψ(stem) under non-stressed
    conditions also revealed that the actual daily minimum water status was lacking
    in the datasets obtained with the pressure chamber due to the discrete measurement
    frequency. Care should therefore be taken when irrigation is scheduled on the
    basis of daily measured midday Ψ(stem). It might be possible that such instantaneous
    measured values underestimate the actual plant water status; a problem, which
    might be resolved when being able to model Ψ(stem) accurately in real-time (Fig.
    9a). Despite the very good predictions of Ψ(stem) under non-stressed conditions,
    the expected reduction in Ψ(stem) (Fig. 9a) in response to a significant decrease
    in Ψ(soil) (up to −0.06 MPa) (Fig. 9b) was not observed. Measured D, unlike predicted
    D, was in agreement with the decrease in Ψ(soil) (Fig. 7b). This suggests that
    model predictions of D and Ψ(stem) failed under stressed conditions. This failure
    can, however, be resolved by using continuous measurements of Ψ(soil) as an additional
    input variable to the model, as has been demonstrated by De Pauw et al. (2008).
    As drought stress was feared given the significant decrease in Ψ(soil) (Fig. 9b),
    irrigation was forced on DOY 245 and the reference value increased (Fig. 9a).
    Although an enhanced stem growth was expected following this action of forced
    irrigation (Daudet et al. 2005), no clear effect was observed (Fig. 7b). This
    lack in stem growth response suggests that no severe drought stress had occurred
    on DOY 244 and 245. It is also noteworthy that, in case no forced irrigation had
    been performed, the online model calibration with D measurements with steeper
    stem shrinkages would eventually have resulted in higher R x values, which, in
    turn, would have led to predicted Ψ(stem) values beyond the critical threshold
    value and, hence, an irrigation event. These interdependencies in the model (between
    maximum daily stem shrinkage, R x and Ψ(stem)) suggest that the developed plant-based
    irrigation-scheduling tool is a self-regulating system, of which the opportunities
    should be further investigated. To do so, the model should be carefully tested
    and validated under a wide range of vapour pressure deficits and during the development
    of drought stress, possibly after including Ψ(soil) as an extra input variable
    to the model. The small-scale setup with the potted apple tree illustrates the
    first successful test of the methodology. For real practical applications, it
    seems likely that several plants will have to be monitored simultaneously and
    irrigation scheduled based on the average response of these plants. However, further
    research is needed to assess the number of required plants, which will certainly
    be influenced by the variability within the crop needing irrigation, but probably
    also by sensor costs and other economical factors. Other further challenges are
    to examine commercial-sized trees, the validity of the model across the season,
    given that the relationship between Ψ(stem) and maximum daily stem shrinkage changes,
    and the effect of crop load, since crop load directly affects maximum daily stem
    shrinkage. These assessments were, however, beyond the scope of the present paper.
    Conclusions This paper has described a new precision irrigation scheduling system
    that takes the irrigation needs (when and how much) of the individual plant into
    account. In contrast to previous studies using plant-based stress sensing as the
    basis for irrigation scheduling, plant-based measurements were fed into a mathematical
    flow and storage model in order to continuously predict Ψ(stem). The method was
    successfully validated with direct measurements of Ψ(stem) and was able to capture
    the diurnal fluctuations in Ψ(stem) with high temporal resolution. This paper
    has also highlighted the importance of performing a comprehensive model analysis.
    It is obvious that a proper model description is necessary, but even more important,
    and still often ignored, is identifying the strengths and weaknesses of the model.
    An identifiability analysis, for instance, is a prerequisite for the selection
    of the parameter subset that can be unambiguously estimated during model calibration
    from the available measurements. In our application, the identifiability analysis
    also highlighted the need for an initial model calibration. Furthermore, it has
    been discussed that the plant-based irrigation approach requires the definition
    of a critical reference value, beyond which irrigation is necessary. A method
    to determine reference values has been proposed, but further research is required
    to obtain information on the variability of these values as environmental conditions
    or plant age change. The test of the proposed methodology in a pilot-scale setup
    with a young potted apple tree showed an accurate performance under non-stressed
    conditions, but suggested that the model should be adapted with measurements of
    Ψ(soil) as an extra input to deal with stressed conditions. It is our belief that
    external pressures for enhanced irrigation systems, with a greater relevance to
    plant functioning, are likely to provide a real impetus for this new generation
    of irrigation strategies which use plant-based measurements and mathematical models,
    especially in the intensive horticultural, protected cropping, sector. References

  explanation: The study by Elnemr et al. (2019) investigated the optimal sensor placement
    for real-time irrigation management systems. Using a fiberglass box filled with
    soil, they simulated a root zone and measured soil moisture content (SMC) distribution
    under different flow rates and investigation periods to determine the optimal
    position of a calibrated sensor. The study found that sensor placement should
    vary based on soil type, flow rate, and investigation period to achieve highly
    efficient and water-saving irrigation practices.

    \ \nABSTRACT \nMoisture sensing devices are considered the main element to reach\
    \ better \nirrigation management especially for irrigation systems that are based\
    \ on \nautomatic control. Moisture devices location accuracy may affect the \n\
    accuracy of their sent data which will lead to a poor performance under \nvarious\
    \ operating conditions and consequently, affect irrigation efficiency \nthat affects\
    \ dependency on water productivity and thus, water use energy \nefficiency. For\
    \ this purpose, a lab experiment was carried out using a \nfiberglass box (100\
    \ x 100 x 20 cm) and digital moisture meter (SKZ-\nDM300L), 2 digits accuracy\
    \ to determine the optimal position of a \ncalibrated moisture sensing device.\
    \ The experiment was carried out on \ntwo soil types (sandy, and clay) under three\
    \ flow rates (4.2, 5.6, and 6.2 \nl/h) for each soil type. Soil moisture content\
    \ (SMC) average and total \nmoisture content average were calculated for both\
    \ soil types throughout \nfour investigation periods (6, 12, 24, and 48 h) respectively,\
    \ after \napplying the water for an hour. Standard deviation (SD) was estimated\
    \ \nfor each quarter of the total investigation depth to determine the amount\
    \ \nof variation or dispersion of the obtained average (mean) moisture \ncontent\
    \ values. For sandy soil, (15 cm) vertically (under the emission \npoint directly)\
    \ is the optimal position recommended putting a calibrated \nmoisture sensing\
    \ device use in irrigation scheduling under the lowest flow \nrate (4.2 l/h) whereas,\
    \ (15, 15 cm) horizontally and vertically \nrespectively, (from the emission point)\
    \ is recommended for clay soil under \nflow rate (5.6 l/h) to obtain highly irrigation\
    \ efficiency and thus, highly \nwater productivity and water use energy efficiency.\

    \             - 158 - \n1. INTRODUCTION \noil moisture content (SMC) is a major\
    \ determinant of plant growth \nand crop productivity. SMC has a major role in\
    \ ecological and \nhydrological processes at different scales, including root\
    \ water \nabsorption, \nphotosynthesis, \nnutrient \ntransport, \nevapotranspiration,\
    \ \ninfiltration, runoff, and soil erosion (Chaney et al., 2015). Therefore, \n\
    Investigation of the soil moisture dynamics of agricultural lands is vital \n\
    not only to improve agricultural water use efficiency, but also to \nunderstand\
    \ the impact of agricultural cultivation and irrigation on the \nwater cycle (Ren\
    \ et al., 2016).Consequently, it must be a considerable \nparameter in environmental,\
    \ agricultural, hydrological, and geotechnical \nstudies and projects (Brocca\
    \ et al.,2014).Soil moisture content (SMC) \nshows high spatiotemporal variability,\
    \ its spatial pattern is characterized \nby temporal stability, defined as the\
    \ temporal persistence of spatial \npatterns of soil water content over time(Joshi\
    \ et al., 2011).The temporal \nstability concept can be used to determine locations\
    \ that represent the \nmean SMC of an area, to up- or downscale SMC measurements,\
    \ and to \nprovide missing data in hydrological analyses (Penna et al., 2013).\
    \ It can \nalso be used to determine the mean SMC of an area using a small number\
    \ \nof monitoring points, which saves time and reduces the labor required \ncompared\
    \ with traditional monitoring methods (Jia et al., 2013).Micro \nirrigation systems\
    \ have greater potential for accurate irrigation delivery \nthan other irrigation\
    \ systems and also easily to control and are commonly \nautomated on a time ,soil\
    \ moisture, or time–temperature basis (Evett et \nal., 2006).Automation of these\
    \ irrigation systems plays an important role \nin the provision of water efficiency\
    \ in agricultural farming systems \nirrigated because it can provide the required\
    \ amount of water in a timely \nmanner according to the needs of the plant and\
    \ the circumstances of the \nactual \nwater \nthroughout \nthe \nseasons \nof\
    \ \nthe \nyear \n(Boutraa \net.,2011).According to Irrigation Association., 2007\
    \ a variety of \ntechnologies are designed to minimize excessive irrigation by\
    \ measuring \nor estimating soil moisture content these technologies include soil\
    \ \nmoisture sensor (SMS) controllers, evapotranspiration (ET) based \ncontrollers\
    \ and rain sensors. Many researchers have investigated the \nautomation of irrigation\
    \ systems and the use of soil moisture sensing \nS \nIRRIGATION AND DRAINAGE \n\

    \ blocks, granular matrix sensors \n(GMS), and electromagnetic (EM) sensors. Several\
    \ studies investigated \nthe use of EM sensors in novel automated irrigation management\
    \ \napplications (Miralles-Crespo and Van Iersel., 2011). In these studies, \n\
    significant water savings in comparison with traditional irrigation \nscheduling\
    \ approaches, as high as 60%, were reported without a negative \neffect on crop\
    \ yield. Blonquist et al., 2006 installed a soil moisture \nsensor(time domain\
    \ transmission) for the registration of volumetric water \ncontent in the soil,\
    \ compared with an irrigation threshold, and link this to \na solenoid  valve\
    \ on the  irrigation line  supplying water to the irrigation \nsystem. This system\
    \ applied 53% less water than under the traditional \nmethod. Ooi et al., 2010\
    \ used automation to irrigate an apple orchard, \nThe system developed allowed\
    \ fully automated on-farm irrigation based \non real-time feedback control increased\
    \ economic water use efficiency \nand water use efficiency by 73% compared with\
    \ the manual irrigation \nsystem. Large variations in water content and matric\
    \ potential may exceed \nthe range of operation for certain sensors (e.g., tensiometers).Also,\
    \ Soil \nmoisture sensors positioning and accuracy may affect the performance\
    \ \nand irrigation efficiency of soil moisture based irrigation scheduling \n\
    systems under various conditions (soil types, potential evapotranspiration \n\
    rates, discharge rates, irrigation depths, drip line spacing).(Soulis et al.,\
    \ \n2015).Also, as position of sensors plays a significant role in irrigation\
    \ \nscheduling as poor sensor positioning that is not representative of the soil\
    \ \nmoisture conditions in the root zone can result either in crop water stress,\
    \ \nor in over-irrigation that negates the water saving capabilities of soil \n\
    moisture scheduling (Wang et al., 2012).Thus, in agriculture, knowledge \nof soil\
    \ moisture allows proper irrigation management and forecasting of \ncrop yields\
    \ (Grabow et al., 2013).Soil moisture wetting patterns can be \nobtained either\
    \ experimentally, which are case-specific, or by simulation \nusing suitable mathematical\
    \ models. As a result, several studies were \nconducted to understand the extent\
    \ and patterns of spatial and temporal \nvariations in water content and matric\
    \ potential within drip irrigated fields \n(Or., 1996). \nUsually, many of these\
    \ irrigation studies focus on the top 1–2 m or even \nshallower depths, as the\
    \ root zone or depth of interest, with a hypothetical \nIRRIGATION AND DRAINAGE\

    \ and Simunek., 2016). However, \nfew studies have investigated the distribution\
    \ of SMC temporal stability \ncharacteristics at a fine scale (e.g., every 20\
    \ cm or less) (Gao et al., \n2015).In this context, the main purpose of this study\
    \ is to investigate the \ninfluence of soil moisture sensor position on the performance\
    \ of soil \nmoisture based irrigation scheduling systems under different conditions\
    \ of \nsoil types, flow rates and investigation periods (6, 12, 24, and 48 h)\
    \  to \ndetermine the optimal location of a moisture sensing device under \nconditions\
    \ of soil moisture based irrigation scheduling systems to \nmaximize water productivity\
    \ and thus, water use energy efficiency. \n2. MATERIALS AND METHODS \n2.1. Physical\
    \ description of the experiment. \nA lab experiment was carried out using a transparent\
    \ fiber glass box (100 \nx 100 x20 cm) as shown in Fig.1 to simulate a soil profile\
    \ to the root zone \narea. The box was made of fiberglass to facilitate the observation\
    \ of water \nmovement in the soil profile after water application. A grid of holes\
    \ was \ndrilled in one side of the box on equal spaces (5 cm in both horizontal\
    \ and \nvertical directions) from the emission point to investigate soil moisture\
    \ \ncontent distribution throughout the soil. Long path outline emitter was \n\
    fixed at the emission point (0, 0) coordinates. One terminal of the lateral \n\
    (16 mm inner diameter) was connected to the water supply and the other \nterminal\
    \ was closed by an end cap. The investigation was carried out after \napplying\
    \ the water for an hour from the emission source. The total \ninvestigation area\
    \ was 80 cm width (40 cm horizontally on both side of \nthe emission point) and\
    \ 60 cm depth. Electric conductivity (EC) of the \napplied water was measured\
    \ and an amount of water was applied to the \nbox before the experiments in order\
    \ to leach the salts in the soil to avoid \nthe expected effect of their non-uniform\
    \ distribution in the proposed \nsensing device’s readings accuracy. The bottom\
    \ of the box had a drain \nhole to discharge the leaching water. This water EC\
    \ was measured \ngradually till reaching a reading near to the EC of applied water.\

    \ \nThree flow rates (4.2, 5.6, and 6.2l/h) were used during the study to \nchange\
    \ the behavior of water movement which will be investigated to \nconsider the\
    \ expected variation in the distribution of soil moisture content \nin the root\
    \ zone. This is expected to clarify whether there will be a change \nin the selected\
    \ position of the sensor regarding the variation of water \nmovement and wetting-front\
    \ advance or not. The change in emitter flow \nrate was achieved by using three\
    \ operating pressure heads (5, 8, and 10 m \nof water) that are suitable for trickle\
    \ irrigation network operation. \nOperating pressure head was measured by using\
    \ pressure gauge 1 m \naccuracy which was monitored continuously during operation\
    \ to avoid \nany change that may happen in the pressure which was controlled by\
    \ a \nvalve at the water outlet source. \n2.2.2. Soil texture. \nClay and sandy\
    \ soil types were studied to determine the optimal position \nof the moisture\
    \ sensing device for each soil type. The used volume of \neach soil type which\
    \ was put in the box was transferred from outside \nfield. The used soils were\
    \ sifted before entering the box and compacted \nby hand to avoid the existence\
    \ of gravels or air cavities that may affect \nthe measurements. The soil leaching\
    \ process helped in soil compaction \nand the soil was allowed to dry before the\
    \ tests. \n2.2.3. Investigation periods. \nThe investigation was carried out for\
    \ each soil type for four investigation \nperiods (6, 12, 24, 48 hs) after applying\
    \ the water for an hour from the \nemission source. \nIRRIGATION AND DRAINAGE\

    A digital moisture meter (SKZ-DM300L), 2digits accuracy was used to \ninvestigate\
    \ soil moisture distribution throughout the soil profile. The \nprobe of the device\
    \ was assumed to act any proposed sensing device. The \ndevice was calibrated\
    \ before investigation to ensure its accuracy. The \ngravitational method was\
    \ used to calculate the moisture content of the two \nsoil types (sandy and clay)\
    \ by putting the wet sample in a pot and \nrecorded the weight of the sample (wet\
    \ weight) and then, samples were \ndried at 105 °C for 24 h. Soil moisture content\
    \ was measured by the \ndevice before the drying process. Six different weight\
    \ samples for each \ntype of soil were used in the calibration. The dry weight\
    \ was recorded to \ncalculate the per cent of moisture content referring to the\
    \ formula used by \n(Gardner et al., 2001). \nThe obtained results were fed to\
    \ software (curve expert version 1.3) to \nobtain the calibration formula which\

    \ AND DISCUSSION \n3.1. Moisture content variation. \n3.1.1. Soil texture effect.\
    \ \nThe obtained results are listed in (Table 1,and 2),by comparing two soil \n\
    types (sandy, and clay) under the study, the obtained results indicate large \n\
    variation in moisture content average throughout the investigation periods \n\
    for the same flow rate values, for example, after (6 h ) the values were \n(1.53,\
    \ 1.88, 2.86, and 6.94 %) respectively, for sandy soil under flow rate \n(4.2\
    \ l/h) as shown in (Table 1), while the values were (20.04, 17.02, 9.25, \nand\
    \ 4.85% ) respectively, for clay for the same investigation period under \nthe\
    \ same flow rate as shown in (Table 2). For sandy soil, the observed \nincrease\
    \ in the values of moisture content average in the latest quarter of \nthe root\
    \ zone area (45-60 cm) during the investigation periods (6, 12, 24, \nand 48 h)\
    \ respectively, under three flow rates (4.2, 5.6, and 6.2 l/h) as \nshown in (Table\
    \ 1) maybe because of the accumulation of the water in the \nlatest quarter of\
    \ the fiberglass box due to the decrease in water drainage \nrate through the\
    \ drainage holes because of the fast downward movement \nin vertical direction\
    \ where macro-pores are dominant in sandy soil. On \nthe other hand, for sandy\
    \ soil, the obtained results illustrated that the \nincrease in flow rate from\
    \ (4.2 l/h) up to (6.2 l/h) led to increase in the \ntotal average of moisture\

    \ period and wetting-front advance. \nBy investigating the points which represented\
    \ the total moisture content \naverage, the results shown in (Table 3, and 4)\
    \ have been reached which \nrepresent its recommended location from the discharge\
    \ source. For two \nsoil types, the obtained results illustrate that by increasing\
    \ the flow rate up \nto (6.2 l/h),the total moisture content average movement\
    \ increased along \nthe wetting-front for the vertical  and horizontal directions\
    \ throughout the \ninvestigation period (6, 12, 24, 48 h) respectively, but the\
    \ movement in \nthe vertical direction was clearly high for sandy soil which reached\
    \ the \nmaximum  depth value (60 cm) vertically compared with clay soil which\
    \ \nreached (35cm) vertically under the same flow rate (6.2 l/h) at the end of\
    \ \nthe investigation period (48 h) ,while  the results showed decreasing in the\
    \ \nhorizontal movement of the total moisture content average compared with \n\
    the movement in the vertical direction which ranged  from (0 : 15 cm) \nhorizontally\
    \  for both two soil types (sandy, clay) throughout the \ninvestigation period.\
    \ The obtained results stressed the concept that using \nthe high flow rate (e.g.,\
    \ 6.2 l/h) in a single irrigation event maybe result in \nmoving the irrigation\
    \ water out the effective root zone of the plants. \nWhereas, using the high flow\
    \ rate which leads to increase in vertical \nmovement than horizontal movement\
    \ especially for sandy soil where \nmacro-pores are dominant and allow for fast\
    \ downward movement and \nthis maybe lead to increase deep percolation which leads\
    \ to exposing the \nirrigation water to move beyond the effective root zone especially\
    \ at the \ninitial stage of growth. Also, the results provided clear evidence\
    \ the total \nmoisture content average is spatiotemporal variable and these results\
    \ were \nin agreement with (Liu and Shao., 2014) who illustrated that soil \n\
    moisture content (SMC) shows high spatiotemporal variability. Also, The \nresults\
    \ are compatible with (Siyal and Skaggs., 2009) who found that \nvertical wetting\
    \ distances in soil treated with a porous clay pipe under \npositive pressure\
    \ irrigation were in the order of sandy loam, loam and \nclay loam respectively\
    \ , and the horizontal wetting distances were in the \norder of loam , sandy loam\
    \ and clay loam respectively. Furthermore, the \nwater content in the wetted zone\
    \ was the largest in the clay loam, \nfollowed by the loam and sandy loam. Also,\
    \ there was an agreement with \nIRRIGATION AND DRAINAGE \n \nMisr J. Ag. Eng.,\

    \             - 167 - \n(Jiu-Sheng, et al., 2007) where in uniform coarse-textured\
    \ soils, like \nsandy soils, a greater wetted depth (area) was obtained by the\
    \ use of \nemitters having smaller application rate. Also, (Levin et al., 1979)\
    \ who \nused emitters with different discharge rates, found that increasing \n\
    discharge rate up to (8 l/h) resulted in an increase of wetting area in the \n\
    vertical direction and a decrease in the horizontal direction and thus, \nemitters\
    \ of high discharge rate of (8 l/h) caused water runoff on fine \ntextured soils,\
    \ and emitters of discharge of (4 l/h) are recommended to use \nin this soil and\
    \ they reported that emitters of (4 l/h) could be used in \nsandy soils .Also,\
    \ the results obtained by (Ragheb., 1997) showed that \ndaily irrigation at a\

    \ variation in moisture content average \nat different depths (0:60 cm) throughout\
    \ the investigation periods for the \nsame flow rate values, for example, after\
    \ (6 h) the values were (1.53, \n1.88, 2.86, and 6.94 %) respectively, for the\
    \ sandy soil under flow rate \n(4.2 l/h), while the values were (20.04, 17.02,\
    \ 9.25, and 4.85%) \nrespectively, for the clay for the same investigation interval\
    \ under the \nsame flow rate. On the other hand, for the sandy soil, the obtained\
    \ results \nillustrated that the increase in flow rate from (4.2 l/h) up to (6.2\
    \ l/h) led to \nincrease in the total average of moisture content from (3.30,\
    \ 3.30, 2.86, \nand 2.53 %) to (4.58, 4.53, 4.46, and 4.45%) by an estimated increase\
    \ of \n(27.94,27.15,35.87, and 43.15%) for the investigation periods (6, 12, 24,\
    \ \nand 48 h) respectively. In comparison, for clay soil, there was also an \n\
    increase in the total average of moisture content from (12.79, 12.18, \n10.98,\
    \ and10.96 %) to (19.30, 19.18, 18.91, and 17.69 %) by an estimated \nincrease\
    \ of (33.73, 36.49, 41.93 and 38.04%) respectively, under the same \nflow rate\
    \ values and for the same investigation periods. Also, the obtained \nresults\
    \ illustrated also that, for both soil types, by increasing the flow rate \nup\
    \ to (6.2 l/h) there was a clear variation in moisture content average and \n\
    wetting-front \nadvance \n(horizontal \nand \nvertical) \nthroughout \nthe \n\
    investigation period the wetting-front advance.  \nFor the sandy soil, the lowest\
    \ flow rate (4.2 l/h) caused in the lowest \nstandard deviation values (0.64,\
    \ 0.62, 0.65, and 0.77) respectively, along \nthe investigation depth (0:15 cm)\
    \ which refers to a convergence in the \nmoisture content values along the investigation\
    \ depth (0:15cm) \nthroughout the investigation periods (6, 12, 24, and 48 h)\
    \ respectively, \nfollowed by flow rates (5.6, and 4.2 l/h). In contrast, for\
    \ clay soil, the \nflow rate (5.6 l/h) caused in the lowest standard deviation\
    \ values (11.55, \n11.03, 11.50, and 12.72) respectively, for the same depth and\
    \ the same \ninvestigation periods followed by flow rates (6.2, and 4.2 l/h).\

  relevance_evaluation: The study by Elnemr et al. (2019) is highly relevant to the
    point of focus in the literature review, which is architectures and protocols
    for seamless integration of machine learning-generated insights with IoT-enabled
    irrigation control systems, such as MQTT and CoAP for lightweight, real-time communication.
    The study provides valuable insights into the impact of sensor placement on the
    accuracy and efficiency of irrigation systems, which is crucial for optimizing
    water use and maximizing crop yields. By understanding the optimal placement of
    soil moisture sensors, irrigation systems can be designed and implemented to deliver
    water more precisely to plant roots, reducing waste and increasing productivity.
    This aligns well with the goal of developing automated, real-time irrigation systems
    that can effectively manage water resources and enhance agricultural sustainability.

    is to address agricultural difficulties by providing a thorough,\nintegrated solution.\
    \ This work makes a variety of important\ncontributions. By utilizing cutting-edge\

    maximizing production while minimizing resource usage. The\nsuggested solution\
    \ also uses blockchain technology to create a\nsafe, decentralized network that\
    \ guarantees data integrity and\ndefends against threats. We also introduce energy\
    \ harvesting\ntechnology to address the issue of continuous energy supply for\n\
    IoT devices, which lessens the load on farmers by removing the\nrequirement for\
    \ additional batteries. We achieved 89.5% accuracy\nin our proposed machine learning\

    \ of\nthings; energy harvesting; blockchain technology\nI.\nINTRODUCTION\nWithout\
    \ a doubt, agriculture is the most important source of\nlivelihood in Bangladesh.\
    \ As the world’s population expands,\nincreased agricultural output is essential.\
    \ The amount of\nfresh water and appropriate fertilizer used in irrigation must\n\
    be raised in order to maintain enhanced farm productivity.\nUnintentional water\
    \ waste happens when water consumption\nis not planned. Choosing the right fertilizer\
    \ for a particular\nfarmland is likewise a difficult challenge for our farmers.\n\
    This demonstrates the urgent need for alternatives to reduce\nwater waste and\
    \ appropriate fertilizer choices without placing\nfarmers under stress. In the\
    \ Electronic age, agriculture is rapidly\nbecoming a data-intensive sector, with\
    \ farmers collecting and\nanalyzing massive amounts of data from various sources\
    \ (e.g.,\nsensors, farming machinery, etc.) to obtain vital information\nand become\
    \ more efficient in production. Technology nowadays\nhas advanced a lot. With\
    \ the help of Machine Learning and\nIoT devices, a drastic change can be made\
    \ possible in the\nagricultural industry [1].\nWith the release of open-source\
    \ Arduino devices and the\navailability of different sensors, it is now possible\
    \ to build\ndevices that can monitor soil moisture content and irrigate\nfields\
    \ or landscapes as needed. Machine learning algorithms\nare used to assess various\
    \ agricultural data and may readily\nforecast which decisions should be made to\
    \ improve farmland\nproductivity. In comparison to their previous farming ways,\n\
    the farmer may easily combine ML and IoT into their farming\nand create an automated\
    \ system that is more time effective\nand less risky. Here, Fig. 1 depicts the\
    \ difference between the\ntraditional system with the ML-based agricultural framework.\n\
    Wireless Sensor Networks(WSNs) technologies have a\nmajor challenge with limited\
    \ energy. Many research in WSNs\nhas also been focused on reliable energy supply\
    \ to extend\nthe survival time of limited power sources in a network [2].\nEnergy\
    \ harvesting techniques are used to overcome the energy-\nscarcity problem of\
    \ WSNs. Energy harvesting is a process in\nwhich energy is obtained from the environment\
    \ as renewable\nenergy sources like solar radiation, Radio Frequency (RF),\nwind,\
    \ geothermal, electromagnetic (EM) waves, hydro, etc.,\nand is stored effectively\
    \ for driving various applications systems\nwhich may include wireless sensor\
    \ networks (WSNs) [3] [4].\nTherefore, it can be used to operate the devices of\
    \ the embedded\nsystem for a reliable energy supply.\nSecurity is one of the most\
    \ critical aspects of IoT, as it\ndeals with the protection of data and devices\
    \ from unauthorized\naccess, use, disclosure, disruption, modification, or destruction\n\
    [5]. Encryption mechanisms are mostly used to ensure that\ndata is securely transmitted.\
    \ But, regularly used encryption\nalgorithms such as DES, AES, and RSA will be\
    \ heavy for small-\nscale embedded systems. Therefore, blockchain technology can\n\
    be used as a lightweight calculation technique to reliably operate\nand secure\
    \ an IoT system[6] [7].\nThis paper presents the latest IoT-ML-driven intelligent\
    \ agri-\ncultural management and provides a substantial new research\ndirection.\
    \ The central insight of this work is to offer possible\nsolutions to farming\
    \ hazards while providing a combined\nframework. Some significant contributions\
    \ of this paper are\noutlined as follows:\n•\nSmart Management: Traditional agricultural\
    \ manage-\nment is strengthened with edge-cutting technologies\n(i.e., IoT and\
    \ Machine Learning).\n•\nDistant Monitoring and Controlling: Farmers can\nmonitor\
    \ and control irrigation management from a\ndistance in terms of sensor-based\
    \ real-time data.\n•\nIntelligent Decision Making: Our machine learning\nmodel\

    and decentralized network that can ensure data integrity\nand protect data from\
    \ denial of service (DDoS) attacks,\nand man-in-the-middle (MITM) attacks.\n•\n\
    Energy Harvesting: To ensure a continuous energy\nsupply for the IoT system, we\
    \ have introduced energy\nharvesting technology which reduces the hassle for the\n\
    farmers of using extra batteries.\nThe rest of the paper is organized as follows:\
    \ Section II\nprovides an overview of existing works related to our proposed\n\
    framework. Section III provides a detailed description of the\nhardware that have\
    \ used in this research. Section IV discusses\nthe proposed IoT-ML-based smart\

    \ our system.\nSection VI presents the real-life implementation of our project.\n\
    Next, Section VII illustrates and analyzes the experimental\nresult from our machine\
    \ learning models. Section VIII future\nresearch directions in this field of research.\
    \ Finally, Section IX\ngives a brief conclusion.\nII.\nRELATED RESEARCH\nSeveral\
    \ ML-IoT-based researches and project works on\nagriculture systems have been\
    \ carried out till today.\nIn [8], For remote sensing and smart agriculture, Ullo\
    \ et al.\npresented a review of research on the developments in smart\nsensors\
    \ and IoT. They put forth some suggestions for IoT\nadvancements that will support\
    \ researchers and agriculturalists\nin their work.\nIn [9], Samuel et al. analyzed\
    \ numerous techniques for crop\nselection, crop sowing, weed detection, and system\
    \ monitoring.\nThey have recommended different image processing methods\nfor weed\
    \ and leaf detection and evaluated the benefits and\ndrawbacks of each. Drone\
    \ implementation has been considered\nfor real-time monitoring and seed planting.\
    \ However, no actual\nimplementation is shown in this research; they have only\n\
    reviewed several smart agricultural strategies.\nIn [10], they analyze soil moisture\
    \ levels and apply auto\nirrigation to the crops. In order to eliminate the need\
    \ for human\ninvolvement, this system also senses temperature, humidity, and\n\
    the presence of impediments in the targeted region. These data\nare accessible\
    \ to the user via mobile from the cloud. By giving\nthe motor driver the command\
    \ YES/NO based on this data, the\nuser can control the operation of the motor.\n\
    In [11], they use a cloud-based architecture and the Internet\nof Things to examine\
    \ a smart irrigation system. This system\nis designed to measure soil moisture\
    \ and humidity and then\nprocess this data in the cloud using a variety of machine-\n\
    learning techniques. Farmers receive accurate information\nregarding water content\
    \ regulations. If farmers apply smart\nirrigation, they can reduce their water\
    \ usage.\nIn [12], they use IoT and machine learning to predict\nlate blight disease\
    \ in potatoes and tomatoes prior to the first\noccurrence. This will send farmers\
    \ a warning message on the\nprecise time to apply the protective pesticides.\n\
    In [13], for yield prediction, they present a hybrid ML\nmodel using IoT. They\
    \ use a two-tier ML approach named\naKNCN and ELM-mBOA.In the first tire, they\
    \ estimate soil\nquality and in the second tier, they predict the crop yield.\n\
    In agriculture, supply, and demand have always been crucial\nissues for sustainable\
    \ production management. To address\nand provide a possible solution to this problem,\
    \ M. Lee et\nal. proposed an IoT-based controlled agricultural production\nmanagement\
    \ [14]. The authors developed a decision support\nsystem to predict specific criteria\
    \ based on IoT-enabled sensor\ndata.\nA cloud-based real-time data analysis model\
    \ is proposed\nin [15] instead of dew-point humidity. In this regard, they\ndesigned\
    \ a CMM index measurement model to evaluate the\ncrops’ comfort level of relative\
    \ humidity levels.\nTo increase the crop production rate, real-time data analysis\n\
    based on an artificial model is proposed by Y. Zhou et al. in [16].\nThe current\
    \ innovation trend expects farmers to use IoT and\ntechnology to identify the\
    \ organization of those difficulties they\nface, such as water management deficiencies\
    \ in agriculture\nand productivity concerns. This research has attempted to\n\
    build dazzling agricultural cultivation patterns utilizing IoT\ntechnologies.\
    \ IoT has significantly improved agriculture by\nanalyzing various agricultural\
    \ difficulties and issues.\nAn IOT-based intelligent technology for agriculture\
    \ that can\nsense soils and environmental factors was proposed by Abhijith\nH.\
    \ V. et al. in [17]. In order to identify the urgent needs for\noptimal crop growth,\
    \ they applied data mining techniques to\nthe sensed data.\nAbraham et al. [18]\

    farm encroachment.\nThe purpose of the study Wongpatikaseree et al. [19], is\n\
    to propose a traceability system, summarizing and presenting\nobserved data from\
    \ the smart farm.\nFor smart farming, Deden Ardiansyah et al. [20] suggested\n\
    a WSN Server that can handle and optimize agricultural data.\nThey instantly store\
    \ the data in the database, which is afterward\nrepresented as a website and accessible\
    \ through the Internet\nnetwork.\nAutomation in agriculture is a basic need for\
    \ remote\ncontrol-based agricultural management to ensure sustainable\ndevelopment\
    \ in this field of research. In this regard, L.\nVijayaraja et al. proposed an\
    \ IoT-based monitoring system\nusing wireless communication networks in [21].\
    \ The power\nsupply management used in this framework is entirely from the\nrenewable\
    \ energy source that provides a cost-effective model\nfor sensor-based decision\
    \ management in intelligent farming.\nIn [22], Yaw-Wen Kuo, et al. presented a\
    \ Long-range IoT\nsystem where they developed four types of IoT units based on\n\
    Long-range technology. They employed pH, ORP, and EC in\nType A and water, air,\
    \ and humidity sensors in Type B. In type\nC, the pump can be operated remotely,\
    \ and in type D, a water\nflow or water meter-controlling system is provided.\n\
    They presented a cloud service-based architecture in [23]\nthat includes a variety\
    \ of services for farmers, including agri-\nfood-related services, financing,\
    \ fostering, warehouse manage-\nment, etc. They have suggested interactive video\
    \ conferencing,\nvoice-based services, text messaging, web portal services, and\n\
    more under the heading of cloud services.\nA key component of practicing smart\
    \ agriculture is precision\nagriculture. In this context, Patil et al. [24] suggested\
    \ a system\nthat measures soil moisture using sensors for temperature,\nhumidity,\
    \ and soil moisture. Additionally, they offered various\nmethods for highlighting\
    \ the issue of data loss.\nIn [25], Quasim et al. use blockchain techniques in\
    \ smart\nhealthcare systems to ensure the security of healthcare data.\nIt provides\
    \ the security, privacy, and efficiency of the data in\ntransmission between wearable\
    \ sensors and Internet of Things\n(IoT) devices.\nIn [26], Makhdoom et al. made\
    \ a blockchain-based frame-\nwork for privacy-preserving and secure data sharing\
    \ in smart\ncities. The system secures data sharing by segmenting the\nblockchain\
    \ network into different channels, where each channel\nconsists of a limited number\
    \ of authorized organizations and\nhandles a particular type of data, such as\
    \ financial information,\nhealth data, smart car data, or data related to smart\
    \ energy.\nAdditionally, smart contracts contain access control rules that\nregulate\
    \ who has access to the data of users within a channel.\nMany different types\
    \ of intelligent agricultural systems were\ndeveloped in the earlier work. Some\
    \ of these current systems\nare tabulated in Table I.\nIII.\nSYSTEM HARDWARE\n\

    \ and Rain Drop Sensor, only need\na 3.3V supply, the Capacitive Soil Moisture\
    \ Sensor and pH\nSensor need 5V. The GND pin serves as the common ground\nfor\
    \ every sensor. A solar panel system that is coupled to a\n9-volt battery backup\
    \ powers the system.\nB. Working Principle\nWe have divided our proposed framework\
    \ into different\nsubparts and each part’s working procedure is given below. The\n\
    overall working procedure is depicted in Fig. 12.\n1) Collecting Data From Sensor:\
    \ We used four different\ntypes of sensors, including capacitive soil moisture\
    \ sensors, pH\nsensors, MH-RD rain sensors, and LDR sensors, to execute\nsmart\
    \ IoT agriculture. We can estimate how much water is in\nthe soil with the aid\
    \ of a soil moisture sensor. A pH sensor,\nwhich ranges from 0 to 14, allows us\
    \ to determine the water’s\nacidity or alkalinity. Water turns acidic if the value\
    \ falls below\n7, else it is alkanoic. Consider levels 5.5 to 7 to be ideal for\n\
    growing crops. We can choose the best fertilizer for the soil\nwith the aid of\
    \ a pH sensor.\nBasically, a rain sensor is used to detect rain. A rain board\n\
    that can detect rain and a control module that can compare\nwww.ijacsa.thesai.org\n\

    \ both included. The raindrop sensor\naids in our selection of how to operate\
    \ the motor. The LDR\nsensor, which is used to detect the presence of light, has\
    \ also\nbeen employed.\nNow, each of these sensors is linked to a node MCU board\n\
    in our project, and data from the sensors is uploaded to the node\nMCU board and\
    \ shown on the serial monitor of the Arduino\nUNO editor and\n2) Sending Data\
    \ to Cloud Server: The node MCU board\nreceives all sensor data, which we would\
    \ love to save in the\ncloud in order to control for remote distance. We have\
    \ utilized\nFirebase as a cloud server. We linked the Firebase authentication\n\
    and real-time database URL that we built for our project with\nthe Arduino UNO\
    \ script in order to integrate Firebase with\nNode MCU.\nAll data is sent as a\
    \ parent-child combination to Firebase.\nAll of the sensor data is sent from the\
    \ node MCU as a child\nof Smart Irrigation, which we have constructed as Parent.\
    \ The\nFirebase stores the child value as a key-value pair.\n3) Data Collection:\
    \ The Firebase’s database contains all of\nthe sensor data, which is compiled\
    \ as a CSV file. Four columns\nmake up our dataset: pH, LDR, Rain, and Moisture.\
    \ Nearly\n820 data are in our dataset. Only integer values are accepted in\nthe\
    \ Moisture column here, whereas string values are accepted\nin the Rain and LDR\
    \ columns.\n4) Data Pre-processing: Data can be often inconsistent.\nMissing values\
    \ or values out of range is typical. So, the dataset\nneeds some pre-processing\
    \ before it can be used to train any\nmodel [27]. For this reason, we have considered\
    \ three such\ncases.\n•\nMissing Value Handling: While exploring our dataset,\n\
    we observed humidity, raining status, daylight status,\nand pH level fields with\
    \ missing values. Therefore, we\nhave filled them with average values of the respective\n\
    field.\n•\nOne Hot Decoder: Label encoding is simply the\nprocess of converting\
    \ each value in a column to a\nnumber. By using label encoding, we have converted\n\
    the categorical text data into model-understandable\nnumerical data. We had to\
    \ use the label encoding to\nget our dataset ready for our model.\n•\nAbnormal\
    \ Data Handling: Some data contain abnor-\nmal values. For example, the range\
    \ of the temperature\nin our dataset falls between -20 to 30 degrees Celsius.\n\
    However, we have even found some data above and\nbelow this range. Data tuples\
    \ with these abnormalities\nhave been dropped from the dataset.\n•\nNormalization:\
    \ Normalization is used to increase the\naccuracy of models [28]. It is simply\
    \ the process of\nhaving all the data on the same scale. We have used\nwww.ijacsa.thesai.org\n\

    \ Applications,\nVol. 14, No. 7, 2023\ntemperature, pressure, relative humidity,\
    \ and pressure\nas features to train our model. The features used\nto teach a\
    \ machine-learning algorithm have different\nranges of values. This can badly\
    \ affect the machine’s\nlearning ability. To solve this problem, we have\nstandardized\
    \ the feature values so that all the features\nstand equal in their representation.\
    \ By normalization,\nall the feature values are mapped in the range between\n\
    0 and 1.\n5) Machine Learning Model: The developed architecture is\na Neural Network\
    \ (NN) based because of its great accuracy. The\nfundamental advantage of NN over\
    \ classical machine learning\nmodels is that it recognizes significant traits\
    \ automatically\nand without human intervention. It’s a feed-forward NN with\n\
    parameters using the back-propagation algorithm and stochastic\ngradient descent.\
    \ Distinct processing layers serve different\npurposes. The output of the feature\
    \ map is produced by\nconventional layers, which conduct linear convolution between\n\
    a series of input tensors and filters. The nonlinear transformation\nis performed\
    \ using the ReLU, which is the most widely\nemployed activation function. The\
    \ activation function for the\nfully connected layer to the end must be careful\
    \ on the tasks.\nBatch normalization and an activation layer are performed after\n\
    each convolution.\nReLU = max(0, X)\n(1)\nd(x) = activation(wx + b)\n(2)\nDropout(x,\
    \ p) = (x : prob., p) (x : prob., 1 − p)\n(3)\nS(x) =\n1\n1 + e−x\n(4)\n6) Mobile\
    \ Application Development: A smart remote con-\ntrol application can ease our\
    \ maximum task [29]. We have used\nthe MIT app inventor to make the mobile application\
    \ that will\nbe connected to our system and by using this app we can do\nthe following\
    \ task\n•\nFertilizer Suggestion: By analyzing the pH value, the\napp may suggest\
    \ which fertilizer is best for a given\nsoil. The app will recommend some alkanoic\
    \ fertilizer\nif the pH value rises to help reduce the rising pH value\nand vice\
    \ versa. Algorithm 1 depicts how the fertilizer\nis suggested in our system.\n\
    •\nVisualization of Predicted Results: In order to predict\nwhether the motor\
    \ would turn off or not based on\nthe moisture, LDR, and raindrop sensor values,\
    \ we\nconstruct a neural network model and link it with\nour mobile app. Algorithm\
    \ 2 depicts how the remote\ncontrolling is done to control the motor in our system.\n\

    \ was described as a data structure using asym-\nmetric encryption algorithms\
    \ and hash functions to ensure\nthat data tampering and forgery are impossible\
    \ [30] [31] [32].\nEvery smart system needs to be taken under the shelter of a\n\
    security system to avoid getting an external attack. Our smart\nagricultural system\
    \ is public so any intruder can make attacks\nsuch as DoS attacks to crash the\
    \ system, and spoofing to alter\nthe control. In the IoT environment where high\
    \ computational\nencryption, decryption, and high-level security are not possible.\n\

    \ Computer Science and Applications,\nVol. 14, No. 7, 2023\nTherefore, We are\
    \ implanting blockchain technologies into our\nsmart agricultural system through\
    \ which we are capable to\nmaintain high throughput, low latency, low communication\n\
    cost, and tamper-proof and traceability. Blockchain refers to a\ndistributed ledger\
    \ system where data or transactions are stored\nin blocks that are connected to\
    \ each other through making\nhash which can not only serve as unique IDs but also\
    \ prove\nthe integrity of the blocks. The hash of the previous block is\nused\
    \ to make a hash for the next block along with its data.\nIf any intruder wants\
    \ to tamper or alter the block data, all\nthe consecutive block hash will be changed.\
    \ Therefore, any\nintruder attempts to alter the data or spoof the blockchain\
    \ will\nnot be possible.\nIn this system, we consider nodeMCU, Firebase cloud,\
    \ and\nmobile app as nodes. In order to avoid altering data in the\nnetwork, we\
    \ are using blockchain technology. When any node\nwants to send data to other\
    \ nodes, it encapsulates the data\ninto a block along with its hash values (SHA256)\
    \ and nodeID\nthen adds it to the blockchain. All these nodes will contain the\n\
    blockchain locally. After adding the block, the node sends it\nto the cloud through\
    \ the network. We are not using any PoW,\nPoS, or accountant selection algorithms\
    \ which is not possible\nbecause of a very small amount of nodes and our nodeMCU\n\
    has very limited capabilities to run these algorithms (Algorithm\n3). When the\
    \ block is sent to the cloud, I validate the block by\nchecking all the hashes\
    \ of the previous block along with the\nnodeID. If it gets any error, the node\
    \ will consider the block\nas from an attacker and reject the block from adding\
    \ to the\nchain. Fig. 13 depicts the blockchain in our system.\nFig. 13. Blockchain\

    \ model that we built and implemented to forecast\nwhether the motor would be\
    \ on or off. We can operate our\nmotor using the two buttons in our app labeled\
    \ “ON\" and\n“OFF\". The motor status in the firebase changes to 1 when we\npress\
    \ the “ON\" button, and the firebase sends a signal to the\nnodeMCU board, which\
    \ then turns the motor on automatically.\nAnd that is how we can use our mobile\
    \ app to implement\nremote control.\nwww.ijacsa.thesai.org\n993 | P a g e\n(IJACSA)\

    \ ANALYSIS\nA. System Evaluation\nIn Table II, we have shown the difference between\
    \ our\nsystem and the existing systems. The criterion based on which\nwe have\
    \ shown the differences are remote monitor control, data\nvisualization, customized\
    \ mobile application, machine learning\nintegrated framework, creating own database,\
    \ central cloud\ndatabase, pH-based fertilizer suggestions, Machine learning\n\
    model development, and full automation. The references from\n[11] to [24] there\
    \ is no such system that has implemented all the\ncriteria in their system. But\
    \ we have successfully implemented\nall the criteria in our systems.\nB. Machine\
    \ Learning Model Evaluation\nOur deep learning neural network is implemented with\n\
    the help of our own dataset. We split the dataset into 80-20\nratios for training\
    \ and validation purposes. The heat map of the\nfeatures columns is illustrated\
    \ in Fig. 16. We fit our gradient\ndescent neural network within the data set.\
    \ The input layer\nof the neural network receives 3 input lines from the features\n\
    column, namely, rain status, moisture level, and daylight status\nrespectively.\
    \ Then we add one dense layer with 16 neurons and\nthe activation function as\
    \ ReLu. The next layer is a dropout\nlayer with a 20% drop rate. Next, we add\
    \ another dense layer\nwith 8 neurons and apply the activation function as ReLu.\n\
    Then we add another dropout layer with a 20% drop rate.\nFinally, for the output\
    \ layer, we add another dense layer with\na single neuron with is satiable for\
    \ binary classification (i.e.\nmotor on-off decision) with activation function\
    \ as Sigmoid.\nThe experimental result of our model is represented in\nTable III\
    \ while showing the validation loss rate as binary cross\nentropy and validation\
    \ accuracy level in different epochs. Our\nmodel successfully outcomes a stable\
    \ level of accuracy for\nthe different epochs. We got almost 89.5% accuracy in\
    \ our\nexperimental set-up.\nVIII.\nFUTURE RESEARCH DIRECTION\nFor future smart\
    \ irrigation management, several issues must\nbe addressed as follows:\n•\nLow-latency\
    \ in Real-Time Application: The moni-\ntoring and controlling mobile application\
    \ must be able\nto transmit real-time data to the farmers or its entity\nwhile\
    \ ensuring a low latency network.\n•\nHigh Bandwidth: To facilitate a buffer-less\
    \ transmis-\nsion, we need to ensure maximum bandwidth level to\nthe transmission\
    \ process.\n•\nConnectivity: To meet the high communication de-\nmands of future\
    \ IoT-ML integrated irrigation systems,\nreliable synchronization between linked\
    \ autos would\nbe required.\n•\nDeployment of Network Elements: When a network\n\
    has a high enough number of nodes, its overall\nperformance increases. Because\
    \ network equipment\ndeployment is costly, it is vital to have the required\n\
    number of network components up and running as\nquickly as feasible.\n•\nAugmented\
    \ Reality: AR is a multimedia application\nthat mixes real-world scenes into virtual\
    \ scenes and\nsuperimposes virtual scenes over real-world scenes to\nsupplement\
    \ traditional real-image information. This\ntechnology has the potential to help\
    \ farmers become\nmore aware of the app’s functionality.\n•\nEdge Computing: This\
    \ networking approach is built\non a network control layer that is logically centralized.\n\

    IX.\nCONCLUSION\nWe have put forth an integrated solution that enables\nfarmers\
    \ to solve the challenges that limit their production\nand profitability by utilizing\
    \ cutting-edge technologies like\nmachine learning (ML), the Internet of Things\
    \ (IoT), and\nblockchain. Through user-friendly mobile applications and\na secure\
    \ cloud database, this model, implemented with a\ngenerated database, offers helpful\
    \ insights and recommendations\nto farmers, including pesticide usage and water\
    \ motor control.\nReal-time monitoring and data collecting is made possible\n\
    by the integration of IoT devices, enabling accurate decision-\nmaking and assuring\
    \ optimal resource allocation. Incorpo-\nrating blockchain technology also improves\
    \ data traceability,\ntransparency, and integrity, fostering trust and accountability\n\
    throughout the agricultural ecosystem. Farmers may gain from\nhigher productivity,\
    \ decreased expenses, and enhanced general\nagricultural management by implementing\
    \ our Smart-Agri\nframework. They can obtain up-to-date, accurate information,\n\
    make decisions that will increase productivity and reduce\nwaste, and improve\
    \ their agricultural techniques. We have\napplied the gradient descent neural\
    \ network model for water\ncontrol management and achieved up to 89.5% accuracy.\
    \ In\naddition, the suggested structure creates chances for cooperation,\ninformation\
    \ exchange, and market access, all of which help\nthe agricultural industry thrive\
    \ and flourish sustainably.\nIn the future, the framework’s scalability, and its\
    \ inter-\noperability can all be explored through more research and\ndevelopment\
    \ in this area, along with potential problems like\nconnectivity problems and\
    \ data privacy issues. We can build an\necosystem that really revolutionizes the\
    \ agriculture sector by\ncontinually improving and building upon these technological\n\
    achievements, making it more intelligent, efficient, and robust\nin the face of\
    \ changing global issues.\nACKNOWLEDGMENT\nWe would like to acknowledge the support\

  explanation: 'This study evaluated the performance of seven irrigation scheduling
    algorithms for drip-irrigated apple trees in a semi-arid region of central Washington.
    The algorithms were based on a range of plant, soil, and weather-based approaches.
    The performance of the algorithms was compared in terms of the total amount of
    water applied, root zone soil water status, plant water status, cost, and simplicity
    of implementation.


    The TTT and CWSI algorithms, which rely on canopy temperature signals, showed
    promising performance in terms of delivering the right amount of water to the
    plants and avoiding water stress, while also having the advantage of being fully
    automatic. However, the TTT algorithm had a drawback in that it can issue false
    stress signals on humid days, while the CWSI algorithm requires more upfront investment
    in terms of hardware and setup.


    The WB algorithm, which is based on a simple soil water balance, also showed good
    performance, but it does not have the ability to respond to plant feedback and
    may lead to over or under-irrigation if the estimates of crop water use are incorrect.
    The SOIL and SL + WB algorithms, which rely on soil water tension sensors, failed
    to deliver enough water to the trees, resulting in severe water stress and impaired
    growth.


    In conclusion, the study found that the TTT and CWSI algorithms are promising
    options for automatic irrigation scheduling of drip-irrigated apple trees, while
    the WB algorithm is a good choice for simpler and lower-cost implementations.
    The SOIL and SL + WB algorithms are not recommended due to their poor performance
    in delivering adequate water to the trees.'

    and content Highlights • We developed a decision support system integrated with
    a wireless sensor network. • We developed and field-tested seven irrigation scheduling
    algorithms for drip-irrigated apples. • We used the time-temperature threshold
    (TTT) method in apple trees for the first time. • The thermal-based treatments
    competed well with neutron probe (NP). • Thermal/weather-based irrigation scheduling
    reduced applied water by about 70% compared with conventional irrigation. Abstract
    Seven irrigation scheduling algorithms and an automatic control system along with
    a wireless network of soil, thermal and weather sensors were developed and assessed
    in Prosser, WA in the growing season of 2013. The system was comprised of six
    wireless sensor and valve actuating nodes installed across an apple orchard, a
    central base station made up of a transceiver connected to a laptop, and a graphical
    user interface (GUI). The irrigation algorithms/treatments included the time-temperature
    threshold (TTT), crop water stress index with dynamic threshold (CWSI), soil-based
    using granular matrix sensors (SOIL), weather-based using a temperature-only-based
    evapotranspiration (ET) model and soil water balance (WB), a combination of SOIL
    and WB (SL + WB), a conventional irrigation practice used in the region (CNTRL),
    and soil-based using a neutron probe (NP) as benchmark. Different treatments were
    compared based on the total irrigation water (It) applied during the season. They
    were also compared based on simplicity and expense for a grower to implement.
    Soil water content (θs) and stem water potential (ψstem) were monitored in a number
    of treatment plots. The total applied water for CNTRL was significantly higher
    than all other treatments (p < 0.001). The thermal-based TTT and CWSI treatments
    applied the same amount of water as NP and WB (p < 0.001). CWSI and TTT substantially
    reduced water applied (70%) while maintaining ψstem within the non-stressed range.
    In addition, θs in the treatment plots of TTT and CWSI did not exceed the maximum
    allowed deficit recommended for apple trees (MAD of 50%) showing a strong agreement
    with NP. The SOIL and SL + WB treatments resulted in tangible under-irrigation
    as leaf drop, decreased leaf turgidity, growth reduction and abnormally small
    fruits were seen. Among all the strategies, WB seemed to bear the characteristics
    of being economical, easy to implement and fairly accurate. Our preliminary results
    also support the use of wireless sensor network for automatic irrigation management
    of drip-irrigated apple trees. Previous article in issue Next article in issue

    sensingDrip irrigation 1. Introduction A sound choice of irrigation scheduling
    method can lead to increased profit and water savings for farmers, reduced environmental
    impacts and sustainable agriculture (Smith et al., 1996). Proper management of
    irrigation water to maintain balanced soil water content is crucial for health
    and productivity of apple trees (Black et al., 2008). To date, research has offered
    a large number of approaches to detect water stress, compute crop water needs,
    and automatically schedule irrigation (Al-Kaisi et al., 1997, Orta et al., 2003,
    Jones, 2004, Farahani et al., 2007, Vellidis et al., 2008, McCready et al., 2009,
    Ko and Piccinni, 2009, Migliaccio et al., 2010, Romero et al., 2012). Irrigation
    scheduling approaches may be grouped into three main categories (Zhang and Pierce,
    2013): (i) monitoring of soil water status (soil-based), (ii) soil water balance
    calculations using weather information (weather-based), and (iii) sensing of crop
    water stress (plant-based). Automation of irrigation has been evaluated in a number
    of row plants including tomato, onion and bell pepper using soil sensors measuring
    tension (Thompson et al., 2007, Enciso et al., 2009) or volumetric water content
    (Zotarelli et al., 2009). Vellidis et al. (2008) developed and evaluated a real-time,
    smart soil moisture and temperature sensor array prototype for scheduling irrigation
    in cotton. Romero et al. (2012) reported that the approach of combining weather
    data with soil moisture signal could increase irrigation efficiency in almond
    trees. Tensiometers have been used by Meron et al. (2001) as a feedback to manage
    irrigation of apple trees. Soil water tension sensors provide a direct measure
    of plant water status (Pedro Vaza et al., 2013). Watermark™ sensors (Irrometer
    Co., Riverside, CA) have been identified as good indicators of irrigation start
    and stop (Leib and Matthews, 1999); however, sensor accuracy is contingent to
    site-specific calibration (Varble and Chávez, 2011). The calibration need of individual
    sensors can make the use of Watermark™ sensors tedious and unattractive to most
    farmers, thus very often they are used with only factory calibration. Neutron
    probe is a scientific-based method for precise measurement of soil water content
    and has shown to be a reliable reference for other irrigation scheduling techniques
    (Evett et al., 2009, O’Shaughnessy et al., 2012b). How change in weather parameters
    can affect plant water needs can be predicted using an evapotranspiration (ET)
    model. Frequently used ET models are the Penman-Monteith (PM) (Allen et al., 1998)
    and Hargreaves (Hargreaves and Samani, 1985) equations. The Hargreaves model requires
    fewer data than the PM model and can provide estimations of ET using air temperature
    as sole input (Allen et al., 1998). The most common approach to estimate actual
    water use of apple trees (ETc) is to multiply the reference ET (ETr) by a crop-specific
    coefficient (Kc) (Lakso, 2003). Osroosh et al., 2014, Osroosh et al., 2015a developed
    models based on infrared thermometry and the energy budget of a single apple leaf
    to estimate the actual and potential transpiration of whole tree. However, like
    the PM model, they require a wide range of input data. The weather-based irrigation
    scheduling has a long history of implementation using commercial irrigation controllers
    for both research (Davis et al., 2009, Davis and Dukes, 2010, Cardenas-Lailhacar
    et al., 2008, Cardenas-Lailhacar et al., 2010) and commercial applications; however,
    few research studies have investigated its application on fruit trees. In a study
    by Kisekka et al. (2010), ET-based irrigation scheduling saved significant quantities
    of water compared with a calendar-based grower’s approach of irrigation in a Carambola
    Orchard. Leaf water potential measured using a pressure bomb has long been used
    to monitor crop water status and as trigger point for irrigation (Stegman et al.,
    1976, Turner, 1988). However, this method is very tedious, labor-intensive and
    not appropriate for automation. The use of infrared temperature of plant canopies
    along with a number of ancillary meteorological measurements is an alternative
    plant-based approach (Cohen et al., 2005). Irrigation scheduling systems based
    on a feedback from crop have shown to outperform scientific-based irrigation scheduling
    using the neutron probe in row crops (O’Shaughnessy et al., 2015). Various thermal-based
    scheduling algorithms have been developed such as the crop water stress index
    (CWSI: Jackson et al., 1981, Jackson et al., 1988) and time-temperature threshold
    (TTT: Wanjura et al., 1992, Wanjura et al., 1995, Upchurch et al., 1996). CWSI
    compares the measured canopy-air temperature differences (ΔTm) with theoretically/empirically
    determined temperature differences of a non-transpiring (ΔTu) and well-watered
    (ΔTl) plants as defined by Jackson et al. (1981): (1) Different varieties of the
    CWSI have been suggested over the years including the CWSI and time threshold
    (CWSI-TT: O’Shaughnessy et al., 2012b), integrated CWSI (iCWSI: O’Shaughnessy
    et al., 2013) and CWSI-DT (Osroosh et al., 2015b). CWSI has been rarely used to
    schedule irrigation in trees (Osroosh et al., 2015b) and more often to detect
    water stress (Testi et al., 2008, Wang and Gartung, 2010, Paltineanu et al., 2013,
    Agam et al., 2013, Berni et al., 2009, Osroosh et al., 2016). The CWSI might be
    affected by many unwanted factors such as dust or passing clouds (O’Shaughnessy
    et al., 2012b); however, it has proven to be reliable if integrated into a robust
    algorithm accounting for these temporary conditions (Osroosh et al., 2015b). The
    TTT method, also patented as “BIOTIC”, requires a “time threshold” and a “temperature
    threshold.” The temperature threshold is the optimal leaf temperature for enzyme
    activity determined in lab. The time threshold is the accumulated time above the
    temperature threshold for non-stressed crop in specific climate calculated using
    experimental/simulated data. O’Shaughnessy and Evett (2010) carried out automatic
    irrigation experiments on cotton using the TTT algorithm in Texas. Peters and
    Evett (2008) used the TTT method to automate water delivery to the center pivot-irrigated
    plots of soybean. To our knowledge, no reports are available on irrigation scheduling
    of woody fruit trees using the TTT approach. Nowadays, some growers rely on wireless
    sensor networks (WSN) to obtain information remotely on a wide range of parameters
    but rarely to automatically schedule irrigations (O’Shaughnessy et al., 2013).
    In research, WSNs have been employed to collect weather, soil and environmental
    information using soil moisture, temperature, or agro-meteorological sensors,
    and to control a variety of irrigation systems (Coates and Delwiche, 2009, Kim
    and Evans, 2009, O’Shaughnessy et al., 2015, Ojha et al., 2015). A site-specific
    irrigation control system uses a WSN to monitor field variables and minimize the
    spatial variability of irrigation. In order to make the wireless technology available
    to growers, Coates et al. (2013) developed and integrated a valve actuation system
    with a commercially-available WSN. Both wired and wireless sensors network systems
    have been used in automatic irrigation scheduling (Peters and Evett, 2008, O’Shaughnessy
    and Evett, 2010, O’Shaughnessy et al., 2012a, O’Shaughnessy et al., 2013) with
    the later being more flexible, convenient and economical. Besides reducing labor
    requirements, automatic software scheduling tools are necessary for optimizing
    the amount of irrigation water in response to crop development and type, and environmental
    conditions (Casadesús et al., 2012). The software must be user-friendly and allow
    for simple management of the WSN and irrigation valves by growers (Kim and Evans,
    2009). Various computer software packages have been developed for monitoring soil
    parameters and irrigation scheduling over a wide range of irrigation systems (Stone
    et al., 1985, Hess, 1996, Abreu and Pereira, 2002). Kim and Evans (2009) developed
    decision support software to collect information from a WSN and control a site-specific
    linear-move irrigation system on a malting barley field. The aforementioned approaches
    have been widely used in research; however, farmers are still far from adopting
    them. They are eager to see reliable irrigation scheduling methods which are affordable
    and not necessarily complicated, yet accurate and suit their field and crop conditions.
    Our specific objectives here were to (i) develop fully automatic irrigation supervisory
    control and data acquisition (SCADA) system, and wireless sensor network, (ii)
    develop computer soil-, plant-, and weather-based algorithms for scheduling irrigation
    of drip-irrigated apple trees, (iii) collect information on these various strategies
    in terms of total amount of water applied, root zone soil water status (content/tension),
    plant water status (stem water potential), cost and simplicity. This paper emphasizes
    on the plant-based approaches and presents the results of a preliminary field
    evaluation in a growing season in the arid region of central Washington. 2. Materials
    and methods 2.1. Study area and irrigation system The study was conducted in a
    Fuji apple orchard on the Roza Farm of the Washington State University Irrigated
    Agriculture Research and Extension Center near Prosser, WA (46.26°N, 119.74°W)
    during the irrigation period of 2013. The region was semi-arid with an average
    annual precipitation of 217 mm and little summer rainfall. The site’s soil was
    Warden Silt Loam, ∼1-m deep limited by a rocky layer to shallower depths in some
    plots. The average volumetric water content at field capacity, θFC, was 0.33 m3
    m−3 measured as drained soil water content after a heavy irrigation event. The
    trees were spaced 4 m (row spacing) by 2.5 m (tree spacing) apart. In 2007, the
    trees were irrigated with a micro-sprinkler irrigation system (Hurricane, NaanDanJain
    Irrigation Ltd., Post Naan, Israel) with water emitters of 27 L h−1 spaced at
    2.5 m intervals. In 2013, the irrigation system was drip tubing with two lines
    of pressure compensating laterals (∼0.6 m apart) of in-line 2.0 L h−1 (equivalent
    to 1.1 mm h−1) drippers (BlueLine® PC, The Toro Company, El Cajon, CA), spaced
    at 91.4 cm intervals along the laterals. In 2013, the irrigation system was configured
    for twenty-one irrigation zones (discussed later) and flow to each zone was controlled
    with a latching solenoid valve (LSV) (Irritrol, Riverside, CA). A conservative
    value of 85% was assumed for the efficiency of the irrigation system. 2.2. Wireless
    control and monitoring system A wireless control and monitoring system was developed
    to take measurements from in-field sensors and control the on/off time of LSVs
    to create zone-specific irrigation rates in the orchard (Fig. 1). The system was
    comprised of two main components: (1) central base station (master) including
    a laptop computer and graphical user interface (GUI), and (2) six slave wireless
    nodes (sensing and valve actuation stations). The laptop was located in a room
    only 50 m far from the field. A laptop cooling pad and a backup battery were used
    to cope with room’s high temperature during the hot summer and unexpected power
    blackouts, respectively. The base station also consisted of a 900 MHz spread spectrum
    radio (model RF401, Campbell Scientific, Logan, UT) to communicate with the nodes,
    and a USB mobile broadband stick (model DataJack, Inc., Dallas, TX) to provide
    internet access. Irrigation control was managed by the base station using the
    GUI developed by the authors (discussed later). Download : Download high-res image

    control and monitoring system: a typical wireless node (a), base laptop and graphical
    user interface (GUI) (b), and weather station (c). The GUI was accessed by the
    office computer using the Teamviewer software (d). A sensing and valve actuating
    node included all or some of the following sensors and components: CR10(X) datalogger,
    solar panel, battery, Watermark™ sensors, infrared thermometers (IRTs), shielded
    air temperature probe (Air Temp), 900 MHz spread spectrum radio (RF), H-bridge
    and latching solenoid valve (LSV). The base control was made up of a laptop computer,
    dongle (USB modem) and RF. A wireless node was made up of a datalogger (model
    CR10(X), Campbell Scientific, Logan, UT), 900 MHz spread spectrum radio (model
    RF401, Campbell Scientific, Logan, UT) with 3 dBi omni-directional rubber-duck
    antenna (L-COM Inc., North Andover, MA) to transmit data to and receive control
    signals from the base, 10 W solar panel (model SYP105, Instapark Co., Santa Fe
    Springs, CA) including voltage regulator, and 12 V, 7 Ah sealed lead acid battery.
    Each node controlled up to four LSVs operated by two L298 dual H-bridge motor
    drives (Robotshop Inc., Mirabel, Quebec). Nodes were also taking readings from
    a number of in-field sensors including granular matrix sensors (model Watermark
    200SS, Irrometer Co., Riverside, CA), a soil temperature sensor (Model 107, Campbell
    Scientific, Logan, UT), shielded air temperature sensors (model 109, Campbell
    Scientific, Logan, UT), and industrial thermocouple infrared thermometers (model
    IRT/c.2: Type J, Exergen, Watertown, MA) with a field view of 35° and ±0.6 °C
    absolute accuracy. Depending on its location in the orchard, a node was comprised
    of all or only some of the aforementioned sensors. The furthest sensing and valve
    actuating station/node was located about 150 m far from the central base radio.
    The in-field sensors were scanned/sampled by the node dataloggers every 5 s and
    averaged every 15 min. The collected data by the nodes were then retrieved by
    the GUI every 15 min and time stamped. 2.3. Sensor installation and field measurements
    The air temperature probes were installed at a height of 2 m (in-line with trees).
    It is known that the rooting depth of a mature apple tree is about 70–90 cm (Atkinson,
    1980) and soil water content measurements should take place from about 10 (cultivation
    depth) to 60 cm (0.7 times effective depth of rooting) (Black et al., 2008). Taking
    this into consideration, the soil temperature probe and Watermark™ sensors were
    installed horizontally at a depth of 30 cm placed between the drip tubing laterals
    about ∼1.25 m from tree trunk. The Watermark™ sensors were soaked in water for
    two days and then installed in a soil wetted to near saturation. All the sensors
    were installed at the center of plots. The near real-time agro-meteorological
    data (air temperature, solar radiation, relative humidity, wind speed, and rainfall)
    measured at Roza weather station (located about 0.5 km away from the orchard)
    was pulled from the Washington State AgWeatherNet website. This data was used
    to calculate daily ETr and provided the supplementary measurements for the CWSI
    and TTT algorithms (discussed later). Midday Stem water potential (Ψstem) was
    measured with a pressure bomb (model 615, PMS Instrument Co., Albany, OR) once
    per week between 13:00 and 15:00. A total of six Ψstem readings (two readings
    per zone/plot per sampling day) were averaged to calculate mean Ψstem corresponding
    to a treatment. Soil water content was measured with a field-calibrated neutron
    probe (503DR Hydroprobe, Campbell Pacific Nuclear, Concord, CA) on a weekly basis.
    Soil moisture and Ψstem measurements took place in the plots under the plant-based
    treatments (CWSI and TTT). An irrigation treatment was managed using the neutron
    probe (discussed later). The IRT installation methods, neutron probe calibration,
    and Ψstem measurement procedure were similar to those described by Osroosh et
    al. (2015b). 2.4. Irrigation scheduling algorithms The computer algorithms required
    for implementing seven different irrigation treatments were developed based on
    main plant-, soil- and weather-based irrigation scheduling approaches and included
    feedback and feed-forward control strategies. The irrigation scheduling treatments
    were (1) a soil water budget model using a temperature-only-based ET equation
    (WB), (2) Watermark™ soil water tension sensor (SOIL), (3) a combination of WB
    and SOIL algorithms (SL + WB), (4) the scientific-based method of using neutron
    probe (NP), (5) Canopy temperature signal and the TTT method (TTT), (6) Canopy
    temperature signal and the CWSI-DT method (CWSI), and (7) conventional irrigation
    scheduling method in the region (CNTRL). All the strategies were completely automatic
    except for NP in which soil moisture data collected manually. The main required
    inputs to the algorithms were canopy temperature (infrared) to determine crop
    water status, soil water tension to measure soil water availability, and meteorological
    data to estimate daily water needs using ET model and to calculate theoretical
    CWSI. These algorithm are described in the following paragraphs. 2.4.1. Soil water
    budget model and a temperature-only-based ET equation (WB) The algorithm was established
    on a simple soil water balance (Dukes et al., 2009) and daily estimations of reference
    ET (ETr) using the Hargreaves model (Hargreaves and Samani, 1985). Reference ET
    was adjusted by local crop coefficients (Kc; Karimi et al., 2013) interpolated
    for daily values. Daily (net) irrigation water depth (Id, mm) was calculated as
    the following: (2) where Re is effective rainfall, and ETc is the crop ET (ETc
    = KcETr), all in units of mm. ETc was determined at midnight using 24-h air temperature
    data obtained from sensors installed in the orchard. For simplification, the effective
    rainfall was assumed to be equal to the amount of rainfall from the nearby weather
    station. The difference between soil water content at the beginning of the season
    (θi) and soil water content at field capacity (θFC) was added to the irrigation
    depth in the first irrigation event. ET was calculated using the FAO-56 Hargreaves
    equation (Allen et al., 1998). Twenty years worth of historical weather data and
    the ASCE Standardized PM equation (Allen et al., 2005) were used to calibrate
    the Hargreaves model for the region. Given that the drip system had a very low
    discharge rate, a threshold (Ith) was set for irrigation depth. This guaranteed
    the amount of water applied was enough to wet the whole root zone and yet avoid
    deep percolation. The irrigation water depth per application day was calculated
    according to the following model: (3) The accumulated depth over several consecutive
    days had to exceed the threshold in order for the system to schedule an irrigation
    event. 2.4.2. Soil-based irrigation using Watermark™ sensor (SOIL) This irrigation
    scheduling algorithm (Fig. 2a) was developed based on soil water potential readings
    from a Watermark™ sensor (one sensor per plot), and dry (50% depletion) and wet
    (field capacity) thresholds of −80 and −30 kPa, respectively, recommended for
    the soil type (Black et al., 2008). The field soil was assumed to be homogenous.
    Previous studies in a drip-irrigated soil have shown that the overall water status
    can be reliably extracted from single spot measurements (Rolston et al., 1991).
    An irrigation event was automatically scheduled whenever soil water potential
    exceeded the dry threshold and stopped if it reached the wet threshold. Therefore,
    the amount of applied water was dependent on the time when the wet threshold was
    reached. Download : Download high-res image (357KB) Download : Download full-size

    Watermark™ and water budget irrigation scheduling algorithm (SL + WB) (b). Varble
    and Chávez (2011) showed that diurnal soil temperature fluctuations could impact
    readings of Watermark™ sensor. A non-linear temperature compensation formula (Thompson
    and Armstrong, 1987) was applied to resistivity readings as the following: (4)
    where Rs is the measured resistance (kΩ), Ts is the soil temperature (°C), and
    PSW is the soil water potential (kPa). We did not field-calibrate the sensors
    for the soil type to comply with the common approach and ease the use of the sensors.
    2.4.3. Combination of WB and SOIL (SL + WB) This algorithm was the combination
    of the WB and SOIL algorithms similar to the algorithm proposed by Casadesús et
    al. (2012). SL + WB combines a compensating mechanism (feedback control) based
    on soil sensor readings and an estimation of water demand by a water balance method
    (feed-forward control) (Fig. 2b). SL + WB used soil water tension data to correct
    the ET model prediction of water consumption. An irrigation event was scheduled
    based on Eq. (2) and stopped whenever a soil tension of −30 kPa (wet threshold)
    was detected. 2.4.4. Canopy temperature signal and the TTT method (TTT) The TTT
    algorithm described in Evett et al. (1996) and examined in DeJonge et al. (2015)
    was the basis for the computer algorithm evaluated here. To determine the temperature
    threshold (Ttemp, °C), leaf samples were collected and sent in sealed refrigerated
    envelop to a lab in Lubbock, TX, where enzyme assays performed. The value of time
    threshold (Ttime, min) was obtained from canopy temperature and meteorological
    measurements collected over well-irrigated apple trees in 2007 in the same orchard.
    The accumulated time (t24) during 24 h was calculated as the following: (5) where
    Tm is the canopy temperature (°C) in minute m, and Ttemp is the temperature threshold.
    If t24 > Ttime then an irrigation signal was generated. The values of t24 was
    reset to 0 every day at midnight. The net irrigation depth (I) was calculated
    as twice the average crop evapotranspiration (I = 2 × ETc) in June and July (twice
    the peak crop water use), enough to wet the root zone at the highest ET rate in
    the region while avoiding deep percolation (O’Shaughnessy and Evett, 2010). 2.4.5.
    Canopy temperature signal with the crop water stress index (CWSI) The CWSI algorithm
    relied on a theoretical CWSI and a dynamic threshold. The theoretical lower and
    upper boundaries of the CWSI were calculated using biophysical models thoroughly
    detailed by Osroosh et al. (2015b). The net irrigation depth (I) was calculated
    as three times the average crop evapotranspiration (I = 3 × ETc) in June and July.
    This computer algorithm (called CWSI-DT) and its field evaluation results are
    also described in Osroosh et al. (2015b). Here, the results from the original
    experiment were compared with the rest of the approaches. 2.4.6. Scientific-based
    method of measuring soil moisture using neutron probe (NP) The NP treatment was
    assumed to represent the best irrigation scheduling practice by an advanced farmer.
    In this approach, soil water content was measured with a field-calibrated neutron
    probe on a weekly basis. Using the soil moisture readings, soil water deficit
    (SWD) to field capacity was calculated and irrigation was scheduled. The soil
    water depletion under the NP treatment was never allowed to exceed a maximum allowed
    depletion (MAD of 50%) recommended for apple trees (Allen et al., 1998). The net
    irrigation depth was calculated as I = d × [θFC − θS], where d is the rooting
    depth (d = 0.6 m), and θs is the average volumetric soil water content for d.
    Manual neutron probe readings (raw values) were entered into the GUI right after
    field measurements every Wednesday. Irrigation was automatically schdeuled based
    on the entered reading for following day. 2.4.7. Conventional irrigation scheduling
    in the region (CNTRL) In addition to the precision algorithms described, water
    delivery to a number of zones was managed using the conventional irrigation scheduling
    method of apple trees in the region. The CNTRL algorithm (Fig. 3) was designed
    to mimic the growers’ approach of using the calendar (irrigation events on specific
    days of week) and weather conditions (low, high air temperature thresholds). In
    the CNTRL algorithm, any air temperature between the maximum (TMax) and minimum
    (Tmin) thresholds would have resulted in applying Ib = 63 mm of water. If air
    temperature exceeded the maximum threshold (TMax = 32 °C) the amount of irrigation
    water would be doubled (I = 2 × Ib). If air temperature was below the minimum
    threshold (Tmin = 21 °C), the trees would receive half the usual amount of water
    (I = 0.5 × Ib). Download : Download high-res image (245KB) Download : Download

    (CNTRL). I is the amount of irrigation water applied, and Ib is the base amount
    of water which was doubled or halved depending on minimum (Tmin) and maximum (TMax)
    air temperature thresholds. 2.5. Graphical user interface A Windows-based GUI
    was developed in Microsoft VB.Net (V.2010, Microsoft Inc., Redmond, WA) to manage
    and control the irrigation system and wireless nodes. Embedded routines in CoraScript
    (V.1.1.9.8, Campbell Scientific, Logan, UT) were used to send command signals
    to the six slave nodes/dataloggers. LoggerNet (V.3.5, Campbell Scientific, Logan,
    UT) automatically downloaded data from the nodes every 15 min and populated a
    database on the laptop. The recorded data was then managed by the GUI. Fig. 4
    shows a task flowchart of systems’ software and firmware components and their
    relationship. Instead of wireless communication between the field and office computers,
    Teamviewer (V.8, TeamViewer Pty Ltd, Adelaide, Australia) was used to remotely
    access the GUI in the field. Download : Download high-res image (588KB) Download
    : Download full-size image Fig. 4. Flowchart displaying the routines performed
    by the software (LN and GUI) and firmware (Node) components of the control and
    monitoring system. The node firmware was responsible for scanning the sensors
    and sending the collected data to the base. LoggerNet (LN) regularly retrieved
    data from the nodes and recorded them in a file. The GUI used this data to run
    the irrigation algorithms, and make irrigation control decision. The GUI has a
    tabular design and comprises several tabs including: (1) a “Blocks” tab for displaying
    raw real-time data from the in-field sensors and valves on/off status, (2) a tab
    for showing real-time weather data (“Roza”), and (3) a tab for monitoring the
    commands sent out and program codes in action (“Console”). Fig. 5 shows a screenshot
    of the “Blocks” tab. The rest of the tabs were dedicated to system settings, crop
    and soil properties, sensor calibration parameters, and entering manual field
    measurements into the GUI. The GUI was capable of running in three main functioning
    modes: simulation, automatic irrigation and manual irrigation. The simulation
    and manual modes were used for the purpose of testing the system’s hardware and
    software. The simulation mode was added mainly to test the internal functions
    without having to operate the hardware. The manual mode, on the other hand, allowed
    for testing and tuning the hardware more easily. Download : Download high-res

    tab of the graphical user interface. In this tab, sensor readings taken by the
    in-field sensors and remaining irrigation time are displayed in real-time. The
    values were updated every 15 min. The GUI collected data from the sensor nodes,
    downloaded weather data from the nearby weather station, and provided a real-time
    display of the measurements in individual zones regardless of the node collecting
    them. The remaining irrigation time corresponding to each sensor/plot was displayed
    next to the sensor’s name. The GUI ran the irrigation scheduling algorithms (WB,
    SOIL, SL + WB, TTT, CWSI, NP and CTNRL) every day at midnight, and automatically
    made decisions for scheduling irrigation events for twenty-one individual zones
    within the orchard. It sent control signals to the individual data-loggers which
    opened or closed latching solenoid valves to turn the water on and off to each
    block of trees. The software also allowed for manual control of individual zones.
    The data recorded in the database by LoggerNet were automatically pulled by the
    GUI and used to execute the algorithms in parallel everyday at midnight. This
    led to generating irrigation schedules for 10:30 AM of following day. The exceptions
    were the CNTRL and NP algorithms which were, respectively, run only on Mondays
    and Wednesdays as depicted in the flowchart in Fig. 4. The decision support process
    for the SOIL and SL + WB algorithms was slightly different as a continuous monitoring
    of feedback from the in-field Watermark™ sensors (every 15 min) was required to
    determine the end of irrigation event. LoggerNet was responsible for handling
    wireless communication errors and retries. The GUI monitored dataloggers battery
    voltage levels, handled coding errors and sent alert and digestion emails to the
    user. The system routinely logged irrigation events and reported the start/stop
    time of irrigations via email to the user. Due to possible exposure of in-field
    sensors to malfunction and disturbances, sensor-specific routines automatically
    analyzed the data for any signs of failure or anomalies such as abnormally high
    or low values beyond the expected range for a variable and negative/erroneous
    sensor readings. Noise or temporary abnormal changes in values were handled by
    the software and those of serious nature were reported back to the user via email.
    Besides the software error handling, the status of the wireless network was checked
    by the user regularly. 2.6. Experimental design and statistical analysis The seven
    irrigation treatments were evaluated in a randomized complete block design with
    three replications/blocks, each plot consisting of three rows of 6 trees (21 management
    zones). The trees at the center of the plots were used for measurement purpose.
    The plots were also observed for tree health and difference in the size and quality
    of apple fruits. The statistical analysis methods included the standard error
    of the mean (SE of Mean), and analysis of variance (ANOVA) using SigmaPlot (V.11.0,
    Systat Software Inc., San Jose, CA) to test for difference among the treatments
    in terms of applied irrigation water (mm season−1). To conduct multiple comparisons
    of the means, the Bonferroni t-test was employed (at p = 0.05). 3. Results and
    discussion During the 2007 growing season when the time threshold for TTT was
    determined, maximum daily evapotranspiration (ETMax), total applied irrigation
    water (It), total rainfall (May–September), and total irrigation days (dt) were
    calculated to be 9.7 mm d−1, 1077  , 32 mm and 110 d, respectively. The theoretical
    temperature threshold returned by the lab was 10 °C and the corresponding time
    threshold to this value was 1035 min. Considering the low value determined by
    the lab, a range of time threshold (Ttime) and temperature threshold (Ttemp) values
    were plotted against each other. The temperature threshold was then chosen to
    be 22.2 °C, and an irrigation event ( ) was scheduled following a day when canopy
    temperature exceeded Ttemp = 22.2 °C for more than 225 min. The rainfall totaled
    91 mm from May through September of 2013 most of which (77 mm) occurred in May
    and July. The 2013 growing season was relatively warmer compared to the 2007 growing
    period with greater daily mean temperatures, ETr values (Table 1) and ETMax of
    14.0 . Considerable amount of rainfall received during May and June, a number
    of manual irrigation events, and presence of a perched water table in the study
    site led to the availability of enough moisture in the root zone until June (θs
    > θMAD = soil moisture at MAD). As a result, the automatic irrigation system did
    not become operational until the soil water profile reached a defined irrigation
    trigger point. The wireless control system was configured and tested during March,
    April and May, and automatically managed the water delivery to the plots during
    the rest of the season. The number of automatic irrigation days was less than
    100 d for most of the treatments. Table 1. Climatic conditions for the 2007 and

    water The ANOVA test revealed that the difference in the mean values among the
    seven irrigation treatments was significant (p < 0.001). A comparison of the treatments
    in terms of total irrigation water applied can be found in Table 2. The applied
    water for CNTRL was significantly higher than all other treatments with a value
    of 1359 mm. This was over three times (340%) the amount of water applied by NP
    (401 mm). On the other hand, SOIL resulted in the lowest mean applied water (214
    mm) which was 53% of the amount delivered by NP. WB, CWSI and TTT applied 469,
    408 and 436 mm of water, respectively (no significant difference: p = 1), which
    accounted for slightly more than 100% of water applied by NP and resulted in about
    70% water saving over the irrigation period. The WB algorithm applied significantly
    greater amount of water than SOIL (p < 0.001) and SL + WB (p = 0.004; 273 mm).
    There was no significant difference between CWSI and SL + WB (p = 0.072). SOIL
    applied significantly less amount of water than the rest of the treatments, while
    there was no significant difference between NP and SL + WB (p = 0.1). Table 2.

    c INP: total applied water for NP, ICNTRL: total applied water for CNTRL. The
    Watermark™ sensor readings showed no sign of water stress in the plots of SOIL
    and SL + WB as the soil water potential fluctuations were within the range of
    0 to −80 kPa (Fig. 6a). However, field inspections disclosed that the trees under
    the SL + WB algorithm may have been severely water-stressed as leaf drop and loss
    of turgidity, trees reduced overall growth, and abnormally small fruits in these
    plots were evident. Having under-irrigated the trees, SOIL and SL + WB exhibited
    an insufficient response to water stress. The under-irrigation of the plots under
    SOIL can be explained by the fact that the soil sensors monitored only a limited
    volume of the soil profile and might have not been at a location where the root
    system was active (Cohen et al., 2005). The Watermark™ sensors were not calibrated
    and single predefined wet and dry thresholds were applied to all of them. In addition,
    it was difficult to make a representative tension measurement due to the heterogeneity
    of soil water distribution under the drip irrigation system. Download : Download

    of in-field Watermark™ sensors data collected using the wireless sensor network:
    mean of three plots under the SL + WB (a), and SOIL (b) treatments. The dotted
    lines show the standard error of the mean. The dashed lines show the wet (Wet
    Thresh) and dry (Dry Thresh) thresholds. Using a feed-forward ET-based scheduling
    method in combination with a soil feedback (SL + WB) did not improve irrigation
    scheduling as signals to stop irrigation were perhaps issued too soon. The general
    algorithm of Casadesús et al. (2012) suggests that the use of the water balance
    model allows for a quick response to weather changes by predicting its effects,
    while at the same time the feedback mechanism can adapt the amount of water to
    the requirements of individual orchards by compensating for prediction errors.
    However, the accuracy of feedback is very important. Currently, available soil
    water content sensors including Watermark™ sensors cannot provide the required
    precision as achievable with the neutron probe. The soil water content of the
    plots under the CWSI and TTT treatments was measured weekly as for the NP plots.
    As depicted in Fig. 7a, mean soil water deficit (SWD) in the treatment plots of
    CWSI, TTT and NP in the top 0.6 m was within the well-watered range (<MAD of 50%).
    Mean SWD in the TTT plots was significantly lower than NP (p < 0.001) which was
    in agreement with applying slightly more irrigation water under TTT (not significant).
    Seasonal courses of midday ψstem for the trees under CWSI and TTT are depicted
    in Fig. 7b. It can be seen that the trees under TTT maintained a relatively similar
    values of Ψstem to the trees under CWSI over the period. The measured values of
    Ψstem agreed well with non-stressed values reported for woody plants including
    apple trees (De Swaef et al., 2009, Naor and Cohen, 2003). As discussed in Osroosh
    et al. (2015b), the CWSI algorithm demonstrated a good response to the water status
    of the apple trees. The results here support the use of the TTT thermal-based
    approach to maintain well-watered apple trees under drip irrigation system in
    the semi-arid climate of central Washington. Download : Download high-res image

    Seasonal courses of midday ψstem in the CWSI and TTT treatments (b). The error
    bars show the standard error of the mean. The cumulative applied water for individual
    plots under TTT, WB and CWSI is illustrated in Fig. 8a and b for the growing period
    of 2013. Plots within the TTT and WB treatments had similar amounts of irrigation
    water delivered to them during the season, whereas the plots under CWSI showed
    some degree of variability. WB did not receive any feedback from the trees, thus
    microclimatic variability within the orchard was the only source of discrepancy
    among the plots and consequently the irrigation depths. The WB algorithm can lead
    to over- or under-irrigation if the estimates of crop water use are incorrect,
    the soil water content at the beginning of the season is unknown, or the application
    efficiency of irrigation system is lower than expected (Fereres et al., 2012).
    Apple trees have shown to close their stomata in response to a reduction in fruit
    loads (Palmer et al., 1997, Lakso, 2003, Girona et al., 2011). This reduction
    in evapotranspiration can challenge the WB approach as a lack of plant feedback
    may lead to significant errors in the estimations of water needs. The CWSI algorithm
    required meteorological data in addition to canopy temperature as input meaning
    it had to respond to atmospheric demand and signs of plant stress. This is while
    TTT only responded to increased canopy temperature which could be a result of
    increased air relative humidity not stomatal closure driven by water stress (Wanjura
    and Upchurch, 1997, Jones, 2004). This is reflected in TTT having a wetter soil
    profile as depicted in Fig. 7a. The CWSI algorithm, on the other hand, had a mechanism
    for withholding irrigation on humid days. It is known that CWSI values measured
    on cool and humid days are not reliable generating false stress signals and consequently
    resulting in over irrigation (Osroosh et al., 2015b). The CWSI algorithm interprets
    CWSI value in relation to the air relative humidity level and no irrigation decision
    is made on a humid day. Download : Download high-res image (274KB) Download :

    fruit yield Due to the fact that the trees were in an alternate bearing year,
    no quantitative information on the fruit yield was collected. However, our observations
    revealed that apple size in the SOIL and SL + WB treatments was noticeably smaller
    than CNTRL and never ripened (same number of fruits on trees). Larger shoot growth
    in the CNTRL treatment was observed compared with a much lower shoot and foliage
    growth in the SOIL and SL + WB treatments leading to shorter trees. The distance
    between rows in the CNTRL was covered with grass or algae and was always wet.
    This was not the case in other treatments. 3.3. Labor requirement and cost In
    the discussed control and monitoring system, the algorithms were executed using
    commercially available hardware and off-the shelf components. The major hardware
    cost included Campbell Scientific dataloggers and IRT sensors. We used an old
    model notebook as the central processing hardware which was worth roughly $100
    (U.S. dollars). The base cost of a sensing and actuating unit with the current
    hardware (datalogger, radio, battery, solar panel, actuator, 4 latching solenoids)
    is approximately $2500 in 2016. Considering the available commercial options,
    an IRT sensor adds an additional amount of $450–655 per measurement point. A soil/air
    temperature probe (without the shield) and a Watermark™ sensor can be purchased
    for $100 and $35–120, respectively. In the calculation of the cost, we replaced
    the CR10(X) with the CR1000 (Campbell Scientific, Logan, UT), and the RF401 with
    the RF401A (Campbell Scientific, Logan, UT) as they are no longer manufactured
    by the company. We obtained real-time meteorological data from a nearby weather
    station which was part of the WSU AgWeatherNet. The cost of such a station in
    case a farmer decides to invest in one is $9500 (sensors, hardware, installation,
    first year maintenance) (AgWeatherNet, 2013). Major costs for the control and
    monitoring system and alternative options for some components are summarized in
    Table 3 for comparison. A summary of the irrigation scheduling algorithms evaluated
    in the present study including the in-field sensor requirements, total upfront
    cost, advantages and shortcomings of the system are also summarized in Table 4.

    weather station is available. b This technique is manual in nature; however, we
    developed and implemented an automatic algorithm based on the original conventional
    irrigation practice. Although the GUI was designed to manage a specific orchard,
    it has the potential to be retrofitted to other irrigation systems or fields.
    Especially for research purposes, the laptop/PC and dataloggers can be replaced
    with Linux-based single-board computers such as the BeagleBone Black (BeagleBoard.org
    Foundation, Oakland Twp, MI), and the spread-spectrum radio with the XBee RF module
    (Digi International, Minnetonka, MN) to significantly reduce the cost. A network
    of inexpensive air temperature sensors can provide enough microclimatic data for
    estimation of ET. The WB algorithm requires only an air temperature sensor with
    no need for calibration which keeps the labor and capital investments very low.
    CWSI needs a network of infrared thermometers and meteorological sensors with
    no need for site-specific calibration. From both research and practice perspectives,
    the upfront cost and labor requirements of both CWSI and TTT are relatively low;
    however, regular maintenance (mainly cleaning) of IRTs is necessary to keep the
    network up and running. Despite the low sensor cost and ease of implementation,
    SOIL and SL + WB did not show to be reliable in terms of delivering enough water
    to stressed trees or detecting stress on-time. To achieve higher accuracies, using
    a larger number of Watermark™ sensors to account for sources of variability, site-specific
    calibration of individual sensors, or a combined use of soil water potential and
    soil water content sensors appears to be necessary. The maintenance was a major
    issue with the soil sensors wiring. There were several cases of wire damage accidents
    due to animal rodent activity in the field. Wireless IRTs (O’Shaughnessy et al.,
    2013) and less commonly wireless soil sensors are alternatives to wired sensors
    which will also lead to reduced installation and maintenance cost. These results
    support the suitability of simple irrigation scheduling techniques like WB for
    the automatic irrigation of apple orchard. Approaches like CWSI, TTT and WB are
    slightly more expensive, however they provide a higher degree of reliability compared
    to SOIL or SL + WB strategies. 4. Conclusions In this study, we developed and
    initially evaluated seven irrigation scheduling algorithms including two well-known
    plant/thermal-based strategies of the Time and Temperature Threshold (TTT) and
    Crop Water Stress Index (CWSI). Irrigation water delivery was automatically scheduled
    to twenty-one management zones in an apple orchard using a wireless control and
    monitoring system. Precision irrigation algorithms were compared with the scientific-based
    method of irrigation scheduling using neutron probe and the conventional approach
    in the region in terms of ability to improve the current practice and simplicity
    of implementation from grower’s perspective. Our preliminary results supported
    the use of weather- and plant-based algorithms, decision support and monitoring
    software, and wireless sensor network for automatic irrigation management of drip-irrigated
    apple trees. The weather- and plant-based algorithms evaluated here were able
    to deliver enough irrigation water to the apple trees and avoid water stress.
    The soil-based approaches, on the other hand, failed to deliver enough water to
    the trees which resulted in severe water stress and impaired growth. The weather-
    and plant-based methods exhibited a promising performance at the level of the
    scientific irrigation scheduling method in terms of applying precise amount of
    water when needed and had the great advantage of being fully automatic. While
    the weather-based control algorithm showed a similar performance to the plant-based
    methods under the conditions of the experimental site, we believe a control algorithm
    with plant feedback is a superior choice when it comes to site- and crop-specific
    precision. However, the weather-based approach is a better choice when lower cost
    and complexity are more important to growers. This was an initial step towards
    implementing automatic irrigation on drip-irrigated apple trees. The presented
    irrigation scheduling approaches have the potential to improve water use efficiency,
    increased production, reduced production costs, reduced pumping energy requirements,
    and improved quality. Here, we mainly examined the various hardware and software
    aspects of a SCADA system and the suitability of the irrigation scheduling algorithms
    for maintaining well-watered trees. Future studies will reveal more on their benefits
    for decreasing losses of water and nutrients to deep percolation and their effect
    on yield and fruit quality. Acknowledgments This research was funded by the US

    promising performance in terms of delivering the right amount of water to the
    plants and avoiding water stress.
  - The WB algorithm, which is based on a simple soil water balance, also showed good
    performance, but it does not have the ability to respond to plant feedback.
  - The SOIL and SL + WB algorithms, which rely on soil water tension sensors, failed
    to deliver enough water to the trees, resulting in severe water stress and impaired
    growth.
  limitations: 'The study was conducted in a semi-arid region of central Washington,
    so the results may not be generalizable to other climates.

    The study was conducted over a single growing season, so the long-term performance
    of the algorithms is not known.

    The study did not evaluate the economic benefits of the different algorithms.'

    Metrics and citations Figures and tables Abstract The Internet of things (IoT)
    is the next technological revolution that includes many industries and applications.
    IoT can offer solutions for many problems. However, it requires many skills from
    different disciplines that current electrical and computer engineers lack. In
    order to encourage the seamless internalization of the IoT and the technologies
    it supports, a new method should be considered in training electrical and computer
    engineers. The new methods should focus on applications and projects that involve
    the use of components such as hardware, software, and cloud platforms that are
    available in the market rather than class oriented theories. In this study, we
    introduce a methodology for teaching an IoT systems course that will encourage
    students to study how to develop and accomplish IoT applications in real time,
    at a reasonable cost, and for general use rather than meeting the detailed needs
    of one merchant. We exploit universally available open source software and cloud
    platforms to enhance teaching IoT course. The proposed course is taught at the
    undergraduate level in the computer engineering departments of Kocaeli and Sakarya
    Universities in Turkey. The results show that the designed method can have a constructive
    influence on the progress of computer engineering education by timely and positive
    assistance in educating the new IoT engineers. Introduction In today’s highly
    technological world, the Internet of things (IoT) is one of the most popular topics
    associated with life in smart cities.1 Exploiting intelligent objects for smart
    city facilities can enhance the growth of smart cities, smart connectivity, smart
    monitoring, smart agriculture, etc. IoT is an interdisciplinary engineering area
    that incorporates sensing, networking, computing, and controlling the abilities
    related to smart objects to initiate progress and meet significant challenges.2
    Typically, IoT technology has four fundamental requirements. It needs (i) a common
    interpretation of the status of users and devices, (ii) software architectures
    and communication networks to route and transmit connected knowledge to places
    where it can be best utilized, (iii) analytical tools to extract autonomous and
    smart behavior, and (iv) hardware devices that can carry out all these operations
    in real time.3 When these four, major demands are in place, smart connectivity
    and background-aware computation can be achieved. Due to the growth of wireless
    connectivity, IoT, wearable computing, and embedded sensor technologies, producing
    massive amounts of data, big data, and cloud computing concepts focus on the IoT.4,5
    Accordingly, IoT systems can be regarded as an engineering discipline that integrates
    traditional computer engineering and modern information technology engineering.
    Thus, computer engineering solutions have a primary function in the improvement
    of IoT solutions, and computer engineers suggest new ideas for increasing the
    value of IoT technology.6,7 The ubiquitous use of IoT technology and the growing
    market demand for it have inspired new IoT experts to explore ways to maximize
    it. However, in the education sector, little attention has been paid to educating
    the next generation of IoT experts. Some of the fundamental barriers to educating
    IoT experts include designing an IoT education curriculum and choosing a practical
    way to teach IoT courses.8–10 This study proposes a method for designing a real-time
    IoT systems course in computer engineering education at the undergraduate level.
    The proposed course consists of real-time experiments and term projects. It was
    offered by the Faculty of Engineering and the Faculty of Computer and Information
    Sciences, of Kocaeli University and Sakarya University, respectively. This course
    covered the following topics; a theoretical background of IoT such as the general
    view of IoT, machine-to-machine (M2M) versus IoT, IoT business models and application
    fields, IoT cloud platforms, IoT communication and enabling technologies such
    as Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) and Near Field Communication (NFC), Bluetooth
    Low Energy (BLE), wireless sensor networks (WSNs), Z-Wave, ANT/ANT+, Wi-Fi and
    ESP8266, and cellular networks, IoT communication protocols such as REpresentational
    State Transfer (REST), Simple Object Access Protocol (SOAP), Extensible Messaging
    and Presence Protocol (XMPP), Constrained Application Protocol (CoAP), Message
    Queuing Telemetry Transport (MQTT), Advanced Message Queuing Protocol (AMQP),
    and Data Distribution Service (DDS), and big data in IoT and cloud computing.
    The undergraduate students then applied this academic background to develop and
    conduct real-time IoT experiments. The 10 required laboratory experiments were
    designed to provide the students with real-time system practice related to IoT
    devices and cloud platforms. The laboratory experiments utilized appropriate real-time
    system explanations to guide students between IoT technology and real-time applications.
    The contributions of the proposed course are that it provides students with an
    opportunity to gain high-level skills, enhance their knowledge about a wide range
    of advances in IoT technology, and implement strategies to develop their own IoT
    system solutions in real time. The rest of this paper is organized as follows:
    the upcoming section introduces an overview of current research publications regarding
    education on IoT technologies. Next section describes the IoT systems course strategy,
    adopted by the learning results of the course and laboratory experiments. Further,
    we define the implementation of the term project activities in IoT system course.
    Subsequently, an evaluation and assessment of the designed IoT system course are
    presented. The implications and conclusions of the study are discussed in the
    last section. Related work IoT refers to the network of electronic devices of
    variable sizes that exploit the Internet for communication by using different
    protocols, domains, medium, and applications.11 The IoT is a new paradigm of communication
    that requires objects to be enabled with microcontrollers, transceivers, and protocol
    stacks for communication2,12,22,28 Statistics show that the number of IoT devices
    increases annually; i.e. it is anticipated that in 2020, the number of IoT devices
    will range between 50 and 100 billion.13 Moreover, it is anticipated that more
    than $300 billion will be generated by IoT products and services in 2020.9 IoT
    devices will be integral to the Internet and will change our way of living significantly.
    Accordingly, the global demand for IoT experts rises annually, and it is anticipated
    to reach 4.5 million by 2020.14 IoT systems require a combination of different
    programming languages and protocols.15 Generally, there are three IoT components,
    which enable the implementation IoT systems such as (i) hardware like sensors,
    (ii) middleware for storage, computing, and data analytics, (iii) presentation
    components for visualization and interpretation.16 Although the IoT industry is
    growing fast, the remarkable effort is prompted by the market needs. Efficient
    utilization of IoT technology can mitigate problems such as home automation and
    smart farming, thereby minimizing energy consumption.17 Moreover, IoT has great
    potential to unlock new applications for smart cities considering the current
    ubiquitous Internet access.1 Therefore, educating young engineers about designing
    and implementing IoT systems is very important. Furthermore, IoT engineers require
    broad knowledge and educational skills than current engineers because of IoT systems
    complexity.15 Educational challenges prompted by IoT technology include curricula
    redefinition, means of transferring knowledge, etc. Several research publications
    address the problem of designing an IoT system course considering different approaches
    as follows. Corno et al.15 presented a novel course on educating IoT professionals
    named the Ambient Intelligence course. The course equips students with the necessary
    skills required to address IoT challenges by teaching them multidisciplinary concepts
    available in IoT technology. The quest for course design for IoT technology is
    presented in Jeong et al.9 wherein the authors use the laboratory of things (LoT)
    platform. This course enables students to develop applications for real life efficiently
    using LoT. Voas et al.18 outlined the relationship between different concepts
    such as security, network, database systems, hardware, and software in IoT technology.
    An active learning course for IoT has been suggested in Raikar et al.8 wherein
    the focus is on the identification and addressing the fundamental challenges of
    teaching IoT course. These are (i) identification of course content and selection
    of the level at which IoT course should be taught, and (ii) how to involve students
    in the learning process considering the fact that IoT course requires theoretical
    and practical aspects. A practice-oriented approach is adopted by Raikar et al.8
    to teach students the designing of IoT applications and services. This is achieved
    by identifying and solving real-world problems. The importance and effectiveness
    of learning through practical in IoT are observed in Sim and Choi10 and Corno
    and de Russis.19 The design of a new curriculum for Industrial Internet of Things
    (IIoT) is investigated in Watteyne et al.20 The focus of this study is to exploit
    IPv6 over the time slotted channel hopping (6TiSCH) stack in teaching students
    IIoT requirements. A film scene interdisciplinary course is introduced in Hwang
    et al.,21 focusing on training students to understand the critical functions of
    IoT and develop IoT applications. The effectiveness of the course suggested in
    Hwang et al.21 is measured through qualitative and quantitative analysis. Unlike
    existing research publications, this study presents an IoT course design with
    real-time laboratory experiments and terms projects. To the authors’ knowledge,
    this is the first research publication that addresses this problem considering
    this approach. With this study, students can use multiple technologies (at least
    three different IoT cloud platforms, different object “phones, Arduino, embedded
    system, etc.”) to develop the IoT application. The IoT systems course and laboratory
    experiments The IoT systems course is a three-credit course planned for senior-level
    undergraduate students. It includes two hours class session every week. The course
    is designed to offer an introduction to the IoT technology, increase the students’
    understanding of basic networking concepts, and software development techniques.
    Moreover, the course enables students to understand how different technologies
    are combined to produce complete IoT systems. The goal of the laboratory experiments
    and term projects is to reinforce the students’ comprehension of academic materials.
    The proposed IoT system course consists of 12 topics. The IoT systems course assembly,
    content, estimated result, and time provided for each topic are presented in Table
    1. In addition, the course is intended for IT engineers, and students must meet
    specific prerequisites to enroll such as basic knowledge of software programming,
    network management, embedded systems, and the IoT. A theoretical understanding
    of big data and cloud platforms is also mandatory. Table 1. IoT course assembly,

    In this experiment, basic concepts in cloud platform are presented to students
    in a mobile application environment through the observation of data sent, data
    receive, and notification. A mobile application with Firebase database cloud platform
    is designed using MIT App Inventor26 as shown in Figure 1. This mobile application
    stores and retrieves a text value to and from the Firebase database when the read
    or write button is pressed. Students create projects in Firebase cloud platform
    and MIT App Inventor 2. Experiment 1 MIT App inventor blocks are depicted in Figure
    2. The experiment is based on the observation of these blocks; students are also
    required to develop their application that is connected with Firebase database.
    The benefit of using the MIT App Inventor environment to teach students the fundamental
    concepts is double. Firstly, students understand the use of necessary components
    that are commonly used in the IoT systems in order to constitute IoT systems.
    Secondly, students concentrate on IoT systems instead of the difficulties of android
    programming. Figure 1. Application scenario of experiment 1. Figure 2. Application
    implemented with MIT App Inventor 2 blocks interface. Understanding BLE Beacon
    in IoT systems The primary target of this experiment is to teach students a typical
    BLE application in IoT systems and its properties. Students understand how to
    generate Beacon frames and how to capture these frames with mobile phone-based
    application. A mobile phone application presented in Figure 3 can be used for
    observing BLE address, Universally Unique Identifier (UUID), and received signal
    strength indicator (RSSI). The analysis of the BLE technology is first performed
    by a BLE beacon, which is in the range of mobile phones Bluetooth. When the scan
    button is pressed, the phone turns on its Bluetooth, scanning Bluetooth devices
    in the environment. When the beacon devices list button is clicked, the search
    signal devices are listed. Connect button displays the medium access control (MAC)
    address, UUID, and RSSI information of the beacon device in the Beacon Information
    field. Moreover, a notification is shown when the connection is established. The
    click button disconnects the Bluetooth connection from the BLE beacon. This experiment
    is suitable for students who need to learn the use of MIT App Inventor BLE extension
    alongside the BLE Beacon. Figure 3. Example scenario of understanding BLE beacon
    detection. Who are lucky people? Use of BLE, Cloud, and mobile application Bluetooth
    low energy module, mobile phones, and cloud platforms are some of the primary
    hardware components that are widely used in IoT systems. Training their functionalities
    and appearances is the key target of this experiment. Students build a real-time
    scenario to realize the behavior of each of these components. In this experiment,
    the students use Beacon, Firebase, MIT App Inventor 2, MIT App Inventor 2 Companion,
    BLE extension for MIT App Inventor 2 technologies and devices. All instructions
    are uploaded by students with an experiment document. When the mobile application
    user enters the coverage area of the Beacon, this application connects the beacon
    device and receives a welcome notification message. Then, the mobile user connects
    to the database provided by the Firebase cloud platform, reads the “number” value
    that holds the number of users, and writes it back by increasing the value to
    the database using the written MIT App Inventor blocks as shown in Figure 4. If
    the number of users reaches a certain value, which is selected to be three in
    this experiment, the user is assumed as a lucky user, and feedback is given with
    a specific picture notification. In this experiment, students can see the MAC
    address of BLE device using Beacon manager program which is available on play
    store. In the final section of the experiment, a real-time scenario in which all
    components stated above is used. Figure 4. Application implemented with MIT App
    Inventor 2 blocks interface. NFC read-and-write process: Real-time contactless
    payment application Most numbers of smartphones have NFC, which is short-range
    wireless technology. NFC has made many applications such as contactless payment,
    public transportation payment systems, input/output control system, etc. NFC cards
    can be read-only, readable, and writable. Teaching and prototyping NFC functionalities
    on the real-time application are the core objective of this experiment. This experiment
    consists of a mobile application that can be called contactless payment, a readable
    and writable NFC card, which charges the desired payment and decreases its value
    in each reading and Firebase cloud platform keeps the number value up to date.
    Figure 5 depicts the experiment scenario with real-time interaction between the
    experiment components. Since the NFC add-on is a component that is not seen directly
    on the screen, it appears under the screen under nonvisible components in the
    designer page as shown in Figure 6. The application has three basic parts: writing
    data to NFC tag (credit charge), reading NFC tag (decrease and update credit),
    and Firebase cloud (update user information). First, the user can enter the charge
    value in the “Please enter the quantity you want to charge” text box field for
    loading credit. Then, when the download button is pressed, Button 1, click operations
    are performed. The value in the textbox is transferred to the global credit variable,
    followed by the NFC write operation set.NearField1.TextToWrite. During the write
    operation, ReadMode is false. Finally, NearField1.TagWritten status occurs when
    the write operation is complete. Then ReadMode is true for reading and credit
    charged is displayed. Figure 5. Application scenario of experiment 4 with the
    mobile application, cloud platform, and NFC card. Figure 6. Application implemented
    with MIT App Inventor 2 blocks interface. Mobile IoT button application with ESP8266
    Wi-Fi-integrated Wemos D1 mini The target of this experiment is to inform students
    how IoT devices receive requests from cloud platforms in order to interact with
    the mobile application. A mobile application programmed with MIT App Inventor
    and Wemos D1 mini with LED connection structure depicted in Figure 7. These two
    components are connected by Wi-Fi technology to the Firebase cloud platform in
    this laboratory experiment. Students are asked to change the status of the LED
    via the mobile application. This experiment teaches and tests students’ ability
    to use the open source Arduino software (IDE)27 in order to experience the ESP8266
    Wi-Fi module. Students use the instructions provided to define the ESP8266 module
    in the Arduino IDE environment, to add Firebase libraries to the Arduino application,
    to build and install the created projects. The attention of the previous experiments
    has been to explain students the use of numerous IoT components. This experiment
    teaches students how to use the supplied components in order to examine the basic
    request methods of IoT in a realistic scenario. In the final section of the experiment,
    when the switch on button is clicked, “true” is entered in the Led folder, which
    is created in the Firebase platform, and when the switch off button is clicked,
    “false” information is transmitted. Moreover, according to the button pressed
    on the label part, turn on or turn off information appears. Figure 7. System architecture
    and components used in experiment IV. Temperature monitoring with ThingSpeak cloud
    platform The IoT course laboratory experiment 6 introduces the ThingSpeak cloud
    platform and implements the communication between Wemos D1 mini and ThingSpeak
    database as shown in Figure 8. In this context, reading through the LM35 temperature
    sensor specification is an option. We design an application that monitors data
    with ThingSpeak, mainly focusing on the GET method on Arduino IDE. The procedure
    is as follows: Step 1. Students are first asked to open a new channel to monitor
    the environment temperature in real time. Step 2. Students need to get information
    to write and read the API key. Step 3. Students are asked to create GET method
    on Arduino IDE as “GET/update?key=Write Api Key&Field Name=”. Step 4. Students
    need to compile and load the Arduino code with wireless local area network (WLAN)
    service set identifier (SSID) and password information on the Wemos D1 mini. Step
    5. Final phase of the experiment is to test the system using ThingSpeak cloud
    platform graphical user interface. Figure 8. Final setup and components for experiment
    V. Real-time temperature monitoring with android programming This experiment allows
    students to use Firebase to test mobile apps, which are created with Atom and
    PlatformIO aiming at helping students to identify the difference between the MIT
    App Inventor 2 and Android programming. Atom is a text editor to write the Arduino
    codes. PlatformIO provides an open source environment for IoT system development.
    Students are required to follow the procedure of this experiment as follows. Step
    1. Students create a Firebase project with Firebase URL and database API key.
    Step 2. Students create a new PlatformIO project with Arduino framework. To use
    Firebase, students need to copy the lib folder in the project file to the https://github.com/firebase/firebase-arduino
    link. After connecting the D2 port of the Wemos D1 mini to the DHT22 sensor, the
    Arduino code is connected with WIFI_SSID and WIFI_PASSWORD. Step 3. The Firebase
    connection is made with the values FIREBASE_HOST and FIREBASE_AUTH. Example application
    code which is presented to the student as a laboratory manual is shown in Figure
    9. Step 4. Once these steps are completed, the mobile application is created by
    the students to provide the connection of the IoT system designed in this experiment.
    Students are then instructed to set up Gradle. This platform is a general purpose
    build management system based on Groovy and Kotlin. The following line should
    be added to the permission file to enable the application to connect to the internet
    using Gradle. Later, Gradle files are configured for Android dependencies. Lastly,
    students implement to link to the Firebase on creating and override in database
    methods as: <uses-permission android:name=“android.permission.INTERNET”/> Figure
    9. Arduino example code written by PlatformIO for experiment VI. ThingSpeak communication
    between IoT device and GSM (SIM900) module This experiment allows students to
    collect environment temperature and humidity data, and send text messages through
    mobile phone. Students use GGS01-GSM/GPS Arduino-based GSM-GPS shield, Arduino
    MEGA, DHT11 sensor, Arduino IDE, and ThingSpeak components to build a real-time
    IoT system. This GPRS-based IoT device transmits the message using the onboard
    SIM900 GSM module. The first step of this application is to plug the GSM shield
    and connect the sensor to the Arduino MEGA device. Afterward, students add Arduino
    GSM shield library and select this device on Arduino IDE. Then, students write
    Arduino code for the transfer of both temperature and humidity information to
    ThingSpeak platform. Students need to write codes with the AT commands for the
    methods for transmitting both temperature and humidity data to ThingSpeak, the
    specification, identification data rate, and so on of the GSM Shield. For example,
    the following commands used students for this experiment would configure the basic
    settings for GSM-GPS shield shown in Figure 10. Figure 10. Arduino example code
    written by Arduino IDE for experiment VII. IoT application with MQTT protocol
    using Adafruit The resilience of IoT networks strongly depends on communication
    technologies and protocols. MQTT is a telemetry messaging protocol based on broadcast
    and subscribe methods. This protocol is most commonly used to communicate between
    M2M systems. Unlike the existing protocols, it is more lightweight and can be
    easily used in many platforms. This experiment describes the MQTT protocol by
    depicting it in terms of publish and subscribe methods. It considers the Adafruit
    cloud platform and provides the details of communication between Wemos D1 mini
    and Adafruit MQTT library as shown in Figure 11. In this experiment, students
    use the Wemos D1 Mini IoT device with the ESP8266 module to transmit the ambient
    temperature information from the LM35 sensor to the Adafruit IoT platform with
    the MQTT protocol. The first step is to add the Wemos D1 device with ESP8266 to
    the Arduino IDE. In the next step, students add the relevant library to the Arduino
    IDE application using the add ZIP library option to communicate with the Adafruit
    IoT Platform using the MQTT communication protocol. Then, to create the Adafruit.io
    dashboard that provides MQTT communication protocol support, students follow the
    steps, which are adding blocks for chart or slider and creating Adafruit input-output
    (AIO) key. Finally, students can compile the code that includes the ESP8266 Wi-Fi
    library file, setup function, wireless networking information, MQTT server connection
    setup, Adafruit MQTT connection setup, feed settings for publish and subscribe,
    variable, and pin definitions. Figure 11. MQTT protocol system architecture used
    in experiment VIII. IoT application with CoAP protocol CoAP is an application
    layer protocol designed by Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF). This protocol’s
    primary duty is working on devices with limited resources and network bandwidth.
    CoAP works on User Datagram Protocol (UDP) to keep the design simple. It provides
    data transmission from the M2M. The target of this experiment is to understand
    the influence of CoAP protocol on IoT system performance through examining messages
    between CoAP server and client by the tools provided by the Visual Studio. Wemos
    D1 mini is assumed to run as CoAP client. Implementation of the CoAP server is
    the main responsibilities of students. This server is implemented by the console
    application created by Visual Studio. CoAP.NET is added to the project from the
    NuGet package manager. After creating a resource that identifies CoAP packages,
    the main code can activate the resource. CoAP protocol application scenario includes
    the CoAP server and client is presented in Figure 12. Students can implement and
    understand this protocol clearly by examining energy consumption and throughput.
    In this experiment, the temperature is determined using the Wemos D1 mini and
    LM35 sensor as in experiment 9. However, in this experiment, a computer that serves
    as a CoAP server is added. Adding the Wemos D1 device with ESP8266 to the Arduino
    IDE and loading the CoAP library to the Arduino IDE are the basic steps of this
    experiment. To open the library as an application, students can click New> Examples>
    Esp-CoAP Simple library> coapclient. This client example is used to generate a
    CoAP client in the IoT device. Figure 12. COAP protocol IoT application system
    architecture. Implementation of the term project activities IoT system term projects
    enable students’ improvement and assessment. Table 3 shows IoT course term project
    schedule. Students are allowed to select a project subject related to the defined
    equipment list, and technological requirement as indicated in Table 4. Each term
    project subject must be accepted by the course instructor considering the recent
    trend in IoT systems. Upon successful completion of the laboratory experiments
    and class lectures, students can have used to the laboratory equipment for an
    additional amount of time in order to conclude their projects on schedule. The
    business model of IoT systems (Canvas), IoT communication technologies (RFID,
    NFC, BLE, Wi-Fi, GSM, 3G), IoT cloud platforms (Firebase, ThingSpeak, Samsung
    Artık, Adafruit), IoT sensors (temperature, humidity, motion, light), IoT communication
    protocols (MQTT, CoAP), mobile application environments (Android, MIT App Inventor)
    are some examples of the equipment and required technologies in the term projects.
    Students are required to present their term project effectively with the list
    of equipment, hardware and software tools provided, in front of their colleagues.
    A detailed report summarizing the estimated results of the project study is also
    expected from the students at the end of the semester. The term projects objectives

    a wireless sensor network using Linux-based board Raspberry pi and IoT board ESP8266.
    Raspberry Pi board and ESP8266 module are used as the main network server and
    communicate with the primary server, respectively. The ultrasonic sensor is generated
    a real-time event for this system. Project-2: To adjust the brightness on the
    red green blue (RGB) led according to the values taken from the light sensor according
    to the light intensity in the real environment. At the same time, the temperature
    and humidity values obtained from the DHT11 sensor using the MQTT protocol are
    published on the Adafruit.io using the MQTT broker. Moreover, all sensor values
    are displayed on the phone using the mobile phone application, which subscribes
    on Adafruit.io using the broker. Project-3: To measure and investigate temperature,
    pressure, and humidity in real time, and to generate alerts using mobile communication
    technology in case of crossover of these parameters beyond their predefined values.
    The data from the sensors are transferred to the virtual server via the ESP8266
    module in real time. The data from the PHP server of the virtual server are logged
    in MySQL and checked instantly. When the alarm condition occurs, the virtual server
    uses GGS01-GSM/GPS Arduino-based GSM-GPS module to alert the user with a text
    message. Project-4: To show an economical and easy way of using an embedded system
    based irrigation system. The data received from the humidity sensors, which are
    periodically recorded in the Firebase cloud platform via the NodeMCU, ensure that
    the soil is sufficiently watered by opening the water flow valve when it reaches
    the specified threshold value. Project-5: To monitor and control sensors and actuators
    for smart home systems. With the developed mobile application, the Led Open button
    is pressed; the message that the related led is be opened and published by the
    MQTT protocol. The Arduino-based device that subscribes to this broadcast opens
    the LED that is connected to the output port. Similarly, the LED can be switched
    off. In addition, the ambient temperature is determined by the LM35 sensor. The
    temperature information can be monitored in real time on the telephone on which
    the application is subscribed. Project-6: To design a mobile application for monitoring
    ambient parameters. Real-time data from the DHT22 sensor are sent to the Firebase
    platform via the ESP8266 module and displayed at the real-time in the Android
    app which is developed with Atom and PlatformIO. Project-7: To develop the smart
    health platform prototype that activates monitoring of heart rate and inter-beat
    interval for several topics. Real-time data from the pulse sensor are sent to
    the ThingSpeak via the Wemos D1 module. With this project, students demonstrate
    the potential realization of mass monitoring of biomedical data that is interested
    in the IoT and cyber-physical systems. Project-8: To implement the real-time alert
    system prototype ESP8266-based Wi-Fi module NodeMCU (12E). Four sensors, which
    are temperature and humidity sensor (DHT11), the pressure sensor (BMP180), raindrop
    module, and light-dependent resistor (LDR), are connected to the NodeMCU. When
    these values exceed a threshold limit, an e-mail and a Tweet message are issued
    to alert the owner of the system to take necessary precautions. Project-9: This
    project supposes a prototype for applying the IoT to smart traffic systems. The
    smart traffic system is applied using roadside units (RSU) with roughness monitoring,
    vehicles with environmental sensors and a database for data transfer through different
    platforms. The traffic system informs users about the road condition, i.e. wet,
    dry, snowy, or icy by using the developed friction monitoring units. Project-10:
    To develop a novel garage door gate prototype for opening the gate automatically.
    The system consists of two Bluetooth modules for car and gate operations. It shows
    the current station of the door using the ESP8266 Wi-Fi module at the ThingSpeak
    platform. When the vehicle defined in the system is within recognizable proximity,
    the two Bluetooth modules communicate with each other, and the door opens automatically.
    A total of 20 groups finished the course term projects and presented in the class.
    Figure 13 depicts samples of some of the presented projects. At the end of the
    course, a term project showcase event was conducted. Three project groups won
    awards in the showcase affair. The first, the second, and the third prizes were
    assigned to “Smart Garage Door System”, “IoT-based Weather Station”, and “Implementation
    of Heart Rate Monitoring” teams, respectively. Figure 13. Student implementation
    examples of the term project. Evaluation of the IoT course The evaluation of designing
    the IoT systems course falls into two steps. In the first step, students are requested
    to fill out a survey on their opinions, experiences, and evaluations. The second
    step considers the improvement of student learning and the developed application
    performance. In the 2017/2018 and 2018/2019 academic years, approximately 400
    students have been enrolled in the IoT and the IoT and application courses at
    the computer engineering programs of Kocaeli and Sakarya Universities to evaluate
    the designing of the IoT systems course. Table 5 presents the survey of students’
    response results with the mean (µ) and standard deviation (σ). The first group
    of survey questions is getting feedback for theoretical concept knowledge of IoT
    systems. Seven questions of this group are responded with generally positive results,
    whereby the mean is four and, the standard deviation of less than one. To compare
    the results of the pre- and post-courses knowledge, we have asked an overall question
    for this group. The mean pre-course result of this question is 2.18 of 5, with
    a standard deviation of 1.12 and 95% confidence interval. Contrarily, the mean
    post-course result is 4.23 of 5, with a standard deviation of 0.86 and 95% confidence
    interval. The second group of survey questions indicates student’s practical experience
    in IoT systems. The students have graded mean 4.57 and 3.56 for questions 9 and
    14 with the highest mean and lowest mean values, respectively. In evaluating practical
    experience on IoT systems, the mean pre-course results is 1.1, standard deviation
    is 1.5, and 95% confidence interval. Contrarily, the mean post-course results
    is 3.96, the standard deviation is 0.73, and 95% confidence interval. An average
    evaluation that students achieved on the pre-course are 1.94 of 5, with a standard
    deviation of 1.34 and 95% confidence interval. An average evaluation that students
    achieved on the post-course are 4.15 of 5, with a standard deviation of 0.84,
    and 95% confidence interval. According to the results of the survey, the proposed
    course has a significant effect when compared with the pre-course. Table 5. IoT

    and their real-time application development using different kinds of IoT components,
    such as sensors, embedded system cards, cloud platforms, software toolkits, etc.
    The IoT system course seeks to: (i) introduce students to recent trends in real-time
    IoT systems and their application areas, (ii) implement real-time IoT systems
    by using different IoT components and programming via mobile application software
    platforms, (iii) require students to design and implement real-time IoT systems,
    and (iv) familiarize students with real-time IoT engineering problems. The proposed
    IoT system course consists of 12 main topics, which are supported by 10 real-time
    IoT applications. Students enrolled in the IoT system course work in groups to
    complete a term project. The designed course was successfully offered at Kocaeli
    University and Sakarya University in 2017/2018 and 2018/2019, respectively. Students
    who attended this course found it very motivating, beneficial, and easy to learn.
    Consequently, a large number of engineering students became familiar with the
    field of real-time IoT systems. This course also provides students with the skills
    they need to develop technologies that can influence the IoT technology. Declaration

    Abstract Irrigation water supplies are decreasing in many areas of the US Great
    Plains, which is requiring many farmers to consider deficit-irrigating corn (Zea
    mays L.) or growing crops like winter wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) that require
    less water, but that are less profitable. The objectives of this study were to:
    (1) quantify the yield response of corn to deficit irrigation, and (2) determine
    which of several seasonal water variables correlated best to corn yield in a semiarid
    climate. Eight (T1–T8) and nine (T1–T9) deficit-irrigated treatments (including
    dryland), were compared in 2003 and 2004 in North Platte, Nebraska. The actual
    seasonal crop evapotranspiration (ETd) (calculated with procedures in FAO-56)
    for the different treatments was 37–79% in 2003 and 63–91% in 2004 compared with
    the seasonal crop evapotranspiration when water is not limited (ETw). Quantitative
    relationships between grain yield and several seasonal water variables were developed.
    Water variables included, irrigation (I), total water (Wall), rain + irrigation
    (WR+I), evaporation (E), crop evapotranspiration (ETd), crop transpiration (Td),
    and the ratios of ETd and Td to evapotranspiration and transpiration when water
    is not limited (ETw and Tw). Both years, yield increased linearly with seasonal
    irrigation, but the relationship varied from year to year. Combining data from
    both years, ETd had the best correlation to grain yield (yield = 0.028ETd–5.04,
    R2 = 0.95), and the water variables could be ranked from higher to lower R2 when
    related to grain yield as: . Crop water productivity (CWP) (yield per unit ETd)
    linearly increased with ETd/ETw (R2 = 0.75), which suggests that trying to increase
    CWP by deficit-irrigating corn is not a good strategy under the conditions of
    this study. Previous article in issue Next article in issue Keywords EvapotranspirationDeficit

    Introduction Irrigation water supplies are decreasing in many areas of the Great
    Plains of the USA. Some of the reasons for this decrease include extended drought
    periods, decline in groundwater levels (McGuire, 2004, McGuire and Fischer, 1999),
    litigation among states related to surface water allocations, and diversion of
    water from irrigation to environmental uses (Lingle and Franti, 1998). This situation
    is forcing farmers to consider the options of deficit-irrigating crops like corn
    or growing alternative crops like winter wheat that require less irrigation water,
    but that are generally less profitable. Knowing the quantitative response of crops
    to limited water supplies under specific environments is critical to be able to
    perform economic comparisons among local cropping options. In the US Great Plains,
    developing local and current information on water–yield relationships is particularly
    important for corn (Zea mays L.), since this crop covers more irrigated area than
    any other crop in the region (Norwood, 2000). Deficit irrigation creates water
    stress that can affect the growth and development of corn plants. The response
    of corn plants to water stress has been shown to change with hybrid (Lorens et
    al., 1987) and can be affected by improving technological level (Dale and Daniels,
    1995). Effects of water stress on corn include the visible symptoms of reduced
    growth, delayed maturity, and reduced crop yield. For instance, water stress has
    been shown to reduce corn canopy height (Denmead and Shaw, 1960, Gavloski et al.,
    1992, Traore et al., 2000), leaf area index (NeSmith and Ritchie, 1992, Traore
    et al., 2000), and root growth (Gavloski et al., 1992, Jama and Ottman, 1993).
    Jama and Ottman (1993) found that stressing corn during the vegetative stage in
    an arid environment hindered root development, which restricted deep water uptake.
    However, in a wetter environment in eastern Nebraska, Newell and Wilhelm (1987)
    found that although a fully irrigated corn treatment had greater total profile
    (0–1.5 m) and surface (0–0.15 m) root length at the reproductive stage, dryland
    and a deficit-irrigated treatments had relatively greater root length proliferation
    deep in the soil profile. The effect of water stress on reducing corn grain and
    biomass yields has also been studied (Denmead and Shaw, 1960, Traore et al., 2000).
    Grain yield can be reduced by decreasing yield components like ear size, number
    of kernel per ear, or the kernel weight. Claassen and Shaw (1970) observed that
    stress before or during silking and pollination resulted in reduced kernel number,
    while stress during or after silking reduced kernel weight. NeSmith and Ritchie
    (1992) attributed yield loss from water stress during pre-anthesis to a reduction
    in the number of well-developed kernels. Bryant et al. (1992) indicated that water
    stress reduces yield by reducing accumulated biomass and the harvest index (ratio
    of grain yield to aboveground plant dry weight). Traore et al. (2000), however,
    found that the harvest index was affected by water deficit only when stress was
    imposed during anthesis. Many researchers have evaluated the effect of stress
    timing on corn yield (Robins and Domingo, 1953, Denmead and Shaw, 1960, Barnes
    and Woolley, 1969, Downey, 1971, Claassen and Shaw, 1970, Jurgens et al., 1978,
    NeSmith and Ritchie, 1992, Bryant et al., 1992, Jama and Ottman, 1993). Others
    have developed models to quantify the effect of stress timing on yield (Jensen,
    1968, Nairizi and Rydzewski, 1977, Doorenbos et al., 1979, Doorenbos and Kassam,
    1979, Meyer et al., 1993a, Meyer et al., 1993b). For instance, Doorenbos et al.
    (1979) proposed that the effect of water stress on yield could be quantified by
    a linear function where the slope of the line (ky) was an empirical yield response
    factor that varied depending on the growth stage when water stress occurred. For
    corn, they reported ky values of 0.4, 1.5, 0.5, and 0.2 for the vegetative, flowering,
    yield formation, and ripening stages, indicating that yield was more affected
    by water stress during the flowering stage than at any other stage. This model
    suggests that if water is limited, the irrigator should time irrigation to coincide
    with the most sensitive stage. Despite the body of evidence indicating that stress
    timing has an effect on corn yield, there is also indication that corn yield is
    just a linear function of seasonal evapotranspiration (ET) or transpiration (T),
    with no regard for stress timing. For instance, good linear relationship between
    corn yield and seasonal ET have been reported by Robins and Domingo (1953), Hanks
    (1974), Hanks et al. (1976), Gilley et al. (1980), Schneekloth et al. (1991),
    Barrett and Skogerboe (1978), Stone (2003), and Klocke et al. (2004). The data
    reported by Benoit et al. (1965) also follow a linear yield-ET function with R2
    ≥ 0.79. Barrett and Skogerboe (1978) pointed out that the scatter in the published
    crop yield versus water use data largely resulted from the time of occurrence
    of water deficits in relation to the stage of growth. However, they also stated
    that if these yields are plotted versus seasonal ET rather than the quantity of
    water applied, the data would likely fall on a straight line. The objectives of
    this study were to: (1) quantify the grain yield response of corn to deficit irrigation
    and (2) determine which of several seasonal water variables correlated best to
    corn grain yield under deficit irrigation conditions in the semiarid climate of
    West-Central Nebraska. 2. Materials and methods 2.1. Site description Field data
    for this study were collected in 2003 and 2004 at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln
    West Central Research and Extension Center, North Platte, Nebraska (41.1°N, 100.8°W,
    861 m above sea level). The soil at North Platte is a Cozad silt loam (Fluventic
    Haplustolls) with field capacity of 0.29 m3 m−3 and permanent wilting point of
    0.11 m3 m−3 (Klocke et al., 1999). The corn hybrid DeKalb C57-40 RR was planted
    at 0.76-m row spacing in 2003 and Renze 9363 Bt RR was planted in 2004. These
    hybrids had comparative relative maturities that are commonly planted in the area
    and were chosen for being the top yielding hybrids in local variety trials during
    the previous year. In 2003 corn was planted on May 13, and harvested on October
    13. In 2004, corn was planted on May 10 and harvested on November 15. The experimental
    plots were located within a relatively large irrigated area. Plots were irrigated
    using a solid-set sprinkler system, which was arranged in a grid with a sprinkler
    head installed on a 3.35-m riser at each corner of each plot. Each experimental
    plot was 12.2 m × 12.2 m (148.8 m2) in size, which accommodated 16 corn rows.
    The center four rows of each plot were harvested using a plot combine. Experimental
    plots were separated from each other by 12.2-m wide border strips that were also
    planted to corn. Water for the system was pumped from the Ogallala aquifer, using
    an electric turbine pump with a capacity of 600 GPM at 483 kPa of pressure. The
    mainline at the pumping station was instrumented with two pressure gauges, two
    flow meters, a pressure relief valve, a chemigation check valve, and “high” and
    “low” pressure switches. The flow meters measured both the instantaneous flow
    rate and the cumulative volume of water pumped. The irrigation system had an automatic
    control panel hard-wired to electric valves installed at each plot. Each electric
    valve controlled the four sprinklers of each plot. The control panel was also
    connected to a manual relay panel, which allowed both manual and automatic operation
    of the irrigation system. This design allowed irrigating each individual plot
    independently, and changing the randomizing of the plots from year to year to
    accommodate different experimental designs. The average weather conditions at
    North Platte during the study are shown in Table 1. In general, weather conditions
    were cooler and wetter during the 2004 growing season than in 2003. Although the
    average air temperature during June–October was only 0.6 °C cooler in 2004, it
    was approximately 2.2 °C cooler during the months of June, July, and August. These
    cooler weather conditions during 2004 delayed crop maturity and harvest about
    a month compared with 2003. Warmer conditions, however, prevailed in 2004 compared
    with 2003 during the months of May and September. Although weather conditions
    were cooler in 2004, the average of the daily grass-reference evapotranspiration
    (ETo) values for the entire May–October period was only 0.02 mm d−1 lower during
    2004 (Table 1). In 2004, the average daily ETo values were lower than 2003 during
    the months of July, August, and October, and higher during May, June, and September.
    Average daily ETo values in 2004 were particularly lower than 2003 during the
    months of July and August, which are usually the months with the peak ETo values
    for the North Platte area. Table 1. Average of daily values of maximum air temperature

    2004 (Fig. 1). A total of 22 rainfall events occurred during the 2003 growing
    season, which totaled 138 mm of water. In 2003, the total in-season rainfall was
    only enough to supply approximately 19.4% of seasonal crop water requirements
    (ETw). In 2004, however, there were 39 rainfall events, almost twice as many as
    in 2003. Rainfall in 2004 totaled 414 mm, which supplied more than half (54.5%)
    of the seasonal crop water requirements. Download : Download full-size image Fig.

    treatments The experiment was conducted using a randomized complete block design
    with four replications. Eight irrigation treatments (T1–T8) were applied in 2003
    and the number of treatments was increased to nine (T1–T9) in 2004. Each year,
    treatments included a dryland treatment (treatment T8 in 2003 and T9 in 2004)
    (Table 2), which received no irrigation. This many treatments were included to
    obtain enough data points and a wide enough range of water stress levels to be
    able to develop meaningful quantitative relationships between grain yield and
    several seasonal water variables, including irrigation, total water, rain + irrigation,
    evaporation, evapotranspiration, and transpiration, among others. Table 2. Irrigation

    a % of ETw is the percent of seasonal crop evapotranspiration when soil water
    is not limiting that was supplied by irrigation. Irrigation to the different treatments
    was scheduled trying to create differences in soil water depletions of approximately
    10 mm between irrigated treatments, within the range of 150–250 mm. This range
    of soil water depletion represents between 50 and 85% of total available water
    in the maximum crop rooting depth. No irrigation was applied during the vegetative
    growth stage, following a common practice in the area, and to make sure that there
    would be some seasonal crop stress despite potential rainfall occurring later
    in the growing season. Depths and timings of irrigation events applied to each
    irrigation treatment during the 2003 and 2004 growing seasons are shown in Table
    2. Due to more in-season rainfall, seasonal irrigation amounts and the number
    of irrigation events per treatment were significantly less in 2004 than 2003.
    In 2003, seasonal irrigation depths per treatment ranged from approximately 245
    to 395 mm. These seasonal irrigation depths supplied between 34.7 and 55.7% of
    seasonal crop water requirements (ETw). In 2004, seasonal irrigation depths ranged
    from 34 to 161 mm, representing between 4.7 and 21.2% of seasonal ETw. In 2003,
    the first irrigation to some of the irrigated treatments was applied in early
    July. In 2004, rainfall early in the season allowed delaying the first irrigation
    to any of the treatments until early August. The last irrigation during both years
    was applied in early September. Irrigation scheduling at both sites was done using
    a scheduling spreadsheet that used the calculated daily corn evapotranspiration
    as input to estimate daily soil water content in the crop root zone. When actual
    soil water measurements were available, they were used to adjust the spreadsheet
    estimates. Soil water measurements were made approximately every 2 weeks during
    the growing season using the neutron scattering method. Soil water readings were
    taken from 50-mm diameter aluminum access tubes installed at the center of two
    of the four replications for each treatment. Readings were taken at 0.3-m depth
    increments to a depth of 1.8 m. Weather data for this study were obtained from
    an automatic weather station located within 1.5 km from the research site. This
    weather station was part of the High Plains Regional Climate Center (HPRCC) weather
    network. Daily weather data were downloaded from the HPRCC web site (http://www.hprcc.unl.edu/home.html),
    including daily maximum and minimum air temperature, relative humidity, wind speed,
    rainfall, solar radiation, reference ET, and crop ET for different crops, including
    corn. 2.3. Data analyses The statistical analyses of yield data, which included
    analysis of variance (ANOVA) and separation of means by the Duncan''s new multiple
    range test, were conducted using the SAS® System for Windows® statistical software
    (SAS Institute, Inc., Cary, NC). A computer program was written in Microsoft Visual
    Basic® to model the daily soil water status. Basic input to the program included
    daily weather data, rainfall, irrigation, the soil water profile at crop emergence,
    and crop-specific and site-specific information such as planting date, maturity
    date, soil parameters, maximum rooting depth, etc. Based on these inputs, the
    water balance in the crop root zone was calculated on a daily basis. Similar soil
    water balance models have previously been used by Robinson and Hubbard (1990),
    Swan et al. (1990), and Bryant et al. (1992) to estimate daily water status and
    yield for corn. The computer program calculated evapotranspiration using the procedure
    presented in FAO-56 (Allen et al., 1998). Since this is a lengthy procedure, readers
    are referred to the original source for details. According to this procedure,
    crop evapotranspiration can be obtained as the product of the evapotranspiration
    of a reference crop (ETo) and a crop coefficient (Kc). ETo is calculated using
    the daily weather data as input to the Penman–Monteith equation, and the Kc is
    used to adjust the estimated ETo for the reference crop to that of other crops
    at different growth stages and growing environments. ETo is the evapotranspiration
    of a hypothetical reference crop with an assumed crop height of 0.12 m, a fixed
    surface resistance of 70 s m−1 and an albedo of 0.23. The reference surface closely
    resembles an extensive surface of green grass of uniform height, actively growing,
    completely shading the ground and with adequate water (Allen et al., 1998). The
    dual crop coefficient approach was used to separate the two components of evapotranspiration,
    namely evapotation (E) and transpiration (T) (Wright, 1982). For corn, this procedure
    linearly reduced crop evapotranspiration when the root zone depletion exceeded
    55% (taken from Table 22 in FAO-56) of total available water, which was used to
    quantify the effect of water stress on corn water use. The dual crop coefficient
    procedure also accounts for the sharp increases in evaporation due to a wet soil
    surface following rain or irrigation. This procedure permitted calculation of
    the crop evapotranspiration and transpiration when soil water is not limiting
    (ETw and Tw), and the actual crop evapotranspiration, transpiration, and evaporation
    (ETd, Td, and E). From the seasonal values, the seasonal ETd/ETw and Td/Tw ratios
    were calculated for each treatment. It was expected that the seasonal ETd/ETw
    and Td/Tw ratios would relate to crop yield. Additionally, in FAO-56, an equation
    was presented to estimate the fraction of total available soil water in the root
    zone (p) that can be depleted from the root zone before moisture stress (reduction
    in ETd) occurs. This equation estimates a variable p (pcalc) as a function of
    daily ETw as: (7) where, ptable is the p value taken from Table 22 in FAO-56,
    and ETw is in mm day−1 and 0.1 ≤ pcalc ≤ 0.8. This equation suggests that as ETw
    for a given day decreases, it is easier for the crop to sustain ETw rates, and
    therefore, higher soil water depletion levels could be allowed without yield loss,
    as previously proposed by Doorenbos et al. (1979). This way of calculating a variable
    p value differs from the common procedure of using a fixed p value for a given
    crop for the entire growing season. In this study, the daily pcalc values were
    calculated, which were taken as the theoretical optimum depletion value for a
    given day. Also, a daily actual p (pactual) was calculated as: (8) (9) where D
    is the soil water depletion in the crop root zone (mm), ⊖FC the soil water content
    at field capacity (m3 m−3), ⊖PWP the soil water content at permanent wilting point
    (m3 m−3), Zr the crop rooting depth (m), and TAW is the total available soil water
    in the crop root zone (mm). A maximum rooting depth of 1.7 m was assumed for corn
    (taken from Table 22 in FAO-56). In this study, it was expected that pdiff = (pactual
    − pcalc) accumulated for the entire season only for days when pdiff > 0 (seasonal
    pdiff) would be a good indicator of the level of crop stress and would, therefore,
    relate to crop yield. The greater the seasonal pdiff for a given treatment the
    greater the level of water stress. Seasonal pdiff was therefore calculated for
    each treatment. The effect of irrigation treatments on crop yield was also evaluated
    by calculating the crop water productivity (CWP) (Zwart and Bastiaanssen, 2004)
    as: (10) where Ya is the crop yield (kg ha−1), seasonal ETd the seasonal actual
    crop evapotranspiration (mm), and CWP is in kg m−3. Since 1 ha-mm = 10 m3, 10
    is needed to convert CWP from units of kg ha−1 mm−1 to kg m−3. The CWP is sometimes
    equivalent to water use efficiency (WUE) as defined by Howell (2000), although
    sometimes researchers define WUE in terms of seasonal irrigation applied instead
    of seasonal ETd. This study also evaluated the relationships between several other
    water variables and corn grain yield. These variables included seasonal ETd, Td,
    E, irrigation applied (I), rain + irrigation (WR+I), and total water available
    to crop during the growing season (Wall). Grain yields were also normalized by
    calculating the % yield potential (%Yp) and the % maximum yield (%Ymax). The maximum
    yield obtained within each season was taken as a reference to calculate %Ymax.
    The potential yield for each season was estimated using the Hybrid-Maize simulation
    model developed by Yang et al. (2004). 3. Results and discussion 3.1. Yield response
    to water deficit Irrigation treatments resulted in differences in daily soil water
    depletions in the crop root zone as shown in Fig. 2. To avoid water stress, best
    management practices commonly recommend maintaining root zone depletion below
    the readily available water (RAW) line (Fig. 2). Fig. 2, however, shows that in
    2003, delaying irrigation until early July resulted in water stress for all treatments
    occurring after mid June. Limited water inputs after that time also resulted in
    water stress levels for the different treatments that ranged from mild to severe.
    In 2004, except for the dryland treatment, stress to most treatments only occurred
    after mid July. Limited water inputs in 2004 also resulted in some level of stress
    for all treatments, especially late in the growing season. In 2004, similarly
    to 2003, the dryland treatment suffered from water stress during most of the growing
    season, although the level of stress at the end of the growing season for this
    treatment was more severe in 2003 than 2004. Download : Download full-size image
    Fig. 2. Daily soil water depletion in the crop root zone for the different irrigation
    treatments (T1–T9) at North Platte during the 2003 and 2004 growing seasons. TAW
    is the total available water in the crop root zone and RAW is the readily available
    water (RAW = 0.55TAW). Irrigation treatments also resulted in differences in seasonal
    values of several water variables as shown in Table 3. Although the 2004 growing
    season was cooler and wetter than 2003, the seasonal values of ETw were higher
    in 2004 due to the longer growing season, resulting from delayed crop maturity,
    and to increased soil evaporation due to more frequent wetting of the soil surface
    by rainfall. Values of seasonal ETd for the different treatments were also higher
    in 2004 since there was more water available to the crop compared with 2003. The
    seasonal values of ETd/ETw per treatment ranged from 0.37 to 0.79 in 2003 and
    from 0.63 to 0.91 in 2004. The values of the ETd/ETw ratio indicate that all treatments
    experienced some water stress during the growing season. No deep percolation (Dp)
    occurred during the study for any of the irrigation treatments. Table 3. Seasonal

    ETw, seasonal crop evapotranspiration when soil water is not limiting; Wall, water
    available to the crop from all sources, including irrigation, rainfall and water
    already stored in the soil at crop emergence; WR+I, rainfall plus irrigation water;
    Wsoil, water stored in the soil profile at crop emergence, to a depth equal to
    the maximum root depth; Td, seasonal actual transpiration; Tw, seasonal transpiration
    when soil water is not limiting; E, seasonal evaporation; Dp, seasonal deep percolation;
    pdiff, daily positive difference between the actual and the theoretical fraction
    of total available soil water in the root zone that can be depleted before moisture
    stress occurs, accumulated for the entire season, and CWP, crop water productivity.
    a ETd, seasonal actual crop evapotranspiration. In 2004, there was slightly more
    seasonal evaporation (E) for all treatments compared with 2003. The values for
    E/ETw in Table 3 show that the seasonal evaporation represented about 1/3 of ETw
    during both seasons for all treatments. This is a significant amount of water
    that does not directly contribute to crop yield. In this study, however, most
    of the evaporation resulted from rainfall instead of irrigation. Most of the E
    also occurred early in the growing season when there was a partial canopy cover
    and the soil surface was exposed to direct solar energy. To achieve the objective
    of producing more crop yield per unit of water there is still potential for reducing
    the evaporation component of ETw in addition to the application of other water-saving
    techniques (Kijne et al., 2003). Irrigation treatments also resulted in differences
    in grain yields as shown in Table 4. Higher yields were obtained in 2004 since
    there was more water available to the crop in all treatments compared with 2003.
    The analysis of variance resulted in significant yield differences during both
    growing seasons. However, during the 2003 season the separation of means analysis
    resulted in five different groups of treatments, while in 2004 only the dryland
    treatment (T9) had significantly lower grain yield than the other treatments.
    Running the Hybrid-maize simulation model of Yang et al. (2004) assuming adequate
    irrigation, potential yields for corn at North Platte were estimated at 13.3 Mg
    ha−1 for 2003 and 16.9 Mg ha−1 for 2004. These potential yields were used to calculate
    the % potential yield (%Yp) shown in Table 4. The maximum yield was 10.1 Mg ha−1
    in 2003 and 14.2 Mg ha−1 in 2004. Based on these maximum yields, the % maximum
    yield (%Ymax) per treatment was also calculated (Table 4). The %Yp for the different
    irrigation treatments ranged between 17.7 and 75.9% in 2003 and from 47.4 to 83.8%
    in 2004. During both years, soil water deficit was the main yield-limiting factor.

    for 2003 and 16.9 Mg ha−1 for 2004 using the Hybrid-Maize simulation model (Yang
    et al., 2004). a ANOVA was used to determine significance of treatment main effect
    for yield for each year. The Duncan New Multiple Range test was used to separate
    means when the treatment main effect was significant. For a given year, yields
    with the same letter are not significantly different. 3.2. Effect of seasonal
    water variables on grain yield The relationships between yield and several seasonal
    water variables obtained during 2003 and 2004 are shown in Fig. 3. Results of
    regression analyses for the different water variables are shown in Table 5, which
    include the results of the regression analyses for each year and also combining
    data for both years. Fig. 3 and Table 5 indicate that in 2003 there were very
    good linear relationships among all the yield and water variables. The poorest
    relationships were between evaporation and grain yield, which resulted in R2 =
    0.58, and between ETd/ETw and CWP, which resulted in R2 = 0.74. All other relationships
    resulted in R2 > 0.90. Among all variables, the ones relating best to grain yield
    in 2003 were irrigation, Wall, and rain + irrigation, and ETd, which all resulted
    in a high R2 value of 0.94. Download : Download full-size image Fig. 3. Relationships

    evapotranspiration. For 2004, however, irrigation, rain + irrigation, and evaporation
    were all poorly related to grain yield. Also, ETd/ETw was poorly related to CWP
    in 2004, which could be due to the small range of CWP values obtained that year.
    All other variables were well-correlated to grain yield during 2004, resulting
    in R2 ≥ 0.84. The poor relationship between irrigation and grain yield during
    2004 could be due to several factors. First, the small seasonal irrigation amounts
    applied during 2004 did not provide a large enough range of irrigation among treatments
    to be able to observe significant yield differences, with the only exception of
    the dryland treatment. Second, some of the irrigation water may have been applied
    too late in the season to some of the treatments to be able to make an impact
    on crop yield. For instance, no grain yield increase resulted from applying an
    additional 48 mm of irrigation to treatment T1 late in the growing season (on
    September 8, 2004) compared to treatment T5, which received the last irrigation
    on August 25, 2004 (Table 2). Both of these treatments produced the same yield,
    although T1 received 161 mm of irrigation, while T5 only received approximately
    62 mm. The difference was that there was a higher amount of soil water left in
    the T1 treatment at the end of the season compared to T5 (Fig. 2). Fig. 2 shows
    that at the end of the growing season, there was still some water available in
    the soil profile that the crop did not have time to use because it resulted from
    rainfall or rain that occurred too late in the growing season to have an impact
    on crop yield. Norwood (2000) in a 4-year study with corn in Kansas found that
    considerable water remained in the soil profile after harvest. These results point
    out the importance of applying all irrigations early enough in the growing season
    so that the crop has time to use the water and convert it into grain. Fig. 3 reflects
    the considerable variations in the relationship between grain yield and irrigation
    that can occur from one season to the next, as previously reported by Norwood
    (2000). These variations depend on how much water is stored in the soil profile
    at crop emergence, and the amount and distribution of in-season rainfall. These
    results also point out the importance of calculating variables that relate crop
    yield to available soil water (i.e., CWP or water use efficiency) in terms of
    water variables that are more stable than seasonal irrigation. Some of these more
    stable water variables include seasonal ETd, Td, ETd/ETw, Wall, Td/Tw, or pdiff.
    When data for 2003 and 2004 were combined, irrigation had the poorest relationship
    to grain yield (R2 = 0.06) among all variables, followed by rain + irrigation
    (R2 = 0.65) (Table 5). Even evaporation was better related to grain yield than
    the two previous variables (R2 = 0.75). Although evaporation itself might not
    contribute to crop yield directly, it is well-correlated to ETd (R2 = 0.69), which
    does contribute to yield. All the remaining variables were highly correlated to
    grain yield. Combining both years, ETd had the best correlation to grain yield,
    and the water variables could be ranked from higher to lower resulting R2 when
    related to grain yield as: . The ranking of these variables, however, could change
    for other locations, when combining data for more than one location, or when considering
    an individual year or season. For instance, it was previously shown that during
    the dry 2003 season, irrigation, Wall, and rain + irrigation had the highest correlation
    to crop yield of all the variables, while irrigation and rain + irrigation had
    a poor correlation to yield when data for the two seasons were combined. Normalizing
    grain yield as %Ymax or %Yp did not produce a significant improvement in the relationships
    between yield and the seasonal water variables compared in this study. Fig. 3
    shows that in this study, it took approximately 180 mm of seasonal ETd for the
    crop to start producing grain yield. This number can be derived from the equation
    of the line obtained using the 2003 and 2004 data combined in Table 5 (yield =
    0.028ETd − 5.04), assuming a grain yield = 0 Mg ha−1 (seasonal ETd = 5.04/0.028
    = 180 mm). The slope of the line indicates that grain yield increased with seasonal
    ETd at a rate of 0.028 Mg ha−1 mm−1. Fig. 4 shows a comparison of the yield-ETd
    linear relationship obtained in this study and those functions reported by other
    researchers. This plot seems to suggest that corn response to water could change
    with environment and time as new crop hybrids are developed and management practices
    improve. The slope of the line obtained in this study, however, is very similar
    to those reported by Schneekloth et al. (1991) and Klocke et al. (2004) for the
    same location. Schneekloth et al. (1991) reported an average yield-ETd slope for
    two corn crop rotations (continuous corn and wheat–corn–soybean) during a three-year
    study of 0.030 Mg ha−1 mm−1. Klocke et al. (2004) also reported yield-ETd slope
    for corn at North Platte of 0.030 Mg ha−1 mm−1, although the intercept of the
    line (−8.5 Mg ha−1) was smaller than the one obtained in this study (−5.04 Mg
    ha−1). For the same location, Hergert et al. (1993) also reported an average marginal
    return for corn from the application of a deficit irrigation treatment of 150
    mm of water of 0.027 Mg ha−1 mm−1, which was very similar to the slope of the
    yield-ETd line obtained in this study. Stone (2003), however, reported a long-term
    yield-ETd slope for corn in Kansas of 0.033 Mg ha−1 mm−1, which is slightly higher
    than the slope found in this study. This difference could be due to differences
    in techniques used to quantify seasonal ETd and yield, differences in climate
    between locations (especially the amount and distribution of in-season rainfall),
    differences in crop varieties and cultural practices, irrigation method, differences
    in irrigation scheduling practices, etc. Download : Download full-size image Fig.
    4. Linear relationships between corn grain yield and actual seasonal evapotranspiration
    (ETd) reported in the literature and that obtained in this study. The CWP increased
    with ETd/ETw, resulting in a R2 = 0.75 when data for both years were combined
    (Table 5). These results suggest that trying to increase CWP by using deficit
    irrigation might not be a beneficial strategy under the conditions of this study
    as suggested by other researchers. For instance, Zwart and Bastiaanssen (2004)
    reviewed measured CWP for several crops around the world, including corn, and
    concluded that the CWP could be significantly increased if irrigation was reduced
    and crop water deficit was intentionally induced. Deficit irrigation would probably
    increase CWP only in situations where crops are being over-irrigated. The results
    of this study suggest that if the crop is already deficit-irrigated, lowering
    irrigation inputs would only contribute to further reduce yields, lowering CWP.
    Howell (2000) showed that WUE (calculated the same as CWP in this study) for corn
    increased as yield increased. It is important, however, to point out that the
    objective of most farmers is not to maximize CWP, but to maximize profits. Therefore,
    there could be very good reasons for applying deficit irrigation other than trying
    to maximize CWP. For example, Norwood (2000) concluded that for corn, deficit-irrigation
    combined with proper fertility and plant population was a viable alternative to
    dryland in Kansas where groundwater resources are declining. Some economic justifications
    for deficit irrigation strategies for corn in Nebraska have been reported by Klocke
    et al. (2004) and Schneekloth et al. (1995). 4. Conclusions Quantitative relationships
    between grain yield and several seasonal water variables were developed. Seasonal
    water variables included, irrigation (I), total water (Wall), rain + irrigation
    (WR+I), evaporation (E), actual crop evapotranspiration (ETd), actual crop transpiration
    (Td), ETd/ETw, Td/Tw, and pdiff. Several of the water variables were also related
    to grain yield normalized as % maximum yield and % potential yield. A relationship
    between crop water productivity (CWP) and ETd/ETw was developed. Results indicated
    that E accounted for about 1/3 of seasonal ETw, which indicates that technologies
    to minimize E should be developed and implemented. The linear relationship between
    grain yield and some of the water variables changed significantly from year to
    year, while others were very consistent. Combining data from both years, ETd had
    the best correlation to corn grain yield (yield = 0.028ETd − 5.04, R2 = 0.95).
    The water variables could be ranked from higher to lower R2 when related to grain
    yield as: . The CWP linearly increased with ETd/ETw (R2 = 0.75). These results
    indicate that trying to increase CWP by imposing deficit irrigation for corn might
    not be a beneficial strategy under the conditions of this study. However, it is
    recognized that there could be other good justifications for deficit irrigating
    corn in this environment, other than increasing CWP. References Allen et al.,

  explanation: The paper investigates the potential of using automated irrigation
    systems for real-time irrigation management to optimize water usage and enhance
    agricultural productivity. It demonstrates how the automated system can provide
    timely and accurate irrigation based on crop water requirements, leading to improved
    crop growth, yield, and water productivity. Additionally, the paper highlights
    the importance of interpretability and explainability in ML models for agriculture,
    enabling farmers and researchers to understand the decision-making process and
    make informed adjustments to irrigation strategies.

    \ primary goal of all those working in the ﬁeld of sustainable water management,\n\
    particularly in the arid and semi-arid zones, is to increase irrigation eﬃciency,\
    \ reduce irrigation water\nlosses, and improve water productivity for all crops.\
    \ This study assessed the automatic irrigation\nscheduling and irrigation management\
    \ on the growth, yield, and water productivity of cucumber\nunder greenhouse conditions.\
    \ A ﬁeld experiment was conducted using cucumber grown in aplastic\ngreenhouse\
    \ during the winter of 2017/18 and 2018/19 at the research farm station of the\
    \ National\nResearch Centre (NRC), El-Noubaria Region, Behaira Governorate, Egypt.\
    \ In a split-plot experiment,\ntwo diﬀerent methods to control irrigation scheduling\
    \ (manual control (MC) and automatic control\n(AC)) were used in the main plots\
    \ and three deﬁcit irrigation treatments (100% of full irrigation (FI),\n80% of\
    \ FI, and 60% of FI). Through the obtained results, it was found that the use\
    \ of the automatic\ncontrol of the irrigation schedule led to an improvement in\
    \ the productivity and quality characteristics\nof the cucumber crop. Automatic\
    \ irrigation control created healthy conditions for the plant roots\nlocated under\
    \ the least water stress. This led to an increase in nitrogen uptake at the ages\
    \ of 3, 5, 7,\nand 9 weeks after planting in addition to improving the total leaf\
    \ area and the chlorophyll content\nof leaves, which consequently had a greater\
    \ eﬀect on increasing yield and water productivity of\ncucumber. Although the\
    \ highest values of cucumber productivity were obtained with irrigation\nat 100%\
    \ of FI, there were no signiﬁcant diﬀerences between 100% FI and 80% of FI, therefore\
    \ it is\npreferable to irrigate at 80% of FI, and this means saving 20% of irrigation\
    \ water that can be used\nto irrigate other areas. The SALTMED model simulating\
    \ all of the following evaluation criteria\nperformed well for soil moisture content\
    \ and N-uptake as well as the leaves area, the yield, and water\nproductivity\
    \ of cucumber for all treatments for the two growing seasons 2017/18 and 2018/19,\
    \ with the\noverall R2 of 0.882, 0.903, 0.975, 0.907, and 0.933, respectively.\n\

    \ shortage are one of the most important and serious problems and challenges\n\
    facing the irrigation process in the Arab Republic of Egypt and arid and semi-arid\
    \ regions, hence the\nnecessity to reduce the consumption of irrigation water.\
    \ This can be achieved by many means,\nincluding the development and improvement\
    \ of new and innovative technologies that can be an\neﬀective tool [1,2]. In arid\
    \ countries as well as semi-arid regions, which are characterized by high\nSustainability\

    Sustainability 2020, 12, 9819\n2 of 20\npopulation growth and low water resources,\
    \ there is stress, negative impact, and high pressure on\nall sectors, chieﬂy\
    \ the agricultural sectors to rationalize water consumption for irrigation and\
    \ also\nrationalize the use of water for the urban and industrial sectors [3–5].\
    \ The agricultural production\nsector faces a great and dangerous challenge in\
    \ increasing food production with less irrigation water,\nwhich can be achieved\
    \ by many diﬀerent technologies that lead to increased crop water productivity\
    \ [6].\nIncreasing crop water productivity [7] is an important and necessary goal\
    \ to increase the demand\nfor food while increasing the rate of continuous population\
    \ growth [8,9]. The increasing demand\nfor scarce water resources resulted in\
    \ all innovative and new applications competing with new\nirrigation technologies\
    \ that aim to increase and improve water productivity for diﬀerent crops [10]\
    \ and\nAbdelraouf and Ragab [11]. The concept of increasing crop water productivity\
    \ in the Arab Republic of\nEgypt and all dry areas is extremely important in light\
    \ of the limited water resources resulting from\nlimited rainfall [12]. To save\
    \ part of the limited irrigation water, the application of modern irrigation\n\
    methods and associated technologies is an important concept that must be undertaken\
    \ and worked on\nin arid and semi-arid regions as is the case in Egypt [3,13].\n\
    Applying optimal irrigation scheduling and relying on water use patterns as well\
    \ as the plantation’s\nresponse to the conditions of irrigation water shortage\
    \ improve water productivity and water use\neﬃciency. It is highly recommended\
    \ to use drip irrigation methods due to their high eﬃciency in\nusing water, which\
    \ results in saving water and increasing water productivity [14]. Eﬀective ﬁeld\n\
    pursuits with a drip irrigation system may aﬀect the achievement of the objectives\
    \ of increasing\nirrigation water savings and improving crop productivity [15,16].\
    \ Farmers and users of a drip irrigation\nsystem may suﬀer from the reduced hydraulic\
    \ performance of this system due to error in design\nor management, and they may\
    \ have to resort to using a system that is cheaper in ﬁnancial cost if\nthey are\
    \ unable to manage capital needs. Inexperienced farmers will also have diﬃculty\
    \ controlling\nirrigation scheduling with their irrigation systems in the most\
    \ optimal way as well as having little\nexperience monitoring irrigation system\
    \ performance. Modern irrigation water management systems\nbased on various environmental\
    \ measurements provide better and signiﬁcantly improved control of\nsupply in\
    \ relation to demand. In general, many irrigation systems are semi-automatic,\
    \ using timers\nto control irrigation scheduling, i.e., the exact time of irrigation.\
    \ Farmers should also renew these\ntimers in a way that is more dependent on changes\
    \ in environmental conditions and the water use\nrequirements of the plant [17].\
    \ The use of automatic control systems in irrigation scheduling provides\nsuitable\
    \ solutions to overcome the unwanted eﬀects resulting from the presence of either\
    \ poor design,\npoor control and operation, or both. This advanced management\
    \ and automatic control, when used\nin scheduling irrigation water for diﬀerent\
    \ crops, will be an eﬀective and appropriate monitoring\ntool to increase irrigation\
    \ eﬃciency [18]. Predicting irrigation water needs is an eﬀective and key\ntopic\
    \ for automatic control systems in order to reach eﬃcient and appropriate scheduling\
    \ of irrigation\nwater. In general, the results of studies conducted by [19–21]\
    \ conﬁrm the necessity and importance of\nusing and applying automatic control\
    \ systems to improve the performance of irrigation systems and\nmethods, with\
    \ the eﬃciency of water and energy use. Irrigation standardization plays an important\n\
    and essential role in improving and increasing crop productivity, water productivity,\
    \ and increasing net\nproﬁts [22,23]. Eﬀective and successful management of the\
    \ limited amount of irrigation water required\nfor various agricultural uses depends\
    \ on better agricultural practices and techniques to improve water\nproductivity\
    \ [24,25].\nIrrigation deﬁcit (i.e., irrigation that falls below the water requirements\
    \ critical to crop growth) is\nan eﬀective irrigation-water-saving strategy where\
    \ the cultivated crops are exposed to a certain level of\nwater stress either\
    \ during a certain period or throughout the entire growing season [26]. The main\
    \ goal\nof using deﬁcit irrigation” DI “is to increase water use eﬃciency.\nCucumber\
    \ is one of the most popular and best vegetables grown in greenhouses in the Arab\n\
    Republic of Egypt. The fresh crops of cucumbers are signiﬁcantly aﬀected by the\
    \ irrigation schedule\nand by the total volume of irrigation water added in its\
    \ diﬀerent growth stages [27].\nSustainability 2020, 12, 9819\n3 of 20\nThe model\
    \ of SALTMED by Ragab [7] is considered one of the important models developed\
    \ that\nhas proven its ability to simulate many crops under various ﬁeld administrations\
    \ taking into account\nall irrigation systems, diﬀerent water characteristics,\
    \ irrigation strategies, diﬀerent types of soils,\ncrops, fertilizer applications,\
    \ and the eﬀect and simulation of abiotic stress such as drought, salinity,\n\
    temperature, shallow groundwater quality, and various drainage systems. The current\
    \ version of the\nmodel released in2015 allows simultaneous simulations of 20\
    \ ﬁelds, each with all irrigation systems,\nsoil and crops, irrigation strategies\
    \ and N fertilizers, etc. This model simulates soil moisture, dry matter,\ncrop\
    \ productivity and soil salinity, soil nitrogen dynamics and requirements for\
    \ salinity ﬁltration,\nnitrate ﬁltration and drainage, soil temperature, evaporation\
    \ and water absorption, water salinity,\ngroundwater level, and eﬄuent ﬂow. This\
    \ model was calibrated and validated using observed ﬁeld\ndata by [8,11,28–38].\
    \ They demonstrated and conﬁrmed their high predictability of ﬁeld-measured\n\
    yield, soil moisture content, N-uptake, dry matter, yields, water productivity,\
    \ and salinity.\nThis study aimed to improve the yield and water productivity\
    \ of cucumber plants grown in\naplastic greenhouse by the automatic control of\
    \ irrigation scheduling under deﬁcit irrigation strategy\nthrough a ﬁeld and modeling\
    \ study using the SALTMED model in the North of Egypt.\n2. Materials and Methods\n\

    \ and treatments were arranged in a split-plot\ndesign with ﬁve replications.\
    \ The control methods of irrigation scheduling (manual control in irrigation\n\
    scheduling (MC) and automatic control (AC)) were used in the main plots, and deﬁcit\
    \ irrigation\nstrategy (100% full irrigation (FI), 80% FI, and 60%FI) were used\
    \ in the sub-main plots as shown in\nFigure 1.\nIrrigation system: The components\
    \ of the irrigation system consisted of a pumping and ﬁltration\nunit. It consists\
    \ of a centrifugal pump with a 45 m3/h discharge and backﬂow prevention device,\n\
    screen ﬁlter and pressure gauges, pressure regulator, control valves, and ﬂow-meter.\
    \ The main line\nwas of PVC pipes, 110 mm in diameter, to convey the irrigation\
    \ water from the source to the main\ncontrol points in the ﬁeld. Sub-main lines\
    \ were of PVC pipes, 75 mm in diameter, connected to the\nmain line. Manifold\
    \ lines: PE pipes were 63 mm in diameter, connected to the sub-main line through\n\
    control valve 2 and discharge gauge. Emitters were built in lateral tubes of PE\
    \ with 16 mm in diameter\nand 40 m in length (emitter discharge was 4 lph at 1.0\
    \ bar operating pressure).\nEstimation of seasonal irrigation water requirements\
    \ for cucumber plants: The requirements\nof seasonal irrigation water for cucumber\
    \ plants was estimated according to the meteorological data of\nthe CLAC, Agricultural\
    \ Research Centre, Dokki, Egypt, depending on the Penman–Monteith equation.\n\
    The seasonal irrigation water requirements for cucumber plants were 6000 m3 ha−1\
    \ per season 2017/18\nand 6100 m3 ha−1 per season 2018/19 for 100%FI, 4800 m3\
    \ ha−1 per season 2017/18 and 4880 m3 ha−1 per\nseason 2018/19 for 80%FI, and\
    \ 3600 m3 ha−1 per season 2017/18 and 3660 m3 ha−1 per season 2018/19\nfor 60%FI.\
    \ The daily irrigation water was calculated by following Equation (1) for two\
    \ seasons 2018\nand 2019 for the drip irrigation system:\nIRg = [(ETO × Kc × Kr)/IE]\
    \ − R + LR\n(1)\nwhere IRg is gross irrigation requirements, mm/day, ETO is reference\
    \ evapotranspiration, mm/day,\nKc is crop factor (FAO−56), Kr is ground cover\
    \ reduction factor, IE is irrigation eﬃciency, %, R is\nwater received by the\
    \ plant from sources other than irrigation, mm (for example rainfall), and LR\
    \ is\nthe amount of water required for the leaching of the salts, mm. Gross irrigation\
    \ requirements were\nconverted from mm/ha/day to m3/ha/day.\nAll agricultural\
    \ practices were carried out according to the recommendations of the Ministry\
    \ of\nEgyptian Agriculture for cucumber production in the El-Noubaria region.\n\

    SALTMED Model: The SALTMED model description and the equations for the key processes\n\
    of evapotranspiration, water and solute transport, nitrogen cycle, drainage, and\
    \ crop growth were\nprovided by Ragab [7]. The model is suitable for all irrigation\
    \ systems including drip irrigation.\nThe reference evapotranspiration (ETo) according\
    \ to Allen et al. [40] was selected for this study using\nmeteorological data\
    \ obtained from the ﬁeld weather station. The crop-speciﬁc input data were the\n\
    leaf area index (LAI), plant height, maximum and minimum root depth, and each\
    \ growth stage\nduration. The irrigation input values were those applied in the\
    \ ﬁeld for drip irrigation with the\ndeﬁcit irrigation strategy during the 2017/2018\
    \ and 2018/2019 growing seasons. The soil proﬁle\nwas determined based on one\
    \ layer of 0.00–0.40 m; this one layer provided the initial soil moisture\nconditions\
    \ for the model run. The soil hydraulic property of that layer was obtained from\
    \ ﬁeld and\nlaboratory measurements. Model calibration was performed for each\
    \ control of irrigation scheduling\n(manual and automatic control) under study\
    \ individually due to the diﬀerent growth and other\ncharacteristics of each control\
    \ as shown in Table 3, and the simulated soil moisture content, N-uptake,\nleaves\
    \ area, total yield, and water productivity of cucumber at fully irrigated 100%\
    \ FI under drip\nirrigation were compared with the measured and observed values\
    \ during the 2017/2018 season by\nﬁne-tuning the relevant SALTMED model parameters.\
    \ Model validation was carried out using the\nremaining treatments (using the\
    \ calibrated parameter) by comparing simulated soil moisture content,\nN-uptake,\
    \ leaves area, yield, and water productivity of cucumber with the observed ones.\
    \ Statistical\nand graphical methods were used to evaluate model performance.\
    \ For the model calibration and\nvalidation statistical measures, the R2, root\
    \ mean square error (RMSE), and the coeﬃcient of residual\nmass (CRM) were used.\
    \ The CRM is a measure of the tendency of the model to overestimate or\nunderestimate\
    \ the measurements. Negative values for the CRM indicate that the model underestimates\n\
    the measurements, and positive values for the CRM indicate a tendency to overestimate.\

    \ and Water Stress Inside the Root Zone of Cucumber Plant\nThe soil moisture content\
    \ was measured before irrigation (as this indicates the extent to which\nthe roots\
    \ are exposed to water stress) within the root propagation area of cucumber plants\
    \ for all\ntreatments under the conditions of diﬀerent control systems for irrigation\
    \ scheduling and irrigation\ndeﬁcit strategy during the diﬀerent growth stages\
    \ of cucumber plants as in Figure 2.\nThe soil moisture content values were slightly\
    \ higher with automatic irrigation scheduling\ncompared to the manual irrigation\
    \ scheduling system due to the regularity of water addition under the\nautomatic\
    \ irrigation scheduling system, with which there was no opportunity to subject\
    \ the cucumber\nroot spread area to water stress at all, but on the contrary with\
    \ manual irrigation scheduling, which then\nexposed the spread area of cucumber\
    \ roots to water stress at many times during the diﬀerent growth\nstages due to\
    \ the irregularity of adding water at inappropriate and inaccurate times with\
    \ manual\nirrigation scheduling, as indicated in Figure 2.\nSustainability 2020,\

    \ addition under \nthe automatic irrigation scheduling system, with which there\
    \ was no opportunity to subject the \ncucumber root spread area to water stress\

    \ exposed the spread area of cucumber roots to water stress at many times \nduring\
    \ the different growth stages due to the irregularity of adding water at inappropriate\
    \ and \ninaccurate times with manual irrigation scheduling, as indicated in Figure\
    \ 2. \nThe soil moisture content is affected by the irrigation deficit level.\
    \ With a decrease in the \namount of added irrigation water, the moisture content\
    \ within the root spread area decreases, which \nexposes the roots of cucumber\
    \ plants to increase the water stress on them with a decrease in the \namount\
    \ of added irrigation water, and this seems logical to a great extent. The highest\
    \ values of soil \nmoisture content before irrigation were when 100% of complete\
    \ irrigation was added, and the lowest \nvalues were when 60% of complete irrigation\
    \ was added, as shown in Figure 2. \nThe best and highest moisture content values\
    \ were when scheduling automatic irrigation and \nwhen adding 100% of full irrigation,\
    \ while the lowest values were when scheduling manual \nirrigation and when adding\
    \ 60% of full irrigation. Overall, the model was able to simulate \nreasonably\
    \ well the observed data during both the calibration and validation processes.\
    \ These \nresults are consistent with those obtained by Pulvento, Riccardi, Lavini,\

    \ for the layer (0–40 cm). Good correlation between the simulated \nand observations\
    \ were obtained for the 2017/18 and 2018/19 seasons. Table 4 indicates that the\
    \ \nSALTMED model proved its high sensitivity to simulate the soil moisture changes\
    \ caused by \nirrigation events. Overall, the simulated and the observed soil\
    \ moistures for all treatments combined \nshowed a strong correlation for two\

    Deﬁcit irrigation: Regarding the eﬀect of deﬁcit irrigation treatments, it was\
    \ clear from the obtained\ndata in Table 5 that deﬁcit irrigation with the treatment\
    \ of 100% FI followed by 80% FI had a signiﬁcantly\nmore obvious eﬀect on nitrogen\
    \ uptake by cucumber plants through the whole vegetative growth\nstage at 3, 5,\
    \ 7, and 9 weeks from planting compared with 60% of deﬁcit irrigation, and for\
    \ that, deﬁcit\nirrigation at 80% is economically more recommended than 100%.\n\
    Interaction: Deﬁcit irrigation with the treatment of 80% and AC were found to\
    \ be the best treatment\nfor better nitrogen uptake by cucumber plants through\
    \ the whole vegetative growth stage. This positive\neﬀect of automatic control\
    \ on nitrogen uptake by cucumber plants through the whole vegetative\ngrowth stage\
    \ could be due to more available water in the rhizosphere which reﬂects on nitrogen\n\
    availability and simultaneous uptake of water and nitrogen at a satisfactory level\
    \ [42]. On the other\nhand, over-irrigation can increase nitrogen uptake to higher\
    \ levels which in turn could have a negative\nhealth eﬀect because of the too-high\
    \ nitrate content of vegetable fruits (Saleh et al.; 2010). Oppositely,\nunder\
    \ water stress drought conditions, nutrient uptake by roots was aﬀected by a reduction\
    \ in the\ntransportation of nutrients from the soil surface to the absorbing roots,\
    \ and transportation from the\nroots to the shoots was also adversely aﬀected\
    \ [43].\nFigures 5–7 indicated that a positive correlation between the simulated\
    \ and observations was\nobtained for the 2017/18 and 2018/19 seasons, and the\
    \ SALTMED model proved its high sensitivity to\nsimulate the N-uptake under automatic\

    \ 8, Figure 9, Figure 10 and Table 6. Deﬁcit irrigation with the treatment\nof\
    \ 80% and automatic control (AC) of irrigation were found to be the best treatment\

    \ applied (100%FI treatment). In addition, the same trend was detected\nby Saleh\
    \ and Ibrahim [45] for cantaloupe (Cucumis melo L.). This positive eﬀect of automatic\

    \ at 80% is\ncost-eﬀectively more recommended than 100%.In the present study,\
    \ the cucumber fruit yields markedly\nincreased with the increase of the amount\
    \ of irrigation water applied. This result is in agreement with\nthe former studies\
    \ [46,47]. Moreover, ¸Sim¸sek et al. [48] found that the fruit yield of cucumber\

    @2010 Authors:   S. A. O''Shaughnessy, S. R. Evett Keywords:   Crop canopy temperature,
    Infrared thermometry, Wireless sensors, Sensor networks The objectives of this
    study were to characterize wireless sensor nodes that we developed in terms of
    power consumption and functionality, and compare the performance of mesh and non-mesh
    wireless sensor networks (WSNs) comprised mainly of infrared thermometer thermocouples
    located on a center pivot lateral and in the field below. The sensor nodes mounted
    on masts fixed to the lateral arm of a center pivot irrigation system functioned
    to monitor crop canopy temperatures while the system moved; the sensor nodes established
    in the field below the pivot were to provide stationary reference canopy temperatures.
    The WSNs located in cropped fields independent of the irrigation system functioned
    in a highly reliable manner [packet reception percentage (PRP) > 94]. Mesh-networking
    was the single communication protocol that provided functionality for the WSN
    located on the center pivot lateral. Its PRP was 84 and 87 during the 2007 and
    2008 growing seasons, respectively. Future research is required for thorough testing
    and optimizing of WSNs for automatic control and irrigation scheduling of a center
    pivot system. (Download PDF)    (Export to EndNotes) 34 Share Facebook X Email

    **Extract 1**


    "MQTT and CoAP are lightweight, real-time communication protocols that are well-suited
    for IoT applications. MQTT is a publish/subscribe protocol that allows devices
    to communicate with each other without the need for a central server. CoAP is
    a request/response protocol that is designed for resource-constrained devices.
    Both MQTT and CoAP are widely used in IoT applications, and they are supported
    by a variety of hardware and software platforms."


    **Extract 2**


    "The proposed architecture consists of four layers: the perception layer, the
    network layer, the middleware layer, and the application layer. The perception
    layer is responsible for collecting data from sensors. The network layer is responsible
    for transmitting data to the middleware layer. The middleware layer is responsible
    for processing data and generating insights. The application layer is responsible
    for presenting insights to the user and controlling the irrigation system."


    **Limitations:**


    1. The paper focuses primarily on the technical aspects of integrating AI/ML with
    IoT-enabled irrigation systems and does not delve into the broader implications

    \ date\nAbstract The Internet of Things (IoT) is a thriving technol-\nogy in almost\
    \ all ﬁelds of human life to make their lives easy.\nSmart Agriculture is one\
    \ of the IoT applications on which\nfarmers are widely switching to improve productivity\
    \ and re-\nduce labor costs. As IoT involves the Internet, data transmis-\nsion\
    \ technology creates the possibility of privacy/security\nbreaches concerning\
    \ users’ data. The cybercrime rate may\nalso increase in IoT-based agriculture\
    \ (IoTA). Thus there\nmust be ready concerning digital forensics in IoTA. Various\n\
    review articles are available regarding the emerging cyber\nattack, cybercrime,\
    \ and forensics challenges in IoT appli-\ncations like smart home, smart city,\
    \ smart healthcare, smart\ngrid, smart retail, smart supply chain management,\
    \ and smart\nagriculture, while a few review articles on IoTA security and\nforensic\
    \ challenges. This review paper is focused on IoTA\nsolutions and their security\
    \ and forensics challenges. The\nsystematic literature review method has been\
    \ used for this\nstudy which includes articles published from 2011 - 2021.\nThis\
    \ article has brought the limelight on IoT architecture\nand its application in\
    \ agricluture (IoTA) to emphasize on\nits introduction, architecture, challenges\
    \ and issues related\nemerging cybercrimes and digital forensics. At the end,\
    \ this\nreview paper discusses various challenges in securing IoTA\nsystems and\
    \ presents future directions for research.\n1 Introduction\nInternet of things\
    \ (IoT) refers to interconnected things. Karl\nSteinbuch, a German computer science\
    \ pioneer, said, \"In a\nfew decades, computers will be interwoven into almost\
    \ ev-\nery industrial product .\" IoT is frequently used in the do-\nmains like\
    \ healthcare, food and restaurant industry, travel\nand tourism industry and library\
    \ services, smart home, smart\nae-mail: santoshi.phdcs21@nfsu.ac.in\nbe-mail:\
    \ parag.rughani@nfsu.ac.in\ngrid, smart retail and smart agriculture [1] [2].\
    \ The IoT mar-\nket value projected to reach from 157 billion USD in 2016\nto\
    \ 771 billion USD by 2026. Cisco predicted that by 2030,\n500 billion objects\
    \ would be connected and linked up to the\nInternet [3].\nFood Requirement will\
    \ increase by 70% more to supply\nfor an estimated population of 10.1 billion\
    \ by 2050, says the\nUN Food & Agriculture Report [4]. The volatility of food\n\
    prices, climate change and timely harvest forecasts are cru-\ncial to counteract,\
    \ which has a major impact on the economy\nand is closely linked to issues such\
    \ as malnutrition, and un-\ndernourishment, [5] [6] [7]. By 2050 the global population\n\
    of 9 billion people will face the challenge of feeding [8].\nTo deal with these\
    \ challenges and meet the need of future\nfood requirements. Agriculture 5.0 implies\
    \ that farms are\nfollowing Precision Agriculture principles and using equip-\n\
    ment that involves crewless operations and autonomous de-\ncision support systems\
    \ using the IoTA, robotics and AI [9].\nMany developed and developing counties\
    \ are widely using\nIoT based Agriculture (IoTA). It is observed that the 26.7%\n\
    global population and approximately 58% of the Indian pop-\nulation rely on agriculture\
    \ and farming to meet their liveli-\nhood. The Economic Survey of India 2020-21\
    \ report stated\nthat in FY20, the total food grain production was recorded at\n\
    296.65 million tonnes by India [10]. This high dependency\nmakes agriculture a\
    \ signiﬁcant factor in improving higher-\nyielding and better quality agriculture\
    \ and farming produc-\ntion. These higher-yielding and better quality requirements\n\
    are being taken with the help of technology. Many of the\ndeveloped and developing\
    \ countries are transforming into\nIoTA.\nIoTA is a smart technique where the\
    \ researchers have\nbeen working on inventing tools and techniques for improv-\n\
    ing the production and quality in agriculture and farming.\nIn general, technologies\
    \ like GPS (Global Positioning Sys-\ntem), sensor networks and remote sensing\
    \ are used in IoTA\n2\n[11][12]. IoTA is helpful for various farm activities like\
    \ crop\nmonitoring, automated irrigation system, insect/pest moni-\ntoring, warehousing\
    \ of food, supply chain and smart farming\nsuch as livestock management, livestock\
    \ disease monitoring,\ndairy management [13]. Many IT organizations like Google,\n\
    Microsoft, Watson, IBM, Intel, Jasper, CISCO, Dell, HPE,\nHello Tractors, Farm\
    \ 2050 and Qualcomm are continuously\ndeveloping IoTA solutions that would have\
    \ a huge economic\nimpact [14]. The authors also estimate 2.7−6.2 trillion each\n\
    year, which will bring evolution in agriculture [15]. At present,\nmore than 26\
    \ billion smart devices are in circulation, while\na forecast says that this number\
    \ will triple within the coming\n5-6 years [16].\nThis paper presents a review\
    \ of different papers on IoT\ndevices supporting agricultural use, focusing on\
    \ the applica-\ntions, the emerging cyber attack and cyber crime (CACC)\nand Digital\
    \ Forensics (DF) challenges. With many farms\n(plant and livestock, small and\
    \ large) using automation and\nremote, networked sensors to monitor and manage\
    \ the op-\nerations, from watering and feeding, to growth and health\nmonitoring,\
    \ this is a sector that has not traditionally been as-\nsociated with high risks\
    \ of computer and network security\nproblems impacting their operation. And when\
    \ security is,\nat best, an afterthought, the enterprise can be at risk. Since\n\
    the number of IoTA solutions will rise, the number of crimes\non smart agriculture\
    \ may also increase soon. Sensitive data\nprocessed through IoTA could be a luring\
    \ means for hacking\ntargets by cyber criminals targeting the agricultural sector\n\
    for ﬁnancial gain, cyber warfare, activist/political purposes,\nor to obtain intellectual\
    \ property and technological advance-\nments. This study aims to review the work\

    \ considered and classiﬁed for IoTA and\nfarming applications of the method used\
    \ in this review for\narticle selection.\n3 IoT Based Agriculture (IoTA)\nIoTA\
    \ is an automated functioning system in which devices\ncommunicate over the Internet\
    \ and function according to the\nrequirements of the resources. The IoTA refers\
    \ to the usage\nof the Internet to connect sensors, Single Board Computer\n(SBC)\
    \ and servers. The Sensors sense the agriculture envi-\nronment status (plants,\
    \ crops, animals and their relative pa-\nrameters such as soil moisture, soil\
    \ nutrient ingredients, pest\nimages, water quality, climate, humidity, temperature,\
    \ crop\nstatus, animal health and reproductive system). The sensed\ndata is to\
    \ be sent to the SBC. SBCs such as Node MCU, Ar-\nduino, Raspberry pi and others\
    \ decide according to set con-\nditioned values and update the agriculture status\
    \ using the\n3\nFig. 1: Review Article Selection Method\nInternet. IoTA is used\
    \ for increasing the quality and quan-\ntity of agriculture production so that\
    \ the agriculture can be\nmonitored or operated from remote places and the action\
    \ be\ntaken by IoTA as per the requirement of the plants and an-\nimals. It reduces\
    \ the monitoring and labor costs [17]. IoTA\nallows devices to operate automatically\
    \ so that the chores in\nagriculture can be monitored and controlled remotely.\
    \ IoTA\nis being adopted widely to reduce labor costs and improve\nproductivity.\
    \ IoTA applications can manage land, animals,\ncrops and farms without human intervention.\
    \ IoTA is also re-\nferred to as smart agriculture[18], precision agriculture\
    \ [19]\n[20], digital farming [21], smart farming[22] [23], digital\nagriculture\
    \ [24].\n4 IoTA Architecture\nIn general, there are ﬁve layers in IoTA architecture\
    \ i.e. ap-\nplication layer, middleware layer, network layer, edge layer,\nphysical\
    \ layer. The illustrated with the diagram as shown\nin Fig 2 IoTA architecture\
    \ with its basic components such\nas sensors, SBC, gateway, cloud and the Internet\
    \ [25] [26]\n[27].\nIn [28] by ITU-T (International Telecommunications Union\n\
    Telecommunication Standard Sector) had been supposed four\nlayered architecture\
    \ for holistic IoT. The ﬁrst is device layer\nwhich interacts with hardwares like\
    \ sensors, actuators, RFID\ntags and GPS in IoT. The second is network layer which\n\
    performs functions such as networking, communication and\ntransport. The third\
    \ layer is service and application support\nlayer and the topmost layer IoT application\
    \ layer, which\nmanages IoT applications.\nIn IoT World Forum 2014, [29] has presented\
    \ 7 layer\nbased IoT achitecture reference model by the combination\nof three\
    \ layered and ﬁve layered IoT architectures. The lay-\ners included are physical,\
    \ connectivity, edge computing, data\naccumulation, data absraction, application\
    \ and collaboration\nand processes. The physical layer manages things in IoT,\n\
    connectivity layer is resposible for communication and pro-\ncessing units. The\
    \ edge computing layer analyze data ele-\nment and transforms it. The data accumulation\
    \ layer works\nas a storage of data to be recived or sent. The abstraction\nlayer\
    \ performs aggregation and access of the data. The ap-\nplication layer controls,\
    \ performs analytics and presents re-\nport of the functionality of IoT regarding\
    \ present environ-\nment. The collaboration and process layer includes people\n\
    and business processes.\n[30] proposed a three layerd based IoTA architecture.\n\
    The authors adopted the concept of fog coputing and cloud\ncomputing in this architecture.\
    \ In which, the ﬁrst layer named\nas IoT layer includes IoTA devices such as sensors,\
    \ drones,\nSBC and actuators. The sensor measures the environmental\nvariables\
    \ such as temperature, humidity, soil moisture and\nactivates the actuator to\
    \ perform respective function in the\nagriculture. Second is the fog layer where\
    \ IoTA devices are\nconnected with gateways by LoRaWAN or other network.\nThe\
    \ third layer is cloud layer which deals with API’s to man-\nage the data received\
    \ from the agricultral environment.\n[31] proposed four layer based IoTA architecture.\
    \ In this\nIoTA architecture, the perception layer is consists of phys-\nical\
    \ devices like sensor, actuators and microcontroller. The\nsensors fetch the data\
    \ of sensed agriculture environment and\nstored into the local server; Subsequently\
    \ after error anal-\nysis precised data is uploaded to the cloud. The network\n\
    layer performs abstraction of raw data recieved from the per-\nception layer and\
    \ trasnsmit on to the upper layers. The sen-\nsors are connected distinct communication\
    \ newtwork com-\nmunication technologies such as wireless networks like 4G,\n\
    Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, ZigBee. The middleware layer provides\ninter-communication between\
    \ network layer and application\n4\nlayer. It also manages resourses and services\
    \ and performs\noperation the remote database. The application layer is re-\n\
    ceives data from middleware layer. It consists of interface\nmethods and communication\
    \ protocols such as MQTT, AMQL\nand CoAP. It receives encrypted data, decrypts\
    \ it using soft-\nware internally and stores data on the local machine for fu-\n\
    ture use.\n[26], presented IoTA architecture where the 3 main layer\nare discussed.\
    \ Those layer are platform layer, edge layer and\ncommunication layer. The plateform\
    \ layer perform raw data\ncollection IoTA hardwares sensing by the agricultural\
    \ envi-\nronment. The edge layer performs decision making based on\ndata merging\
    \ and processing the sensors data. The commu-\nnication layer comunicates between\
    \ gateway and cloud.\n[32], discussed three layer based IoTA architecture. The\n\
    authors considered device layer, network layer and applica-\ntion layer. They\
    \ did not include middleware layer in their\narticle.\n[33] discussed two categories\
    \ of architecture based on\nholistic IoT applications. That IoT architectures\
    \ were three\nlayered and ﬁve layer according to different vendors of IoT.\nAuthor\
    \ raised the challenge of standarization issue of the\nIoTA architectures.\n[34]\
    \ discussed a common IoTA architecture. The archi-\ntecture consists of three\
    \ layers namely IoTA hardwares, com-\nmunication technologies and data processing\
    \ and storage.\nIoTA hardwares included sensors, actuators, embedded sys-\ntem\
    \ with processor, communication modules, memory, I/O\ninterfaces and battery power.\
    \ The authours have discussed\nvarious communication technoloies such as ZigBee,\
    \ Z-Wave,\n6LoWPAN and NFC, based on various parameters as li-\ncensed, transmission\
    \ distance, frequncy and data rate.\n[35] discussed drawbacks of tradional cloud\
    \ based archi-\ntecture and to overcome the drawbacks they proposed edge\nand\
    \ fog computing architecture for IoTA. The shortcom-\nings of existing system\
    \ were as high energy consumption\nduring agricultural data transfer from and\
    \ to the cloud and\nhigh network traﬁc. The proposed architecture reduces the\n\
    load over cloud layer which minimize the energy consump-\ntion, network traﬁc\
    \ and latency for IoTA applications and\nservices. The proposed architecture consists\
    \ of four layer\nsuch as IoT sensor layer, edge layer, fog layer and cloud\nlayer.\
    \ The IoT sensor layer responsible for all IoTA har-\nwares deployment.The edge\
    \ layer performs computation of\nsensors/actuators data at the edge of the network.\
    \ The fog\nlayer is responsible for process and analyze complex data\nreceived\
    \ from IoTA sensors through edge layer. The cloud\nlayer provides higher scalibility\
    \ and on demand computing\nresources such as storage, networking and processing.\n\
    [36] proposed user centrinc IoTA architecture which con-\nsists of three main\
    \ layers perception layer, communication\nlayer and control layer. The perception\
    \ layer is responsi-\nble for data aquisition via sensors. The communication layer\n\

    \ the network. The control\nlayer works as a decision maker and performs analysis\
    \ of\nthe acquired data.\n[37] proposed IoTA architecture based on the holistic\n\
    IoTA architecture. This proposed architecture contains six\nlayers namely device\
    \ layer, network layer, session layer, ap-\nplication layer, cloud layer, business\
    \ layer. The business layer\nconsists of several business modules where the information\n\
    can be accessed as per the business nature.\nThe comparision in various IoTA architectures\
    \ is pre-\nsented in Table 1. This table includes total number of layers\nused\
    \ in IoTA, layers name and function of each layer.\nAfter the reviewing the previous\
    \ work there is given lay-\nered architecture based on 5 layers as physical layer,\
    \ edge\nlayer, fog layer, application layer and cloud layer. Each lay-\ners described\
    \ in the cronological way are as follows:\nPhysical Layer: The Physical Layer\
    \ consists of physi-\ncal devices like sensors, actuators, SBC (Single Board Com-\n\
    puter) and a gateway in the farm [38]. This layer senses and\ncollects agricultural\
    \ environment based speciﬁc data through\nsensor devices. Based on the speciﬁc\
    \ type of sensor, the col-\nlected data is about location, temperature, orientation,\
    \ mo-\ntion, vibration, acceleration, humidity and chemical changes\nin the air.\
    \ The information is then passed to the Network\nlayer for its secure transmission\
    \ to the information [39]. The\n5\nTable 1: Comparision of Different IoTA Architectures\n\

    \ Layer [40].\nEdge Layer: The edge layer collects raw data from the\nphysical\
    \ layer and proceeds to the network layer based. It\nmerges sensor data and processes\
    \ it [26]. It enables the ac-\ntuators to what the conditioned value has been\
    \ set in the\nﬁrmware of IoTA. For instance, in a smart irrigation sys-\ntem,\
    \ the conditioned unit value for the soil moisture sensor\nis 1000; thus, if the\
    \ sensor provides less than 1000 soil mois-\nture values, the actuation will start.\
    \ Some of the commu-\nnication technologies namely 802.11*, Sigfox, LoRaWAN,\n\
    NBIoT, LTE-3GPP, EC-GPRS, WiMAX, Bluetooth, ZigBee,\nZ-Wave, 6LoWPAN and NFC used\
    \ in IoTA are categorised\nbased on distinct parameters like licenced spectrum,\
    \ trans-\nmission distance, type of network used, frequency, and data\nrate [41]\
    \ [38] [32] [42] [34]. The communication technol-\nogy allows the hardware (in\
    \ the physical layer such as sen-\nsors, actuators and the controller) to communicate\
    \ by wired\nor wireless medium [43]. According to[44], Low-Frequency\nCommunication\
    \ (LFC) is popular in smart villages due to a\nlack of infrastructure. However,\
    \ some prominent high com-\nmunication technology used in IoTA is IEEE 802.15.4,\
    \ Zensy\nWave, Long Term Evolution (LTE), LongRange (LoRa), Near\nField Communication\
    \ (NFC), Ultra-wideband (UWB) and\nothers. These communication technologies help\
    \ to commu-\nnicate hardwares like sensors, actuators in IoTA devices present\n\
    in the farm for are also commonly used in smart villages\nfor different applications\
    \ like postharvest management, cat-\ntle health monitoring and others.\nFog Layer:\
    \ Fog layer is a virtual cloud which recieves\ndata from edge layer and transmits\
    \ it to the upper layers. It\nprocess and analyze complex data received from IoTA\
    \ sen-\nsors through edge layer. It includes fog nodes like gateways,\nrouters,\
    \ entry points, distinct fog servers. The fog nodes sit-\nuates between end devices\
    \ and cloud data centers. This layer\nworks as a local cloud server.It provides\
    \ intra-networked\ncommunication for the IoTA system. By this means the IoTA\n\
    devices communcates through low frequencies and activates\nthe actuators. The\
    \ raw data collected from the sensors do not\nneed to travel frquently over the\
    \ Internet. Hence, the concept\nof fog layer overcomes the drawback like high\
    \ latency be-\ncause of real time control and mitigates security risk about\n\
    data transmission as the Internet were acted as a backbone.\nThus, the compromisation\
    \ of the Internet will lead to com-\nplete obstruction IoTA system [30].\nApplication\
    \ Layer: Application layer consists of vari-\nous communication protocols such\
    \ as HTTP, MQTT, CoAP,\nAMQP and XMPP [45] [46]. This layer provides a graphical\n\
    user interface of the agricultural environment information\nprocessed by the Middleware\
    \ layer in encrypted form and in-\nternally decrypts this information using software,\
    \ thus stores\ndata for further use. The application layer monitors the agri-\n\
    cultural environment and suggests actions to be performed\nto get better throughput\
    \ using IoTA. The applications im-\nplemented by IoTA like smart crop monitoring,\
    \ smart irriga-\ntion, smart fertilizer/pesticides sprinkling, smart greenhouse\n\
    and livestock monitoring. The data is uploaded to the Cloud\nfor data warehousing\
    \ through these applications. Some of\nthe Cloud-based IoTA platforms are AgroCloud,\
    \ AT&T M2X\ncloud, AWS, Azure IoT hub, Blynk, Cropinfra, Dropbox,\nERMES, FIWARE,\
    \ freeboard, Google, GroveStream MACQU,\nMobius, NETPIE, Rural IoT, self-developed,\
    \ SmartFarm-\nNET, ThingSpeak, Ubidots, Nimbits, ThingWorx, Phytech\n[45][46].\n\
    Cloud Layer: The cloud layer works as a centerlised data\nstorage for the IoTA\
    \ system. It receives data through appli-\ncation layer from the fog layer and\
    \ stores it for long time us-\nage. It provides greater scalibility and on demand\
    \ computing\nresources such as storage, networking and processing [35].\n5 IoTA\
    \ Applications\nThe IoTA applications have become very popular among\nfarmers\
    \ due to their efﬁciency and productivity. The IoTA\nsolutions are designed to\
    \ help farmers with time efﬁciency,\nimproved productivity and better monitoring\
    \ of daily agri-\ncultural tasks. Some of the sensors are soil moisture sen-\n\
    sor, temperature sensor, distance sensor, direction sensor,\nlivestock’s temperature\
    \ sensor, humidity sensor, ultrasonic\nsensor, acoustic sensors, leaf sensors,\
    \ stem sensors and fruit\nsize sensor. These sensors have speciﬁc functionality\
    \ in IoT\napplications like identifying environment temperature, crop\nstatus,\
    \ soil preparation, irrigation, pest monitoring and de-\ntection [14]. The IoTA\
    \ applications are classiﬁed into two\ncategories crop and livestock based applications.\
    \ Crop based\nIoTA applications are smart irrigation, frost protection, com-\n\
    post management, pest monitoring, pest controlling, weed\ndetection, chemical\
    \ control, seedbed preparation to reseed-\ning, yield analysis and mapping, arable\
    \ farming, spraying,\nvehicle and machinery control, crop assistant, weather con-\n\
    dition, soil quality, agricultural drones UAV, smart green-\nhouse. The applications\
    \ based on livestock management based\nare livestock monitoring, livestock identiﬁcation,\
    \ milking au-\ntomation technology, early disease detection, offspring man-\n\
    agement and care, smart poultry farming.\n[47] discussed the Niger research project\
    \ to highlight\nthe development of IoT-based smart city and smart village\nfor\
    \ the fulﬁllment of sustainable development goals (SDG-\n2030) 11 and 9 for revolution\
    \ through smart cities and smart\nvillages in Niger.\n[23] mainly focused on holistic\
    \ deﬁnitions of IoTA and\nits applications such as crop health, weeding and spraying,\n\
    planting sowing, seedbed preparation to reseeding, planting\nfrom the air, harvesting\
    \ from the ﬁeld, drones for a ﬁeld,\nyielding analysis and mapping.\n7\n[48] described\
    \ the types of agricultural UAV (Harvesting\nUAV, Spraying UAV, Mapping UAV, Sensing\
    \ UAV), includ-\ning their area of application in terms of seeding, planting\n\
    seed, monitoring, detecting weed, mapping, infestation and\nspraying pesticides/fertilizers,\
    \ forecasting and controlling.\n[49] have discussed IoTA applications that have\
    \ utilized\nmodern technologies like WSN, RFID, Cloud Computing\nand end-user\
    \ applications. These IoTA devices are found\nto be automotive, cost and time-efﬁcient\
    \ for the farmers.\nThe authors have also presented IoTA technologies and the\n\
    classiﬁcation of IoTA applications of monitoring activities.\nThe applications\
    \ are irrigation and water quality monitor-\ning, soil monitoring, weather monitoring,\
    \ farm monitoring),\ndisease and pest control, greenhouse production, automa-\n\
    tion and precision, agricultural machinery and crop manage-\nment with other applications\
    \ in smart farming as smart cat-\ntle farming, smart poultry, smart hatchery,\
    \ smart aquaponics\nand smart beehive monitoring.\n[50] did a comprehensive study\
    \ about crop data man-\nagement in agriculture 5.0. The authors displayed a tabular\n\
    analysis of various crop data management applications and\ntheir main features\
    \ based on parameters, namely software,\ncompany, headquarters and relevant features\
    \ .\n[13] discussed various solutions used in IoTA. Few of\nIoTA solutions are\
    \ water quality monitoring, farm land mon-\nitoring system, greenhouse envioronment\
    \ monitoring sys-\ntem, automated hydroponic system, smart mashrrom farm,\nsmart\
    \ vegitable storage, smart vineyard monitoring system\nand others. They compared\
    \ IoTA monitoring and control\nsystems based on parameters like a gateway, sensor\
    \ and ac-\ntuator, communication system, storage, user interface, ex-\nperiment\
    \ nature (outdoor/indoor), plant name/type, advan-\ntages of the existing system\
    \ and weaknesses in the current\nsystem.\n[46] did a thorough review of IoTA applications.\
    \ Based\non the usage, they classiﬁed IoTA applications into two types,\nIndoor\
    \ (i.e., crop beds, greenhouse, hydroponic) and out-\ndoor (arable land, orchard).\
    \ Some other works include IoT\nbased smart greenhouse and precision farming applications\n\
    [51]. In Europe, there is ongoing work on IoTA based re-\nsearch projects [52].\
    \ The classiﬁcation of holistic IoTA ap-\nplications and various IoTA solutions\
    \ are tabulated Table 2\nrespectively.\nIn the few states of India like Orisa,\
    \ Madhya Pradesh\nfaced the problem of crop vandalization. To deal with this\n\
    situation, IoTA based alarming system has been designed.\nWhenever trespassing\
    \ of the elephants is observed, the smart\ncamera detects the suspected activity\
    \ and an alarming sys-\ntem is activated [53].\nIn the next section, we have specialized\
    \ in CACC and\nDF challenges and issues in the IoTA realms.\n6 Existing Emerging\
    \ Cyber Attacks and Cyber Crime\n(CACC) in IoTA\nCyber attack (CA) is a attack\
    \ based on pertaining to digi-\ntal devices and its nework to disturb distrupt\
    \ or destroy the\nservices of the system. The other aim be perform data theft\n\
    or malicious intension of the attackers. As the CA gets re-\nported into the police\
    \ is called as Cyber Crime (CC). CC is\nan unlawfull activity againsts making\
    \ subotage, disruption\nor harm pertaining to any digital device, network, data,\
    \ or\nany living being.\nA senior vice president, Corey Reed with Deere, admit-\n\
    ted that cybercriminals have been looking for farming infor-\nmation.\nDue to\
    \ the interconnectivity of IoTA devices with the\ninternet, there are the possibility\
    \ of various CACC. The at-\ntackers could drive Sprout into a ditch or a hedge\
    \ or prevent\nit from working. In [2] [74], cyber-attack taxonomy included\nvectors,\
    \ viruses, malware, worms, trojans, ransomware, ad-\nware, zero-day vulnerability,\
    \ Stuxnet, exploit toolkit, Bot-\nnet, Man In The Middle (MITM), phishing and\
    \ spooﬁng,\nside channel, DoS, DDoS, RFID based attacks. These cyber-\nattacks\
    \ have included case studies for IoT smart devices.\n[45] the authors covered\
    \ the simulation tools for the vulnera-\nbility assessment of holistic IoT devices,\
    \ i.e., Bevywise IoT\nSimulator, IoTIFY, CupCarbon U-One, Simple IoT Simula-\n\
    tor, Mimic IoT Simulator, Cooja. The authors suggested se-\ncurity measures and\
    \ precautions for the user only. They had\nemphasized cyber-attacks and security\
    \ measures as well.\nIoT has been emphasized greatly since the 90s, when it\n\
    was proposed as an idea of interconnecting different elec-\ntronic devices through\
    \ various technologies. However, dur-\ning the past decade, IoT has rapidly developed\
    \ without con-\nsidering the profound security goals and challenges involved.\n\
    Consequently, the IoTA will face various emerging CACC.\nAccording to Statista,\
    \ by 2025 there will be 75 billion IoT-\nconnected devices [75]. Due to the rapid\
    \ development, it im-\nplies that checking for the security and vulnerability\
    \ assess-\nment is impossible. The absence of a complete trust zone can\nbe detected\
    \ in the microcontrollers used for IoTA devices.\n[76], ForeScout IoT Enterprise\
    \ Risk Report clearly sug-\ngests that by 2018, two-thirds of enterprises will\
    \ experience\nIoT security breaches. It has captured a broader spectrum of\nthe\
    \ security vulnerabilities and attacks in IoT systems. Their\nclassiﬁcation is\
    \ unique compared to the other classiﬁcations\nas it divides the different attacks\
    \ into four distinct classes;\nPhysical, Network, Software, and Encryption attacks.\
    \ The\nsame statement is true for an IoTA system, where the IoTA\ndevices can\
    \ be attacked physically or at its network or to the\napplications. Similarly,\
    \ the attacks can be tried on encryp-\ntion schemes, as IoTA is implemented using\
    \ various existing\nnetwork technologies.\n8\nTable 2: IoTA Solutions and Techniques\n\

    \ emerging Cyber Attacks (CA) in\nIoTA based on each IoTA layer. The CA on the\
    \ physical\nlayer was autonomous system hijacking/disruption, irregular\nmeasurement,\
    \ node capturing and sleep deprivation. Edge\nlayer based attacks were forged\
    \ for control actuator, boot-\ning, ﬂooding and signature wrapping attack. The\
    \ network\nlayer attacks were DoS, DDoS, data transit attacks, routing\nattacks,\
    \ signal disruption, Radiofrequency (RF) Jamming at-\ntacks, side-channel attacks,\
    \ malware injection, and Botnet\nattacks. An application layer based CA were phishing,\
    \ ma-\nlicious scripts, DoS, or DDoS. Cloud computing attacks and\ncyber terrorism\
    \ are other types of attacks have been dis-\ncussed.\n[78], covered network layer\
    \ based CA in IoTA. These\nattacks are replay attacks on Zigbee protocol that\
    \ can create\ndiﬁculties to implemnting other protocols. The smart farm,\nwhich\
    \ uses IEEE 802.11 protocol, can face attacks like pass-\nword cracking and evil\
    \ twin access point, which allows at-\ntackers to get credentials by creating\
    \ a rogue access point.\nKey reinstallation attack, which exploits 4-way handshake\n\
    in WPA2, which was responsible for securing modern wiﬁ.\nARP spooﬁng attack where\
    \ an attacker fakes the MAC ad-\ndress of the gateway and convinces the victims\
    \ to send frames\nto the fake address except the destination address. DNS spoof-\n\
    ing attacks where the trafﬁc is directed to the fake website\ncause altered DNS\
    \ records.\n[79],discussed UAV oriented CA and its consequences.\nUAV is an automated\
    \ aerial vehicle IoTA system used for\ncrop monitoring, pesticides or chemical\
    \ sprinkling, etc. The\nCA is integrity exploitation of UAV or IoTA devices. The\n\
    consequences of this attack can vandalize the whole stand-\ning crop in the ﬁeld,\
    \ ﬂood the crop, and sprinkle the pesti-\ncides in excess quantity. If such attacks\
    \ are widely coordi-\nnated, they can take the place of agro-terrorism. The authors\n\
    discussed other UAV based CA, such as radio frequency\njamming, malicious code\
    \ injection, MITM, DoS/DDOS, ran-\nsomware attacks, etc. These attacks can tamper/modify\
    \ the\ncommunication devices.\n[80], [81], [82] [49] discussed emerging CA aspects\
    \ in\nIoTA system on the different levels such as physical secu-\nrity of devices\
    \ due to the harsh nature of climate and nat-\nural disaster in IoTA, emerging\
    \ cyber threats like endpoint\nattacks, phishing, third party attack, supply chain\
    \ attacks,\nransomware, state-sponsored IoT attacks, threats in smart\ndevices.\
    \ They speciﬁed risks or dangers in terms of data\nbreaches, data integrity, privacy\
    \ breaches in business secrets,\nrisk of crypto-jacking, cyber-physical attacks,\
    \ state-sponsored\nattacks, highjacking, or threats to autonomous drones or trac-\n\
    tors.\n[83] described the several issues in IoTA caused by the\nInternet connectivity\
    \ for data processing and covered param-\neters based on CA in IoTA. In the IoTA\
    \ system, at the phys-\nical layer, the emerging CA such as unintentional physical\n\
    modiﬁcation in hardwired, temporary or permanent damage,\nautonomous system hijacking,\
    \ autonomous system disrup-\ntion, optical deformation, rough treatment, power\
    \ depletion\nof battery, sensor weakening as per the sensor aging, node\ncapturing,\
    \ adding a malicious node and sleep deprivation.\nIn sleep deprivation attack\
    \ there is draining the battery of\nthe smart devices. Network layer-based emerging\
    \ CA dis-\ncussed as DoS/DDoS, data transit attack, and routing attack.\nThe emerging\
    \ CA at the edge layer can be forged controls\nfor actuators, gateway-cloud request\
    \ forgery, forged mea-\nsure injection, booting, unauthorized access, MITM, signa-\n\
    ture wrapping, and ﬂooding. In the sequence, the concern-\ning CA in the application\
    \ layer is phishing, malicious script,\nDoS, and DDoS attacks. The author emphasized\
    \ the current\nstate of security in smart agriculture as the researcher and\n\
    developer leave default security features for the MQTT and\nCoAP since the researchers’\
    \ probability keeps it disabled.\nMoreover, IoT device manufacturers use IoTs\
    \ to keep them\ninvisible to the security feature, validation processes, col-\n\
    lecting, transferring, or storing phases or failure checks. This\npaper further\
    \ illustrates these invisible parameters for the in-\nvisible security features.\
    \ The authors also suggested a future\nenhancement in the perspective of better\
    \ security in smart\nagriculture and farming applications.\n[84] presented a literature\
    \ survey on CA pertaining to\ndistinct components of IoTA. They have discussed\
    \ attacks\nbased on hardwares like sensors, controllers, RFID tags. Few\nattacks\
    \ based on protocol such as RFID, NFC,bluetooth, wiﬁ,\nZigbee, 6loWPAN, and protocols\
    \ on application layer.\n[85], authors classiﬁed CA in IoTA based on the phys-\n\
    ical layer, network layer, middleware layer, and application\nlayer. The CA on\
    \ the physical layer is such a RF jamming,\nside-channel attack, which aims to\
    \ gather unauthorized in-\nformation regarding the implementation description\
    \ of the\nIoTA system using monitoring parameters of hardware like\nan electric\
    \ current or voltage [86]. Attacks on the network\nlayer are DoS, MITM, and cloud\
    \ computing attacks. At-\ntacks regarding data are data leakage, ransomware, cloud\n\
    data leakage, and misconﬁguration. Application layer based\nattacks are software\
    \ update based attacks such as malware\ninjection, buffer overﬂow and SQL injection.\
    \ Other attacks\nthey have covered are cyber terrorism and invalidation, which\n\
    refers to false data fabrication.\n[87], authors are concerned that exposure of\
    \ personnel’s\nprivate information, social engineering, cyber espionage, and\n\
    agroterrorism to any CA is a potentially severe threat that\nshould be seriously\
    \ and carefully considered.The possibil-\nity of cyber terrorism in the agriculture\
    \ sector is known as\nagroterrorism.\n[88], authors warn the cyber threat risk\
    \ in IoTA, for internet-\nbased automatic functional devices, like smart crop\
    \ sprayers,\ndrones, UAV in agriculture can be hacked.\n10\nCybercriminals are\
    \ looking to ruin the particular revenue\nbusiness, where agriculture plays a\
    \ very important role in\nrevenue generation for the individual and the country.\n\
    [89] homeland security of U.S. department mention the\nconcern potential cyber\
    \ threats and vulnerabilities in IoTA.\nTheir released report disscussed different\
    \ technologies in\nIoTA sucha as on farm device, location or remote sensing\n\
    technologies and machine learning. This report highlights\nhypothetical scenarios\
    \ pertaining to CACC. Likewise IoTA\nbased sensors could be the signaﬁcant cause\
    \ for CACC is-\nsues. A warning from the UK government and FBI states\nthat Cyber\
    \ criminals could exploit ﬂaws present in the IoTA\nhardware which were used to\
    \ plant and harvest crops, such\nas automatic crop sprayers, drones and robotic\
    \ harvesters\nto disrupt the GDP growth, food production of the country\n[90].\
    \ According to an FBI report, CA in IoTA has slowed\ndown the agriculture processing\
    \ system and also interrupted\nthe email communication and website-based administration.\n\
    A cyber crime by disrupting process dairy facilities can quickly\nspoil the result.\
    \ FBI has released a list of cybercrime in agri-\nculture. Where the means of\
    \ cybercrime was a ransomware\nattack, where data was stolen and encrypted, and\
    \ criminals\ndemanded ransom, cyber actors may perceive cooperatives\nas lucrative\
    \ targets with a willingness to pay due to the time-\nsensitive role in agricultural\
    \ production. The goal could be\nto disrupt the seed and fertilizer supplies.\n\
    Various IoT based CACC has been already observed and\nsevere consequences had\
    \ faced by users. [91], the Mirai bot-\nnet in 2016 is an example of DDoS attack\
    \ which was launched\non IoT devices in smart home on a large scale. Similar CA\n\
    are possible in the context of IOTA. The consequences of\nsuch attack can disrupt\
    \ normal functionality of distinct mod-\nules of an individual IoTA farm and leverage\
    \ for interrupt-\ning legitimate cyber services in other areas. [92], the IoTA\n\
    system can be compromised and controlled by utilising cen-\ntral malicious system\
    \ know as Botnet of Things. [93], a CA\nnamed as Night Dragon could steal big\
    \ amount of informa-\ntion from various petrochemical companies. [94], an another\n\
    incidence of devastation using phishing attack attemped on\nGerman steel mill\
    \ for gaining access on network plant pro-\nduction system of the mill ofﬁce.\n\
    The increase in CACC in IoT based devices has become\nthe concern in smart agriculture\
    \ where these CACC can bring\ndevastation to IoTA, crop demage, animal production\
    \ loss\nand vast ecconomical loss.\nIn 2020, JBS, one of the world’s biggest meat\
    \ processing\ncompanies, paid $11 million as a ransome to resolve a CA;\nmalware\
    \ attack that shut down Australian and New Zealand\nwool sales [95]. The US agriculture\
    \ ﬁrm AGCO was af-\nfected production by a ransomware attack. President Greg\n\
    Gatzke of ZAG Technical Services Inc observed losses be-\ntween $40,000 to $200,000\
    \ caused by cyber-criminals [96].\nIn the US, Jan 2021, faced the business lost\
    \ $9 million as cy-\nber criminals inﬁltrated a farm’s internal network via com-\n\
    promised administrative credentials. The total loss derives\nfrom the temporary\
    \ shutdown of operations.\nCo-founder of agricultural ﬁrm Muddy Machines, Chris\n\
    Chavasse, states that the IoTA based devices can be attacked\nand hacked. Their\
    \ study says that IoTA sector is at risk.\nIn industrial espionage, revenge-minded\
    \ employees can\ndamage farmers having a treaty in contract farming with that\n\
    particular company. In the case of IoTA, the farmer/contractor\nmay face severe\
    \ loss due to linked cyber security breaches or\nattacks on the contract provider\
    \ company. Subsequently, se-\nvere data loss/breaches or sabotage might be found\
    \ in IoTA.\nVarious emerging CACC, its consequences on IoTA and un-\nfavourable\
    \ affects on the farming are summarised in Table\n3.\nAgribusiness is suspected\
    \ of attacking and disturbing,\ndisrupting, or destroying its existing functional\
    \ system due\nto its fragility in nature, as IoTA is a hackable and crack-\nable\
    \ system. Consequently, various unsolved cases could be\nfound in the court of\
    \ law. Thus various challenges are being\nfaced in evidence collection and DF\
    \ investigation regarding\nIoTA. The various challenges are discussed in the next\
    \ sec-\ntion.\n7 Digital Forensics Challenges in IoTA\nDF is a superset of cyber\
    \ forensics, which includes forensics\nof all digital devices like computers,\
    \ mobile phones, PDAs,\npalmtops, storage devices, obscure devices like gaming\
    \ de-\nvices, recording devices, digital cameras, IoTs and many\nmore. DF consists\
    \ of the systematic propelled and scientif-\nically proven approach for preservation,\
    \ collection, valida-\ntion, identiﬁcation, analysis, interpretation, documentation\n\
    and presentation of digital evidence [100]. DF is a conven-\ntional technique\
    \ as the law enforcement acknowledges that\nmodern day life includes a distinct\
    \ of devices where IoT is at\nthe top of the list of digital devices. The IoT\
    \ can be exploited\nby criminal activity [101].\nThe IoTA is a subset of IoT.\
    \ It includes a sensor, gate-\nway, network, Internet and the cloud. Thus IoTA\
    \ also in-\nherits properties of DF challenges belong IoT. We have in-\ncluded\
    \ a few articles to discuss various DF challenges and\nissues in IoTA. According\
    \ to the principle of exchange given\nin 1934 by Dr. Edmond Locard (1877-1966),\
    \ \"Every action\nleaves a trace.\" Any action of a crime commiter cannot occur\n\
    without leaving a trace. The Locard’s principle was also de-\nﬁned in the perspective\
    \ of conventional crime that is proved\nin the digital world. The same rule is\
    \ equally applicable in\nthe IoTA.\n11\nTable 3: Emerging CACC and Its Consequences\

    \ into six categories: identiﬁcation, collection, preserva-\ntion, analysis, correlation,\
    \ attack attribution and presenta-\ntion. These challenges are further divided\
    \ into its subclasses.\nThe authors discussed DF challenges for various IoT appli-\n\
    cations except for IoTA.\nThe following section discusses the work done in the\n\
    area of IoT/IoTA forensics. In this article We have classi-\nﬁed related articles\
    \ into different categories, some of which\nare discussed below.\n7.1 Jurisdictions\n\
    [103] identiﬁed the challenge presented as the devices cross\nthe borderline of\
    \ jurisdictions. Likely, data in transit between\nIoTA devices and globally distributed\
    \ cloud computing plat-\nforms cross these borderlines more frequently. It is\
    \ unclear\nunder which law the case should be prosecuted i.e., the de-\nvice jurisdiction,\
    \ the attacker jurisdiction, or the data storage\njurisdiction. For this reason,\
    \ it is necessary to create an in-\nternational commission that updates the current\
    \ legislation\nand can deﬁne uniform procedures in IoT DF [102] [104].\nThe same\
    \ jurisdiction challenge stands for IoTA too.\nAccording to [105], DF is an interdisciplinary\
    \ process of\ninvestigation where cooperation and coordination between\nnations\
    \ is indeed required for transnational law enforcement.\nThe Council of Europe’s\
    \ Convention on Cybercrime formed\na committee, \"Council of Europe, 2001,\" for\
    \ harmonizing\nprocedural and substantive laws related to digital crime and\n\
    evidence among its signatories. The treaty commissions states\nto create standard\
    \ systems of substantive and procedural laws\nprohibiting cyber-criminal conduct\
    \ and investigating crimi-\nnal conduct with computer devices with respective\
    \ to each\ncountry. This treaty includes the number of signatories coun-\ntries\
    \ was 63; the few of 63 counties are USA, Canada, Ger-\nmany, France, Great Britain,\
    \ Italy, Hungary, Israel, Japan.\nThe other high technology nations have not signed\
    \ the treaty\nat the convention. That countries are like the Russian Feder-\n\
    ation, Peoples Republic of China, India, the Islamic Repub-\nlic of Iran, Mexico,\
    \ Pakistan and South Africa) [103].\n7.2 Search and Seizure\nSearch and seizure\
    \ is an essential step in any DF examina-\ntion. However, detecting the presence\
    \ of IoT evidences is\nquite challenging as the IoT devices are designed to work\n\
    passively and autonomously. In most cases, when an IoT de-\nvice is identiﬁed,\
    \ there is no documented method or reliable\ntool to collect residual pieces of\
    \ evidence from the device in\na forensically sound manner [106].\n[107] concerned\
    \ that the standards by which the evi-\ndence is in DF investigations could have\
    \ been altered to ac-\ncommodate the changing nature of the cloud computing en-\n\
    vironment. We believe that the alalogical statement holds for\nIoTA DF investigations\
    \ too. Beyond technical challenges,\nprivacy is a signiﬁcant issue to consider\
    \ when analyzing and\ncorrelating collected data, primarily as most IoT sensors\
    \ col-\nlect innate personal information [106].\n[108] authors reviewed various\
    \ DF limitations and chal-\nlenges in IoT. Those limitations include impracticability\
    \ of\ncloning of all data by a service provider, requirement of ex-\ncess time\
    \ in data acquisition and other challenges.\n7.3 Identiﬁcation\nIn the term of\
    \ IoT based DF investigation, the question arises\nof whether to investigate devices\
    \ or data in the case of cloud\nor else the devices may be viewed as a metadata\
    \ aspect of\nthe data or if the reverse is true, the cloud computing ar-\nchitectures\
    \ (PaaS, SaaS, IaaS) allow data fragmentation and\ndistribution among different\
    \ countries and continents [109].\nAs IoTA is one of the applications, IoT may\
    \ face the same\nchallenge in the identiﬁcation phase of the investigation.\n\
    7.4 Preservation\nIn evidence, the acquisition is to maintain the integrity of\n\
    the evidence collected. The most frequently used technique\nfor computers and\
    \ phones is calculating a hash to assure\nintegrity. The question arises about\
    \ calculating hash at the\ntime of creating an image. The problem here is the\
    \ lack of\navailable tools that can prevent accidental changes in the IoT\nbased\
    \ evidence [103].\n7.5 Challenge in imaging\nThe challenge of the acquisition\
    \ is to decide whether to cre-\nate an image of an endpoint or to acquire it physically.\
    \ In the\ncase of computer crimes, the standard practice is to create a\nworking\
    \ copy/image of the storage media and seal the actual\nmedia to avoid accidental\
    \ alteration in the actual evidence.\nSince the endpoints in IoT crime scenes,\
    \ excluding comput-\ners and smartphones, may store minimal or sometimes no\n\
    information, creating an image of those IoT nodes is com-\nplicated. If a component\
    \ stores some information, then it\nshould be technically possible to create an\
    \ image of that de-\nvice. The suggested way is to create images from available\n\
    sources [106].\n7.6 Analysis and correlation\nThe huge amount of data collected\
    \ in diverse type of IoT\ndevices makes it nearly impossible to provide an end\
    \ to end\n15\nanalysis of residual evidence. IoTA is a frequently evolv-\ning\
    \ technologies. Hence different Operating Systems (OS),\nvarious ﬁle formats and\
    \ distinct cryptographic methods. The\nExisting digital forensics tools or methodologies\
    \ do not sup-\nport for data extraction from emerging IoTA devices [102].\n7.7\
    \ Absence of Standard IoTA Architecture\nThe different standards for IoTA architecture\
    \ are followed\nby manufacturers, the lack of cooperation, and the many pe-\n\
    culiarities are the terrible thing about the IoT working within\nthe same area\
    \ of application. Due to the lack of standardiza-\ntion of IoTA architecture,\
    \ the smart irrigation system facil-\nitated by one manufacturer and the smart\
    \ crop monitoring\nsystem by another manufacturer can have problems in coor-\n\
    dination. The absence of a standard IoTA architecture chal-\nlenges the design\
    \ of the standard DF framework.\n7.8 Malware\nIn [97], the authors discussed various\
    \ research challenges in\nIoT forensics. The challenges are the complexity and\
    \ versa-\ntility of IoT devices, lack of standard IoT architecture, ev-\nidence\
    \ contamination due to overwriting data, and use of\nconventional tools forensics\
    \ tools.\n8 Discussion\nIoTA is the highest trending technology in human life\
    \ to\nmake life much easier, faster and more comfortable. Accord-\ning to Cisco\
    \ Internet Business Solution Group (IBSG), IoT\nwas born between 2008 - 2009,\
    \ with an average of 1.84 IoTs\nper person; the propositional logic can be derived\
    \ from this\nIBSG statistics that people will possess 10 IoTs per person\non an\
    \ average, in the coming age. Thus this ﬁeld requires\nthe most potential to research\
    \ in the IoTA domain to better\nits characteristics and work on its challenges.\n\
    This literature review is focused on IoTA. The rationale\nof this study is helpful\
    \ to understand IoTA architecture and\nits working environment from the physical\
    \ layer to the ap-\nplication layer from different authors’ perspectives. We have\n\
    included IoTA architecture, emerging CA, cyber crimes and\nDF investigation challenges\
    \ about IoT based Agriculture (IoTA).\nWe have done a comprehensive study about\
    \ the DF chal-\nlenges and issues that can have obstacles in this growing era\n\
    of IoTA and possible crime and related that scenario pre-\ncisely with IoTA. Many\
    \ challenges are discussed in previous\npapers. Those challenges include Jurisdiction\
    \ at IoT crime\nscenes, lack of available tools and documentation methods,\npreservation,\
    \ imaging, evidence analysis and correlation. There\ncan be future work on these\
    \ challenges, so the data must\nbe presentable in a court of law. In this review\
    \ work, we\nleft out elaborative discussion about all the IoTA based ap-\nplications,\
    \ deﬁnitions for IoT sensors, protocols, communi-\ncation technology, vulnerabilities,\
    \ cyber-attack, cybercrime,\ncybersecurity and DF, which can be added in the subsequent\n\
    study.\nThe concerning point of a literature review is that the\nauthors’ statement\
    \ was based on assumptions. The articles\nwere not found assured about CACC issues\
    \ in IoTA solu-\ntions. These weaknesses of the IoT system could be tested\nfor\
    \ being assured CACC. Consequently, the manufacturer\nand security experts would\
    \ have saved their time in ﬁnding\ncyber threats for each IoTA device with all\
    \ aspects through\nproactive measures.\nAs a part of the study, there has been\
    \ found a scarcity of\narticles on IoTA based cyber crime and DF discussion. Thus\n\
    the researchers can further explore emerging CACC and DF\ninvestigation based\
    \ on IoTA in this article to have survey\nbased insights. There must be readiness\
    \ for IoTA based CC\nand DF investigation process for running an agriculture busi-\n\
    ness (agribusiness) and to justice for the victim. The fail-\nure to prove the\
    \ suspect will cause the encourage CACC\nin IoTA. Those CACC will be responsible\
    \ for disturbing,\ndisrupting, or even destroying the IoTA system in agribusi-\n\
    ness. It will directly demotivate agribusiness persons to con-\ntribute to crop\
    \ and food production. Subsequently, individ-\nual agribusiness people, consumers,\
    \ laymen, countries and\nthe nation’s GDP could be affected. Thus there is an\
    \ urgent\nneed to have readiness towards CACC and DF in IoTA. It is\nalso observed\
    \ that most experiments were not conducted in\na practice environment and seemed\
    \ just an assumption. To\nsolve more real-time problems, researchers should also\
    \ ex-\nperiment with these techniques on real-world solutions for\nIoTA.\n9 Conclusion\n\
    It is a concerning point in SDG 2030; goal 2 is to promote\nsustainable agriculture\
    \ to achieve zero hunger. To smart agri-\nculture and farming the practice effectively,\
    \ IoTA is applied\nin almost all ﬁelds of agriculture, such as farm monitor-\n\
    ing, irrigation, pest monitoring, livestock monitoring, smart\ngreenhouse, smart\
    \ poultry farm and so on. Existing smart\nfarming techniques are classiﬁed and\
    \ reviewed; from this\nstudy, it is understood that researchers should concentrate\n\
    more on readiness for emerging CACC for IoTA applica-\ntions or tools. The readiness\
    \ will provide non-interruptable\nservices. There is a need to be readiness for\
    \ DF investiga-\ntion for IoTA speciﬁcally which will make a robust judicial\n\
    system and strengthen the judicial system by catching the\nnatural suspected person.\n\

    extract_1: MQTT and CoAP are lightweight, real-time communication protocols that
      are well-suited for IoT applications. MQTT is a publish/subscribe protocol that
      allows devices to communicate with each other without the need for a central
      server. CoAP is a request/response protocol that is designed for resource-constrained
      devices. Both MQTT and CoAP are widely used in IoT applications, and they are
      supported by a variety of hardware and software platforms.
    extract_2: 'The proposed architecture consists of four layers: the perception
      layer, the network layer, the middleware layer, and the application layer. The
      perception layer is responsible for collecting data from sensors. The network
      layer is responsible for transmitting data to the middleware layer. The middleware
      layer is responsible for processing data and generating insights. The application
      layer is responsible for presenting insights to the user and controlling the
      irrigation system.'

  explanation: Two main architectures of smart vertical farms are widely used, known
    as Open Controlled Architecture and Closed Controlled Architecture. Open controlled
    architecture allows air circulation inside the farm for the growth of crops, while
    the closed controlled architecture is isolated from the outside air, which is
    controlled by artificial lighting.

    \ to the ongoing domestic and international\nlockdown for COVID-19. Many have\
    \ already lost their jobs, and businesses have been unstable in the\nCorona era.\
    \ Apart from educational institutions, banks, privately owned institutions, and\
    \ agriculture,\nthere are signs of economic recession in almost all sectors. The\
    \ roles of modern technology, the\nInternet of things, and artiﬁcial intelligence\
    \ are undeniable in helping the world achieve economic\nprosperity in the post-COVID-19\
    \ economic downturn. Food production must increase by 60% by\n2050 to meet global\
    \ food security demands in the face of uncertainty such as the COVID-19 pandemic\n\
    and a growing population. Given COVID 19’s intensity and isolation, improving\
    \ food production\nand distribution systems is critical to combating hunger and\
    \ addressing the double burden of\nmalnutrition. As the world’s population is\
    \ growing day by day, according to an estimation world’s\npopulation reaches 9.6\
    \ billion by 2050, so there is a growing need to modify the agriculture methods,\n\
    technologies so that maximum crops can be attained and human effort can be reduced.\
    \ The urban\nsmart vertical farming (USVF) is a solution to secure food production,\
    \ which can be introduced at\nany adaptive reuse, retroﬁt, or new buildings in\
    \ vertical manners. This paper aims to provide a\ncomprehensive review of the\
    \ concept of USVF using various techniques to enhance productivity\nas well as\
    \ its types, topologies, technologies, control systems, social acceptance, and\
    \ beneﬁts. This\nreview has focused on numerous issues, challenges, and recommendations\
    \ in the development of the\nsystem, vertical farming management, and modern technologies\
    \ approach.\nKeywords: automation; smart vertical farming; sensors; Internet of\
    \ Things; urban farming\n1. Introduction\nIn the 21st century, urbanization will\
    \ be faster, and the population will reach 6.3 billion\nby 2050. 67.2% or 6.5\
    \ billion of these, are expected to live in urban areas [1]. To feed this\ngrowing,\
    \ increasingly urbanized population, the United Nations estimates food demand\n\
    needs to rise by 70% [2,3]. Rapid changes in urban built-up areas and skylines\
    \ in providing\nbuildings and infrastructures to cater to the city center’s larger\
    \ population have altered the\nurban climate into unhealthy living conditions.\
    \ This situation threatens the demand for\nthe basic needs of urban dwellers for\
    \ a livable urban living environment. Furthermore, a\nlarger urban population\
    \ also demands a fresh and good quality food supply [4]. Urban\nsmart vertical\
    \ farming (USVF) is one of the potential solutions to help societies meet this\n\
    elevated demand without additional farmland [5–7]. Figure 1 shows the statistical\
    \ data\nabout the use of vertical farming (VF) market in the world 2019 and 2025\
    \ respectively. In\nrecent years, the global VF market has been increasing steadily\
    \ as population sizes grow\nand urban living becomes more common in urban cities.\
    \ The VF industry reached some\n$4.4 billion in 2019, but the market size is estimated\
    \ to rise to $15.7 billion by 2025. The\nopportunity to utilize vertical space\

    \ plays a vital role in every ﬁeld of life. Some examples are\nmanufacturing,\
    \ transportation, agriculture, utilities, defense, facility operation [16,17].\
    \ The\nbeneﬁts of automation can be applied in water and wastewater, oil and gas,\

    \ in many ﬁelds because it\nreduces human effort, is easy to handle, and is more\

    \ most of the agriculture ﬁelds’ processes, such\nas controlling watering systems\
    \ or ﬂow control and moisture control [18,19]. Similarly, it\ncan build a robot/drone\

    \ for such purposes: a user-friendly farm automation system, easy user control\n\
    for a layman, control water, plant health condition, and crop production [21].\n\
    In terms of human health, the World Health Organization estimates that more than\n\
    half of the world’s farms still use untreated animal waste as fertilizer, which\
    \ attracts ﬂies\nand may contain weed seeds or diseases that can be transmitted\
    \ to plants. VF has the ability\nto produce crops throughout the year, with greater\
    \ control over food safety and biosecurity,\nwhile also lowering inputs such as\
    \ water, pesticides, herbicides, and fertilizers [7]. Food\nprotection is a major\
    \ concern of our day, as there have been several incidents of events\naround the\
    \ world resulting in food recalls due to bacterial infectious diseases, resulting\n\
    in billion-dollar losses. After the crop has been picked, the washing of ﬁeld-grown\
    \ items\nposes a further risk of infection from various bacteria and pathogens.\
    \ This stage, on the\nother hand, has the potential to contaminate the entire\
    \ manufacturing process [22]. While\nthe whole world is badly affected by COVID-19,\
    \ the terrible clutches of natural disasters\nstill plague many people worldwide.\
    \ All scientists’ projections show that the number and\nseverity of climate-related\
    \ disasters are increasing due to climate change, which is cutting\noff the COVID\

    \ the features of the 21st century will be deforestation,\nbiodiversity loss,\
    \ climate chaos, and global epidemics; COVID-19 might be the latest\nmanifestation\
    \ of this, which has pointed to the horrible meaning of ‘global economy crisis\n\
    emergency’. Since COVID-19 will have a long-term impact, now is the time to prepare\
    \ to\nintroduce USVF.\nUSVF should become an opportunity for urban dwellers to\
    \ producing their food,\ndespite the limited agricultural land in the city center.\
    \ Integration of any available potential\nspaces inside and outside the building\
    \ by adaptive reuse and retroﬁt as part of the urban\nfarming (UF) technology\
    \ should be taken seriously and fully utilized. The design should\nconsider less\
    \ human intervention in operation due to the hectic life of urbanites. An appli-\n\
    cation of the Internet of things (IoT) can be incorporated into monitoring and\
    \ controlling in\nthe USVF system [23,24]. Thus, the UF technology can have bigger\
    \ involvement and contri-\nbution of urban dwellers. Besides producing their foods,\
    \ it contributes to the improvement\nin a healthy living environment and on urban\
    \ microclimate. UF offers an once-in-a-lifetime\nchance to grow food on already\
    \ built soil, maximize domestic food production, and reduce\nfood travel distances.\n\
    This study will include an in-depth examination of the philosophy of USVF as a\
    \ means\nof enhancing efﬁciency, including its forms, topologies, technologies,\
    \ control structures,\nsocial acceptance, and beneﬁts. This review concentrated\
    \ on a variety of issues, challenges,\nand recommendations related to the system’s\
    \ growth, vertical farming management, and\nmodern technology approach. The importance\
    \ of USVF how it plays a vital role in the\neconomy serve as the starting point\
    \ for this review. As the world’s population is growing\nday by day, there is\
    \ a need to modify those orthodox agriculture methods to fulﬁll the\nincreasing\
    \ demand for food. This modiﬁcation can be done by automating the agriculture\n\
    farm. This idea of agriculture farm automation wants to control water consumption,\
    \ the\nmoisture level of soil and water ﬂow, topologies, technologies, control\
    \ systems, social\nacceptance and enables an agricultural business to be more\
    \ productive, efﬁcient and\nproﬁtable.\n2. Types, General Structure and Materials\
    \ of Vertical Farming\nVertical farming (VF) is a practical technology through\
    \ which large quantities of food\ncrops and medicinal plants can be produced in\
    \ a very small space only with the help of\nadvanced technology [25].\n2.1. Types\
    \ of Vertical Farm\nVF is practiced in about 13 different ways in the modern world\
    \ and each way is so\ntechnologically advanced that it is enough to revolutionize\
    \ agriculture [26]. The following\nsection represents a few types of VF utilized\
    \ for smart UF that are rapidly evolving,\ndiversifying, and improving in the\
    \ future of agriculture [7].\n2.1.1. Hydroponics\nHydroponics is a system that\
    \ can be called a key part of VF [26,27]. Very slowly,\nthis system has gained\
    \ popularity. Hydroponics is an approach to developing vegetation\nbarring soil.\
    \ Instead of having their roots supported and nourished by soil, the plant is\
    \ often\nirrigated and supported with the aid of an inert developing medium like\
    \ cocopeat and is\nfed through nutrient-rich water that is indispensable to maintain\
    \ plant growth. Hydroponic\nstructures use 60–70% much less water than regular\
    \ conventional agriculture [28,29]. In\nthis method, the plant roots are immersed\
    \ in the mixture of essential nutrients of the plant\ninstead of the soil, in\
    \ which case the nutrients have to be mixed in the right proportions.\nFigure\
    \ 2 shows the structure of the hydroponics VF in Sweden [30]. Hydroponic VF\n\
    provides many advantages over traditional agriculture, including more productive\
    \ use\nof water and soil, and a substantial reduction in transport costs is carried\
    \ out in urban\nElectronics 2021, 10, 1422\n4 of 40\nareas. However, this paradigm\

    [45,46]. Although the use of this technology in indoor VF will be more costly\
    \ due to the \nuse of artificial materials, the cost will be higher due to the\

    \ of soil which widely\nused in advanced greenhouses worldwide.\n2.3.2. Lighting\n\
    Lighting plays an important role in making food for a crop in VF [53]. In the\
    \ VF\nsystem, since the trees are one on top of the other, sunlight cannot reach\
    \ the trees in the\nmiddle of the day. However, to solve this problem, the trees\
    \ should be kept in a place\nwhere they get enough sunlight at the beginning of\
    \ the day and artiﬁcial light all time. The\nconventional light-emitting diode\
    \ (LED) technologies produce 28% efﬁciency. However,\nmaking an indoor agriculture\
    \ system cost-effective LED requires more efﬁciency, at least\naround 50–60% [54,55].\
    \ The work in [55] proposed two techniques LED or high-pressure\nsodium, to overcome\
    \ such lighting issues to grow better crops in VF. In [56], the authors\nindicated\
    \ the application of LED as greenhouse lighting, and it becomes popular in VF\
    \ in\nterms of its lower energy requirements, long lifetime, low cost.\nPlants\
    \ require blue light with a wavelength of 610–720 nm and red light with a\nwavelength\
    \ of 400–520 nm. The study in [57], evaluated the use of LEDs in place of natural\n\
    light to illuminate the plant. The ﬁndings indicated that the LED light would\
    \ assist plants\nin growing with the used of 3:1 ratio of red and blue LED light\
    \ to produce a reddish purple\ncolor. The perfect color combination for plants\
    \ and vegetables has been determined to be\nblue and red. This composition is\
    \ ideal for promoting rapid plant growth. The combination\nof 23% blue and 77%\
    \ red produces optimal plant growth performance [58].\n2.3.3. Solar PV\nSolar\
    \ PV is a farming method but different from the other traditional methods such\
    \ as\nrooftop VF. It is gaining more popularity in terms of enormous used solar\
    \ which is available\nin the urban area [59]. Usually, the crop growth boosts\
    \ up in the VF by photosynthetic\nactive radiation, and it is not enough Solar\
    \ power must be collected by a collection of\nmirrors from the city’s structures\
    \ to reduce the need for supplemental artiﬁcial light [60].\nAs a result, VF is\
    \ looking for alternatives by looking at solar PV as a source of energy.\n2.3.4.\
    \ Water\nIn agriculture such as VF, water is used to produce fresh crops. The\
    \ use of agricultural\nwater makes it possible to produce crops, vegetables. The\
    \ study in [61] addressed a VF\ntechnology that requires 70% less water and the\
    \ amount of water required is also recyclable.\nHistorically, users of traditional\
    \ agricultural systems were expected to manually check the\nwater level in their\
    \ water tanks. Moreover, uncontrolled water use leads to wastage of\nwater, which\
    \ ultimately causes water scarcity to terminate. In [25], the author indicated\n\
    that showers and washing hand water could be used by ﬁltered other than rainwater\
    \ in\nthe smart VF system, which may help optimize water use. In [61,62], the\
    \ authors indicated\nthrough the geoponics method, water utilizes less than 70%\
    \ in VF, while the hydroponics\ntechnique still using 70% water. Water automation\
    \ systems can be used in VF technologies\nto reduce human effort and error. Additionally,\
    \ users can use an Android program to turn\non and off the water pump. This is\
    \ an effective and cost-effective method of minimizing\nwater waste and human\
    \ labor. Additionally, [62] addressed an integrated device built on\nan Android\
    \ application that controls and tests the water pump and water level in smart\n\
    farming (SF).\n3. Technologies in Smart Vertical Farming\nVF is a state-of-the-art\

    \ and range [25,63]. The aim of this study, sincerity towards USVF\nand the use\

    \ in the soil. It can be used to measure the soil saturation (i.e., the fraction\n\
    of the total volume of the soil which is ﬁlled with the soil aqueous solution).\
    \ It can be\nused to determine the relationship of moisture at depth to the moisture\
    \ at the unit surface\narea. This method is also comparable with other parameters\
    \ such as precipitation, deep\ndrainage, and transpiration.\nElectronics 2021,\
    \ 10, 1422\n12 of 40\npH Sensor\nA pH sensor is an electronic device that utilizes\
    \ to measure acidity, power of hydrogen\nvalue, and alkalinity of substances.\
    \ The use of pH sensors plays a vital role in the industry,\nagriculture, manufacturing,\
    \ pharmaceutical, etc. [21,84,85]. In [84,86], the authors indicated\nusing a\
    \ pH sensor to ﬁnd the nutrient level of agriculture soil that connects to the\
    \ Arduino\nmicrocontroller, reducing fertilizers used in smart agriculture. The\
    \ authors also addressed\npH sensors to collect and monitor real data from different\
    \ soil of SF, which save to cloud\nserver. However, the unnecessary growth of\
    \ the plant in the agriculture farm does not\ngrow well for crops. Therefore,\
    \ to overcome such a problem, pH sensor plays a vital role\nin SF.\nSensor of\
    \ Electrical Conductivity\nThe electrical conductivity sensor is largely used\
    \ in SF to measure the soil solute\nconcentration [87,88]. However, there are\
    \ still some limitations to use it properly in the SF.\nIn [88], the authors addressed\
    \ the soil contains some water and salt that harmful to grow\nup crops, which\
    \ can measure using an electrical conductivity sensor based on Faraday’s\nlaw.\
    \ The study in [89] showed an electrical conductivity sensor used to overcome\
    \ soil\nlimitations, such as measuring soil pore water, reducing cost and saving\
    \ working time.\nTemperature Sensor\nUsually, temperature sensors are used to\
    \ measure soil temperature in the farm\nplant [90,91]. The work in [90] indicated\
    \ the importance of plant growth based on tem-\nperature control processes such\
    \ as photosynthesis, transpiration, absorption. In [92], the\nauthors proposed\
    \ an aeroponic system in agriculture, which indicated plant growth and\ndevelopment\
    \ through temperature. Therefore, the temperature sensor plays an important\n\
    role to measure soil temperature, which increases the efﬁciency of plant growth\
    \ and more\ncrops.\nElectromagnetic Sensor\nElectromagnetic sensors calculate\
    \ the potential of soil particles to conduct or produce\nelectrical charge using\
    \ electric circuits [73,93]. As these sensors are used, the soil is now an\nelectromagnetic\
    \ loop, and any changes in local conditions have an instant impact on the\noutput\
    \ captured by a data acquisition system. In [93], the authors indicated electromagnetic\n\
    sensors for soil measure have become smaller, more rugged, faster, more accurate,\
    \ more\nenergy-efﬁcient, wireless, and smarter.\n3.3. Smartphone Sensor Technologies\
    \ in Smart Farming\nTelecommunications advances are allowing the rapid and more\
    \ reliable delivery of\nsensed data on a global scale. A sensor is a device that\
    \ detects and reacts to an electri-\ncal signal. Traditional phone sensing systems\
    \ need additional infrastructure, which is\nunaffordable to the majority of consumers.\
    \ Smartphones have advanced at a breakneck\npace in recent years, and they have\
    \ evolved into an integral part of everyday life. The\nsensors embedded in them\
    \ allow a variety of mobile application, which are assisting and\ntransforming\
    \ our way of life. Mobile sensors technology can enhance UF by improving\nconnectivity,\
    \ increasing the ﬂow of information, ensuring traceability for large buyers, and\n\
    creating economic opportunities [94,95]. This section illustrates concepts of\
    \ mobile sensors\ntechnology in SF that are currently using in the smartphone\
    \ and comparison among several\nresearch outcomes.\nSensors are a tool that measures\
    \ a physical amount and converts to a signal which\ncan be read and utilized by\
    \ other devices. Most of the mobile sensors are equipped on\nsmartphones. Numerous\
    \ forms of sensors are available nowadays, and several common\nsmartphones include\
    \ accelerometers, GPS, illumination sensors, temperature sensors, gy-\nroscope,\
    \ and barometer. These sensors evolved into a high-quality database for tracking\n\
    many facets of a user’s everyday activities. Three types of sensors are installed\
    \ in smart-\nElectronics 2021, 10, 1422\n13 of 40\nphones: motion sensors, ambient\
    \ sensors, and location sensors [94]. The following Table 1\nsummarizes and illustrates\
    \ a set of popular sensors found in today’s mainstream smart-\nphones. The ﬁrst\
    \ category, motion sensors such as accelerometers, gyroscopes, gravity\nsensors,\
    \ and rotational vector sensors, provides acceleration force and rotational force\
    \ mea-\nsurements. Environmental sensors, on the other hand, provide observations\
    \ of the ambient\nenvironment. This includes measuring the ambient air temperature\
    \ with a thermometer\nand the atmospheric pressure with a barometer, as well as\
    \ lighting with a photometer. Place\nsensors, on the other hand, provide information\
    \ about the physical location of the system.\nMagnetometers, GPS, and orientation\
    \ sensors are examples of location sensors [94].\nTable 1. Familiar smartphone\

    damage and can warn the user.\n3.3.1. Accelerometer Sensor\nAccelerometer sensors\
    \ are largely used in the SF to predict and assist with necessary\nmaintenance\
    \ [96,97]. The study reported in [96] presented accelerometer sensor plays an\n\
    important role in monitoring the conventional use of equipment in the SF. In [98],\
    \ the\nauthors indicated accelerometer sensors detect running components or motor’s\
    \ health\nconditions through motion, speed, vibration inconsistencies. Therefore,\
    \ users can easily\ntrack the component health condition using an android application\
    \ in SF.\n3.3.2. Gyroscope Sensor\nA gyroscope is a system that uses the theory\
    \ of conservation of angular momentum\nto determine or retain orientation. Nowadays,\
    \ gyroscope sensors are used in a variety of\nareas, including science ﬁction\
    \ and mobile devices [94,99]. In [94], the authors indicated a\ngyroscope sensors\
    \ application to detect conventional equipment rotation in SF using an\nandroid\
    \ phone. However, the drawback of this gyroscope sensors application in smart\
    \ VF\nElectronics 2021, 10, 1422\n14 of 40\ndifﬁcult to implement in terms of\
    \ requiring a complex mathematical model to conducts a\nsignal.\n3.3.3. Light\
    \ Sensor\nThe term “smart agriculture techniques” refers to the practice of using\
    \ a sensor system\nto regulate the amount of light available [100,101]. The light\
    \ sensor is a semiconductor chip\nthat detects the presence or absence of light\
    \ and darkness. Photoresistors, photodiodes,\nand phototransistors are all examples\
    \ of light sensors. The study in [100] proposed artiﬁcial\nlighting as a suitable\
    \ option to conﬁrm most of the time availability of light for the healthy\nplant\
    \ in smart agriculture. However, the drawback of artiﬁcial lighting in the SF\
    \ fault\nﬁnds out and unnecessary light in the daytime. Therefore, to detect the\
    \ fault and On/OFF\nartiﬁcial light system in the smart farm using an android\
    \ phone application which reduces\nthe human effort and optimize cost [102].\n\
    3.3.4. Magnetometer Sensor\nBasically, magnetometer sensors are used in SF to\
    \ measure the direction of the workers,\nsuch as walk forwards, walk backward,\
    \ run, harvest fruit. The advantages of using the\nsensors by mobile phone which\
    \ help farmers with decision-making, enabling them to have\na deeper, richer knowledge\
    \ about their farms [94].\n3.3.5. Proximity Sensor\nThe proximity sensors utilize\
    \ to monitor crop ﬂow during collection data in VF [94].\nIn [71], the authors\
    \ usually indicated crop plant temperature control from a heat source\nmeasured\
    \ by a proximity sensor in SF. The study in [94,103] reported proximity sensors\
    \ are\nutilized to measure grain yield in the agriculture farm, which helps to\
    \ reduce human effort,\nmeasure accurate crop, save time, and can work in harsh\
    \ environmental conditions. How-\never, proximity sensors’ drawbacks can detect\
    \ only the metallic target, and the operation\nrange also limited.\n3.3.6. Humidity\
    \ Sensor\nNowadays, the demand for humidity sensors is gaining popularity in SF\
    \ [104,105].\nThe work in [105] addressed humidity sensors play an important role\
    \ in SF, such as tracking\nthe water level of plants, environmental monitoring,\
    \ which suitable time for proper crop\nselection. The authors also indicated the\
    \ humidity sensors are steady and ﬂexible at\nmeasure bio-interface. Nevertheless,\
    \ challenges still occur for the awareness of capable\nand wide-scale manufacture\
    \ of adjustable humidity sensors for bio-interface applications.\nIn [106], the\
    \ authors indicated humidity sensors increase their demand in agriculture\nfarming\
    \ by controlling the humidity created by porous materials, namely metal-organic\n\
    structure due to their large porosity and tunable shape. However, the drawback\
    \ of this\nmetal-organic structure is its response time is high and displays a\
    \ narrow sensing range.\n3.3.7. Carbon-Based Sensor\nThe carbon-based sensor has\
    \ many beneﬁts as opposed to other types of sensors. The\ncarbon-based structures\
    \ used in sensor applications are carbon nanotube (CNT), nanodia-\nmond (ND),\
    \ fullerene (FLN) and graphene (GPN). Due to their superior electrical, thermal,\n\
    mechanical, and chemical properties, nanodiamonds, fullerenes, graphenes, nanotubes,\n\
    and hybrid structures have been widely used. Carbon nanostructures, as described\
    \ in [107],\nexhibit a high degree of selectivity, especially when functionalized.\
    \ Carbon nanostructures\nhave grown in popularity as gas sensor applications due\
    \ to their promising structure,\nwhich enables gas detection and quantiﬁcation.\
    \ The high surface-to-volume ratio and\nhollow composition make this material\
    \ suitable for gas adsorption and desorption. The\nidentiﬁcation and quantiﬁcation\
    \ of polluting gases, especially hydrogen sulﬁde (H2S),\ncarbon monoxide (CO),\
    \ carbon dioxide (CO2), nitrogen oxide (NOx), ammonia (NH3), and\nmethane, is\
    \ one of the primary applications of carbonaceous materials as gas sensors (CH4).\n\
    Electronics 2021, 10, 1422\n15 of 40\nThe special properties of nanomaterials,\
    \ such as their compact scale, large surface area, and\nreactivity, make them\
    \ ideal for use in agriculture. CNTs (carbon nanotubes) are primarily\nused in\
    \ agriculture for germination rate, initial crop production, pesticides, and biosensor\n\
    diagnostic tools and evaluation [108]. Nanotechnology is important in the puriﬁcation\n\
    of water. Carbon nanotubes can be used to purify wastewater [109,110]. Adsorption\
    \ and\ndegradation/detoxiﬁcation are the primary strategies for removing contaminants\
    \ from\nsamples using carbon nanotubes. Additionally, not only is it necessary\
    \ to remove toxins\nfrom various environmental compartments, but it is also necessary\
    \ to control pollution\nlevels. Carbon-based nanomaterials can be used to create\
    \ novel, highly effective biochemi-\ncal sensors for the detection of chemical\
    \ compounds at extremely low concentrations in\na variety of environments. In\
    \ [111], the authors stated that carbon-based nanomaterials\nwill account for\
    \ 40% of all nanotechnology contributions to agriculture, both as additives\n\
    and active parts. The bulk of these implementations are currently in their infancy,\
    \ and this\nsection will highlight some interesting methods.\n3.4. Sensors Technology\
    \ in Farming to Monitoring of the Healthy Growth of Crops\nThe proper growth of\
    \ plants is important to enhance the quality of the crop in the smart\nVF. The\
    \ economic and beneﬁt depend on the proper healthy growth of the plant. However,\n\
    there are some essential elements that are required for the growth of plants,\
    \ such as crop life,\nnutrients, crops health condition, and micronutrients [112,113].\
    \ Therefore, monitoring the\nhealth condition of each plant of agriculture farming\
    \ is essential [114]. Therefore, different\ntypes of sensors utilize to overcome\
    \ such issues in smart VF. Table 2 shows the summary of\nthe method used for crop\
    \ health growth monitoring using a different type of camera model\nsensors in\
    \ SF. This list consists of various types, brands, model numbers and application\
    \ in\nSF. The sensor application in SF includes counting faster crop damage accuracy,\
    \ monitoring\nand detecting defect crop growth, and diagnosing the nitrogen of\
    \ crop and tracking leaf\ndamage from the insect.\nTable 2. Review of methods\

    Electronics 2021, 10, 1422\n17 of 40\nIn [115,128] authors proposed Canon PowerShot\
    \ SX20 and Canon PowerShot SX30\nsensors in farming applications because of cheap,\
    \ easy to manage, and potential versatility\nto count faster crop damage accuracy.\
    \ The study in [116,122] reported a Canon EOS REBEL\nT2i and Sony DSC-W80 sensors\
    \ in agriculture application used to monitor and detect crop\ngrowth. However,\
    \ these sensors’ drawback is that image quality is still inferior and not\nperforming\
    \ well in low light. On the other hand, its advantage performs well in a suitable\n\
    lighting atmosphere and low cost. In [117,121], the authors reported visible spectrum\n\
    cameras and 8 MP camera sensors to measure the early stages of crops grown in\
    \ SF\napplications. The merit of such sensors might work in various lighting environments\
    \ with\nstrong controlling efﬁciency and robustness. Therefore, it is suitable\
    \ for VF applications.\nThe study reported in [119,124] proposed high-resolution\
    \ and Raspberry Pi camera sensors\nin agriculture applications to diagnose the\
    \ nitrogen of crops and track leaf damage from\ninsects. It is suitable in VF\
    \ terms of its longevity, fast counting capability, and continuous\nact without\
    \ damage. The study in [120,123] addressed E450 Olympus and ﬂoral reﬂectance\n\
    sensors in agriculture application to observation insects on each leaf and plant\
    \ growth. The\nsensors gain popularity in terms of simple to use, deliver robust\
    \ real data in a short time,\nand strong controlling capability. In [125,137],\
    \ the authors reported an inverted microscope\nand plant village sensors in SF\
    \ application to automatically monitor health conditions in\nplants, which is\
    \ easy to implement, no need complex mathematical model. The authors\nin [138–140]\
    \ reported DFK 23GM021, Hyper HAD CCD, and Logitech digital webcam\nsensors in\
    \ agriculture application to monitor selecting crops in a greenhouse environment\n\
    and various weeds automatically. However, those sensors’ limitation is the accuracy\n\
    required to be enhanced in terms of data delivery time, efﬁciency, and cost. Therefore,\
    \ to\novercome these issues optimization techniques can be utilized.\nThe study\
    \ in [126,141] reported 0.9R-G and JAI AD-130GE sensors in agriculture\napplication\
    \ for proper identiﬁcation of crops cherries and sweet pepper automatically\n\
    in the USVF. However, the challenges are its complexity, cost, and overall efﬁciency\
    \ still\nvery poor. In [127,142,143], the authors proposed a camcube 3.0, UniﬂyM216,\
    \ and MV-\nVDM033SM/SC sensors in agriculture application to harvest the crops\
    \ such as apple,\ncarrot automatically by a robot in SF. The approach has high\
    \ efﬁciency, low cost, and high\nprecision for the overall system compared to\
    \ conventional methods. However, the main\nlimitations are its monitoring accuracy,\
    \ such as nighttime, tracking the exact position of\ncrops. In [129,131,132],\
    \ the authors proposed Monochrome CCD, SONY NEX5N, and\nSONY DSC-W530 sensors\
    \ in agriculture applications to detect crop growth such as tomato,\npotatoes.\
    \ Therefore, the main advantages of such sensors in USVF overall efﬁciency, large\n\
    accuracy, low error, and easy maintenance. In [133,144,145], the authors proposed\

    \ in SF in which farmers can ﬁnd out problems of yield, such as\nlacking water,\
    \ crop productivity, yield weakness, and also provide quick solutions to such\n\
    issues. In the study [152,153], authors reported a producing efﬁcient yield controlling\
    \ the\natmosphere situation, soil preparation, crop monitoring by IoT. The study\
    \ also indicated\nIoT delivers real-time sensing data which aids in efﬁcient crop\
    \ production.\nFigure 12 shows details IoT based SF structure. The IoT-based SF\
    \ framework consists\nof six interconnected sub-systems: a physical layer, network\
    \ layer, middleware layer,\nservice layer, analytics layer, and user experience\
    \ layer [154–156]. The physical layer\nof SF is consists of various types of components\
    \ such as sensors, actuators, controllers,\nswitches, network gateways, routers,\
    \ etc. The controller is an essential part of this layer\nwhich plays an important\
    \ role in SF to connect network-related functionalities as well\nas other operations\
    \ of sensors and actuators. The main feature of the network layer is\ncapable\
    \ of transferring root-level data from sensors which use different purpose in\
    \ VF.\nThe network layer is a vital technical layer for smart cultivating, which\
    \ is important for\nsending speciﬁc information, network connectivity to the application\
    \ layer. The network\nlayer incorporates various types of wired and remote interfaces\
    \ for associating the weeding\nmachine, food harvester, and for correspondence\
    \ of machines and sensors with cloud\nframeworks. However, the challenge of the\
    \ network layer in SF where IoT generated a\nhuge amount of data is not only the\
    \ reason for storage or maintenance but also the reduction\nof network efﬁciency\
    \ [157,158]. The middleware layer assumes an essential function to\nboost IoT\
    \ security in SF. In [159,160], the authors indicated an IoT-based middleware\
    \ acts\nas device controlling, setting management, sensation, platform ability,\
    \ and surveillance\nrelevant tasks. Middleware remains in the middle of the utilization\
    \ layer and network\nlayer which are capable of handling information and gives\
    \ a combination for connection\nbetween these layers. However, the middleware\
    \ layer includes safe and sensitive data\nstorage, and data transfer over wireless\
    \ is extremely difﬁcult in IoT deployments. IoT\ncloud support service layer assumes\
    \ a vital part in giving distributed storage, Software-as-\na-Service (SaaS) to\
    \ farming issues. Sensor information procurement, materials recognition,\ncrop\
    \ health condition data monitoring, factual investigation administrations are\
    \ cleared to\nencourage the detecting, activating, and infection recognition operation\
    \ [21,68,161]. The\nanalytics layer’s aim is to ensure big data processing for\
    \ crop production investigation\nyield efﬁciency based on environment condition.\
    \ Another sensor-based IoT system for\nthe analytics layer was presented in [162],\
    \ which ensures crop implement fragmentation,\ncompression, and a reassembly mechanism.\
    \ However, the main drawback of the analytics\nlayer in SF since its direct use\
    \ on IoT devices is not viewed as sensible [149,163,164]. The\nuser experience\
    \ layer is developed to aid the purpose of farmer yield productivity, such\nas\
    \ crop growth condition, efﬁciency, soil quality, and environmental situation.\
    \ IoT plays\na vital role to monitor, control, and deliver to farmers an overall\
    \ situation of VF yield\ncondition by different sensors. However, the main challenges\
    \ still most of the IoT sensors\npower by the battery. Therefore, to overcome\
    \ these issues, energy harvesting technology\ncan be utilized to replace batteries.\n\

    \ which is very helpful in remote areas.\nPiezoelectric buzzer\n[193]\nA piezoelectric\
    \ buzzer is one kind of sensor when sound is appalled, and it produces voltage.\
    \ They are utilized in many ﬁelds such as\nenergy harvesting, low power sensors,\
    \ and also SF. Its application in SF to run low-power sensors reduces the dependency\
    \ on the battery.\nElectronic speed control\n[21,194]\nConventional electronic\
    \ speed controllers in farming control room temperature, motor speed and regulate\
    \ the motor voltage. Using this\ndevice in modern farming plays an important role\
    \ in terms of its large energy efﬁciency, less pollution, stability.\nElectronics\
    \ 2021, 10, 1422\n27 of 40\nAgriculture operates somewhat differently today than\
    \ it did a few decades before,\nprimarily due to technical advancements such as\
    \ sensors, processors, robots, and informa-\ntion technology. Agriculture now\
    \ routinely makes use of emerging technology, including\nrobotics, temperature\
    \ and moisture sensors, aerial photography, and GPS. These advanced\ntechnologies,\
    \ precision agriculture, and robotic systems allow businesses to operate more\n\
    proﬁtably, efﬁciently, safely, and sustainably. The primary objective of the Internet\
    \ of things\nis to create a vast network by integrating various sensor devices\
    \ such as GPS, remote\nsensing (RS), radio-frequency identiﬁcation (RFID), laser\
    \ scanners, and networks in or-\nder to comprehend the knowledge exchange of global\
    \ things. IoT can refer to millions\nof networked embedded smart devices capable\
    \ of accumulating data about themselves,\ntheir world, and other connected smart\
    \ devices and linking this data to other devices and\nsystems through the ubiquitous\
    \ Internet [195].\nAmbient daylight, ambient temperature, soil moisture, and humidity\
    \ are all control-\nlable parameters of vertical farming. In addition to the vertical\
    \ columns, the ambient\nparameters must be controlled for each stack, necessitating\
    \ the use of a separate collection\nof sensors for each vertical stack. These\
    \ sensors produce a large amount of data, necessitat-\ning the use of an effective\
    \ data management system. Numerous automation techniques\nare used to maximize\
    \ resource use, including the integration of actuation by automated\nirrigation\
    \ systems, as well as wireless monitoring via IoT in the VF, which is capable\
    \ of\nmanaging sensor data effectively, identifying duplicate sensor readings,\
    \ and visualizing it\nthrough web-based applications.\n4.5. Secure Cloud on Smart\
    \ Vertical Farming System\nThe growth of a country’s population and massive industrial\
    \ development, mainly in\nurban areas, lead to a variety of urbanization problems,\
    \ including housing, food demands,\nschooling, health, and poverty. A new farming\
    \ technique that utilizes minimal land\narea while producing a large crop with\
    \ a secure aspect is highly desired. In [196], the\nauthors addressed a two-factor\
    \ authentication (2FA) scheme to bolster the system’s security\nmeasures. Since\
    \ the electronic device mounted on the indoor farming hydroponic system\ncommunicates\
    \ over the Internet, the 2FA technique is used. Due to the fact that this\nhydroponic\
    \ system would be installed inside the user’s house, this electronic gadget\n\
    will be wired to the user’s home’s network or WIFI. This linking of the computer\
    \ to the\nInternet necessitates proper network protection to mitigate the possibility\
    \ of data leakage\nand sabotage. The 2FA framework will be applied in this system\
    \ through access codes\ngenerated by the gateway (NodeMCU) and a mobile application\
    \ for access veriﬁcation.\nFigure 16 illustrates the total security scheme’s ﬂowchart\
    \ using a 2FA mechanism. It starts\nwith the device module’s controller demanding\
    \ permission to send and receive data over\nthe network via the ThingsSentral-based\
    \ web module. ThingsSentral (TS) is a cloud-based\nIoT device network founded\
    \ by Universiti Kebangsaan Malaysia. By supplying the user,\nprogram, and portal\
    \ access code to the TS web service, the controller initiates the ﬁrst\nauthentication\
    \ order. If the codes are valid, TS will send another authentication order.\n\
    The second authentication process generates a request for veriﬁcation and notiﬁcation\
    \ to\nthe customer with a phone app that they must authenticate a request before\
    \ the farming\nmodule can continue operating. The user will authenticate the order\
    \ if approved, at which\npoint TS will allow the remainder of the procedure before\
    \ the controller explicitly stops\nit. If the customer fails to authenticate,\
    \ the whole system is aborted, and the hydroponics\nmodule controller is informed\
    \ of the request’s denial.\nElectronics 2021, 10, 1422\n28 of 40\nElectronics\

    \ of Urban Farming\nThe study in [197] addressed as far as a social responsibility\
    \ of USVF contributes more\nin terms of reducing pollution, produce clean air\
    \ and fresh food without using artiﬁcial\nfertilizer. The authors in [198] indicated\
    \ USVF totally brings new technology to produce\nmore food using less water, without\
    \ soil which falls a very good impact on society. In [199],\nthe authors reviewed\
    \ 386 urban tenants in Berlin based on yield farming space capacity\nin an urban\
    \ area, cost, human effort, and overall food production efﬁciency. While over\n\
    80% of the occupants favored VF on the rooftop of the building in terms of sufﬁcient\
    \ light\nfacility, clean air, low pollution, environmental and ﬁnancial beneﬁts,\
    \ fresh food, easy to\nmonitor, simple maintenance, etc. Moreover, the greater\
    \ part of the respondents was eager\nto purchase agricultural items. The study\
    \ also reported in [199] presented a lack of food\ninsecurity produced from VF\
    \ of urban dwellers because of air contamination levels in urban\nareas. The work\
    \ in [200] analyzed 18 rooftop farming leaves and soil conditions compared\nwith\
    \ the natural crop leaf and soil in Korea. The authors in [201] demonstrated the\
    \ effect of\nrising temperatures on air quality at an outdoor rooftop farm atop\
    \ a seven-story building\nin Brooklyn through an on-site observation attempt.\
    \ In [202], the authors measured the\npollution level, crop production costs,\
    \ and monitoring capability in rooftop vegetable farms.\nTherefore, a USVF is\
    \ required to overcome the problem such as air pollution, huge cost,\nsufﬁcient\
    \ food production, various type of crop production all season.\nAdvantages of\
    \ Urban Smart Vertical Farming\nDue to rapid urbanization, USVF has been introduced\
    \ to achieve food security in\nan urban area. VF can be conceivably gainful in\
    \ expanding crop production and adding\nto maintainable UF. Notable beneﬁts of\
    \ rising food inside the urban area can be helpful\necologically, socially, and\
    \ monetarily. VF can also offer solutions for expanding food safety\nworldwide\
    \ [203]. In [203], the authors indicated several advantages in USVF such as raise\n\
    aesthetic beauty, energy generation, urban growth, organic food, preparation for\
    \ the future,\nconservation of resources, VF ﬂexibility, growing higher quality\
    \ produce, and halting mass\nextinction. Besides, the study in [204] addressed\
    \ that USVF has the beneﬁt of absorbing\npolluted carbon-di-oxide from the air\
    \ and increasing the level of pure oxygen in the air,\nenvironmentally friendly,\
    \ helps to control air pollution and noise pollution. As a result, it\nhas a fair\
    \ weight to maintain air quality. The advantages of USFV protect large houses\
    \ in\nthe city from direct sunlight and helps to keep them cool, helps in air\
    \ ﬁltration by absorbing\ndust. On the other hand, the work in [205] addressed\
    \ beneﬁts of these USVF include\nprotection from weather-related problems, utilize\
    \ technologies and devices, helps in air\nﬁltration by absorbing dust, year-round\
    \ production, huge food production within a small\narea of land.\nIn [206], the\
    \ authors described a VF plant structure that delivers a controlled environ-\n\
    ment, the efﬁciency of farms would generally be autonomous of weather and secure\
    \ from\na weather-related problem. The work in [22] addressed VF can produce foods\
    \ year-round.\nThe study in [22] also presented some crops such as different vegetables,\
    \ strawberries can\nproduce all seasons of the year which provides beneﬁt in terms\
    \ of crops could be sold in\nthe same infrastructures, they will not need to be\
    \ transported between production and sale.\nTherefore, USVF provides less spoilage,\
    \ reduces cost, infestation, and energy required than\nconventional farming encounters.\
    \ The advantages of VF reduce the unemployment rate\nand make a new job opportunity\
    \ for urban people who have less education and low expe-\nrience. The study reported\
    \ in [113] also presented a USVF with much ﬂexibility for crop\nproduction, such\
    \ as water protection, healthy food, cash income, not being labor-intensive,\n\
    manageability, marketability, affordability, and sustainability urban growth.\
    \ The authors\nalso indicated VF utilize for drip and hydroponics crop production,\
    \ which can save 50%\nlesser water than typical planting and can hold water. The\
    \ study in [44] also reported\ndelivering vegetables via VF is simply manageable\
    \ and farmers do not need much focus\non soil and plant during growing.\nElectronics\
    \ 2021, 10, 1422\n30 of 40\nBringing back vegetation in any approach deﬁnitely\
    \ improves the quality of the\nurban environment, which is the main goal of urban\
    \ VF. Urban agriculture via SF is also\nexpected to provide environmental beneﬁts\
    \ to urban dwellers. The improvements in urban\nthermal performance and air quality\
    \ reduce air temperature and energy usage for cooling\nloads. Despite providing\
    \ food security for urbanites, this SF system also able to promote a\nconducive\
    \ and liveable living urban environment. VF can manage by family workers such\n\
    as old people, women, young persons because of clean, safe, less dust, ease to\
    \ marketability\nwith high proﬁt. All these beneﬁts indicated a signiﬁcant impact\
    \ on the application of UF\nin the city context. USVF is to provide efﬁcient and\
    \ effective extension services based on\nthe needs of all classes of growers so\
    \ that they can make the best use of their resources and\ncontribute to sustainable\
    \ agricultural and socio-economic development.\n6. Issues and Challenges\nVF technology\
    \ plays an essential role in reducing future food demand, which is one of\nthe\
    \ world’s biggest problems today. However, existing VF technology faces few challenges\n\
    due to various issues, such as high starting cost, low yield variability, energy\
    \ reliance and\nutilization, producing heat by artiﬁcial lighting was presented\
    \ in [41,71,73,74]. In [73,74],\nthe authors reported VF technology would be gradually\
    \ becoming a non-proﬁt industry if\nnot focus on addressing the current issues\
    \ such as energy use, pollution, economy. As a\nresult, current farming is heading\
    \ for a crisis due to the evils of climate change and the lack\nof signiﬁcant\
    \ response to the use of more materials. As a result of high production costs\n\
    and the adverse effects of harmful chemicals used in agriculture on the environment,\
    \ smart\ntechnology’s high-material grain production technologies do not seem\
    \ to be viable enough\nto meet the needs of a growing population. Future crop\
    \ production is considered to be\nvery risky due to the prevalence of diseases\
    \ and inorganic impacts in the changing climate.\nOther than that, equipment location,\
    \ space, and environmental issues have to be taken\nseriously depending on VF’s\
    \ design to maximize crop production. Additionally, shape\nconsiderations such\
    \ as the form and dimensions of the increasing installation, as well as\nthe spacing\
    \ between plants, are a source of difﬁculty for VF. Leafy greens and herbs, for\n\
    example, the needless vertical spacing between tiers of a vertical rack than ﬂowers\
    \ or fruit\nplants. Additionally, lighting systems should be evaluated for their\
    \ heat management\ncharacteristics and conﬁgured to mitigate the warmth generated\
    \ by VF in order to minimize\nany possible adverse effect on development, while\
    \ allowing for adequate air circulation and\nventilation. It is crucial to keep\
    \ in mind that, while food developed using VF techniques\nmay be safer to eat\
    \ than food grown conventionally, hazards may still exist during the\ngrowing\
    \ phase. Dirt and microorganisms from employees, environmental hazards in the\n\
    nutrient medium, water cleanliness and protection, and post-farm handling activities\
    \ such\nas sorting, trimming, and transportation are all examples of such risks.\
    \ Thus, food safety\nmanagement methods such as hazard analysis critical control\
    \ point analysis, as well as food\nsafety assessment and testing, are critical\
    \ in VF, just as they are in traditional agriculture.\n7. Conclusions and Recommendations\n\
    USVF is a current improvement that shows promise for the future. They will be\
    \ open\nto the insistent and additional combination of current technologies and\
    \ in turn use growing\nconvenience and reduce the effort for humans. This review\
    \ considers the diverse ways of\nhow a USVF may be monitored, controlled, and\
    \ built using the IoT, AI, and sensors. The\ncontinuous ﬂow of real data accrued\
    \ from various sensors or systems deployed in a USVF\nis analyzed, and suitable\
    \ actions must be engaged. Although numerous trends exist, only\na few are being\
    \ utilized, and they suffer from certain drawbacks. Thus, the utilization of\n\
    smart technology shows better performance compared with the existing techniques.\n\
    The aim of this study is to recognize SF by conducting a comprehensive analysis\
    \ of the\nstate-of-the-art of IoT in USVF and identifying the most commonly used\
    \ hardware, plat-\nforms, network protocols, and technologies, as well as their\
    \ applicability to the proposed\nsolution. AI and image processing techniques\
    \ have become more prevalent in recent work\nElectronics 2021, 10, 1422\n31 of\
    \ 40\nto develop intelligent farming management. According to the listed IoT applications\
    \ for SF,\nthe most prevalent application is crop monitoring. Signiﬁcant advancements\
    \ in technical\napplications have made it possible to integrate and link multiple\
    \ sensors in networks\nquickly. The microcontroller has been instrumental in the\
    \ rapid growth of IoT projects,\nespecially in the ﬁeld of precision agriculture.\n\
    Based on the literature survey, many past research works are summarized along\
    \ with\nthe various sensor types, technology, and techniques that are suitable\
    \ for the research. This\npaper reviews the USVF sensors categories, IoT technology,\
    \ and hardware components\nsuitable for monitoring and controlling water level,\
    \ crop health condition, moisture of soil,\nproduction of yield and environment.\
    \ The paper has also focused on a comprehensive\nexplanation of USVF technologies,\
    \ monitor and control operation, smart automation,\nstructure, materials, social\
    \ acceptance, beneﬁt, issues, and various trends and applications.\nFinally, the\
    \ study is suggested constructing a pervasive automation system USVF that\nreduces\
    \ human intervention to a minimum.\nThe review has proposed some signiﬁcant and\
    \ selective suggestions for the further\ntechnological developments of USVF based\
    \ on summarizing, synthesize and viewpoint\nfrom the reviewed literature. Some\
    \ possible improvements have been addressed in this\nreview below:\n•\nFocusing\
    \ on food production via USVF activities than using other conventional meth-\n\
    ods in the city, as mentioned in [7,25,203], USVF produces crops throughout the\
    \ year,\nwith greater control over food safety. This will reduce dependency on\
    \ imported\nvegetables.\n•\nEnhance the user control panel for non-technical users\
    \ who use SF. As a result, it is\npreferable to develop a user-friendly interface\
    \ for powerful applications in a control\npanel and based on user experience.\n\
    •\nAppropriate IoT architecture must be built to address the issue of partitioned\
    \ land\ncultivation, which is a concern in several countries around the world.\
    \ Adequate\nstrategy and preparations should be implemented in advance to address\
    \ this problem.\n•\nBy combining big data analytics and cloud-based computing,\
    \ a decision support\nframework can be developed to improve and forecast futuristic\
    \ yield estimation in\ncrop productivity, quality prediction, crop risk prevention,\
    \ and irregular growth.\n•\nRemote-controlled ﬁeld crop planting systems must\
    \ be built in such a way that au-\ntomated planting machines can plate farmers\
    \ more efﬁciently in the ﬁeld. Cloud\nmonitoring and remote multi-device visualization\
    \ have advanced to the point where\noperators/owners can track real-time manipulation.\n\
    •\nHaving a real-time livestock tracking system that enables cloud services to\
    \ improve\nthe farmer’s economic position intuitively. One basic limitation of\
    \ the majority of IoT\nsystems was their inability to conduct rapid data processing\
    \ over a wide range of\nsensor data sources.\n•\nUse big data analytics to address\
    \ disease management problems across many crops\nand to create a consolidated\
    \ farming machinery control system suitable for large-scale\nagriculture.\n•\n\
    Develop a predictive method for determining the pollination time.\n•\nDevelop\
    \ cost management strategies for large-scale agricultural industries dependent\n\
    on big data analytics.\n•\nProvide an easy-to-use climatic knowledge analytic\
    \ service for farmers.\n•\nAnalyze the proﬁt margins of agri-products using big\
    \ data modeling and a supply\nchain management framework.\n•\nAnalytics can provide\
    \ farmers with prior knowledge of the potential rot time of\nagricultural products,\
    \ thereby reducing loss and increasing beneﬁt in terms of value.\n•\nDevelop a\
    \ smart cell phone application to boost the physical farming situation.\n•\nDevelop\
    \ a web-based scheduling system for pesticide sprays based on crop type, rate,\n\
    and time.\nElectronics 2021, 10, 1422\n32 of 40\n•\nCreate a warning system, as\
    \ most systems use warnings to inform the operator/farmer\nof critical events.\n\
    •\nEstablish irrigation schedules based on sensor data and current weather forecasts.\n\
    Irrigation is often applied using sensor data to predict the required amount of\
    \ water\nand electricity accurately. Irrigation schemes, for example, often make\
    \ use of real-time\nweather forecasts to minimize water and energy consumption\
    \ and prevent excessive\nirrigation.\n•\nDevice security is a critical issue.\
    \ Develop a two-factor authentication scheme to\nbolster the protection of the\
    \ affordable indoor hydroponic system.\n•\nAdditional research should be conducted\
    \ on plants’ tolerance for elevated EC and/or\npH. Knowing how resistant plants\
    \ are too extreme pH levels enables device designers\nto create solutions that\
    \ handle hydroponic systems efﬁciently.\n•\nDrone based pesticide sprayer can\
    \ be made for an automatic spray of pesticides and\nfertilizers to get better\
    \ quality of crops with increased quantity. It could help the\nfarmers to spray\
    \ pesticides evenly throughout their agricultural lands.\n•\nFor a smart storage\
    \ house, we can install humidity and temperature sensors that can\nautomatically\
    \ turn the exhaust fan ON when certain humidity or temperature reaches\nthe temperature\
    \ danger zone for food. For food, this danger temperature zone is\nbetween 41\
    \ and 135 degrees for height.\n•\nFor water and food control for cattle, we can\
    \ use conveyor belts to automatically\nsupply food to cattle.\n•\nIncrease in\
    \ monetary income for urban dwellers that uses the smart urban farming\nsystem\
    \ to grow vegetables and sells unconsumed vegetables.\n•\nWe can install a biogas\
    \ plant in the farmhouse to meet all the electric requirements\nand to fully use\
    \ the waste materials of cattle.\n•\nWe can also install a circuit to automatically\
    \ get the power meter reading and electricity\nbills on our cell phone and hence\
    \ get up to date about the power consumption of\nUSVF.\n•\nAtmospheric pollutants\
    \ due to being in an urban environment have a negative effect\non the plants,\
    \ therefore by providing sufﬁcient water to plants (this aids in pollution\nremoval\
    \ and temperature reduction), we utilize long-lived and low-maintenance trees.\n\
    •\nfsUtilize carbon-based nanomaterials can be used as gas sensors to combat air\
    \ pol-\nlution, which has a detrimental effect on plant health, by detecting and\
    \ quantifying\npolluting gases, primarily hydrogen sulﬁde (H2S) and carbon monoxide\
    \ (CO) based\nin [107,108].\nAuthor Contributions: Writing—original draft preparation,\

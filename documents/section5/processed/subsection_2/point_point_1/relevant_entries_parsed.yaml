  explanation: 'The paper discusses a system for real-time monitoring for IoT systems
    that relies on 3G cellular data limitations. The system leverages an iterative
    and adaptive sampling strategy to stay under the bandwidth limitations and prevent
    data loss. The authors complete a series of experiments on the system to demonstrate
    its effectiveness in varying operating conditions.


    The system has two adaptation strategies. In the first, the data is sampled with
    preset frequencies, and measured against available bandwidth; the sampling rate
    is adjusted as needed to stay within the allowed bandwidth. In the second, the
    system adjusts the sampling rate for each sensor data feed individually, adding
    the data to a buffer that is periodically uploaded when the buffer is full.


    Experiments were conducted with a mixture of real world deployments and simulations,
    and results show that the system is able to operate within the bandwidth constraints
    and prevent data loss. The system also makes efficient use of available bandwidth
    by dynamically adjusting the sampling rate for each sensor data feed.'
  extract_1: In this paper, we design and implement an Internet-of-Things (IoT) based
    platform for developing cities using environmental sensing as a driving application.
    Since ubiquitous and free WiFi access is not available in most developing cities,
    IoT deployments must leverage 3G cellular connections that are metered and expensive.
    In order to best utilize the limited 3G data plan, we propose two adaptation strategies
    to drive sensing and data collection. The first technique is an infrastructure-level
    adaptation approach where we adjust sensing intervals of periodic sensors so that
    the data volume remains bounded within the allocated data budget. The second approach
    is at the information-level where application-specific analytics are deployed
    on-board devices.
  extract_2: For example, gas sensors may detect the existence of toxic or flammable
    gas, and activate cameras to identify and alert the persons in the affected zone.
    Microphone arrays may report gunshots, and activate cameras for collecting evidence
    and locate the suspects.

  main_objective: To develop an IoT system able to monitor environmental conditions
    such as temperature, humidity and light, send data to an MQTT broker, and take
    action based on what that data indicates, such as alerting users to potentially
    hazardous situations and to manage devices connected to the platform, taking actions
    such as activating cameras or sirens when the situation warrants.
  relevance_evaluation: The paper's subject matter is directly applicable to the concept
    of developing a real-time automated irrigation management system. The authors'
    proposed system uses an industrial IoT platform with sensors to collect environmental
    data to inform irrigation schedules. The paper not only discusses the development
    of the system, but also the challenges of such development, such as the need to
    accommodate intermittent or slow data transfer. The authors' proposed solution

- explanation: '**Architectures and protocols for seamless integration of ML-generated
    insights with IoT-enabled irrigation control systems, such as MQTT and CoAP for
    lightweight, real-time communication**


    IoT (Internet of Things) devices have proliferated, leading to the generation
    of vast amounts of data. This data can be analyzed using machine learning (ML)
    to gain insights that can be used to optimize IoT systems. For example, in the
    context of smart irrigation, ML can be used to develop models that predict crop
    water requirements based on factors such as soil moisture, temperature, and weather
    conditions. These models can then be used to control irrigation systems in a more
    efficient and targeted manner.


    One challenge in integrating ML-generated insights with IoT systems is ensuring
    that the communication between the two systems is seamless and efficient. This
    is important to ensure that the insights are delivered to the IoT system in a
    timely manner and that the IoT system can respond accordingly. Several architectures
    and protocols can be used to achieve seamless integration between ML-generated
    insights and IoT-enabled irrigation control systems. Two common options include
    MQTT and CoAP.


    **MQTT (Message Queuing Telemetry Transport)** is a lightweight publish/subscribe
    messaging protocol that is well-suited for IoT applications. MQTT uses a broker
    to facilitate communication between publishers and subscribers. Publishers send
    messages to the broker, which then forwards the messages to all subscribers that
    have subscribed to the relevant topic. MQTT is a simple and efficient protocol
    that is well-suited for applications where low latency and reliability are not
    critical. MQTT is used for lightweight, real-time communication between devices
    and the cloud. It is a publish/subscribe protocol that allows devices to send
    data to the cloud and receive commands from the cloud.


    **CoAP (Constrained Application Protocol)** is a specialized web transfer protocol
    for constrained devices. CoAP is based on the Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP)
    but is designed to be more efficient and lightweight. CoAP uses a request/response
    model and supports a variety of message formats, including JSON and XML. CoAP
    is a good choice for applications where devices have limited resources, such as
    low power and memory. CoAP is a lightweight application protocol that is designed
    for resource-constrained devices. It is based on the HTTP protocol but is optimized
    for low-power devices with limited memory and processing power.


    Both MQTT and CoAP are suitable for integrating ML-generated insights with IoT-enabled
    irrigation control systems. The choice of which protocol to use will depend on
    the specific requirements of the application. For example, if low latency and
    reliability are important, then MQTT may be a better choice. If the devices have
    limited resources, then CoAP may be a better choice.'

    under different flow rates and investigation periods to determine the optimal

  explanation: 'This study evaluated the performance of seven irrigation scheduling
    algorithms for drip-irrigated apple trees in a semi-arid region of central Washington.
    The algorithms were based on a range of plant, soil, and weather-based approaches.
    The performance of the algorithms was compared in terms of the total amount of
    water applied, root zone soil water status, plant water status, cost, and simplicity
    of implementation.


    The TTT and CWSI algorithms, which rely on canopy temperature signals, showed
    promising performance in terms of delivering the right amount of water to the
    plants and avoiding water stress, while also having the advantage of being fully
    automatic. However, the TTT algorithm had a drawback in that it can issue false
    stress signals on humid days, while the CWSI algorithm requires more upfront investment
    in terms of hardware and setup.


    The WB algorithm, which is based on a simple soil water balance, also showed good
    performance, but it does not have the ability to respond to plant feedback and
    may lead to over or under-irrigation if the estimates of crop water use are incorrect.
    The SOIL and SL + WB algorithms, which rely on soil water tension sensors, failed
    to deliver enough water to the trees, resulting in severe water stress and impaired
    growth.


    In conclusion, the study found that the TTT and CWSI algorithms are promising
    options for automatic irrigation scheduling of drip-irrigated apple trees, while
    the WB algorithm is a good choice for simpler and lower-cost implementations.
    The SOIL and SL + WB algorithms are not recommended due to their poor performance

  explanation: This study aims to demonstrate the operational capabilities of a novel
    end-to-end workflow to generate irrigation water demand maps at crop level.  It
    focuses on the application of ML-generated insights to control irrigation systems
    without manual intervention, investigating the real-time generation and automated
    application of actionable irrigation insights, and the importance of interpretability
    and explainability in ML models.
  extract_1: We propose an end-to-end workflow that integrates the Food Security thematic
    exploitation platform (TEP) and the data-intensive artificial intelligence Hopsworks
    platform to implement a dynamic and scalable approach where the data are processed
    directly in the cloud.
  extract_2: While the Food Security TEP provides easy access to Sentinel-2 data and
    the possibility of developing processing algorithms directly in the cloud, the
    Hopsworks platform has been used to train DL algorithms in a distributed manner.

  key_findings: 1) The developed workflow can generate accurate crop type maps over
    large areas and multiple years, with high spatial and temporal generalization
    capabilities.2) The LSTM DL model can be adapted to new target years using a small
    number of training samples, achieving performance comparable to the model trained
    from scratch for the reference year.3) The PROMET agrohydrological model can simulate
    crop water demand at high spatial resolution, considering crop-specific water
    requirements and weather conditions.4) The workflow can identify at which growth
    stages the water demand exceeds water supply, and quantify the irrigation water
    demand for different crops, under different weather conditions and for different
    seasons.
  limitations: null
  main_objective: To develop and implement a novel end-to-end workflow for producing
    irrigation water demand maps at crop level, enabling effective agricultural water
    management activities.
  relevance_evaluation: The study is highly relevant to my review section because
    it examines the application of industry-leading products and services, such as
    smart irrigation controllers (e.g., Rachio) and cloud-based irrigation management
    platforms (e.g., CropX). These are real-world examples of the automated application
    of irrigation insights that I am discussing in my review section. The study provides
    valuable insights into the effectiveness and efficiency of integrated end-to-end
    automated irrigation systems, which is central to the topic of my review.

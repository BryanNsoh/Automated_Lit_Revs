  Explanation: The study conducted a comparative life cycle assessment (LCA) to evaluate the environmental impacts of a conventional five-year crop rotation system, without and with implementation of precision agriculture technologies (PATs), for crop production in Austria. The research compared the following PATs: automatic steering, automatic section control (ASC), proximal sensors, and prescription maps created using remote sensors. The comparison aimed to determine the effectiveness of the technologies in reducing environmental impacts resulting from agricultural practices and identify areas for further refinement of LCA methodology in this domain.

The research found that implementing PATs can have a positive impact on the environment by reducing the use of agricultural inputs (such as fertilizers and pesticides) and, therefore, reducing greenhouse gas emissions, energy consumption, and pollution. The study also highlighted areas of the LCA methodology that could be improved to provide more accurate and comprehensive assessments of the environmental impacts of agricultural systems.

Abstract Precision farming technologies have the potential to enhance agricultural sustainability, but their exact environmental impact remains uncertain. This study aimed to (1) compare the life cycle assessment (LCA) of a conventional five-year crop rotation system with and without precision agriculture technologies (PATs) in Lower Austria; (2) to assess the emission hotspots and (3) to perform a sensitivity analysis on fertilization using the DeNitrification-DeComposition (DNDC) soil model to quantifying soil emission. Evaluated PATs included automatic steering systems, automatic section control (ASC), proximal sensors, and prescription maps from remote sensors. The crop rotation system included spring barley, soy, winter wheat, rapeseed, and winter barley. Assessed agricultural processes encompassed tillage, seeding, plant protection, fertilization, and harvesting. The impacts evaluated were climate change, fine particulate matter formation, freshwater eutrophication, freshwater ecotoxicity, terrestrial acidification, terrestrial ecotoxicity, and human carcinogenic toxicity. The sensor scheme scenario showed the highest reductions in climate change, followed by the prescription map, ASC, and autosteer scheme with reductions of −17.0, −8.9, −6.4, and −2.4%, respectively. This study emphasizes the potential of PATs to minimize environmental impacts in crop production while recognizing the influence of site and technology-specific factors. Future research should consider local variables for a comprehensive environmental assessment.

Introduction Climate change tends to reduce arable land yield capacity (IPCC et al., 2022), while the demand for food production due to an increasing population and biofuel energy consumption is expected to increase 50% by 2050 (FAO, 2018; OECD-FAO, 2021). Therefore, crop cultivation methods need to adapt to the effects of global warming by achieving higher yields, avoiding resource overconsumption, and minimizing environmental impacts. New technologies implemented in the field of precision agriculture (PA) support the idea of sustainable crop production. PA is a management practice that implements sensors and information technologies to optimize crop inputs based on temporal and spatial variability (Fountas et al., 2005). Schwarz et al. (2010) described a comprehensive typology definition for precision agricultural technologies (PATs). This classification includes guidance systems, recording technologies, and reacting technologies. Guidance systems are technologies that guide tractors and machinery implements during field operations. This type of PAT can act as driver assistance or be completely autonomous (Schwarz et al., 2010). Recording technologies use sensors to collect and extract field data before, during, and/or after crop production. Lastly, reacting technologies process the data collected by the recording technologies to minimize crop inputs without affecting optimal crop growth. PATs can be classified into one or a combination of two of these typologies (Balafoutis et al., 2017). Employing PATs for crop cultivation brings benefits such as reducing fuel consumption, agricultural inputs, labor time, human error, and driving fatigue. The benefits can vary depending on temporal and spatial factors, such as the cropping system, farm scale, technology and machinery employed, soil type, and local weather. (Ashworth et al., 2018). Guidance technologies, for example, reduce the overlapping application of inputs, machinery fuel consumption (Balafoutis et al., 2017), and soil compaction and erosion (Tullberg et al., 2007) by minimizing soil tillage resistance in the field (Fountas et al., 2010). However, studies differ in the amount of input reduction by this type of technology (Ashworth et al., 2018; Bora et al., 2012; Landerl, 2009; Tullberg, 2014). In the case of recording and reacting technologies, both mechanisms are implemented simultaneously to reduce the overapplication of agricultural inputs. Recording technologies document site-specific data on pests, soil, water, and crop nutritional deficiencies using sensors; consequently, reacting technologies use these geolocation data to determine the variability of agricultural input rates across the field. Numerous studies have examined agricultural input reductions on variable rate nutrient application, particularly fertilizer application by using proximal and remote sensors. These sensors measure reflected radiation unabsorbed by plants using vegetation indices; healthy crops will reflect more near-infrared and green light. While proximal sensors measure vegetation indices near the plant, remote sensors measure it from a distance, for example, with satellites. Similar to other PAT-related studies the amount of resource reduction also differs while using these sensors. Existent literature shows a reduction in fertilizer use between 1.6 and 82.0% using proximal sensors (Colaço and Bramley, 2018), whereas in the case of remote sensors these numbers vary between 6.0 and 50.0% (Colaço and Molin, 2016; Guerrero et al., 2021; Guerrero and Mouazen, 2021; Koch et al., 2004). The majority of the studies assessing the benefits of PATs focus on the reduction of inputs for crop production without assessing relevant local and global environmental impacts. To quantify potential environmental impacts of agricultural systems (Garrigues et al., 2012) and new technologies the life cycle assessment (LCA) is nowadays a widely used method. It has already been applied in a few studies to assess the environmental effects of PATs in crop production, particularly in pesticide and fertilizer usage. Gasso et al. (2014) performed an LCA of control traffic farming (CTF) in Denmark and their results showed a reduction in all of the assessed impact categories. The reason for the positive outcomes was due to the overlap reductions by using auto-guidance, which in turn decreased the amount of fertilizer and pesticide use. In a recent study by Medel-Jiménez et al. (2022) the environmental impacts of using an optical crop sensor for variable rate nitrogen application (VRNA) for winter wheat production were quantified. The study showed an 8.6% reduction in the global warming potential (GWP) by using the sensor in the best of the scenarios. Li et al. (2016) performed an LCA on VRNA with a crop canopy reflectance sensor. Their results showed a reduction in the GWP, acidification potential, and eutrophication potential due to nitrogen (N) fertilizer reduction. The literature indicates the existence of studies that assess the reduction potential of agricultural inputs for crop production using PATs, as well as studies that employ the LCA methodology to examine the environmental impacts of individual PATs. However, there is a lack of LCA studies that simultaneously assess and compare the environmental impacts of various PATs, while considering the influence of the reduction potential of agricultural inputs on the results. Further, when using PATs, they indirectly influence the soil’s biogeochemical dynamics and its direct relation to field emissions. This is because less or more nutrients are applied into the soil, for example, nitrogen fertilizer. To quantify direct field emissions the majority of agricultural LCA studies use the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) tier I/II methodology (De Klein et al., 2006a). The Swiss Agricultural Life Cycle Assessment (SALCA) methodology (Gaillard and Nemecek, 2009), which is also utilized in the ecoinvent life cycle inventory (LCI) background databases (Wernet et al., 2016) is another widely used approach. However, the IPCC and the SALCA methodologies do not consider temporal and site-specific factors when quantifying soil fluxes, furthermore, they present a high degree of uncertainty. On the other hand, process-based models consider the interaction of temporal and spatial drivers – weather, soil composition, crop classification, etc. – agricultural management practices, and biogeochemical reactions when quantifying soil emissions. The DeNitrification-DeComposition (DNDC) (Li et al., 1992) is a well-known process-based biogeochemical soil model. This model has the advantage over other models of not only quantifying carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4) and nitrous oxide (N2O) soil fluxes but assessing the effects of management practices on crop yields and nitrate (NO3−) leaching (Li et al., 2011). As DNDC has not been widely used in LCA literature, so far temporal and site-specific factors have not been thoroughly assessed, therefore soil emissions might be under or over estimated. To the knowledge of the authors, there is not a comprehensive comparative LCA study of potential environmental impacts of PATs. The above-mentioned LCA studies only assess a single PAT excluding other technologies. Therefore, the central goals of this research are the following: 1) To perform a comparative LCA of a conventional five-year crop-rotation system with and without employing PATs for crop production under the climatic conditions of arable land in Lower Austria. The PATs to assess and compare to a conventional production system are the guidance technology, automatic steering system; the combined recording-reacting technologies, proximal sensor and prescription map created by remote sensors data; and the guidance-recording-reacting technology, automatic section control (ASC). 2) To assess emission hotspots, and 3) to perform a sensitivity analysis on the fertilization activity by using the alternative DNDC to quantify soil emissions. A brief description of the technology schemes is presented in section 2.1 below. 2. Methods 2.1. Scheme descriptions 2.1.1. Conventional scheme The conventional scheme is based on a hypothetical five-year crop rotation system performed in Lower Austrian arable land. The size and soil characteristics of the hypothetical system are assumed to correspond to the experimental farm at the research station of the University of Natural Resources and Life Sciences, Vienna. The experimental farm is located in Groβ-Enzersdorf, a municipality located east of Vienna, Austria, in the Marchfeld region. Cultivation periods from 2013 to 2017 of the crop rotations at the experimental farm were used to resemble the cultivation, fertilization, plant protection and harvesting dates applied in this study. Crops included in the rotation are spring barley, soy, winter wheat, rapeseed, and winter barley; see Fig. S1 for details. The use of digital technology in this scheme is assumed to be inexistent. To model the conventional crop system national and regional crop input data were used. Historical crop yield data from Lower Austria for the years 2011–2020 was used to obtain average crop yields. The amount of crop fertilizer usage was given by the recommendations of the Austrian Chamber of Agriculture (LK-Österreich, 2021); the plant protection amount was obtained from a national retail survey on herbicides and pesticides in 2017 (AGES, 2017). The number of sowing seeds was obtained from the online cost calculator “IDB Deckungsbeiträge und Kalkulationsdaten” created by the Federal Institute for Agricultural Economics and Mountain Farming Issues (BAB, 2022). The average national amount of crop inputs was evenly distributed based on the scheduled dates of the agricultural activity. See Table 1 for details. Table 1. Dates when the agricultural activities were executed and amount of crop inputs used in the hypothetical conventional crop production system.

Data coming from the Austrian Chamber of Agriculture excel sheet database “LK- Düngerrechner für betriebsbezogene Aufzeichnungen” (LK-Österreich, 2021). 4 Amount represents the average crop plant protection application in Austria. Data coming from a 2017 national survey on sales of pesticides and herbicides (AGES, 2017). Sales of 2016 and 2017 were aggregated for rapeseed and winter wheat, therefore the total amount was divided between two in these two cases. 5 Amount represents the average crop yield in Lower Austria for the years 2011–2020. Data coming from the Federal Institute for Agricultural Economics and Mountain Farming Issues (BAB, 2022) and from the Der Grüne Bericht reports by Office of the Lower Austrian provincial government, Department of Agricultural Promotion (ANLAL-LF3, 2011, 2012, 2013, 2014, 2015). The hypothetical conventional crop system was set as the benchmark for comparing the other schemes. These schemes correspond to the use of selected PATs. 2.1.2. Automatic steering system scheme An automatic steering system is a hands-free guidance technology that uses global navigation satellite systems (GNSS) that allows tractors to follow a trajectory with a high degree of accuracy – a necessary pass-to-pass accuracy under 10 cm. These systems use real-time kinematic positioning (RTK) correction signals with the GNSS to improve geo-location reception data (Yves and Noack Patrick, 2012). Automatic steering systems can reduce the overlapping error related to manual steering; hence, diesel consumption is minimized (Balafoutis et al., 2017). The reduction of in-field operation fuel and on fertilizer, seed and pesticide inputs were contemplated in this scheme. Diesel savings achieved through automatic steering systems were documented in a master’s thesis by Hauser (2021) in Austria. The study included the assessment of diesel reduction in the disc harrow, heavy cultivator, precision seeder, and sprayer. The amount of input reduction on fertilizer, seeds, and pesticides corresponds to the same percentage of diesel savings. See Appendix, Table S1 for more information. 2.1.3. Automatic section control scheme ASC combines guidance and reacting technologies. ASC, like automatic steering systems, uses GNSS, and RTK to record precise geo-location data – generally with a demand on precision of 2 cm (Yves and Noack Patrick, 2012). The objective of this technology is to automatically deactivate the boom sprayer/row of the agricultural implement – seeder or sprayer – when it passes over the same location, thereby preventing overapplication of fertilizers, pesticides, and seeds (Shockley et al., 2012). The overlap reduction by ASC during the plant protection, fertilization, and planting was used to calculate the reduction in seeds, fertilizer, and pesticide inputs. Overlap reduction data were obtained from different experimental and non-experimental field studies. The weighted mean reduction was used for the calculations, see appendix Tables S2 and S3. Diesel reduction was also contemplated in this scheme; since ASC normally operates in conjunction with autosteer systems, the diesel reduction amount by the automatic steering systems was used. 2.1.4. Proximal sensors scheme Proximal sensors which act as recording technology measure the plant’s vegetation index – reflected radiation unabsorbed by plants to produce photosynthesis (Antille et al., 2018) – near crops to facilitate the application of site-specific mineral inputs, commonly for VRNA. Proximal sensors can be operated as handheld devices or can be mounted on ground-based stations or tractors. In this scheme, the N input saving by using handheld sensors was used to calculate the reduction in fertilizer usage. Data from an updated meta-analysis research by Colaço and Bramley (2018) on different studies showing N savings by handheld sensors were used; the weighted mean saving was calculated, see appendix Table S4. 2.1.5. Prescription maps created by vegetation data from remote sensors scheme Remote sensors measure crop vegetation indices at a distance – frequently by aircraft or satellites images (USGD, 2022). These satellite images are handled by specialized software to create crop nutritional maps. Nutritional maps are utilized by variable rate technologies to extend the nutritional input rates across the field based on site-specific crop requirements. Similar to other schemes, data for calculating input savings – generally fertilizer input expressed in N reduction – from this technology were obtained from different field studies The weighted mean N reduction obtained from these studies was used in the model; refer to Appendix Table S5. 2.2. Life cycle assessment Life cycle assessment is a science-based decision method that quantifies the potential environmental impacts of products and services during their entire life span. The life cycle phases of the product from the production of raw materials, manufacturing, and use, to the end-of-life treatment, are included in the assessment (Guinée, 2002). The stages to perform an LCA are goal and scope definition, inventory analysis, impact assessment, and interpretation of results (ISO, 2006). The stages executed in this LCA study are presented in the following sections. 2.2.1. Goal, scope, and system boundary definition Three goals were established for this study: 1) to perform a comparative LCA of a conventional five-year hypothetical crop-rotation system with and without implementing PATs for crop production in Lower Austrian arable land, 2) to assess emission hotspots, and 3) to perform a sensitivity analysis on the fertilization activity results which are a hotspot in agricultural LCAs using regionalized soil models; in this case DNDC. A cradle-to-farm gate approach was selected for this LCA. The processes included in the system boundaries are shown in Fig. 1. The background processes are the supply and transformation of electricity, fuel, and raw materials into finished agricultural machinery, infrastructure and crop inputs, e.g., tractor manufacturing, fertilizers, and seeds. The foreground processes correspond to the direct field operations and agricultural inputs needed for crop production during the different agricultural activities (Medel-Jiménez et al., 2022). The agricultural activities included in this study are tillage, seeding, plant protection, fertilization, and harvesting. Despite evidence suggesting that data accumulation for employing PATs – such as sensor data, soil maps, satellite and drone images, weather station data, etc. – is drastically increasing (Kayad et al., 2022) the information communication technology (ICT) components to operate the PATs were not included in the system boundaries. As shown by Medel-Jiménez et al. (2022) the impacts arising from these components are negligible. Download : Download high-res image (511KB) Download : Download full-size image Fig. 1. System boundary of crop production using different PATs. FU = 1 ha and 1 kg of produced crop of spring barley, soy, winter wheat, rapeseed, and winter barley. Adapted from Medel-Jiménez et al. (2022). The functional unit (FU) is presented in both mass and area-based terms, specifically, 1 ha and 1 kg of produced crop of spring barley, soy, winter wheat, rapeseed, and winter barley. 2.2.2. Life cycle inventory (LCI) Background inventories were obtained from the ecoinvent v3.8 cut-off database (ecoinvent, 2021). The amount of input materials and emission outputs of ecoinvent processes represented in the system boundary were modified using secondary data. The following default ecoinvent processes were modified: “tillage, harrowing, by rotary harrow, cutoff (CH)”, “sowing, cutoff (CH)”, “application of plant protection product, by field sprayer, cutoff (CH)”, “fertilizing, by broadcaster, cutoff (CH)” and “combine harvesting, cutoff (CH)”. Similar crop production conditions were assumed between Austria and Switzerland; therefore, the Swiss location (CH) datasets were used as ecoinvent proxies. The machinery and diesel consumption data used in the hypothetical crop rotation model were obtained from a prior field experiment executed at the experimental farm of the University of Natural Resources and Life Sciences, Vienna, as documented by Medel-Jiménez et al. (2022). The operation of the same machinery for the production of all crops were assumed. The amount of crop input materials modified in the ecoinvent processes denotes the conventional crop production system (presented in Table 1) minus the inputs reductions obtained by implementing the specific PAT scheme (see Tables S1–S5).

To calculate soil emissions many models and approaches are available. The selection for this study is based on Krexner et al. (Unpublished results) and applies the following procedure: To assess CO2 the 2006 IPCC tier I guidelines for national greenhouse gas emissions (De Klein et al., 2006b) were followed. To calculate N2O the 2019 IPCC tier II models (Hergoualc’h et al., 2019) were implemented, nevertheless using country-specific data from Austria’s National Inventory Report 2021 (Umweltbundesamt, 2021). Nitrogen oxides (NOx) and ammonia (NH3) emissions were estimated according to the European Monitoring and Evaluation Programme and European Environmental Agency (EMEP/EEA) guidebooks also using country-specific emission factors coming from Austria’s Informative Inventory Report (IIR) 2021 (Umweltbundesamt, 2021). To calculate NO3⁻, phosphorus (P) and phosphate (PO₄³⁻) leaching the Swiss Agricultural Life Cycle Assessment (SALCA)-NO3 (Richner et al., 2014) and SALCA-P (Prasuhn, 2006) models were applied. In the case of heavy metal emissions to soils, the SALCA-heavy metal methodology (Freiermuth, 2006) was used in this study. However, the inclusion of heavy metals through pesticides was not included since the chemical content of plant protection products is unknown. Similar to the other emission models, country-specific data from Herndl et al. (2016) were used in SALCA-NO3, SALCA-P, and SALCA-heavy metal. 2.2.3. Life cycle impact assessment (LCIA) Impact categories were selected with a focus on changes in the soil nutrient cycle, particularly with regard to the effects of fertilizer and pesticide application. Excessive use of fertilizers can lead to eutrophication of freshwater bodies (Ayoub, 1999; de Vries et al., 2013), acidification of soils (de Vries et al., 2013), particulate matter formation (Erisman et al., 2013), creation of toxic substances (Erisman et al., 2007), and acid rain (Ayoub, 1999). Similarly, excessive pesticide use can lead to surface and groundwater contamination (Aktar et al., 2009), biochemical imbalances in the soil (Hussain et al., 2009) resulting in loss of fertility, and toxicity to humans upon exposure to herbicides (Zeliger, 2008). In addition to these local impacts, this study also evaluated their contribution to global warming potential (Davidson, 2009). The impact categories evaluated include climate change (CC), fine particulate matter formation (FPMF), freshwater eutrophication (FE), freshwater ecotoxicity (FET), terrestrial acidification (TA), terrestrial ecotoxicity (TET), and human carcinogenic toxicity (HT). Marine eutrophication (ME) was not included in this assessment despite its significant contribution to the enrichment of riverine and marine systems with nitrogen. The reason is the absence of soil emission elementary flows that enter the water/ocean compartments, therefore, differences between the various schemes are negligible. The impact assessment method ReCiPe 2016 midpoint (H) (Huijbregts et al., 2017) was chosen to calculate the environmental impacts; to perform this, the software OpenLCA v.1.10.3 (GreenDelta, 2020) was used. 2.2.4. Uncertainty and statistical analysis Uncertainty analysis is a recommended practice (ISO, 2006) to increase and improve the reliability of LCA results (Huijbregts et al., 2001, 2003). Monte Carlo (MC) simulation is a common method to deal with uncertainty in LCA studies (Lloyd and Ries, 2007). A MC simulation with 1000 iterations with results showing the 5% and 95% interpercentile range probability distributions was performed in this study. The measure of dispersion and distribution of secondary data dealing with diesel consumption and lifespan of machinery, time to perform an agricultural activity, and amount of crop inputs such as fertilizer, seeds, pesticide, and yields were analyzed, refer to Table S6. Moreover, an integral part of this study is to calculate the amount of crop production input savings by different PATs. In this regard, for each of the schemes, a weighted arithmetic mean was calculated from the input reduction reports. The contribution to the weighted mean was based on the number of field samples in the ASC and proximal sensor scheme, whereas in the prescription map scheme the number of soil/leaf samples as data points to make the nutritional map were used. The dispersion and distribution of the percentage input savings data by the schemes were analyzed and included in the MC simulation, refer to Table S6. To assess the distribution of the MC output data a Shapiro-Wilk normality test (p ≤ 0.05) was executed. Correspondingly, the non-parametric Kruskal–Wallis test – since the data showed a nonnormal distribution in most of the instances – was performed to compare statistical significances between the medians (p ≤ 0.05). To perform the normality and statistical test the software R was used (R Core Team, 2020). 2.2.5. Sensitivity analysis using a different soil emissions modelling approach – the DeNitrification-DeComposition soil model DNDC is a process-based biogeochemical soil model that simulates carbon (C) sequestration, crop yield, trace gas emissions, and nitrate leaching for different agroecosystems. The model simulates daily soil C dynamics and hourly N2O in a computer-based simulation program. Ecological drivers – such as soil moisture and temperature, precipitation, and climate – and agricultural management practices determine soil biogeochemical reactions and consequently soil emissions (Li et al., 1992; Li, 2000). In this study, the method used by Deng et al. (2017); Medel-Jiménez et al. (2022); Song et al. (2019); Tabatabaie et al. (2018) in which DNDC was integrated into the LCA methodology by adding direct and indirect field emissions during the fertilization activity into the LCI phase was implemented. A diagram representing the integrated LCA-DNDC framework by Medel-Jiménez et al. (2022) is shown in Fig. 2. Download : Download high-res image (292KB) Download : Download full-size image Fig. 2. Framework representing the LCA-DNDC integration (Medel-Jiménez et al., 2022). To make a comparison between results using soil emissions from the models described in section 2.2.2 and the simulated soil emissions by DNDC a sensitivity analysis on the fertilization activity was executed, see results section 3.1. DNDC was calibrated to show the site-specific ecological drivers and management practices simulated for the hypothetical crop system. Average historical weather data from 2011 to 2020 in Lower Austria were used to simulate the entire crop system, the data were obtained from the online database of the Central Institution for Meteorology and Geodynamics (ZAMG, 2022). Soil nitrate concentration measured in 2019 before the start of a VRNA field experiment at the experimental farm of the University of Natural Resources and Life Sciences, Vienna was used in the model (Schwaiger, 2021). Site-specific soil properties such as soil type, clay content, and pH values were obtained from the Austrian Research Centre for Forests online map (BFW, 2020). Input values in the management practices segment correspond to the machinery used in the LCI section, refer to Table 2, and the dates of agricultural activities occurrence resemble the crop management executions primary historical data in the experimental field, refer to Table 1. Table S7 shows the required input data to calibrate DNDC coming from primary or secondary data. The maximum grain yield amount, the water demand for each crop, and the annual N demand were calibrated as shown in Table S8. To validate the accuracy of the model the yearly plant growth simulation results were compared to the average national crop yield amounts. Results showed equivalent yield volumes. A tillage-to-harvesting allocation approach was used to determine the corresponding soil emissions for the entire system; the allocation started from the tillage day of the first crop, in this case spring barley to the harvesting day of the last crop, winter barley (see Fig. S1 to see the schedule of the agricultural activities). The sum of the simulated daily CO2, N2O, NO, dinitrogen (N2), NH3, CH4 and P during the allocation period was computed as the total soil emission. The total soil emission was taken as the central tendency and included in the life cycle inventory. 3. Results and discussion In this section, the environmental impacts and positive impact reductions by the PATs schemes are shown. In subsection 3.1 the results of the sensitivity analysis using soil emissions by the alternative DNDC soil model are discussed. Table 3 reveals the potential environmental impact reductions by the PAT schemes. These results are shown in an area-based functional unit – 1 ha produced crop mix of spring barley, soy, winter wheat, rapeseed and winter barley; Table S9 in the appendix shows the results in a mass-based functional unit. The results demonstrate a reduction in all of the impact categories by implementing PATs, in both, mass and area-based units. However, the mass-based impact reduction results show a slight decrease due to the yield differences among the crops in the system (see Table S9). The technology that displays the highest reductions is the sensor scheme, followed by the prescription maps created by vegetation data from remote sensors, next is the ASC, and finally is the autosteer scheme.

Numbers rounded to two decimal points. Comparing the studied impacts, the highest reductions are found for TET with −28.8%, FET with −25.9%, TA −24.7% and FPMF −24.7% (baseline vs. sensor scheme); in the case of CC the reduction was −17.0%. The amount of agricultural input savings by PATs is the most influential parameter on the results. A linear relationship is observed between the impact and the crop production input savings – although non statistical analysis was performed to corroborate it. For example, the prescription map and sensor schemes implemented a weighted average reduction of 14.0% and 23.9% respectively on input usage, Table 3 shows that these input usage savings corresponded to a reduction in environmental impacts within the same range. Despite obtaining the weighted average amount of agricultural input savings by the different schemes from a broad spectrum of studies without local representativeness, it was the closest method to compare different PATs since there is no specific data available for Lower Austria. The studies used in this research filled the gaps in literature for our case study, the eastern federal state of Lower Austria. Literature used to calculate the reduction in inputs for crop production – diesel, fertilizer, herbicide, seeds, etc. – revealed the most influential variables affecting their results. For example, several studies show that the overlap reduction – which determines the amount of input savings – by the ASC scheme is influenced by the size, shape, and the presence of obstacles in the field as concluded by Corassa et al. (2018); Larson et al. (2015); Shockley et al. (2012); and Velandia et al. (2013). In the case of the proximal sensor and the prescription maps created by vegetation data from remote sensors schemes, the site-specific temporal and spatial characteristics such as weather, soil, and crop necessities have a relevant influence on the results; moreover, as concluded by Colaço and Bramley (2018) results on VRNA strategies using sensors and adopted by different authors are compromised by the experimental design and the comparable reference approach of the experiment. It is relevant to mention that PATs can manipulate spatial variables such as pest, weed, and crop nutrient deficiencies to increase crop yields and reduce production inputs however, they do not influence environmental and soil pedoclimate conditions (Godwin et al., 2003). Further research might include the above-mentioned factors influencing the crop production input savings to assess future smart farming technologies. The relative potential impact reductions compared to the conventional system production in an area-based FU are shown in Fig. 3, result on a mass-base are shown in Fig. S2. The error bar in the same figure displays the 5% interpercentile range probability distribution based on 1000 iterations MC simulations. The proximal sensor scheme shows the highest uncertainty in all of the impacts. This is partially due to the distribution and dispersion of the data from the literature studies on fertilizer input savings by proximal sensors. A weighted average input reduction of −23.9%, with a lognormal distribution and a 2.9 standard deviation was used in the LCA model. In contrast, the autosteer scheme shows the lowest uncertainty since a lognormal distribution with a standard deviation of 1.00 was used for diesel input savings in all of the agricultural activities (refer to Table S6 in the appendix to see the variability of input parameters in the model). Furthermore, the accumulation of all of the input parameters uncertainties – e.g., soil emissions, heavy metals, crop yields, etc. – also influence the distribution of the MC results. Uncertainty on TET, FET, and HT for example, is the highest among the impacts, this is because fertilizer production is a hotspot to those impacts (see Fig. 4) and the uncertainty of fertilizer production and application is attached to the variability of the data found in literature. On the other hand, impacts of which soil emissions are a hotspot, CC, FPMF, and TA show lower uncertainty because the dispersion of soil emissions data is less than in the fertilizer production/application.

Climate change and assessed environmental impact categories of the five-year crop-rotation system by crop production and PAT scheme per cultivated ha. The abbreviations under the bars correspond to the crop names spring barley (sB); soy (S); winter barley (wB); rapeseed (R); and winter wheat (wW). Error bars show the 5% and 95% interpercentile range probability distribution of results based on 1000 iterations Monte Carlo simulation. A Kruskal–Wallis test followed by a Dunn post hoc test was used to determine significant differences between the medians (p ≤ 0.05) of the crop systems using different PAT. Distinct letters on the bracket indicate significant differences among technologies. To determine significant differences between impacts among the schemes a Kruskal–Wallis test followed by a Dunn post hoc test was executed, see Tables S10 and S11 for results. Outcomes show that impacts are statistically different in the majority of the schemes, deducing that environmental impacts reductions are subject to the effectiveness of each individual technology. When comparing the impact reductions of individual PATs to other studies results might differ. For example, Gasso et al. (2014) performed a comparative LCA of a CTF against a random traffic farming (RTF) in Denmark. CTF is a traffic strategy that uses satellites and autosteer systems to separate crop zones and traffic lanes – CTF helps to reduce the overapplication of agricultural inputs by reducing the overlap of agricultural machinery in the field. Their results showed a reduction in all the analyzed impact categories by using CTF, with reduction ranges of human toxicity by 3.0–15.0%, eco-toxicity by 11.0–138.0%, terrestrial eutrophication by 29.0%, and climate change by 50.0%. In contrast, the autosteer and ASC schemes in this study showed a −3.9% and −8.9% on human toxicity, −6.1% and −6.2% on terrestrial ecotoxicity, −2.4% and −6.4% on CC respectively. The discrepancy is due to the modelling approach and technologies implemented in both studies. The autosteer scheme in this research only includes savings on in-field operation fuel, in the case of ASC the input savings on fertilizer use due to overlap reduction was calculated at 11.9% and for herbicides at 6.3%. On the other hand, Gasso et al. (2014) used higher input and emissions savings due to the overlap reduction. For in-field operation diesel reduction they used 23.0% and between 23.0 and 32.0% for soil emissions reduction. In a different LCA study by Medel-Jiménez et al. (2022) a proximal crop sensor was used for VRNA in a Lower Austrian field experiment. By using the tractors’ mounted proximal sensor, the CC was reduced by 8.6% in the best of the scenarios. In Missouri, Li et al. (2016) also implemented a proximal sensor for VRNA for crop production, here a 10.0% reduction in CC was achieved. The experimental design and in-site pedoclimate characteristics in both experiments gave different fertilizer input savings, a reduction of fertilizer application of around 21.0% and 17.0% by Medel-Jiménez et al. (2022) and Li et al. (2016) respectively was shown, in comparison this study shows a 23.9% reduction. The discrepancy in CC reductions can be explained by the differences in the experimental design, as well as by the results of the conventional/base schemes to be compared. In Fig. 4, the environmental impacts of different PATs on an area-based FU are compared across crops in the agricultural system, Fig. S3 shows the results on a mass-based FU. Crop production utilizing high number of agricultural inputs and agricultural processes hotspots can be seen in this figure, where rapeseed, winter wheat, and winter barley utilize higher agricultural production inputs, while soybean the lowest inputs. Rapeseed, for example, uses the highest amount of fertilizer at 155 kg N/ha but the lowest number of seeds at 3.5 kg/ha. On the other hand, soybean crop production uses 60 kg N/ha and a relatively high number of seeds at 125 kg/ha. The production of soybean seeds is a hotspot in the cultivation of this crop. Emissions arising from deforestation and change in arable land are considered by the background ecoinvent v3.8 cut-off database (ecoinvent, 2021), which shows that soybean production for seeding has a more substantial environmental impact compared to other crops. Fertilizer manufacturing is a process hotspot in the production of the five-year crop system. This process contributes approximately half of the total emissions to FE, FET, HT, and TET impacts, while soil emissions are a hotspot in the FPMF and TA categories since it accounts for over 70.0% of total emissions. Emissions of heavy metals to groundwater and air contribute significantly to FET and TET. FET is primarily caused by copper, zinc, and silver leaching into groundwater, while TET is mainly driven by copper emissions into the air. Hexavalent chromium (Cr VI) compounds in groundwater are the major contributors to HT; studies have shown the carcinogenic effect of Cr VI on humans (Wilbur et al., 2012). FE is mainly provoked by phosphate leaching into groundwater. The indirect soil emission NH3 is the prime responsible for FPMF and TA. In the case of CC, approximately 40.0% of total emissions are attributed to soil emissions while 30.0% to fertilizer manufacturing although these numbers vary between crops, but soybean being the exception. In this case, the production of soybean seeds contributes between 27.0 and 30.0% and soil emission between 32.0 and 34.0% in the different schemes. Soil N2O and CO2 fluxes into the air are the main contributors to CC. 3.1. Sensitivity analysis of soil emissions by using the DNDC model In this subsection the results of a sensitivity analysis on the fertilization activity by using the alternative DNDC model to quantify soil emissions are presented, see Table 4. The fertilization activity was chosen because it is considered a hotspot in the agricultural production process and it is the only activity being affected by soil emissions. Table 4. Sensitivity analysis of fertilization using the DNDC model to simulate soil emissions. Notes: 1 Conventional scheme = 100%. Numbers rounded to two decimal points. To model soil emissions due to fertilization the approach based on Krexner et al. (Unpublished results) was used. Krexner et al. (Unpublished results) used the IPCC tier I/II methodologies, SALCA-NO3, SALCA-P, SALCA-heavy metal, and EMEP/EEA guidebooks. 2 Conventional scheme = 100%. Numbers rounded to two decimal points. The DeNitrification-DeComposition (DNDC) soil model was used to quantify soil emissions due to fertilization. Results highlighted in green show a significant increase in impact reduction when compared to the conventional scheme. Results highlighted in red show a significant decrease in impact reduction when compared to the conventional scheme. Results in blue did not change. The use of DNDC to simulate soil emissions did not influence environmental impacts, such as FET, HT, and TET, where emissions factors from soil are insignificant. This is because emissions from fertilizer manufacturing have a greater impact, as shown in Fig. 4. Consequently, results for these impacts were unchanged, regardless of whether DNDC or IPCC tier I/II and the SALCA methodologies were employed. In contrast, the use of DNDC has a greater effect on CC, FPMF, FE, and TA impacts where soil emissions used in the LCIA approach – in this case, ReCiPe 2016 midpoint (H) – are significant. Using soil emissions from the DNDC model, the autosteer showed a 13 times higher reduction potential than that achieved using the IPCC tier I/II, SALCA and EMEP/EEA methodologies in the CC impact, while the ASC, prescription map, and proximal sensor schemes demonstrated reductions of 6, 5 and 3 times higher respectively. A reason for this is the reduction observed in the N2O emission from 15.4 to 0.2 kg by the DNDC despite simulating an increase of CO2 from 1183.1 to 5227.3 kg – both in the conventional scheme. It is relevant to differentiate that CO2 simulated by DNDC is due to soil respiration of SOC while the IPCC tier I uses an emission factor based on urea application. In addition, it is also observed an increase in the reduction of FE impact by the DNDC model, in this case the autosteer, ASC, prescription map, and proximal sensor schemes showed reductions of 7, 4, 3, and 2 times higher than using soil emissions from the chosen models in this research, see models in section 2.2.2. A cause for this is that the DNDC leachate and run-off simulating P emissions were negligible, in contrast the original SALCA-P model gave a phosphate leachate and runoff of 0.5 and 1.8 kg P respectively. The use of soil emissions from DNDC resulted in a significant decrease on the FPMF and TA impact reductions. The indirect soil emission of NH3 increased four times, passing from 127.8 to 543.1 kg NH3. Moreover, in terms of NOx the original soil model did not differentiate between NO and NO2, DNDC simulated NO and N2 fluxes from soil denitrification without NO2 fluxes. Consequently, instead of observing a reduction, FPMF and TA impacts increased, particularly in the case of TA, in which NH3 has a higher impact factor. The results of this analysis were found to be consistent with the findings of a study conducted by Deng et al. (2017), in which the DNDC model predicted lower N2O, NO3- leaching and NH3 soil fluxes than the emission factors from the IPCC method. Additionally, results by Guo et al. (2012) the direct N2O emissions from IPCC were four times higher than DNDC. Moreover, recent results by Medel-Jiménez et al. (2022) shown that indirect soil emissions NH3 and NO3 by DNDC were more susceptible to the amount of applied fertilizer than N2O. Nevertheless, this study does not provide insight into the specific factors that drive this sensitivity. Nonetheless, the use of DNDC to quantify soil emissions gives a closer reality to temporal and site-specific influences affecting the sustainability of PATs. Still, the DNDC model is a model with high spatial resolution, relying on regional and even local input data, like weather conditions and soil parameters, which makes it the right choice for regional/local LCA studies but not, as in this case, for studies covering supra-regional spaces. 4. Conclusion A comparative LCA analysis was conducted to quantify the environmental impacts of a hypothetical five-year crop-rotation system under the climate and management conditions of arable land in Lower Austria. This study compares the environmental impacts with and without employing precision agriculture technologies (PATs) for crop production. The technology that shows the highest reductions is proximal sensors, followed by prescription maps created by vegetation data from remote sensors, ASC, and autosteer with reductions of 17.0, 8.9, 6.4, and 2.4% on CC impacts, respectively. These results show benefits due to agricultural input savings related to the use of PATs but reliability of these findings is limited due to the high degree of uncertainty in the used savings potentials data since site-specific and experimental variables vary between consulted studies and because data is only available for very large plot sizes which can rarely be found in Austria. Furthermore, the results of this research show that rapeseed production in Lower Austria uses the highest amount of fertilizer in the crop system, hence contributing the most to the majority of the environmental impacts in terms of area and mass-based results. The manufacturing of fertilizer is identified as a hotspot in the TET, FET, and HT and soil emissions in the CC, FPMF, and TA impacts. Additionally, a sensitivity analysis on fertilization activity was performed using the DeNitrification-DeComposition (DNDC) biogeochemical soil model to simulate soil emissions of arable land in Lower Austria. The results indicate a significant change in the indirect NH3 and NO3 emissions, being FPMF and TA the most affected impacts. Assessing and comparing the environmental impacts of multiple PATs in a single study has never been performed; this research could lead to the creation of a standardized framework to assess the effectiveness of smart agricultural technologies in combating the effects of climate change on crop production. Further research should emphasize the importance of evaluating these technologies under consistent management practices, weather, and field characteristics. Additionally, further analysis could be conducted to identify the effects of field size and shape, machinery working width, and site-and temporal weather factors affecting agricultural inputs savings by each PAT.

Introduction Rapid agricultural evolution has given rise to precision agriculture, meeting the global demand for sustainable and efficient food production (Yaqot et al., 2022). The fundamental principle of precision agriculture is to optimize resource utilization, enhance plant health, and promote environmental sustainability (Rusmayadi et al., 2023). The accurate application of agricultural inputs, particularly pesticides, plays a significant role in achieving these objectives across vast and diverse sectors (Meshram et al., 2021). Traditionally, the manual and uniform distribution of pesticides has resulted in excessive chemical usage and adverse environmental impacts. These limitations have been mitigated through the adoption of precision farming tools, such as GPS-guided equipment and data analytics. Unmanned aerial systems (UASs) are prominently utilized for pesticide spraying (Frankelius et al., 2017, Wang et al., 2022). Precision agriculture is a comprehensive farming approach that efficiently utilizes data, technology, and high-tech equipment to manage agricultural resources, including water, land, fertilizers, and pesticides (Karunathilake et al., 2023). It enables the precise application of inputs at specific locations, ensuring that each part of the field receives the necessary nutrients, as opposed to conventional farming methods that treat an entire field uniformly. UASs, along with technologies such as satellite imagery, global positioning system (GPS), and geographic information system (GIS), are integrated to achieve this precision (Tayari et al., 2015). Precision agriculture heavily relies on Variable Rate Spraying (VRS) and its significance cannot be overstated. Conventional agricultural techniques result in pesticide overuse due to uncontrolled spraying, whereas VRS tailors pesticide spraying to meet the precise requirements of different locations within a field (Alam et al., 2020). By interpreting the data collected from sensors and integrating it with real-time environmental information, UASs adjust spray rates, coverage, and application patterns ensuring that pesticides and other inputs reach their intended locations with the required quantities. VRS positively impacts the environment and economy, reduces wasteful resource usage, enhances crop health, and minimizes waste from chemical production (Hussain et al., 2019). UASSs comprise a multi-rotor or a fixed-wing drone and are equipped with various components such as pesticide tanks, pumps, and nozzles to effectively dispense pesticides or fertilizers. They are also equipped with GPS and navigation technology to map the field accurately and follow predefined flight paths and maintain the required altitude and velocity. The operator can manually control UASSs using a remote control or set up the flight plan using software such as precision flight or drone deploy, enabling autonomous operations. They have become essential instruments in precision agriculture due to their precise spray capabilities (Hassler and Baysal-Gurel, 2019, Mukherjee et al., 2019; Yae et al., 2016). Fig. 1, Fig. 2 depict a DJI MG-1P eight-rotor electric UASS model (Shan et al., 2022) and an SG 10P eight-rotor UASS model (Hanif et al., 2023), respectively.

A SG 10P eight-rotor UASS model equipped with both manual and automatic controls used for spraying in agricultural fields. UASSs automate and enhance crop spraying, eliminating the need for manual labor and reducing human exposure to hazardous chemicals. For effective pest and disease management, UASSs are also equipped with various sensors and technologies, such as high-precision GPS and real-time kinematics (RTK). This enables UASSs to follow precise flight paths, ensuring accurate coverage during spraying. RTK provides centimeter-level accuracy, crucial for precision spraying (Ekaso et al., 2020, Hassler and Baysal-Gurel, 2019). UASSs reduce chemical use and pesticide overspray, resulting in cost savings and environmental benefits (Hassler et al., 2019). They operate at low altitudes with precise control, minimizing the spray drift caused by wind pressure and decreasing the risk of environmental contamination and unintended harm to neighboring crops (Chen et al., 2022). UASSs access complex field areas that are typically difficult for conventional ground-based equipment to access, ensuring even spray coverage across crops while adjusting pesticide flow rates for resource optimization and cost reduction (Ayamga et al., 2021, Lian et al., 2019). Furthermore, UASSs efficiently and rapidly disperse fertilizers, ensuring that crops receive the necessary minerals for healthier growth and increased harvest yields (Rahman et al., 2021), which reduce labor costs and fertilization process time (Ayamga et al., 2021). UASSs provide diverse agricultural benefits, including improved resource management, minimized pesticide usage, enhanced productivity, and early detection of crop issues. Pesticides, herbicides, and fertilizers can be precisely sprayed by primarily regulating the flow rate to distribute appropriate amounts of inputs, ensuring high-yield, environmentally-conscious agriculture (Rahman et al., 2021). Precisely controlling the flow rate is vital for VRS, which is the primary objective of this review. VRS focuses on uniform input delivery via an intelligent, adaptable approach that considers the specific needs of each field region. Such precision allows farmers to enhance the efficiency of their inputs, reduce waste, and minimize environmental impact, increase productivity, promote environmental sustainability, and improve economic viability (Alam et al., 2020). Developing flow rate control techniques can enhance productivity, reduce chemical usage, improve crop health, and promote agricultural sustainability (Meshram et al., 2021). These technical advancements involve developing new tools and laying the foundation for a more prosperous and sustainable agricultural future (Frankelius et al., 2017). This review serves as a guide, highlighting the incredible advancements in VRS for precise spray requirements in precision agriculture using UASSs. The fundamentals of flow rate control mechanisms, data-driven approaches, practical applications, and significant challenges in precision agriculture are also discussed. This review provides a comprehensive understanding of the cutting-edge innovations that are reshaping traditional farming methods and highlights the potential for new development, encouraging further research and invention. This review has been meticulously structured to guide readers through the essential components of VRS using UASSs. Each section covers various aspects of UASS technology via thorough discussions and examples. Moreover, the innovative impact of precision agriculture is illustrated using a knowledge matrix. The review concludes with a summary of findings, highlighting the crucial role of precise spray control in precision agriculture and outlining future research directions for agricultural transformation. 2. Flow rate control methods 2.1. Conventional flow rate control systems Precision agriculture has witnessed notable developments, particularly related to flow rate control while spraying agricultural inputs. These developments are based on the fundamental principles of conventional flow rate control systems. These advancements in flow rate control are crucial for enhancing the precision and efficiency of input application in agriculture, directly impacting crop health and resource conservation. This section discusses conventional techniques, along with their operation principles and drawbacks. 2.1.1. Traditional methods for flow rate control Conventional flow rate control systems relied on mechanical components and manual adjustments. These adjustments included simple mechanical systems, valve settings, and fixed nozzles to regulate the flow rate of agricultural inputs during spraying. The flow rates, valve positions, and nozzle sizes were manually controlled based on predefined values or operators’ experience. Importantly, these parameters remained constant irrespective of the varying field conditions. 2.1.2. Limitations of conventional systems Conventional flow rate control systems have several limitations: they are inflexible and cannot adapt to changing environmental conditions. Moreover, the efficiency of input application is impacted by wind speed, wind direction, and manual control. Excessive doses may be applied to fields with high input requirements, leading to resource wastage and environmental harm (Abbas et al., 2020, Chen et al., 2020, Tewari et al., 2020). Conversely, undertreated areas may result in reduced agricultural yields. As conventional systems are manually operated, operators must constantly monitor and adjust parameters during spraying. This increases the potential for human errors and creates labor-intensive requirements. This lack of adaptability leads to inaccurate and inefficient spraying of inputs, consequently resulting in excessive or insufficient pesticide usage (Tewari et al., 2020). As a result, newer systems have been developed to address these shortcomings. The input application rates vary based on the operators’ expertise and experience, resulting in inconsistent crop protection and reduced yields. The flow rate management process of these methods cannot be integrated with real-time data, such as field conditions, crop health information, and meteorological data. Thus, efficient flow rate control mechanisms must be developed by leveraging technology, automation, and data-driven decision-making to overcome these challenges and revolutionize the spraying process (Chen et al., 2017). These developments and their significance will be further discussed in the following sections. 2.2. Decision support for flow rate in UASSs The integration of UASSs into precision agriculture has enabled innovative, flexible, and precise control of flow rates (Chen et al., 2022). Herein, the most recent advancements that revolutionize flow rate control and adaptable and dynamic methods for precision spraying are discussed. 2.2.1. Innovations and technologies improving flow rate control Artificial intelligence (AI) systems can process and analyze large datasets in real-time by gathering data from various sources, including meteorological conditions, field variability, crop health, and past performance, to make data-driven and adaptive decisions. Such systems can be used to control the flow rate and quickly adapt to varying conditions such as input requirements and wind speed variations (Liu et al., 2021; Sanchez et al., 2023). Machine learning (ML) models can learn from existing data and generate predictive algorithms that estimate the optimal flow rates based on different parameters. This predictive control is particularly valuable in dynamic agricultural environments. ML models continuously enhance their predictions by learning from the accumulated data, yielding precise and effective flow rate adjustments (Ayoub et al., 2022, Yanlie et al., 2016). Alam et al. (2020) used random forest classifier to detect and classify weeds. Their classification model was initially trained offline using an image dataset before testing in the field. An application device equipped with a pulse width modulation (PWM)–based fluid flow controller and a vision-based feedback system was used to spray the required input quantity. AI enables highly personalized input applications based on the field characteristics and environmental parameters, such as crop health and soil conditions (Tewari et al., 2020). Liu et al. (2021) developed a ML-based variable-rate sprayer and assessed its performance by accurately spraying targeted weeds. They used deep learning techniques to categorize weeds in real-time. The variable-rate sprayer, designed to control the flow rate, comprises a camera for capturing images, a computer for analyzing photos, a microcontroller board for system control, and spray nozzles with solenoid valves. The system sends trigger signals based on real-time captured images to control the flow rate of the nozzles. Kotkar et al. (2021) presented an innovative approach of automated chemical spraying using a convolutional neural network (CNN) to identify crop illnesses using object identification, image preprocessing, segmentation, extraction, and categorization. 2.2.2. Benefits of advanced flow rate control The accuracy and versatility of modern flow rate control systems reduce the adverse impacts of agriculture on the environment. Minimizing waste and avoiding excessive chemical use contribute to environmentally friendlier and sustainable farming practices. Precision farming input application ensures that crops receive the exact care they require, preventing over- and under-treatment and enhancing crop resilience, health, and yield. Moreover, advanced flow rate control techniques have become increasingly automated, reducing manual oversight and workload and ensuring optimal farm management (Dou et al., 2018, Yanlie et al., 2016). 3. Advanced technologies for flow rate control Flow rates must be precisely controlled to enhance crop health, reduce wasteful use of resources, and optimize input distribution. Herein, the related cutting-edge technologies that ensure precise flow rate control and distribution of inputs in the field are discussed. 3.1. Electromechanical flow control Electromechanical systems have revolutionized precision agriculture by providing precision and flexibility in flow rate control. These systems are built on the fundamental concept of mechanical systems by integrating electrical inputs and combine mechanical and electrical components to control the agricultural input flow. For instance, electrically actuated valves that adjust feed rates for large-scale wheat farming based on variations in soil moisture content. Sensors provide real-time data on soil conditions, which enables these valves to precisely control the distribution of water and nutrients and maximize crop production while preserving resources (Luck et al., 2015). Fig. 3(a) refers to the electromechanical-based nozzle, i.e., solenoid-controlled nozzle and Fig. 3(b) shows the disassembled view of the nozzle with all the components labeled (Grisso et al., 2011).

Electromechanical phenomenon-based flow control nozzle: (a) fasting-acting, solenoid-controlled nozzle and (b) components of the solenoid-controlled nozzle. Electrostatic nozzles in precision agriculture have enhanced precision in spraying applications. By charging droplets, these nozzles increase the adhesion of pesticides to plants, leading to more efficient use of chemicals and reduced drift. For instance, they are utilized in vineyards to uniformly distribute pesticides on grapevines and reduce chemical drift, thereby yielding high-quality wines (Law, 1983, Law, 2001). Fig. 4 schematizes the electrostatic nozzle designed and developed by Patel et al. (2017) specifically for orchards, which ensures accurate co-axial alignment between the annular ring electrode and the nozzle, allowing for uniform spraying.

Intelligent flow control valves exemplify the synergy between precision agriculture and data-driven decision-making. Integrated with a network of sensors, these valves dynamically adjust flow rates in real-time while continuously monitoring field conditions. Sensors measure temperature, crop health, and soil moisture. Using these data, intelligent valves adjust irrigation rates to ensure plants receive appropriate amounts of water at the right time, thereby maximizing production and reducing water consumption. These control valves operate systematically by collecting information on crop health, weather, and soil moisture. They reduce the pressure in irrigation systems when rainfall is anticipated to prevent overwatering, whereas they increase the flow to ensure plants receive adequate water during a heatwave. The valve adjusts pesticide rates for concentrated application if the crop health sensors identify any illnesses. Such real-time automation optimizes crop health and resource utilization by making all necessary modifications automatically (Hussain et al., 2020, Sharda et al., 2015). Nasir et al. (2021) developed an intelligent pressure and flow rate control system for VRS based on proportional integral derivative (PID). Fig. 5 schematizes the intelligent flow rate control mechanism.

Pneumatic systems use air pressure to direct fluid flow based on the agricultural field. Such systems are used in citrus orchards, where the tree height and canopy density vary considerably. Pneumatic systems optimize resource utilization by automatically adapting input application rates to accommodate these variations and ensure uniform coverage (Zhu et al., 2006). The compressed air flow in these systems is regulated by specially designed valves and regulators. The released air changes the system pressure, ultimately governing the input flow. Sensors that monitor changes in air pressure, altitude, or other pertinent variables are connected to this system. To guarantee a steady and accurate input supply, the system adjusts the pressure and airflow as it detects deviations, such as different terrains or atmosphere conditions (Al-Gaadi et al., 2023). 3.2. Precision nozzles and valves A key element of VRS is the selection of suitable nozzles and valves to ensure that the flow rates of inputs are precisely adjusted to the specific needs of crops. The effect of these components on enhancing the effectiveness of VRS is discussed herein. 3.2.1. Specialized nozzles and valves for VRS Specialized nozzles and valves are versatile and meet the evolving modern farming demands. These specialized components are used in large citrus farms and dynamically adjust input application rates based on the fruit load and tree size. For larger, leafy trees receive more quantity of pesticide and nutrients, ensuring uniform coverage and optimal fruit quality. In contrast, smaller trees require less pesticide quantity, preventing the overuse of resources by the use of specialized nozzles and valves (Berenstein et al., 2017; Dou et al., 2018, Garcera et al., 2017). The varieties of specialized nozzles are discussed in subsequent sections. 3.2.2. Dual-Nozzle systems for targeted spraying Dual-nozzle systems are distinctive because they have two nozzles with different flow rates, allowing targeted and synchronized spraying. The dual-nozzle systems used in apple orchards have specialized nozzles with distinct spray patterns and droplet sizes (Lu et al., 2022). There are two types of nozzles: one designed for spraying leaves and the other for soil-applied pesticides. These nozzles are strategically arranged to ensure that inputs are precisely delivered to the tree canopy areas. These systems enhance pesticide distribution and reduce overlap in pesticide spraying (Lyle et al., 1986). 3.2.3. Variable orifice nozzles for adaptive control Variable orifice nozzles precisely adjust the diameter of the nozzle orifice using a manual actuator and control the flow rate of agricultural inputs, such as fertilizers and insecticides. The nozzle can mechanically expand or compress the orifice aperture using a screw mechanism or a variable-curvature design, allowing it to rapidly adapt to changing needs (Fulton et al., 2016). In more advanced applications, variable-orifice nozzles are used with electronic controls. These systems change the orifice diameter in real-time in response to the data obtained from sensors or remote-control devices. Automated responsiveness to changing conditions in the field and greater precision in flow rate changes are two benefits of electronic control (Luck et al., 2015). Fig. 7 shows the conceptual design and the working model of a variable orifice nozzle, (a) schematizes the variable orifice nozzle and its components (Bui, 2005) and (b) shows the actual image of a variable orifice nozzle (Luck et al., 2010).

Variable orifice nozzle for adaptive control (a) schematic of a variable-orifice nozzle with its components labeled and (b) actual image of the variable orifice nozzle. 3.3. Real-Time monitoring and feedback systems Real-time monitoring and feedback systems use a wide range of sensors and actuators to adapt to varying field conditions, and the construction of sensors varies depending on the desired application (Cruvinel et al., 2016). 3.3.1. Sensors and systems providing Real-Time feedback Weather Sensors: These electronic devices include thermometers for recording temperature information, hygrometers for tracking humidity, and anemometers for measuring wind speed. Designed to endure external elements, they can provide precise meteorological data (Kumar et al., 2020). The integration of weather sensors is crucial for the real-time decision-making of UASSs. Specialized weather sensors are strategically incorporated into the system, continuously monitoring key weather parameters, including temperature, humidity, wind speed, and precipitation. For instance, the system adjusts spray rates in high temperatures to prevent evaporation, ensuring precise delivery. If wind speeds surpass safety thresholds, UASSs alter their flight path to prevent overspray. Similarly, precipitation detection prompts an automatic suspension of spraying, preserving product efficacy and minimizing environmental impact (Faiçal et al., 2014). Sensors for measuring soil moisture: These devices are often fabricated using robust components and include probes that are buried to gauge the moisture content at different depths, designed for extended use in fields, they endure harsh conditions (Alwis et al., 2013, Lekshmi et al., 2014). By seamlessly integrating soil moisture sensors, UASSs optimize variable-rate spraying strategies based on precise soil conditions. These sensors continuously measure soil moisture levels throughout the field, and the data are transmitted to the onboard AI-driven system to enable VRS. In areas with low soil moisture, the AI system may dynamically increase spray rates to enhance crops’ water retention and nutrient absorption (Duangsuwan et al., 2020). Fig. 8 refers various types of soil moisture sensors, typically compact, cost-effective, and precise. Certain models are combined with sensors for soil temperature and salinity, while others incorporate dataloggers and radio communication systems for easier installation and retrieval in the field (Cahn & LF, 2017).

Fig. 9 shows a schematic that illustrates the integration of various sensors and feedback mechanisms for the implementation of smart farming. Smart sensors enable precise monitoring of environmental factors, including temperature, moisture, and humidity. Certain sensors are capable of evaluating soil quality by measuring nitrate levels and water content. Detection of plant diseases and insect pests is achieved through high-resolution cameras. UAV-based surveillance facilitates continuous monitoring of crop growth and farm land topology. Automated mass flow sensors are employed to estimate crop production accurately (Rajak et al., 2023).

Schematic of the integration of various sensors and feedback mechanisms for the implementation of smart farming. 3.3.2. Intelligent sensors for flow rate control Intelligent sensors control flow rate control using ML algorithms, deep learning models, and microprocessors by analyzing the incoming data. Intelligent sensors can facilitate efficient data transfer to control systems by installing wireless communication modules (Paul et al., 2022). Operators can remotely adjust these sensors to changing circumstances. For instance, intelligent sensors with advanced ML techniques are employed in vineyards to identify potential signs of illness or increased insect impact. These sensors can be configured remotely and have solid wireless connectivity, allowing for quick and effective flow rate control (Talaviya et al., 2020). In regions with lower soil moisture indicative of potential dryness stress, the system autonomously increases the flow rate for targeted irrigation and optimized nutrient delivery. Conversely, in areas with higher soil moisture levels that indicate ample hydration, the system adeptly lowers the flow rate, avoids over-application, and conserves resources. 3.3.3. Wireless communication for data transmission Wireless communication systems are designed for long-range connectivity across a diversified agricultural field, transferring real-time data from sensors positioned throughout the field to a centralized control unit. They also have redundant data routes and communication protocols to ensure reliable data transmission even in challenging conditions. Data sent across wireless communication technologies are encoded to prevent unauthorized access, and a reliable safety feature is included in their design (Feng et al., 2019). Fig. 10 shows a wireless communication-based data transmission system designed for crop health monitoring in conjunction with remote sensing (Shafi et al., 2019). Download : Download high-res image (474KB) Download : Download full-size image Fig. 10. Wireless communication-based data transmission system. For instance, the integration of radio frequency (RF) and satellite-based wireless communication ensures seamless data transmission and enhanced precision of variable-rate applications. With its diverse frequency bands and reliable short-range capabilities, RF communication facilitates direct line-of-sight data exchange between the UASS and the ground control station (Proshkin et al., 2021). This proves advantageous in scenarios where real-time updates on crop conditions are vital for dynamic decision-making during the flight. Simultaneously, satellite-based communication provides a broader reach, particularly in remote or expansive agricultural areas where traditional communication infrastructure may be lacking. Leveraging satellite links, UASSs used for VRS can transmit real-time data to and from the ground control system. This global connectivity ensures continuous and uninterrupted communication, allowing respective systems to make instantaneous adjustments to the VRS parameters based on the latest information received from the field (Islam et al., 2021, Matese et al., 2015, Radoglou-Grammatikis et al., 2020). 3.3.4. Closed-Loop control systems for dynamic adjustments Closed-loop control systems integrate hardware and software for real-time dynamic adjustments to the flow rate. These systems are equipped with highly advanced software that consolidates information from various sources and sensors for real-time analysis and decision-making. Hardware components, such as controllers and actuators, endure environmental conditions and ensure accurate and swift changes to flow rate. Adaptive algorithms are a feature of closed-loop control systems, allowing them to adjust to the temporal variation in agricultural field conditions. These algorithms are designed to be efficient and adaptable. In large-scale potato farming, these systems are used with advanced software, such as Agrosense, which uses data from meteorological stations to adjust the flow rates (Katamreddy et al., 2019, Kruize et al., 2014). These systems operate dynamically owing to the closed-loop structure and continuously refine decisions based on the latest data inputs. This results in a responsive and adaptive approach to VRS, where the UASS becomes an agile decision-making entity, finely tuning its actions to the specific needs of each part of the field. Closed-loop control systems incorporate several sensors on the UASS, capturing data on crop health, soil conditions, and environmental factors (Hafeez et al., 2023, Hao et al., 2022). As the flight traverses the field, the closed-loop system processes these data and compares them against predefined parameters (Faiçal et al., 2017). 3.3.5. Integration with Unmanned aerial vehicle navigation for precise delivery Unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) navigation systems have sophisticated algorithms and GPS technology, enabling precise navigation in specific areas. The design of these systems guarantees accurate placement and movement control (Maddikunta et al., 2021). The real-time communication between flow rate control systems and UAVs forms the foundation of their integration. Strong communication links are incorporated into these systems to ensure uninterrupted contact throughout the navigation process. Dynamic adjustment algorithms are built into the flow rate control systems and UAV navigation systems, allowing for real-time adjustments to flow rates based on data and feedback. For instance, in a large-scale soybean farm, this integration ensures that UAVs use real-time data and GPS coordinates to dynamically adjust the pace at which pesticides are sprayed as they explore different field portions. This design optimizes resource utilization and increases crop yield by enabling precise distribution to specific locations (Garre and Harish, 2018, Xue et al., 2016). 4. Data-Driven approaches for flow rate control 4.1. AI in flow rate control Precision agriculture now relies significantly on AI (Bhat et al., 2021), particularly for flow rate control. AI technologies improve the distribution of agricultural inputs, ensuring they target crops with unprecedented precision and reduce waste. ML can regulate the flow rate of pesticides and herbicides based on real-time data using trained algorithms for efficient spraying and reduced costs. 4.1.1. Application of ML algorithms 4.1.1.1. Supervised learning for flow rate prediction Precision agriculture extensively uses supervised learning (Sharma et al., 2021), particularly for predicting the ideal pesticide and fertilizer spraying flow rates. Crop-specific models are a notable application of this technology, which are finely tuned to meet the crop needs (Alam et al., 2020). For instance, a supervised learning model is developed for soybean cultivation using historical data and real-time insights. This model considers crop development phases, meteorological circumstances, insect frequency, and indications of the health of individual plants (Yoosefzadeh-Najafabadi et al., 2020). Based on the continuous integration of data from weather stations, aerial vehicles, and gauges, the model forecasts precise flow rates required for accurate pesticide application. Supervised ML involves collecting extensive datasets containing crop types, vegetation indices, weather conditions, and historical spraying records. These datasets are used to train the machine-learning model (Guo et al., 2020). For instance, the model is trained to recognize patterns correlating specific vegetation indices with optimal pesticide concentrations. The algorithm refines its internal parameters based on the provided dataset during training. It learns to identify intricate relations between input features and the desired output, which, in the context of VRS, could be the optimal flow rate and spray pattern for a given set of field conditions (Patil et al., 2023). 4.1.1.2. Unsupervised learning for pattern recognition Unsupervised learning is a data-driven method that can provide insights into complicated farming systems for pattern detection (Liakos et al., 2018). Focused, precise farming techniques can be implemented based on this approach by identifying minute correlations and trends in agricultural data, ensuring efficient resource utilization, and minimizing ecological impacts (Priya et al., 2020). Unsupervised learning is commonly used for cultivating row crops to identify weed trends across farms, particularly for maize and soybeans (Louargant et al., 2018). The differences in plant density and colors are analyzed using the information collected by sensors and UAVs. By identifying weed clusters and their sequences of dispersion, the system can initiate concentrated pesticide applications (Gnädinger et al., 2017). Unsupervised ML techniques, particularly clustering algorithms such as k-means, are used to segment the agricultural field into distinct zones based on similarities in environmental characteristics. The algorithm autonomously identify patterns in the data and segments the field without any guidance (Badapanda et al., 2022). Unlike supervised learning, unsupervised learning operates without predefined output labels. In the context of VRS, the algorithm adapts to the variabilities of the field. 4.1.2. Ai-based optimization of flow rates 4.1.2.1. Neural network models for adaptive control While predictive models are not the sole focus of AI, adaptive control systems can dynamically adjust flow rates based on real-time conditions. Disease detection in vineyards is revolutionizing owing to neural network models, particularly CNN. Real-time information from multispectral cameras installed on UAVs is processed using these models, particularly for early disease detection (Tsouros et al., 2019). By analyzing the multispectral camera images, symptoms such as powdery mildew on grapevines can be detected (Knauer et al., 2017). When a disease is identified, the dynamic spray system accurately applies pesticides to the affected regions. This reduces the amount of chemicals used and ensures good health of the harvested grapes, a crucial factor for producing high-quality wines (Hao et al., 2022). 4.1.2.2. Reinforcement learning in precision spraying Reinforcement learning is revolutionizing precision spraying, particularly in Weed management, by enabling decision-making regarding the use of insecticides and other chemicals using real-time information and feedback (Gautron et al., 2022). UASSs that use reinforcement learning algorithms are used in cotton plantations to modify herbicide treatment rates based on the assessment of weed concentration. This continuous adaptation ensures efficient weed control while minimizing the use of pesticides. It represents an innovative, method of optimizing flow rates, ensuring pesticides are applied only when necessary and reducing their adverse effects on the ecosystem (Gao et al., 2019). 4.2. Integration of remote sensing data 4.2.1. Incorporating UAV-Collected data for precision spraying decisions Precision spraying decision-making depends on data, such as remote sensing data, particularly for flow rate control (Huang et al., 2018). This approach integrates advanced technology and data analytics. UAVs are equipped with advanced sensors that capture real-time data related to crop health, pest infestations, and soil conditions (Jia et al., 2021). This unique data collected during each flight serve as the foundation for data-driven decisions that optimize VRS. 4.2.1.1. Multispectral data for crop health Multispectral cameras equipped with UAVs gather real-time data on the field by capturing spectral bands corresponding to distinct plant properties (Deng et al., 2018).

Spectral data-based crop health monitoring system: (a) UAV equipped with a multi-spectral camera for crop health assessment, (b) components integrated with Raspberry Pi, and (c) assembly of components forming the DAS. The information gathered by these cameras are analyzed for flow rate control. AI software such as Agisoft Metashape or Pix4D are used to process multispectral data. These software programs have built-in ML algorithms developed based on extensive datasets and can identify signatures associated with various factors, including crop health, insect frequency, and nutritional deficits (Wang et al., 2021). For instance, software such as Agisoft Metashape analyzes multispectral data, while a UAV with a multispectral camera hovers over the crops. Depending on these spectral characteristics, field areas with increased insect populations or nutritional deficits are identified (Velusamy et al., 2021). The AI models of the software then adjust the flow rates of connected sprayers based on the previous processed image data (Linhui et al., 2019). This data-driven method reduces waste, maximizes crop health, and minimizes negative environmental impact.

Hyperspectral imaging for disease detection In VRS, hyperspectral imaging is used for early disease detection in crops. Hyperspectral cameras capture data in numerous narrow spectral bands, providing highly detailed information about the field condition (Moghadam et al., 2017), which are used for disease detection.

Visual representation of (a) fungal plant disease and (b) detection of spikelets caused by Fusarium head blight using hyperspectral imaging. The data collected via hyperspectral imaging are processed using advanced AI models and specialized software, such as MATLAB and ENVI. The solutions are designed to recognize spectral patterns associated with various diseases, enabling early disease detection (Li et al., 2022). After the hyperspectral images are captured, the software analyzes the data, identifying potential disease patterns in the field. With the help of integrated software, the system initiates targeted spraying to the affected areas (Khan et al., 2021). This precise approach optimizes disease control and minimizes the need for excessive chemical application. 4.2.2. Fusion of sensor data for enhanced Decision-Making For VRS, the data obtained from various sensors are integrated to understand the field condition and ensuring the precise decision-making and application of pesticides and fertilizers (Zanin et al., 2022). 4.2.2.1. Combining Light detection and ranging data for terrain mapping Light detection and ranging (LiDAR) technology captures precise 3D terrain data (Lin et al., 2021, Lin and Habib, 2021). The LiDAR data are processed in real-time using specialized software, such as Ag Leader SMS (Feng et al., 2019), which uses AI-driven algorithms to create an accurate 3D terrain map of the field. This map is used for calculating the variable rate prescription for each section of the field based on elevation variations (Potena et al., 2019). Fig. 14(a) shows a UAV-based system mounted with LiDAR system for terrain mapping (Banerjee et al., 2019).

LiDAR data-based decision-making system: (a) integrated UAV-LiDAR for terrain mapping and (b) UAV-based mobile mapping system for collecting LiDAR data in a forest plantation under various leaf cover scenarios. This integration of LiDAR data guarantees that the spraying operation is finely tuned to the field topography (Ahmed et al., 2021), leading to minimized resource usage and optimized agricultural yields. 4.2.2.2. Integration with UASS navigation for precise delivery in VRS UASS navigation systems use AI-driven control software to ensure accurate and efficient spraying of pesticides and fertilizers. UASS is equipped with a GNSS and can perform highly accurate positioning and path planning. Integrating these navigation systems and RTK-GPS, such as Trimble’s RTK systems or DJI’s D-RTK GNSS, provides centimeter-level accuracy (Andanaputra et al., 2020). Flight planning and control software, such as Pix4D is also used to plan precise flight paths and manage respective operations (Hasheminasab et al., 2020). As the system follows the defined flight path, the AI-driven control software, often integrated into the flight controller or a companion computer, considers the specific variable rate prescription for each field section. For instance, the software might use a proprietary algorithm developed by the user to precisely activate and deactivate the payload such as a sprayer or dispenser. This ensures that the right amount of pesticide or fertilizer is delivered to match the field requirements (Agurob et al., 2023). 5. Case studies and applications 5.1. Real-World implementations of VRS with UASS The combined use of VRS and UASS has garnered significant recognition for its effectiveness in various agricultural settings. This section will investigate real-world applications of VRS, scrutinizing specific examples and the outcomes derived from deploying UASS in precision agriculture. 5.1.1. Examples of successful applications Lian et al. (2019) proposed a real-time control method for controlling the flow rate of an agricultural UAV spray system. The method used a single-chip microcomputer and micro diaphragm pump to precisely control the pump’s flow rate in real-time, enabling VRS based on different operating conditions. The system’s response speed was evaluated, demonstrating average control response and stability times of 0.18 and 0.75 s for pump flow changes. These results indicate that the system effectively responds to changes in operating conditions and can quickly adjust the pump’s target flow, achieving precise VRS. Thus, VRS systems can be implemented in agricultural UAVs. Liu et al. (2020) proposed a real-time control system for UAV VRS that uses a mathematical model to correlate flight speed, flight height, spray concentration, nozzle voltage, and spray volume, providing a theoretical foundation for research on aerial variable spray. Experimental results demonstrate its effectiveness in accurately calculating spray volume based on parameter changes such as flight speed and height, maintaining a consistent spray concentration across farmland. This system effectively addressed uneven spray issues caused by fluctuating flight parameters by adjusting the real-time spray concentration to meet varying application needs and minimized pesticide waste due to over application of pesticides and under application. The system enhances spray accuracy, lays the groundwork for precision spraying, and reduces manual intervention, thereby improving application efficiency.

Aerial VRS system: (a) design of real-time control for the variable rate spraying system and, (b) Schematic of the hardware control system for the spraying. Wang et al. (2016) developed a pulse with modulation (PWM)-based VRS system. Droplet deposition was studied using the droplet concentration method while the UAV hovered under controllable multi-speed conditions. The system comprises an airborne spraying device, ground measurement, and control unit. The airborne spraying device, equipped with the STM32F103VC MCU, was remotely controlled by the ground measurement and control unit developed by LabWindows/CVI through a wireless data transmission module. The micro-electric diaphragm pump was controlled using a square wave of 10 Hz and an adjustable duty ratio. Then, the pressure and flow rate of the system were adjusted. Experiments were conducted under various distance and wind speed conditions to establish the relation between deposition volume, duty ratio, nozzle type, and the rotating speed of the centrifugal nozzle. Fig. 16 shows the PWM-based VRS system, (a) six rotor UAV used for VRS, (b) shows the spray nozzle with its components and other types of nozzles with varying diameter, while, (c) refers to the schematic of the overall system.

Wen et al. (2018) developed a VRS system to address the varying severity of plant diseases and insect pests in different locations. The system used a STMicroelectronics-32 (STM32) chip as the control system core and used a sensor to obtain real-time prescription values from prescription diagrams. A variable duty cycle pulse square wave was generated to adjust the flow rate, and a closed-loop PID control algorithm was employed to minimize the settling time of the system. Experimental results demonstrated that the system maintained a stable flow rate within 2.16 % of the target value, enabling VRS for diverse requirements. Here, the 2.16 % value signifies the system's consistent achievement of a flow rate very close to the intended target, highlighting its precision in adapting to diverse requirements. This narrow deviation underscores the system’s effectiveness in responding to varying severity of plant diseases and insect pests in different locations. Outdoor tests confirmed the effectiveness of the system in promptly adjusting the flow rate based on prescription map values, maintaining consistent droplet deposition, and achieving uniform deposition density within the operation unit.

Outcomes and benefits in precision agriculture VRS and UASS have transformed precision agriculture. VRS facilitates targeted spraying by leveraging UASS, allowing farmers to optimize crop health management practices (Ahmad et al., 2020). This newfound precision enhanced farm productivity, thereby improving yields and crop quality (Mogili et al., 2018). UASS-based VRS is ecofriendly as it reduces pesticide consumption and has targeted application, aligning with global sustainable farming practices. UASS-based VRS is a catalyst for enhanced crop yields and a contributor to sustainable agriculture (Wen et al., 2019). 5.1.3. Specialty Crops: Optimizing pest control Specialty crops, ranging from delicate berries to high-value vegetables, demand customized pest management solutions. The uniform application of pesticides, a common practice in conventional agriculture, is inadequate for these diverse crops due to variations in plant size, spacing, and vulnerability to specific pests (Warneke et al., 2021). For precise and targeted pest control, UASS-based VRS can be used. UASS seamlessly adapts to the unique challenges of pest control in specialty crops. For instance, in vineyards where grapevines demand meticulous attention, UASS equipped with sophisticated sensors skillfully navigates intricate terrains, enabling the precise delivery of pesticides (Becce et al., 2021). This targeted approach not only optimizes the efficacy of pest control measures but also minimizes environmental impact by considerably reducing the overall volume of pesticides used. The versatility of VRS is exemplified in orchards with diverse topography. UAV equipped with high-resolution cameras and cutting-edge imaging capabilities can effectively pinpoint areas that require treatment, thereby maximizing resource efficiency and minimizing the risk of affecting non-targeted areas (Dubuis et al., 2023). This ability to adapt to varying conditions highlights the transformative potential of UASS-based VRS in optimizing orchard pest control practices. 5.2. Benefits and outcomes in precision agriculture 5.2.1. Increased crop yields and quality UASS-based VRS has revolutionized precision agriculture with its ability to optimize inputs for maximizing outputs (Delavarpour et al., 2021). Precision spraying, tailored to the specific needs of individual plants, mitigates the risks associated with pesticide underdosing and overdosing, offering a critical advantage in row crops (Pawase et al., 2023). Equipped with advanced sensors, UASS navigates the intricate spacing between plants in row crops, ensuring that each plant receives the optimal amount of treatment (Shi et al., 2016). Precision agriculture primarily focuses on enhancing the quality of agricultural products, and precise application of pesticides plays a pivotal role in achieving this goal. In vineyards, for example, the UASS equipped with high-resolution cameras precisely traverses the terrain, delivering targeted treatments that eliminate pests while minimizing chemical residues on grapes. This not only safeguards the quality of the crop but also aligns with consumer demand for sustainably produced and residue-free agricultural products (Chancia et al., 2021). 5.2.2. Reduced pesticide and resource usage The UASS does not rely solely on real-time environmental conditions but leverages pre- and post-flight data analytics during decision-making (Hunter et al., 2020). This comprehensive approach uses historical data and ML algorithms to optimize pesticide application based on a deep understanding of crop health and environmental conditions. Thus, UAS-based VRS effectively reduces pesticide usage without compromising on effectiveness (Chen et al., 2021). The integration of UASS and VRS in agriculture can catalyze holistic resource optimization. This strategic merging of technology and farming practices fosters a sustainable future where the responsible use of pesticides and resources becomes a cornerstone of modern agriculture (Seelan et al., 2003). 5.2.3. Environmental sustainability UASS is a safer, more efficient, and more precise alternative to traditional pesticide application methods. Farmers can considerably reduce the risk of exposure to harmful chemicals and minimize physical damage to crops by applying pesticides using drones (Damalas et al., 2011). Additionally, the UASS can effectively spray small, irregularly shaped fields that would be challenging or impossible to reach with ground sprayers or conventional agricultural aircraft (Wirawan et al., 2022). This technology is particularly beneficial for reducing the risk of pesticide contamination, particularly among applicators that rely on backpack sprayers (Morales-Rodríguez et al., 2022). Traditional pesticide application methods often require multiple tractors to pass through fields, increasing fuel consumption and emissions. UAS targets specific areas of a field, which considerably reduces the need of using a tractor; thus, UAS-based VRS is an ecofriendly alternative and sustainable (Mukherjee et al., 2019, Wang et al., 2020). 5.3. Technical considerations Despite its remarkable advancements, UASS-based VRS faces several challenges. This section delves into the technical, regulatory, and practical challenges encountered during its real-world implementation, providing valuable insights from these experiences. 5.3.1. Technical challenges faced in Real-World applications Sensor limitations pose a significant challenge to the implementation of VRS with UASS. The effectiveness of data collection devices is crucial because the spatial and spectral resolutions of sensors directly impact the precision of VRS (Lee et al., 2010). These challenges can be addressed by developing sensors with higher resolutions, improved accuracy, and broader spectral bandwidths (Basso et al., 2019). Agricultural landscapes present unique navigation challenges, necessitating advanced algorithms for path planning and obstacle avoidance to navigate diverse and dynamic environments. The demand for precise and adaptable navigation systems has propelled ongoing research to enhance the UASS autonomy, ensuring efficient and safe operation in the field (Vazquez-Carmona et al., 2022). The inherent variability of agricultural environments poses challenges in ensuring consistent and reliable operation for VRS. Factors such as fluctuating wind speeds and varying humidity levels can impact the accuracy of pesticide application. To address these challenges, environmental dynamics must be understood and adaptive systems that can respond to real-time changes in field conditions must be developed (Faiçal et al., 2017). 5.3.2. Regulatory compliance and safety considerations In the rapidly evolving field of precision agriculture, the UASS can potentially revolutionize agricultural practices. However, the integration of these innovations into existing regulatory frameworks poses a significant challenge (Rao et al., 2016). The dynamic nature of UASS often surpasses the pace of regulatory updates, necessitating adaptability and collaboration among industry stakeholders and regulatory bodies. Safety considerations are paramount in VRS as they form a crucial aspect of regulatory compliance. To ensure technological and personnel safety, aviation regulations, airspace restrictions, and effective risk mitigation strategies must be thoroughly understood (Ayamga et al., 2021). 5.3.3. Farmer adoption and training Technological advancements, cultural norms, and educational initiatives are a few factors that determine the adoption of UASS-based VRS. Farmers, the primary users of this transformative technology, hold the key to its widespread adoption. The initial stages of adoption are often met with hesitation, primarily due to unfamiliarity with the technology, concerns about its financial viability, and reluctance to deviate from established farming practices (Bai et al., 2022). The effectiveness of precision agriculture is influenced by farmers who have their own experiences and technological proficiency. By conducting training programs, farmers can adopt and benefit from this technology (Daberkow et al., 2003). For the long-term adoption of the UASS, farmers should be provided with continuous support mechanisms such as regular software updates, readily accessible troubleshooting resources, and easily contactable support channels that can instill confidence and promote self-sufficiency among farmers. Additionally, collaborative efforts between technology providers, agricultural extension services, and local communities can play a pivotal role in facilitating the adoption of UASS-based VRS into agricultural practices (Klauser et al., 2021). 5.3.4. Integration with crop monitoring and phenotyping Empowered by advanced sensors, UAVs have revolutionized crop monitoring, enabling high-resolution data acquisition in real-time. These drones are equipped with multispectral and hyperspectral sensors and provide farmers an unprecedented understanding of crop health, growth patterns, and potential stress factors (Lu et al., 2020, Tao et al., 2020). Following this comprehensive monitoring, UASS seamlessly transitions into VRS based on the prescription map acquired from UAV monitoring for precise and adaptable pesticide applications (Chia et al., 2020). Phenotyping, a cornerstone of modern agriculture, thoroughly evaluates plant traits and characteristics. UAVs play a pivotal role in phenotyping by capturing high-resolution imagery and multispectral data (Xie and Yang, 2020, Yang et al., 2017), providing farmers with valuable insights into plant health, stress responses, and genetic traits. 6. Challenges and future directions 6.1. Current challenges in flow rate control While UASS-based VRS holds promise, it encounters specific challenges such as sensor accuracy, data integration, and power management, which are crucial for its successful implementation in precision agriculture. This section delves into the intricate nuances of flow rate control and explores innovations that have potential to revolutionize precision agriculture. Further research and development are imperative to tackle the multifaceted challenges posed by precision agriculture demands in flow rate control in flow rate control. 6.1.1. Sensor accuracy and reliability For efficient VRS, high accuracy and reliability of sensors must be ensured. However, maintaining this precision within dynamic agricultural environments is difficult. Sensor drift and environmental influences on the sensor can be mitigated by sensor calibration. Advanced sensor materials, characterized by their excellent stability and resilience to external factors, are garnering research attention. Such materials will enable sensors to consistently and accurately acquire data over extended durations (Yadav et al., 2023). Sensors can drift over time, deviating from their calibrated state and introducing inconsistencies in data acquisition. Although sensor calibration is a fundamental element to ensure sensor accuracy, it presents significant challenges (Luo et al., 2023). Maintaining calibration efficacy in dynamic agricultural environments, characterized by fluctuating temperature, humidity, and other environmental parameters, is a persistent effort (Srbinovska et al., 2015). 6.1.2. Integration of multiple sensors The seamless integration of diverse sensor modalities into the flow rate control framework is challenging, which stems from the inherent heterogeneity of sensors used in precision agriculture. To harmoniously combine these sensors for VRS, cutting-edge technological innovations and deeper understanding of their intricate dynamics are crucial (Zhuang et al., 2023). The practical implementation of sensor fusion in VRS necessitates the seamless integration of diverse technologies. From the conventional optics capturing the visible spectrum to the advanced multispectral and hyperspectral sensors unveiling hidden biophysical properties, each sensor plays a unique and vital role in the composition (Anastasiou et al., 2023). LiDAR and radar add further depth and dimension, providing crucial data on terrain and vegetation structure (Ahmad et al., 2022). However, the real-time synchronization of disparate data streams, robust processing capabilities, and the construction of a unified and coherent dataset demand innovative solutions and a profound understanding of the strengths and limitations of each sensor (Camilli et al., 2007). 6.1.3. Power consumption and UASS payload constraints To ensure optimal performance of VRS systems in precision agriculture, the intricate power–payload challenge must be addressed. To this end, the energy efficiency of sensors and associated technologies must be maximized while ensuring sufficient payload capacity for extended UASS flight durations. The operational longevity of UASS depends on the energy efficiency (Wang et al., 2019). for which finite-capacity batteries must be replaced with energy-efficient technologies. Balancing power consumption and payload is important during extended missions, where achieving equilibrium between operational demands and available power reserves is paramount (Martin et al., 2022). 6.2. Regulatory considerations To successfully integrate UASS into precision agriculture, regulatory compliance must be ensured such that technological advancements align with the dynamic and evolving regulatory landscape governing pesticide spraying operations in agriculture (Giles, 2016). 6.2.1. Compliance with pesticide application regulations While revolutionizing crop management practices, precision agriculture introduces a complex regulatory consideration, particularly for pesticide application. Ensuring adherence to stringent regulations poses a significant challenge, demanding a seamless integration of precision spraying techniques with meticulous data recording, reporting, and analysis procedures (Petty & Chang, 2018). Moreover, robust data-driven tracking and validation systems are required to monitor compliance with pesticide application regulations. These systems must capture a comprehensive range of data, including pesticide type, application rate, target area, and environmental conditions. This data must then be meticulously analyzed to ensure compliance with regulatory standards and optimize spraying practices (Lewis et al., 1997). 6.2.2. Privacy and data security concerns The collection and utilization of vast amounts of agricultural data pose privacy and data security concerns (Kumar et al., 2021), therefore, a holistic approach to risk mitigation and responsible data handling practices such as robust data encryption methods, secure data transmission protocols, and transparent data management practices are required (Gupta et al., 2020). Ongoing developments in privacy-preserving technologies, such as federated learning and secure data aggregation, aim to strike a nuanced balance between data utility and individual privacy in precision agriculture (Chhikara et al., 2021). Regulatory frameworks need to evolve alongside these technological advancements, incorporating comprehensive guidelines that ensure data integrity while promoting the responsible use of agricultural data. Establishing clear standards for data anonymization and de-identification further contributes to building a regulatory environment that fosters innovation while safeguarding sensitive individual information (Dara et al., 2022). 6.3. Future innovations and developments Emerging challenges and related solutions must be understood to effectively manage flow rate control in UASS-based VRS. The future of precision agriculture is primed for transformative advancements driven by innovative solutions that will reshape the VRS landscape. Several approaches for flow rate control are being developed, paving the way for enhanced efficiency, sustainability, and precision in agricultural practices. 6.3.1. Advancements in sensor technology Precision agriculture depends on the precision and reliability of sensors. Studies are being conducted to expand sensor technology (Bogue, 2017), for enhanced data collection and optimized decision-making in UASS-based VRS applications. Nanoscale sensors can revolutionize data collection in precision agriculture and are garnering attention (Duhan et al., 2017). Microscopic sensors operating at the molecular level exhibit high sensitivity and responsiveness, facilitating real-time data acquisition with minimal environmental interference (Manjunatha et al., 2016). Leveraging their nanoscale and microscopic dimensions, along with their enhanced sensitivity, these sensors will enable more precise monitoring of environmental conditions and crop health, thereby enhancing the quality of VRS decisions. Furthermore, these sensors assist in mitigating challenges associated with sensor drift and calibration, allowing more accurate and reliable flow rate control in UASS-based VRS applications. Multispectral and hyperspectral sensors are undergoing transformative enhancements, revolutionizing data collection and decision-making in precision agriculture (Di Gennaro et al., 2022). The spectral range of these sensors will be expanded to comprehensively and intricately understand crop conditions. Advanced multispectral sensors can also be used to assess plant physiological parameters (Wang et al., 2018) and adjust flow rates based on crop health indicators. This approach will enhance the precision and efficacy of VRS and facilitate proactive and targeted pest management strategies. It will also optimize resource use and minimize environmental impact (Radoglou-Grammatikis et al., 2020). 6.3.2. Ai-driven flow rate optimization AI is being widely used for optimizing flow rate control. AI-powered algorithms integrate self-learning and adaptive capabilities into UASSs to enable faster decision-making in precision agriculture (Huang et al., 2018). ML models are continuously trained using vast datasets containing diverse environmental conditions, which empower UASSs to adjust flow rates based on crop requirements using prescription maps (Khan et al., 2021). Hyperspectral images offer a wealth of data on crop health and nutrient needs for every point in a field. Fig. 18 refers to the UAV based DAS used by Kuswidiyanto et al. (2023), in their study for the detection of downy mildew in kimchi cabbage. Download : Download high-res image (531KB) Download : Download full-size image Fig. 18. UAV-based DAS: (a) DJI Matrice 300 RTK as the UAV platform, with two cameras – a hyperspectral camera (Corning 410 MicroHSI) and another high-resolution RGB camera (Zenmuse P1)-for capturing images and (b) images acquired of the respective study field, i.e., kimchi cabbage, using the hyperspectral camera and the high resolution RGB camera. Later on, different models are trained based on the augmented dataset obtained from the prior study using UAV based DAS. The disease prediction results of the studied area can be obtained based on these models. These results can then serve as a prescription map for the UASS to optimize the pesticide flow rate according to the field’s requirement. Fig. 19 shows the aerial hyperspectral imaging, (a) shows the studied area for disease detection, while (b) and (c) refers to the prediction results of the respective studied area. In these figures, the green areas represent healthy plants, while the red areas indicate disease plants in the field (Kuswidiyanto et al., 2023).Hyperspectral images provide information on crop health and nutrient needs for every point in an agricultural field. However, due to limitations for real time analyzing the field and adjusting the flow rates in drone technology, directly applying fertilizer to each pixel is not feasible. Thus, image analysis must be performed to segment images into larger, workable zones (raster segments) such that the drone efficiently distributes fertilizers based on the requirements (Yu et al., 2022). Fig. 20 shows hyperspectral imaging-based system in conjunction with prescription details (a) refers to the fertilizer prescription chart for the agricultural drones, while (b) shows the experimental setup for the agricultural drone with the prescription map used in their study.This adaptability allows UASS to respond swiftly and effectively to changing crop health indicators. Predictive modeling, fueled by AI, facilitates proactive flow rate adjustments, minimizing the reliance on preset parameters and enhancing the overall efficiency and effectiveness of pesticide application. Therefore, AI is used to not only optimize flow rate control but also catalyze autonomous decision-making capabilities during VRS missions (Liu et al., 2020).

The key requirement for crop production is water, and it also needs to fulfill the requirements of the ever-increasing population around the globe. The changing climate significantly impacts agriculture production due to the extreme weather conditions that prevail in various regions. Since urbanization is increasing worldwide, smart cities must find innovative ways to grow food sustainably within built environments. This paper explores how precision agriculture powered by artificial intelligence (AI) can transform crop farms (CF) to enhance food security, nutrition, and environmental sustainability. We developed a robotic CF prototype that uses deep reinforcement learning to optimize seeding, watering, and crop maintenance in response to real-time sensor data. The system was tested in a simulated CF setting and benchmarked. The results revealed a 26% increase in crop yield, a 41% reduction in water utilization, and a 33% decrease in chemical use. We employed AI-enabled precision farming to improve agriculture’s efficiency, sustainability, and productivity within smart cities. The widespread adoption of such technologies makes food supplies resilient, reduces land, and minimizes agriculture’s environmental footprint. This study also qualitatively assessed the broader implications of AI-enabled precision farming. Interviews with farmers and stakeholders were conducted, which revealed the benefits of the proposed approach. The multidimensional impacts of precision crop farming beyond measurable outcomes emphasize its potential to foster social cohesion and well-being in urban communities. Keywords: smart cities; artificial intelligence; urban agriculture; intelligent precision farming; irrigation sustainability 1. Introduction 1.1. Background on Precision Agriculture Precision agriculture has become an important strategy for the sustainable feeding of growing urban populations. However, efficiently cultivating food within space-constrained city environments requires innovative techniques to optimize limited land and resources. Precision agriculture, which utilizes data and technology to target interventions, shows promise if adapted for urban farming contexts. As urban spaces continue to expand, the integration of precision farming has emerged as a pioneering approach, representing a significant departure from traditional agricultural practices to more specialized, data-guided strategies. The main aim of precision farming within an urban context is to refine plot-level management concerning plant health and production efficiency. This is achieved through state-of-the-art technologies like satellite imaging, sensor technology, Global Positioning Systems (GPS), and data analytics, which help to monitor and regulate urban green spaces and crops more efficiently for the betterment of public health. Historically, decisions on irrigation, seed sowing times, and the quantity of fertilizer used in traditional farming were primarily based on human intuition and previous records. On the other hand, urban precision farming leverages real-time data to foster better decision making. This leads to enhanced productivity, improved sustainability, and reduced costs by applying the right treatments at the right time and place. To deepen our understanding of these novel practices, Table 1 comprehensively compares various agricultural methods, briefly summarizing the benefits and drawbacks of each technique. This valuable decision-making tool helps identify potential research areas for autonomous farm robots, especially within urban landscapes. Table 1. Comparison of different methods in agriculture. 1.2. Need for Sustainable Farming Practices The need for food is anticipated to increase significantly as the world population approaches 10 billion by 2050. This creates considerable hurdles for the agricultural industry, which is already under pressure from causes like climate change, water scarcity, and land degradation. Furthermore, conventional agricultural methods have frequently been linked to harmful environmental effects such as soil erosion, excessive water use, and pollution from pesticides and fertilizers. Figure 1 shows the evolution of agricultural machinery over time. Figure 1. Evolution of agricultural machinery. Therefore, addressing these issues requires the use of sustainable farming techniques. Sustainable agriculture aims to enhance food production without sacrificing the ability of future generations to meet their own needs. It encompasses a broad spectrum of ethical, socially responsible, and commercially successful actions. For instance, they reduce water waste through wise irrigation techniques while minimizing pollution through specific fertilizers and pesticides. 1.3. Introduction to Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) A sophisticated machine learning method, DRL, combines deep learning and reinforcement learning. Reinforcement learning is concerned with how agents should behave in an environment to maximize cumulative rewards, whereas deep learning is designed to handle high-dimensional data. In DRL, an agent gains decision-making skills through interaction with its surroundings. In contrast to supervised learning, where the model is trained on a dataset with labelled examples, an agent learns via feedback based on its behaviors in reinforcement learning. As it interacts with the environment, the agent gains rewards, and it aspires to increase the total of these rewards over time. Deep learning’s function is to make approximations of the mathematical formulae that calculate potential rewards or recommend the optimal course of action. DRL has succeeded in several fields, including autonomous driving, robotic control, and superhuman video game skill. DRL is exceptionally well suited to dynamic and unpredictable contexts like agriculture because of its capacity to manage complicated, high-dimensional environments. The main objective of this research is to investigate how Deep Reinforcement Learning may be incorporated into autonomous agricultural robots for adaptive seeding and water management. Our goal is to create a system that can make wise judgments in real time based on environmental variables by fusing precision agricultural concepts with the cutting-edge capabilities of DRL. This study focuses on implementing the Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) algorithm, a cutting-edge DRL method renowned for its sample efficiency and simplicity, in an autonomous agricultural robot outfitted with multiple sensors. The PPO algorithm uses these sensors’ vital information to decide upon the seed sowing depth, density, and irrigation schedules. This research lays the framework for a new generation of intelligent agricultural systems that can help address today’s food issues while advancing efficiency and sustainability in farming methods. Precision agriculture can be advanced by incorporating DRL into autonomous robots, making farms more productive and resistant to the difficulties presented by a changing global climate. The structure of this study begins with an introduction, moves through a literature review, a description of the Proximal Policy Optimization algorithm, a description of the robot design, an experimental setup, a performance evaluation, and ends with conclusions and recommendations. 2. Literature Review Autonomous agricultural robot development began in the late 20th century. According to [1,2,3], early agricultural robots mainly concentrated on straightforward tasks like weeding. Agricultural robots started employing increasingly advanced technologies, such as GPS, computer vision, and sensor technology, as technology advanced. There was a rush of research on the automation of harvesting procedures in the early 2000s. These studies developed robotics for the fresh fruit industry to automate fruit harvesting [4,5]. Agricultural robots have become more versatile over time as robotics and artificial intelligence (AI) have advanced. The necessity of giving agricultural robots various sensors and decision-making abilities was emphasized by [3]. More recently, in 2017, Duckett et al. introduced the idea of “Agricultural Robotics for the Real World”, examining various applications and the possible use of robotics in agriculture. Most traditional seed-sowing techniques involve physical work. Initially, it was common to scatter seeds by hand; later, row-sowing equipment like seed drills were created [4]. Decisions about the seed sowing depth and density were frequently based on experience and were, therefore, imprecise. Farming has always depended heavily on effective water management. When fields were flooded by water in the past, flood irrigation was frequently practiced [5]. This approach could be more effective. Technology led to the creation of sprinkler and drip irrigation systems. Although these techniques required manual intervention and decision-making, they were more effective. The ability of DRL to make decisions in complicated contexts has lately led to its use in agriculture. Refs. [6,7,8,9,10] explored deep learning’s multiple agricultural applications, such as in crop and weed detection. DRL was used by [7] to optimize irrigation scheduling. They created a DRL agent that considers the trade-off between crop productivity and water usage when learning how to irrigate an agricultural field. Similarly, ref. [8] suggested a DRL-based precision irrigation system, demonstrating significant water savings while preserving crop output. A DRL-based telepresence robot with the ability to maneuver around was discussed in detail in [9,10,11,12]. Table 2 shows the comparison of different published works related to smart and sustainable farming with the usage of different technologies, and the advantages and disadvantages of those technologies. Table 2. Comparison of different published works in the related field. Despite improvements in DRL and agricultural robotics, they have not yet been integrated for adaptive seed planting and water management. The majority of DRL implementations have concentrated on discrete activities like scheduling irrigation. Most of the potential of DRL in adaptive seed sowing, where the robot chooses the sowing depth and density in real time based on environmental circumstances, has yet to be thoroughly investigated. Additionally, there is a requirement for more complete systems that integrate different components like seeding, water management, and fertilizer management into a single autonomous robotic system. Through DRL, such systems can be equipped to make integrated decisions while concurrently considering several elements [18,19,20,21,22,23,24]. The need for the real-world testing and validation of these systems is another flaw. Although numerous studies include simulated environments, there are fewer cases of substantial real-world deployments, which is essential for comprehending real-world difficulties and limitations. Furthermore, creating algorithms that can effectively function with little data is required. The majority of DRL algorithms require data that may need to be more practical in some agricultural contexts, particularly in underdeveloped countries where data are scarce. It is also important to consider the practicality and scalability of agricultural robots built using DRL technology. Large-scale deployments need to be explored to comprehend these systems’ economic effects and scalability across many types of crops and diverse geographical regions. Even if the development of autonomous agricultural robots and the use of DRL in agriculture have advanced significantly, there is still a need to bridge the gap between these two by creating integrated systems. This integration should concentrate on real-world applicability, scalability, economic viability, and technological improvement. By creating an autonomous agricultural robot that uses DRL for adaptive seed sowing and water management, and deploying and evaluating the system in a real-world environment on a 1-acre test farm, our project intends to fill some of these gaps. Through this, we intend to open the door for further study and advancements in intelligent and sustainable precision agriculture. 3. Deep Reinforcement Learning 3.1. Overview of Deep Reinforcement Learning A branch of machine learning known as DRL combines deep learning and reinforcement learning (RL). The core tenet of RL is that agents operate in ways that maximize some sort of concept of cumulative reward. DRL develops this concept by approximating the functions required for difficult decision making using a neural network, as shown in Figure 2. Figure 2. DRL architecture and process. A set of states 𝑆 , a set of actions 𝐴 , and a policy, which is a mapping from states to actions, make up the basic context for RL: 𝜋: 𝑆 → 𝐴 . The agent interacts with environmental interaction by observing a state 𝑠 ∈ 𝑆 , acting 𝑎 ∈ 𝐴 , obtaining a reward r, and then changing to a new state 𝑠 ′ . Finding a policy that maximizes the predicted cumulative reward is the objective. The Q-function, which is designated as 𝑄(𝑠, 𝑎) and calculates the predicted cumulative reward of acting in state s and then following policy, is an essential part of RL. DRL uses deep neural networks to approximate the Q-function. Mathematically, the Q-function is defined by the Bellman equation in Equation (1): 𝑄(𝑠, 𝑎)=𝑟+𝛾𝑚𝑎𝑥(𝑄( 𝑠 ′ ,  𝑎 ′ )) (1) where 0 ≤ 𝛾 ≤ 1 is the discount factor. Here, 𝑚𝑎𝑥(𝑄( 𝑠 ′ ,  𝑎 ′ )) represents the maximum predicted reward that can be achieved from the next state 𝑠 ′ , considering all possible actions 𝑎 ′ in that state. This term is a key component of the Bellman equation used in reinforcement learning, specifically in the context of Q-learning. It encapsulates the idea of an agent (in this case, the agricultural robot) learning to predict the total amount of reward it can expect in the future, given its current state and action. In order to approximate the Q-function, 𝑄(𝑠, 𝑎; 𝜃) , DRL uses a neural network, which stands for the weights of the network. 𝑄(𝑠, 𝑎; 𝜃) is a function approximated by a neural network, where 𝜃 represents the network’s weights, that is used to predict the expected rewards for taking action 𝑎 in state 𝑠 , guiding the decision-making process of the agent. 3.2. Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) Algorithm A policy optimization technique in DRL called Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) aims to update the policy without making significant changes. Compared to other policy optimization techniques, it is distinguished as being more stable and effective with regard to sample complexity, as shown in Figure 3. PPO works in two stages: Figure 3. PPO working principle. First, by interacting with the environment while employing the present policy, data are gathered. Second, the policy is optimized by maximizing an objective function. With each update, the policy can vary excessively, hindering learning. The PPO algorithm explicitly solves this problem. This is accomplished by optimizing a surrogate objective-containing modification of the policy gradient objective function, as shown in Equation (2): 𝐿(𝜃)=𝑚𝑖𝑛(𝑟(𝜃) 𝐴 𝑎𝑑𝑣 , 𝑐𝑙𝑖𝑝(𝑟(𝜃),1−𝜀,1+𝜀)  𝐴 𝑎𝑑𝑣 ) (2) Here, 𝐴 𝑎𝑑𝑣 is the advantage function evaluating how good the action is compared to the average action; this function evaluates how much better an action is compared to the average action under the current policy. The advantage function is crucial in reinforcement learning as it helps to determine the relative quality of the actions taken by the agent. 𝜀 is a hyperparameter controlling how much the policy is permitted to change. 𝑟(𝜃) is the ratio of the probability of the action under the new and old policies. When incorporated into autonomous agricultural robots for adaptive seed planting and water management, PPO has various benefits in agricultural contexts. Sample Effectiveness: PPO is renowned for its sample effectiveness. Being able to make sense of few data is essential in agriculture because of the short growing season. Stability: By preventing the policy from shifting too much, the clipping in the objective function promotes more stable learning. This translates into long-term decision making that is trustworthy and consistent in the context of agriculture. Handling Continuous Action Spaces: Making decisions in agriculture, such as how much water to use for irrigation or how deep to plant seeds, must be performed continuously. PPO is well suited to making these kinds of decisions since it performs well in continuous action spaces. Real-time Decision Making: PPO’s effectiveness and stability make it capable of making judgments in real time, which is essential for adaptive water management and seed sowing, where conditions might change quickly due to the weather or other factors. Mathematically, these advantages can be crucial for optimizing the yield 𝑌 , given by Equation (3): 𝑌=𝑓(𝑋, 𝑊,𝑑, 𝑃) (3) Where 𝑋 represents the seed sowing density, 𝑊 is the amount of water utilized, 𝑑 is the sowing depth, and P is the policy (in this instance, PPO optimization). The objective is to maximize 𝑌 while considering the agricultural environment’s limitations and unique characteristics. PPO is particularly favourable for adaptive seed sowing and water management in agriculture; this is because it can integrate autonomous agricultural robots due to its sample efficiency, stability, competence in handling continuous action spaces, and real-time decision making. These benefits help to optimize important agricultural variables, resulting in higher yields and more environmentally friendly farming methods. 4. Autonomous Agricultural Robot 4.1. Robot Design and Components In this study, DRL is used in the multidimensional design of an autonomous agricultural robot focused on adaptive seed sowing and water management. Our robot, Agrorobotix, includes an intelligent decision-making system, a reliable mechanical structure, and sensor integration, as shown in Figure 4. Figure 4. Agrorobotix structure. The mechanical setup of Agrorobotix consists of a chassis, four wheels, four motors, a mechanism for drilling holes in the ground, a seed dropper, a flattener, and a watering system. The robot’s chassis, which serves as its main body, is strong enough to support its parts while it moves around an agricultural field. It houses the sensors, control unit, motors, battery, and other components required for autonomous operation. The robot has four wheels, each propelled by a different engine, as shown in Figure 5. This enhances the control of the movement, including rotation and navigating various terrains. A mathematical model of the motors is as follows, as described in Equation (4): 𝑇=𝑘(𝑉−𝑤𝑅) (4) Figure 5. Agrorobotix mechanism and working. 𝑘 is the motor constant, 𝑉 is the applied voltage, 𝑤 is the angular velocity, 𝑅 is the resistance, and 𝑇 is the torque. A motorized arm and a drill make up the drilling mechanism. The component can move vertically, enabling it to drill holes in the ground at different depths based on the information provided by the sensors. Let us use 𝑑 as the drilling depth, 𝑇 𝑑 for the torque needed for drilling, and 𝑃 𝑑 for the power required for drilling. They have a relationship that can be modelled as shown in Equations (5) and (6): 𝑇 𝑑 =𝐹𝑟 (5) 𝑃 𝑑 = 𝑇 𝑑 𝑑𝜔 (6) where 𝐹 is the applied force, and 𝑟 is the drill’s radius and 𝜔 is the angular velocity. The next step is attaching a seed dropper to the drilling mechanism. The seeds are carefully dropped into the drilled holes. The seed dropper system is set up to distribute seeds according to the DRL system’s predetermined intervals and dosages. The flattener, a component with a flat surface placed over the soil to ensure the seeds are adequately coated, performs this. Finally, the robot has a sprinkler system. The ideal amount of water will be provided over the sown area. The water flow rate 𝑄 can be computed as shown in Equation (7): 𝑄= 𝐴 𝑐𝑠 𝑣 (7) where 𝐴 𝑐𝑠 is the cross-sectional area of the flow and 𝑣 is the velocity of water. 4.2. Power Management To ensure that the Agrorobotix robot always has enough power to return to its base for recharging or maintenance, several strategies can be implemented as part of its energy management system. Here are some approaches used by Agrorobotix: Energy Monitoring System: Implement a real-time energy monitoring system that continuously tracks the robot’s power levels. This system alerts the robot when its energy levels drop below a predefined threshold, prompting it to return to the base for recharging. 2. Automated Recharging Stations: Set up automated recharging stations strategically in the field. The robot can autonomously dock and recharge when needed, minimizing downtime, and ensuring constant operational readiness. 3. Battery Health Management: Implement a battery health management system that monitors the battery condition, optimizes charging cycles, and prevents deep discharges, thereby extending the battery life and reliability. 4.3. Sensor Integration 4.3.1. Soil Moisture Sensors Agrorobotix incorporates soil moisture sensors to gauge the water in the soil. These are essential in letting the DRL system know if watering is required. The estimates for soil moisture are as described in Equation (8): 𝜃 𝑠𝑜𝑖𝑙 = ( 𝑚 𝑤𝑒𝑡 − 𝑚 𝑑𝑟𝑦 ) 𝑚 𝑑𝑟𝑦 (8) where 𝑚 𝑤𝑒𝑡   is the mass of the wet soil and 𝑚 𝑑𝑟𝑦 is the mass of dry soil. 4.3.2. Weather Sensors Weather sensors are crucial for detecting environmental factors like temperature, humidity, and rainfall. Making judgments on irrigation timing and the sowing depth require the use of this information. 4.3.3. Global Positioning System (GPS) The robot has a GPS module that enables precise field navigation. This is essential to ensuring that the robot follows the best courses for irrigation and sowing. The tuple (latitude, longitude) can indicate the robot’s position 𝑃 . The DRL system continuously receives data from various sensors and uses the PPO algorithm to make real-time decisions about the seed sowing depth, density, and irrigation. In this study, Agrorobotix, an autonomous agricultural robot using the newest sensors and Deep Reinforcement Learning technology, is painstakingly designed. Its sturdy construction and thoughtful decision-making capabilities enable adaptive seeding and water management, which promote more effective and sustainable agriculture methods. Agrorobotix’s advanced decision-making capabilities and structural robustness have received particular attention during development, as these are essential for adaptive seeding and water management. A key component of these capabilities is the integration of GPS technology. Thanks to this technology, Agrorobotix can move and position itself in the best possible ways to accomplish its tasks while accurately navigating a variety of agricultural landscapes. Because GPS enables accurate data collection and the execution of learned strategies in real-time field conditions, it is essential for the effective implementation of deep reinforcement learning algorithms. As a result, the system’s robust design, astute decision making, and accurate GPS-guided navigation work together to greatly improve agricultural practices’ sustainability and efficiency. 4.4. Integration of PPO in the Robot A key feature of Agrorobotix is the PPO algorithm, which enables the robot to make wise and adaptable decisions for seed sowing and water management in real time. The integration establishes the connection between the robot’s mechanical parts, the PPO algorithm, and its sensory inputs. 4.4.1. Data Acquisition and Preprocessing Data serve as the foundation for PPO. Agrorobotix has several sensors, including GPS, weather sensors, and soil moisture sensors. Let us denote the raw sensory data at time 𝑡 as 𝑆 𝑡 . These data need to be pre-processed to create the state space that will be used as input by the PPO algorithm. The state space, denoted as 𝑋 𝑡 , can be represented as a vector in Equation (9): 𝑋 𝑡 =[ 𝑠 𝑚𝑡 , 𝑠 𝑤𝑡 ,  𝑝 𝑡 ] (9) where 𝑠 𝑚𝑡 represents the soil moisture, 𝑠 𝑤𝑡 represents weather information (such as temperature, humidity), and 𝑝 𝑡 represents the robot’s position, obtained from GPS data. 4.4.2. Action Execution and Feedback The robot’s components are actuated per the action 𝐴 𝑡 selected by the PPO algorithm. For example, if 𝐴 𝑡 calls for sowing seeds at depth 𝑑 , the drilling machine would be activated to produce the holes at depth 𝑑 , the seed dropper would dispense the seeds, the flattener would cover the holes, and the sprinkler might be activated depending on the moisture levels. Let us denote the action space as 𝐴 𝑡 =[𝑑, 𝑛, 𝑤] , where 𝑑 represents the depth of seed sowing, 𝑛 represents the number of seeds, and 𝑤 represents the amount of water to be sprinkled. 4.4.3. Reward Calculation and Policy Update After executing the action, Agrorobotix observes the immediate reward 𝑅 𝑡 , which is a function of various factors such as the soil moisture, weather conditions, and seed sowing depth. The cumulative reward 𝐺 𝑡 is calculated as in Equation (10): 𝐺 𝑡 =𝛴 (𝛾^𝑖 ∗  𝑅 𝑡+𝑖 ) (10) where 0 ≤ 𝛾 ≤ 1 is the discount factor. The policy is updated using the collected rewards, and the process is repeated. Real-time Adaptation Agrorobotix gathers new data as it continues interacting with the environment, which are then used to update the policy. As a result, the PPO algorithm improves its decision making over time by adjusting to the surroundings. 4.4.4. Mathematical Optimization for Resource Consumption A secondary objective can be integrated into PPO to ensure minimal resource consumption. The robot can be optimized for the minimal use of water and energy. Minimize in Equation (11): 𝛴( 𝑤  𝑡 + 𝑒 𝑡 ) (11) Subject to Equation (12): 𝐺 𝑡 ≥𝑡ℎ𝑟𝑒𝑠ℎ𝑜𝑙𝑑 (12) where 𝑤  𝑡 is water consumption, and 𝑒 𝑡 is the energy consumption at time 𝑡 . In the context of Agrorobotix’s operations, the reward function 𝑅 𝑡 plays a pivotal role in guiding the robot’s learning and decision-making process. After executing an action 𝐴 𝑡 , such as sowing seeds or managing water, Agrorobotix calculates the immediate reward 𝑅 𝑡 . This reward is a multi-faceted function that incorporates several critical agricultural factors, including, but not limited to, the following: Soil Moisture: Agrorobotix measures the moisture level of the soil, aiming for an optimal range that ensures adequate water for the crops without over-irrigation. The closer the soil moisture is to this optimal range, the higher the reward 𝑅 𝑡   received. Weather Conditions: The algorithm considers current and forecasted weather conditions. Favourable weather that promotes healthy crop growth contributes positively to the reward. Seed Sowing Depth: The accuracy of the seed sowing depth, as per the agronomic standards for different crops, influences 𝑅 𝑡 . A precise sowing depth ensures better seed germination and contributes to a higher reward. The cumulative reward 𝐺 𝑡  is then calculated based on these immediate rewards over time, as outlined in Equation (10). This approach enables Agrorobotix to adapt its actions dynamically, aiming to maximize 𝐺 𝑡  by optimizing these key factors, thus ensuring efficient and sustainable agricultural practices. In general terms, processing sensory data to create a state space, using the PPO algorithm to choose actions, carrying out these actions using the robot’s mechanical parts, and changing the policy using the incentives earned are the steps involved in incorporating PPO into Agrorobotix. This makes it possible for Agrorobotix to modify its water management and seed-sowing plans in real time, resulting in higher yields and sustainability.

Then, the optimizer is initialized to adjust the policy parameters during training. In each iteration, the robot observes the state 𝑠 t from its sensors (soil moisture, weather sensors, GPS). The action 𝑎 t is selected based on the policy 𝜋( 𝑎 t | 𝑠 𝑡 ; 𝜃) and executed by the robot (drilling, sowing, flattening, and watering). The robot observes the immediate reward 𝑟 t and the new state 𝑠 t+1 . The advantage estimate 𝐴 t is computed, which represents how good the taken action is compared to the average action. The policy parameters 𝜃 are updated by optimizing the surrogate objective, which is a clipped version of the objective; this is to prevent policy updates that are too large. This process is repeated over multiple iterations and epochs for stable learning. 5. Experimental Setup 5.1. Description of the Test Farm The experimental setup was carried out on a test farm spanning an area of 1 acre, as shown in Figure 6. The farm is in a region of Faisalabad, Pakistan, with a temperate climate that is characterized by moderate rainfall and a growing season typically from early spring to late fall. The soil is loamy and has been traditionally used for growing a variety of crops including wheat, maize, and vegetables. The test farm was specifically chosen for its representativeness of typical agricultural conditions. The field experiments with Agrorobotix spanned over a period of 30 days, enabling comprehensive data collection and algorithm refinement. Figure 6. The 1-acre test farm. 5.2. Data Collection and Training Historical information about the farm, such as its weather patterns (temperature, humidity, and precipitation), soil moisture, and crop yield records, was gathered before the experiment began. Agrorobotix uses an array of sensors to gather these data, which form the basis of the algorithm’s decision-making process. Our autonomous agricultural robot, Agrorobotix, collected data in real time throughout the trial using its built-in sensors. Gazebo was used in the simulation environment to replicate the conditions on a farm. A high-fidelity model of Agrorobotix and the test farm were used in the simulation. The various environmental situations could be replicated using Gazebo, and the robot’s behaviours could be examined. Through a continuous feedback loop, the robot adapts its actions based on the outcomes of previous actions, enhancing its efficiency and accuracy over time. The collected data were pre-processed to be fed into the DRL model. The state space vector 𝑋 t is defined as described in Equation (13): 𝑋 t =[ 𝑠 𝑚𝑡 , 𝑠 𝑤𝑡 ,  𝑝 𝑡 ] (13) where 𝑠 𝑚𝑡 represents the soil moisture, 𝑠 𝑤𝑡 represents weather information, and 𝑝 𝑡 represents the robot’s position, which was obtained from GPS data. The PPO algorithm was employed as the DRL model, which was trained using both historical data and real-time data collected from Gazebo simulations. The objective was to maximize the cumulative reward 𝐺 𝑡 . The learning curves for these tasks are given in Figure 7. During training, we simulated an Agrorobotix in parallel for each sampling and collected, in total, a thousand time steps for each task. The policy 𝜋(𝜃) was modified iteratively through epochs, and the training continued until convergence. Figure 7. Learning curve of PPP for Agrorobotix. Following training, Agrorobotix was used on the test farm’s 1-acre property. Its primary responsibilities included water management and adaptive seed sowing. As instructed by the PPO algorithm, the robot used its drilling machine to create holes, seed droppers, flatteners to level the field, and sprinklers to water the crops. It was crucial to adjust the model with actual-world data while Agrorobotix moved through the test farm. The robot functioned at the test farm throughout two growing seasons and continuously adjusted its irrigation and seeding policies. The model tuned itself to the test farm’s actual environmental conditions and limits, as shown in Figure 8. Figure 8. Agrorobotix working in 1-acre test farm. The crop yield and water use were the two main criteria for assessing Agrorobotix’s performance. Water use was calculated in liters, while crop production and the shoot length in particular were calculated in centimeters. The crop production and water usage of Agrorobotix were compared to traditional farming methods to examine the results. The effectiveness and advantages of using a Deep Reinforcement Learning-based strategy in agriculture were established through this comparison. PPO’s integration into Agrorobotix and implementation on the test farm produced positive outcomes. The robot could manage water resources and plant seeds flexibly and efficiently. The experimental set-up that combined physical and virtual settings greatly honed and tested Agrorobotix’s performance in actual agricultural situations. The use of autonomous robots and deep reinforcement learning offers a significant step towards sustainable and effective farming practices. 6. Results and Discussion In this study, the ‘conventional’ method refers to traditional agricultural practices, which typically include manual labor and basic mechanization without advanced automation or data-driven decision-making systems. This method has been optimized based on standard agricultural practices, which involve routine watering and fertilization schedules, regular pest control measures, and traditional soil management techniques. These practices serve as a benchmark for comparing the efficiency and effectiveness of the Agrorobotix system in enhancing sustainable agriculture. 6.1. Comparison with Conventional Farming Techniques 6.1.1. Crop Yield One of the essential metrics in this study is the crop yield, which directly impacts the efficiency and sustainability of agricultural practices. The crop yield was quantified as the total shoot length of crops produced per unit seed, as shown in Figure 9. Let us denote the crop yield using Agrorobotix as 𝑌 𝑟 and the crop yield using conventional farming techniques as 𝑌 𝑐 , as shown in Equation (14). 𝑌 𝑟 =𝑇𝑜𝑡𝑎𝑙 𝑙𝑒𝑛𝑔𝑡ℎ 𝑜𝑓 𝑐𝑟𝑜𝑝𝑠 𝑝𝑟𝑜𝑑𝑢𝑐𝑒𝑑 𝑝𝑒𝑟 𝑢𝑛𝑖𝑡 𝑠𝑒𝑒𝑑 𝑏𝑦 𝐴𝑔𝑟𝑜𝑟𝑜𝑏𝑜𝑡𝑖𝑥 (𝑐𝑚/𝑠𝑒𝑒𝑑)  𝑌 𝑐 =𝑇𝑜𝑡𝑎𝑙 𝑙𝑒𝑔𝑡ℎ 𝑜𝑓 𝑐𝑟𝑜𝑝𝑠 𝑝𝑟𝑜𝑑𝑢𝑐𝑒𝑑 𝑝𝑒𝑟 𝑢𝑛𝑖𝑡 𝑠𝑒𝑒𝑑 𝑏𝑦 𝑐𝑜𝑛𝑣𝑒𝑛𝑡𝑖𝑜𝑛𝑎𝑙 𝑓𝑎𝑟𝑚𝑖𝑛𝑔 (𝑐𝑚/𝑠𝑒𝑒𝑑) (14) Figure 9. Shoot length in (a) 0 month, (b) 1st month, (c) 2nd month and (d) 3rd month. According to the results, there was a 16.3% increase in shoot length with the use of Agrorobotix, as shown in Equation (15): ( 𝑌 𝑟 − 𝑌 𝑐 .)/ 𝑌 𝑐 . ∗ 100=16.3% (15) This can also be visualized through the graph in Figure 10: Figure 10. Shoot length comparison of Agrorobotix and conventional method. 6.1.2. Water Usage Another critical metric is the water usage, which is crucial for sustainable agriculture. Let us denote the water usage using Agrorobotix as 𝑊 𝑟 and the water usage using conventional farming techniques as 𝑊 𝑐 , as shown in Equation (16): 𝑊 𝑟 =𝑇𝑜𝑡𝑎𝑙 𝑤𝑎𝑡𝑒𝑟 𝑐𝑜𝑛𝑠𝑢𝑚𝑒𝑑 𝑝𝑒𝑟 𝑢𝑛𝑖𝑡 𝑎𝑟𝑒𝑎 𝑏𝑦 𝐴𝑔𝑟𝑜𝑟𝑜𝑏𝑜𝑡𝑖𝑥 (𝑙𝑖𝑡𝑒𝑟𝑠/𝑎𝑐𝑟𝑒)  𝑊 𝑐 =𝑇𝑜𝑡𝑎𝑙 𝑤𝑎𝑡𝑒𝑟 𝑐𝑜𝑛𝑠𝑢𝑚𝑒𝑑 𝑝𝑒𝑟 𝑢𝑛𝑖𝑡 𝑎𝑟𝑒𝑎 𝑏𝑦 𝑐𝑜𝑛𝑣𝑒𝑛𝑡𝑖𝑜𝑛𝑎𝑙 𝑓𝑎𝑟𝑚𝑖𝑛𝑔 (𝑙𝑖𝑡𝑒𝑟𝑠/𝑎𝑐𝑟𝑒) (16) According to the results, there was a 21.7% reduction in water usage with the use of Agrorobotix, as described in Equation (17): ( 𝑊 𝑐 − 𝑊 𝑟 )/ 𝑊 𝑐  ∗ 100=21.7% (17) This can also be visualized through the bar graph in Figure 11: Figure 11. Comparison of water usage when using Agrorobotix and conventional method. 6.2. Insights and Implications The results demonstrate that Deep Reinforcement Learning increases crop productivity while reducing water use in an autonomous agricultural robot. The graphs and mathematical model show that Agrorobotix performs better than conventional agricultural methods. The DRL model’s reward improvement demonstrates how the robot can grow intelligent and acquire sound judgement. Adaptation is crucial in agriculture since environmental conditions can be unpredictable. During field trials, a number of operational parameters were evaluated in order to determine the usefulness and effectiveness of Agrorobotix in agricultural settings. These parameters include the average speed at which the robot operates and the total amount of time needed to finish typical agricultural tasks on a field of one acre. Agrorobotix was entrusted with a number of standard farming tasks during these trials, including planting, watering, and crop health monitoring. The mean velocity of the robot was measured, taking into account different kinds of terrain and operational circumstances. Agrorobotix’s operational performance across a range of agricultural tasks is summarised in Figure 12. The robot’s average speed, which ranges from 3 to 4 km/h, is shown on the left for tasks like watering, seeding, and crop monitoring. These velocities are designed to strike a balance between effectiveness and the dexterity needed for fine farming tasks. Agrorobotix’s time efficiency is demonstrated by the graph on the right, which shows how long it takes to finish each task on a one-acre field. The durations, which vary from 5 to 7 h, demonstrate the robot’s ability to complete tasks quickly, possibly lowering labour hours and increasing the overall productivity of the farm. This information highlights how Agrorobotix is used in the field in a way that is consistent with sustainable farming methods and precision agriculture. Figure 12. Agrorobotix: speed and time metrics for farming tasks on a 1-acre field. Figure 13 illustrates a comparison between the chemical usage of traditional farming methods and those employed with Agrorobotix. The bar chart clearly shows a 33% reduction in chemical usage when utilizing Agrorobotix’s precision application system, as indicated by the decrease from 100% (representing the baseline chemical usage in traditional methods) to 67%. This significant reduction underscores the benefits of efficiency and sustainability offered by Agrorobotix in agricultural practices. Figure 13. Chemical usage comparison: traditional vs. Agrorobotix. A comparative study was conducted to validate the algorithm’s soil moisture estimation against traditional methods. This involved performing parallel measurements over the experimental period, demonstrating the algorithm’s precision. The graph in Figure 14 compares the soil moisture estimation over a 30-day period using the Deep Learning Reinforcement (DLR) algorithm implemented in Agrorobotix with traditional methods. The blue line represents the soil moisture levels as estimated by the DLR algorithm, while the green line illustrates the estimates obtained through traditional methods. This visual representation offers a clear comparison of the two approaches, demonstrating the DLR algorithm’s ability to accurately estimate soil moisture over an extended period, which is crucial for informed and efficient agricultural practices. Figure 14. Soil moisture estimation: DRL algorithm vs. traditional methods (30 days). The results of this study indicate that autonomous robots may revolutionise agricultural practices. Such robots can tackle some of agriculture’s most serious issues, such as resource optimisation and sustainability, by making data-driven decisions. Additionally, as technology advances, the capabilities and application of these robots may be enhanced, ushering in a new era of precise and sustainable agriculture. The findings of this study serve as a basis for further investigation and development in the fields of agricultural robotics and artificial intelligence. 7. Conclusions In conclusion, this research article shows that implementing new sustainable irrigation methods improves crop farming and reduces water consumption. The potential of Agrorobotix to transform urban agriculture is demonstrated by its integration into smart city frameworks. Agrorobotix makes a substantial contribution to the sustainability and efficiency of urban farming practices, which are essential to the creation of smart cities, by utilizing cutting-edge AI and robotics. By maximizing the utilization of resources to minimize environmental effects and improve food security in urban areas, this system is in line with the smart city objective; as a result, the Agrorobotix system has shown that integrating deep reinforcement learning into autonomous agricultural robots provides significant advantages for adaptive seed sowing and water management. The Agrorobotix design prioritizes water sustainability, but it also makes a major contribution to effective land management and the optimization of fertilizer usage. Agrorobotix guarantees sustainable resource utilization beyond water conservation by carefully dousing fertilizers and monitoring soil health. The outcomes of considerable experimentation and comparison with traditional farming methods reveal significant benefits. Crop yield rose by an average of 16.3%, outpacing conventional techniques and boosting food production. Additionally, the Agrorobotix system’s deployment led to a stunning 21.7% decrease in water usage, successfully addressing the significant problem of resource conservation. These figures highlight the enormous potential for enhancing agricultural practices using deep reinforcement learning algorithms, particularly the Proximal Policy Optimization algorithm. The Agrorobotix system provides a sustainable and effective solution for modern agriculture, opening the way for higher production and environmental stewardship by intelligently optimizing seed sowing and water management procedures. This study also qualitatively assessed the broader implications of AI-enabled precision farming. Interviews with the farmers and stakeholders were conducted, which revealed the benefits of the proposed approach. Acknowledging Agrorobotix’s limitations, like terrain navigation difficulties and maintenance needs, we plan to explore these areas in future work to enhance the practical applicability and operational efficiency of agricultural robotics. The multidimensional impacts of precision crop farming beyond its measurable outcomes emphasize its potential to foster social cohesion and well-being in urban communities.

However, the global agricultural landscape is rapidly evolving, presenting both unprecedented challenges and exciting opportunities. As the world's population continues to surge towards an estimated 9.7 billion by 2050, the demand for food, fiber, and bioenergy is intensifying [1, 2]. This surge in demand, coupled with the increasingly volatile climate and resource constraints, necessitates a profound transformation in how we practice agriculture. The answer to this challenge lies in the convergence of cutting-edge technologies, notably Artificial Intelligence (AI) and the Internet of Things (IoT), which collectively form the bedrock of what is now known as “Smart Agriculture” or “Precision Agriculture” [3,4,5,6,7,8]. Smart Agriculture represents a paradigm shift from traditional farming methods to a data-driven, interconnected, and intelligent approach to cultivation. It harnesses the power of AI, data analytics, automation, and IoT to optimize agricultural processes, conserve resources, enhance crop yields, and mitigate environmental impacts [8,9,10,11,12]. This chapter embarks on a journey into the realm of AI and smart technologies within the context of agriculture. It explores how these technologies are reshaping the agricultural landscape, from the vast fields of staple crops to the intricate networks of urban vertical farms. It examines the key applications of AI and smart technologies in precision farming, highlights real-world case studies of their implementation, and considers the implications for farmers, consumers, and the environment. In an age where information is a critical resource, the fusion of AI and agriculture represents a pivotal moment in human history. It offers the promise of feeding a burgeoning global population sustainably, reducing the ecological footprint of agriculture, and enhancing the resilience of food systems in the face of climate change. Yet, it also raises questions about data security, privacy, and equitable access to these transformative technologies. As we embark on this exploration of AI and smart technologies in agriculture, we must recognize that we are at the cusp of a new agricultural revolution. The seeds of innovation have been sown, and it is our responsibility to nurture this burgeoning field to ensure a greener, more abundant, and more technologically advanced future of agriculture [13,14,15]. “Precision agriculture is an approach to farm management that uses information technology (IT) to ensure that crop and soil receive exactly wat they need for optimum health and productivity. The goal of PA is to ensure profitability, sustainability and protection of the environment” (Fig. 1).

Modern farming has involved since the day of horse/bullock drawn plough. According to Taro Mieno, Assistant Professor, Department of agriculture and economics, university of Nebraska. Lincoln, dedicated research worker showed the impact of adopting precision technology on farms. Mieno’s research focuses specifically on how precision agriculture technologies impact profitability for farmers. PA recognizes the diversity of characteristics within a field through technology. Some examples of precision agriculture include drones, Global Positioning system (GPS) and irrigation technologies [13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20]. The goal of precision agriculture is to learn new management practices to increase the profitability of agricultural production. Therefore, it is necessary to develop low-cost technologies, so that the farmers of developing countries may also be benefited by high level technologies. 2 Types of Precision Agriculture Precision AG’s editor Eric sfiligoy has prepared a list of the top 10 technologies that are shaping precision precision agriculture today. Most involve some level of robotics, navigation, sensors and variable rate dispensing (Fig. 2). Fig. 2 Precision agricultural cycle Full size image 1. GPS/GNSS: Its hard to tell exactly where the state of precision agriculture today would be without GPS-literally. From virtually movement agriculture gained access to position locating satellites in the 1990’s, operators and manufactures have found out various ways to the tie into the tools to make managing field work much easier and accurate. In North America and Europe, grower can turn on the tractors and get to work almost immediately, says T.J.Schulte, marketing manager for trimble agriculture Division. Looking beyond these caopabilities, experts say that satellite technology is truly deserving of its “global” monitor. “No longer can we refer to all these system as GPS-that is not an accurate description when referring to new global Navigation Satellite system (GNSS) receiver technology today”. Instead, Grey Guyette adds GNSS covers all countries satellite con stellations including GPS, GLONASS and Galileo [21,22,23] (Fig. 3). Fig. 3 GPS Full size image 2. Mobile Devices: After figuring out where PA stands on the planets, the next most important innovation these past 20 year would have to be the development of mobile devices. “Without the cell phone, we probably would still be sitting in barn a lot, waiting for someone to come to the barn and make things work”, Says Reifsteck. Today, cell phone has morphed into a whole host of useful mobile devices including smatphone and tablets. As of 2016, most precision agriculture manufactures that dabble in the mobile devices market have spent most of their time trying to expand the capabilities these products can offer to users. According to Dr. M. Barnes “if you cannot get your technical data to work for the farmers within first 20 min after he receives it, he is probably never going to use it”. Robotics: Robots are taking on making many tasks in agriculture these days, including planting greenhouse crops and pruning vineyards. In a different approach, the Fendt MARS (Mobile Agriculture Robot Swarms) project utilizers small corn seeding robots that are lightweight, energy efficient, highly agile, cloud controlled and operated from tablet app [24,25,26,27]. Irrigation: Innovations in precision agriculture technologies are growing even more crucial as growers face water scarcity due t drought, aquifer depletion and water allocations. Adoption with valley irrigation, products now allow growers to remotely monitor, and control nearly facet of their irrigation operations. The system save water. Timely, fuel and wear and tear on the vehicles. In the future, Compbell says producers will be integrating soil moisture monitoring, weather data and variable- rate irrigation (VRI) inti their system. Internet of Things: One of the newest buzzwords to hit precision over the past few of years is the “Internet of things” (IOT). Simply defined, it’s the concept of connecting any device with an on/off switch to the internet. This network of connected things could also include people with wearable devices. Most recently, a few ag startups and components suppliers (hardware, software etc.) are using LPWANs (Low Power wide Area Network) in place of or to augment cellular networks in wireless data transmission. These networks are designed to carry small amounts of data transmitted intermittently over long ranges” says Paul Welbig [28]. Sensors: In precision agriculture, wireless sensors are used to collect data on a variety of factors, including soil water availability, soil compaction, soil fertility, leaf temperature, leaf area index, plant water status, local climatic data, insect-disease-weed infestation, and more. The management of water uses some of the most cutting-edge and varied technology now available. The growing control of water consumption across the country, as well as the shortage of water, will continue to be the driving force for advancements in this field [29]. Variable Rate seeding: It might come as a surprise to learn that variable-rate application (VRA) seeding is included on this list, considering all of the new and interesting technology for precision agriculture that are included. There is not much of a difference between it and variable rate fertiliser, because VRA sowing depends on your capacity to put together precise data for the seed itself, which is the beginning of the agricultural process [30,31,32] (Fig. 4). Fig. 4 Weather modelling Full size image When you go into the majority of the country's agricultural retail establishments, there is a good possibility that you will find some form of weather tracker on display. There is perhaps no other variable that is both as significant and as unpredictably vital as the weather. However, assistance is on its way. “Over the past 25 years, you’ve gotten a lot of important technologies developed that would be even more valuable with quality weather modelling, but we are now at a point where assuring good crop yields is key to making certain the world has food solutions that works”, says Jeff Kaiser, Vice President, Iteris. As an illustration of this, consider the case of a potato planter in the Northern Plains who discovered that harvesting his crop at a particular temperature was essential to preserving the crop's quality and consistency. “But by using clear Ag, this grower was able to take all their soil reading remotely and he was able to accomplish his harvest a lot more efficiently than even before” [33,34,35,36]. Nitrogen Modelling: The fertilizer have been used in forms of variable rate for decades, nitrogen modelling has become pronounced recently. “Our clientele has been using variable rate technologies for fertilizer applications Since the mid 1990s”, says Matt waits, CEO for SST software. “However, the complexity of the N-cycle and how it is in a constant state of fux has always made managing nitrogen difficult”. A recent partnership between SST software and agronomic technology Corp (ATC) resulted in the introduction of Adopt-N. Adopt-N was initially presented to the public in 2014, and according to Steve Sibulkin, Chief Executive Officer of ATC, it is rapidly becoming into an essential instrument for effectively regulating the utilization of nitrogen. The overwhelming majority of farmers desire an easy-to-implement solution that will allow them to handle these issues (Fig. 5). Fig. 5 Controlled release micronutrient fertilizer for precision farming Full size image Standardization: Initial efforts to implement this began almost eight years ago with the founding of the agriculture industry electronic foundation. Equipment manufacturers’ components, mainly those that adhere to the ISOBUS standard, continue to make their way into official circulation. More than 170 businesses, associations, and other types of organisations are currently part of the group and are actively working together to ensure that the standards are effective. However, industry players who have to deal with equipment compatibility “ On the ground” continue to be unhappy, and third party tech specialists frequently have difficulty managing items from rival providers. It is a lot better than it was, but it is still a significant problem. There will come a day, ideally, when components will get to the point where they are pretty much plug-and-play. It’s interesting to know that Precision Agriculture sure drive system today have wireless sensors together data on soil availability, Compaction, infertility and other data [37,38,39]. 3 Precision Agriculture’s Role in the New Era of the Farm Land Sector. The new generation of Agriculture systems addresses climate change adaptation alongside investor’s usual goals of improving yield and reducing costs. Precision farming refers to the precise application of agricultural inputs with respect to soil, weather as well as to crop need in order to improve productivity, quality and profitability in agriculture. Hence, precision agriculture is about going the right thing, in the right place, in the right way at the right [40]. 3.1 Advantages of Precision Farming It did this by increasing agricultural productivity and halting soil deterioration on areas suitable for cultivation, which led to further agricultural advancement. It will result in a reduction in the excessive use of chemicals in agricultural production. Precision farming allows for more effective use of available water resources. Agricultural fields may be surveyed more easily with the use of GPS. Additionally, the yield as well as the features of the soil may be plotted. The dissemination of knowledge on agricultural methods, with the goals of improving crop quality and quantity while simultaneously lowering production costs. Through the optimization of agrochemical products, it lessens the threat to the environment, in particular with regard to the leaching of nitrates and the poisoning of groundwater. It enhances the possibilities for better resource management, which in turn helps to decrease the number of resources that are wasted. An undulated field may be subdivided into smaller plots according to the specific needs of the individual customers. 3.2 Disadvantages of Precision Farming Farmers may be dissuaded from adopting this style of farming due to the high initial investment required. Techniques for precision farming are still in the process of being developed and require the advise of specialists before they can be put into practise. It is possible that it will take several years before sufficient data is collected to really deploy the system in its entirety. It is a very challenging endeavor, particularly the gathering of data and the interpretation of the results. 3.3 How Could India Benefit from Precision Farming? A decrease in the cost of production, an increase in productivity, and a more efficient use of natural resources may all be achieved in India through the development, refinement, and wider deployment of precision agricultural technology. It has the potential to completely transform the way farms are managed in modern India. As a result of improvements in profitability, productivity, sustainability, crop quality, environmental protection, on-farm quality of life, food safety, and rural economic growth. Application of site-specific irrigation in wheat grown in Punjab and Haryana, use of site-specific herbicides in cotton, and application of site-specific fertilizers in oil palm plantation in south India, as well as coffee and tea gardens in eastern India. India is able to significantly lower manufacturing costs, as well as lower production expenses, and lower the amount of chemicals that are loaded into the environment [41]. When there are limited amounts of water available, it can improve the efficiency of the irrigation system. In addition to this, it offers new instruments for the evaluation of multifunctional features, such as those that do not involve the market, and it expands job chances for those with specialized training in the agriculture industry. The farmer may utilize the prediction to prevent issues like as water stress, nutritional inadequacy, and pest and disease infestation. The state of greenhouses in agricultural areas may be monitored by it, which is an important function it plays. 4 Challenges in Adopting Precision Farming in India 1. The implementation of PA in India is still in the preliminary stages as a result of the country's distinctive pattern of land ownership, its inadequate infrastructure, the reluctance of farmers to take risks, as well as the country's social, economic, and demographic circumstances. 2. The majority of Indian agriculture is conducted on very tiny plots of land, which restricts the economic improvements that may be made with the precision farming equipment that is now available. 4.1 The War Forward New windows of opportunity for the implementation of precision farming are opening up in India as a result of the rapid socioeconomic shifts that include economic growth, urbanization, and increased energy consumption. Instead of blindly adopting the advanced precision agriculture technologies adopted by developed countries, India should adopt technologies based on the need of socio-economic condition of the country (IAS express-2022). 5 How Precision Agriculture in India is Adopted According to Rashika Solomon (2020), the agriculture is backbone of India’s economy, which accounts for 18% of India’s gross domestic product (GDP) and hires about half of the countries workforce. More than 70% of rural families depend on agriculture for their livelihood. The implementation of forward-thinking agricultural practises such as precision agriculture is a viable option for accomplishing this objective. The PA is an integrated crop management system that monitors the agricultural field at ground level using remote sensing (RS), global positioning system (GPS), and geographical information system (GIS). Recording and mapping the variations in crop and soil parameters that are present within a field is done. Following this, management decisions are made based on the findings of ongoing assessments of the spatial variability within the given field. In India, it is referred to as the efficient use of agricultural inputs in order to achieve higher levels of crop output (Gunnamreddy, 2022). 6 Conclusion Technologies that enable precision agriculture are playing an increasingly important part in the production of food crops. PA, For example, a guiding system for tractors that uses GPS. The use of global positioning system (GPS) technology for mapping soil and yield as well as variable-rate input applications helps farmers collect information on the changing field condition so that production techniques may be adjusted. Soil mapping, a similar precision technique, provides farmers with additional data that they can really use. When creating soil maps, more soil samples are collected, and zones are used to depict the different soil types, nitrate levels, and pH acidity readings. GPS is used by farmers to plot yield maps and data on maps in synchronisation with one another. Nevertheless, soil maps have a lot of practical applications since they display properties of the ground that are likely to be consistent from year to year. Finally, variable rate input application technology (VRT) enables farmers to tailor the application of fertiliser, chemicals, and pesticides by making use of GPS data, which is often derived from yield and soil maps. The adoption of PA in India depends on the pressure of population which is growing rapidly and more than 65% are directly employed by agricultural system. Therefore, it is of the utmost importance to modernize conventional agricultural techniques and be ready for an impending technological revolution in order to build an environmentally friendly system for increasing crop yield. The implementation of forward-thinking agricultural practices such as precision agriculture is a viable option for accomplishing this objective. PA is an integrated crop management system that monitors the agricultural field at ground level using remote sensing (RS), global positioning systems (GPS), and geographic information systems (GIS). Recording and mapping the differences in crop or soil qualities that are present within a field is done. In India, it is known as the exact exploitation of agricultural inputs to discover improved crop output by utilizing precision agriculture. This is done in an effort to improve food security.

It serves as a source of sustenance and provides employment opportunities for people. Farmers carefully choose the most suitable crop for their land by considering yield comparisons based on price, market demand, selling price, cultivation budget, and crop production range [1]. Once the crop is selected, the next step in the agricultural process is land preparation, which involves adding fertilizer to maintain optimal soil fertility and minimize the impact of crop diseases. It also entails designing the irrigation system based on the land layout. The subsequent stage is seed selection, which considers price, quantity, and water requirements specific to the area. Seed selection aims to enhance yield and improve the crop’s disease resistance [2]. The fifth step in the crop farming cycle is irrigation, which ensures that the crop receives adequate water and is conducted promptly to support growth until harvest. Crop growth is a crucial aspect of the farming cycle and encompasses monitoring overall crop development [3]. Farmers monitor fertilizer deployment, compare crop growth with expected outcomes, and take pre-emptive measures against diseases. The final stage is harvesting, which entails harvesting the crop at the optimal time and using appropriate methods or machinery suitable for the specific crop type. All these steps are vital for cultivating a healthy crop. Traditional agricultural methods often neglect the importance of these steps, resulting in suboptimal crop yields. Several technologies emerged in agriculture to enhance crop productivity. In this work, we propose an IoT-driven approach to optimize the fertilization. 1.1 Fertilization Fertilization is the process of applying fertilizers to enrich the nutrient composition of the soil. Fertilization plays a vital role in stimulating the growth of crops and increasing overall production. Farmers utilize fertilizers to improve soil productivity and quality. Fertilizers, whether obtained from natural or synthetic sources, can take the form of organic or inorganic substances. Their primary function is to be applied to the soil, delivering vital nutrients to plants [4]. These nutrients are available in significant amounts or in a form that plants can readily utilize. In agriculture, fertilizers are categorized into bio-fertilizers and chemical fertilizers [5]. Bio-fertilizers use organic waste and other biological agents to enhance soil fertility. At the same time, chemical fertilizers consist of the primary nutrients Nitrogen, Phosphorous, and Potassium (NPK) and secondary nutrients such as Magnesium, Calcium, and Sulfur. Fertilization Techniques: Numerous techniques are employed for fertilization. However, in traditional fertilization methods, farmers often lack awareness of the specific nutrient requirements of the soil. Consequently, fertilizers are applied without consideration of the soil's nutrient composition. The farmers cannot accurately assess the levels of critical nutrients such as Nitrogen, Phosphorous, and Potassium (NPK) in the ground. As a result, the quantity of fertilizer applied may lead to either over-fertilization or under-fertilization of the area. Issues with existed fertilization techniques: Lack of farmer awareness regarding the precise role of fertilizers in crop production. Crop damage from excessive fertilizer application affects the plants’ health and increases productivity. Time and labor-intensive nature of the traditional fertilization methods. Imbalanced soil nutrient levels, particularly with respect to Nitrogen, Phosphorous, and Potassium (NPK), leading to compromised crop quality and reduced yield. 1.2 IoT in Agriculture IoT, an emergent technology, facilitates the interconnection of intelligent devices via the Internet. It creates a global network that links various instruments to achieve specific goals [6]. IoT, utilizing multiple technologies, enhances convenience and comfort in daily life. Its applications extend to numerous fields, including intelligent agriculture [7], smart cities [8], smart homes [9], innovative business solutions [10], health care [10], intelligent vehicles, and sports and leisure activities [11]. Integrating IoT technology into traditional agriculture has increased intelligent agriculture [12]. Smart agriculture employs smart control and decision-making devices that enable timely and accurate decision-making. This approach ensures efficient resource allocation by supplying water and fertilizers based on demand, thereby minimizing resource wastage and maintaining soil fertility levels. The adoption of modern techniques in agriculture aims to enhance crop quality and production. IoT has transformed agriculture into precision agriculture and micro-agriculture [13]. Precision agriculture involves implementing site-specific management systems for crops [14]. It focuses on maximizing agricultural output while minimizing resource inputs [15]. In precision agriculture, digital technology, remote sensing, global positioning systems (GPS), and IoT are utilized to optimize farming practices and reduce costs. Smart farming automates various farming tasks and reduces the need for human intervention. Traditional agriculture has evolved into precision agriculture with the integration of IoT technology [16]. IoT applications in agriculture include soil monitoring systems [17], smart farming [18], intelligent irrigation systems [19], and the supply of fresh agricultural products [20]. IoT-enabled e-agriculture applications effortlessly provide real-time information, benefiting rural farmers and reducing human workload. One such application is smart farming, which combines agriculture and IoT technologies. Agri-IoT is a framework designed to assist farmers by providing timely information about farm conditions and potential risks, enabling them to protect their crops from damage [18]. 2 Related Work In recent years, the agriculture field has witnessed the emergence of various techniques aimed at enhancing productivity and improving crop quality. Several of these techniques are discussed in this section. Khelifa et al. have introduced an intelligent irrigation system utilizing IoT technology [19]. This system is specifically designed to conserve water resources in Algeria and contribute to the country's agricultural economy. Addressing the challenges faced by farmers, Mohanraj et al. have developed an automated agriculture field monitoring system [17]. The model encompasses various components: knowledge acquisition, comprehension, analysis, knowledge base, and the crop selection phase. Lee et al. have introduced an IoT-based agriculture production system [21]. In the pursuit of enhancing crop quality and productivity, Marie and Rosman have developed a model for detecting NPK levels using an optical transducer [12]. Ryu et al. reported an IoT-based connected farm for an intelligent farming system [22]. The design incorporates sensors and controllers that utilize the Internet via platforms like Cube and Mobius to collect data. With the help of a smartphone application, farmers can remotely control various aspects of their farm, including water supply, nutrient levels, ventilation, cover usage, and LED lighting. Haghverdi et al. have introduced a site-specific water production function (WPF) [23]. This system utilizes techniques such as neural networks, k-nearest neighbor, and linear regression to design and evaluate the WPF. P and Mahalakshmi have proposed an IoT-driven field monitoring and automated irrigation system, which is specifically designed for areas with low water levels [24]. Sensors monitor the crop field and transmit data to web servers using wireless transmission. Farmers receive periodic notifications on their mobile devices, allowing them to monitor the condition of their crops from anywhere. To improve soil fertility, Wang et al. have introduced a precision irrigation–fertilization controller system [25]. This system manages the pH concentration by mixing water to maintain the desired level. To overcome the challenges related to scalability and compatibility of IoT devices, Cambra et al. have introduced a novel IoT-based agriculture monitoring system [26]. The system utilizes a service-oriented architecture (SOA) with a standardized interface (LoRa by Lora Alliance) for device communication. In farming, Bhowmick et al. have introduced an IoT-enabled innovative agriculture application [27]. Further, the fertilization issues are resolved using a low-cost IoT-based fertilizer notification system [16]. The NPK sensor, designed with colorimetric principles using LDR and LED, is connected to a microcontroller unit for NPK value analysis. Dewi and Chen have created a decision-making system that relies on IoT data collection [28]. This system effectively utilizes IoT devices to gather localized data on crucial parameters such as soil moisture, temperature, humidity, water level, and light intensity. Das et al. have presented an intelligent agricultural system using IoT in India [29]. This system focuses on mitigating crop loss during harvesting and post-harvest stages by incorporating several sensors (soil moisture, temperature, humidity, E-nose motion, and pest sensors) with the Raspberry Pi model. For optimizing fertilizer recommendations, Premashudha and Leena have introduced an IoT-enabled solution [30]. The DSS utilizes cloud web GIS servers, mobile applications, and kiosk systems. Joshi and Goudar have introduced an IoT-based automated solution [31]. This system enables farmers to control electric water motors using their Android phones, providing convenience and reducing dependency on electricity for irrigation. Pandithurai et al. have presented the digital monitoring of soil and crops using IoT in the Agro-Tech system [32]. This system combines IoT applications with traditional agricultural techniques. Kamienski et al. have developed an intelligent water management system for precision irrigation [33]. Mucherino et al. have incorporated data mining techniques into the agricultural field [34]. The k-means clustering algorithm is utilized in wine fermentation to group apples into clusters based on their growth patterns. It facilitates classification as good or bad for further fermentation. 3 IoT-Based System for Fertilizer Detection The proposed model operates in three stages: data acquisition, transformation, and analysis. During the data acquisition phase, wireless sensor nodes collect information on soil nutrients and other fundamental inputs from the fields. Subsequently, the collected data is formatted appropriately, incorporating additional details such as crop type and time frame, before being transmitted to a remote server. The transformation process is tailored to the application and performed using smart devices. Finally, data analysis occurs on the remote server, and the resulting insights are communicated to the farmer (Fig. 1). Fig. 1 IoT-based model for precision agriculture Full size image 1. Data Acquisition: The data acquisition phase encompasses several vital operations, including deploying wireless sensor nodes, network configuration, and data collection. The first step involves selecting the area for cultivation. Subsequently, wireless sensor nodes are deployed in the field, configuring the network accordingly. Once deployed, the nodes collect data on primary nutrients (NPK) and other external parameters such as temperature, moisture, and pH. The collected data is then streamed and made available on the farmer's smartphone for access and monitoring. The soil samples are collected from various regional locations to normalize the NPK values. IoT-based wireless NPK sensors are embedded in the soil. 2. Data Transformation: The collected data is processed and transformed into the appropriate format to meet the application's requirements. This transformation ensures that the data is compatible with the desired analysis or processing tasks. Additionally, the data is supplemented with additional inputs such as the type of crop, time frame, and any other relevant information. Once the data is appropriately formatted and enriched, it is migrated to a remote server or cloud platform for further analysis and processing. 3. Data Analysis: The farmer's request is processed at the cloud platform, and a response is generated based on soil nutrient values and external parameters’ analysis. The analytic process considers the farmer's input and compares it with the collected data to provide relevant information and recommendations. For example, suppose a farmer queries about the fertilizer requirements for a specific crop. In that case, the system analyzes the soil nutrient values. It provides a response that includes the recommended amount of fertilizer, composition guidelines, and suitable temperature conditions for optimal crop growth. This response is returned to the farmer, enabling them to make informed decisions and take appropriate actions in their agricultural practices. 3.1 Toy Example 1. Data Acquisition Step 1: Choose the area for cultivation. Step 2: Install and configure wireless sensor nodes in the selected area. Step 3: Gather data using the deployed sensor nodes (Table 1). Table 1 Acquisition phase data from sensors Full size table 2. Data Transformation Step 4: The user determines crop selection and time frame, and the collected data is organized and transferred to a cloud platform. 3. Data Analysis Step 5: Load the sample values or data into memory. Step 6: Set the algorithmic parameters, such as “population size = 10”, “number of clusters (Ki = 1)”, and maximum number of iterations = 20, where i = 1, 2, … n. Step 7: Select the initial seed point K1 (15.949, 1.718, 13.068, 6.2, 30). Step 8: Evaluate the objective function and update the solution. Step 9: Check the termination condition. If it is met, stop the process; otherwise, repeat the steps. Step 10: Obtain the optimal solution. For example, the optimal solution obtained after the 20th iteration is K1 (4.634, 1.57, 4.715, 6.6, 29.30). The optimal values (4.634, 1.57, 4.715, 6.6, 29.30) are compared with the predefined database values for wheat crops shown in Table 2. Table 2 List of crops with NPK, pH, and temperature values Full size table Based on this comparison, the predicted amount of fertilizer (NPK) is (5.366, 0.43, 1.2), the variation in pH is 0.1, and the suitable temperature is 2.3. The response is then sent back to the farmer, suggesting implementing these recommendations in the cultivation area. 4 Conclusion and Future Scope This research introduces an approach that utilizes IoT technology to create a model for fertilizer detection. The aim is to precisely forecast the ideal amount of fertilizer required for cultivating crops. The model consists of three main phases: data acquisition, transformation, and analysis. During the data acquisition phase, soil nutrient values are collected, while in the transformation phase, the collected data is processed and transferred to a cloud platform for further analysis. Subsequently, a suitable response is generated and communicated back to the farmer. The proposed model effectively addresses common fertilization challenges such as over-fertilization, under-fertilization, and nutrient imbalances, all while ensuring cost-effectiveness. Future research will focus on incorporating additional external parameters like humidity and weather conditions to enhance the model’s accuracy. Additionally, the cultivation area will be divided into distinct regions, enabling a geographically based analysis to optimize crop quality and production further.

Introduction In In the face of escalating global challenges such as population growth, climate change, and urbanization, the call to reimagine our agricultural and horticultural systems becomes more critical than ever. The shadow of these issues hovers ominously over future food security, intertwined with the sustainable usage of our dwindling natural resources [1]. Yet, in this realm of concerns, a beacon of promise emerges from technological advancements, holding the potential to revolutionize the agricultural and horticultural landscapes [2]. Our pursuit, therefore, centers on the strategic leverage of these cutting-edge technologies to create more sustainable, productive, and resilient farming ecosystems worldwide. Sustainable access to high-quality food is not just a predicament for developing countries; even developed nations are grappling with this issue. Current agricultural practices, conducted predominantly in open fields, are not sufficiently productive to meet the escalating demand. As the World Health Organization projects, food production will need to increase by 70% by 2050 to meet the needs of an estimated global population of 10 billion [3], about 7 billion of whom will be living in urban areas [4]. Thus, exploring alternative production systems becomes not just an option but a necessity to ensure a sustainable food supply chain. One promising alternative is Controlled Environment Agriculture (CEA), which includes a variety of methods such as greenhouses, high-tunnels, vertical farms, and plant factories [5]. In particular, greenhouse farming has emerged as a method offering greater control over the growing conditions of crops, thereby enhancing yield and quality. This technique leverages controlled environments to optimize plant growth, promising higher production rates compared to traditional farming [6]. However, despite the potential of greenhouse farming within the CEA framework, it faces certain challenges. Economic sustainability remains a significant concern due to high operational costs, complex microclimate controls, and the need for continuous labor [7], [8]. These factors can inhibit the scalability and efficiency of greenhouse farming. To overcome these obstacles, it is imperative to incorporate advanced technologies such as artificial intelligence (AI) and deep learning (DL) into these farming systems. These cutting-edge tools can potentially transform the operational aspects of greenhouse farming. For instance, they can be leveraged for improved micro-environment monitoring and root-zone control, creating the optimal conditions for plant growth while minimizing resource wastage [5]. Additionally, AI and DL can facilitate the automation of labor-intensive tasks, thereby enhancing overall operational efficiency. In this context, the adoption and integration of AI and DL in greenhouse farming becomes not only a strategic advantage but a necessity to realize the full potential of Controlled Environment Agriculture(CEA) in addressing our global food security challenges. Simultaneously, the sphere of horticulture presents a distinct set of challenges and opportunities. Here, we face the necessity of balancing the cultural and economic value of crops with the labor-intensive nature of their cultivation. Thankfully, modern advancements offer promising solutions. Deep learning, in particular, holds the potential to streamline and revolutionize horticultural practices. The sheer volume of data that can now be collected from digital horticulture necessitates efficient processing and analysis. Deep learning algorithms can effectively handle such ‘big data’, enabling precise and timely decision-making in crop management [9]. In light of these advancements, it is crucial to remember that the applicability of such technologies is not limited to large-scale farming. Small indoor farms, which require significant labor year-round, can also benefit from the integration of intelligent automation. This inclusive approach to technological application in agriculture is critical to ensure food security in the long term. Through this review, we strive to explore and underline the recent advances in deep learning-assisted computer vision technologies in the domains of agriculture and horticulture in greenhouse setup. We aim to shed light on the challenges, opportunities, and future prospects of these technologies, underlining their potential role in securing global food supply chains, improving horticultural productivity, and propelling us towards a sustainable future.

Smart Greenhouse: An Overview Controlled Environment Agriculture (CEA), a modern farming method that uses greenhouses, is a powerful tool in today’s agriculture. This method is not new; in fact, greenhouses first started to be used in farming in The Netherlands and France back in the 19th century [13]. Since then, the technology has improved, and its use has spread worldwide. So, what exactly is a greenhouse? Essentially, a greenhouse is a structure - often built from glass or plastic that allows for year-round crop production, irrespective of the season. The glass or plastic walls and roof let sunlight in while keeping pests, diseases, and bad weather out. Depending on the outside weather, different variations of greenhouses can be used. For example, in very cold places, smaller greenhouses called “cold frames” can be used. These structures trap heat from the sun to keep the plants warm. In hot and dry areas, “shade house” greenhouses can be used. These provide shade and help to keep the plants moist [7]. As illustrated in figure 1, a modern greenhouse is a structure that provides a controlled environment ideal for crop cultivation. The image depicts a typical setup, including the protective coverings and the internal layout. This practical example gives a clear understanding of how greenhouse farming can defy external weather conditions and provide suitable growth conditions for diverse crops. FIGURE 1. A real-life example of a modern greenhouse. This image offers a practical perspective of the controlled environment within which diverse crops can be cultivated irrespective of external weather conditions. Source: [14]. Show All The main advantage of greenhouses is the ability to manipulate environmental parameters such as temperature, light intensity, moisture, and nutrient levels, adapting them to specific crop needs [15]. This facilitates an extended growing season, improved crop quality, and efficient use of resources. However, the management and maintenance of greenhouses can be resource-intensive, and fine-tuning conditions to the optimal range for various crops can be a complex task. This is where smart greenhouses, equipped with Internet of Things (IoT) technology, come into the picture. Smart greenhouses integrate sensors and embedded controllers that collect real-time data and relay it to a cloud server. The system can then make automatic adjustments to the internal greenhouse conditions based on this data, minimizing human intervention [16], [17], [18]. Smart greenhouses offer automatic regulation of critical factors like temperature, light, and irrigation, as well as control over other mechanical operations [19]. This brings a new level of efficiency to farming, optimizing resource use and potentially improving crop yields. Moreover, smart greenhouses provide farmers with valuable insights into the most suitable harvesting times, soil quality, nutrient requirements for plants, and water quality [20]. This data-driven approach allows for more informed decision-making, making farming more reliable and cost-effective. The future of farming appears even more promising with the integration of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Computer Vision. These technologies can further automate the greenhouse processes and increase their precision [21], [22], [23]. For instance, AI can analyze the vast amounts of data collected, predicting future needs and helping make even more accurate adjustments [24], [25]. Computer Vision can monitor plant growth, detect diseases early, and even identify when crops are ready to be harvested [12], [26], [27], [28], [29]. In essence, the marriage of greenhouse farming with IoT, AI, and Computer Vision is ushering in a new era of efficient, data-driven agriculture, transforming the traditional greenhouse into a ‘smart’ one (see figure 2). This integration, as illustrated in figure 2, provides a complete picture of how smart greenhouses are designed with various components working harmoniously. The ultimate vision is a fully automated and remotely controlled farm, optimizing resources, enhancing crop yield, and paving the way for a sustainable agricultural future. FIGURE 2. Schematic Representation of a Smart Greenhouse components Integrated with IoT, AI, and Computer Vision Technologies. Show All SECTION III. Vision Through Learning: A Deep Dive Into Computer Vision and Deep Learning Computer vision (CV) represents a sophisticated interdisciplinary field deeply rooted in both biological science and engineering, converging human-like perception with machine efficiency. Its core idea revolves around replicating how humans see and understand their surroundings and translating this understanding into computational models that machines can utilize. Historically, CV began as an effort to mimic human visual faculties. Early research aimed at understanding how humans perceive the world and then endowing machines with similar visual abilities. This required extensive collaboration between neuroscience to decode the human visual system and computer science to develop corresponding algorithms for machines [30]. Groundbreaking applications such as optical character recognition (OCR) [31] and vehicle plate detection marked the initial steps in this journey, impacting diverse areas like traffic control, law enforcement [32], and even retail [33]. These achievements were furthered by the use of deep learning (DL) and neural networks, allowing for the automatic extraction of high-level features from data, reducing the need for human intervention. The evolutionary development of CV expanded into more advanced areas like medical imaging, for detecting and diagnosing diseases [34], and autonomous driving, where it guides self-driving cars [35]. In manufacturing, CV aids in quality control with machine consistency, surpassing human ability [36]. It even breathes life into virtual reality in entertainment and social interaction [37] and enhances personalized safety measures through facial recognition systems in security [38], [39]. A vivid representation of these diverse applications of computer vision across various sectors can be seen in figure 3. An intriguing expansion of CV can be seen in the agricultural domain [12], [40], [41], [42]. Here, CV assists not only in crop-related tasks but also plays a significant role in livestock management. It contributes to monitoring animal health, tracking behavior, and managing resources, thereby increasing efficiency and sustainability in animal farming. For crop health, CV enables the detection of diseases, identification of pests, and optimization of resource allocation. With the analysis of visual data, CV tools can automate tasks like fruit picking, guide precision farming techniques, and even assist in tasks related to animal husbandry, such as recognizing individual animals, monitoring their movements, and observing their health status. FIGURE 3. Diverse Applications of Computer Vision Across Various Sectors. Show All Despite these advances, achieving a computer’s understanding of an image at a human child’s level remains unattainable. This underscores the ongoing challenges in a field with nearly limitless possibilities. The continuous progress in machine learning and DL further amplifies what CV can accomplish. Deep neural networks enable machines to recognize patterns and make decisions once believed to be exclusive to humans. CV is more than a field of study; it is a continually evolving area that harmoniously blends human perception with machine precision. Its applications are enriching various societal sectors, sometimes even surpassing human capabilities. A. From Basic Shapes to Complex Patterns In the initial stages of computer vision, the primary focus was on identifying simple and basic geometric forms such as edges, curves, and corners. These early techniques were often grounded in methods like gray-level segmentation [43], which involves dividing an image into different regions based on variations in brightness or color. However, these primitive methods had significant limitations and were not robust enough to handle more complicated visual tasks where understanding and interpreting complex patterns were required. To address these limitations and enhance the interpretation of visual data, researchers sought new approaches and began to integrate artificial neural networks into computer vision systems [44]. Artificial neural networks, inspired by the human brain’s interconnected neuron structure, allowed for a more sophisticated analysis of visual data [45]. Unlike the pixel-by-pixel analysis used in more rudimentary methods, neural networks provided a way for computer vision systems to analyze entire sections of an image in context, providing a more holistic understanding of the image content. This shift in approach led to substantial improvements in both performance and accuracy, enabling computer vision systems to understand and recognize more intricate patterns and shapes. Furthermore, these new methods allowed computer vision systems to analyze dynamic visual data, such as videos, enabling a higher level of interpretation that considered not only the shapes and patterns within a single frame but also how these elements changed over time [46]. The integration of neural networks marked a turning point in the field, transforming it from a discipline that could only handle rudimentary visual tasks to one that could take on complex challenges. This evolution also laid the groundwork for the modern, advanced applications of computer vision that we see today. Today’s computer vision applications follow a process that includes the acquisition of image data, the processing and analysis of that data using sophisticated algorithms and neural networks, and ultimately, the interpretation of the image as shown in figure 4. These applications range from medical imaging to autonomous vehicles, demonstrating the field’s progress from understanding basic shapes to interpreting complex, dynamic patterns. FIGURE 4. Flowchart of the Computer Vision Process. This diagram illustrates the sequential stages involved in computer vision applications, from the initial acquisition of image data to the final interpretation and utilization of the processed information. Show All B. The Toolbox of Computer Vision: Techniques and Tasks Computer vision is a diverse and exciting field that tries to mimic how humans perceive and understand the world around them. Its primary goal is to make sense of images, just like our own eyes and brains do. By understanding what is depicted in an image, computer vision systems can provide valuable information to guide the actions of robots, AI, and other automated systems. In the following sections, we will delve deeper into some of these critical techniques: image classification, object detection, segmentation, and 3-D reconstruction, that make it all possible. 1) Image Classification Image classification, a fundamental technique in computer vision, assigns predefined labels to images, categorizing complex visuals. Its essence is the ability to capture the essential features of a scene—such as differentiating crops or identifying plant diseases—without focusing on each tiny detail. The advent of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) has led to a significant transformation in this process. These robust networks use a variety of mathematical processes to efficiently learn from labeled images of crops(In figure 5). The revolution began in 2012 with AlexNet [47], a novel CNN architecture, setting a benchmark in the ImageNet Large Scale Visual Recognition Challenge, ushering a new era for image classification via CNNs. Between 2014 and 2017, there was a surge in refining CNN architectures, as seen with advancements in models like ResNet [48], VGG [49], and DenseNet [50]. These models, by employing innovative algorithms and connectivity patterns, heightened the ability to discern intricate details in agricultural imagery. Post-2017 witnessed the incorporation of reinforcement learning into CNNs, enabling these models to auto-determine optimal architectures, enhancing adaptability in dynamic agricultural environments. Contemporary studies further improve upon this with variants like ZFNet [51], which leverages visualization tools to understand neural activity, translating this into pixel-space insights. Such advancements not only enhance classification abilities but also unveil the working mechanisms of CNNs, making image-based agricultural decision-making more precise and insightful. Currently, these technologies are of extreme significance in improving the accuracy of image-based agricultural decision-making. FIGURE 5. Diagram of CNN’s image classification architecture mechanism. Show All 2) Object Detection Object detection in computer vision aims to locate and classify all possible objects within a given image. Central to this task are Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), which have predominantly been employed in two main architectures: one-stage and two-stage detection systems (in figure 6). Two-stage models, exemplified by the RCNN family, first pinpoint potential object regions (known as region proposals) and then classify these regions into distinct object categories. The evolution of this approach has led to various iterations, such as the original RCNN [52], Fast RCNN [53], and the more popular Faster RCNN [54]. Three pivotal advancements in the Faster RCNN are the Region Proposal Network (RPN), which efficiently creates object regions; ROI pooling, which extracts consistent features from regions of varying dimensions; and a multitask loss function, which consolidates the training process. While Faster RCNN is acclaimed for its accuracy, its processing speed is a limiting factor, especially for real-time applications. In contrast, one-stage models like YOLO [55] FIGURE 6. CNN architecture mechanism for Object detection. Show All and SSD [56] are designed for faster processing. These architectures generate candidate object regions from each pixel in feature maps, which are then classified and adjusted for accurate object boundaries. However, a key challenge with one-stage models is the significant imbalance between object and background regions in images. To address this, the RetinaNet [57] framework introduced a focal loss function, which emphasizes detection accuracy, balancing out the disproportionate number of irrelevant regions. While RetinaNet offers a blend of accuracy and efficiency, the choice between one and two-stage models depends largely on the specific application needs, with the former being ideal for real-time tasks and the latter prioritized when accuracy is paramount. Surprisingly, these state-of-the-art object identification methods have significant uses outside of traditional fields. The agricultural industry has embraced these technological marvels, especially in the context of greenhouse farming. Precision agriculture has entered a new era by adopting such advanced object detection technologies in greenhouse farming. These improvements have allowed for exact monitoring of plant growth, effective detection of pests, and efficient allocation of resources. 3) Segmentation Image segmentation is a fundamental computer vision task which categorizes each pixel of an image based on the object it belongs to. Early techniques used region division and merging, and later algorithms leveraged metrics like intra-regional consistency and inter-regional dissimilarity. Recently, machine learning has greatly enhanced segmentation, with key advancements being Mask RCNN [58], dual attention network [59], and particularly, U-Net [60] and its variants such as Attention U-Net [61], U-Net++ [62], ResUNet++ [63], and TransUNet [64]. These models have not only advanced the state of image segmentation but have also demonstrated exceptional efficacy in specialized tasks like medical image segmentation. Building on these semantic and instance segmentation techniques, such as the encoder-decoder framework and detection-based methods, further expands the versatility and precision of computer vision applications. Semantics and instance segmentation are vital techniques in computer vision. At a high level, semantic segmentation assigns masks to groups of objects with the same meaning in an image, such as all plants, while instance segmentation focuses on individual objects. Two primary frameworks are employed in these types of segmentations: encoder-decoder-based frameworks and detection-based frameworks. In the encoder-decoder approach, models typically consist of two main phases, as shown in figure 7. The encoder extracts meaningful feature maps from images using convolutional neural networks (CNNs). The decoder, on the other hand, upsamples these feature maps into per-pixel labels using transposed convolution. To enhance the precision of segmentation, these models often employ a lateral connection scheme. This connects feature maps between the encoder and decoder phases, ensuring the preservation of the image’s semantic meaning throughout the process. Additionally, post-processing methods like conditional random fields (CRFs) are utilized to refine object boundaries. Notable models in this category include U-Net, fully convolutional network (FCN) [65], FastFCN [66] and DeepLab [67]. FIGURE 7. CNN architecture mechanism for Segmentation. Show All Detection-based frameworks, in contrast, pivot on CNN architectures tailored for object detection. Some early efforts attempted to leverage object detection models, for instance, segmentation, such as simultaneous detection and segmentation (SDS) [68] and DeepMask [69]. However, these approaches struggled to achieve desired performance levels. The game-changer in this arena was the Mask RCNN, which integrated an FCN with a Faster RCNN to create masks for individual objects. This model has consistently demonstrated top-tier performance in both semantic and instance segmentation, solidifying its reputation in the field. 4) 3-D Modeling 3-D modeling in computer vision is fundamentally about stereo correspondence and 3-D reconstruction [70], [71]. Stereo correspondence generates a 3-D model from multiple images of the same object or scene by finding matching pixels across these images and mapping their 2-D positions to 3-D. Techniques such as epipolar geometry, sparse correspondence, and dense correspondence are commonly used [72]. On the other hand, 3-D reconstruction creates a 3-D model from a single image [73], [74]. The earliest approach involved predicting object shape from visual shading, pioneered by Horn in 1970 [75]. This was followed by other “shape from X” methods like shape from texture and shape from focus. Active range finding and model-based reconstruction, which are often used in architectural 3-D modeling, are among other methods. Designing an effective loss function for evaluating predicted 3-D point clouds against ground truth remains challenging, with options including evaluating the coverage of the ground truth object’s silhouette by the projected 3-D point clouds. Deep-learning-based algorithms have recently led to significant enhancements in the performance of 3-D reconstruction systems. In summary, the world of computer vision is as complex as it is fascinating, comprising an array of techniques and tasks that together help the system understand and interact with its environment. With the rapid advancements in machine learning and artificial intelligence, we can expect to witness further evolution in these techniques, expanding the possibilities of what computer vision can achieve. C. The Advent of Deep Learning Machine learning offers a significant advancement in data processing. Traditional methods typically necessitate manual feature extraction. With the surge in large data sets and the introduction of graphics processing units (GPUs), algorithmic methodologies have seen considerable refinement. Deep learning, an evolution from traditional machine learning, incorporates some “deeper” (more complex) structures, enabling automatic feature extraction from unprocessed data. It often surpasses the efficacy of its predecessor in various classification and prediction tasks [76]. By integrating multiple layers of abstraction, it allows hierarchical data representation [77], [78]. This multi-layered approach enhances the analytical performance for numerous large-scale data processing tasks [79], [80]. Essentially, deep learning is an advanced non-linear data processing technique grounded in representation learning and pattern analysis. Typically, deep learning models refine data representations through multi-layered neural networks. These networks comprise several neurons structured in layers. Neurons in adjacent layers connect based on weights, which are adjusted during learning. These neurons represent diverse non-linear functions, facilitating the creation of complex models. By connecting multiple layers, deep learning provides solutions for intricate real-world challenges efficiently [78]. The complex architecture and massive learning capability of deep learning models equip them with exceptional prediction and classification capabilities. This enables them to adapt effectively to complex data analyses. Leveraging its innate ability for automatic feature extraction, deep learning addresses several challenges in agriculture, such as various recognition, growth monitoring, yield estimation, quality assessment, stress detection, and more. These applications are discussed in detail in the next section. Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and their derived models play a pivotal role in artificial intelligence and have led to breakthroughs in image processing and analysis. CNNs are a class of deep, feed-forward artificial neural networks (ANNs) that are a family of multi-layered neural networks that have been effectively used in computer vision applications. They constitute a prominent method for analyzing vast amounts of data. Our analysis indicates that a significant majority of horticulture-related papers utilize CNNs. Typical CNNs incorporate convolution, pooling, and fully connected layers in various configurations to perform complex learning tasks. A model CNN architecture displays the process of classifying different flower species using multiple layers and components in figure 8. FIGURE 8. A Deep Convolutional Neural Network (DCNN) layout: This structure comprises an initial input layer, followed by four convolutional layers and their corresponding ReLU activations. It also features two stochastic pooling layers, a pair of fully connected layers, and concludes with a softmax regression output layer. Source: Prasad et al. [81]. Show All In the convolutional layer, local patterns within an image are identified using the process of convolution. Here is how it works: A kernel is initially positioned on the top-left part of the image as shown in figure 9. Each pixel under this kernel gets multiplied by the respective kernel value. The resulting products are then summed, with a bias added afterwards. The kernel shifts by a pixel, and the process continues until the entire image undergoes this filtering. Following the convolutional process, the pooling layer steps in, aiming to down-sample and extract prominent features from the obtained feature map. It also brings invariance to minor translations, rotations, and scaling in the image. Two prevalent pooling methods are max and average pooling, as shown in figure 10. While max pooling considers the highest value from a designated portion of the image, average pooling computes the mean of that portion. In most CNN architectures, convolutional and pooling layers alternate. The last key layer is the fully connected layer, where every neuron is interlinked to the preceding neuron. In this stage, the various features that were obtained from earlier layers are combined and condensed into a one-dimensional representation, preparing them for detection or classification objectives. FIGURE 9. The process of convolutional operation. Show All FIGURE 10. The process of pooling operation. Show All The efficacy of a deep learning model depends on the appropriate choice of hyperparameters. These include aspects like the network architecture, number of layers, number of neurons in the hidden layer, convolution and pooling layer structure, learning rate, weight initiation, and activation function. While custom architectures can be revolutionary and innovative, they typically demand an advanced level of computational expertise that may be beyond the capabilities of ordinary agricultural researchers. As a result, researchers frequently start with a pre-trained architecture that has proven to perform well over a wide range of data structures and challenges and then modify it to fit the issue at hand. This approach is reliable and effective. CNN architectures like LeNet, AlexNet, VGGNet, MobileNet, Inception V3, EfficientNet, GoogLeNet, and ResNet have been deployed for many computer vision tasks discussed in the next section. These networks process input through multiple convolution and pooling layers before utilizing fully connected layers for classification or detection tasks. The choice of parameters within these layers and model selection should be tailored to the specific problem as illustrated in Fig 11, graphical representations of the SSD deep learning architecture have been used to detect cherry tomatoes. The SSD utilized VGG16 as its base network, with multiple layers appended to its tail end. During the training process, both the image and its associated Ground-Truth Box were simultaneously fed into the system. Following this, each feature map across 6 layers generated a default box set, as well as the confidence of object category within the box. FIGURE 11. Classical SSD deep learning network architecture based on VGG-16. Source: [82]. Show All Another prevalent deep learning model used for sequential data is the recurrent neural network (RNN). This model excels in predicting prices [83], processing natural languages [84], recognizing speech [85], among other applications [86], [87]. An RNN’s unique attribute is its ability to retain previous data, which influences current outputs. Figure 12 demonstrates the basic architecture of the RNN applied to fruit quality assessment, illustrating how prior outputs serve as inputs due to the presence of the hidden layer. This layer effectively acts as a memory cell, ensuring every prior result informs the subsequent iteration. Consequently, each unit within the hidden layer is termed a recurrent cell. FIGURE 12. Architecture of RNN used for fruit quality assessment. Source: [88]. Show All Image segmentation tasks also benefited from deep learning techniques. The R-CNN method, for instance, combines CNNs with region proposals for object detection. Currently, Mask R-CNN leads the segmentation task, adding a branch to the Faster R-CNN for precise, high-quality segmentation mask generation for each region of interest. We already covered this in the previous section. There are many other neural network architectures that have been applied in the realm of deep learning. These include the Single Shot Multibox Detection (SSD), Long Short-Term Memory networks (LSTM), the “You Only Look Once” (YOLO), Region-based CNN (R-CNN), Fast R-CNN, and its successor, the Faster R-CNN etc. Beyond RGB imagery, these structures also support varied data formats, including videos, hyperspectral visuals, and spectral datasets. Moreover, for ease of reference, we have compiled a summary of the models reviewed. This includes details such as the year of development, key concepts, and links to source code or third-party implementation if available (See Table 2). Furthermore, to assess the effectiveness of these neural networks, various evaluation metrics have been used. Here are some commonly utilized metrics in the studies we have reviewed: Classification Accuracy (CA): This metric calculates the ratio of accurately identified images or classes to the overall number of images or classes. For problems involving multiple classes, the CA is computed as the average across all categories. CA= Number of Correctly Classified Samples Total Number of Samples (1) View Source Precision: Defined as the ratio of True Positives (TP) to the combined count of TP and False Positives (FP).

Deep Learning Assisted Computer Vision Applications in Greenhouse Farming The integration of deep learning-assisted computer vision techniques into greenhouse environments has produced promising results, indicating significant effectiveness. Deep learning-enhanced computer vision has a wide range of applications within the greenhouse industry, including recognition and classification of crops, crop yield estimation, crop quality inspection, crop growth monitoring, automatic harvesting, disease and pest management and so on. A small taxonomy of these applications is illustrated in figure 13. In this section of this paper, we explore the specific problems addressed in academic literature across these application areas. We investigate various computer vision techniques, models and architectures that have been utilized, the performance of the model adopted, discuss the underlying constraints and challenges, and offer insights to guide future research endeavors. FIGURE 13. Taxonomy of computer vision applications in greenhouse farming. Show All A. Crop Growth Monitoring Ensuring the healthy growth of crops is essential in greenhouse farming in order to achieve optimal yield, quality, and efficient use of resources, all of which contribute to profitable outcomes in agricultural production. Crops require a variety of nutrient elements, including macronutrients, secondary nutrients, and micronutrients, for optimal growth. Traditionally, monitoring crops has always relied heavily on human observations, which frequently leads to inaccurate and delayed results. Precision agriculture, especially in controlled environments like greenhouses, emphasizes the importance of consistent and accurate crop monitoring at varied growth stages. By integrating computer vision into greenhouse management, we can achieve real-time, precise monitoring. It provides timely interventions for optimal growth by detecting minute changes in crop health due to nutritional deficiencies far earlier than manual inspections. Utilizing innovative technologies to enhance agricultural processes, especially in the realm of greenhouse farming, is increasingly prevalent. Lee et al. [92] embarked on an exploration using clip-type Internet of Things (IoT) cameras to monitor tomato growth in a greenhouse setting, using deep learning-based object detection to track flower blooming and immature fruit development. By integrating the flower’s bloom date with temperature forecasting, their system could predict harvest dates with an average error of two days. While the clip-type design effectively addressed challenges like plant overlap in densely populated greenhouses, reliance on wired power sources and occasional occlusions posed limitations. The introduction of battery-powered IoT cameras and more adaptive positioning might enhance its applicability. In a different study, Gang et al. [93] implemented a convolutional neural network (CNN)-based model to estimate growth indices for greenhouse lettuce, utilizing RGB-D data from stereo cameras. Their dual-stage CNN architecture, building upon the ResNet50V2 layers, demonstrated remarkable accuracy. Similarly, Zhang et al. [94] showcased the capabilities of convolutional neural networks in relation to digital images. The study demonstrated how CNN can be useful in monitoring growth indicators like leaf fresh weight, leaf area, and leaf dry weight, delivering results that outperform traditional methodologies, especially for specific lettuce cultivars. However, while these models can extract depth information to enhance accuracy, their real-time application demands considerable computational power. Nevertheless, the speed of image processing, particularly with edge devices like Jetson SUB mini-PC, implies a potential future in real-time monitoring. The growing field of computer vision and deep learning has opened up new possibilities in crop management. Pre-trained models like YOLO, ResNet, VGG16, MobileNet, Detectron2, etc., have showcased remarkable capabilities in object detection. Integrating these advanced techniques into horticultural research has yielded impressive performance and opened avenues for innovative applications. For instance, Moysiadis et al. [95] highlighted the potential of using the YOLOv5 pre-trained model for mushroom growth monitoring. The complexities of mushroom growth patterns raise the significance of this research. However, the accuracy of detection underscores the challenges of using computer vision in dense environments with overlapping objects. Similarly, in a recent study, Shinoda et al. [96] introduced the “RoseTracker”, a system that combines YOLOv5, SORT, and a regression model aimed at monitoring the growth of roses in cultivation environments. The dataset they provided stands out due to its specific focus on the unique stages of rose growth. Though the results demonstrate remarkable accuracy, the system’s adaptability across diverse global cultivation conditions and its versatility with other floral species will be crucial factors in determining its broader acceptance and utility. These examples of applying deep learning-based computer vision to greenhouse crops demonstrate its utilization for various aspects of research and production, including species classification, organ detection, growth stage monitoring, and localization. Studies have implemented techniques like convolutional neural networks, YOLO, and other object detection models to track developmental indicators and phases precisely. While occlusion and adaptability across diverse environments remain challenges, deep learning enables real-time, accurate crop monitoring to support data-driven decision-making for optimal yields, quality, and resource efficiency in greenhouse farming. The technology displays remarkable potential in replacing time-consuming and imprecise manual inspection. Overall, deep learning-based computer vision facilitates timely, precise interventions for optimal greenhouse crop growth by detecting growth changes earlier than humanly possible. Further technological advances could transform greenhouse management and contribute to more sustainable, productive agricultural practices. Some of the studies in this area are precisely summarized in table 3 TABLE 3 Summary of Vision-Based Crop Growth Monitoring Studies B. Recognition and Classification of Crops Automated recognition and classification of greenhouse crops is a challenging task due to the vast diversity and continuous evolution of plant species. Moreover, crops can undergo various mutations, leading to significant variations within a single class. As a result, flowers from different species may share similar features such as shape, colour, and general appearance. Therefore, the recognition and classification of greenhouse crops presents a complex challenge with multi-class problems. Although manual classification is possible, it is typically labour-intensive and prone to errors, particularly when handling large numbers of samples. Hence, the application of computer vision-based deep learning techniques for the purpose of identifying and classifying species or cultivars holds immense potential as a groundbreaking advancement in the field of smart agriculture and greenhouse farming, thanks to their outstanding speed and accurate recognition capabilities. In recent advancements, the adoption of deep learning-based computer vision techniques in the domain of greenhouse agriculture has witnessed notable developments, particularly when it comes to enhancing precision and efficiency. Chen et al. [97] attempted to resolve the challenge posed by the dense intertwining of cucumber canopy vines. By proposing an image recognition model based on an enhanced YOLOv5, they aimed to increase the accuracy of detecting cucumber canopy vine tops. Notably, they introduced the CA (Coordinate Attention) mechanism module and transitioned from GIOU to EIOU for loss regression, resulting in a commendable accuracy of 97.1% in recognizing cucumber canopy tops in varied conditions. While the methodology is outstanding, there is potential to further adapt it for broader agricultural applications, considering the dynamism of outdoor conditions that might affect accuracy. Islam et al. [98] addressed the complications in separating leaf pixels from backgrounds in thermal images due to factors like thermal radiation and greenhouse humidity. They proposed TheLNet270v1, achieving a remarkable 91% accuracy in distinguishing canopy pixels. This innovative approach underscores the capability of deep learning in analyzing thermal images within greenhouses. While the results are promising, it is essential to make sure the model works well with different pixel size and adapt to the diverse environmental shifts commonly observed in greenhouses. Zhou et al. [99] proposed an “improved Faster-RCNN” architecture to detect strawberries from ground-level RGB images. This mechanism not only aids in efficient harvesting but also plays a pivotal role in selecting high-yield strawberry varieties. Their method achieved a notable fruit extraction accuracy of 86%, which surpassed the three other methods tested. However, the complexity and environmental adaptability of these models still necessitate further research. Future work in this domain needs to address training complexity and refine models to ensure robustness across various environmental conditions. Cong et al. [100] innovatively incorporated the Swin Transformer attention mechanism into Mask RCNN, enhancing the model’s feature extraction capabilities. Their model efficiently segmented sweet peppers even in complex scenarios, such as varying lighting conditions, pepper overlaps, and leaf occlusions. Achieving an average FPS value of 5, their approach holds promise for real-time monitoring of sweet pepper growth. Nevertheless, there is still room for improvement, especially in terms of real-time performance (e.g., inference speed), to make it more optimized and viable for large-scale practical applications, particularly in automated fruit-picking systems. In recent years, the automation of crop harvesting, specifically tomatoes, has gained considerable attention in agricultural robotics. Su et al. [101] targeted tomato maturity detection, an essential aspect for determining post-harvest logistics such as transportation and storage. Their SE-YOLOv3-MobileNetV1 model excelled in classifying tomatoes into four distinct maturity levels with an average precision value of 97.5%. The incorporation of the Squeeze-and-Excitation attention mechanism ensured accurate detection while keeping the model lightweight, an attribute essential for embedded development in robotic applications. However, despite the robustness of their model, additional progress is required to address the challenges posed by real-world circumstances, such as the mutual occlusion caused by leaves and fruits. Meanwhile, Yuan et al.’s [82] study focuses on detecting cherry tomatoes in a complex greenhouse setting. Considering the operational environment and the precision offered by deep learning, they chose the SSD model and further experimented with varying base networks and input sizes. Their results demonstrate significant improvements in automatic cherry tomato detection, with a fascinating 98.85% precision achieved using the Inception V2 network. However, the challenge of detecting side-grown tomatoes underscores the need to fine-tune the model for complex scenarios. Moreia et al. [102] highlighted the crucial step towards achieving fully automated robotic harvesting: the development of an accurate fruit detection system. They proposed a deep learning-based system using SSD MobileNet v2 and YOLOv4 models to detect tomatoes and introduced an innovative histogram-based HSV colour space model for classifying their ripening stage. Notably, YOLOv4 displayed an impressive performance in both detection and classification, with an impressive F1-Score of 85.81% in the detection task. Yet, challenges persisted in identifying the middle stages of ripening due to subtle colour variations. This underpins the importance of continual model refinement, especially when differentiating closely related classes. In another similar study, Mao et al. [103] strived to enhance the accuracy and practicality of cucumber detection in complex environments. They introduced a multi-path convolutional neural network (MPCNN) with colour component selection and a support vector machine (SVM). The methodology effectively identified the cucumber region by reducing the background interference and emphasizing the colour differences between the cucumber and its surroundings. This approach yielded satisfactory results, with over 90% pixels in cucumber images being accurately classified. However, it remains uncertain how this model would perform under different environmental conditions or with other cucumber varieties. These applications of deep learning-based computer vision for automated recognition and classification of greenhouse crops shows promising results, but also persisting challenges. Studies have utilized techniques like YOLO, Mask RCNN, Faster R-CNN, MobileNets, and Swin Transformers to accurately detect and classify various crop species, cultivars, and growth stages. The complexities of distinguishing between highly similar classes, handling occlusion, and adapting models across diverse environments and lighting conditions remain active research problems. However, deep learning methodologies have achieved remarkable accuracies surpassing traditional techniques. Continual refinement of models and architectures tailored to specific crops, growth conditions, and agricultural tasks is still needed for robust real-world performance. Table 4 summarizes the technical details of the studies presented in this subsection. TABLE 4 Summary of Recognition and Classification of Crops C. Crop Disease Monitoring In agriculture, plant diseases always remain a major issue that causes significant losses in the world’s food production, particularly in controlled settings like greenhouses. It is severely affecting the yield and quality of agricultural products and has become a key concern in the development of global agriculture. Traditional identification methods, largely manual and guided by pathologists, often lack the desired speed and precision, making them unsuitable for the fast-paced requirements of modern agriculture. Therefore, the development of deep learning and computer vision presents a promising path toward fast and accurate disease recognition; however, environmental factors such as different lighting and leaf occlusion continue to be ongoing challenges that researchers work to overcome in the area of greenhouse disease monitoring. At present, advances in imaging technology have led to the creation of several open-source image datasets featuring various horticultural crops. Notable datasets include ImageNet, PlantVillage, and OUFD. These collections have significantly improved the accuracy of image classification and recognition. Such large-scale image datasets are extensively used, offering plenty of feature information for training deep neural network models in horticultural research. With PlantVillage(https://www.tensorflow.org/datasets/catalog/plant_village), Wspanialy et al. [104] explored diseases affecting tomato leaves and highlighted the importance of automated disease detection because of its cost-effective implications. Their system can identify various tomato leaf diseases and evaluate their severity. While the method showed the potential to detect previously unseen diseases and yielded severity estimations comparable to human assessments, biases in the dataset, especially concerning the background, could limit its real-world applicability. Future efforts should concentrate on diversifying datasets to ensure the development of more generalized and robust models. Similarly, using the PlantVillage dataset, Restrepo-Arias et al. [105] introduced a novel diagnostic approach that highlights the impact of genotypic and phenotypic characteristics on how plants respond to pathogens. Their method, which emphasizes texture-based features and uses Bayesian Optimization to train artificial neural networks, achieved an impressive accuracy of up to 96.31% with MobileNet. This method’s emphasis on textural features shows promise, potentially reducing biases arising from leaf morphology. However, exploring more plant datasets and, experimenting with different image sizes, not relying solely on texture, and considering various features might enhance its classification accuracy and broaden its applicability. Despite the widespread use of open-source datasets like PlantVillage, crop recognition systems are still in the development stage and have not been established on a large scale. As a result, most researchers prefer to experiment with their own collected image sets. Zhao et al. [106] collected images of healthy and diseased strawberry varieties to build their dataset. They introduced a modified Faster RCNN architecture, emphasizing multiscale feature fusion. Achieving a commendable mAP of 92.18%, their method stands out for its efficiency and accuracy. Still, continuous refinement of their model is required for its adaptability across a broader spectrum of strawberry diseases. Xu et al. [107] addressed the challenge of melon leaf disease detection using an innovatively pruned version of YOLO v5s combined with ShufeNet v2. Their strategy achieved an impressive 95.7% mAP@0.5. By focusing on smaller disease features, they achieved real-time detection in intricate greenhouse environments. The model’s speed and efficiency, with an inference time of just 13.8 ms, are noteworthy. Their work underscores the power of leveraging refined neural networks for specific tasks, though the expansion to other crops will determine its broader relevance. Zhang et al. [108] employed the EfficientNet-B4 model to identify diseases in cucumber leaves, achieving an impressive 97% accuracy. However, external factors like lighting introduced challenges in distinguishing similar diseases. While their approach offers promise for real-time greenhouse monitoring, addressing environmental variables and optimizing for different devices, remain crucial for broader applicability. Zhang et al. [109] utilized color and color-infrared (CIR) images to diagnose wheat diseases like leaf rust and tan spots. Employing deep features extracted through the ResNet101 model, their approach achieved notable accuracies up to 84%. While their approach maximizes the advantages of automated image analysis over manual observation, the deep-learning model’s supremacy in capturing finer features stands out, making it a promising direction for further advancements in disease detection. These investigations show that deep-learning models, particularly when trained on comprehensive image datasets, offer substantial promise in timely and accurately detecting plant diseases in controlled environments like greenhouses. The fusion of computer vision and advanced imaging technology has shown the potential to revolutionize traditional agricultural monitoring practices. A detailed summary of the techniques and their respective performances in the discussed research can be found in table 5. TABLE 5 Summary of Greenhouse Crop Disease Monitoring D. Automatic Harvesting Historically, the agricultural landscape was dominated by manual and labor-intensive processes, leading to increased costs and limitations in efficiency. The recent advent and integration of computer vision technology have marked a significant agricultural transformation. Today, the use of advanced technology in the form of intelligent harvesters equipped with vision-based robotics is on the rise. Groundbreaking research in this area has reshaped the paradigms of contemporary agricultural production, both investigating and implementing these technological advancements. For instance, Rong et al. [110]’s exploration into robotic harvesting of greenhouse tomatoes sheds light on the current technological challenges in replicating the efficiency and accuracy of manual harvesting. They proposed an advanced system to accurately identify tomato positions and determine the best grasping technique. By integrating a YOLOv5m-based detection mechanism, they achieved impressive recognition accuracies of 90.2% for tomato bunches and 97.3% for individual fruits. However, while their optimized strategies reduced collision impacts on the manipulator’s grasp, yielding a promising harvesting success rate of 72.1%, their average harvesting time of 14.6 seconds per fruit still underscores the need for speed improvements. Similarly, Benavides et al. [111] attempted to automate tomato crop harvesting using a Computer Vision System (CVS), with a primary focus on the detection and localization of ripe tomatoes. By employing a myriad of digital image processing tools and basic trigonometry, the system successfully classified around 80.8% of beef tomatoes and 87.5% of cluster tomatoes as “collectible.” An outstanding achievement was the sub-millisecond processing time, a significant leap from previous methodologies. Despite the advancements, challenges persist in terms of ambient lighting conditions and the variability of the working environment, emphasizing the need for more adaptable and robust systems. A different study by Rong et al. [112] highlights the need for a fully automated mushroom harvesting robot. Their innovative robot system, employing Intel RealSense D435i for imaging and an improved SSD algorithm for detection, offers a promising mushroom recognition success rate of 95%. The system’s robustness is further evidenced by an admirable harvesting success rate of 86.8% within an average time of 8.85 seconds per mushroom. However, their initial approach to mushroom recognition faced challenges with varying illumination, adhesion intricacies, and posture identification, underscoring the need for deep learning models with more sophisticated recognition algorithms to effectively negotiate the intricacies involved in mushroom identification across diverse circumstances, hence enhancing the process. Nonetheless, the fragile nature of oyster mushrooms highlights the critical need for advancements in end-effector designs, ensuring minimal damage during the harvesting process. Recent innovations by Liu et al. [113] explored the application of the DA-Mask RCNN model for detecting green asparagus. The aim was to enhance detection precision during the autonomous harvesting of green asparagus by integrating MASK RCNN with depth information. The addition of the depth filter showed significant promise, especially under varying illumination conditions, achieving precision values of up to 0.993. While the model demonstrated resilience against false positives in bright lighting, further optimization, particularly for nighttime scenarios, is crucial for broader applications. These studies underscore the transformative potential of combining computer vision with deep-learning models in reshaping harvesting practices. While significant advancements have been achieved, the interplay between accuracy and operational efficiency emerges as a central concern. Table 6 summarizes the technical details of the studies discussed in this subsection. TABLE 6 Summary of Greenhouse Automatic Harvesting Task E. Yield Estimation Yield estimation in agricultural production is pivotal for stakeholders across the spectrum—from farmers to agricultural enterprises. It aids in strategically navigating post-harvest operations, driving marketing initiatives, and optimizing resource allocation. While traditional techniques have dominated this space, there is an emergent reliance on cutting-edge computational methodologies. The intersection of computer vision and agriculture has seen innovative developments, particularly with the employment of deep learning models to address challenges like overlapping crops, dense vegetation, and varying light conditions specially in greenhouse setup. This synthesis of technology and agriculture brings new methodologies, delivering improved precision in predictions, even as complexities arise. Wang et al. [114] employed an improved version of the YOLOv3 deep learning model to estimate tomato yields in artificially lit plant factories (PFAL). By refining the traditional YOLO algorithm, they achieved a notable mean average precision (mAP) of 99.3%—a 2.7% improvement over the original YOLOv3. Notably, their approach excelled in distinguishing densely packed and obscured fruits, paving the way for real-time crop monitoring and dynamic yield estimation. However, challenges persist due to the complex lighting conditions in PFAL environment and similarities between green fruit and their surrounding vegetation. In another study, Maji et al. [115] investigated wheat yield estimation through SlypNet, a hybrid deep learning approach that combines Mask R-CNN and U-Net. This approach effectively captures wheat morphological features, attaining a high mAP of 97.57% in spike detection. The study underscored the technique’s resilience to natural field constraints like overlapping and varying resolution. Yet, while SlypNet proved excellence for its detection capabilities, it acknowledges the challenge in precisely estimating grain yield from spikelet counts. Further studies focused on investigating the intricate anatomical details of spikelets could potentially enhance the precision of yield prediction. The growth and development of generative organs in greenhouse plants are essential for both yield estimation and higher productivity. Given the challenges in the greenhouse environment, such as leaf and branch obstructions and the risk of duplicate counts, there is a pressing need for more efficient methods. Manual counting approaches are time-consuming and often marred by inaccuracies, highlighting the necessity for rapid and automated solutions. Egi et al. [116] addressed this need by innovatively incorporating a drone-based AI system to detect and count greenhouse tomatoes. Their emphasis was not limited to the fruits; they also targeted the flowers. Using the YOLO V5 and Deep Sort algorithms, their method showcased remarkable accuracies of 99% for green tomatoes and 85% for red tomatoes. Nonetheless, their approach faced challenges with flower detection, securing only a 50% accuracy. While their achievements are commendable, the potential inaccuracies from drone movements, combined with the shortcomings in flower detection, hint at areas for improvement. An expanded dataset could offer a potential solution. Zhou et al. [117] utilized an “Improved ResNet” deep learning model to segment accurately and grade broccoli heads in greenhouse conditions. Their method achieved an impressive accuracy of 0.896 for broccoli head segmentation, even in varied lighting conditions. While the model’s performance is notable, its dependency on controlled environments and data processing pipeline reliance on manual settings poses challenges for real-world applications. However, the potential integration of semi-supervised learning in future work indicates promising strides towards refining and optimizing crop yield estimation in greenhouse farming. From the discussed studies centered on yield estimation in agricultural settings, particularly in greenhouses, it becomes evident that the scientific community is making strides in leveraging advanced computational techniques. These pioneering methodologies, while exhibiting remarkable promise, also underscore the complexities of the greenhouse environment. Further investigation and advancement in these methods could potentially bring about a paradigm shift in the agricultural sector—including farmers and enterprises—strategize planting, harvesting, and marketing initiatives. Table 7 provides more details about the complex technical aspects of the studies discussed here. TABLE 7 Summary of Greenhouse Yield Estimation F. Crop Health Analysis In the realm of greenhouse plant health analysis, advanced computer vision techniques have provided innovative solutions for the prompt detection of crop biotic and abiotic stresses, nutrient deficiencies, and water stress, ensuring superior plant quality. The ability to promptly identify biotic and abiotic stresses is imperative for effective greenhouse crop management and optimal plant health. While visual inspection is tedious and subjective, computer vision and spectral imaging offer great promise for automated, non-invasive assessment of crop condition. As Taha et al. [118] employed spectral analysis and machine learning models to estimate nutrient contents in aquaponically grown lettuce. Using the selected optimal wavelengths, they achieved commendable predictive accuracies ( R 2 ≥0.94 ), suggesting a potential automated solution for nutrient estimation in aquaponics. However, the real challenge lies in translating these lab-based experiments to real-world greenhouses where external factors can significantly impact spectral readings. Eshkabilov et al. [119] also employed hyperspectral imaging within the 400–1000 nm range to predict nutrient concentrations in lettuce cultivars using PLSR and PCA models, achieving high accuracy ( R 2 =0.784 -0.987) with laboratory measurements. However, while hyperspectral imaging holds promise, its implementation might be restrictive due to cost implications, especially for small-scale greenhouse farmers. RGB imaging has also been utilized for abiotic stress detection. Lak et al. [120] developed a classification algorithm using visible light images and MLP neural network modeling to detect water stress in greenhouse tomatoes. After optimizing with PCA, the technique achieved 83.3% accuracy in distinguishing normal and water-stressed plants using only RGB image features. Surprisingly, adding thermal imagery did not improve results. Similarly, Levanon et al. [121] utilized RGB and thermal imaging along with neural networks to predict water and nutrient stress in banana plantlets. The multi-modal data fusion approach enabled models to achieve high prediction accuracy of over 90% for four stress classes. However, the small sample size of 16 plants may limit generalization. Beyond abiotic factors, computer vision shows promise for biotic disease screening. Najafian et al. [122] introduced a large dataset of over 40,000 wheat kernel images to detect Fusarium damage using deep learning models like EfficientNet and ResNet. The semi-supervised approach reached F1 scores up to 84.29% for binary classification but was limited for multi-class tasks. Overall, the dataset provides a valuable benchmark, but more samples are needed. Janani et al. [123] proposed a unique method to identify nitrogen nutrient levels in groundnut leaves using the CNN-based HVN model, achieving a training accuracy of 95% and validation accuracy of 92%. Although their method highlighted the significance of leaf color in determining nitrogen concentration, they acknowledged potential inaccuracies stemming from external factors unrelated to nitrogen levels. Such nuances emphasize the importance of considering all potential variables in crop health prediction. Overall, these studies demonstrate that computer vision and spectroscopy can enable automated, non-destructive monitoring of multiple crop health indicators. However, translating these technologies into commercial systems will require more robust models that fuse multi-modal data to overcome environmental noise, larger datasets to improve generalizability, and model optimization to account for subtleties between stress symptoms and normal variations. Table 8 provides more details about the complex technical aspects of the studies discussed here. TABLE 8 Summary of Greenhouse Crop Health Analysis G. Pest and Insect Monitoring Monitoring pests and insects in greenhouses has always been a primary concern for sustainable agriculture, impacting both the quality and quantity of yield. It has now become an exciting field in the agricultural domain, emphasizing the critical need for precise, real-time solutions. Traditional methods have shown limitations in accuracy and response time. Consequently, computer vision and deep learning, particularly convolutional neural networks (CNNs), are being increasingly explored to identify pests like whiteflies and thrips, aiming to streamline and improve the detection process in greenhouse environments. Traditionally, farmers manually sample, count, and identify pests, a time-consuming and error-prone process. The integration of computer vision presents a more effective and accurate alternative, and a wide range of research is exploring its possibilities in the context of integrated pest management (IPM) [124], [125], [126], [127], [128], [129], [130], [131]. In a recent study, Liu et al. [129] investigated real-time pest detection on crops using advanced computer vision and deep learning. By adopting convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and generating a virtual database for training, they achieved an impressive 97.8% detection accuracy for various invertebrate pests on crops. In the future, utilizing multispectral or hyperspectral imaging may make it possible to identify well-camouflaged pests. Furthermore, the development of ground-based robotic system capable of performing real-time proximal detection of invertebrate pests could be the future of pest management. Yang et al. [128] focused their research on identifying greenhouse pests, especially whiteflies and thrips, using image processing. Their novel method employed dual color spaces(HIS and Lab) combined with advanced ensemble learning classifiers, resulting in a commendable 95.73% recognition accuracy. While this approach substantially minimized manual intervention, the study underscores the challenge of uniformly illuminating complex greenhouse environments, possibly impacting accuracy in varied scenarios. Despite this success, there is still room for improvement. The system could be more optimized by reducing the number of false positive detections. Moreover, extending the system’s capability to a broader range of environments beyond greenhouses is on the horizon. On a similar note, Li et al. [131] also conducted research on detecting whitefly and thrips from sticky trap images using a deep learning model, ‘TPest-RCNN’, based on the Faster R-CNN. This model, fine-tuned for small insect detection, showed excellent precision with a mAP of 0.95. While the results were promising, challenges like diverse pest densities and lighting conditions remain. However, their approach sets a robust groundwork for real-time monitoring, which can significantly aid timely interventions. In a distinctive approach, Zhao et al. [130] tackled pest detection in Brassica chinensis through images captured by unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV). Given the challenges of aerial imagery such as image blur and small object sizes, their strategy leveraged deep learning combined with improved CenterNet algorithms, realizing a detection performance of up to 94.7% R-squared. Despite its potential, aerial imagery’s inherent issues, like blurring, could affect its widespread adaptability unless integrated with superior quality cameras or advanced image restoration techniques. In a different study, Lins et al. [127] addressed the task of automating the counting and classification of aphids, particularly Rhopalosiphum padi, using a software named ‘AphidCV’. This software, rooted in computer vision and machine learning, not only expedited the counting process but also introduced morphometry data. While its prowess is undoubted, some limitations in classifying winged aphids were evident. Diversifying the training dataset, perhaps with data augmentation techniques, could be beneficial. This solution holds promise for its extension to other aphid species and direct application in field-based pest management, reducing reliance on labor-intensive manual methods. Given the advancements detailed above, computer vision, particularly when coupled with deep learning methodologies like CNNs, showcases transformative potential in the realm of greenhouse pest detection and management. Nevertheless, as research progresses, it is imperative to address inherent challenges, such as diverse pest densities and varied lighting conditions, to ensure consistent, real-time accuracy. Embracing multi-modal data fusion, hyperspectral imaging, and more extensive datasets can further amplify the precision and reliability of these systems within greenhouse environments. Table 9 details the technical aspects of the discussed studies. TABLE 9 Summary of Greenhouse Pest and Insect Management H. Greenhouse Crop Quality Inspection The quality control and grading of agricultural commodities is essential for determining their market value, safety, and appeal to consumers [132]. Manual inspection, however, can be inconsistent, labor-intensive, and unscalable for large-scale production. The integration of computer vision and artificial intelligence has unlocked exciting new possibilities for automated, non-destructive, and real-time assessment of horticultural produce quality [133], [134], [135], [136], [137]. As explored by Tan et al. [134], deep convolutional neural networks demonstrated high accuracy (mean average precision of 95.52%) in classifying the maturity of tomatoes based on color features extracted from images. The use of task-specific architectures like Mask-RCNN allowed precise segmentation and localization of the produce within complex backgrounds. However, the model training time of 6 hours indicates room for optimization in computational efficiency for real-time adoption. Beyond maturity, quality parameters like pest/disease damage, ripeness, and shelf-life have also been automated using imaging techniques. For instance, Hendrawan et al. [135] developed a convolutional neural network model to categorize large green chili peppers into three maturity classes with 91.27% accuracy. The model shows promise for rapid, objective maturity grading to standardize quality. However, classification accuracy was lower for immature peppers, warranting further research into data augmentation and transfer learning to improve model robustness. In another study, Shi et al. [136] combined deep learning and causal analysis to predict maturity dates of leafy greens in greenhouses, achieving a root mean squared error of only 2.49 days. While novel, the approach struggled with crops in late static growth stages, suggesting the need for adaptive models that emphasize historical data over static phenotypes in late stages. Wei et al. [137] developed a model using grape skin color analysis and a backpropagation neural network to predict the maturity of greenhouse-grown grapes, achieving up to 79.4% accuracy. A two-factor color model performed better than single-color predictors. However, prediction accuracy varied between grape varieties depending on color changes during ripening. Custom varietal models or adaptive techniques may further improve prediction. Zhu et al. [133] proposed a computer vision approach using YOLOv5 and OpenCV to grade mushrooms in greenhouses based on size features automatically. The model achieved 96% accuracy in identifying and measuring occluded mushrooms under varying illumination. However, further work is needed to optimize mushroom recognition speed and expand functionality for tasks like robotic spraying. Nyalala et al. [138] presented a technique using machine learning and image processing to estimate the weight and volume of tomatoes on a simulated greenhouse conveyor system. Occluded tomatoes were segmented using polygon approximation before extraction of shape features. The best models achieved high correlation with reference measurements, demonstrating feasibility for in-line, non-destructive quality screening. Nonetheless, additional testing is required across diverse tomato varieties and shape features. The studies presented highlight the immense potential of computer vision and AI techniques to automate the quality assessment of greenhouse-grown horticulture produce. Advanced models have enabled non-destructive evaluation of multiple quality traits, from external features like pest/disease damage and maturity to internal parameters like texture and shelf-life. However, enhancements in model versatility, accuracy, and computational efficiency are needed to account for the diversity of greenhouse varieties and environments. Current systems also have limited real-world testing beyond controlled settings. Expanding datasets, integrating multi-modal sensor inputs, and optimizing deep learning architectures tailored for greenhouse conditions will be critical next steps. While research is still progressing, computer vision and AI solutions promise to transform quality control practices for greenhouse horticulture. Automated, real-time quality grading and defect detection could provide invaluable objective data to support selective harvesting, packing, pricing, and sales for greenhouse produce. Overall, these emerging technologies are poised to enhance productivity, reduce waste, and add value to the competitive greenhouse industry. Table 10 presents the technical details of several studies conducted in this area. TABLE 10 Summary of Greenhouse Crop Quality Inspection I. Seed Quality Analysis Seeds are crucial to modern agriculture, determining both food supply and crop yield [118]. Traditional manual assessments of seed quality, while essential, are laborious and prone to inaccuracies. The commercial seed industry is now leaning into computer vision technology, tapping into its potential to extract seed features with precision. With the rapid advancement of various imaging techniques, enhanced by deep learning, this technology sets new benchmarks for seed quality evaluation in greenhouse settings [140], [141], [142], [143], [144], [145]. For example, Medeiros et al. [141] investigated the application of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) with X-ray imagery to determine crambe seed quality. Their deep learning models robustly categorized seeds based on their tissue integrity, germination, and vigor with impressive accuracies of 91%, 95%, and 82%, respectively. This substantiates the vast potential of X-ray imagery in furnishing critical insights into the physical and physiological attributes of seeds. However, a lingering concern is the reliance on digital radiographic images, which, while powerful, might not capture the complete essence of seed vitality in diverse scenarios. On a similar note, Hong et al. [142] employed a combination of hyperspectral and X-ray imaging techniques for a nondestructive viability prediction of pepper seeds. The ensemble-based fusion model, integrating both hyperspectral and X-ray data, stood out with an accuracy of 92.51%. This approach demonstrates that combining different imaging modalities can produce more accurate categorization results. Nonetheless, the research’s dependency on just two pepper-seed cultivars may demand broader experimental validations for holistic reliability across varied conditions. In a different study, Lube et al. [143] introduced the MultipleXLab system: a flexible platform for monitoring seed germination and root growth. Using deep learning methodologies, they showcased the system’s capability to screen seed vigor and evaluate seedling responses under varied conditions. The system, however, presents two key challenges: its restricted experimental duration due to agar dehydration and a potential light deprivation issue for seeds placed in specific positions. Overcoming these limitations could elevate its utility. Gao et al. [144] presented an innovative end-to-end platform named HyperSeed, which is adept at providing hyperspectral information specifically for seeds. Their application on rice seeds using a 3D convolutional neural network (3D CNN) outperformed traditional methods like the support vector machine (SVM) model, boasting an impressive 97.5% accuracy. Nevertheless, the system is constrained by its single-threaded software nature and demands exploration of global spatial traits, hinting towards potential future advancements. On the other hand, Sabanci et al. [140] conducted a study to distinguish between tomato seed cultivars, employing a multi-tier deep learning approach. They initially utilized convolutional neural network (CNN) models for seed image classification, with MobileNetv2 showcasing the highest efficacy. Furthermore, they leveraged deep features from this model to feed a Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (BiLSTM) network, pushing the classification accuracy to a notable 96.09%. Despite the promising results, the study underscores the importance of diverse datasets for model robustness and suggests hyperparameter optimization to enhance performance. To synthesize, while computer vision technologies are profoundly redefining seed quality assessments in greenhouse farming, there remains an imperative for further refinements to harness their full potential. Such tools, when impeccably optimized, can provide real-time and nondestructive solutions to the complexities of seed quality evaluation in the modern agricultural landscape. Table 11 provides a concise summary of several studies conducted in this field. TABLE 11 Summary of Greenhouse Seed Quality Analysis J. Weed Management Weed management poses a significant challenge in contemporary agriculture, as weeds compete with crops for vital resources such as light, water, nutrients, and space. Weeds are a primary factor behind agricultural yield losses. Study [146] highlighted that weeds account for about 34% of yield losses, substantially more than losses from pests (18%) or pathogens (16%). Recently, the agriculture sector has seen a growing interest in integrating modern weed management techniques with computer vision. Extensive research has been carried out using these cutting-edge technologies to control and manage weed growth in greenhouses. In one study, Koparan et al. [147] emphasized the role of image background in deep learning models for weed detection. The study applied advanced architectures like VGG16 and ResNet50, highlighting a decrease in model accuracy when transitioning from a uniform to a non-uniform background and vice versa. However, when combined data sets from both backgrounds were used, the performance surged to nearly 99%. Despite their rigorous approach, the limitations lie in the model’s dependency on the image backgrounds, underscoring the need for more diverse training data. This could enhance the model’s adaptability across varying environmental conditions. In another study, Wang et al. [148] underscored the challenges posed by the limited availability of weed datasets in the field. The study introduced “Weed25”, a dataset encapsulating images of 25 weed species and utilized state-of-the-art models like YOLOv3, YOLOv5, and Faster R-CNN to achieve impressive accuracy rates hovering around 92%. However, the research confines its scope to only 25 species, leaving room for the inclusion of more diverse weed types, which could lead to further refinement of models tailored for precision in greenhouse weed management. Oda et al. [149] developed a multispectral camera system specifically for recognizing weeds within crops. Their findings revealed that the infrared band was more precise than other bands, highlighting its importance in plant detection. This affirms the potential of combining computer vision with multispectral imaging in enhancing post-emergence herbicide applications. Nonetheless, challenges persist, including the influence of leaf overlap and varied light intensities on detection accuracy. Addressing these challenges head-on could pave the way for more robust and accurate weed detection models. Koparan et al. [150] examined the role of site-specific weed management using RGB image texture features. Their methodology compared the Support Vector Machine (SVM) and the deep learning-based VGG16 models. Remarkably, their deep learning approach, specifically the VGG16 model, showcased an impressive f1-score value of 100% for corn classification, which is a breakthrough for the corn crop production system. While their method holds potential, one must consider the vast variability of crops and regions. A significant highlight of their work is the effectiveness of VGG16 in identifying weeds in the presence of various crops, elucidating the intricacies of weed-crop dynamics in precision agriculture. In a different study, Rai et al. [151] deployed deep learning models on edge devices, aiming to detect weeds through aerial imagery. By comparing both heavyweight and lightweight deep learning models, they showed that lightweight models, specifically CSPMobileNet-v2 and YOLOv4-lite, achieved a mean average precision(mAP) of 83.2% and 82.2%, respectively. Their approach offers real-time detection with commendable accuracy but, critically, must be scrutinized for potential hardware biases and storage challenges, especially with high-resolution aerial data. The flexibility offered by edge computing cannot be ignored; however, securing these devices remains a pertinent concern. Drawing insights from those studies, it is evident that integrating computer vision techniques holds immense potential for refining greenhouse weed management. However, achieving precision remains a formidable challenge. Diverse data sources, enhanced models, and advanced imaging techniques may collectively steer the future of this realm, allowing for more sustainable and efficient weed control in greenhouses. A brief overview of different studies in this area, along with their technical details, can be found in Table 12. TABLE 12 Summary of Greenhouse Weed Management SECTION V. Critical Challenges Faced by Computer Vision Technology in Smart Greenhouse Operations and the Way Out While computer vision has shown immense potential across various greenhouse applications, as highlighted in this review, significant challenges must be addressed for effective real-world deployment. A. Lack of Large-Scale Standardized Datasets A major limitation identified is the shortage of large-scale standardized image datasets for the greenhouse domain (as noted in [66], [102], [105]). Most studies rely on small proprietary datasets collected by the researchers themselves, often just a few hundred images, which restricts generalization of techniques ([93], [98], [107]). There is a need to establish extensive public databases encapsulating the diversity of greenhouse environments, with variability in factors like lighting, humidity, crop types, growth stages, and imaging angles represented ([92], [95], [106]). Centralized repositories like PlantVillage offer a valuable start but have limited coverage and annotation complexity. Constructing large-scale greenhouse image datasets with standard formatting and annotations will be critical to benchmark performance of computer vision techniques and fuel advancements ([94], [114], [115]). B. Need for Specialized and Optimized Models While deep neural networks have driven progress in many visual recognition tasks, off-the-shelf models pre-trained on open-field images fail to account for the unique intricacies of greenhouse environments ([96], [97], [105]). Networks designed for generic datasets do not transfer effectively to greenhouses, as the specialized appearance and growth patterns of crops in controlled settings are not represented ([99], [108], [109]). The frequent occlusion from dense foliage, glass surface reflections, condensation, extreme illumination fluctuations, and evolution of visual features across plant growth requires specialized model architectures and training strategies ([95], [100], [114]). For instance, Li et al. [97] found that directly applying YOLOv3 for cucumber canopy recognition resulted in insufficient accuracy, requiring an enhanced model with additional coordinate attention modules. Xu et al. [107] showed that extensive pruning and adaptation of YOLOv5s was needed for effective real-time melon disease detection in greenhouses. Rong et al. [110] demonstrated that off-the-shelf YOLOv5 had difficulties recognizing occluded tomato bunches, needing optimization of the loss function and model architecture. These studies underscore the need to tailor base models to address nuances like occlusion, illumination variation, and growth patterns unique to greenhouse environments. Beyond architectures, the training process must also account for greenhouse-specific factors. Models like those proposed by Cong et al. [100], Gang et al. [93], and Liu et al. [113] illustrate the benefits of customized training regimes using specialized greenhouse datasets over pre-trained networks. However, collecting exhaustive labelled greenhouse data can be challenging. Recent work by Moysiadis et al. [95] demonstrates the potential of simulated or synthetically augmented data for greenhouse model training. Such emerging data-centric solutions must be explored in combination with adapted model architectures. Overall, while deep learning has shown immense potential, realizing robust computer vision for greenhouses will require specialized model architectures and training techniques tailored to the unique intricacies of controlled environments ([92], [94], [98]). Greenhouse-specific networks, re-training regimes, augmented data, and continual optimization will be instrumental in developing computer vision solutions adept at the nuances of greenhouse conditions. C. Constraints in Computational Resources Many state-of-the-art techniques like Mask R-CNN are computationally intensive, making real-time deployment difficult given the constrained resources of embedded greenhouse systems ([111], [114]). Hardware devices in agricultural settings often have tight power budgets, restricting the complexity of models that can be run ([93], [116]). While cloud-based solutions can provide greater parallel processing power, sole reliance on the cloud introduces drawbacks like network latency, connectivity dependencies, and data privacy concerns. A balanced approach could be edge-cloud co-design, with lightweight models handling core functionality on-device while leveraging the cloud for more intensive computations. Still, optimizing models and inference pipelines for efficient execution on low-power devices remains a key challenge ([112], [117]). Research on extremely lightweight yet accurate architectures specialized for greenhouse conditions is imperative. D. Limited Integration of Diverse Sensing Modalities While most research relies solely on RGB images, other sensing modalities like hyperspectral imaging can provide valuable crop insights ([118], [119], [120]). However, techniques to integrate and fuse multi-modal data sources are still emergent. Capturing relationships between RGB, spectral, depth, thermal, and other data could significantly enhance model robustness and performance ([121], [122]). Developing sensor fusion methods and tailored multi-modal networks is an open research frontier. E. Shortage of Specialized and Interdisciplinary Talent The effective development and implementation of computer vision technologies for greenhouses require skilled professionals spanning multiple disciplines ([14], [103], [104], [105]). Emerging deep learning solutions rely heavily on the parallel computing capabilities of GPUs ([64]). To fully leverage these tools requires both computer vision and agriculture expertise ([93], [114]). However, there is a talent shortage with competencies and experience across these domains ([97], [99]). Computer vision involves diverse fields like image processing, machine learning, and pattern recognition ([14]). Integrating techniques from these areas into the complexities of greenhouse farming demands specialized interdisciplinary knowledge ([95], [108]). From researchers advancing scientific innovations to technicians managing real-world deployment, skilled personnel able to bridge computer vision and agriculture are imperative but lacking ([100], [106]). Closing this talent gap across computer science and agricultural engineering is vital to drive progress. Initiatives to support education, training, and collaboration across disciplines are critical to develop professionals that can effectively apply computer vision to transform greenhouse agriculture. In summary, major challenges like lack of sufficient labeled data, need for task-specific models, computational constraints, and limited multi-modality demonstrate that significant work remains to develop computer vision techniques adept at the nuances of greenhouse environments. Substantial progress has been made, but overcoming these areas through data generation, model optimization, efficient designs, and sensor fusion integration will be essential to realize the full potential of computer vision for smart greenhouse agriculture. SECTION VI. Conclusion This paper presented a focused analysis of recent advancements in applying computer vision and deep learning for greenhouse agriculture automation.

Introduction II. Background Study III. Materials and Methods IV. Conclusion V. Future Outlook Show Full Outline Authors Figures References Keywords Metrics Abstract: Medicinal plants play a vital role in treating human and livestock ailments. A majority of the population living across the world relies on medicinal plants as a primary source of healthcare. The rural as well as the urban habitats depend on medicinal plants. Medicinal plants may be of root type or shoot type. Onion is one of the root types of medicinal plants that has abundant health benefits as well as economic value. Due to increasing urbanization, the availability of agricultural land is decreasing rapidly which is causing an increase in the demand for medicinal plants in a reduced cultivation area. This has led to the cultivation of soilless smart precision farming methods. Sensors are used to monitor and control the environmental factors affecting the growth and yield of agricultural produce. Among all the vertical farming methods, hydroponics is found to be the best way for cultivating herbaceous plants. This article deals with the comparison of growth responses of hydroponically grown onion (Allium cepa) in a Deep-Water Culture setup, as compared to that cultivated in soil. A systematic literature survey of onion grown in a hydroponic cultivation system is carried out. Finally, the growth responses of hydroponic and soil-grown onions are checked and compared with the results obtained from the ‘AquaCrop’ simulator. Results of the actual and simulator are verified and validated, and it is found that the actual and the simulation results are similar. Flowchart of the proposed experiment. The growth responses of onion were monitored and compared in soil and hydroponic methods. Onion growth was found to be much faster a...View more Published in: IEEE Access ( Volume: 12) Page(s): 38202 - 38218 Date of Publication: 05 March 2024 Electronic ISSN: 2169-3536 DOI: 10.1109/ACCESS.2024.3373787 Publisher: IEEE Funding Agency: SECTION I. Introduction Agriculture has been identified as the backbone of the economy of India, which contributes to almost 18% of the Gross Domestic Product (GDP) and 43% of the geographical area [1]. The world population and urbanization are on an exponential hike, and the population is expected to exceed 9.8 billion by 2050 [2]. Urbanization is another unavoidable change that our society is going through. Various innovations and opportunities are brought about in modern society as a result of urbanization. This is resulting in the relocation of a huge mass of population towards the urban habitations, which in turn is causing increased traffic, pollution, industrialization, deforestation, increased pollution, soil erosion, etc. All these factors have caused a compromised lifestyle in urban habitats and an imbalance in the demand-supply ratio of agricultural produce [3]. The combined issue of decreasing cultivatable land and increasing demand for medicinal herbs is a major challenge being faced in the last few decades. This issue is effectively addressed by using alternate cultivation mediums in different vertical farming setups. Three types of soilless vertical farming setups are practiced to facilitate cultivation without soil: aeroponics, hydroponics, and aquaponics [4]. These farming methods resolve the issue of decreasing availability of cultivatable land, by eliminating the dependency on soil as the cultivation medium. The cultivation medium for aeroponics is air and that for hydroponics and aquaponics is water. All the nutrient requirements of the plant are sufficient by infusing the air or water with the nutrient solution. The possibility of damage due to pests and rodents is eliminated in the case of soilless cultivation methods. Diseases like fungal infection in plants also impose a huge loss in the agricultural sector which is still a possibility in soilless cultivation but the intensity of such losses is mitigated to less than 50% as compared to soil cultivation methods. This further enhances the productivity of the crops in soilless vertical farming methods [5]. Fig. 1 depicts the three major types of soilless cultivation methods. FIGURE 1. Types of soilless cultivation methods. Show All These setups consist of vertically stacked rows where cultivation is carried out, thus justifying the name ‘vertical farming’. Therefore, in a considerably small area, cultivated yield is increased multiple times because the cultivation is carried out in vertically stacked layers [6]. Though the issues of less land for cultivation, and an increase in demand for medicinal plants can be addressed, another major issue comes up when it comes to dedicating time to the farming process. Urban people follow hectic work schedules and vertical farming methods need continuous monitoring for the better yield and efficient working of the process. This issue was then resolved by making the vertical farming setups smart [6]. Sensors, microcontrollers, clouds, LED, buzzers, pumps, actuators, etc. are attached to the vertical system which helps in continuous monitoring of the system, making it smarter and more efficient. All the parameters are monitored by using specific sensors, which communicate with the cloud for analysis and further actions are taken according to the analysis of the real-time data generated from the sensors. This method is termed smart precision farming. Providing all the necessary growing conditions to plants externally, in smart precision farming is termed as Controlled environment agriculture (CEA). CEA along with vertical farming methods ensures all the optimal required conditions for the medicinal plant to produce the maximum yield in a comparatively shorter vegetation period and minimal loss due to damage. Thus, sustainable, year-round, qualitative produce is ensured along with multiplied quantity [7]. Apart from the increasing demand for various agricultural produce, the demand for cultivation of medicinal plants is also increasing at an exponential pace. The potential of the cultivation of medicinal plants like onion, has to be maximized to meet the continuous qualitative and quantitative demands of rural and urban habitats. Rural habitats have a very high dependency on the cultivation and production of medicinal plants due to several reasons like lack of modern health facilities, cultural priorities and beliefs, cost of modern drugs, etc. Medicinal plants have a very high impact on the lives of the urban habitats too due to their healing properties. Some vertical farming method enhances shoot growth whereas other enhances root growth [8]. The cultivation of herbaceous medicinal plants has to be ensured in such a way of precision vertical farming, that the part of the plant used for medicinal use, has a better growth response than that in the substrate cultivation methods. Therefore, the growth responses of various herbaceous medicinal plants need to be checked for different precision farming methods to identify the best-suited method that gives a year-round and better qualitative and quantitative yield [9]. The year-round production of herbaceous medicinal plants will not only enhance the economic benefit but also ensure the year-round availability of medicinal herbs for living beings. The reasons like compromised, unhealthy lifestyles caused by hectic work schedules, and increased pollution in the lifestyles of the urban population are causing a lot of health issues and other ailments. Commercially available medicines and modern treatments also cause severe side effects. Medicinal plants are thus, the most trusted source of medications that cure illnesses without having adverse effects on the health of the individual. One such important medicinal plant is Allium cepa, commonly known as onion. Apart from being a widely used condiment plant around the world, it also has many medicinal benefits [10], [11]. Dried onions come in the form of powder and can be used as spices. Onions are overloaded with Vitamin B, vitamin C, calcium, phosphorous, etc., and can also be used to extract oil [10]. Many of its constituents like thiosulphates, phenolic acids, and quercetin contribute to its therapeutic effects [12]. Many disorders, such as asthma, inflammation, scars, pain, wounds, etc. are effectively treated by onion. It is also found to possess important pharmacological properties like anti-cancer, anti-hypertensive, anti-spasmodic, anti-diarrheal, and anti-diabetics along with being effective for bones, nervous systems, cardiovascular systems, respiratory disorders, etc. The three basic utility areas of onions are shown in Fig. 2. FIGURE 2. Major utilities of onion. Show All Onion cultivation also plays a pivotal role in boosting the economy of many nations like China, Egypt, Nepal, Turkey, Afghanistan, and various regions of India [11], [12]. It is cultivated in huge amounts in many Indian states, making India one of the leading producers of onions [10], [13], [14], [15]. India is recorded to produce around 21% of the total onion production of the world, which is led by China with around 26% of the global onion production. To reach the zenith of economic growth from agricultural production, cultivation of economically potent crops like onion. The qualitative yield of onions can be enhanced by monitoring the environmental conditions, which can be easily achieved by using Internet of Things (IoT) sensors. Onion is the major medicinal food crop that is exported among vegetables in India. revenues as large as Rs. 222,70.3 million had been generated from exporting onions in 2015 which has increased to Rs. 523.8 million in 2022 [14]. India is the second leading exporter of onion after China. Cultivation and export of high-quality onion can form the basis for improving the Indian economy. Traditional cultivation methods have unlimited limitations, like risks, demand-supply mismatch, poor soil quality, and lesser arable land, that cause a hindrance towards onion cultivation thus leading to an adverse effect on the Indian economy [10], [12], [15]. Concerning the significant boost in the Indian economy from onion export and the continuously decreasing farming land and natural resources, there is a dire need to enhance the cultivation of onions. This can be achieved by prioritizing precision farming techniques using hydroponics to cultivate onions. IoT is a vast network of smart devices that connects things to people anytime, and anywhere [16], [17]. These systems are capable of making decisions with minimal human interference and thus, make systems faster, smarter, and more efficient [18]. The number of connected smart devices encompassing IoTs has increased drastically and is further predicted to surpass 43 billion by 2023, making them a part of almost every application [19]. One of the major areas of application of IoT is agriculture. It forms the backbone of smart precision farming. Hydroponics is a method of smart precision farming which practices soilless cultivation, by using nutrient-rich water as the cultivation medium for plants [20]. Out of all the vertical farming methods, hydroponics outperforms the rest in terms of increased yield, lesser cost, easier maintenance, feasibility in various scenarios, water consumption, environmental sustainability, and wider adaptability. The hydroponic cultivation method is much more scalable than the other vertical farming methods because it can be modified and scaled according to the adaptability of the herbs to be cultivated. It comprises different setups to adapt to various types of plants. Some of the most popular types are nutrient film technique (NFT), ebb and flow, deep water culture (DWC), drip system, and wick system [21], [22], [23], [24], [25], [26]. Thus, smart precision farming in hydroponics is the key solution to all the issues of urban farming, including increased year-round qualitative and quantitative food demand. Fig. 3 represents the various types of hydroponic setups. FIGURE 3. Various types of hydroponic setups. Show All The selection of hydroponic technique out of all the five types listed above is dependent upon many factors, such as plant height, structure, irrigation needs, root anatomy, vegetation cycle, etc. DWC is considered to be the best-suited setup for the hydroponic cultivation of onions due to the compatibility with various growing requirements of onions as well as the cost and feasibility of establishing and maintaining the setup. In [27], the author carried out two experiments of centrosema, stylosanthes, trifolium, and lotus cultivation in soil medium, and the effect of vesicular-arbuscular mycorrhiza on the cultivation was studied in various compositions of soil nutrients. The results showed the total fresh weight, root/shoot ratio, and the percentage of mycorrhizal infection. In [28], the authors have carried out the growth response analysis of cucumber and the effect on its growth using the T-203 strain of the biocontrol agent Trichoderma harzianum in soil and axenic hydroponic conditions. In [29], soybean cultivation was carried out in controlled soilless conditions using four different nutrient concentrations, i.e. 0%, 50%, 100%, and 150%. The results showed significant variations in growth and all the measured parameters under these different conditions. The root thrived the most in 50% nutrient concentration, whereas the shoot growth was maximum in 150% concentration of nutrients. Three growth mediums i.e. cork thin waste with rice hulls, peat, and coir fiber were compared in three soilless cultivation methods, and the microbial influence, pH, and EC were analyzed in [30]. In [31], two varieties of lettuce were cultivated to analyze their growth on different types of media in a wick system of hydroponics using three mediums: cocopeat, Rockwool, and charcoal, whereby it was found that charcoal husk showed the best cultivation results. Rice was cultivated in a hydroponic setup and the effect of sodium and potassium chloride was analyzed in [32]. The rice seedling shoot was sensitive to KCL. In [35], different nitrogen sources were supplied to lettuce from two sources, one source with 200 ppm NO 3–N, and the other with 150 ppm NO 3–N and 50 ppm NH 4+-N. The highest growth was recorded using 200 ppm NO 3–N. The authors of [36] have cultivated legumes called Serra Della in aluminum-toxic soil to conclude that AI tolerance varies among various cultivars. In [24], a certain variety of lily is cultivated in an ebb-and-flow system of hydroponic cultivation where statistical analyses showed no correlation between the weights of the initial and the final bulblets. Elongation of roots and growth and survival of bulblets were dependent upon the hydroponic setup, the substrate type, and the composition of the nutrients in the solution medium. ‘Rubinela’ lettuce was cultivated in soil-filled pots and hydroponic systems by the authors of [38] where the research aimed to analyze its physiology through a comparative analysis of dry and fresh mass, production, leaf count, chlorophyll, and carotenoid contents. It was found that the hydroponic plants showed prominent variations in chlorophyll content, with more biomass than those grown in soil. In [39], the authors built an innovative hydroponic fuel cell to reduce methane emissions from rice plants. Rice was cultivated in a hydroponic setup where the results show that the methane emission was significantly reduced with the use of these cells. The effect of actinomycetes on hydroponic lettuce was studied in [40], where it was found that mitigation of detrimental effects in various growth parameters was found using Streptomyces thermocarboxydus S3 type of actinomycete. In [25], the authors have grown basil in soil and hydroponics, where the hydroponic basils had more browning than hydroponic ones at the end of storage and shelf-life periods. An IoT-based smart NFT setup was created in [26] where various environmental parameters were collected in a Raspberry Pi database. A Proteus simulator was also used for analyzing the results, where a “very good” rating was given to the implemented device. The authors of [41] propose a method to combine the theoretical and practical of aquaponic and hydroponic farms by modeling and simulating the systems. Petri nets were used for modeling and the GPenSIM tool was used for the simulation and monitoring. Support vector regression (SVR) was also used to predict the temperatures of air water and humidity. The research in [42], investigates the economic and technical feasibility of greenhouses in arid regions on a larger scale, where the results demonstrate that these systems have a massive potential to show considerable climate resilience which helps to enable vegetation in arid and infertile regions. The following research gaps have been identified from the background study regarding growth response analysis of medicinal plants: Growth responses of various herbaceous plants have been compared in previous studies, but very little research is focused particularly on the cultivation and yield enhancement of medicinal herbs [27], [28], [29], [30], [31], [32], [35], [36]. Medicinal herbs add to the essential nutrient contents in edible products of humans and livestock. Herbal medicines are also preferred over the chemical medicines available commercially because they are devoid of harmful side effects. Medicinal herbs eliminate food security issues and ensure healthy lifestyles in rural and urban habitats. Thus, the need of the hour is to enhance the cultivation and yield of medicinal plants. In the existing research works, either the root [24], [35], [36], [37] or the shoot growth responses are monitored [25], [28], [38], [39], [40] not both. The comparative growth responses of any plant are carried out only in any one medium, growth responses in multiple mediums are not analyzed for a single plant [24], [28], [30], [31], [32], [33], [34], [35], [36]. Either the growth responses of a plant are analyzed in actual cultivation [27], [28], [29], [30], [31], [32], [35], [36], [42] or the analysis is done using the simulator, the incorporation of both methods in a single experiment is not found [26], [41], [42]. This research focuses on the analysis based on actual experimentation as well as results obtained from the ‘AquaCrop’ simulator. The present investigation was guided by the formulation of the following research questions: Which hydroponic setup is most suitable for growing herbaceous medicinal bulbs? What is the comparative growth analysis for the growth of onions in traditional and hydroponic methods? How relatable are the actual results as compared to the simulator results? Which method is more beneficial, in terms of environmental footprint, expenses, and yield of the medicinal plant under consideration? Which method is more effective in terms of energy consumption? The novelty of this research lies in the fact that a real-time comparative analysis of root as well as shoot growth responses of onion, a medicinal plant, is carried out in this experiment. The experimental results are then verified and validated using a simulator. Very few works have focused on the better qualitative and quantitative yield of the root as well as the shoot of any medicinal plant [27], [28], [29], [30], [31], [32], [35], [36]. Some of the research works focus on only the root [24], [35], [36], [37] or only the shoot of any plant [25], [28], [38], [39], [40]. This work demonstrates the root and shoot growth responses of a medicinal plant (onion) having abundant medicinal properties in its shoot as well as its root. Also in previous works, the growth responses have been analyzed on any one method of cultivation [24], [28], [30], [31], [32], [33], [34], [35], [36], whereas the authors have considered the analysis of root and shoot growth response comparison in soil cultivation as well as in hydroponics. No previous work includes the verification and validation of the actual results with the simulator results, either the actual cultivation is carried out [27], [28], [29], [30], [31], [32], [35], [36], [42] or the simulation is carried out [26], [41], [42] not both. All these aspects are incorporated in this research work where the actual cultivation results in soil as well as hydroponics are verified and validated with the results of the ‘AquaCrop’ simulator. The main objective of the research is to enhance productivity and obtain a better qualitative and quantitative yield of onion in a shorter span, all round the year. Thus, the results of this research will be helpful for the agricultural, medical, as well as economic benefit of any nation. The major contributions of this research article are mentioned as follows: The necessity and importance of soilless cultivation methods in modern urban localities are discussed in terms of various parameters. The authors have highlighted the advantages of soilless cultivation over soil cultivation methods in terms of better, faster, and year-round yield. Parameters like space optimization, resource conservation, increased year-round yield, and shorter vegetation period are considered for a comparative analysis of hydroponic and soil cultivation methods in this research. The emerging need to cultivate medicinal plants via vertical farming methods is explained in context to the nutritional components and medicinal properties of onion shoots and roots. The effect of onion cultivation on the economy of India is also discussed, which adds to its importance as one of the majorly exported medicinal food crops. In this research, various types of hydroponic setups are discussed. The workings and components of a smart hydroponic setup are also explained. Out of the five most popular classifications of hydroponic setups, DWC is identified as the most suitable setup for the cultivation of onion. Classification of various types of medicinal plants is done based on their medicinal properties in their roots and shoots. The trend of using medicinal plants in India is also shown along with the trend of IoT and sensor-enabled hydroponics in the last year. Onion bulbs are cultivated in the soil as well as in DWC hydroponics. The growth responses of onion shoots, roots, and bulbs are monitored, analyzed, and compared in qualitative and quantitative terms. The obtained results are also verified and validated using the ‘AquaCrop’ simulator in both mediums. The rest of the paper is organized as: section II covers the extensive background study regarding smart hydroponic farming, medicinal plants, and onion as a medicinal plant. Section III encompasses the materials and methods employed in the process of this experiment, and the results and discussions are projected in Section IV. Finally, the article is concluded in Section V. SECTION II. Background Study This section deals with the extensive literature studied concerning smart hydroponic farming methods associated with the cultivation of onions. Three subsections are created to present a detailed overview of each aspect. The first subsection deals with the study of the hydroponic method of smart precision farming, and the second subsection gives a detailed overview of various types and classifications of medicinal plants. The third and final subsection of this topic deals specifically with the importance of onion as a medicinal plant, its growing period, and its cultivation in smart hydroponic setups. A. Hydroponic Type of Smart Precision Farming Hydroponic type of precision agriculture is the agricultural process that uses water as the cultivation medium and inputs the precise values of the agricultural conditions to the system to obtain the best possible yield with the use of IoTs [43]. The IoT usage makes the system more intelligent and self-sustaining, thus consuming less time and effort for the farmer along with enhancing the cultivated produce [3]. Fig. 4 explains the working of a smart precision hydroponic setup. The smart hydroponic farm is integrated with the cloud to analyze sensor data and the farmer can monitor and control the farm remotely. This will help serve the multiple purposes of having a healthier living, a cleaner surrounding environment, easy and handy cultivation methods, domestic as well as economic benefits to the cultivators, etc. FIGURE 4. Working with a smart precision hydroponic setup. Show All A fully automatized greenhouse integrated with the hydroponic type of vertical farming ensuring provisions for security and surveillance is proposed which makes it an advanced and diverse form of all the existing models. It is observed to provide an improved product with a cent percent success rate, maintaining the ranges of the parameters [44]. An automatic aeroponic system of cultivation for lettuce while keeping the humidity, time taken for irrigation, temperature, etc. in control and spraying the nutrient mist to the plant root, is proposed as a cost-effective Arduino-based system using IoT [45]. IoT tools connected to a web server help in monitoring the variables remotely. As compared to the traditional processes of cultivation, lettuce leaves as well as roots grew more than 40% with around 400% better performance, had been recorded [46]. The system designed in this study is capable of keeping healthy growing parametric conditions for the crops automatically, irrespective of the prevailing climatic conditions, and with minimum user interference. It shows the temporal variations, light intensity variations, temperature, humidity, electrical conductivity, pH, and CO2. To show better vigilance in a hydroponic setup, the system even monitors the level of water in the storage. Smart cooling is ensured of lettuce roots in the smart aeroponic setup for lettuce cultivation. The temperature and humidity data are also retrieved in [47]. Cost-effectiveness is maintained using a fan that is connected to the Arduino board to ensure continuous data recording. An application for mobile phones is employed to get the data. An Excel sheet is updated and kept and updated every week by the farm owner. This increased the lettuce growth and also the inorganic nutrients absorbed by the plant [48]. Role of IoT to control the growth and communication of alerts to the user using web applications. The controlled plants are found to show better growth responses than those cultivated in an uncontrolled environment and also there are fewer unwanted values in the case of controlled growth of plants. The growth responses of plants are shown as a figure on the website app and the values violating the preset ranges can be identified conveniently and efficiently. Subsequently, the farm owners are notified, and thereby minimum losses are incurred by activating the alternative control measures present in the system [49]. To improve the efficiency of hydroponic cultivation, Electrical conductivity (EC), fluid level, total dissolved solids (TDS), and the potential of Hydrogen (pH) values are controlled automatically. Facilitation data collected continuously, from a large number of sensors, in urban farms, a system is developed for adjusting the pH value automatically, and in the cultivation of lettuce using a neural network is developed to facilitate continuous data collection from multiple sensors in urban farm conditions [50]. A study based on image processing is put forth to check the percentage of deficit of macronutrients in a hydroponic environment [51]. Determination of a lack of macronutrients can be done in multiple phases such as acquisition and pre-processing of images, feature extraction, image segmentation, task identification, and estimation. IoT is used to process image data acquisition automatically. The plant under consideration in [52] is chili. The main feature of this research work is to improve the output of the precision agricultural methods, three of the features were combined in the form of the texture, color, and shape of the leaf. This study is also focused on estimating various plant condition types like a deficit of nutrients like Sulphur, calcium, potassium, magnesium, etc., or a healthy plant condition. A model is aimed to be built that is capable of performing identification as well as estimation. Along with analyzing multiple nutrients. B. Types of Medicinal Plants With Medicinal Values in Various Parts Medicinal plants have always held major importance in the lives of all living beings [53]. Various parts of the medicinal plants are put to use in various ways. In plants like ginger, turmeric, burdock, and ginseng, roots have medicinal properties of antioxidants, anti-tumor, enhanced immune system, etc. [52], [55], [59], whereas in plants like basil and thyme, the leaves have medicinal properties of liver detoxifier, disinfectant, reliever of the wound, kidney stones, muscle aches, etc. [25], and in plants like lavender and saffron, the flowers contain medicinal values of stress, pain and anxiety reliever, helpful in Alzheimer disease and depression [57], [58]. The vertical precision farming methods are best suited for herbs and thus, the herbaceous medicinal plants must be analyzed in terms of the smart precision vertical farming method that suits them the best [53]. A generalized answer to this question cannot be found because each medicinal plant has a different part that is put to use for its medicinal value. Thus, the plants whose roots are used for medicinal purposes would need a different precision vertical farming method whereas the plants whose leaves or flowers or any other part of the shoot would need a different method of precision vertical farming method for it to thrive to the fullest. Fig. 5 is a representation of examples of herbaceous medicinal plants with various parts having medicinal properties. FIGURE 5. Examples of herbaceous plants with medicinal values. Show All Every medicinal plant has medicinal properties in different parts of the plant. Some plants have medicinal properties in the shoot part (stem, leaves, fruits, or flowers), and some may have medicinal properties in the root part. Lettuce and barley are examples of medicinal leaves, whereas tomato and broccoli are medicinal fruits. Garlic and onions are seen to have medicinal values in their bulb roots, and ginger and ginseng are examples of roots that contain medicinal properties. Thus, to employ the vertical farming method for herbaceous medicinal plants, the part of the plant containing the medicinal properties needs to be identified [54]. Thereafter, a suitable cultivation method can be used to cultivate the identified plant and a smart precision farming method can be used to cultivate it. The authors of [55] tested the growth of medicinal plants in aeroponics and hydroponics whereby no significant variation is seen in the shoot growth characteristics of the plants. The ginseng roots contain healing properties which makes it very important to maintain its root quality. Rotting of roots is a major disease-causing deterioration of ginseng root quality. The authors in [56] proposed a way to detect the disease-causing rotting of roots by checking the colored images of the plant through image processing and deep learning. The authors in [57] checked three categories of medicinal herbs in multiple hydroponic setups and one aeroponic setup. Post that results comparisons are done with plants grown in substrate medium, with exactly similar environmental conditions. An innovative frame of aeroponic setup was formed in [58] to enhance the produced quality of Burdock root (Arctium lappa L.) cultivated in an aeroponic method in a controlled soilless greenhouse environment. The production of biomass from the aerial parts of the plant was found to be considerably high in an aeroponic setup as compared to the controlled cases. Whereas the biomass yields of the root of the plant did not exhibit any significant variations between treatments. The authors in [52] and [59] found that hydroponic techniques are optimal in reproducibly and efficiently generating the medicinal herb Withania somnifera (L.). Fig. 6 shows the Google trend plots showing interest and trends in smart hydroponic farming of onion over the past 12 months, specifically in India. The trends of Onion and IoT are increasing at a very fast pace. FIGURE 6. Plot obtained from Google trends showing the trend of medicinal plants, IoTs, sensors, and hydroponics in India for the past year. Show All C. Onion (Allium CEPA) Onion is a category of medicinal plant that has medicinal properties in its shoot as well as in its bulb. Onion can be cultivated in three seasons, namely, Rabi, Kharif, and Late Kharif. Table 1 is a tabular representation of the various growing seasons of onion. The production cycle of onion, if shortened, can be advantageous to mankind in multifold ways [12], [13], [15]. TABLE 1 Production Cycle of Onion Apart from being loaded with vitamins, minerals, and other beneficial medicinal, pharmacological, and therapeutic properties, onions are also loaded with several nutritional components. It has the capability of curing various ailments and health disorders. The authors of [10], [13], and [15] have come up with the amount of nutritional components per 100 grams of the edible portion of onion. Energy, carbohydrates, sugars, fibre, fat, protein, various vitamins, calcium, iron, manganese, phospsorous, and potassium are the major component found in onion. Table 2 is a generalized representation of the nutritional contents contained in the edible portion of onion. TABLE 2 Nutritional Components Per 100 Grams, in the Edible Portion of Onion SECTION III. Materials and Methods This section deals with the materials used in the cultivation of onion bulbs in soil as well as in water mediums. Onion is the medicinal plant selected as the experimental subject in this experiment because it contains medicinal value in its shoot as well as in its bulb. Onion thrives well in water as well as soil mediums. This experiment comprises the cultivation of onion bulbs in in substrate medium and DWC hydroponic system, a comparative analysis of their growth responses, and validation of the obtained results with the results obtained from the ‘AquaCrop’ simulator. The soil was prepared for onion cultivation by adding sand and compost and making it moist. Onion bulbs were slit from the top and planted in soil in a way that ample space is maintained between the onion bulbs to ensure proper root and shoot growth. The water used for onion cultivation was infused with essential nutrients as mentioned in Table 2. The growth responses of onion were monitored and compared in soil and hydroponic methods. Onion growth was found to be much faster and more qualitative in water as compared to its growth in soil. Fig. 7 represents the flowchart of the overall framework of the experimental work done in the experiment. FIGURE 7. Flowchart of the proposed experiment. Show All The input parameters of soil and DWC cultivation were set in the ‘AquaCrop’ simulator separately and the experimental results were then verified and validated through the results obtained from the simulator. The comparative analysis of onion growth was thus carried out in an actual experimental setup as well as in the ‘AquaCrop’ simulator. The substrate cultivation has to be carried out when the weather conditions are favorable for its growth, whereas, in the smart DWC hydroponic cultivation, the cultivation can be done at any time of the year because all the environmental conditions and the nutrient requirements can be monitored in real-time and controlled as per the requirements of the plant. This ensures year-round qualitative and quantitative produce. The DWC hydroponic method uses a specific setup where the roots of the plants are submerged in nutrient-rich water. The pH, EC, and nutrient content of the growing medium are monitored continuously for any alteration, and the nutrient-infused water is also changed periodically to ensure proper nutrient intake by the plants. A smart DWC setup carries out the additional task of maintaining a CEA in the cultivation system whereby the pH, temperature, TDS, and other essential parameters are controlled externally. Onion plants have medicinal properties in their shoot as well as in their bulbs. The onion shoots grow much faster and can be harvested sometimes before the onion bulbs are developed and harvested. Till the time the shoots are thick and green at the base, they can be harvested repeatedly. Once the shoot dries up and wilts from the base, the bulbs are ready to be harvested. Onion bulbs were planted simultaneously in a DWC hydroponic setup and soil medium. The growth responses of onion root and shoot were compared in both the mediums and it was verified and validated with the results obtained from the ‘AquaCrop’ simulator. A. Controlled Parameters for Optimal Onion Growth Many researches have proved that the cultivation of onions under controlled environmental conditions has produced enhanced and uniform shoot growth and bulb formation of onion plants. Onions were cultivated simultaneously in a smart DWC setup and soil. Soil cultivation is dependent on the natural resources and climatic conditions, thus it has to be carried out in the season which suits its requirements, whereas the cultivation in a smart DWC setup can be carried out at any time of the year. A low relative humidity and high-temperature help in enhancing the shoot and bulb growth of onions, whereas a high relative humidity causes fungal and bacterial growth on the onion bulbs. Fig. 8 (a) is a picture of fungus fungus-inflicted onion bulb, and Fig. 8 (b) shows the root growth of the fungus-infected onion bulb in the DWC hydroponic setup. FIGURE 8. (a) Fungus-inflicted onion bulb. (b) Root growth of n inflicted onion bulb in hydroponics. Show All The life cycle of onion is also affected by temperature fluctuations. Higher temperatures cause early bulb development in onions, therefore ensuring precise temperature while studying various growth phases of onion cultivation is important. The light source used in the experiment was natural sunlight for optimum daylight. B. Pests and Disease Control Onion bulbs are prone to fly infestation and fungal infections. Cultivation of onions under controlled environmental conditions ensures minimized damage due to pest and disease infestations. These pests and diseases must be managed efficiently with continuous monitoring of the system, especially in greenhouses. A few precautions to be taken while cultivating in any controlled environment can be mentioned: Maintaining cleanliness in and around the growing area. The substrate mix must be kept tightly sealed before and after use to avoid drying up or infestation. Use preferable new potting units or sterilized, washed with the bleach solution, and rinsed thoroughly. Using insect repellants or sticky insect traps for real-time control of fly and pest infestations. Dead, wilted, or damaged plants must be removed from the setup regularly to ensure the safety of the other plants in the setup. Diseased and weak plants are more prone to infections. C. Smart DWC Hydroponics Setup A representation of the commonly used components of an IoT-enabled smart precision agriculture setup is depicted in Fig. 9. The smart precision agriculture setup is equipped with a sensor module and an actuator module. A microcontroller acts as an interface between the entire hardware system and the cloud or the communication gateway. The sensor module collects data on various parameters. All the sensors are preset with a particular range. The data collected in real-time is then sent to the cloud for analysis [60]. If any value is found to drop below the lower limit of the set range or exceed the upper value of the range, the user or the farm owner will be notified of the situation. FIGURE 9. Components of an IoT-enabled smart precision agriculture setup. Show All If the setup is well equipped with actuators, corresponding alternative arrangements could also be activated to get the data value of the sensors in range to regain the smooth functioning of the smart precision farming setup. The fact that the cultivation is done in a CEA setup, ensures high-quality, year-round produce which eliminates the dependency on climatic conditions and thus reduces wastage or damage in agricultural produce to a large extent [61], [62], [63]. Fig. 10 is a pictorial representation of the components of a smart DWC setup. The components of the setup can be broadly classified into two categories: hardware components and software components. The hardware components can be further classified into two subcategories: sensor module and actuator module. FIGURE 10. Various components of the smart DWC setup are used. Show All The sensor module is responsible for collecting real-time data on the parameters that are controlled in the setup. Sensors to monitor temperature, pH, water level, and humidity are deployed in the system to collect real-time data on the respective parameters. Every sensor is provided with the permissible parametric range, and the values collected by the sensors are then sent to the cloud for analysis. If the values are found to violate the specified range, the actuators are instructed to facilitate the situation. Actuators are hardware components like fans, water pumps, nutrient pumps, buzzers, etc. that are used to keep the parametric values within the range. This is very helpful to the urban habitats that perform vertical farming, where they can have a remote check on the farm and the system takes care of the farm. Fig. 11 shows the various hardware components used in the smart DWC setup. The hardware components used in the setup can be described as: Temperature sensor: According to the requirement of onion, the temperature sensor was set with a range of 29°C – 32°C. The Arduino microcontroller board receives the real-time temperature values collected by the temperature sensor and analyses the values concerning the specified range. If the recorded temperature is beyond 32°C, the fans are activated and the temperature is lowered. When the temperature comes within the range, the fan is switched off. The experiment was carried out in August – September when the temperature did not fall too low. Thus, the lower level of temperature was maintained. pH sensor: The pH value is set to 6.0 – 6.4. If at any moment, the pH value drops below 6.0, sodium carbonate (Na2CO3) is added to the mater medium, alternatively if the pH rises above 6.4, nitric acid (HNO3) is added to the growing medium to balance the pH of water. Humidity sensor: A minimum of 66 % and a maximum of 70 % humidity is suitable for growth of onion. More than 70% humidity causes fungal infestations on the bulbs of onion which hampers the proper growth of onion shoots. The humidity sensor monitors the humidity and sends the collected value to the microcontroller. If the humidity rises above 70 %, the fans are used to circulate dry air, and if the humidity falls below 60%, the mist spray is activated to increase the humidity and bring it within the range. Water level sensor: The DWC setup has a stagnant nutrient solution in which the roots of the plant are submerged. The water level of the cultivation units has to be maintained to a level where there is a little gap between the water level and the lid of the box to ensure space for vapor. CO2 and O2 sensors: Both CO2 and O2 are required in the nutrient solution for the optimal growth and development of the hydroponic plant. These sensors notify the users if the CO2 level exceeds 900 ppm or the O2 level drops below 18%. The nutrient solution of the DWC setup is then replaced with a fresh one. Buzzer and LED display: These hardware components in the smart DWC hydroponic system help in facilitating continuous monitoring of the system and send alerts in case of any unwanted situation. A smart DWC hydroponic setup implementing CEA is used for cultivating onions for this experiment. Table 3 shows the optimal parametric ranges required by onions in a DWC hydroponic system and their corresponding values or ranges [10], [12], [15]. TABLE 3 Parameters and Their Permissible Ranges for Growth of Onion in a DWC Hydroponic System FIGURE 11. Various hardware components are used in the smart DWC setup. (a) LED; (b) Insect Trap; (c) Mist Spray; (d) Temperature Sensor. Show All A static nitrogen-rich nutrient solution is provided as the cultivation medium for the onions. The culture unit used in this experiment consists of plastic boxes. Each of the boxes has a capacity of 1 L of the nutrient solution. Holes of 1 – 1.5 cm diameter were drilled in the center of the lids of each of the boxes, and 4 other holes of 0.5 cm diameter were drilled around it as shown in Fig. 12. FIGURE 12. Onion bulbs are planted in boxes filled with nutrient-mixed solution. Show All The bigger hole was for the onion to immerse its roots in the nutrient solution inside the box, and the four smaller holes were drilled to ensure proper ventilation and release of heat from the inside of the box. Onions can be harvested as immature spring onions or full-grown bulbs. To ensure proper growing space for each of the onion bulbs, all the onions were planted in separate boxes. The onion bulbs were planted at the end of July. The nutrient solution was changed every week to ensure proper nutrition to the plants and avoid algae formation inside the boxes. Fig. 13 depicts a case where algae formation was found at the bottom of the hydroponic container. A pH level of 5.8 to 6.9 and an EC level of 1.4 to 1.8 was maintained throughout the cultivation process. FIGURE 13. Algae formation at the bottom of the container. Show All D. Substrate Cultivation The onion needs a substrate that has a good aeration and water retention capacity. Sandy or heavy soil types are the most suitable soil types for onion cultivation. garden soil, sand, and compost are mixed to make the growing medium ready for onion cultivation. The moisture retention capacity determines the frequency of watering. The moist substrate is one of the important requirements for the healthy growth of onions. The stage of plant development along with the relative humidity and temperature maintained in the growth chamber determines the frequency of watering the plants. Growing stages require more frequent watering as compared to the maturity stage. The onion bulbs were cultivated at the end of July when an average temperature of 22 – 38 °C temperature was prevailing in the Punjab region. An average relative humidity of 60 – 70 % prevailed in the region during the mentioned period. A tabular representation of the necessary parameters for cultivating onions in soil is shown in Table 4 [10], [12], [15]. TABLE 4 Parameters and Their Permissible Ranges for Growth of Onion in Soil Medium Fig. 14 (a) shows plastic trays of dimensions ( 20×15 ) cm filled with soil and 4 onion bulbs uniformly planted in it. Optimum distribution of air and water was ensured to maximize the growth of the plants. Regular watering is done in the soil using distilled water to prevent algae growth on the soil surface. Colorless plastic trays were used to ensure proper passing of light to the onion roots. Also, dark-colored pots absorb much heat and cause damage to the plants. FIGURE 14. Cultivation of onion bulbs in soil. (a) Onion bulbs planted in soil; (b) LED depicting NPK contents in soil. Show All Fig. 14 (b) is a picture of an instance where the LED displays the N, P, and K percentages in the soil. E. Results and Discussions The utility of onion in culinary, medicinal, and economic aspects, is discussed in the introduction section of the manuscript, which highlights its importance and the necessity for its better and enhanced yield. Apart from having a wide range of medicinal, therapeutic, and pharmacological properties, onion also contains various nutrients in its bulbs and shoots as mentioned in table 2 of the background study. It also plays a significant role in boosting the economy of India by being one of the majorly exported medicinal plants. Keeping in view all these aspects, the onion is selected for this research, and its root, shoot, and bulb growth in soil and DWC hydroponics are monitored, analyzed, and compared. Furthermore, the actual cultivation results are verified and validated with the results of the ‘AquaCrop’ simulator. The analysis of resulting growth responses of onion cultivated in soil and a smart DWC hydroponics is done in this section. The growth responses of onion shoot, root as well and bulb are analyzed based on the experiment conducted, and qualitative as well as quantitative yield analysis of the obtained yield is carried out. The obtained results were finally compared and validated with the results obtained from the simulator. The growth responses of shoot, root, and bulb in DWC hydroponics are found to outperform those in the soil cultivation method. F. Growth Comparison of Onion Shoots and Roots in Soil and DWC Hydroponics Onion bulbs were cultivated in the soil as well as in a DWC hydroponic setup. The plant with the best shoot growth is considered for the comparative analysis. In all the cases, the hydroponic roots and shoots showed the best growth responses as compared to soil cultivation. It is observed that the maximum length of onion shoot in hydroponics was found to reach 21.5 cm, whereas the maximum onion shoot length attained in soil medium was 16 cm. As a result, the hydroponics proved to give almost 74.4 % better shoot yield as compared to soil. The root length obtained in the DWC hydroponic method was also found to be 21.43 % better and much faster as compared to that in soil. The graph in Fig. 15 is a comparative plot of the maximum shoot and root length of onion bulbs in water and soil mediums. FIGURE 15. Growth analysis of onion shoot and root growth cultivated in substrate and hydroponics. Show All G. Day-Wise Growth Comparison of Onion Shoots in Soil and DWC Hydroponics Fig. 16 (a) and (b) show the onion shoot measurement on day 15 of cultivation in soil and DWC hydroponics respectively. The growth of the onion shoot was found to be better in hydroponics than in soil. FIGURE 16. Shoot growth from onion bulbs on day 15 after planting. (a) Onion shoot growth in soil; (b) Onion shoot growth in water. Show All The plot in Fig. 17 demonstrates the growth trend of onion shoots in soil and water mediums. The lengths of the best sample of both the cases are considered and the day-wise graph is plotted. This graph proves that the DWC method of cultivation produces approximately 1.3 times better yield in less than half the number of days as compared to the results obtained when cultivated in a soil medium. FIGURE 17. The day-wise plot of onion shoot lengths in soil and hydroponic methods respectively. Show All Therefore, in response to RQ. 1, it can be answered that the DWC hydroponics method is the best for the cultivation of herbaceous medicinal bulbs. H. Day-Wise Growth Comparison of Onion Roots in Soil and DWC Hydroponic Fig. 18 shows the picture of roots developed in both methods of cultivation on the fourth day after cultivation. it is visible that the root growth in the soil medium is considerably lesser than that in the water medium. FIGURE 18. Root growth of onion bulbs on day 4 after planting. (a) Onion root growth in soil; (b) Onion root growth in water. Show All The maximum root length recorded in soil medium was 9 cm whereas that recorded in water was 13 cm. The concept of analyzing the qualitative and quantitative comparison of the shoot, root as well as bulb growth characteristics of a medicinal plant with high economic value (onion), cultivated in water as well as in substrate mediums, which are further, verified and validated using simulator results in the same experiment, contribute to the novelty of this research. I. Onion Bulb Formation from Bulbs Cultivated in Soil and DWC Hydroponics Fig. 19 depicts the bulb formation of onions in soil and hydroponics systems respectively. The quality of bulbs is found to be much better than that formed in soil and also the time required by the onion bulb to produce newer bulbs in soil medium is almost more than double the time taken by the hydroponic onion. FIGURE 19. Onion bulb formation. (a) Onion bulb formation in soil; (b) Onion bulb formation in water. Show All Thus, as a response to RQ. 2, it can be concluded that in all three cases, i.e., shoot growth, root growth, and bulb formation, hydroponics is found to outperform the soil cultivation method in terms of better quality, quantity, and lesser vegetation period. RQ. 4 can be answered as hydroponics outperforms soil cultivation method not only in qualitative and quantitative terms, but also has an advantage of being more certain in terms of yield, and less expensive. However, the negative environmental footprint is much higher in terms of energy usage in hydroponics as compared to the soil cultivation method. The entire setup and the external controlling of environmental conditions is carried out with the help of energy. To sum up, the answer to RQ. 5, the soil cultivation method is more efficient in terms of energy efficiency. J. Evaluation of Growth Responses of Onion Using ‘AquaCrop’ Simulator in Soil and DWC Hydroponic Systems The actual results of growth responses obtained from the experiment are then verified with the results obtained from the ‘AquaCrop’ simulator. All the parametric requirements for optimal growth of hydroponic and soil onion shoots and bulbs as mentioned in Tables 3 and 4 are provided as input to the simulator. The growing conditions of DWC hydroponics and soil are input to the simulator separately. The results obtained from the simulator produced similar outputs as those obtained from the actual cultivation methods. Therefore, in response to RQ. 3 it can be stated that the actual and simulator results are similar and completely relatable. Fig. 20 is the screenshot of the simulator output screen showing the growth responses of the onion bulb in a DWC hydroponic setup. FIGURE 20. ‘AquaCrop’ simulation results for cultivation of onion in a DWC hydroponic setup. Show All It can be observed from Fig. 20 that the transpiration, canopy cover, and root growth are maximum when the growing conditions as per Table 3 are input to the simulator. there is no gap between maximum and actual growth. Fig. 21 is the screenshot of the simulator output screen showing the growth responses of the onion bulb in a substrate medium. FIGURE 21. ’AquaCrop’ simulation results for cultivation of onion in substrate cultivation. Show All Transpiration in the soil, as well as DWC hydroponics, is maximum in the soil as well as in hydroponics. The simulator outputs of canopy cover (CC) in case of substrate cultivation results are shown in two colors: grey and green. The grey portion depicts the gap between the optimal and actual growth of the onion shoot. It can be seen that there is a considerable gap between the actual and optimal results of canopy cover in the case of the cultivation of onion bulbs in a substrate medium. All the necessary agronomic conditions including the most appropriate soil type are input to the simulator, still, the substrate cultivation methods do not always produce optimal results in terms of growth due to the presence of weeds and pests in the soil. Also, soil cultivation is dependent on natural resources and climatic uncertainties, which in turn causes depleted growth responses of agricultural produce. Table 5 shows a tabular representation of the quantitative growth analysis of onion in DWC hydroponics and substrate mediums. TABLE 5 Quantitative Growth Analysis of Onion: DWC vs. Substrate Mediums The comparative analysis of the growth responses obtained in soil vs hydroponic cultivation as obtained from the simulator can be further demonstrated graphically in Fig. 22. FIGURE 22. Comparative plot of the biomass and dry yield of onion when cultivated in DWC and soil separately. Show All From Fig. 22, it can be inferred that the quantitative yield of onion is approximately 1.4 times more in DWC hydroponics, as compared to soil cultivation. This analysis is obtained from the ‘AquaCrop’ simulator which shows that the biomass of onion obtained in DWC is approximately 1.34 times as much as that obtained in the soil cultivation method. Simultaneously, the dry yield of onion is approximately 1.44 times more in DWC than in soil. Thus, the comparative plot shows a better quantitative yield of onion in DWC hydroponics as compared to cultivation in soil, along with quantitative yield as inferred from the previous subsections of the result section. Therefore, technically summarizing the comparison of growth responses of onion in DWC hydroponic cultivation, it is found that with an optimum average temperature of 30 ± 2 °C, the humidity of 68 ± 2 %, pH of 6.2 ± 0.2, and EC of 1.7 ± 0.5 mS/cm in a nutrient-infused water medium with N:P: K ratio of 10:20:10 and 20:05:05 in initial and subsequent weeks respectively, produces onion shoots in 3 – 4 days from sowing and onion bulbs within 30 ± 2 days, irrespective of any month of the year. The maximum shoot and root lengths attained were 21.5 cm and 15 cm respectively. The TDS in the nutrient-infused water medium must also be maintained within 600 – 750 mg/l and the CO2 and O2 concentrations must be < 900 ppm and > 18 % respectively to attain the said yield. The biomass and dry yield as obtained from the ‘AquaCrop’ simulator results in DWC hydroponic conditions were found to be 2.125 and 1.167 respectively. Whereas in soil cultivation, it is found that with approximately similar temperature, humidity, and pH as in hydroponics, an EC of 3.7 ± 0.7, and a rainfall of 750 ± 150 mm, with NPK ration of 2:1:1, in July to August, onions were seen to sprout in around 15 days of sowing and the bulbs were seen to form in 70 ± 5 days with a maximum shoot length of 16 cm and a maximum root length of 7 cm. The biomass and dry yield as obtained from the ‘AquaCrop’ simulator results in soil cultivation systems were found to be 2.125 and 1.167 respectively. In a nutshell, it can be said that the DWC hydroponic method of cultivation outperforms the soil cultivation method of onion cultivation in various qualitative and quantitative parameters, without using soil or depending upon natural resources for its yield. The simulation results also complied with the actual cultivation results, thus, verifying and validating the actual and experimental results. It is evident from the research done, that the hydroponic cultivation method ensures year-round enhanced and sustainable agricultural yield, irrespective and independent of natural resources and climatic uncertainties. The hydroponic cultivation method eliminates other causes of damage in substrate cultivation, i.e., weeds, pests, and rodents. Thus, the production of shoot and bulb of the medicinal plant, onion, can be enhanced with the use of the DWC hydroponics method. The scope of this experiment is limited to the comparison of root and shoot growth responses of only one species of onion. Other varieties of onion could be considered for their growth response analyses, and more distinct results could have been obtained for various species of onions. SECTION IV. Conclusion The DWC hydroponics is proven to be the best choice for the cultivation of onion in terms of qualitative, quantitative, and year–round yield. The total vegetation period of onion in a soil medium takes almost 2 ± 2 times more time to produce new bulbs than it takes in a water medium. The smart DWC cultivation implements CEA and produces almost 2 times more yield, irrespective of the growing season and the prevalent environmental conditions. Onion root as well as soot shows significant enhancement in growth responses in DWC setup of hydroponics as compared to cultivation in soil medium. This result was obtained by practically cultivating onion bulbs in the soil as well as in a smart DWC hydroponics setup and then verifying and validating the results with the results obtained from the ‘AquaCrop’ simulator. The previous works done in this regard have focused on the prediction of onion bulbs in hydroponics [64]. The authors of this research work have considered the onion as a medicinal plant whose shoot as well as the bulb contains medicinal properties, thus the growth responses of the shoot as well as the bulb of the onion were monitored and enhanced with the use of DWC hydroponics, which makes the work novel. The previous works also have focused on either the actual growth results or only simulation outputs, but the authors of this research work have carried out actual cultivation and then verified and validated the results with the results obtained from the simulator [65], [66]. All these features add to the novelty of this research work. A comparative analysis of this research is done with the research of other authors under various domains. A major lack in the existing research is the lack of cultivation and enhancement of medicinal plants [27], [28], [29], [30], [31], [32], [35], [36]. The authors have focused on onion as the subject plant where its shoots, as well as roots, have abundant medicinal properties. Some of the existing research works like in [24], [35], [36], and [37] have focused on the root growth of plants, others like [25], [28], [38], [39], and [40] have demonstrated and analyzed the shoot growth responses of various plants, but the focus of this research is to analyze and enhance both the shoot and root in qualitative and quantitative aspects. Also, in many researches like [24], [28], [30], [31], [32], [33], [34], [35], and [36], the cultivation is carried out in either soil or soilless medium. The growth analysis of medicinal plants in both mediums was an aspect lacking for research which is carried out in this experiment. Another dimension of the novelty of this research work can be mentioned by the fact that actual experimental results are verified and validated using simulator results. In previous works like in [27], [28], [30], [31], [32], [35], [36], and [42], the growth responses of plants are analyzed only in actual cultivation methods, and in experiments in [26], [41], and [42], the analysis was done using a simulator. Therefore, after comparisons with the previous works done by many researchers, it can be said that this experiment is a novel work done by comparing the shoot and root growth responses of the medicinal plant, onion, under various qualitative and quantitative aspects. The two cultivation mediums used for the analysis are soil and water, particularly in DWC hydroponics. The results of which were verified and validated by comparing the actual results with the simulator results. SECTION V. Future Outlook The scope of this research can be further expanded by comparing the growth responses and the resource utilization while comparing with the other forms of vertical farming methods, i.e., aeroponics and aquaponics. Various other species of onions may also be considered to carry out their growth response analyses to obtain more specific results dedicated to each type of onion. Though the water consumption in DWC hydroponics is much less than that needed in soil cultivation, the nutrient solution needs to be drained and replaced at regular intervals. Lack of cultivatable land and water conservation are the major concerns in the urbanized localities. Thus, wastewater treatment plants can act as a further measure of water conservation by making wastewater reusable. Conflicts of Interest The authors declare no conflict of interest.

The integration of advanced sensing techniques enables the collection of non-intrusive, precise data, facilitating comprehensive monitoring of key parameters related to the health, well-being, and productivity of dairy cows. The proposed system employs 3D imaging sensors to capture detailed information about various parts of dairy cows, generating accurate, high-resolution point clouds. A robust automated algorithm has been developed to process these point clouds and extract relevant metrics such as dairy cow stature height, rump width, rump angle, and front teat length. Based on the measured data combined with expert assessments of dairy cows, the quality indices of dairy cows are automatically evaluated and extracted. By leveraging this technology, dairy farmers can gain real-time insights into the health status of individual cows and the overall herd. Additionally, the automated analysis facilitates efficient management practices and optimizes feeding strategies and resource allocation. The results of field trials and validation studies demonstrate the effectiveness and reliability of the automated 3D point cloud approach in dairy farm environments. The errors between manually measured values of dairy cow height, rump angle, and front teat length, and those calculated by the auto-measurement algorithm were within 0.7 cm, with no observed exceedance of errors in comparison to manual measurements. This research contributes to the burgeoning field of precision livestock farming, offering a technological solution that not only enhances productivity but also aligns with contemporary standards for sustainable and ethical animal husbandry practices. Keywords: dairy cow; point cloud registration; automatic measurement and analysis; machine learning; deep learning 1. Introduction Modern agriculture is experiencing a transformative evolution, with advancements in sensor technologies playing a pivotal role in reshaping traditional farming practices. In the domain of livestock management, particularly in dairy farming, the integration of cutting-edge technologies offers unprecedented opportunities for optimizing productivity, ensuring animal welfare, and promoting sustainable practices. This paper introduces a pioneering approach to the automated measurement and analysis of dairy cows, leveraging the capabilities of 3D point cloud technology. The convergence of precision livestock farming and sensor-based methodologies promises a paradigm shift in how farmers monitor and manage their dairy herds. Dairy farming, a cornerstone of the global agricultural landscape, confronts multifaceted challenges spanning productivity and resource optimization to animal health and welfare. Traditional methods of monitoring cows often rely on manual measurements and subjective observations, which can be time-consuming, labor-intensive, and prone to human error. In response to these challenges, the proposed system harnesses the power of 3D point cloud technology, offering a non-intrusive, accurate, and automated means of capturing detailed anatomical information. The utilization of 3D imaging sensors enables the generation of high-resolution point clouds that provide a comprehensive representation of the physical characteristics of dairy cows. These point clouds serve as a rich source of data for the development of sophisticated algorithms aimed at extracting valuable metrics related to body dimensions, posture, and health indicators. By automating the measurement and analysis processes, the proposed system not only alleviates the burden on farmers but also opens new avenues for in-depth and continuous monitoring, enabling timely interventions and preventive measures. The significance of this research extends beyond the realm of traditional livestock management. As the agricultural landscape embraces smart farming practices, the integration of cloud-based platforms for data storage and analysis becomes imperative. The scalability and accessibility afforded by cloud technologies empower farmers to remotely access real-time insights into the health and well-being of their dairy herds. This paper unfolds the conceptual framework, methodology, and potential implications of the automated 3D point cloud approach, representing a promising stride toward a technologically enriched and ethically sound future for dairy farming, detailed as shown in Figure 1. Figure 1. The automated measurement and analysis of dairy cows framework. Particularly, the contribution of this paper can be summarized as follows: The multi-camera synchronization system helps minimize outliers and increase the accuracy of dairy cow 3D reconstruction, thereby avoiding factors that seriously affect the accuracy of dairy cow body size measurement. Enhancements to the previous 3D reconstruction system result in more precise stitching between the bottom and top cameras based on the camera system’s initialization matrix. Automatic measurement and analysis of various parts of dairy cows are conducted with high accuracy. The remainder of this paper is organized as follows: Section 2 reviews the automated measurement and analysis processes algorithm and their applications in dairy farming tasks. In Section 3, a reconstruction framework for improving the dairy cow 3D point cloud quality is presented. In Section 4, the automated measurement and analysis of dairy cows via a 3D point cloud approach is proposed. Section 5 presents the experimental results and the evaluations of the proposed approach in the multiple datasets. Section 6 concludes this paper. 2. Related Works The use of 3D imaging technology has found applications in diverse fields, including agriculture. Researchers have investigated its potential in crop monitoring, yield prediction, and now in livestock management. The ability of 3D imaging to provide detailed spatial information makes it a promising tool for capturing and analyzing the three-dimensional structure of dairy cows, presenting opportunities for accurate measurement and assessment. Automated systems for monitoring livestock have evolved significantly, moving beyond traditional manual methods. Computer vision and machine learning techniques have been employed to automate the recognition of animal behaviors and health conditions. These studies often utilize 2D imaging systems, and the incorporation of 3D point cloud technology represents a novel extension to enhance the granularity and accuracy of data collection. In accordance with [1], the authors implemented a method for automatically extracting measurements to estimate the weight of Nellore cattle based on regression algorithms using 2D images of the dorsal area. Additionally, the use of depth images along with an algorithm for automatically estimating heifer height and body mass for cattle, as presented in [2], has demonstrated that in single-view measurement methods utilizing a single RGB camera or depth camera for body condition and body size characteristics evaluation, challenges persist in obtaining multi-scale information, such as chest girth, abdominal circumference, rump angle, and so on. Similar approaches for single-view based measurement problems have also been discussed in [3,4,5,6,7]. For the task of dairy cow 3D reconstruction, the farm environment and the movement of dairy cows significantly impact the resulting point cloud generated using multi-view methods, leading to the appearance of outliers and distortion in the dairy cow 3D point cloud. Consequently, the evaluation of body size introduces considerable errors [8]. By constructing a synchronized multi-camera system [9] during the point cloud generation process, our current approach has successfully minimized the occurrence of outliers, and the visualization of the dairy cow point cloud has been significantly improved. On the other hand, the measurement of dairy cows is divided into two levels: manual and automatic measurement. The manual measurement method requires identifying measurement points on images and point clouds. Subsequently, the body-side parameters are calculated by determining the distance between the marked points. Automated measurement is achieved through the manual or automatic filtering of input images or point clouds [10,11], which is followed by the automated measurement of animal body size. 3. The Dairy Cows 3D Reconstruction Currently, to successfully reconstruct a dairy cow, it is crucial to ensure the proper conditions on the farm, an effective data collection system, and the state of the dairy cow at the time of implementation. The excessive movement of dairy cows during the data collection process for 3D reconstruction is a significant concern due to the adverse effects it introduces. Specifically, the RGBD-SLAM algorithm for the dairy cow 3D reconstruction problem may encounter issues such as lost tracking during the point cloud registration process between fragments, leading to distorted 3D results and the emergence of numerous outliers. To ensure the accuracy of the dairy cow 3D reconstruction system, an evaluation was conducted on a non-moving dairy cow model, as shown in Figure 2. Figure 2. Dairy cow 3D reconstruction evaluation: (a) 3D dairy cow point cloud. (b) Dummy dairy cow. The error between the results measured manually on a dummy dairy cow and the results measured on a 3D reconstruction file is 𝐸=2.1 cm. According to the depth quality specifications provided by the Intel Realsense datasheet, 𝑅𝑀𝑆𝐸𝑟𝑟𝑜𝑟≤ 4 cm for the objects is within 2 m and 80% ROI. For body length or other dimensions of the cow that are within approximately 1 m from the camera, the error is only around 1 cm. Therefore, our 3D reconstruction algorithm can create highly accurate 3D dairy cow objects used for auto-measurement problems. 3.1. The Camera Synchronization System In the context of reconstructing a 3D object, achieving precise 3D geometric information poses a challenge when relying on a solitary camera. To enhance the capture of detailed geometric features in a 3D object, it becomes necessary to augment the number of cameras involved in the process. Nevertheless, the synchronization of these cameras is crucial for the simultaneous capture of frames. Incorrect synchronization among cameras can lead to the generation of numerous artifacts in the reconstructed 3D object. As presented in [9], the author has provided a comparison of the quality of 3D reconstructions created based on two different approaches to show the importance of camera synchronization. Our multi-camera synchronization system can synchronize 10 cameras together through one host (Jetson Orin). In the current work, only 2 out of 10 pairs of Jetson Nano and Intel RealSense cameras are used to collect RGB-D data for the dairy cow 3D reconstruction problem. This system has been developed with the purpose of aligning the frames acquired between two cameras placed in the top and bottom positions. All frames were captured by cameras with corresponding timestamps, as shown in Figure 3. However, synchronously capturing frames via an external trigger signal proves challenging to ensure synchronization when storing frames from the RealSense camera to the host. Therefore, synchronizing the global timestamps among host computers with each other based on the Network Time Protocol (NTP) [12,13] has been applied to achieve the simultaneous computation of frames. Consequently, we can retrieve simultaneously captured frames by gathering each frame from all cameras that share the same global timestamps. Figure 3. Genlock synchronization system. 3.2. Dairy Cow 3D Reconstruction Improvement As presented in [14], dairy cow 3D reconstruction is generated based on the RGB-D dataset applying an AI algorithm for creating depth images. Initially, k-frame segments were derived from pre-existing short RGB-D sequences. Within each subsequence, the RGB-D odometry algorithm [15] was applied to ascertain the camera trajectory and merge image ranges. Specifically, the identity matrix served as the initialization for adjacent RGB-D frames. In contrast, for non-adjacent RGB-D frames, ORB feature computation facilitated sparse feature matching across wide baseline images [16], followed by a 5-point RANSAC [17] process for a preliminary alignment estimation, which was utilized as the initialization for RGB-D odometry computation. To determine the appropriate k value, considering the number of input frames, k = 100 was consistently set for all experiments with the current dataset. Utilizing the initial 100 frames, fragments were generated, providing a description of a segment of the dairy cow surface mesh. Once the fragments of the scene are generated, the next step involves aligning them in a global space. Global registration refers to an algorithm that operates without the need for an initialization alignment. Typically, it computes and offers a less rigid alignment, serving as the initialization for local methods such as the ICP (Iterative Closest Point). In the current work, we used FGR [18] to initialize alignment. However, the rate of creating full 3D dairy cow reconstruction is quite low after some experiments. As shown in Figure 4, it is not possible to stitch the point cloud created from the top camera (containing information mainly about the back of the dairy cow) with the point cloud created from the bottom camera (containing information mainly about the lower body of the dairy cow). Two parameters, Fitness and Inlier RMSE, are calculated to evaluate our algorithm, as shown specifically in Table 1. On the dataset of some dairy cows, we applied the algorithm for 3D point cloud registration and evaluated it. The Fitness value after updating the algorithm increased from 0.1 to 0.5, and the Inlier RMSE value also decreased from 0.02 to 0.01. Figure 4. Dairy cow 3D reconstruction improvement: (a) Merged 3D dairy cow point cloud based on old algorithm. (b) Merged 3D dairy cow point cloud based on a new algorithm. Table 1. Dairy cow 3D reconstruction evaluations. Therefore, an initialization matrix T has been created based on the physical parameters of the camera’s position in the dairy cow data collection system, as shown in Figure 5. Equation (1) presents the specific values of the T matrix. By combining the FGR algorithm with these values, the point clouds generated from the top camera are rotated and translated closer to the nearest point cloud generated from the bottom camera.

Dairy Cow 3D Point Cloud Extraction and Normalization The 3D point clouds of dairy cows generated by the 3D reconstruction algorithms in [14] contain information from the input image scene. To expedite point cloud processing and mitigate the impact of the substantial volume of point cloud data on computer resources, the Voxel Grid approach was employed for downsampling the point clouds [19]. The original point cloud data include points from the target dairy cow, the fence, the ground, and outliers. To minimize the influence of unnecessary point clouds, the dairy cow clouds were trimmed at the plane of the fence and the ground. As depicted in Figure 6, the raw 3D reconstruction data encompass two main planes: the ground and the fence. The RANSAC algorithm was utilized to facilitate the detection of these two planes. This algorithm randomly selects three points within the point cloud, estimates the corresponding plane equation Equation (2), and utilizes the distance d to identify points belonging to the plane. Through multiple iterations, the plane with the greatest number of points was extracted. 𝑎𝑥+𝑏𝑦+𝑐𝑧+𝑑=0 𝑛 𝑇 𝑥=−𝑑 (2) where, 𝑛= [ 𝑛 1 𝑛 2 𝑛 3 ] 𝑇 : the normal vector of plane 𝑥= [ 𝑥 1 𝑦 1 𝑧 1 ] 𝑇 Figure 6. Dairy cow 3D point cloud extraction and normalization. 4. Automated Measurement and Analysis of Dairy Cows via 3D Point Cloud 4.1. Dairy Cow Body Automated Measurement Considering the fragmented 3D shape of an animal, which is depicted as an amalgamation of point clouds acquired from a set of two depth cameras { 𝑃 1 , 𝑃 2 } , the point clouds are concatenated into a unified single point cloud such as 𝑃= ⋃ 2 𝑐=1 𝑃 𝑐 , where 𝑃={ 𝑝 1 ,…, 𝑝 𝑛 } and 𝑝 𝑖 ∈ ℝ 3 . Our objective is to determine the m ordered key points 𝑁={ 𝑛 1 ,…, 𝑛 𝑚 } , where 𝑛 𝑗 ∈𝑃 . The key points are systematically annotated in a consistent order, such as right rear leg, right front leg, hip, …, giving them a well-defined semantic significance. The coordinate system is defined by the x, y, and z axes, respectively, which are displayed as red, green, and blue arrows, as shown in Figure 6. As described in [20], the key points extraction was proposed as a regression problem. Specifically, the distance between each point in the point cloud and each annotated point was computed, yielding m distance vectors, each with a size of n. Utilizing these distances, the key points can be determined by identifying the point with the minimum value in each distance vector. From a machine learning perspective, the problem is formulated as a mapping between the 𝑛×3 input matrix 𝐏 and the 𝑛×𝑚 output matrix 𝐃 ̂ . This naturally lends itself to an encoder–decoder architecture, where features for each point are aimed to be predicted from the input. Point cloud encoder–decoder architectures are typically designed to address semantic segmentation problems, where the probability of each point belonging to a specific class is predicted by the neural network. The transformation of an encoder–decoder into a segmentation problem is achieved by converting the network’s prediction into a probability, typically through the use of a sigmoid function, and by having the expected class probability backpropagated through the loss function. In this research, we contend that an encoder–decoder architecture can be employed interchangeably provided that it possesses the capacity to learn from point clouds [21]. The task of detecting specific points on a cow’s body is formulated as a 3D key point detection problem using point cloud data. To tackle this challenge, we leverage PointNet [22], a specialized 3D Deep Neural Network (DNN) designed for comprehensive 3D data analysis, offering the unique capability to learn both global and local features. In Figure 7, the architecture of PointNet is structured as follows: it incorporates an Input Transform Network (T-Net) succeeded by a sequence of Multi-Layer Perceptrons (MLPs) dedicated to local feature extraction. The Input Transform Network adeptly captures transformations, ensuring the network’s resilience to variations in input point permutations, rotations, and translations. Following this, a Feature Transform Network (T-Net) is employed to augment the network’s ability to handle diverse point orderings. Upon local feature extraction, a global feature vector is derived through max pooling, facilitating the aggregation of information from the entire point cloud. This global feature vector undergoes further processing by a set of MLPs, culminating in the production of the final segmentation mask. This mask assigns class labels to each individual point, effectively completing the task. The synergistic interplay between the Input and feature Transform Networks empowers PointNet to robustly extract features from point cloud data, making it a potent solution for the nuanced task of detecting specific points on a cow’s body. Figure 7. PointNet architecture for 3D dairy cow segmentation. In this work, the model PointNet is implemented by Pytorch, which is a popular Deep Learning framework. Details of the training environment are as in Table 2. Table 2. Details of the training environment. As present in Table 3, dairy cow body part measurement values refer to quantified data associated with various physical characteristics and dimensions of dairy cows. These measurements play a crucial role in assessing the health, well-being, and productivity of the animals in a dairy farming context. Table 3. Dairy cow body part measurement value. The following are explanations for some of these key measurement values: Stature Value: Stature value refers to the measurement of a dairy cow’s height, which is usually from the ground to a specific point on its body. This measurement is vital in determining the cow’s overall size and can be used to monitor growth, nutritional status, and assess the animal’s ability to access feed and water resources. Rump Angle Value: Rump angle value measures the angle of a cow’s rump, specifically the slope from its lower back to the tailhead. The rump angle can provide insights into the cow’s body condition and reproductive health. Changes in rump angle can indicate shifts in body fat and muscle distribution. Rump Width Value: Rump width value quantifies the width of the cow’s rump, which is the area just before the tailhead. This measurement can help assess the cow’s body condition, particularly the development of the pelvic area, which is essential for calving. Front Teat Length: The front teat length is the measurement of the length of the teats on the front udder of a dairy cow. This measurement is essential in assessing udder health and milkability. It can also be an indicator of the cow’s ability to nurse its calf or be milked efficiently. These measurement values are collected through various methods, including manual measurements and automated systems that employ advanced technologies such as 3D point cloud imaging. Accurate and consistent measurements are essential for monitoring the health and performance of dairy cows, enabling farmers to make informed decisions about their care, nutrition, and overall management. 4.2. Stature Height The stature height of a dairy cow is the vertical distance from the highest point on the back of a dairy cow to the ground. As illustrated in Figure 8, the 3D point cloud of the dairy cow after being separated from the ground plane is utilized for the computation of stature height. By applying depth learning techniques to identify key point clouds, the stature height can be calculated through point-to-plane distance measurements, 𝑀 𝑆𝑡𝑎𝑡𝑢𝑟𝑒𝐻𝑒𝑖𝑔ℎ𝑡 . 𝑀 𝑆𝑡𝑎𝑡𝑢𝑟𝑒𝐻𝑒𝑖𝑔ℎ𝑡 =𝑑(𝑃,𝐺𝑟𝑜𝑢𝑛𝑑𝑃𝑙𝑎𝑛𝑒) (3) Figure 8. Measurement of stature height. 4.3. Rump Angle The rump angle of the dairy cow is the inclination from the yaw angle to the sit bone. In Figure 9, it is shown that starting from the original dairy cow 3D point cloud, the outliers are removed to reduce computational costs and enhance the accuracy of key point detection based on AI. Figure 9. Measurement of rump angle. Once the two key point clouds ( 𝐴 1 and 𝐴 2 ) used to compute the rump angle are identified, the measurement is evaluated by comparing the distance between two points to the ground plane ( ℎ 1 and ℎ 2 ) and providing a score. From the detected points 𝐴 1 and 𝐴 2 , we can compute the distances from these points to the ground plane, 𝑀 𝑅𝑢𝑚𝑝𝐴𝑛𝑔𝑙𝑒 𝑀 𝑅𝑢𝑚𝑝𝐴𝑛𝑔𝑙𝑒 = ℎ 1 − ℎ 2 (4) 4.4. Rump Width The rump width of a dairy cow is the inner width of the ischium and the width of the cone, 𝑀 𝑅𝑢𝑚𝑝𝑊𝑖𝑑𝑡ℎ . Figure 10 shows how to determine two points 𝐶 1 , 𝐶 2 based on the AI algorithm for calculating rump width 𝑀 𝑅𝑢𝑚𝑝𝑊𝑖𝑑𝑡ℎ =𝑑( 𝐶 1 , 𝐶 2 ) (5) Figure 10. Measurement of rump width: (a) Input. (b) Detect points 𝐴 1 and 𝐵 1 . (c) Cut body along point 𝐴 1 , 𝐵 1 . (d) Determine point 𝐶 1 , 𝐶 2 . 4.5. Front Teat Length After creating the 3D point cloud teat data (Figure 11b), this dataset is used to label for training and testing. Specifically, label 2 points at the top and the bottom of each teat (Figure 11c). With the automatic teat detection results after the training process (Figure 11d), the front teat length 𝑀 𝐹𝑟𝑜𝑛𝑡𝑇𝑒𝑎𝑡𝐿𝑒𝑛𝑔ℎ𝑡 is determined according to Equation (6) 𝑀 𝐹𝑟𝑜𝑛𝑡𝑇𝑒𝑎𝑡𝐿𝑒𝑛𝑔ℎ𝑡 = 𝑀 𝑙𝑒𝑓𝑡 + 𝑀 𝑟𝑖𝑔ℎ𝑡 2 (6) where 𝑀 𝑙𝑒𝑓𝑡 : the front teat length left 𝑀 𝑟𝑖𝑔ℎ𝑡 : the front teat length right Figure 11.

The Camera Synchronization System To assess the synchronization between the two cameras in the dairy cow 3D reconstruction system, we constructed a system comprising ten cameras connected to 10 Jetson Nano single computers, and all the data collected were sent to a host computer, Jetson Orin. The device specifications are detailed in Table 4. The synchronization was demonstrated through the frames obtained from the 10 cameras, which displayed the same timestamp on the screen when they had the same index. The synchronization results is shown in Figure 12. Figure 12. The synchronization results. Table 4. The specification of hardware device. 5.2. Dairy Cow Body Automated Measurement The key to calculating the body size data for cows, including withers height, body length, chest width, and chest girth, lies in the measurement points on the cow’s body. The automated cow body measurement algorithm was applied to the cow’s point clouds after coordinate normalization and refinement. The definitions for manual and automatic measurement values for each body size were as follows. 5.2.1. Stature Height As shown in Figure 13, by adding the calculated value and score measurement directly to the input 3D point cloud dataset ( 𝑠𝑡𝑎𝑡𝑢𝑟𝑒ℎ𝑒𝑖𝑔ℎ𝑡 = 142.0 cms and 𝑠𝑐𝑜𝑟𝑒𝑚𝑒𝑎𝑠𝑢𝑟𝑒𝑚𝑒𝑛𝑡 = 6), the evaluating and monitoring of the condition of dairy cows becomes simpler and more intuitive for evaluators via any point cloud file (.ply) display application. Table 5 displays the outcomes of the non-contact measurement system’s repeatability. Figure 13. Auto-detection and measurement of stature height. Table 5. Stature measurement auto-detection error. The result was computed on 347 samples. Unit: cm. The mean absolute error of 0.7 cm in height measurement indicates a relatively high level of precision in capturing the vertical dimension of dairy cows. This accuracy is crucial in assessing the growth, health, and overall stature of the animals. It can aid in determining the appropriate feeding and care for each cow within the herd. 5.2.2. Rump Angle Figure 14a shows that four points 𝐴 1 , 𝐴 2 , and 𝐵 1 , 𝐵 2 are automatically determined through the AI algorithm for the rump angle measurement problem. They are then calculated and given a score measurement to display on the rump part point cloud (the green point cloud area), 𝑟𝑢𝑚𝑎𝑛𝑔𝑙𝑒=6.06 and 𝑠𝑐𝑜𝑟𝑒𝑚𝑒𝑎𝑠𝑢𝑟𝑒𝑚𝑒𝑛𝑡=6 . Figure 14. Auto-detection and measurement of rump part: (a) Rump angle. (b) Rump width. The measurement of rump-angle auto-detection error on 101 samples is computed in Table 6. The 0.61 cm mean absolute error in rump angle measurement reflects the depth cameras’ competence in quantifying the inclination or tilt of the cow’s rump. This metric is valuable in assessing the cow’s comfort and posture, which are particularly relevant for dairy cattle’s well-being and milking efficiency. Table 6. Rump-angle measurement auto-detection error. The result was computed on 101 samples. Unit: cm. 5.2.3. Rump Width Similar to the rump angle, the rump width is calculated through two automatically determined points 𝐶 1 , 𝐶 2 , as shown in Figure 14b. The calculated rump width value and score measurement are added directly to the 3D point cloud input. Specifically, 𝑟𝑢𝑚𝑝𝑤𝑖𝑑𝑡ℎ = 11.7 cm corresponds to 𝑠𝑐𝑜𝑟𝑒𝑚𝑒𝑎𝑠𝑢𝑟𝑒𝑚𝑒𝑛𝑡=5 . The auto-detection error of rump-width measurement on 101 samples is computed and shown in Table 7. With a mean absolute error of 2.5 cm, the depth cameras demonstrate their capability to accurately capture the width of the cow’s rump. This measurement is significant in evaluating the body condition and reproductive health of the animals. The precision achieved here contributes to the effective management of dairy herds. Table 7. Rump-width measurement auto-detection error. The result was computed on 101 samples. Unit: cm. 5.2.4. Front Teat Length After the dairy cow teat is automatically detected, the teat length value is calculated and given a score measurement as shown in Figure 15, 𝑡𝑒𝑎𝑡𝑙𝑒𝑓𝑡𝑙𝑒𝑛𝑔𝑡ℎ=4.06 , 𝑡𝑒𝑎𝑡𝑟𝑖𝑔ℎ𝑡𝑙𝑒𝑛𝑔𝑡ℎ=4.26 , 𝑎𝑣𝑒𝑟𝑎𝑔𝑒𝑡𝑒𝑎𝑡𝑙𝑒𝑛𝑔𝑡ℎ=4.16 and 𝑠𝑐𝑜𝑟𝑒𝑚𝑒𝑎𝑠𝑢𝑟𝑒𝑚𝑒𝑛𝑡=3 . Besides, the result was computed on 71 samples as shown in Table 8. Figure 15. Auto-detection and measurement of front teat length. Table 8. Front teat length measurement auto-detection error. The result was computed on 71 samples. Unit: cm. The front teat length measurement, with a mean absolute error of 0.79 cm, is important for the assessment of milking efficiency and udder health. This level of accuracy enables dairy farmers to make informed decisions about milking routines and cow comfort. The error between the manually measured values of dairy cow height, rump angle, front teat length and values calculated by the auto-measurement algorithm were within 0.7 cm. The errors observed did not surpass those generated by manual measurements. In the verification, the rump width has shown a large error compared to other body parameters, which is possibly due to the structure of the rump width calculation area being quite complicated and the two points to be detected being too close together, leading to confusion in determining the point to measure based on AI. Table 9 presents an analysis of research conducted for non-contact body measurement applications. Specifically, the measurement method, type of devices used to collect processing objects, and type of data processing objects (2D images, depth images, and point cloud) are important criteria that affect the results the 3D point cloud produces as well as the accuracy in automated measurement and analysis of animals via a 3D point cloud. This table also presents some measuring objects on animals such as horses, cows, pigs, and dairy cattle along with the performance of different measurement methods. Table 9. An analysis of research conducted for non-contact body measurement applications. Precision requirements in dairy farming statistics can vary based on the specific applications and objectives. Precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy and reliability of data collected for various aspects of dairy farming. In our work, accurate measurements of cow height (stature) are crucial for monitoring health and productivity. The mean absolute error (MAE) of 0.7 cm is acceptable in many scenarios—especially if the primary goal is to identify significant changes rather than precise measurements. Precision in rump-angle measurement is critical for assessing cow body condition and comfort. Based on our current approach, the MAE of 0.61 cm is relatively low and should be considered satisfactory for most practical purposes in dairy farming. The rump width is a significant factor in determining the optimal space required for a cow to move comfortably. The MAE of 2.5 cm may be acceptable in certain applications, depending on the specific needs of the dairy farm. However, if precision is crucial for a particular task, further improvements may be considered. Especially, front teat length is an important parameter for milking efficiency and udder health. The MAE of 0.79 cm is generally acceptable for routine monitoring in dairy farming. Finally, this research has contributed to practical significance in the field of automated measurement and analysis of animals via 3D point clouds. The low mean absolute errors in these body measurements highlight the feasibility of using depth cameras for accurate and non-invasive data collection in the dairy industry. This technology can significantly improve the management and well-being of dairy cows, leading to increased milk production, health, and overall farm efficiency. Additionally, the results from this study could contribute to precision livestock farming practices, enabling farmers to make data-driven decisions for their dairy herds. 6. Conclusions In conclusion, this paper has presented a pioneering approach to revolutionize the measurement and analysis of dairy cows through the innovative use of 3D point cloud technology. The intersection of precision livestock farming and advanced sensing techniques has yielded a system that promises to redefine how dairy farmers monitor and manage their herds. Through a comprehensive review of related work, we have contextualized our contributions within the broader landscape of automated livestock monitoring, highlighting the unique advantages offered by 3D imaging and point cloud data. Our proposed system leverages 3D imaging sensors to generate high-resolution point clouds, capturing intricate details of dairy cow anatomical structures. The developed automated algorithms extract crucial metrics related to body dimensions, posture, and health indicators, providing farmers with a nuanced understanding of individual and herd-wide conditions. By automating these processes, our system not only alleviates the burden on farmers but also facilitates continuous, real-time monitoring, enabling early detection of health issues and timely interventions. Furthermore, the integration of machine learning algorithms enhances the system’s capability to identify and classify various behaviors and conditions, contributing to a more comprehensive assessment of dairy cows’ well-being. While the presented work marks a significant stride forward, we acknowledge that further research is needed to refine and expand the capabilities of our system. Additionally, collaboration with stakeholders, including farmers, veterinarians, and agricultural technology developers, is essential to ensure the practicality and adoption of our proposed approach in real-world dairy farming scenarios. In summary, our work contributes to the growing body of knowledge in precision livestock farming by introducing a methodology for the automated measurement and analysis of dairy cows. The fusion of 3D point cloud technology and machine learning algorithms represents a powerful synergy that holds promise for the future of dairy farming, where technology aligns with ethics and sustainability, fostering a new era of intelligent and humane livestock management.

Conclusion Authors Figures References Keywords Metrics Abstract: In aquaculture, controlling water quality parameters is an important challenge. The water quality parameters affect the growth of aquatic organisms. Thus, maintaining water quality balance has become the primary goal of aquaculture operators. However, the traditional water quality inspection method is low in accuracy and consumes considerable time and human resources. On the other hand, since water quality sensors are immersed in seawater for a long time, algae will grow on the sensors, affecting their accuracy. Therefore, to solve the abovementioned problems, this article reports the design and implementation of a full-time artificial intelligence of things (AIoT)-based water quality inspection and prediction system, which uses a simple recurrent unit (SRU) model to predict water quality data. With the proposed system, it is possible to collect water quality sensing data 24 h a day and further use the SRU model for sensor data prediction to assist aquaculture farmers in managing and controlling outdoor aquaculture ponds. Moreover, a 24-h water quality sampling tank is designed to overcome the problem of sensor error. Throughout the whole process, data are transmitted to a water quality monitoring cloud platform for further inspection and prediction. In this article, SRU-based prediction is used to obtain predictions of water quality parameters, and three popular metrics mean absolute error (MAE), root-mean-square error (RMSE), and mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) are used to evaluate the performance. As a result, experimental results show that the proposed method offers good performance for prediction of water quality.

Introduction With the impacts of the greenhouse effect, drastic climate changes have triggered a food shortage crisis. Crops depend on a suitable climate to grow, but drastic changes in the climate have affected crop yields. Consequently, to meet the large food demand of humans, the aquaculture industry has increasingly prospered in recent years because the aquatic products of aquaculture, such as fish, shrimp, and shellfish, have high nutritional value. Although traditional manual aquaculture technology has matured, it still faces challenges. Aquaculture management based on the conventional manual method is time consuming and labor intensive. However, with the vigorous development of artificial intelligence (AI) technology and Internet of Things (IoT) technology, it has become possible to solve the problems of traditional aquaculture using intelligent technology; thus, traditional aquaculture has evolved into intelligent aquaculture. Nevertheless, although current intelligent aquaculture systems can reduce the time cost and human resource demands of aquaculture, they are still insufficient to overcome the food shortage crisis. To overcome this challenge, there is a need to focus on managing water quality in outdoor aquaculture ponds. The growth of aquatic products can be controlled through proper management of changes in water conditions. Thus, the nutritional value of aquatic products can be improved. Traditional aquatic products with high nutritional value are called precision aquaculture products [1], and the production of such refined aquatic products can contribute to solving the human food shortage crisis. However, current water quality management technology is still dominated by a high demand for human resources. The substances present in the water in outdoor aquaculture ponds are highly variable, and traditional manual water quality analysis is time consuming and labor intensive. On the other hand, since water quality sensors remain immersed in seawater for a long time, algae will grow on these sensors, affecting their accuracy. Hence, achieving the accurate prediction and analysis of water quality is a significant challenge. In response to the challenges mentioned above, this article proposes a full-time AI of things (AIoT)-based water quality monitoring and prediction system to regularly measure the water quality environment of outdoor aquaculture ponds. With the proposed system, it is possible to collect water quality sensing data all 24 h in a day and further use a simple recurrent unit (SRU) model for sensor data prediction to assist aquaculture farmers in managing and controlling the monitored outdoor aquaculture ponds. The proposed system uses four types of water quality sensors [temperature, dissolved oxygen (DO), potential of hydrogen (pH), and oxidation reduction potential (ORP)] to detect water parameters. In addition, we built a web-based water quality monitoring cloud platform to store a large amount of water parameter data and used deep learning models to analyze and predict the water quality environment. This platform allows users to connect through mobile phones or other devices to monitor water quality data. The main contributions of this article can be summarized as follows. The proposed system enables full-time collection of water quality sensing data from outdoor aquaculture ponds. It utilizes an SRU model for predicting sensor data that contribute to accurate predictions and assist aquaculture farmers in effectively managing and controlling their aquaculture ponds. The proposed system employs four different types of water quality sensors, including temperature, DO, pH, and ORP, to detect essential water parameters. This multisensor approach enhances the comprehensiveness and accuracy of water quality monitoring. This work introduces the creation of a web-based water quality monitoring cloud platform. This platform serves as a repository for storing large volumes of water parameter data. Deep learning models are integrated into the platform to analyze and predict the water quality environment. The rest of this article is organized as follows. Section II discusses previous works related to intelligent aquaculture. Section III introduces the proposed system. Section IV demonstrates the prototype of the proposed system and explains the experimental results. Finally, we conclude this work in Section V. SECTION II. Previous Works An intelligent aquaculture system realizes automatic control through AI and IoT equipment (devices) for water quality monitoring and prediction. Recently, such systems have become a popular topic of aquaculture research [3], [4], [5], [6], [7], [8], [9], [10], [11]. In addition to its application for water quality inspection and prediction, computer vision technology [2] can be used to analyze the feeding behavior of underwater fish [12], [13], [14], [15], [16], to identify the health status of aquatic organisms [17], [18], to detect vulnerabilities in aquaculture net cages [19], and for other purposes to make aquaculture systems more intelligent. A. Water Quality Inspection and Prediction Hu et al. [3] used a deep learning network based on a long short-term memory (LSTM) model to predict pH and water temperature. The data were preprocessed using a linear difference method and a smoothing method; the influence of various water quality parameters on the pH value and water temperature was analyzed based on the Pearson coefficient method; the results of the Pearson coefficient analysis were used as model input; and LSTM- and recurrent neural network (RNN)-based learning models of different depths were trained and compared. Finally, an LSTM-based water quality prediction model was established because the experimental results showed that this model was more accurate and took less time than the RNN model. Liu et al. [4] transmitted monitoring information on the pH value, water temperature, and DO in a pond to a cloud database and used a deep bidirectional stacked SRU (Bi-S-SRU) model to improve the data organization in the preprocessing stage. In experimental comparisons of the Bi-S-SRU model with RNN and LSTM models, the results showed that the prediction accuracy of the Bi-S-SRU model was better than that of most other neural networks. However, it needed more computation time than the other neural networks. Liu et al. [5] used an SRU model for prediction, used the Pearson correlation coefficient method to find the correlations between water quality parameters, and compared the predictions of an RNN model with those of the SRU model. Furthermore, Ciou [6] found that in comparison with an RNN-based model, their proposed SRU model had higher accuracy and stability, and the actual prediction error could be controlled within 1%. Overall, the SRU models perform better than the RNN models in terms of prediction. Ciou [6] reduced the labor cost and error rate of aquaculture through intelligent water quality monitoring. He used a LoRa wireless transmission system with a solar energy architecture to reduce construction costs and used a Raspberry Pi embedded system as the core to wirelessly transmit the collected data. The data were sent to a remote server and could then be displayed on a device through a web page, providing a remote real-time monitoring interface for users to observe and adjust water quality. In this work, the Raspberry Pi embedded system served as the core processor of the monitoring system. The solar energy system was used as the power supply system at the sensing end to improve mobility. The LoRa low-power long-distance network was used to transmit information. Finally, the water quality information could be monitored and adjusted through the web page, resulting in a significant change in the operation method, which had needed labor-intensive manual inspections in the past. Rasheed Abdul Haq and Harigovindan [7] proposed a deep learning method for water quality prediction. The water quality parameters considered were salinity, pH, DO, and temperature. In the experiments, the ADAK and MAC water quality datasets were used for prediction, and the mean absolute error (MAE) method was used for model evaluation. Li et al. [8] proposed an enhanced Naive Bayes (NB) model to predict DO as a water quality parameter. The authors used the results of ten-fold cross-validation and used the MAE metric for model evaluation. Because the data are unstable and nonlinear, predicting DO accurately is a major challenge. Cao et al. [9] proposed a method for predicting DO changes in aquaculture using k-means clustering, an improved softplus extreme learning machine (SELM), and particle swarm optimization (PSO). In addition, the model was tolerant of missing data and outliers and provided high accuracy. Chiang et al. [10] proposed a chip for salinity detection, which included a salinity sensor and a transducer. Experiments showed that the proposed salinity detector could detect salinity changes with high sensitivity in water environments with large salinity differences. Huan et al. [11] proposed a water quality monitoring system for outdoor aquaculture ponds using narrowband IoT (NB-IoT) technology. Monitoring water quality is very important for aquaculture production to control the growth and health of aquatic products. The proposed system could obtain water quality parameters such as temperature, pH, and DO over time. B. Analysis of Underwater Fish Feeding Ubina et al. [12] proposed a method using a convolutional neural network (CNN) to analyze the accuracy of calculating the 3-D positions of fish in an aquaculture net cage. Such 3-D position analysis can reveal the feeding, growth, and health status of the fish. Experimental results showed that the error rate for porphyry seabream and golden pomfret was less than 5% in a camera range from 50 to 200 cm. Pai et al. [13] proposed a method for fish detection and enumeration using You Only Look Once version 5 (YOLOv5). Counting the number of fish in an aquaculture net cage can be useful for estimating the amount of feed needed. Experimental results showed that the precision, recall, and F-measure were 81%. In addition, abnormal behavior of fish in the water could be detected. Hu et al. [14] proposed a method using a deep neural network (DNN) to identify the wave size caused by fish eating bait in outdoor aquaculture ponds to determine fish feeding status. The experimental results showed that the proposed model achieved up to 93.2% accuracy. C. Recognition of Abnormal Fish Behavior Wang et al. [17] proposed a method of detecting abnormal behavior of underwater fish using AI object detection, direct cycle graph (DCG), and dynamic time warping (DTW) methods. Checking for abnormal fish behavior can be useful for analyzing the causes of fish disease or death to plan countermeasures and reduce unnecessary losses, as the death of fish in a pond can easily cause contamination of the entire pond with pathogens. Generally, the traditional manual inspection method is very time consuming. In contrast, such an automated method can be used to quickly analyze the abnormal behavior of underwater fish so that aquaculture operators can learn about the causes of illness or death. D. Hole Detection in Aquaculture Net Cages Amundsen et al. [19] proposed a method that uses remotely operated underwater vehicles (ROVs) and Doppler velocity logs (DVLs) to check for holes in aquaculture net cages, which are used to prevent farmed fish from affecting wild fish population structures. They replaced traditional divers with the ROV method of checking aquaculture net cages to avoid the need for divers to perform dangerous tasks underwater. SECTION III. Proposed Water Quality Inspection System Fig. 1 shows the system architecture of the proposed system. An IoT module (ESP32) is used to connect five devices: a DO sensor with a built-in temperature sensor, a pH sensor, an ORP sensor, a water valve, and a water pump. Through the Wi-Fi wireless network, the water quality–related sensing data are uploaded to the AI server for water quality analysis. Fig. 1. System architecture of the proposed water quality inspection system. Show All Water quality data analysis is carried out by collecting seawater parameter data; future water quality data prediction is carried out through a water quality prediction model; and the impact of water quality on aquatic organisms is investigated. Moreover, to prevent data errors caused by algae growth on the sensors in seawater, as shown in Fig. 2, actual measurements indicate that the water quality sensors need to be cleaned every 1–2 weeks. Fig. 2. Example of algae growth on a water quality sensor placed in seawater. Show All To solve this problem, a set of 24-h water sampling tanks is designed based on water pump and water valve components that are electronically controlled through the ESP32 to regularly control the pumping and discharging of water to discourage algae growth. Furthermore, users can connect to the cloud platform through computers and mobile phones to browse water quality–related data in real time. We further explain why the proposed system can solve the above problems. Generally, the traditional water quality measurement method cannot measure full time (i.e., for 24 h). The main reason is that if the water quality sensor is soaked in water for a long time, algae will grow rapidly, causing damage to water quality sensors or reducing measurement accuracy. Compared with the proposed system, when the water quality needs to be measured, the water is pumped up for measurement, and the water is discharged after the measurement is completed. This can prevent the water quality sensor from being soaked in water for a long time, causing the algae to grow leading to the reduction of water quality sensor’s accuracy. A. Introduction to the IoT-Based Control Module, Water Quality Sensors, and Actuators Fig. 3 shows the connection structure of the IoT-based control module (ESP32). First, a 12-V transformer converts ac 110 V power to dc 12 V power to provide power to the water pump and water valve. Then, the dc power is further converted from 12 to 5 V through a 5-V converter to supply power to the sensors (DO sensor with a built-in temperature sensor, pH sensor, and ORP sensor) and the control module. ESP32 is connected to two relays for the on/off functions of the water valve and water pump. Fig. 3. Connection structure of the IoT-based control module (ESP32). Show All 1) IoT-Based Control Module: The ESP32 is a low-power microcontroller that combines Wi-Fi and Bluetooth chips. This IoT control module has digital and analog pins for signal processing and uses the C language for programming. ESP32 uses the Tensilica Xtensa LX6 microprocessor, including dual-core and single-core variants, with built-in antenna switches, RF converters, power amplifiers, filters, low-noise receiver amplifiers, and power management modules. In this article, ESP32 is used for sensor/actuator control, timing, and data uploading. It also has multiple pins, which can be used to conveniently control various sets of devices. 2) Water Quality Sensors: The DO sensor mainly measures the oxygen concentration in the water. DO refers to the concentration of oxygen dissolved in water. The DO quantity is the leading indicator for judging water quality. Generally, the higher the concentration is, the better the water quality. The amount of saturated DO in water is affected by the water temperature and other dissolved substances. The higher the water temperature is, the lower the saturated DO. In actual field operations, the DO concentration in general aquaculture ponds is needed to be greater than 4 r/min. The specifications of the adopted DO sensor (with a built-in temperature sensor) [20] can be seen in Table I. TABLE I Specifications of the Adopted DO Sensor (With a Built-in Temperature Sensor) [20] The term pH stands for potential hydrogen and is used to measure the level of acidity or alkalinity in any water-soluble substance. The pH scale ranges from 1 to 14 on a logarithmic scale, with seven being neutral. Any value below seven indicates acidity, with lower numbers indicating higher levels of acidity. Conversely, any value above seven indicates alkalinity, with higher numbers indicating a higher level of alkalinity. The pH sensor mainly measures the pH value of the water. The pH value is an indicator of the activity of hydrogen ions in a solution, that is, a measure of the acidity or alkalinity of the solution. In this article, the pH value of an outdoor aquaculture pond is collected through a pH sensor as a water quality sensor. Generally, the pH value of an aquaculture pond should be kept in the range of 8–8.5. The specifications of the adopted pH sensor [21] can be seen in Table II. TABLE II Specifications of the Adopted pH Sensor [21] The ORP sensor mainly measures the conductance of the water. The ORP, also known as the redox potential, refers to the electrode potential when an electroactive substance undergoes an electroreduction reaction. The redox potential is expressed in units of millivolts. Each electroactive substance has a specific reduction potential. The larger the redox potential value is, the stronger the electron-gathering ability of the substance. The redox potential can reflect the antibacterial ability of water. In a general aquaculture pond environment, the ORP should be in the range of approximately 150–250 mV. The specifications of the adopted ORP sensor [22] can be seen in Table III. TABLE III Specifications of the Adopted ORP Sensor [22] 3) Actuators: Fig. 4 shows photographs of the adopted actuators of the proposed system. Fig. 4(a) shows the photograph of the water pump. The water pump provides the pumping action for the proposed water sampling tank. The water pump is used to draw seawater into the proposed water sampling tank to be measured by the water quality sensors. Fig. 4. Water pumping and drainage devices. (a) Water pump. (b) Electric water valve. Show All Fig. 4(b) shows the electronically controlled water valve. This valve is used to control the drainage of the water tank to prevent the sensors from being soaked in seawater for a long time, which would affect their ability to measure the water quality. The specifications of the adopted water pumping device [23] can be seen in Table IV. The specifications of the adopted electric water valve device can be seen in Table V. TABLE IV Specifications of the Adopted Water Pump [23] TABLE V Specifications of the Adopted Electric Water Valve Furthermore, we use two relay modules to regulate the water tank’s pumping and draining. One controls the water pump, while the other operates the electric control valve, managing seawater flow during sampling. B. Hardware Design of the 24-H Water Sampling Tank Fig. 5 shows a flowchart of the operation of the 24-h water quality parameter sampling tank. The water tank is used to perform collection and sampling once every 5 min; the water tank has a delay of 20 s when the initial power-on is performed to initialize the equipment, and the water pump is started after 2 min. Fig. 5. Flowchart of the operation of the water quality parameter sampling tank. Show All The pump pumps water for 5 s. After 5 s, the pump is turned off. Then, the sampled seawater remained stagnant in the water tank for 2 min. Subsequently, the sensors collect water quality data. Then, the water valve is opened for 20 s to empty the seawater from the tank. Finally, the water valve is closed, and the above cycle continues until the unit is de-energized. C. Water Quality Monitoring Cloud Platform IDEASChain [24] is a free open cloud platform developed by the Digital Transformation Research Institute (DTRI), Institute for Information Industry (III), Taiwan. The IDEASChain cloud platform provides many development modules that allow users to quickly import and use IoT data applications, thus lowering the barrier to entry for IoT applications combined with cloud services. Therefore, in this article, IDEASChain is used as the cloud platform for water quality monitoring to store and analyze water quality data and finally present the data and analysis results in visual charts, as shown in Fig. 6.

Water Quality Prediction Model In this article, an SRU model [25] is used as the water quality prediction model. The specifications of the AI training server are as follows: an Intel Core i9-9900k CPU, an NVIDIA GeForce RTX 2080 Ti GPU, 11 GB of GDDR6 graphics memory, 32 GB of DDR4 RAM, and MS Windows 10 version 20H2. As shown in Fig. 1, when deep learning starts, data collection will be carried out through the cloud platform. After collection, the test data are processed by moving averaging and linear interpolation. Then, to train the SRU model, the test data are divided into a test set and a training set. All data in the training set are first fed into the SRU learning model for prediction, and the model parameters are adjusted accordingly to correctly predict the training data. Then, the test set is used to adjust the model trained on the training set to perform data cross-comparison, and the two sets are both input into the SRU model to be tested together. Finally, the model with its adjusted parameters is used to generate prediction results for real data. The design concept of the SRU model is to speed up model training without losing accuracy. In a traditional RNN model (such as an LSTM network), the output from the previous layer is used as the input to the current layer, and the transmission of information is controlled through neural gates to solve the problems of gradient explosion and vanishing. This concatenation of layers will affect the speed of model training. Therefore, the SRU model removes the dependence of the current input on the output of the previous layer; instead, only the update of the internal state depends on the output of the previous layer. Although the state calculation of an SRU is dependent on time, the state dimension is independent of time; thus, parallel processing can be performed. Fig. 7 illustrates the framework of the SRU model. x t represents the input at time t , f t represents the forget gate at time t , r t represents the reset gate at time t , and c t and h t represent the state and final output, respectively, at time t . Fig. 7. SRU model [25]. Show All We train an SRU model 300 times to perform predictive analysis on the 4 types of data collected, each time reading 64 pieces of data for training (4 pieces of data ×64 ). Finally, both the original data and the predicted data are displayed on a background chart to provide users with a convenient browsing experience. When abnormal data are collected, the user is prompted to adjust the equipment immediately. E. Data Preprocessing Because the environmental state is unpredictable in actual field operations, abnormalities may be present in the data received by the sensors, resulting in the occurrence of glitch waves, which will reduce the accuracy of model training. Therefore, data preprocessing is extremely important. To address this issue, we preprocess the data collected by each sensor, including the temperature, pH value, ORP, and DO data, by taking the moving average, as shown in (1). Here, x t +i represents the value we want to modify at the current moment, and n is the number of data items we want to average. We set n to 4, which means that every 4 pieces of data are processed to calculate the moving average. Please note that we utilize moving average processing for each sensor to maintain consistency in preprocessing and streamline the overall process x t+i = 1 n ∑ i=0 n−1 x t−i . (1) View Source In the establishment of deep learning models, differences in data units may be encountered, which may affect the results of statistical analysis. Standardization of the data can improve the convergence speed of a model and improve its accuracy. We convert the original data into scalars through a process of average standardization, as shown in (2), before comparing and analyzing the data. In (2), x max and x min are the maximum and minimum values of the data, respectively, and μ is the average value of the data. By normalizing to the average value, the data are scaled to the range of [0, 1], and the converted scalar values are then used to train the SRU model. x nom = x−u x max − x min ϵ[0,−1].

System Prototype As shown in Figs. 8–12, we designed a complete set of 24-h water sampling tank equipment to collect data with the water quality sensors and used a water pump to pump the seawater from the outdoor aquaculture pond into the water tank so that the water quality sensors could read the corresponding values.

(c) Entire proposed water quality inspection system mounted next to the actual experimental outdoor aquaculture pond. Show All To be more precise, we cut holes into the top of the water quality sampling tank and placed the water quality sensors through these holes to prevent algae from growing on them, as shown in Fig. 8. As shown in Fig. 9, the bottom of the water quality sampling tank was constructed from styrofoam and plastic hardboard to increase the inclination angle of the walls to ensure that the sampled seawater could flow smoothly to prevent water accumulation inside the tank to avoid the growth of algae. All joints of the water tank were sealed with silicone and hard adhesive to prevent water seepage. The electromagnetic water valve was placed at the bottom of the water tank to control water drainage so that the water quality sensors would not be soaked in water for a long time to avoid the growth of algae. Fig. 10 demonstrates the proposed water quality inspection system in the indoor experimental stage. Fig. 10(a) shows the proposed 24-h water quality sampling tank. Fig. 10(b) is actual hardware connecting IoT devices in a waterproof box. Fig. 10(c) is actual outdoor aquaculture pond water for real water quality inspection experiments. Fig. 10(d) is a Wi-Fi router for IoT module/device communications and control. The measured water quality data can be uploaded to a water quality monitoring cloud platform. Fig. 11 demonstrates a photograph of actual hardware connecting IoT devices in a waterproof box. The IoT module adopts the ESP32 module for sensor/actuator control, timing, and data uploading. Two relays are used for controlling water pumping and drainage devices. A sensor signal conversion board is used to receive and convert signals from water quality sensors to the IoT module for data processing and uploading to the water quality monitoring cloud platform. Finally, as shown in Fig. 12(a)–(c), we implemented the proposed system in the outdoor white shrimp aquaculture pond of the Department of Aquaculture, National Penghu University of Science and Technology (NPU), Penghu, Taiwan. The water stop gasket of the electric water valve may become clogged with algae and other impurities, as shown in Fig. 13, which would cause the valve to be unable to hold the water in the tank. These impurities are drawn into the tank together with the sampled water when the water pump is pumping. Since the water then drains through the water valve when the tank is drained, excessive impurities and algae from the water may become stuck inside the water valve, causing the water valve to fail. We found that too many impurities incapacitated the water valve. Many algae may grow in an outdoor aquaculture pond, and impurities can be easily drawn into the water tank by the water pump. Fig. 13. Clogged water valve. Show All Therefore, we improved the method of pumping water into the water tank to solve the problem of water valve blockage. Specifically, we added a filter screen at the pumping hole of the water pump to block larger impurities, thereby reducing the opportunity for impurities to become stuck inside the water valve. B. Experimental Results Experimental data were collected from the outdoor aquaculture pond using water quality sensors and transmitted to the water quality monitoring cloud platform (IDEASChain) through a 4G Wi-Fi wireless network for monitoring and storage. Data were collected every 5 min. The water quality data included temperature ( T ), pH, DO, and ORP parameters as the experimental data for model training. In Fig. 14(a)–(d), all data are presented as real (blue) and predicted (orange) data curves. The actual water quality parameters collected in the field in this experiment included T, pH, ORP, and DO. For each type of sampling data, 13000 records were collected, and an SRU model was adopted as the prediction model for training. In the experiment, the model’s performance was evaluated in terms of MAE, root-mean-square error (RMSE), and mean absolute percentage error (MAPE), as shown in the following equations: MAE RMSE MAPE = 1 n ∑ i=1 n ∣ ∣ x i − x P i ∣ ∣ = ∑ n i=1 ( x i − x P i ) 2 n − − − − − − − − − − − − − √ = 1 n ∑ i=1 n ∣ ∣ ∣ x i − x P i x P i ∣ ∣ ∣ .

Please note that a value closer to 0 means better performance. The experimental results were used to compare the performance of the water quality prediction model proposed in this article with that of an LSTM model. As seen from Tables VI–VIII, the performance of the SRU model is superior to that of the LSTM model.

Conclusion In this article, a full-time AIoT-based water quality inspection and prediction system for intelligent aquaculture has been proposed. IoT technology and deep learning technology are combined to perform regular monitoring and analysis of the water quality environment of outdoor aquaculture ponds. In addition, we established a water quality monitoring cloud platform based on the IDEASChain cloud platform to store water quality data for the prediction of water quality curves. From this platform, users can read access web pages to browse the collected monitoring data through mobile phones or other devices. The various water quality data collected include temperature data, DO data, pH data, and ORP data. Finally, we use a water quality prediction model to make predictions that can guide timely adjustments to aeration and other actions in response to future changes in the monitored outdoor aquaculture pond. Algae tend to grow on sensors in seawater, which can reduce their sensitivity and cause them to generate incorrect data; therefore, a 24-h sampling tank is used to solve this problem. Furthermore, an SRU model is used to generate predictions of the sensor data. The experimental evaluation results show that the proposed 24-h sampling tank and prediction scheme offer good performance. Therefore, the proposed method is useful for intelligent aquaculture. In summary, the main contributions of this article can be listed as follows. Introducing an AIoT-based approach that employs IoT and deep learning technologies to enable continuous water quality monitoring and predictive analysis.

A systematic review of automated systems for real-time irrigation management

1. INTRODUCTION
The challenge of feeding a growing population with finite resources is becoming increasingly pressing. By 2050, the world population is expected to reach 9.7 billion, necessitating a 70% increase in food production (Falkenmark and Rockstrom, 2009). Irrigation plays a crucial role in enhancing crop yields and agricultural productivity to meet this growing demand. Studies have shown that irrigation can significantly increase crop water productivity, contributing to increased food production (Ali and Talukder, 2008; Playan and Mateos, 2005). However, water scarcity poses a significant challenge, with many regions facing water deficits and the need for improved water management practices (Falkenmark and Rockstrom, 2009). Optimizing irrigation schedules and doses based on crop requirements and environmental conditions is essential for maximizing yield and quality while minimizing water use (Zhang et al., 2024). The necessity of scalable water-efficient practices for increasing food demand cannot be overstated. Techniques such as regulated deficit irrigation, magnetically treated water, and the use of drought-tolerant crops like sorghum have shown promise in improving water productivity and ensuring food security (Mehmood et al., 2023; Putti et al., 2023; Hadebe et al., 2016). As the global food challenge intensifies, it is imperative to critically evaluate the current state and future potential of irrigation management systems to guide research, innovation, and implementation efforts towards fully autonomous, scalable solutions.

Despite the importance of irrigation in addressing the global food challenge, traditional irrigation management techniques, such as manual scheduling and timer-based systems, have significant limitations. These methods are often labor-intensive, inefficient, and less adaptable to changing conditions (Savin et al., 2023). Manual and timer-based scheduling can lead to high operational costs and inefficient water use (Raghavendra, Han, and Shin, 2023). The reliance on manual intervention and predetermined schedules limits their adaptability to changing environmental conditions, crop water requirements, and soil moisture levels (Kaptein et al., 2019). Sensor-based irrigation systems offer an alternative, enabling real-time adjustments based on soil water status measurements (Kaptein et al., 2019). However, the adoption of these systems in commercial settings has been limited, often requiring extensive input from researchers (Kim et al., 2014; Lea-Cox et al., 2018; Ristvey et al., 2018). The limitations of traditional irrigation management techniques highlight the need for scalable, automated solutions for greater efficiency in irrigation management. Automated systems that collect real-time data, analyze it, and make autonomous irrigation decisions can lead to improved water use efficiency and increased crop productivity (Champness et al., 2023; Wu et al., 2022). To fully understand the potential of automated systems, it is necessary to examine the automation of each part of the irrigation management pipeline and analyze the effectiveness and efficiency of integrated end-to-end solutions.

The emergence of smart irrigation management and IoT marks a significant shift from historical irrigation practices. Modern approaches rely on vast data and analysis algorithms, leveraging technologies such as remote sensing, sensor networks, weather data, and computational algorithms (Atanasov, 2023; Bellvert et al., 2023; Kumar et al., 2023). IoT plays a vital role in collecting vast amounts of data through sensors, data transmission, and tailored networks, enabling real-time monitoring and control of irrigation systems (Liakos, 2023; Zuckerman et al., 2024). These advancements in data collection and analysis have the potential to revolutionize irrigation management, allowing for more precise and efficient water use. However, challenges such as processing diverse data sources, data integration, and lack of integrated data analysis hamper the full benefit of IoT in irrigation management (Dave et al., 2023). The current fragmented approach in smart irrigation, focusing on individual components rather than the entire system, limits the potential for fully autonomous, real-time end-to-end irrigation management (Togneri et al., 2021). To address these challenges and fully realize the potential of smart irrigation management, there is a need for automating and integrating each section of the irrigation management pipeline, from sensor/weather data collection and transmission to processing, analysis, decision-making, and automated action (McKinion and Lemmon, 1985). This integration requires a thorough investigation of the role of interoperability and standardization in enabling seamless communication and compatibility between components within the automated irrigation management pipeline.

Machine learning (ML) plays a significant role in processing vast data, predicting plant stress, modeling climate effects, and optimizing irrigation in smart irrigation management systems. ML algorithms can analyze data collected from sensors and weather stations to determine optimal irrigation schedules (Vianny et al., 2022). However, the potential of ML is often constrained by manual steps, such as data interpretation, decision-making on irrigation timing and volume, and system adjustments. Automating ML integration to allow direct action from insights to irrigation execution, removing bottlenecks and achieving real-time adaptability, is crucial for fully autonomous irrigation management (Barzallo-Bertot et al., 2022). By integrating ML into automated systems, the irrigation management pipeline can become more seamless and efficient, enabling real-time decision-making and action based on data-driven insights. To achieve this level of automation and integration, it is essential to identify gaps and propose solutions for seamless integration across the automated irrigation management system, aiming to achieve fully autonomous, scalable irrigation management.

To achieve seamless integration across the automated irrigation management system, interoperability and standardization are critical. Interoperability allows different system components, such as sensors, actuators, and software, to communicate and exchange data effectively, while standardization ensures that data is represented in a consistent format (Santos et al., 2020). Standardized protocols and data formats are essential for achieving seamless integration and ensuring compatibility between components in real-time irrigation management systems (Robles et al., 2022; Hatzivasilis et al., 2018). Existing and emerging standards, such as OGC SensorThings API and ISO 11783, have applicability to real-time irrigation management systems (Hazra et al., 2021). However, challenges such as data quality, scalability, reliability, and security need to be addressed to fully realize the potential of interoperability and standardization in automated irrigation management systems (Hazra et al., 2021). Addressing these challenges is crucial for enabling the seamless integration of components within the automated irrigation management pipeline, which is essential for achieving fully autonomous, scalable irrigation management. A comprehensive evaluation of the role of interoperability and standardization in enabling the integration of components within the automated irrigation management pipeline is necessary to guide future research and implementation efforts.
The primary objective of this systematic review is to critically evaluate the current state and future potential of real-time, end-to-end automated irrigation management systems that integrate IoT and machine learning technologies for enhancing agricultural water use efficiency and crop productivity.
Specific objectives include:
•	Examining the automation of each part of the irrigation management pipeline and the seamless integration of each section in the context of irrigation scheduling and management.

By addressing these objectives, this systematic review aims to provide a comprehensive and critical evaluation of the current state and future potential of real-time, end-to-end automated irrigation management systems. Its intention is to guide future research, innovation, and implementation efforts to achieve fully autonomous, scalable irrigation management that can contribute to addressing the global food challenge.

3. DATA COLLECTION TO CLOUD: AUTOMATION AND REAL-TIME PROCESSING
3.1. Irrigation management data
The success of automated irrigation management systems relies heavily on the collection, transmission, and analysis of various types of data. The most applicable data types for irrigation management include soil moisture, canopy temperature, weather data, and plant physiological parameters (Farooq et al., 2019; Li et al., 2019; Olivier et al., 2021; Evett et al., 2020). These data are typically collected from a range of sources, including in-field sensors, remote sensing platforms, weather stations, and manual measurements (Li et al., 2019; Karimi et al., 2018).
Soil moisture data is arguably the most critical type of data for irrigation management, as it directly reflects the water available to plants and can be used to determine the optimal timing and amount of irrigation (Olivier et al., 2021; Intrigliolo & Castel, 2006). Soil moisture sensors, such as tensiometers, capacitance probes, and time-domain reflectometry (TDR) sensors, can provide real-time measurements of soil water content at various depths (Farooq et al., 2019). These sensors can be deployed in a network configuration to capture spatial variability in soil moisture across a field (Karimi et al., 2018).
Canopy temperature data is another valuable type of data for irrigation management, as it can be used to assess plant water stress and adjust irrigation accordingly (Evett et al., 2020). Infrared thermometers and thermal cameras can be used to measure canopy temperature, which is influenced by factors such as air temperature, humidity, wind speed, and plant water status (Li et al., 2019). When plants experience water stress, they tend to close their stomata to reduce water loss, leading to an increase in canopy temperature (Evett et al., 2020). By monitoring canopy temperature and comparing it to reference values, automated irrigation systems can detect plant water stress and trigger irrigation events to maintain optimal plant health and productivity (Li et al., 2019).
Weather data, including temperature, humidity, precipitation, wind speed, and solar radiation, are essential for predicting crop water requirements and scheduling irrigation events (Akilan & Baalamurugan, 2024). Weather stations equipped with various sensors can provide real-time measurements of these parameters, which can be used as inputs for crop water requirement models, such as the FAO-56 Penman-Monteith equation (Li et al., 2019). These models estimate crop evapotranspiration (ET) based on weather data and crop-specific coefficients, allowing for the calculation of irrigation requirements (Intrigliolo & Castel, 2006). By integrating weather data into automated irrigation systems, irrigation schedules can be dynamically adjusted based on changing environmental conditions, ensuring that crops receive the optimal amount of water at the right time (Akilan & Baalamurugan, 2024).
When collecting and utilizing these data types, several considerations must be taken into account, including the volume, frequency, format, and source of the data (Farooq et al., 2019). The volume of data generated by automated irrigation systems can be substantial, especially when high-resolution sensors are deployed at a large scale (Bastidas Pacheco et al., 2022). This necessitates the use of efficient data storage, processing, and transmission technologies to handle the data load (Farooq et al., 2019). The frequency of data collection is another important consideration, as it directly impacts the temporal resolution of the data and the ability to detect rapid changes in plant water status or environmental conditions (Bastidas Pacheco et al., 2022). Bastidas Pacheco et al. (2022) demonstrated that collecting full pulse resolution data from water meters provides more accurate estimates of event occurrence, timing, and features compared to aggregated temporal resolutions, highlighting the importance of selecting appropriate data collection frequencies to ensure the quality and usefulness of the data for irrigation management.
The format of the data is also crucial, as it determines the compatibility and interoperability of the data with various analysis tools and platforms (Farooq et al., 2019). Standardized data formats, such as JSON, XML, or CSV, can facilitate data exchange and integration between different components of the automated irrigation system (Zhang et al., 2023). The source of the data is another important consideration, as it can impact the reliability, accuracy, and spatial coverage of the data (Farooq et al., 2019). For example, in-field sensors provide highly localized measurements, while remote sensing platforms, such as satellites or drones, can provide data at larger spatial scales (Li et al., 2019). By combining data from multiple sources, automated irrigation systems can achieve a more comprehensive understanding of crop water requirements and optimize irrigation management accordingly (Farooq et al., 2019).
Data quality, accuracy, and reliability are paramount in irrigation management, as they directly impact the effectiveness of decision-making processes and the efficiency of water use (Gupta et al., 2020). Inaccurate or unreliable data can lead to suboptimal irrigation decisions, resulting in crop stress, yield losses, or wasted water resources (Ramli & Jabbar, 2022). Gupta et al. (2020) emphasized the critical importance of data security and privacy in smart farming systems, as the leakage of sensitive agricultural data can cause severe economic losses to farmers and compromise the integrity of the automated irrigation system. The authors also highlighted the need for robust authentication and secure communication protocols to prevent unauthorized access to smart farming systems and protect data in transit (Gupta et al., 2020).
Ramli and Jabbar (2022) addressed the challenges associated with implementing real-time, automated irrigation systems, including data quality, scalability, reliability, and security. They proposed solutions and best practices based on the analysis of case studies and real-world implementations, such as the use of redundant sensors, data validation techniques, and secure communication protocols (Ramli & Jabbar, 2022). The authors also emphasized the importance of regular maintenance and calibration of sensors to ensure the accuracy and reliability of the collected data (Ramli & Jabbar, 2022).
Researchers have investigated the use of data compression, aggregation, and filtering techniques to reduce bandwidth requirements and improve transmission efficiency in automated irrigation systems (Karim et al., 2023; Rady et al., 2020; Cui, 2023). Karim et al. (2023) explored the effectiveness of various data compression techniques, such as lossless and lossy compression algorithms, in reducing the size of data packets transmitted over wireless networks. The authors found that lossless compression techniques, such as Huffman coding and Lempel-Ziv-Welch (LZW), can significantly reduce data size without compromising data quality, while lossy compression techniques, such as JPEG and MP3, can further reduce data size by introducing acceptable levels of distortion (Karim et al., 2023).
Rady et al. (2020) developed a novel data compression algorithm specifically designed for irrigation data, which achieved significant compression ratios without compromising data quality. The authors demonstrated that their algorithm could reduce the amount of data transmitted over wireless networks, thereby improving the efficiency of the irrigation system and reducing costs (Rady et al., 2020). Cui (2023) investigated the use of data aggregation and filtering techniques to reduce the number of transmissions and save bandwidth in automated irrigation systems. The author proposed a data aggregation scheme that combines multiple sensor readings into a single value, such as the average soil moisture over a specified time interval, to reduce the frequency of data transmissions (Cui, 2023). Additionally, the author explored the use of data filtering techniques, such as Kalman filters and particle filters, to remove noise and outliers from sensor data, improving the accuracy and reliability of the transmitted information (Cui, 2023).
Data standardization and harmonization are crucial for facilitating seamless integration and interoperability between the various components of automated irrigation management systems (Zhang et al., 2023; Ermoliev et al., 2022). Zhang et al. (2023) developed a novel cyberinformatics technology called iCrop, which enables the in-season monitoring of crop-specific land cover across the contiguous United States. The authors highlighted the importance of data standardization and harmonization in the context of iCrop, as it allows for the efficient distribution of crop-specific land cover information based on the findable, accessible, interoperable, and reusable (FAIR) data principle (Zhang et al., 2023). By adopting standardized data formats and protocols, such as the Open Geospatial Consortium (OGC) standards, iCrop enables the seamless integration of various data sources and facilitates the interoperability of the system with other agricultural decision support tools (Zhang et al., 2023).
Ermoliev et al. (2022) proposed a linkage methodology for linking distributed sectoral/regional optimization models in a situation where private information is not available or cannot be shared by modeling teams. The authors emphasized the need for data standardization to enable decentralized cross-sectoral coordination and analysis, as it allows for the consistent representation and exchange of data between different models and stakeholders (Ermoliev et al., 2022). By adopting standardized data formats and interfaces, the proposed linkage methodology can facilitate the integration of various optimization models and support the development of comprehensive decision support systems for sustainable resource management (Ermoliev et al., 2022).
Metadata plays a vital role in providing context and enabling better data interpretation and decision-making in automated irrigation management systems (Jahanddideh-Tehrani et al., 2021). Metadata refers to the additional information that describes the characteristics, quality, and context of the primary data, such as the sensor type, calibration parameters, measurement units, and timestamp (Jahanddideh-Tehrani et al., 2021). Jahanddideh-Tehrani et al. (2021) highlighted the importance of metadata in water resources management, as it enables decision-makers to use the data to the best of its capabilities by understanding factors such as when water data was collected and what factors might have contributed to the measurements. The authors emphasized the need for standardized metadata formats and guidelines, such as the Dublin Core Metadata Initiative (DCMI) and the ISO 19115 standard, to ensure the consistency and interoperability of metadata across different water information systems (Jahanddideh-Tehrani et al., 2021).
In the context of automated irrigation management systems, metadata can provide valuable information about the data collection process, sensor performance, and environmental conditions that can aid in data interpretation and decision-making (Cota & Mamede, 2023). For example, metadata about the sensor type and calibration parameters can help assess the accuracy and reliability of the collected data, while metadata about the weather conditions and soil properties can provide context for interpreting the data and adjusting irrigation strategies accordingly (Cota & Mamede, 2023). By incorporating metadata into the data management and analysis pipeline of automated irrigation systems, decision-makers can make more informed and context-aware decisions, leading to improved water use efficiency and crop productivity (Jahanddideh-Tehrani et al., 2021).

3.2. Edge Computing and Fog Computing
Edge computing and fog computing have emerged as transformative technologies in the realm of real-time irrigation management systems, offering significant potential for improving efficiency, scalability, and reliability (Abdel Nasser et al., 2020; Tran et al., 2019). Edge computing refers to the practice of processing data near the edge of the network, close to the source of the data, while fog computing is a decentralized computing infrastructure that extends cloud computing capabilities to the network edge (Hassija et al., 2019). These technologies bring computation and analytics closer to the data source, reducing the need for data to travel to the cloud and enabling faster processing and decision-making (Hassija et al., 2019; Zhang et al., 2020).
The potential of edge computing and fog computing in real-time irrigation management is immense. Abdel Nasser et al. (2020) proposed a two-layer system for water demand prediction using automated meters and machine learning techniques, demonstrating the potential of edge computing in improving the efficiency and scalability of irrigation management. The system collects and aggregates data from distributed smart meters in the first layer, while the second layer uses LSTM neural networks to predict water demand for different regions of households. By leveraging edge computing, the system can achieve high accuracy in predicting water demand, which is essential for efficient irrigation management (Abdel Nasser et al., 2020).
Tran et al. (2019) conducted a comprehensive review of real-time, end-to-end automated irrigation management systems, highlighting the role of fog computing in addressing data transmission challenges and enabling seamless integration across the irrigation management pipeline. The authors emphasize that real-time, end-to-end automated irrigation management systems have the potential to significantly improve water efficiency, crop yields, and reduce labor costs. However, they also identify several challenges that need to be addressed, such as data quality, scalability, reliability, and security, which can be effectively tackled by implementing fog computing architectures (Tran et al., 2019).
Edge computing offers several benefits in real-time irrigation management systems, including reduced latency, real-time decision-making, and reduced reliance on cloud connectivity (Mishra, 2020; Zhang et al., 2020). By processing data closer to the source, edge computing enables faster response times and more efficient data handling (Mishra, 2020). Mishra (2020) highlights that edge computing reduces latency by processing data closer to the source, enabling real-time decision-making and lessening reliance on cloud connectivity by shifting processing to local or edge devices.
Zhang et al. (2020) explore the application of edge computing in agricultural settings, demonstrating its potential to improve the efficiency and accuracy of irrigation systems. The authors discuss how edge computing has prospects in various agricultural applications, such as pest identification, safety traceability of agricultural products, unmanned agricultural machinery, agricultural technology promotion, and intelligent management. They also emphasize that the emergence of edge computing models, such as fog computing, cloudlet, and mobile edge computing, has transformed the management and operation of farms (Zhang et al., 2020).
Fog computing plays a crucial role in distributing processing and storage across the network, enhancing the scalability and reliability of automated irrigation systems (Premkumar & Sigappi, 2022; Singh et al., 2022). Premkumar and Sigappi (2022) evaluate the current state of automated irrigation management systems and propose a hybrid machine learning approach for predicting soil moisture and managing irrigation. Their study emphasizes the potential of fog computing in distributing processing and storage across the network, improving the efficiency and scalability of irrigation systems. The proposed hybrid machine learning approach outperforms other machine learning algorithms in predicting soil moisture, demonstrating the effectiveness of fog computing in enhancing the performance of automated irrigation systems (Premkumar & Sigappi, 2022).
Singh et al. (2022) discuss the role of fog computing in distributing processing and storage across the network, enhancing scalability and reliability in agricultural management systems. The authors argue that by implementing fog computing, these systems can achieve faster data processing and response times, improving overall efficiency and effectiveness. They also highlight that fog computing can address the challenges faced by real-time data transmission in agricultural management systems, such as latency, bandwidth limitations, and data security (Singh et al., 2022).
The integration of edge and fog computing in real-time irrigation management systems is crucial for achieving fully automated, scalable, and reliable solutions. As the demand for autonomous irrigation management grows, these technologies will play a pivotal role in enabling faster decision-making, reduced latency, improved resource utilization, and seamless integration across the irrigation management pipeline (Tran et al., 2019; Zhang et al., 2020). By bringing computation and analytics closer to the data source and distributing processing and storage across the network, edge and fog computing can significantly enhance the efficiency and effectiveness of automated irrigation systems, contributing to the overall goal of addressing the global food challenge through optimized water resource management and increased agricultural productivity (Abdel Nasser et al., 2020; Premkumar & Sigappi, 2022; Singh et al., 2022).

3.3. Automation of Data Collection
The automation of data collection is a critical component in the development of real-time, end-to-end automated irrigation management systems that integrate IoT and machine learning technologies. It enables the efficient gathering of vital information about crop health, environmental conditions, and water requirements, which is essential for enhancing agricultural water use efficiency and crop productivity. Two key aspects of automated data collection are the use of advanced sensing technologies for non-invasive plant stress detection and the implementation of wireless sensor networks and energy-efficient communication protocols for large-scale, long-term data collection.
Advanced sensing technologies, such as hyperspectral imaging and thermal sensing, have emerged as powerful tools for non-invasive plant stress detection in automated irrigation management systems. These technologies provide valuable information about crop traits, enabling early and accurate detection of plant health issues (Triantafyllou et al., 2019). Triantafyllou et al. (2019) propose a comprehensive reference architecture model that incorporates advanced sensing technologies in the sensor layer for real-time plant stress detection, highlighting their importance in providing non-invasive plant stress detection. Similarly, Hossain et al. (2023) present a novel IoT-ML-Blockchain integrated framework for smart agricultural management that leverages advanced sensing technologies to optimize water use and improve crop yield, contributing to the overall goal of enhancing agricultural water use efficiency and crop productivity.
Hyperspectral imaging can capture subtle changes in plant physiology that are indicative of stress, while machine learning algorithms can be employed to extract meaningful patterns from the spectral data and classify different stress types (Araus et al., 2014). Thermal sensing can detect changes in canopy temperature, which is influenced by factors such as plant water status (Li et al., 2019). By monitoring canopy temperature and comparing it to reference values, automated irrigation systems can detect plant water stress and trigger irrigation events to maintain optimal plant health and productivity (Li et al., 2019).
The integration of advanced sensing technologies in automated irrigation management systems has the potential to revolutionize precision agriculture. Jiang et al. (2019) demonstrate the effectiveness of a deep learning-based model in accurately detecting leaf spot diseases, highlighting the importance of image augmentation and deep learning algorithms in enhancing the model's performance.
Wireless sensor networks (WSNs) and energy-efficient communication protocols have the potential to significantly improve the efficiency and reliability of data collection in large-scale, long-term irrigation systems. WSNs offer a cost-effective and scalable solution for real-time data collection in large-scale irrigation systems, providing remote monitoring and automated control capabilities (Mehdizadeh et al., 2020). Nishiura and Yamamoto (2021) propose a novel sensor network system that utilizes drones and wireless power transfer to autonomously collect environmental data from sensor nodes in vast agricultural fields, reducing operational costs and enhancing the efficiency of data collection. Similarly, Higashiura and Yamamoto (2021) introduce a network system that employs UAVs and LoRa communication to efficiently collect environmental data from sensor nodes distributed across large farmlands, optimizing data collection and reducing travel distance and time.
Energy-efficient communication protocols are crucial for ensuring reliable data transmission in challenging environmental conditions and extending the lifespan of sensor nodes (Mehdizadeh et al., 2020). Al-Ali et al. (2023) investigate the potential of WSNs and energy-efficient communication protocols for data collection in large-scale, long-term irrigation systems, discussing the challenges and opportunities of using these technologies to improve the efficiency and reliability of real-time data collection in irrigation management. Mehdizadeh et al. (2020) emphasize the need for careful consideration of factors such as data accuracy, energy consumption, and network reliability when designing effective WSNs for irrigation management, enabling timely irrigation decisions and improved crop yields.
The automation of data collection through the use of advanced sensing technologies and wireless sensor networks is essential for achieving fully autonomous, scalable irrigation management. By enabling non-invasive plant stress detection and large-scale, long-term data collection, these technologies contribute to the overall goal of optimizing water resource management and increasing agricultural productivity. The integration of these technologies in real-time, end-to-end automated irrigation management systems has the potential to enhance agricultural water use efficiency and crop productivity, ultimately contributing to the development of fully autonomous, scalable irrigation management solutions.

3.4: Real-Time Data Transmission Protocols and Technologies
Real-time data transmission is a critical component of automated irrigation management systems, as it enables the timely delivery of sensor data to the cloud for processing and decision-making. The exploration of suitable protocols and network architectures is essential for ensuring efficient and reliable data transmission in these systems, contributing to the overall goal of enhancing agricultural water use efficiency and crop productivity.
The Message Queuing Telemetry Transport (MQTT) protocol has emerged as a popular choice for real-time data transmission in IoT networks, including those used for automated irrigation management. MQTT is a lightweight, publish-subscribe protocol designed for constrained devices and low-bandwidth networks (Author, 2019). Its simplicity and low overhead make it well-suited for IoT applications where data transmission speed and energy efficiency are critical (Saranyadevi et al., 2022). MQTT provides three Quality of Service (QoS) levels, ensuring data reliability in real-time scenarios (Author, 2019). Chen et al. (2020) proposed novel algorithms to improve data exchange efficiency and handle rerouting in MQTT-based IoT networks for automated irrigation management systems. Their TBRouting algorithm efficiently finds the shortest paths for data transmission, while the Rerouting algorithm effectively handles the rerouting of topic-based session flows when a broker crashes. The combination of these algorithms can significantly improve the performance and reliability of automated irrigation management systems (Chen et al., 2020).
Client-server IoT networks, such as those based on MQTT, play a crucial role in real-time data transmission for automated irrigation management systems. In these networks, sensors and devices (clients) publish data to a central broker (server), which then distributes the data to subscribed clients (Verma et al., 2021). This architecture enables efficient data collection, processing, and dissemination, facilitating the integration of various components within the automated irrigation management pipeline. Verma et al. (2021) proposed an architecture for healthcare monitoring systems using IoT and communication protocols, which provides a comprehensive overview of existing approaches and highlights challenges and opportunities in the field. Although focused on healthcare, the insights from this study can be applied to automated irrigation management systems, emphasizing the importance of interoperability and standardization for seamless integration (Verma et al., 2021).
In addition to MQTT, other application layer protocols such as XMPP, CoAP, SOAP, and HTTP have been explored for real-time data transmission in IoT networks. Each protocol has its strengths and weaknesses, making them suitable for different applications and scenarios. XMPP (Extensible Messaging and Presence Protocol) is an open-standard protocol that supports real-time messaging, presence, and request-response services (Saint-Andre, 2011). CoAP (Constrained Application Protocol) is a specialized web transfer protocol designed for use with constrained nodes and networks in the Internet of Things (Shelby et al., 2014). SOAP (Simple Object Access Protocol) is a protocol for exchanging structured information in the implementation of web services, while HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol) is the foundation of data communication for the World Wide Web (Fielding et al., 1999).
Motamedi and Villányi (2022) compared and evaluated wireless communication protocols for the implementation of smart irrigation systems in greenhouses, considering factors such as power consumption, range, reliability, and scalability. They found that ZigBee is the most suitable local communication protocol for greenhouse irrigation due to its large number of nodes and long range, while MQTT is the recommended messaging protocol for smart irrigation systems due to its TCP transport protocol and quality of service (QoS) options. GSM is a reliable and cost-effective global communication protocol for greenhouse irrigation, providing wide coverage and low cost (Motamedi & Villányi, 2022).
Syafarinda et al. (2018) investigated the use of the MQTT protocol in a precision agriculture system using a Wireless Sensor Network (WSN). They found that MQTT is suitable for use in IoT applications due to its lightweight, simple, and low bandwidth requirements. The average data transmission speed using the MQTT protocol was approximately 1 second, demonstrating its effectiveness for real-time data transmission in precision agriculture systems (Syafarinda et al., 2018).
The choice of application layer protocol for real-time irrigation management depends on factors such as data transmission speed, reliability, and energy efficiency. MQTT and RTPS (Real-Time Publish-Subscribe) are both suitable for real-time data transmission in IoT systems, but they have different strengths and weaknesses. MQTT is a better choice for applications that require low latency and high throughput, while RTPS is a better choice for applications that require high reliability and low latency (Sanchez-Iborra & Skarmeta, 2021). The exploration of MQTT and client-server IoT networks, along with the comparison of various application layer protocols, provides valuable insights into the suitability of these technologies for real-time data transmission in automated irrigation management systems.
In summary, real-time data transmission protocols and technologies play a vital role in the automation of irrigation management systems, enabling the efficient and reliable delivery of sensor data to the cloud for processing and decision-making. The exploration of MQTT and client-server IoT networks, along with the comparison of application layer protocols, highlights the importance of selecting suitable technologies based on factors such as data transmission speed, reliability, and energy efficiency. By leveraging these technologies, automated irrigation management systems can achieve seamless integration and contribute to the overall goal of enhancing agricultural water use efficiency and crop productivity.

3.5. Challenges and Solutions in Real-Time Data Transmission
Following the exploration of data collection, processing at the edge and fog, and automation in previous sections, we now turn to the critical aspect of real-time data transmission. While essential for automated irrigation management, this stage presents unique challenges that must be addressed to ensure system efficiency and reliability.
Obstacles in Real-Time Data Transmission
Agricultural environments present unique challenges for real-time data transmission, directly impacting the effectiveness of automated irrigation systems. Environmental factors can significantly disrupt wireless communication. Adverse weather conditions such as heavy rain, fog, and high winds can weaken or even block radio signals, leading to data loss and compromised system performance. Physical obstacles like trees, buildings, and uneven terrain further complicate signal propagation, creating reliability issues (Jukan et al., 2017; Yi & Ji, 2014; Zhang, Chang & Baoguo, 2018). These environmental challenges necessitate robust communication protocols and network architectures that can ensure consistent and reliable data flow.
In addition to environmental factors, technical limitations also present significant obstacles. Large-scale agricultural operations often demand long-distance data transmission, which can be hindered by the limited range of certain wireless communication protocols. Network congestion, occurring when multiple sensors transmit data concurrently, can lead to delays and potential data loss, further complicating real-time decision-making (Hameed et al., 2020). To mitigate these issues, researchers have investigated the potential of cognitive radio networks (CRNs) and dynamic spectrum access (DSA) for optimizing spectrum utilization and reducing interference (Righi et al., 2017; Shafi et al., 2018; Trigka & Dritsas, 2022). CRNs enable devices to intelligently sense and adapt to the surrounding radio environment, dynamically adjusting transmission parameters to avoid interference and improve communication efficiency. DSA, on the other hand, facilitates the dynamic allocation of unused spectrum, enhancing spectrum utilization and reducing congestion.
Furthermore, data security and privacy are paramount concerns in real-time irrigation systems. The sensitive nature of agricultural data, such as crop yields and farm management practices, necessitates robust security measures to prevent unauthorized access and data breaches (Gupta et al., 2020). Implementing secure communication protocols, authentication mechanisms, and encryption techniques is essential to protect data integrity and ensure the trustworthiness of the system.
Investigating Data Optimization Techniques
To enhance the efficiency and reliability of real-time data transmission in automated irrigation systems, researchers have explored a range of data optimization techniques. Data compression techniques aim to reduce the size of data packets transmitted over the network, minimizing bandwidth requirements and improving transmission speed (Rady et al., 2020; Karim et al., 2023). Lossless compression algorithms, such as Huffman coding and LZW, preserve data integrity while effectively reducing data size, ensuring that no information is lost during transmission (Cui, 2023). Lossy compression algorithms, such as JPEG and MP3, offer higher compression ratios but introduce a controlled level of data loss, which may be acceptable for certain applications where some loss of precision is tolerable (Karim et al., 2023). The choice between lossless and lossy compression depends on the specific application and the trade-off between data size and accuracy.
Data aggregation techniques provide another effective approach to optimize data transmission. By aggregating multiple sensor readings into a single representative value, such as average soil moisture or temperature, the number of transmissions can be significantly reduced, conserving bandwidth and energy resources (Cui, 2023). This is particularly beneficial in large-scale irrigation systems where numerous sensors are deployed across vast areas, generating substantial amounts of data. Additionally, data filtering techniques play a crucial role in improving data quality and reliability. Kalman filters and particle filters can effectively remove noise and outliers from sensor data, ensuring that only accurate and relevant information is transmitted and used for decision-making (Cui, 2023). This is essential for preventing erroneous data from influencing irrigation decisions and potentially leading to suboptimal water management.
Sensor calibration, drift correction, and fault detection are essential for maintaining data accuracy and reliability (Dos Santos et al., 2023). Regular calibration ensures that sensors provide accurate measurements over time, while drift correction techniques account for gradual changes in sensor readings due to environmental factors or aging. Fault detection mechanisms can identify and address sensor malfunctions or anomalies, preventing erroneous data from influencing irrigation decisions and potentially harming crops or wasting water.
Addressing the Challenges
Effectively addressing the challenges in real-time data transmission requires a multifaceted approach that encompasses environmental, technical, and data-related considerations. Implementing robust and adaptive communication protocols is crucial for overcoming interference and signal degradation caused by weather conditions and physical obstacles. Selecting appropriate protocols, such as LoRa or ZigBee, with suitable range and penetration capabilities can ensure reliable data transmission in challenging agricultural environments (Motamedi & Villányi, 2022). Additionally, employing techniques like frequency hopping and error correction codes can further improve communication resilience and mitigate data loss.
Optimizing network architecture is another key consideration. Deploying a distributed network architecture with edge and fog computing capabilities can significantly enhance data processing and transmission efficiency (Abdel Nasser et al., 2020; Tran et al., 2019). Edge devices can perform initial data processing and aggregation tasks, reducing the amount of data transmitted to the cloud and minimizing latency, while fog nodes can provide additional processing power and storage closer to the data source, enhancing scalability and reliability. This distributed approach alleviates the burden on the central cloud server and allows for more responsive and efficient irrigation management.
Data optimization techniques play a vital role in reducing bandwidth requirements and improving transmission efficiency. The choice of data compression, aggregation, and filtering techniques should be tailored to the specific requirements of the irrigation system, considering factors such as data type, accuracy needs, and available bandwidth. By carefully selecting and implementing these techniques, the overall performance and effectiveness of real-time irrigation systems can be significantly enhanced, leading to more sustainable water management practices and improved agricultural productivity.
By addressing these challenges and implementing appropriate solutions, real-time data transmission can become a reliable and efficient component of automated irrigation systems, contributing to the overall goal of achieving sustainable and productive agriculture in the face of growing food demands and water scarcity.

3.6. IoT Network Architectures and Variable Rate Irrigation (VRI) for Real-Time Irrigation
Real-time irrigation management systems heavily rely on the efficient and reliable transmission of data from sensors and weather stations to the cloud for processing and decision-making. However, agricultural environments present unique challenges to wireless communication, including adverse weather conditions, physical obstacles, and the limitations of wireless technologies. These challenges necessitate robust and adaptive solutions to ensure the consistent and timely flow of data, enabling truly autonomous irrigation scheduling.
Environmental factors, such as heavy rain, fog, and strong winds, can significantly disrupt wireless communication by attenuating or even blocking radio signals, leading to data loss and compromised system performance (Ed-daoudi et al., 2023; Jukan et al., 2017; Yi & Ji, 2014; Zhang, Chang & Baoguo, 2018). Dense vegetation, buildings, and uneven terrain create further complications by causing multipath propagation and shadowing effects (Yim et al., 2018; Gautam and Pagay, 2020). The study by Yim et al. (2018) on LoRa networks in a tree farm environment exemplifies these challenges, revealing reduced communication range and data reliability compared to theoretical expectations. This underscores the need for carefully selecting and optimizing communication protocols and network parameters to ensure reliable data transmission in such environments.
The study by Guzinski et al. (2014a) using a modified TSEB model further highlights the importance of high-resolution data in accurately capturing the spatial and temporal dynamics of energy fluxes influenced by environmental factors. This emphasizes the need for advanced data acquisition and processing techniques that can effectively represent the complexities of agricultural settings.
The limitations of traditional wireless communication technologies, such as limited range and network congestion, pose additional challenges for large-scale agricultural operations. Long-distance data transmission can be hindered by range limitations, while network congestion arising from numerous sensors transmitting concurrently can lead to delays and data loss, hindering real-time decision-making (Hameed et al., 2020). Addressing these challenges requires the exploration of advanced networking technologies that can optimize spectrum utilization, mitigate interference, and improve reliability and efficiency.
Cognitive Radio Networks (CRNs) and Dynamic Spectrum Access (DSA) offer promising solutions for optimizing wireless communication in agricultural settings. CRNs empower devices with the ability to intelligently sense and adapt to the surrounding radio environment, dynamically adjusting transmission parameters to avoid interference and improve communication efficiency (Righi et al., 2017; Shafi et al., 2018; Trigka & Dritsas, 2022). Research has explored the potential of CRNs in predicting Radio Frequency (RF) power to avoid noisy channels and optimize spectrum utilization (Iliya et al., 2014; Iliya et al., 2014). These studies demonstrate the effectiveness of combining optimization algorithms with artificial neural networks (ANNs) to enhance the accuracy and generalization of RF power prediction, enabling CRNs to make informed decisions about channel selection and avoid interference.
DSA complements CRN technology by dynamically allocating unused spectrum, further enhancing spectrum utilization and reducing congestion (Shi et al., 2023). The numerical model developed by Shi et al. (2023) showcases the potential of CRNs and DSA for optimizing wireless communication in challenging environments.
The integration of CRNs and DSA into the IoT network architecture requires careful consideration of spectrum sensing techniques, network topology, and data security. Research on cooperative spectrum sensing suggests that distributed approaches, where sensor nodes collaborate and share information, can significantly improve the accuracy and efficiency of spectrum sensing, particularly in dynamic environments (Trigka and Dritsas, 2022; Khalid & Yu, 2019). This collaborative approach enables a more comprehensive understanding of the radio environment and facilitates the identification of available frequency bands for data transmission.
The choice of network topology also impacts the performance and scalability of CRN-based irrigation systems. Mesh networks, where sensor nodes are interconnected and relay data for each other, offer enhanced resilience and coverage compared to star topologies where nodes communicate directly with a central gateway (Akyildiz & Vuran, 2010). However, mesh networks can be more complex to manage and may introduce additional routing overhead. The trade-off between network resilience and complexity needs to be carefully evaluated to select the most appropriate topology for a specific agricultural setting.
Data security and privacy are paramount concerns in IoT-based irrigation systems due to the sensitive nature of agricultural data (Gupta et al., 2020). Implementing secure communication protocols, authentication mechanisms, and encryption techniques is essential for protecting data integrity and ensuring system trustworthiness. Research on secure spectrum leasing and resource allocation algorithms for CR-WSN-based irrigation systems has demonstrated the potential of these technologies for enhancing security and efficiency (Hassan, 2023; Afghah et al., 2018).
In conclusion, the development of effective and reliable real-time irrigation management systems requires a comprehensive approach that addresses the challenges of data transmission in agricultural environments. The integration of robust and adaptive communication protocols, optimized network architectures, and advanced networking technologies like CRNs and DSA, along with a focus on data security and privacy, can contribute significantly to achieving the goal of autonomous and efficient irrigation scheduling.
4. AUTOMATED DATA PROCESSING IN THE CLOUD
4.1. Data Quality and Preprocessing
Data quality is paramount in automated irrigation systems as it directly influences the effectiveness of decision-making and water use efficiency. Issues like missing values, inconsistencies, and outliers arising from sensor malfunctions, environmental interference, or network problems (Lv et al., 2023) can significantly impact the performance of machine learning models used for irrigation scheduling and management.
Real-time data cleaning techniques are essential for addressing these challenges. Kalman filtering proves particularly effective in handling missing values and correcting erroneous readings by recursively estimating the system's state based on previous measurements and current sensor data, taking into account noise and uncertainty (Kim et al., 2020). Moving average techniques, by averaging consecutive data points, provide a more stable representation of the underlying trend, filtering out short-term fluctuations (Chhetri, 2023). For outlier detection, adaptive thresholding methods offer a dynamic approach, adjusting thresholds based on the statistical properties of the data to effectively identify anomalies and minimize false positives (Bah et al., 2021). These techniques are crucial in maintaining the integrity of real-time data streams and ensuring the accuracy of subsequent analyses.
Adaptive data preprocessing is essential for managing the diversity of data sources and formats commonly found in irrigation systems. Data normalization techniques, such as min-max scaling or z-score normalization, ensure that all features contribute equally to the analysis by transforming data values to a common scale (Pradal et al., 2016). This is crucial for preventing features with larger values from dominating the analysis and ensuring that all features are given equal consideration. Similarly, feature scaling methods, like standardization or normalization, optimize the range of feature values to improve the performance and convergence of machine learning models (Tortorici et al., 2024). By scaling features to a similar range, the influence of outliers is reduced, and the model's ability to learn from the data is enhanced.
Data fusion techniques play a critical role in integrating information from diverse sources, creating a more comprehensive and reliable dataset for irrigation management. Dempster-Shafer theory, a generalization of probability theory, allows for the expression of both uncertainty and the degree of conflict in evidence, making it suitable for fusing uncertain and conflicting data from heterogeneous sources (Sadiq and Rodriguez, 2004). This is particularly relevant in irrigation systems where data from different sensors may provide slightly different or even contradictory information due to sensor variations or environmental factors. Bayesian inference offers another powerful framework for combining information from multiple sources, updating the probability of a hypothesis as new evidence becomes available. By applying these techniques, data from soil moisture sensors, canopy temperature sensors, weather stations, and other sources can be integrated to provide a holistic understanding of crop water requirements and environmental conditions, leading to more informed and accurate irrigation decisions.
The impact of data quality extends beyond model accuracy to the robustness of machine learning models under varying conditions. Robust models should maintain consistent performance even when faced with data inconsistencies or unexpected situations. Techniques like data augmentation and domain adaptation can enhance model robustness by exposing the model to a wider range of data variations during training. Data augmentation involves generating additional training data by applying transformations or introducing noise to existing data, making the model more resilient to noise and variations in the real-world data. Domain adaptation techniques aim to adapt a model trained on one domain (e.g., a specific crop or geographic location) to perform well on another domain with different data characteristics. This is particularly relevant in irrigation management, where models may need to be applied to different crops, soil types, or climatic conditions.
The choice of data cleaning, preprocessing, and fusion techniques should be carefully considered based on the specific characteristics of the irrigation system and the available data. By selecting and implementing appropriate techniques, the accuracy, reliability, and robustness of machine learning models can be significantly improved, leading to more efficient and sustainable irrigation management practices.
4.2. Scalable and Autonomous Deployment using Containerization Strategies
The transition from data collection and transmission to efficient data processing requires a robust infrastructure capable of handling diverse workloads and data volumes. Containerization technologies, specifically Docker and Kubernetes, offer a promising solution for deploying and scaling data processing and machine learning modules within cloud environments like AWS, Azure, and GCP (Vargas-Rojas et al., 2024; Rosendo et al., 2022; Solayman & Qasha, 2023). Docker provides a standardized way to package applications and their dependencies into self-contained units known as containers, ensuring consistent and reproducible execution across different platforms (Rosendo et al., 2022). Kubernetes, acting as a container orchestrator, manages their deployment, scaling, and networking across a cluster of machines (Rosendo et al., 2022). This combination presents several advantages for automated irrigation management systems.
Firstly, containerization facilitates efficient resource utilization and scalability. By encapsulating applications and their dependencies, containers enable the isolation of resources and prevent conflicts between different modules (Vargas-Rojas et al., 2024; Solayman & Qasha, 2023). This isolation allows for the efficient allocation of resources, such as CPU, memory, and storage, to each container based on its specific needs. Kubernetes further enhances scalability by allowing for the automatic scaling of containers based on real-time demand, ensuring the system can adapt to varying workloads and data volumes, preventing bottlenecks, and ensuring responsiveness to changing conditions (Karamolegkos et al., 2023).
Secondly, containerization promotes portability and reproducibility. By packaging applications and their dependencies into a single unit, containers make it easy to move and deploy them across different cloud environments without the need for environment-specific configurations (Rosendo et al., 2022; Solayman & Qasha, 2023). This portability simplifies the development and deployment process, reducing the time and effort required to set up and manage the system. Additionally, containers ensure reproducibility by providing a consistent execution environment, regardless of the underlying infrastructure. This eliminates variability and ensures that the system will behave consistently across different deployments (Zhou et al., 2023).
Optimizing container orchestration and resource allocation is crucial to minimizing latency and maximizing throughput in real-time data processing pipelines. Techniques like auto-scaling and dynamic resource allocation play a critical role in this context (Hethcoat et al., 2024; Werner and Tai, 2023; Kumar et al., 2024). Auto-scaling automatically adjusts the number of container instances based on real-time demand, ensuring that sufficient resources are available to handle peak workloads while avoiding over-provisioning during periods of low demand (Hethcoat et al., 2024; Kumar et al., 2024). Dynamic resource allocation enables the fine-grained adjustment of resources allocated to each container based on its specific needs and the current workload (Werner and Tai, 2023). This ensures efficient resource allocation and provides each container with the necessary resources to perform its tasks effectively.
Performance monitoring tools, such as Kubernetes Metrics Server and Prometheus, are essential for gaining insights into the performance of containers and the overall system (Hethcoat et al., 2024; Kuity & Peddoju, 2023). These tools provide valuable data on key performance indicators, such as CPU and memory usage, network traffic, and application-specific metrics. By monitoring this data, administrators can identify bottlenecks, optimize resource allocation strategies, and continuously improve system performance (Hethcoat et al., 2024). This data-driven approach ensures that automated irrigation management systems can operate efficiently and reliably.
By integrating containerization technologies with optimization techniques and performance monitoring, automated irrigation management systems achieve the scalability, autonomy, and efficiency required for effective real-time data processing and decision-making. This approach facilitates a seamless and responsive system that can adapt to changing conditions and contribute to the overall goal of optimizing water resource management and increasing agricultural productivity.

4.3. Deploying ML Models for Data Processing
Transitioning from data collection, preprocessing, and transmission, the deployment of machine learning (ML) models marks a pivotal stage in the automated irrigation management pipeline. This stage entails utilizing cloud platforms to facilitate real-time data processing and inference, enabling data-driven decision-making for optimal irrigation management and ultimately contributing to fully autonomous, scalable irrigation management.
Several architectures and frameworks exist for deploying ML models on cloud platforms, each offering unique advantages and catering to different requirements. TensorFlow Serving, for instance, provides a high-performance system specifically designed for serving TensorFlow models (Abadi et al., 2016). This framework enables efficient and scalable inference, making it suitable for real-time applications where low latency and high throughput are crucial. For instance, in a large-scale irrigation system with numerous sensors generating data continuously, TensorFlow Serving can efficiently handle the high volume of inference requests and provide timely predictions for irrigation scheduling. Similarly, Apache MXNet Model Server offers a flexible and efficient solution for deploying models trained with MXNet, supporting a wide range of deep learning models and inference backends (MXNet Developers, 2015). This versatility makes it suitable for complex irrigation systems that may utilize different types of ML models for various tasks, such as predicting crop water requirements, detecting plant stress, or forecasting weather conditions. ONNX Runtime, on the other hand, provides a cross-platform inference engine compatible with various ML frameworks, including PyTorch, TensorFlow, and MXNet (Microsoft, 2017). This versatility enables the deployment of models in diverse environments, facilitating interoperability and reducing the need for model conversion. For example, an irrigation system that uses models trained in different frameworks can utilize ONNX Runtime to deploy them on a single platform without the need for time-consuming and error-prone model conversion processes.
Choosing the appropriate architecture or framework depends on several factors, including the specific ML framework used for model training, the desired level of performance and scalability, and the need for cross-platform compatibility. For instance, if the primary concern is low latency and high throughput for real-time inference, TensorFlow Serving might be the optimal choice for TensorFlow models. However, if flexibility and support for various deep learning models are required, Apache MXNet Model Server could be more suitable. In cases where cross-platform compatibility is essential, ONNX Runtime offers a versatile solution.
Once the ML model is deployed, optimizing its performance and resource utilization becomes crucial for ensuring the efficiency of integrated end-to-end automated irrigation systems. Model compression techniques, such as pruning and quantization, offer effective methods for reducing the size and computational requirements of ML models without compromising accuracy (Premkumar & Sigappi, 2022). Pruning involves eliminating unnecessary connections or neurons from the model, effectively streamlining its structure and reducing computational complexity. This can be particularly beneficial for deep learning models, which often have a large number of parameters and can be prone to overfitting. By removing redundant or less important connections, pruning can improve modelgeneralizability and reduce inference time. Quantization, on the other hand, involves reducing the precision of model parameters, typically from 32-bit floating-point numbers to lower-precision formats such as 8-bit integers. This reduction in precision leads to smaller model sizes and faster inference speeds, making it particularly beneficial for resource-constrained environments or real-time applications. For instance, in edge computing scenarios where ML models are deployed on devices with limited computational resources, quantization can enable efficient inference without sacrificing accuracy.
Furthermore, hardware acceleration through the utilization of GPUs or TPUs can significantly enhance model performance by leveraging specialized hardware designed for parallel processing (Premkumar & Sigappi, 2022). GPUs, with their massive parallelism and high memory bandwidth, excel at accelerating matrix operations and convolutions, which are fundamental computations in many deep learning models. This acceleration can significantly reduce inference time and enable real-time processing of sensor data for timely irrigation decisions. TPUs, specifically designed for deep learning workloads, offer even greater performance and energy efficiency for specific model architectures. These hardware accelerators can drastically reduce inference time, enabling near real-time decision-making and enhancing the responsiveness of automated irrigation systems. For example, in a scenario where immediate response to changing weather conditions or soil moisture levels is critical, hardware acceleration can ensure that irrigation decisions are made and executed promptly.
In addition to model compression and hardware acceleration, distributed training techniques play a crucial role in optimizing the training process for large-scale ML models. Techniques such as Horovod and BytePS enable the distribution of training across multiple machines, effectively parallelizing the process and reducing training time (Premkumar & Sigappi, 2022). This is particularly beneficial for complex models with a large number of parameters or when dealing with large datasets. By leveraging distributed training, irrigation management systems can train more sophisticated models and improve their predictive capabilities, leading to more accurate and efficient irrigation decisions. For instance, a system that utilizes a deep learning model with millions of parameters can benefit from distributed training to reduce training time from days to hours, enabling faster model iteration and improvement.
Integrating the deployed ML models with other components of the automated irrigation management pipeline is essential for achieving a fully autonomous and cohesive system and addressing the need for seamless integration across the automated irrigation management system. Standardized protocols, such as MQTT and CoAP, provide lightweight and efficient communication channels for exchanging data between these components (Poojara et al., 2023; Jimenez et al., 2020a; Gour et al., 2023). MQTT, with its publish-subscribe architecture, enables real-time data streaming and event-driven communication, making it suitable for transmitting sensor data, control signals, and inference results (Raikar & M, 2023). This enables the ML model to receive real-time updates on soil moisture, weather conditions, and plant health, allowing for dynamic adjustments to irrigation schedules based on the latest data. CoAP, designed for constrained devices and low-power networks, offers a web-transfer protocol for resource-constrained environments, enabling efficient communication between sensors, actuators, and the ML models (Raikar & M, 2023). This is particularly relevant in situations where sensors or actuators have limited processing power or battery life, as CoAP minimizes communication overhead and energy consumption. Additionally, RESTful APIs provide a standardized interface for accessing and controlling the ML models, enabling seamless integration with other software components and facilitating system management and monitoring (Wang et al., 2022). This allows for easy integration with existing farm management systems or third-party applications, creating a unified platform for comprehensive irrigation management.4.4. Online Learning in the Cloud
The complexities of real-time data processing in irrigation management necessitate the exploration of advanced techniques to continuously learn and adapt to the dynamic nature of agricultural environments. Online learning algorithms offer a promising solution, enabling the continuous update and improvement of machine learning models based on incoming real-time data. This adaptability is crucial for addressing the challenges of changing environmental conditions, such as weather patterns and crop growth stages, and optimizing irrigation decision-making to enhance water usage efficiency and crop productivity.
Several online learning algorithms have demonstrated potential for real-time data processing and model adaptation in the context of irrigation management. Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) facilitates the incremental update of model parameters with each new data point, allowing for efficient adaptation to changing data distributions (Bottou, 2010). This incremental learning process ensures that the model remains responsive to the latest conditions, minimizing the risk of outdated predictions and improving the accuracy of irrigation decisions. Passive-Aggressive algorithms, on the other hand, adjust model parameters only when a misclassification occurs, providing a computationally efficient approach for handling large data streams (Crammer et al., 2006). These algorithms offer a robust approach to handling noisy data, a common challenge in real-world sensor readings, by making small adjustments only when the model's prediction deviates significantly from the actual value (Fei et al., 2019). Online Random Forests extend the concept of random forests to the online setting, enabling the incremental construction and update of decision trees as new data arrives (Saffari et al., 2009). The continuous evolution of the ensemble ensures that the model remains relevant to the changing environment, capturing intricate relationships between variables and leading to more informed irrigation decisions.
Research in various domains highlights the importance of online learning for real-time data stream analytics. Snyder et al. (2020) explored the application of online learning techniques for identifying relevant tweets in real-time, improving situational awareness for first responders. The proposed interactive learning framework allows users to continuously label the relevance of incoming tweets, enabling the real-time refinement of the underlying machine learning model. This user-guided approach aligns well with the dynamic nature of irrigation management, where models need to continuously adjust to varying environmental conditions and crop water requirements. Similarly, research in the field of cyber-physical systems (CPS) underscores the need for online learning algorithms to effectively extract insights and knowledge from continuously generated data streams (Fei et al., 2019). These capabilities are crucial for enabling feedback loops between physical processes and cyber elements, facilitating the integration and optimization of CPS in irrigation management systems.
To implement online learning in cloud-based irrigation management systems, various architectures and frameworks can be considered. Apache Spark Streaming, Apache Flink, and AWS Kinesis provide scalable and fault-tolerant platforms for processing real-time data streams, allowing for the development of online learning pipelines that continuously ingest and analyze data to update machine learning models (Zaharia et al., 2012; Carbone et al., 2015; Amazon Web Services, 2023). These frameworks leverage serverless computing paradigms, automatically scaling resources based on the volume and velocity of incoming data, ensuring efficient resource utilization and responsiveness to fluctuations in demand (Fei et al., 2019).
Effectively managing the exploration-exploitation trade-off is crucial for optimizing online learning in irrigation management. Techniques such as Multi-armed bandits (Sutton & Barto, 2018), Bayesian optimization (Shahriari et al., 2016), and Reinforcement Learning (RL) (Sutton & Barto, 2018) can be employed to balance the allocation of resources between exploring new irrigation strategies and exploiting the current best-performing approaches. These techniques enable the identification of optimal irrigation policies, adapting to changing environmental conditions and maximizing long-term rewards.
In conclusion, online learning techniques, coupled with scalable cloud-based architectures, offer a powerful solution for real-time data processing and continuous adaptation in irrigation management systems. By leveraging algorithms like SGD, Passive-Aggressive, and Online Random Forests, along with stream processing frameworks like Apache Spark Streaming, Apache Flink, and AWS Kinesis, irrigation management systems can effectively handle the complexities of real-time data, optimize water usage, and enhance crop productivity in the face of dynamic environmental conditions.

Experimental Results Show Full Outline Authors Figures References Keywords Metrics Footnotes Abstract: This article presents a novel system that produces multiyear high-resolution irrigation water demand maps for agricultural areas, enabling a new level of detail for irrigation support for farmers and agricultural stakeholders. The system is based on a scalable distributed deep learning (DL) model trained on dense time series of Sentinel-2 images and a large training set for the first year of observation and fine tuned on new labeled data for the consecutive years. The trained models are used to generate multiyear crop type maps, which are assimilated together with the Sentinel-2 dense time series and the meteorological data into a physically based agrohydrological model to derive the irrigation water demand for different crops. To process the required large volume of multiyear Copernicus Sentinel-2 data, the software architecture of the proposed system has been built on the integration of the Food Security thematic exploitation platform (TEP) and the data-intensive artificial intelligence Hopsworks platform. While the Food Security TEP provides easy access to Sentinel-2 data and the possibility of developing processing algorithms directly in the cloud, the Hopsworks platform has been used to train DL algorithms in a distributed manner. The experimental analysis was carried out in the upper part of the Danube Basin for the years 2018, 2019, and 2020 considering 37 Sentinel-2 tiles acquired in Austria, Moravia, Hungary, Slovakia, and Germany.

Introduction The continuous acquisition of Sentinel-21 Copernicus data represents a unique opportunity to constantly monitor the Earth's surface at high spatial resolution. In the context of water irrigation management, Earth observation (EO) data are essential to improve water resource planning, efficient irrigation practices, monitoring of irrigation infrastructure, and early detection of droughts or floods, allowing the continuous monitoring of large-scale hydrological processes without the need of in situ measurements [1]. The extreme scale of such a growing volume of data requires a paradigm shift from the traditional approach of downloading, replicating, and exploiting data on local servers to a dynamic and scalable approach where the data are processed directly in the cloud. In this context, the European Space Agency (ESA) launched the thematic exploitation platforms (TEPs) in 2014 covering seven main categories: Coastal, Forestry, Geohazards, Hydrology, Polar, Urban, and Food Security. Each platform is a collaborative, virtual work environment that facilitates the access to and the exploitation of the Copernicus Big Earth observation data. Although the offered working environments provide computational resources to develop processing algorithms online, these are not sufficient for supporting cutting-edge artificial intelligence (AI) techniques aimed at advanced computing applications. In the remote sensing (RS) community, Deep learning (DL) models are more and more considered to classify effectively and efficiently continuously acquired satellite data [2], [3], [4]. The development of distributed scalable DL models requires high-performance computing platforms and GPU accelerators, which should be properly integrated with the thematic exploitation platforms (TEPs). In this context, such data and architectures can bring significant advantages to food security applications [5], [6]. These include the monitoring of agricultural areas, and in particular, the mapping of water availability and crop water demand both at field and regional scale. Indeed, in recent years, severe droughts started to hit regions typically not affected by such events, due to the lack of rain in spring/summer. The increasing spatial distribution, frequency, and severity of such events requires the monitoring of the crop water demand to mitigate the implications on food availability and plan government interventions for new infrastructures and irrigation strategies. The production of such irrigation maps is essential not only to optimize the irrigational resources, but also to improve the crop performance, mitigate the environmental impacts, preserving the soil health, the water quality, and the ecosystem integrity. Existing methods for water demand estimation based on RS data often use hyperspectral images [7] for crop mapping. While such data provide very detailed spectral information, they lack in terms of both temporal resolution and spatial coverage. This strongly limits their use at the national or continental scale. Moreover, Sentinel-2 data are freely accessible and available, with a short revisit time of five days and spatial resolution of 10 m, making them suitable for agricultural applications at the crop field level. Hyperspectral images usually have a higher spatial resolution (30 m in average) and a smaller geometric field of view (GFOV), resulting in a wider revisit time gap. This limitation is common also to methods that use data acquired from unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) [8]. Other methods [9] work at large scale using data acquired by low-resolution sensors such as moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer (MODIS) thus making the field level monitoring unfeasible, as parcel sizes are often smaller than the MODIS spatial resolution. In recent years, significant efforts have been made to link computing platforms with cloud platforms [10], [11] storing high spatial resolution EO data, to enable efficient and effective use of satellite data for specific thematic applications. In particular, the connection of such platforms is essential for the following: access the data from various sources, removing the need to search and retrieve data manually; process the data and perform the analysis on RS data; customize and automate the workflows to specific thematic needs; integrate models and algorithms; promote collaboration and knowledge sharing among researchers and users in the RS community. However, existing approaches are typically focused on a single-year map production and on relatively small study areas, whereas little has been done to study how to produce irrigation maps at a large scale and on a continuous basis. This article aims to address these issues by answering the following operational and interrelated research questions. How can an end-to-end workflow be designed to effectively integrate and process satellite and meteorological data to efficiently produce irrigation maps at large scale? How can we define a system being able to ingest the continuous stream of recently acquired satellite and meteorological data to regularly generate up-to-date irrigation maps? To address these issues, the main novelties of this article are twofold. To propose an end-to-end workflow that integrates the Food Security TEP and the Hopsworks platform to implement a dynamic and scalable approach where the data are processed directly in the cloud through computationally demanding DL models. To define a novel system for producing high-resolution multiyear maps of water requirements at crop level to enable effective agricultural water management activities (i.e., continuous irrigation recommendations at crop level). In greater detail, this article presents an efficient and effective workflow for the continuous production of high spatial resolution (10 m) annual maps for large-scale water demand assessment computed at crop level. The workflow makes extensive use of the information provided by the time series of Sentinel-2 EO data to generate continuously updated crop type maps (exploiting DL) and crop-based agrohydrological models (designed to assimilate the leaf area index (LAI) and the same Sentinel-2 EO data used for crop type mapping). This article is organized into seven sections. Section II discusses related works. Section III presents the proposed system architecture for crop mapping and assessment of irrigation demand. Section IV describes the study area and the considered dataset. Section V illustrates the experimental results in terms of annual crop type maps (Sections V-A and V-B) and annual irrigation water demand (Sections V-C and V-D). Section VI reports the findings of the research and comments the results. Finally, Section VII concludes this article, while details of the processing architecture can be found in the Appendix. SECTION II. Related Works As recently remarked from the new European Green Deal [12], sustainable food production plays a central role to guarantee food security. In this context, a critical issue is the implementation of agricultural policies for an efficient and sustainable management of crops and in particular of the natural resources such as water. For the generation of field specific irrigation water demand maps, a key component is the knowledge of the planted crop types. Knowing the crop type allows the derivation of the photosynthetically active leaf area in a crop-type specific way and ultimately allows to calculate the water demand of different crops over the year [13], [14], [15]. Recently, several works have focused on the production of crop type maps on country or continental scale due to the availability of high-resolution time series of multispectral satellite data acquired with a short revisit time such as Sentinel-2 (i.e., up to 5 days) [16], [17], [18]. The temporal information allows modeling the phenological trends of different cultivation [19], which results in an accurate mapping of the crop type [20], [21]. Ibrahim et al. [16] present an automatic approach to map the main cultivation present in Nigeria based on Sentinel-2 time-series and very-high-resolution SkySat data. In [17], Sentinel-2 time series are used together with the Eurostat land use and coverage area frame survey (LUCAS) [22], [23] to generate a 10-m crop type map for the European Union (EU) for 19 crop types in 2018. Both approaches presented in [16] and [17] consider a random forest (RF) classifier, which is widely used for large-scale mapping [24]. However, Rußwurm et al. [25] compared seven deep neural networks classifiers with an RF baseline, showing that multitemporal DL approaches significantly outperform the RF classifier for the crop type mapping problem. To emphasize the temporal information provided by the time series of Sentinel-2 images, three main categories of DL models were considered, i.e., attention-based models [26], recurrence-based models [27], and time-convolution-based models [28]. The accuracies obtained by the attention-based transformer model [29] and the recurrent models (i.e., long-short-term memory (LSTM) [30] and Star recurrent neural network (RNN) [31]) were similar, and in overall, higher compared to those of RF and time-convolution-based models [32]. In addition to the mapping of crop types, several approaches have been defined for monitoring crop water stress and assessing irrigation water demand. The latter is becoming ever more important, as water availability changes with climate change. Thus, approaches using different types of remotely sensed information are being developed. Thermal data have long been used as a basis to determine water stress. The crop water stress index, originally proposed by [33] and looking at the difference between crop canopy and ambient air temperatures, is one of the earliest examples of such indicators. More recently, this approach has been adapted so that it can be derived purely based on RS data, particularly Landsat 8 thermal data [34]. However, the bottleneck of Landsat 8 pertains to its low revisit frequency (16 daily), making it less suitable for near-real-time monitoring of crop water stress. In the absence of current high-resolution thermal missions with high revisit frequencies, researchers have looked for ways to detect crop water stress from optical imagery. Taking advantage of different portions of the electromagnetic spectrum, both multispectral and hyperspectral data are used to estimate leaf water content [35], [36], [37], [38], [39], [40], chlorophyll content [38], and xanthophyll content [38], [41] as indicators to detect water stress. Early signs of water stress are well detectable based on the near-infrared [35] or short-wave infrared part of the spectrum due to the increased reflectance near the water absorption bands or the visible (VIS) part reduced by changes in chlorophyll content [42]. Algorithms range from narrow-band spectral indices [42] over linear nonparametric regression methods such as partial least squares regressions [43], [44] to physically based radiative transfer models [36], [45], [46]. Beyond the variables that can be directly derived from EO data, additional information about the crops can be derived by crop growth modeling [47]. Using a crop growth model, soil moisture can be modeled in different soil layers and the influence of irrigation can be simulated. Thus, variables like plant water demand, water availability, and water use efficiency can be derived [48], [49]. Unlike approaches based on simple spectral indices, crop growth models allow a precise agricultural analysis at the crop level, thus enabling a better management of inputs (e.g., irrigation). However, these models are generally not used in large-scale operational workflows due to the need for crop type maps. Ensuring accurate crop type maps implies integrating DL models applied to long time series of data into the workflow, which entails the need tohandle a large volume of EO data, and have high computational resources. Existing virtual work environments, which facilitate access to large volumes of data, offer limited computational resources, thus requiring to transfer large volumes of data to local servers where DL architectures should be trained for accurate crop type mapping. Another major limitation of the literature methods is their focus on producing single year analysis. In order to monitor agricultural areas, multiyear mapping is essential to continuously provide up-to-date information. Due to both crop rotation practice and changes in the image acquisition conditions as well as the crop phenology, the class statistical distributions usually vary between years leading to a decrease of performances of a DL classifier trained on a given year when applied to a different one [50]. For this reason, it is necessary to fine tune the initial DL model on recently acquired EO data, which still requires additional computational resources. SECTION III. Proposed System for Crop Mapping and Irrigation Demand Assessment Fig. 1 depicts the developed end-to-end work flow, which starts with the Level 1c Sentinel-2 data available on the Food Security TEP and ends with the annual irrigation water demand maps. First, the dense time series of Sentinel-2 are preprocessed in the Food Security TEP to perform the atmospheric correction, cirrus correction, cloud, and cloud shadow masking. The obtained atmospherically corrected images are further processed to generate a time series of 12 monthly composites per tile. To this end, the scalable distributed DL model is trained on the Hopsworks platform from scratch for the first year of operations, whereas it is fined tuned for the next years. The Hopsworks performs the training of the model on a parallel architecture while abstracting away the complexities of distributed computing from the user. This allows the user to focus only on the definition and configuration of the model, simplifying and accelerating the development and testing process. The trained models are then deployed on the Food Security TEP where they are used to perform the inference. In such a way, all the data processing and inference is performed on the TEP independently of the utilized model and its training. Finally, the crop type maps are provided as input together with the meteorological data and the atmospherically corrected images to the agrohydrological model employed to assess the water demand per crop field. In the following subsections, details are provided. Fig. 1. End-to-end work-flow of the proposed system. While the training of the DL models requires the distributed Hopsworks platform, the other steps are processed directly in the Food Security TEP. Show All A. Satellite Data and Time-Series Image Preprocessing The time series of Sentinel-2 data are the input to the production of both the crop type and the water demand maps. Starting from Sentinel-2 Level 1c data, VISTA's image processing chain implemented in the Food Security TEP performs a high-quality atmospheric correction, including high-accuracy cloud and cloud shadow masking as well as cirrus correction. After the atmospheric correction, we selected the bands having a spatial resolution of 10 and 20 m, performing a nearest neighbor interpolation on the 20-m bands to match the resolution of the highest spatial resolution channels. The atmospherically corrected data are further processed before training the DL model to harmonize the time series from the temporal view point, i.e., generate time series of uniform length across the study area. To this end, a time series of 12 monthly composites is computed per Sentinel-2 tile using a statistic-based approach working at the pixel level. Let us consider a time series of N Sentinel-2 images acquired in a given month and let us focus on one individual pixel. Let X=[ x 1 , x 2 …, x S ] be the multitemporal spectral vector of the individual pixel composed by S spectral channels, where x s =[ x 1 s , x 2 s ,…, x N s ] represent the reflectance values of band s for each date, with s∈[1,…,S] . Working separately on each spectral channel, the N reflectance values are collapsed into a single one (representing the month) by computing their median. Given the median operator M , the monthly composite computation for one pixel is as follows: x c,s =M{ x 1 s , x 2 s ,…, x N s }∀s∈[1,…,S]. (1) View Source The resulting spectral vector of the composite of one month for a pixel is x c =[ x c,1 , x c,s ,…, x c,S ] . This operation is performed for each month and for each pixel obtaining a multitemporal spectral vector composed of S×12 features, i.e., S reflectance values for 12 months. Note that the median operator is applied after discarding cloudy, snowy, and shadowy samples using the masks provided by the atmospheric correction step. If no images are available for a given pixel for a month (e.g., due to cloud coverage), the harmonization process sets all the reflectance values of the month to zero. In this way, we ensure the uniform length of the time series. Moreover, this allows the DL model to handle the missing data by relying on the information provided by the rest of the time series [51]. Indeed, the approach is based on the assumption that a sufficient number of images is available for each month to reliably generate the composite. This assumption is reasonable due to the short revisit time of the Sentinel-2 constellation (i.e., up to 5 days). Furthermore, this step clearly mitigates the problem of missing data values in the images due to cloud cover. B. Distributed DL Model for Crop Type Mapping In order to accurately perform crop type classification, it is necessary to model the phenological trends of the different crops during the year [52]. To extract this information from the time series of 12 monthly composites, we considered a multitemporal DL architecture based on the LSTM architecture. This model has been selected due to its internal feedback connections, which are designed to model sequential data by exploiting previous observations to analyze current ones [53], [54]. Fig. 2 provides an overview of the training and classification flow for the crop type map generation, which predicts the crop type at pixel level focusing on the agricultural areas. The adopted network consists in a multilayer LSTM, where the first three layers have 200, 125, and 100 hidden units, respectively, followed by a fully connected layer and a softmax layer. The softmax layer is the one where posteriors are extracted and pixel-level classification is performed. The proposed architecture has been trained on the Hopswork platform according to a distributed strategy to distribute the workload across multiple workers each having one GPU. In this work, the architecture has been trained on two workers each having one GPU. It is worth mentioning that training the network considering two GPUs is considerably faster than training with single worker (i.e., ca. 50% of the time saved using two GPUs). However, due to the Hopswork platform, the distributed strategy can be easily scaled allowing for the use of more GPUs, further reducing the training time. Fig. 2. Flow scheme showing the training of the LSTM model on the Hopswork platform and its use on the Food Security TEP to generate the crop type map. Show All C. Crop Type Map Production and Update After the LSTM has been trained, it is deployed on the Food Security TEP where the Sentinel-2 data are prepared to be fed to the network in the following two steps: 1) preprocessing, and 2) masking of the pixels outside agricultural areas. The first step aims to transform the time series into the format expected by the network, i.e., the 12 monthly composites, each representing a month in the selected agronomic year, according to what was presented in Section III-A. The second step aims at focusing the analysis only on agricultural areas. For this purpose, we employed the publicly available PAN-European high-resolution layer (HRL) [55], which provides information on several specific land cover characteristics at 10-m spatial resolution, including crop locations. The crop type map is generated by providing the 12 masked monthly composites to the trained network per Sentinel-2 tile to be classified. After the generation of the crop type map, few standard morphological operators are applied. This postprocessing step allows us to remove pixel-level noise leveraging the spatial correlation. In particular, an opening operation followed by an erosion using a structuring element of size 2×2 is applied to the crop type map at class level. Finally, all labeled areas smaller than a minimum threshold of 15 pixels are discarded. The filtering parameters have been defined according to the spatial resolution of the Sentinel-2 data and the minimum area of individual fields to be identified. The architecture described so far illustrates the crop type mapping approach for the one-year scenario. However, the goal of the proposed workflow is to continuously monitor the considered agricultural area. To this end, we aim to exploit the DL model trained in 2018 to classify the new target years, i.e., 2019 and 2020, as building a new dataset for training a new model from scratch is not feasible at the operational level. However, the application of a pretrained architecture to new target years requires the definition of a domain adaptation strategy since the spectral signature changes over time and the model gradually loses its ability to correctly map crop types as the time gap between different years increases. In order to adapt the reference year architecture to the new target years, first the irregular Sentinel-2 time series acquired in 2019 and 2020 are reprojected on the same regular time grid by exploiting the monthly composite strategy described in Section III-A. Then, the multiyear time series are harmonized in order to match the radiometric characteristics of the one used in the pretrained network, i.e., the time series of the reference year [56]. In particular, each monthly composite is initially normalized in order to have zero mean and unit variance at band level, and then, the normalized composite is processed to match the mean and the variance of the corresponding monthly composite in the reference year. Finally, we adapted the LSTM trained on 2018 considering a relatively small number of training samples for 2019 and 2020 compared to the training set used to train the architecture on the target year. These samples are used to perform the fine tuning of the pretrained network in the following two steps: the last fully connected layer is trained, while the other layers are frozen; the whole unfrozen network is trained considering a low learning rate. The first step allows the network to quickly reach a convergence, while the training of the previous layers allows the optimization of computational time and avoids the divergence from the original network [57]. By employing this approach, we can adapt the performance of the DL architecture to the new target years using a small number of training samples compared to the number of model parameters. D. Irrigation Water Demand Map Generation To estimate the irrigation water demand at the parcel level, the proposed end-to-end workflow leverages the well-established processes of mass and energy transfer (PROMET) model. Over the past three decades, this crop-based agrohydrological model has been employed in both scientific and service operations because of its capability of simulating all relevant energy and mass fluxes on a physical basis. Currently, this model is operationally applied to smart farming services and specifically used for irrigation advice. Moreover, the PROMET model has been designed to assimilate the LAI and the same EO data used to generate the crop type maps, thus leading to consistent output products. The main advantages of using the PROMET growth model in the considered workflow are as follows: it allows a spatial and temporal dynamic calibration by using observed variables like measured leaf area and phenological developments [59]; it provides water recommendation at individual crop level [60]; it can model 15 different crop types [61]. Fig. 3 shows the various components of the PROMET model, which is able to integrate EO-derived land information (i.e., crop types and LAI) and meteorological data to receive an up-to-date consistency between simulated and observed variables. The crop water demand for transpiration is calculated for each hour based on the simulated potential photosynthesis. If soil moisture conditions do not suffice this water demand and irrigation is not applied, photosynthesis is reduced accordingly. As an alternative, the amount of irrigation required to avoid water stress of the crop can be calculated. Hourly values are aggregated over a longer time period (e.g., 5–7 days) and irrigation advice for the next days is provided to the farmers using meteorological forecasts in the simulations. Fig. 3. Modules of the PROMET model and their connections and interfaces (modified from [58]). Show All Fig. 4 shows the reasoning for integrating the Sentinel-2 based crop type maps and the LAI monitoring for the land surface processing. Based on model simulations, all relevant crop and water information layers can be obtained and the related maps be generated. The spatial scale for the crop water demand simulations is 10 × 10 m, which corresponds to the spatial sampling distance of Sentinel-2. This allows us to do a direct comparison with the 10 × 10 m Sentinel-2 image. This means that for each sample point the crop type and the leaf area development can be derived from the corresponding Sentinel-2 pixel. The leaf area is retrieved by model inversion using the radiative transfer model soil-leaf-canopy [46] over the Sentinel-2 time series and temporally interpolated to daily values using the harmonic analysis of time series (HANTS) algorithm [62]. The leaf area information is then assimilated into the crop growth model PROMET in order to realistically simulate variables as photosynthesis and transpiration. Fig. 4. Approach used based on EO and crop type maps for water demand calculations. Show All SECTION IV. Dataset Description and Experimental Setup This section describes the considered study area, the EO and meteorological data used to perform the experimental analysis, and the validation dataset used to assess the accuracy of the obtained results summarized in Table I. Finally, details on the experimental setup are provided. TABLE I List of Dataset Used to Perform the Result Assessment A. EO and Meteorological Data The considered study area is covered by 37 Sentinel-2 tiles located in the Danube catchment, Europe's second largest river basin. The basin is characterized by different geographic regions ranging from the cold and humid Alps to the warm and more arid regions in the East allowing for the testing of the method under different conditions. Three agronomic years were considered (i.e., 2018, 2019, and 2020), amounting to a total of more than 9 TB of preprocessed Sentinel-2 data made up of nine spectral bands at 10-m spatial resolution. The data available in the Food Security TEP include all the high spatial resolution spectral bands (i.e., 10 and 20 m) except for Band 8, which is discarded because of its coarser spectral resolution compared to Band 8A. The meteorological data used in PROMET are based on downscaled model outputs from the German Weather Service German weather service (DWD). The used freely available COSMO ICON EU dataset offers hourly time steps that fit with the temporal resolution used in the PROMET model to simulate water balance components (e.g., soil moisture, surface runoff, transpiration, evaporation, and interception). B. Validation Dataset 1) DL Model To validate the crop type maps, we considered the following: publicly available land parcel identification system (LPIS) crop type maps in Austria for the three agronomic years, which are based on farmer declarations [63]; the 2018 LUCAS database samples available for the whole study area for the 2017–2018 agronomic year; the 2018 Bavarian crop type map, which is based on farmer declarations and available within the ExtremeEarth project provided by the Bavarian Ministry of Agriculture (“Bayrisches Staatsministerium für Ernährung, Landwirtschaft und Forsten”). The 2018 LUCAS database and the Bavarian map are used to determine the spatial generalization capabilities of the model, i.e., in areas where no training samples are available (all Sentinel-2 tiles outside of Austria). The LUCAS database is extremely reliable since is based on in situ surveys collected by expert surveyors in the field. For more information, please consult Eurostat's technical reference document on the quality control procedure.2 Similarly, the Bavarian map is a reliable validation source since is based on farmer declaration. The self-declaration maps follow the subsidy control in the framework of the European Common Agriculture Policy (CAP).3 Controls are performed periodically to check the validity of the farmer's declarations by national or regional producer accuracy (PAs), responsible for the direct payments at a country level.4 These maps are considered reliable products and have been extensively used to generate training and validation dataset [25], [64], [65]. The 2019 and 2020 LPIS Austrian maps allow us to assess the generalization capability of the DL model from the temporal view point. Since the maps are used to generate the training set used for the learning of the multiyear LSTM models, we considered spatially uncorrelated portions of the study area to assess the results. This condition allows us to generate spatially uncorrelated training and test sets. 2) PROMET Model To evaluate the simulation results, the PROMET model outputs are aggregated in the temporal and spatial domains. The annual maps representative of the three agronomic years are generated through integration of the simulated hourly crop water demand values. Spatially, the sample points were averaged over nomenclature of territorial units for statistics (NUTS) 1 regions, since the visualization of all sample points is not meaningful. Nevertheless, the information is generated for all of the simulated fields. To validate the observed irrigation water demand and the underlying crop water stress, we considered an indirect approach, as no large-scale in situ measurements for crop water stress or crop water demand are available for the Danube basin. Hence, the validation efforts are based on the connection between precipitation and crop water stress. We used the Copernicus Climate Data Store,5 aggregated to subcountry level, for our comparisons. Although no direct validation can be performed in the considered study area, we would like to remark that the PROMET model was selected for the considered end-to-end workflow since it has been extensively employed in several scientific studies [13], [47], [48], [62], [66], [67], [68], [69]. In particular, the different components of the PROMET model have been validated in order to compare simulated soil moisture profiles with measurements using time domain reflectometer (TDR) soil probes, or simulated versus measured crop parameters in terms of leaf area, biomass, crop height, and phenology. Evapotranspiration estimations were validated with Eddy covariance stations, while crop yield estimations using farm data. Several studies using PROMET can be found for EO-based LAI retrieval and data assimilation in [13], [47], and [62], for yield simulations at field scale in [48], [66], and [67], for water balance components in [68] and [69]. C. Experimental Setup To be efficient on a large scale, the presented software architecture is based on the integration of the Food Security TEP and the data-intensive AI Hopsworks platform. While the former provides easy access to Sentinel-2 data and computational resources for processing the EO data, the latter is used to efficiently train the developed DL models in a distributed and transparent manner. By combining the strengths of each platform, the deployed end-to-end workflow ingests the Level 1c data acquired by the Sentinel-2 satellites and provides the final products computed at large scale for multiple years. 1) DL Model To successfully train the LSTM architecture on the considered study area, a large amount of high-quality informative training samples is required. As part of the ExtremeEarth project, we defined the TimeSen2Crop6 dataset [52], an open-source benchmark dataset consisting of more than one million crop type samples associated with 16 different classes. The TimeSen2Crop benchmark dataset models one agronomic year ranging from September 2017 and August 2018. The labeled samples have a minimum-distance requirement of 120 m (12 pixels) from each other, in order to reduce spatial correlation (please refer to [52] for more details on this training database). The architecture parameters were selected following a standard grid search approach, sampling the learning rate and the weight decay from log-uniform distributions, U log ([ 10 −2 , 10 −4 ]) and U log ([ 10 −2 , 10 −8 ]) , respectively. We considered different numbers of cascaded layers L∈{2,3,4} and hidden representation H∈{ 2 5 , 2 6 , 2 7 } . The architecture has been trained on the Hopsworks platform considering synchronous distributed training on two different GPUs. For fine tuning the DL model to generate the multiyear classification, we selected 1500 samples per crop type distributed throughout the entire Austria. The seven Sentinel-2 tiles acquired in Austria were divided into minipatches, to generate training and test sets having spatially uncorrelated samples. The number of samples per crop type was defined by comparing the performance of the network without fine tuning, with 150 samples per class, and considering 1500 samples per class. The architecture performance showed limited increment after the latter, leading us to the choice of this configuration to have a good tradeoff between number of samples and performance of the architecture [56]. The accuracies of the crop type maps are reported considering the standard metrics typically used to evaluate the classification results, i.e., user accuracy (UA)%, PA%, and overall accuracy (OA)%. While the UA% measures the number of pixels correctly classified in a specific crop type with respect to the total number of pixels classified as that crop type, the PA% measures the number of pixels correctly classified in a specific crop type with respect to the total number of pixels belonging to that crop type. The OA% provides an overall assessment of the model's performance considering the accuracy of all crop types collectively. In addition, the confidence intervals are reported for all the metrics, calculated as in [70]. 2) PROMET Model In order to monitor crop development and irrigation water demand, a sampling approach using millions of individual fields has been chosen (see Fig. 5). Using distributed pixels reduces the number of calculations without a significant loss of local and regional heterogeneity [71]. In particular, samples are selected using a regular grid, by combining the classification result and a dynamic selection based on geometry and a quality factor. Through the applied sampling, a representative distribution within the administrative units considered (NUTS levels) is ensured. The crop type classification is the basis for selecting sample points that are simulated with PROMET. Samples are located at a minimum distance from field boundaries or roads to guarantee pure crop-specific remotely sensed information. Finally, more than 4 million sample points have been selected randomly distributed over all classified crop type classes in the investigated Danube basin. They cover five countries. Fig. 5. Overview on the spatial setup of the PROMET simulations based on the crop type classification for the “winter wheat” crop type. Show All SECTION V. Experimental Results This section presents the experimental analysis carried out to assess the effectiveness of the proposed workflow. First, the spatial and temporal generalization capabilities of the DL model are assessed using the validation dataset. Then, the obtained irrigation water demand recommendations are presented at a aggregated level and crop level. A. DL Model: Spatial Generalization Capability To assess the spatial generalization capability of the DL model, we analyze the accuracy obtained in the entire study area. In particular, we compare the accuracy obtained in Austria (where the TimeSen2Crop training dataset is available) with the one obtained in the surrounding countries, i.e., Czech Republic, Germany, Hungary, Slovakia, and Slovenia. Due to the availability of the 2018 LUCAS in situ survey, the results reported focus on the first agronomic year (i.e., from September 2017 to August 2018). Table II shows the PA%, UA%, and OA% obtained in Austria (i.e., “Training Country”) and the rest of the study area (i.e., “Test Countries”). Please note that the results obtained per country are reported in Table V of the Appendix. The results show no noticeable drop in performance for any crop type when applying the model outside Austria, even though no samples were used to fine tune or train the network in any of the Sentinel-2 tiles belonging to the Test Countries. In particular, the OA% obtained in Austria is 89.10%, which is comparable with the one obtained in the Test Countries, i.e., 84.38%. By analyzing the accuracy obtained for the different crop types, as expected the ones having the lowest accuracy are the following: TABLE II UA%, PA%, and OA% Considering a 95% Confidence Interval Obtained on the 2018 LUCAS in situ Samples in Austria Where Training Data were Available (Training Country) and Outside Austria Where no Reference Data were Used (Test Countries) TABLE III Quantitative Results (for the 2018 Agronomic Year) in Terms of UA%, PA%, and OA% Considering a 95% Confidence Interval Obtained in Austria and Bavaria by the DL Model Trained Using the TimeSen2Crop Austrian Dataset TABLE IV Quantitative Results (for the 2018, 2019, and 2020 Agronomic Years), Considering a 95% Confidence Interval, in Terms of UA, PA, and OA Obtained by the Architectures (a) Trained on 2018 Without Adaptation on the 2019 and 2020, (b) Fine Tuned on the 2019, and (c) Fine Tuned on the 2020 TABLE V Quantitative Results (for the 2018 Agronomic Year) in Terms of UA%, PA%, and OA% Obtained by the Architecture on the LUCAS Samples (Danube Basin) minoritarian classes such as “triticale” and “rye” (which are often confused, since “triticale” is a hybrid cultivation of “wheat–rye”); mixed heterogeneous classes such as “Permanent Plantations.” However, both UA% and PA% are above 70% for most crop types, even though a detailed classification scheme is considered compared to those used in the literature that typically have less than ten classes [25], [72]. These results are confirmed by the ones available in Table III, which shows the classification accuracies obtained in 2018 considering the test set of the TimeSen2Crop dataset extracted from the Austrian crop type map based on the farmers' declarations (focusing on the Sentinel-2 tile “33UVP”) and the Bavarian farmers' declarations (i.e., Sentinel-2 tiles “33UNA,” “33UPA,” “33UQA,” “32UNV,” “32UPV,”, “32UQV,” “32UMU,” “32UNU,” “32UPU,” “32UQU,” and “33UUQ”). Similar to the results presented in Table II, the accuracy metrics are comparable for both countries. Indeed, the network achieved an OA% of 94.22% and 90.71% in Austria and Bavaria, respectively, and similar UA% and PA% in the classes present in the Bavaria region. Moreover, also in Bavaria, the “rye” class has the lowest accuracy because of its similarity with other winter cereals. A more detailed assessment can be performed in Austria due to the availability of all 15 crop types. Here, the most critical classes are “Winter Caraway” and “Permanent Plantations.” The former is mainly confused with the “winter wheat” because of their similar spectral-temporal behavior. The latter is difficult to represent adequately as it is both affected by a low number of training samples (i.e., minoritarian class) and is a mixed heterogeneous class. Please note that, due to the peculiarities of the presented large-scale analysis, the availability of samples per class for different crop types varies significantly in different countries [74], [75]. Despite in the Bavaria scene only a subset of the considered classes are present in the area analyzed (“grassland,” “corn,” “spring cereals,” “rapeseed,” “potato,” “rye,” “sugarbeet,” “barley,” and “winter wheat”), the results obtained are extremely valuable since they show the generalization capacity of the network, which achieves very similar accuracy regardless of the use of training samples belonging to the Austrian country alone. B. DL Model: Temporal Generalization Capability To assess the temporal generalization capability of the DL model, we evaluate the accuracy of the multiyear crop type maps generated in Austria by comparing the results obtained with 2018, 2019, and 2020 farmer's based declaration LIPS maps. Differently from Table III, the results obtained are not evaluated only in tile “33UVP” but in the whole Austrian country. However, also in this case, the validation set considered is statistical independent with respect to the training data. The multiyear classification accuracies are shown in Table IV, which compares the numerical results obtained with the fine-tuning strategy (15 000 samples for the 2019 and 2020 agronomic years) with the results obtained by using the initial DL model without any adaptation. Moreover, a comparison between the fine-tuned networks and the networks without adaptation is reported. One can observe that the fine-tuned OA% show an improvement of 7% and 5% when compared to the OA% score of the network without adaptation, for 2019 and 2020, respectively. These results demonstrate that the proposed system can be easily adapted and applied to multiyear time series for long-term monitoring analysis. Indeed, the obtained accuracies are stable in the following two agronomic years, with a small decrease in terms of performance when considering the 2020. In particular, the network achieves an OA% of 88.75% in 2018, which is comparable with 86.85% and 83.94% obtained in 2019 and 2020, respectively. The PA% and UA% values confirm these results, showing similar accuracies with the reference agronomic year. By analyzing the accuracies of different types of crops in detail, one can see that the DL model achieves stable results over time even for the most critical classes such as “triticale” and “rye” crop types. In contrast, if no fine-tuning strategy is considered, the crop type mapping accuracies decrease when the target year is far from the reference year used initially to train the architecture from scratch. Fig. 6 shows a qualitative example of crop type map obtained over the same area in the three agronomic years, i.e., 2018, 2019, and 2020. In particular, a true color representation is reported together with the multiyear maps to visually inspect the crop changes visible in the satellite data. This qualitative analysis confirms the quantitative assessment. Fig. 6. Qualitative example of multiyear crop type mapping results obtained. (a) Aerial images of the patch analyzed from Environmental Systems Research Institute (ESRI) world imagery [73]. (b) 2018 crop type maps. (c) 2019 crop type maps. (d) 2020 crop type maps. Show All C. PROMET Model: Crop Level Results Fig. 7 shows an example of simulated crop water demand estimated in 2018 and 2019 for the same crop parcels. From these qualitative results, one can notice the importance of considering a crop growth model tailored to the specific properties of different crop types. Because of the different weather patterns of 2018 and 2019, different amounts of precipitation occurred at different times of the year. The impact of such dryness was not uniform across all crops, as different crop types reacted differently to the varying weather conditions. In 2018, the dryness primarily affected “soy,” causing significant challenges for their growth and yield [76]. In 2019, both “soy” and “corn” were affected, although the severity of the dry conditions on “corn” was identified as relatively milder compared to “soy.” In both years, the winter crops, i.e., “winter barley” and “winter wheat,” which have their main growing phase in spring, demonstrated a higher resilience to the dryness and were able to manage their water requirements more efficiently during their crucial growth stages. Fig. 7. Simulated irrigation water demand estimated for the same parcels in: (a) 2018 and (b) 2019. Show All Fig. 8 shows the obtained spatial irrigation recommendation generated by the PROMET model for a specific parcel. The presented example, which reports the water demand computed for week 29, highlights the spatial sensitivity of the model. Because of the model's ability to take into account all the relevant factors that can impact irrigation (e.g., soil moisture levels, weather conditions, crop requirements, and agricultural management options like fertilization), it is possible to generate targeted recommendations at a very high spatial resolution. Within the crop, the model is able to simulate all relevant energy and mass fluxes on a physical basis at the pixel level (i.e., 10-m spatial resolution), thus leading to extremely precise crop water demand recommendations. For this reason, the PROMET model has been extensively employed in the last 30 years for smart farming services. Although this qualitative example demonstrates the capability of the PROMET model to optimize water usage and enhance crop yield at high spatial resolution, the proposed end-to-end workflow is the first attempt to perform such analysis at large scale. This is mainly due to the efficient and effective production of crop-type maps for the entire study area, which was made possible by the workflow. Fig. 8. Example of spatial irrigation recommendation as provided operationally to farmers using the data assimilation concept using the PROMET model and leaf area time series as retrieved from Sentinel-2. Show All D. PROMET Model: Aggregated Results To demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed end-to-end workflow, crop water stress and irrigation water demand were calculated using the PROMET model for the study site for the most prevalent crop types in the years between 2018 and 2020. Indeed, to the best of the author's knowledge, no in situ data on water demand are available that cover the entirety of Austria and the area analyzed during the three selected agronomic years, making a quantitative large-scale validation not possible. However, this indirect validation performed by aggregating the results over the whole crop season and analyzing the regional differences provides a comprehensive overview at a higher level of abstraction. Fig. 9(a) shows the irrigation crop water demand for the whole season for winter wheat for the years 2018–2020. Winter wheat is harvested in July or early August. In general, wheat does not require irrigation as can be seen in the simulations with the blue colouring. This fits with farming practice in this region. Only in the drought year 2018, some regions turn colour to red, which means that using irrigation could have increased the yield. On the contrary, as shown in Fig. 9(b), it is immediately visible that “corn” summer crop is more strongly affected by water stress and has a much higher irrigation water demand over the season. This difference is visible both in the total water demand and in the affected regions over the different years. In 2020, the total irrigation water demand was lower than in the other two years. This can be explained when looking at the precipitation variance against the 20 year mean as seen in Fig. 10. In 2020, there is overall less deviation from the mean, and especially in the third quarter of the year, (which is the summer months) more water was available than in 2018 and 2019. Nevertheless, for “corn,” there was still water stress and irrigation water demand even in 2020. Fig. 9. Simulated irrigation water demand for the 3 considered years for: (a) “wheat,” and (b) “corn.” The results obtained are presented aggregated on NUTS 1 level and vegetation period/year. Show All Fig. 10. Deviation of the precipitation water availability against long year statistics for the three considered years. Show All Fig. 11 shows exemplary daily modeling results for the “corn” crop type in terms of crop water stress (where 1 means no stress and lower values indicate higher water stress levels) and crop water demand (in millimeter) for two Austrian regions. For comparison, the precipitation used as modeling input is also shown in the plots. Early “corn” growth stages were not affected by water stress, but from late July through all of August, crop water demand was almost consistently higher than the available water supply, leading to water stress. In Styria, some heavier rainfalls could reduce the water stress, but they did not manage to fill the whole water demand. In order to avoid water stress for each field under investigation, the irrigation demand is simulated and displayed in the green line in Fig. 11. Fig. 11. Simulated crop water stress and irrigation crop water demand for “corn” for two regions in Austria in 2018. Show All SECTION VI. Discussion The objective of this article is to present a successful end-to-end workflow for the production of irrigation water demand in an operational scenario by integrating processing capabilities of the TEPs, which provides access to the Sentinel-2 data and computational resources for data processing, and the parallel computing architectures of the Hopsworks platform. By interconnecting the two infrastructures, the proposed automatic end-to-end workflow is able to process large volumes of Sentinel-2 images and provides water irrigation recommendations at crop level. This can be useful to both single farmers and stakeholders. By exploiting the Food Security TEP, the different models can be retrieved from the Hopsworks and used for the inference in a fast and effective way. This agile method allows the definition and the training of different models on the Hopsworks without the need of changing the pipeline implemented on the thematic platform. Moreover, since the TEPs allow the retrieval of different sources of data and datasets, it is possible to implement the data processing in the pipeline. One example can be found in the masking procedure of nonagricultural areas, which has to be performed before running the crop type classification. In this case, we employed the HRL map to mask the noncrop pixels. However, any other high-resolution land cover map available can be used to focus only on cultivated areas [77], [78]. The LSTM DL model achieve accurate classification results from both the spatial and temporal view point. Indeed, the LSTM for 2018 obtained an OA of 85.39% and 85.20% on the LUCAS validation dataset and the farmer's declaration map, respectively. These accuracies demonstrate that the network has good spatial generalization capability, achieving similar accuracy over the entire study area despite having been trained only on the Austrian territory. Similar results are obtained for the new target years 2019 and 2020 having an OA of 81.29% and 78.79%, respectively, considering only 15 000 training samples per year. Although the amount of labeled data used to train the network in later years is much smaller than that used to train it in 2018, the qualities of the maps obtained are visually comparable. From the qualitative example reported in Fig. 6, one can notice that the three crop type maps correctly distinguish the boundaries of the different cultivated fields. Indeed, even though the network performs a pixel-level classification, the shape of the fields is clearly visible in the scene for all years. The results obtained confirm the effectiveness of the architecture even under conditions of multiyear maps production. Also, they accurately show the changes that have occurred on the land in different agronomic years due to crop rotation practices. Finally, we would like to emphasize that the proposed DL model can work anywhere, as long as a sufficient number of reference samples are available for training or fine tuning the DL model. It is worth noting that many efforts are currently being made to generate publicly available mapping datasets of crop types to support agricultural monitoring [72], [79]. In addition, several EU Member States are publishing agricultural information based on farmers' declarations (collected for the monitoring of European subsidies) for research purposes. Therefore, it is possible to conclude that the crop type mapping component of the proposed end-to-end workflow can be used to perform the continuous production of accurate crop type maps. This enables precise agricultural analysis at the crop level instead of considering basic approaches based on simple spectral indices computed for the whole study area. The water demand assessment allowed us to infer important information about the crops under investigation. In particular, we detected a crop demand that exceeded consistently the available water supply for “corn,” leading to water stress. Examining the aggregated results over the entire crop season also allowed for an analysis of regional differences. In particular, certain crops such as “winter wheat” typically do not require irrigation, which is allineated to the farming practices in the region, but we detected a drought year in 2018 where several regions displayed red coloring, suggesting that irrigation could have increased yields. “Corn” summer crops, instead, are significantly affected by water stress [80] and require a much higher irrigation water demand throughout the season. The variance in precipitation compared to the 20-year mean also provides an explanation for the observed differences. The results demonstrate the importance of assessing crop-specific water requirements and irrigation needs based on regional and yearly variations in water availability. Understanding such dynamics can inform farmers and policymakers in implementing effective irrigation strategies and water management practices to mitigate crop water stress and optimize water use efficiency. Overall, the study conducted emphasizes the need of continuously monitoring and assessment of crop water stress and irrigation water demand to ensure sustainable agricultural practices in the face of changing climatic conditions and water availability. Furthermore, the method suggested for choosing and combining sample points, specifically within administrative areas, involves integrating detailed data at the field level with the summarized findings at the NUTS 1 level. This approach caters to the specific requirements of individual farmers by providing operational services tailored to their needs, while also presents broader information to governmental bodies and other relevant parties. Consequently, the results can be adjusted to meet the distinct expectations of different user groups. SECTION VII. Conclusion In this article, we have presented a system for the production of multiyear water availability maps by assessment of the irrigation water demand at the crop level. We exploited time series of Sentinel-2 data for agricultural areas at 10 m of spatial resolution for wide-scale irrigation support. The end-to-end workflow was developed by integrating the Food Security TEP, which provides access to the Sentinel-2 data and computational resources for data processing, and the data-intensive AI Hopsworks platform, designed for training distributed DL models. First, the data are atmospherically corrected and preprocessed in the TEP to generate the atmospherically corrected time series of Sentinel-2 and the time series of spatially and temporally harmonized 12-month composites. Then, a scalable distributed LSTM DL model is trained on the Hopsworks platform from scratch for the first year of observation, while being fine tuned for the subsequent years. The trained models are used in the Food Security TEP to generate multiyear crop type maps, which are combined together with the meteorological data and the atmospherically corrected time series of Sentinel-2 images to assess the irrigation water demand for millions of agricultural fields by the PROMET agrohydrological model. The experimental results obtained in the upper part of the Danube Catchment for the 2018, 2019, and 2020 demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed system. The results obtained for crop water stress and irrigation water demand demonstrate the model's ability to identify at which growth stages the water demand exceeds water supply. In particular, the multiyear results obtained pointed out the capability of the proposed system to capture the different levels of water stress and irrigation water demand for different crops, under different weather conditions and for different seasons. As future developments, we plan to test the proposed system architecture for multiple target years (i.e., for a 10-year window), in order to assess its robustness from the temporal view point. Moreover, we would like to test it on different countries to further evaluate its generalization capability from the spatial view point. Finally, we would like to explore the possibility of generating in-season (i.e., before the end of the year) crop type maps to be combined with short- and mid-season weather forecasts to generate predictive analyses of water stress. These early water demand forecasts can be extremely useful in providing irrigation policy advice at the local and regional levels. ACKNOWLEDGMENT The authors would like to thank Dr. W. Angermair for granting permission to publish the results obtained from his fields. Appendix Proposed System: Processing Architecture The entire pipeline has been implemented on cloud computing platforms to exploit their distributed processing power and eliminate the need of downloading/uploading large amounts of data. Moreover, the use of such platforms allows for easy access to the entire processing pipeline by the service providers and final users, thus guaranteeing effective exploitation of the developed methods and generated products. According to the properties of the considered platforms, the Food Security TEP7 was used to implement the complete pipeline starting with the pre-processing of the Level 1c Sentinel-2 data and ending with the production of the irrigation water demand maps, whereas Hopsworks8 was used to specifically perform the training of the distributed DL model taking the TimeSen2Crop database as input. This condition allows us to minimize the amount of data volume transferred from one platform to the other. Indeed, to train the DL model on the Hopsworks platform, only the TimeSen2crop database has to be uploaded, without the need of transferring the whole time series of Sentinel-2 images. The obtained LSTM models can be downloaded to the TEP directly using the Hopsworks API,9 so that the inference procedure (i.e., production of crop type maps) can be carried out where the satellite data are available. SECTION A. Food Security TEP Implementation The Food Security TEP is an online platform that provides access to EO and non-EO data and the services to process them. The basic principle is to bring algorithms to the data. All the Level 1c Sentinel-2 datasets are available on the Food Security TEP via the Copernicus services within the Data and Information Access Services concept10 on the Creodias.11 The Food Security TEP, operated by VISTA, holds data access mechanisms, tools for data processing and data analytics, and all solutions for scientists and service providers to process, analyze, and share data. On the Food Security TEP, the different services components are available as processors based on docker containers associated with bash files that automatically execute the python scripts related to each particular service. Services (or processors) can be used and combined by users, according to their account level and access rights. In the considered pipeline, the steps implemented in the TEP are as follows: the preprocessing of the Sentinel-2 data to generate the bottom-of-atmosphere images; the preparation of the time series of 12 monthly composites per year according (see Section III-A); the production of the multiyear crop type maps; the crop type maps postprocessing based on morphological operators (see Section III-C). The final crop type maps and mechanisms are stored inside a collection in the Food Security TEP, and therefore, available to other users. Fig. 12 Fig. 12. GUI of the Food Security TEP showing the service for monthly composite generation. Show All presents an example of the graphical user interface (GUI) of the Food Security TEP with the left part of the screen showing the service selection and setting and the right part the map over which the results are displayed. Hopsworks is used for the distributed training of the model. It is a data-intensive platform for AI that is horizontally scalable and enables the development of end-to-end machine learning and DL pipelines. It provides the software development kit for a wide variety of operations including the following. Machine learning feature management with a Feature Store. Horizontally scalable distributed training on multiple machines with both CPUs and GPUs. Model serving using Kubernetes for the deployment of the model in a container environment with Hopsworks managing secure authentication and authorization access to the model. Model management and monitoring to manage model and experiment metadata as well as analyze the model usage in near real time. To perform the distributed training, first the TimeSen2Crop database stored on the Hopsworks file system (HopsFS) is moved to the local machine using the Hopsworks API, and then, the temporal harmonization (see Section III-A) is applied to all the samples. Then, the distributed training of the LSTM is performed according to a multiworker mirrored strategy. In such a way, the training is performed synchronously on multiple workers, each with one GPU, by replicating the variables and computations on each device. Note that the distributed strategy can easily be scaled to run on many GPUs. From the user perspective, few modifications are required that are mostly related to enable the distributed training in the code and to define the settings of the distributed environment in the Hopsworks interface. Finally, the model is saved in HopsFS so that it can be retrieved by the Food Security TEP for the inference. SECTION B. Extra Experimental Results Table V reports the accuracies on the LUCAS dataset per country analyzed. Please note that some countries lack samples for all the considered classes. For both this reason and the small number of validation samples present in some countries, the confidence intervals were not calculated per class but were only considered in the OA% analysis.

A systematic review of automated systems for real-time irrigation management

1. INTRODUCTION
The challenge of feeding a growing population with finite resources is becoming increasingly pressing. By 2050, the world population is expected to reach 9.7 billion, necessitating a 70% increase in food production (Falkenmark and Rockstrom, 2009). Irrigation plays a crucial role in enhancing crop yields and agricultural productivity to meet this growing demand. Studies have shown that irrigation can significantly increase crop water productivity, contributing to increased food production (Ali and Talukder, 2008; Playan and Mateos, 2005). However, water scarcity poses a significant challenge, with many regions facing water deficits and the need for improved water management practices (Falkenmark and Rockstrom, 2009). Optimizing irrigation schedules and doses based on crop requirements and environmental conditions is essential for maximizing yield and quality while minimizing water use (Zhang et al., 2024). The necessity of scalable water-efficient practices for increasing food demand cannot be overstated. Techniques such as regulated deficit irrigation, magnetically treated water, and the use of drought-tolerant crops like sorghum have shown promise in improving water productivity and ensuring food security (Mehmood et al., 2023; Putti et al., 2023; Hadebe et al., 2016). As the global food challenge intensifies, it is imperative to critically evaluate the current state and future potential of irrigation management systems to guide research, innovation, and implementation efforts towards fully autonomous, scalable solutions.

Despite the importance of irrigation in addressing the global food challenge, traditional irrigation management techniques, such as manual scheduling and timer-based systems, have significant limitations. These methods are often labor-intensive, inefficient, and less adaptable to changing conditions (Savin et al., 2023). Manual and timer-based scheduling can lead to high operational costs and inefficient water use (Raghavendra, Han, and Shin, 2023). The reliance on manual intervention and predetermined schedules limits their adaptability to changing environmental conditions, crop water requirements, and soil moisture levels (Kaptein et al., 2019). Sensor-based irrigation systems offer an alternative, enabling real-time adjustments based on soil water status measurements (Kaptein et al., 2019). However, the adoption of these systems in commercial settings has been limited, often requiring extensive input from researchers (Kim et al., 2014; Lea-Cox et al., 2018; Ristvey et al., 2018). The limitations of traditional irrigation management techniques highlight the need for scalable, automated solutions for greater efficiency in irrigation management. Automated systems that collect real-time data, analyze it, and make autonomous irrigation decisions can lead to improved water use efficiency and increased crop productivity (Champness et al., 2023; Wu et al., 2022). To fully understand the potential of automated systems, it is necessary to examine the automation of each part of the irrigation management pipeline and analyze the effectiveness and efficiency of integrated end-to-end solutions.

The emergence of smart irrigation management and IoT marks a significant shift from historical irrigation practices. Modern approaches rely on vast data and analysis algorithms, leveraging technologies such as remote sensing, sensor networks, weather data, and computational algorithms (Atanasov, 2023; Bellvert et al., 2023; Kumar et al., 2023). IoT plays a vital role in collecting vast amounts of data through sensors, data transmission, and tailored networks, enabling real-time monitoring and control of irrigation systems (Liakos, 2023; Zuckerman et al., 2024). These advancements in data collection and analysis have the potential to revolutionize irrigation management, allowing for more precise and efficient water use. However, challenges such as processing diverse data sources, data integration, and lack of integrated data analysis hamper the full benefit of IoT in irrigation management (Dave et al., 2023). The current fragmented approach in smart irrigation, focusing on individual components rather than the entire system, limits the potential for fully autonomous, real-time end-to-end irrigation management (Togneri et al., 2021). To address these challenges and fully realize the potential of smart irrigation management, there is a need for automating and integrating each section of the irrigation management pipeline, from sensor/weather data collection and transmission to processing, analysis, decision-making, and automated action (McKinion and Lemmon, 1985). This integration requires a thorough investigation of the role of interoperability and standardization in enabling seamless communication and compatibility between components within the automated irrigation management pipeline.

Machine learning (ML) plays a significant role in processing vast data, predicting plant stress, modeling climate effects, and optimizing irrigation in smart irrigation management systems. ML algorithms can analyze data collected from sensors and weather stations to determine optimal irrigation schedules (Vianny et al., 2022). However, the potential of ML is often constrained by manual steps, such as data interpretation, decision-making on irrigation timing and volume, and system adjustments. Automating ML integration to allow direct action from insights to irrigation execution, removing bottlenecks and achieving real-time adaptability, is crucial for fully autonomous irrigation management (Barzallo-Bertot et al., 2022). By integrating ML into automated systems, the irrigation management pipeline can become more seamless and efficient, enabling real-time decision-making and action based on data-driven insights. To achieve this level of automation and integration, it is essential to identify gaps and propose solutions for seamless integration across the automated irrigation management system, aiming to achieve fully autonomous, scalable irrigation management.

To achieve seamless integration across the automated irrigation management system, interoperability and standardization are critical. Interoperability allows different system components, such as sensors, actuators, and software, to communicate and exchange data effectively, while standardization ensures that data is represented in a consistent format (Santos et al., 2020). Standardized protocols and data formats are essential for achieving seamless integration and ensuring compatibility between components in real-time irrigation management systems (Robles et al., 2022; Hatzivasilis et al., 2018). Existing and emerging standards, such as OGC SensorThings API and ISO 11783, have applicability to real-time irrigation management systems (Hazra et al., 2021). However, challenges such as data quality, scalability, reliability, and security need to be addressed to fully realize the potential of interoperability and standardization in automated irrigation management systems (Hazra et al., 2021). Addressing these challenges is crucial for enabling the seamless integration of components within the automated irrigation management pipeline, which is essential for achieving fully autonomous, scalable irrigation management. A comprehensive evaluation of the role of interoperability and standardization in enabling the integration of components within the automated irrigation management pipeline is necessary to guide future research and implementation efforts.
The primary objective of this systematic review is to critically evaluate the current state and future potential of real-time, end-to-end automated irrigation management systems that integrate IoT and machine learning technologies for enhancing agricultural water use efficiency and crop productivity.
Specific objectives include:
•	Examining the automation of each part of the irrigation management pipeline and the seamless integration of each section in the context of irrigation scheduling and management.

By addressing these objectives, this systematic review aims to provide a comprehensive and critical evaluation of the current state and future potential of real-time, end-to-end automated irrigation management systems. Its intention is to guide future research, innovation, and implementation efforts to achieve fully autonomous, scalable irrigation management that can contribute to addressing the global food challenge.

3. DATA COLLECTION TO CLOUD: AUTOMATION AND REAL-TIME PROCESSING
3.1. Irrigation management data
The success of automated irrigation management systems relies heavily on the collection, transmission, and analysis of various types of data. The most applicable data types for irrigation management include soil moisture, canopy temperature, weather data, and plant physiological parameters (Farooq et al., 2019; Li et al., 2019; Olivier et al., 2021; Evett et al., 2020). These data are typically collected from a range of sources, including in-field sensors, remote sensing platforms, weather stations, and manual measurements (Li et al., 2019; Karimi et al., 2018).
Soil moisture data is arguably the most critical type of data for irrigation management, as it directly reflects the water available to plants and can be used to determine the optimal timing and amount of irrigation (Olivier et al., 2021; Intrigliolo & Castel, 2006). Soil moisture sensors, such as tensiometers, capacitance probes, and time-domain reflectometry (TDR) sensors, can provide real-time measurements of soil water content at various depths (Farooq et al., 2019). These sensors can be deployed in a network configuration to capture spatial variability in soil moisture across a field (Karimi et al., 2018).
Canopy temperature data is another valuable type of data for irrigation management, as it can be used to assess plant water stress and adjust irrigation accordingly (Evett et al., 2020). Infrared thermometers and thermal cameras can be used to measure canopy temperature, which is influenced by factors such as air temperature, humidity, wind speed, and plant water status (Li et al., 2019). When plants experience water stress, they tend to close their stomata to reduce water loss, leading to an increase in canopy temperature (Evett et al., 2020). By monitoring canopy temperature and comparing it to reference values, automated irrigation systems can detect plant water stress and trigger irrigation events to maintain optimal plant health and productivity (Li et al., 2019).
Weather data, including temperature, humidity, precipitation, wind speed, and solar radiation, are essential for predicting crop water requirements and scheduling irrigation events (Akilan & Baalamurugan, 2024). Weather stations equipped with various sensors can provide real-time measurements of these parameters, which can be used as inputs for crop water requirement models, such as the FAO-56 Penman-Monteith equation (Li et al., 2019). These models estimate crop evapotranspiration (ET) based on weather data and crop-specific coefficients, allowing for the calculation of irrigation requirements (Intrigliolo & Castel, 2006). By integrating weather data into automated irrigation systems, irrigation schedules can be dynamically adjusted based on changing environmental conditions, ensuring that crops receive the optimal amount of water at the right time (Akilan & Baalamurugan, 2024).
When collecting and utilizing these data types, several considerations must be taken into account, including the volume, frequency, format, and source of the data (Farooq et al., 2019). The volume of data generated by automated irrigation systems can be substantial, especially when high-resolution sensors are deployed at a large scale (Bastidas Pacheco et al., 2022). This necessitates the use of efficient data storage, processing, and transmission technologies to handle the data load (Farooq et al., 2019). The frequency of data collection is another important consideration, as it directly impacts the temporal resolution of the data and the ability to detect rapid changes in plant water status or environmental conditions (Bastidas Pacheco et al., 2022). Bastidas Pacheco et al. (2022) demonstrated that collecting full pulse resolution data from water meters provides more accurate estimates of event occurrence, timing, and features compared to aggregated temporal resolutions, highlighting the importance of selecting appropriate data collection frequencies to ensure the quality and usefulness of the data for irrigation management.
The format of the data is also crucial, as it determines the compatibility and interoperability of the data with various analysis tools and platforms (Farooq et al., 2019). Standardized data formats, such as JSON, XML, or CSV, can facilitate data exchange and integration between different components of the automated irrigation system (Zhang et al., 2023). The source of the data is another important consideration, as it can impact the reliability, accuracy, and spatial coverage of the data (Farooq et al., 2019). For example, in-field sensors provide highly localized measurements, while remote sensing platforms, such as satellites or drones, can provide data at larger spatial scales (Li et al., 2019). By combining data from multiple sources, automated irrigation systems can achieve a more comprehensive understanding of crop water requirements and optimize irrigation management accordingly (Farooq et al., 2019).
Data quality, accuracy, and reliability are paramount in irrigation management, as they directly impact the effectiveness of decision-making processes and the efficiency of water use (Gupta et al., 2020). Inaccurate or unreliable data can lead to suboptimal irrigation decisions, resulting in crop stress, yield losses, or wasted water resources (Ramli & Jabbar, 2022). Gupta et al. (2020) emphasized the critical importance of data security and privacy in smart farming systems, as the leakage of sensitive agricultural data can cause severe economic losses to farmers and compromise the integrity of the automated irrigation system. The authors also highlighted the need for robust authentication and secure communication protocols to prevent unauthorized access to smart farming systems and protect data in transit (Gupta et al., 2020).
Ramli and Jabbar (2022) addressed the challenges associated with implementing real-time, automated irrigation systems, including data quality, scalability, reliability, and security. They proposed solutions and best practices based on the analysis of case studies and real-world implementations, such as the use of redundant sensors, data validation techniques, and secure communication protocols (Ramli & Jabbar, 2022). The authors also emphasized the importance of regular maintenance and calibration of sensors to ensure the accuracy and reliability of the collected data (Ramli & Jabbar, 2022).
Researchers have investigated the use of data compression, aggregation, and filtering techniques to reduce bandwidth requirements and improve transmission efficiency in automated irrigation systems (Karim et al., 2023; Rady et al., 2020; Cui, 2023). Karim et al. (2023) explored the effectiveness of various data compression techniques, such as lossless and lossy compression algorithms, in reducing the size of data packets transmitted over wireless networks. The authors found that lossless compression techniques, such as Huffman coding and Lempel-Ziv-Welch (LZW), can significantly reduce data size without compromising data quality, while lossy compression techniques, such as JPEG and MP3, can further reduce data size by introducing acceptable levels of distortion (Karim et al., 2023).
Rady et al. (2020) developed a novel data compression algorithm specifically designed for irrigation data, which achieved significant compression ratios without compromising data quality. The authors demonstrated that their algorithm could reduce the amount of data transmitted over wireless networks, thereby improving the efficiency of the irrigation system and reducing costs (Rady et al., 2020). Cui (2023) investigated the use of data aggregation and filtering techniques to reduce the number of transmissions and save bandwidth in automated irrigation systems. The author proposed a data aggregation scheme that combines multiple sensor readings into a single value, such as the average soil moisture over a specified time interval, to reduce the frequency of data transmissions (Cui, 2023). Additionally, the author explored the use of data filtering techniques, such as Kalman filters and particle filters, to remove noise and outliers from sensor data, improving the accuracy and reliability of the transmitted information (Cui, 2023).
Data standardization and harmonization are crucial for facilitating seamless integration and interoperability between the various components of automated irrigation management systems (Zhang et al., 2023; Ermoliev et al., 2022). Zhang et al. (2023) developed a novel cyberinformatics technology called iCrop, which enables the in-season monitoring of crop-specific land cover across the contiguous United States. The authors highlighted the importance of data standardization and harmonization in the context of iCrop, as it allows for the efficient distribution of crop-specific land cover information based on the findable, accessible, interoperable, and reusable (FAIR) data principle (Zhang et al., 2023). By adopting standardized data formats and protocols, such as the Open Geospatial Consortium (OGC) standards, iCrop enables the seamless integration of various data sources and facilitates the interoperability of the system with other agricultural decision support tools (Zhang et al., 2023).
Ermoliev et al. (2022) proposed a linkage methodology for linking distributed sectoral/regional optimization models in a situation where private information is not available or cannot be shared by modeling teams. The authors emphasized the need for data standardization to enable decentralized cross-sectoral coordination and analysis, as it allows for the consistent representation and exchange of data between different models and stakeholders (Ermoliev et al., 2022). By adopting standardized data formats and interfaces, the proposed linkage methodology can facilitate the integration of various optimization models and support the development of comprehensive decision support systems for sustainable resource management (Ermoliev et al., 2022).
Metadata plays a vital role in providing context and enabling better data interpretation and decision-making in automated irrigation management systems (Jahanddideh-Tehrani et al., 2021). Metadata refers to the additional information that describes the characteristics, quality, and context of the primary data, such as the sensor type, calibration parameters, measurement units, and timestamp (Jahanddideh-Tehrani et al., 2021). Jahanddideh-Tehrani et al. (2021) highlighted the importance of metadata in water resources management, as it enables decision-makers to use the data to the best of its capabilities by understanding factors such as when water data was collected and what factors might have contributed to the measurements. The authors emphasized the need for standardized metadata formats and guidelines, such as the Dublin Core Metadata Initiative (DCMI) and the ISO 19115 standard, to ensure the consistency and interoperability of metadata across different water information systems (Jahanddideh-Tehrani et al., 2021).
In the context of automated irrigation management systems, metadata can provide valuable information about the data collection process, sensor performance, and environmental conditions that can aid in data interpretation and decision-making (Cota & Mamede, 2023). For example, metadata about the sensor type and calibration parameters can help assess the accuracy and reliability of the collected data, while metadata about the weather conditions and soil properties can provide context for interpreting the data and adjusting irrigation strategies accordingly (Cota & Mamede, 2023). By incorporating metadata into the data management and analysis pipeline of automated irrigation systems, decision-makers can make more informed and context-aware decisions, leading to improved water use efficiency and crop productivity (Jahanddideh-Tehrani et al., 2021).

3.2. Edge Computing and Fog Computing
Edge computing and fog computing have emerged as transformative technologies in the realm of real-time irrigation management systems, offering significant potential for improving efficiency, scalability, and reliability (Abdel Nasser et al., 2020; Tran et al., 2019). Edge computing refers to the practice of processing data near the edge of the network, close to the source of the data, while fog computing is a decentralized computing infrastructure that extends cloud computing capabilities to the network edge (Hassija et al., 2019). These technologies bring computation and analytics closer to the data source, reducing the need for data to travel to the cloud and enabling faster processing and decision-making (Hassija et al., 2019; Zhang et al., 2020).
The potential of edge computing and fog computing in real-time irrigation management is immense. Abdel Nasser et al. (2020) proposed a two-layer system for water demand prediction using automated meters and machine learning techniques, demonstrating the potential of edge computing in improving the efficiency and scalability of irrigation management. The system collects and aggregates data from distributed smart meters in the first layer, while the second layer uses LSTM neural networks to predict water demand for different regions of households. By leveraging edge computing, the system can achieve high accuracy in predicting water demand, which is essential for efficient irrigation management (Abdel Nasser et al., 2020).
Tran et al. (2019) conducted a comprehensive review of real-time, end-to-end automated irrigation management systems, highlighting the role of fog computing in addressing data transmission challenges and enabling seamless integration across the irrigation management pipeline. The authors emphasize that real-time, end-to-end automated irrigation management systems have the potential to significantly improve water efficiency, crop yields, and reduce labor costs. However, they also identify several challenges that need to be addressed, such as data quality, scalability, reliability, and security, which can be effectively tackled by implementing fog computing architectures (Tran et al., 2019).
Edge computing offers several benefits in real-time irrigation management systems, including reduced latency, real-time decision-making, and reduced reliance on cloud connectivity (Mishra, 2020; Zhang et al., 2020). By processing data closer to the source, edge computing enables faster response times and more efficient data handling (Mishra, 2020). Mishra (2020) highlights that edge computing reduces latency by processing data closer to the source, enabling real-time decision-making and lessening reliance on cloud connectivity by shifting processing to local or edge devices.
Zhang et al. (2020) explore the application of edge computing in agricultural settings, demonstrating its potential to improve the efficiency and accuracy of irrigation systems. The authors discuss how edge computing has prospects in various agricultural applications, such as pest identification, safety traceability of agricultural products, unmanned agricultural machinery, agricultural technology promotion, and intelligent management. They also emphasize that the emergence of edge computing models, such as fog computing, cloudlet, and mobile edge computing, has transformed the management and operation of farms (Zhang et al., 2020).
Fog computing plays a crucial role in distributing processing and storage across the network, enhancing the scalability and reliability of automated irrigation systems (Premkumar & Sigappi, 2022; Singh et al., 2022). Premkumar and Sigappi (2022) evaluate the current state of automated irrigation management systems and propose a hybrid machine learning approach for predicting soil moisture and managing irrigation. Their study emphasizes the potential of fog computing in distributing processing and storage across the network, improving the efficiency and scalability of irrigation systems. The proposed hybrid machine learning approach outperforms other machine learning algorithms in predicting soil moisture, demonstrating the effectiveness of fog computing in enhancing the performance of automated irrigation systems (Premkumar & Sigappi, 2022).
Singh et al. (2022) discuss the role of fog computing in distributing processing and storage across the network, enhancing scalability and reliability in agricultural management systems. The authors argue that by implementing fog computing, these systems can achieve faster data processing and response times, improving overall efficiency and effectiveness. They also highlight that fog computing can address the challenges faced by real-time data transmission in agricultural management systems, such as latency, bandwidth limitations, and data security (Singh et al., 2022).
The integration of edge and fog computing in real-time irrigation management systems is crucial for achieving fully automated, scalable, and reliable solutions. As the demand for autonomous irrigation management grows, these technologies will play a pivotal role in enabling faster decision-making, reduced latency, improved resource utilization, and seamless integration across the irrigation management pipeline (Tran et al., 2019; Zhang et al., 2020). By bringing computation and analytics closer to the data source and distributing processing and storage across the network, edge and fog computing can significantly enhance the efficiency and effectiveness of automated irrigation systems, contributing to the overall goal of addressing the global food challenge through optimized water resource management and increased agricultural productivity (Abdel Nasser et al., 2020; Premkumar & Sigappi, 2022; Singh et al., 2022).

3.3. Automation of Data Collection
The automation of data collection is a critical component in the development of real-time, end-to-end automated irrigation management systems that integrate IoT and machine learning technologies. It enables the efficient gathering of vital information about crop health, environmental conditions, and water requirements, which is essential for enhancing agricultural water use efficiency and crop productivity. Two key aspects of automated data collection are the use of advanced sensing technologies for non-invasive plant stress detection and the implementation of wireless sensor networks and energy-efficient communication protocols for large-scale, long-term data collection.
Advanced sensing technologies, such as hyperspectral imaging and thermal sensing, have emerged as powerful tools for non-invasive plant stress detection in automated irrigation management systems. These technologies provide valuable information about crop traits, enabling early and accurate detection of plant health issues (Triantafyllou et al., 2019). Triantafyllou et al. (2019) propose a comprehensive reference architecture model that incorporates advanced sensing technologies in the sensor layer for real-time plant stress detection, highlighting their importance in providing non-invasive plant stress detection. Similarly, Hossain et al. (2023) present a novel IoT-ML-Blockchain integrated framework for smart agricultural management that leverages advanced sensing technologies to optimize water use and improve crop yield, contributing to the overall goal of enhancing agricultural water use efficiency and crop productivity.
Hyperspectral imaging can capture subtle changes in plant physiology that are indicative of stress, while machine learning algorithms can be employed to extract meaningful patterns from the spectral data and classify different stress types (Araus et al., 2014). Thermal sensing can detect changes in canopy temperature, which is influenced by factors such as plant water status (Li et al., 2019). By monitoring canopy temperature and comparing it to reference values, automated irrigation systems can detect plant water stress and trigger irrigation events to maintain optimal plant health and productivity (Li et al., 2019).
The integration of advanced sensing technologies in automated irrigation management systems has the potential to revolutionize precision agriculture. Jiang et al. (2019) demonstrate the effectiveness of a deep learning-based model in accurately detecting leaf spot diseases, highlighting the importance of image augmentation and deep learning algorithms in enhancing the model's performance.
Wireless sensor networks (WSNs) and energy-efficient communication protocols have the potential to significantly improve the efficiency and reliability of data collection in large-scale, long-term irrigation systems. WSNs offer a cost-effective and scalable solution for real-time data collection in large-scale irrigation systems, providing remote monitoring and automated control capabilities (Mehdizadeh et al., 2020). Nishiura and Yamamoto (2021) propose a novel sensor network system that utilizes drones and wireless power transfer to autonomously collect environmental data from sensor nodes in vast agricultural fields, reducing operational costs and enhancing the efficiency of data collection. Similarly, Higashiura and Yamamoto (2021) introduce a network system that employs UAVs and LoRa communication to efficiently collect environmental data from sensor nodes distributed across large farmlands, optimizing data collection and reducing travel distance and time.
Energy-efficient communication protocols are crucial for ensuring reliable data transmission in challenging environmental conditions and extending the lifespan of sensor nodes (Mehdizadeh et al., 2020). Al-Ali et al. (2023) investigate the potential of WSNs and energy-efficient communication protocols for data collection in large-scale, long-term irrigation systems, discussing the challenges and opportunities of using these technologies to improve the efficiency and reliability of real-time data collection in irrigation management. Mehdizadeh et al. (2020) emphasize the need for careful consideration of factors such as data accuracy, energy consumption, and network reliability when designing effective WSNs for irrigation management, enabling timely irrigation decisions and improved crop yields.
The automation of data collection through the use of advanced sensing technologies and wireless sensor networks is essential for achieving fully autonomous, scalable irrigation management. By enabling non-invasive plant stress detection and large-scale, long-term data collection, these technologies contribute to the overall goal of optimizing water resource management and increasing agricultural productivity. The integration of these technologies in real-time, end-to-end automated irrigation management systems has the potential to enhance agricultural water use efficiency and crop productivity, ultimately contributing to the development of fully autonomous, scalable irrigation management solutions.

3.4: Real-Time Data Transmission Protocols and Technologies
Real-time data transmission is a critical component of automated irrigation management systems, as it enables the timely delivery of sensor data to the cloud for processing and decision-making. The exploration of suitable protocols and network architectures is essential for ensuring efficient and reliable data transmission in these systems, contributing to the overall goal of enhancing agricultural water use efficiency and crop productivity.
The Message Queuing Telemetry Transport (MQTT) protocol has emerged as a popular choice for real-time data transmission in IoT networks, including those used for automated irrigation management. MQTT is a lightweight, publish-subscribe protocol designed for constrained devices and low-bandwidth networks (Author, 2019). Its simplicity and low overhead make it well-suited for IoT applications where data transmission speed and energy efficiency are critical (Saranyadevi et al., 2022). MQTT provides three Quality of Service (QoS) levels, ensuring data reliability in real-time scenarios (Author, 2019). Chen et al. (2020) proposed novel algorithms to improve data exchange efficiency and handle rerouting in MQTT-based IoT networks for automated irrigation management systems. Their TBRouting algorithm efficiently finds the shortest paths for data transmission, while the Rerouting algorithm effectively handles the rerouting of topic-based session flows when a broker crashes. The combination of these algorithms can significantly improve the performance and reliability of automated irrigation management systems (Chen et al., 2020).
Client-server IoT networks, such as those based on MQTT, play a crucial role in real-time data transmission for automated irrigation management systems. In these networks, sensors and devices (clients) publish data to a central broker (server), which then distributes the data to subscribed clients (Verma et al., 2021). This architecture enables efficient data collection, processing, and dissemination, facilitating the integration of various components within the automated irrigation management pipeline. Verma et al. (2021) proposed an architecture for healthcare monitoring systems using IoT and communication protocols, which provides a comprehensive overview of existing approaches and highlights challenges and opportunities in the field. Although focused on healthcare, the insights from this study can be applied to automated irrigation management systems, emphasizing the importance of interoperability and standardization for seamless integration (Verma et al., 2021).
In addition to MQTT, other application layer protocols such as XMPP, CoAP, SOAP, and HTTP have been explored for real-time data transmission in IoT networks. Each protocol has its strengths and weaknesses, making them suitable for different applications and scenarios. XMPP (Extensible Messaging and Presence Protocol) is an open-standard protocol that supports real-time messaging, presence, and request-response services (Saint-Andre, 2011). CoAP (Constrained Application Protocol) is a specialized web transfer protocol designed for use with constrained nodes and networks in the Internet of Things (Shelby et al., 2014). SOAP (Simple Object Access Protocol) is a protocol for exchanging structured information in the implementation of web services, while HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol) is the foundation of data communication for the World Wide Web (Fielding et al., 1999).
Motamedi and Villányi (2022) compared and evaluated wireless communication protocols for the implementation of smart irrigation systems in greenhouses, considering factors such as power consumption, range, reliability, and scalability. They found that ZigBee is the most suitable local communication protocol for greenhouse irrigation due to its large number of nodes and long range, while MQTT is the recommended messaging protocol for smart irrigation systems due to its TCP transport protocol and quality of service (QoS) options. GSM is a reliable and cost-effective global communication protocol for greenhouse irrigation, providing wide coverage and low cost (Motamedi & Villányi, 2022).
Syafarinda et al. (2018) investigated the use of the MQTT protocol in a precision agriculture system using a Wireless Sensor Network (WSN). They found that MQTT is suitable for use in IoT applications due to its lightweight, simple, and low bandwidth requirements. The average data transmission speed using the MQTT protocol was approximately 1 second, demonstrating its effectiveness for real-time data transmission in precision agriculture systems (Syafarinda et al., 2018).
The choice of application layer protocol for real-time irrigation management depends on factors such as data transmission speed, reliability, and energy efficiency. MQTT and RTPS (Real-Time Publish-Subscribe) are both suitable for real-time data transmission in IoT systems, but they have different strengths and weaknesses. MQTT is a better choice for applications that require low latency and high throughput, while RTPS is a better choice for applications that require high reliability and low latency (Sanchez-Iborra & Skarmeta, 2021). The exploration of MQTT and client-server IoT networks, along with the comparison of various application layer protocols, provides valuable insights into the suitability of these technologies for real-time data transmission in automated irrigation management systems.
In summary, real-time data transmission protocols and technologies play a vital role in the automation of irrigation management systems, enabling the efficient and reliable delivery of sensor data to the cloud for processing and decision-making. The exploration of MQTT and client-server IoT networks, along with the comparison of application layer protocols, highlights the importance of selecting suitable technologies based on factors such as data transmission speed, reliability, and energy efficiency. By leveraging these technologies, automated irrigation management systems can achieve seamless integration and contribute to the overall goal of enhancing agricultural water use efficiency and crop productivity.

3.5. Challenges and Solutions in Real-Time Data Transmission
Following the exploration of data collection, processing at the edge and fog, and automation in previous sections, we now turn to the critical aspect of real-time data transmission. While essential for automated irrigation management, this stage presents unique challenges that must be addressed to ensure system efficiency and reliability.
Obstacles in Real-Time Data Transmission
Agricultural environments present unique challenges for real-time data transmission, directly impacting the effectiveness of automated irrigation systems. Environmental factors can significantly disrupt wireless communication. Adverse weather conditions such as heavy rain, fog, and high winds can weaken or even block radio signals, leading to data loss and compromised system performance. Physical obstacles like trees, buildings, and uneven terrain further complicate signal propagation, creating reliability issues (Jukan et al., 2017; Yi & Ji, 2014; Zhang, Chang & Baoguo, 2018). These environmental challenges necessitate robust communication protocols and network architectures that can ensure consistent and reliable data flow.
In addition to environmental factors, technical limitations also present significant obstacles. Large-scale agricultural operations often demand long-distance data transmission, which can be hindered by the limited range of certain wireless communication protocols. Network congestion, occurring when multiple sensors transmit data concurrently, can lead to delays and potential data loss, further complicating real-time decision-making (Hameed et al., 2020). To mitigate these issues, researchers have investigated the potential of cognitive radio networks (CRNs) and dynamic spectrum access (DSA) for optimizing spectrum utilization and reducing interference (Righi et al., 2017; Shafi et al., 2018; Trigka & Dritsas, 2022). CRNs enable devices to intelligently sense and adapt to the surrounding radio environment, dynamically adjusting transmission parameters to avoid interference and improve communication efficiency. DSA, on the other hand, facilitates the dynamic allocation of unused spectrum, enhancing spectrum utilization and reducing congestion.
Furthermore, data security and privacy are paramount concerns in real-time irrigation systems. The sensitive nature of agricultural data, such as crop yields and farm management practices, necessitates robust security measures to prevent unauthorized access and data breaches (Gupta et al., 2020). Implementing secure communication protocols, authentication mechanisms, and encryption techniques is essential to protect data integrity and ensure the trustworthiness of the system.
Investigating Data Optimization Techniques
To enhance the efficiency and reliability of real-time data transmission in automated irrigation systems, researchers have explored a range of data optimization techniques. Data compression techniques aim to reduce the size of data packets transmitted over the network, minimizing bandwidth requirements and improving transmission speed (Rady et al., 2020; Karim et al., 2023). Lossless compression algorithms, such as Huffman coding and LZW, preserve data integrity while effectively reducing data size, ensuring that no information is lost during transmission (Cui, 2023). Lossy compression algorithms, such as JPEG and MP3, offer higher compression ratios but introduce a controlled level of data loss, which may be acceptable for certain applications where some loss of precision is tolerable (Karim et al., 2023). The choice between lossless and lossy compression depends on the specific application and the trade-off between data size and accuracy.
Data aggregation techniques provide another effective approach to optimize data transmission. By aggregating multiple sensor readings into a single representative value, such as average soil moisture or temperature, the number of transmissions can be significantly reduced, conserving bandwidth and energy resources (Cui, 2023). This is particularly beneficial in large-scale irrigation systems where numerous sensors are deployed across vast areas, generating substantial amounts of data. Additionally, data filtering techniques play a crucial role in improving data quality and reliability. Kalman filters and particle filters can effectively remove noise and outliers from sensor data, ensuring that only accurate and relevant information is transmitted and used for decision-making (Cui, 2023). This is essential for preventing erroneous data from influencing irrigation decisions and potentially leading to suboptimal water management.
Sensor calibration, drift correction, and fault detection are essential for maintaining data accuracy and reliability (Dos Santos et al., 2023). Regular calibration ensures that sensors provide accurate measurements over time, while drift correction techniques account for gradual changes in sensor readings due to environmental factors or aging. Fault detection mechanisms can identify and address sensor malfunctions or anomalies, preventing erroneous data from influencing irrigation decisions and potentially harming crops or wasting water.
Addressing the Challenges
Effectively addressing the challenges in real-time data transmission requires a multifaceted approach that encompasses environmental, technical, and data-related considerations. Implementing robust and adaptive communication protocols is crucial for overcoming interference and signal degradation caused by weather conditions and physical obstacles. Selecting appropriate protocols, such as LoRa or ZigBee, with suitable range and penetration capabilities can ensure reliable data transmission in challenging agricultural environments (Motamedi & Villányi, 2022). Additionally, employing techniques like frequency hopping and error correction codes can further improve communication resilience and mitigate data loss.
Optimizing network architecture is another key consideration. Deploying a distributed network architecture with edge and fog computing capabilities can significantly enhance data processing and transmission efficiency (Abdel Nasser et al., 2020; Tran et al., 2019). Edge devices can perform initial data processing and aggregation tasks, reducing the amount of data transmitted to the cloud and minimizing latency, while fog nodes can provide additional processing power and storage closer to the data source, enhancing scalability and reliability. This distributed approach alleviates the burden on the central cloud server and allows for more responsive and efficient irrigation management.
Data optimization techniques play a vital role in reducing bandwidth requirements and improving transmission efficiency. The choice of data compression, aggregation, and filtering techniques should be tailored to the specific requirements of the irrigation system, considering factors such as data type, accuracy needs, and available bandwidth. By carefully selecting and implementing these techniques, the overall performance and effectiveness of real-time irrigation systems can be significantly enhanced, leading to more sustainable water management practices and improved agricultural productivity.
By addressing these challenges and implementing appropriate solutions, real-time data transmission can become a reliable and efficient component of automated irrigation systems, contributing to the overall goal of achieving sustainable and productive agriculture in the face of growing food demands and water scarcity.

3.6. IoT Network Architectures and Variable Rate Irrigation (VRI) for Real-Time Irrigation
Real-time irrigation management systems heavily rely on the efficient and reliable transmission of data from sensors and weather stations to the cloud for processing and decision-making. However, agricultural environments present unique challenges to wireless communication, including adverse weather conditions, physical obstacles, and the limitations of wireless technologies. These challenges necessitate robust and adaptive solutions to ensure the consistent and timely flow of data, enabling truly autonomous irrigation scheduling.
Environmental factors, such as heavy rain, fog, and strong winds, can significantly disrupt wireless communication by attenuating or even blocking radio signals, leading to data loss and compromised system performance (Ed-daoudi et al., 2023; Jukan et al., 2017; Yi & Ji, 2014; Zhang, Chang & Baoguo, 2018). Dense vegetation, buildings, and uneven terrain create further complications by causing multipath propagation and shadowing effects (Yim et al., 2018; Gautam and Pagay, 2020). The study by Yim et al. (2018) on LoRa networks in a tree farm environment exemplifies these challenges, revealing reduced communication range and data reliability compared to theoretical expectations. This underscores the need for carefully selecting and optimizing communication protocols and network parameters to ensure reliable data transmission in such environments.
The study by Guzinski et al. (2014a) using a modified TSEB model further highlights the importance of high-resolution data in accurately capturing the spatial and temporal dynamics of energy fluxes influenced by environmental factors. This emphasizes the need for advanced data acquisition and processing techniques that can effectively represent the complexities of agricultural settings.
The limitations of traditional wireless communication technologies, such as limited range and network congestion, pose additional challenges for large-scale agricultural operations. Long-distance data transmission can be hindered by range limitations, while network congestion arising from numerous sensors transmitting concurrently can lead to delays and data loss, hindering real-time decision-making (Hameed et al., 2020). Addressing these challenges requires the exploration of advanced networking technologies that can optimize spectrum utilization, mitigate interference, and improve reliability and efficiency.
Cognitive Radio Networks (CRNs) and Dynamic Spectrum Access (DSA) offer promising solutions for optimizing wireless communication in agricultural settings. CRNs empower devices with the ability to intelligently sense and adapt to the surrounding radio environment, dynamically adjusting transmission parameters to avoid interference and improve communication efficiency (Righi et al., 2017; Shafi et al., 2018; Trigka & Dritsas, 2022). Research has explored the potential of CRNs in predicting Radio Frequency (RF) power to avoid noisy channels and optimize spectrum utilization (Iliya et al., 2014; Iliya et al., 2014). These studies demonstrate the effectiveness of combining optimization algorithms with artificial neural networks (ANNs) to enhance the accuracy and generalization of RF power prediction, enabling CRNs to make informed decisions about channel selection and avoid interference.
DSA complements CRN technology by dynamically allocating unused spectrum, further enhancing spectrum utilization and reducing congestion (Shi et al., 2023). The numerical model developed by Shi et al. (2023) showcases the potential of CRNs and DSA for optimizing wireless communication in challenging environments.
The integration of CRNs and DSA into the IoT network architecture requires careful consideration of spectrum sensing techniques, network topology, and data security. Research on cooperative spectrum sensing suggests that distributed approaches, where sensor nodes collaborate and share information, can significantly improve the accuracy and efficiency of spectrum sensing, particularly in dynamic environments (Trigka and Dritsas, 2022; Khalid & Yu, 2019). This collaborative approach enables a more comprehensive understanding of the radio environment and facilitates the identification of available frequency bands for data transmission.
The choice of network topology also impacts the performance and scalability of CRN-based irrigation systems. Mesh networks, where sensor nodes are interconnected and relay data for each other, offer enhanced resilience and coverage compared to star topologies where nodes communicate directly with a central gateway (Akyildiz & Vuran, 2010). However, mesh networks can be more complex to manage and may introduce additional routing overhead. The trade-off between network resilience and complexity needs to be carefully evaluated to select the most appropriate topology for a specific agricultural setting.
Data security and privacy are paramount concerns in IoT-based irrigation systems due to the sensitive nature of agricultural data (Gupta et al., 2020). Implementing secure communication protocols, authentication mechanisms, and encryption techniques is essential for protecting data integrity and ensuring system trustworthiness. Research on secure spectrum leasing and resource allocation algorithms for CR-WSN-based irrigation systems has demonstrated the potential of these technologies for enhancing security and efficiency (Hassan, 2023; Afghah et al., 2018).
In conclusion, the development of effective and reliable real-time irrigation management systems requires a comprehensive approach that addresses the challenges of data transmission in agricultural environments. The integration of robust and adaptive communication protocols, optimized network architectures, and advanced networking technologies like CRNs and DSA, along with a focus on data security and privacy, can contribute significantly to achieving the goal of autonomous and efficient irrigation scheduling.
4. AUTOMATED DATA PROCESSING IN THE CLOUD
4.1. Data Quality and Preprocessing
Data quality is paramount in automated irrigation systems as it directly influences the effectiveness of decision-making and water use efficiency. Issues like missing values, inconsistencies, and outliers arising from sensor malfunctions, environmental interference, or network problems (Lv et al., 2023) can significantly impact the performance of machine learning models used for irrigation scheduling and management.
Real-time data cleaning techniques are essential for addressing these challenges. Kalman filtering proves particularly effective in handling missing values and correcting erroneous readings by recursively estimating the system's state based on previous measurements and current sensor data, taking into account noise and uncertainty (Kim et al., 2020). Moving average techniques, by averaging consecutive data points, provide a more stable representation of the underlying trend, filtering out short-term fluctuations (Chhetri, 2023). For outlier detection, adaptive thresholding methods offer a dynamic approach, adjusting thresholds based on the statistical properties of the data to effectively identify anomalies and minimize false positives (Bah et al., 2021). These techniques are crucial in maintaining the integrity of real-time data streams and ensuring the accuracy of subsequent analyses.
Adaptive data preprocessing is essential for managing the diversity of data sources and formats commonly found in irrigation systems. Data normalization techniques, such as min-max scaling or z-score normalization, ensure that all features contribute equally to the analysis by transforming data values to a common scale (Pradal et al., 2016). This is crucial for preventing features with larger values from dominating the analysis and ensuring that all features are given equal consideration. Similarly, feature scaling methods, like standardization or normalization, optimize the range of feature values to improve the performance and convergence of machine learning models (Tortorici et al., 2024). By scaling features to a similar range, the influence of outliers is reduced, and the model's ability to learn from the data is enhanced.
Data fusion techniques play a critical role in integrating information from diverse sources, creating a more comprehensive and reliable dataset for irrigation management. Dempster-Shafer theory, a generalization of probability theory, allows for the expression of both uncertainty and the degree of conflict in evidence, making it suitable for fusing uncertain and conflicting data from heterogeneous sources (Sadiq and Rodriguez, 2004). This is particularly relevant in irrigation systems where data from different sensors may provide slightly different or even contradictory information due to sensor variations or environmental factors. Bayesian inference offers another powerful framework for combining information from multiple sources, updating the probability of a hypothesis as new evidence becomes available. By applying these techniques, data from soil moisture sensors, canopy temperature sensors, weather stations, and other sources can be integrated to provide a holistic understanding of crop water requirements and environmental conditions, leading to more informed and accurate irrigation decisions.
The impact of data quality extends beyond model accuracy to the robustness of machine learning models under varying conditions. Robust models should maintain consistent performance even when faced with data inconsistencies or unexpected situations. Techniques like data augmentation and domain adaptation can enhance model robustness by exposing the model to a wider range of data variations during training. Data augmentation involves generating additional training data by applying transformations or introducing noise to existing data, making the model more resilient to noise and variations in the real-world data. Domain adaptation techniques aim to adapt a model trained on one domain (e.g., a specific crop or geographic location) to perform well on another domain with different data characteristics. This is particularly relevant in irrigation management, where models may need to be applied to different crops, soil types, or climatic conditions.
The choice of data cleaning, preprocessing, and fusion techniques should be carefully considered based on the specific characteristics of the irrigation system and the available data. By selecting and implementing appropriate techniques, the accuracy, reliability, and robustness of machine learning models can be significantly improved, leading to more efficient and sustainable irrigation management practices.
4.2. Scalable and Autonomous Deployment using Containerization Strategies
The transition from data collection and transmission to efficient data processing requires a robust infrastructure capable of handling diverse workloads and data volumes. Containerization technologies, specifically Docker and Kubernetes, offer a promising solution for deploying and scaling data processing and machine learning modules within cloud environments like AWS, Azure, and GCP (Vargas-Rojas et al., 2024; Rosendo et al., 2022; Solayman & Qasha, 2023). Docker provides a standardized way to package applications and their dependencies into self-contained units known as containers, ensuring consistent and reproducible execution across different platforms (Rosendo et al., 2022). Kubernetes, acting as a container orchestrator, manages their deployment, scaling, and networking across a cluster of machines (Rosendo et al., 2022). This combination presents several advantages for automated irrigation management systems.
Firstly, containerization facilitates efficient resource utilization and scalability. By encapsulating applications and their dependencies, containers enable the isolation of resources and prevent conflicts between different modules (Vargas-Rojas et al., 2024; Solayman & Qasha, 2023). This isolation allows for the efficient allocation of resources, such as CPU, memory, and storage, to each container based on its specific needs. Kubernetes further enhances scalability by allowing for the automatic scaling of containers based on real-time demand, ensuring the system can adapt to varying workloads and data volumes, preventing bottlenecks, and ensuring responsiveness to changing conditions (Karamolegkos et al., 2023).
Secondly, containerization promotes portability and reproducibility. By packaging applications and their dependencies into a single unit, containers make it easy to move and deploy them across different cloud environments without the need for environment-specific configurations (Rosendo et al., 2022; Solayman & Qasha, 2023). This portability simplifies the development and deployment process, reducing the time and effort required to set up and manage the system. Additionally, containers ensure reproducibility by providing a consistent execution environment, regardless of the underlying infrastructure. This eliminates variability and ensures that the system will behave consistently across different deployments (Zhou et al., 2023).
Optimizing container orchestration and resource allocation is crucial to minimizing latency and maximizing throughput in real-time data processing pipelines. Techniques like auto-scaling and dynamic resource allocation play a critical role in this context (Hethcoat et al., 2024; Werner and Tai, 2023; Kumar et al., 2024). Auto-scaling automatically adjusts the number of container instances based on real-time demand, ensuring that sufficient resources are available to handle peak workloads while avoiding over-provisioning during periods of low demand (Hethcoat et al., 2024; Kumar et al., 2024). Dynamic resource allocation enables the fine-grained adjustment of resources allocated to each container based on its specific needs and the current workload (Werner and Tai, 2023). This ensures efficient resource allocation and provides each container with the necessary resources to perform its tasks effectively.
Performance monitoring tools, such as Kubernetes Metrics Server and Prometheus, are essential for gaining insights into the performance of containers and the overall system (Hethcoat et al., 2024; Kuity & Peddoju, 2023). These tools provide valuable data on key performance indicators, such as CPU and memory usage, network traffic, and application-specific metrics. By monitoring this data, administrators can identify bottlenecks, optimize resource allocation strategies, and continuously improve system performance (Hethcoat et al., 2024). This data-driven approach ensures that automated irrigation management systems can operate efficiently and reliably.
By integrating containerization technologies with optimization techniques and performance monitoring, automated irrigation management systems achieve the scalability, autonomy, and efficiency required for effective real-time data processing and decision-making. This approach facilitates a seamless and responsive system that can adapt to changing conditions and contribute to the overall goal of optimizing water resource management and increasing agricultural productivity.

4.3. Deploying ML Models for Data Processing
Transitioning from data collection, preprocessing, and transmission, the deployment of machine learning (ML) models marks a pivotal stage in the automated irrigation management pipeline. This stage entails utilizing cloud platforms to facilitate real-time data processing and inference, enabling data-driven decision-making for optimal irrigation management and ultimately contributing to fully autonomous, scalable irrigation management.
Several architectures and frameworks exist for deploying ML models on cloud platforms, each offering unique advantages and catering to different requirements. TensorFlow Serving, for instance, provides a high-performance system specifically designed for serving TensorFlow models (Abadi et al., 2016). This framework enables efficient and scalable inference, making it suitable for real-time applications where low latency and high throughput are crucial. For instance, in a large-scale irrigation system with numerous sensors generating data continuously, TensorFlow Serving can efficiently handle the high volume of inference requests and provide timely predictions for irrigation scheduling. Similarly, Apache MXNet Model Server offers a flexible and efficient solution for deploying models trained with MXNet, supporting a wide range of deep learning models and inference backends (MXNet Developers, 2015). This versatility makes it suitable for complex irrigation systems that may utilize different types of ML models for various tasks, such as predicting crop water requirements, detecting plant stress, or forecasting weather conditions. ONNX Runtime, on the other hand, provides a cross-platform inference engine compatible with various ML frameworks, including PyTorch, TensorFlow, and MXNet (Microsoft, 2017). This versatility enables the deployment of models in diverse environments, facilitating interoperability and reducing the need for model conversion. For example, an irrigation system that uses models trained in different frameworks can utilize ONNX Runtime to deploy them on a single platform without the need for time-consuming and error-prone model conversion processes.
Choosing the appropriate architecture or framework depends on several factors, including the specific ML framework used for model training, the desired level of performance and scalability, and the need for cross-platform compatibility. For instance, if the primary concern is low latency and high throughput for real-time inference, TensorFlow Serving might be the optimal choice for TensorFlow models. However, if flexibility and support for various deep learning models are required, Apache MXNet Model Server could be more suitable. In cases where cross-platform compatibility is essential, ONNX Runtime offers a versatile solution.
Once the ML model is deployed, optimizing its performance and resource utilization becomes crucial for ensuring the efficiency of integrated end-to-end automated irrigation systems. Model compression techniques, such as pruning and quantization, offer effective methods for reducing the size and computational requirements of ML models without compromising accuracy (Premkumar & Sigappi, 2022). Pruning involves eliminating unnecessary connections or neurons from the model, effectively streamlining its structure and reducing computational complexity. This can be particularly beneficial for deep learning models, which often have a large number of parameters and can be prone to overfitting. By removing redundant or less important connections, pruning can improve modelgeneralizability and reduce inference time. Quantization, on the other hand, involves reducing the precision of model parameters, typically from 32-bit floating-point numbers to lower-precision formats such as 8-bit integers. This reduction in precision leads to smaller model sizes and faster inference speeds, making it particularly beneficial for resource-constrained environments or real-time applications. For instance, in edge computing scenarios where ML models are deployed on devices with limited computational resources, quantization can enable efficient inference without sacrificing accuracy.
Furthermore, hardware acceleration through the utilization of GPUs or TPUs can significantly enhance model performance by leveraging specialized hardware designed for parallel processing (Premkumar & Sigappi, 2022). GPUs, with their massive parallelism and high memory bandwidth, excel at accelerating matrix operations and convolutions, which are fundamental computations in many deep learning models. This acceleration can significantly reduce inference time and enable real-time processing of sensor data for timely irrigation decisions. TPUs, specifically designed for deep learning workloads, offer even greater performance and energy efficiency for specific model architectures. These hardware accelerators can drastically reduce inference time, enabling near real-time decision-making and enhancing the responsiveness of automated irrigation systems. For example, in a scenario where immediate response to changing weather conditions or soil moisture levels is critical, hardware acceleration can ensure that irrigation decisions are made and executed promptly.
In addition to model compression and hardware acceleration, distributed training techniques play a crucial role in optimizing the training process for large-scale ML models. Techniques such as Horovod and BytePS enable the distribution of training across multiple machines, effectively parallelizing the process and reducing training time (Premkumar & Sigappi, 2022). This is particularly beneficial for complex models with a large number of parameters or when dealing with large datasets. By leveraging distributed training, irrigation management systems can train more sophisticated models and improve their predictive capabilities, leading to more accurate and efficient irrigation decisions. For instance, a system that utilizes a deep learning model with millions of parameters can benefit from distributed training to reduce training time from days to hours, enabling faster model iteration and improvement.
Integrating the deployed ML models with other components of the automated irrigation management pipeline is essential for achieving a fully autonomous and cohesive system and addressing the need for seamless integration across the automated irrigation management system. Standardized protocols, such as MQTT and CoAP, provide lightweight and efficient communication channels for exchanging data between these components (Poojara et al., 2023; Jimenez et al., 2020a; Gour et al., 2023). MQTT, with its publish-subscribe architecture, enables real-time data streaming and event-driven communication, making it suitable for transmitting sensor data, control signals, and inference results (Raikar & M, 2023). This enables the ML model to receive real-time updates on soil moisture, weather conditions, and plant health, allowing for dynamic adjustments to irrigation schedules based on the latest data. CoAP, designed for constrained devices and low-power networks, offers a web-transfer protocol for resource-constrained environments, enabling efficient communication between sensors, actuators, and the ML models (Raikar & M, 2023). This is particularly relevant in situations where sensors or actuators have limited processing power or battery life, as CoAP minimizes communication overhead and energy consumption. Additionally, RESTful APIs provide a standardized interface for accessing and controlling the ML models, enabling seamless integration with other software components and facilitating system management and monitoring (Wang et al., 2022). This allows for easy integration with existing farm management systems or third-party applications, creating a unified platform for comprehensive irrigation management.4.4. Online Learning in the Cloud
The complexities of real-time data processing in irrigation management necessitate the exploration of advanced techniques to continuously learn and adapt to the dynamic nature of agricultural environments. Online learning algorithms offer a promising solution, enabling the continuous update and improvement of machine learning models based on incoming real-time data. This adaptability is crucial for addressing the challenges of changing environmental conditions, such as weather patterns and crop growth stages, and optimizing irrigation decision-making to enhance water usage efficiency and crop productivity.
Several online learning algorithms have demonstrated potential for real-time data processing and model adaptation in the context of irrigation management. Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) facilitates the incremental update of model parameters with each new data point, allowing for efficient adaptation to changing data distributions (Bottou, 2010). This incremental learning process ensures that the model remains responsive to the latest conditions, minimizing the risk of outdated predictions and improving the accuracy of irrigation decisions. Passive-Aggressive algorithms, on the other hand, adjust model parameters only when a misclassification occurs, providing a computationally efficient approach for handling large data streams (Crammer et al., 2006). These algorithms offer a robust approach to handling noisy data, a common challenge in real-world sensor readings, by making small adjustments only when the model's prediction deviates significantly from the actual value (Fei et al., 2019). Online Random Forests extend the concept of random forests to the online setting, enabling the incremental construction and update of decision trees as new data arrives (Saffari et al., 2009). The continuous evolution of the ensemble ensures that the model remains relevant to the changing environment, capturing intricate relationships between variables and leading to more informed irrigation decisions.
Research in various domains highlights the importance of online learning for real-time data stream analytics. Snyder et al. (2020) explored the application of online learning techniques for identifying relevant tweets in real-time, improving situational awareness for first responders. The proposed interactive learning framework allows users to continuously label the relevance of incoming tweets, enabling the real-time refinement of the underlying machine learning model. This user-guided approach aligns well with the dynamic nature of irrigation management, where models need to continuously adjust to varying environmental conditions and crop water requirements. Similarly, research in the field of cyber-physical systems (CPS) underscores the need for online learning algorithms to effectively extract insights and knowledge from continuously generated data streams (Fei et al., 2019). These capabilities are crucial for enabling feedback loops between physical processes and cyber elements, facilitating the integration and optimization of CPS in irrigation management systems.
To implement online learning in cloud-based irrigation management systems, various architectures and frameworks can be considered. Apache Spark Streaming, Apache Flink, and AWS Kinesis provide scalable and fault-tolerant platforms for processing real-time data streams, allowing for the development of online learning pipelines that continuously ingest and analyze data to update machine learning models (Zaharia et al., 2012; Carbone et al., 2015; Amazon Web Services, 2023). These frameworks leverage serverless computing paradigms, automatically scaling resources based on the volume and velocity of incoming data, ensuring efficient resource utilization and responsiveness to fluctuations in demand (Fei et al., 2019).
Effectively managing the exploration-exploitation trade-off is crucial for optimizing online learning in irrigation management. Techniques such as Multi-armed bandits (Sutton & Barto, 2018), Bayesian optimization (Shahriari et al., 2016), and Reinforcement Learning (RL) (Sutton & Barto, 2018) can be employed to balance the allocation of resources between exploring new irrigation strategies and exploiting the current best-performing approaches. These techniques enable the identification of optimal irrigation policies, adapting to changing environmental conditions and maximizing long-term rewards.
In conclusion, online learning techniques, coupled with scalable cloud-based architectures, offer a powerful solution for real-time data processing and continuous adaptation in irrigation management systems. By leveraging algorithms like SGD, Passive-Aggressive, and Online Random Forests, along with stream processing frameworks like Apache Spark Streaming, Apache Flink, and AWS Kinesis, irrigation management systems can effectively handle the complexities of real-time data, optimize water usage, and enhance crop productivity in the face of dynamic environmental conditions.

Díaz-Alcaide & P. Martínez-Santos  2636 Accesses 129 Citations Explore all metrics Abstract Groundwater resources can be expected to be increasingly relied upon in the near future, as a consequence of rapid population growth and global environmental change. Cost-effective and efficient techniques for groundwater exploration are gaining recognition as tools to underpin hydrogeological surveys in mid- and low-income regions. This paper provides a state of the art on groundwater potential mapping, an explorative technique based on remote sensing and geographical databases that has experienced major developments in recent years. A systematic review of over 200 directly relevant papers is presented. Twenty variables were found to be frequently involved in groundwater potential investigations, of which eight are almost always present: geology, lineaments, landforms, soil, land use/land cover, rainfall, drainage density, and slope. The more innovative approaches draw from satellite images to develop indicators related to vegetation, evapotranspiration, soil moisture and thermal anomalies, among others. Data integration is carried out either through expert judgement or through machine-learning techniques, the latter being less common. Three main conclusions were reached: (1) for optimal results, groundwater mapping must be used as a tool to complement field work, rather than a low-cost substitute; (2) the potential of remote-sensing techniques in groundwater exploration is enormous, particularly when the power of machine learning is harnessed by involving human judgement; (3) quality assurance remains the main challenge ahead, as exemplified by the fact that a majority of the existing studies in the literature lack adequate validation. Résumé Il est attendu, comme conséquence de l’augmentation rapide de la population et des changements environnementaux globaux, que les ressources en eaux souterraines soient de plus en plus nécessaires dans le futur. Des techniques efficaces et à bas coût pour l’exploration des aquifères sont de plus en plus reconnues en tant qu’outils en support aux investigations hydrogéologiques dans les régions à moyen et bas revenus. Cet article dresse un état de l’art concernant la cartographie du potentiel en eaux souterraines, une technique exploratoire basée sur la télédétection et les bases de données géographiques qui ont montré d’importants développements ces dernières années. Un examen systématique de plus de 200 articles traitant directement ce sujet est présenté. Vingt variables sont fréquemment prises en compte dans les études du potentiel en eaux souterraines, dont huit sont presque systématiquement utilisées: géologie, linéaments, reliefs, sol, utilisation/occupation des sols, pluies, densité de drainage, et pentes. Les approches les plus innovantes se basent sur les images satellitaires pour développer des indicateurs liés, entre autre, à la végétation, l’évapotranspiration, l’humidité des sols et les anomalies thermiques. L’intégration des données est réalisée soit par avis d’experts soit, moins fréquemment, par des techniques d’apprentissage machine. Trois conclusions principales peuvent être établies: (1) pour un résultat optimal, la cartographie du potentiel doit être utilisée comme un outil complémentaire au travail de terrain plutôt qu’un substitut à bas coût; (2) le potentiel d’utilisation des techniques de télédétection est très important, surtout lorsque la puissance de l’apprentissage machine est consolidée par l’avis d’expert; (3) le contrôle de la qualité reste le défi principal pour le futur, la majorité des études relevées dans la littérature manquant cruellement d’une validation adéquate. Resumen Las aguas subterráneas constituyen un recurso estratégico cuya importancia tenderá a incrementarse en el actual contexto de crecimiento poblacional y cambio climático. Las técnicas de exploración y prospección basadas en metodologías de bajo coste son de especial importancia en regiones de renta media y baja. Este artículo presenta un estado del arte sobre la cartografía de potencial hidrogeológico, una técnica exploratoria basada en la utilización conjunta de teledetección, cartografía tradicional y sistemas de información geográfica que ha experimentado importantes avances en tiempos recientes. Para su elaboración se ha llevado a cabo la revisión de más de 200 artículos de la bibliografía especializada. Hasta veinte variables distintas se encuentran habitualmente en trabajos de estas características, de las cuales ocho aparecen casi siempre: litología, lineamientos, geomorfología, suelo, uso del territorio, precipitación, densidad de drenaje y pendiente. Los estudios de carácter más avanzado utilizan además imágenes de satélite para el desarrollo de indicadores relativos a la vegetación, evapotranspiración, humedad y anomalías térmicas, entre otros. La integración de todas las capas de información se lleva a cabo habitualmente mediante criterio experto, siendo las técnicas de aprendizaje artificial menos comunes. De lo anterior se derivan tres conclusiones principales: (1) la cartografía de potencial hidrogeológico debe interpretarse como una herramienta para complementar el trabajo de campo, más que como un sustituto de bajo coste para el mismo; (2) el potencial de este tipo de técnicas es enorme, especialmente si se combina el criterio experto con las posibilidades que hoy brinda la inteligencia artificial; y (3) el control de calidad constituye el principal reto de futuro, como demuestra el hecho de que la mayoría de los estudios consultados carece de un procedimiento de validación. 摘要 由于人口迅速增长和全球环境变化,预计在不久的将来地下水资源的依赖性将逐渐增加。经济有效的地下水勘探技术正被认为是支撑中低收入地区水文地质调查的工具。本文提供了基于近年来经历重大发展的遥感和地理数据库探索技术的地下水势制图的最新技术。对200多篇直接相关论文进行了系统评述。发现与地下水势相关的20个常用变量,其中8个经常被用到:地质,地表特征,地貌,土壤,土地利用/土地覆盖,降雨,排水密度和坡度。更具创新的方法是利用卫星图像来确定与植被,蒸散发,土壤湿度和热异常等有关的指标。数据集成通过专家判断或机器学习技术进行,后者不常见。得出了三个主要结论:(1)为获得最佳结果,必须将地下水势制图作为补充野外工作的工具,而不是低成本的替代品。(2)遥感技术在地下水勘探中的潜力是巨大的,特别是当包括人类判断的机器学习的能力。(3)质量保证仍然是未来的主要挑战,例如文献中的大多数现有研究缺乏充分的验证。 Resumo Espera-se que os recursos hídricos subterrâneos sejam crescentemente demandados até um futuro próximo, como consequência do rápido crescimento populacional e mudanças ambientais globais.

Aquifers provide drinking water to at least 50% of the global population, and account for 43% of all water used for irrigation. Furthermore, 2.5 billion people worldwide depend solely on groundwater resources to satisfy their daily needs (UNESCO 2015). Groundwater is particularly important in arid and semiarid climates, where droughts are frequent and where surface-water resources are often unreliable (Llamas and Martínez-Santos 2005). While crucial for human beings and ecosystems, groundwater resources suffer from the “hidden treasure” syndrome. Because groundwater is out of sight, aquifers are seldom well known, even in industrialized countries. This often leads to widespread contamination and dropping water tables, and hampers attempts to manage the resource in a sustainable manner. Groundwater mapping has been defined as a tool for systematic development and planning of water resources (Elbeih 2015). Hydrogeological maps provide spatially distributed information about aquifers, including their geological, hydrogeological and hydrochemical characteristics. Groundwater maps may be used to develop strategies for sustainable management, allowing water planners to identify zones suitable for siting productive wells. Moreover, mapping contributes to understanding the vulnerability of aquifers and their associated ecosystems to contamination and overexploitation, to identify areas for artificial recharge, and to convey information to groundwater users. Furthermore, groundwater maps may reveal links between groundwater resources and human settlements (Ahmed and Sajjad 2018). Inevitably, a conventional groundwater map is the synthesis of numerous variables. Field data can be problematic to obtain because surveys are typically time- and resource-intensive, particularly in the case of remote regions. In a world where a large share of the rural population relies on groundwater, and where millions still lack access to safe drinking supplies (Martínez-Santos 2017), this calls for alternative approaches to make groundwater exploration as efficient as possible. Consider remote sensing (RS) technologies. While satellite- and air-borne sensors are of limited use in groundwater surveys, they do provide valuable insights regarding certain hydrogeological processes and variables, particularly when combined with various other information sources. Remotely obtained data are especially important in developing regions, where hydrogeological monitoring is seldom systematic and where the potential of groundwater resources remains largely unknown. This is one of the reasons why many hydrogeologists worldwide have become accustomed to making use of remote sensing and geographic information systems (GIS). Jha et al. (2007) identified six major applications of RS/GIS in the field of groundwater, including the exploration and assessment of groundwater resources (Abdalla 2012; Fashae et al. 2014; Martín-Loeches et al. 2018), the selection of artificial recharge sites (Samadder et al. 2011), subsurface flow and/or pollution modelling (Leblanc et al. 2007), aquifer vulnerability and protection (Vias et al. 2005; Hernández-Espriú et al. 2014; Hadzic et al. 2015), estimations of natural recharge (Yeh et al. 2016; Mokadem et al. 2018) and hydrogeological data analysis and process monitoring (Crossman et al. 2012; Dailey et al. 2015; Sahoo et al. 2018). The number of applications of satellite information in groundwater science continues to grow. Take for instance the Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE), whose data have been used in recent times to monitor large-scale variations in groundwater storage (Feng et al. 2013; Lakshmi 2016). This paper deals specifically with the first of these applications, i.e. groundwater potential mapping. As demonstrated in the following pages, interest in this topic has increased dramatically in recent years. Thus, the main aim of this paper is to provide a critical overview of the existing methods. To the authors’ knowledge, there are only two precedents of this intent in the literature. The first one is the aforementioned review of RS/GIS applications to groundwater science provided by Jha et al. (2007), who touched upon the issue of groundwater potential mapping in the context of a broader study. The second one is the review carried out by Jasmin and Mallikarjuna (2011), which deals specifically with groundwater potential placing the emphasis on the Indian context. With this in mind, this contribution is two-fold. First, it provides an updated overview of groundwater potential methods based on a thorough review of the booming body of literature published in the last decade. This is perceived as a valuable addition in a field associated with rapidly evolving methods and technologies such as increasingly accurate satellite imaging and machine-learning techniques. Moreover, this work broadens the geographical focus, thus providing a global perspective on the state of the art. Literature review The following sections compile the findings of a literature review of over 200 papers, leading to two main conclusions. The first one is that the topic of groundwater potential mapping has drawn considerable attention among hydrogeologists in recent times. While a good number of earlier publications were found (Sander et al. 1996, Shahid et al. 2000, Jaiswal et al. 2003, Rao and Jugran 2004, Ravi Shankar and Mohan 2006, Solomon and Quiel 2006, Prasad et al. 2007, among many others), the truth is there has been a significant increase in the amount of groundwater potential research after 2010, more than 50% of the literature stemming from the years 2012–2018. The vast majority of these documents pertain to regional-scale case histories in the Middle East, Africa and South Asia (Fig. 1). A detailed classification revealed 22% to refer to sedimentary basins, 42% to crystalline terrains and 36% to mixed geological media. Climate-wise, over 95% of the literature deals with arid, semiarid or tropical domains.

(2018), Siddha and Sahu (2018) Full size image The second conclusion has to do with the sheer extent of the available information. It would be fair to say that the proliferation of academic sources and online repositories rendered it impossible to perform a strictly exhaustive review. For practical purposes, however, this is only perceived as a minor drawback, as the investigation consistently failed to reveal new methodological information after the first 30 or 40 documents were analysed. This, coupled with the fact that the number of sources is considerable, suggests that the review was sufficiently comprehensive for practical purposes. Defining groundwater potential Interestingly, the search revealed neither a universal definition of groundwater potential, nor a standardized method or set of units to measure the outcomes. A closer look at the literature shows that groundwater potential mapping means different things to different authors. While most assume that a groundwater potential map provides an indication of variations in groundwater storage across a given region, others simply interpret it as a measure of how likely groundwater is to be found or as to where the highest yields may take place. A minority places the emphasis on delineating optimal locations to site boreholes at the local scale. Thus, even though there is a methodological consensus—groundwater potential maps are always developed based on a series of indirect indicators—it is also true that very few authors actually attempt to define “groundwater potential”. Broadly speaking, groundwater potential studies aim at identifying optimal zones for groundwater development. Since groundwater development presents a utilitarian component—groundwater is used “for something”—it makes sense to bring purpose into the definition. In this context, what works for rural water supplies in low-income countries does not necessarily work for large irrigation developments in industrialized regions, neither in terms of yield, nor in terms of water quality. Certain authors thus refer their studies to a particular use or set of uses. For instance, Siddha and Sahu (2018) took into account multiple water quality and pumping test parameters to develop a groundwater potential map to underpin domestic water supplies in Gandhinagar, India. Similarly, Martín-Loeches et al. (2018) developed a groundwater potential map for the specific purpose of siting drinking water boreholes for rural communities in Caimbambo, Angola. From a language point of view, the term “potential” refers to a latent quality or ability that may or may not be actualized. In other words, the idea of potential has to do with the probability of something happening. With this in mind, a groundwater potential map was defined as a spatially distributed estimate of the physical capacity of the terrain to yield enough groundwater for a given use based on a series of indirect indicators. This conceptualization recognizes (1) the spatial component intrinsic to groundwater resources, and (2) that no single source of information is failsafe, which means thatas many as possible are needed to be integrated to minimize the uncertainties inherent to groundwater exploration. Furthermore, by speaking of potential, the hypothetical nature of the intent (and of its results), i.e. that a groundwater potential map is essentially a hydrogeologist’s “best estimate” is acknowledged. This holds true even in the case of maps checked against ground truth, as these are typically validated on limited datasets. Relevant sources and variables in groundwater potential studies Each document in the database was examined for the purpose of identifying the key elements involved in groundwater potential mapping. Over 20 parameter groups were identified, approximately 40% of which were found consistently across most studies (Fig. 1). These include lithology (geology), geomorphology, soil, land use/land cover, topography, lineaments, drainage- and slope-related variables, rainfall and groundwater recharge. The main factor determining the kind of information involved in each study seems to be whether the map was carried out a priori, that is, in the absence of groundwater data, or a posteriori, that is, with access to it. The former were found to rely almost exclusively on parameters that can be obtained without direct presence on the field (digital elevation models, preexisting cartography, satellite images), whereas the latter invariably banked on additional information sources such as groundwater levels, borehole yields and drilling success rates. Another key factor is the scale of work. The relevance of local variables such as certain landforms or lineaments, is lost when developing maps that span several thousands of square kilometres. Conversely, the spatial variation of rainfall and recharge may be close to meaningless when dealing with a scale of a few square kilometres (largely because of the absence of actual spatially distributed information at that scale). All these factors explain why maps very rarely, if ever, consider all variables in Fig. 1. All variables were classified in five categories as per their source of information—cartography, satellite images, digital elevation models, borehole data, other. Note that some papers were found to use a given parameter that was not listed explicitly. For instance, using a preexisting geological map implicitly means relying on the borehole/geophysical data that were used to produce it, even if this was not mentioned in the study. Moreover, in some cases it was found that the authors described a given variable, although it is unclear whether they actually used it; thus, the outcomes presented in Fig. 1 should be interpreted with some leniency. Cartographic sources Geology is the single most important factor determining groundwater occurrence. Since the geology of groundwater has been discussed extensively in the literature (Freeze and Cherry 1979, Fetter 1993, Younger 2007, among many others) only a schematic description will be provided here. Groundwater can only be stored and circulate within the rock’s fractures and voids, which implies that it is the porosity and permeability of the materials that ultimately constrain groundwater potential. In practice the challenge typically consists in identifying those formations which are more likely to hold water. These include, but are not limited to, nonunconsolidated deposits, weathering products and fissured and soluble sedimentary rocks. Groundwater is near ubiquitous in the case of unconsolidated sediments. These present intergranular porosity and a wide range of textures and permeabilities, which means that they usually make up either aquifers or aquitards. Under certain circumstances, the accumulations of unconsolidated materials can be hundreds or thousands of meters thick, making them highly interesting from the hydrogeological standpoint, even in those cases where the average permeability may be low. Similar considerations apply to alluvial fans, except that these typically make up shallow aquifers of limited potential. Consolidated sedimentary rocks such as limestone and sandstone also favour groundwater occurrence, particularly when heavily fractured and, in the case of limestone, when karstified. In such cases, groundwater flow takes place predominantly along fractures and conduits. These rocks can however be close to impervious if fracturing and/or karstification is either limited or altogether absent. With the exception of some volcanic rocks, igneous and metamorphic materials do not constitute good aquifers. It is however possible to find moderate amounts of groundwater in coarse-grained weathering products overlying crystalline rocks, as well as in fractures. Because structural features play an important role in the infiltration and movement of groundwater (Chilton and Foster 1995; Meijerink 1996; Assatse et al. 2016), the definition of hydrogeological units is typically complemented by lineament mapping (Nag 2005; Bruning et al. 2011; Adeyeye et al. 2015; Varade et al. 2018). Lineaments are best described as elongated geological discontinuities associated with networks of fractures. These may extend over thousands of kilometres, and may be several kilometres wide and deep. Traditionally, lineament maps were developed from aerial photographs. Nowadays they can also be discerned from digitally processed colour composites, radar data or digital elevation models (Dar et al. 2010; Wendt et al. 2016; Das et al. 2018). These may lead, for instance, to the identification of geological features associated with the presence of soil moisture or vegetation (Sahoo et al. 2018). Lineament mapping has proven valuable in numerous groundwater exploration surveys in the past (Teeuw 1995; Sander 2007). For instance, the classic paper by Sander et al. (1996) demonstrates how careful lineament mapping was instrumental in improving the borehole success rate in the Voltaian sedimentary basin, central Ghana. Nevertheless, lineament mapping has often been criticized for its reliance on intuition, which inevitably leads to nonrepeatable results. Reproducibility can be increased either by comparing and integrating the outcomes obtained by several operators in the same area or by using automated methods. Both alternatives present practical drawbacks (Sander et al. 1997; Meijerink 2007; Sander 2007), a combination of the two being the most recommendable approach to smooth out inconsistencies. Sander et al. (1996) point out that a large proportion of the developing world is underlain by rocks where groundwater occurs chiefly in fracture zones. As many of these regions are subject to prolonged dry seasons and waterborne disease, groundwater is their only potable resource. This attests to the importance of appropriate lineament delineation in groundwater potential studies. Geomorphology is the study of landforms and structural features of the landscape. Geomorphological maps are usually developed through field surveys, aerial photos and satellite images, and serve the purpose of identifying those features that may be favourable to infiltration, groundwater storage, or both. Alluvial fans, sand dunes, weathering mantles, floodplains and other accumulations of unconsolidated material typically rank among the most interesting geomorphological features from the point of view of groundwater (Venkateswaran and Ayyandurai 2015). Conversely, landforms such as inselbergs, scarps and ridges can be safely assumed to be of little practical use. Soil data are routinely used in groundwater recharge and vulnerability studies (Vias et al. 2005, Samadder et al. 2011, Mokadem et al. 2018). This is mostly because soil permeability is directly related to effective porosity, grain shape and size, and void ratio, which means that soil type plays an important role in infiltration. For this reason, studies considering soil-related variables frequently do so together with rainfall and/or recharge (Nanda et al. 2017, Thapa et al. 2017b, Al Shaheeb et al. 2018). Typically, the higher infiltration potential is associated with sandy and gravelly soils, while clayey and silty soils rank among the least favourable. Fine sands and loamy soils can be expected to present moderate permeability. Land use and cover play a similar role to soil type, for both are related to aquifer recharge. The integration of land use and land cover in groundwater potential studies attests to the fact that human activities can alter hydrological dynamics—for instance, cropland and forests are often considered favourable to groundwater occurrence because ploughing, root development and biological activity all favour infiltration. Areas in close proximity to permanent water bodies also tend to correlate with a higher groundwater potential (Naghibi et al. 2017; Singh et al. 2018). Conversely, hills, human settlements and wastelands are generally disregarded (Magesh et al. 2012; Martín-Loeches et al. 2018; Patra et al. 2018). Despite its influence on some of the aforementioned aspects, attempts are usually made to consider aquifer replenishment as a stand-alone factor. This can be problematic because groundwater potential mapping is typically applied in data-scarce regions, where aquifer recharge is poorly characterized. Furthermore, the idea of groundwater potential mapping via RS/GIS is to develop predictive maps based on whatever is readily available, rather than to improve the existing knowledge about specific variables. Thus, even if the recharge mapping literature is rich (Selvam et al. 2015; Yeh et al. 2016; Mokadem et al. 2018), there are comparatively fewer examples of groundwater mapping studies using quantitative recharge estimates (An et al. 2012; Konkul et al. 2014; Oikonomidis et al. 2015). These tend to rely either on third-party information or on uncomplicated techniques (rainfall minus evapotranspiration, quantification of canal losses, etc.). In contrast, the use of rainfall is far more common (Nampak et al. 2014; Madani and Niyazi 2015; Bashe 2017; Panahi et al. 2017; Nanda et al. 2017; Jenifer and Jha 2017; Thapa et al. 2017; Hussein et al. 2017). Spatially distributed rainfall estimates are generally developed by geostatistical extrapolation of point-source information. Digital elevation models Satellites are equipped with remote sensors, that is, devices that can capture information about objects from far away. Remote sensors are either active or passive. The former send a signal in the direction of the object to be investigated, while the latter measure the radiation that naturally emanates from it (usually reflected sunlight). The majority of active sensors operate in the microwave portion of the electromagnetic spectrum, which makes them able to penetrate the atmosphere under most conditions. Conversely, most passive systems used in remote sensing applications operate in the visible, infrared, thermal infrared, and microwave portions of the electromagnetic spectrum. Examples of active sensors are radars, laser altimeters, laser radars, ranging instruments, scatterometers and sounders. Passive sensors include accelerometers, hyperspectral and imaging radiometers, spectrometers and spectroradiometers (NASA 2018a). Satellite information is increasingly recognized as a cost-effective tool in many scientific domains. This is largely because its accessibility has become widespread in recent years, thus allowing scientific communities to develop applications within their respective fields. Digital elevation models (DEM) provide an excellent example of cross-discipline application. DEMs usually adopt the shape of raster files, and may be developed from many data sources, including field surveys. Currently, however, DEMs are mostly obtained from active sensor (radar, LIDAR) or passive optical sensor data. The radar-based Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM) and the optical Advanced Spaceborne Thermal Emission and Reflection Radiometer (ASTER) rank among those whose use is most widespread. Both are available for free and currently provide consistent information at the global scale for a spatial resolution of 1 arc-second (30 m) (Wendt et al. 2016). In general, the application of DEMs to groundwater exploration relies on the assumption that shallow groundwater flow is partially driven by surface features, and parameterized by properties that can be inferred from surface data (Elbeih 2015); thus, topography may be used to identify lowlands, basins, closed depressions and other theoretically favourable settings. Furthermore, digital elevation information can be treated to gain additional insight (Liu et al. 2015)—for instance, slope provides important clues as to the nature of various geological and geodynamic processes, including groundwater recharge (Fashae et al. 2014; Kumar et al. 2016). Gentle slopes imply slow runoff, and thus, more time for infiltration, while, conversely, steeper gradients suggest greater erosion and short residence time. In groundwater potential mapping, this is frequently associated with a lesser probability of accumulation of unconsolidated sediments and recharge (Ibrahim-Bathis and Ahmed 2016). DEMs may also be used to develop drainage density maps. Drainage density is computed as the total length of the streams per catchment unit area; thus, it represents how close together the stream channels are. A very high drainage density means that runoff can be evacuated quickly, and thus, that infiltration is less likely (Magesh et al. 2012; Fashae et al. 2014). There are, however, some exceptions, as groundwater can be expected to accumulate in alluvial sediments in the flatter areas of the catchment (Das et al. 2018). In addition, a high drainage density can be assimilated to a larger erosion potential. Parallelisms between drainage density and terrain permeability may be found in certain geological environments (Meijerink 2007). Topography not only controls groundwater flow to some extent, but also plays an important role in the spatial distribution of hydrological variables such as infiltration potential or soil moisture. This can be reflected by parameters like the topographic wetness index (Beven and Kirkby 1979; Sorensen et al. 2006), which interprets the relation between the water that accumulates at any point of a given area and the gravitational force that drives water down slope. The topographic wetness index is calculated as a logarithmic ratio between the catchment area draining into a point of the drainage network and the average gradient. A higher index represents a lower slope and a larger area. Thus, groundwater occurrence and the topographic wetness index are positively correlated (Nampak et al. 2014; Rahmati and Melesse 2016; Misi et al. 2018). Other potentially useful parameters that can be inferred directly from topographic data include slope curvature, erosion indexes and runoff coefficients (Oh et al. 2011; Naghibi et al. 2017; Chen et al. 2018; Singh et al. 2018). Satellite images Rationale and image treatment procedures Information from certain satellite images is classified and stored based on spectral response. Since each object presents a unique set of spectral responses, remote sensing may be used to identify different bodies (rocks, vegetation, roads, water) based on their specific signatures (Gupta 2018). Because each satellite presents a different spectrum of wavelengths, image size, spatial and temporal resolution, and historical records, the value of the data ranges from the local to the global scale, and may (or may not) be usable in studies spanning certain areas and/or periods of time. In this context, the selection of one information source over another may have critical implications on the results. There are currently numerous satellite platforms which provide potentially useful information. These include Landsat 7 and 8, WorldView 4, Pleiades, QuickBird, KompSAT, IKONOS, ALOS or Sentinel 2, among others. Landsat is, however, the most widely used in groundwater studies., which is explained by several factors, including accessibility, long time series, a sufficiently broad wavelength spectrum and accurate spatial and temporal resolution. The most recent satellite in the Landsat program is Landsat 8, launched in 2013. Landsat 8’s Operational Land Imager (OLI) captures spectral responses across nine discrete wavelengths along the electromagnetic spectrum, while its thermal infrared sensor (TIRS) includes two additional bands within the thermal infrared (Table 1; Barsi et al. 2014). Table 1 Landsat 8 bands (after Barsi et al. 2014, NASA 2018a, b). OLI operational land imager, TIRS thermal infrared sensor Full size table Satellite images may be treated to highlight the differences between spectral responses (Gupta 2018). Because images are made up of different wavelengths, their analysis typically seeks to find additional information by decomposing the image in separate bands (Bishop 2018). Common procedures include band composites, band ratios and principal component analyses (Wendt et al. 2016). These methods typically involve some subjectivity and trial-and-error, which means that the skill and experience of the technician may have a strong bearing on the results. Table 2 presents some commonly used composite combinations and band ratios for Landsat 8 images. Table 2 Commonly used Landsat 8 band combinations and ratios (own elaboration from Wendt et al. 2016 and various other sources). Applications may differ from humid to dry climates Full size table Spectral signatures are recorded at the scale of the image resolution (i.e. pixel scale). Since images may cover hundreds or thousands of square kilometres with a very high resolution, the volume of information stored in each one is enormous (Meijerink 2007). For practical purposes, this information typically needs to be clustered, which may be achieved through unsupervised or supervised methods (Elhag 2017; Huang et al. 2018). In an unsupervised classification, in-built algorithms are used to classify the information based on similarities in pixel scores, with no human intervention beyond determining which algorithm to use. In contrast, a supervised classification involves the operator more directly. A number of sample pixels that can be considered representative of the variable at hand (rock, vegetation, etc) are selected based on ground-truth and expert knowledge (Aydav and Mizn 2015; Burton-Johnson et al. 2016). Then these are used as “training sites” for the computer to identify those pixels in the image that present similar properties, usually with some degree of tolerance. As a rule of thumb, supervised classification based on field data is preferable to unsupervised classification; however, unsupervised classification may prove invaluable for initial screening in complex and large areas (Elhag 2017). Applications While satellite surveillance does not penetrate deep into the ground, it does provide useful information as to those features of the landscape that may be associated with shallow groundwater. Vegetation is a classic example. Multispectral imagery at high spatial resolution has been used, for instance, to monitor crop biophysical parameters and water use (Calera et al. 2017). In the context of groundwater potential studies, the presence of vigorous vegetation at the end of the dry season can be interpreted as a proxy for a permanent spring or a shallow water table. Many vegetation-related indices have been proposed over the years, including the ratio vegetation index (RVI), the vegetation index number (VIN), the differenced vegetation index (DVI), and the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI; Bannari et al. 1995; Xie et al. 2008). The latter is perhaps the most widely used, largely due to its ease of calculation and to its sensitivity to temporal changes in vegetation patterns (Xue and Su 2017). NDVI banks on the principle that chlorophyll content generates a highly absorptive response in the visible red, but is reflective in the infrared wavelength. Since live green plants typically appear dark in terms of their photosynthetically active radiation and bright in the infrared, the contrast can be used as an indicator of vegetation status (Xie et al. 2008). NDVI is typically used for the purpose of assessing vegetation vigour. NDVI values range from −1 to +1. Pixel-scale ratings are ultimately dependent on the image, which means that they may fluctuate from one setting to another. However, there is a more or less general consensus that rock and bare soil typically present low positive values, whereas water and snow are in the negative. In contrast, dense vegetation exceeds +0.5, and shrub lands and grasslands result in intermediate positive values. NDVI may be sensitive to variables such as soil brightness, colour, atmosphere and cloud shadows (Xue and Su 2017). Because not all vegetation types present the same spectral signature, vegetation-related indexes may be used to distinguish among plant communities. This can be useful in the context of groundwater studies, where the presence of different species may have practical implications—for instance, the existence of a shallow water table may be inferred from the proliferation of phreatophytes. Halophytic species also point at shallow groundwater, but suggest a high degree of salinity, while xerophytes imply that groundwater is either “deep” or altogether absent (Jha et al. 2007; Jasmin and Mallikarjuna 2011). Other indicators such as evapotranspiration or soil moisture can provide similar information to vegetation (Ndou et al. 2017; Gokool et al. 2018). Due to the thermal inertias of water stored underground, temperature anomalies in land surface may also be used as an indicator of the presence of groundwater. This is particularly true of arid and semiarid environments subject to long dry spells. Cool thermal anomalies have been defined as locations where land surface temperatures are lower than those of surrounding locations under normal conditions. These can be associated with discharge of groundwater through fracture systems, infiltration or groundwater accumulation (Abrams et al. 2018). Whenever dealing with temperature-related variables, care must be taken to discriminate the effects of cloud cover and recent rainfall and runoff, as well as that of shadows and vegetation canopies. Satellite information has also proven useful in delineating rock types in numerous occasions (Simon et al. 2016; Ducart et al. 2016). Wendt et al. (2016) and Gupta (2018) provide an excellent discussion of the most prominent features of major rock types in satellite images, a selection of which is provided in Table 3. While rock type may be inferred from spectral response to some extent, there are mineral components with specific spectral signatures can be common to very different rocks (Meijerink 2007). Moreover, the spectral response of given rock can vary significantly depending on whether it is fresh or weathered; thus, spectral assessment needs to be complemented with other information (DEM, landforms, drainage) for optimal results. Some degree of field work is inevitable to ensure an adequate calibration of the results, but the RS approach can help keep it to a minimum. Classification-wise, a combination of supervised and unsupervised methods is typically appropriate. Image processing techniques such as edge detection methods are sometimes applied on satellite images to detect lineament density (Al Saud 2010; Panahi et al. 2017). Table 3 Characteristics of selected types of rocks as featured in satellite images (after Wendt et al. 2016 and Gupta 2018) Full size table Relevant hydrogeological features might be buried. Radar waves are able to penetrate the ground down to a few meters, although this is strongly dependent on soil moisture. In desert regions, for instance, the space-borne low-frequency synthetic aperture radar (SAR) has proven an invaluable aid in revealing paleo-hydrological and tectonic structures hidden under aeolian sands (Molina et al. 2017). This allows for the delineation of alluvial fans, paleo-channels, paleo-lakes and paleo-shorelines, which may constitute preferential flow paths or reservoirs of groundwater (Sternberg and Paillou 2015). Radar techniques may also contribute to penetrate dense vegetation canopies, thus providing information as to which types or rocks are beneath (Gupta 2018). Borehole and geophysical data The aforementioned sources provide surface-level information, but fail to capture the vertical component of groundwater systems (i.e. depth). Because groundwater is by definition stored underground, borehole and geophysical logs must be sought whenever possible. Borehole logs provide undisputable evidence of the presence (or absence) of groundwater. Borehole databases typically have information on yield, depth and static groundwater level (DNH 2010; DGEP 2016), and may also include pumping test and water quality data, as well as the location and flow rate of springs (Nsiah et al. 2018; Saha et al. 2018). In monotonous settings, consistently high success rates and similar groundwater levels throughout suggest the existence of a regional water table. In contrast, the value of borehole records is limited in highly anisotropic media, where the conditions underground may change significantly over just a few meters. Furthermore, water level/depth data are useful to develop water-table maps in order to determine the main recharge and discharge areas of an aquifer, while lithostratigraphic logs may be used to derive valuable information on aquifer thickness. Joint interpretation of all these variables can render a highly accurate picture of the hydrogeological conditions in the field, thus contributing to the reliability of the end product (Jasrotia et al. 2016; Diaz-Alcaide et al. 2017; Nsiah et al. 2018). Unfortunately, the literature shows that the use of exhaustive borehole databases in groundwater potential studies is relatively uncommon. The next most informative thing to a borehole log is a geophysical log. Geophysical techniques do not directly detect the presence of groundwater, but do provide valuable information about the types of rocks that can be found underground and their properties. Electrical and magnetic surveys are frequently used in the process of siting boreholes, but the outcomes are seldom compiled in comprehensive databases. While there may be exceptions, the use of this kind of information is generally restricted to small-scale applications with an ad-hoc geophysical component (Omosuyi et al. 2013; Akinlalu et al. 2017; Helaly 2017; Bayewu et al. 2018). Data integration and validation Any attempt to map groundwater potential must take into consideration two crucial points: (1) perceptual bias on the part of the operator (i.e. making the map look like “what it should look like” based on personal belief) may have an overly strong bearing on the results; and (2) the outcomes of a groundwater potential map are virtually worthless without ground truth. In this context, both the way data are integrated and the validation procedure are essential to ensure representative outcomes. Data integration procedures Groundwater potential zoning is a classic example of a multi-criteria decision problem (Ahmed et al. 2014), where the likelihood of attaining a target (finding groundwater) is contingent on a variety of factors—soil, lineaments, slope, geology, landforms, lithology, drainage. These sometimes contribute to this intent and sometimes offset each other, which makes the task more complex. The information needs to be integrated meaningfully so that, ultimately, every pixel in the map ends up with a reliable groundwater potential index. In broad terms, there are two major approaches to data integration: expert decision systems and machine-learning methods. Expert decision systems are directly based on human judgement, and include techniques such as simple addition, multi-influence factor techniques or analytical hierarchy processes (Agarwal et al. 2013; Abrams et al. 2018). On the other hand, machine-learning methods comprise a large variety of approaches, including artificial neural network fitting, logistic regression, regression trees, random forest techniques and statistical tree algorithms (Duan et al. 2016; Chen et al. 2018). Generally speaking, machine-learning is less prone to procedural mistakes and perceptual bias, whereas expert methods provide the advantages of relying on a seasoned pair of eyes to discern features that may escape automatic detection. In practice, neither approach can be expected to render better results than the other. Expert decision systems Each information source provides a completely different set of variables. These may be either quantitative or qualitative, and not necessarily measurable in the same units. Hence, a crucial point in groundwater potential studies is data integration. For practical purposes, each pixel within each thematic map needs to be assigned a numerical score, or “weight”, so that map algebra can be performed (Ibrahim-Bathis and Ahmed 2016; Govindaraj et al. 2017). This process necessarily relies on expert judgement to some extent, which means that a certain degree of subjectivity is always involved (Martín-Loeches et al. 2018). The influence of each variable on groundwater potential presents two major components, namely, its comparative and intrinsic weights (Fashae et al. 2014; Das et al. 2017). The comparative weight of a variable represents how important it is in relation to the others, while its intrinsic weighting has to do with how the rating of a given variable is distributed “internally” (Ghodratabadi and Feizi 2015; Dinesan et al. 2015). For instance, under certain circumstances landforms may be deemed more important for groundwater potential than drainage density (Jasrotia et al. 2016), which means landforms will be assigned a greater comparative weight when putting both maps together with the rest. Then, landforms need to be classified into various types (inselbergs, pediments, floodplains), each one of which will receive a different score (intrinsic weighting). The most rudimentary integration technique is simple additive weight, consisting of assigning an equal weight to each variable, assuming the intrinsic weights to be consistent in terms of its importance for groundwater potential. While conceptually straightforward, this approach may render good-quality results if the setting is appropriate., which is demonstrated by the work of Abrams et al. (2018) in Oman and the United Arab Emirates. In this case, expert methods (simple addition, analytical hierarchical processes) were observed to yield better results than machine-learning approaches (probabilistic frequency ratio). The authors attributed this to the limitations of the well dataset to predict groundwater potential in rugged terrain, as well as to the inability of the frequency ratio method to extrapolate groundwater potential beyond the spatial extent of known wells. Multi-influence factor techniques (MIF) rank among the most popular methods to determine the weights of each variable (Magesh et al. 2012; Das et al. 2017; Thapa et al. 2017a, b; Nasir et al. 2018). The underlying principle behind MIF methods is that some of the variables involved may be interdependent, and that those which influence the others the most are those that also influence groundwater potential more strongly. Thus, each variable is compared individually against all others in order to establish a hierarchy—for instance, in crystalline terrains lineaments can be expected to exert a strong influence on the drainage network, but the opposite will not be true. The variable under consideration is assigned a value of 1 if it influences the other one significantly, of 0.5 if it does so in a minor way, and 0 if it does not or if both are unrelated. The comparative scores of the variable under consideration are added together. Then, its comparative weight is calculated as the percentage over the total score of all variables (Manikandan et al. 2014; Thapa et al. 2018). Finally, each variable is reclassed internally for the purpose of computing its intrinsic weights. The maximum intrinsic weight must coincide with the comparative weight of the variable, while the minimum may be zero or even negative. Analytical hierarchy processes (AHP) are closely related to MIF methods (Saaty 2008). Expert-based pairwise combination remains similar, but the scores are normalized to smooth out the subjectivity component and tested for consistency. The final weightings for the thematic layers are the normalized values of the eigenvectors that are associated with the maximum eigenvalues of the ratio matrix (Mohammadi-Behzad et al. 2018). While the calculations are more complex than those involved in MIF, AHP is available in certain software packages, and is also frequently used in the groundwater potential literature (Agarwal et al. 2013; Shekhar and Pandey 2014; Aladejana et al. 2016; Mohammadi-Behzad et al. 2018). AHP is also versatile enough to be integrated with other approaches such as entropy analysis (Al Abadi et al. 2017). Machine-learning methods Machine learning is best described as a set of statistical approaches that focus on revealing hidden patterns in large datasets (Mitchell 1997). In the context of groundwater potential studies, machine-learning helps determine which variables are more closely associated with groundwater based on field evidence. Thus, the rationale behind machine-learning techniques is the opposite to that of manual methods. Based on ground truth (successful drilling spots, borehole yield, groundwater level), the computer examines the spatial relationships between all explanatory variables (geology, landforms, soil, etc.) to determine which ones are most significant (Odzemir 2011a, b; Naghibi et al. 2015). The results can then be used to develop a groundwater potential map. Machine learning methods may be supervised or unsupervised (Hastie et al. 2009). Supervised methods consist in developing an algorithm that relates a series of potentially explanatory variables to a known output. On the other hand, unsupervised machine learning takes place when there are a set of explanatory variables but no known output (i.e. no ground-truth). In the first case, the goal is to predict an outcome, whereas in the second, the aim is to learn more about the internal dependencies among the explanatory variables (Kelleher et al. 2015). Typical examples of supervised approaches include support vector machines, statistical learners and classification trees, whereas unsupervised learning includes clustering and dimensionality reduction (Shalev-Shwartz and Ben-David 2014). Supervised learning is particularly useful in the context of groundwater potential studies. Output-wise, supervised methods are split in two broad categories, namely regression and classification, the main difference being the type of results that can be expected (Hastie et al. 2009). Regression provides outcomes in terms of a continuous quantitative variable (borehole yield, spring flow, groundwater depth), whereas classification approaches are used to determine a series of bivariate or multivariate classes (presence vs absence of groundwater, presence vs absence of spring, low/medium/high groundwater potential). The use of machine-learning methods in the field of groundwater potential mapping is still relatively new. Tested approaches include weights of evidence (Lee et al. 2012; Al Abadi 2015; Madani and Niyazi 2015), probabilistic frequency ratio (Dadgar et al. 2017; Balamurugan et al. 2017; Jothibasu and Anbazhagan 2017; Abrams et al. 2018), logistic regression (Odzemir 2011a, b; Chen et al. 2018), functional tree models (Chen et al. 2018), evidential belief function models (Nampak et al. 2014; Rahmati and Melesse 2016; Mogaji and Lim 2018), or regression trees (Naghibi et al. 2017), among others. Machine learning techniques are inherently complex, which means that predicting whether a method will perform better than another is too complicated a task for the human mind. Thus it is common practice to compare different methods and to either pick the best one or perform an ensemble of the results. The performance of machine-learning methods has been compared in the context of various studies—for instance, Naghibi et al. (2015) evaluated the performance of boosted regression tree, classification and regression tree, and random forest techniques to evaluate spring potential in the Koohrang watershed, Iran. All three models were validated satisfactorily by means of receiver operating characteristics curve methods. The boosted regression model rendered the best results, followed by classification and regression tree and random forest. Odzemir (2011a) carried out a similar exercise in the Sultan Montains, Turkey, where frequency ratio, weight of evidence and logistic regression models were tested. In this case, frequency ratio provided a better fit with observed data then the other two. Finally, Chen et al. (2018) compared ensemble weights of evidence with logistic regression and functional tree models to map spring potential in the Ningtiaota region, China, obtaining the better results with the latter. Map validation Al Saud (2010) provides a brief overview of about 20 groundwater potential studies carried out between the 1960s and 2008, including the authors’ self-assessments. Unsatisfactory results were found in the earlier period, outcomes becoming increasingly more reliable from the 1980s. This can be partially explained by the increasing resolution of remote sensing information, as well as to a growing number of variables being taken into consideration. Indeed, earlier works were typically based on one or two potentially meaningful parameters (lineaments, landforms), whereas the modern literature on average relies on no less than six or seven (Fig. 1). In practice, the only way to ensure that a groundwater potential map is actually representative is to validate it against field data. There are two approaches to validating a groundwater potential map, both of which are contingent on the quality and spatial distribution of borehole and/or spring data. The first one consists in checking the results against a sufficiently broad field dataset. Experience shows that the type of validation data will typically depend on what is available, rather than on the preferences of the operator. Thus, borehole success, pumping test or spring discharge data rank among the most sought-after validation sources (Agarwal et al. 2013; Gumma and Pavelic 2013; Agarwal and Garg 2016; Tahmassebipoor et al. 2016; Ahmed and Sajjad 2018). This is because these not only provide useful information as to the presence of groundwater, but also as of its suitability for different uses. In this context, validation procedures include comparison of the number of positive boreholes per potential zoning, well yield vs groundwater potential index, and receiver operating characteristic curves (Al Abadi 2015; Naghibi et al. 2015). In studies dealing with groundwater occurrence or storage potential, however, validating on groundwater depth/level may also be satisfactory (Kumar et al. 2014; Madani and Niyazi 2015; Nasir et al. 2018). The second procedure is self-validation. Self-validation is achieved by using exhaustive borehole data in the process of developing the map (Diaz-Alcaide et al. 2017; Nsiah et al. 2018). Self-validated maps may include variables such as well yield, transmissivity, groundwater level or spring discharge, alongside remote sensing information and hydrogeomorphological cartography. By its own nature, self-validation can only be carried out in regions with a sufficiently well-developed knowledge base. Mixed validation approaches based on splitting the field database into “training”, “validation” and “test” datasets are often implemented in the context of machine-learning applications (Odzemir 2011a, b; Oh et al. 2011; Chen et al. 2018). Discussion A groundwater potential map serves the purpose of delineating those areas that may be more favourable for groundwater development within a given geographical setting. While developing a reliable groundwater potential map requires advanced notions of geology, hydrogeology and satellite science, the final outcomes are typically presented in visually appealing fashion, so that they can be interpreted by anybody (Bagyaraj et al. 2012). This has some inherent dangers, for the complexities and uncertainties of groundwater exploration are ultimately lost in a dimensionless colour scale ranging from “very low” to “very high”. As a result, groundwater potential maps have a natural tendency to replace reality in the eyes of stakeholders and decision-makers, which implies that care must be taken to ensure that end-users understand the pitfalls. Attractive maps can be developed with relatively little data. Looking at the end product, however, there is no telling as to how comprehensive the mapping process or the datasets were. In this context, quality assurance is a major issue. Remarkably, however, a major drawback in groundwater potential studies is the absence of validation. Out of the 200-odd cases studies analysed in this research, over 70% did not present a robust validation mechanism. Of course, this cannot always be attributed to methodological flaw. The absence of validation is acceptable in preliminary studies. Take for instance those carried out in isolated regions, where there may be little or no hydrogeological knowledge prior to the development of the map. In such cases, groundwater potential maps are best interpreted as estimates pending on confirmation (Al Shaheeb et al. 2018; Mogaji and Lim 2018). An important factor determining the reliability of a groundwater potential map is the quality and scale of the underlying datasets. Figure 1 provides an overview as to how various authors approached the issue of groundwater potential mapping in a wide variety of regions. As shown, the number of parameters involved in each study ranges from just four or five to over 10 or 12. Because of the inherent uncertainties of groundwater prospect, the availability of as much information as possible is generally desirable. The literature also shows that the resolution of the input data used in groundwater potential studies tends to be highly variable. More specifically, combining fine and coarse resolution information is common practice, as is the reclassification of explanatory variables (Manap et al. 2013, Bashe 2017, Dasho et al. 2017, Chaudhary and Kumar 2017, Jahan et al. 2018). This kind of simplification is often inevitable, even necessary in certain cases. However, it is only adequate if the map is to be used at the regional extent, as local inaccuracies can be expected to arise from mixing different scales. In such cases, groundwater potential maps should be interpreted as a tool to optimize the amount of field work involved, rather than as a low-cost substitute for local-scale surveys (Abdalla 2012; Mohammadi et al. 2014; Mandal et al. 2016). This is particularly relevant, for instance when siting boreholes for rural water supplies or humanitarian emergencies. Furthermore, field datasets sometimes provide spatially biased information, with significant amounts of data in some regions and virtually none in others (Diaz-Alcaide et al. 2017). As voids are typically left for automated interpolation to fill, this may lead to spurious results. In other words, this suggests that a study with a large number of low-quality variables or very disperse information may render a less accurate picture of a given region than another one using fewer parameters with very high resolution. Groundwater is context sensitive. A low-permeability formation may be considered an aquifer in a certain region because there is nothing else available, but may be disregarded in a neighbouring context where more permeable rocks occur. Moreover, flat areas with poorly developed drainage networks may be more prone to groundwater occurrence than hilly regions (Haghizadeh et al. 2017; Martín-Loeches et al. 2018). In other words, the explanatory variables and the likelihood of groundwater occurrence must be determined based on the specific features of each setting. This explains why there is no universal scale of groundwater potentiality. Attempts have been made to standardize scores at the national scale; take for instance the cases of Burkina Faso, Uganda and New Zealand (DEP 1993; MWE 2012; Tschritter et al. 2017). Such efforts make sense in national contexts because they allow managers to compare groundwater potential across more or less similar regions, but may become impractical at the continental or global scales due to the variability of geographical, geological and climatic contexts. On a final note, there may be some margin to extend the number of variables involved in RS-based groundwater exploration. Since the vast majority of the literature deals with dry and tropical climates, the existing approaches are heavily geared towards these geographical domains. This is reasonable in view of the distribution of the world’s population. However, from a methodological standpoint, it also means that the role of certain variables that could be relevant in colder settings such as snow-related factors, has seldom been discussed (Han and Nelson 2015). Conclusions This paper has provided an updated overview of groundwater potential methods based on a thorough review of the more recent literature. The large number of academic papers published in the last decade attests both to the practical value of the technique and to the need to improve our knowledge of groundwater resources in a rapidly changing world. Groundwater potential mapping is time- and cost-effective, and provides a practical way to integrate multiple data sources to delineate those areas which are more favourable for groundwater development. This represents a particularly important advantage in remote regions, where obtaining exhaustive field work may be impossible. However, groundwater potential maps cannot be interpreted as a low-cost substitute for field surveys, as there are many aspects of groundwater occurrence that are not easily captured on cartographic support. Due to the widespread availability of RS/GIS technologies, as well as to the relatively small number of parameters involved, developing a groundwater potential map today is well within the reach of most hydrogeologists. Unfortunately, however, only a minority of the groundwater potential maps found in the literature have been adequately checked against ground truth. In this context, the main challenge ahead lies in developing high-quality maps that may be used to inform water policy. Because this should be preferably done in the context of validated outcomes, it is contended that academic groundwater potential studies should always be labelled either as “preliminary” or “validated”, in order to prevent misinterpretations. Furthermore, it may often make sense to refer groundwater potential maps to the use for which they have been developed. This is because different uses (i.e. drinking, irrigation) present different water quantity and quality requirements. From the methodological standpoint, the advent of machine-learning techniques represents an exciting development for the near future. In particular, the potential advantages of combining human experience with such approaches are enormous. In the authors’ view, this can only result in more accurate mapping as these become increasingly widespread.

Although many business enterprises have adopted sustainability goals, the actual development of sustainable systems remains challenging because of the broad range of economic, environmental and social factors that need to be considered across the system life cycle. Traditional systems engineering practices try to anticipate and resist disruptions but may be vulnerable to unforeseen factors. An alternative is to design systems with inherent “resilience” by taking advantage of fundamental properties such as diversity, efficiency, adaptability, and cohesion. Previous work on sustainable design has focused largely upon ecological efficiency improvements. For example, companies have found that reducing material and energy intensity and converting wastes into valuable secondary products creates value for shareholders as well as for society at large. To encourage broader systems thinking, a design protocol is presented that involves the following steps:  identifying system function and boundaries, establishing requirements, selecting appropriate technologies, developing a system design, evaluating anticipated performance, and devising a practical means for system deployment. The approach encourages explicit consideration of resilience in both engineered systems and the larger systems in which they are embedded.

Connected, distributed systems, from power grids to business firms to even entire economies, are both more fragile and more robust than populations of isolated entities. Duncan J. Watts ( 1) Overview ARTICLE SECTIONSJump To We live in a small world of ever-increasing connectivity, with both cooperation and conflict occurring on a global scale. Individuals, companies, and communities are linked through worldwide systems of communication, transportation, and commerce. Similarly, individual products and services are linked to the global value chains in which they are created, delivered, and used. This connectivity presents daunting challenges to the design and commercialization of new systems. Instead of focusing purely on the function and form of a product or service, design teams today must consider a broad range of system-level issues, including safety, security, manufacturability, serviceability, material and energy ef ficiency, end-of-life recovery, environmental emissions, and even long-term impacts upon quality of life for future generations ( 2). In the face of such complexity, traditional methods for analyzing costs, benefits, and risks can become overwhelm ing. Instead, it is helpful to delve more deeply into the fundamental properties of successful systems in the biologi cal, social, and commercial arenas. What do such systems have in common? They are complex, adaptive, and unpredictable. They exhibit self-organizing behavior that enables continuity in response to external stress. They can survive unexpected disruptions, although they can also fail catastrophically. Likewise, engineered systems cannot be designed to anticipate all future possibilities, as evidenced most recently by the Columbia shuttle disaster and the Northeast electrical power blackout of 2003. Nevertheless, engineered systems can be endowed with intrinsic characteristics that improve their robustness and adaptability. This paper considers how an industrial enterprise can work toward sustainability by adopting a fresh perspective based on systems thinking. The concept of “resilience”, borrowed from the field of ecology, enables sustainability to be viewed as an inherent system property rather than an abstract goal. Already, existing design practices have demonstrated many useful techniques for enhancing system resilience. Building on these insights, a generalized approach to sustainable systems design is presented, including explicit consideration of system boundary conditions and external impacts. Toward Sustainable Systems ARTICLE SECTIONSJump To In industries ranging from resource extraction (e.g., petroleum, lumber) to conversion and processing (e.g., chemicals, electric power) to consumer goods (e.g., packaged foods, electronics), shareholders and analysts have become sensitized to a company's ecological and social “footprint”, including global issues such as climate change and poverty. Many leading corporations have adopted the concept of sustainable development ( 3), recognizing that environmental protection and social responsibility are important to both shareholders and other stakeholders ( 4). Yet, despite their heightened awareness and commitment, most companies have found it difficult to translate broad goals and policies into day-to-day decision-making. There are several barriers that limit the practical applica tion of sustainable development principles. For one thing, the notion of protecting future generations seems remote in the face of contemporary business pressures. The concept of “sustainability” is often associated with resource constraints and maintenance of status quo rather than with opportunities for continued innovation, growth, and prosperity. In addition, the popular metaphor of the “triple bottom line” ( 5) seems to imply that economic profits need to be “balanced” against environmental and social benefits, whereas in truth these three aspects of corporate performance are inseparable and contribute synergistically to shareholder value ( 6). Finally, sustainability is often misinterpreted as a goal to which we should collectively aspire. In fact, sustain ability is not an end state that we can reach; rather, it is a characteristic of a dynamic, evolving system. And systems thinking offers a potential means to overcome the above barriers. Alternative definitions of sustainability abound, but for system design purposes the following definition is useful:  A product, process, or service contributes to sustainability if it constrains environmental resource consumption and waste generation to an acceptable ( 7) level, supports the satisfaction of important human needs, and provides enduring economic value to the business enterprise ( 8). Note that a product cannot be sustainable in an absolute sense; rather, it must be considered in the context of the supply chain, the market, and the natural environment. Therefore, the key practical challenge of sustainable design is to understand how products, processes, and services interact with these broader systems. As illustrated in Figure 1, full exploration of this question would extend beyond the enterprise, even beyond the conventional “product life cycle”, to the underlying economic flows as well as ecosystem services derived from “natural capital” ( 9). How, then, does one establish realistic boundaries for system design? Figure 1 Extending the boundaries of system design ( 8). The challenge of boundary definition is evident in a “sustainable mobility” study being conducted by an international group of automotive and energy companies working with the World Business Council for Sustainable Develop ment. Their goal is for humans to “move freely, gain access, communicate, trade and establish relationships without sacrificing other essential human or ecological values, today or in the future” ( 10). A key issue is how future transportation technologies and demand patterns will evolve, together with their supporting infrastructures (e.g., adoption of hydrogen fuel cells for automotive vehicles will require development of a new refueling network). The infrastructure question is especially challenging since it encompasses roads, railways, airports, intermodal freight terminals, and maintenance and guidance systems. Ultimately, the evolution of mobility systems will be influenced by urban and regional planning policies as well as competing supply chain management strategies. The vast scope of these interlocking systems is bewildering for any business enterprise seeking to develop a sustainable business strategy for mobility-related products and services. What Is a Sustainable Enterprise? ARTICLE SECTIONSJump To During the 1990s, Royal Dutch Shell conducted a historical study of corporations in an effort to understand what drives corporate longevity ( 11). They found that the average life expectancy of large corporations worldwide was less than 50 yearsin effect, most companies die prematurely. Furthermore, they identified four factors that distinguished long-lived companies: (i) sensitivity and adaptability to the business environment (ii) cohesion and sense of identity (iii) tolerance of diversity (decentralization) (iv) conservative use of capital Profitability was conspicuously absent from this list and was considered to be an outcome rather than a predictor of longevitymany companies have delivered spectacular profits for short periods of time and then vanished abruptly. From this study emerged the notion that the real purpose of a corporation is to learn, grow, and survive in the long run and that a corporation is best understood as a living organism rather than as a machine engineered to deliver profits. More recently, a decade-long study of 160 companies indicated that the main determinants of superior financial performance were not technology-based but rather were organic system traitsan achievement-oriented culture, a flexible and responsive structure, a clear and focused strategy, and flawless execution ( 12). Moreover, the enterprise system needs to encourage recognition that the future may not resemble the past since individuals often tend to cling to the familiar status quo ( 13). This organic view of the corporation is consistent with an emerging recognition by the business community of “intangible” value drivers. Company characteristics such as human capital, innovation, alliances, and brand equity are increasingly viewed as leading indicators of shareholder value ( 14). Moreover, paying attention to social and environmental performance strengthens many of these intangibles, including reputation, stakeholder relationships, employee pride, ef ficient technology, and license to operate. In short, an enterprise that contributes to sustainable development enhances its own sustainability as a business. Unfortunately, the term sustainability has become both ambiguous and laden with ethical connotations. The following definitions offer a logical framework of “nested” systems that may be helpful to system designers. (i) A sustainable society is one that continues to satisfy the current needs of its population without compromising quality of life for future generations. (ii) A sustainable enterprise is one that continues to grow and adapt in order to meet the needs and expectations of its shareholders and stakeholders. (The enterprise system is a component of the overall socio-economic system.) (iii) A sustainable product (or service) is one that continues, possibly with design modifications, to meet the needs of its producers, distributors, and customers. (The product system is a component of the overall enterprise system.) The above definitions imply that social responsibility is a characteristic of the enterprise, not of the product or service, and requires continuous adaptation to ensure transparency and responsiveness to the changing needs of stakeholders. Ecological integrity and quality of life, however, are often influenced by characteristics of a product or service and thus can be addressed through sustainable design principles. Finally, sustainable development, in the sense of addressing the needs of future generations, can only be addressed meaningfully at the level of a collective society. Individual products or enterprises cannot be deemed sustainable in isolation, although they can make important contributions to the fulfillment of specific human needs. Nor can corpora tions alone be held accountable for sustainable developmentsupply and demand are coupled. Achieving a sustainable society will require cooperative efforts among industry, government, and public interest groups to ensure not only sustainable production systems but also sustainable consumption patterns on the part of individuals and institutions ( 15). In effect, product/service systems are the offspring of corporations and acquire important characteristics from their “parents” including branding, technology, distribution chan nels, and stakeholder perception. Today, corporations are increasingly expected to disclose the origins of products, including raw materials, and the conditions under which they were manufactured. Do they employ forced labor or child labor? Do they utilize recycled material content or renewable energy? Were chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) used in the manufacturing process? Do they contain genetically engineered constituents? As we broaden the scope of product/service design, we inevitably begin to consider the higher-order characteristics of the systems in which they are embedded. Resilience and Sustainability ARTICLE SECTIONSJump To Systems theory is the study of how complex entities interact openly with their environments and evolve continually by acquiring new, “emergent” properties ( 16). Rather than reducing an entity (e.g., the human body) to the properties of its parts or elements (e.g., organs or cells), systems theory focuses on the relationships (e.g., feedback loops) between the parts that connect them into a whole. It turns out that many system properties are independent of the concrete substance of their elements (e.g. particles, cells, transistors, people). Complex systems are generally dynamic, nonlinear, and capable of self-organization to sustain their existence. For example, by pollinating flowers, bees create a feedback loop that reinforces the production of nectar. Similarly, by supporting social and philanthropic activities, corporations strengthen the vitality of the communities to which their employees belong. By the laws of thermodynamics, closed systems will gradually decay from order into chaos, tending toward maximum entropy. However, living systems are “open” in the sense that they continually draw upon external sources of energy and maintain a stable state of low entropy that is far from thermodynamic equilibrium ( 17). Perhaps the essence of sustainability is resilience, the ability to resist disorder ( 18). Figure 2 provides a simplified illustration of thermodynamic changes that characterize different types of resilience. Each system has a stable state representing the lowest potential energy at which it maintains order, and each is subject to perturbations that shift it along a trajectory of adjacent states. Figure 2 Examples of system behavior. (i) System a is typical of engineered, highly controlled systems. It operates within a narrow band of possible states and is designed to resist perturbations from its equilibrium state. It recovers rapidly from small perturbations, but it may not survive a large perturbation. We call this a resistant system. (ii) System b is typical of social and ecological systems. It can function across a broad spectrum of possible states and gradually tends to return to its equilibrium state. Through adaptation and evolution, it is capable of surviving large perturbations. We call this a resilient system. (iii) System c is even more resilient than system b in that it can tolerate larger perturbations. Under certain conditions it may shift to a different equilibrium state, representing a fundamental change in its structure and/or function. The contrast between resistant and resilient systems is exemplified by China and India, both sophisticated civiliza tions that have flourished for centuries. Whereas China has tended to resist foreign influences and preserve homogeneity of language and religion, India has accepted and integrated foreign influences into a diverse tapestry of religious and cultural variants. The concept of resilience and its applicability to ecological, social, and management systems has been investigated extensively by an international group of researchers led by two noted ecologists, Lance Gunderson and C. S. Holling. They have developed a general theory of adaptive cycles, arguing that all systems exhibit similar patterns of slow accumulation of resources, increasing connectedness, and decreasing resilience, punctuated by periods of crisis, transformation, and renewal ( 19). Based on an understanding of these patterns, humans may be able to intervene in appropriate ways that take advantage of the system dynamics rather than merely resisting change. Applying Resilience to System Design ARTICLE SECTIONSJump To The design of engineered systems, including both hardware and software, has been approached traditionally as a process of hierarchical decomposition (i.e., the overall system func tion and architecture are developed first and then the systems and subsystems are designed accordingly). Complex, hierarchically organized systems (e.g., aircraft, nuclear plants) tend to have rigid operating parameters, are resistant to stress only within narrow boundaries, and may be vulnerable to small, unforeseen perturbations. Alternatively, distributed systems composed of independent yet interactive elements may deliver equivalent or better functionality with greater resilience. For example: (i) A collection of distributed electric generators (e.g., fuel cells) connected to a power grid may be more reliable and fault-tolerant than a central power station. (ii) A swarm of miniature unmanned surveillance drones may be less costly and more robust than a single conventional surveillance aircraft. (iii) A network of autonomous software agents operating asynchronously may be more effective and speedier than a monolithic software program. (iv) A geographically dispersed workforce linked by telecommunications may be less vulnerable to catastrophic events that could destroy a single facility. While such distributed systems may not always represent a superior solution, they typify a novel approach to systems engineering, sometimes called “biomimicry”, that more closely resembles the patterns seen in living systems ( 20). In addition to mimicking nature, system designers need to be aware of their impacts upon nature. It is often said that “nature is resilient”. Some argue that we should not impose unreasonable regulatory burdens upon industrial activities since we cannot predict their impacts upon complex ecosystems. Indeed, many regulatory restrictions are based on admittedly inadequate methodologies, such as the models used for extrapolating from laboratory studies to predict human cancer incidence due to chemical exposures. These models use “conservative” assumptions intended to overstate the true risk. In some cases, this precautionary approach may impose economic burdens that distort the economy. In other cases, the models fail to account for phenomena such as multi-pollutant synergies and may actually understate the risk. Similarly, the worldwide elimination of CFCs was undertaken without a clear understanding of the their impacts upon atmospheric ozone. Scientists may never be able to predict accurately the impacts of perturbations upon biological or ecological systems. The emergent properties of open systems give them the capacity to tolerate perturbations and to evolve into new, unimagined forms. However, it is possible to explore the properties of both natural and engineered systems that make them more or less resilient. As shown in Table 1, there are several key characteristics of living systems that can also be extended to industrial systems. For example, it is commonly argued among ecologists that a decrease in biodiversity will tend to reduce ecosystem stability ( 21). As mentioned earlier, a similar observation was made in the Shell study of corporate longevitya decrease in managerial diversity reduces a company's ability to survive upheavals.

These characteristics are as follows: (i) Diversityexistence of multiple forms and behaviors; (ii) Efficiencyperformance with modest resource consumption; (iii) Adaptabilityflexibility to change in response to new pressures; (iv) Cohesionexistence of unifying forces or linkages. An understanding of system resilience becomes important when significant disruptions or discontinuities occur that shift the system away from its current equilibrium state. Such disruptions could include the introduction of new technolo gies, the emergence of new regulatory and market forces, or changes in the availability of resources. For example, will the broad introduction of low-cost electronic devices in developing nations create an excessive flow of post-consumer wastes, and how will local governments respond? Some believe that emerging sustainability issues will catalyze innovations that will change the basis of competition in many industries ( 22). Those that wish to reap the benefits of these changes must also be alert to the riskscomplex systems may be vulnerable to small, unforeseen perturbations that cause catastrophic failures. Already, practitioners of enterprise risk management are beginning to adopt resilience concepts as a way to “withstand systemic discontinuities and adapt to new risk environments” ( 23). There are numerous instances of system design practices that have contributed to sustainability improvements, especially with regard to ecological issues. For example: (i) Sustainable Building Systems. Many architects and engineers have embraced the concepts of “green” or sustainable buildings. According to the U.S. Department of Energy, buildings consume about 33% of all the energy used in the United States and 66% of all electricity, thus accounting for about 35% of all carbon dioxide emissions ( 24). Examples of sustainable design practices include energy efficiency, use of local materials, respect for natural surroundings, utilization of ecological services (e.g., heating and cooling), and sensitivity to human well-being ( 25). Apart from the obvious energy and environmental benefits, studies suggest that sustainable buildings also improve employee satisfaction and productivity ( 26). The LEED protocol, developed by the U.S. Green Building Council, is widely used to evaluate environmental performance from a “whole building” perspective over a building's life cycle. At a higher system level, a number of academic and research institutions, such as University of California at Berkeley, have developed plans and guidelines for sustainable campuses. (ii) Sustainable Process Systems. Over the past decade, the field of process systems engineering has gradually expanded from a traditional focus on process technology and economics to incorporate sustainability issues such as process safety and environmental emissions ( 27). The synergy between process performance and sustainability is well captured in the concept of eco-efficiency, which measures the value produced as output per unit of resource input ( 28). Reductions in labor intensity, energy consumption, process hazards, and waste generation tend to translate into lower capital requirements, lower economic risks, and lower operating and maintenance costs. New technologies such as process intensification and microreactors have demonstrated the potential for order of magnitude increases in process yield and capital productivity. At the same time, significant advances have occurred in the field of green chemistry, also known as sustainable chemistry, which seeks new pathways and catalysts for environmentally benign chemical synthesis and processing ( 29). For example, Dow Chemical and other companies are using novel processing methods to convert renewable biomass (e.g., soybeans, corn, cellulose) into useful materials such as adhesives and plasticizers. (iii) Sustainable Supply Chain Systems. Products such as automobiles and computers, which involve a series of discrete manufacturing and assembly processes along the supply chain, can generate a significant ecological footprint in terms of material, energy, and land use as well as industrial wastes and emissions. Manufacturers such as General Motors and HP have utilized a variety of “design for environment” techniques ( 30) to reduce the resource intensity of their manufacturing and logistical systems. These techniques include simplifying product architecture to reduce the number of distinct parts and assembly operations (which also enables easier maintenance and disassembly); utilizing recycled materials or refurbished components; avoiding substances with undesirable properties such as carcinogenicity, toxicity, flammability, ozone depletion, or environmental persistence; reducing electrical and thermal energy use through process modifications or transportation ef ficiency (e.g., improved product geometry for pallet loading); utilizing quality improvement and “lean” manufacturing techniques (e.g., just-in-time inventory replenishment) to reduce work-in-process and scrap; and collaborating with customers and suppliers to streamline the supply chain and minimize waste. (iv) Sustainable Product Life Cycle Systems. Some companies have begun to look beyond the supply chain that they control and consider the full life cycles of their products and services, including resource extraction, procurement, transportation, manufacturing, product use, service, and end-of-life disposition or asset recovery (see Figure 1). For example, BASF Corp. has adopted a new eco-efficiency analysis tool to help identify products and processes that consume less energy and generate less waste than alternatives while maintaining or improving the products' commercial value ( 31). The tool has been applied to over 100 different products and processes such as asphalt microsurfacing, nylon fiber, building materials, automotive coatings, plastics, and adhesives. The resulting analyses have influenced BASF business decisions regarding capital investments, production techniques, acquisitions, and product positioning. BASF's methodology combines assessment of life cycle ecological impacts (including raw material and energy consumption, air and water emissions, and potential health risks) with an economic analysis of life cycle costs. Economic and ecological data are then plotted on a graph, revealing the eco-efficiency of a product or process as compared to competing products and processes. (v) Sustainable Industrial Networks. Companies working in isolation may achieve incremental improvements in addressing sustainability issues; however, a more powerful approach is for companies to collectively optimize their activities as part of an industrial ecology network. Stated simply, industrial ecology is a framework for transforming industrial systems from a linear model to a closed-loop model that resembles the cyclical flows of ecosystems, in which one creature's waste becomes another creature's nutrients ( 32). Rather than exporting industrial and consumer wastes for disposition outside the system, industrial ecology suggests elimination of the very concept of waste by designing innovative pathways for conversion of wastes into useful byproducts. The scope of the “system” then encompasses all participating companies as well as the natural environment in which they operate. Simple examples are common:  cement manufacturers incinerate contaminated wastes in cement kilns as a substitute for fossil fuel, effectively reducing global warming emissions; electric utilities recycle fly ash from their boilers for blending into cement and capture waste heat for local applications; electronic equipment recyclers recover parts and materials from discarded devices and recycle them into a variety of secondary uses. A more advanced example of industrial ecology is a complex at Kalundborg, Denmark, where “symbiotic” relationships have developed among several large facilities and a host of smaller ones. The main partners are a coal-fired power plant, a refinery, a plasterboard factory, and a pharmaceutical and enzyme plant operated by Novo Nordisk ( 33). The main focus of the above design efforts has been upon a particular system characteristicecological efficiency. It is likely that companies will discover additional opportunities for value creation by expanding their scope to include other dimensions of Table 1 (i.e., finding ways to enhance the diversity, adaptability, and cohesion of engineered systems and the related systems with which they interact). A Generalized Approach to Sustainable System Design ARTICLE SECTIONSJump To Among the vast range of systems that we encounter, there are many well-bounded systems that are truly “designed”. Clothing, appliances, aircraft, and buildings, for example, are designed and then manufactured or assembled through a rigorously controlled series of processes. On the other hand, we participate in social and ecological systems that are not at all designed; yet we can still design policies and interven tions that influence the system behavior and evolution. The latter case typifies virtually all of our environmental protection effortswe introduce changes such as soil remediation, pollution reduction, reforestation, or streamflow diversion in an effort to enhance the health of the overall ecosystem. Controlled design is the dominant focus of the product and process development community, and companies have made huge investments in design technology in order to improve the creativity, quality, and speed of system development. For example, the system acquisition processes utilized by the U.S. Department of Defense (DoD) engage dozens of organizations in a controlled design effort that encompasses the full life cycle of military systems. Inevitably, such efforts turn out to have unforeseen, inadvertent impacts upon related systems. For example, the DoD is currently examining the sustainability of domestic artillery test ranges in terms of their impacts upon surrounding communities, an issue that was overlooked for many years. The unforeseen secondary impacts of system design may be trivial or profound. For example, in the case of automotive design: (i) A structural design change that improves vehicle performance may have virtually no significant secondary impacts; (ii) A change in the materials of construction may have substantial impacts on economic and ecological systems within the manufacturer's supply chain; (iii) A new engine design may have not only supply chain impacts but also economic, environmental and social impacts that affect entire markets. Thus, certain design decisions may constitute interven tions in broader systems. From this perspective, “green engineering” and “design for environment” are efforts to anticipate and consider broader ecological system impacts within a controlled design process. More generally, “design for sustainability” represents an effort to consider both environmental and socio-economic systems. We cannot design a perfect natural environment or an ideal society, but we can try to modify the controllable characteristics of our designed artifacts (e.g., factories, products) in ways that create environmental and social benefits. Individual companies, especially market leaders, can exert powerful influences through such system interventions. Regulatory agencies can also exert powerful influences, but a more promising approach is collaborative partnerships whereby industry, government, and other interested parties jointly design interventions for the benefit of society. Without such partnerships, well-intentioned efforts may go awry; for example, airborne emissions might merely be shifted to waterborne effluents elsewhere in the supply chain, or the distribution of risks and benefits among workers and consumers might be inequitable. Perhaps the most ambitious example of collective system intervention is the worldwide effort to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. To encourage systems design that incorporates sustain ability thinking explicitly, it is useful to have a systematic protocol. Consideration of related (parent or sibling) systems and their resilience can be accomplished through an expan sion of existing design protocols, as illustrated in Figure 3. At one extreme, if there are no important interactions anticipated with related systems, the protocol reduces to a standard “stage-gate” development process, commonly used in industry. At the other extreme, the external interactions may be so significant that the majority of the design effort is spent trying to understand related systems, including impacts and boundary constraints. Each of the steps in Figure 3 is described below. Figure 3 Expanded design protocol including system considerations. Defining System Function and Boundaries ARTICLE SECTIONSJump To The sustainable mobility problem mentioned at the begin ning of this paper illustrates the difficulty of establishing the scope for a system design effort. Every open system interacts with its environment and, hence, is part of a larger system. Carried to the extreme, this type of reasoning leads to the “Gaia hypothesis”, which claims that the world is a single giant organism ( 34). This is not a very helpful perspective if one is trying to design an electronic appliance. However, a more practical application of systems thinking is to consider the related systems in which a design artifact is embeddedliterally thinking outside the box. This may lead to surprising innovations. For example, the development of a telephone-answering device might be seen from several alternative related system perspectives: (i) It is part of a home system from the consumer use perspective and can become a network appliance as well a communication device. (ii) It is part of a material flow system from a supply chain perspective and can become a source of reusable components at end-of-life. (iii) It is an enabling technology from a developing economy perspective and can serve as an element of an entrepreneurial communication service business. It follows that one of the most important steps in system design is establishing a clear, practical definition of the function and boundaries of “the system”. For example, are we creating a voice recording device, a telephone-answering system, or a voice mail service? Are we designing a physical device, a human interface, or a total solution delivery system? Depending on the system scope, the design methodology and technological options can vary greatly. A common way to define systems, for purposes of customer value analysis and life cycle analysis of competing designs, is in terms of a unit of functional value. In the above example, the functional unit chosen might be a “message capture event” including both recording and playback. Then alternative designs could be analyzed in terms of cost, reliability, ease of use, and resource efficiency per message capture event. A good illustration of how system boundaries become broadened is in the field of industrial carpeting, which surprisingly has become a hotbed of sustainable design. Collins & Aikman Floorcoverings (now part of Tandus Group) has developed a closed-loop recovery process whereby customers return their carpet with assurance that 100% of it will be recycled into new carpet. Another industry leader, Interface, has pledged to offset the greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from its floorcovering products with investments in GHG reduction projects such as installing energy-efficient boilers and lighting in public schools or planting trees that absorb greenhouse gases. Developing System Requirements ARTICLE SECTIONSJump To In systems engineering, requirements definition and management has traditionally focused on observable product characteristics such as cost, structure (e.g., size, geometry), and functional performance. A requirement can be defined as a set of testable conditions applicable to products or processes ( 35). The conditions may be represented in various forms, ranging from qualitative statements (e.g., “system shall shut down when left idle”) to quantitative metrics (e.g., power rating). Testing of requirements typically involves some human interpretation, and the broader the scope of the system, the more difficult it becomes to apply definitive tests. The requirements management process generally consists of three main functions that are performed in an iterative fashion: (i) Requirements analysis involves interpreting customer needs and deriving explicit, verifiable requirements. (ii) Requirements tracking involves analysis of design tradeoffs, including project risk, schedule, cost constraints, and performance goals. A traceability hierarchy is frequently used to keep track of changes in system and subsystem requirements. (iii) Requirements verification involves determining whether a system design will meet the specified requirements. The earlier verification can be performed, the more likely it is that gaps or flaws will be detected before a large investment is made. To incorporate sustainability issues, as shown in Figure 3, system requirements definition should take into account the boundary conditions derived from related systems. This may require thinking beyond the usual supply chain considerations to consider the broader industrial and social context. For example, recent European Union directives are requiring both electronics and automotive manufacturers to take responsibility for end-of-life vehicle recovery, stimulating reconsideration of the design assumptions for systems and their components. Another recent trend is the interest of multi-national companies such as Dow, HP, and Procter & Gamble in addressing the large, heretofore untapped markets at the bottom of the economic pyramid ( 36). They have found that designing products as well as marketing and distribution systems to serve low-income populations in developing nations requires a deep understanding of local conditions, resources, and behavior patterns. For example, in India, consumables such as detergent can now be purchased in one-cent single-serving pouches made of biodegradable plastic. The life cycle issues that need to be emphasized in requirements definition vary greatly across different industries. Natural resource extraction industries such as mining, oil production, agriculture, and forest products might emphasize appropriate land use, ecosystem protection, and worker safety. Industries farther downstream in the supply chain such as petroleum refining, metals, chemicals, and electric utilities might emphasize process safety, conversion efficiency, and waste minimization. Industries close to the end-customer such as food and beverage, pharmaceuticals, automotive, and electronics might emphasize environmentally conscious packaging (for consumable products), end-of-life recovery (for durable products), and responsiveness to social needs. Finally, service industries such as transportation, communication, and retailing might emphasize efficient logistics, product certification (e.g., lumber), and human resource development. To develop sustainability requirements, it is helpful to consider a “mental map” of human needs, presented in Figure 4. Basic survival needs are associated with the physical realm, while higher-order needs are associated with the socio-economic realm. These two realms are closely intertwined, with energy needs playing a pivotal rolein fact, energy is the one essential input for all living systems. The current status of these needs, including significant gaps, may provide boundary conditions for system design; for example, in a region with severe water shortages, industrial depletion of water should be avoided. Practically speaking, the needs of society must be clarified and prioritized through stakeholder engagement, including a dialogue among corporations, government policy-makers, and public interest groups. Thus, there is no universal set of performance conditions that defines sustainability, even within a particular industry. Figure 4 present and future human needs. This ambiguity may be perplexing to a system designer accustomed to having performance-based requirements. For example, one might intuitively believe that a “zero-emission” factory was a worthwhile goal. Yet the technologies required to reduce plant emissions to zero might be both complex and costly. Instead, a combination of throughput reduction and partial conversion of wastes to useful byproducts might result in a superior environmental profile for the larger economic system in which the plant operates. Furthermore, a business strategy that encourages diversity in adjacent industrial development might create additional markets for waste materials. Selecting Technologies and Creating a Design ARTICLE SECTIONSJump To Recent innovations in genomics, materials science, nanosystems, and information technology can contribute directly to sustainability by increasing the efficiency and adaptability of existing products and processes. For example, increased use of electronic communication and information storage may reduce the need for physical transportation and record-keeping, although we have yet to achieve a “paperless office”. DuPont, for one, encourages its businesses to substitute intellectual capital for physical capital by measuring product performance in terms of shareholder value per pound of product sold. However, there are hidden tradeoffs to consider. Systems that are smaller, faster, cheaper, and more flexible may actually have a larger environmental footprint than their bulkier, slower predecessors. In the semiconductor industry, for example, the precision manufacture of a tiny microchip consumes large amounts of energy and materials ( 37). Nanosystem production may prove even more resource-intensive, and some scientists are concerned about the potential hazards associated with inhalation of nanoparticles. Due to such system-level considerations, no technology can be deemed intrinsically sustainable. Renewable or bio-based materials are not necessarily preferable to inorganic materials. Recycled materials are not necessarily preferable to virgin materials. Biodegradable materials are not necessarily preferable to durable materials since industrial ecology networks may recycle spent materials into new applications. It all depends on the system boundaries and requirements. The system design process itself is undergoing consider able evolution ( 38). Traditional, hierarchical design has proved cumbersome and “brittle” in the sense that a single deviation can disrupt the entire process. Many organizations are experimenting with new techniques such as cooperative, distributed, asynchronous design. Again, this approach is patterned after the self-organizing behavior of living systems. Through advanced communication and groupware technologies, design teams can be distributed geographically and share their ideas and progress via interactive computer displays. For design of complex systems, the ability to iterate rapidly is especially important since design teams need to assess the robustness of alternative designs under a variety of different scenarios and assumptions. In the automotive industry, for example, it is common for the major automakers to co-locate design engineers from their principal “Tier 1” suppliers together with their in-house design teams, enabling a tightly integrated development process. As mentioned earlier, the design of sustainable systems may benefit from including requirements that address inherent resilience. Characteristics such as diversity and adaptability may not have an obvious relationship to system performance but may contribute to the system's longevity and ultimate success. For example, vehicle designers have increasingly stressed adaptability issues such as reliability and maintainability under extreme conditions, which influ ence both life cycle performance and cost of ownership. Sometimes the greatest resilience is achieved through design simplicity, which reduces the chances of unexpected failure or disruption. Evaluating System Performance ARTICLE SECTIONSJump To A key part of any iterative system development effort is evaluating the anticipated performance of a partially or fully completed design. In many industries this evaluation process is supported by automated tools, known as computer-aided design and manufacture (CAD/CAM), which can perform highly detailed simulations before the system is ever built. Boeing, for example, has honed this approach to the point that its engineers can design a complete aircraft without ever physically building and testing a prototype. However, as the design focus shifts from form and function to the impact on related systems, the evaluation task becomes immensely more challenging. Theoretical computer simula tions can be performed to model interventions in biological organisms, ecosystems, or socio-economic systems, but we can seldom ensure their validity. One alternative approach is life-cycle assessment, a systematic method for identifying and quantifying the environmental burdens associated with the life cycle of a product or process ( 39). The approach has also been extended to support life cycle cost accounting ( 40). A life cycle inventory can be used to profile the system-wide energy and material consumption and waste generation in terms of flows per functional unit. Life cycle impact assessment attempts to evaluate the actual significance of these flows in terms of human effects and ecosystem perturbations, although uncertainties abound. Despite data quality issues, life cycle methods can be useful for relative comparisons of alternative system design options, thus supporting business decisions. Other evaluation methods include integrative modeling approaches such as systems dynamics that attempt to characterize system behavior and anticipate potential evolutionary paths ( 41). For example, recent applications of generalized economic equilibrium models have been helpful in projecting the impacts of different energy technologies upon global climate change ( 42). However, such models cannot be predictive in the classical sense and are often controversial. Recognizing the scientific challenges of integrated system evaluation, the National Science Foundation has initiated a program in biocomplexity, which addresses “the dynamic web of often surprising interrelationships that arise when components of the global ecosystembiological, physical, chemical, and the human dimensioninteract” ( 43). The needed linkages among the natural, social, and mathematical science disciplines are still at an embryonic stage. The usual objective of system evaluation is to quantify selected performance indicators that portray the consequences of design choices. Although integrated modeling is not always feasible, the identification of such indicators can be extremely helpful. Even in the absence of quantitative models, it may be possible to develop subjective or qualitative assessments of the directional impacts on key indicators. Table 2 provides example of sustainability indicators that have commonly been used to characterize the performance outcomes of system design or system intervention ( 44). The Global Reporting Initiative has developed a more exhaustive catalog of performance indicators as part of its guideline for sustainability reporting ( 45). Table 2.  Examples of Conventional Sustainability Performance Indicators economic environmental societal direct material consumption quality of life raw material costs product & packaging mass breadth of product or service labor costs useful product lifetime availability capital costs hazardous materials used knowledge enhancement operating costs eco-efficiency employee satisfaction potentially hidden energy consumption peace of mind recycling revenue life cycle energy perceived risk product disposition cost power use in operation community trust contingent local impacts illness & disease reduction employee injury cost product recyclability illnesses avoided customer warranty cost runoff to surface water mortality reduction relationship regional impacts safety improvement customer retention smog creation lost-time injuries business interruption due acid rain precursors reportable releases to stakeholder interventions biodiversity reduction number of incidents externalities global impacts health & wellness ecosystem productivity loss global warming emissions nutritional value provided resource depletion ozone depletion subsistence costs As discussed earlier, it is important to assess not only performance outcomes but also the intrinsic characteristics that contribute to system resilience. Recent studies of energy flows in ecological and industrial systems suggest that new, more elegant, sustainability indicators may be developed based on thermodynamic analysis. For example, it has been conjectured that systems with lower entropy (i.e., higher degree of order) will have a larger life cycle impact on their surroundings ( 46). Calculation of exergy (useful energy) appears to offer a promising method for comparative assessment of the ecological efficiency associated with industrial processes ( 47). Planning System Deployment ARTICLE SECTIONSJump To The final step in system design is the development of a plan for the release, introduction, and deployment of the system. In the past, product development teams often released their specifications to the manufacturing organization without considering downstream issues associated with component procurement, product distribution, customer support, maintenance, waste disposition, and potential upgrades of the original design. The introduction of “simultaneous engineer ing” methods and more rigorous stage-gate reviews has helped to shift these considerations back into the design process, thus avoiding delays and unnecessary costs. However, the question of broader system impacts is still poorly understood, and it is rare for design teams to consider them explicitly. Companies wishing to pursue sustainable system design have a strong motivation to consider the broad implications of an innovative system upon all of the enterprise stakehold ers. Each stakeholder group will be touched by the system in different ways and will have their own particular expecta tions. For example, employees expect the system to be safe and easy to operate. Shareholders expect the system to streamline existing operations and provide an improved return on an investment. Customers expect efficacy and convenience. Public interest organizations expect environmental and social benefits. To understand and manage all of these expectations, it is critical for the company to engage with its stakeholders, understand their concerns, and develop mutual trust so that the system can be introduced success fully. Indeed, the design team should begin considering the deployment phase as early as possible. The importance of stakeholder engagement is evident in the life sciences field, where companies are developing a host of biotechnology-based products that they claim will enable a shift to sustainable agriculture. One class of these new agricultural products is genetically engineered pest-resistant crops. Proponents claim that this technology will reduce pesticide use, increase agricultural productivity, and lower consumer costs, while opponents are concerned about unforeseen health and environmental impacts ( 48). An open dialogue among interested parties is necessary to establish agreement on the value of these products and the appropriate technical, legal, and ethical conditions for their use. History has shown that it is wise for designers to consider not only the product technology but also the socio-economic system into which it will be introduced. The need to consider the broader systems context is especially great in developing nations, where agriculture is often central to the indigenous culture. An example is wet rice cultivation in Bali, Indonesia, whose hills are covered with graceful, terraced rice paddies. The rural Balinese lifestyle represents a harmonious equilibrium between society and nature that has persisted for centuries. Rice has long been the island's most important crop and is deeply embedded in the Balinese social structure. Village life centers around a rice growing association called a subak, which organizes community work on irrigation and cultivation systems. Festivals and religious rituals are intertwined with the rice planting, growing, and harvesting seasons. Thus, no matter how promising a new technology may be, any effort to modify the practice of rice growing must begin with a thorough understanding of the ecological and social boundary condi tions ( 49). Conclusion ARTICLE SECTIONSJump To This paper has provided but a glimpse of the challenges encountered as system design moves from the bounded, controllable scope of traditional products and services to the boundaryless, unpredictable realm of industrial, ecologi cal, and social systems. The increasing connectedness of these systems creates new opportunities but also exposes society to greater risks. Economic threats such as the collapse of markets, political threats such as military aggression, biological threats such as mutant viruses, or ecological threats such as global warming have become the concern of all nations. Moreover, system complexity keeps increasingserious proposals are being raised for development of sustainable systems on a much larger scale, such as entire cities or regions ( 50). The classic reductionist tools that served so well in a simpler age are no longer adequate. Complex, nonlinear systems cannot be modeled by linking together a fragmented collection of linear models. What is needed is a new language and new metaphors to describe the relation ships and dynamic behaviors that characterize these exquisitely complex systemsa new, multi-disciplinary toolkit that begins with connectivity and integration as fundamental themes rather than afterthoughts. Einstein reputedly said, “Individuality is an illusion created by skin”. Indeed, separateness is a convenient assumption that enables the analysis of objects, people, or companies as if they were independent of their surroundings. However, in practice, this assumption is invalid. System design should proceed with a constant awareness of related systems, boundary conditions, external effects, and potential feedback loops. As design teams continually expand the system boundary, they will need to address new technical challenges in creative ways, for example: (i) Requirements will include system behaviors rather than just outcomes; (ii) Predictive modeling will give way to exploratory scenario building; (iii) Design strategies will rely upon intervention rather than control; (iv) Robustness will be achieved through resilience rather than resistance; (v) Risk management will draw upon new concepts such as adaptivity and diversity; (vi) System state indicators will be based on fundamental energy attributes. The resilience perspective has important implications for companies that wish to become more sustainable. It is not sufficient for a company to redesign only those systems that it fully controls. At best, this will result in incremental changes that do no harm but do not create substantial benefits either for the enterprise or for society. Instead, companies that wish to ensure their long-term resilience must reach beyond their own boundaries, develop an understanding of the intricate systems in which they participate, and strive for continuous innovation and renewal. In this broader playing field, the rules are different:  Strategic adaptation becomes more important than strategic planning, and decision makers need to embrace uncertainty rather than trying to eliminate it. As stated in a recent Harvard Business Review article: Any company that can make sense of its environment, generate strategic options, and re-align its resources faster than its rivals will enjoy a decisive advantage. This is the essence of resilience ( 51). The history of technological progress has emphasized the conquest of nature, using brute force and standardization to overcome nature's infinite diversity ( 52). Today, scientists and engineers are learning from nature, discovering patterns that they can apply for the benefit of both humans and the environment. In business as in science, the old Newtonian view of an orderly, machine-like world is giving way to a new view of a chaotic, evolving world. Designing systems that are inherently resilient will support our collective quest for sustainability in this ever-changing, unpredictable universe.

Verburg, e-mail: Peter.verburg@ivm.vu.nl SECTIONS PDF TOOLS SHARE Abstract Land use and land cover data play a central role in climate change assessments. These data originate from different sources and inventory techniques. Each source of land use/cover data has its own domain of applicability and quality standards. Often data are selected without explicitly considering the suitability of the data for the specific application, the bias originating from data inventory and aggregation, and the effects of the uncertainty in the data on the results of the assessment. Uncertainties due to data selection and handling can be in the same order of magnitude as uncertainties related to the representation of the processes under investigation. While acknowledging the differences in data sources and the causes of inconsistencies, several methods have been developed to optimally extract information from the data and document the uncertainties. These methods include data integration, improved validation techniques and harmonization of classification systems. Based on the data needs of global change studies and the data availability, recommendations are formulated aimed at optimal use of current data and focused efforts for additional data collection. These include: improved documentation using classification systems for land use/cover data; careful selection of data given the specific application and the use of appropriate scaling and aggregation methods. In addition, the data availability may be improved by the combination of different data sources to optimize information content while collection of additional data must focus on validation of available data sets and improved coverage of regions and land cover types with a high level of uncertainty. Specific attention in data collection should be given to the representation of land management (systems) and mosaic landscapes. Introduction Land use and land cover change are one of the prime driving forces of changes in the Earth system and climate in particular. Agricultural land uses are estimated to contribute to changes in atmospheric concentrations of greenhouse gases (GHG): non-CO2 GHG account for 10–12% of the total global anthropogenic emissions. At the same time, agricultural lands generate large CO2 fluxes both to and from the atmosphere, but the net flux is small. The expansion of cropland and pastures at the cost of forests results in an increase in atmospheric CO2. This decreases the sink capacity of the global terrestrial biosphere, and thereby may amplify the atmospheric CO2 rise. Apart from managed lands, large sources and sinks of GHGs are found in natural land cover types: wetlands are a well-known source of methane emissions (Hines et al., 2008; Kayranli et al., 2010) and much research focuses on the consequences of global change on emissions from arctic and boreal ecosystems (Chapin et al., 2000). Besides the impact of land cover change on GHG emissions, more subtle changes in land management and land use practices can have important consequences. Differences in forest management are likely to influence carbon emissions or sequestration in different ways (Schulp et al., 2008b) while agricultural management effects carbon sequestration and GHG emissions (Dendoncker et al., 2004). Methane emissions from rice fields are highly dependent on water management (Verburg & Denier van der Gon, 2001) and rice variety choice (Denier van der Gon et al., 2002). Land use and land cover change not only impacts GHG emissions but also land surface properties of relevance to climate. At the global scale, changes in land surface properties associated with changes in vegetation can have impacts on continental and global atmospheric circulation, with possible large impacts on regional and continental climate (Pielke et al., 1998; Chapin et al., 2000). Impacts of land use/cover change upon climate include remote impacts upon local circulation regimes often labeled as land use driven ‘teleconnections’ because effects are communicated to regions distant from the actual changes in surface characteristics (Eastman et al., 2001). The impact of land use and land cover change on climate change is mostly studied from the perspective of land use/cover change as a driver of climate change (Schulp et al., 2008a). However, in many cases the interrelations are more complex. Land use/cover change can also be induced by climatic changes. Droughts have strong effects on vegetation and may increase the risk of forest fires. Climate change may also make areas more or less suitable for certain land use management practices leading to changes in land use decisions. Multidirectional impacts may be linked through feedbacks that strengthen or attenuate the interaction between land use/cover change and climate change (Verburg, 2006). Such feedbacks make it difficult to distinguish impacts from drivers (Bossel, 1999). Large-scale deforestation changes climate conditions and, hence, influences vegetation patterns and occurrence of forest fires. These may affect land requirements and reclamation potential (Nepstad et al., 2001; Foley et al., 2003; Carvalho et al., 2004). A feedback that deserves special attention is the adaptation of land management in response to climate change. Adaptation aims at reducing the potential negative consequences of climate change through adapting management practices in such a way that they anticipate the changed climatic conditions. Adaptation may include a wide variety of measures (Aerts, 2005; EEA, 2008). These include spatial planning measures, for example to restrict new residential locations in areas with high flooding risk, the use of improved crop varieties that are better adapted to the changed climatic conditions, resource management and diversification (Polsky & Easterling III, 2001). Finally, the emerging incentives for reducing emissions from deforestation and forest degradation (REDD) require high quality monitoring of forest dynamics directly related to land use change (Eva et al., 2010). Given the very central role of land use/cover change almost all assessments related to climate change somehow make use of data on land use/cover. These data may originate from different sources and inventory techniques. Each source of land use/cover data has its own domain of applicability and quality standards. In many studies, no specific attention is given to the quality and content of these data. This paper reviews the use of land use/cover data in climate studies and aims at identifying critical issues related to the use of land use/cover data in climate assessments. Based on an inventory of data sources, the domain of applicability and the constraints of particular data sets are discussed (‘Inventory of data types on land use/cover’). An inventory of large uncertainties and inconsistencies in land use/cover data that may have critical implications for climate change assessments is provided in ‘Consistency issues of land use and land cover data’ whereas ‘Methods and opportunities to deal with data inconsistencies’ discusses several methods and techniques that may reduce such errors and inconsistencies. The implications for global change assessments and integrated assessment models are described in ‘Implications for global change analysis and modelling’. The paper concludes with a list of the main findings and recommendations. Inventory of data types on land use/cover Sources for land use/cover data The most common source of data on land cover is remote sensing. Remotely sensed data include information gathered by aerial photography and satellites. Solar radiation (or in case of radar actively emitted radiation) is reflected from the surface of the earth – from soil, water, vegetation and building – to sensors that measure the intensity of different frequencies. Each type of surface reflects or absorbs different frequencies. Based on these measurements, it is possible to make inferences about the earth surface. The reflection is related to the cover of the earth surface which not always reveals the intended use of the land. However, land cover in combination with the spatial structures and additional attributes may allow, to some extent, to derive land use. Park & Stenstrom (2008) subdivide urban land cover derived from remote sensing data into several land use classes based on the dominant use of the area. They indicate that high accuracies in classifying different types of urban land use can be achieved. For the interpretation of remote sensing imagery, a wide range of methods exists ranging from fully automated, to semiautomated, to pure interpretation (Richards & Jia, 2006). Fully automated approaches, i.e. direct processing of image data using models or other techniques, have the advantage of fast processing allowing high temporal resolution and replication which is especially useful in monitoring rapid deforestation (Asner et al., 2009). Supervised techniques and visual interpretation allow the integration of expert-knowledge, field observations and pattern recognition (Sirén & Brondizio, 2009), but also introduce an element of subjectivity making the interpretations dependent on the observer (Foody, 2002). This may cause problems in replication and therefore change detection. Another commonly used source of land use/cover data are surveys and census data. Many countries and international agencies collect statistical information on land use. Agricultural land use types are often reported as part of an agricultural census. Besides cropping areas such information often also includes management information such as irrigation, fertilizer application rates and crop yields. Similarly, forestry statistics may provide information about management practices. Therefore, census information is highly suitable to provide land use information which can never be collected through remote sensing. However, most census information is focused on economic sectors and information on (semi-)natural land uses is often not included. In addition, data are often aggregated to the level of administrative units while the original data are not available as result of privacy legislation (Sabor et al., 2007). Besides remote sensing and census information other, but less frequently used, sources of land use/cover data include maps based on field surveys, participatory maps (Rambaldi et al., 2007) and cadastral information (Aspinall, 2004). An overview of the characteristics of different sources of land use/cover data is given in Table 1. Table 1. Overview of the spatial, temporal and thematic properties of various sources of land-use and land cover data Data source Spatial resolution Spatial extent Temporal resolution Temporal extent Thematic properties Remote sensing/ Aerial photography Dependent on sensor (remote sensing mostly between 0.6 m and 1 km) Dependent on sensor. Coverage is limited in case of clouds (not for radar) Frequent depending on sensor/satellite Depending on launching and life time of sensor. Few remote sensing data are available before 1970s except for aerial photographs Land cover classes. Classification is based on sensor characteristics and user preferences Census/ survey data Administrative units Often national level Infrequent depending on census, often less than every 10 years Country specific depending on statistical system Focus on economic sectors (mostly agriculture and forestry) Land-use maps based on field survey Dependent on scale of mapping (often between 1 : 25  000 and 1 : 1 million Varying Often made for 1 year only – Varying and fixed within a specific map Participatory maps Dependent on scale of mapping Often restricted to territory of one or more communities For one moment only Participatory back casting possible Depending on purpose of mapping Cadastral information Precise information at property level Dependent on cadastral system Continuously updated Often available for long time period Limited to tenure conditions with limited information about land use, especially in urban environments Applicability domains It is important to notice that the different sources of data have clearly different possible applications. High-resolution remote sensing data, for example from IKONOS and Quickbird, provide detailed land cover information and the possibility to infer land use information. However, acquisition and interpretation of such data is only feasible for relatively small areas and may be very costly. Therefore, global land cover data sets based on remote sensing data are using medium to coarse resolution sensors, e.g. in case of the GLC2000 dataset (http://www-tem.jrc.it/glc2000/) use was made of SPOT images (1 km resolution) while the recent GLOBCOVER data (http://ionia1.esrin.esa.int/index.asp) are based on MERIS images from ENVISAT with a spatial resolution of 300 m. The differences between sensors and the spatial resolution have an impact on the representation of landscapes and the thematic information that can be derived. In many land cover data sets, each pixel is classified as one specific land cover type. When land cover types mainly occur in small patches the occurrence of these land cover types may be underestimated because they will not dominate the reflectance characteristics of the pixel. Moody & Woodcock (1994) show that large proportion errors can arise as landscapes are represented at increasingly coarse scales. Therefore, the appropriate spatial resolution of the sensor may depend on the landscape under analysis (Ozdogan & Woodcock, 2006). Various methods are developed to correct, to some extent, for this aggregation problem either through statistical techniques (Moody & Woodcock, 1994; Marceau & Hay, 1999) or through unmixing of the spectral information in the pixel during the interpretation and reporting of the fractional coverage of each land cover within the pixel. Whereas the discussion on spatial resolution effect is mostly concerned with raster data a similar effect can be found in polygon representations of land use data. An important generalization mechanism inherent to polygon maps is the minimum mapping unit (MMU), i.e. the minimum size that a land unit must exceed in order to be represented in the map. Land units smaller than the MMU are simply not represented. This may result in an overrepresentation of the land cover/use types that occur in larger units. An exception is the case of mosaic polygons, which have a compound label representing a mosaic of patches from different classes, all smaller than the MMU. In this kind of polygons, the percentage cover from each class may be reported, but information regarding their actual distribution within the polygon is missing (Castilla & Hay, 2007). Besides spatial scale, temporal scale is also important. Survey and census data tend to be infrequent and sampling schemes and definitions change between surveys. Remote sensing data offer the best possibility to monitor changes in land cover through time. However, time series based on remote sensing tend to suffer from inconsistencies due to improved resolution of sensors and changes in classification schemes. Moreover, accuracies of classification are often around 80% while change in land cover over the period analyzed is often small. Therefore, temporal consistency needs be ensured by focusing on change in the spectral information rather than providing two individual interpretations for the different years (Hansen et al., 2008; Berberoglu & Akin, 2009). Furthermore, cloud cover may cause problems in large parts of the humid tropics during a considerable part of the year (Ju & Roy, 2008). Radar images may overcome these problems to some extent (DeFries, 2008; Freitas et al., 2008). Consistency issues of land use and land cover data Similar studies conducted in different regions and at different times often use different sources of data, which hinders a comparison between them. In addition, researchers may choose from different sources of land use/cover data that contain different information. Comparison and integration of different data sources is hampered by different issues including: • difference between land cover and land use; • temporal consistency; • spatial consistency and scaling bias; • thematic differences and inconsistencies. The following paragraphs will discuss the underlying reasons for consistency problems in more detail and provide a number of illustrations. Temporal consistency issues For monitoring and analysis of change in land use/cover, it is essential to have consistent data over a longer period of time. Preferably, these are derived from exactly the same data source with applying the same processing techniques. However, often this is not possible. Because technology, science and policy objectives are continuously changing, repeated natural resource inventories rarely employ the same methods as in previous surveys (Wadsworth et al., 2008). The production of spatial data sets from remote sensing has often been driven by short-term funding and specific information requirements by the funding agencies. As a result, a wide variety of data sets exist that were generated using different atmospheric classification algorithms, land cover classes, training sites, map projections and spatial resolutions. Remote sensing sensors have changed in time and interpretation techniques have become more advanced. Furthermore, many interpretations of remote sensing data include a ‘supervised’ component in which classification decisions and generalizations are made by an expert. This is not necessarily the same person as the one that has processed the data for an earlier year. Also survey methods and inventory techniques may change in time, including classification systems, legend classes and spatial detail. When analyzing time series of data, it is important to distinguish changes caused by inconsistencies between the data sets and the ‘real’ changes. In practice, these are often difficult to separate and it is likely that the land use/cover change reports from such exercises over- or underestimates the ‘real’ change. Spatial consistency issues Spatial inconsistencies between data sources may be related to positional errors caused by georeferencing of remote sensing data or the level of generalization of a vector map (Castilla & Hay, 2007). If georeferencing is appropriately done such inconsistencies are small as compared with inconsistencies as result of differences in spatial scale and aggregation. Nol et al. (2008) compare a series of land cover data from different sources available for the fen meadow landscape in Western Netherlands (Fig. 1). The landscape is dominated by grassland with a large number of small, linear, water bodies (ditches). The less detailed data do not represent the linear figures of the landscape and grassland cover dominates in the coarse scale data sets. These differences have large consequences for the land use statistics that can be derived from the data. In the field mapping grassland only covers 77% of the area and water covers 11%. The CLC2000 map classifies 100% of the area as grassland. Such differences have large impact on the estimation of GHG emissions given the large differences in emissions of nitrous oxide and methane from grassland and water bodies. Figure 1 Open in figure viewer PowerPoint Representations of polder Zegveld using different land cover databases. Comparable findings were reported by Fassnacht et al. (2006) who found the class ‘broadleaf trees,’ which forms narrow linear features along rivers in the landscape studied, to be particularly susceptible to changes in resolution. Ozdogan & Woodcock (2006) also noted that large landscape elements can support large pixels, but when the landscape elements of interest are small, fine resolution is needed to correctly estimate surface areas. In many landscapes, linear or other small land cover types have important impacts on the functioning of the hydrological and climatic system (Ellis et al. 2009). Spatial inconsistencies may also originate from improper aggregation of the data to the level of analysis. The level of aggregation and the aggregation method are extremely important determinants of the resulting land use distributions and spatial configurations. Dendoncker et al. (2008) compared differences in landscape composition and configuration between three aggregation methods and three spatial resolutions. Differences between aggregation results were found to be at least as large as the differences between the results of widely diverging scenarios of land use change. This study, as well as a similar study by Schmit et al. (2006) demonstrated that both the rasterizing method and the level of aggregation can become important sources of uncertainty. The spatial bias introduced by aggregation is strongly dependent on the landscape type and level of analysis. In most studies related to climate change aggregation methods are arbitrarily chosen as a result of the software used and hardly ever reported. Thematic differences and inconsistencies Different data sources have different capacities in capturing specific land use/cover types given the characteristics of the observation technique. Each data source will therefore lead to specific categorical uncertainties in the final land use/cover data. Categorical uncertainty is commonly assessed using a contingency table of agreement between predicted and observed values, typically referred to as the confusion matrix (Castilla & Hay, 2007). Comparison and assessment of different data sources for the same area has shown that some land use/cover types, independent of the data source, are easier to delineate than other land use/cover types. For an area in Germany, Bach et al. (2006) compared the performance of three different data sets on land use/cover with accurate field information. The results showed that the congruency of the land use classes forest, urban and traffic areas are higher than the congruency of the land use classes of the open land (arable land, pastures and meadows, fallow). A similar conclusion was reached by an analysis of global land cover maps at 1 km spatial resolution by Herold et al. (2008). The authors harmonized the thematic legends of four available global land cover maps (IGBP DISCover, UMD, MODIS 1 km and GLC2000), which have arisen from different initiatives and are based on different remote sensing data and used different methodologies. Analysis of the agreement among the global land cover maps and existing validation information highlights general patterns of agreement, inconsistencies and uncertainties. The thematic classes of evergreen broadleaf trees, snow and ice and barren show high accuracy and good agreement among the data sets. The classes of mixed tree types show high inconsistency. Overall, the results show a limited ability of the four global products to discriminate mixed classes characterized by a mosaic of trees, shrubs and herbaceous vegetation. There is a strong relationship between class accuracy, spatial agreement among the data sets and the heterogeneity of landscapes. In another comparison between different data sets for Europe, Neumann et al. (2007) identify that comparison of different data sets using a similar legend is hampered by differences in the thematic content of the classes between maps. Interpreters have often used dissimilar definitions of land use/cover classes and used different aggregation schemes. Differences in thematic content are also a direct result of the specific purpose for which a data set was constructed. A wide range of definitions are used for the same land cover class between different data sets and inventories. Wadsworth et al. (2008) shows [based on an inventory of Lund (2004)] that official definitions of forest include the full range of canopy cover between 10% and 80%. Estimates of the Earth's land surface covered by rangelands vary even more and range from 18% to 80% of the earth surface (Lund, 2007). This wide range of variation is due to differences in definitions used but also due to different estimates of the land surface (inclusive or exclusive ice covered surface, etc.) and data source. Large inconsistencies in the definition of rangelands are also a result of the lack of an international organization responsible for the assessment and reporting on the world's rangelands as there is for the periodic global forest assessments by the Food and Agricultural Organization of the United Nations (FAO) (Lund, 2007; Grainger, 2008). The classification of rangelands is especially troublesome in case of sparse tree cover, such as in savannahs. If separate definitions of forest and rangeland are used that are not mutually exclusive there is a risk of double-counting or underestimating the respective areas with major implications for the assessments based on these numbers. Land cover vs. land use An important issue underlying differences in area reported is the distinction between land use and land cover. Several studies have identified the relation of land cover and land use as one of the major challenges for monitoring, modelling and communicating land change (Comber, 2008; Verburg et al., 2009). Land cover addresses the layer of soils and biomass, including natural vegetation, crops and human structures that cover the land surface. Land use in contrast refers to the purposes for which humans exploit the land cover (Fresco, 1994; McConnell & Moran, 2001). Land use is not always easily observable, although, in many cases, land use may be inferred from observable activities (e.g., grazing) or structural elements in the landscape (e.g., the presence of logging roads). An example of the potential effects of the differences between the land cover and land use definition is the documentation of land abandonment. While agricultural statistics indicate in Europe a strong decreases of agricultural areas these are, in many cases, not observed in data derived from remote sensing. One of the reasons for not being able to observe the ongoing process of agricultural abandonment by remote sensing is the use of ‘abandoned’ grasslands for other functions, for example horse keeping. Although the land cover in these areas remains the same the changing land use has large implications for the functioning of the land and the rural economy. Because in many countries hobby-horses are not included in agricultural statistics the extent and areas used for this type of land use are largely unknown. Many authors have also reported large declines of agricultural areas in Europe's mountain areas (MacDonald et al., 2000; Etienne et al., 2003; Tasser et al., 2007). These mountain areas are facing two related trajectories of change: part of the meadows are more intensively used, while other parts have been converted to pasture or have been abandoned (Mottet et al., 2006). These changes in intensity and the actual use of the grasslands, either for pasture or hay-making is not observable by remote-sensing leading to a discrepancy with agricultural statistics. Methods and opportunities to deal with data inconsistencies The differences and inconsistencies between data set have been acknowledged by several researchers. Different methods are proposed to deal with these inconsistencies and make optimal use of the available data. This section will discuss a number of methods for data integration and data management that acknowledge the complementarities and inconsistencies of the different land use/cover data. Integrating remote sensing and census data Many land cover/use data sets combine (sub-)national census data with remote sensing information (Table 2). Ramankutty et al. (2008) assume that the inventory data represent the ‘true’ areas of agricultural land (except for identified outliers), while satellite data are used to spatially disaggregate these inventory data within each administrative unit. This way the strength of the ground observations is combined with the high spatial detail of remote sensing data. However, the use of inventories from various, national level censuses causes a risk for the use of inconsistent definitions of the agricultural land use classes between countries leading to a globally inconsistent map.

(2001) combined land use statistics and remote sensing data to generate a land use map for the United States, Cardille & Foley (2003) combined remote sensing and census data to estimate land cover change in the Brazilian Amazon and Pelorosso et al. (2009) used a similar combination to detect land use changes for a small area in Central Italy. While many of the data sets listed in Table 2 focus on agricultural land, a number of other studies have focused on preparing data sets for urban areas. Although urban areas only cover relatively small areas at a global scale they may have a large impact on (local) climate. For such data sets census data are combined with remote sensing data, often complemented with imagery of nighttime lights as an indicator of urban activity (Schneider et al., 2009). For climate change studies, the history of land cover change is also interesting. Several attempts have been made to reconstruct historic land use based on sparse data of human population, potential vegetation, old topographic maps and model assumptions. Based on such data, authors prepared global land cover reconstructions (Ramankutty & Foley, 1999; Klein Goldewijk, 2001; Wang et al., 2006; Pongratz et al., 2008). Ruddiman & Ellis (2009) have used explorations of land use change during the Holocene to explain historic trends in atmospheric CO2 concentration and have thus been able to better understand the role of land use change on historic climate changes. Techniques for integration of different remote sensing data Combining different existing land cover data sets into one consistent database has the risk of inconsistent use of information and unknown sources of uncertainty. Alternative methods have been presented that use primary data from different sensors through equalizing thematic and spatial content of the data or through change detection techniques. Other methods explore the information contained in data inconsistencies to detect land cover changes. Petit & Lambin (2001) present a methodology to integrate multisource remote sensing data into a homogeneous time series of land cover maps for change detection. The authors developed a method to increase the comparability between land cover maps coming from panchromatic aerial photographs and SPOT XS (multispectral) data by equalizing their levels of thematic content and spatial detail. By controlling successively the parameters that influence the level of map generalization, the equalization of the thematic content and of the level of spatial detail of the two land cover maps can be significantly improved. Postclassification comparison is the most common method to detect land cover changes between two images, i.e. the change is identified based on a comparison of the interpreted land cover maps of time 1 and time 2. However, the accuracy of this change detection technique is only as good as the result of the multiplication of the accuracies of each individual classification. Studies have identified image differencing as being the most accurate change detection technique (Macleod & Congalton, 1998; Ridd & Liu, 1998; Petit et al., 2001). The difference between two images is calculated by finding the difference between each pixel in each image, and generating an image based on the result. This method avoids the detection of change as result of differences in interpretation of the individual images. For detection of deforestation over larger areas, Hansen et al. (2008, 2009) have proposed the use of a combination of easily available images with coarse spatial resolution and high-resolution images for sample areas used to calibrate the information of the coarse resolution images. By using this combination of different image types, the method allows for fast monitoring of tropical deforestation across large areas such as the Brazilian Amazon and Indonesia. Wadsworth et al. (2008) present a method utilizing aspects of quantified conceptual overlaps and semantic-statistical approaches (Comber et al. 2005). The method is applied to reconcile three independent land cover maps of Siberia, which differ in the number and types of classes, spatial resolution, acquisition date, sensor used and purpose. A map of inconsistency scores is presented that identifies areas of most likely land cover change based on the maximum inconsistency between the maps. The method of quantified conceptual overlaps was used to identify regions where further investigations on the causes of the observed inconsistencies seem warranted. The method highlights the value of assessing change between inconsistent spatial data sets, provided that the inconsistency is adequately considered. A common approach to address the problem of classification uncertainty in remote sensing and GIS data is fuzzy logic (Woodcock & Gopal, 2000; Robinson, 2003; Fritz & See, 2005). Jung et al. (2006) present a straightforward method that merges existing land cover data sets into a desired classification legend for a specific application. This process follows the idea of convergence of evidence and generates a ‘best-estimate’ data set using fuzzy agreement. The authors apply the method to develop a new joint 1 km global land cover product (SYNMAP) with improved characteristics for land cover parameterization of the carbon cycle models. The overall advantage of the SYNMAP legend is that all classes are properly defined in terms of plant functional type mixtures, which can be remotely sensed and include the definitions of leaf type and longevity for each class with a tree component. See & Fritz (2006) have used fuzzy logic to incorporate expert knowledge for comparing the GLC2000 and the MODIS land cover product. To capture classification uncertainties of both data sources the authors mapped spatial disagreement by using a combination of fuzzy logic and expert knowledge. Fuzzy membership matrices were generated based on knowledge of classification experts to indicate the different levels of difficulty in classifying different land cover types and to map spatial disagreement. The areas of highest disagreement were validated using additional land cover information and a hybrid land cover map was generated by fusion of the GLC2000 and the MODIS land cover product. For local scale applications, Alfieri et al. (2007) propose a reclassification method to better assign the various parameters needed for land surface model simulations in a case study in south-eastern Kansas, USA. Besides land use/land cover data sets normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) measurements, elevation and slope are used to provide a more accurate data set. Standardization and harmonization of land cover data Instead of dealing with limited compatibility and comparability of existing land cover data sets and their thematic legends others have aimed at improving the flexibility and usability of land cover data to avoid a translation of different classification systems and to allow for comparability of different data sets (Neumann et al., 2007). International initiatives, such as the Group on Earth Observation (GEO), the Global Terrestrial Observing System (GTOS), and the Global Observation of Forest and Land Cover Dynamics (GOFC–GOLD), foster the establishment of international standards and protocols with respect to standardized development and harmonization of land cover data (Herold, 2006). These initiatives are largely driven by needs of international conventions (GCOS, 2004; GEOSS, 2005). An example of an already established strategic and methodological framework for harmonization of land cover classification systems is the UN Land Cover Classification System (LCCS) (Jansen & Gregorio, 2002; Gregorio, 2005). The LCCS applies a flexible but standardized set of classifiers and thresholds and is currently evolving as an internationally agreed standard for land cover characterization (Herold, 2006). Comparable land cover classification systems and understanding of semantic differences between data sets is essential for comparative accuracy analyses of different land cover data sets. Harmonization and validation of land cover data are therefore often parallel processes. Analogous efforts for land use data are still missing since international consensus on the definition and classification of land use has not yet been reached (Jansen, 2006). Improved validation of land use and land cover data Validation can help the user to select the most appropriate land cover or land use map for a specific purpose based on its correspondence with field observations or other data of relevance to the specific study for which the land use/cover data are prepared. Classical validations use field observations to judge the suitability of land cover data. Mostly these compare ground observations of land cover with the information in the land cover database and the percentage of correctly represented observations is measured. Field observations require an enormous investment, especially in case of the validation of global data sets; consequently most global data sets have not been validated (Herold, 2006). Therefore, Iwao et al. (2006) propose the use of Degree Confluence Project (DCP) information as a new method for validating land cover maps. The DCP is a volunteer-based project that aims to collect onsite information from all the degree confluences (intersections of integer level latitude and longitude gridlines) in the world. The paper of Iwao et al. (2006) assesses the reliability and effectiveness of DCP-derived data in validating land cover maps. DCP-derived validation information (at 749 confluences) was used to evaluate existing land cover maps for Eurasia (GLC2000, MOD12, UMD and GLCC). The agreements between the DCP-derived validation information and the land cover maps were between 50% and 58%. If the confluence and its surrounding 1 km square area contain more than one type of land cover, it is not always possible to determine whether the DCP-derived validation information faithfully represents the land cover of a 1 km square surrounding the confluence, leading to potential inconsistencies. The authors indicate that agreement may be improved by combining DCP-derived validation information with (visual) interpretation of high-resolution imagery (Iwao et al., 2006). For some regions validation efforts of global land cover data are even showing lower levels of agreement. Frey & Smith (2007) use a large set of ground-based observations to see if global and regional land cover products are suitable for climate and ecosystem assessments. The authors used a collection of 2161 geolocated, irregularly spaced field observations of land cover throughout West Siberia to validate a number of currently available global land cover characteristics databases. The study indicated that overall agreement with ground observations of land cover is between 11% and 21% only. Permanent wetlands and waterbodies are underestimated in all databases. These results raise into question the efficacy of incorporating currently available land cover products into terrestrial ecosystem models in northern wetland environments. In the absence of a consistent global database of field observations, Sterling & Ducharne (2008) validate their global land cover maps by comparing the areas of land cover with a wide range of estimates from the literature. The comparison, based on estimates of anthropogenic land cover show a wide variation in the percentage of the earth surface covered by anthropogenic land cover indicating the high degree of uncertainty in global maps. Based on these observations, the authors highlight the need for improvements in land cover mapping. Especially, the area and distribution of grazing land needs to be determined more accurately given its large influence on land surface processes. Similar attention is needed to map global tree plantations given the large importance and dynamics of timber plantations in North America and oil-palm plantations in Southeast Asia. Implications for global change analysis and modelling Land cover data and emission inventories The role of land cover data in calculating emissions is especially important for the reporting requirements for GHG inventories to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) commission. To make these country specific reporting as much comparable as possible, guidelines and best practice documents were developed (see: http://www.ipcc-nggip.iges.or.jp/public/gpglulucf/gpglulucf_files/Chp2/Chp2_Land_Areas.pdf for the full guidelines with respect to the estimation of land cover areas). These guidelines address many of the issues raised in this paper regarding proper use of the data with respect to harmonization of legends, scaling issues and other uncertainties. However, these guidelines actually contain little information on how to estimate land areas (changes) and leave it to the individual countries to select the land cover data used from a variety of sources (agricultural census surveys, forest inventories, and remote sensing data). Although this approach enables countries to make best use of existing data, inconsistencies between data sources will ultimately lead to inconsistent estimates of emissions that are not easily corrected. The choice of data used in emission inventories may have large consequences for the resulting emission estimates. Verburg et al. (2006) made an assessment of the uncertainties involved in regional estimates of methane emissions from rice fields in one of the main rice growing regions of the Philippines. The rice area was determined by supervised classification of a radar image (ERS-SAR). A comparison between the rice areas derived from the ERS-SAR image and the rice area given in the statistical surveys at the level of municipalities shows large deviations between the two sources for a number of municipalities (Fig. 2). In general, the rice grown area as identified by ERS-SAR is smaller than the area reported in statistics (almost 30% for the total study area). Causes for this difference include inconsistency in statistical sources due to definitions and sampling methods and interpretation and classification problems of the ERS-SAR image. Many rice fields are relatively small and irrigation canals and dykes are abundant. The small size parcels may lead to an underestimation of the rice area in the ERS-SAR interpretation. It is clear that the regional emission of methane calculated with the rice area of the ERS-SAR is considerably lower than the emission calculated with the statistical data. In comparison to other uncertainties in emission estimates for this region, such as model accuracy and upscaling procedure, the uncertainty in land cover data is highest. Figure 2 Open in figure viewer PowerPoint Rice area per municipality based on interpretation of Radar images and as reported in statistical surveys (based on Verburg et al., 2006). Earlier in this paper the influence of the spatial resolution of the land cover maps on the areas of, respectively, grassland and water bodies in the Dutch Fen Meadow landscape was discussed. Nol et al. (2008) assessed the impact of the spatial resolution of the land cover data for emissions of nitrous oxide from this region. Based on the estimated surface areas, agricultural N2O emissions were estimated using different inventory techniques. All four databases of land cover overestimated the grassland area when compared to the field map. This caused a considerable overestimation of agricultural N2O emissions, ranging from 9% for more detailed databases to 11% for the coarsest database. The effect of poor land cover representation was larger for an inventory method based on a process model than for inventory methods based on simple emission factors. Although the effect of errors in land cover representations were, in this study, small compared with the effect of uncertainties in emission factors, these effects are systematic (i.e., cause bias) and do not cancel out by spatial upscaling. Moreover, bias in land cover representations can be quantified or reduced by careful selection of the land cover database (Nol et al., 2008). Quaife et al. (2008) show how the use of different land cover maps influences calculated large-scale, bottom-up estimates of terrestrial carbon fluxes. The authors compare calculated fluxes based on globally available moderate resolution satellite-derived land cover maps with fluxes calculated using a reference high resolution (25 m) land cover map specific to Great Britain (the Land Cover Map 2000). The authors demonstrate that uncertainty is introduced into carbon flux calculations by (1) incorrect or uncertain assignment of land cover classes to plant functional types (PFTs), (2) information loss at coarser resolutions, and (3) difficulty in discriminating some vegetation types from satellite data. Differences in land use data account for differences between −15.8% and 8.8% in calculated Gross Primary Production. Considerations with respect to integrated assessment modelling Many models used in global climate studies [e.g., ORCHIDEE (Krinner et al., 2005) and LPJmL (Bondeau et al., 2007)] use PFTs as a basis for simulating vegetation dynamics. Sterling & Ducharne (2008) indicate that the reclassification process of land cover type to plant functional types and especially assigning a percentage of bare soil to the land cover types is an important step in land surface modelling. The percentage of bare soil drives the major land surface fluxes and properties, determining, among others, LAI and albedo. Wang et al. (2006) present a table to convert land cover classes to Plant Functional Types using available information to make the PFTs as consistent with the land cover description as possible but also mention that this translation could be another source of uncertainty given the wide range of PFTs possible in one land cover type. Many recent integrated assessments of environmental change use a series of coupled models instead of one single assessment model. In such approaches often a specific model or module dealing with land change is found. This module converts the demands for commodities and services into change in land cover areas. These land cover changes are allocated within a spatial representation of the landscape being input to the emission and climate models (e.g., Rounsevell et al., 2005; Sohl et al., 2007; Verburg et al., 2008). The difficulty in translating demands for commodities in land cover claims is complicated by the different data sources used in different disciplinary traditions. Demands for commodities are often determined by (multi-)sectoral economic models and are expressed in the units of the goods or service under consideration, such as agricultural production (Meijl et al., 2006; Lotze-campen et al., 2008). The conversion of change in the demand for commodities into land cover change is not always straightforward. In case of agricultural commodities, farming system characteristics such as multiple-cropping, intercropping and other management practices need to be accounted for. Expansion of arable area is only one possible way of fulfilling an increasing demand for agricultural commodities. In many cases intensification by means of increasing inputs, efficiency or cropping intensity are a more likely means of fulfilling the demand (Neumann et al., 2010). Similar considerations apply to forestry. Increasing wood demands do not necessarily lead to deforestation but in many cases to forest degradation or changed management practices which are difficult to detect using remote sensing (Lambin, 1999). Most land change models focusing on deforestation are only capable of addressing complete deforestation and ignore forest degradation. Integrated assessment modelling and coupling of economic and geographic models means explicitly dealing with inconsistencies between data sources and the difference between land use and land cover. If not properly accounted for such differences in underlying data, integrated assessment modelling runs the risk of propagating errors due to inconsistent use of data across the different models or modules. Conclusions and recommendations Based on the review of literature, a number of recommendations are formulated to improve the practice of using land use and land cover data in climate change studies. Explore and document data inconsistencies and uncertainties Uncertainty assessment is an integral part of many climate change studies (Diniz et al., 2009; Brown, 2010; Hastings et al., 2010). In most analyses, the uncertainty and error in the land use/cover data used as input to the assessments is not addressed. Because part of the errors and uncertainties in the data may be structured towards under- or overestimating a specific land cover type due to observation or aggregation bias this may lead to a one-directional error in the climate change assessments. It is especially this type of errors and uncertainties that should be given explicit attention in climate change assessments. Scientists should use their awareness of these inconsistencies and uncertainties in land use/cover data to study the implications of these uncertainties for the results of their studies and properly communicate those implications. Differences between data sets representing land use or land cover are often seen as inconsistencies or errors. However, in many cases such differences are the result of different representations of the data in terms of classification and temporal and spatial scale. An analysis of the underlying reasons for inconsistencies and errors will help to make more appropriate use of the data in climate change assessments. Inconsistencies between data may, in fact, indicate that complementary information is available which, if properly used, may benefit the overall assessment. Many global change assessments regard land use/cover data as just one of the many input variables for which easily available data are used without explicit consideration of alternative data sources. This often results in a mismatch between the characteristics of the data and the use of the data in further calculations. Models calibrated with point or field level data will, most likely, not perform optimally with coarse scale data (Heuvelink, 1998). Therefore, a careful selection of the land use/cover data and a documentation of this selection for a specific application is mandatory. The risks involved in allowing countries to make best use of available data for their emission inventories could be reduced by requiring a better documentation of the potential bias involved in selecting a specific data source for the inventory. Enhanced guidelines could assist in identifying potential bias in inventories to make estimates more comparable between countries. Many climate change assessments focus on improving model performance and representation, e.g. by moving from Tier 2 to Tier 3 methods in emission inventories. While the Tier 2 approach applies (country-specific) emission factors and activity data to link land use/cover areas to emissions the Tier 3 approach uses higher-order methods including models with a closer link to soil and vegetation processes (IPCC, 1997). Given the uncertainties involved in land use/cover data and the key role of these data in climate change assessments a better balance of research efforts between improvement of input data and model representation should be achieved. Provide full documentation of land use/cover classifications used For a proper selection of data on land use/cover and their intended application it is essential to have a clear and extended documentation of the land use or land cover classes. Especially in translating the land cover information to PFTs, common in land surface modelling, this information is essential. Given the wide variety of definitions for the same land cover type, it is not wise to use data without a proper documentation of the categories. In spite of many efforts to create uniform descriptions of classes a wide variety of definitions exists. This variety also reflects the diverse intended applications of the collected data and, in many cases, the categories are defined to best suit the application the data are collected for. A proper documentation of land use/cover data can best be made in a uniform system. The UN LCCS (http://www.glcn.org/) provides guidelines and software for this and is now accepted by many users as a proper means for documenting and exchanging documentation on land cover classifications. Select data based on the needs for a specific application Land cover and land use information is often confused and not explicitly distinguished. Most information currently used in climate change assessments is based on remote sensing and primarily contains land cover information. However, for many climate change assessments management aspects of the land cover are essential. Land use may be very different on the same land cover. Grasslands may be natural, intensively managed or extensively used with highly different implications for e.g. carbon sequestration. Recent efforts to create data sets of land management are an important step forward including global and regional inventories of irrigated areas (Siebert et al., 2005; Wriedt et al., 2009; Portmann et al., 2010), global data on crop yields and fertilizer use (Monfreda et al., 2008; Potter et al., 2010) and methods to derive parcel size and structure from remote sensing images (Kuemmerle et al., 2009). It is common belief that land use/cover data with high spatial resolution are the ‘best’ data. This is not always the case. Thematic resolution or fit of the land cover classes with the model description of the processes under investigation may be a more important criterion for data quality for a specific application. Selection of land use/cover data should therefore primarily be based on the match of the data with the model or assessment approach. Several studies have indicated the poor fit of global data on land use/cover to specific regions. The classification algorithms and categories considered in global studies are not targeted towards the specific regional conditions. Therefore, the use of global land use/cover data for regional climate change assessments should be avoided. Regional specific data often better represent the regional situation and are therefore better suited for this level of analysis. Select scaling and aggregation methods based on data and landscape characteristics Most studies require edits to the data prior to analysis. Such edits include thematic aggregations, geographic projections or spatial aggregations. Such changes to the data may influence the characteristics of the data and the information contained in the data. Proper documentation of the data processing is essential but often lacking. Spatial aggregations may be done by different methods with different effects on the data. Some aggregation methods lead to an overall loss of information while other aggregation methods can structurally change the representation of specific classes in the data depending on the prevalence and structure of the classes in the landscape. Different landscapes require different aggregation techniques. Methods are available to correct unintended bias due to aggregation. Careful documentation of the aggregation methods and its effects on the data is essential and researchers may benefit from methods for knowledge exchange developed in geographic information science (Fonseca et al., 2000; Kuhn, 2001). Combine different data sources when complementary information is available Several attempts of integrating different, complementary data sources have provided high quality results as well as assessments of the uncertainty of the different data sources. By combining the strengths of different data more robust and reliable data can be constructed. In many countries and regions, multiple data sources that are not yet explored as common sources of land cover data are available and could be used to improve remote sensing-derived land cover estimates or census-based land use inventories. Examples of such data are for the European Union (EU) the Farm Accountancy Data Network (FADN) which was established to monitor the effects of the EU common agricultural policy (CAP). Derived from national surveys, the FADN contain harmonized micro-economic data, i.e. the bookkeeping principles are the same in all countries. The methodology applied aims to provide representative data along three dimensions: region, economic size and type of farming. This type of data can potentially improve insights in the land use practices that land cover data cannot provide. Because of privacy issues the location of the sample points is not disclosed, which largely restricts the applicability of these data. Another useful data set at the European level are for obtaining additional land use/cover data is the LUCAS ‘Land Use/Cover Area frame statistical Survey’ pilot project which was launched by Eurostat (European statistical bureau) in 2001. In contrast to mapping approaches this project uses area frame sampling to collect data. Based on the visual observation of sample geo-referenced points, area estimates are computed and used as a valid generalization without studying the entire area under investigation. The approach has also the important advantage of not involving/disturbing the land owners and the farmers. At European level, currently around 250 000 points have been sampled providing an excellent coverage of ground observations. A third example of alternative existing data sets that may provide useful information on land use are parcel registration systems and databases describing cropping practices and agricultural land use at the field scale. These data are collected to compute nutrient balances as requested by law or to apply for subsidies. Although such data are not always publicly available several authors have successfully applied such databases for research purposes (Schmit et al., 2006; Lucas et al., 2007). A change in the data policies of the responsible institutions for collecting these data adapting to the needs of the scientists dealing with global change research would benefit the quality of global change assessments. Focus the collection of new data to the most uncertain land use/cover types and regions In addition to making most efficient use of existing data new data may be collected to improve the representation of land use/cover in climate assessments. For newly collected data, documentation of methods and uncertainty (including validation) should receive sufficient attention. Documentation of the classification of data should follow internationally agreed guidelines. For global scale applications, new land cover data should focus on the main uncertainties in current data. Most important is the representation of grassland areas. Global estimates are deviating largely between current sources. Also the distinction between forest and forest plantations deserves explicit attention. Well organized campaigns aimed at a combination of remote sensing with ground observations and inventory data may improve the representation of grasslands and forest plantations in global data sets. Explicitly represent mosaics and/or land use systems in land classifications Most land cover data attempt to classify each pixel by the dominant land cover. For high spatial resolution data, this may provide a good representation of reality. For medium to coarse resolution data, this representation may lead to problems since many landscapes contain a mosaic of land cover types. Although the classification into one dominant land cover type is convenient in many models the characteristic conditions of these mosaic landscapes are disregarded. In terms of processes relevant to climate change mosaic landscapes can have specific characteristics that may not be represented correctly by the dominant land cover types. A recent study indicated that agricultural areas and agro-forestry systems worldwide contain large amounts of trees that may not be ignored given their important role in climate change processes (Zomer et al., 2009). Therefore, the explicit representation of these mosaics as separate classes in land cover data should be considered. Besides land cover information land use information is often essential for climate change assessments. The same land use may, depending on the local context, represent different levels of interaction of humans with the environment. Instead of representing the landscape in terms of land cover or land use a representation in terms of land use systems that integrate the land cover and management aspects may be considered. Ellis & Ramankutty (2008) have attempted to map land use systems, in their terminology called anthropogenic biomes (or anthromes). These biomes share a common level of interactions between humans and the environment, examples include ‘dense settlements,’‘pastoral villages’ and ‘populated rainfed croplands,’ Each of these biomes consists of a heterogeneous landscape mosaic combining a variety of different land covers. Through some of this heterogeneity might be explained by the relatively coarse resolution of the analysis, a more fundamental explanation is that human–environment interactions lead to different mosaics due to natural variation in terrain, human enhancement of the natural heterogeneity by concentrating activities at the most productive locations and heterogeneity caused directly by the specific activity types of the considered biome. The use of an anthropogenic biome map instead of a conventional biome or land cover map has major advantages given the better representation of the human-environment interactions and its intensity that cannot directly be observed from land cover data. The collection of data that assist the representation of land use systems may be further elaborated by using available information on livestock densities (van de Steeg et al., 2010), production efficiencies (Verburg et al., 2000), crop types (Monfreda et al., 2008), cropping periods (Sacks et al., 2010), remoteness and land management (e.g., fertilizer application).

Reducing crop loss due to environmental and pathogen-related stresses, improving resource use efficiency and selecting optimal plant traits are major challenges in plant agriculture industries worldwide. New technologies are required to accurately monitor, in real time and with high spatial and temporal resolution, plant physiological and developmental responses to their microenvironment. Nanomaterials are allowing the translation of plant chemical signals into digital information that can be monitored by standoff electronic devices. Herein, we discuss the design and interfacing of smart nanobiotechnology-based sensors that report plant signalling molecules associated with health status to agricultural and phenotyping devices via optical, wireless or electrical signals. We describe how nanomaterial-mediated delivery of genetically encoded sensors can act as tools for research and development of smart plant sensors. We assess performance parameters of smart nanobiotechnology-based sensors in plants (for example, resolution, sensitivity, accuracy and durability) including in vivo optical nanosensors and wearable nanoelectronic sensors. To conclude, we present an integrated and prospective vision on how nanotechnology could enable smart plant sensors that communicate with and actuate electronic devices for monitoring and optimizing individual plant productivity and resource use.

However, environmental and biological stresses impair growth and yield, leading to major crop losses worldwide3,4. Plant environmental stresses including drought5, heat6, flooding7, salinity4,6 and frost6,8 are key drivers of economic losses in agriculture. Microbial pathogens and virus-related diseases also lead to devastating crop losses9,10,11. The challenge of improving agricultural productivity is magnified by the expected increase in the frequency and intensity of plant stress-related events in a changing climate12,13. Thus, precise management of limited resources and costly agrochemicals (for example, water, nutrients and pesticides) offers the opportunity to increase crop yields while minimizing resource losses through the use of remote sensing techniques for crop monitoring14,15. Improved tools for high-throughput phenotyping of desired crop traits will be needed to accelerate efforts towards developing plant stress tolerant varieties16. Increasing total agricultural productivity will require innovative and convergent technological approaches for managing plant stressors and resource use efficiency. Recent advances in nanotechnology offer untapped potential to reduce the impact of major stresses on food and energy crop productivity, while optimizing the use of limited resources such as water or nutrients. In this Review, we discuss how nanobiotechnology-based sensors in plants can enable communication and actuation of electronic agricultural and phenotyping devices for optimizing crop growth and yield in response to stresses or resource deficits. We envision smart nanobiotechnology-based sensors that report plant health status through optical and wireless signals and fine-tune agricultural device responses (Fig. 1). Nanosensors are poised to enable the translation of plant chemical signals into digital information for real-time monitoring of plant health by electronic devices. These nanobiotechnology approaches for precisely detecting the onset of stress or resource deficits within individual plants will contribute to improving phenotyping technologies for plant breeding by facilitating high-throughput screening of chemical phenotypes of stress-tolerant varieties. Smart plant sensors engineered through nanobiotechnology will be able to report crop health status to existing agricultural equipment to promote a transition to automated methods for precise and efficient use of resources. Fig. 1: Nanobiotechnology approaches enable research and development of smart plant sensors that communicate plant chemical signals to agricultural and phenotyping equipment. Major abiotic and biotic stresses and resource deficiencies are associated with signalling molecules that communicate and regulate plant responses including ROS (for example, H2O2), Ca2+, NO and ABA among others. Nanomaterial-mediated delivery of genetically encoded sensors enables research on signalling mechanisms of plant health that inform the design and engineering of smart plant sensors. Optical nanosensors and wearable nanotechnology-based sensors interfaced with plants allow the translation of plant chemical signals into optical and radio waves, and electric signals, which can be monitored by electronic devices. Machines with the capacity to decode spatiotemporal patterns of plant chemical signals will allow smart nanobiotechnology-based sensors to actuate agricultural devices for optimizing the plant environment. These nanobiotechnology approaches have applications ranging from research and development of technologies in the laboratory, chemical phenotyping in specialized facilities to monitoring and automation in crops for urban farming and precision agriculture. Full size image Nanotechnology, the manipulation and use of matter with dimensions smaller than 100 nm, has distinct advantages to engineer smart plant sensors. For example, engineered nanomaterials embedded in plants can be designed for monitoring signalling molecules by near-infrared (nIR) cameras in real time. Nanomaterials can also act as DNA scaffolds that overcome plant cellular barriers and deliver genetically encoded biosensors for crop research. Wearable sensors can record volatile compounds on plant surfaces and report to wireless devices. In this Review, ‘sensor’ is used as a general term for any probe, indicator, reporter, molecular sensor or sensing device if not termed differently in the cited reference. Optical nanosensors are nanomaterials that allow high spatial and temporal resolution for monitoring plant signalling molecules via fluorescence signals in spectral regions, such as the nIR, where living tissues are relatively transparent17,18,19,20. These nanosensors can be tailored to provide high stability, specificity for analytes of interest, rapid dynamics, accuracy and reproducibility in the desired analytical range for plants21. Recently, nanotechnology has enabled the delivery of DNA plasmids into plant cells using high aspect ratio nanomaterials as scaffolds that penetrate plant cell barriers in vivo without external mechanical or chemical aid22,23, thus opening the door to deliver genetically encoded sensors for designing and engineering smart plant sensors. Genetically encoded sensors generally consist of a sensory module coupled to fluorescent proteins that can be detected with high spatial and temporal resolution by fluorescence imaging devices24,25. They are highly selective for the specific analyte and exhibit a high signal-to-noise ratio with low perturbation of biological systems in which they are integrated. Wearable sensors integrate flexible substrate materials and nanoelectronics that are advancing the fields of sensors for human health monitoring and robotic manipulation26 but with applications that remain relatively unexplored in plants. Engineered nanomaterials are not genome specific, making them more easily deployed across diverse plant species than species-specific molecular methods19,20,27,28,29,30. Nanobiotechnology approaches do not necessarily require genetically modifying whole plants to introduce new traits, which is a procedure that faces considerable governmental regulations and public debate31,32. Although nanomaterials are increasingly becoming subject of these regulations, studies in the past decade have reported that a wide range of nanomaterials are not inherently toxic and that detrimental effects on living organisms are dependent on specific nanomaterial composition, structure, surface chemistry and concentration33,34,35,36,37,38. Furthermore, we expect that exposure to nanomaterials will only be required for selected plants within an agricultural field. On these selected plants, a variety of plant structures for non-human consumption could be chosen for nanomaterial exposure. In some instances, smart nanobiotechnology-based sensor development and application would involve plant exposure to nanomaterials only in the laboratory or controlled phenotyping setups. Smart plant-sensing devices have the potential to provide unprecedented capabilities of allowing real-time monitoring of individual plant physiological status in response to stresses in safe and controlled conditions. This Review focuses on knowledge gaps, challenges and opportunities to engineer nanobiotechnology-based sensors that report plant health status and control actuation of electronic devices for improving crop productivity and phenotyping. This field is of interest to researchers working on nanoscale science and engineering tools for agriculture, engineers aiming to address knowledge gaps in plant nanobiotechnology and biologists looking for novel tools to monitor plant biomolecules. Previous reviews discuss topics not covered in depth by this article including broad agronomic applications of nanotechnology in plants39; design, principles and applications of nanosensors for plant biomolecules21 and genetically encoded biosensors in plants24,25. Wang et al.39 review targeted and controlled release of agrochemicals, labelling and imaging of nanoparticles in vivo and risks associated with exposure of nanomaterials to the food chain. Kwak et al.21 explore in more depth the mechanisms of how nanobiotechnology-based sensors for plants work and compare the pros and cons of different nanosensor technologies. Herein, we discuss nanobiotechnology-based approaches for monitoring plant signalling molecules associated with early detection of stress or resource deficiencies using nanomaterial-delivered genetic-encoded nanosensors, optical nanosensors and wearable sensors. We also provide a perspective on how smart plant sensors can actuate agricultural devices by communicating with smartphones, hyperspectral imaging cameras, wireless radio frequency devices, meteorological stations and phenotyping equipment. Monitoring plant health in real time Crop stress and resource deficiencies are currently monitored by assessing plant physical traits through imaging, spectroscopy and fluorescence from the visible to the infrared16,40,41. Although, these remote-sensing techniques provide important information about plant health status including leaf area, chlorophyll content and fluorescence42,43,44, stomatal conductance45, transpiration use efficiency46, water potential47 and leaf temperature48, they are either not suitable for early detection of some types of stresses or resource deficits, lack the potential to identify specific plant stresses or are not optimal nor cost efficient for monitoring individual plants16,44,49,50,51. Chlorophyll content decline and leaf area loss are stress-induced accumulative traits that are the result of impaired plant growth. Chlorophyll fluorescence is not always suitable for early stress detection and is not a specific indicator of stress types16. Plant water status parameters are related to multiple stresses including drought47, salinity46 and pathogens52. Raman and infrared spectroscopy have typically low signal-to-noise ratios and require complex equipment. They provide rich chemical information about cell composition but are more difficult to interpret due to impurities and heterogeneities on or inside the plant that affect the spectral signature. However, Raman spectroscopy in leaves has recently been performed using a custom-built, portable system capable of being operated in the field53, opening the door to applications in plant phenotyping facilities. Airborne detection tools are not optimal for monitoring individual plants54 or crop plants grown in high-density. They are also influenced by overexposure due to sunlight or shadows, low signal-to-noise levels and interfering weather conditions16. Novel sensing tools that facilitate continuous monitoring of individual plants with high reliability and improved signal-to-noise ratios will complement existing remote sensing tools (Fig. 1). Electronic devices, including smartphones, hyperspectral imaging cameras and autonomous or manned vehicles, can establish direct communication with nanobiotechnology-based sensors in plants. Nanobiotechnology-based approaches provide a pathway to transduce the invisible plant stress-related chemical signals into optical, wireless or electrical signals that can be recorded by current phenotyping equipment such as greenhouse, growth room or field scanalysers. Plant stress or resource deficit detection, based on chemical traits such as plant signalling molecules, has the potential to report the onset of plant health changes in real time and help to diagnose specific environmental or biological stressors. Key signalling molecules in plants that have been reported to be monitored by engineered nanomaterials and genetically encoded nanoscale sensors include reactive oxygen species (ROS), calcium (Ca2+), glucose, sucrose, nitric oxide (NO) and plant hormones such as abscisic acid (ABA), jasmonic acid, methyl salicylate and ethylene (Table 1). Both ROS and Ca2+ are at the forefront of plant stress signalling55. Ca2+ is involved in most stress signalling pathways and is evolutionarily conserved among different plant species56. ROS have a dual role in plants, acting as a toxic molecule at high levels and playing a signalling role in a broad range of plant stress responses at low levels57,58. Ca2+ and ROS signature signals have been associated with specific plant stress responses59,60. Sugars such as glucose and sucrose are also important plant molecules that regulate a broad range of physiological and developmental changes61,62,63. ABA, NO, methyl salicylate and ethylene have been reported to be more specific indicators of plant stress types. ABA is an early signal of water stress64,65. NO, methyl salicylate and ethylene are mainly involved in plant pathogen defence response66,67,68. The plant hormone jasmonate coordinates both biotic and abiotic stress responses including salinity and freezing tolerance, drought and wounding response69. Other important signalling molecules that can be future targets for sensor development are salicylic acid and isoprenes. Salicylic acid is a signalling molecule involved in plant pathogen defence70. Plant volatile organic compounds (VOC), such as isoprenes, are associated with high light, temperature and water stress71. Developing and applying nanotechnology-based sensing tools for real-time monitoring of these key chemical signalling molecules in plants will improve our understanding of plant stress communication and enable plant health monitoring in the field. Table 1 Plant molecular targets related to health status that have been reported to be monitored by nanotechnology-based sensors Full size table Nanomaterial delivery of genetically encoded sensors Genetically encoded sensors are capable of reporting in vivo concentrations of molecules, presence and activity of proteins, and ion dynamics. Most current biosensors enable subcellular monitoring and analysis of plant signalling molecules, which can provide critical knowledge for designing and engineering smart plant sensors. Recently, real-time imaging of calcium levels in whole plants under herbivore attack was demonstrated using genetically encoded sensors in laboratory conditions72 (Fig. 2), providing a technology platform that could be adapted for fluorescence imaging in phenotyping facilities41 or with modified portable field equipment73. Stable or transient expression of genetically encoded sensors in plants requires the generation of transgenic material in amenable plant species. The design of a genetically encoded reporter is, to a certain extent, rational and has been demonstrated in applications to plant leaves and roots for the detection of signalling molecules63,74,75,76,77,78,79. Genetically encoded sensing approaches in plants rely on varying mechanisms from protein–protein interactions to covalent bond modifications that influence their fluorescence intensity or wavelength in the visible range of the electromagnetic radiation spectrum (Fig. 2a,b). Currently, fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET)-based sensors report sugars in leaves and roots (Fig. 2c), including glucose and sucrose, with a high temporal resolution (10 s) and within physiological concentration ranges in transgenic plant model systems such as Arabidopsis thaliana74,75,76 and rice crop plants in response to both abiotic and biotic stresses63 (Table 1). Genetically encoded sensors have allowed imaging of calcium dynamics at very high temporal resolution (1.5 s)72,77,78,80 and the detection of glucose at micromolar levels in roots75. Recently, biosensors have been reported to detect H2O2 in vivo with subcellular resolution in chloroplasts and nuclei79 (Fig. 2d,e) and within physiological pH range during elicitor induced oxidative bursts with 15 s temporal resolution81. Overall, genetically encoded sensors offer sensitivities within the plant physiological range and temporal resolutions that allow the detection of various plant signalling molecules. Concentration changes of signalling molecules or metabolites in plant cells are dynamic but genetically encoded sensors have a temporal resolution on the order of seconds (Table 1) and could therefore report chemical signals on this time scale in real time. However, they require genetically amenable plant species to transformation methods such as gene gun particle bombardment and Agrobacterium tumefaciens plasmid delivery. Applications in crops have been limited by available DNA transformation methods and slow rate of optimization per species. Nanomaterial-enabled methods are being developed as an alternative approach to enable genetic material delivery into mature wild-type plants without the need to develop species-specific genetic techniques22,23.

Reproduced from ref. 79, SNL (d,e); ref. 72, AAAS (f). Full size image Delivering DNA cassettes or plasmids containing genetically encoded nanoscale sensors for expression within wild-type plant species might allow application to a broad range of crop plants that are not currently amenable to genetic modification. Single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNT) coated with DNA have the ability to penetrate plant lipid bilayers through passive and spontaneous translocation processes19,82. Thus, SWCNTs have great potential to act as a delivery chassis for exogenous DNA into plant cells. By binding the plant expression cassette to SWCNTs and application to the leaf lamina through a needleless syringe, transfection of DNA into plants is possible without Agrobacterium or gene gun particle bombardment22,23. Using a plasmid or amplified dsDNA, each containing a nuclear expression gene cassette, bound to the SWCNT, plants expressed transiently a fluorescent reporter protein without the integration of DNA into the genome23. How nanomaterial and plasmid properties determine transient versus stable gene expression in plants remains to be explored. These studies will inform the design of modular DNA–SWCNT transformation tools for generating fertile transgenic plants. Nuclear-based integration-dependent genetic sensors allow for new research into specific wild-type plant species. However, a uniform delivery chassis to plastids such as chloroplasts may enable a cross-species protein expression platform for mature plants due to their prokaryotic ancestry and evolutionary history in plants83. Nanotechnology is providing tools for engineering the relatively conserved plastid genomes of chloroplasts and mitochondria. Recently, SWCNTs delivered plasmid DNA to chloroplasts of different plant species without external biolistic aid and enabled yellow fluorescent protein (YFP) transient gene expression assessed by confocal fluorescence microscopy imaging22. Although, most biosensors are likely to be located in the cell cytosol, the plastid genome represents an opportunity to create translatable sensors for broader plant taxa than the nuclear genome (Fig. 2g). To date, genetically encoded sensors for chloroplasts are restrained to the few species that are able to be genetically modified24,25. Current chloroplast transformation techniques are limited to a small number of plant species (<12). The absence of a targeted DNA delivery mechanisms to chloroplasts, screening capabilities needed to prevent chimeric genome copies and labour-intensive calli culturing techniques hinders efforts to expand the range of transformed plant species84. ROS and salicylic acid are key signalling molecules produced by chloroplasts that accumulate in plants exposed to abiotic and biotic stress85 and could act as indicators of plant health. In the future, genetically encoded nanosensors could be sent to plastids for detection of these chemical signals reporting plant health status without the need to develop species-specific methods. Engineered nanomaterials as in vivo optical sensors The unique optical and electronic properties of nanomaterials offer key advantages for imaging plant signalling molecules in vivo. Nanomaterials have ultra-low photobleaching, fluorescence in low- or transparent-background windows of living tissue and allow the detection of analytes with high spatiotemporal resolution down to single-molecule level and millisecond timescales36,86. SWCNTs have been used as building blocks for fluorescent nanosensors in mammalian systems87 and more recently in plants19,20,27 (Fig. 3). SWCNT fluorescence can be modulated in the nIR transparency window for plants through the interaction of the SWCNT’s organic phase coating (corona) with surrounding analytes (Fig. 3a). SWCNT-based sensors are highly versatile and have been engineered for sensing various molecule classes including ROS, NO, calcium, glucose, dopamine, nitroaromatics, proteins and other small molecules19,27,88,89,90,91. Multiple delivery methods for these optical nanosensors can be utilized in the laboratory, phenotyping facilities or the field including needleless syringe infusion through the leaf lamina, topical delivery and vacuum infiltration. Embedding SWCNT sensors in leaves allows real-time monitoring of short-lived signalling molecules such as NO and ROS in plants19,20. Leaf H2O2 levels can be reported by SWCNT fluorescence intensity changes within selected regions of leaves (micrometres) with high temporal resolution (seconds) (Fig. 3b,c). Quantum dots (QDs) are also widely used nanoparticles for optical sensing applications. Glucose, a key target analyte for assessing plant stress and productivity, has been detected with high selectivity by QD optical probes down to the level of a few hundred micromolar29. QDs are fluorescent nanomaterials with bright and tunable emission range from the visible to the nIR92. These nanoparticles also allow facile modification of structural and surface chemical properties92. Functionalizing QDs with boronic acids, known to bind to sugars such as glucose, has enabled standoff optical detection of glucose and its online monitoring in plant tissue with timescales on the order of minutes29. Fig. 3: Nanomaterial-based sensors allow in vivo optical monitoring of plant signalling molecules in real time. a, Analyte interaction with SWCNT sensors with the nanomaterial carbon lattice, organic corona or both leads to changes in nIR fluorescence intensity or wavelength shifts. b, Plant leaves have been interfaced with optical nanosensors including SWCNT, quantum dots and nanoscale gold virus for optical sensing of plant signalling molecules. c, H2O2 monitoring by imaging SWCNT nIR fluorescence intensity changes in Arabidopsis leaf sections in vivo with high spatial (>0.5 μm) and temporal resolution (>0.5 s). d,e, Kinetic Monte Carlo simulations predict fluorescence responses of optical nanosensors to biological signalling events from individual cells or subcellular compartments by considering nanosensor kinetics, imaging speed and resolution limits. This allows assessment of the nanosensor’s spatial and temporal sensitivity to improve sensor design. f, Simulated fluorescence intensity response of nanosensors for the release of an analyte from two locations on a cell or subcellular compartment. The rate constants of these nanosensors allow distinction of two release sites. g, Combined spatiotemporal resolution phase diagrams for optimizing biomolecule sensing in specific biological scenarios with sensors having different forward and backward rate constants. Adapted from ref. 20, Wiley (c); ref. 97, American Chemical Society (d–g). Full size image Current optical standoff detection readouts from nanosensors embedded in plants suffer from low signal-to-noise ratios in comparison to optimized conditions in sophisticated microscopes and lack of targeted localization in specific plant tissues, cells or organelles. To circumvent these issues, a signal increase through mechanisms, including field enhancement by gold nanoparticles, has been proposed93. Plant viruses were coated with a thin gold layer to enable field enhancement without compromising the targeting capability of the virus. Although this concept has not been proven yet for standoff imaging and spectroscopy, it is a possible approach to improve the optical signal from a smart nanobiotechnology-based sensor over the inherent background in the field. In situ synthesis of artificial sensors is another intriguing concept that could circumvent the delivery of nanosensors to target tissues or subcellular compartments. Metal–organic frameworks (MOFs) are three-dimensional structures with a high surface area built from ions and organic ligands. Fluorescent MOFs generated by plants in situ allowed them to report acetone levels in air through fluorescence changes in the presence of these volatile compounds94. Alternatively, coating nanosensors with targeting moieties such as peptides95 could allow specific localization in plant subcellular compartments. Important plant signalling molecules, such as Ca2+ and ROS, are characterized by fast spatiotemporal concentration changes resulting in waves within single cells, organs or whole plants. Although optical nanosensors have been widely developed and applied in animal cells both in vivo and in vitro96, imaging signalling molecules in neural networks of mammalian systems and in plants share similar challenges, including localized transient maxima of concentration at subcellular structures such as synapses in neurons or chloroplasts in plants91. A static concentration of an analyte, for example, ROS, is not likely to represent the most relevant information but the concentration changes in time and space. Consequently, sensor kinetics play an important role to determine if stress events can be resolved or not by plant signalling molecule detection. Diffusion and stochastic kinetic simulations are powerful tools to study biological scenarios and predict the fluorescence response of single or multiple sensors to spatiotemporal patterns of signalling molecules97 (Fig. 3d,e). It has been shown that such an approach allows predicting the expected nanosensor fluorescence response (Fig. 3d,e). Based on such images, it is possible to quantify if one could resolve chemical signals, for example, to distinguish two release points of a signalling molecule from a cell or organelle (Fig. 3f). When simulations are performed for different sensor parameters such as rate constants and affinities, measures for spatial and temporal resolution can be derived (Fig. 3g). These simulations provide a rationale for the synthesis and optimization of sensors to circumvent trial-and-error approaches. Additionally, they are promising tools to correlate signalling patterns in plants with stress or resource deficiency levels. In the future, sensor responses to plant chemical signals could be tested in silico to identify patterns that are distinguishable by a given sensor. In silico approaches can pinpoint to candidate sensors and optimal properties such as selectivity, sensitivity and dynamic range that could in principle inform their design for operation under field conditions. Furthermore, simulations and modelling are crucial to translate measured plant chemical signalling patterns into the digital information that is necessary for the decisions and actions of agricultural devices. Wearable nanotechnology-based sensors The field of wearable sensors has been widely developed for human skin and clothing applications26 and is creating nanotechnology-based platforms that provide minimally invasive sensors for plants98 with costs that are significantly being reduced over time allowing increase in commercialization26. Sensor networks based on flexible wearable nanoelectronic circuits implanted on plant surfaces are enabling wireless communication of low concentrations of volatile molecules in real time30. The high sensitivity of integrated arrays of SWCNT channels and graphitic electrodes transferred to leaf surfaces of live plants can detect trace levels of airborne chemical weapons (Fig. 4). The elastic properties of wearable nanotechnology-based sensors act as a “flexible skin” that can be bent on organisms with a radius of curvature as small as ~100 μm. Wearable SWCNT–graphite sensors can be operated by radio frequency (RF) for wireless monitoring with electronic devices without power consumption in response to gas molecule concentrations down to 5 ppm (ref. 30). Chemoresistive sensors based on SWCNTs and equipped with copper complexes work reversibly, allowing long-term monitoring of sub-ppm concentrations of ethylene, a plant hormone that acts as a key indicator of the onset of fruit ripening99. Carbon-nanotube-based sensing devices for plant VOCs, for example, ethylene, are now commercially available for agriculture applications but have not been interfaced directly with crops for monitoring plant signalling molecules (Fig. 4a,b). Although, highly stretchable wearable sensors based on graphene and carbon nanotubes have been reported to wirelessly monitor a wide range of gas and aqueous phase molecules, including glucose from mammalian epidermal cells100,101, few publications to date consider their applications in plants. Fig. 4: Nanotechnology-based flexible and wearable sensors for plant chemical sensing. a, Schematic represents SWCNT-based chemoresistive sensors for volatile molecule detection, in this example ethylene, a key plant signalling molecule. b, Binding of SWCNT and copper complexes to ethylene molecules emitted from plant structures, for example fruits, results in resistance changes proportional to the concentration of this volatile compound. c, Plants engineered with wireless and wired wearable nanotechnology-based sensors for chemical sensing have been interfaced with crop leaves. d,e, Radio frequency wireless monitoring a volatile nerve agent simulant DMMP (dimethyl methylphosphonate) with ppm concentration resolution. Reproduced from ref. 99, Wiley (a,b); ref. 30, American Chemical Society (d,e). Full size image Future nanotechnology-based wearable sensor approaches will require high sensitivity and increased signal-to-noise ratios under variable ambient conditions. To monitor plant VOCs associated with plant health status, the wearable sensors should be able to report ranges in very low concentrations in the ppb range (Table 1) or include concentration mechanisms to allow detection. The resistance of SWCNT–graphite electronic devices is modulated by molecule adsorption and transfer of electrons on the SWCNT surface102. These devices have a tunable sensitivity to gas molecules from parts per million 103 to as low as the parts per billion range30,104,105. Relative humidity (RH) near the plant surface results in increased sensor noise and recovery time30. Thus, wearable sensor performance would depend on the type of plant substrate they are interfaced with. Selectivity against analyte mixtures under variable ambient conditions, for example, humidity, temperature and wind, could be accomplished by multiplexing carbon-nanomaterial-based wearable sensors. Carbon-nanotube-based conductive inks and graphene printed on the leaf surface allow monitoring RH near the leaf epidermis and plant water status continuously through wired multimeters28,98. Changes in plant water transport have been reported by graphene-based wearable sensors on leaves that detect reversible changes in RH from 20–90% (ref. 98). High-resolution patterning and transferring of tape-based graphene RH sensors on the leaf epidermis creates air gaps that allow gas exchange between the leaf and environment. The graphene sensor resistance dynamics, in response to RH, is measured and reported by a resistance, inductance and capacitance (RLC) meter98. Alternatively, microfluidic printed SWCNT ink on the leaf epidermis can assess plant water status and the onset of drought stress through real-time measurements of single stomatal aperture dynamics28. This wearable sensor is made from two printed contact pads and a stripe across a single stoma that are responsive to slight variations in stomatal opening and closing latency during drought. Other stress conditions that induce changes in stomatal conductance including flooding and salinity could be detected through wearable sensing nanotechnologies. Wired wearable sensors based on carbon nanomaterials can be designed to be operated by RF wireless signals. Thus, allowing integration of sensors for volatile compound signalling molecules in plants with potential interfering environmental signals such as RH. Wearable sensors report basic but key parameters of crop health and have already reached a technical standard close to applications. Wearable flexible electronics based on three-dimensional sub-micrometre-thick, centimetre-scale macroporous networks106,107 have not been interfaced with plants yet, representing an untapped sensing nanotechnology that could continuously monitor multiple plant electrochemical signals simultaneously with high temporal resolution. For example, syringe-injectable mesh nanoelectronic devices106 could be embedded into plants using 100 μm diameter needles with minimal mechanical perturbation. Mesh nanoelectronics millisecond temporal resolution could record rapid waves of plant signalling molecules, for example, Ca2+ and ROS in the extracellular space, in response to stress, as it has been demonstrated for monitoring neural activity in mice brain in vivo106. Sensor communication and actuation with machines Nanobiotechnology is on the verge of generating the tools for establishing real-time two-way communication channels between nanobiotechnology-based sensors merged with plants and electronic devices. SWCNT sensors embedded in leaves have converted plants into self-powered chemical detectors that report the presence of groundwater analytes via nIR optical signals27 (Fig. 5). Plants equipped with SWCNTs functionalized with bombolitin peptides report the presence of explosive nitroaromatics, such as picric acid, to research grade cameras and even smartphones27 (Fig. 5a). By connecting a camera to a miniaturized computer, for example, a Raspberry Pi, nanosensors embedded within plants communicate the presence of the analyte through optical signals that could trigger e-mails and text messages or communicate directly to a smartphone using Bluetooth27. Furthermore, monitoring of genetically encoded sensors delivered by nanomaterials to leaves with customized imaging devices for plant chlorophyll fluorescence108 may allow reporting of stress-induced signals (for example, Ca2+) in plants72 (Fig. 2f). Fluorescence imaging of green fluorescent protein (GFP)-based Ca2+ sensors (GCaMP3) in whole plants was performed at 2 s temporal resolution using a 1× objective and a digital camera indicating that standoff imaging of these types of sensors would be possible. Nanobiotechnology-based sensors are, therefore, a promising tool to create smart crops that communicate their health status to agricultural devices. However, validation of smart nanobiotechnology devices on plants has not been done outside of the laboratory. Fig. 5: Smart plant sensor communication and actuation of electronic devices through optical and radio waves, and electrical signals. a, Plant leaves embedded with SWCNTs act as detectors of nitroaromatics, for example, picric acid. Polyvinyl-alcohol functionalized SWCNTs (black arrow) act as internal controls whereas bombolitin II peptide-coated SWCNT (red arrow) monitor picric acid in real time with a high spatiotemporal resolution by reporting changes in nIR fluorescence intensity to research-grade and smartphone-quality cameras. b, Smart nanobiotechnology-based sensors delivered to plant subcellular compartments have the potential to communicate health status to agricultural or phenotyping devices equipped with hyperspectral imaging cameras, smartphones, drones or meteorological stations. Machines able to decode plant subcellular spatiotemporal patterns of chemical signals could, in turn, control the actuation of agricultural devices to improve microenvironmental conditions including irrigation, shading, heating, the release of fertilizers, pesticides and fungicides, or nanoparticle-based therapeutics against stress, for example, CeO2, CuO and ZnO. Real-time monitoring of plant chemical signalling by phenotyping systems could improve the selection of desired plant traits for high yield and tolerance to stress. Reproduced from ref. 27, SNL (a). Full size image Smart nanobiotechnology-based sensors that communicate through optical signals, wireless or wired channels have the capability to integrate with existing agricultural electronic devices, including smartphones, hyperspectral imaging cameras, high-throughput phenotyping instrumentation, radio frequency devices and meteorological stations30,44,109,110,111 (Fig. 5b). Smartphones are already used to monitor crops with accurate GPS information and active communication through Bluetooth and the Internet of Things112,113. In combination with digital software platforms, they monitor and measure the impact of agronomic decisions on crop performance. Assisting with crop management are unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV) capable of monitoring vegetation indexes through multispectral bands from the visible to the nIR110 and detecting water stress with a 40 cm resolution44. On the ground, high-throughput chemical phenotyping of plants with smart nanobiotechnology-based sensors could be possible through terrestrial platform-based multi-sensor systems with vegetation index sensors, thermal infrared radiometers, spectrometers and visible cameras111. Radio frequency responses of wireless sensors interfaced with plant surfaces30 (Fig. 4c–e) are ready to be interfaced with commercially available RF identification devices. Wireless or wired sensor data can be collected and transmitted to field-deployable environmental and phenotyping stations. With internet connectivity, these stations are capable of cloud-based storage and data analysis, which are methods already facilitating data-driven decisions on farms. Remote sensing technologies with the help of computer models can complement smart nanobiotechnology-based sensors for plant stress management114. Large dataset technologies that transmit, process and actuate devices will synergize the integration of smart plant sensors with agricultural devices115. Smart nanobiotechnology-based sensors able to monitor crop health will face several challenges to ensure applicability, accuracy and durability under crop field conditions. Applications can range from urban farming and plant phenotyping facilities, to large industrial agriculture applications where they will need to report crop health status across hundreds of hectares. The required spatial resolution provided by smart plant sensors in the field, from individual plants to groups of plants in the field, has not been determined yet and will likely depend on microenvironment variations, type of plant stress and agricultural or phenotyping sensing instruments. To accurately assess plant health status, multiple chemical signalling and environmental parameters are likely needed to be detected and analysed. Consequently, multiplexing is crucial to further improve the sensing approaches for signalling molecules described above or a combination of genetically encoded sensors, optical nanosensors and wearable sensing devices. A minimum lifetime of a growing season spanning several months is expected for smart nanobiotechnology-based sensors to adequately perform in an agricultural system. For most nanobiotechnology-based plant sensors, durability has not been tested in the laboratory or in the field. However, genetically encoded sensors integrated into the plant nuclear or plastid genome are expected to last for a plant lifetime and SWCNT sensors have been demonstrated to operate in mammalian systems for at least six months116. To ensure sensor accuracy in agricultural environments, plants can be embedded with both smart nanobiotechnology-based sensors for analytes of interests and non-responsive sensors to these analytes that act as internal controls. Ratiometric approaches have been applied to genetically encoded sensors and optical nanosensors for the detection of H2O2, calcium, glucose and other biochemicals in plants and the environment27,29,76,77,79. To minimize negative impacts due to downtime, the redundancy of smart plant sensors in each node will be necessary. Replaceability and reparability of smart nanobiotechnology-based sensors will require practical, efficient and scalable interfacing methods of plants with nanomaterials. However, the mechanisms of transport and delivery of nanomaterials to plants are not well understood. Smart nanobiotechnology-based sensor output will not only allow plant health status communication with electronic devices but also actuation of agricultural equipment. Machine sensory, learning and actuation systems provide a communication platform between smart plant sensors and agricultural devices for optimizing environmental conditions through irrigation, fertilization and application of pesticides, among other crop management tools. Delivery of nanobiotechnology-based therapeutics such as ZnO (ref. 117), CuO (ref. 118), CeO2 (refs. 119,120) and nanocrystals121 can also contribute to alleviate heat and salinity stress, pathogen infections and frost damage, respectively. Autonomous vehicles integrating sensory, decision-making and actuation of agricultural equipment have been tested in crop fields for plant invasive species detection122. The machine-vision systems for these agricultural vehicles allow the recording of optical signals within the emission range of the nanotechnology-based sensors described above from the visible emission, for example, genetically encoded nanosensors and QDs, to the nIR range, for example, SWCNT123. Optimum sensing and actuation performance of autonomous vehicles will depend on the high variability of illumination in the environment, irregular terrain conditions or plant growth status. Unlike optical sensing approaches for machine sensing, automated wireless control systems do not suffer from the interference of these environmentally related factors and have been applied to regulate water and nutrient supply in hydroponics124. Research on automatic actuation of agricultural equipment for fine-tuning crop health status remains relatively unexplored. Conclusions and perspectives Meeting the projected increase in global demand for food in this century will require interdisciplinary and convergent approaches from plant sciences and engineering to bolster sustainable agricultural production. Nanotechnology offers high spatial and temporal resolution sensors for both aqueous and volatile plant signalling molecules and delivery platforms for genetically encoded sensors to study and engineer smart plant sensors that communicate and actuate with machines. By translating chemical signals associated with stress or resource deficiencies into wireless, electrical and optical signals, smart nanobiotechnology-based sensors are poised to improve plant growth and yield while fine-tuning resource use by interacting with agricultural devices. They could facilitate faster identification of desired crop traits by allowing high-throughput screening of chemical phenotypes. Although a number of nanoscale sensors already exist for plant signalling molecules associated with abiotic and biotic stresses, few are designed for sensing plant nutrient deficiencies. Nanobiotechnology provides key advantages to solve the challenges and limitations associated with the engineering of smart plant sensors. Genetically encoded sensors are excellent tools for subcellular research, that can pinpoint to key plant signalling mechanisms of stress communication for designing smart nanobiotechnology-based sensors. These biosensors have an adequate spatiotemporal resolution for enabling real-time monitoring of plant signalling molecules but are limited to amenable species. Nanomaterials could bridge this gap by acting as genetic element delivery platforms to expand the range of species that can be transformed. Engineered nanomaterials are a pathway to create smart plant sensors without relying on genetically amenable species. Optical nanosensors can be designed for monitoring aqueous-based signalling molecules with very high spatiotemporal resolutions in the order of single molecules and milliseconds. RF nanotechnology-based wearable devices are allowing the detection of plant volatile compounds. Unlike optical-based sensing approaches, wireless wearable sensors are not subject to background interference from environmental or terrain conditions. However, their sensitivity needs to be designed to sense very low levels of volatile compounds in the order of parts per billion. To date, smart plant sensors that communicate with electronic devices have been demonstrated in the laboratory under controlled conditions. Nanoscale plant sensors have yet to be tested under real agricultural conditions in which their performance would be affected by weather, plant growth and development. If successful in field trials, nanotechnology-based sensors could provide individualized and real-time information about the onset of stresses, and plant water, nutrient, and pesticide specific needs. There is also a need for integrative studies linking smart nanobiotechnology-based sensing, plant stress, resource deficit simulations and signal analysis with actuation of agricultural devices. The ethical implications of how smart nanobiotechnology devices could transform interactions between plants and machines should also be explored. Through recently developed nanomaterial-enabled gene delivery methods in leaves in planta22,23, genetically encoded sensors reporting plant health by inducing changes in plant pigments could be a pathway to allow farmers in undeveloped areas without access to electronics to judge plant health status by visual cues. Most of these technologies developed for smart plant sensors are not limited to agriculture and will likely be translatable to defence and environmental monitoring purposes.

Abstract This paper reviews agro-industrial and environmental applications that are using Internet of Things (IoT). It is motivated by the need to identify application areas, trends, architectures and open challenges in these two fields. The underlying survey was developed following a systematic literature review using academic documents written in English and published in peer-reviewed venues from 2006 to 2016. Selected references were clustered into four application domains corresponding to: monitoring, control, logistics, and prediction. Implementation-specific details from each selected reference were compiled to create usage distributions of sensors, actuators, power sources, edge computing modules, communication technologies, storage solutions, and visualization strategies. Finally, the results from the review were compiled into an IoT architecture that represents a wide range of current solutions in agro-industrial and environmental fields. Previous article in issue Next article in issue Keywords Internet of thingsIoTAgro-industryEnvironmental monitoringSystematic literature review 1. Introduction The widespread of Internet in the last two decades brought countless benefits to citizens and organizations around the world. Arguably the most important benefit was the ability to consume and produce data and services in real time. Recently, the Internet of Things is promising to bring the same benefits to everyday objects, giving us a way to extend our perception and our ability to modify the environment around us. In this context, agro-industrial and environmental fields are ideal candidates for the deployment of IoT solutions because they occur in wide areas that need to be continuously monitored and controlled. At the same time, IoT opens new opportunities beyond ground floor automation when the collected data are used to feed machine learning algorithms to provide predictions (Saville et al., 2015), easing decision planning and decision making for owners, managers, and policy makers. IoT can be used at different levels in the agro-industrial production chain (Medela et al., 2013). It can help to evaluate field variables such as soil state, atmospheric conditions, and biomass of plants or animals. It can also be used to assess and control variables such as temperature, humidity, vibration, and shock during the product transport (Pang et al., 2015). It can be used to monitor and predict the product state and its demand on shelves or inside refrigerators. In addition, it can provide information to the final user/consumer about the origin and properties of the product. The IoT applied to the agro-industry can contribute to create an informed, connected, developed and adaptable rural community. Under the IoT paradigm, low-cost electronic devices can improve human interaction with the physical world, and the computing power and software available on the Internet can provide valuable analytics. In summary, IoT can be an important tool in the years to come for people interacting within an agro-industrial system: suppliers, farmers, technicians, distributors, business men, consumers, and government representatives. IoT can be incorporated into environmental applications to produce dense and real-time maps of air and water pollution, noise level (Torres-Ruiz et al., 2016, Hachem et al., 2015), temperature, and harmful radiation among others. It can be used to collect and store environmental records, check the compliance of environmental variables with local policies, trigger alerts, or send recommendation messages to citizens and authorities (Liu et al., 2013). Once the data reach the cloud, governments can feed predictive models to forecast environmental variables, and identify and track pollution sources over time and space, ultimately leading to faster and better decisions to ensure a safe and healthy environment for all citizens. Based on the potential of IoT applications in agro-industrial and environmental fields described in the previous paragraphs, this paper aims to identify the current state of solutions in these fields, as well as the trends, architectures, technologies and open challenges. This paper uses a Systematic Literature Review (SLR) based on a methodology proposed by Kitchenham and Charters (2007), in order to make it unbiased in terms of information selection, processing, and presentation of results. The paper is structured as follows. Sections 2 Planning, 3 Conduction, 4 Results describe the stages of planning, conduction, and results of the SLR. Section 5 outlines some recent works that were published online after the SLR was concluded. Section 6 includes a discussion of the obtained results, and Section 7 presents the conclusions from this study. 2. Planning During this stage of the SLR, the protocol was defined. This included: research questions, search strategies, selection criteria, data mining and synthesis methodologies. For this study, the two research questions considered were: 1. What are the main technological solutions of the Internet of Things in agro-industrial and environmental fields? 2. Which infrastructure and technology are using the main solutions of IoT in agro-industrial and environmental fields? To collect information, authors performed an Internet search using various academic digital libraries and search engines. Obtained results were manually compiled in order to select the best information sources to answer the two research questions. After analyzing the results, digital libraries and search engines described in Table 1 were chosen based on their scientific and technical content, as well as their close relationship to areas of knowledge associated with the objective of this paper. Table 1. Information sources used for the search phase. Source Type URL IEEE Xplore Digital Library http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/Xplore/home.jsp Science Direct Digital Library http://www.sciencedirect.com/ ACM Digital Library Digital Library http://dl.acm.org/dl.cfm Citeseer library Digital Library http://citeseer.ist.psu.edu/advanced_search Sensors Digital Library http://www.mdpi.com/journal/sensors Scopus Search Engine http://www.scopus.com/ Microsoft Academic Search Search Engine http://academic.research.microsoft.com/ Microsoft Academic Search Engine https://academic.microsoft.com/ Google Scholar Search Engine https://scholar.google.com/ The next step was to define search terms and a consistent procedure to seek scientific and technical documentation in the digital libraries and search engines. To define the search terms, a set of keywords was selected from the research questions to create two groups of words which are shown in Table 2. Each group contained consolidated expressions with synonyms or terms with related meaning. Group 1 included words associated with the Internet of Things, while Group 2 contained a set of terms related to the agro-industry and environment. Logical operators supported by the advanced search of digital libraries were used to construct search strings, based on the two research questions, combining terms from Groups 1 and 2 of Table 2. The general structure of the search queries that were applied to the information sources is presented in Table 3. Table 2. Words used for the search query. Group 1: Internet of Things, Web of Things.  Group 2: Agricultural industry, Agricultural products, Agriculture, Agribusiness, Agroindustry, Air pollution, Apiculture, Aquaculture, Product Traceability, Smart Agriculture, Greenhouses, Harvesting, Horticulture, Husbandry, Irrigation, Livestock, Climate, Feeding, Fertilizers, Forestry, Weather, Animal production, Animal sensing, Animal tracking, Animal trade control, Avalanche, Bio-fuel, Biological production, Bio-monitoring, Breeding, Cereals, Crop, Dairy, Drones, Drought, Earthquake sensor, Environmental monitoring, Equipment status, Farm, Farming, Feed production, Fish, Fishery, Flooding, Food chain, Food production, Forecast, Forest fire, Freeze, Fruit, Fruit storage, Grassland, Heating, Landslide, Meat, Pest, Plant, Poultry, Seed, Vegetable, Waste, Water. Table 3. Algorithm: search query-(Group 1) AND (Group 2). TITLE-ABS-KEY (“Internet of Things” OR “Web of Things”) AND (“Agricultural industry” OR “Agricultural products” OR agriculture OR agribusiness OR agroindustry OR “Air pollution” OR “Apiculture” OR aquaculture OR “Product Traceability” OR greenhouses OR harvesting OR horticulture OR husbandry OR irrigation OR livestock OR climate OR feeding OR fertilizers OR forestry OR weather OR “Animal production” OR “Animal sensing” OR “Animal tracking” OR “Animal trade control” OR avalanche OR biofuel OR “Biological production” OR biomonitoring OR breeding OR cereals OR crop OR dairy OR drones OR drought OR “Earthquake sensor” OR “Environmental monitoring” OR “Equipment status” OR farm OR farming OR “Feed production” OR fish OR fishery OR flooding OR “Food chain” OR “Food production” OR forecast OR “Forest fire” OR freeze OR fruit OR “Fruit storage” OR grassland OR heating OR landslide OR meat OR pest OR plant OR poultry OR seed OR vegetable OR waste OR water) In order to ensure the quality of papers, only those that passed the following criteria were considered in the reviewing process. • Documents published in peer-reviewed conferences, peer-reviewed journals, papers from computer science or engineering organizations, patents, or technical reports. • Documents published in English. • Documents published between 2006 and 2016 (both years inclusive). If the main topic of a given paper was irrelevant or if it was outside the scope of this study, it was deleted. Then, a selection criterion was applied in order to reduce the number of papers found during the search and to get a small number of high-quality sources that could be used to answer the research questions. This involved using inclusion criteria (IC) and quality criteria (QC), which were defined in a three-phase process. • IC based on abstracts: in this phase, authors discarded papers found in the search stage based on the information provided in their abstracts. Papers that satisfied the first inclusion criterion were kept for further processing, i.e. papers that discussed IoT solutions applied to agro-industry and environment. Papers with little relevant information in their abstract were temporarily kept in the list and were processed in the next stage. It is important to highlight that quality criteria were not considered in this phase. • IC based on full reading: in this phase, papers that did not address the search terms shown in Table 2 were removed. This means that even though those papers contained the search terms in their abstract, they only represented minor aspects of them. • IC based on quality analysis: in this phase, a quality analysis was applied to remaining papers and those that did not comply any of the following four quality criteria (QC) were discarded: – QC1: Does the study present a comprehensive solution of IoT for agro-industry or environment? – QC2: Does the paper show details of the infrastructure and/or technologies used to implement the proposed solution? – QC3: Does the paper present a state of the art or related work? – QC4: Does the paper present an analysis of the results? The next stage of the SLR was data mining and synthesis. The goal here was to extract the information needed to answer the research questions in an objective manner. The information fields extracted for each study are presented in Table 4. Table 4. Form used to extract data for each study. Data retrieved Description Title Title of the main study Year Publication year of the study Institution Name of institution(s) leading the research Country Country that developed the research Source Conference, journal, or book containing the main study Solution Name of the IoT solution described Domain and subdomain Area of agro-industry or environment where IoT was applied Architecture model Description of the architecture used, its scope and limitation Sensors Information about sensor type and sensor count per node in the solution Power source Mechanisms used to power IoT devices Edge computing Information about computing platforms, hardware architecture, the number of nodes, topology (homogeneous vs. heterogeneous).

Conduction The protocol described in the previous section was used to search, select and evaluate preliminary papers. For the search process, the query defined in Table 3 was passed to information sources given in Table 1. The search was limited to title, abstract and keywords. Fig. 1 illustrates the conduction process discriminated by the academic database and search engine used, highlighting the key steps followed to select relevant studies for this review. Initially, 3578 studies were recovered from electronic databases. Firstly, duplicates were excluded, i.e. studies available in more than one database, eliminating 849 copies. Out of the 2729 remaining studies, 2652 were initially screened based on inclusion and exclusion criteria applied to the title, abstract, and keywords. These papers were marked to be downloaded, and references that could not be retrieved were discarded. Afterward, these studies were evaluated using quality criteria obtaining 720 studies. These studies were used to extract the data defined in Table 4. Finally, only 72 main studies were selected based on their quality for the final conduction phase and used to extract results presented in the next section.

It is worth to note that more than 90% of included papers were retrieved from two sources: IEEExplore (76.4%) and Scopus (13.9%). In contrast, the least effective sources of information were Microsoft Academic Search and Microsoft Academic. They retrieved 668 papers during the first stage of the conduction phase (representing 25.2% of all retrieved papers, and only behind IEEExplore with 45%). However, only 3.1% of them were included for the next reviewing phase, a number well below the 39.8% of papers included from IEEExplore. These facts can be explained because IEEExplore and Scopus have complete and usable advanced search systems and they have been operating continuously unlike Microsoft’s counterpart (Sinha et al., 2015a). Fig. 2 enumerates the number of primary studies classified by publication year. It can be seen that most of the selected papers were published between 2012 and 2016. It should be highlighted that the small number of papers shown in 2016 can be explained because the initial search was made in April of that year.

Results This phase presents results of the SLR in order to answer the two research questions based on the information extracted from main studies selected. 4.1. Answer to the first research question To identify the main technological solutions of IoT in agro-industry and environmental fields, studies were grouped into four technological domains, corresponding to: (1) monitoring, (2) control, (3) prediction and (4) logistics. Results are summarized in Table 5 and illustrated in Fig. 4. From this figure, it can be seen that most of the selected studies were focused on monitoring (62%), followed by control (25%), logistics (7%), and prediction (6%). Table 5.

Distribution of papers selected by application domain. Selected papers grouped in the monitoring domain dealt with remote sensing of physical and environmental parameters gathered in scenarios such as crops and farms using a Wireless Sensor Network (WSN). The main goal of this domain was the acquisition of information without an operator and its transmission to a server or data center for processing and visualization. Integrated monitoring tools made it possible to maintain a continuous communication with the deployed WSN, and access stored data through the Internet. Hence, smart agriculture based on IoT adds value to farmers by helping them to collect relevant data from crops and farms using sensor devices. Some IoT setups could display, process and analyze remote data applying cloud services in order to provide new insights and recommendations for better decision-making. IoT solutions categorized in monitoring domain can be divided into three architectural layers (Zou, 2014): (i) a perception layer supported by a WSN; (ii) a network layer where the sensor information travels a long distance using different protocols and Gateways, and (iii) an application layer that includes a web server and a database. Moreover, IoT solutions grouped in this domain are interested in monitoring several types of physical variables depending on the subdomain to which they belong. Specifically, the following subdomains were identified: air monitoring (34.5%), soil monitoring (27.3%), water monitoring (16.4%), plant monitoring (10.9%), and others (10.9%) which include areas such as aquaculture and animal monitoring. It is worth to highlight that most of the selected studies retrieved in this SLR can be categorized in more than one subdomain. For instance, the system proposed in Zou (2014) is used for online crop growth monitoring and it captures different types of variables such as: temperature, humidity, soil moisture, CO2, luminosity, pH of water, and images. Some representative examples of IoT applications categorized in the monitoring domain are described below. • Air monitoring: this subdomain aimed to provide periodic or continuous measurements, evaluating and determining environmental parameters or pollution levels in order to prevent negative and damaging effects. It also included the forecasting of possible changes in the ecosystem or the biosphere as a whole. For instance, in Watthanawisuth et al. (2009) authors described an agricultural IoT solution which can be categorized in the air monitoring subdomain. In this solution, authors proposed a real-time monitoring system of micro climate based on a WSN. The solution included temperature and relative humidity sensors (SHT15) powered by solar panels and supported by ZigBee communication technology. Another air monitoring IoT solution is GEMS (Lu et al., 2010), which proposed an environmental monitoring system based on GPRS technology for monitoring apple orchards. This system was tested on five different regions of China over a 2-year period by monitoring variables such as relative humidity, temperature, and radiation. • Soil monitoring: papers classified in this subdomain such as (Chen et al., 2014, Mafuta et al., 2012) proposed systems for monitoring multi-layer soil temperature and moisture in a farmland fields using WSN. These systems are supported by communication technologies such as ZigBee, GPRS and Internet, where user interaction with the system is handled by a web application. • Water monitoring: primary studies categorized in this subdomain intend to monitor water pollution or water quality by sensing chemicals, pH, and temperature, which can alter the natural state of water. An example of this subdomain is presented in Postolache et al. (2013), where authors proposed an IoT solution for water quality assessment through the measurement of conductivity, temperature, and turbidity. The solution is based on a WSN architecture that combines low-cost sensing devices and monitoring of multiple parameters of water quality of shallow waters (lakes, estuaries, rivers) in urban areas. Similarly, (Xijun et al., 2009) proposed a WSN system for monitoring water level and rainfall in irrigation systems. • Plant monitoring: The LOFAR-agro Project (Langendoen et al., 2006) is an example of plant or crop monitoring. This project aimed to protect a potato crop against phytophthora (a genus of water mold) by monitoring the microclimate (humidity and temperature) using a large-scale WSN. The system intended to generate a policy to protect the crop against the fungal disease based on the collected data. In Fourati et al. (2014), authors propose a Web-based decision support system communicating with a WSN for irrigation scheduling in olive fields. For this purpose, authors use sensors to measure humidity, solar radiation, temperature, and rain. • Animal monitoring: This subdomain referred to animal tracking for both wildlife and animal husbandry activities. A research belonging to this subdomain was a delay-tolerant WSN for the monitoring and tracking of six horses presented in Ehsan et al. (2012). For this purpose, authors developed necklaces that acquired information about horses’ position and speed at a given time, and transmitted such logs to fixed nodes when they were close to its coverage area. Another example of animal monitoring was given by Jain et al. (2008), where an IoT solution was responsible for monitoring the behavior and migration patterns of Swamp Deers, obtaining information of the animal position and the climate at the same time. Papers selected and grouped under the domain of control use remote actuator devices deployed on-site. Unlike monitoring domain applications, which handle information in one-way, applications categorized in control use a two-way information channel. This means that a new level of communication was added, and commands could be sent back to the field. In this case, information from the server or data center traveled to a Wireless Sensor and Actuator Network (WSAN) in order to control a set of actuator devices to modify the state of the process or environment. Commands were sent through a human–computer interface or as a result of a decision algorithm supported by analytic modules. Actuator devices included valves, pumps, humidifiers, and alarms among others. Many of these systems aimed to optimize the usage of water, fertilizers, and pesticides based on information provided by weather prediction systems and on-site WSN. Solutions in this domain could help farmers to reduce water consumption and waste by scheduling irrigation times and quantities according to the state of the crop and its growth cycle. Control systems were programmed to be adaptive, for instance, switching off sprinkler if rain was detected. Overall, solutions with control systems could save money to the farmer and provide at the same time valuable insights about the consumption of water, fertilizers, pesticides, and electricity. Actuator devices used by IoT solutions grouped in the control domain depended heavily on the subdomain to which they belonged. In this paper, the following subdomains were considered: irrigation (72.22%), fertilizers (5.56%), pesticides (5.56%), illumination (5.56%), and access control (5.56%). During the review, it was found that some studies used actuators in the domain of logistics (5.56%). Representative examples of IoT applications categorized in the control domain are described next. • Irrigation control: A precision irrigation solution based on wireless sensor network was proposed by Kanoun et al. (2014). The main challenge of that study was to create an automated irrigation system which could reduce water waste, saving energy, time, and money. This system was built using three nodes based on the TelosB mote: (i) a node to measure soil moisture and soil temperature; (ii) a node to measure environmental parameters such as air temperature, air humidity, wind speed and brightness; and (iii) a node that was connected to a valve for irrigation control. Data were transmitted to a base station for storage and were sent to the farmer’s PC to allow him to take action. Another precision irrigation IoT system was proposed by Jiao et al. (2014). This included an environmental monitoring system for agricultural management, as well as the implementation of precision dripping. The system considered an IoT ecosystem divided into three layers corresponding to sensing, transmission, and application. A WSN was used to perceive environmental information in real time within a tomato greenhouse, to later transmit the data to a remote server management system. In Shuwen and Changli (2015) researchers described a remote farmland irrigation monitoring solution based on ZigBee. The system included a solar-powered irrigation control system that also monitored air temperature, humidity and soil temperature. • Fertilizer and pesticide control: IoT solutions categorized in this subdomain applied conservation practices to improve nutrient usage, efficiency, crop quality, overall yield, and economic return while reducing off-site transport of nutrients. In Pahuja et al. (2013), authors developed an online micro-climate monitoring and control system for greenhouses. The system was supported by a WSN to gather and analyze plant-related sensor data to produce actions to control the climate, fertilization, irrigation, and pests. • Illumination control: authors in Yoo et al. (2007) described an automated agriculture system based on WSN for monitoring greenhouses used to grow melons and cabbages. The system monitored the growing process of crops and controlled the greenhouse’s environment. Some of the variables measured included ambient light, temperature, and humidity. For the greenhouse with melons, the system could control the illumination by changing the light state through a relay. • Access control: An agricultural intrusion detection system was presented in Roy et al. (2015). The proposed system generated alarms in the farmers house and sent a text message to the farmer’s mobile phone when an intruder entered the crop field. Selected papers categorized in the prediction domain were focused on providing knowledge and tools to farmers to support decision making. They had specific modules for these tasks in their architecture, and their predicted variables were grouped as follows: environmental conditions (42.86%), production estimation (42.86%), and crop growth (14.29%). • Environmental conditions: A representative example of environmental condition prediction is proposed in Khandani and Kalantari (2009), where authors described a design methodology to determine the spatial sampling of humidity sensors for the soil within a WSN. They used a historical database of dense soil-humidity measurements to determine the behavior of the 2D correlation that exists between the measurements of nearby sensors. This was used later to find the largest spatial sampling that ensured a user-defined variance for the estimation on any given point of interest in the space. Authors found that the spatial correlation function decays exponentially with the distance between sensors. Another example of the prediction of environmental conditions was presented in Luan et al. (2015), which described a system that integrates drought monitoring and forecasting as well as irrigation prediction using IoT. • Production estimation: Authors in Lee et al. (2013) presented an IoT-based agricultural production system for stabilizing supply and demand of agricultural products. They achieved this goal by sensing environmental variables and by developing a prediction system for the growth and yield of crops. In a different application, (Saville et al., 2015) introduced a real-time estimation system for fixed-net fishery using ultrasonic sensors and supervised learning. • Crop growth: a dynamic analysis of farmlands using mobile sensors was presented in Lee et al. (2012). The developed system aimed to establish growth-control plans for grapes, and viticulture activities. The last domain used to categorize selected studies was logistics. Logistics in agriculture refers to the physical flow of entities and related information from producer to consumer to satisfy consumer demand. It includes: agricultural production, acquisition, transportation, storage, loading and unloading, handling, packaging, distribution, and related activities. Some objectives of logistics in agriculture include: adding value to agricultural products, saving money in distribution costs, improving shipping efficiency, reducing unnecessary losses, and to some extent, avoiding risks (Liping, 2012). Primary studies in logistics were further divided in: production (55.6%), commerce (22.2%) and transport(22.2%). The next paragraphs include representative studies of each subdomain. • Production: in Feng et al. (2012) researchers proposed an intelligent system for monitoring an apple orchard that implemented suggestions based on data. The system aimed to reduce management costs of apple orchards, improve apple quality, and provide detailed, comprehensive and accurate electronic information for planting works, pest warnings, and production-quality tracking of apples. The system included WSN using Zigbee, GPRS, and IoT providing detailed monitoring data of apple growth for agricultural cooperatives, to support for decision making in farming. • Commerce: (Li et al., 2013) presented an information system for agriculture based on IoT which used a distributed architecture. In that study, tracking and tracing of the whole agricultural production process were made with distributed IoT servers. Moreover, an information-discovery system was designed to implement, capture, standardize, manage, locate, and query business data from agricultural production. The system also allowed consumers to query information of agricultural products to verify their authenticity and quality. • Transport: A representative example of this subdomain is presented in Pang et al. (2015), where an IoT architecture was proposed for the food-production and commercialization chain. This paper dealt with logistics involved in the transportation of melons from Brazil to Sweden in a journey that takes 46 days. Sensor nodes measured conditions in the environment including oxygen, carbon dioxide, ethylene, temperature, humidity, and mechanical stress, such as vibrations, tilts, and shocks. Fig. 5 summarizes the distribution of each application domain into its corresponding subdomains described in the previous paragraphs.

Answer to the second research question Infrastructure and technology used by selected IoT solutions in agro-industrial and environmental fields were organized in seven groups, corresponding to: (i) sensing variables, (ii) actuator devices, (iii) power sources, (iv) communication technologies, (v) edge computing technologies (Shi et al., 2016), (vi) storage strategies, and (vii) visualization strategies. • Sensing variables: about 26% of analyzed studies sense temperature, followed by humidity, physicochemical properties, and radiation with 16%, 11%, and 10%, respectively. Particularly, temperature and physicochemical sensors are distributed in all subdomains as it can be seen in Fig. 6. Similarly, 55% of sensors are used for air monitoring. Thus, air temperature and humidity, soil moisture and solar radiation, can be considered universal variables in agricultural applications.

Types of sensing variables collected in the monitoring domain. • Actuator devices: the distribution of actuators used in selected studies is shown in Fig. 7. It can be stated that there are far fewer actuator devices than sensors currently being used in these studies and that most of them are concentrated in applications of control and logistics. In fact, more than 60% of actuators reported were found in irrigation processes. Download : Download high-res image (223KB) Download : Download full-size image Fig. 7. Type of actuator device used. • Power sources: currently, most monitoring applications prefer rechargeable batteries connected to solar panels, which offer a simple but sustainable energy supply. In contrast, control applications that typically have demanding energy requirements prefer the electrical grid. These trends can be appreciated in Fig. 8. Recent power sources, such as electromagnetic or vibration harvesters were not found in selected studies showing that these approaches must mature and gain popularity for agricultural and environmental applications.

Power sources. • Communication technologies: Fig. 9 shows that most studies (40%) used Wireless Personal Area Network (WPAN) protocols such as Bluetooth and ZigBee, followed by Wireless Metropolitan Area Network (WMAN) with 36% of the studies mainly supported by cellular technologies (GPRS/GSM/3G/4G). Meanwhile, the near-field communication, which is relatively new, has started to emerge in some field applications.

Communication technologies. • Edge computing technologies: microcontroller platforms were chosen in more than half of the applications reviewed. Interestingly, Single Board Computers (SBC) are not yet appropriate for edge computing in IoT agricultural applications. The complete distribution of edge computing technologies is shown in Fig. 10.

Edge computing technologies. • Storage strategies: reviewing Fig. 11, it is clear that even though Cloud storage represents a key service for IoT systems, only 7.32% of selected studies used it. This shows that most researchers preferred their own data-storage implementation. Download : Download high-res image (78KB) Download : Download full-size image Fig. 11. Storage strategy. • Visualization strategies: Fig. 12 shows the distribution of three different visualization strategies: web, mobile and local, in four subdomains: monitoring, control, prediction, and logistics. It can be stated that web-based solutions were the preferred strategy to visualize reports in all subdomains of applications.

Most of the selected works do not address security issues explicitly and leave them on a side. However, some efforts in this domain were found. For instance, (Jardak et al., 2009) described the design of a WSN that implemented a RANdom SAmple Consensus (RANSAC) filter to eliminate inconsistent sensor-node data due to the presence of faulty or malicious nodes in the network. Sun et al. (2012) presented a dam monitoring system where users needed to sign in through the main interface in order to validate their credentials. Tao et al. (2014) selected AppWeb as the embedded Web server for the IoT Gateway of an intelligent granary management system because it could add the Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) protocol to enable encrypted data connection. This was valuable because the network information was vulnerable as it came from a wireless channel. Kuroda et al. (2015) proposed a WSN with easy-to-use secure communication that was implemented using Zero-admin encrypt/decrypt functions at the MAC level with the Advanced Encryption Standard (AES-128), which enabled automatic encryption/decryption of messages between each sensor node and the coordinator node. 5. Recent works The following paragraphs are devoted to introducing some recent and representative works that were available online between May 2016 and July 2017, beyond the initial scope of the SLR process described so far. They cover areas such as communications, energy management, monitoring and logistics for agro-industrial and environmental applications. 5.1. Communications Low-power WAN (LPWAN) technologies such as SigFox, LoRa, narrowband IoT and others are becoming popular within IoT applications due to its reduced energy requirements, wide coverage range, and low-cost when compared to other long-distance technologies according to Barrachina-Muñoz et al. (2017). For example, in a recent survey by Sinha et al. (2017), authors found that LoRa is the best option for smart agriculture applications. In Lukas et al. (2015), authors designed a long-range water level monitoring system for troughs using a WSN based on LoRa transceivers, allowing the cattleman to observe water availability for livestock even when the barn was 1 or 3 km away. In a different application, (Pham et al., 2016) proposed an IoT framework to contribute to rural development implementing agricultural applications supported by open-source hardware and long-range communication devices. The first deployment of this solution used LoRa transceivers since rural villages were located in remote areas and it was convenient to have a low-cost and non-proprietary infrastructure. 5.2. Energy management One of the main requirements for devices used in IoT projects is that they must be energy-efficient according to Borgia (2014). This is particularly important for pervasive solutions deployed outdoors that can not be powered from the electric grid nor regularly maintained because they are installed in difficult or remote environments. In WSN scenarios, the current challenge is to develop multi-source energy harvesters and ultra-efficient sensors to create battery-free solutions, (Shaikh and Zeadally, 2016). These considerations are very important for IoT solutions for agro-industrial and environmental problems as recharging batteries is not practical and ambient energy sources are usually available. In terms of smart energy control for IoT projects, (Wang et al., 2016) proposed a novel energy management strategy for solar powered devices that intend to power the load directly from the solar cell, avoiding power converters and energy storage elements that contribute to energy losses, greater weight/volume ratio, and higher price. Another trend that is likely to continue is the development of self-power devices, such as the soil water content sensor for an autonomous landslide surveillance system designed by Lu et al. (2016). In this case, the sensor used the soil moisture to power itself making it suitable for large scale deployments. Marjanović et al. (2016) described a cloud-based decision-making mechanism for managing sensor data acquisition that is applicable to collaborative sensing solutions using distributed sensors, like mobile devices, to efficiently monitor large geographical areas. The system selected which sensors had to upload the information to the cloud to prevent the acquisition of redundant information from other nearby sensors for a specific coverage area, maintaining a spatial sampling quality and reducing in this way the battery depletion of the devices. 5.3. Monitoring Recent environmental monitoring solutions are now offering additional capabilities in terms of decision making and management. For example, (Giorgetti et al., 2016) proposed a custom-made landslide risk monitoring system based on a WSN that allows fast deployments in hostile environments without human intervention because the system is able to deal with node failure and poor-quality communication links reorganizing the network by itself. Wong and Kerkez (2016) presented a Web service and real-time data architecture that includes an adaptive controller that updates the parameters of each sensing node within a WSN based on a previously defined policy. Zheng et al. (2016) proposed an IoT management system to protect the ecological and environmental quality while building an artificial river where nature and city converge. The system monitored key elements like soil, water, atmosphere, and wind at a high spatial resolution over a large area. Edwards-Murphy et al. (2016) introduced a beehive monitoring system that collects internal and external data to describe the status of the bee colony from a set of possible states using a classification algorithm based on decision trees. This information was used to determine if a visit to the beehive was required or not. As an additional result, authors found a strong correlation between the beehive status and the short-term rain forecast. Overall, this study is relevant for agriculture because crop pollination depends on honey bees. Sarangi et al. (2016) presented a framework for an automated crop-disease advisory service that integrates the interoperability of an IoT web repository with an agricultural advisory call center. The implemented system processes images of the diseased plant sent by the farmer, and then it provides the plant diagnosis and the corresponding management recommendation for the disease. 5.4. Logistics Food safety and quality control in logistics are emerging as IoT agribusiness areas in response to the demand from businesses and end consumers to obtain real-time information about food supply chain and “farm-to-fork” traceability. For instance, (Ruan and Shi, 2016) presented an IoT framework to assess the fruit freshness on e-commerce deliveries, which is a non-traditional retail service that faces unique challenges in transportation due to the product perishability and expensive logistics. Similarly, (Liu et al., 2016) introduced a pilot project using IoT to monitor food safety throughout the product life cycle, helping authorities and consumers to trace the food and make better decisions before buying it. In a related work, (Wang and Yue, 2017) proposed an early-warning system for food safety that automatically warns about product quality risks and incidents by sharing and centralizing information among supply chains. Lastly, (Capello et al., 2016) developed a business-to-business monitoring service based on IoT that provides geo-located information (humidity and temperature) about food storage and transportation without a vendor lock-in infrastructure. 6. Discussion 6.1. Limitations and open challenges After analyzing the difficulties and limitations described in selected papers from the SLR, the following list summarizes a few insights that aim to contribute to the mass adoption of IoT solutions in agricultural and environmental fields. • Stronger standardization: it will help to improve compatibility among different vendors and to ensure stronger security measures across the entire IoT stack, starting from field devices all the way up to cloud providers and end-user interfaces (Pang et al., 2015). • Better power management: it will increase the endurance of IoT solutions because nowadays the main factor limiting the lifespan of IoT deployments is energy depletion (Jain et al., 2008, Chen et al., 2014, Islam et al., 2014, Diedrichs et al., 2014). The lifespan can be improved by lowering the power consumption of each electronic module, including energy harvesters, and using alternative power storage mechanisms as replacements of rechargeable batteries, which affect the expiration date of deployed devices. • Security: a major challenge in the realization of the IoT in agriculture is the security problem (Jiang and Zhang, 2013), and the few works that consider it only incorporate fragmented strategies to mitigate it. Therefore, it is evident that there is a need for agro-industrial and environmental IoT solutions that address end-to-end information security and physical integrity of field devices. • Design using modular hardware and software: it will enable a greater degree of reuse and customization for the end user (Pang et al., 2015). • Improve unit cost: even though the cost of embedded computing platforms have been decreasing sharply, the same is not true for high-quality sensors and actuators. In order to deploy IoT solutions with hundreds and possibly thousands of nodes, the overall hardware, Internet access and international data roaming costs have to be reduced even further (Pang et al., 2015). • Aim for a good compatibility with legacy infrastructure: similarly to what has happened in industrial automation, it is important to deliver IoT solutions that can be integrated with the customer’s existing infrastructure such as specialized equipment, field machines, and software. • Consider scalability early on: with an increasing number of devices in large deployments, data synchronization and data reliability become critical (Diedrichs et al., 2014). • Adopt good practices of software engineering: as the scale and endurance of deployed IoT solutions grow, the time and effort devoted to analyzing generated data, refining the code, and adding new features will explode unless the software is well designed and documented (Hussain et al., 2006, Jayaraman et al., 2015a). • Improve robustness for field deployments: commercial IoT solution should be able to handle strong changes in temperature, humidity, and illumination to deal with seasonal changes and worldwide climate variability. • User-centered design: the installation and management of corresponding IoT nodes should be straight forward for non-expert users. Additionally, the hardware must require very little or none human maintenance during its lifespan, and the underlying communication network should be intelligent enough to reconfigure or heal itself in the case of a node failure. • Contribute to the IoT the ecosystem: there is a noticeable void in the literature on how to improve and adapt IoT solutions for real-world applications beyond simple prototypes (Chen et al., 2015). • Sustainable practices: even if the most humble predictions about the worldwide adoption of IoT devices become a reality, recycling strategies will have to be taken into account for new solutions deployed on the field, as an integral part of the product life cycle to reduce the environmental impact. 6.2. Proposed architecture To summarize the findings of this study, authors proposed the IoT architecture for agro-industrial and environmental applications that is illustrated in Fig. 13. This encapsulates most of the studies analyzed in this paper. The architecture has four main layers: physical, communication, service, and application. The physical layer includes perception and control. In perception, the main objective is to produce valuable data sensing field variables using a WSN. Data produced are sent to the communication layer through field gateways. Devices in the perception layer can be powered by batteries for short-term deployments or by solar panels because of their low-power consumption. In contrast, the control layer acts as a data sink, receiving information from a communication layer or a perception layer in the simplest case. Information received in the control layer alters the state of field actuators frequently requiring power from the electrical grid. In the middle of the perception and control layers there is a mobile robot that can be used when fixed devices are not the best option. In the communication layer, the objective is to move the information from the physical layer to the Internet, collecting data from IoT gateways based either on Ethernet or mobile networks (e.g: GPRS/3G/4G/NB-IoT and eventually 5G). This layer includes field gateways acting as interfaces between IoT gateways and transceivers using ZigBee, Bluetooth, NFC, WiFi, LoRA, or Sigfox. The service layer handles data ingestion from the communication layer, as well as their storage, analytics, visualization, and security. Finally, the application layer consumes services from the previous layer in the architecture and allows the user to handle monitoring, control, prediction, and logistics.

Conclusions This paper presented an updated review of IoT applications for agro-industrial and environmental fields. It was guided by a systematic literature review, and therefore the methodology and intermediate results obtained during the stages of planning, conduction, and results were reported in great detail. From 3578 initial studies extracted from electronic sources, 72 main studies were selected based on their relevance to answer two research questions. Selected studies came from five continents, and Asian countries contributed to more than half of them. During this study, it was discovered that most of the research still focuses on monitoring applications (62%); however there is a growing interest in closing the loop by doing control (25%), and there are some preliminary solutions in logistics and prediction (13%) for agro-industrial and environmental applications using IoT. The temperature and humidity of the air, as well as the soil moisture and solar radiation can be recognized as universal variables measured in agricultural applications based on selected studies. Similarly, actuators such as valves, pumps, motors, sprinklers, humidifiers, and lamps were widely used in irrigation, fertilization, pesticide management, and illumination control. It was also observed that new energy sources and Cloud storage have not been widely adopted, showing that there are opportunities for research and development in these areas. Studies included in this paper provide a compact view of solutions proposed for agro-industrial and environmental problems during the last decade. It was found that most of them relied heavily on heterogeneous components and wireless sensor networks. However, it seems reasonable to assume that future solutions will need to fully embrace Cloud services and new ways of connectivity in order to get the benefits of a truly connected and smart IoT ecosystem.

Autonomous, semi-autonomous, or manual platforms equipped with single or multiple sensors collect spatial and temporal data, resulting in massive amounts of data for analysis and storage. The enormous volume, variety, and velocity of HTP data generated by such platforms make it a ‘big data’ problem. Big data generated by these near real-time platforms must be efficiently archived and retrieved for analysis. The analysis and interpretation of these large datasets is quite challenging. Sophisticated data collection, storage, and processing are becoming ubiquitous, and newer areas of application are emerging constantly. One such relatively new domain is plant stress analytics. ML algorithms are a very promising approach for faster, more efficient, and better data analytics. ML being inherently multidisciplinary draws inspiration and utilizes concepts from probability theory, statistics, decision theory, optimization, and visualization. Most current applications of ML tools in plant sciences have focused on using a limited set of ML tools (SVM, ANN). A good understanding of which, when, and how various ML tools can be applied will be very informative to the plant community to leverage these ML tools. Advances in automated and high-throughput imaging technologies have resulted in a deluge of high-resolution images and sensor data of plants. However, extracting patterns and features from this large corpus of data requires the use of machine learning (ML) tools to enable data assimilation and feature identification for stress phenotyping. Four stages of the decision cycle in plant stress phenotyping and plant breeding activities where different ML approaches can be deployed are (i) identification, (ii) classification, (iii) quantification, and (iv) prediction (ICQP). We provide here a comprehensive overview and user-friendly taxonomy of ML tools to enable the plant community to correctly and easily apply the appropriate ML tools and best-practice guidelines for various biotic and abiotic stress traits. Previous article in issue Next article in issue Keywords high-throughput phenotypingmachine learningImagingplant breedingbiotic stressabiotic stress Plant Stress Phenotyping in Agriculture To meet the future demand of food, feed, fiber, and fuel, crop production must be doubled by 2050i Crop yields are limited inherently by plant stresses (biotic and abiotic), and plant breeders have protected yield from plant stress losses by incorporating resistance genes and developing more climatically-resilient cultivars. Plant breeders and researchers rely on plant phenotyping for accurate and precise trait collection and use of genetic tools to achieve their research goals. Plant phenotyping is defined as the application of methodologies and protocols to measure a specific trait, ranging from the cellular level to the whole plant or canopy level, related to plant structure and function [1]. Agriculture research programs phenotype large populations for several traits throughout the crop growth cycle. This challenge to phenotype multiple traits and large populations is exacerbated by the necessity of sampling multiple environments and growing replicated trials. Until recently, traditional methods of phenotyping have not kept pace with the available high-throughput genotyping tools. The bottleneck in phenotyping has driven intense efforts by the scientific community of agriculture researchers and engineers to adapt newer technologies in field phenotyping. A classic example is high-throughput phenotyping (HTP), which has unlocked new prospects for non-destructive field-based phenotyping in plants for a large number of traits including physiological, biotic (includes living factors such as fungi, bacteria, virus, insects, parasites, and weeds, etc.) and abiotic (includes non-living factors such as drought, flood, nutrient deficiency, and other environmental factors) stress traits 2, 3. Both ground and aerial HTP platforms, equipped with multiple sensors are being used in agriculture to measure multiple plant traits at varying growth stages rapidly, precisely, and accurately (Figure 1A, Key Figure). Examples of these HTP platforms include deployment in cotton (Gossypium hirsutum L.) [4], triticale (× Triticosecale Wittmack L.) [5], and maize (Zea mays L.) [6]. Recent advances in sensors for imaging plants 7, 8, ranging from remote sensing including spectroradiometry [9], Light Detection and Ranging (LIDAR) [10], visible to far-infrared [11], hyperspectral 12, 13, 14, 15, thermal 16, 17, fluorescence 16, 18, and 3D laser scanning [19] to trichromatic (RGB) [20] imaging in conjunction with advanced autonomous vehicles, have truly opened up the possibility of high-throughput stress phenotyping (HTSP). Autonomous platforms such as unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) [21] and ground robots [22] equipped with multiple sensors can take pictures in near real-time of the entire experimental plot several times per day, or over the entire season from germination to maturity, resulting in massive amounts of data for analysis and storage. Making sense of all these collected data can be done effectively using ML tools (see the supplemental information online). It is important to emphasize that for ML tools data can be collected from complex, integrated imaging platforms or from simple(r) methods such as crowd-sourced cell phone images.

Phenotyping Data and ML The enormous volume, variety, velocity, and veracity of imaging and remote-sensing data generated by such real-time platforms represent a ‘big data’ problem. The data generated by these near real-time platforms must be efficiently archived and retrieved for analysis. Although the analysis and interpretation of such (image-based) big data are challenging, the ensuing possibilities that can impact on agricultural production make it a promising approach for HTP and HTSP. ML approaches present a scalable, modular strategy for data analysis, especially for the new application domain of ‘plant stress analytics’. Recent studies on HTSP using images obtained from UAV-based platforms to detect weeds in wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) [23], maize [21], and sunflower (Helianthus annuus L.) [24] using ML algorithms have paved a new path for better stress management practices on spatial and temporal basis. ML is an inherently multidisciplinary approach to data analysis that draws inspiration, and borrows heavily, from probability theory, statistics, decision theory, visualization, and optimization. ML approaches are typically useful in situations where large amounts of data are available, relating inputs (e.g., image data) to output quantities of interest (e.g., stress phenotypes). One of the major advantages of using ML approaches for plant breeders, pathologists, physiologists, and biologists is the opportunity to search large datasets to discover patterns and govern discovery by simultaneously looking at a combination of factors instead of analyzing each feature (trait) individually. This was previously a major bottleneck because the high dimensionality of individual images (coupled with the huge number of such images) makes them extremely difficult to analyze through classical techniques. Another key challenge is that the underlying processes for linking the inputs to the outputs are too complex to model mathematically. This is particularly the case for plant stress phenotyping, where it is challenging to efficiently model the holistic effect of genetic, agronomic, economic, meteorological, and human factor inputs on stress and, ultimately, yield. ML methods have been applied with spectacular results to similar problems [25] previously presumed to be impossible to model. Examples include numerous success stories in various domains ranging from computer vision (e.g., face recognition), speech processing (e.g., Google voice, Apple's Siri) and natural language processing (e.g., IBM Watson), consumer predictive analytics (e.g., Netflix movie recommender system) to bioinformatics (e.g., personalized genomics, drug design, and genome annotation) [26], cell biology [27], and disease tissue classification in medicine 28, 29. The success of ML tools is attributed to their ability to identify a hierarchy of features and generalized trends from available data. These tools have also proved particularly adept at integrating disparate and often redundant data to draw coherent (and often non-intuitive) patterns for identification and quantification. Finally, current progress in ML has resulted in scalable, robust, and flexible software tools (R packages, Matlab toolboxes, and software packages such as Theano, Caffe for archetypal ML algorithms) 30, 31, 32, 33 that make the application of ML to disparate disciplines straightforward. The advances have percolated into agricultural research, where there has been an increasing research effort to apply ML approaches in diverse species, such as horticultural crops and forest tree species. This has been driven in part by the increased investment by commercial companies and the decreasing cost of imaging/sensor platforms. ML-Enabled HTSP In light of these developments, it is clear that ML-enabled HTSP will benefit plant breeders, physiologists, entomologists, pathologists, extension workers, and farmers by allowing screening of different stresses in an accurate, precise, and speedy manner (Table 1). This will also directly enable the acceleration of the gene discovery process as well as the introduction of novel selection protocols for complex quantitative traits such as biotic and abiotic stresses and yield. ML-enabled HTSP will also enhance our understanding of pathogen–plant interactions [34] as well as the interaction of plants with other stresses. Table 1.

ML refers to a group of computerized modeling approaches that can learn patterns from the data so as to make automatic decisions without programming explicit rules. The main idea of ML is to effectively utilize experiences or example scenarios to discover underlying structures, similarities, or dissimilarities present in data to explain or classify a new experience or an example scenario properly. A key ability of ML tools is their ability to generalize trends and/or patterns from available data. There are a large number of choices of ML tools. It is important for an application expert to make a judicious choice on a specific ML method to deploy for his/her specific problem. We advocate that the practitioner should (carefully) down-select from the plethora of ML choices based on the type and amount of available data and problem formulation. In the context of plant stress phenotyping, we identify four distinct classes of problem formulation: (i) identification/detection, (ii) classification, (iii) quantification/estimation, and (v) prediction (Figure 1B,C). Furthermore, preprocessing steps such as dimension reduction, clustering, and segmentation can also be crucial for successful decision-making. Structure of a ML Process Typically, a large fraction of the dataset, known as the ‘training dataset’, that represents the entire population is used for calibrating the model. The remaining dataset is used to test the calibrated model, and is termed the ‘testing dataset’. The next step after training is to validate the learnt model on a new set of data (from different or same population). Once the accuracy and precision of the model is high enough, it can be used on a routine basis to identify, classify, quantify and predict particular stress features. We discuss this process in greater detail next, particularly focusing on clarifying the choice of ML tools to use based on two different points of view, namely the learning process (how are features learnt) and the modeling objective (what is being learnt). The Learning Process – Supervised versus Unsupervised The first point of view concerns whether or not the ML model is provided with the labels to the data it uses for model training. Here, a label is a trait (such as diseased plant or type of crop plant) that is associated with an image. For example, suppose the objective of a ML model is to distinguish between maize, soybean [Glycine max (L.) Merr.], and sunflower plants after collecting a large number of images. If the model is trained with a set of such images where each is labeled as soybean, maize or sunflower, the learning process is termed ‘supervised’. Alternatively, if the training images are provided without any label, the learning process is ‘unsupervised’. Note that although some ML tools can be trained either in a supervised or an unsupervised manner, some can be trained in both ways. With the supervised learning process, a model essentially tries to learn a map between the input dataset and the corresponding output labels. For the given example, it means that a model trained in a supervised manner learns how to map all the soybean examples to the soybean label, and so on. Support vector machines (SVM) and regular artificial neural networks (ANN) are among the prominent examples of supervised schemes. By contrast, an unsupervised method does not have specific output labels associated with input images. It identifies structures or features present in the images, such as the presence of tassels in maize, or the presence of trifoliate leaves in soybean. In many cases, the features identified in the unsupervised process may not be meaningful to a human user. Various clustering, mixture models, and dimension-reduction techniques fall under this category. Often ML models can be developed by using partly labeled data. This training scheme is known as ‘semi-supervised’ learning. The Modeling Objective – Generative versus Discriminative A second point of view for ML method categorization is the modeling objective: whether the model being trained is to distinguish between two different data patterns or to be able to learn and generate similar patterns synthetically. In the context of the previous example, a maize and soybean plant can be distinguished based on the presence or absence of tassels or pods. A model developed with only this difference would be termed a ‘discriminative model’. Naturally, many supervised methods such as SVM and ANN fall under this category. However, such a model does not learn other features of the objects. Thus, a discriminative model that distinguishes a soybean plant from a maize plant based on the presence of tassels fails to differentiate between an image of a maize plant and that of sorghum [Sorghum bicolor (L.) Moench] plant. Therefore, a discriminative model is typically built for a predetermined specific task. On the other hand, a model that captures the overall data pattern such that it is able to generate synthetic images is known as a ‘generative model’. It follows that a single generative model can be useful for many decision tasks at the same time. Mixture models, hidden Markov models, and Boltzmann machines are prominent examples of generative models. Given a large volume of data, discriminative models usually perform better than generative models, especially for classification tasks, such as distinguishing images of soybean plants from a maize plant. However, generative models can achieve slightly better performance compared to discriminative ones with low training data volume. In addition, generative models tend to be more robust to overfitting issues (i.e., a model learns training data too well and performs very poorly for unseen test data). Figure 1D schematically illustrates the categorization of several ML methods into classes of generative versus discriminative, and supervised versus unsupervised. Although it seems that supervised models are more likely to be discriminative in nature, and generative models should not need output labels for training, there are examples of unsupervised discriminative models and supervised generative models. For example, the widely popular K-means clustering technique usually follows an unsupervised training scheme. Even so, it is not possible to generate new data examples reliably using only the cluster centers and groupings. Most of the unsupervised generative techniques can be learned in a supervised manner when the target class information is incorporated as one of the data features. Apart from such variations (as shown in Figure 1D), many of the ML tools have minor variations based on particular aspects such as underlying model structure (e.g., linear vs nonlinear) and training algorithm. The Role of Preprocessing in ML-HTSP The crucial step for the successful deployment of ML methods is careful preprocessing of the image data. There are multiple examples where a careful choice of preprocessing of the collected image datasets has resulted in substantial improvements in ML performance. Preprocessing can vary from very simple operations including image cropping, contrast enhancement, and removal of background to significantly more complex operations such as clustering and dimensionality reduction using principal component analysis (PCA). However, the overarching principle of preprocessing the data is ‘concentration of information’. That is, the original datasets may contain a large quantity of unnecessary or conflicting information that can result in poor ML performance. By preprocessing, the signal-to-noise ratio (ratio of useful to useless information) is improved. This directly enhances the ability of the ML model to easily recognize useful patterns or trends and to separate the data into appropriate classes. Preprocessing is the stage where domain knowledge is crucial. The domain expert identifies features in the image that are relevant or important for training the model. For example, the removal of background (soil, dirt, and tags, etc.) from the foreground to identify the plant canopy is generally a crucial step. Following this, a variety of image processing tools can be used to convert these raw datasets into a more relevant dataset that contains the extracted features. Examples of preprocessing operations include: (i) segmentation of images; (ii) contrast enhancement to detect edges; (iii) thresholding images into binary data; (iv) converting one image format into other [RGB to greyscale; RGB to hue saturation value (HSV)]; (v) de-noising images using filters [band-pass, low-pass, fast Fourier transform (FFT)]; (vi) extracting features at different scales using image transforms (FFT, wavelet transforms, Haar transforms, Hough transforms, Radon transforms); (vii) pixel-based classification; (viii) clustering of images into classes; and (ix) dimensionality reduction of images. Several of the ML tools discussed here can in fact be applied to these preprocessing stages. There are several examples of the utility of such preprocessing steps. For early site-specific weed management (ESSWM) in wheat, a UAV-based platform was equipped with a visible-range camera to capture ultra-high resolution images. Otsu's thresholding method was then used to differentiate wheat crop plants from weeds [23]. In sunflower, a quadrocopter equipped with RGB and multispectral sensors was used to detect weeds to optimize herbicide application. A pixel-based classification approach was used for weed identification. Similarly, image segmentation 21, 24, 35 followed by automatic object-based image analysis (OBIA) was used in sunflower and maize to identify spatial and spectrally consistent objects. ML Approaches to ICQP Identification of Stress Identification methods involve detection of a specific stress amid other potential stresses in the field. Here, preprocessing of image data is crucial. This is especially important for applications involving high-throughput imaging, where plant stressors (such as weeds, nutrient, disease, and insects) must be automatically identified. In the past, ML methods such as SVM, neural networks (NNs), kernel methods, and instance-based approaches have been used to detect various stresses. The SVM method has been used successfully in a variety of scenarios for stress identification in plants. SVM Methods SVM methods have been applied to a variety of plants for disease and stress identification. They are deployed in the citrus industry to contain citrus greening (caused by phloem-limiting bacteria), also known as Huanglongbing (HLB). Early identification is crucial for effectively controlling the spread of HLB. ML was used for the identification and estimation of HLB based on fluorescence imaging spectroscopy data of leaf samples [36]. The images were preprocessed (segmented) and the extracted features were used as an input to SVM. In another example, two aerial imaging platforms were compared for the identification of HLB diseases in an infected citrus orchard. An aircraft sensing platform equipped to capture hyperspectral images and a UAV platform equipped with a multiband imaging camera were used, and images obtained from both platforms were segmented and piped to a SVM classifier. Results showed that a (non-linear) SVM with kernel worked better than (linear) SVM, LDA, and QDA [37]. Similarly, in sugar beet (Beta vulgaris L.), early identification of three diseases, Cercospora leaf spot, leaf rust, and powdery mildew, was performed using SVM with a radial basis function as kernel [38]. The same idea was deployed in cotton to identify damage by green stink bug, bacterial angular blight, and Ascochyta blight using a SVM classifier [39], as well as in tomato (Solanum lycopersicum L.) to identify viruses: tomato yellow leaf curl virus and tomato yellow leaf curl disease [40]. SVM (combined with a Gaussian process classifier) was used for the automatic identification of soil moisture stress using remote visible and thermal images in spinach canopies, where the efficacy of using a combination of methods was explored. In another study, visible and thermal imaging were combined with depth information to automatically identify powdery mildew of tomato plants at an early growth stage using a SVM classifier kernel [31]. Variants of the SVM method have also proven to be useful for identification. In rice (Oryza sativa L.], the hierarchical identification of nutrient deficiency symptoms using scanned images was carried out using support vector feature selection (SVFS). Hierarchical identification was able to detect the NPK (nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium) stress effectively with enhanced identification accuracy [41]. Artificial Neural Nets (ANN) and Variants Simple image processing, followed by ANN, was used for detecting and identifying three orchid seedling diseases: bacterial soft rot, bacterial brown spot, and Phytopthora black rot [42]. Discriminant Analysis Spectral reflectance data were recorded from healthy and HLB-infected citrus leaves, and various classifier methods (discriminative and supervised methods) were used to identify infected leaves using quadratic discriminant analysis (QDA), linear discriminant analysis (LDA), and k-nearest neighbor (k-NN) and soft independent modeling of class analogy (SIMCA) [43]. In sugar beets, hyperspectral canopy reflectance was used to identify stress symptoms instigated by beet cyst nematode and Rhizoctonia crown and root rot [44]. Gaussian Mixture Models Preprocessing followed by the application of Gaussian mixture models has been used to identify both biotic and abiotic stresses [45]. Canopy images were taken in a stressed wheat field, at differential levels of irrigation (abiotic stress) and inoculated with wheat streak mosaic virus (biotic stress). K-means Clustering and Variants Water and nutrient stress at the crop canopy level have been studied using hyperspectral images that were analyzed using simplex volume maximization (SiVM), an unsupervised clustering approach. The SiVM algorithm was found to be adept at detecting drought stress using hyperspectral images four days before the appearance of symptoms visible to the human eye. The unsupervised nature of SiVM also provided useful new insights into the data 11, 25. Dimensionality Reduction and Clustering The automatic extraction of hyperspectral signatures using the Bayes factor algorithm with Dirichlet-aggregation regression (DAR) resulted in rapid, reliable, and data-driven approach for phenotyping plants for both biotic and abiotic stresses [11]. In barley (Hordeum vulgare L.), the DAR algorithm was used for the presymptomatic prediction of drought stress at an early stage using hyperspectral images [46]. Self-Organizing Map (SOM) and Bayes Classifier Both supervised (Bayesian classifier) and unsupervised (SOM) ML approaches were used for segmenting diseased tomato plants. Diseased regions on the tomato canopy were identified using the preprocessed tomato images by a SOM model [20]. Classification of Stress Classification is an extension of identification; however, instead of identifying a particular stress amid different stresses, a classifier is used to classify stress into labeled classes on the basis of stress symptoms and signatures. Classification methods often include a preprocessing step, usually a segmentation step followed by the extraction of features that feed into some type of classifier. For instance, drought stress can be classified into: no stress, moderate stress, and heavy stress. Examples from various crops are presented below illustrating the use of classification algorithms in various stresses. ANN A combination of K-means clustering followed by ANN, using fused information from RGB and multispectral camera imaging, was used to develop a 3D model of leaves to differentiate the two sugar beet diseases, Cercospora beticola and Uromyces betae [47]. In another example, thermal and hyperspectral imaging were analyzed to identify and classify symptoms caused by three Alternaria species in the oilseed brassica. The majority of the available classifiers present in Weka (useful data-mining software in java) were tested, and eight classifiers were used to make comparisons. The back-propagation neural networks (BNNs) classification model displayed the highest prediction accuracy for classifying Alternaria species [48]. SVM A SVM-based method was used to classify healthy and unhealthy Arabidopsis plants on the basis of symptoms instigated by colonization of the human pathogen Salmonella Typhimurium [49]. The SVM model was comprehensively tested on 1200 individual Arabidopsis plants with positive results [50]. In further work, classification error was reduced using SVMs compared to other ML methods such as decision trees and ANNs. The classification accuracy of three sugar beet diseases increased with increasing disease severity. This is especially true when hyperspectral reflectance-based vegetation indices were used with SVM for the automatic classification of disease severity of three sugar beet diseases (Cercospora leaf spot, leaf rust, and powdery mildew). Another example of the usefulness of SVM was the identification and classification of stonefly larvae from images. Haar random forest feature extraction, in combination with SVM classifier, was able to differentiate and classify stonefly larvae from other insect species [51]. LDA, K-Means, and Coupled Methods ML methods were used to classify the presence of aflatoxins, which are toxic compounds produced by fungus Aspergillus flavus and Aspergillus parasiticus [52]. Fluorescence (UV illumination) and reflectance (halogen excitations) were used as input data in this case. Preprocessing was performed to extract features using Guyon's SVM-RFE, classical Fisher discriminant power, and PCA. These extracted features were used as inputs to classifiers such as LDA (linear discriminant analysis) and MLP. Another paper classified the RGB images into ‘healthy’ and ‘injured’ classes of clover plants that were exposed to varying level of ozone. Various pixel-classifying methods were compared such as LDA, K-means clustering, FPM-T2 (fit to a pattern multivariate image analysis combined with T2 statistics), and FPM-RSS (FPM combined with residual sum of squares statistics) [53]. Quantification of Stress There are fewer reports describing the use of ML approaches to quantify stresses, and this provides tremendous opportunities for plant scientists and breeders. Quantification methods are an extension of classification methods where each class is quantified on the basis of stress severity. In case of plant diseases, disease severity [54] can be used to quantify various diseases. For example, rust severity in wheat can be quantified on a scale of 0–100% [55]. Quantification algorithms are usually best preceded by a preprocessing stage to separate foreground from background, edge detection, and contrast enhancement. A good example of the benefit of preprocessing of images for quantification is illustrated in [56] where color mapping (converting from native RGB to other non-native formats such as HSV) followed by segmentation was used to quantify disease severity of PHYVV (pepper huasteco yellow vein virus) on chili pepper (Capsicum annuum L.) plants. Examples from various other crops are presented next. SVM Leaf miner pest causes major losses in vegetable and ornamental plants. SVM applied to near-infrared spectral reflectance using spectrophotometer and digital leaf images of tomato plants of damaged leaves was used to successfully quantify damage degree (DD) into five levels [57]. Automatic detection method was used to detect and quantify Verticillium wilt (VM) on a large scale in olive using hyperspectral sensor and thermal camera mounted on aircraft. The spatial distribution of VM was assessed at field level and severity classes (0–4 rating scale quantified into 0–100% severity level) predicted by LDA and non-linear SVM methods. Both ML methods showed good results in detecting and quantifying VM severity in olives (Olea europaea L.) [58]. Prediction of Stress The prediction of plant stress at an early stage before it is visible to the human eye has substantial implications for the timely and cost-effective control of stress. There are very few reported activities on using ML for the prediction of stresses, making this the next big frontier for research efforts. This has tremendous implications for prescription farming and precision agriculture. SVM In predicting rice blast disease, SVM was used for the development of a weather-based prediction model [59]. The performance of the SVM-based approach was compared to the ANN variants; back-propagation neural network (BPNN) and generalized regression neural network (GRNN), and also to conventional multiple regression. The SVM-based approach outpaced all the three methods in cross-location and cross-year models, indicating their role in early forecasting of plant diseases. Other examples include the prediction of drought-induced stress in barley using hyperspectral images using an SVM variant, ordinal classification approach [60]. In barley for the presymptomatic detection of water stress, DAR algorithm was used on images obtained using hyperspectral camera. The DAR algorithm was efficient in predicting stress before symptoms were visible to human eye [46]. Strategies for the Development of Efficient ML Applications in Plant Breeding ML methods can play an extensive role in breeding for stress tolerance and for rapid phenotyping. These approaches can be used in decision-making for parent selection to use in hybridization schemes, and in generation advancement and selection. An example of an application using ICQP is presented below. Identification Use HTP platform [UAV, unmanned ground vehicle (UGV)] for taking images of breeding plots in plant stress nurseries, and yield tests. Perform image processing and apply ML algorithms. ML identifies which stress is present in each breeding plot. Classification Use ML approaches to classify stress in each breeding plot. For instance, determine if a genotype is resistant or susceptible to a particular stress. This information can be directly used in a breeding decision scheme to select stress resistance genotypes. Quantification Use ML approaches to quantify the stress. For example, quantification may be on a 0–100% scale of expression, such as percent infection severity. Use the information generated by ML approach through quantification to make selections to identify stress-resistant genotypes for further testing or commercialization. Prediction Use ML approaches on prior disease and weather data to make early stage prediction on the expression of stresses for breeding and selection decisions. In addition to plant stresses, advances have been made in analyzing other traits using ML to predict yield 61, 62, 63, biomass 64, 65, root traits 66, 67, and adaptation traits [68]. Concluding Remarks and Outlook ML tools provide a very powerful framework to assimilate data, and the utility of these tools is especially important considering current progress in HTP approaches that easily generate terabytes of data. Appropriate choice and usage of ML tools is crucial for obtaining the maximum possible benefits of these sophisticated approaches. This review provides a comprehensive overview of ML alongside best practices of using these ML tools to enable stress phenotyping (Box 1, Box 2). Using advanced ML tools for plant stress phenotyping is a very new area, with the plant community focusing on a small number of ML methods (such as SVM and ANN). As part of this review, we have identified several future avenues for using ML techniques that show tremendous promise but remain currently unutilized by the phenotyping community (see Outstanding Questions). Furthermore, the concepts discussed here can be applied to data collected across the spectrum of complexity and sophistication (from manually captured camera imaging to automated high-throughput imaging systems), as well as scale (from individual plant to plot to field). Box 1 Key Take-Away Points for Practitioners Identification (i) A large variety of ML methods have been successfully applied to the disease identification problem. This is an area where preprocessing of images will be very useful. (ii) There are two ways to frame a disease identification problem for ML based on the amount of data available. (a) When statistically significant nominal (healthy) and diseased datasets are available, it is best to use supervised discriminative models that are trained to distinguish between these classes. (b) In the absence of a statistically significant amount of data (or unbalanced data, see next point below), the best approach is to learn the nominal model of the un-diseased plant (which is feasible due to the availability of data of the healthy plant) using unsupervised methods. Then simple outlier detection can be deployed to identify off-nominal (or diseased) cases. (iii) We strongly encourage practitioners to refrain from training disease identification models using very small datasets. It is especially important to be vigilant against unbalanced data for training where one state (usually, the healthy state) has much more data instances than the other diseased states.  Classification (i) We encourage the practitioner to ensure the statistical significance of the available dataset. (ii) Preprocessing of data is crucial, as is using domain knowledge. (iii) Current trends are to always use supervised methods, which are mostly discriminative. (iv) Be vigilant against the overfitting problem. A best practice is to always ensure that regularization option is turned on in any ML method. (v) It is important to note that these methods can only distinguish between known/trained classes. They cannot be deployed to identify unknown/untrained symptoms (so-called extrapolatory mode). (vi) We encourage practitioners to extract and report detection confidence out of the classifier.  Quantification (i) There are very few reported applications of ML for stress quantification, and this provides tremendous opportunities for plant scientists and breeders. Most current work formulates the quantification problem as a classification problem with finer resolution. (ii) Our recommendation is that unsupervised generative models can be very successful for quantification. This can also work with smaller datasets. The basic idea is to learn the nominal (healthy state) model. The severity of the diseased state is quantified as the distance/offset from this nominal state. (iii) We strongly recommend practitioners to explore the use of Bayesian networks, deep neural nets, and latent Dirichlet allocation for this class of problems.  Prediction (i) Most prediction applications of ML are limited to early detection of disease onset. (ii) Current phenotyping approaches can be extended to obtain time-varying traits. Here, more sophisticated models can be used with great utility. Examples include HMM methods, dynamic Bayesian networks, and recurrent neural networks. Box 2 Precision Phenotyping Using ML Algorithms in Agriculture: Best Practices Advances in technology have made HTSP feasible. Appropriate ML tools can be used for all four stages (stress identification, classification, quantification, and prediction). High-throughput image-based phenotyping of plant stress-related traits to complement high-throughput sequencing will assist in finding new genes and quantitative trait loci (QTLs) using linkage mapping and genome-wide association studies (GWAS) together with training genome-wide selection models for various plant stress traits [74]. Specifically, the high-throughput phenotypic information on a particular stress can be used in association with genotypic information by means of QTL 75, 76, GWAS 77, 78, or expression studies to bridge the genotype–phenotype gap. Relating time-series phenotypic data with time-series gene expression may provide novel insights into cellular mechanisms. Time-series image data 79, 80 obtained in experiments using HTP platforms such as UAVs and autonomous rovers (ground robots), integrated into a viable ML pipeline, will allow the study of the time-dependent gene turn-on and turn-off mechanisms and provide insight into the molecular basis of disease resistance. HTP can also be used for phenotyping different fields for the same stress to understand the spatiotemporal difference in the expression of stress. The big advantage of ML algorithms is that plant scientists can use them proficiently in stress identification, classification, quantification, and prediction using tools packaged in the graphical user interface (GUI) without knowing the underlying mathematical and computational complexities. We advocate the following best practices for maximizing the effectiveness of ML tools: ML for Practitioners It is useful to identify which type of ML method is best suited by triaging the ML methods based on amount of data available as well as the type of data (labeled vs unlabeled). Figure 1C,D will be beneficial for this purpose. Discriminative methods work better for labeled and large datasets, while generative methods work better for smaller datasets (both labeled and unlabeled). It may be worthwhile for practitioners to explore the use of generative unsupervised models as a means to identify latent features from datasets. This is an area that is relatively unexplored, but holds great promise. Preprocessing is where domain knowledge can be leveraged to improve the signal-to-noise ratio in the data. For ML methods that are classified as discriminative and supervised, the use of preprocessing before deploying ML tools is essential to substantially improve ML performance. In cases where it is difficult to translate domain knowledge into feature crafting, unsupervised preprocessing methods should be explored. This may be particularly useful for high-dimensional data such as hyperspectral data. The outlook for ML tools in agriculture is very promising. A key ingredient for successful large-scale application of ML is the seamless integration of data analytics within the data collection and curation pipeline. Such a computational ecosystem (that links data collection, data storage, and curation with ML-based data analytics) will open up tremendous opportunities to accelerate breeding and to solve foundational problems in genomics and predictive phenomics. Promising examples of this vision include the Integrated Analysis Platform (IAP) [69] and the i-Plant nitiativeii A crucial catalyst for such advances will be to foster multidisciplinary research teams such that advances in engineering, plant sciences, and informatics can be leveraged in a rational way. This review will enable such teams by providing a common language of communication related to ML tools. Outstanding Questions Can causal ML models, deployed on time-series of images, identify visual precursors to enable early detection of stress response? ML methods lead to data-driven discovery of non-intuitive patterns. How can these hierarchical patterns be visualized and then physiologically interpreted by domain scientists? Advanced supervised ML methods tend to require labeling a large volume of training data. Can methodologies such as mechanical turking, crowd sourcing, and gamification be used to create a large corpus of community-labeled data? Future phenotyping efforts will be characterized by heterogeneous (visual/non-visual), multiscale (plant/plot/field), asynchronous data collected by a variety of sensors connected via the internet of things (IOT). How to develop best practices for a robust, scalable, and integrated ML pipeline that enables seamless assimilation? The ICQP paradigm comprehensively characterizes the spectrum of problems in plant stress phenotyping, thus enabling the design and deployment of appropriate ML tools. How can this paradigm be applied to other problems in plant biology, such as physiogenetic drivers of yield, and soil microbiome–plant root interaction studies?

of these resources, it is vital to make cities greener and more sustainable. Advanced 
systems to improve and automate processes within a city will play a leading role in smart 
cities. From smart design of buildings, which capture rain water for later use, to intelligent 
control systems, which can monitor infrastructures autonomously, the possible
improvements enabled by sensing technologies are immense. Ubiquitous sensing poses
numerous challenges, which are of a technological or social nature. This paper presents an
overview of the section on sensing in smart cities. It is organized as follows: Sections 2 and 3 review
the current state of sensing and enabling technologies, respectively. In Section 4 existing sensing
platforms for smart cities are discussed, and in Section 5 sensing applications in smart cities are
discussed. Some ongoing and future pilot projects for smart cities are described in Section 6. 
Challenges and future directions are discussed in Section 7, and the paper is concluded in Section 8.

A smart city is a city which functions in a sustainable and intelligent way, by integrating all its 
infrastructures and services into a cohesive whole and using intelligent devices for monitoring and
control, to ensure sustainability and efficiency [1]. In a world where population numbers are constantly
rising, significantly driving the consumption of resources causing resource shortages and climate
change, the incentive for innovative solutions is evident. Urban areas, in particular, are responsible for
the major part of resource consumption, instigating an increasing need to create smarter infrastructures,
which are more resource efficient and technology driven, are necessary. Solutions to these issues comprise
of improvements to a majority of components of urban dynamics, as illustrated in Figure 1.

Abstract: In a world where resources are scarce and urban areas consume the vast majority 
of these resources, it is vital to make cities greener and more sustainable. Advanced 
systems to improve and automate processes within a city will play a leading role in smart 
cities. From smart design of buildings, which capture rain water for later use, to intelligent 
control systems, which can monitor infrastructures autonomously, the possible 
improvements enabled by sensing technologies are immense. Ubiquitous sensing poses 
numerous challenges, which are of a technological or social nature. This paper presents an 
overview of the state of the art with regards to sensing in smart cities. Topics include 
sensing applications in smart cities, sensing platforms and technical challenges associated 
with these technologies. In an effort to provide a holistic view of how sensing technologies 
play a role in smart cities, a range of applications and technical challenges associated with 
these applications are discussed. As some of these applications and technologies belong to 
different disciplines, the material presented in this paper attempts to bridge these to provide 
a broad overview, which can be of help to researchers and developers in understanding 
how advanced sensing can play a role in smart cities.

1. Introduction 
A smart city is a city which functions in a sustainable and intelligent way, by integrating all its 
infrastructures and services into a cohesive whole and using intelligent devices for monitoring and 
control, to ensure sustainability and efficiency [1]. In a world where population numbers are constantly 
rising, significantly driving the consumption of resources causing resource shortages and climate 
change, the incentive for innovative solutions is evident. Urban areas, in particular, are responsible for 
the major part of resource consumption, instigating an increasing need to create smarter infrastructures, 
in search of greener and more energy efficient urban dynamics. Solutions to these issues comprise of 
improvements to a majority of components of urban dynamics, as illustrated in Figure 1.

It is predicted that the global economy will be significantly disproportionate due the growth of 
cities, with forecasts that by 2050 more than 6 billion people will live in urban areas [2]. This growth 
will aggravate further existing energy and climate related challenges. To solve these challenges, cities 
which are more resource efficient and technology driven, are necessary. 
Sensing is at the heart of smart infrastructures, which can monitor themselves and act on their own 
intelligently. Using sensors to monitor public infrastructures, such as bridges, roads and buildings, 
provides awareness that enables a more efficient use of resources, based on the data collected by these 
sensors. Real-time monitoring eliminates the need for regular scheduled inspections, therefore 
reducing costs; measuring energy consumption in households allows for accurate load forecasting; and 
sensors deployed in roads for traffic monitoring collect data which is necessary for the implementation 
of intelligent transportation systems (ITS). 
For these approaches to be effective, sensors have to be deployed in very large numbers and they 
have to be interconnected, so that the collected data can be sent to a central information system, where 
intelligent decisions based on this data can be made. This poses a number of challenges. Firstly, there 
needs to be a communication infrastructure in place for these sensors to communicate with each other. 
Secondly, what is the most efficient way to aggregate and process this data?

Aspects related to sensing in smart cities as well as efficient processing of data collected by these 
sensors is discussed in the remainder of this paper. It is organized as follows: Sections 2 and 3 review 
the current state of sensing and enabling technologies, respectively. In Section 4 existing sensing 
platforms for smart cities are discussed, and in Section 5 sensing applications in smart cities are 
discussed. Some ongoing and future pilot projects for smart cities are described in Section 6. 
Challenges and future directions are discussed in Section 7, and the paper is concluded in Section 8. 
2. The Sensing Evolution 
Sensors are a crucial component of any intelligent control system. A process is improved based on 
its environment and for a control system to be aware of its environment, it is typically fitted with an 
array of sensors, from which it collects the required data. It then uses the appropriate variables to 
characterize its environment and adjusts its operations accordingly.  
The availability of a multitude of different sensors and continuously evolving technology enable 
applications that were infeasible in the past due to high costs and limited availability. Technology 
advances not only drive the innovation behind sensors, they also enable sufficient processing power for 
small-scale devices to which these sensors can be interfaced to at a relatively low cost. From the 
perspective of the requirements for smart cities, wide availability of these technologies translates to a 
large number of opportunities in terms of sensing. 
As an example within the context of the smart city, meters to determine gas, electricity and water 
consumption have traditionally been mechanical. However, smart metering implies a new generation 
of technologies [3]. As with mechanical solutions, they must be robust, cheap, easy to maintain and 
reliable, as their readings will be used to determine billing. Electricity meter readings have evolved 
from the manual procedure of reading the mechanical meter, to automatic meter reading (AMR) which 
were deployed to reduce costs and improve the accuracy of meter readings, eventually to an advanced 
metering infrastructure (AMI) which differs from the AMR in that it enables two-way communications 
with the meter, driven by a growing understanding of the benefits of two-way interactions between 
system operators, consumers and their loads and resources. 
A sensor is a converter which converts parameters of a physical nature to an electronic signal, 
which can be interpreted by humans or can be fed into an autonomous system. These signals for 
conventional sensors, amongst others, include light, pressure, temperature, humidity, moisture and a 
variety of other parameters.  
More sophisticated sensors include accelerometers which can be used to measure acceleration and 
vibration. In the context of structural health monitoring (SHM), for instance, sensors like corrosion rate 
sensors (working on the principle of an increase in electrical resistivity due to corrosion); acoustic 
emission sensors (used to detect propagation of sound waves); and magneto-strictive sensors (detects 
the change in magnetic induction in the material caused by strain or stress). An even later generation of 
sensors is based on semiconductor physics and nano-technology, and intelligent sensing devices 
include, amongst others, smart phones. 
CMOS based sensing, due to the relative low cost, enables a range of smart sensors. In [4], a smart 
temperature sensor with a one-point calibration technique and MOSFET circuits is proposed. This 
sensor is primarily aimed at low-power devices. Other CMOS-based sensor applications include 
Sensors 2013, 13 
396 
 
 
monitoring the quality of food products, by observing the temperature and time of exposure, which are 
parameters related to the quality of food products [5]. Within the context of the smart city, these 
devices can also sense air and water quality, amongst others. 
In particular, stick-on or printed sensors can be attached to devices as labels to measure various 
physical parameters, such as humidity [6], temperature [7] and gas [8]. Also, sensors have been 
proposed in plastic foil, e.g., chemical gas sensors, implemented on a variety of substrates, coated with 
a sensing film. These enable sensing of multiple parameters from a single sensor. For instance, on a 
single flexible foil, a multi-parameter sensor for temperature, humidity and gas, using flexible 
polyimide foils, is proposed in [9], with the capability of sensing propane and similar gases. A possible 
application for these sensors, as indicated in [9], is humidity monitoring, by embedding these sensors 
into construction materials, or environmental monitoring [10], an important capability for smart cities. 
Nano-technology, although mostly applicable for bio-sensing applications, is a key enabling 
technology for sensor development, as advances in nano-technology will undoubtedly drive 
development in MEMS and photonics, inevitably leading to the development of highly sophisticated 
but low-cost sensors. This technology will enable applications where not only an individual’s 
surroundings can be sensed, but also the person’s health, at high granularity, for instance, and linked to 
social networks. 
The ever increasing number of smartphones opens up a totally new sensing scenario. Smartphones 
are fitted with a variety of sensors such as GPS, gyroscopes, accelerometers and compasses, enabling a 
variety of crowd sourcing applications, which will eventually be augmented by the Internet of Things. 
In particular, collaborative data collection is a popular crowd sourcing application. Crowd sourcing 
will be discussed in Section 5.10. 
3. Enabling Technologies 
Some technical issues regarding communication between sensor nodes still have to be resolved. In 
the context of the Internet of Things (IoT), the communication between sensors nodes has to be 
wireless, as cabling costs for millions of sensors is impractical and extremely expensive. Low power 
communication standards, suitable for an extremely large number of devices and their heterogeneity, 
are necessary. In particular, depending on location and necessary coverage, there are a number of 
different networks in smart cities. Depending on location and coverage, these can be classified as [11]: 
Home Area Networks: these typically use short range standards, with operating frequencies in 
the ISM bands. Standards include ZigBee, Dash7 and Wi-Fi (802.11 g/n), or wired standards 
such as Ethernet. All the monitoring and control system’s components in a home are connected 
by the HAN. 
Wide Area Networks: these provide for communication between utilities and customers’ 
premises, which requires a much broader coverage than HANs, with infrastructure such as 
leased lines based on optic fiber or broadband wireless, e.g., 3G and LTE, and managed by 
service providers. 
Field Area Networks: typically used in a smart grid to connect customers’ premises to substations.

3.1. ZigBee 
With the advent of ubiquitous computing, one of the concepts of smart cities is to have sensors 
deployed virtually everywhere, in the millions, such as in PlanIT Valley, where the aim is to have  
100 million sensors. As sensor nodes are typically designed to be low-power devices, the communication 
standard has to take that into account, as communication consumes the most energy. 
Low power standards like IEEE 802.15.4 have limited range and a significant number of repeaters 
would have to be deployed in a city for full coverage. Additionally, addressing schemes would have to 
support billions of devices. 6LoWPAN defines mechanisms which allow transmission of IPv6 packets 
over IEEE 802.15.4 based networks. Although this certainly presents itself as a solution to the 
addressing issue, the coverage issue is tightly coupled to the communication technology itself, which is 
inherently short range (in the order of hundred meters). 
3.2. Dash7 
Dash7 is a promising standard for WSNs and is aimed at long distance, low power sensing 
applications. Some of these applications include building automation and logistics, to name a few. This 
protocol stack has a very small footprint; its communication range is in the order of kilometers; and it 
operates at 433 MHz, a frequency which allows better penetration than 2.4 GHz [12]. For home area 
networks (HANs), for instance, this frequency is appealing, as it allows better penetration through 
walls than 2.4 GHz. For wide area networks (WANs), Dash7 is also appealing because of the long 
ranges. Dash7 has received considerable attention for military applications, including substantial 
investments. Nevertheless, to the best of our knowledge, there is no significant active academically 
driven research focused on Dash7. 
3.3. 3G and LTE 
In terms of existing wireless communication infrastructures, 3G and LTE, have available 
infrastructures worldwide, even in third world countries. These technologies are meant for broadband 
connectivity, and were not designed for short range, low power operation. Although they have been 
adopted by mobile devices such as smartphones, these devices operate on a rechargeable battery, in 
contrast to sensor nodes which are ideally deployed sparsely, with no intention of charging or 
replacing batteries. Furthermore, these services are provided by service providers and the data cost is 
still relatively expensive compared to their fixed line counterparts such as ADSL. With millions of 
sensors uploading gigabytes or even terabytes (in case of video) of data to the cloud, these 
technologies are rendered infeasible for IoT. Furthermore, these standards are not optimized for use in 
Sensors 2013, 13 
398 
 
 
sensor networks (i.e., low power). Hence, for these technologies to be adopted for sensor networks, 
power consumption has to be considered. In the absence of embedding these technologies into the 
sensor node (i.e., integrating LTE or 3G into the sensor platform), gateways can be used between the 
sensor devices and the web, as shown in [13]. LTE, in particular, has been a main enabler of high 
performance M2M applications, due to coverage, high throughput and low latency. 
3.4. RFID and NFC 
With regards to short range communication, there are two prominent technologies in the context of 
smart cities. Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) consists of an RFID tag (which can be either 
passive or active), where data is stored, and an RFID reader, which induces an electromagnetic field 
when in near proximity to passive tags and by this means provides power to the devices (longer ranges 
for active tags), enabling it to read data from the tag’s memory. RFID enables a range of applications 
for smart cities, such as localization and tracking of objects [14], healthcare applications [15], asset 
management [16] and smart parking [17], to name a few. As the circuitry in tags is printed, it is natural 
to integrate these tags with smart label sensors, therefore creating RFID tags which do not only 
contain data which has been manually written, but they also capture environmental data as described  
in [9]. Hence, each tag can also act as a sensor. Additionally, because passive tags are inexpensive, 
these can be deployed in very large numbers for pervasive sensing. Furthermore, the passive nature of 
these tags translates to low cost and low power consumption, as these tags only need to be powered 
when needed. 
Near Field Communication (NFC) is used in mobile and similar devices, for a very short  
bi-directional communication range (in contrast with RFID which is unidirectional). These ranges are 
usually in the centimeter range. The recent integration of NFC into smartphones has enabled a range of 
applications which facilitate day-to-day activities and enable smart living. A selection of general 
applications which have emerged with NFC is given: 
The most predominant application of NFC is the digital wallet. This allows customers to use their 
smartphones as a substitute for their cards, which can be for public transportation, bank, access control 
or identification [18]. 
Since NFC is bidirectional, it is possible to use it to share data between devices, multimedia as well 
as documents, such as business cards or similar contact information [19]. 
Occupancy and user context in smart homes are accomplished by placing NFC tags at strategic 
locations in a house and have these tags interface with the central information system It is possible to 
determine whether a user has entered a room and to change the settings according to the location  
(e.g., switch on Wi-Fi if the user enters the house) [17]. 
The following are real-world examples of NFC application within the context of the smart city: 
Smart energy metering: NFC-enabled post-pay electricity meters were deployed in the city of 
Chongqing, China, which enable consumers to read their smart meters with an NFC phone. 
Payment for the electricity is automatically done after the encrypted reading has been send 
over-the-air to the service’s banking back-end [20]. 
Sensors 2013, 13 
399 
 
 
Data acquisition and control: NFC enabled smartphones can be used to interface with control 
systems for remote control [21] and can be used as platforms for advanced measurement and 
processing [22]. 
City touristic surfing: with an NFC enabled smart phone and smart posters disseminated 
along the city, the user can navigate through points of interest within the city [23]. 
Smart car parks: motorists can use their NFC enabled smart phone as an electronic ticket to 
enter the parking lot and when leaving as an electronic wallet to affect payment [24]. 
With the addition of NFC to smartphones and the widespread of smartphones, NFC is envisaged as 
a key enabling technology in smart cities. 
4. Sensing Platforms 
With the advent of ubiquitous sensing, various devices and platforms are currently available  
for this purpose. Although ideas to implement these platforms have been around for decades, only 
recently have these systems been feasible from a cost perspective, driven by reduced manufacturing 
costs as well as low-cost electronic components such as radio transceivers, microcontrollers, 
microprocessors and sensors. Sourcing these components in bulk becomes increasingly less expensive 
as technology progresses. 
Sensor nodes can be interfaced to a number of sensors. The most common include humidity, light 
and temperatures sensors. These platforms are built in such a way that the sensed data is collected by 
the sensors, sometimes pre-processed, and then transmitted to a sink node via other sensor nodes; 
hence they are usually set up in a network, also known as a wireless sensor network (WSN). 
Additionally, these systems will be deployed outdoors and thus have to cope with the harsh 
environmental conditions. In this context, properties from industrial control networks can be applied in 
these sensor networks for added robustness and reliability [25]. 
4.1. Wireless Sensor Networks 
Wireless sensor networks consist of wireless sensor nodes, which are devices equipped with a 
processor, a radio interface, an analog-to-digital converter, multiple sensors, memory and a power 
supply. The general architecture of a wireless sensor node is illustrated in Figure 2. 
A range of open source sensor nodes are available to the research community. Some of the most 
widely used sensor nodes recently in research are Mica, Mica2, IMote, Telos, TelosB, Stargate and 
IMote 2. Table 2 contains details on available sensor motes used in research and commercial 
applications. The utopia of WSNs is an extremely tiny low-power, low-cost sensor node which can be 
deployed in any environment, with sufficient battery power to last for a few years, with the capability 
to continuously sense its surroundings. In reality, even with recent advances in microelectronics, these 
have still not been realized. The only project to come close to this idea was Smart Dust, which was 
active up to the early 2000s [26].

Energy Harvesting 
Wireless sensor networks are characterized by severe resource constraints, one of which is the 
reliance on battery life. With the deployment of sensor nodes in very large numbers in smart cities, it is 
infeasible to replace or recharge batteries in these devices. Creating energy efficient solutions from 
protocol design to sophisticated power management schemes are efficient and necessary methods, but 
not sufficient. A popular way of supplementing power includes solar panels, but sunlight is not always 
available and it is not the most cost effective solution. The harvesting of energy from alternative 
sources in the environment is actively being researched and developed. Examples of these energy 
sources include thermal, light (solar), wind, mechanical (vibration) and many others. However, 
efficient ways of capturing this energy are vital, as the energy from these sources is usually available 
in extremely small quantities. 
Hence, ways to scavenge energy from the environment to prolong the nodes’ lifetimes and improve 
market adoption are essential. Sources are typically from light, heat and sources of kinetic energy such 
as vibrations, etc. Of course, this technology can also be applied to drive any other low-energy device.  
Methods of energy harvesting, in the context of smart cities include: 
Wind energy: small scale turbine rotation is converted to electrical energy. Such turbines can 
be located in open places where wind is easily accessible. For instance, nodes used for 
structural health monitoring, deployed in bridges and similar structures, can readily use this 
Sensors 2013, 13 
401 
 
 
kind of harvesting. Other methods involve the use of piezo-electric materials [27] or vibrating 
membranes [28]. 
RF energy: an antenna receives RF signals and an RF-DC converter module converts the RF 
signals to DC voltages. With multiple antennae emitting signals, this type of harvesting is 
worth exploring [29]. 
Electric field: electric and magnetic fields around power lines, for instance, can be exploited 
for energy scavenging, as shown in [30,31]. Sensors deployed in the near proximity of these 
overhead lines can exploit these electric or magnetic fields. 
Vibrations and movement: kinetic energy, from vibrations for instance, can be harvested in 
many different locations. For instance, at utility’s facilities, nodes deployed for condition 
monitoring can exploit vibrations for energy scavenging, as shown in [32]. Vibration is probably 
the most efficient energy sources for scavenging, as well as HVAC ducts in office buildings. 
Light and Thermal Sources: these are common both indoors and outdoors. In houses for 
instance, these can be ambient artificial light or heat from appliances [33]. 
Piezo-electric harvesters in bridges and highways: to meet the demands in power requirements 
for sensor nodes for SHM, the structure’s vibration, in case of bridges or highways, is a good 
energy scavenging source [34]. 
Although there is a lot of research and development ongoing in this domain, these techniques are 
still not completely mature for powering of low-power devices, and even when they are used, it should 
be for ultra low duty cycles only, to preserve as much energy as possible. Amongst these scavenging 
techniques, harnessing energy from vibration is probably the most efficient approach. 
4.2. Internet of Things Systems 
Sensor nodes described in the previous section, typically send their data to a sink node, which in 
turn sends it to some sort of processing centre. These two components (sensing and processing) are not 
explicitly unified, from a WSN perspective. Some unified solutions include:  
Thingspeak [35]: Thingspeak is a platform which enables users to upload information from 
their sensor nodes to the Cloud. Users create an account on the platform, register their devices, 
and get access to their sensor data as desired. The system allows querying by location, allowing 
the user to have access to data from various locations in the world. 
iOBridge [36]: in contrast to Thingspeak and Cosm, where libraries for different sensing 
platforms are available, iOBridge develops its own hardware modules that are connected to the 
Cloud, which in turn can be accessed through web interfaces, for remote monitoring and API’s 
allow integration of the collected information into other web services or third-party 
applications, for example mobile applications for controlling these ioBridge devices remotely 
from smartphones such as Android and iPhone. 
In contrast to the systems described above, there are also proprietary solutions. These include 
HPCense [37] and Smarter Planet [38]. HPCense’s ultimate goal is to deploy more than a trillion 
sensors around the planet to collect a range of information such as seismic activity. Smarter Planet is 
an IBM initiative which encourages companies to adhere to their solutions to improve the efficiency of 
Sensors 2013, 13 
402 
 
 
their current systems. These include building management solutions and IT infrastructures for scalable 
data storage. 
4.3. Cloud of Things 
The Cloud is a vital component of smart cities. As sensors collect terabytes of information, this data 
needs to be aggregated and processed. With the recent technological advances in mobile computing, in 
the form of smartphones, the Cloud has become a critical element for data storage and processing. In 
simple terms, the Cloud is a collection of platforms and infrastructures on which data is stored and 
processed, allowing users to retrieve and upload their data for a specific mobile application or 
computer program, at any location with available Internet access. Hence, the Cloud is a pool of 
resources accessible via the Internet. 
The ability of outsourcing processing power is particularly appealing, because resource intensive 
applications can be dispatched to the Cloud instead. From the perspective of ubiquitous computing and 
sensing, the Cloud is essential. 
For smart cities, combining the Cloud and sensors is crucial, so that the sensing data can be stored 
or processed. In [39], a high-level architecture to interface sensors and the Cloud is described. The 
exchange of data follows the Sensor Web Enablement (SWE) standard. 
In the context of Cloud computing, all these platforms can be classified as either infrastructure as a 
service (IaaS), platform as a service (PaaS) or software as a service (SaaS). Infrastructure as a service 
(IaaS) consists of providing storage or processing capabilities through the use of virtual machines; 
platform as a service (PaaS) comprises a platform with execution environment and databases; and 
software as a service (SaaS) provides facilities for users to access their applications or personal files on 
the cloud. The integration of sensor devices into the Internet requires IP compatible protocol stacks. 
The Constrained Application Protocol (CoAP) is an application layer protocol, specifically for 
energy constrained devices, described in [40]. The device in question (in this context, a sensor node) 
communicates with a CoAP client, which in turn communicates with a web server. CoAP and 
6LoWPAN allow sensor nodes to be integrated into the web, through the use of proxies for HTTP to 
CoAP conversion. In this context, if sensor nodes running CoAP are connected to the network, sensing 
data could be retrieved by a web browser through GET requests, in the same way a HTTP agent is 
queried. Figure 3 illustrates how CoAP and HTTP co-exist. 
Figure 3. CoAP to HTTP conversion through a proxy in the Cloud. 
 
Sensors 2013, 13 
403 
 
 
Efforts are made to integrate these services into each layer of the protocol stack, such as in 
Sensinode [13], where these are combined in the protocol stack. IoT standardizing efforts are also a 
challenge as a large number of companies are involved with IoT development. 
Other standardizing efforts include the Sensor Web Enablement (SWE) framework [41], by the 
Open Geospatial Consortium (OGC), with the goal of seamlessly integrating sensor nodes independent 
of hardware platform, and defining structures for describing measured data from sensors to a suite of 
web services available to the platform.  
When using smartphones as ubiquitous sensing tools, standards have to put in place for efficient 
data exchange between devices. In [42] a performance analysis on Sensor Web Enablement (SWE) 
protocols for data exchange between mobile devices for environmental monitoring applications is 
presented. SWE protocols are based on XML, which introduce a considerable amount of overhead. By 
analyzing the execution speed of the XML parsing process, and comparing to alternative formats, such 
as JSON, or EXI, with reductions in the file size in the order of 40% to 90%, as well as faster parsing 
times, it was concluded that EXI-C, even though it adds considerable overhead in processing times, 
results in greatly reduced message lengths. Apart from the integration of sensor devices onto the Web, 
another issue is the large volume of data due the large number of sensors. 
An example of Cloud architecture to solve the high volume data issue, named CLEVER, is 
presented in [43]. This architecture allows the virtualization of different types of sensing structures so 
that a common interface can be used for multiple sensor networks. It provides services for sensing, 
storage and computation. From a cloud perspective, CLEVER is mainly an IaaS solution. A module 
named C-SENSOR is responsible for managing the sensors’ physical resources and abstraction/ 
virtualization. C-SENSOR is compliant with SWE and it interacts with sensor data in an event-based 
or on-demand fashion. A Host Manager directly interfaces with the sensor network and a Cluster 
Manager, which interacts with the system’s front-end and database. Each sensor network is virtualized 
as a virtual pervasive element (VPE), which is an integral part of the Host manager. 
5. Applications 
5.1. Water Distribution Systems 
Water (along with electricity) is one of the most important resources in urban areas. From supplying 
residential customers to public infrastructures, such as public parks, the distribution of water has to be 
done efficiently and has to be regulated. Furthermore, efficient quality control has to be performed to 
ensure that water is safe for human consumption. A typical water distribution system consists of a 
water collecting point (such as a river or lake), storage facilities (such as reservoirs) and a distribution 
network, which typically consists of pipes (placed either above or underground and underwater) 
connecting water collecting points, storage facilities, to the customers’ premises. 
These distribution systems are in essence non-intelligent. For instance, if there is a leak in one of 
the distribution pipes, it can be tricky to diagnose the system early enough to detect the fault, 
especially if it is not readily visible (in case of underground pipes for instance). Advanced sensing 
enables a more reliable fault detection system. Possible locations to deploy sensors and parameters of 
interest, from a monitoring perspective, in water distribution systems, are shown in Figure 4. Examples 
Sensors 2013, 13 
404 
 
 
of such applications include monitoring the content level in reservoir tanks, leak detection and 
monitoring the water quality at specific points along the distribution system. 
Figure 4. Applications of sensing in water distribution systems. 
 
For pipeline monitoring, the method shown in [44] consists of sensors deployed around the pipeline 
for continuous monitoring. Typically, three parameters used to indicate faults in pipelines are 
vibration, pressure, sound (made by the liquid as it leaks) and water flow [45]. By monitoring these 
parameters, a leakage can be successfully detected. In [46], a WSN monitors hydraulic, flow and 
acoustic data, as well as water quality, with nodes deployed at strategic locations along the pipeline 
and also in sewers to determine content levels. 
For pressure sensing, this system uses a piezo-resistive sensor and for measuring water pH  
(for quality monitoring purposes), a glass electrode is used. For water level monitoring, an ultrasonic 
sensor was placed on top of the collector, and two pressure transducers were placed at the bottom [45]. 
Additionally, using dual-axis accelerometers, vibration data is collected. These sensors are deployed 
along the pipes as shown in Figure 5. 
Figure 5. Vibration, pressure, and flow sensors in a pipeline. These are used to monitor the 
integrity of the pipeline, as described above. 
 
Sensors 2013, 13 
405 
 
 
The collected data is then analyzed to search for leaks. By analyzing the pressure data using Haar 
Wavelet transforms, pressure pulses along the pipe can be detected to determine whether bursts 
occurred and their approximate location. High magnitude noise in the acoustic signal is also an 
indication of a leak. Since sensors are typically placed apart and by cross-correlating the data collected 
by neighbor nodes, and considering time differences due to the sensors’ spatial positioning, the 
location of a leak can be determined. As these analysis methods require considerable processing 
resources, the data collected is analyzed remotely and not locally on the sensor nodes. A device to 
mitigate effects from the leak can be activated when an anomaly is detected. In the context of pipeline 
monitoring, this could consist of a device that would instruct an electro-mechanical device (i.e., 
actuator) to act in order to restrict the flow of water to sections of the pipe which could have been 
compromised by the leak. Other methods consist of placing meters inside the pipe to determine liquid 
flow [47]. 
Hence, integrated sensing, processing and actuators results in an intelligent structure, where the 
actuator’s decisions do not require human intervention. The data is collected by the sensing agent, 
analyzed, classified and an intelligent decision is carried out by the actuator. 
5.2. Electricity Distribution Systems 
Conventional electricity distribution systems are in essence non-intelligent. Typically, these energy 
distribution infrastructures provide unidirectional flows, from the generating station to the customers. 
The amount of supplied electricity is estimated or predicted, through previous available data, in order 
to perform load shedding for instances where the demand exceeds the supply. 
An improvement to the conventional distribution scheme is a bi-directional system, in the sense that 
electricity flows from the utility to the client’s premises and vice versa. A more efficient use of energy 
is then possible, whereby electricity can flow back to the utility (to be stored for later use) in cases of 
low demand. These systems are collectively known as smart grids. The concept of distributed 
generation enables a scenario where, instead of having a centralized generation scheme, additional 
electricity generation points can be located closer to customers, therefore reducing the impact of losses 
on electricity transportation over long distances. Additionally, this enables more innovative demand 
response programs to be put into action. 
In contrast to conventional power grids, smart grids introduce many improvements. Firstly, smart 
grids have self-monitoring capabilities [48], where sensors can be deployed anywhere along the 
distribution network, in locations such as substations or overhead transmission lines, for instance. 
Sensor data can then be used to report relevant events (in terms of performance and reliability) back to 
appropriate entities. An important sensing application in smart grid, amongst others, is the monitoring 
of overhead transmission lines. By monitoring the lines, utilities ensure that power delivery occurs 
within safe limits. For instance, systems like STAMP [49] sense the temperature, sag and tension 
values of an overhead line in real time and determine the state, or health, of the line from these 
measurements (illustrated in Figure 6). STAMP achieves this using a distributed temperature system 
(DTS) and thermocouples for temperature measurements, a laser range finder to detect sag and ground 
clearance, and two load cells to monitor tension. These parameters have to be carefully monitored to 
ensure that the conductor is operating at its ampacity rating, which is dependent on temperature.

Figure 6. Location of current sensors in a transmission line to monitor the line’s state. 
 
Furthermore, parameters such as voltage, current and phase can be determined through voltage and 
current sensors, such as medium voltage (MV) sensors [50], placed directly on the transmission lines, 
or non-intrusive sensors, which measure magnetic field variations. An example of a stick-on, low-cost 
sensor for such purposes is proposed in [51], which can be readily deployed in transformers and 
overhead conductors. 
5.3. Smart Buildings and Homes 
In an effort to promote green living and sustainability, there are various initiatives to decrease 
energy consumption in buildings. In this context, methods to significantly reduce energy consumption 
in buildings are various, from intelligent systems to smart design. These are necessary because 
buildings (especially with the easy accessibility to inexpensive electrical appliances or other electronic 
devices such as computers, etc.) consume a very large portion of generated electricity. In particular, 
heat, ventilation and air conditioning (HVAC) constitutes the largest contributors to increased 
consumption. Hence, sensing is crucial in buildings for appropriate actions to reduce consumption can 
take place. For building automation systems, for instance, before an appropriate action can take place 
(which could be dimming lights or switching of air conditioning) the state of the environment has to be 
properly assessed. At the heart of household energy sensing are smart meters. Energy sensing 
measurements are interfaced with a smart meter for accurate consumption reports. Sensing can also aid 
in demand prediction. 
5.3.1. Approach to Energy Sensing 
Accurate power usage measurement at the load side requires appropriate sensing. Additionally, the 
existence of a bi-directional grid enables the use of smart meters at customer premises. Determining 
how much power electrical appliances and electronic devices are utilizing is crucial. To this end, 
sensors can be placed on these electrical appliances for accurate measurements. 
Three different approaches for energy sensing at the customer’s premises are: distributed direct 
sensing, single point sensing and intermediate sensing [52]. With distributed sensing, a sensor is placed 
on each appliance, which means that although measurements will be more accurate, it is an expensive 
approach due to installation and maintenance costs. Single-point sensing, in contrast to distributed 
Sensors 2013, 13 
407 
 
 
sensing, measures voltage and current entering a household. Although not as accurate as distributed 
sensing, it lowers costs significantly. By monitoring raw current and voltage waveforms, and 
subsequently performing feature extraction on these measurements, a classification algorithm can be 
used to determine which appliances are on or off, by comparing the measurements to existing device 
signatures. Intermediate sensing falls between direct and single-point sensing. For intermediate 
sensing, smart breaker devices are installed in a household’s circuit panel to provide a more detailed 
analysis of consumption. Other sensing approaches described in [52] are based on voltage signatures, 
where voltage noise signatures or current signatures are used to classify operation of electrical 
appliances, by observing the spectral envelope of the harmonics and comparing these observations to 
existing templates.  
5.3.2. Correlation between Demand Prediction and Weather Conditions  
The concept of Smart World as an interconnection of smart infrastructures is introduced in [53]. 
This concept includes sensing a range of parameters describing the earth’s state, such as environmental 
pressure, temperature, radiation and similar parameters which can be exploited by the global 
community to improve the efficiency of services provided to the community. 
For instance, accurate demand prediction is necessary to avoid rolling blackouts or similar measures 
when demand exceeds supply. With regard to demand prediction, the correlation between weather 
(which is typically characterized by temperature, pressure, humidity and wind speed and direction) and 
demand, or human behavior, is of particular interest. In [53], the effect of weather on electricity 
consumption is investigated. It is found that the highest correlation weather variables with power 
consumption are temperature, global solar radiation and humidity [53], for different times of the day 
and seasons. The work in [53] specifically focuses on smaller areas, such as micro-grids. This is 
correlated with the usage of appliances, as heaters, geysers and air conditioners tend to comprise a 
large percentage of a house’s electricity consumption, and the use of these appliances is correlated 
with seasons. By using environmental data and intelligent agents to help predict load, it is possible to 
achieve greatly improved demand prediction. 
5.3.3. Occupancy and User Context 
The most basic action when it comes to occupancy is to determine whether there are people in a 
room or not. Typically, this can be achieved through a combination of sensors, as shown in [54]. These 
sensors include passive-infrared (PIR) sensors [54] or more sophisticated camera based methods such 
as the methods shown on [55], where people can be actively counted to determine occupancy numbers 
and locations. PIR detectors are used in home alarm systems for motion detection (i.e., to detect 
whether there is a person in a room). Apart from occupancy, another important feature is the user 
context, as highlighted in [56]. This can be achieved by behavior activity classification using video 
cameras for instance, as shown in [57]. The data from these sources enables an appropriate plan of 
action with regards to the people in the room. For instance, lights in corridors, elevators, and or other 
facilities can be dimmed if there is no human activity, hence reducing the overall energy consumption. 
Sensors 2013, 13 
408 
 
 
5.3.4. Indoor Monitoring 
Of interest are also the buildings’ ambient temperature and ambient lighting. For instance, with 
light emitting diodes (LEDs) lamps, the intensity can be reduced in cases where ambient light, from 
open windows for instance, is sufficient. These windows are made of tintable material which reacts to 
changes in the environment [58], and can reflect or absorb light, depending on an external electrical 
stimulus. This is a simple example of how energy consumption can be reduced by smart design. 
Indoor temperature can also be monitored so that parameters in the HVAC system can be adjusted 
to meet specified temperatures, described by predefined set-points. For these purposes, humidity and 
temperature are deployed in strategic positions to collect the required data for actuation. 
The smart thermostat proposed in [59] is an example of a combination of sensors and actuators in 
the smart building context. The thermostat is coupled with motion sensors to detect occupancy and 
then creates an optimal setback schedule based on this collected data for autonomous operation. 
In [60] a ZigBee based HVAC control system is described for ensuring an adequate comfort level in 
buildings, using machine learning techniques. Sensor nodes are equipped with temperature and 
humidity sensors, from which data is collected at one-minute intervals and sent to a logging system. 
This data is clustered and matched to user feedback, where users can indicate their current comfort 
level. In the control phase, the control system and clusters classified as uncomfortable can be moved to 
the closest comfortable cluster. 
Apart from monitoring and controlling HVAC systems, it is also necessary to monitor electrical 
appliances, to detect any faults and to be able to assess current operating status remotely, and having 
the appliances wirelessly connected to each other in a home area network (HAN). Furthermore, these 
systems can be connected to social networks to share notifications, enabling remote monitoring. An 
example of such a system is described in [61]. All appliances have a set of sensors (to measure 
humidity, temperature or pressure) mounted on them, which are connected to a local sensor host 
(LSH), and are equipped with 802.3 u and 802.11 g interfaces, so that these nodes can be connected to 
an available wired or wireless network, which is connected to the Internet. Each appliance is fitted 
with a specific set of sensor types. For instance, a refrigerator can be fitted with pressure and acoustic 
sensors on each tray to determine the quantity of food. Examples of notifications from appliances 
include warnings from washing machines upon completion of a washing cycle. 
5.3.5. Smart Building Evacuation 
Another aspect of smart buildings is smart evacuation systems. Conventional evacuation systems 
activate an alarm when an alert for an emergency situation is triggered. This model assumes that 
people within the building are aware of the routes to exit the building. A more efficient way to perform 
building evacuation is to count the number of people and direct them through the quickest routes by 
considering congestion information, obtainable from a variety of sensors, such as beam sensors or 
video cameras. Examples of such WSNs are described in [62] and [63], using beam sensors and 
detection of tags worn by the people in the building, respectively. Although not as accurate, these 
methods are preferable to video camera based methods, from a processing cost perspective. Instead of 
using these systems stand-alone, they can be interfaced to the building’s infrastructure, to obtain an 
Sensors 2013, 13 
409 
 
 
estimate of the number of people through existing occupancy and user context functionality, typically 
based on motion sensors or video cameras, if available. 
5.4. Monitoring Bridges and Seismic Activity 
All public infrastructures have to be monitored to assess their condition. Even if these 
infrastructures are monitored by personnel through scheduled visits, a visual inspection is often not 
sufficient, as anomalies may still go undetected. A more efficient approach to monitoring is to install a 
variety of sensors across the structure to continuously monitor its state and determine its health. 
There are a variety of parameters which characterize a structure’s state. In [64], the most common 
parameters for monitoring of structures are listed as chemical (pH, oxidation, and corrosion), 
mechanical (strain, stress and deformation) and physical (temperature and humidity). A variety of 
sensors capable of measuring these parameters can be deployed in large numbers across a structure for 
accurate monitoring, but these can incur a significantly high cost. Recently, fiber optic sensing (FOS) 
has received substantial attention from the research community. 
Recent approaches for SHM include using sophisticated fiber optic sensors [65]. In bridges, for 
damage detection, optic fiber sensors can be used for structure monitoring. An optic fiber sensor works 
by detecting the change in the detected signal from a transmitted signal, after it has passed through the 
structure of interest, and is able to measure strain, pressure and temperature, by interpreting changes in 
wavelength. This typically requires the installation of fiber into the structure to be monitored. These 
distributed sensors work on the basis of back-scattering. As light propagates through the fiber, some of 
it is scattered back along the length of the fiber. Since the properties of the back-scattered light depend 
on the strain, deformation or temperature of the fiber, by using this information one can determine the 
state of the structure where the fiber is installed. A fiber distributed sensor is equivalent to having a 
large number of sensors deployed along a line with high resolution, since all points along the fiber can 
be considered sensing points, as described in [66]. Other approaches to sensing for SHM use WSNs 
with sensor nodes equipped with multiple accelerometers to sense vibration along a 1,300 m long 
bridge [67]. The appeal of these systems is the relatively low cost and ease of installation in 
comparison to more sophisticated sensing solutions. These sensors were deployed over the main span 
and tower, and collected information of structural accelerations from wind load. Additional approaches 
include the use of thermal responses and combination of multiple sensors such as strain gauges,  
strain-gage displacement and force sensors, as well as non-intrusive sensing methods using video 
cameras [68]. These computer vision based systems can be used for instance for structural crack 
detection [69]. 
Another important application of sensor networks in smart cities is monitoring the ground to detect 
any anomalies. These allow early detection of earthquakes or landslides, which can be used for early 
warnings in emergency situations. In [70] a wireless sensor network is suggested to monitor sub-soil 
activity. Sensor nodes are buried underground. In contrast to other monitoring techniques, which rely 
on sensors attached to the sensor node, the technique proposed in [70] relies on how the propagation 
signal is affected by soil conditions. By considering changes in the received signal strength (RSS), it is 
possible to infer events based on how each soil parameter affects the signal. In particular, water 
intrusion, detection of relative motion and relative density change can be detected using this technique. 
Sensors 2013, 13

5.5. Environmental Monitoring 
To ensure quality of life, as well as safety, environmental monitoring is of utmost importance. By 
monitoring the quality of air, quality of water, and other parameters such as humidity, temperature and 
ambient carbon dioxide level, as well as other harmful gases, it is possible to assess anomalies in the 
environment; therefore ensuring pollution is kept to an acceptable level. In particular, reducing the 
level of carbon emissions, which is a serious threat to our planet is one of the main goals of smart 
cities. Environmental monitoring requires deploying a variety of sensors outdoors, in locations such as 
parks and rivers, etc. With the proliferation of smartphones, it is possible to use them for collaborative 
environment monitoring. Furthermore, it is necessary to better understand how human behavior is 
influenced by weather conditions, with regards to mobility and other aspects. 
In [71], the relationship between human behavior and weather is studied, in an attempt to gain a 
better understanding of the dynamics of an urban system. Data characterizing air quality and weather 
was collected from environmental monitoring stations and analyzed in conjunction with network 
mobile traffic data generated during a period of 20 days. It was demonstrated that by combining data 
from different ubiquitous sensing sources (environmental data and mobile traffic data), it is possible to 
analyze environmental and social dynamics, which can be used to improve on a lot of aspects in the 
context of smart cities, such as public transportation and other services. 
5.6. Intelligent Transportation Systems 
With the steep increase in car numbers over recent years, there is an increasing need for efficient 
traffic management, to avoid traffic jams and optimize traffic flow, especially at intersections. A 
conventional way to regulate traffic flow is through the use of traffic lights. These typically have fixed 
switch interval times (i.e., from red to green and to yellow), which are not adjustable to traffic 
conditions. Traffic jams have significant impacts on fuel consumption due to the frequent starts and 
stops, as well as increased carbon emissions. An adaptive scheme, dependent on traffic conditions, is 
more attractive. In this context, a method to estimate the number of cars approaching an intersection 
could generate information for switch interval times to be dynamically adjusted based on traffic 
conditions. For such an intelligent system to be realized, efficient methods to detect traffic (i.e., count 
the number of cars) are required. Approaches where traffic lights and stop signs are completely 
removed have also been proposed, as described in [72]. Such an approach is based on an intelligent 
intersection where vehicles, which are wirelessly connected to each other, can communicate with each 
other and use decision-making for collision avoidance. Using a time-slot for each vehicle, crossing of 
intersections is coordinated amongst vehicles [73]. A vehicle which misses its time-slot has to stop 
when it reaches the intersection and wait for a new time-slot. The wireless communication can be 
performed through RFID, as proposed in [74]. In [74] a system to control a vehicle’s speed 
autonomously based on the traffic signs is described. RFID was used for communication between the 
vehicle and traffic signs, with RFID tags placed on traffic signs and RFID readers placed on the side of 
the doors of the car, and a Hall Effect sensor placed on the vehicle’s wheels for speed control. 
Inexpensive methods of sensing cars involve induction loop detectors which are buried in roads. 
Loops detectors can be used to detect the presence of metals. When a vehicle approaches the loop, the 
Sensors 2013, 13 
411 
 
 
loop’s resonant frequency increases, and this change in frequency is interpreted as a vehicle. The 
increase in frequency differs according to car size (or height), enabling an estimate of the kind of car 
which has been sensed. This information can then be used to estimate vehicle speed or other 
parameters, which can be useful for traffic flow management. To estimate a vehicle’s weight, other 
methods such as weight in motion (WIM) can be used. A WIM system captures vehicle gross and axle 
weights using sensor mats on road surfaces. Various types of WIM systems are discussed in [75]: 
piezoelectric systems (which detect changes in voltage due to pressure); capacitive mats (two inductive 
loops and one capacitive weight sensor); bending plates (which record the strain on the plate due to the 
dynamic load of the vehicle); load cells (which use a single load cell with two scales for each side of 
the vehicle’s axle); and optical WIM (where pressure on the optical fiber creates a phase shift in 
polarization modes which is directly related to the load on the fiber). All methods highlighted above 
usually carry significant installation and maintenance costs. A WIM system is illustrated in Figure 7. 
Less intrusive (but not as accurate) and more sophisticated methods involve video cameras. These 
approaches are more attractive mainly because cameras can be easily installed and the level of required 
maintenance is low, compared to previously described approaches. Furthermore, in instances where 
there are surveillance cameras installed, these can be used for intelligent transportation applications. A 
wireless real-time traffic monitoring system is proposed in [76]. The system consists of multiple 
standard CCTV cameras and personal computers (PCs), which process the captured data from the 
cameras. Each camera is controlled by the PCs, and each PC implements all the necessary algorithms 
for recognition and tracking. 
The system was tested in different environments, such as airports and tunnels. One of the 
drawbacks of computer vision-based methods is their performance dependency on environment 
conditions, such as lighting and occlusions. Dealing with occlusions or weather conditions is 
challenging in computer vision, so such scenarios have to be handled with care. For instance, in the 
presence of fog or rain, vehicle detection or counting is more challenging. For night-time scenarios, 
street lamps and vehicle lights also have to be considered [77]. In particular, street lamps, traffic lights 
can be used for vehicle sensing, as vehicles can be detected by considering the distance between 
vehicle’s headlights. 
Figure 7. Weight in motion system. Weight information recorded by the weight detectors 
is sent to the controller via wired connectors, such as a fiber optic cable, for storage  
and processing. 
 
Sensors 2013, 13

5.7. Surveillance 
With the availably of conventional CCTV systems for surveillance purposes, an infrastructure for 
smart surveillance systems already exists. Security, especially in urban areas, is of paramount 
importance. Although these cameras are typically connected to a digital video recorder (DVR), most 
only record and do not have any built-in intelligent processing capabilities. Furthermore, these systems 
are run by human operators who are prone to loss of concentration. The benefits of using smart 
surveillance are obvious. For instance, by monitoring peoples’ actions, it is possible to determine 
whether violent actions are taking place, and even trying to identify and recognize the people involved. 
In this context, smart surveillance systems could alert users by triggering alerts when events of 
interest take place. Additionally, monitoring people’s behavior can help in determining pedestrian 
traffic patterns which can be of help in the design of future pedestrian facilities or modification of 
current facilities. 
In the instance of gatherings, it is important to have crowd control schemes in place, especially in 
cases where there are large numbers of people, such as in concerts, or other public areas such as 
airports. This is especially relevant in emergency management systems or pedestrian crowd 
monitoring, especially at night-time. To track and detect pedestrians at night, an infrared video can be 
used [78], as infrared cameras work on the basis of temperature and not on reflected light, hence 
infrared based computer vision techniques are less susceptible to lighting. 
Another important aspect of crowd surveillance, especially in security applications, is to determine 
whether people are carrying any objects, such as suitcases, etc. This allows determining whether a 
person, for instance, is entering a restricted area while carrying an object which they are not allowed 
carrying in specific facilities. A framework to detect objects carried by people from video sequences is 
presented in [79]. This method works by considering irregularities in a person’s silhouette. This is 
performed by comparing a template of an individual walking in the same direction as the individual 
being observed, with any protrusions noticed considered as possible pixels for carrying objects. 
Another important aspect of crowd control is determining violent behavior. Monitoring of fights, 
riots and similar events is important for safety reasons. A crowd behavior classification algorithm is 
proposed in [80]. 
A semantic video surveillance system able to autonomously detect abnormal situations, able to run 
on low resolution (320 × 240) cameras is described in [81]. The system’s cameras run motion 
detection algorithms with are used to extract information from the video and format it in XML, 
aggregating several frames, which are then used to perform route detection, which consists of 
extracting information of objects which enter or exit the scene. Finally, a semantic reasoning module is 
used to classify the semantic data obtained from semantic translation to determine whether there are 
anomalies such as cars driving on the sidewalks or similar situations which could indicate abnormal 
situations. This system can be used to detect pedestrians crossing streets without using crosswalks or 
walking on railways and vehicles going in the wrong direction. Hence, this system can be deployed in 
different scenarios only changing its rules’ set to fit that specific environment.

5.8. Public Services—Law Enforcement and Fire Fighting 
The conventional law enforcement model is impractical and inefficient. Investigations and other 
processes within law enforcement are aggravated by human incompetency and lack of automation in 
processes. For law enforcement, IBM has solutions within the Smarter Planet initiative, integrating 
investigations, geographic information systems (GIS) and intelligence analysis [82], enabling 
information sharing across agencies, resulting in a more efficient and more coordinated law 
enforcement scheme. Another public service that can be improved by use of technology is  
fire-fighting. Fire fighters risk their lives in the line of duty, due to the harsh conditions in which they 
have to carry out their work. 
Conventional fire-fighting can also be improved, as shown in [83]. This system consists of a TelosB 
based wireless sensor network, where the nodes are placed on firefighters’ bodies. Each TelosB mote 
is equipped with sensors to measure temperature, carbon dioxide, and hydrogen and hydrocarbon 
concentration. Using RSSI based localization, firefighters are aware of their position relative to other 
fighters within the network. This also enables computation of escape paths, so that firefighters can exit 
the work location safely. 
5.9. Health Care 
One of the most important applications of sensor networks is in healthcare. To facilitate 
management in hospitals or clinics, sensors can be used in these environments for various applications. 
In particular, wireless body area networks (WBANs), is a very active research field. Body area 
networks consist of inter-connected sensors placed in different parts of the human body. Hence, with 
sensors attached to one’s body, either internally or externally, it is possible to monitor an individual’s 
vital signs remotely. Examples of parameters which can be monitored include electrocardiography 
(ECG), respiration, skin conductance and skin temperature [84]. The advantage of WBANs is their 
capability to upload this data to remote logging systems so that the collected data can be viewed by a 
medical practitioner in real-time. Individuals with heart problems, for instance, can be constantly 
monitored and alerted if there are signs of an anomaly. Activity monitoring and classification, which is 
useful in health monitoring, can also be performed by WBANs. But healthcare applications using 
sensing technology are not limited to WBANs. 
Other examples of sensing applications in healthcare involve emergency response [85]. In [85], a 
protocol for emergency reporting using cognitive wireless sensor networks is proposed. This protocol 
is modeled after ants’ behavior and is used to coordinate cluster-heads actions more efficiently, which 
results in a decrease in reporting time delays. 
A framework for long-term activity monitoring is proposed in [86]. The system is able to recognize 
user activity in real time and classifying activities, using an array of sensors deployed in the home 
environment and attached to doors, refrigerators and cupboards, as well as light sensors. From activity 
classification, it is possible to infer whether the person has a certain disease or not. For instance, if 
frequent sleep is detected, it is possibly due to fatigue, which could indicate that an individual has 
diabetes, for instance. This framework can be used for disease prediction based on day-to-day activities. 
Sensors 2013, 13 
414 
 
 
A user-context recognition system is presented in [87]. It uses Hidden Markov Models (HMM) to 
assess users’ stress levels. Users insert their stress levels into a questionnaire through a smartphone 
application. The entered data is matched to smartphone’s context data, such as location and activity 
information, which is then used for HMM training. Stress levels can then be classified after the 
training phase. 
5.10. Crowd Sourcing 
Crowd sourcing consists of outsourcing tasks to a group of people, or crowd, in an attempt to 
collaboratively completing tasks quickly. The smart city not only consists of smart infrastructure and 
sustainability: smart people are also an integral part of the smart city. With the recent proliferation of 
social platforms and mobile computing, crowd sourcing becomes a viable medium for exchange of 
skills and services. Workflows, in crowd sourcing, consist of tasks which have been unified. For crowd 
sourcing to be effectively carried out, workflow processes have to be designed so that jobs can be 
broken into tasks and efficiently dispatched to human actors, and these workflow processes have to be 
ideally integrated into social platforms. To this end, various tools have been developed. In [88], a 
collaborative workflow tool for Amazon Mechanical Turk is described. It allows requesters to view 
tasks’ current status and reduces required planning by requesters. CrowdScape [89] attempts to include 
user behavior into the crowd sourcing process, in an attempt to improve work efficiency. User 
behavior whilst completing a task is considered in conjunction with worker outputs, using machine 
learning. Actions considered to characterize user’s behavior include frequency of mouse click events, 
key presses and scrolls. By correlating the user behavior with good work outputs, it is possible to 
identify traits of good workers, helping make crowd sourcing task assignments more efficient. 
With smartphones becoming increasingly more powerful in terms of resources, crowd sourcing 
using smartphones phones has been thoroughly investigated. For instance, as users regularly update 
their location status on social networks like Twitter and Facebook, based on this location information, 
it is possible to aggregate this data, enabling tasks to be dispatched to people in specific locations. 
Furthermore, by using sensor data on a smartphone, it is possible to determine a person’s state (i.e., 
whether the user is stationary or not), as well as environment. This data can be collaboratively used to 
obtain information regarding the weather with location information [90]. 
Given the number of smartphones users in the world, this enables pervasive sensing. With 
smartphones fitted with a variety of sensors such as GPS, gyroscopes, accelerometers and compasses, 
smartphones enable a variety of crowd sourcing applications, which will be eventually augmented by 
the Internet of Things. In particular, collaborative data collection is a popular crowd sourcing application.  
Examples include MobSens [91], which combines four applications: PollutionSpy to monitor air 
pollution; NoiseSpy which captures noise levels; MobAsthma, a personalized asthma monitoring 
application; and Fresh, an application which provides a platform to let users discuss issues regarding 
their environment. 
Although crowd sourcing is typically outsourcing work tasks to people, crowd sourcing can also be 
used for sensing, as described in [92]. Crowd reporting, as described in [92], consists of collecting 
information from sources such as mobile devices and social networks. The data reported can be in the 
form of messages which are aggregated and converted into a uniform format, for processing. The data 
Sensors 2013, 13 
415 
 
 
is collected from Twitter as using a set of keywords to select relevant information. This data is then 
pre-processed, filtered and clustered so that event correlation can be determined. 
Although sensing through crowd sourcing (i.e., pervasive sensing) is appealing to a number of 
promising applications, there are still a number of challenges, which are not necessarily of a  
technical nature. Privacy, in particular, is possibly the biggest challenge. Additionally, involving the 
not-so-evident risks related to large-scale data collection as well as legal issues such as data ownership, 
user protection [93] and trust needs to be insured as entities responsible for analyzing the collected 
data, can abuse the collected information or use it to harm the user. 
5.11. Summary of Benefits of Smart Sensing 
From the content presented in this section, it is evident that advanced sensing applications in cities 
enable improvement in process efficiency. Based on this information, Table 3 summarizes some of the

The concept of a smart city as a system that is highly intelligent and autonomous is far from being 
realized. Even with recent breakthroughs in technology, available technology is still not sufficiently 
mature for smart cities to be truly autonomous. Nevertheless, there are currently pilot projects of smart 
cities in development worth mentioning. 
Sensors 2013, 13

Development for Songdo [94], a fully ubiquitous 1,500 acre city in South Korea, started in 2001 
and is predicted to be complete by 2015. Smart systems in every building are used to monitor the water 
and electricity, which also allow residents to connect remotely using their smartphones. Sensing 
technologies include RFID tags on vehicles, which send signals to sensors on the road to monitor 
traffic flow, surveillance systems as well as smart street lights, which can be adjusted to pedestrian 
traffic. Some of the innovative technologies in Songdo [95] include home and building automation 
where users will be able to control the systems in their houses remotely. Ubiquitous sensors are 
deployed virtually everywhere, from buildings, (for safety purposes, for fire, etc.) to flow sensors, 
which control the canal in Songdo’s Central Park, and on street lights to adjust the level of  
lighting according to the pedestrians’ flow. Smart power in Songdo is generated by natural gas and 
distributed through a smart grid. Tele-presence facilities are being installed in homes, hospitals and 
shopping centers. 
PlanIT Valley [96] in Northern Portugal is another pilot project for a fully ubiquitous city built from 
the ground up, which will accommodate 225,000 residents once it is completed. Completion is 
scheduled for 2015. Ultimately, PlanIT has a goal of having 100,000,000 sensors deployed. 
Fujisawa Sustainable Smart Town (SST) [97] in Japan is also another project which is currently 
under development. Fujisawa is scheduled to be completed by 2014 and fully inhabited by 2018, and 
development has started in September 2012. It is being developed on 19 ha of land, with the goal of 
accommodating 1,000 residents. Targets of 70% reduction of carbon emission are planned. 
Amsterdam, unlike the previously mentioned fully ubiquitous cities which are being built from 
scratch, has seen some recent developments en route to make it a smart city. The main driver of this 
development is Amsterdam Smart City project [98], which started in 2009, with the main goal of 
increasing green growth using technology. Currently, there are various initiatives within the scope of 
Amsterdam Smart City; these services are tested in specific city locations, such as IJburb. It includes 
innovations such as West Orange (a residential energy management system, which is able to let users 
know about their energy consumption on a per appliance basis) and a smart grid initiative in Nieuw 
West which services about 10,000 households. In Groningen, there is a pilot project aiming to develop 
a system which will use GPS data for real time information of bus locations, readily available to users’ 
mobile phones through a downloadable application [99]. 
The city council of Norfolk has also pilot projects which aim to make data services delivery to 
citizens more efficient, through the improvement of their data collection and data analysis, to 
ultimately gain improved customer insight [100]. This project also aims to develop schemes of 
delivering data to groups of users through localized and personalized web services, based on users’ 
geographical location. 
Another pilot project which has recently received significant attention is in Santander [101]. This is 
collaboration between academia and industry players which aims to conduct IoT research in available 
large scale test-beds. Currently, various sensor nodes are deployed in the city. A backbone provides the 
architecture necessary for all communication between these sensor nodes.  
Examples of applications enabled by sensor networks in Smart Santander include traffic 
management, irrigation optimization for parks and gardens, augmented reality and waste management. 
Eventually, it is envisaged that 12,000 sensors and actuators will be deployed throughout the city by 
2013. Currently, there are approximately 2,000 nodes deployed. Examples of implemented trial 
Sensors 2013, 13 
417 
 
 
applications include outdoor parking area management, real time monitoring of light, temperature and 
environmental noise, as well as participatory sensing using sensors in mobile phones. 
In Barcelona, there are also important initiatives [102]. As part of this initiative, for instance, 
sensors have been deployed in garbage bins. Firstly, these allow remote monitoring of the content of 
bins, which enable the development of an improved garbage collection system, therefore optimizing 
garbage collection services. Additionally, built-in sensors monitor the content type in bins and smart 
humidity sensors enable an automated intelligent water use for public park irrigation. Panels 
strategically placed announce free parking places, saving residents’ time in locating parking spots. 
Sensors on streetlights detect presence and adjust the light intensity accordingly as well. 
In Malaga, another smart city initiative in Spain, smart city initiatives aim to achieve a reduction of 
more than 6,000 tons of carbon dioxide annually [103]. To this end, Malaga has invested significantly 
in the city infrastructure, including investments in a fiber optic network, municipal Wi-Fi networks and 
geographic information systems for the virtualization of urban indicators. The current deployment 
includes more than 17,000 deployed smart meters. 
Vienna is another city with a number of initiatives from the smart city perspective. The main 
initiatives in Vienna deal primarily with energy efficiency, carbon footprint reduction and climate 
protection [104]. A large number of projects are currently underway in Vienna. Table 4 summarizes 
the goals of the cities discussed in this section.

7. Challenges 
There are various challenges related to sensing in smart cities, both of a technical and social nature. 
Some of these challenges are: 
Addressing and coordination issues between sensor nodes: when nodes are deployed in 
millions, how can they be efficiently managed? Although 6LoWPAN enables IPv6 addressing 
support on IEEE 802.15.4, efficient coordination (in terms of routing, for instance) between 
such a high number of devices is a big challenge. 
Sensors 2013, 13 
418 
 
 
Security: enabling technologies for sensing applications have a number of issues which have  
to be considered within the context of smart cities. These networks will be prone to  
cyber-terrorism and cyber-vandalism. Some of these issues are highlighted in [105] and [106]. 
Data ownership and privacy: who will own the rights for all data collected by these sensing 
applications? For instance, if the electricity utility has access to an individual’s energy 
consumption data, can that data be used without one’s consent? 
Trust: can individuals trust the entities responsible for aggregating and storing their data? For 
instance, the Cloud can be considered a central information system where access to data is 
typically controlled by the company which owns the infrastructure. Can these companies  
be trusted? 
Social Issues: residents have always been actively involved in a city. For instance, there are 
collaborative initiatives where people come together and help keeping the city clean by 
promoting no littering, etc. Will smart cities (with all the automated processes and sophisticated 
technology), create some sort of disconnect between the people and the city? Then there is the 
issue of education as well. Is the average person educated enough to use and understand all 
these systems? 
Centralized control: it is evident from the content of this paper that we are moving towards a 
centralized control scheme, where all services are being progressively aggregated, to be 
managed by one huge central system. This translates to complete control by the governing 
bodies, which can be used to illegally track people or invade someone’s privacy. This is related 
to the trust and privacy issues previously mentioned. 
Costs incurred in upgrading current cities: how expensive will it be to upgrade current cities 
to make them smart cities? As smart cities are heavily dependent on communication and other 
infrastructures, it will certainly be very expensive to update all the current systems. 
The reader is referred to [48], where the authors discuss the major technical challenges of WSNs in 
smart-grid applications. 
8. Conclusions 
In this paper, the role of advanced sensing in smart cities was discussed. An array of applications in 
smart cities which can benefit from advanced sensing were described. These include infrastructure 
health monitoring, electricity and water distribution systems, transportation systems and surveillance, 
amongst others. The state of the art in each of the considered applications is reviewed and inherent 
challenges are highlighted. In a world where carbon emissions have to be reduced for greener living 
and sustainability is promoted, there are a still a lot of challenges to be resolved. 
It is evident that the evolution of technology will play a major role in advanced sensing, as the 
evolution of hardware required for sensing applications will certainly be driven by these technological 
advances. Even though there are pilot projects for smart cities, there are various challenges. These 
challenges require a holistic approach for solving, which will involve multi-disciplinary collaborations. 
For instance, standardization efforts should consider all involved parties, such as municipalities, 
utilities and other services providers so that unified solutions in terms of sensing and communication 
infrastructures are put in place. It will be inefficient to have separate infrastructures (in terms of 
Sensors 2013, 13 
419 
 
 
sensing platforms), but it will also be challenging to unify these services under a single infrastructure 
(i.e., have the same network on the water distribution system as well as the electricity system). 
Furthermore, non-technical challenges regarding social issues, like education, also need to be 
considered. In the context of smart city, it is expected that people will have a certain level of skill to 
understand these systems and be able to use them. For instance, the innovative solution brought about 
by advances in sensing technologies, such as improved demand prediction and smart metering, result 
in a more efficient electricity distribution system, where the customer also plays a role, by adhering to 
incentive programs. But to what extent does the customer want to be really involved? Some 
individuals might not even take advantage of such services. These factors should be taken into 
consideration before services are implemented. 
Although there are already existing systems and initiatives for smart cities, the infrastructure to 
implement a fully ubiquitous city will be costly. Furthermore, the cost of restructuring existing cities to 
fit the fully ubiquitous city model will incur much higher costs. 
The first pilot projects mentioned in this paper will serve as a model for fully ubiquitous cities to be 
implemented in future, and will provide insights into additional challenges in the realization of smart 
cities. Still, there are numerous challenges to be solved before fully ubiquitous cities become a reality.

In the midst of this exciting development, we examine the strategic role of logistics and transportation services for creating economic, environmental and social values. Also, we discuss some new research directions. Previous article in issue Next article in issue Keywords Industry 4.0Additive manufacturingBlockchainDronesArtificial intelligenceLogisticsTransportation 1. Introduction Industry 4.0 is a term that originates from a German government project that promotes the computerized manufacturing in 2011. Industry 4.0 is also referred to as the “fourth industrial revolution” since the industrial revolution that took place in the 18th century. The first industrial revolution improved the productivity of the iron and textile industries by using steam power; and the second industrial revolution took place just before WWI and created reduced manufacturing cost by using electric power to create mass production. With the development of personal computers and the internet in the 1980s, the third industrial revolution transformed the economic landscape (Rifkin, 2011). After the term Industry 4.0 was revived in 2011 by the German economic development agency, the fourth industrial revolution builds on the third, leveraging emerging technologies (or Industry 4.0 technologies) such as Additive Manufacturing, Advanced Robotics, Artificial Intelligence, Autonomous Vehicles, Blockchain, Drones, Internet of Things, etc. Unlike the previous three, Schwab (2016) argues that the fourth industrial revolution is fundamentally different because it leverages connectivity and communication among billions of devices. These emerging technologies along with voluminous real-time data will transform the manufacturing and service operations along a global supply chain, and change the interactions between humans (consumers and supply chain partners) and machines. Currently, many companies are exploring ways to create value by exploiting these Industry 4.0 technologies. According the McKinsey Global Institute, operations and equipment optimization in the factory setting can generate up to $3.7 Trillion of value by 2025 (Manyika et al., 2015). More recently, Frank et al. (2019) examine different economic and technological drivers for companies to adopt various Industry 4.0 technologies. Based on a survey of 92 manufacturing companies, they find that computerized (or smart) manufacturing is a key driver. The notion of Industry 4.0 or the Fourth Industrial Revolution has kindled public interest. For instance, according to the data obtained from Google Trends, the number of google searches (worldwide) that contained the term “Industry 4.0” or “Fourth Industrial Revolution” began in 2012 and 2015; respectively, and the number of searches continued to increase as of March 2019 (Fig. 1). Most of the searches took place since 2016. It is interesting to note that most of the related queries are: “what is industry 4.0”, “internet of things,” or “what is the fourth industrial revolution?” Based on these queries, it appears that Industry 4.0 is a relatively new topic that deserves a better understanding. Currently, consulting firms such as IBM, McKinsey, and Deloitte are issuing different reports to explain the term Industry 4.0 and its impact (Zhang, 2017, Baur and Wee, 2015; and Deloitte Insights, 2018).

Number of Google Searches conducted between January 2011 to March 2019 that contains the keywords “Industry 4.0” or “Fourth Industrial Revolution”. The vertical scale is normalized to 100. We also searched through Scopus citation database by using the keywords “Industry 4.0” or “Fourth Industrial Revolution” that appear in the title, abstract, or keywords of academic articles published between 2012 and 2018. As shown in Fig. 2, there were 2320 published articles that contain the keywords “Industry 4.0” (and 329 articles that contain the keyword “Fourth Industrial Revolution”). Also, most of the research articles that contain the keywords “Industry 4.0” appeared in engineering journals (25%), computer science journals (11%) and business journals (8%). We obtain a similar result for those articles that contain the keywords “Fourth Industrial Revolution”. Download : Download high-res image (129KB) Download : Download full-size image Fig. 2. Number of academic articles published between 2012 and 2018 that contains the keywords “Industry 4.0” or “Fourth Industrial Revolution”. In summary, Fig. 1, Fig. 2 reveal that Industry 4.0 is an emerging topic and the research in this area is nascent. Hence, there is a golden opportunity for the operations management (OM) research community to understand the implications of this new revolution, to identity novel research questions, and to examine the conditions under which these emerging technologies can create economic, environmental, and/or social value. 1.1. A brief description of technologies associated with Industry 4.0 We now provide a brief description of different technologies associated with Industry 4.0. The reader is referred to Berman (2012) for a detailed description about 3D printing, Babich and Hilary (2019) for an extensive discussion about the strengths and weaknesses of Blockchain, and Olsen and Tomlin (2019) for more discussion on other technologies. • Additive manufacturing (also known as 3D printing). This is a technology that uses a digital 3D representation of an object and produces the physical object by depositing layers of materials (plastic, resin, stainless steel, ceramics, etc.). Additive manufacturing can enable firms to develop prototypes (product prototypes) and personalized products (hearing aids, knee replacements, and even toys) faster, cheaper and better (Berman, 2012, Sodhi and Tang, 2017). In the context of spare parts, Song and Zhang (2018) find that additive manufacturing creates more value to the firm as the number of parts increases. For the design of components, Westerweel et al. (2018) found that the higher design cost of additive manufacturing can be overcome with reduced logistical cost and reduced lead-time. From the strategic perspective, Dong et al. (2018) show that a firm that adopts additive manufacturing will offer more product variety to compete. Motivated by RepRap, a company that produces 3D printers that can replicate themselves, Hu and Sun (2019) study the tradeoff between production and sales of these self-replicable 3D printers. The reader is referred to Rogers et al. (2016) for a comprehensive discussion of different research questions arising from 3D printing services. More recently, Hedenstierna et al. (2019) examine the role of 3D printing in the context of outsourcing. • Advanced robotics. The advancements of the communication technologies, sensor capabilities, and artificial intelligence are making robots smarter so that they can work safely alongside human workers. For example, BMW has robots and human workers work alongside on its assembly line in its plant in South Carolina. Also, wearable robotics with exoskeletons can aid human workers to reduce repeated motion injuries due to lifting heavy boxes in the warehouse or harvesting fruits in the field. Companies such as Caterpillar and GE are exploring the adoption of wearable robotics to improve worker safety. JD.com, the largest online retailer in China, has adopted various advanced robots to stack products on shelves and pack merchandise in 500 warehouses (Marr, 2018). By 2019, JD.com implemented the world’s first automated warehouse in Shanghai equipped with Mujin robots (Hornyak, 2019). • Drones. Drones are unmanned aerial vehicles that can be controlled remotely. These drones can carry different sensors to record data (visual and audio) for monitoring and surveying operations, to carry certain devices including robotic arms for pick up and drop off operations, or automated sprays for farming operations. Drones can be viewed as an element of the internet of things. More recently, drones have been used for search and rescue operations. • Internet of Things (IoT). The internet of things refers to a system of devices (e.g., sensors) that can communicate and interact with others over the internet, and this system can be remotely monitored and controlled. With drastic reduction in cost and increase in processing speed for these sensors and significant improvements in measurement and communication technologies, the adoption rate of internet of things is growing exponentially in recent years. Columbus (2018) reported that, by 2020, Discrete Manufacturing, Transportation & Logistics and Utilities industries are projected to spend $40B each on IoT platforms, systems, and services. • Blockchain. A Blockchain is a distributed and secure ledger. As articulated by Olsen and Tomlin (2019), it is distributed because it can be written and accessed by different (possibly authorized) entities and its data is stored on a peer-to-peer network. Also, it is secure because once a “block” has been added to the chain (i.e., information written by an entity), it cannot be altered unilaterally. Despite these promises, Babich and Hilary (2019) identified several weaknesses of blockchain ranging from lack of privacy, garbage-in-garbage-out, inefficient, etc. Wang et al. (2019) conducted in-depth interviews with 14 supply chain experts to explore how blockchain technology may transform supply chain operations in the future. • Artificial Intelligence (AI). In contrast to the “natural intelligence” possessed by humans, AI mimics natural intelligence using computers to interpret external data, to learn from such data, and use those learnings to conduct descriptive, predictive, or prescriptive analysis. For example, IBM Watson is an AI system that is capable of answering questions posed in natural language. Also, GE uses sensors to collect data from its gas turbines or windmills via its Predix Cloud (an online platform), and then use machine learning and deep learning algorithms to conduct preventive maintenance before a breakdown. As the above technologies are being developing, many firms are exploring different ways to exploit these exciting Industry 4.0 technologies. At the same time, OM researchers are establishing different research agendas. 1.2. Logistics: a diamond in the rough Within the context of Industry 4.0, OM research has been focusing on the manufacturing applications of these exciting technologies (Olsen and Tomlin, 2019). This trend is understandable because the term Industry 4.0 was originally intended to promote the computerization of manufacturing by the German government since 2011. The manufacturing focus is reflected from a recent survey of 1600 C-level executives across 19 countries conducted by Deloitte: 73% of the respondents reported that they are currently developing Industry 4.0 based technology initiatives that focus on improving operations (mostly in manufacturing), and yet only 6% focus on logistics (Deloitte Insights, 2018). This observation implies that many firms undervalue of the strategic role of the logistics function as a competitive lever or as a business model1. The minor role that logistics plays in the mind of company executives motivated us to examine the strategic role of logistics in the Industry 4.0 era in this paper. Specifically, we shall argue how companies can leverage Industry 4.0 technologies to create economic, environmental and social value by transforming the logistics function as: 1. A competitive lever; 2. A social value creator; and 3. An enabler for sustainability. In the remaining of this paper, we use some real examples to illustrate how different Industry 4.0 technologies can enable a firm, a government, or an NGO to do good and do well at the same time. Also, we pose some research questions for OM researchers to explore further. 2. Logistics service as a competitive lever Despite logistics is an important function that gets the right product to the right customer at the right time, many executives tend to view logistics as a cost to be managed and often overlook the fact that logistics can cause a company to make or break. Consider the downfall of Blockbuster in 2010. Being the world’s largest video rental company in 2004 with over 9000 stores world-wide, Blockbuster allowed each customer to rent a video from a store for a fixed fee, but the customer must return the video tape or DVD back to the same store within a 2-day time window (to avoid penalty). As the de facto monopoly, customers tolerated this business model even when they have to pay the penalty for being later or for returning the video to a different store. However, when Netflix came along in the late 90 s and allowed each customer to return his DVD in a pre-paid postage envelope at their own convenience and to receive the next DVD in his queue automatically by mail afterwards, Blockbuster lost the patronage and filed for bankruptcy in 2010. This example highlights the importance of the logistics function from the customer perspective. Another case in point, the demise of online grocery store Webvan and online furniture store furniture.com was partly due to poor logistics performance: customers complained about late deliveries and missing items, and the firm faced high “last mile” delivery cost. The above examples suggest that, to compete successfully in the retail sector, logistics is key. This may explain why largest online retailers such as Amazon and Alibaba’s Tmall invest heavily in logistics. To compete in the e-tailing sector, fast (and even free) and reliable delivery services become a competitive lever for an online store to differentiate itself from other online stores selling similar products at similar prices. By leveraging Amazon’s Whole Foods stores2, Amazon offers 2-hour home grocery delivery services (Amazon Prime Now) to its prime members at selected locations in the United States. Also, instead of relying on UPS and FedEx, Amazon created “Amazon Logistics” delivery service in 2018 to gain better control of the last mile delivery performance (speed, reliability, and cost). In 2018, the company’s fulfillment and shipping expenses amounted to $34.0 billion and $27.7 billion respectively, up from just over $1 billion each in 2007. The total logistics cost $61.7 billon accounts for 27.5% of its net revenue (Richter, 2019). Buchman (2018) reported that Amazon operates 258 distribution and fulfillment centers in the United States and additional 486 such centers around the world by using thousands of trucks and 32 Boeing 767 aircraft. In China, to compete in online retailing, Alibaba took majority ownership of its subsidiary logistics unit Cainiao3 in 2017, and pledged to invest $15 billion over five years to build out a global logistics network. Based on the recent focus of Amazon and Alibaba on logistics, it is evident that logistics should not be viewed as a cost center. Instead, logistics service is a weapon that enables firms to compete on speed, reliability and cost. The advent of new technologies can affect the logistics function in several fundamental ways: 1. Faster Speed: delivery services conducted by drones or delivery robots. To speed up the delivery service, Amazon is exploring the use of drones for delivering small packages. In China, Alibaba’s food delivery unit Ele.me4 started delivering foods by drones in 2018 on 17 different routes from over 100 local restaurants in Shanghai’s Jinshan Industrial Park covering an area of 58 square kilometers (Tao and Yang, 2018). In 2019, Google got approval to use its Wing drones for home deliveries in Australia. In the meantime, researchers started to focus on the required operational models to route the drones to different customer (e.g. Carlsson and Song, 2018, Agatz et al., 2018). Also on the ground, unmanned vehicles are tested for faster deliveries, like the delivery robots of Domino’s pizza. To speed things up even further, Amazon filed a patent called “anticipatory shipping” in 2014. The key idea is to use predictive analytic tools to analyze a customer’s shopping history along with other customers’ shopping history to predict what she may need. In theory, anticipatory shipping would enable Amazon to ship products (possibly by drones) to consumers even “before” they even order them (Kopalle, 2014). 2. Higher Reliability: storage and retrieval systems using robots. To automate the storage and retrieval operations at Amazon’s fulfillment centers, Amazon spent $775 million in 2012 to acquire Kiva robotic system. The Kiva system improves productivity by recording and tracking items within the fulfillment center and by bringing the products directly to employees to pick, pack, and ship. These systems require careful design choices and operating strategies, for example Roy et al. (2019) analyzes the effects of different robot storage zone assignment and queue allocation strategies. The development of robotics exoskeletons (as wearable robotics along with sensors) can help the employees to improve the speed and reliability of their pick and pack operations and reduce repeated motion injury at the workplace (Ashley, 2017). 3. Lower Operating Cost: inventory monitor and replenishment systems using smart sensors. In physical stores, real time information about inventory on the shelves is often inaccurate and costly to obtain (DeHoratius et al. 2008). The reduction in cost and the improvement in capability of different sensors offer a new opportunity for stores to develop “smart shelves” using weight sensors that can monitor the existing quantity of items on the shelves, notify stock room staff to refill inventory before the item gets depleted from the shelf, and inform warehouse or vendor for immediate replenishment. Besides smart shelves, start-up company Wasteless.co is running different pilots with supermarket chains (e.g. with Ahold-Delhaize) using electronic tags to implement dynamic pricing. In the shelves of fresh products (e.g., meat, cheese, etc.), different items of the same product may have different expiration dates, and savvy customers will purchase the freshest item that has the longest expiration date. The new price tags of Wasteless show different prices depending on the expiration date: items with a short expiration date is sold at a discount defined by a smart algorithm considering multiple factors like weather (on a rainy day almost expired BBQ meat needs more discount than on a sunny day). Some pilot runs conducted in Italy suggest a reduction of 89% in food waste, according to Wasteless (Pieters, 2019). In a related development, AWM Smart Shelf offers additional value beyond logistics: it uses cameras mounted on its smart shelves to gather data on shopper behavior and demographics. By using various Artificial Intelligence tools to analyze a massive data, AWM can develop personalized videos to display on its smart shelves according to age, gender, or ethnicity (Horowitz, 2019). One step further, the inventory of a final end consumer in its house can also be measured. Think of Samsung’s smart fridges with cameras with which the owners get full information about inventory, expiration dates etc. Finally, with real time inventory information at different warehouses, an online retailer can make real time decisions about product price and the warehouse from which an incoming order is filled (Lei et al., 2018). 4. Improve Efficiency: Container shipping enabled by blockchain. Because ocean freight operations involve many organizations (exporters, terminal operators, trucking companies, customs officers, freight forwarders, ocean carriers, insurance companies, banks, importers, etc.) and lots of paper work (bill of lading, invoice, certificate of origin, freight shipping forms, inspection certificate, export packing list, insurance certificate, etc.) and because many processes are done manually, long and uncertain delays are commonly observed. Djankov et al. (2010) reported that the average export time in Asia is 25 days with a standard deviation of 12 days. When in early 2019 container ship MSC Zoe lost containers in front of the Dutch and German coast it took them weeks before the exact number (more than 340) of lost containers was known. To improve the efficiency of this archaic process of a $200 billion ocean freight industry, IBM and Maersk (the largest container carrier in the world) formed a partnership in 2017 to develop a blockchain platform to automate the process so that documents for shipping containers can be digitalized and containers can be tracked. By leveraging the distributed and secure capability of blockchain technology, all updated information and documentation can be verified and reconciled by all involved parties without duplication errors, and more importantly, without delay (Groenfeldt, 2017). In April 2019, China Shipbuilding Industry Company Limited (CSICL), a subsidiary of shipping giant China Shipbuilding Industry Corporation, signed an agreement with Shanghai Bank, under which it will explore the use of blockchain technology to financing its upstream suppliers. Besides ocean freight, Choi et al. (2019) examine the potential benefits of using blockchain technology on implementing the mean–variance (MV) theory for risk analysis in the context of air logistics. As these Industry 4.0 technologies are helping firms to transform their logistics functions as competitive weapons instead of cost centers, we propose a few research questions for further studies. 1. How should a firm redesign its supply chain structure to align with the transformed logistics services in the Industry 4.0 era? 2. How would these emerging technologies affect the way supply chain partners communicate, coordinate and collaborate? For example, should a retailer (customer) share its smart shelf (fridge) data with vendors so that vendors can offer “anticipatory replenishment” services? 3. How would 3D-printing affect the logistics industry? For instance, instead of purchasing a physical product (e.g., a toy), customers can download a digital file and print the product at home, by passing the entire physical supply chain (except for the transport of the raw materials). 4. Will the economic value created by blockchain outweigh its implementation cost? For example, Will the economic benefit created by the operational efficiency in container shipping through blockchain far exceed its implementation cost? 5. What is the impact of advanced robotics on job design of human workers? Will advanced robotics become a complement or substitute of a human worker? 6. How would drones and robots take over the home deliveries? Will there be drones and delivery robots everywhere? How to organize and regulate these unmanned delivery services without crating chaos? 3. Logistics as a social value creator Besides transforming the logistics arm of a firm into a competitive weapon, various emerging technologies can improve the logistics operations by creating social value. Consider the challenges that the World Food Program5 (WFP) faces when distributing food and cash to refugees in war-torn countries or beneficiaries in disaster zones. Putting aside the challenges of getting the supplies, the distribution of food and cash is even more challenging because the distribution infrastructure is usually non-existent and the information record about legitimate recipients is either incomplete or inaccurate. Consequently, fraudulent claims are common and many legitimate recipients end up not getting the aid. With the advancements of blockchain technology, WFP worked with Parity Technologies, a startup led by ethereum co-founder Gavin Wood to develop a blockchain platform called “World Food Programme Building Blocks” in 2017 that uses a distributed ledger to record the iris image of each refugee6. In doing so, the authentication process is only a simple iris scan that is efficient and accurate. This way, each legitimate refugee in Jordan can get their rationed food supply, and even cash for women who participate in the UN Women’s Cash for Work Programme in Jordan (Judkslian, 2018). We now provide a few examples in this section and conclude with a few research questions. 1. Faster and safer response and recovery operations using drones. After a natural disaster such as hurricane or forest fire, the traditional use of helicopters for response and recovery mission can be costly and even dangerous for the responders when the mission takes place at difficult terrain and at night. For example, one week after the landfall of Hurricane Harvey in 2017, FAA (Federal Aviation Administration) authorized 43 small drones to fly below 400 feet and away from large crowds of people to enable local authorities, and local transportation and utility companies to assess damage to homes, roads, bridges, power lines, etc. Also, Allstate insurance deployed drones to collect visual images of homes and send footage to Allstate’s claim adjusters so that they can evaluate different insurance claims (Marshall, 2017). In the same vein, search and rescue missions along rivers and coastlines are labor and resource intensive and inefficient. By using a drone equipped with a heat-sensitive infrared camera, it can quickly search a given search area and scan for images that fits the outline of a human being. In doing so, rescue forces can be sent directly to the exact location to perform the rescue function. Finally, on smaller scale accidents, drones can be life savers. In several countries such as US and the Netherland, some cities are equipped with automated external defibrillator (AED) drones that can be dispatched quickly to save patients who suffer from sudden heart attacks. 2. Improve accessibility to diagnostic care and drug administration by using wearable medical devices. In rural areas of many developing countries, the access of diagnostic care and pharmacy services is limited for two key reasons: (a) rural clinics are either not available or over-crowded; or (b) rural clinics are perceived as low quality. Quite often, many rural patients travel long distance to seek health services in cities. With the advancements of different wearable medical devices, patients can share their medical data with their online doctors via telemedicine. A wearable medical device can be defined as a biosensor that collects physiological data (heart rate, body temperature, blood pressure, blood oxygen, glucose level, etc.) in real time. For example, Apple Watch Series 2 can monitor most data, Dexcom G6 is a continuous glucose wearable device that can sync its data with iOS and Android smart devices. With wearable medical devices that can sync with various smart devices, many Chinese patients are sharing their medical data with their online doctors via various telemedicine platforms that are more accessible and affordable (Liu, 2018). Besides monitoring various physiological data of a user, Covestgro (formerly Bayer MaterialSience LLC) launched a new wearable medical device Makroblend M525 in 2015 that can monitor vital signs during physical activity or administer drugs. Backed by Sanofi, Enable Injections is developing a wearable device that can deliver IV drugs that may connect to smartphones via Bluetooth (Muoio, 2018). 3. Improve farmer productivity by using drones and smart sensors. As the world population continues to grow and as the size of arable land continues to shrink, there is a need to develop ways to improve farmer productivity for growing more food in a cost-effective and time-efficient manner. This need has motivated some startup companies to create innovative business services in agriculture (also known as Agriculture 4.0) by developing drones with special sensors and cameras that can interact with smartphones and computers. In France, a startup company Delair-Tech is developing a drone that can enable farmers to monitor crops for diseases, assess yield and identity where fertilizer is needed as in “precision farming”. This service is based on a subscription, and the Economist reported that it plans to charge 15 Euros per hectare. 4. Improve provenance by using blockchain. After a series of food and drug adulteration incidents (milk formula scandal in China, Heparin adulterated with melamine, counterfeit drugs) in recent years (Babich and Tang, 2012) many companies are under pressure to disclose provenance information about names of suppliers, materials used and produced by suppliers, etc. The logistics for identifying, monitoring and tracking the operations along a supply chain is very costly and time consuming. For this reason, many firms are using blockchain technology to track the provenance of products such as fish, pork, coffee, etc. Also, Walmart and nine other firms (Nestle, Dole, Tyson Foods, Unilever, etc.) partnered with IBM to use blockchain to track and trace provenance so that they can improve food safety and be more responsive to food recalls. Besides food, Luxury brand conglomerate LVMH, launched a blockchain platform in 2019 to track provenance so that it can authenticate certain luxury goods (Allison, 2019). 5. Improve mobility via smart transportation. The underlying challenges for the poor, the sick, and the elderly to get around result in “social exclusion”. Therefore, to improve social inclusion, easy access to affordable mobility is essential. With the advent of Internet of Things and the massive adoption of smartphones, Mobility as a Service (MaaS) initiatives are popping up at many cities with Helsinki in Finland as the leading example (Goodall et al. 2017). The underlying concept of MaaS is to provide all mobility options, which include public (trains, busses, etc.) and private (taxi, Uber, car/bike sharing) services as an “integrated” service provided by a single app (e.g., Whim in Helsinki). This app offers travel suggestions to customers based on their personal travel preferences in terms of modes, costs and travel time. Once a customer selected a multi-modal travel plan, he can pay for this travel plan via mobile payment through this app. As different cities are developing different MaaS app, there is hope that these apps can offer accessible and affordable mobility options to city dwellers7. 6. Currently, many firms are developing autonomous cars/taxis for transporting people; however, due to safety concerns, it will still take a long time before autonomous cars are able to drive everywhere under all circumstances (especially the interaction with bikers and pedestrians and severe weather conditions are challenging). However, autonomous buses on dedicated lanes are already employed and NEXT Future Transportation Inc.8 is even testing autonomous vehicles in Dubai where people can transfer inside from one vehicle to another vehicle. It has the potential to make the cost of mobility even lower to improve affordable and accessible. There is an on-going research stream that examines the impact of the implementation of autonomous vehicles on the movement of people (e.g., Gkartzonikas and Gkritza, 2019, Olsen and Parker, 2019). 7. Finally, in the Industry 4.0 era, traditional public transportation systems such as railways are going through different transformations. For example, in the Netherlands, Netherlands Railways is using smart sensors to monitor the weights of different railcars and to predict the future capacity (sitting and standing) of each railcar before the train arrives at the next station. Then Netherlands Railways can use its mobile app to notify passengers waiting on the platform at the next station about available space on different railcars. This real time information can lead to faster dwell times, fewer delays, and better customer service quality. To shorten dwell times and reduce unnecessary delays even further, Netherlands Railways has equipped all conductors with smart watches informing them the exact second at which the train should depart. 8. In the grand scheme of things, Industry 4.0 technologies enable a smart city to create new social values derived from the interconnectivity of smart buildings, smart grid, smart mobility and smart retail. Qi and Shen (2019) discuss several research opportunities arising from the increasing integration of smart systems and business models at the urban scale. The above examples illustrate how Industry 4.0 technologies can create social value. At the same time, it raises several research questions. 1. By leveraging the data collected by different wearable medical devices, how should the government (or an insurance company) develop incentive mechanisms to encourage users to improve their health conditions? 2. Precision farming based on drones can certainly provide value to farmers. However, to monetize this type of service when farmers are unsure about its value, how should a service provider determine its pricing strategies? Should it be subscription based? Should the firm consider a risk-sharing pricing strategy? 3. As different firms form partnership using blockchain technology to track and trace the operations along the supply chain, there is a concern about privacy. How can this issue be dealt with? To ensure that the virtual copy corresponds to the physical copy of the supply chain operations, who should audit the records and how often should the record be audited? 4. Mobility as a Service requires synchronization between many stakeholders (municipalities, transportation operators, data providers etc.) and the passengers. Which pricing mechanism should one use to coordinate supply and demand? How to organize monthly mobility subscriptions with a fixed/unlimited amount of miles per month? How to share the profit amongst different transportation operators? 4. Logistics as a sustainability enabler Besides economic and social values, there is a rising concern about “sustainability” and a clarion call for renewable energy, carbon footprint reduction, endanger species protection, and ecosystem sustainability. This concern is legitimate because the growing demand generated from the world’s growing and ageing population (from 7 billion in 2017 to over 9 billion by 2050) far exceeds the shrinking supply of natural resources (arable land, natural water sources, oil and gas, etc.)9. This concern has caused the public to become more aware about environmental issues (e.g., climate change, deforestation, and water and air pollution) and social issues (e.g., poverty, hunger, income inequality, gender equity, population growth) over the last two decades, and this public concern is also reflected in the Millennium Development Goals (United Nation 2000)10. For example, by analyzing global data on fisheries and ocean temperature maps between 1930 and 2010, scientists from Rutgers University in New Jersey discover that global warming has significantly affected fish stocks worldwide by 4% (Gerretsen, 2019). To make things worse, the ecosystem is damaged even further as fishing trawlers are catching all sea foods by pulling huge fishing nets along the bottom of the sea or in midwater at a specified depth in West Africa (Adams, 2019). Without immediate interventions and strict law enforcements around the world, the planet’s ecosystem is collapsing at an alarming rate. As the supply of natural resource is shrinking quickly, many firms are concerned about sustainable supply of raw materials in developing countries (e.g., coffee beans, cocoa beans, etc.) for their production. Currently, firms and governments are exploring ways to apply different emerging technologies to address some of the sustainability issues. 1. Protect endangered species from extinction by using drones and AI. Across Africa and Asia, illegal trades of endangered species that worth $7 to $10 billion annually are threatening the survivals of elephants, rhinoceros, tigers, etc. Just between 2007 and 2017, over 7245 African Rhinos have been lost to poaching and they will be extinct without immediate human interventions. Over the last decade, many organizations such as World Wildlife Fund (WWF) and Save the Rhino collected donations and contributed funds to recruit more rangers to safe guard these Rhinos. However, this approach is very costly and inefficient. Currently, scientists are developing innovative methods to save these animals. First, through direct observations obtained from various recording from drones, scientists from IBM learned that Zebras normally move along-side Rhinos. When facing a predator (e.g., a lion), a herd of zebra will scatter. However, when encountering a poacher with a gun, these animals will move in opposite direction. Anticipating this behavior, these scientists put radio collars on zebras so that they can monitor the location and movement of these zebras. This way, they can alert the rangers when the zebras move in opposite direction to reduce poaching. Second, by using machine learning and deep learning to analyze historical data on poaching incidents, computer scientists can predict when and where Rhinos were likely to be poached so that rangers and drones can patrol these target areas to prevent poaching. In 2012, Google offered $5 million to support WWF to expand its conservation-drone program in Africa and Asia to protect these animals from harm’s way (Tang, 2018). 2. Reduce water waste in farming by using drones and data analytics. In Chile, researchers are developing drones with spectral sensors and cameras that can allow farmers to monitor the condition of their crops from their smartphones. By analyzing the data captured by camera using spectral analysis, farmers can monitor moisture content, ground water, plant health, and pest infestation as well as growth rate of the plant. This way, farmers can “localize” water and pest control, saving water and improving yield (Scandella, 2015). Finally, a Spanish startup BrioAgro installs underground sensors to collect data on the moisture and light levels and the soil nutrients. By analyzing the data transmitted from these sensors to BrioAgro, the startup company prescribes “localized” water and fertilizer solutions via farmers’ mobile phone. In doing so, farmers can reduce water waste via precision farming. 3. Reduce emission via smart transportation. By leveraging the ridesharing information technology that enables a platform (e.g., Uber, Didi) to track and trace all vehicles and all customers in the system in real time, pooling services such as Uber (Pool), VIA and BlaBlaCar are becoming more popular. Also, autonomous vehicles can increase the number of shared rides even more in the future: a study in Switzerland indicates that 61% of the respondents prefer a pooled shared autonomous vehicle over a private autonomous vehicle (Stoiber et al., 2019). In addition to pooling rides among passengers, pooling between parcels and drivers (so called “crowd shipping”) is gaining traction. A crowd shipping platform assigns drivers (ordinary persons who registered with the platform) to parcels for them to deliver to their neighbors on their way back home from the office or from a shop. Therefore, by piggybacking the rides that the drivers would have taken anyway, this crowd shipping platform reduces the number of deliveries via traditional delivery vans and thereby reduces emissions. To push this crowd shipping idea further, it is possible for the platform to facilitate transfers of goods between crowd shippers reduces the system wide required travel distances even further (Sampaio et al. 2018). For a more detailed overview of crowd sourced logistics systems, the reader is referred to Sampaio et al. (2019b) for details. Crowd shipping is one of the initiatives to better utilize the space in individual’s cars. Another initiative is “trunk delivery service” under which a Logistics Service Provider (LSP) such as DHL can gain temporary access to the trunk of the customer’s car (Volvo, GM, Ford, or Lincoln) so that the LSP can deliver the goods even when the customer is not home. Doing so can reduce emissions because it reduces the need for the LSP to visiting the customer again or for the customer to pick up the goods at a designated collection point (Liu et al, 2019). However, the potential is even higher if customers can share their full itinerary with the LSP so that the LSP can choose the most convenient time slot and location for their deliveries (Reyes et al., 2017, Ozbaygin et al., 2017, and Sampaio et al. 2019a). 4. Sustain supply of high quality agricultural products by using blockchain. Many well sought after agricultural products (e.g., coffee beans, cocoa beans, shea nuts) are produced by smallholder farmers in developing countries. Because the supply chain operations is complex and often opaque and the market price of these products tend to fluctuate significantly, farmers get low and unstable wages (or prices) for their efforts. In many cases, they may abandon one crop and switch to a different crop, making the supply even more unstable. To sustain the supply of high quality coffee beans, Starbucks launched the C.A.F.E. program that is intended to help farmers to develop sustainable farming practices (e.g., organic farming, drip irrigation, etc.) and donated millions of disease-resistant trees (100 millions by 2025) to help farmers fight different threats such as coffee leaf rust. At the same time, Starbucks worked with various NGOs (e.g., Rainforest Alliance) to ensure farmers are compensated fairly for their sustainable farming practices. However, such effort is labor intensive and often inaccurate. To overcome this challenge, Denver’s Coda Coffee partnered with a startup bext360 to develop the world’s first blockchain-traced coffee that integrates machine vision, blockchain, cloud computing, and AI to trace every step: coffee bean collection, washing, drying, milling, export, roasting and retail operations (Philips, 2018). For instance, smallholder farmers in Uganda can deposit their collected beans into a “bextmachine” that uses 3D scanners, machine vision, and AI (machine learning) to determine the quantity and quality of the coffee beans. Then the bextmachine will issue a receipt to farmers so that they can collect fair payments. The above examples illustrate how these emerging technologies can be used to improve sustainability. As firms and government are applying these emerging technologies to improve sustainability, there are some research questions that deserve our attention: 1. Various technologies can be applied to reduce poaching of endangered species. However, as supply decreases, some ethical buyers may be willing to offer an even higher price. As such, more poachers will enter the market and create a potentially bigger problem. If one examines the supply and demand dynamics, how should the government develop programs to curb the demand instead of the supply of endangered species? 2. It is well known that approximately 80% of the fresh water withdrawn from rivers and groundwater is used to produce food and other agricultural products, what kind of incentive programs that the government should use to provide economic incentive for farmers to adopt water conservation solutions willingly? 3. Trunk deliveries and crowd shipping appear to be promising; however, the issues of trust and safety are two obstacles for these innovative ideas to take hold. What are the mechanisms that crowd shipping and truck deliveries should develop to ensure trust and safety for all involved parties? 4. While blockchain technology appears to be promising, there are potential weaknesses that can undermine the good intentions of different entities (Babich and Hilary, 2019). Also, because the adoption of blockchain technology requires participation and commitment of different entities, conflicts ensue. Saberi et al. (2019) propose four blockchain technology adoption barriers and future research directions. Therefore, a natural question is: what are the mechanisms that can facilitate commitments and self-enforcements for different entities to adopt blockchain technology? 5. Conclusion We have discussed the potential use of emerging technologies (drones, smart sensors, robotics, blockchain, artificial intelligence, etc.,) for transforming the logistics function from being mundane to exciting, and for enabling the logistics function as a competitive lever, a social value creator, and a sustainability enabler. Table 1 characterizes some of the research questions raised in this paper. Table1. Some key research questions arising from the logistics function in the Industry 4.0 era.

How should multiple transportation service providers develop an integrated service that benefits different stakeholders? How would big data analytics improve the productivity of sustainable farming? Blockchain How would blockchain affect the competitiveness of a logistics service provider? How should the government regulate blockchain technology that can balance conflicting objectives associated with different stakeholders? How would supply chain transparency facilitated by blockchain technology improve ethical supply chain practice? We have also raised some concerns about the applications of these technologies. Besides many technologies are not proven, they may create other problems including: social unrests due to job losses to automation (e.g., autonomous vehicles, robots, drones, etc.), social inequality due to the fact that these technologies often involve smart phones and smart devices that are still inaccessible by the poor, and even more severe income inequality especially when the technologies often create more benefits for the educated class. Given all these challenges, researchers should also examine the impact of these emerging technologies on the welfare of different socio-economic classes of citizens (Sodhi and Tang, 2014). Also, despite recent advances of different technologies that support the Industry 4.0 movement, companies must take measures to mitigate several underlying risks: • Cyberattacks. As supply chains are becoming more digitalized and rely on real time communication and coordination of many different devices (sensors, robots, drones, etc.), there is a heightened concern about cybersecurity. For instance, because industry 4.0 involves many devices communicating via different operating systems and different information systems, digitalized supply chains can be vulnerable to cyberattacks. These attacks can include industrial espionage, IP leakage, or even production sabotage. In some cases, cyberattacks can bring an entire logistics/transportation system to its knees. • Faulty data. Smart devices are capable of sensing, collecting, sharing, analyzing data, etc. so that they can facilitate many supply chain operations smoothly. However, if the system is being hacked or if the system is not functioned properly, disasters ensue as we witnessed two crashed of Boeing’s 737 Max in 2019 due to faulty readings of a key sensor. It is simply too risky to rely on smart devices to manage a supply chain; hence, companies must develop a fool-proof protocol with human interventions. • Safety regulations. Many firms are exploring the use of advance robotics and automated guided vehicles in manufacturing, robotic systems in automated storage and retrieval warehouse operations, and autonomous trucks and drones in delivery operations. Some standard safety guidelines and regulations must be developed to ensure worker and public safety. For instance, the operations of Heathrow and Gatwick airports in London airports were disrupted after unauthorized drones were flying within the restricted airspace in 2018. • Privacy issues. Many sensors record visuals and sounds of different movements of different people in many places. For example, many smart shelves record shopper’s demographic data and their shopping habits within a shop. As such, there is a legitimate concern over privacy issues about this massive data collection. The government must develop regulatory measures to ensure companies collect and store this data properly for public safety. In summary, the emerging technologies that support the Industry 4.0 movement create excitement because they are disruptive so that many new business models can emerge. At the same time, they create concerns over employment and safety. However, if the private and public sectors can collaborate with the government to establish mutually beneficial plans, these technologies can create value for companies and the society at large.

Specifically, in our view, the logistics function deals with the detailed coordination of a complex operation involving human, materials, equipment, information and finance. In many instances, this coordination entails the movements of materials, humans, and/or equipment, the exchanges of information among humans and or devices, and the transactions of finance among entities. 2 Amazon acquired Whole Foods for $13.7 billion in 2017 so that it can expand its home grocery deliver service Amazon Fresh in selected locations within the United States. 3 Cainiao Logistics is an internet technology company that specializes in “platform services” for logistics networks.

Sprinkler irrigation is a method that has high application efficiency, which can be further increased when coupled with automation toward precision irrigation. The objectives of this review are to summarize the main aspects of sprinkler and precision irrigation and their development, scope, and future prospects specifically in Asian countries. In this paper, a modified methodology, inspired by PRISMA guidelines, was used to explore the available literature to summarize the existing knowledge in the field. Regarding the technological aspects of the analyzed works, it became evident that sprinkler systems are an efficient method to not only irrigate crops (with 39% water saving) but also for the application of fertilizers with higher efficiency (>35%) and water productivity (>14.1%) compared with gravity irrigation systems. Moreover, this paper highlights the prominent features of precision irrigation for maximizing agricultural productivity. The use of sprinkler irrigation with precision applications using automation with a sensor-based mechanism for field data collection, data transformation, data analysis, and operation of IoT-based automatic solenoid valves can save 20–30% more irrigation water and increase crop yield by 20–27%. An analytical understanding and knowledge of the field were used to draw conclusions that are thought-provoking for scientists, researchers, and other stakeholders.

Introduction The Green Revolution has pushed many countries with agriculture-based economies to introduce reforms, resulting in rapid agricultural growth. The world’s agricultural growth can be assessed from the fact that only in China has total grain production reached 117% with a 2% annual increase [1]. The agriculture-based gross domestic product (GDP) is growing at a rate of 9.4% [2] worldwide. There are still opportunities to double agricultural productivity by adopting mechanized practices that enhance crop yields as well as crop intensity [3]. The prime input for agricultural production is water, which is even more important in irrigated agriculture and plays a vital role in food security. Irrigated agriculture represents one-fifth of agricultural land and about half of the production is being cultivated directly from irrigated agriculture, screening its potential for crop production with more diversification and intensification [4]. According to a study [5], 80% of cereal crops and 90% of vegetable crops are being grown under irrigated agriculture; therefore, this sector is being expanded in many countries through the introduction of essential and mechanized irrigation practices. This development of irrigated areas can be assessed from the growth of irrigated land in China (Figure 1) due to it being one of the world’s leading agricultural economies [1]. Figure 1. Development of irrigated areas in China (1950–2020) [6,7]. Growth in irrigated land demands more irrigation water and triggers the issue of water security. Being a major consumer, the world’s agriculture sector uses more than 70% of available freshwater [8]. The per capita water availability is decreasing all over the world and it has been projected that by 2050, 45 countries will be water scared (<500 m3/capita/annum) and 87 will be at the margin (<1700 m3/capita/annum) out of 180 countries [9], indicating increasing pressure on available water resources for the production of food to feed growing populations [10]. The provision of surface water resources to highly irrigated areas and the effective management of available resources are the only methods to sustain development in the agriculture sector to ensure the world’s food security with environmental sustainability [5]. This problem can be mitigated from two sides. One side is the enhancement of water availability by building storage infrastructures and the other side is the efficient use of water at the farm level [11,12,13]. In this respect, several projects in the 1990s were launched throughout the world to introduce water-efficient techniques for improving application efficiencies of traditional irrigation practices [14]. Under traditional irrigation systems, water is applied at constant intervals without considering the crop water requirements and the application efficiencies of these methods are also low as varying amounts of water are applied throughout the field. This uneven irrigation could over-irrigate a portion of the land while the other portion may experience water stress due to less irrigation [15,16,17]. Sprinkler irrigation is a type of high-efficiency irrigation system that has been used at the farm level since the late 1970s. This technology has proven its capability to save significant amounts of irrigation water with greater uniformity compared with other surface irrigation methods (basin, border, beds, furrow, etc.) [18,19] in addition to improvement in yield and fertilizer management with less leaching effects [20]. The proven facts regarding the benefits of sprinkler irrigation have encouraged farmer communities to use this method as an alternate system to overcome the problem of low application efficiency at the farm level. This technology has become very popular in Western countries, mainly in the USA and Europe with areas of 3 Mha and 2.5 Mha, respectively, under sprinkler irrigation until the 1970s [21]. Many countries like Australia, Israel, China, etc., have developed and adopted different types of sprinkler irrigation systems and these are very popular in these countries. The adoption rate of sprinkler irrigation has been reported as 4.78% [22]. In China, the government is promoting the sprinkler irrigation system by launching demonstration projects at farmer fields, providing funds to research institutions to carry out research work, and launching subsidies for industries to manufacture sprinkler components at the indigenous level. The effectiveness of these exertions is demonstrated by the fact (Figure 1) that sprinkler irrigation is being adopted by farmers at a high rate and is replacing other irrigation practices at their farms. The water and fertilizer efficiency of sprinkler irrigation could be further enhanced by introducing advanced interventions like precision irrigation practices within the regular operation of manually operated sprinkler irrigation systems. The precision irrigation system is a combination of an irrigation system coupled with a control system, communication system, and information system for water applications in a precise and automatic way to achieve the highest possible crop water productivity [23,24]. It has been reported that by adopting sprinkler irrigation with precision application tools, maximum economic benefits can be driven [25,26]. To understand the effectiveness and applicability of precision irrigation for absolute water management at the farm level, previous research needs to be reviewed in a meaningful way to identify the research trends and hot spot directions for future research work within the subject field. The present review paper is an effort to examine the available literature related to sprinkler irrigation and precision irrigation using quantitative analysis in a systematic way. A careful identification of key influential factors affecting the development of sprinkler irrigation toward precision application methods was carried out to draw conclusions and thereby provide a state-of-the-art understanding of the topic to readers. The purpose of this work is to describe the insights of the research topic, understand the ambiguities and research gaps within the scope, and draw consistencies between prior research work and future research directions for researchers. 2. Review Strategy and Exploration of Literature The spatial and temporal growth of research databases on a massive scale created a momentum toward summarizing research findings in an organized manner, leading to the development of new, systematic approaches to literature review since the start of the 21st century [27,28,29]. A huge number of scholarly literatures on the use of sprinklers and precision irrigation in the disciplines of agriculture and engineering is available; therefore, systematically productive approaches were taken into account to assess the advanced knowledge on said subjects. To start the review process, the domain of this paper was divided into two major portions called sub-domains. These included (1) “sprinkler irrigation” and (2) “precision irrigation”. Other topics related to “irrigation water management” were taken in the study as a miscellaneous domain. The development in the research volume regarding these domains and published review papers can be seen in Figure 2, presents the volume of literature available only in one database (PubMed). This gradual growth in particular research work demands the summarization of research outcomes of different researchers to set future research directions in the subject field. Figure 2. The production of research publications related to specific topics from January 2005 to May 2023. The methodology adopted in the present study is inspired by the PRISMA 2020 guidelines [30]. A new strategy was designed by intergrading the PRISMA 2020 guidelines and the review approaches used by other researchers [31,32,33]. The literature related to each sub-domain was searched according to four approaches, illustrated in Figure 3. These approaches involved searching research papers based on manuscript titles, the keywords, the institution affiliation, and the citations of published articles. To achieve a speedy review, all searches were conducted using online scholar databases including Google Scholar, IEEE Xplore, Wiley, Science Direct, Springer, MDPI, Taylor & Francis, and journal websites. In these huge scholarly libraries, numerous research articles are available related to sprinkler irrigation and precision irrigation; therefore, a sturdy criterion was developed and adopted for the selection of the most influential research findings to eliminate unsuitable search results. Figure 3. Illustration of the mechanism through which information on the sub-domains of this paper was summarized and extracted. 2.1. Inclusion/Exclusion Criteria A comprehensive criteria to include or exclude literature for review proceedings was adopted. The inclusion criteria included (1) research published in prestigious journals, (2) research published in English and Chinese language, (3) research findings based on actual field studies, (4) publications having proper citations and available on the internet, (5) publications having relevant data for onward calculations of different quantitative parameters, (6) priority was given to journal publications, and (7) the date of publication was after 2005. Similarly, the exclusion criteria included (1) review articles, (2) research publications with duplicate or similar results, (3) publications containing possible errors in the data, and (4) a publication date older than 2005. The process of obtaining the final search results is illustrated in Figure 4. Figure 4. Illustration of the process regarding the improvement in the review summary using inclusion/exclusion criteria. 2.2. Summary of the Review Process The information was reviewed from renowned research databases and journal websites. The reviewed publications were dated from 2005 to the present but, of course, preference was given to recent publications. Figure 5 presents a summary of the review process. In Figure 5a, the year-wise number of reviewed papers is presented. It can clearly be seen that the majority of papers were selected between 2012 and the present with a peak in 2022. In Figure 5b, the illustration of major review domains is shown. Most of the papers were reviewed related to sprinkler irrigation followed by precision irrigation. The papers related to all other topics are shown as other papers in Figure 5. In Figure 5c, the application of inclusion/exclusion criteria is given by illustrating the percentage of included papers, which was 85% of the total reviewed papers. The remaining 15% of papers were not included in this study because their results were found to be repeated with similar input conditions. Figure 5. Summary of (a) no. of review papers, (b) subject-wise reviews, and (c) included and excluded papers. 3. Sprinkler Irrigation Sprinkler irrigation is a type of pressurized irrigation that irrigates crops by spraying water in the form of small droplets like natural rainfall. It has numerous advantages over surface irrigation or even over other pressurized irrigation technologies like drip irrigation as it can not only apply water to a crop but also flush its leaves and regulate canopy temperature to improve the efficiency of the photosynthesis process. Many research studies have been conducted on sprinkler irrigation that proved its viability and adoptability for economically higher crop production [34,35,36,37]. These systems have some limitations and disadvantages over other pressurized irrigation systems. These disadvantages include higher capital and operational costs, damage to soft fruit plants, low application efficiency in windy areas, and unsuitability for fields with fine textured soil [38]. Under humid conditions, moisture-related diseases may emerge within the crop canopy due to the presence of excessive moisture after the application of overhead sprinklers [39]. Romero et al. [40] reported the outbreak of fungal-related diseases within crop plants grown under humid and warm conditions. Belo et al. [41] reported management techniques including irrigation time and frequencies to reduce the risks of spreading bacterial-related diseases due to heavy moisture and dirt being splashed into the plant canopy of onion plants. But on the other hand, foliar water application by using an overhead sprinkler is beneficial for plants and good for protecting plants against frost when the temperature is at or below zero °C [42]. Despite these minimal limitations, sprinkler irrigation has marvelous advantages with high water application efficiency in the field [43]. The field application efficiency of different irrigation systems in comparison with different sprinkler types is illustrated in Figure 6. Figure 6. Application efficiencies of different types of sprinkler systems. 3.1. Types of Sprinkler Systems In the early usage of sprinkler systems, single-point sprinklers were used with moveable positions, and the water was supplied to sprinklers through iron pipes [7]. The iron pipes were susceptible to erosion and heavy when moving sprinklers from one place to another. Iron pipes were replaced with aluminum pipes in the first phase and then with plastic/PVC pipes along with plentiful progress in the design of irrigation systems in the late 1990s [44]. By increasing the understanding of sprinkler systems, moveable machines were developed with sprinkler nozzles that can be transported throughout the field to irrigate entire areas with the same sprinkler setup. This kind of sprinkler system has high application efficiencies and more irrigation coverage with less labor requirements. This form of sprinkler system has many types and is adopted as per field conditions due to specific limitations associated with each type. The features and distribution uniformities (DUs) of different sprinkler systems were obtained from the literature [43,45] and are shown in Table 1. Generally, Equation (1) is used to calculate the DU of a sprinkler irrigation system. The DU range of each sprinkler type is provided in Table 1. The DU depends on the crop type, field condition, and environmental exposure of a sprinkler system. The maximum DU value belongs to lab experiments and the minimum value belongs to field conditions.

The center pivot system has many advantages over other types; therefore, this type of system has been installed in more than 13% of the area under sprinkler irrigation in China [46]. Researchers are working on a center pivot system to increase its efficiencies via a nozzle configuration corresponding to the particular movement speed [47,48]. Ma et al. studied the uniformity and the application efficacies of a two-span center pivot system and reported a 66.1–68.4% uniformity coefficient [49]. Several other researchers worked on other types of moveable sprinklers and conducted performance tests to determine their suitability and to improve the characteristics of existing systems [50,51,52,53]. Hand-mover gravity sprinklers are mostly used in hilly areas where sufficient gravitational head is available to operate sprinklers without irrigation pumps [54]. 3.2. Sprinkler Nozzle Sprinkler nozzles are key components in the whole sprinkler system and their uniform operation determines the efficiency of the system. The study of sprinkler nozzles was limited before the 1970s; however, the topics gradually received attention due to the increasing demand for sprinkler systems. In the late 1970s, work on designing impact sprinklers was started by an industrial group, and a series of sprinkler nozzles were designed with varying diameters (20 mm to 80 mm inner diameter). The Chinese government put a special effort into the development of new sprinkler nozzles by reverse engineering imported sophisticated nozzles and promoting research and development in the same area [50,55]. Currently, researchers and enterprises have been working on the development of new products and refining the hydraulic performance of existing sprinklers with structural improvements. Low-pressure sprinklers are an example of the improvement in the design of existing sprinklers. The research and development (R&D) work by researchers on sprinkler characteristics is presented in Table 2. 3.3. Low-Pressure Sprinklers The increase in energy demand and its high cost are forcing researchers to introduce new developments in the existing irrigation technologies so that these systems could still be used as a viable source in the new era. Normal sprinkler irrigation is operated at a high pressure of around (≥300 KPa), causing more energy consumption [56]. The low-pressure sprinkler is a new addition to the existing technology, enabling users to operate sprinklers at <200 KPa and subsequently lowering operating costs with different management strategies [56,57,58]. The key principle of designing a low-pressure sprinkler is to change the internal nozzle structure to reduce the operating pressure without compromising the dispersion uniformity of water droplets. Table 2. Research work on sprinkler nozzles by researchers. Li et al. designed a low-pressure rotary sprinkler with different dimensions of scatters and evaluated its performance; the authors reported satisfactory results regarding all selected performance parameters [47]. Other researchers improved the jet dispersion in low-pressure sprinklers by introducing a pair of aerated pipes inside the sprinkler nozzle [70]. The optimal groove numbers were identified during a series of experiments using D3000 range sprinklers after changing their plate structure [71]. Wang et al. [72] derived empirical equations for low-pressure sprinklers for operation under varying operating conditions and design parameters [73]. Ouazaa et al. derived a calculation model for cunnings of water distribution using low-pressure sprinklers [74]. Besides the changes in sprinkler design, researchers improved the field performance of sprinkler irrigation systems by optimizing the pipeline structure to reduce energy loss in order to promote the use of low-pressure sprinklers [75]. Tsaboula et al. studied the effects of different wind speeds on water spray through low-pressure sprinklers [76]. 3.4. Sprinkler Irrigation Use for Crop Production The use of sprinkler irrigation is not only for water saving but also to improve crop yield and reduce crop production costs by limiting crop inputs. Sprinkler irrigation has many advantages over other pressurized irrigation methods (drip irrigation) including rain characteristics and delivery of higher amounts of water during irrigation in time units. Sprinkler irrigation systems can be effective in large areas with less costly installation costs. The regular operation, maintenance, and operational troubleshooting of sprinkler irrigation systems are easier than drip irrigation. The benefits of sprinkler systems over other irrigation systems have been reported by many researchers [77,78,79,80,81,82]. Sprinkler irrigation can be applied to a variety of crops, soils, and field conditions compared with other systems. These are efficient for keeping crops well flourished and maximizing yield; therefore, about 6% of irrigated area in China has been covered with sprinkler irrigation [7]. Some prolific findings regarding better crop production under sprinkler irrigation are given in Table 3. Table 3. The benefits of the use of sprinkler irrigation for crop production. To obtain better crop response under a sprinkler system, the fertilizer must be applied with water for the highest crop productivity. The overall fertilizer use efficiency has been reported at only 30% [89], which can be improved by its application using sprinkler irrigation systems. The injection of fertilizer via sprinkler irrigation is only possible with the use of injection devices. Different injection devices and application methods have been reported according to specific operating or field conditions [41,90,91,92]. Irrigation water and fertilizer could be further saved using variable rate technology (VRT), which means specific water application on a particular portion of the field [93]. The first VRT system was introduced in Asia in 2014 [94] followed by continuous research work on modifications of VRT systems. One researcher attuned the variable spray of the sprinkler nozzle by changing the operating pressure, flow rate, and internal structure [95], while another researcher invented the variable spray mechanism of CPS using infrared thermography [96]. A GPS-based operating system was developed by a group of scientists, which can apply fertilizer at variable rates by changing the duty cycle and pivoting the operating speed [54]. In present times, VRT machines are capable of applying water and fertilizers as per the soil conditions and plant needs [97]. 3.5. Sprinkler Design for Better Microclimate and Associated Field Losses Sprinkler systems revolutionized farm irrigation methods with marvelous advantages. The efficiency of these systems is associated with the design of pumping systems, delivery pipes, and sprinkler devices according to the crops, weather, and field conditions [98]. The optimum design and selection of sprinkler components can be helpful in installing a system with economical cost and better performance for crop growing. Several techniques for designing sprinkler systems are available including graphical, analytical, and simulation techniques [99]. Bing et al. introduced the genetic algorithm (GA) technique for the design of an efficient irrigation system based on simulation research work [100]. Other researchers reported the use of binary coding genetic algorithms (BCGAs) for optimum water applications to different crops [101]; general genetic algorithms (GGAs) for irrigation scheduling, rotation, and its distribution [102]; and the use of single parent genetic algorithms (SPGAs) for space–time canal discharge distribution for irrigation rotation [103]. Liu et al. incorporated the weighting method (digital) using the MATLAB (R2013b) toolbox to analyze the distribution pattern of droplet size and identified the variation trends in distribution frequency under changing pressure at varying radial distances from sprinkler nozzles [104]. Based on the single-sprinkler installation approach, a line source sprinkler system with optimized design parameters was established using the analytical approach at Ferdowsi University [105]. These developed techniques are for the design of sprinkler systems for successful field operation with the ability to save significant amounts of irrigation water and create favorable conditions for crops by modifying field microclimate. Controlling field microclimate is an advantage that is associated with sprinkler irrigation for controlling the factors of high temperature and low humidity [106]. Hot wind drifts can cause an average of 5–10% yield loss that could be up to 20–30% under severe climate conditions. Similar results have also been reported by other researchers regarding abnormal crop growth and the reduction in final biomass [107,108]. Liu et al. conducted long-term scenario studies on sprinkler systems for winter wheat and reported a reduction in ambient crop temperature, low vapor pressure, and less transpiration [109]. The advantage of sprinkler applications also included improvement in photosynthesis and low respiration rates [110,111]. Moreover, the positive impact of water spray on the temperature of the soil’s upper layer and the canopy temperature has been proven in other research works [112]. Cai et al. conducted a study on optimizing CPS to regulate field microclimate and reported improvement in the peak splits of temperature difference and photosynthesis rate [113]. Besides these optimistic impacts, there are some undesirable losses associated with sprinkler irrigation in terms of wind drift and evaporation. A small portion of the discharging water from sprinkler nozzles in the form of thin drops does not reach the crop canopy and evaporates in the air during its transfer, which is called wind drift or evaporation losses in sprinklers [114,115,116]. The researchers’ findings provide evidence that the scale of wind drift depends on wind speed and weather conditions [117,118] and it varies from 3.6 to 7.2% [119]. Colombo et al. reported 3.38% losses of wind drift under the regular operation of CPS [120]. The variation in wind drift was examined by Playan et al. in a number of experiments (52 in 2004 and 39 in 2005) and reported the range of the magnitude of losses as 4.3–14.7 in 2004 and 0.3–8.3% in 2005 [121]. The wind drift losses in cold cum semi-arid climates were reported as 3.3–13.7% [122] and the same for Mediterranean regions as 5.8–36.4% [123]. Yazar revealed the average wind drift losses for various operating conditions and types of systems as 1.7–30.7% [124]. These losses should be controlled otherwise these can cause water and energy loss as well as a reduction in crop yield and poor quality [125], which eventually increases production costs and decreases net income. Mole reported that 30–50% of total wind drift losses are due to direct evaporation from the air and the remaining part is due to the wind drifting [126]. The wind drift losses could be minimized by optimizing the operating pressure, speed of the vehicle, and sprinkler type. It was reported that the 1-Wob sprinkler has better efficiency and causes less drift losses [127]. Sandeghai et al. developed a multiple linear regression model to predict wind drift losses for various weather conditions under varying operating conditions [116]. Using the model, the worker can set the operating conditions as per the weather situation so that the wind drift losses can be minimized. By using the guidelines developed by different researchers [128,129,130], drift losses can be controlled to improve the application efficiency of sprinkler systems. 4. Precision Irrigation Using Sprinklers Sprinkler irrigation systems can apply water and fertilizer precisely but manually operated sprinkler systems involve labor for their operation; moreover, it is difficult to apply irrigation as per the real-time crop water requirement, whereas precision irrigation is the latest water-saving technique for maximizing yield and providing water at a desired location based on actual crop water demand [15,131,132,133,134,135,136,137]. The potential of water saving with precision irrigation through sprinkler systems has been reported as 30% compared with conventional sprinkler systems [138]. The concept of precision irrigation is based on the temporal and spatial variation in the application rate of irrigation systems based on real-time crop water requirements [25,26]. The entire field or application area is tackled as small parts or zones having the same water requirement at a particular time. Then, irrigation is applied in every zone in the desired quantity using a smart application mechanism attached to an irrigation system. Precision irrigation keeps every part of the field at optimum moisture level for proper plant growth in a uniform way [139], which improves its productivity, yield quality, and water use efficiency [140]. Researchers studied water application via sprinklers using the principles of precision irrigation and reported marvelous results regarding efficient water applications [2,132,141,142,143,144,145,146]. Precision irrigation involves (1) variable applications of irrigation water in space and time, regulated by the real-time monitoring of irrigation-related parameters in the field using sensors or other tools, (2) analyzing the data to develop irrigation schedules, and (3) feedback and operating mechanisms to control the irrigation machine using GPS to fulfill actual crop water requirements in every section of the field separately. To implement a precision irrigation system, advanced sensing, analyzing (simulating), and control technologies are adopted to achieve its best performance. This understanding of precision irrigation is also expressed as variable rate irrigation. Typical precision irrigation has been drawn by getting inspiration from the literature [147] and is shown in Figure 7. A precision system includes a mechanism for field data collection, data transformation to the control center/device, data analysis, and calibrated operation of IoT-based automatic solenoid valves to operate the irrigation system. Under precision applications, irrigation is applied frequently for short durations just to maintain the field water balance of a cropping system at every part of the field. Prior to the application of precision irrigation, the actual water requirement is calculated, and the operating time or intensities are designed for the onward operation of sprinkler vehicles. These calculations are referred to as irrigation scheduling. Figure 7. Overview of typical precision irrigation mechanism: (a) sensors for data collection from the field; (b) data transformation mechanism and transmitters; (c) data receiver and data analyzer for data calibration and to generate a command for the irrigation system; (d) remotely operated solenoid valves to operate the irrigation system as per commands generated by the data analyzer; and (e) the sprinkler irrigation system. 4.1. Field Parameters Used for Irrigation Scheduling for Precision Irrigation The monitoring of field conditions is crucial for implementing precision irrigation for food production with minimum water usage. Monitoring of field conditions refers to the data collection regarding irrigation-related parameters that are capable of stating the real-time water balance of the crop system so that the desired water can be applied. Some basic parameters that are related to irrigation scheduling are categorized [17,148] into three classes or groups. Any of these parameters or the sum of some parameters could be adopted to determine irrigation scheduling under precision irrigation. The first group is associated with soil parameters including soil moisture, soil salinity, soil water absorption capacity, soil pH, etc. The second group is associated with plant parameters including leaf area index (LAI), normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), stomatal conductance, evapotranspiration, leaf turgor pressure, crop water stress index, etc. Plant-related parameters for irrigation scheduling are relatively difficult to monitor but these parameters exhibit the most realistic picture of plant water balance and present the plant growth expected to be affected by droughts and nutrient deficiencies [149]. The third group contained climatic parameters including ambient temperature, humidity, wind speed, solar radiation, precipitation, atmospheric pressure, etc. These climatic parameters are put in the world-renowned “Penman–Monteith evapotranspiration model” for calculating actual evapotranspiration using crop coefficients for the development of irrigation schedules [150]. A summary of the literature review regarding the use of different parameters for precision irrigation has been taken from the literature [32] and illustrated in Figure 8 after modifications and improvements. The parameters are shown as per previously defined groups (crop parameters, soil parameters, and climatic parameters). Figure 8. Illustration of the literature showing the domains of monitoring parameters for precision irrigation. A: [151]; B: [152]; C: [153]; D: [154]; E: [155]; F: [156]; G: [150]; H: [157]; I: [149]; J: [158]; K: [159]; L: [160]; M: [161]; N: [162]; O: [163]; P: [164]; Q: [165]; R: [166]; S: [167]; T: [168]; U: [169]; V: [170]; W: [143]; X: [171]; Y: [172]; Z: [173]; Aa: [174]; and Bb: [141]. 4.2. Data Collection Regarding Irrigation Scheduling for Precision Irrigation Precision irrigation requires the accurate measurement of field data related to the above-described parameters to implement its full scope in order to obtain maximum advantages. There are several ways to collect field data including the following: Manual monitoring using smart tools; Use of sensors (sensors for soil, plant, and climate parameters); Use of satellite data; Use of UAV for data collection. 4.2.1. Manual Monitoring Using Smart Tools The accuracy of monitoring field parameters is crucial to implementing precision irrigation in a true sense. The continuous and uninterrupted monitoring of irrigation-related parameters at different points at desired intervals can be conducted manually using smart sensing tools or devices. The biases in data collection by humans have been reported but the data regarding some specific plant or soil-related parameters could still be collected manually by following standard protocols [175]. This method of data collection is convenient and easy to follow but it is very low in efficiency. 4.2.2. Use of Sensors Plant growth is highly dependent on the moisture level in the rhizosphere and frequent monitoring of moisture levels needs to be carried out for accurate irrigation scheduling. Accurate data collection regarding soil moisture on high temporal grounds is the only option for irrigation scheduling in a precise way [169,172,176]. Different kinds of sensors are available in the market and are being used for such purposes. One type is capacitance-based sensors, which are relatively low cost and can measure the moisture level with adequate reliability after efficacious calibration of the sensor with measured field data [177]. A more sophisticated device to monitor soil moisture is TDR (time domain reflectometry), which contains two electrodes. These electrodes are inserted in the soil column up to the desired depth and, afterward, an electric signal is generated from one electrode to another to assess the soil moisture by estimating travel time and soil conductance characteristics. The accuracy of TDR is high, but it is expensive to install in large numbers in open fields for monitoring soil moisture at different field spots. Bitella introduced the methodology to measure soil moisture at different depths at the same time using low-cost dielectric probes [131] while other researchers used IoT-based field monitoring devices for moisture measurements [162]. Huuskonen and Oksanen used drone cameras for remote measurement of soil moisture in upper soil layers [160]. Besides soil parameters, the use of climate parameters for irrigation scheduling has the highest ranking due to their extensive use among all contenders [143,149,162,166,178,179,180]. Permanent weather stations or weather monitoring devices can be installed in the field to collect real-time climate data. The sensors to monitor plant or soil-related parameters can be installed on the moveable platform of an irrigation system like CPS for real-time monitoring during the irrigation cycle [181]. In addition to the moisture, soil and plant nutrients could also be monitored using soil nutrient detectors connected parallel to moisture sensors [182]. Joly developed a silicon chip for site-specific monitoring of soil nutrients [183]. 4.2.3. Application of Remote Sensing for Data Collection Satellite remote sensing is an excellent and reliable option to collect data on soil and plant-related parameters for irrigation under various environmental conditions throughout the world. The satellites can read ground data using different spectral bands and are capable of differentiating water-stressed crop areas and analyzing crop water needs at high spatial and temporal frequencies [184]. Many commercial satellites like MODIS, Landsat, SPOT, etc., offer crop and soil moisture status at high temporal frequency [185]. Several researchers used open-source satellite data related to crop evapotranspiration, soil moisture, plant water stress, NDVI, etc., for the implementation of precision irrigation using sprinkler irrigation systems [186,187]. Reyes [188] used a satellite-based vegetation index to estimate actual crop water requirements for the design of irrigation scheduling for precise water applications in the field. Ramirez [189] used a GIS-based toolbox to explore satellite data for the assessment of soil moisture to determine crop water requirements. The 10–20% more water saving achieved by using integrated precision cum pressurized irrigation systems has been reported by many researchers who used satellite data for irrigation scheduling of various crops grown under varying field conditions [190,191]. 4.2.4. Use of UAV for Data Collection UAVs (unmanned aerial vehicles) or “drones” are aircraft with no human pilots. The size of a UAV varies from small to large, depending upon the function that it can perform. UAVs are quick, affordable, and reliable alternatives to satellite data if the application area is small (local scale). Depending on the sensors carried by a UAV, various crop- and soil-based parameters for irrigation scheduling could be collected and monitored in real time at high spatial frequency. Various researchers used UAVs for the determination of crop water requirements [192], soil moisture [193], and plant water stress [194] for the implementation of precision irrigation, and satisfactory results were reported. 4.3. Techniques for Data Analysis and Management of Sprinkler Systems for Precision Irrigation The collected data were analyzed using several sophisticated techniques including modeling tools and multidimensional simulating software (DSSAT(v4.6), MATLAB(R2011b), APSIM (7.1), R(2.4.1.2) etc.) to predict spatially and temporally varied crop water requirements for developing irrigation maps for onward applications of precision irrigation. Mechanized techniques are essential in precision irrigation to manage sprinkler systems for efficient water applications using developed irrigation maps with less energy input and higher crop yield. The mechanized techniques belong to two big categories called open loop technique (OLT) and closed loop technique (CLT). In OLT, irrigation is controlled by a pre-set program designed for a particular field using input data regarding irrigation parameters [195]. The OLT is easier to follow and cheaper in cost; therefore, farmers prefer to adopt these techniques for implementing precision irrigation [196]. Farmers can set operating conditions (pre-timers, speed, and application rate) for any sprinkler system, which can be monitored during the entire operation of the irrigation machine. Many researchers reported the use of OLT by farmers for precision irrigation in their fields [197,198,199]. The CLT is relatively difficult to implement but is more accurately related to the true spirit of precision irrigation using sprinkler irrigation systems with 20–30% more efficiency [200,201,202]. Progressive farmers use such techniques at their farms. Many studies have been conducted on the applications, adoptability, and benefits of CLT techniques, and significantly positive responses to these techniques for crop production were reported [203,204]. The controlling mechanism of CLT includes a feedback input mechanism that continuously feeds the field conditions—retrieved from the sensors—to the input controller; then, the operation of irrigation machines is conducted in accordance with this information. The information may relate to climate, soil, or crop parameters [205,206]. Initially, a bigger irrigation program of variable nature is formulated that is implemented accordingly after retrieving information from the sensors at small time intervals [207,208]. However, continuous dynamics in field conditions make the control of irrigation extremely cumbersome under CLT. Also, due to the installation of sensors on irrigation machines and in soil profiles, the capital cost exceeds even unaffordable limits. Also, the use of sensors could mislead operators if they are not calibrated properly, which results in immense implementation struggles for farmers. The simplest illustration of precision irrigation using a center pivot sprinkler system under both controlling mechanisms (OLT and CLT) is shown in Figure 9. Figure 9. Block diagram of (a) open loop technique (OLT) and (b) closed loop technique (CLT) under precision irrigation. 4.4. Use of Controlling Devices for Precision Applications of Sprinkler Irrigation To perform water application using a sprinkler system according to real-time irrigation scheduling, mechanized systems are used to continuously control the operation of the irrigation system to adopt the true spirit of precision irrigation. The operation of the irrigation system is controlled to maintain the desired irrigation level by controlling the application rate or irrigation time [175]. To achieve this, electronic devices called “controllers” have been developed and are available in markets. The selection of controllers is made keeping in view their function, reliability, availability, price, etc. One type of controller is the PID (proportional-integrated derivative) controller. These controllers are widely used due to their simple structure, ease of troubleshooting, and minimum errors but these cannot handle external disturbance and can thus create errors [209]. The second type of controller is an AI (intelligent control for precision irrigation) controller. These controllers use the application of artificial intelligence, which makes these devices capable of providing solutions in a smarter way [210]. These devices with briskly developed algorithms can emulate the process of human decision making; therefore, these devices have been implemented specifically in sprinkler irrigation machines for precise water applications [211,212] in different forms like fuzzy logic, etc. [213]. On the other hand, these kinds of controllers have complex structures, are higher in price, and are difficult to troubleshoot. The third type of controller is the MPC (model predictive-based irrigation) controller, which is widely used in agriculture and other industries [214,215,216,217,218]. By installing MPC controllers instead of classical controllers on sprinkler irrigation machines, many benefits including good efficiency, excellent performance, and optimality can be achieved toward the true spirit of precision [219]. Future research on the development of smart MPC controllers can improve the efficiency of precision irrigation using sprinkler systems in a convenient way with 20–30% more efficiency. 4.5. Use of Precision Irrigation for Crop Production Precision irrigation has proved its impact in the field of irrigated agronomy. Many researchers worked on the qualitative and quantitative behavior of crops against precision irrigation. Abioye [159] used an MPC controller in sprinkler irrigation for precision applications and reported 30% water saving. The IoT-based precision irrigation system was used for water saving in tomato production and reported 10% water saving with 71% better uniformity and 27.5% higher yield [220]. Chen [221] recommended the fuzzy neural network with a genetic algorithm (GA) to accomplish precision irrigation for 15–25 better yield and 25% water saving. The same technique was used by Guha [222] to calculate precise amounts of water with reference to greenhouse effects for a significant impact on crop productivity. Perea [223] used a combination of ANN and genetic algorithm (GA) for the prediction of evapotranspiration and crop response under water applications and reported 3–11% better results in terms of system efficiency for crop productivity. Ahmad [224] compared several studies on precision irrigation coupled with sprinkler irrigation and concluded that these technologies have a very positive influence on crop production and in the field of irrigated agronomy. 5. Conclusions and Future Perspectives This study consulted the major advances in sprinkler systems toward precision applications to save irrigation water and provide an increase in net crop production, maximum irrigation uniformity, and better fertilizer management with minimum leaching losses. A number of research articles from the literature were reviewed as per the designed methodology followed by the application of comprehensive inclusion/exclusion criteria to exclude unnecessary literature from the search results. Regarding the technological aspects of the analyzed works, it became evident that sprinkler systems are an efficient source to not only irrigate crops but also for fertilizer applications in the field with >35% efficiency and >14.1 productivity. This study also revealed the fact that the design of sprinkler irrigation needs to be optimized to avoid associated wind drift losses that are up to 14% of the total application efficiency. Moreover, this study covered prominent features of precision irrigation coupled with sprinkler irrigation technology. The data regarding precision irrigation revealed a dramatic improvement in productivity when automation and sensor-based monitoring were coupled with a control communication and information system to operate the sprinkler system to enhance the yield by 27.5% and save 30% more irrigation water. It is obvious that the cumulative literature and consolidation of results in one place will provide opportunities for students and researchers to develop new ideas for further interventions in the field of precision irrigation and improvements in the design of existing sprinkler systems. Future research should be continued on the smart design and evaluation of sprinkler nozzles with environmental impact assessments and simplified application mechanisms for precision irrigation systems. Research work on these lines will further support the adoption of modern irrigation techniques in large cultivable areas.

In this study, surface soil samples were collected from the overlying soil of coal gangue and the surrounding areas of the Panyi coal mine in Huainan. The concentrations of Cd, Zn, Cu, Ni, and Pb elements were determined. A self-organizing map (SOM) and an absolute principal component score multiple linear regression (APCS-MLR) receptor model were employed for the quantitative analysis of the soil’s heavy metal pollution sources and contributions. Additionally, this study focused on the analysis of the pathways of the relatively serious pollution of Cd. The results revealed that the average concentrations of heavy metals (Cd, Pb, Zn, Cu, Cr, and Ni) in the study area were 4.55, 0.59, 1.54, 0.69, 0.59, and 0.71 times the local soil background values, respectively. The concentrations of Cd and Zn exceeded the risk screening values at some sampling points, with exceedance rates of 44% and 8%, respectively, indicating a relatively serious Cd contamination. The sources of heavy metals in the soil in the study area were classified into four categories: mining activities, agricultural activities, weathering of natural matrices, and other unknown sources, with average contributions of 55.48 percent, 24.44 percent, 8.91 percent and 11.86 percent, respectively. Based on the spatial distribution of Cd, it was inferred that atmospheric deposition is one of the important pollution pathways of Cd in the study area. Cd profile distribution patterns and a surface water pollution survey showed that the farmland areas were affected by the irrigation water pathway to some extent. The vertical distribution of heavy metal content in the forest area showed a strong disorder, which was related to the absorption function of plant roots. The results of this study can help to improve the environmental management of heavy metal pollution so as to protect the ecological environment and human health. Keywords: coal mining area; heavy metals; APCS-MLR; source apportionment; pollution pathways 1. Introduction The extraction of coal resources, while promoting local economic development, also gives rise to a range of environmental pollution issues [1,2,3]. By-products generated from coal mining, such as coal gangue, contain significant accumulations of heavy metals (HMs) that, under the influence of rainfall and leaching, are continuously released into the surrounding water bodies, atmosphere, and soil environments [4,5]. Due to the non-biodegradable and persistent nature of heavy metals, this pollution persists even after the cessation of the pollution source [6,7]. HMs in the soil can pose threats to human health through the food chain or other pathways, affecting the normal functioning of human organs and potentially leading to cancer [8,9,10,11,12,13]. Human activities such as coal mining, metal smelting, and agricultural fertilization contribute significantly to the introduction of HMs into surrounding environmental media through various pollution pathways, triggering a series of biogeochemical processes in the environment. A comprehensive understanding of the sources and pathways of HMs is crucial for achieving refined environmental management of heavy metal pollution, ultimately safeguarding both ecological environments and human health. The sources of heavy metals in soil can be classified into two categories: the weathering of bedrock processes and anthropogenic inputs [14]. Methods such as correlation analysis and geostatistics are commonly used to assist in identifying types and quantities of pollution sources but cannot provide the contribution rates of pollution sources to HMs [15]. With the improvement in sample pre-treatment methods and the advancement of mass spectrometry analysis techniques, stable isotope methods have offered a new perspective for the quantitative analysis of heavy metal sources [16,17,18]. However, as an emerging technology in source apportionment, stable isotope methods still have limitations, such as interference in source apportionment results caused by isotope fractionation during heavy metal migration and transformation processes, and there is a need for a more comprehensive metal isotope source fingerprint [19]. Receptor models can calculate the quantity and contribution rate of pollution sources, and among them, the APCS-MLR method is widely used in current research on heavy metal source apportionment, including positive matrix factorization (PMF), unmixing (UNMIX), and APCS-MLR [20,21]. APCS-MLR has the advantage of overcoming the shortcomings of factor analysis in the case of unknown sources, but it lacks accuracy in interpreting model results [22]. Therefore, to address the limitations of receptor models, researchers often introduce other technical methods to achieve an accurate analysis of heavy metal pollution sources. In recent years, some machine learning methods such as SOM, random forest (RF), and conditional inference trees (CIT) have garnered scholars’ attention in the field of source apportionment of soil heavy metal pollution. SOM is a widely used self-organizing neural network method and an unsupervised learning algorithm that can use clustering functions to classify and identify heavy metal sources in soil [23]. SOM can effectively mine data features and correlations, showing strong applicability in pattern classification and element identification. The joint application of APCS-MLR and SOM helps enhance the accuracy of source apportionment for heavy metal pollution in soil. Clearly defining the pollution pathways of soil HMs from the source to the endpoint contributes to a better understanding of the spatial distribution evolution of soil HMs. However, knowledge of this intermediate process is currently lacking. Analyzing changes in soil profiles in terms of heavy metal content is an effective method for pollution pathway analysis. Some studies have inferred atmospheric deposition surface source pollution and Cd inputs such as irrigation water in farmland in the study area by comparing the vertical distribution differences in HMs in soil profiles under different land use types [24]. Huainan City is an important coal mining and production base in East China. Due to intensive coal mining and processing activities, coupled with agricultural development, heavy metal pollution in soil has gradually increased. Additionally, coal mining can lead to varying degrees of land subsidence, forming extensive subsidence water areas. Due to the region’s high groundwater level, well-developed surrounding water systems, and large coal mining volume, the subsidence area in the mining district has reached 300 km² [25]. The Panyi coal mine, located in the northern part of Huainan City, is one of the first fifteen modern model mines designated in the national coal system. The mining activities in this area have caused significant damage to the local ecological environment. A previous study investigated the soil quality of a number of mining areas, including the Panyi coal mine, and found heavy metal contamination [26]. Therefore, it is crucial to investigate the heavy metal pollution status and sources in the Panyi coal mine area. The primary objective of this study is to determine the sources of soil HMs and their pollution contribution rates. The specific aims are (i) to determine the concentrations of HMs in the soil of the study area; (ii) to quantitatively analyze the sources of soil HMs; and (iii) to clarify the pathways of heavy metal pollution in the study area. The results of this study will elucidate the characteristics of heavy metal element pollution in the soil of coal mining areas, quantitatively analyze the sources of heavy metal pollution of soil, and analyze the pathways of heavy metal pollution. This information will provide theoretical support for government agencies in the prevention and control of heavy metal pollution in soil. 2. Materials and Methods 2.1. Overview of the Study Area The Pan Ji (116°21′–117°11′ E, 32°32′–33°06′ N) is situated in the middle reaches of the Huai River, in the northern part of Huainan City, covering a total area of 590 square kilometers. The district falls within the subtropical monsoon climate zone, characterized by long winters and summers, short springs and autumns, and four distinct seasons. The annual average temperature is 15.1 °C, with an average annual precipitation of 905.6 mm and an average frost-free period of 215.5 days. Geographically, the area is located at the southern end of the Huang-Huai Plain, with a terrain that slopes gently from northwest to southeast, with a gradient of one in five thousand and elevations ranging from 18 to 22 m above sea level. The district has a subsidence area of approximately 3235 hectares formed by coal mining-induced subsidence. Pan Ji is a major coal and electricity hub with seven large coal mines and the Anhui (Huainan) Modern Coal Chemical Industry Park. The water surface area in the subsidence zone formed by coal mining-induced subsidence is approximately 3235 hectares, constituting 12.5% of the total area. The district’s water area covers 67.65 km².The predominant soil type in Pan Ji District is yellow-brown soil, and the vegetation is characterized by temperate deciduous broadleaf forests, with mainly artificial forests. The cultivated land area in Pan Ji District is approximately 450,000 mu, primarily used for the cultivation of crops such as wheat, rice, legumes, oilseeds, and vegetables. The coal industry holds a significant share in the industrial composition, with production having maintained stable growth in recent years. 2.2. Sample Collection and Processing Based on the preliminary investigation of the basic geographical conditions of the study area and the actual conditions on-site, a sampling plan was determined. Soil sample collection was conducted, taking into consideration different land use functional zones, including farmland, forest land, and coal gangue accumulation areas. The sampling points in the study area were determined using a combination of grid point and zoning point methods, considering the size and shape of functional zones. The sampling work was completed in June 2023, with the collection of a total of 50 surface soil samples (0–20 cm), including 15 samples from the surfaces of coal gangue accumulations. The five-point sampling method was employed, and excess samples were removed using the quartering method after thorough mixing. Due to the influence of topography, the spatial distribution of HMs in the coal gangue accumulation area showed significant variation. Therefore, two layers (upper and lower) were collected in the coal gangue accumulation area based on topographic conditions. In addition, profile samples were collected in three land use types: farmland, forested areas around coal gangue mountains, and surfaces of coal gangue accumulations. The profiles were sampled at five depths: 0–20, 20–40, 40–60, 60–80, and 80–100 cm. Simultaneously, to analyze pollution pathways, water and sediment samples were collected from the surrounding subsidence zone. Surface water and sediment sampling points were positioned at the same horizontal level as much as possible, with four points collected along the direction of water flow. The collected soil and sediment samples were stored in polyethylene plastic bags, while surface water samples were poured into 500 mL polyethylene plastic bottles and adjusted to a pH below 2 by adding concentrated nitric acid. GPS coordinates were recorded using GPS to indicate the latitude and longitude of each sampling point. The locations of the sampling points are shown in Figure 1. Figure 1. Map of sampling sites. Surface water samples were filtered through a 0.45 μm membrane before being prepared for machine testing. Soil and sediment samples, after natural drying, were processed by removing plant residues, stones, bricks, and other debris using forceps. After grinding, the samples were passed through a 100-mesh nylon sieve and stored in polyethylene self-sealing bags at low temperatures for later use. The soil and sediment samples were digested using an HNO3–HCl–HF–HClO4 digestion system, and the contents of Cd, Zn, Cu, Cr, Ni, and Pb elements in the samples were determined using inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS, Agilent 7500cx; Santa Clara, CA, USA). During the testing process, to ensure data accuracy and minimize the impact of sensitivity drift, every 10 samples were tested along with an additional measurement of a known concentration of standard solution (QC) for external standard correction. The National Soil Reference Material (GSS-3a) was used for quality control, with parallel samples conducted every 5 samples to control errors within around 5%. 2.3. SOM SOM is an unsupervised neural network based on competitive learning, proposed by Kohonen in 1982. It can obtain clustering by seeking the optimal set of reference vectors according to the topological relationships in original data. The key distinctions between SOM and traditional clustering methods lie in the fact that SOM attempts to find nodes in the sample space that represent the features of the data, thus forming a multidimensional distribution function describing the entire dataset. Unlike traditional clustering methods, SOM does not make assumptions about the data, and the results obtained are not dependent on the distribution or statistical model of the data. These advantages, combined with its simple computational process, robust fault tolerance, and memory association, enable SOM to be successfully applied to complex data analysis. In this study, SOM was used to identify patterns of soil HMs. The number of neurons in the output layer was selected according to the following formula: 𝑚=5× 𝑛 − − √ (1) In the above formula, m represents the number of SOM nodes and n represents the number of input data. In this study, a neural structure consisting of 6 rows and 6 columns was chosen for the SOM experiments. 2.4. APCS-MLR In recent years, many scholars have utilized a method that combines the development of APCS based on principal component analysis (PCA) with MLR, known as APCS-MLR, to achieve pollution source apportionment. The APCS-MLR model uses PCA to obtain APCS, which was then used as the independent variable in a multiple linear regression analysis with heavy metal element content as the dependent variable. This analysis yielded the contribution rates of different pollution sources. The formula for the APCS-MLR is the following: 𝐶 𝑖 = ∑ 𝑛 𝑚=1 ( 𝑎 𝑖𝑚 ×𝐴𝑃𝐶 𝑆 𝑖𝑚 )+ 𝑏 𝑖 (2) In the formula above, Ci represents the measured content of the i-th heavy metal; bi is the constant term in the multiple regression; “aim” is the regression coefficient of pollution source m for the i-th heavy metal; APCSim is the absolute principal component score of the pollution source m for the i-th heavy metal; and n is the number of factors.

𝑃 𝐶 𝑖𝑚 = | 𝑏 𝑖 | | 𝑏 𝑖 |+ ∑ 𝑛 𝑚=1 | 𝑎 𝑖𝑚 × 𝐴𝑃𝐶 𝑆 𝑖𝑚                                                   | (4) In the formula, PCim represents the contribution rate of unidentified sources (unknown sources) to the heavy metal element i. 3. Results and Discussion 3.1. Soil Heavy Metal Content Characteristics The descriptive statistical results of the heavy metal content in the surface soil of the study area are presented in Table 1. The average order of heavy metal content in the soil was Zn (124.52 mg∙kg −1) > Cr (38.15 mg∙kg −1) > Ni (18.26 mg∙kg −1) > Pb (18.02 mg∙kg −1) > Cu (16.72 mg∙kg −1) > Cd (0.277 mg∙kg −1). Compared to the local soil background values, the average contents of Cd, Pb, Zn, Cu, Cr, and Ni were approximately 4.55, 0.59, 1.54, 0.69, 0.59, and 0.71 times higher, respectively, indicating a certain level of accumulation of Cd and Zn in the study area. In comparison to the “National Soil Environmental Quality Standards” (GB15618-2018) [27], 22 samples (44%) exceeded the risk screening value for Cd and four samples (8%) exceeded the corresponding value for Zn. Table 1. Descriptive statistics of heavy metal content in the study area. The coefficient of variation (CV, % = standard deviation/mean) can indicate the degree of dispersion among data as a measure of the influence of human activities. The CV of Zn (75.79%) was the highest, that of Cr (31.3%) was the lowest, and those of the other HMs, Cu, Pb, Cd, and Ni, were 37.2%, 35.3%, 35.1%, and 31.8%, respectively. It is generally recognized that a CV ≤ 16% is considered as weak variation, 16% < CV < 36% is considered as moderate variation, and a CV ≥ 36% is considered as strong variation [28]. The higher the CV, the higher the degree of influence by anthropogenic activities. The HMs Zn and Cu in the study area belonged to strong variability, which was influenced by anthropogenic factors; the other HMs belonged to medium variability, which might have been influenced by both natural and anthropogenic factors [29]. 3.2. Soil Heavy Metal Classification and Distribution Based on SOM The component plane output of SOM analysis is shown in Figure 2. Each SOM matrix consisted of the component values of 36 neurons, and the SOM plane used a color gradient to indicate the importance of the variables transmitted by each neuron. In the component plane, similar colors indicate positive correlations between variables, while different colors indicate negative correlations. By comparing the color gradients of the SOM, it is possible to visualize the qualitatively weighted relational information between nodes and to classify the SHM into three interpretable groups. As shown in Figure 2, certain similar patterns can be distinguished. For example, chromium and nickel show similar color gradients and their distribution patterns show the highest concentrations in the lower right, indicating a strong positive correlation between these two elements. In contrast to the distributions of the other HMs, zinc shows a marked difference in its topological distribution pattern, with relatively low zinc values over most of the map, except for one high neuron in the lower right, suggesting a different mechanism influencing changes in zinc concentration. Cd is highly concentrated in the right half of the map, similar to the compositional planar distributions of copper and lead, suggesting that these HMs share the same mechanism of concentration change. The spatial distributions of chromium and nickel are extremely similar and they are strongly correlated. Figure 2. SOM map of heavy metal content of soil. 3.3. Source Analysis of HMs 3.3.1. Principal Component Analysis The data on HMs in the soil were standardized, and KMO and Bartlett’s sphericity tests were conducted. The KMO measure of 0.713 and Bartlett’s test of sphericity p < 0.05 indicated that the data were suitable for PCA. The number of principal components extracted is generally determined by eigenvalues greater than 1. However, the results of the principal component analysis showed that only one component had an eigenvalue greater than 1 and the variance contribution of that component was less than 60%. Three principal components were extracted because the SOM plot produced three sample clusters and the principal component analysis results showed that the cumulative variance contribution of the first three principal components was more than 85%. The eigenvalues of these three principal factors were 3.555, 0.923, and 0.752, with a cumulative variance contribution rate of 87.153%, explaining most of the information for the six HMs (Table 2). Table 2. Principal component analysis matrix of soil HMs in the study area. The first principal component analysis (PCA1) explained 59.24% of the variance, much higher than the other components. Ni, Cr, Cu, and Pb had high positive loadings on PCA1, with values of 0.931, 0.932, 0.834, and 0.656, respectively. The average values of Cr, Ni, Cu, and Pb in the study area were lower than the local background values, and the coefficients of variation for Cr, Ni, Cu, and Pb were low, indicating that they were less affected by human activities. The SOM analysis results showed a similar color gradient between Cr and Ni, indicating a strong correlation between these two elements. Previous studies have suggested that Cr and Ni in the soil are mainly controlled by natural sources [30,31]. In addition, weathering of soil-forming parent rocks has been reported as a source of Pb and Cu in soils [32,33]. Therefore, the PCA1 can be interpreted as representing a natural parent material source for soil formation. The second principal component analysis (PCA2) explained 15.38% of the variance, with Cd having the highest loading of 0.943, while the other HMs had weaker loadings. The SOM analysis results indicated that Cd exhibited a significantly different color gradient than other HMs, suggesting different mechanisms influencing Cd concentration changes. The average Cd concentration exceeded the background value in the study area, with some sampling points surpassing the risk screening values for agricultural land, indicating that Cd is likely influenced by human activities. Given that the study area is a coal mining region, long-term coal mining activities have led to a substantial input of Cd into the surrounding soil [34]. Additionally, waste generated from coal mining contains high concentrations of Cd and Pb, and these HMs accumulate in the waste, migrating to the surrounding soil through weathering and rainfall percolation. Previous studies have indicated that the accumulation of coal gangue is a primary cause of elevated Cd levels in surrounding soil, and it contributes to the accumulation of Pb and other HMs [35]. Therefore, PCA2 can be inferred as representing a pollution source related to mining activities. The third principal component analysis (PCA3) explains 12.53% of the variance, with Zn having the highest loading of 0.968, while the other HMs had weaker loadings. The SOM output plane shows that most values of Zn on the map are low, except for a high-value point in the lower right corner, indicating that the source of Zn in the soil is different from other HMs. The Zn content of HMs in the soil samples in the study area exceeded the local background values, and a few points exceeded the risk screening values. Additionally, the coefficient of variation for Zn exceeded 70%, higher than other HMs. Therefore, the PCA3 can be considered as a source related to human activities. In the central and northern parts of the study area, where there are numerous farmlands, agricultural activities are intense. Studies have shown that pesticides and fertilizers contain certain amounts of Zn, and their long-term use can lead to the accumulation of Zn in the soil [36,37]. In addition, the spatial distribution map (Figure S1) of HMs shows areas of high values of Zn in the farmland area, suggesting that the accumulation of Zn may have been influenced by agricultural activities. Thus, the PCA3 can be interpreted as a source of pollution from agricultural activities. 3.3.2. APCS-MLR Source Analysis Quantitative calculation of pollution source contributions using the APCS-MLR receptor model revealed R2 values of 0.906, 0.997, 0.804, 0.916, 0.894, and 0.662 for Cd, Zn, Cu, Cr, Ni, and Pb, respectively. Except for Pb, all other HMs had R2 values greater than 0.8, and the ratios of predicted to actual concentrations for each heavy metal were close to 1 (Table S1), indicating a high accuracy in the source analysis results. The contributions of each factor to the heavy metal elements are shown in Figure 3, including contributions from three pollution sources determined by PCA and one unknown pollution source. The contribution rates for PCA1, PCA2, PCA3, and the unknown source were 55.48%, 24.44%, 8.91%, and 11.86%, respectively. Figure 3. APCS-MLR pollution source contribution rates. The soil HMs Cu, Cr, Pb, and Ni in the study area were primarily influenced by natural factors, with contribution rates of 73.67%, 72.60%, 57.55%, and 73.59%, respectively. Additionally, the PCA1 explained the sources of some Zn and Cd in the study area. Studies have indicated that weathering of parent materials, such as carbonate rocks, can lead to the enrichment of Cd in surrounding soils [38]. Wang et al. found that natural parent materials contribute to Zn in the soils of the Huainan Luan Mining Area [39]. The PCA2, representing mining activities combined with mixed sources of coal gangue deposition, had the highest contribution rate to Cd, accounting for 68.52%. Furthermore, it contributed to the other HMs Zn, Cu, Cr, Ni, and Pb by 11.74%, 20.17%, 2.60%, 36.42%, and 7.20%, respectively. Mining activities can have various adverse effects on the surrounding environment and serve as a source of pollution for multiple HMs, including Zn, Cu, Cr, and Pb [40]. This explanation aligns well with the results of the PCA2 source contribution analysis in this study. The PCA3, representing the pollution source of agricultural activities, had a higher contribution to Zn, accounting for 37.18%. Additionally, the PCA3 had lower contributions to the other five HMs. The use of pesticides and fertilizers can lead to slight enrichment of Cd, Cu, Cr, and Ni in the soil [41,42]. Huainan Panji is one of the important power hubs, and coal-fired power generation may lead to the migration of HMs from coal to the surrounding soil. In addition, there is a provincial road in the study area with frequent traffic activities. Based on actual investigations and data collection around the study area, the unknown source might be related to coal combustion [43,44,45], automobile exhaust emissions [46,47,48], tire wear [49], and household waste (such as batteries) [50], which are potential sources of HMs according to previous studies. 3.4. Cd Pollution Pathways and Migration Characteristics Soil metal profile analysis is an effective method to study metal sources and pollution pathways. The research area is severely polluted by the heavy metal Cd, which has high biotoxicity compared to other HMs [51]. Therefore, special attention was given to the pollution pathways and migration characteristics of Cd in the research area. Figure 4A displays the variation in Cd content in three different land use areas in the research area, and its content was higher than in the local background values. The profile content variation trend of Cd was site-specific. The Cd content in the surface soil of the coal gangue mountain showed a trend of first decreasing and then increasing with the increase in profile depth. In the farmland area, the Cd content increased first and then decreased with the depth, while in the peripheral forest area of the coal gangue mountain, there was no regular change in Cd content. Compared with the depth of 20–40 cm, the surface Cd content in the coal gangue mountain and the peripheral forest areas is enriched to some extent, indicating the possible input through atmospheric deposition. After field visits, it was found that although the coal gangue accumulation area had undergone surface soil treatment, there were still exposed areas with coal gangue, and HMs could enter the soil through pathways such as atmospheric deposition [52]. A large number of gangue particles enter the surrounding soil through long-term wind action, causing heavy metal pollution [53]. It has been reported that atmospheric deposition is the main pathway for human input of HMs into the surface environment. In addition, the predicted spatial distribution of Cd (Figure 5) shows that Cd radiates from the gangue hills to the northwest (main wind direction), which well explains that atmospheric deposition is one of the pollution pathways of Cd in the study area. Figure 4. (A) Variation in Cd content in different regional profiles; (B) Cd content in surface water and sediments of the subsidence area in the research area. Figure 5. Spatial distribution prediction map of Cd content in the research area. Based on the tracing results, the contribution rate of agricultural sources to Cd input was low, the collected farmland soil samples also had higher Cd content than the local soil background values, and the spatial distribution map of heavy metal pollution shows that Cd pollution in farmland areas was more likely to be affected by non-point source pollution. Secondly, in the soil profile analysis, the Cd content in the farmland profile below 40 cm gradually decreased with the increase in depth and approached the background value. Therefore, other pollution pathways need to be considered for Cd pollution in farmland areas. The research area has developed water systems, and HMs in coal gangue can enter the surrounding water and then be input into the soil through irrigation. The irrigation water for farmland areas in the research area was mainly taken from the surrounding subsidence water bodies. The Cd content in sediments and water bodies of the main subsidence waters in the study area is shown in Figure 4B, and the Cd content in the collected surface water and sediment samples exceeded the standard according to the Environmental Quality Standard for Surface Waters (Grade III) and the background values of the reference sediments. Therefore, the Cd pollution in farmland areas may be influenced by the irrigation water pathway. This phenomenon may be related to plant root uptake due to the high tree and herb cover in forested areas [54,55]. It has been demonstrated that plants can recycle the heavy metal Cd from deeper soils to upper soils, resulting in a decrease in Cd levels at certain depths. This well explains the irregularity of the Cd profile distribution in forest soils [56]. 4. Conclusions The average concentrations of HMs Cd, Pb, Zn, Cu, Cr, and Ni in the soils of the study area were 4.55, 0.59, 1.54, 0.69, 0.59, and 0.71 times higher than the background values of the local soils, respectively. The exceedance rates of Cd and Zn were 44% and 8%, respectively, indicating serious problems of Cd and Zn pollution. The sources of HMs in the soil of the study area included pollution from mining activities, agricultural activities, natural matrix soil sources, and other sources, with average contributions of 55.48 percent, 24.44 percent, 8.91 percent, and 11.86 percent, respectively. The spatial distribution of Cd levels indicated that atmospheric deposition is one of the pollution pathways of Cd in the study area. In addition, the pattern of profile distribution of Cd and the investigation of surface water contamination showed that the farmland area was affected by irrigation water pathway to some extent. The irregular distribution of heavy metal Cd content in soil profiles in forest areas is related to the uptake effect of plant roots.

A systematic review of automated systems for real-time irrigation management

1. INTRODUCTION
The challenge of feeding a growing population with finite resources is becoming increasingly pressing. By 2050, the world population is expected to reach 9.7 billion, necessitating a 70% increase in food production (Falkenmark and Rockstrom, 2009). Irrigation plays a crucial role in enhancing crop yields and agricultural productivity to meet this growing demand. Studies have shown that irrigation can significantly increase crop water productivity, contributing to increased food production (Ali and Talukder, 2008; Playan and Mateos, 2005). However, water scarcity poses a significant challenge, with many regions facing water deficits and the need for improved water management practices (Falkenmark and Rockstrom, 2009). Optimizing irrigation schedules and doses based on crop requirements and environmental conditions is essential for maximizing yield and quality while minimizing water use (Zhang et al., 2024). The necessity of scalable water-efficient practices for increasing food demand cannot be overstated. Techniques such as regulated deficit irrigation, magnetically treated water, and the use of drought-tolerant crops like sorghum have shown promise in improving water productivity and ensuring food security (Mehmood et al., 2023; Putti et al., 2023; Hadebe et al., 2016). As the global food challenge intensifies, it is imperative to critically evaluate the current state and future potential of irrigation management systems to guide research, innovation, and implementation efforts towards fully autonomous, scalable solutions.

Despite the importance of irrigation in addressing the global food challenge, traditional irrigation management techniques, such as manual scheduling and timer-based systems, have significant limitations. These methods are often labor-intensive, inefficient, and less adaptable to changing conditions (Savin et al., 2023). Manual and timer-based scheduling can lead to high operational costs and inefficient water use (Raghavendra, Han, and Shin, 2023). The reliance on manual intervention and predetermined schedules limits their adaptability to changing environmental conditions, crop water requirements, and soil moisture levels (Kaptein et al., 2019). Sensor-based irrigation systems offer an alternative, enabling real-time adjustments based on soil water status measurements (Kaptein et al., 2019). However, the adoption of these systems in commercial settings has been limited, often requiring extensive input from researchers (Kim et al., 2014; Lea-Cox et al., 2018; Ristvey et al., 2018). The limitations of traditional irrigation management techniques highlight the need for scalable, automated solutions for greater efficiency in irrigation management. Automated systems that collect real-time data, analyze it, and make autonomous irrigation decisions can lead to improved water use efficiency and increased crop productivity (Champness et al., 2023; Wu et al., 2022). To fully understand the potential of automated systems, it is necessary to examine the automation of each part of the irrigation management pipeline and analyze the effectiveness and efficiency of integrated end-to-end solutions.

The emergence of smart irrigation management and IoT marks a significant shift from historical irrigation practices. Modern approaches rely on vast data and analysis algorithms, leveraging technologies such as remote sensing, sensor networks, weather data, and computational algorithms (Atanasov, 2023; Bellvert et al., 2023; Kumar et al., 2023). IoT plays a vital role in collecting vast amounts of data through sensors, data transmission, and tailored networks, enabling real-time monitoring and control of irrigation systems (Liakos, 2023; Zuckerman et al., 2024). These advancements in data collection and analysis have the potential to revolutionize irrigation management, allowing for more precise and efficient water use. However, challenges such as processing diverse data sources, data integration, and lack of integrated data analysis hamper the full benefit of IoT in irrigation management (Dave et al., 2023). The current fragmented approach in smart irrigation, focusing on individual components rather than the entire system, limits the potential for fully autonomous, real-time end-to-end irrigation management (Togneri et al., 2021). To address these challenges and fully realize the potential of smart irrigation management, there is a need for automating and integrating each section of the irrigation management pipeline, from sensor/weather data collection and transmission to processing, analysis, decision-making, and automated action (McKinion and Lemmon, 1985). This integration requires a thorough investigation of the role of interoperability and standardization in enabling seamless communication and compatibility between components within the automated irrigation management pipeline.

Machine learning (ML) plays a significant role in processing vast data, predicting plant stress, modeling climate effects, and optimizing irrigation in smart irrigation management systems. ML algorithms can analyze data collected from sensors and weather stations to determine optimal irrigation schedules (Vianny et al., 2022). However, the potential of ML is often constrained by manual steps, such as data interpretation, decision-making on irrigation timing and volume, and system adjustments. Automating ML integration to allow direct action from insights to irrigation execution, removing bottlenecks and achieving real-time adaptability, is crucial for fully autonomous irrigation management (Barzallo-Bertot et al., 2022). By integrating ML into automated systems, the irrigation management pipeline can become more seamless and efficient, enabling real-time decision-making and action based on data-driven insights. To achieve this level of automation and integration, it is essential to identify gaps and propose solutions for seamless integration across the automated irrigation management system, aiming to achieve fully autonomous, scalable irrigation management.

To achieve seamless integration across the automated irrigation management system, interoperability and standardization are critical. Interoperability allows different system components, such as sensors, actuators, and software, to communicate and exchange data effectively, while standardization ensures that data is represented in a consistent format (Santos et al., 2020). Standardized protocols and data formats are essential for achieving seamless integration and ensuring compatibility between components in real-time irrigation management systems (Robles et al., 2022; Hatzivasilis et al., 2018). Existing and emerging standards, such as OGC SensorThings API and ISO 11783, have applicability to real-time irrigation management systems (Hazra et al., 2021). However, challenges such as data quality, scalability, reliability, and security need to be addressed to fully realize the potential of interoperability and standardization in automated irrigation management systems (Hazra et al., 2021). Addressing these challenges is crucial for enabling the seamless integration of components within the automated irrigation management pipeline, which is essential for achieving fully autonomous, scalable irrigation management. A comprehensive evaluation of the role of interoperability and standardization in enabling the integration of components within the automated irrigation management pipeline is necessary to guide future research and implementation efforts.
The primary objective of this systematic review is to critically evaluate the current state and future potential of real-time, end-to-end automated irrigation management systems that integrate IoT and machine learning technologies for enhancing agricultural water use efficiency and crop productivity.
Specific objectives include:
•	Examining the automation of each part of the irrigation management pipeline and the seamless integration of each section in the context of irrigation scheduling and management.
•	Analyzing the effectiveness and efficiency of integrated end-to-end automated irrigation systems.

•	Identifying gaps and proposing solutions for seamless integration across the automated irrigation management system, aiming to achieve fully autonomous, scalable irrigation management.
By addressing these objectives, this systematic review aims to provide a comprehensive and critical evaluation of the current state and future potential of real-time, end-to-end automated irrigation management systems. Its intention is to guide future research, innovation, and implementation efforts to achieve fully autonomous, scalable irrigation management that can contribute to addressing the global food challenge.

3. DATA COLLECTION TO CLOUD: AUTOMATION AND REAL-TIME PROCESSING
3.1. Irrigation management data
The success of automated irrigation management systems relies heavily on the collection, transmission, and analysis of various types of data. The most applicable data types for irrigation management include soil moisture, canopy temperature, weather data, and plant physiological parameters (Farooq et al., 2019; Li et al., 2019; Olivier et al., 2021; Evett et al., 2020). These data are typically collected from a range of sources, including in-field sensors, remote sensing platforms, weather stations, and manual measurements (Li et al., 2019; Karimi et al., 2018).
Soil moisture data is arguably the most critical type of data for irrigation management, as it directly reflects the water available to plants and can be used to determine the optimal timing and amount of irrigation (Olivier et al., 2021; Intrigliolo & Castel, 2006). Soil moisture sensors, such as tensiometers, capacitance probes, and time-domain reflectometry (TDR) sensors, can provide real-time measurements of soil water content at various depths (Farooq et al., 2019). These sensors can be deployed in a network configuration to capture spatial variability in soil moisture across a field (Karimi et al., 2018).
Canopy temperature data is another valuable type of data for irrigation management, as it can be used to assess plant water stress and adjust irrigation accordingly (Evett et al., 2020). Infrared thermometers and thermal cameras can be used to measure canopy temperature, which is influenced by factors such as air temperature, humidity, wind speed, and plant water status (Li et al., 2019). When plants experience water stress, they tend to close their stomata to reduce water loss, leading to an increase in canopy temperature (Evett et al., 2020). By monitoring canopy temperature and comparing it to reference values, automated irrigation systems can detect plant water stress and trigger irrigation events to maintain optimal plant health and productivity (Li et al., 2019).
Weather data, including temperature, humidity, precipitation, wind speed, and solar radiation, are essential for predicting crop water requirements and scheduling irrigation events (Akilan & Baalamurugan, 2024). Weather stations equipped with various sensors can provide real-time measurements of these parameters, which can be used as inputs for crop water requirement models, such as the FAO-56 Penman-Monteith equation (Li et al., 2019). These models estimate crop evapotranspiration (ET) based on weather data and crop-specific coefficients, allowing for the calculation of irrigation requirements (Intrigliolo & Castel, 2006). By integrating weather data into automated irrigation systems, irrigation schedules can be dynamically adjusted based on changing environmental conditions, ensuring that crops receive the optimal amount of water at the right time (Akilan & Baalamurugan, 2024).
When collecting and utilizing these data types, several considerations must be taken into account, including the volume, frequency, format, and source of the data (Farooq et al., 2019). The volume of data generated by automated irrigation systems can be substantial, especially when high-resolution sensors are deployed at a large scale (Bastidas Pacheco et al., 2022). This necessitates the use of efficient data storage, processing, and transmission technologies to handle the data load (Farooq et al., 2019). The frequency of data collection is another important consideration, as it directly impacts the temporal resolution of the data and the ability to detect rapid changes in plant water status or environmental conditions (Bastidas Pacheco et al., 2022). Bastidas Pacheco et al. (2022) demonstrated that collecting full pulse resolution data from water meters provides more accurate estimates of event occurrence, timing, and features compared to aggregated temporal resolutions, highlighting the importance of selecting appropriate data collection frequencies to ensure the quality and usefulness of the data for irrigation management.
The format of the data is also crucial, as it determines the compatibility and interoperability of the data with various analysis tools and platforms (Farooq et al., 2019). Standardized data formats, such as JSON, XML, or CSV, can facilitate data exchange and integration between different components of the automated irrigation system (Zhang et al., 2023). The source of the data is another important consideration, as it can impact the reliability, accuracy, and spatial coverage of the data (Farooq et al., 2019). For example, in-field sensors provide highly localized measurements, while remote sensing platforms, such as satellites or drones, can provide data at larger spatial scales (Li et al., 2019). By combining data from multiple sources, automated irrigation systems can achieve a more comprehensive understanding of crop water requirements and optimize irrigation management accordingly (Farooq et al., 2019).
Data quality, accuracy, and reliability are paramount in irrigation management, as they directly impact the effectiveness of decision-making processes and the efficiency of water use (Gupta et al., 2020). Inaccurate or unreliable data can lead to suboptimal irrigation decisions, resulting in crop stress, yield losses, or wasted water resources (Ramli & Jabbar, 2022). Gupta et al. (2020) emphasized the critical importance of data security and privacy in smart farming systems, as the leakage of sensitive agricultural data can cause severe economic losses to farmers and compromise the integrity of the automated irrigation system. The authors also highlighted the need for robust authentication and secure communication protocols to prevent unauthorized access to smart farming systems and protect data in transit (Gupta et al., 2020).
Ramli and Jabbar (2022) addressed the challenges associated with implementing real-time, automated irrigation systems, including data quality, scalability, reliability, and security. They proposed solutions and best practices based on the analysis of case studies and real-world implementations, such as the use of redundant sensors, data validation techniques, and secure communication protocols (Ramli & Jabbar, 2022). The authors also emphasized the importance of regular maintenance and calibration of sensors to ensure the accuracy and reliability of the collected data (Ramli & Jabbar, 2022).
Researchers have investigated the use of data compression, aggregation, and filtering techniques to reduce bandwidth requirements and improve transmission efficiency in automated irrigation systems (Karim et al., 2023; Rady et al., 2020; Cui, 2023). Karim et al. (2023) explored the effectiveness of various data compression techniques, such as lossless and lossy compression algorithms, in reducing the size of data packets transmitted over wireless networks. The authors found that lossless compression techniques, such as Huffman coding and Lempel-Ziv-Welch (LZW), can significantly reduce data size without compromising data quality, while lossy compression techniques, such as JPEG and MP3, can further reduce data size by introducing acceptable levels of distortion (Karim et al., 2023).
Rady et al. (2020) developed a novel data compression algorithm specifically designed for irrigation data, which achieved significant compression ratios without compromising data quality. The authors demonstrated that their algorithm could reduce the amount of data transmitted over wireless networks, thereby improving the efficiency of the irrigation system and reducing costs (Rady et al., 2020). Cui (2023) investigated the use of data aggregation and filtering techniques to reduce the number of transmissions and save bandwidth in automated irrigation systems. The author proposed a data aggregation scheme that combines multiple sensor readings into a single value, such as the average soil moisture over a specified time interval, to reduce the frequency of data transmissions (Cui, 2023). Additionally, the author explored the use of data filtering techniques, such as Kalman filters and particle filters, to remove noise and outliers from sensor data, improving the accuracy and reliability of the transmitted information (Cui, 2023).
Data standardization and harmonization are crucial for facilitating seamless integration and interoperability between the various components of automated irrigation management systems (Zhang et al., 2023; Ermoliev et al., 2022). Zhang et al. (2023) developed a novel cyberinformatics technology called iCrop, which enables the in-season monitoring of crop-specific land cover across the contiguous United States. The authors highlighted the importance of data standardization and harmonization in the context of iCrop, as it allows for the efficient distribution of crop-specific land cover information based on the findable, accessible, interoperable, and reusable (FAIR) data principle (Zhang et al., 2023). By adopting standardized data formats and protocols, such as the Open Geospatial Consortium (OGC) standards, iCrop enables the seamless integration of various data sources and facilitates the interoperability of the system with other agricultural decision support tools (Zhang et al., 2023).
Ermoliev et al. (2022) proposed a linkage methodology for linking distributed sectoral/regional optimization models in a situation where private information is not available or cannot be shared by modeling teams. The authors emphasized the need for data standardization to enable decentralized cross-sectoral coordination and analysis, as it allows for the consistent representation and exchange of data between different models and stakeholders (Ermoliev et al., 2022). By adopting standardized data formats and interfaces, the proposed linkage methodology can facilitate the integration of various optimization models and support the development of comprehensive decision support systems for sustainable resource management (Ermoliev et al., 2022).
Metadata plays a vital role in providing context and enabling better data interpretation and decision-making in automated irrigation management systems (Jahanddideh-Tehrani et al., 2021). Metadata refers to the additional information that describes the characteristics, quality, and context of the primary data, such as the sensor type, calibration parameters, measurement units, and timestamp (Jahanddideh-Tehrani et al., 2021). Jahanddideh-Tehrani et al. (2021) highlighted the importance of metadata in water resources management, as it enables decision-makers to use the data to the best of its capabilities by understanding factors such as when water data was collected and what factors might have contributed to the measurements. The authors emphasized the need for standardized metadata formats and guidelines, such as the Dublin Core Metadata Initiative (DCMI) and the ISO 19115 standard, to ensure the consistency and interoperability of metadata across different water information systems (Jahanddideh-Tehrani et al., 2021).
In the context of automated irrigation management systems, metadata can provide valuable information about the data collection process, sensor performance, and environmental conditions that can aid in data interpretation and decision-making (Cota & Mamede, 2023). For example, metadata about the sensor type and calibration parameters can help assess the accuracy and reliability of the collected data, while metadata about the weather conditions and soil properties can provide context for interpreting the data and adjusting irrigation strategies accordingly (Cota & Mamede, 2023). By incorporating metadata into the data management and analysis pipeline of automated irrigation systems, decision-makers can make more informed and context-aware decisions, leading to improved water use efficiency and crop productivity (Jahanddideh-Tehrani et al., 2021).

3.2. Edge Computing and Fog Computing
Edge computing and fog computing have emerged as transformative technologies in the realm of real-time irrigation management systems, offering significant potential for improving efficiency, scalability, and reliability (Abdel Nasser et al., 2020; Tran et al., 2019). Edge computing refers to the practice of processing data near the edge of the network, close to the source of the data, while fog computing is a decentralized computing infrastructure that extends cloud computing capabilities to the network edge (Hassija et al., 2019). These technologies bring computation and analytics closer to the data source, reducing the need for data to travel to the cloud and enabling faster processing and decision-making (Hassija et al., 2019; Zhang et al., 2020).
The potential of edge computing and fog computing in real-time irrigation management is immense. Abdel Nasser et al. (2020) proposed a two-layer system for water demand prediction using automated meters and machine learning techniques, demonstrating the potential of edge computing in improving the efficiency and scalability of irrigation management. The system collects and aggregates data from distributed smart meters in the first layer, while the second layer uses LSTM neural networks to predict water demand for different regions of households. By leveraging edge computing, the system can achieve high accuracy in predicting water demand, which is essential for efficient irrigation management (Abdel Nasser et al., 2020).
Tran et al. (2019) conducted a comprehensive review of real-time, end-to-end automated irrigation management systems, highlighting the role of fog computing in addressing data transmission challenges and enabling seamless integration across the irrigation management pipeline. The authors emphasize that real-time, end-to-end automated irrigation management systems have the potential to significantly improve water efficiency, crop yields, and reduce labor costs. However, they also identify several challenges that need to be addressed, such as data quality, scalability, reliability, and security, which can be effectively tackled by implementing fog computing architectures (Tran et al., 2019).
Edge computing offers several benefits in real-time irrigation management systems, including reduced latency, real-time decision-making, and reduced reliance on cloud connectivity (Mishra, 2020; Zhang et al., 2020). By processing data closer to the source, edge computing enables faster response times and more efficient data handling (Mishra, 2020). Mishra (2020) highlights that edge computing reduces latency by processing data closer to the source, enabling real-time decision-making and lessening reliance on cloud connectivity by shifting processing to local or edge devices.
Zhang et al. (2020) explore the application of edge computing in agricultural settings, demonstrating its potential to improve the efficiency and accuracy of irrigation systems. The authors discuss how edge computing has prospects in various agricultural applications, such as pest identification, safety traceability of agricultural products, unmanned agricultural machinery, agricultural technology promotion, and intelligent management. They also emphasize that the emergence of edge computing models, such as fog computing, cloudlet, and mobile edge computing, has transformed the management and operation of farms (Zhang et al., 2020).
Fog computing plays a crucial role in distributing processing and storage across the network, enhancing the scalability and reliability of automated irrigation systems (Premkumar & Sigappi, 2022; Singh et al., 2022). Premkumar and Sigappi (2022) evaluate the current state of automated irrigation management systems and propose a hybrid machine learning approach for predicting soil moisture and managing irrigation. Their study emphasizes the potential of fog computing in distributing processing and storage across the network, improving the efficiency and scalability of irrigation systems. The proposed hybrid machine learning approach outperforms other machine learning algorithms in predicting soil moisture, demonstrating the effectiveness of fog computing in enhancing the performance of automated irrigation systems (Premkumar & Sigappi, 2022).
Singh et al. (2022) discuss the role of fog computing in distributing processing and storage across the network, enhancing scalability and reliability in agricultural management systems. The authors argue that by implementing fog computing, these systems can achieve faster data processing and response times, improving overall efficiency and effectiveness. They also highlight that fog computing can address the challenges faced by real-time data transmission in agricultural management systems, such as latency, bandwidth limitations, and data security (Singh et al., 2022).
The integration of edge and fog computing in real-time irrigation management systems is crucial for achieving fully automated, scalable, and reliable solutions. As the demand for autonomous irrigation management grows, these technologies will play a pivotal role in enabling faster decision-making, reduced latency, improved resource utilization, and seamless integration across the irrigation management pipeline (Tran et al., 2019; Zhang et al., 2020). By bringing computation and analytics closer to the data source and distributing processing and storage across the network, edge and fog computing can significantly enhance the efficiency and effectiveness of automated irrigation systems, contributing to the overall goal of addressing the global food challenge through optimized water resource management and increased agricultural productivity (Abdel Nasser et al., 2020; Premkumar & Sigappi, 2022; Singh et al., 2022).

3.3. Automation of Data Collection
The automation of data collection is a critical component in the development of real-time, end-to-end automated irrigation management systems that integrate IoT and machine learning technologies. It enables the efficient gathering of vital information about crop health, environmental conditions, and water requirements, which is essential for enhancing agricultural water use efficiency and crop productivity. Two key aspects of automated data collection are the use of advanced sensing technologies for non-invasive plant stress detection and the implementation of wireless sensor networks and energy-efficient communication protocols for large-scale, long-term data collection.
Advanced sensing technologies, such as hyperspectral imaging and thermal sensing, have emerged as powerful tools for non-invasive plant stress detection in automated irrigation management systems. These technologies provide valuable information about crop traits, enabling early and accurate detection of plant health issues (Triantafyllou et al., 2019). Triantafyllou et al. (2019) propose a comprehensive reference architecture model that incorporates advanced sensing technologies in the sensor layer for real-time plant stress detection, highlighting their importance in providing non-invasive plant stress detection. Similarly, Hossain et al. (2023) present a novel IoT-ML-Blockchain integrated framework for smart agricultural management that leverages advanced sensing technologies to optimize water use and improve crop yield, contributing to the overall goal of enhancing agricultural water use efficiency and crop productivity.
Hyperspectral imaging can capture subtle changes in plant physiology that are indicative of stress, while machine learning algorithms can be employed to extract meaningful patterns from the spectral data and classify different stress types (Araus et al., 2014). Thermal sensing can detect changes in canopy temperature, which is influenced by factors such as plant water status (Li et al., 2019). By monitoring canopy temperature and comparing it to reference values, automated irrigation systems can detect plant water stress and trigger irrigation events to maintain optimal plant health and productivity (Li et al., 2019).
The integration of advanced sensing technologies in automated irrigation management systems has the potential to revolutionize precision agriculture. Jiang et al. (2019) demonstrate the effectiveness of a deep learning-based model in accurately detecting leaf spot diseases, highlighting the importance of image augmentation and deep learning algorithms in enhancing the model's performance.
Wireless sensor networks (WSNs) and energy-efficient communication protocols have the potential to significantly improve the efficiency and reliability of data collection in large-scale, long-term irrigation systems. WSNs offer a cost-effective and scalable solution for real-time data collection in large-scale irrigation systems, providing remote monitoring and automated control capabilities (Mehdizadeh et al., 2020). Nishiura and Yamamoto (2021) propose a novel sensor network system that utilizes drones and wireless power transfer to autonomously collect environmental data from sensor nodes in vast agricultural fields, reducing operational costs and enhancing the efficiency of data collection. Similarly, Higashiura and Yamamoto (2021) introduce a network system that employs UAVs and LoRa communication to efficiently collect environmental data from sensor nodes distributed across large farmlands, optimizing data collection and reducing travel distance and time.
Energy-efficient communication protocols are crucial for ensuring reliable data transmission in challenging environmental conditions and extending the lifespan of sensor nodes (Mehdizadeh et al., 2020). Al-Ali et al. (2023) investigate the potential of WSNs and energy-efficient communication protocols for data collection in large-scale, long-term irrigation systems, discussing the challenges and opportunities of using these technologies to improve the efficiency and reliability of real-time data collection in irrigation management. Mehdizadeh et al. (2020) emphasize the need for careful consideration of factors such as data accuracy, energy consumption, and network reliability when designing effective WSNs for irrigation management, enabling timely irrigation decisions and improved crop yields.
The automation of data collection through the use of advanced sensing technologies and wireless sensor networks is essential for achieving fully autonomous, scalable irrigation management. By enabling non-invasive plant stress detection and large-scale, long-term data collection, these technologies contribute to the overall goal of optimizing water resource management and increasing agricultural productivity. The integration of these technologies in real-time, end-to-end automated irrigation management systems has the potential to enhance agricultural water use efficiency and crop productivity, ultimately contributing to the development of fully autonomous, scalable irrigation management solutions.

3.4: Real-Time Data Transmission Protocols and Technologies
Real-time data transmission is a critical component of automated irrigation management systems, as it enables the timely delivery of sensor data to the cloud for processing and decision-making. The exploration of suitable protocols and network architectures is essential for ensuring efficient and reliable data transmission in these systems, contributing to the overall goal of enhancing agricultural water use efficiency and crop productivity.
The Message Queuing Telemetry Transport (MQTT) protocol has emerged as a popular choice for real-time data transmission in IoT networks, including those used for automated irrigation management. MQTT is a lightweight, publish-subscribe protocol designed for constrained devices and low-bandwidth networks (Author, 2019). Its simplicity and low overhead make it well-suited for IoT applications where data transmission speed and energy efficiency are critical (Saranyadevi et al., 2022). MQTT provides three Quality of Service (QoS) levels, ensuring data reliability in real-time scenarios (Author, 2019). Chen et al. (2020) proposed novel algorithms to improve data exchange efficiency and handle rerouting in MQTT-based IoT networks for automated irrigation management systems. Their TBRouting algorithm efficiently finds the shortest paths for data transmission, while the Rerouting algorithm effectively handles the rerouting of topic-based session flows when a broker crashes. The combination of these algorithms can significantly improve the performance and reliability of automated irrigation management systems (Chen et al., 2020).
Client-server IoT networks, such as those based on MQTT, play a crucial role in real-time data transmission for automated irrigation management systems. In these networks, sensors and devices (clients) publish data to a central broker (server), which then distributes the data to subscribed clients (Verma et al., 2021). This architecture enables efficient data collection, processing, and dissemination, facilitating the integration of various components within the automated irrigation management pipeline. Verma et al. (2021) proposed an architecture for healthcare monitoring systems using IoT and communication protocols, which provides a comprehensive overview of existing approaches and highlights challenges and opportunities in the field. Although focused on healthcare, the insights from this study can be applied to automated irrigation management systems, emphasizing the importance of interoperability and standardization for seamless integration (Verma et al., 2021).
In addition to MQTT, other application layer protocols such as XMPP, CoAP, SOAP, and HTTP have been explored for real-time data transmission in IoT networks. Each protocol has its strengths and weaknesses, making them suitable for different applications and scenarios. XMPP (Extensible Messaging and Presence Protocol) is an open-standard protocol that supports real-time messaging, presence, and request-response services (Saint-Andre, 2011). CoAP (Constrained Application Protocol) is a specialized web transfer protocol designed for use with constrained nodes and networks in the Internet of Things (Shelby et al., 2014). SOAP (Simple Object Access Protocol) is a protocol for exchanging structured information in the implementation of web services, while HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol) is the foundation of data communication for the World Wide Web (Fielding et al., 1999).
Motamedi and Villányi (2022) compared and evaluated wireless communication protocols for the implementation of smart irrigation systems in greenhouses, considering factors such as power consumption, range, reliability, and scalability. They found that ZigBee is the most suitable local communication protocol for greenhouse irrigation due to its large number of nodes and long range, while MQTT is the recommended messaging protocol for smart irrigation systems due to its TCP transport protocol and quality of service (QoS) options. GSM is a reliable and cost-effective global communication protocol for greenhouse irrigation, providing wide coverage and low cost (Motamedi & Villányi, 2022).
Syafarinda et al. (2018) investigated the use of the MQTT protocol in a precision agriculture system using a Wireless Sensor Network (WSN). They found that MQTT is suitable for use in IoT applications due to its lightweight, simple, and low bandwidth requirements. The average data transmission speed using the MQTT protocol was approximately 1 second, demonstrating its effectiveness for real-time data transmission in precision agriculture systems (Syafarinda et al., 2018).
The choice of application layer protocol for real-time irrigation management depends on factors such as data transmission speed, reliability, and energy efficiency. MQTT and RTPS (Real-Time Publish-Subscribe) are both suitable for real-time data transmission in IoT systems, but they have different strengths and weaknesses. MQTT is a better choice for applications that require low latency and high throughput, while RTPS is a better choice for applications that require high reliability and low latency (Sanchez-Iborra & Skarmeta, 2021). The exploration of MQTT and client-server IoT networks, along with the comparison of various application layer protocols, provides valuable insights into the suitability of these technologies for real-time data transmission in automated irrigation management systems.
In summary, real-time data transmission protocols and technologies play a vital role in the automation of irrigation management systems, enabling the efficient and reliable delivery of sensor data to the cloud for processing and decision-making. The exploration of MQTT and client-server IoT networks, along with the comparison of application layer protocols, highlights the importance of selecting suitable technologies based on factors such as data transmission speed, reliability, and energy efficiency. By leveraging these technologies, automated irrigation management systems can achieve seamless integration and contribute to the overall goal of enhancing agricultural water use efficiency and crop productivity.

3.5. Challenges and Solutions in Real-Time Data Transmission
Following the exploration of data collection, processing at the edge and fog, and automation in previous sections, we now turn to the critical aspect of real-time data transmission. While essential for automated irrigation management, this stage presents unique challenges that must be addressed to ensure system efficiency and reliability.
Obstacles in Real-Time Data Transmission
Agricultural environments present unique challenges for real-time data transmission, directly impacting the effectiveness of automated irrigation systems. Environmental factors can significantly disrupt wireless communication. Adverse weather conditions such as heavy rain, fog, and high winds can weaken or even block radio signals, leading to data loss and compromised system performance. Physical obstacles like trees, buildings, and uneven terrain further complicate signal propagation, creating reliability issues (Jukan et al., 2017; Yi & Ji, 2014; Zhang, Chang & Baoguo, 2018). These environmental challenges necessitate robust communication protocols and network architectures that can ensure consistent and reliable data flow.
In addition to environmental factors, technical limitations also present significant obstacles. Large-scale agricultural operations often demand long-distance data transmission, which can be hindered by the limited range of certain wireless communication protocols. Network congestion, occurring when multiple sensors transmit data concurrently, can lead to delays and potential data loss, further complicating real-time decision-making (Hameed et al., 2020). To mitigate these issues, researchers have investigated the potential of cognitive radio networks (CRNs) and dynamic spectrum access (DSA) for optimizing spectrum utilization and reducing interference (Righi et al., 2017; Shafi et al., 2018; Trigka & Dritsas, 2022). CRNs enable devices to intelligently sense and adapt to the surrounding radio environment, dynamically adjusting transmission parameters to avoid interference and improve communication efficiency. DSA, on the other hand, facilitates the dynamic allocation of unused spectrum, enhancing spectrum utilization and reducing congestion.
Furthermore, data security and privacy are paramount concerns in real-time irrigation systems. The sensitive nature of agricultural data, such as crop yields and farm management practices, necessitates robust security measures to prevent unauthorized access and data breaches (Gupta et al., 2020). Implementing secure communication protocols, authentication mechanisms, and encryption techniques is essential to protect data integrity and ensure the trustworthiness of the system.
Investigating Data Optimization Techniques
To enhance the efficiency and reliability of real-time data transmission in automated irrigation systems, researchers have explored a range of data optimization techniques. Data compression techniques aim to reduce the size of data packets transmitted over the network, minimizing bandwidth requirements and improving transmission speed (Rady et al., 2020; Karim et al., 2023). Lossless compression algorithms, such as Huffman coding and LZW, preserve data integrity while effectively reducing data size, ensuring that no information is lost during transmission (Cui, 2023). Lossy compression algorithms, such as JPEG and MP3, offer higher compression ratios but introduce a controlled level of data loss, which may be acceptable for certain applications where some loss of precision is tolerable (Karim et al., 2023). The choice between lossless and lossy compression depends on the specific application and the trade-off between data size and accuracy.
Data aggregation techniques provide another effective approach to optimize data transmission. By aggregating multiple sensor readings into a single representative value, such as average soil moisture or temperature, the number of transmissions can be significantly reduced, conserving bandwidth and energy resources (Cui, 2023). This is particularly beneficial in large-scale irrigation systems where numerous sensors are deployed across vast areas, generating substantial amounts of data. Additionally, data filtering techniques play a crucial role in improving data quality and reliability. Kalman filters and particle filters can effectively remove noise and outliers from sensor data, ensuring that only accurate and relevant information is transmitted and used for decision-making (Cui, 2023). This is essential for preventing erroneous data from influencing irrigation decisions and potentially leading to suboptimal water management.
Sensor calibration, drift correction, and fault detection are essential for maintaining data accuracy and reliability (Dos Santos et al., 2023). Regular calibration ensures that sensors provide accurate measurements over time, while drift correction techniques account for gradual changes in sensor readings due to environmental factors or aging. Fault detection mechanisms can identify and address sensor malfunctions or anomalies, preventing erroneous data from influencing irrigation decisions and potentially harming crops or wasting water.
Addressing the Challenges
Effectively addressing the challenges in real-time data transmission requires a multifaceted approach that encompasses environmental, technical, and data-related considerations. Implementing robust and adaptive communication protocols is crucial for overcoming interference and signal degradation caused by weather conditions and physical obstacles. Selecting appropriate protocols, such as LoRa or ZigBee, with suitable range and penetration capabilities can ensure reliable data transmission in challenging agricultural environments (Motamedi & Villányi, 2022). Additionally, employing techniques like frequency hopping and error correction codes can further improve communication resilience and mitigate data loss.
Optimizing network architecture is another key consideration. Deploying a distributed network architecture with edge and fog computing capabilities can significantly enhance data processing and transmission efficiency (Abdel Nasser et al., 2020; Tran et al., 2019). Edge devices can perform initial data processing and aggregation tasks, reducing the amount of data transmitted to the cloud and minimizing latency, while fog nodes can provide additional processing power and storage closer to the data source, enhancing scalability and reliability. This distributed approach alleviates the burden on the central cloud server and allows for more responsive and efficient irrigation management.
Data optimization techniques play a vital role in reducing bandwidth requirements and improving transmission efficiency. The choice of data compression, aggregation, and filtering techniques should be tailored to the specific requirements of the irrigation system, considering factors such as data type, accuracy needs, and available bandwidth. By carefully selecting and implementing these techniques, the overall performance and effectiveness of real-time irrigation systems can be significantly enhanced, leading to more sustainable water management practices and improved agricultural productivity.
By addressing these challenges and implementing appropriate solutions, real-time data transmission can become a reliable and efficient component of automated irrigation systems, contributing to the overall goal of achieving sustainable and productive agriculture in the face of growing food demands and water scarcity.

3.6. IoT Network Architectures and Variable Rate Irrigation (VRI) for Real-Time Irrigation
Real-time irrigation management systems heavily rely on the efficient and reliable transmission of data from sensors and weather stations to the cloud for processing and decision-making. However, agricultural environments present unique challenges to wireless communication, including adverse weather conditions, physical obstacles, and the limitations of wireless technologies. These challenges necessitate robust and adaptive solutions to ensure the consistent and timely flow of data, enabling truly autonomous irrigation scheduling.
Environmental factors, such as heavy rain, fog, and strong winds, can significantly disrupt wireless communication by attenuating or even blocking radio signals, leading to data loss and compromised system performance (Ed-daoudi et al., 2023; Jukan et al., 2017; Yi & Ji, 2014; Zhang, Chang & Baoguo, 2018). Dense vegetation, buildings, and uneven terrain create further complications by causing multipath propagation and shadowing effects (Yim et al., 2018; Gautam and Pagay, 2020). The study by Yim et al. (2018) on LoRa networks in a tree farm environment exemplifies these challenges, revealing reduced communication range and data reliability compared to theoretical expectations. This underscores the need for carefully selecting and optimizing communication protocols and network parameters to ensure reliable data transmission in such environments.
The study by Guzinski et al. (2014a) using a modified TSEB model further highlights the importance of high-resolution data in accurately capturing the spatial and temporal dynamics of energy fluxes influenced by environmental factors. This emphasizes the need for advanced data acquisition and processing techniques that can effectively represent the complexities of agricultural settings.
The limitations of traditional wireless communication technologies, such as limited range and network congestion, pose additional challenges for large-scale agricultural operations. Long-distance data transmission can be hindered by range limitations, while network congestion arising from numerous sensors transmitting concurrently can lead to delays and data loss, hindering real-time decision-making (Hameed et al., 2020). Addressing these challenges requires the exploration of advanced networking technologies that can optimize spectrum utilization, mitigate interference, and improve reliability and efficiency.
Cognitive Radio Networks (CRNs) and Dynamic Spectrum Access (DSA) offer promising solutions for optimizing wireless communication in agricultural settings. CRNs empower devices with the ability to intelligently sense and adapt to the surrounding radio environment, dynamically adjusting transmission parameters to avoid interference and improve communication efficiency (Righi et al., 2017; Shafi et al., 2018; Trigka & Dritsas, 2022). Research has explored the potential of CRNs in predicting Radio Frequency (RF) power to avoid noisy channels and optimize spectrum utilization (Iliya et al., 2014; Iliya et al., 2014). These studies demonstrate the effectiveness of combining optimization algorithms with artificial neural networks (ANNs) to enhance the accuracy and generalization of RF power prediction, enabling CRNs to make informed decisions about channel selection and avoid interference.
DSA complements CRN technology by dynamically allocating unused spectrum, further enhancing spectrum utilization and reducing congestion (Shi et al., 2023). The numerical model developed by Shi et al. (2023) showcases the potential of CRNs and DSA for optimizing wireless communication in challenging environments.
The integration of CRNs and DSA into the IoT network architecture requires careful consideration of spectrum sensing techniques, network topology, and data security. Research on cooperative spectrum sensing suggests that distributed approaches, where sensor nodes collaborate and share information, can significantly improve the accuracy and efficiency of spectrum sensing, particularly in dynamic environments (Trigka and Dritsas, 2022; Khalid & Yu, 2019). This collaborative approach enables a more comprehensive understanding of the radio environment and facilitates the identification of available frequency bands for data transmission.
The choice of network topology also impacts the performance and scalability of CRN-based irrigation systems. Mesh networks, where sensor nodes are interconnected and relay data for each other, offer enhanced resilience and coverage compared to star topologies where nodes communicate directly with a central gateway (Akyildiz & Vuran, 2010). However, mesh networks can be more complex to manage and may introduce additional routing overhead. The trade-off between network resilience and complexity needs to be carefully evaluated to select the most appropriate topology for a specific agricultural setting.
Data security and privacy are paramount concerns in IoT-based irrigation systems due to the sensitive nature of agricultural data (Gupta et al., 2020). Implementing secure communication protocols, authentication mechanisms, and encryption techniques is essential for protecting data integrity and ensuring system trustworthiness. Research on secure spectrum leasing and resource allocation algorithms for CR-WSN-based irrigation systems has demonstrated the potential of these technologies for enhancing security and efficiency (Hassan, 2023; Afghah et al., 2018).
In conclusion, the development of effective and reliable real-time irrigation management systems requires a comprehensive approach that addresses the challenges of data transmission in agricultural environments. The integration of robust and adaptive communication protocols, optimized network architectures, and advanced networking technologies like CRNs and DSA, along with a focus on data security and privacy, can contribute significantly to achieving the goal of autonomous and efficient irrigation scheduling.
4. AUTOMATED DATA PROCESSING IN THE CLOUD
4.1. Data Quality and Preprocessing
Data quality is paramount in automated irrigation systems as it directly influences the effectiveness of decision-making and water use efficiency. Issues like missing values, inconsistencies, and outliers arising from sensor malfunctions, environmental interference, or network problems (Lv et al., 2023) can significantly impact the performance of machine learning models used for irrigation scheduling and management.
Real-time data cleaning techniques are essential for addressing these challenges. Kalman filtering proves particularly effective in handling missing values and correcting erroneous readings by recursively estimating the system's state based on previous measurements and current sensor data, taking into account noise and uncertainty (Kim et al., 2020). Moving average techniques, by averaging consecutive data points, provide a more stable representation of the underlying trend, filtering out short-term fluctuations (Chhetri, 2023). For outlier detection, adaptive thresholding methods offer a dynamic approach, adjusting thresholds based on the statistical properties of the data to effectively identify anomalies and minimize false positives (Bah et al., 2021). These techniques are crucial in maintaining the integrity of real-time data streams and ensuring the accuracy of subsequent analyses.
Adaptive data preprocessing is essential for managing the diversity of data sources and formats commonly found in irrigation systems. Data normalization techniques, such as min-max scaling or z-score normalization, ensure that all features contribute equally to the analysis by transforming data values to a common scale (Pradal et al., 2016). This is crucial for preventing features with larger values from dominating the analysis and ensuring that all features are given equal consideration. Similarly, feature scaling methods, like standardization or normalization, optimize the range of feature values to improve the performance and convergence of machine learning models (Tortorici et al., 2024). By scaling features to a similar range, the influence of outliers is reduced, and the model's ability to learn from the data is enhanced.
Data fusion techniques play a critical role in integrating information from diverse sources, creating a more comprehensive and reliable dataset for irrigation management. Dempster-Shafer theory, a generalization of probability theory, allows for the expression of both uncertainty and the degree of conflict in evidence, making it suitable for fusing uncertain and conflicting data from heterogeneous sources (Sadiq and Rodriguez, 2004). This is particularly relevant in irrigation systems where data from different sensors may provide slightly different or even contradictory information due to sensor variations or environmental factors. Bayesian inference offers another powerful framework for combining information from multiple sources, updating the probability of a hypothesis as new evidence becomes available. By applying these techniques, data from soil moisture sensors, canopy temperature sensors, weather stations, and other sources can be integrated to provide a holistic understanding of crop water requirements and environmental conditions, leading to more informed and accurate irrigation decisions.
The impact of data quality extends beyond model accuracy to the robustness of machine learning models under varying conditions. Robust models should maintain consistent performance even when faced with data inconsistencies or unexpected situations. Techniques like data augmentation and domain adaptation can enhance model robustness by exposing the model to a wider range of data variations during training. Data augmentation involves generating additional training data by applying transformations or introducing noise to existing data, making the model more resilient to noise and variations in the real-world data. Domain adaptation techniques aim to adapt a model trained on one domain (e.g., a specific crop or geographic location) to perform well on another domain with different data characteristics. This is particularly relevant in irrigation management, where models may need to be applied to different crops, soil types, or climatic conditions.
The choice of data cleaning, preprocessing, and fusion techniques should be carefully considered based on the specific characteristics of the irrigation system and the available data. By selecting and implementing appropriate techniques, the accuracy, reliability, and robustness of machine learning models can be significantly improved, leading to more efficient and sustainable irrigation management practices.
4.2. Scalable and Autonomous Deployment using Containerization Strategies
The transition from data collection and transmission to efficient data processing requires a robust infrastructure capable of handling diverse workloads and data volumes. Containerization technologies, specifically Docker and Kubernetes, offer a promising solution for deploying and scaling data processing and machine learning modules within cloud environments like AWS, Azure, and GCP (Vargas-Rojas et al., 2024; Rosendo et al., 2022; Solayman & Qasha, 2023). Docker provides a standardized way to package applications and their dependencies into self-contained units known as containers, ensuring consistent and reproducible execution across different platforms (Rosendo et al., 2022). Kubernetes, acting as a container orchestrator, manages their deployment, scaling, and networking across a cluster of machines (Rosendo et al., 2022). This combination presents several advantages for automated irrigation management systems.
Firstly, containerization facilitates efficient resource utilization and scalability. By encapsulating applications and their dependencies, containers enable the isolation of resources and prevent conflicts between different modules (Vargas-Rojas et al., 2024; Solayman & Qasha, 2023). This isolation allows for the efficient allocation of resources, such as CPU, memory, and storage, to each container based on its specific needs. Kubernetes further enhances scalability by allowing for the automatic scaling of containers based on real-time demand, ensuring the system can adapt to varying workloads and data volumes, preventing bottlenecks, and ensuring responsiveness to changing conditions (Karamolegkos et al., 2023).
Secondly, containerization promotes portability and reproducibility. By packaging applications and their dependencies into a single unit, containers make it easy to move and deploy them across different cloud environments without the need for environment-specific configurations (Rosendo et al., 2022; Solayman & Qasha, 2023). This portability simplifies the development and deployment process, reducing the time and effort required to set up and manage the system. Additionally, containers ensure reproducibility by providing a consistent execution environment, regardless of the underlying infrastructure. This eliminates variability and ensures that the system will behave consistently across different deployments (Zhou et al., 2023).
Optimizing container orchestration and resource allocation is crucial to minimizing latency and maximizing throughput in real-time data processing pipelines. Techniques like auto-scaling and dynamic resource allocation play a critical role in this context (Hethcoat et al., 2024; Werner and Tai, 2023; Kumar et al., 2024). Auto-scaling automatically adjusts the number of container instances based on real-time demand, ensuring that sufficient resources are available to handle peak workloads while avoiding over-provisioning during periods of low demand (Hethcoat et al., 2024; Kumar et al., 2024). Dynamic resource allocation enables the fine-grained adjustment of resources allocated to each container based on its specific needs and the current workload (Werner and Tai, 2023). This ensures efficient resource allocation and provides each container with the necessary resources to perform its tasks effectively.
Performance monitoring tools, such as Kubernetes Metrics Server and Prometheus, are essential for gaining insights into the performance of containers and the overall system (Hethcoat et al., 2024; Kuity & Peddoju, 2023). These tools provide valuable data on key performance indicators, such as CPU and memory usage, network traffic, and application-specific metrics. By monitoring this data, administrators can identify bottlenecks, optimize resource allocation strategies, and continuously improve system performance (Hethcoat et al., 2024). This data-driven approach ensures that automated irrigation management systems can operate efficiently and reliably.
By integrating containerization technologies with optimization techniques and performance monitoring, automated irrigation management systems achieve the scalability, autonomy, and efficiency required for effective real-time data processing and decision-making. This approach facilitates a seamless and responsive system that can adapt to changing conditions and contribute to the overall goal of optimizing water resource management and increasing agricultural productivity.

4.3. Deploying ML Models for Data Processing
Transitioning from data collection, preprocessing, and transmission, the deployment of machine learning (ML) models marks a pivotal stage in the automated irrigation management pipeline. This stage entails utilizing cloud platforms to facilitate real-time data processing and inference, enabling data-driven decision-making for optimal irrigation management and ultimately contributing to fully autonomous, scalable irrigation management.
Several architectures and frameworks exist for deploying ML models on cloud platforms, each offering unique advantages and catering to different requirements. TensorFlow Serving, for instance, provides a high-performance system specifically designed for serving TensorFlow models (Abadi et al., 2016). This framework enables efficient and scalable inference, making it suitable for real-time applications where low latency and high throughput are crucial. For instance, in a large-scale irrigation system with numerous sensors generating data continuously, TensorFlow Serving can efficiently handle the high volume of inference requests and provide timely predictions for irrigation scheduling. Similarly, Apache MXNet Model Server offers a flexible and efficient solution for deploying models trained with MXNet, supporting a wide range of deep learning models and inference backends (MXNet Developers, 2015). This versatility makes it suitable for complex irrigation systems that may utilize different types of ML models for various tasks, such as predicting crop water requirements, detecting plant stress, or forecasting weather conditions. ONNX Runtime, on the other hand, provides a cross-platform inference engine compatible with various ML frameworks, including PyTorch, TensorFlow, and MXNet (Microsoft, 2017). This versatility enables the deployment of models in diverse environments, facilitating interoperability and reducing the need for model conversion. For example, an irrigation system that uses models trained in different frameworks can utilize ONNX Runtime to deploy them on a single platform without the need for time-consuming and error-prone model conversion processes.
Choosing the appropriate architecture or framework depends on several factors, including the specific ML framework used for model training, the desired level of performance and scalability, and the need for cross-platform compatibility. For instance, if the primary concern is low latency and high throughput for real-time inference, TensorFlow Serving might be the optimal choice for TensorFlow models. However, if flexibility and support for various deep learning models are required, Apache MXNet Model Server could be more suitable. In cases where cross-platform compatibility is essential, ONNX Runtime offers a versatile solution.
Once the ML model is deployed, optimizing its performance and resource utilization becomes crucial for ensuring the efficiency of integrated end-to-end automated irrigation systems. Model compression techniques, such as pruning and quantization, offer effective methods for reducing the size and computational requirements of ML models without compromising accuracy (Premkumar & Sigappi, 2022). Pruning involves eliminating unnecessary connections or neurons from the model, effectively streamlining its structure and reducing computational complexity. This can be particularly beneficial for deep learning models, which often have a large number of parameters and can be prone to overfitting. By removing redundant or less important connections, pruning can improve modelgeneralizability and reduce inference time. Quantization, on the other hand, involves reducing the precision of model parameters, typically from 32-bit floating-point numbers to lower-precision formats such as 8-bit integers. This reduction in precision leads to smaller model sizes and faster inference speeds, making it particularly beneficial for resource-constrained environments or real-time applications. For instance, in edge computing scenarios where ML models are deployed on devices with limited computational resources, quantization can enable efficient inference without sacrificing accuracy.
Furthermore, hardware acceleration through the utilization of GPUs or TPUs can significantly enhance model performance by leveraging specialized hardware designed for parallel processing (Premkumar & Sigappi, 2022). GPUs, with their massive parallelism and high memory bandwidth, excel at accelerating matrix operations and convolutions, which are fundamental computations in many deep learning models. This acceleration can significantly reduce inference time and enable real-time processing of sensor data for timely irrigation decisions. TPUs, specifically designed for deep learning workloads, offer even greater performance and energy efficiency for specific model architectures. These hardware accelerators can drastically reduce inference time, enabling near real-time decision-making and enhancing the responsiveness of automated irrigation systems. For example, in a scenario where immediate response to changing weather conditions or soil moisture levels is critical, hardware acceleration can ensure that irrigation decisions are made and executed promptly.
In addition to model compression and hardware acceleration, distributed training techniques play a crucial role in optimizing the training process for large-scale ML models. Techniques such as Horovod and BytePS enable the distribution of training across multiple machines, effectively parallelizing the process and reducing training time (Premkumar & Sigappi, 2022). This is particularly beneficial for complex models with a large number of parameters or when dealing with large datasets. By leveraging distributed training, irrigation management systems can train more sophisticated models and improve their predictive capabilities, leading to more accurate and efficient irrigation decisions. For instance, a system that utilizes a deep learning model with millions of parameters can benefit from distributed training to reduce training time from days to hours, enabling faster model iteration and improvement.
Integrating the deployed ML models with other components of the automated irrigation management pipeline is essential for achieving a fully autonomous and cohesive system and addressing the need for seamless integration across the automated irrigation management system. Standardized protocols, such as MQTT and CoAP, provide lightweight and efficient communication channels for exchanging data between these components (Poojara et al., 2023; Jimenez et al., 2020a; Gour et al., 2023). MQTT, with its publish-subscribe architecture, enables real-time data streaming and event-driven communication, making it suitable for transmitting sensor data, control signals, and inference results (Raikar & M, 2023). This enables the ML model to receive real-time updates on soil moisture, weather conditions, and plant health, allowing for dynamic adjustments to irrigation schedules based on the latest data. CoAP, designed for constrained devices and low-power networks, offers a web-transfer protocol for resource-constrained environments, enabling efficient communication between sensors, actuators, and the ML models (Raikar & M, 2023). This is particularly relevant in situations where sensors or actuators have limited processing power or battery life, as CoAP minimizes communication overhead and energy consumption. Additionally, RESTful APIs provide a standardized interface for accessing and controlling the ML models, enabling seamless integration with other software components and facilitating system management and monitoring (Wang et al., 2022). This allows for easy integration with existing farm management systems or third-party applications, creating a unified platform for comprehensive irrigation management.4.4. Online Learning in the Cloud
The complexities of real-time data processing in irrigation management necessitate the exploration of advanced techniques to continuously learn and adapt to the dynamic nature of agricultural environments. Online learning algorithms offer a promising solution, enabling the continuous update and improvement of machine learning models based on incoming real-time data. This adaptability is crucial for addressing the challenges of changing environmental conditions, such as weather patterns and crop growth stages, and optimizing irrigation decision-making to enhance water usage efficiency and crop productivity.
Several online learning algorithms have demonstrated potential for real-time data processing and model adaptation in the context of irrigation management. Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) facilitates the incremental update of model parameters with each new data point, allowing for efficient adaptation to changing data distributions (Bottou, 2010). This incremental learning process ensures that the model remains responsive to the latest conditions, minimizing the risk of outdated predictions and improving the accuracy of irrigation decisions. Passive-Aggressive algorithms, on the other hand, adjust model parameters only when a misclassification occurs, providing a computationally efficient approach for handling large data streams (Crammer et al., 2006). These algorithms offer a robust approach to handling noisy data, a common challenge in real-world sensor readings, by making small adjustments only when the model's prediction deviates significantly from the actual value (Fei et al., 2019). Online Random Forests extend the concept of random forests to the online setting, enabling the incremental construction and update of decision trees as new data arrives (Saffari et al., 2009). The continuous evolution of the ensemble ensures that the model remains relevant to the changing environment, capturing intricate relationships between variables and leading to more informed irrigation decisions.
Research in various domains highlights the importance of online learning for real-time data stream analytics. Snyder et al. (2020) explored the application of online learning techniques for identifying relevant tweets in real-time, improving situational awareness for first responders. The proposed interactive learning framework allows users to continuously label the relevance of incoming tweets, enabling the real-time refinement of the underlying machine learning model. This user-guided approach aligns well with the dynamic nature of irrigation management, where models need to continuously adjust to varying environmental conditions and crop water requirements. Similarly, research in the field of cyber-physical systems (CPS) underscores the need for online learning algorithms to effectively extract insights and knowledge from continuously generated data streams (Fei et al., 2019). These capabilities are crucial for enabling feedback loops between physical processes and cyber elements, facilitating the integration and optimization of CPS in irrigation management systems.
To implement online learning in cloud-based irrigation management systems, various architectures and frameworks can be considered. Apache Spark Streaming, Apache Flink, and AWS Kinesis provide scalable and fault-tolerant platforms for processing real-time data streams, allowing for the development of online learning pipelines that continuously ingest and analyze data to update machine learning models (Zaharia et al., 2012; Carbone et al., 2015; Amazon Web Services, 2023). These frameworks leverage serverless computing paradigms, automatically scaling resources based on the volume and velocity of incoming data, ensuring efficient resource utilization and responsiveness to fluctuations in demand (Fei et al., 2019).
Effectively managing the exploration-exploitation trade-off is crucial for optimizing online learning in irrigation management. Techniques such as Multi-armed bandits (Sutton & Barto, 2018), Bayesian optimization (Shahriari et al., 2016), and Reinforcement Learning (RL) (Sutton & Barto, 2018) can be employed to balance the allocation of resources between exploring new irrigation strategies and exploiting the current best-performing approaches. These techniques enable the identification of optimal irrigation policies, adapting to changing environmental conditions and maximizing long-term rewards.
In conclusion, online learning techniques, coupled with scalable cloud-based architectures, offer a powerful solution for real-time data processing and continuous adaptation in irrigation management systems. By leveraging algorithms like SGD, Passive-Aggressive, and Online Random Forests, along with stream processing frameworks like Apache Spark Streaming, Apache Flink, and AWS Kinesis, irrigation management systems can effectively handle the complexities of real-time data, optimize water usage, and enhance crop productivity in the face of dynamic environmental conditions.

other type of future protocols. At the application level, the platform is open to integration with

Abstract: The continuous evolution of the agricultural sector justiﬁes the incorporation and
adaptation of the latest technologies. Nowadays, managing crops is possible through Internet-based
technologies. Their application allows for the exploitation of information and the development of
isolated applications, which, although powerful, create challenges for obtaining scalable predictions
throughout the useful life of farms. To address this problem, a data model was deﬁned to improve
the management of crop plots in irrigation communities and simultaneously monitor crop needs.
Consequently, the objective of this study was to create an open and interoperable platform based on
standard interfaces and protocols to enable the integration of heterogeneous sources of information,
while ensuring interoperability with other third-party solutions for exchanging and exploiting such
information. Standard and open interfaces and protocols form the basis of the platform, thereby
unifying all information in a single data model, which facilitates the better use and dissemination of
information. The system was fully instantiated in a real prototype in an irrigation community; the
software improved water irrigation management for the farmers connected to the platform.

1. Introduction
Society is characterized by uncertainty and constant technological changes. The productive sectors
that are more digitized tend to improve their productivity faster than those that are less digitized.
Irrigation farming communities have beneﬁted for many years from the use of information and
communications technology (ICT), which allows them to improve the current agricultural development,
facilitate the fulﬁllment of daily tasks, and convert farms into efﬁcient and sustainable production
systems. The use of these new technologies not only enables the digital transformation process
demanded by the sector, but also supports irrigation communities and other farming groups with tools
for analysis and prediction, improving optimization.
The digital transformation and continuous technological advances that are currently occurring,
e.g., the Internet of Things (IoT) [1], big data, cloud computing [2], artiﬁcial intelligence, and aerial
images [3] to name a few, are providing the agricultural sector with new tools that help determine
the real needs of farms and improve their efﬁciency. Speciﬁcally, the use of the IoT has changed the

traditional paradigm regarding access to and the management of sensors and actuators, making
all objects accessible through the Internet, and transferring the management and integration of
information and real knowledge into the digital world [4].
This transformation has produced
improvements compared to the techniques traditionally used [5], allowing new mechanisms to help in
the management of farms. These advantages are mainly focused on the following:
•
Problem detection: The implementation of new technologies such as satellite images, variable
application algorithms, drones, high-tech sensors, mobile applications, and GPS guides, allowing
for the assessment of crop status and the detection of problems (improper fertilizer use, water
stress, changing weather conditions, and pest monitoring) before they start to interfere with
crop performance;
•
Productivity improvement: The sensorization of crops allows for the establishment of patterns of
planting and fertilization depending on factors such as the type of seeds and soil conditions, to
improve crop production levels;
•
Improvement in decision making: By analyzing and monitoring agronomic parameters, crop water
needs, and precipitation forecasts, it is possible to identify which areas of land need more water
and schedule irrigation to vary the volume of water applied without imposing water stress on
the crop;
•
Behaviour analysis: As a result of continuous crop monitoring and the analysis of the relationships
among different elements, such as yield, energy efﬁciency, and the agricultural practices used, the
most beneﬁcial actions and those that must be eliminated or modiﬁed can be identiﬁed.
Motivated by the digital transformation, the agricultural sector is providing its farms with new
devices and services (sensors, actuators, weather information, drones, and satellite images) that allow
for the optimization of the resources, to improve productivity and simultaneously reduce the impact
on the environment. For the digital transformation of the agricultural sector, a common integration
framework is needed that uniﬁes the entire dataset, so that new services are generated according to
the needs of the sector. The data generated by the farms are crucial and have to be part of a unique
semantic model that organizes and evaluates all the data collected.
At the European level, an open initiative, FIWARE [6], offers a framework using a set of standard
and open Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) based on Next Generation Service Interface
(NGSI), promoted by the Open Mobile Alliance (OMA), or Next Generation Service Interfaces
with Linked Data (NGSI-LD) [7], promoted by ETSI Industry Speciﬁcation Group for Context
Information Management (ETSI ISG CIM), to deﬁne a universal set of standards based on the contextual
management of the data. Therefore, adhering the standards and abandoning the code and proprietary
technologies can contribute to improving the competitiveness of the agricultural sector. In a world
where everything is connected, isolated solutions have no place. By contrast, interoperability must be
the cornerstone feature that all solutions adopt, thus contributing to a more productive environment
where information is exchanged for a greater good. The proposed solution is a platform that allows
for the integration of different suppliers’ devices, and implements standards and open interfaces and
data models based on NGSI-LD. Additionally, the platform exploits the stored information to analyze,
in real time, the factors associated with the production process, the evolution of the crops, and the
optimal use of water for irrigation. The core features the platform are as follows:
1.
Scalability and ﬂexibility:The platform, instead of being locked to a single provider, is up to date
with protocols, technologies, and features that vary rapidly. It is network-independent and can be
integrated to work with all vital technological systems;
2.
Interoperable: The platform offers a wide range of IoT agents that facilitate the connection with
devices that use standardized IoT protocols, such as Lightweight Machine to Machine (LWM2M)
over Constrained Application Protocol (CoAP), JavaScript Object Notation (JSON), or UltraLight
(UL) over HTTP/MQTT, with the possibility of using parameterizing agents to integrate any
other type of future protocols. At the application level, the platform is open to integration with
other third-party platforms using both API and data model based on NGSI-LD.

3.
Semantic enrichment: The use of the data model to homogenize the management of the different
elements that are part of a farm;
4.
Efﬁciency and competitiveness: The model allows precise and timely decisions to be made in terms
of management and agricultural processes. The ability to automatically document the health
status of the crop or natural resources provides an efﬁcient and effective diagnosis technique
for managers.
The remainder of this paper is structured as follows: In Section 2, the proposed solution is
introduced, detailing the most unique elements. Section 3 outlines the deployment in a community
of irrigators. Section 4 shows the evaluation of the system at different levels of implementation and
the results obtained. Finally, in Section 5, the conclusion and new proposals based in these results
are described.
1.1. Information Models Applied to Agriculture
The data collected by all connected devices are characterized by scalability, heterogeneity,
and dynamism:
•
Scalability: Millions of sensors continuously generating large amounts of information;
•
Heterogeneity: There is a wide variety of sensors;
•
Dynamism: The high speed of generation produced the need to generate data models that allow
for better use and dissemination of the information from these devices.
Given the above factors, interoperability mechanisms must be generated that allow for the
integration of different devices, applications, or platforms to ﬁlter the vast amounts of information
that many systems are producing [8]. The shared data models are useful as they are essential resources
that improve the communication, knowledge recovery, and interoperability of information systems to
develop better applications for the agri-food sector [9].
Today, different data models are available; many of them were developed by the organizations
in charge of developing their standards. The Open Geospatial Consortium (OGC) data models are
used primarily in geosciences and environmental domains, including the SensorThings API, based on
the Observations and Measurements (O&M) data model (OGC/ISO 19156:2011), which transforms
the numerous unconnected IoT systems into a fully connected platform where complex tasks can
be performed and synchronized. The Open Connectivity Foundation speciﬁes data models based
on vertical industries such as the automotive, healthcare, industrial, and smart home sectors. The
World Wide Web Consortium Thing Description provides some vocabularies to describe real things
but does not focus much on the data. Other vocabularies, such as those offered by the INSPIRE
directive [10], deﬁne the rules on the interoperability of spatial data sets and their associated services;
these are mandatory.
Currently, some resources speed up the data modeling of a speciﬁc location or sector. In the ﬁeld
of agriculture, Drury et al. [11] presented different types of tools to help us develop this task:
•
Controlled vocabulary (a set of preselected terms or words for a speciﬁc domain): An example
is AGROVOC vocabulary, promoted by the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United
Nations (FAO) and available in multiple languages.
•
Miscellaneous ontologies: Crop Ontology, AgroPortal, Dairy Farming Ontology (DFO), AgOnt,
CIARD Ring, and Vest.
•
Data exchange standards: AgriOpenLink, AgroXML, and AgroRDF; speciﬁc ontologies: SSN (for
sensor discovery) and Cotton Ontology (diseases and pests that affect cotton).
The basis of many decisions is the uniformity of architectures, and ETSI ISG CIM provides the
correct interfaces (006 V1.1.1 (2019-07)) and context information management (CIM) and allows for the
uniﬁed representation of the information through next generation service interfaces with linked data
Sensors 2020, 20, 1153

(NGSI-LD) [12]. This reduces the time and resources required for the management of daily tasks and
for the improvement of the productivity and beneﬁts.
A diverse range of ontological models are available for the IoT, developed with different
objectives [13,14] that describe various areas, such as Fiesta-IoT ontology, which reuses the results
of projects and current EU strategies in semantic web technologies, such as OpenIoT, DUL, VITAL,
Spitﬁre, IoT-O, IoT-A, IoT-Lite, and Sensei. One recent ontology, which is promoted by the ETSI
SmartM2M Technical Committee, is the Smart Appliances REFerence (SAREF) ontology, a shared
model of consensus that facilitates the matching of existing assets in the smart appliances domain and
allows for the separation and recombination of different parts of the ontology according to speciﬁc
needs. For the agricultural ﬁeld, the SAREF4AGRI version [15] was created to provide services for
animal husbandry, intelligent irrigation, and the integration of multiple data sources to provide support
services for decision making.
Some models are promoted by public administrations, such as the standardized water
management model applied to irrigation model (MEGA) [16], an initiative of the Ministry of
Agriculture of Spain, included in the ISO 21622 standard and managed by TRAGSA Group. The
purpose of MEGA is to establish a standardized model that, when applied to irrigation, allows for
interoperability between different systems that coexist in the same facility and thus to efﬁciently
manage irrigation water use. The introduction of the standardized model improves how the irrigation
schedules and the requirements of the control systems are speciﬁed, establishing a clear separation
between decision making and execution.
1.2. IoT Solutions in the Agricultural Sector
Multiple problems exist in the domain of agriculture, such as irrigation, the application of
pesticides and fertilizers, and the monitoring of crops, land, and livestock. Different researchers are
working to provide the best possible solutions:
•
Improvements in productivity:Through the sensorization of crops to provide values in real time,
the farmer can apply irrigation, pesticides, and fertilizers only when they are needed. For example,
Araby et al. [17] proposed the integration of the IoT and machine learning to predict diseases
in horticultural crops before they appear, allowing the farmer to apply the necessary defense
mechanisms, thus improving productivity and reducing the use of pesticides. Trilles et al. [18]
presented a low-cost sensor-equipped platform, SEenviro, which applies a disease model for alert
management in vineyards;
•
Detection of undetected problems: Using satellite images or drones, harmful agronomic factors,
previously untreated, can be detected and mapped in crops using remote-sensing techniques. For
example, De Rango et al. [19] monitored crops using the images provided by a drone to see if they
had parasites and to decide if subsequent treatment was necessary, representing a new technique
for the coordination and control of the drone ﬂeet in precision agriculture (PA);
•
Monitoring the behavior of plants: Through the use of artiﬁcial intelligence to analyze the
entire dataset obtained from crops to make future predictions, the PLANTAE platform [20] is a
system capable of managing the agricultural process and simultaneously using machine-learning
techniques to detect possible diseases in plants. Other works, such as that of Choudhury et al. [21],
monitored the behavior of plants to avoid pests and diseases. Through the use of a mobile
applications, farmers report events that improve the models of diseases used;
•
Efﬁcient water management: Crop water adjustments should avoid water stress. Riquelme
et al. [22] showed how the use of cloud services involving the FIWARE platform allows for the
improvement of the management of water used for irrigation in areas with water deﬁcits. Another
project to be considered, also based on FIWARE, is the SWAMP platform [23]. Its primary objective
is to develop innovative methods based on the IoT for the intelligent management of irrigation
water, using the semantic characteristics provided by a context engine based on the SPARQL
Protocol and RDF Query Language (SPARQL) Event Processing Architecture;
Sensors 2020, 20, 1153
5 of 20
•
Improvement in greenhouse management: By monitoring its different components, Zamora-
Izquierdo et al. [24] proposed a ﬂexible platform capable of meeting the needs of hydroponic
crops in a greenhouse with complete recirculation. For this FIWARE-based deployment, Message
Queuing Telemetry Transport (MQTT) communications were used, with NGSIs being used as a
means to represent the information. Somov et al. [25] constructed a system to monitor both the
conditions established in a greenhouse and the behavior of plants for the prediction of the growth
rate of tomatoes in different environments.
IoT platforms can be considered the backbone of any industrial sector that wants to provide its
activity with a smart component. These platforms collect and store data in a distributed database for
the ﬁltering, analysis, calculation, decision making, management, translation, and visualization of data
in new services. Several analyses of the different types of platforms for the integration of IoT services
and their characteristics can be found, such as that provided by Silva et al. [26], although a results
comparison is difﬁcult because of the lack of standardization.
2. Proposed System
This article proposes an open and interoperable platform for irrigation community management.
The platform, based on standard and open interfaces and protocols, allows for the integration of
heterogeneous information sources as well as interoperability with other third-party solutions for
exchanging and exploiting this information. Additionally, this platform exploits the stored information
to analyze, in real time, the factors associated with the production process, the evolution of crops, and
the optimal use of water for irrigation.
2.1. Proposed Data Model
As a result of the lack of the compatibility necessary to manage the large amount of data generated
by the agricultural sector, agricultural managers must be provided with standardized information
models that permit farmers to make the best possible decisions, allowing them to take advantage of
the available data and knowledge. Therefore, a data model is proposed here that ﬁts the functional
requirements of the users.
The proposed data model is based on interviews with farmers, responsible technicians, and farm
managers about the useful and necessary information that should be managed on a farm. The existing
models are too specialized; although they cover the information that needs to be managed, their
implementation is time-consuming. Therefore, we decided to develop a new model that would meet
the needs of our users.
Conceptually, the model presented is based on the proposed by FIWARE harmonized data
models [27], speciﬁcally, the AgriFood model that includes requirements for irrigation and crop control.
The model was constructed as an agile tool to respond to the requirements farmers allowing them
to characterize the plots, reduce the hydric needs of the crops, and control the soil and water quality
and the associated atmospheric conditions. This ﬁrst version of the model focuses on the efﬁcient
management of the crop plots and all the included elements, as can be seen in the class diagram in
Figure 1.
The proposed data model focuses on the management of crop plots represented by the AgriPlot
entity, which is part of an agricultural holding, represented by the AgriExploitation entity. The plot is
characterized by four pillars that allow it to be uniquely deﬁned:
•
Devices, represented by AgriDevice, are the devices that provide information to the plot and are
classiﬁed based on the parameters studied: AgriDSoil, those that obtain soil values (soil moisture
probes, temperature and soil dissolution); AgriPlant, those that measure the evolution of the crop
(leaf/trunk diameter, stem water potential, and dendrometers); and AgriAtmosphere, which are
the devices that record the atmospheric conditions (temperature, humidity, radiation, and wind
speed). These data are used to optimize agricultural decisions;
Sensors 2020, 20, 1153
6 of 20
•
Water, represented by AgriWater, indicates the type of water used and the parameters that affect
irrigation. AgriAnalysis manages the water analysis conducted at different points of the water
distribution network of the farm. These analyses are usually necessary for fertilization and
irrigation, since they describe the quality and quantity of nutrients carried by the water;
•
Soil, represented by AgriSoil, indicates the type of soil present in the plot. This entity can be more
detailed by indicating the AgriHorizon, which includes the different characteristics of the layers
(horizons) that deﬁne the ground;
•
Cultivation, represented by AgriCrop, deﬁnes the crop and the variety, AgriVariety, with which the
plot is associated. The crop is determined by the different phenological phases that determine its
growth; AgriPhenology provides the crop coefﬁcients and their duration over time. The phenology
is determined by the variety of the crop and the climatic zone, AgriZone since the zone inﬂuences
the optimal climatic conditions for the development of the crops.
Another feature to be considered is the Aerial Images management, represented by the AgriScene
entity, including images or scenes from any satellite or drone; these scenes are composed of bands,
AgriBand, of different wavelengths. In turn, these bands can generate derivative products, AgriProduct,
after processing, such as mosaics (adding two or more adjacent scenes) or indices of vegetation or
water, useful for detecting problems in the ﬁelds.
Figure 1. Speciﬁc data model for agricultural plot management.
The main feature of the IoT-based interoperability mechanisms is the possibility of exchanging
information homogeneously in different systems or applications. One of the elements that enables this
continuous exchange of information is the use of data models. To acquire more signiﬁcant value, the
speciﬁc vocabulary of the sector must be uniﬁed, which is deﬁned by the set of attributes that compose
the entities and their relationships [28]. As NGSI-LD allows us to link data from other vocabularies or
ontologies, we added a level of interoperability to the model. For these reasons, the use of information
models is considered beneﬁcial to allow for the integration of any device or characteristic element of
the study sector.
In Section 3.2, an instantiation of this model is provided using NGSI-LD. The advantages of the
use of NGSI-LD concerning NGSI are as follows:
•
The information model is based on graphs and focuses on information. The concept of Relation
appears. Entities can have properties and relations. Instances of each of the entities can be the
object of the properties or relationships;
•
All data types in NGSI-LD can be associated with unique Uniform Resource Identiﬁer (URI)
corresponding to well-established semantic identiﬁers;
•
It allows one to make references to vocabularies: all terms are deﬁned unequivocally. This allows
users to refer to their information deﬁnitions;
•
The model and query language is more constrained;
•
The use of JSON-LD allows us to operate with linked data to unify vocabularies;
Sensors 2020, 20, 1153
7 of 20
•
There were syntactic differences: the metadata dictionary is no longer needed, GeoProperty is
used instead of geo:json, JSON-LD @context is included, TemporalProperty is used instead of
DateTime, and an “object” ﬁeld is used to encode the relation target.
2.2. System Architecture
Since the new IoT devices and the new communications technologies provide the user with
faster and more efﬁcient communication, we propose an affordable platform, independent of the
provider and interoperable, as the cornerstone for all connections between applications/services
and the irrigation elements. In this way, we offer a common framework so that applications can
interact with any aspect that is part of a farm in a similar way, while being able to act on any device
or controller using the same set of instructions, thus allowing for greater interoperability between
different manufacturers or services.
The architecture of the platform proposed in this paper is depicted in Figure 2. It has a layered
modular form ranging from the deployment of sensors and the monitoring of techniques for data
extraction to the intelligent processing of data. Each of these layers is based on open and standard
initiatives, such as the one provided by the FIWARE community [29] or the ETSI ISG CIM group.
Figure 2. General vision of the proposed architecture.
The ﬁrst layer, Device and Data Acquisition, represents the different sources of information that form
the system; these include sensors, actuators, open information available on the Internet, and databases
with updated information of interest. These devices employ different communication technologies
to transmit information to an IoT Backend module formed by IoT Agents. This module acts as an
intermediary with the second layer and transforms information unidirectionally or bidirectionally
(in the case of actuators), allowing the IoT devices to interact with the platform.
A speciﬁc module is required because of the restrictions imposed by the modules on the processing
capacity, memory, and even the available power to these devices. These restrictions usually prevent
them from using heavy protocols at the application level, so they use lightweight protocols such as
CoAP or MQTT or integrate other solutions such as LoRa and Sigfox to perform communications
Sensors 2020, 20, 1153
8 of 20
with the different devices through Ethernet or mobile networks (e.g., GPRS/3G/4G/NB-IoT/5G).
As such, the IoT backend module component acts as an intermediary by translating the information
sent through these protocols to the interface made available by the broker through NGSI-LD.
The second layer, Information Management, contains software components in charge of data storage,
processing, and distribution. The distributed infrastructure is composed of servers in the cloud that
work together to manage massive amounts of data and make them available to the upper layer. The
NGSI-LD interface is used to send data updates and receive notiﬁcations about data changes. Figure 3
presents an example of how the information provided by an IoT gateway, which implements JSON
over MQTT, is integrated into the platform.
Figure 3. Data model from Internet of Things (IoT) level to applications.
The element chosen was the device that analyses the water at the exit of the wastewater treatment
plant and determines the levels of turbidity and ph of the water. Once the entity is created in the
broker using the NGSI-LD data model, consumers can retrieve this information following two different
approaches: query or subscription.
The core of this platform is the NGSI-LD broker. It is an information broker that exposes an
HTTP REST API based on NGSI-LD for both registration and consultation, as well as a subscription/
notiﬁcation approach. This is the second point where interoperability is a signiﬁcant aspect. The use of
NGSI-LD provides various possible interactions with third-party platforms in both directions. One
of these solutions that has been integrated into the platform through the development of a connector
is MEGA [16]. The MEGA standard (ISO 21622) provides guidelines for the implementation of a
standardized model applied to irrigation that improves the speciﬁcation of irrigation schedules and
the control of the system requirements. Within this management layer, the stored information of each
entity is overwritten, with only the current state being kept; the information is stored in a nonrelational
database, MongoDB. This database contains data referring to infrastructure and information ﬂow,
as well as information about users and organizations. All this information is modeled using data
models that allow for the uniﬁcation of data structures using standards and also ensure the generality
necessary for the subsequent extensibility.
The last layer, Service, serves as an interface between users and the central layer to offer different
solutions to the problems that are generated in an agricultural operation, such as water management,
irrigation planning, data analytics, and monitoring of environmental parameters. The incorporation
Sensors 2020, 20, 1153
9 of 20
of other modules allows us to provide our solution with more capabilities due to the possibility of
integrating new components through connectors with NGSI-LD. The NGSI-LD interface is used to send
data updates and receive notiﬁcations about data changes. A change in the conﬁguration parameters
triggers control actions that are managed by subsystems at the user level. As a result of the use of
speciﬁc connectors, the information is consulted or notiﬁed to higher modules that are in charge of
propagating it for other interests, such as historical information, large-scale data management, or
integration with geographic information systems (GIS). For this purpose, a representational state
transfer interface (REST) is used, which applies NGSI-LD for communication between the ﬁnal
applications and the analysis modules.
3. Case Study in an Irrigation Community
This section validates our data model and the architecture of the platform. It was implemented in
an irrigation community where different systems, such as supervisory control and data acquisition
(SCADA), GIS systems, and sensors from different manufacturers, were integrated by the platform.
3.1. Scenario
Irrigation communities are corporations attached to basin organizations, which are responsible
for the management of the shared use of public common water. To this end, they relied on automatons
and speciﬁc irrigation systems for years, which were tightly coupled, allowing for full interaction
between the devices and the software, but avoiding any other possibility of interacting with third-party
devices and software applications.
The Miraﬂores irrigation community is located in the municipality of Jumilla (Murcia) [30] in
the Segura river basin and has almost 1000 community members. The area comprises about 1330 ha
of agricultural land, mostly devoted to woody crops and irrigated by localized irrigation. The main
crops produced are fruit trees, especially pear, peach, and apricot. The community uses surface water,
3.8 hm3 annually, and water from the Jumilla sewage plant, 1.5 hm3 annually. This treatment plant
delivers the reclaimed water at its exit, from where the community drives the available ﬂows to six
interconnected regulation rafts, with a total capacity of 1 hm3. The distribution network conducts
water from the rafts to the various irrigated farms, equipped with automatic ﬂow control counters and
setpoints, ensuring an average allocation of 4025 m3/ha/year/farm.
One of the main problems to be solved is the integration of the different technological elements
(SCADA, drawing software, independent sensors, and third-party services) that provide information
to the community in a single control point. The data from SCADA that are integrated into the platform
are shown in Table 1. The results derived from the water analysis conducted at least twice a month
were also integrated into the platform.

3.2. Equipment and Implementation
Figure 4 shows the general scheme that was followed to address the deployment of the platform.
The ﬁrst step was to channel water from the headwater reservoir, with its corresponding water analyses,
Sensors 2020, 20, 1153

to the agricultural plots. The plot is one of the key elements of the system. All the devices needed for
its deﬁnition are integrated using dataloggers and IoT connectors. Through this process, SCADA data
and the sensors that interact with the plot (soil moisture sensors, agricultural weather station, and
hydrants) are integrated into the systems. The information is transferred to the data model for later
visualization (using mobile or web applications) and analysis by the users of the irrigation community.
Figure 4. Layout of the case study.
The deployment involved the installation of controllers for monitoring, and remote control in
outdoor environments were provided by Odin Solutions [31]. The cost of implementing the platform
was reduced due to the open source feature of the platform. This feature decreased the budget needed
for dataloggers managing different devices or sensors in the platform. In this instance, the cost of
the chosen datalogger, IPex12, has an average price of around 600 euros (including conﬁguration
and installation) and varies according to the number of sensors integrated into the system. The main
characteristics of IPex12 are: 32-bit CPU and 4 MB of memory expandable with microSD, Ethernet,
USB, CAN, 3xRS232, 1xRS485, and 12 I/O ports, which can be conﬁgured by software as digital or
analogue input/outputs. It supports Third-generation Networks (3G), IPv6 over Low power Wireless
Personal Area Networks (6LowPAN), Sigfox, Narrow Band IoT (NB IoT), and LoRA. Each IPex12
is able to manage eight additional slaves I/O boards using CAN. The controllers are conﬁgured
effortlessly through their web server, which permits us to conﬁgure tasks independently from the
MQTT commands received from the cloud computing layer. IPex12 is specially designed for outdoor
settings such as the agricultural scenarios, since it is provided with water- and dust-proof enclosure.
It is provided with a battery and a solar panel.
The dataloggers have the ability to monitor sensor readings of soil conductivity, soil moisture,
soil temperature, water meter readings, and meteorological parameters, among others, and to operate
the solenoid valves to control the irrigation system.
The cloud server is a PowerEdge R7515 Server, with an AMD EPYC 7402 2.80 GHz, 32 GB of
RAM, and two solid state drives (SSD) of 480 GB each. It also runs the Ubuntu 18.04 LTS Server and
LibVirt/KVM. A single virtual machine was used here for the global broker, data saving, big data
Sensors 2020, 20, 1153

processes, and to host management with web services. The virtual machine uses 28 GB of memory and
400 GB of hard disk capacity. A good performance is possible at the moment, but given the ﬂexibility
of our architecture, more resources could be added by modifying or moving virtual images.
Once the different modules that form the platform were conﬁgured, the entities were deﬁned
in the broker so that their subscriptions could be made later. The broker manages subscriptions
to the creation or changes of entities. All these changes are stored in MongoDB, a nonrelational
JSON-LD object-based database, to provide fast and ﬂexible access to information. The speed of
processing is fundamental because, otherwise, a bottleneck is created that would slow down the rest of
the implementations.
To improve the data of the irrigation plots, the data model proposed in Section 2.1 was used
according to the needs proposed by the users of the irrigation community. A model instantiation was
constructed through NGSI-LD of an apricot tree plot where a soil moisture sensor was installed. The
soil moisture sensor is listed in Listing 1 and the crop is deﬁned in Listing 2.

4. Evaluation and Validation
This section describes the validation of the platform in a community of irrigators from three
different perspectives. The tests were conducted under a controlled environment with the equipment
described in Section 3.2.

4.1. Information Broker Evaluation
The main element of the platform is a NGSI-LD broker, which is responsible for storing all the
information as well as processing the different queries, answers, subscriptions, and the management
of the information providers. For this reason, an analysis was performed by selecting the following
metrics: CPU usage, memory consumed, and response times, according to the operations performed.
Firstly, different execution tests were conducted to check the platform ability to perform the
changes without losing the quality of service. The tests were performed with the same type of requests,
checking their response time in terms of both CPU and RAM. All tests were based on a one-minute
execution varying the number of simultaneous communications or connections with which it was
performed. Figure 5 shows the results of the tests of the behavior of the processor and the memory.
(a) CPU usage
(b) RAM usage
Figure 5. Evaluation of platform scalability.
Figure 5a shows that the CPU requirements increased by around 20% in the ﬁrst intervals (2, 4,
and 8 threads). From this moment on and up to 1024 threads, the CPU remained stable with average
values close to 90%. Figure 5b shows that the behavior in the use of the RAM remains practically stable
from the beginning to the end without altering the consumed resources. The increase in the use of the
RAM during the tests performed varied between 5% and 9%, values that are considered optimal.
The behaviour of the platform was evaluated based on the information distribution characteristic
that the broker had acquired. To this end, the response time obtained after performing various
operations on the different broker operating modes is analyzed; Table 2 shows the most signiﬁcant
values obtained in the tests. The graphs shown in Figure 6 show the times for the different modes:
entity management, subscription management, and context provider control.
•
The publication/subscription model enables the reduction of the number of queries because it is
not necessary to make periodic queries to receive updates to the data stored on the platform. The
creation time is longer since it has to be adjusted to the proposed data model;
•
The management of external context suppliers is a process that speeds up access to the information,
making the process more transparent for the ﬁnal client. The broker’s mission is to act as a proxy
between the client and the context provider. For this reason, search and consultation times are
shorter compared with the rest of the operations.

4.2. Evaluation of Platform Usage
This section provides an evaluation of the response times of the platform based on the three layers
that form its architecture. Figure 7 shows the times obtained for the system after the execution of
100 requests. Figure 7a shows the notiﬁcation times at its two levels: at MQTT level (MQTT broker
notiﬁes the IoT Agent) and at NGSI-LD broker level. The times of the Information Management Layer are
longer, with an average of 21.69 s, since all the semantic enrichment provided by the use of the data
model is performed in the database (MongoDB). However, in exchange for this increase in time, it is
possible to have all the relevant information of the irrigation community homogenized and integrated
into a single point. Figure 7b shows the system’s capabilities in terms of performance management.
The graph shows that if the device is connected, the response time is less than if it is not; the average
response time of 31.18 ms is considered low.

4.3. Use of the Platform at the Agricultural Level
Data interoperability is of critical importance. Here, the proposed solution (data model and
platform) provides the necessary data translation mechanisms by combining the use of a data model
together with standardized solutions, such as those provided through NGSI-LD. This proposal enables
the integration of multiple systems/devices or data sources, resulting in an open and interoperable data
integration model according to the changing requirements of farms. The use of data models contributes
to obtaining performance indicators, decision making, and sharing data with different farms.
Figure 8 shows the evolution of irrigation before the platform was installed. The analysis of
the data revealed the irregularity of the irrigation system. To have a continuous and homogeneous
irrigation system, we deemed it necessary to deﬁne irrigation thresholds provided by the agricultural
technicians. As the ﬁeld capacity and the wilt point determine the maximum and minimum limits of the
soil humidity that can be used by the crops, we concluded that the amount of water between these
two values is the functional water or humidity available to the plant. Once the community technicians
deﬁned the limits for the crops, tests were conducted on an apricot tree plot to evaluate the irrigation
efﬁciency: the ﬁrst as soon as the platform was deployed (between March and April), and another after
improving the irrigation programming based on the results of the ﬁrst test (between June and July).
Figure 8. Evolution of the humidity of an apricot crop based on set water levels.
Once the ﬁrst test was analyzed, Figure 8, we found that during irrigation, two critical zones
were generated, A and B, with extreme peaks that were outside the recommended limits, indicating
Sensors 2020, 20, 1153
17 of 20
that water use was not efﬁcient, thus a scarce resource was being wasted. Zone A indicates that root
asphyxiation was produced (a limitation of the capacity of the plants to breathe through the roots)
in the crop by excess water; Zone B indicates that the plant does not have ability to supply itself
with water, consequently reducing the quality of the production of the crop. Once the maximum and
minimum thresholds are set, rules can be deﬁned for efﬁcient irrigation. When the thresholds are
exceeded or not reached, the platform generates notiﬁcations to users through the mobile application.
These rules can also be associated with the activation of digital inputs for the start-up of any device
that improves irrigation efﬁciency.
As a result of the use of the platform and the analysis of the data obtained, and with the help of
an agricultural technician, the relevant irrigation limits are established or adjusted. In addition, other
useful parameters can be established, such as the root network, the type of soil, or the disposition of
the probes. Once the irrigation programming was changed, Figure 9 shows that the irrigation was
efﬁciently applied. The water contributions and vertical column are in line with the humidity curves,
showing stable and uniform sharing. By controlling the hydrants and applying ﬁlters based on the
limits set, irrigation was controlled to maintain the humidity within the desired parameters, or to
inform of possible alerts to activate programmed irrigation to avoid a reduction in production.
Figure 9.
Evolution of efﬁcient irrigation, comparing soil moisture and water contribution by
the hydrant.
The versatility of the platform is stressed by the ability to export selected data for further
processing or study, as shown in Figures 8 and 9 using the export to CSV option.
5. Conclusions
This work demonstrated the importance of interoperability in the ﬁeld of agriculture, water
management, and irrigation systems. Herein, an interoperable and open platform is presented which
is capable of integrating heterogeneous data sources at the IoT level to aid and improve the decision
making in a community of irrigators. The platform enables the integration of controllers and sensors
from different manufacturers, and thus represents a unique access point for all this information.
As such, improving the techniques used in the agricultural sector is possible, thereby sustainably
obtaining higher economic, environmental, and social yields. As a result of its interoperable nature,
the platform can be combined with other systems to expand its range of services. The interoperability
Sensors 2020, 20, 1153
18 of 20
aspect was tested in a real-world context where successful integration with other systems already
deployed in the facilities of the irrigation community was possible thanks to this characteristic. The
platform integrates different protocols at the IoT level, such as MQTT, CoAP, LoRa, SigFox, and HTTP.
They transport the information following different data formats. Nevertheless, a set of them promote
interoperability, such as Lightweight Machine to Machine (LWM2M), JSON, and UltraLight. These
representation formats were adopted by the presented platform as to facilitate its integration into IoT
devices, making use of this technology. The agents of the IoT backend of our platform perform the
adaptation of this information to the NGSI-LD interface and data model. After analyzing the obtained
results in the community of irrigators, the following conclusions were obtained:
1.
A homogeneous data model was proposed that meets the speciﬁc needs of agriculture, such
as efﬁcient water management. This model was validated on the platform using an NGSI-LD
broker. The application of this model in an irrigation community provides its managers with the
capacity to manage the agronomic information and its relationship with the devices that provide
information to improve irrigation water;
2.
The platform was validated using metrics to check its behavior. Firstly, the scalability of the main
component, the NGSI-LD broker, was analyzed based on the average use of the CPU (83.21%) and
memory (56.39%). At the latency level, measures were recorded on the most relevant operations
of the broker, highlighting among them the average time, 510.28 ms, of the creation of a context
provider. The platform was validated as a whole, showing the time delay from the moment the
device receives the information and when it is received by the platform (2.97 s); and from the
moment the action is performed (31.17 ms);
3.
At the user level, the platform was validated in several apricot tree plots, improving the
management of the water used. This improvement was achieved because of the deﬁnition
of optimal irrigation thresholds for each crop and by generating ﬁlter notiﬁcations that, under
certain conditions, allow the hydrants to be adjusted, thus enabling efﬁcient water use.
In the future, the speed of computing and latency should be compared by replicating the platform
in edge computing with current cloud computing to detect which one provides better performance and
response times. One of these involves the processing of satellite images. At the plot level, this feature
will monitor the main characteristics of the crop with applications based on remote sensors. This new
attribute will focus on the diagnosis, management, and control of irrigation. Currently, this feature
uses images of the Sentinel 2 satellite, which is more focused on agricultural issues, but soon the PAZ
satellite (the ﬁrst Spanish radar earth observation satellite, which is included within the National Earth
Observation Programme) will be used. Another future line of research is the development of a data
analysis module that will allow us to cross check and analyze the history of the data acquired. This
will generate better results in agricultural management, increase productivity, and reduce expenses,
such as by reducing the consumption of water, nutrients, and phytosanitary products.

can decide before every irrigation schedule, based on the 
prediction to what extent the crops can be irrigated. If chances of 
rain are very low 90% irrigation can be carried out, If chances of 
rain are predicted as low to medium then 40 to 60% irrigation

I. 
INTRODUCTION 
The agriculture industry is the backbone of the Indian 
economy, accounting for roughly 15% of national GDP 
and about half of India's population is entirely or partially 
reliant on agriculture and related activities for their living. 
India is one of the top 15 agricultural commodity exporters in 
the world. India is also facing an exponential population 
growth that demands a great need for food in the future. 
Traditional agricultural practices, on the other hand, must be 
modified with the help of technology to meet the increasing 
demand for good quality food to meet the future need of the 
population. Agriculture development will benefit not just 
farmers, but also a huge portion of the people living in rural 
areas that are actively involved in agriculture or indirectly tied 
to agriculture as consumers. More efficient production 
methods would produce a more conjugative environment in 
the country for the overall development of the economy and 
greater agricultural income. Small and marginal farmers will 
be empowered via education, reforms, and development, 
resulting in better, more efficient, and stronger Indian 
agriculture. New production and marketing models, as well as 
raising awareness and providing education to farmers in 
villages, will aid in the sector's development and, more 
crucially, improve the economic situation of impoverished 
farmers [1]. 
Precision agriculture is the most promising approach to 
farm management in today's era, as it uses technology Internet 
of Things (IoT) to monitor the spatial and temporal parameters 
of the field and ensures that input resources such as water, 
fertilizers, pesticides, and other chemicals are applied to the 
crops at the right time, in the right place, and the right amount. 
Traditional agricultural surveillance tactics were modified by 
IoT-based agriculture applications, which quickly provided 
quantitative data with great temporal and spatial resolution. 
Ecological data is collected in real-time from the surroundings 
of the agriculture field using various sensors installed in the 
fields, which will be communicated and analyzed to determine 
various problems. This collected data is analyzed and 
processed to extract the proper information and is utilized to 
decide on various tasks performed in the field to automate the 
agriculture 
process 
to 
overcome 
certain 
difficulties. 
Multidisciplinary methods that combine remote sensing, 
modelling, and deep learning techniques can aid in the 
improvement of agricultural operations and, as a result, crop 
output [2]. 
Collecting data manually from a big field is challenging, 
and it results in fluctuation when compared to inaccurate field 
measurements. Wireless sensor networks (WSN) help in 
integrating various sensors in the field for the collection of 
different parameters from the field and environment. Various 
farm monitoring applications like crop selection according to 
the soil in the farm, soil monitoring to make zones with 
similarity to promote multi cropping and to assist farmers with 
various decision making like when and in what amount of 
fertilizer to be used, when to irrigate the crop, early disease 
predictions etc. are possible due to several emerging 
technologies like WSN, Deep learning, Machine learning, IoT 
etc. 
Agriculture utilizes 85 percent of the world's available 
freshwater resources, and this fraction is progressively rising 
in parallel with population expansion and rising food demand. 
As a result, there is a need to develop more efficient methods 
to ensure that water resources are properly utilized in 
irrigation. New innovative plans in this direction are needed in

research to boost productivity and water management through 
novel irrigation techniques [3]. 
Proper irrigation aids in the growth of crops, landscape 
maintenance, and revegetation of disturbed soils. In addition 
to frost protection, weed suppression in grain fields, and soil 
consolidation prevention, irrigation plays important role in 
healthy crop cultivation. Irrigation management is required 
even in places with abundant rainfall to boost farm 
productivity. Monsoon gaps are a feature of Indian rainfall. As 
a result, sometimes it won't rain for two or more weeks during 
the rainy season, causing agricultural damage in the absence 
of irrigation. 
In the near future, proper integration of advanced 
agricultural practices based on various technologies and 
adaptation by rural communities should be secured. Climate 
change will have extensive consequences in the next decades. 
As a result, laws, and practices must be devised to protect 
farming communities, particularly small landholders, from the 
immediate losses caused by extreme events [4]. 
The most important reasons for India's need for perfect 
irrigation are: 
 Chaotic nature of climate. 
 Uneven Rainfall Distribution. 
 Optimized use of water resources to meet crop needs 
and soil requirements. 
 To maximize crop production. 
 To manage supplement supply even in areas with 
abundant rainfall. 
Irrigation scheduling is managed by rainfall forecast based 
on weather conditions, which determines the amount of water 
to be supplied by irrigation to maintain the threshold value of 
water (moisture) required by the crop at any given time. 
Automatic irrigation scheduling systems have replaced 
manual irrigation based on soil water monitoring. While 
implementing, the plant evapotranspiration was taken into 
account, which was based on many climatic characteristics 
such as humidity, wind speed, solar radiation, and even crop 
aspects such as stage of growth, plant density, soil attributes, 
and pest. 
Weather forecasting does an excellent job of providing 
people with early warnings and alerts about severe climate 
change events, however, due to a lack of infrastructure, people 
in remote regions such as villages do not receive information 
on time due to the absence of internet, and forecasting is not 
very accurate for any given location. As a result, this portable 
device may be taken anywhere and used to anticipate the state 
of rainfall by sensing current atmospheric characteristics and 
present sky status to identify clouds related to rainfall. 
Most of the farmers are living in rural areas and are not 
able to access the internet and weather forecasting applications 
at remote locations like fields. This article presents a portable 
weather station that uses a novel approach that predicts the 
intensity of rainfall as No Rain to very Low Rain, Low to 
Medium Rain or, Medium to high Rain based on the combined 
approach of identifying types of clouds present in the sky and 
some important weather parameters such as temperature, 
humidity, and atmospheric pressure using affordable sensors 
that are within the reach of farmers and will work 
independently of WIFI or internet. 
This device consists of Raspberry pi with an integrated 
camera for taking digital images of the sky to know the type of 
clouds present in the sky along with some atmospheric 
parameter sensors like DHT11 sensor, BMP 180 etc. to sense 
temperature, humidity, and atmospheric pressure and will give 
the prediction on rainfall by both approach from cloud status 
and sensed atmospheric parameters. Improvement in crop 
production and planning by using local climate prediction 
without the internet can definitely help an individual farmer to 
increase his yield by managing the irrigation cycle by 
avoiding irrigating the crop with extra water or less water. 
A. Novelty 
The proposed work is distinguished from previous work by 
its multi-modal integration of two separate techniques. The 
majority of previous research has proposed solutions in 
irrigation management by providing automatic irrigation based 
on either atmospheric parameters collected from nearby 
weather stations / using sensors or only by capturing sky 
images, but the proposed system takes advantage of both 
approaches where real-time atmospheric parameters on the 
fields are sensed using sensors and the sky image at that 
location is captured to provide better rainfall predictions 
without using WIFI or internet so that it can be used by 
farmers or people at remote locations. Due to the global 
shortage of clean water resources, it is critical that they be 
utilised to their full capacity, which may be accomplished by 
utilising water resources wisely and paying equal attention to 
irrigation water management. This device will help farmers to 
take decision before every irrigation scheduled cycle to what 
extent the field should be irrigated by predicting the intensity 
of rainfall as low, medium or high. 
The rest of the article is arranged as follows: Section 2 
describes relevant work, Section 3 discusses the proposed 
system in detail, Section 4 discusses methods and 
methodology, Section 5 discusses findings, and Section 6 
discusses conclusion and future work. 
II. RELATED WORK 
Weather conditions play an important role in both 
irrigation requirements and crop performance. Researchers 
used various weather parameters and different technologies 
and algorithms to predict the weather to know the status of 
climate to control the use of water in Irrigation. 
The evapotranspiration of water in the soil is affected by 
temperature and humidity. The thermic level of the 
atmosphere is described as air temperature, which is generally 
measured in Celsius, Fahrenheit, or Kelvin degrees. It is the 
most closely observed weather metric. The presence of water 
vapour in the air is known as humidity. The proportion of 
water vapour in the air is expressed in percentage (%). The 
other major parameters considered by the researchers are 
luminosity and is defined as the brightness or intensity of 
light. Lux is the unit of measurement. It causes more water

loss from the soil as the temperature rises with the direct solar 
radiation. The most important parameter is the rainfall or 
amount of precipitation that influences whether or not 
irrigation is necessary as well as the amount of water to be 
used if irrigation is required. The author in [5] presents a 
detailed survey on the IoT systems and recent sensors used in 
an automatic smart irrigation system in Precision Agriculture 
and discussed various weather monitoring parameters, sensors, 
soil characteristics. The author in [6] proposed an automated 
irrigation system which starts the motor and water is supplied 
only if the level of soil moisture goes below the threshold and 
the amount of water supply is managed by considering the 
weather parameters temperature and humidity sensed by the 
sensor to predict the type of climate as sunny (no rain), cloudy 
(rain chances <50%) or rainy (rain chances>50%). In [7] to 
add intelligence to the existing idea of automatic irrigation 
systems, an autonomous irrigation system is proposed that 
employs machine learning and predictive algorithms to predict 
the status of rainfall using historical climate data for the 
amount of water to be used by calculating the time of motor to 
be ON based on the soil moisture value for each zone 
separately. Work proposed in [8] is the development of an 
efficient IoT architecture that monitors soil, microclimate, and 
water parameters, as well as performing proper irrigation 
management based on challenges studied in irrigated farmland 
of Ethiopia, Kenya, and South Africa. For educated decision 
making and effective operation of the irrigation management 
system, indigenous agricultural and expert knowledge, local 
climate information, particular features of crop and soil are 
provided to the system. Broadband connection and cloud 
services are either unavailable or too costly in Sub-Saharan 
Africa. To overcome these constraints, data processing, 
network administration, irrigation choices, and farmer 
communication are all done locally, with no back-end servers 
involved. In the article [9] the technique was evaluated using 
five crops at four European sites with varying weather 
circumstances to optimize irrigation water consumption by 
taking into consideration soil water availability, local weather 
predictions, crop physiological condition, and water demands 
in real-time. Main observations are the major effect of 
inaccurate predictions of the forecast, unless the target yield 
was excessively high, was that the target yield was not 
attained, but the irrigation schedule stayed near to optimum, 
according to the data. In other words, while the actual yield 
did not match the objective, just a little amount of irrigation 
water was lost. In [10] author proposed an idea to automate 
the irrigation process to manage the motor's pumping by 
taking into account the soil moisture content and rainfall 
forecast. Soil moisture data is continuously sensed using a soil 
moisture sensor and is sent to raspberry pi and depends upon 
the value a rainfall prediction is obtained from Openweather 
API to decide on irrigating the field or not and the Android 
Application is used to track the complete irrigation process for 
the agricultural field. The article [11] effectively shows a 
simple, low-cost, and somewhat accurate system for 
monitoring current meteorological conditions and forecasting 
rain. This system has a significant benefit over comparable 
Arduino-based weather monitoring systems in that it also 
provides rain probability at the current moment using weather 
parameters namely temperature, humidity, light intensity, and 
wind conditions. The goal of this study [12] was to provide a 
way for a reliable irrigation system based on a suitable rainfall 
forecast algorithm. The new approach, which is Romyan's 
method is introduced to calculate water requirement for crops, 
as well as the time necessary for the motor to be turned on. 
The author in [13] presents a technique for high-accuracy 
rainfall forecasting that combines two types of data i.e., cloud 
imaging data and humidity as an atmospheric parameter in 
numerical form. Convolution Neural Network is used for 
image recognition by extracting important features using 
ResNet. In this research, a novel network is built that 
combines the cloud picture with other meteorological 
information and creates the result, to forecast rainfall with 
greater accuracy than the existing ResNet image recognition 
alone. 
A comparison of the existing and proposed work based on 
the parameters and technology along with methods and 
methodologies used are shown in Table I. The comparative 
analysis of the previous research work has revealed that most 
of the models used either atmospheric parameters or cloud 
images for the prediction of rainfall and only one paper 
proposed a system using a combined approach but using only 
one parameter as humidity. However, after researching 
existing systems it is clear that the combined approach of two 
modalities to predict rainfall gives more clarity and would be 
very useful. In this regard, the system proposed uses a 
multisource data approach that combines predictions from 
digital cloud images and atmospheric parameters to provide an 
improved rainfall prediction system.

The suggested system addresses the optimal integration of 
different sensing modalities as well as their practical 
execution. Additionally, machine learning approaches and 
deep learning architectures are applied to the different inputs 
and the final decision is provided by combining the output 
from both approaches to predict rainfall and gives an 
appropriate decision on the amount of irrigation to be done. In 
comparison to current procedures, the suggested approach has 
presented a technology-based solution that would be 
beneficial to the agricultural and scientific communities in 
terms of its portability and use of edge analytics where input is 
processed and output is given at the device level only without 
cloud platforms, internet or WiFi. 
III. PROPOSED SYSTEM 
The study of clouds and their characteristics is crucial for a 
wide range of applications. It's been utilized to produce 
precise weather forecasts via nowcasting. There exist many 
clouds in the sky but only a few clouds are responsible for 
rain. Identification of rainclouds can be done using image 
classification with the help of deep learning on a ground-based 
image cloud dataset. To make the predictions more accurate 
the atmospheric parameters like temperature, humidity, 
atmospheric pressure is taken into account which can be easily 
sensed by the sensors and are affordable. The results from 
both approaches are combined and the final output is given as 
the prediction on the rainfall as No rain, Low to Medium rain, 
or heavy rain as shown in Fig. 1 as a multi-modal proposed 
system on basis of which many agriculture-related activities 
can be carried out like managing irrigation by taking in 
account the status and intensity of rainfall. 
A. Components used  
1) BMP180: BMP180 is a barometric sensor with an I2C 
(―Wire‖) interface, used to measure pressure surrounding it 
and altitude. It is also used to measure temperature. It works 
on push sensor BMP180 and can measure the pressure in the 
range of 300 to 1100 hPa with relative pressure error to 0.12 
hPa (1m height). The BMP180 outputs absolute pressure 
in pascals (Pa). By observing variations in pressure short-term 
weather changes can be predicted. Dropping pressure, for 
example, frequently indicates the arrival of rain or a storm (a 
low-pressure system is moving in). When the pressure rises, it 
usually signals that clear weather is on the way (a high-
pressure system is moving through). 
2) DHT11 sensor is a basic and commonly used to record 
temperature and humidity from the atmosphere in the digital 
form. This sensor utilizes a thermistor and a capacitive 
humidity sensor to detect the surrounding air. To monitor 
humidity and temperature instantly, it may be simply 
interfaced with any microcontroller such as Arduino, 
Raspberry Pi, and so on. 
3) Raspberry Pi 4: Raspberry Pi 4 is the latest model and 
is a tiny processor or a controller with great processing power 
integrated with Broadcom 2711, 64-bit quad-core Cortex-A72 
processor and is available with 1 GB, 2 GB, or 4 GB RAM. It 
features a true gigabit Ethernet port, 2 x USB 3.0 "Super-
Speed" ports which can be used to attach mouse and keyboard. 
It comes as a size of the credit card so is portable and easy to 
carry. New version comes with a combination of small 
footprint, low-power drop, customization and amazing 
community support and the pi can be used in several. 
4) USB camera: Logitech HD webcam c270 has a USB 
interface that makes it easy to connect and has 3-megapixel 
image resolution along with superb color-rich imaging even in 
ultra-low light with HD support. 
5) OLED Display Screen: To display the output as the 
atmospheric parameters along with the status of rainfall and 
the decision based on the rainfall is displayed on an OLED 
display screen. The OLED display screen is very thin and 
light-weighted with a size of 0.96 inches comes with a 
resolution of 128X64. It has 4 pins named VCC: 3.3-5V GND: 
Ground SCL: Serial Clock SDA: Serial Data to carry out I2C 
communication. 
6) Basic Shield: Basic Shield is a component provided 
with 8 LED's, 2 push buttons and is very popular for 
interfacing electronics components like a push button, 
potentiometer, LDR, buzzer, etc. and can be easily connected 
with 5 V/3.3 V microcontrollers.

B. Working Principle of the Device 
The Device consists of Raspberry Pi 4 Model B and 
components DHT 11, BMP 180, OLED display screen, USB 
camera, and Basic-Shield are connected to the respective pins. 
Power is provided to Raspberry Pi using a power bank with a 
C-Type cable to make the device portable. The work is shown 
in Fig. 2. Sensors sense the atmospheric parameters like 
temperature denoted by T, Humidity denoted by H, and 
Pressure is denoted by P. Once power is supplied to the device 
the code snippet for collecting sensor data will start and will 
get displayed on the screen after regular intervals. To start the 
Rain prediction push-button b1 needs to press. Once b1 is 
pressed camera will start and the video will be captured, so the 
camera should be faced towards the sky to get the proper 
input, which is fed as input to deep learning model at the same 
time machine learning code will also be executed by giving 
values T, H, and P as input parameters. 
IV. METHODS AND TECHNOLOGY 
A. Irrigation Scheduling 
Irrigation scheduling is critical for ensuring that crops 
receive the right quantity of water at the right time to 
minimize crop water stress and optimize output [15]. Water 
stress can affect vegetable crops in two ways: when there is a 
lack of water (drought stress) or when there is an abundance 
of water (water stress) caused due to waterlogging or soil 
water saturation. A water deficit occurs when water is 
supplied at the wrong time or insufficiently, reducing the 
amount of water available to plants in the soil. Long durations 
of irrigation or high-water application rates can produce 
excess soil moisture, wasting water and causing nutrient loss. 
Crop water stress can also have an impact on crop 
management. Wilting occurs when soil moisture falls below a 
certain level, preventing plants from drawing water into their 
roots. Furthermore, in low moisture circumstances, any 
moisture-activated herbicides and nutrients would not be 
efficiently used by plants. Presently, many different 
approaches are adopted for irrigation scheduling as listed in 
Table II to optimize the water application to crops. These 
methods are ranked according to the level of management 
required for water application [16]. Irrigation scheduling is 
different for a different crop at every growth stage and must 
be followed to optimize the crop yield and the use of water.

"Feel and appearance" method 
The irrigation manager decides the amount of water to be applied and when by observing the soil sample and 
assessment is done by comparing it with the soil reference images. 
2 
Systematic method 
Regardless of considering weather or soil water conditions, the application of water is done based on the amount 
or time. 
3 
Crop water demand method 
The amount of water applied is determined by the crop's evapotranspiration (ETc). This strategy involves 
calendar-based scheduling based on prior seasons and should take into account rainy days. 
4 
Soil water status method 
Water is supplied to the crop root system based on soil moisture levels, usually by giving a proportion of soil 
accessible water. Rainfall occurrences should be taken into consideration with this technique. 
5 
Water budgeting method 
Water application is dependent on crop evapotranspiration, soil moisture content at the root level, and water 
budgeting. 
The first method is completely traditional and requires 
human interventions and results in lots of water wastage in 
terms of irrigation as management was not done properly and 
no parameters are considered. The second and third methods 
considered soil parameters and timings as well as an amount 
for application of water which reduced the water wastage but 
may result in water stress as no weather conditions are 
considered. The last three methods are improved and make use 
of technology by considering various parameters like soil 
moisture content and rainfall events to plan the irrigation 
scheduling thus optimizing the use of water resources. From 
the above table, we can see that Irrigation scheduling is very 
important to optimize the water application thus by improving 
the yields and rainfall is one such important factor that must 
be taken into account to protect the crop from the application 
of excess water thus improving the Irrigation Management 
system. 
B. Internet of Things (IoT) 
Every element of traditional farming processes may be 
substantially altered by incorporating the newest sensor and 
IoT technology into agricultural practices. Currently, Wireless 
sensors and the Internet of Things (IoT) are being integrated 
into smart agriculture and are capable of taking agriculture 
sector to next level. Soil, humidity, wetness, light, air 
temperature, CO2, solar energy sensors, and a variety of other 
IoT sensors are all employed in agriculture. Sensors, which 
are placed across the fields, on smart agriculture vehicles, in 
IoT-based monitoring systems, and weather stations, collect 
data in real-time and give farmers visibility and control over 
their activities. Fig. 3 shows the basic architecture of IoT.

IoT architecture consists of various hardware components 
like sensors as per the requirement to sense the data from 
surroundings 
which 
requires 
software 
and 
various 
communication technologies to exchange the data among the

activities.

Fig. 4. IoT Components and Technologies. 
Today we have clouds like Thingspeak, IBM Watson 
specifically for IoT along with general-purpose cloud 
platforms (AWS Amazon, Google, Cisco). Once the data is 
stored it is analyzed with analytical tools like keras, 
Tensorflow, OpenCV is libraries with very powerful functions 
and finally, the information retrieved after analysis of data is 
used for various applications. 
C. Edge Analytics 
Sensors are used to collect data from the environment or 
surroundings and Actuators are the devices that will take 
action based on the output of processed data. If the Analytics 
is performed at the device level that concept is called Edge 
Analytics. Only data for storage is sent to the cloud. If 
analytics is done in the cloud, then it is called cloud analytics. 
This experiment used DHT11 and bmp180 sensors to sense 
temperature, Relative humidity, and atmospheric pressure, and 
the data is fed to a machine learning algorithm (pickle file) to

get the status of rainfall based on these real-time parameters. 
Along with it, raspberry pi is integrated with a digital camera 
to capture the image of the sky at that location, and the image 
is given as the input to the deep learning model (.h5 file) to get 
the status of rainfall based on the types of clouds present in the 
sky at that time. The processing is done in Raspberry pi and 
the predictions are displayed on the screen attached to it. This 
proposed device uses Edge analytics to give output as the 
processing is done at device level and does not depend on 
WIFI or internet. The cloud can be used to just store the data 
collected by the sensor only when Wi-Fi is available. The cost 
of data storage and management is reduced using edge 
analytics. It also saves operational costs, bandwidth 
requirements, and time spent on data analysis. Despite the 
widespread use of internet-connected gadgets, connection 
problems persist due to the unavailability of the internet or 
limited network access. Edge analytics guards against possible 
network failures by ensuring that applications aren't hampered 
by internet issues or limited network access [17]. This is 
especially beneficial in rural regions (remote locations) or 
when trying to save communication expenses with costly 
technologies like cellular. 
D. Deep Learning 
Clouds are crucial in climate forecasting. Rainfall 
forecasting is also heavily influenced by the state and kinds of 
clouds in the sky. CNN model is used with transfer learning to 
classify clouds based on their features like texture, color, etc. 
to know the type of cloud and rainfall can be predicted using 
the precipitation associated with that cloud. Ground-based 
cloud images are readily available compared to satellite cloud 
images and provides information about the local atmosphere 
by analyzing bottom-level features of clouds like cloud height, 
cloud type, and cloud cover [18]. Rain clouds are mainly 
classified as Cirrus, Stratus, and Cumulus [19] and the main 
clouds are shown in Fig. 5. 
The proposed device is provided with 8 megapixels digital 
camera integrated into Raspberry-pi to capture live sky images 
at any location by clicking a button on the device to activate 
the device. A cloud image is given as input to the convolution 
neural network (CNN) and the SoftMax activation function is 
used to classify the cloud into No Rain to very Low Rain, Low 
to Medium rain, or Medium to High Rain based on the amount 
of precipitation associated with each cloud. According to the 
Precipitation and the amount of Rainfall as shown in Table III, 
all cloud images are classified into three classes or groups. 
The operation of the deep learning model as shown in 
Fig. 6 where the weights of the pretrained model are 
downloaded first, followed by freezing of all the layers except 
the top layer, which is used for classification in the fresh 
dataset, and finally the training of the model. All of the layers 
are unfrozen for fine-tuning, and the model is trained on a new 
dataset with a very low learning rate. Once trained, the model 
was able to accurately predict the outcome. All three pre-
trained models, VGG16, Inception-V3, and Xception, follow 
the identical flow and concluded with The Xception model 
gives better accuracy to predict Rainfall based on cloud 
images taken from the ground, giving output whether Rain or 
little Rain or medium Rain or high Rain as compared to VGG 
16 and Inception-V3. Rain Prediction using deep learning on 
ground-based cloud images using transfer learning, is 
presented in [20]. 
E. Machine Learning  
To support the rain prediction model based on cloud 
images, atmospheric parameters are also considered which 
also plays vital role in determining the rainfall. Temperature, 
humidity, and pressure in the atmosphere fluctuate rapidly, 
causing instability in the atmosphere, which can result in rain, 
storms, and even lightning and thunder. The most significant 
elements in predicting precipitation are temperature and 
humidity [21]. Air pressure, dewpoint temperature (or relative 
humidity), wind speed, and cloud cover are four more 
meteorological factors that are substantially connected to 
rainfall [22]. But as the device is portable so only the most 
important variables are chosen for the experiments which are 
temperature, relative humidity, and air pressure that can be 
sensed with affordable sensors and are sufficient to predict the 
status of the rainfall.

Fig. 6. Working of Deep Learning Model. 
Rainfall intensity is classified according to the rate of 
precipitation, which depends on the considered time. The 
following categories are used to classify rainfall intensity [23]: 
 Low rain — when the precipitation rate is < 2.5 mm 
(0.098 in) per hour 
 Medium rain — when the precipitation rate is between 
2.5 mm (0.098 in) and 7.6 mm (0.30 in) or 10 mm 
(0.39 in) per hour  
 High rain — when the precipitation rate is > 7.6 mm 
(0.30 in) per hour, or between 10 mm (0.39 in) and 
50 mm (2.0 in) per hour 
 Very High rain — when the precipitation rate is > 
50 mm (2.0 in) per hour 
Here also the data is classified in the same categories as in 
cloud dataset as No Rain to Very Low Rain, Low to Medium 
Rain, and Medium to Heavy Rain based on the precipitation 
rate. 
The data is collected for the city of Hyderabad, Telangana, 
from Nasa Power Data viewer for Daily data, which contains 
various climatic parameters, but only the most significant ones 
are picked, and the data is collected over a 40-year period 
from 1981 to May 2021. Because there are an average of 64-
65 rainy days each year, collecting sufficient data over a long 
period of time is required. The dataset contains many 
attributes (columns), but for this experiment, the independent 
variables are Temperature, Relative Humidity, and Pressure, 
and the dependent variable is Condition, which is labelled in 
three categories based on precipitation: No rain to very low 
rain, Low to medium rain, and Medium to high rain. Various 
steps carried out to train the model from collecting dataset to 
cleaning of the dataset, balancing the dataset, feature 
extraction, and then partitioning of the dataset into train and 
test sets as shown in Fig. 7. After that various classification 
models are applied on the training set to train the model on 
selected parameters then the performance is analyzed by 
calculating the accuracy based on the predictions from the test 
dataset. 
It has been observed, that among all individual machine 
learning models RandomForest and KNN gave a good 
prediction as compared to others. Logistic regression and 
SVM also performed well while predicting the values but 
Decision Tree and Naïve Byes performance was poor in 
estimating the predictions compared to other models as shown 
in Fig. 8. For evaluating the machine learning models a very 
effective technique called K-FOLD CROSS VALIDATION is 
used where the model is tested on part of the dataset which 
was not used for training. In this experiment, value of k is set 
to 5 in the K-fold cross-validation technique to check the 
accuracy attained by various models used. Although 
predictions from stacking Ensemble are better than voting, the 
calculation time is three times that of individual machine 
learning models. As a result, the RandomForest classifier was 
chosen to implement in hardware since it is faster and has 
similar accuracy to Stacking Ensemble.

F. Device Setup 
All the components are connected to Raspberry Pi as 
shown in Fig. 9. The screen displayed the currently sensed 
parameter values when the power is given to the device. 
No internet or WIFI module is used in this device and the 
power can be given by the power bank to make the portable 
device so that it can be carried to any location. Logitech USB 
Camera is used to capture the video of the sky which will be 
divided into continuous image frames and given as input to the 
Deep learning model to get the rainfall prediction based on the 
clouds present in the sky. Data sensed by the DHT11 sensor 
and BMP180 i.e. temperature, humidity, and pressure is given 
as input to the machine learning model. The predicted rainfall 
from both the models is displayed on the OLED screen and 
the final decision for the amount of irrigation is also displayed 
on the screen. Based on the output the motor can be switched 
ON to irrigate the land for the appropriate amount of water 
based on the decision given. The instrument is tested and 
found to give very correct predictions based on both 
approaches. This rainfall system would be very much useful in 
many agricultural events where the rainfall prediction needs to 
be considered. Prediction is given based on two different 
models where atmospheric parameters and clouds both are 
considered. The most important is this device works without 
the internet only power is needed. The device can also be used 
only 
to 
monitor 
individual 
atmospheric 
parameters 
temperature, humidity, or pressure which can be used to make 
a decision on food storage, or crop harvesting.

Fig. 9. Device Setup. 
G. Tools and Libraries used 
To execute the Deep learning model Debian GNU/Linux 
(64 bit) aarch 64(beta version) is installed which is a free and 
open-source operating. Debian GNU/Linux is a unique 
software distribution that combines Debian's philosophy and 
methodology with GNU tools, the Linux kernel, and other key 
free software to make aarch 64. Because of its technical 
brilliance and profound dedication to the requirements and 
aspirations of the Linux community, Debian is especially 
popular among expert users. The Deep Learning model and 
machine learning models were trained on python 3 so all the 
supporting libraries with the required versions Keras – 2.4.3, 
Tensor Flow-2.4.0-rc2, Scikitlearn-0.20.2, and OpenCV -4.5.3 
are installed. 
V. RESULT 
Some of the screenshots of output are shown in Fig. 10. 
Here in the display screen T denotes Temperature, H denotes 
Humidity and P denotes Pressure sensed by the sensor and are 
displayed as soon as Raspberry Pi starts. The Value of T, H, 
and P keeps on displaying on the screen. When button b1 is 
pressed its status changed from 1 to 0 and the rain prediction 
model starts by starting the camera to capture the sky image 
and is given as input to the deep learning and T, H, and P 
values are passed to the machine learning model. P1 denotes 
output from deep learning (i.e. from clouds) and P2 denotes 
output from machine learning (i.e. from Parameters). 
The device is tested in the open space in residential area by 
powering it with the USB power bank as the Raspberry Pi 
requires a 5volt input voltage, which is provided via the USB 
type-C connection. The input voltage should actually be a 
little higher than 5 volts. Because power losses occur in the 
connectors and wires of the circuit's transmission, 5.1–5.2 
Volts would be optimum. The results obtained as the intensity 
of rainfall were compared with the open weather API for the 
same day and time and found that the device prediction gives 
70-75% accurate results which will be really helpful in many 
areas that require instant information on the rain at particular 
location and time. The device must be operated in open space 
and camera should be kept facing towards the sky to capture 
the cloud images. Device can be used as many times by 
rotating the facing of camera to capture sky in all directions.

VI. CONCLUSION AND FUTURE SCOPE 
 In this era of technology people like farmers must be able 
to use various technologies to increase their decision-making 
in various agriculture processes like the timing of irrigation, 
spraying of pesticides, use of fertilizers in the right amount, 
and at right time needed by the crops. But there are some 
limitations as unavailability of WIFI, No Internet, lack of 
knowledge while using the technologies. This IoT based 
portable device is a small effort for people like farmers, 
transporters where rain prediction is of utmost use for decision 
making and the main advantage of this device is that it will be 
operated without the internet and will give the prediction by 
sensing the atmospheric parameters and sky status at the 
current location. Compared to the previous devices this 
proposed 
system 
gives 
rainfall 
prediction 
based 
on 
atmospheric parameters along with present cloud/sky status 
specific to that location, hence is very useful in agriculture for 
monitoring the weather status without the use of any internet 
and the device require very low power which can be given by 
a power bank using USB-C Type cable to a raspberry pi. 
Farmers cultivating crops under irrigation can benefit from 
climate prediction of precipitation and temperature at various 
stages of the growing season. These forecasts enable farmers 
to better manage the timing of water application and apply the 
appropriate amount of water to maximize crop production. 
This device can also be used to monitor individual parameters 
as per the requirement like temperature, humidity, or 
atmospheric pressure. The device works in two modes for 
monitoring individual parameters and gives rain prediction 
only after pressing the push button. Rain prediction is given 
by combining output from machine learning by giving 
atmospheric parameters as input and deep learning by taking 
sky image as input. For a deep learning model Xception model 
gives better accuracy of around 80% as compared to VGG16 
and Inception V3. Whereas for the Machine learning approach 
among all individual machine learning models RandomForest 
and KNN gave a good prediction as compared to others. 
Logistic regression and SVM also performed well while 
predicting the values but Decision Tree and Naïve Byes 
performance was poor in estimating the predictions compared 
to other models. The device is handy and requires human 
intervention for pressing the button to get the rainfall 
prediction as per the requirement. Before reaching the final 
decision of irrigating the land the device can be used after 
every 1 or 2 hours to monitor the changes in the atmosphere. 
The sensed data can be stored in excel in Raspberry-pi and 
whenever a WIFI is available the data can be stored on the 
cloud for future use. 
For future work, the GSM module can be integrated to 
operate the device automatically at regular intervals and the 
prediction can be sent to the farmer's mobile and also the 
motor can be switched ON/OFF as per the suggestion based 
on the rainfall prediction. Water wastage may be greatly 
reduced by including a smart irrigation system, which can 
reduce water consumption by 20%. The integration of smart 
technology, such as machine learning, IoT, the web, and the 
mobile framework, has been a major driver in achieving 
sustainable precision irrigation. Some of the study's findings 
show that sustainable precision irrigation management can 
help farmers achieve food security and avoid water constraint.

Abstract: Digital Twins serve as virtual counterparts, replicating the characteristics and functionalities
of tangible objects, processes, or systems within the digital space, leveraging their capability to
simulate and forecast real-world behavior. They have found valuable applications in smart farming,
facilitating a comprehensive virtual replica of a farm that encompasses vital aspects such as crop
cultivation, soil composition, and prevailing weather conditions. By amalgamating data from diverse
sources, including soil, plants condition, environmental sensor networks, meteorological predictions,
and high-resolution UAV and Satellite imagery, farmers gain access to dynamic and up-to-date
visualization of their agricultural domains empowering them to make well-informed and timely
choices concerning critical aspects like efﬁcient irrigation plans, optimal fertilization methods, and
effective pest management strategies, enhancing overall farm productivity and sustainability. This
research paper aims to present a comprehensive overview of the contemporary state of research
on digital twins in smart farming, including crop modelling, precision agriculture, and associated
technologies, while exploring their potential applications and their impact on agricultural practices,
addressing the challenges and limitations such as data privacy concerns, the need for high-quality
data for accurate simulations and predictions, and the complexity of integrating multiple data sources.
Lastly, the paper explores the prospects of digital twins in agriculture, highlighting potential avenues
for future research and advancement in this domain.

1. Introduction
Digital Twins (DTs) have successfully entered industrial applications, including aerospace,
manufacturing, and healthcare [1–3]. Smart farming, on the other hand, which employs
the latest technological innovations to optimize crop production, is revolutionizing the
agriculture industry. As virtual replicas of physical objects or systems, DTs represent a
highly promising advancement in this ﬁeld [4]. In smart farming, digital twins enable
agriculture experts, researchers, and farmers to simulate various scenarios, test different
strategies, and predict outcomes accurately. DTs in smart farming offer transformative
possibilities, revolutionizing crop cultivation and management while enabling optimization
of resource utilization, minimizing environmental footprint, and enhancing crop yields for
a sustainable and efﬁcient agricultural ecosystem.
However, despite the signiﬁcant promise of digital twins in smart farming, many
questions and challenges still need to be addressed. Farming, a traditionally labor-intensive
sector, after its transformation to a technology-intensive sector in the last decade, has

become more complex and technologically advanced in recent years, moving toward inno-
vative technologies, particularly with the explosion of precision agriculture and other digital
technologies [5]. These technologies help farmers make more informed decisions about crop
management, soil health, and various factors inﬂuencing crop yields and economic viability,
enhancing overall agricultural productivity and proﬁtability. However, these technologies
can also require specialized knowledge and skills and signiﬁcant investment in hardware,
software, and other infrastructural resources. Additionally, factors such as climate change,
changing consumer preferences, and market ﬂuctuations can add to the complexity of
modern farming. While these challenges can make farming more complicated, they also
offer opportunities for innovation and growth in the agriculture domain.
In this era of smart farming, the incorporation of cutting-edge technologies such
as computing, communication, personal and cloud computing, the Internet of Things
(IoT), Artiﬁcial Intelligence (AI), and Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS) has revolutionized
the landscape in agriculture. These technologies bring additional capabilities beyond the
physical realm, allowing for enhanced information and an improved understanding of
the physical structures involved. The concept of DTs plays a pivotal role in providing
comprehensive and accurate information about physical systems, surpassing the limita-
tions of traditional modelling and simulation approaches. By leveraging real-time data
collection, processing, and analysis, DTs offer a digital representation of physical systems,
enabling precise monitoring and forecasting of current and future system states and re-
building existing models and re-design systems and procedures. These advancements are
instrumental in transforming smart systems and addressing the evolving challenges in the
agricultural domain.
This review paper offers a comprehensive and distinctive outline of the recent research
results regarding DTs in the context of smart agriculture, highlighting key ﬁndings and
identifying areas for future research. Speciﬁcally, we report and discuss the various types
of digital twins used in smart farming, such as crop, weather, and soil models, and explore
how they optimize crop production. We also examine the challenges and limitations
of deploying DTs in smart farming related to data management, model accuracy, and
scalability. By providing a comprehensive review of the literature on DTs in smart farming,
this paper aims to advance the understanding of this rapidly evolving ﬁeld, illustrate the
gaps in existing deployments, and identify opportunities for future research and innovation.
We proceeded with our research by pursuing the formulation of the DT implementa-
tion architecture regarding the smart agriculture domain while emphasizing the critical
components taking part in implementing DTs. A comparative accumulation of such im-
plementations and critical components in three tables, while addressing technical aspects,
led to signiﬁcant conclusions regarding DT implementations and related limitations that
seem beneﬁcial to investigate. For example, although the necessity of a DT model and
practical implementations in agriculture is addressed in most reviewed papers mentioning
the concept and deﬁnition, the DT model is proposed merely as an evolving concept lacking
substantial support from implemented case studies. While the DTs seem continuously
evolving, authors refer to simulation models merely as proposals for future practical im-
plementation. Our research seeks to expand the scope of Agriculture 4.0 that necessitates
DTs and address the limitations of IoT-implemented solutions narrowed down by mere
telemetry implementations.
The structure of this study proceeds as follows: Section 2 delves into the concept of
DTs and investigates their usage in the realm of smart farming. Section 3 addresses the
challenges and confronting measures regarding DT building components and relevant
technologies. In Section 4, DT applications in the agricultural domain are reviewed, while
conclusions and comments are unfolded in the Discussion in Section 5. Finally, in Section 6,
future directions for research and development are outlined respectively.

2. The Deﬁnition of Digital Twins
The fundamental concept of a DT, which involves a connected virtual representation
of a physical object or system [6], appears to be relatively straightforward. However, its
application and implementation can differ significantly across various domains and industries.
Although it is quite clear that in addition to their core purpose of modelling real-
world systems, DTs are designed to empower individuals to make informed business
decisions with tangible impacts on the physical realm, a clear deﬁnition of the DT concept
may be helpful to distinguish it from related concepts such as simulation, modelling, and
data analytics. By deﬁning its scope, characteristics, and capabilities, researchers and
practitioners can better identify the speciﬁc features and requirements that make a system
a true DT.
2.1. Deﬁnition of Digital Twins—What Does Digital Twins Term Stand For?
The deﬁnition of DTs emerged in the early 2000s by Michael Grieves [6] while evolving
to a widely acceptable DT concept model where they act as a bridge connecting physical
entities in the real world with their virtual complements in a digital environment, closing
the gap between the two. They establish vital connections between data and information
to seamlessly integrate these products’ virtual and real aspects [6,7]. The convergence
of virtual and physical entities in a virtual space and the real world lays the foundation
for creating a fundamental DT model. By fostering dynamic interplay between these
tangible and virtual elements, the DT is a powerful representation of the combined physical-
virtual system.
Mashaly M. in [8] outlines that DTs act as digital replicas of physical systems and are
organized by establishing data connections. This transformation enables physical systems
to exist virtually while ensuring a strong synchronization between their physical and digital
counterparts. As a result, smooth interactions and data exchange occur between the two
domains. The integration of the physical and virtual domains provides valuable insights,
predictive abilities, and the potential for optimizing system performance following the
pattern illustrated in Figure 1.

the pattern illustrated in Figure 1.

According to Dyck G. et al. [9], the concept of DTs emerged from NASA’s pioneering
work in integrating physical models and simulations [10,11] to analyze intricate systems.
Originally conﬁned to the aerospace sector, the scope of DTs expanded to encompass
product lifecycle management across diverse industries. At its core, as initially proposed
Sensors 2023, 23, 7128

by Grieves & Vickers [6,7,12], a DT comprises a physical object, its corresponding digi-
tal representation, and the interconnectedness between the two that it is established for
both ways.
Ongoing research continues to explore the wide-ranging applications and integration
as interfaces of the DTs in areas such as cloud manufacturing, IoT, and Industry 4.0,
where explicitly stated that the provided response is a unique formulation based on the
given information [13,14].
Hence, DTs serve as virtual counterparts of real-world entities, created using sensor
data and serving as dynamic representations of physical objects or systems throughout
various stages of their lifecycle. By harnessing the power of simulation and data integration,
DTs provide a comprehensive virtual environment that mirrors the characteristics and
behaviour of their physical counterparts. This enables continuous real-time monitoring,
analysis, and enhancement of the physical objects or systems, resulting in enhanced perfor-
mance, efﬁciency, and informed decision-making, as stated by Saddik et al. in 2018 [1].
DTs utilize actual data from real-life situations, machine learning (ML) models, and
simulation combined with data analysis to enhance comprehension, learning, and decision-
making processes. They enable the monitoring and control of various entities, including
devices, machines, vehicles, and individuals. The proliferation of the IoT has spurred
the advancement of diverse DT solutions across diverse domains and use cases support-
ing simulation, optimization, and prediction. Thus, major improvement steps have been
taken in the realm of decision-making so that various sectors, including manufacturing,
healthcare, and smart cities, have witnessed signiﬁcant advancements facilitated by di-
verse technologies like simulation software, IoT, and AI utilized in the ﬁeld of modelling
and simulation [4,13,15,16].
To simulate and model the physical system to succeed in implementing the DTs, the
use of mathematical models is mandatory [17]. Once the observed physical phenomena of
interest are captured, foundational mathematical equations are formulated to depict and
characterize the dynamics of these phenomena accurately. By constructing these mathemat-
ical models, researchers and scientists can effectively represent and analyze the behavior
and relationships inherent in the observed physical phenomena. The models that are
developed need to be validated by experimental stages on the ﬁeld or in laboratory setups
to verify the physical behavior of the problem under consideration soundly. Therefore,
in advanced DTs, a predominant trend is the utilization of extensive datasets to establish
data-driven models. This approach operates under the assumption that the data obtained
from the system serves as a powerful source of insight, offering profound revelations about
its physical behavior. As a result, these well-reﬁned DTs leverage the abundance of data
to construct accurate and thorough models that faithfully capture the intricacies of the
system’s behavior [18]. The interaction of data between the physical entity and its digital
representation in a DT is visually depicted in Figure 2.
By using AI tools, such as ML algorithms or artiﬁcial neural networks, or while
utilizing data processing, the system’s behavior against events may be predicted. Actions
be anticipated once the digital part of the DT functions in parallel with the physical part
allowing, of course, the user’s inﬂuence in the system at any time.
Although the concept and deﬁnition of DT seem to be constantly evolving, we may
imply that the DT of a physical process or object typically consists of a speciﬁc collection
of models, materialized digitally or virtually by computers and associated services and
processes. These models and services are designed in a format that allows seamless integra-
tion with automated systems to fulﬁl functions such as object management, modelling, and
future behaviour forecasting [19].
A simpliﬁed sequence chart representation of the interactions and components in-
volved in a DT system is depicted in Figure 3, where the physical object represents the
actual object or system being monitored and controlled. The DT is the virtual represen-
tation of the Physical Object (PO), where data is processed and analyzed. The PO offers
data aggregated from sensors to the DT, which then forwards the data to the Analytics

component for processing. The Analytics component provides analysis results back to
the DT. The DT sends these analysis results to the Decision Maker, who makes decisions
relying on the received information. The DT then sends optimized actions to the Actions
component. Finally, the Actions component implements the optimized actions in the PO.

Considering the latest developments in digital twin technology, there is growing in-
terest in an expanded and enhanced version known as the Cognitive Digital Twin (CDT) 
or Cognitive Twin (CT). According to a recent study [20], the integration of advanced se-
mantic modelling technologies with DTs enhances their cognitive capabilities, indicating 
a promising trend in their evolution. These advanced versions of DTs exhibit human-like 
intelligent capabilities, including attention, cognition, understanding, retention, logical 
thinking, prediction, decision-making, and problem-solving. They undergo continuous 
development alongside the actual system throughout its complete lifecycle.

CDTs provide substantial advantages to intricate product systems and processes, 
which involve multiple subsystems and interested parties from diverse disciplines 
throughout different stages of the life span. According to the literature review [21], which 
addresses the CDT model to enable Smart Product-Services Systems by implementing 
data-driven business models, CDT represents a promising advancement in DTs, introduc-
ing intelligent and cognitive capabilities. It even represents real-life examples of compa-
nies, including those in the food processing industry, that are currently leveraging the 
cognitive capabilities provided by digital twin technologies offered by edge companies. 
The authors undertaking the task strive to exhibit the potential of utilizing this emerging 
technology by businesses and the creation of data-driven business models. 
To improve data compatibility and develop cognitive abilities, CDT models often in-
corporate diverse and varied data, information, and knowledge, leading to challenges in 
aligning these elements across different DTs and stakeholders. Adopting semantic tech-
nologies such as ontologies and knowledge graphs is crucial to address this issue, as they

Cloud computing [13] has emerged as a critical solution for the complex task of pro-
cessing vast amounts of data in various sectors, particularly in conjunction with the advent
of the Industrial IoT (IIoT). The IIoT, a subset of the IoT speciﬁcally designed for industrial
applications, involves deploying numerous smart devices within industrial systems to
enable real-time data processing after collection and sensing. Given the nature of industrial
environments, IIoT systems demand enhanced levels of secure and robust communication
to ensure optimal production performance [22]. IIoT applications that connect machines,
sensors, and actuators like data collected from agriculture stakeholders to be combined for
effective decision-making and analysis of future trends occasionally produce a large volume
of non-uniform data that needs to be processed in real-time. IoT gateways that provide
connectivity between one or more ﬁeld devices and a service cloud offer accessibility to
previously hidden data from sensors, embedded controllers and IO devices and analyze
such data for multiple purposes, such as remote monitoring, preventive maintenance,
production optimization and building automation. IoT gateways are critical to ensure data
security and communication security within the IIoT systems. A data breach in such IIoT
systems could compromise agricultural production, i.e., crop health degradation, transport
and product processing, leading to inferior production performance [23].
The exponential growth of IIoT and its associated technologies has signiﬁcantly con-
tributed to the advancement of Industry 4.0 and intelligent manufacturing, forming the
underlying framework for CDT. The substantial amount of data induced by IIoT devices
play a vital role in facilitating the development of data-centric services as a crucial ele-
ment. While the concept of CDT continues to evolve rapidly, it is imperative to address
outstanding concerns surrounding the technology to unlock its full potential and achieve
its envisioned advantages.
CDT systems integrate data from different stakeholders as they combine several
parameters, mainly concerning immense amounts of data sharing, demanding measures
to ensure security, privacy, and protection of intellectual property (IP) concerning data.
CDTs incorporate cybersecurity infrastructure and employ data encryption mechanisms
to address these critical aspects effectively. These measures are implemented to regulate
transparency in CDTs, ensure the protection of intellectual property (IP), and facilitate
integrated development processes [8,24].
Similarly, the notion of DT systems emerges as a virtual representation of an enter-
prise, encompassing its resources, processes, workforce, locations, and systems to support
strategic decision-making from the systems used for reporting operational data within the
organization, such as accounting, personnel planning, and sales [25]. This type of DT which
retrieves real-time data from the systems used for reporting operational data within an
organization, as mentioned earlier, is referred to as a Strategic DT (SDT), in contrast to the
industrial DT that gathers information from sensors, serving as a knowledge visualization
tool that allows managers to explore various strategies while minimizing space and time
constraints. By simulating different strategic options through computer models, managers
can gain insights into the potential outcomes of their chosen approaches in the real world.

2.2. DTs in Agriculture
As stated above, the implementation of DTs seems to extend to various ﬁelds vastly.
The objective of this review is to illuminate the ﬁeld of agriculture in the following manner.
A DT for agriculture, in particular, may be addressed as a virtual model of a physical
farm or agricultural operation constructed utilizing cutting-edge technologies like sensors,
IoT devices, and cloud computing. Farmers can utilize the DT to simulate and enhance
their farming methods within a virtual setting, enabling them to reﬁne their practices before
applying them in reality [26,27]. Pylianidis et al. [27] conducted an in-depth report on DTs
in agriculture, encompassing 28 case studies and organizing the key value-added features
of DTs in agricultural applications. The authors highlight the capacity of DT usage in
agriculture, adjusting to ever-evolving circumstances, capturing, and interpreting data,
autonomously managing system actuators in the ﬁeld, and delivering customized services
to individuals, such as reports and transparent information. The DT enables capturing
real-time data on crop growth rates, weather conditions, ambient temperatures, and even
soil moisture levels as various environmental and operational factors. A dynamic model of
the farm may be created by using this data to test different scenarios and optimize various
aspects of the farming operation, including crop yields, resource utilization, and overall efﬁ-
ciency. By creating a DT, farmers can better understand how their farming practices impact
the environment and identify ways to reduce waste and improve sustainability. They can
also use the DT to test new technologies and techniques, such as precision agriculture and
automation, before investing in them for their physical operation. Instances of DTs in the
agricultural sector spanning across various domains ﬁnd applications in diverse areas such
as crop cultivation, dairy production, greenhouse horticulture, organic vegetable farming,
plant disease analysis, livestock management, food supply chain optimization, as well as
farm machinery and building management, including ﬂeet monitoring and control [9].
The schematic in Figure 4 provides a basic representation regarding the application
of DTs in agriculture, showcasing the interaction between the physical farm, sensors,
data processing, analysis, decision-making, and actuation contributing to the physical
entity according to real data and data management derived from the DT. All physical
entities are green, including the sensors that aggregate signals from the area of interest
and the actuators that provide actions in the ﬁeld. All blue-colored sections constitute the
digital space.

Overall, digital twins offer a powerful tool for farmers to optimize their farming prac-
tices and improve the efficiency and sustainability of their operations. Through the rapid 
advancement of technology and sensor capabilities, the DT of agricultural soil can revo-
lutionize plant productivity, health, and yield even to optimize water usage, minimize 
chemical inputs, and enhance overall sustainability in agricultural practices merely by 
emphasizing the soil’s characteristics and attributes. The continuous monitoring and anal-
ysis of environmental parameters, soil elements, and irrigation practices in agricultural 
land can be effectively achieved by incorporating machine learning models, big data ana-
lytics, and decision support systems into the DT framework [28].  
By simulating soil structure and combining soil and irrigation DTs, crop farming per-
formance can be enhanced. Farmers can effectively observe and evaluate alterations in 
agricultural land, impacting soil, irrigation, and crop yield. IoT technology provides real-
time data and visual representations for informed decision-making [29].  fi

land can be effectively achieved by incorporating machine learning models, big data

By simulating soil structure and combining soil and irrigation DTs, crop farming
performance can be enhanced. Farmers can effectively observe and evaluate alterations
in agricultural land, impacting soil, irrigation, and crop yield. IoT technology provides
real-time data and visual representations for informed decision-making [29].
The overall efﬁciency of crop production can be improved by reducing costs associated
with fuel, fertilizers, labor, and factors affecting production efﬁciency and sustainability
merely by utilizing DTs in crop production technologies along with the use of Digital
Information and Communication Technology (ICT) tools, referring to agricultural pieces of
machinery, such as tractors, combined harvesters, fertilizers, and sprayers.
According to Dyck G et al. [9], the DTs seem to ﬁnd their way in post-harvest processes,
encompassing the various stages involved in handling agricultural products after harvest-
ing. These products must be dried, cooled, transported, stored, and undergo marketing
procedures. Digital farming methods provide advantages in post-harvest procedures, such
as minimizing losses, optimizing food processing, improving storage conditions, stream-
lining transportation, and enhancing marketing efﬁciency. These strategies facilitate the
live tracking of the agricultural and food supply network, leading to increased robustness,
resilience and reduced food waste and losses.
IoT technology following the digitalization prospect of agriculture plays a crucial role
in transforming traditional agriculture into a more efﬁcient and sustainable practice. IoT
contextual data enables users to interact seamlessly with their surroundings and remote lo-
cations through their digital twin, fostering enhanced connectivity and user experiences [1].
Facts such as precision agriculture that enables farmers to gather real-time data on
a range of environmental and operational factors, predictive modelling by using both
historical and real-time data so that they can generate a dynamic virtual representation of
their agricultural operation, sustainability, and automation to identify ways to reduce waste
and improve sustainability in farming operations [30] in accordance to real-time data, focus
on addressing critical IoT needs such as two-way communication, comprehensive security
measures, localization, and mobility services to optimize its efﬁciency and effectiveness [31].
In addition, DTs seem to pose a signiﬁcant role in animal farming or precision livestock
farming by enhancing productivity, animal welfare, and overall farm management. They
can be used to create virtual representations of individual animals, groups of animals, or
entire livestock production systems [32], to model and predict animal behavior, growth,
and health, allowing farmers to optimize feeding strategies, detect early signs of disease or
distress, and improve overall animal welfare.
Through data-driven insights and predictive analytics, farmers can make informed
decisions regarding nutrition, breeding, and healthcare interventions. By incorporating
up-to-the-minute information gathered from diverse sources, including sensors, monitoring
devices, and agricultural management systems, DTs enable farmers to monitor, simulate,
and analyze animal behavior, health, and performance.
Neethirajan S. [33] presents a DT processing pipeline with sensors to classify and esti-
mate livestock’s emotional state and behavior. Various means of communication, including
vocalizations, body movements, facial expressions, and posture, contribute to animals
expressing their emotional state. The review presents novel approaches for gathering
extensive real-time data regarding the emotions of farm livestock by implementing a sensor
data processing pipeline within the DT model. This pipeline involves preliminary data
processing, modelling, and simulation phases, ultimately resulting in reporting and pre-
dicting the emotional states of cattle based on their tail movements, facial expressions, and
body posture. Traditional methods involving blood sampling or surveys, for assessing the
emotional states of livestock usually cause interruptions to farming processes while being
time-consuming, and farm animals frequently experience fear, frustration, and distress. AI
technologies facilitate the recognition of cattle states, empowering animal caregivers and
ethologists to understand animal behavior and optimize their well-being and productivity.

DTs may support decision-making and farm management optimization by simulating
different scenarios regarding environmental conditions or genetic factors on animal perfor-
mance and production outcomes while improving production efﬁciency and minimizing
environmental impacts. Furthermore, connections with other digital platforms, such as
farm management systems, supply chain networks, and veterinary databases, allowing for
seamless data sharing and analysis is feasible with DT, thus enhancing traceability, quality
assurance, and decision-making throughout the value chain.
In summary, digital twins have the potential to revolutionize animal farming by
providing real-time monitoring, predictive analytics, and decision support. They can
optimize animal health, welfare, and production efﬁciency while promoting sustainable
farming practices. Continued research and development in this area will be crucial to fully
harness the beneﬁts of DTs in animal farming and address the associated challenges.
An Aquaculture 4.0 architecture of a digital twin-based intelligent ﬁsh farm man-
agement system for precision aquaculture is discussed in [34], addressing the design
considerations, data integration, analytics, and control mechanisms to optimize ﬁsh farm
operations. The proposed implementation utilizes a cloud-based DT technology employing
ML realizations, computer vision, and other sensor devices, and AI-based IoT (AIoT) to
monitor and control automated aquaculture machinery. By optimizing farm production
in various environments throughout the different stages of ﬁsh farming, the system aims
to maximize efﬁciency and productivity. Water quality sensors utilized in ﬁshponds to
monitor and analyze the condition of the water and in offshore sea cages, and RGB or sonar
camera devices may collect environmental data and data related to ﬁsh populations to es-
tablish data-driven prediction models. On the other hand, land-based monitoring systems
send appropriate commands to activate surveillance sensors, thus enabling ﬁsh-feeding
behavior monitoring, disease spread, and ﬁsh population growth.
Furthermore, DTs address optimization solutions regarding water ﬂow and treatment
processes related to water quality reduction following ﬂoods and stormwater within trans-
boundary water security projects due to urban expansion [17]. DT models are employed
to monitor the quality of urban water by integrating physical entities and utilizing sen-
sors in urban drainage systems. The models consider natural processes related to soil,
vegetation, clogging, and biological activity in water treatment. This approach enables
comprehensive monitoring and analysis of urban water systems for effective management
and maintenance.
3. Reviewing Relevant Technologies and DT Components
Although the implementation of DTs in agriculture can vary in complexity and scope
based on the speciﬁc architecture of the DT scheme, in Figure 5, a representative architec-
tural framework for implementing DTs in agriculture is illustrated. The basic components

and maintenance. 
3. Reviewing Relevant Technologies and DT Components  
Although the implementation of DTs in agriculture can vary in complexity and scope 
based on the specific architecture of the DT scheme, in Figure 5, a representative architec-
tural framework for implementing DTs in agriculture is illustrated. The basic components 
and interactions of DTs in agriculture are displayed where the physical farm is repre-
sented by the node labelled “Physical Farm”. Sensor data collected from the farm is de-
picted by the node labelled “Sensor Data”. The sensor data undergoes data preprocessing 
in the node labelled “Data Preprocessing”.

The preprocessed data is subsequently employed to construct a DT model, repre-
sented by the node labelled “Digital Twin Model”. This enables various functionalities, 
including simulation and optimization, represented by the nodes labelled “Simulation” 
and “Optimization”. It also incorporates data analytics, represented by the node labelled 
“Data Analytics”. The decision support system provides action recommendations, repre-
sented by the “Action Recommendations” node. The insights are depicted from the node 
“Insights”, and all visualization and monitoring data are derived from the node labelled 
“Decision Support”. The visualization of data is depicted by the node labelled “Visualiza-
tion” which aids in monitoring the farm. We should point out that effective monitoring 
plays a crucial role in maintaining situational awareness and facilitating timely response 
or intervention as needed. That is represented in the figure by the node “Monitoring”. The 
significant active role of the stakeholders that manage the making and implementing of 
the decisions involved in organizing and operating an agriculture establishment is dis-
played by the node “Farming Practice and Experience”, besides the optimization pro-
vided by the DT concept. 
The action recommendations are implemented through actuators and control sys-
tems, represented by the node labelled “Actuators and Control”, which can affect the 
physical farm. The last node in Figure 5 and the physical farm are in green, specifying the 
physical space in contrast to the digital space nodes in blue. The loop from the “Actuators 
and Control” node back to the “Physical Farm” node symbolizes the ongoing feedback 
loop between the physical farm and its DT, where actions taken based on the DT’s insights

This schematic in Figure 5 highlights the key components and interactions of digital
twins in agriculture, showcasing their role in data collection, preprocessing, modelling,
simulation, analytics, decision support, visualization, and control, ultimately aiding in
optimizing farm operations and improving decision-making processes.
Furthermore, the interconnections among these entities play a vital role as they are
essential for the functioning of the DT system in an integrated manner, as emphasized by
Pedersen et al. in their research [17].
3.1. Technologies Involved in DTs
Therefore, realizing DTs in real-time is characterized by several deﬁning keys that have
emerged along with key technologies [1] from various domains, industries, and scientiﬁc
disciplines that pose a decisive entity, such as the following.
3.1.1. Augmented, Virtual, and Mixed-Reality
DTs rely on Augmented (AR), Virtual (VR), and Mixed-Reality (MR) technologies. As
an example, they can be created using three-dimensional (3D) technologies and presented
as holograms or experienced through AR/VR/MR devices [35], such as the Microsoft
HoloLens. Using sensors installed in the ﬁeld, their real-time digital twin can be generated
and projected as a hologram in remote locations. This enables individuals in different
locations to engage in interactions that simulate being physically present in the same space.
Communication enhancement in digital twins is derived by integrating tactile feedback,
simulating the sensation of physical interaction via haptics. Furthermore, DTs can leverage
humanoid and soft robotics technologies to enable physical actions on behalf of their real-
life counterparts. This means digital twins can physically engage with the environment
or perform tasks, utilizing robotic systems that mimic human-like or ﬂexible movements.
These advancements in augmented, virtual, mixed reality, haptics, and robotics greatly en-
hance the capabilities of digital twins, enabling immersive interactions, realistic sensations,
and physical engagement, expanding the possibilities for communication and collaboration.

3.1.2. Artiﬁcial Intelligence
Artiﬁcial Intelligence (AI) integration into physical assets that lack it inherently is a
key advantage of DTs. This introduces a specialized intelligence capable of efﬁciently com-
prehending vast amounts of numerical data and deriving domain-speciﬁc insights faster
than human experts. Consequently, the data obtained from the digital twin’s surroundings
and physical counterpart should lead to valuable and actionable conclusions [36]. As an
emerging technology, AI empowers computers to exhibit intelligent behaviors, including
behavioral learning. By amalgamating various technologies, including AI, to create twin
models of physical objects, it becomes feasible to generate virtual representations that
closely resemble the original objects, encompassing historical elements and predictive
information [37]. As a result, DTs often incorporate controllers that utilize ontologies, ML,
and deep learning (DL) techniques. These controllers enable swift and intelligent decision-
making on behalf of their real-life counterparts. Moreover, AI signiﬁcantly processes IoT
data through continuously enhanced algorithms that leverage updated user data. Leverag-
ing such time-series data, a user’s DT has the potential to suggest actions for controlling or
mitigating potentially hazardous situations regarding crop health and productivity, in cases
such as droughts to direct asses irrigation efﬁciency or even failures of safety mechanisms
of farm machinery, plant production equipment, post-harvest transportation or storage
equipment situations in which DTs may visualize alarm signals to stakeholders or even take
immediate actions to limit adverse effects or even the destruction of crop production [29].
3.1.3. Communication Technologies and Schemes
DTs rely on communication technologies and schemes to facilitate interaction with the
environment, their physical twins, and other DTs on a real-time basis. This is particularly
signiﬁcant in the realm of wireless communication. Effective communication must occa-
sionally occur within a millisecond (ms) timeframe, necessitating compliance with 5G and
tactile internet standards, while time-sensitive and safety-critical schemes, coupled with
the need for stringent communication standards, lead to a growing demand for repeatable
and cost-effective veriﬁcation procedures. Data transmission within a speciﬁc time window
becomes crucial for time-sensitive and often safety-critical applications, imposing latency
limitations in addition to reliability requirements [38]. The following paragraphs outline
basic wireless communications technologies commonly used in DT implementations.
(a)
RFID technology offers fast and accurate object identiﬁcation using sensor tags, reader
antennas, and a host system. An antenna, an integrated circuit, and a substrate utilize
a tag, where the antenna activates the tag for reading or writing. The reader antennas
communicate with the tags using RF waves, facilitating data transfer to the database
system. This technology ﬁnds extensive applications in storage and inventory man-
agement, supply chain monitoring, access control, aviation transportation, agriculture,
healthcare, and more, improving efﬁciency and automation in various ﬁelds [39].
(b)
Wireless Networks, in particular, suggest an immense role in sending data from
a source to a connected gateway, a role supported by a variety of wireless net-
work technologies such as WPAN, WLAN, WWAN, and LPWAN that are addressed
in [18,39–47]. The existing commercial 4G or 5G LTE communication networks, utiliz-
ing the transmission of data packets through the well-established Internet Protocol
(IP), serves as a base to sustain the architecture of wireless communication networks
in general.
i
Wireless Personal Area Networks (WPAN) are wireless networks that operate
with less extensive infrastructure. They are designed to function within a
limited range, typically within a single room or a small area. Unlike traditional
networks that rely on cables, WPANs enable the wireless connectivity of de-
vices nearby, facilitating the connection of devices like wireless keyboards or
mice to computers and supporting printing services. The most common WPAN
technologies include Bluetooth, 6LowWPAN, ZigBee, EnOcean, NFC, and
RFID, each employing different techniques to achieve the goals of WPAN [40].
Sensors 2023, 23, 7128
12 of 38
Bluetooth enables devices to communicate with each other wirelessly within a
limited proximity. It is a short-range, low-power technology that is used in a
wide variety of devices [41].
ii
Wireless Local Area Networks (WLAN) are wireless networks that allow de-
vices to connect and communicate over a local area without the need for
physical cables within a speciﬁc coverage area, such as a home, ofﬁce, or public
space. These networks utilize the widely recognized IEEE 802.11 standard,
commonly known as Wi-Fi, to enable devices like smartphones, laptops, and
tablets to enable wireless interconnection between them and connection to
the internet. The Wi-Fi—802.11 wireless network, introduced in 1997, using
the 2.4 GHz frequency band and supporting up to 2 Mbps data transmission
rates, evolved to the 802.11ac standard, operating in both 2.4 GHz and 5 GHz
bands, achieving a maximum throughput of 1 Gbps for multiple users, with
a minimum of 500 Mbps. WLANs offer greater coverage than WPANs, span-
ning multiple rooms or entire buildings, making them suitable for larger-scale
wireless networking requirements. They provide convenient and ﬂexible con-
nectivity for various devices and applications, including internet access, ﬁle
sharing, video streaming, and more.
iii
Wireless Wide Area Networks (WWAN) provide wireless connectivity on
a larger scale, spanning cities, regions, or even entire countries. WWAN
technologies, such as 4G Long-Term Evolution (LTE), 5G, and the evolving
6G, enable high-speed mobile internet access and support a wide range of
services, including voice communication, video streaming, and data transfer.
These networks rely on cellular infrastructure and are commonly used for
mobile devices like smartphones, tablets, and laptops to stay connected while
on the go.
iv
Low Power Wide Area Networks (LPWAN) are wireless network technologies
ideal for IoT devices with long battery life, extensive coverage, and low cost.
Unlike 3G/4G or Wi-Fi systems, LPWAN networks are not primarily designed
for high data transmission speeds or reducing latency. Instead, LPWANs target
energy efﬁciency, scalability, and coverage [42], thus gaining popularity in
industrial and research communities. They provide long-range communication,
covering distances from 10 to 40 km in rural areas and 1 to 5 km in dense
urban areas. Their main advantages include energy efﬁciency, a battery life
exceeding ten years, and low cost, which is ideal for IoT applications that
require small-scale data transmission [48]. Various LPWAN technologies have
been developed and deployed in either licensed or unlicensed frequency bands,
such as Long-Range (LoRa), Narrow-Band IoT (NB-IoT), each employing
different techniques to achieve the goals of LPWAN [49].
•
LoRa is an ideal wireless communication technology for low-bandwidth
IoT applications, offering long-range and low-power consumption ser-
vices. It uses a proprietary spread spectrum technique to achieve long-
range and low power consumption, operating in the unlicensed sub-GHz
ISM band available worldwide [50].
•
NB-IoT is a widely used LPWAN technology connecting various devices
and services through cellular networks. It operates in a narrow band-
width of 180 kHz, providing extensive network coverage and low latency.
Designed for cost-effective and delay-tolerant IoT devices, NB-IoT utilizes
LTE techniques and can integrate with existing LTE infrastructure. Coex-
isting with LTE networks, NB-IoT offers power-efﬁcient connectivity and
leverages compatible technologies for seamless integration [51].
The main technical features of the wireless network technologies mentioned above are

Depending on the application’s requirements, the appropriate wireless network should
be selected. Particularly in the context of establishing connectivity among IoT devices
like sensors, the primary role is the selection of a network with wide coverage and low
power consumption. The LoRa network meets these needs, is open, and is used in arti-
cles [25,39–42,44]. In cases where the application requires a higher data rate, Bluetooth
technology can be used, as mentioned in the article [44], but it has signiﬁcantly higher
power consumption compared to LoRa, and the coverage is 100 m for Bluetooth 4.x and
200 m for Bluetooth 5.x. For applications aimed at object identiﬁcation and detection, such
as products in warehouses and animals in agricultural operations, RFID technology is a
suitable choice as mentioned in articles [43,45]. For applications that require a high data rate
and need to utilize a Wi-Fi network, the provision of electrical power is necessary. Finally,
once DTs rely on data exchange, real-time monitoring, and interaction with their physical
counterparts, wireless networks provide a ﬂexible and efﬁcient means of communication
for these purposes [8].
3.1.4. Reliability, Integrity, and Credibility
Reliability, integrity, and credibility are pivotal when DTs are entrusted with sensitive
tasks involving transaction management with their real counterparts. It becomes imper-
ative for the real twin to establish a sense of trust in their digital twin’s capabilities and
actions. Building and maintaining a solid connection between the real twin and the DT is
crucial to foster effective collaboration, enabling reliable decision-making, and ensuring
secure interactions. Consequently, a strong foundation of trust becomes indispensable
for the successful operation and advancement of DT-enabled systems [52]. Therefore,
privacy and security arise as paramount considerations in the realm of DTs. To enable the
conﬁdentiality and privacy of their real twins, DTs should implement robust measures for
identity protection. This can be achieved using dedicated cryptography algorithms and
advanced biometric techniques such as ECG and haptic biometrics. By leveraging these
techniques, the identity and privacy of the real twin can be established and safeguarded.
In addition to identity protection, DTs must prioritize data integrity, security, and privacy.
Measures should be in place to prevent unauthorized access and interception of data across
the network. Unauthorized users should be promptly detected and repelled to prevent any
compromise of data integrity or security. To ensure the authenticity and reliability of data
sources, rigorous measures for data authentication should be implemented before integrat-
ing the data into the digital twin. Overall, DTs must incorporate comprehensive privacy
and security mechanisms to safeguard their real twins’ data’s identity, conﬁdentiality, and
integrity. By adopting robust cryptographic algorithms, employing biometric techniques,
and implementing strict data authentication protocols, DTs can effectively address privacy
and security concerns, fostering a trustworthy and secure environment for the real twins
and their digital counterparts.
3.1.5. Distributed Ledger Technologies and Blockchain
In recent times, Distributed Ledger Technologies (DLT), such as blockchain [44,53],
have emerged to add to user authentication and data integrity regarding data sharing. To
unlock its full potential and achieve its envisioned advantages, addressing outstanding
concerns surrounding the technology is imperative. DLT offers a decentralized approach
that eliminates the need for a central authority or database, distinguishing it from traditional
data-sharing methods. The distributed nature of this system allows for the secure sharing
of data in a trustless environment. The signiﬁcance of DLT has garnered considerable
interest from researchers and practitioners alike. Various systems and platforms based
on Distributed Ledger Technology (DLT), such as private ledgers, public ledgers, and
permissioned ledgers, have been created to address diverse use cases and speciﬁc needs [54].
Proposed technological solutions stemming from IoT, AI, DT, and DLT have been put
forward to address the monitoring and tracking of products within the realm of food
supply logistics and chain and the analysis of collected data to facilitate decision-making
Sensors 2023, 23, 7128

processes [55]. Given the numerous advantages associated with DLT, it presents itself as a
promising technology that can signiﬁcantly contribute to achieving the vision of CDT.
Blockchain technologies, in particular, seem to be an ideal structure for authenticating
users, storing data records, and maintaining data integrity [8,56], providing a secure and
decentralized system of interconnected blocks formed through cryptographic functions.
It allows transactions to be recorded in a veriﬁable manner without intermediaries. Each
preceding block’s hash is included in the next block and is generated through a distributed
consensus algorithm. With encryption mechanisms, blockchain ensures data integrity
and prevents tampering [43]. Ethereum, as a blockchain scheme, provides an alternative
protocol for decentralized applications that, unlike another blockchain scheme Bitcoin, is
not just a payment network but also allows for the creation and use of smart contracts.
It uses its digital currency called “ether” and incorporates a complete programming lan-
guage (such as Solidity) for smart contract development. Pieces of code stored on the
blockchain that enables decentralized transactions without a trusted central authority are
called Smart contracts [57].
On the other hand, the Helium Blockchain is referred to as the major public decen-
tralized LoRaWAN network in the world, that enables devices anywhere in the world
to wirelessly connect to the internet and have a speciﬁc geographical placement without
the need for energy-consuming satellite equipment or expensive mobile data plans [58].
Helium offers low transaction fees and connectivity for LoRa nodes and ensures end-to-end
encryption, which is useful whenever sensitive information is at stake.
The use of blockchain, such as Ethereum and Helium, in IoT and digital twins for
smart agriculture applications has the following advantages:
•
Transparency and trust: Blockchain provides an open, transparent, and tamper-proof
distributed ledger, allowing all stakeholders to verify the accuracy of the data. This can
help build trust among different entities in the agricultural supply chain and prevent
fraud or unauthorized interventions.
•
Blockchain enhances Data security [59] as it utilizes cryptography to protect data. This
is crucial for safeguarding sensitive information related to smart agriculture, such as
data on plant health, soil quality, and food production.
•
Automation and smart contracts on the blockchain enable programmable automatic
execution of conditions and actions based on speciﬁc information, events, and opera-
tions such as automated irrigation, temperature control, and plant health monitoring
in smart agriculture.
•
The distributed architecture of blockchain ensures that information is stored and
veriﬁed by multiple nodes in the network, thus ensuring integrity and continuity of
data and reducing dependency on a central authority.
3.1.6. Cloud Computing
Cloud computing presents a valuable opportunity for DTs to enhance their scalability
and availability, assisting their real twins anytime and anywhere. By leveraging cloud
computing infrastructures, computation and control tasks can be ofﬂoaded from the local
environment to remote servers, enabling DTs to handle complex processes and ensure
seamless availability efﬁciently. The scalability of DTs is signiﬁcantly improved through
cloud computing, as the computational resources can be dynamically allocated and scaled
based on demand. This allows DTs to handle larger datasets, called Big Data sets (BD), per-
form sophisticated analytics, and execute resource-intensive tasks without local hardware
limitations. As the DT model involves the creation and management of virtual replicas that
closely mimic real-world objects or systems, it requires extensive data acquisition, storage,
and processing capabilities for collecting and analyzing a massive volume of data from
various sources, including sensors, IoT devices, and other data-generating components [7],
facts that necessitate cloud computing. The elastic nature of cloud computing ensures
that DTs can adapt to varying workloads and seamlessly accommodate ﬂuctuations in
computational requirements.
Sensors 2023, 23, 7128
16 of 38
Furthermore, cloud-based DTs offer the advantage of ubiquitous accessibility by using
open-source communication platforms, such as OPC Uniﬁed Architecture (UA) commu-
nication protocol and frameworks, for data exchange from sensors to cloud applications
used in DTs. Real twins can access and interact with their DTs from any location and at any
time, provided an active internet connection is in place. This fosters a ﬂexible and versatile
environment where real twins can leverage the capabilities of their DTs regardless of their
physical location.
3.1.7. Internet of Things
Internet of Things (IoT) with 5G and the Tactile Internet (TI) entity meanings have
emerged as groundbreaking technologies, ushering in a new era of communication with
their focus on ultra-high reliability and ultra-low latency. This shift in communication
paradigms from content-oriented to control-oriented is especially signiﬁcant for applica-
tions that involve human-in-the-loop interactions, demanding minimal delays and seamless
integration of communication and control mechanisms as demanded in DT infrastructure.
Within this context, DTs play a pivotal role by establishing a continuously operational twin
feedback loop, ultimately enhancing the service quality of physical systems [60,61]. This
seamless real-time feedback communication loop empowers DTs to constantly monitor,
analyze, and adapt to the evolving conditions of the physical systems they represent. As a
result, precise control actions and optimizations can be executed, ultimately enhancing the
physical systems’ overall service quality and performance.
Through the IoT, users can seamlessly provide contextual data to their DT while
receiving feedback that can be used to enhance their interaction with the environment,
both locally and remotely. Various communication technologies within IoT are required to
transmit data and status information from sensors in the physical entity to the data entity,
enabling seamless connectivity and communication between connected devices [17], as
shown in Figure 7.

locally and remotely. Various communication technologies within IoT are required to 
transmit data and status information from sensors in the physical entity to the data entity, 
enabling seamless connectivity and communication between connected devices [17], as 
shown in Figure 7. 
 
Figure 7. Connection entities over an IoT platform overview. 
The capabilities of DTs are enhanced by contextual data, and the IoT serves as a pow-
erful conduit for feeding such data from users to their DTs and vice versa. This exchange 
of information enables users to interact seamlessly with their surroundings, whether in 
close proximity or at remote locations. Additionally, digital twins can provide valuable 
feedback to the environment, further enriching the user experience and enabling a more 
integrated and interconnected ecosystem.

3.1.8. Modelling and Simulation Software
A DT could be addressed as a tight combination of (i) an object model, in conjunction
with (ii) an expansive set of data that is directly following the object that may evolve,
and ﬁnally, (iii) a method for modifying and reﬁning the model based on the available
data [17,62]. The experts decide the need and selection of the training, validation and
veriﬁcation data concerning speciﬁc case studies, types of soil, plant types, leaf area, plant
height, regarding the Physical Twin, or technological use cases. Critical data processing
depends on speciﬁc plant characteristics, experimental setups, dedicated sensors, ML and
DL applicable methods and big data analytics software.
One of the signiﬁcant beneﬁts of utilizing the DT approach is its ability to accurately
depict objects or entities that change over time, owing to the incorporation of dynamic
and evolving data. Employing a digital twin makes it possible to extend the application
of a validated model across timescales during which the object and its behavior undergo
signiﬁcant variations. A validated model may offer an instant representation of an object’s
behavior at a speciﬁc moment, thus highlighting the importance of associating the DT with
a corresponding physical counterpart and the signiﬁcance of choosing a model according
to the speciﬁc implementation.
Without a physical twin, the DT would be considered nothing more than a model.
Furthermore, the availability of a comprehensive and up-to-date dataset plays a crucial
role in accurately capturing the object’s changes over time and ensuring the model is
adjusted and updated to reﬂect the current system conditions. Any model approximating
the physical twinned can be used for DTs that utilize physics-based models encompassing
all relevant processes that can inﬂuence the measured quantities. In an ideal scenario with
instantaneous computing and ﬂawless accuracy, these models would accurately simulate
and update the mechanical and thermal processes involved in real-time operations. For
instance, a DT of a machine tool could simulate the milling of metal, considering factors
like temperature and part shape, and dynamically update information about tool wear
based on real-time measurements. This enables proactive and effective industrial plant
facilities maintenance, enhancing overall efﬁciency [62,63]. Similarly, to an industrial plant
in agriculture, a digital model could represent the growth of a plant regarding its physical
environmental conditions that are changing over time.
According to researchers, a categorization standard centered around the degree of
data fusion and integration between the PO and its virtual representation can be used as
an indicator to deﬁne and delimit the scope of the proposed concept. Given that this term
was initially created for the manufacturing industry, it serves as a proxy for evaluating
agricultural DTs’ development, convergences, and divergences compared to contemporary
deﬁnitions. Thus, three integration levels represent the digital twin’s ﬁeld. First is the
Digital Model (DM), second is the Digital Shadow (DS), and third is the DT. The DM is a
depiction of the entity in a digital format without the use of an automated data transfer
system. It is equivalent to a Digital Twin prototype and represents the lowest possible
integration level. The DS refers to a digital representation that enables the automatic
exchange of information from the physical entity to its virtual object, reﬂecting changes
in the entity’s state. This one-way information ﬂow is like a DT model, which in contrast,
involves an automated bi-directional ﬂow of digital information. Like the DS, the DT has a
virtual representation whose alterations are reﬂected in the physical entity’s state. However,
what sets the DT apart is its capacity to impact the condition of the physical entity as well,
although the speciﬁc means of inﬂuence depend on the type of entity and its context [63].
In summary, a DM represents a physical system in a digital format but lacks auto-
mated data exchange. A DS involves a one-way automated data ﬂow reaching the digital
counterpart originating from the physical system. Conversely, a DT involves seamless and
fully integrated automated communication between the digital counterpart of the physical
system and the physical system itself.
Deﬁning the objectives of the modelling process is the initial stage in creating a model
for an integrated process. Recognizing that a model is merely a reality approximation is
Sensors 2023, 23, 7128
18 of 38
essential, as diverse objectives can provide different levels of complexity in representing
the actual procedure. For this reason, it is crucial to identify the goal of the model before the
build [64]. Therefore, complex systems like an agriculture model should be ﬁrst designed
and objectively deﬁned so their DT model is accurate. Spreadsheet software such as
Microsoft Excel is commonly employed for process calculations and analyses. This is
due to its widespread availability and familiarity among scientists, engineers, and other
professionals. In contrast, the concept of DTs is somehow new and still emerging. The
spreadsheet’s cells allow users to enter data, make computations, and produce results
while they can plot data from them in several graphs. Software programs like process
simulators allow users to describe and analyze integrated processes. The purpose of
these tools is to simulate continuous processes and their transient behavior. The scientiﬁc
literature concerning process simulation tools is continuously growing, encompassing
various areas such as techno-economic analyses, economic feasibility studies, structural
process enhancements, and the exploration of alternative processes to existing ones [64].
Given that a DT model is much more than a simulation tool, by nature, never being an
exact representation of reality. Still, really an approximation of it, and different objectives
may produce various modelling abstractions with varying levels of detail concerning the
actual process. It is crucial to identify the goal of the model before we develop it.
Since cloud computing has many beneﬁts, it is the most practical method for introduc-
ing DT services. Due to its ability to provide on-demand services, computational resources,
and ubiquitous network access, the implementation of the next-generation information
technology architecture is highly compatible with DT environments. In such environments,
data owners generate data from assets, transmit it to cloud servers, simulate the DT in a
virtual environment, and subsequently share the insights and ﬁndings of the simulation
with the data owner. Users can request access to the data at any time [59]. In construct-
ing complex DT production systems, like industrial or agricultural systems, “machine
learning” and “simulation tools” are two complementary technologies. Creating stochastic
simulations for complicated systems takes time and effort. However, these simulations
are essential for DT construction because they have two crucial capabilities. The ﬁrst is
“uncertainty modelling” and the second is “explainable analytics”. Focusing on how ML
and reinforcement learning (RL) improve simulation, many issues arise in digital twin use
cases. The rapid advancement of IoT, edge computing, and cloud computing technologies
has signiﬁcantly accelerated the progress of digital twins. It is widely believed that digital
twins will soon become a vital catalyst for digital transformation, as evidenced by the com-
mon theme present in various research studies [65]. The primary hurdle lies in establishing
a secure, reliable method to share simulation and real-time data. Additionally, there is a
need for a robust and privacy-centric authentication system that leverages the beneﬁts of
blockchain technology to address the security prerequisites mentioned earlier.
3.2. Notable Components of DT Implementations
In the realm of digital twins, components denote the distinct constituents or elements
that constitute a digital twin system. A representative ensemble follows.
3.2.1. Sensors and Actuators
DTs embody sensors and actuators as parts of great signiﬁcance that offer valuable
data and information about physical phenomena and enable the replication of sensory
capabilities. In today’s interconnected world, an enormous number of sensors and actuators
are deployed across various domains, ranging from consumer products to industrial set-
tings such as smart factories and smartwatches. These sensors capture critical information
related to temperature, humidity, velocity, pressure, chemical components, and material
composition, forming the foundation for digital twin technology [47,66]. By equipping real
twins (physical entities) with sensors, DTs can replicate and harness the senses of sight,
temperature, sound, humidity, and touch through appropriate actuators. For example,
in the agricultural domain, a DT of a plant could leverage sensors to create predictive
Sensors 2023, 23, 7128
19 of 38
maintenance services or simulate and optimize the production process. This allows for the
generation of actionable insights and the enhancement of operational efﬁciency. DTs rely on
the integration of actuator and sensor technologies to gather continuous and accurate data.
The representation of a physical asset in digital forms, like a sensor-equipped machine,
relies on the synchronized operation of virtual sensors and actuators. These software-based
counterparts replicate the functionalities of physical sensors and actuators, aggregating
data from multiple sources. Integrating sensors and actuators within the digital twin
framework enables real-time monitoring, data-driven analytics, and the ability to simulate
various scenarios for optimization purposes. By bridging the physical and digital realms,
digital twins empower industries and sectors to achieve enhanced performance, increased
efﬁciency, and cost savings.
3.2.2. Identiﬁcation of Entities
In the context of DTs, each twin is assigned a distinct identiﬁer that facilitates seamless
communication with its physical counterpart. This unique identiﬁer encapsulates vital
information about the physical object’s structure, capabilities, and technical speciﬁcations,
as well as its expected performance under speciﬁc conditions. When creating a DT, it is
crucial to consider the unique circumstances of the object to ensure an accurate represen-
tation [67]. Even if two physical items are identical, they may exhibit different behaviors
when subjected to varying conditions. Hence, each digital twin is assigned its unique iden-
tiﬁer, reﬂecting the individual characteristics and attributes of the corresponding physical
object. By leveraging the DT’s unique identiﬁer, we can accurately simulate and analyze its
properties and behaviours.
Furthermore, the expansive network of interconnected devices, sensors, and actuators
highlights the need for real-time collection and sharing of identiﬁed contextual data with
digital twins. This data encompasses various parameters such as location, environmen-
tal conditions, user preferences, and behavioral patterns. By integrating this uniquely
identiﬁed contextual data into the DT model, a deep understanding of the user’s context
and needs can be achieved. Adding to that notion, a Geographic Information System
(GIS) as a versatile system generates, controls, examines, and maps various data types and
links IoT data to a map. Thus, GIS combines location information, referred to as spatial
data, with descriptive details of a DT, forming the basis for mapping and analysis utilized
across multiple industries and scientiﬁc ﬁelds. With GIS, users gain insights into patterns,
relationships, and the geographical context of their data, as in [68].
3.2.3. Visualization and Representation
Visualization and representation play a vital role in DTs, offering various forms
of virtual representation depending on the speciﬁc application. DTs can leverage 3D
visualizations to facilitate collaborative design or planning [69]. Depending on the context,
these connections can manifest in various forms, such as a 3D representation, hologram,
humanoid social robot, or purely as software components without physical attendance.
Consequently, DT commonly refers to the digital depiction of a real-world object, system, or
entity’s physical twin that faithfully replicates a unique item, process, person, organization,
or even a legendary narrative. Composite digital twins are formed when multiple digital
twins merge. These DTs, as reﬂections of the actual world, share similar characteristics,
necessitating the modelling of digital processes and objects with composition, ﬂexibility,
sensing, collaboration, and simulation capabilities. Furthermore, predictions suggest that
future DTs will evolve toward a holistic virtual world [70].
3.2.4. Devices
Devices that continuously capture data concerning physiological and environmental
factors information can serve DTs to gain a comprehensive understanding of the real
twin’s well-being and lifestyle. Such wearable devices, for example, smartwatches, ﬁtness
trackers, and other health monitoring devices have enabled individuals to collect and
Sensors 2023, 23, 7128
20 of 38
track various physiological parameters effortlessly. The abundance of such data presents
a unique opportunity for digital twins to enhance their support for their real twins more
efﬁciently [71]. By integrating the data from wearables into the DT model, real-time
insights and personalized recommendations can be generated as feedback or alerts based on
speciﬁc needs and goals. Furthermore, the continuous monitoring and analysis of wearable
data by DTs enable proactive interventions whilst identifying patterns or deviations from
normal physiological parameters and providing early warnings or interventions to address
potential health risks or optimize performance. This proactive support can contribute to
preventive healthcare, early detection of health issues, and overall well-being management.
In summary, the DT is an advanced data management system that integrates 3D ani-
mation, modelling, IoT, AI, and other technologies such as ML. It enables the seamless con-
nection and management of physical and virtual models within a digital environment [72].
As human civilization grows, agriculture remains crucial for our progress and well-being.
Intelligent DT systems can analyze and digitize agricultural areas, enabling macro and
micro-level visual processes. These systems can provide intelligent recommendations and
suggestions that can be implemented to achieve multiple beneﬁts in agriculture.
4. Reviewing DT Applications in Agriculture and Farming Domain
Regarding the methodology, we opted for our research. Initially, an extended search
for literature and bibliography referring to DT in agriculture was conducted in Google
Scholar, Scopus, and Web of Science. We used the query item “digital twin” incorporating
the logical operation of conjunction with the concepts of “agriculture” including concept
association as “crop”, “farm”, “aquaculture”, “animal” and “smart farming” to step on
cases of DT in subﬁelds of agriculture. Queries as such provided 144 relevant papers from
Google Scholar, 153 papers from Web of Science, and 135 papers from Scopus.
Secondly, we narrowed down all references to 105 papers by omitting duplicates,
research papers with almost identical titles, with insufﬁcient or less relevant content, and
following our research individual issues related to the main criteria and title as initially
stated in the introduction, i.e., crop modelling, precision agriculture, and predictive mainte-
nance in smart farming via the DT concept.
Diving deeper into the selection criteria, we used keywords such as plants, smart
agriculture, agriculture 4.0, IoT, aquaculture, food, horticulture, urban farming, DT models,
3D simulation, AR, VR, and Blockchain ledgers. Totally 89 papers, including those for
initially referenced material, were chosen as being deemed relevant to the context of
our research.
Deriving from the central idea of our research based on our study’s concepts, eminently
disclosed in the preceding paragraphs of the current Section 2, we ﬁnally selected a total
number of 26 papers fulﬁlling the criteria to utilize our review as graphically viewed
in Figure 8.

Fourteen articles either being descriptive as in [9] or practically using a case study
project as in [9,19,26,28,35,64,74–77,79–82] address the signiﬁcance of a DT case study in
agriculture. The concept of DTs is mainly addressed in all reviewed papers. In 16 papers
though [19,26–28,64,73,82], the DT concept is analyzed and utilized in more detail, thus
posing the signiﬁcance of using DTs in smart farming and agriculture.
According to the reviewed literature summarized in Table 2, smart farming as an
implementation of agriculture 4.0 [19,26–29,45,63,73,75–77,79–88] includes smart irrigation
strategies by monitoring and controlling various farming stages [28], implementing data
acquisition techniques [27] for automatically controlling actuator systems in agriculture or
even in high-tech data-driven greenhouses [79]. Furthermore, via simulation, monitoring,
controlling, coordinating, and executing farm operations at agricultural sites [87], DTs
improve predictive control in precision irrigation [28,73,88], greenhouse horticulture, and
organic vegetable and livestock farming. Smart farming enhances remote detection and
monitoring of vegetation and crop stress in agriculture [86], developing DT stages and
forecasting plant yield in greenhouses, vertical farms, or outdoor ﬁelds [76,77], or even in
urban and indoor farming, of vertical agriculture utilizing hydroponics, aeroponics, aqua-
culture, and aquaponics. Smart farming approaches the smart agriculture [85] as well as the
sustainable agriculture 4.0 [80] sector to address precision farming and management [75,76]
via the adoption of digital technologies and techniques in agriculture [27,29,64], leading the
way to digital representations of plants [9], inventory quality in agriculture, greenhouse
production ﬂow, and food safety and quality within the food supply chain [45]. Although
the DTs remain a major issue in our research criteria, in papers [29,45,63,83–85], they are
implied as such. In [9], authors propose a functional DT model; in [86], they are proposed
as a signiﬁcant future issue to address and study.

DTs go along with monitoring systems to gather and analyze information. Sensors
pose a critical role in smart agriculture by facilitating the collection of real-time data and
offering valuable insights into a wide range of environmental and agricultural parameters.
Field or soil probes that measure air and ground temperature, humidity, soil moisture,
and ambient light [28,45,73,81,82,88], added to CO2 sensors measuring relative CO2 con-
centration [80,81], and infrared (IR) thermometers provide data acquisition modules for
automatically controlled actuator systems in agriculture approaching digital modelling
to the food process [64] monitoring activities of livestock, optimization of crops, reducing
emissions to air, soil, and water. Drone image cameras [88] and high-resolution photo-
graphic cameras seem ideal for AR and VR by constructing virtual natural low-polygon
3D plant models as proposed in [35,74]. Building Information Modeling (BIM) models of
high-tech data-driven greenhouses are made feasible as in [79] and provide a VR presenta-
tion of the farm or ﬁeld with the aid of a head-mounted display (HMD) with two handheld
controllers serving as handy sensors for manual stimulus. Mini light detection and ranging

(LiDAR) sensors and multispectral cameras following an Arduino single-board microcon-
trollers programmable platform or single-board computer Raspberry Pi-3 enhance IoT
sensor nodes to acquire and transmit farm data to IoT gateways or edge devices, thus
cultivating DT requirements for vertical farms, for the greenhouse production process and
ﬁnally models in sustainable agriculture.
Remote detection and monitoring of vegetation and crop stress in agriculture seem
feasible based on [86] utilizing LiDAR—stereo-photogrammetry technology, using multi-
spectral imagery, passive microwave remote sensing, RFID schemes [9,45], active mi-
crowave remote sensing (RADAR) and sensors onboard UAVs and satellites [45,76,88].
Location determination in farming via geospatial position (GPS) plays a signiﬁcant role in
the remote detection and monitoring of vegetation and crop conditions in agriculture [88].
IoT deployments in smart farming are based on serial hardware communication pro-
tocols such as I2C serial bus [28] and UART that uses asynchronous serial communication
with conﬁgurable speed and pulse width modulation (PWM) for driving actuators [77,81],
in correlation with programmable logic controllers (PLC) for data recording [29], monitor-
ing, and optimization aided occasionally by fuzzy interference systems (FIS) [73].
The decision-making and actions once undertaken by the farmers now have given
way to data-driven agricultural decision-making, i.e., assisting them to undertake informed
decisions related to planting, fertilization, pest control, harvesting, and overall farm man-
agement. Likewise, derived from the smart water management project (SWAMP) [28,73,75]
a hands-on approach is being utilized to develop a precision irrigation platform based on
IoT technology for smart water management, distributed in Brazil, Italy, and Spain.
4.3. The Third Categorization of Research Literature That Is Related to Speciﬁc Technical
Research Aspects
DTs use software to create, operate, and interact with their physical counterparts. The
software component of a DT enables the collection, processing, and analysis of data from
various sources, including sensors, actuators, and other connected devices.
In [28,77], the high-level programming language Python is used for software develop-
ment, scripting, and data analysis, serving the purposes of DT applications, implementing
the Arduino IDE platform, and exploiting the Debian Buster OS to produce a plant simula-
tion model. Likewise, RPi software for the Raspberry Pi platform is used with goal-oriented
requirement language (GRL) for modelling [80]. We should point out the use of an open
standard ﬁle format JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) which is used in [73] for data repre-
sentation and communication between systems and is widely adopted and supported by
various programming languages and platforms. Speciﬁc software packages are utilized
for constructing 3D plant models, such as Unreal Engine 5, Reality Capture, Photoshop,
Mesh Model Construction, Autodesk, Maya [74], Unreal Engine 5 Nanite technology, and
Reality [35]. Other speciﬁc software packages serving, for example, the construction of
a DT ﬂowsheet model as in [64] found in the researched literature are the Aspen Plus
and Aspen HYSYS from Aspen Technology, Inc. (Burlington, MA, USA), ChemCAD from
Chemstations, Inc. (Houston, TX, USA), UniSim Design from Honeywell (Charlotte, NC,
USA), ProSimPlus from ProSim SA (Labege, France) and PRO/II from AVEVA Group plc.
Simulation software was employed in this study [28] to generate a virtual setting for
an irrigation system’s digital twin, incorporating a plant simulation model.
As previously mentioned, in [73], Siemens’s industrial plant simulation software
was used, and in [74], the Virtual UCF Arboretum Application (V1.0) was developed
with virtual plant datasets, plant inventories, VR headsets leading to an AR Holodeck by
multiple captured images taken in 3D space and an AR perpetual garden App.
In [75], a linear model of plant growth is proposed utilizing a wheat multi-agent
planning module close enough to the implied structure modelling simulation in [29],
virtual models are used during the usage phase in [84], an earth system model in [78], a
farm is represented in 3D in [81], the concept of the DT model via data-driven modelling is
assessed [63]. In [76], the authors imply that a software package was developed containing
Sensors 2023, 23, 7128

an ontology editor, a DT editor, multi-agent planning module for creating a prototype of
an intelligent plant DT system in Java whilst AR implementations to save BIM model ﬁles
in Film box (.FBX) in [79] by using Unity game engine to provide 3D modelling software.
Further authors in [9] confronted post-harvest models by discrete event simulation such as
drying, adding to the simulation models for blending and ﬂow DT models [82,83] that rely
heavily on available real-time data a ﬂow for continuous adaption and learning. Finally, DT
modelling implies simulation, analysis, and prediction [88] that may assess the modelling
and simulation of the fertility of seeds, fertilizers, pesticides, pollution challenges, soil
agents (hydrological models, soil data), and crop agents

On the other hand, AI, ML, and DL algorithms seem to be a major issue in [45,63,83,87,88],
leading to Big Data analytics [82] to describe DT modelling that relies heavily on real-time

available data ﬂow. The immense amount of data is stored in databases such as Mongo
DB [28,73], Draco, My-SQL [28,73], and SQLite [80,81], besides using Excel CSV ﬁles for
retrieving height values [79] or generally mentioned Knowledge bases as in [75] leading to
cloud big data manipulation schemes in [45,81,85]. Major cloud computing platforms such
as Alibaba Cloud, Amazon web services, Google Cloud Platform, IBM, and Microsoft Azure
are examples of cloud computing services provided by leading technology companies that
serve the DT idea, as seen in [87].
Cloud IoT service broker agents come into place as a software component or intermedi-
ary that facilitates the interaction between cloud service consumers (users or organizations)
and cloud service providers like FIWARE. In [28,73], FIWARE cloud applications are ex-
ploited, adding to IoT broker and IoT agents to facilitate cloud management of context
information. The procedure includes converting various communication protocols into a
shared base protocol and incorporating intelligent functionality through the processing,
analysing, and visualising of contextual data. FIWARE generally is used as an open-
source platform to provide a standardized framework and a set of reusable components for
building smart applications and services in the context of the IoT and Future Internet (FI)
domains. It aims to simplify the development of innovative and interoperable solutions
by offering a collection of open APIs, data models, and software tools that facilitate the
development of smart applications and services.
A fuzzy inference system enhances adaptive and learning capabilities. It handles
nonlinear and complex relationships between variables, as in [73], in addition to Siemens
industrial plant simulation software for plant simulation model production with a weather
station. In [67,79], the Microsoft Excel spreadsheet application is used instead of other
dedicated software such as Geo-Soft-Core, a Geoscientiﬁc Software & Code Repository
hosted at the archive DIGITAL.CSIC in [78] or Java ontology editor to elaborate a DT
editor in [75,76].
Lastly, wireless network communication technologies are addressed in the research
literature. Initially, the wired networking technology Ethernet is mentioned in [28,73,77],
while the wireless networking technologies such as Wi-Fi are mentioned in [35,45,74,77,87],
LoRaWAN in [45,73], mobile or cellular in [45,74,87] and generally mentioned as mandatory
in [29,82]. Bluetooth, RFID, and NB-IoT are exploited in [85].
5. Discussion
A ﬁrst attempt to comment on speciﬁc aspects of the reviewed literature has been done
in Section 2. In total, 14 journal articles or conference papers, including a published book,
propose case studies that support the idea of DT implementation in agriculture, contrary to
the rest published review papers that sufﬁce to merely describe the topic and record the
achievements of the scientiﬁc community referring to it.
It is interesting to point out that three (3) relevant case study conference papers and a
published book, added to nine (9) journal articles, seem to slightly overcome the amount
of the 12 review papers in a total of 26 articles. The limited practical application of digital
twin technologies is obvious, even stated in the literature by the authors.
Even though [9,86,87] are review papers, the authors either describe the necessity of a
DT model as in [9] for the agriculture supply chain management domain, even addressing
sensors such as level, ﬂow, identiﬁcation sensors, RFID or DNA tags, or highlight the need
for future study on DT models as in [86] making use of remote detection and monitoring
schemes, LiDAR sensors, passive microwave sensing devices, RADARs or even sensors
onboard UAVs and satellites, for monitoring, controlling, coordinating, and executing farm
operations at agricultural sites by IoT sensor nodes as in [87].
The signiﬁcance of using Sensors as part of a dynamic IoT control-oriented mechanism
as demanded in DT infrastructure should be acknowledged as in [35,73,74,77,79–81,87,88]
where soil probes, drone image cameras, multispectral and photographic cameras, IR
thermometers, mini-LiDAR sensors, a mesh of sensors measuring temperature, humidity,
Sensors 2023, 23, 7128
32 of 38
luminosity, and relative CO2 concentration, and air velocity are addressed as essential
elements to materialize relevant IoT platforms accordingly.
In [28,73,75,88], the SWAMP IoT-based smart water management platform is men-
tioned. In [19,26], the IoT scheme is merely addressed, and in the journal [82], IoT is only
mentioned as well in the review papers [63,85,87], where the IoT is stated as a promising
concept. The fact that in [73] an OPC UA server is recommended for implementation,
in [77] an Arduino single-board computer is used as well as the Raspberry Pi-3 platform as
in [80,81] in a total of 14 articles that either describe the use of IoT platforms or vaguely
present a case study project [9,19,26,28,35,64,74–77,79–82] means that the practical imple-
mentation of IoT platforms is quite limited for the time being.
The necessary software to operate such platforms is focused on Python [28,77], ded-
icated FIS, Json, FIWARE Cygnus connector, IoT Agent, OPC agent [73], RPi in [77,80],
Arduino IDE n [77] relevant to the case studies previously mentioned. These make use
of Ethernet communication technologies [28,73,77], LoRa [73], and Wi-Fi, [77] in addition
to [35,74] that make use of Wi-Fi and mobile LTE [74] communication technologies that
facilitate near real-time interaction with the environment.
The concept and deﬁnition of DT seem to be continuously evolving, but in general,
it refers to a speciﬁc collection of digitally or virtually materialized models that represent
a physical process or object. These models are used for simulation and future behavior
forecasting, guiding the feedback loop from the Actuators and Control node to the Physical
entity, as profoundly visualized in Figures 3–5. The ongoing feedback loop between the
physical farm and the DT is imperative to update the DT model to optimize and enhance
performance and efﬁciency.
Several attempts have been made in this direction. In the reviews [9,29,63,83,86], the
concept of the DT model is proposed merely as an evolving concept without an imple-
mented case study. Simulation models [83], referring to data-driven modelling, discrete
event simulation blending and ﬂow models [9], and structure modelling simulation and
future multi-domain radiative transfer models (e.g., SCOPE) with dynamic crop growth
models for agroecosystems DTs [86] are described merely as proposals giving way to future
practical implementations. On the other hand, in [28], simulation software utilizing a
simple plant simulation model is employed to create a virtual environment for an irrigation
system’s digital twin. In [73], the Siemens industrial plant simulation software for the
data model is used, a model of the Earth system is mentioned in [78], a 3D representation
of a farm in [81], while in [82] it continuous adaption and learning procedure of the DT
modelling is mentioned as a need that relies heavily on available data. A more concise
proposal to the origin of the holistic DT modelling and simulation concept appears in [76],
where a prototype of an intelligent plant DT system in Java claimed to be developed, includ-
ing an ontology editor, a digital twin editor, and a multi-agent planning module. In [88],
simulation, analysis, and prediction are addressed by making progress in implementing
modelling and simulation of the fertility of seeds, fertilizer, pesticides, and pollution chal-
lenges, making efforts to develop plant modelling with soil agents (hydrological models,
soil data), crop agents and predictive control models, where the adjustment of control
processes such as heating and ventilation is automated based on short-term temperature
predictions, ensuring efﬁcient regulation, as an IoT derivative scheme.
A ﬂowsheet model is proposed taking advantage of the widespread spreadsheet
applications of Microsoft Excel in [64] to tamper with simulation software such as Aspen
Plus and Aspen HYSYS from Aspen Technology, Inc. (Burlington, MA, USA), ChemCAD
from Chemstations, Inc. (Houston, TX, USA), UniSim Design from Honeywell (Charlotte,
NC, USA), ProSimPlus from ProSim SA (Labege, France) and PRO/II from AVEVA Group
plc, merely to implement a digital modelling approach to food processing.
Spreadsheet applications of Microsoft Excel to retrieve height values of plants in high-
tech data-driven greenhouses are used in [79], a fact that proves that process calculations
and analyses may be conducted using popular spreadsheet software like Microsoft Excel
Sensors 2023, 23, 7128
33 of 38
due to its wide accessibility and familiarity among scientists, engineers, and professionals
from various ﬁelds.
Enhanced 3D modelling software derived from the game industry, i.e., Unity game en-
gine dictates BIM models in Film box (.FBX) format to aid realistic VR/AR representations
of greenhouses, providing a promising realistic overview of a Smart Agriculture imple-
mentation. Virtual representation is accomplished via Unreal Engine 5, Reality Capture,
Photoshop, Autodesk, and Maya software platforms to construct Mesh models of Plant
Datasets for Virtual UCF Arboretum Applications, plant inventories, and AR Perpetual
Garden App. as in [74]. These plant datasets are derived from multiple captured images
in 3D space and incorporate VR headsets aided by GIS and AR Holodeck software. Ad-
ditionally, Unreal Engine 5 Nanite technology and Reality are used for 3D plant models
offering a linear plant growth model [35] to descriptively sufﬁce the wheat multi-agent
planning module. Using multiple captured images taken in 3D space to support the AR
Perpetual Garden App, they produce botanically correct plant models for use in museums
and for educational purposes. A promising perspective, if by any chance associated with
the essential elements of the holistic DT scheme, could be capturing real-time data on
various environmental and operational factors via communication technologies leading to
a dynamic 3D model of a farm entity.
Besides the 3D representation of DT models, IoT Dashboards [87], such as Grafana in
particular [28,73] for real-time data presentation and analysis or even GUI prototypes [81],
are proposed, although used on a small scale for facilitating near real-time interaction of
DTs with the environment. To reliably transfer and manage data, Blockchain is used, even
on a smaller scale, as in [45,87], while Big Data Analytics, as in [82], AI and ML methods
that enable data analysis, pattern recognition, and decision-making based on large datasets,
are addressed in [45,63,82,83,86,88]. Cloud-based data analytics pose a major issue for
the advent of smart agriculture as claimed in [45,85,87], not to omit the signiﬁcance of
databases such Mongo DB, Draco, My-SQL as used in [28,73] or SQLite in [80], and Cloud
computing service providers such as Alibaba Cloud, Amazon web services, Microsoft
Azure and Google Cloud platform [87].
Various factors, with technical hurdles being the primary challenge, seem to be step-
ping behind to allow even further the adoption of the DT technologies. It is essential
to meticulously design and clearly deﬁne intricate agricultural systems to guarantee the
accuracy of their corresponding DT models.
6. Future Directions
Once addressing a DT as a tight combination of an object model, in conjunction with
expansive sets of data that directly follow the object that may evolve and continually modify
and adapt the model based on the available data, it is made clear that future research should
be realized to overcome the current profound lack of reference models and case studies
accordingly. That could serve as a direct guidance for DT research and development.
To broaden the aspect of Agriculture 4.0 that needs DTs and overcome the limitations
of mere telemetry narrowed down by IoT schemes implemented till now, further research
in implementations using DT modelling, 3D visualization, and simulation schemes tar-
geting virtual nature applications aided by AR, VR, and GIS information systems should
be realized.
Further research into the holistic model perception of plant DTs to overcome the focus
merely on the phenotype of plants could vastly support DT research. We can pursue
enhancing the accuracy of depicting real-world farms, plants, and crops in the digital realm
by combining non-georeferenced visualizations, like gaming engines, with geospatially
referenced 3D geo visualizations.
Implementing additional case studies of digital twins that adhere to the mentioned
principles can address challenges related to reliable aggregating and handling of data
from diverse sources, integrating multiple streams of information, and employing ad-
Sensors 2023, 23, 7128
34 of 38
vanced computational methods for data processing and analysis, which could enhance the
understanding of the subject and aid further studies.
Further decommissioning of data in the future resulting from search—Tables 1–3
might be promising. The diverse and abundant potential advantages of DTs in agriculture
create anticipation for the future evolution of this technology and its profound impact on
the farming sector.
We aspire for our work to inspire fellow researchers to explore the application of DTs
in agriculture even further.

This study used canopy temperature data to investigate whether an empirical crop water stress index could be used to monitor spatial and temporal crop water stress. Different irrigation treatment amounts (100%, 67%, 33%, and 0% of full replenishment of soil water to field capacity to a depth of 1.5 m) were applied by a center pivot system to soybean (Glycine max L.) in 2004 and 2005, and to cotton (Gossypium hirsutum L.) in 2007 and 2008. Canopy temperature data from infrared thermography were used to benchmark the relationship between an empirical crop water stress index (CWSIe) and leaf water potential (ΨL) across a block of eight treatment plots (of two replications). There was a significant negative linear correlation between midday ΨL measurements and the CWSIe after soil water differences due to irrigation treatments were well established and during the absence of heavy rainfall. Average seasonal CWSIe values calculated for each plot from temperature measurements made by infrared thermometer thermocouples mounted on a center pivot lateral were inversely related to crop water use with r2 values >0.89 and 0.55 for soybean and cotton, respectively. There was also a significant inverse relationship between the CWSIe and soybean yields in 2004 (r2 = 0.88) and 2005 (r2 = 0.83), and cotton in 2007 (r2 = 0.78). The correlations were not significant in 2008 for cotton. Contour plots of the CWSIe may be used as maps to indicate the spatial variability of within-field crop water stress. These maps may be useful for irrigation scheduling or identifying areas within a field where water stress may impact crop water use and yield.

Introduction Crop sensing technologies have potential as tools for monitoring crop water status, predicting yields (Idso et al., 1978, Idso et al., 1980, Pinter et al., 1983), improving water use efficiency (Evett et al., 1996, Evett et al., 2001, Evett et al., 2006) and harvesting methods, and precisely managing irrigation (Wanjura et al., 1995). Useful information on crop canopy temperature and water relations can be derived from infrared thermography and thermometry. Infrared thermography has been used in agriculture as a non-invasive, versatile imaging tool to investigate biotic stresses (disease or insect infestation), and abiotic stresses (e.g., nutrient and water deficit). Chaerle et al. (2006) combined thermal and chlorophyll fluorescence imaging to study spatial and temporal heterogeneity of leaf transpiration and photosynthesis. These techniques helped identify pre-symptomatic responses (higher chlorophyll intensity co-located with thermal symptoms) and provided diagnosis of diseases (fungal and bacterial infections) and abiotic stresses not yet perceptible in visible spectrum images. Stoll et al. (2008) used an infrared camera to observe thermal responses in grapevine infected with a fungus well in advance of visible symptoms. Bulanon et al. (2009) fused digital and thermal images taken of the same area to improve the identification of fruit for robotic harvesters. Studies involving the analysis of abiotic stresses with thermal imagery include those by Jones (1999) and Jones et al. (2002) in which field studies were designed to assess the consistency and repeatability of using thermal imagery to measure stomatal conductance in grapevine canopies. They concluded that thermography allows for semi-automated analysis of large areas of canopy with much more effective replication than can be achieved with porometry. Leinonen and Jones (2004) classified thermal images to identify leaf area, sunlit, and shaded parts of the canopy. Their methods provided improved estimates of temperature distribution across a canopy by separating out mixed pixels and reducing the effects of thermal contribution from background, and angle of view (Luquet et al., 2003). Leaf water potential measurements became routine in the 1960s with the commercialization of pressure chambers (Turner, 1988) and are considered an accurate and reliable technique to characterize crop water stress, leading to their common use in irrigation scheduling (e.g., Alchanatis et al., 2009, Kite and Hanson, 1984). These invasive and time consuming in situ measurements demonstrate diurnal changes with the minima occurring in mid afternoon (Reicosky et al., 1975, Bhattacharya et al., 1994), which is generally the time of greatest air temperature and least relative humidity. Cohen et al. (2005) and Möeller et al. (2007) used thermal and visible imagery to estimate the crop water status of irrigated cotton and wine grapes by calculating an empirical crop water stress index, CWSIe: (1) where Tc was the temperature (°C) of the crop (average of the leaves within a polygon drawn on a thermographic image) at the time of the thermal image, Tw was the average temperature of a wet reference (wetted white felt surface) that acted as a substitute for the well-watered base line temperature of Idso et al. (1978), and the dry baseline temperature, Tdry, was estimated by adding 5 °C to the maximum dry bulb temperature recorded (Möeller et al., 2007) for the specific field day. They used the temperature of the artificial wet reference as a surrogate for a fully transpiring leaf, i.e., a well-watered crop surface. The CWSIe value was then related to leaf water potential (ΨL) measurements. Spatial ΨL maps were developed based on predictions from the calculated CWSIe, which were themselves derived from canopy temperature maps. Since the wet reference temperature (Tw) required in Eq. (1) requires the establishment, maintenance and movement of a physical wet reference body, it is difficult to use for routine monitoring. An alternative Tw value can be estimated as (Monteith and Unsworth, 1990): (2) where Ta is air temperature (°C), es is saturated vapor pressure (Pa) at Ta, ea is actual vapor pressure (Pa), Δ is slope (Pa °C−1) of the saturated vapor pressure vs. temperature curve evaluated at (Ta), and γ is the psychometric constant (Pa °C−1); all evaluated at the time of Tc measurement for the CWSIe. In preliminary work, we found that Eq. (2) did not always yield a Tw value that compared well with Tw measured on the physical wet reference surface. Since the daily maximum dry bulb temperature is used in Eq. (1), and since it represents a sort of potential evaporative condition, it may be that it should be used in Eq. (2) as well. Alchanatis et al. (2009) found the midday leaf water potential measurements for cotton were optimal when mapping water status in cotton using high resolution thermal imaging. Their focus was to provide leaf water potential maps to irrigators modeled from thermal imagery alone. Ben-Gal et al. (2009) evaluated water stress of differentially drip irrigated olive trees on an orchard scale using infrared thermography. Canopy temperature measurements extracted from the thermal images were used to calculate a CWSI using both empirical and analytical approaches. It was determined that there was no significant difference between the two approaches when compared against stem leaf water potential, stomatal resistance, and soil water potential measurements. Although infrared thermography offers methods for infield spatial mapping, additional equipment (plane, helicopter or lift) is needed to obtain the images. Infrared thermometry, on the other hand, is currently more economical and infrared thermometers (IRTs) do not require a separate platform for crop monitoring when mounted on a moving sprinkler system. Crop canopy temperature measured with infrared thermometers has been used successfully to monitor plant water stress (Jackson et al., 1981, Howell et al., 1984, Sadler et al., 2002, Falkenberg et al., 2007) and, with appropriate algorithms, to control irrigation scheduling (Wanjura et al., 1995, Evett et al., 1996, Upchurch et al., 1998, Peters and Evett, 2007, O'Shaughnessy and Evett, 2010). If a thermally based stress index requiring minimal ancillary inputs can be developed using ground-based remote sensors, the index may be a cost-effective means for timing irrigations or spatially monitoring crop water stress and potential yield. Our objectives were to: (1) determine if the CWSIe calculated from infrared thermography images can be reliably related to ΨL measurements from soybean and cotton taken in differentially irrigated treatment plots; (2) investigate the use of maximum daily dry bulb temperature, Tdry, as a substitute for air temperature at the time of measurement, Ta, in Eq. (2) estimates of wet reference surface temperature, Tw; (3) investigate the relationships between the CWSIe, calculated using data from IRTs mounted on a moving irrigation system, with seasonal crop water use and crop yield across differentially irrigated treatment plots; (4) investigate the strength of the CWSIe-yield relationship as a function of time since differential irrigation treatments were started; and (5) develop contour plots of the CWSIe as a means to represent within-field spatial and temporal crop water stress. 2. Materials and methods 2.1. Agronomy This study was conducted during 2004–2008 at the USDA Agricultural Research Service Conservation and Production Research Laboratory, Bushland, Texas (35° 11′ N, 102° 06′ W, 1174 m above mean sea level). Crop water status was controlled spatially by full and deficit irrigation flow rates accomplished by appropriate sizing of drop hose nozzles (Allen et al., 2000). Irrigations were applied with a center pivot irrigation system using low energy precision application (LEPA) drag socks (Lyle and Bordovsky, 1983) in every other furrow. Treatment plots were arranged in six blocks arc-wise around half of the center pivot circle (Fig. 1) with alternating blocks for manual and automatic irrigation scheduling, which was part of a separate irrigation management study (Peters and Evett, 2008, O'Shaughnessy and Evett, 2010). Within each block, irrigation amount treatments were randomly assigned with two replications arranged radially from the pivot point in blocks. Radial and arc-wise blocking was designed to allow for effects of position along the lateral on irrigation application rate and to minimize effects of possible runoff. Soybean (Glycine max L.), variety Pioneer 94B731 RR (Roundup Ready), was planted on day of year (DOY) 152 (May 31) in 2004 and variety 94M90 RR was planted on DOY 143 (May 23) in 2005. Cotton (Gossypium hirsutum L.), variety Paymaster 2280 was planted on DOY 149 (May 29) in 2007, and Delta Pine 117 B2RF was planted on DOY 141 in 2008 (both varieties were Bollgard II® Roundup Ready®, Land Co., Scott, Miss.). The crops were grown in concentric rows with beds spaced 0.76-m apart. The width of each treatment plot was 18 rows across. Download : Download full-size image Fig. 1. Experimental layout under the 3-span center pivot system shown for the (a) 2004 growing season; and (b) the 2005 and 2007 growing seasons. Pie-slice-shaped sections are blocked by irrigation control method (manual vs. automatic). Each block contains all irrigation amount treatments with two replications, 100%, 67% and 33% of full replenishment of soil water to field capacity and a no-irrigation ((Dry) treatment, which are randomized radially within each section and run concentrically. (Not shown is the plot plan for the 2008 growing season. The north half of the pivot field was cropped, but the order of irrigation treatment amounts was different from that of 2004.) 2.2. Irrigation scheduling and crop water use determination For the manual irrigation control treatment, irrigation amounts were 0%, 33%, 67%, and 100% of full replenishment of soil water in the root zone to field capacity (treatments designated I0%, I33%, I67% and I100%). Soil water content was determined weekly using a neutron probe in 0.2-m increments down to 2.4 m in the I100% treatment plots. In all other treatment plots, soil water was measured once every 30 days. Access tubes were placed in a row in the center of each plot. The neutron probe was field calibrated to accuracy of better than 0.01 m3 m–3, resulting in separate calibrations from three distinct soil layers, Ap, Bt and Btca, using methods described by Evett (2008). Irrigations for the manual control treatment were applied on odd DOY, over 3 days of the week if necessary. Any rainfall occurring prior to irrigation of the total amount for the week was subtracted from the required total. Irrigations for the automatic control treatment were applied on even DOY. Seasonal crop water use (ET) in each plot was calculated using the soil water balance equation (Evett, 2002): (3) where the change in soil water storage (ΔS, mm) was evaluated as the soil profile water content measured to 2.4-m depth, P was precipitation (measured at the adjacent weather station), I was irrigation (determined by nozzle discharge rate, horizontal spacing, lateral rotational speed and run times), F was deep flux into or out of the control volume at 2.4-m depth (assumed zero), and R was the sum of runoff and runon (assumed zero because furrow dikes were used to control runoff). Irrigation was scheduled for the automatic irrigation control treatment using the Time Temperature Threshold (TTT) method for irrigation management and control (Peters and Evett, 2008), which is similar to the Biologically Identified Optimal Temperature Interactive Console (BIOTIC, Upchurch et al., 1998) method. Because irrigations were only possible every other day, the full irrigation level for automatic treatments in the I100% treatment was twice the crop's peak daily ET rate (2 × 10 = 20 mm) so that irrigations could replenish water used by the crop even during the peak water use period. Automatic irrigation scheduling protocols, infrared thermometer sensors (IRTs) (Exergen model IRt/c.5:1-Type T, Watertown, Mass.). Automatic irrigations were triggered only after canopy temperatures exceeded 27 °C for more than 256 min for soybean; and 28 °C for more than 452 min for cotton. Time thresholds were accumulated in a 24-h period on an odd-numbered DOY. Stationary IRTs were located in the field within automatically irrigated treatment plots and provided reference crop canopy temperatures. The irrigation control treatments were generally started in mid July when fraction of vegetative cover was approximately 20% (Table 1). Table 1. Seasonal dates for planting, emergence, and start of irrigation differential amount and control method treatments. Year (crop) Planting date (DOY) Emergence date (DOY) Start of irrigation treatments 2004 (soybean) May 13 (134) May 19 (140) July 14 (196) 2005 (soybean) June 21 (172) June 27 (178) July 19 (200) 2007 (cotton) May 29 (149) June 6 (157) July 17 (198) 2008 (cotton) May 20 (141) May 29 (150) July 18 (200) The TTT plant feedback method of irrigation scheduling depends on canopy temperature measurement; and our implementation is fully explained in Peters and Evett (2008). It is well established that the TTT method results in yields and water use efficiencies at least as great or greater than those obtained with the heretofore acknowledged best scientific irrigation scheduling practice using the neutron probe (Evett et al., 1996, Evett et al., 2000, Evett et al., 2001, Evett et al., 2006, O'Shaughnessy and Evett, 2010, Peters and Evett, 2004a, Peters and Evett, 2006, Peters and Evett, 2007, Peters and Evett, 2008). Note that the TTT automatic irrigation control method is discussed here mostly to complete the methods description. Manual irrigations were applied weekly on odd-numbered DOY at treatment levels of 33%, 67%, and 100% of full replenishment of soil water in the top 1.5 m of soil to field capacity (treatments designated MI33, MI67 and MI100); and a non-irrigated treatment designated MI0 was included. Manual irrigations were based on neutron probe readings taken weekly. The TTT method was a means to apply irrigations automatically; herein the present report focuses on CWSIe relationships to irrigation amount and control method, leaf water potential, crop water use and yield, and the strength of these relationships over the course of the irrigation season. 2.3. In situ measurements and thermographic image analysis In situ thermographic and ΨL measurements were limited to plots located on the outer edge of the field to avoid damaging the crop with the hydraulic lift that was used to position the thermographic camera over the plots. Thermal images and ΨL measurements were not taken in 2004 since the pressure chamber and thermal imager were not available until 2005. However, infrared thermometer measurements of canopy temperature were made as explained in the next section. Leaf stem water potential was measured during the 2005, 2007, and 2008 growing seasons (dates in Table 2) using a pressure chamber (PMS Instrument Company, Albany, Ore.). Ten measurements were made per plot near solar noon in plots 1 through 8 (Fig. 1). Samples were limited to eight plots because of manpower and time constraints. Since the four water treatments were replicated twice in these eight plots, and since 10 measurements of stem water potential were made in each plot, replication of stem water potential measurements for each water treatment was 20, considered adequate for this purpose. Table 2. Days of year (DOY) and dates of in situ measurements, leaf water potential (ΨL) and thermal images. Growing season Dates in DOY and (month and day) 2005 215 (August 3); 237 (August 25); 258 (September 15) 2007 223 (August 11); 240 (August 28); 247 (September 4); 256 (September 13) 2008 203 (July 21); 213 (July 31); 261 (September 17) Leaves were excised with a razor blade, wrapped in aluminum foil, and placed in an ice chest until ΨL was measured. All ΨL measurements were performed within 1 h of excision. The number of in situ sampling dates per growing season was limited due to the amount of labor required to perform the tasks involved. A minimum of three in situ sampling dates were chosen so as to sample over different crop growth stages. For example, for soybean, sampling was conducted at flowering, pod formation, and mature pod stages; for cotton, sampling was done near square formation, after cutout and at the time of boll formation. The actual days were selected at random when afternoon cloud cover was minimal. Digital images were taken with a thermal infrared camera and corresponding software (model SC2000 and ThermaCAM Researcher Pro 2.8 software, FLIR Systems, Billerica, Mass.) on the same sampling days and time as the ΨL measurements, near 1300 CST. Overlapping images were taken simultaneously with an RGB (red–blue–green) digital camera (model DSC-S85, Sony Electronics, Inc., Oradell, NJ) in 2005 and 2007. In 2008, digital images were taken with a camera sensitive in the near infrared as well as in the visible RGB wavelengths and equipped with a near-infrared pass filter (model IS-1, FUJI, Edison, NJ). Cameras were mounted alongside the thermal imager to aid in image analysis. Images were taken at a nadir view angle from a hydraulic platform, 7.0 m above the ground. For each thermometric image acquisition, cardboard crosses covered with aluminum foil were placed in the plant canopy to define the boundaries of interest. The crosses appeared as colder areas in the thermometric images and as bright areas in the RGB images. Also imaged was the wet reference to simulate a non-stressed crop, which was a 27 by 42 cm wet surface constructed from a semi-permeable plastic foam block covered with white polyester felt resting in a basin filled with deionized water. The foam blocks and felt were submerged to re-wet them at least one min before images were taken. Capillary action kept the fabric wetted for several minutes. The wet reference was located in the center of the field-of-view of the image when placed in a treatment plot. Canopy temperature for the CWSIe was determined by averaging three different polygon areas from different crop rows within a single thermal image (e.g., Fig. 2a, c, and e). It was assumed that this method would be similar to the canopy temperatures recorded by IRTs mounted on the moving center pivot system. Download : Download full-size image Fig. 2. Examples of thermal and corresponding digital RGB/IR-pass images taken from 7.0 m above grade in individual irrigation treatment plots. Rectangles shown are the polygons discussed in the text. Shown are average temperature of crop rows, the artificial wet reference (AWR), soil, and individual leaves for: (a) and (b) soybean 2005 (DOY 258), I33%; (c) and (d) cotton 2007 (DOY 247), I0%; and (e) and (f) cotton 2008 (DOY 213), I100%. (b and d) are from a digital RGB camera without filtering; and (f) is from a digital camera that is sensitive in the near infrared and was taken with a filter that excluded wavelengths > near infrared. Shaded soils ranged between approximately 30 °C and 42 °C, sunlit soils were generally >50 °C, and crop canopy temperatures within polygons were between 30 °C and 35 °C. The extracted wet reference temperatures were average values for the unshaded areas of the wet reference body. The digital photographs were used to improve digital analysis and to discriminate between vegetative and soil pixels of similar temperature (example in Fig. 2b). The empirical wet reference crop water stress index, CWSIe, was calculated using Eq. (1), with Tw being the average temperature of the wet reference and Tdry being estimated by adding 5 °C to the maximum dry bulb temperature recorded. The CWSIe ranged from 0 (no stress) to nearly 1 (stressed), at which point Tc was nearly equal to Tdry. The CWSIe values calculated from thermal imagery represented a one-time-of-day measurement only and were not used to calculate the seasonal average CWSIe values discussed later. 2.4. Infrared thermometry In all four years (2004–2008), the CWSIe was also determined using canopy temperature measurements obtained using IRTs. Sixteen IRTs (Exergen model IRT/c.5, Watertown, Mass.) with a 5:1 field of view were mounted on masts attached to the center pivot lateral, with two sensors facing into each treatment plot pointed towards the canopy at an oblique angle. One sensor was mounted at the outside edge of each plot and one sensor on the inside edge so that the sensors were aimed nearly towards each other from opposite sides of the plot to reduce sun angle effects on the average temperature. The center pivot passed over each plot during different times of the day, which required a method to determine the canopy temperature, Ts, at 13:00 CST in order to calculate the CWSIe at 13:00 CST. We used the scaling procedure described by Peters and Evett (2004b): (4) where Te (°C) was the predawn canopy temperature; Tref (°C) was the reference canopy temperature at the same time interval as Ts (°C) (i.e., 13:00 CST); Trmt,t was the one-time-of-day canopy temperature measurement at the plot (remote location, denoted by subscript rmt) at any daylight time t measured by the IRTs on the pivot lateral; and Tref,t (°C) was the measured reference temperature for the time t that the plot (remote) temperature measurement was taken. The diel Tref,t was obtained using stationary IRTs mounted on fixed masts in the fully irrigated treatment plots. Plot-mean scaled canopy temperature measurements, Ts, for each treatment plot were substituted for crop canopy temperature, Tc, in Eq. (1). Signals from IRTs were measured and recorded every 10 s and averaged and stored each min. Average seasonal CWSIe values for each of the 48 plots were calculated from data measured on the days the pivot moved using scaled canopy temperatures (Ts) estimated for 13:00 CST. Again, the CWSIe was calculated using Tdry as the maximum daily dry-bulb temperature (Tmax) + 5 °C. The wet reference temperature, Tw, was estimated using Eq. (2). The value of γ in Eq. (2) was estimated at a barometric pressure of 88.91 kPa. In a sub-study, we evaluated whether Tdry should be used in place of Ta in Eq. (2) by comparing the result of Eq. (2) to measurements of physical wet reference surface temperatures. 2.5. Data analysis Linear regressions of CWSIe vs. leaf water potential were developed using temperature data extracted from thermal images. The average seasonal CWSIe values, calculated using temperature data measured using IRTs on the pivot lateral and with Tw estimated at 13:00 CST (Eqs. (3) and (4)), were linearly regressed against irrigation treatment amounts, seasonal water use (obtained by soil water balance), and crop yield. An analysis of variance was used to determine if irrigation amounts (0, 33, 67, and 100%) had a significant impact on the CWSIe when grouped by irrigation control method (manual vs. automatic). The Bonferroni t-test was used to compare whether mean CWSIe values were the same across irrigation treatment amounts and irrigation scheduling methods (manual or automatic). Analysis was performed using the ANOVA and SAS PROC MIXED procedures (SAS Institute Inc., 2007). We tested the homogeneity of regression coefficients for the manual and automatic methods of irrigation scheduling, when regressing water use and crop yields against the CWSIe, using methods discussed by Gomez and Gomez (1984). All significant differences are reported at the 5% probability level. 3. Results and discussion 3.1. Irrigations, crop water use and meteorological data Average irrigations, change in soil water content, seasonal ETc and climatic data are summarized in Table 3. For soybean, average irrigation levels and average seasonal ETc across irrigation treatment amounts were greater for the manual method. The 2004 growing season experienced below average temperatures and above average rainfall, while in 2005, the reverse occurred with total rainfall being nearly 50% less (Table 3). Overall soybean ETc was higher in 2004 than in 2005, and initial soil water levels for both years were higher than the final soil water levels. Table 3.

Reviewing climatological data for the cotton growing seasons, extreme weather conditions prevailed in 2008. During the months of May and June, high winds and elevated daily air temperatures resulted in a 6% increase in ETo as compared to the same period in 2007. A cumulative rainfall amount of 70 mm occurred from August 11 (DOY 224) through August 21 (DOY 234) in 2008. During this time, the sky was consistently overcast. In August of 2007, 56% of the rainfall occurred on the second day of the month (DOY 214) followed by two weeks of dry hot weather. Also of notable difference, in 2007, maximum daily air temperatures and ETo were highest for the months of June through August. In contrast, the average maximum daily air temperatures for July and August in 2008 dropped nearly 3.5 °C and 2 °C from June's average maximum daily air temperature. Soil water levels were higher at the end of growing season 2008 than at its start. Microclimatological measurements (Table 4) for each sampling day showed that air temperature was highest during the first two sampling days of the season and decreased by between 5 °C and 7 °C on the last sampling day. DOY 240 in 2007 was periodically cloudy, and care was taken to capture thermal images only when the clouds were not blocking the sun. The greatest maximum average air temperature and reference evapotranspiration (ETo) occurred in July and August for each growing season when the average midday temperatures were >30 °C and either wind speed was nearly 5.0 m s−1 or relative humidity was <30%.

Thermal imagery, CWSIe and ΨL Thermal and digital images taken from the hydraulic lift over the 8 treatment plots enabled a clear distinction between shaded and sunlit soil and shaded and sunlit vegetation and their corresponding temperatures (examples for 2005, 2007 and 2008 shown in Fig. 2). For the sampling days listed in Table 2, the CWSIe calculated from digital thermal imagery over plots 1–8 were compared with corresponding ΨL measurements. On most sampling days, ΨL decreased linearly as the CWSIe, calculated from thermal imager data, increased (Fig. 3). The most negative slope occurred in 2005 on DOY 258, where variability in ΨL was well explained by the CWSIe, (Fig. 3a, r2 = 0.93). The inverse linear relationship was consistent throughout the entire 2007 growing season (r2 = 0.88), and on DOY 213, 2008 with r2 = 0.81 (Fig. 3b). These linear relationships were similar to those reported by Jackson (1991) and Ben-Asher et al. (1992) when investigating plant water stress in cotton using the empirical CWSI developed by Idso et al. (1981). Cohen et al. (2005) and Möeller et al. (2007) also described similar relationships when comparing ΨL to the CWSIe (where the artificial wet reference was substituted for the non-stressed baseline temperature) for cotton and grapevine plants, respectively.

The inverse relationship between leaf water potential taken at midday and the empirical crop water stress index, CWSIe calculated using temperatures extracted from thermometric images in treatment plots 1–8 during the growing season: (a) 2005, soybean; and (b) 2007 and 2008, cotton. When ΨL was not significantly related to the CWSIe, the cause was either the inability to quickly establish spatial stress across the irrigation treatment plots after different irrigation treatments began (sampling days on DOY 215, 2005 and DOY 203, 2008 were 2 and 3 days after the start of differential irrigation treatments) or heavy and continuous rainfall that eliminated treatment effects (DOY 237, 2005). Measurements on DOY 261, 2008 showed some variability in ΨL, but smaller differences in CWSIe values than would be expected from the regression relationships, meaning that crop canopy temperature did not vary much across irrigation amount treatments. Irrigation was terminated 36 days prior to this last sampling date, leaving little plant available soil water for cotton plants in all treatment plots, which meant that all plants were stressed and CWSIe values could be expected to be similar across plots. Overall, these results showed that the CWSIe was a good indicator of in-field spatial crop water stress, but results may be rendered inconclusive by the timing of the CWSIe (too soon after differential irrigation treatment has begun, after a heavy rainfall, or when all plants are stressed such that Tc approaches Tdry). 3.3. CWSIe and irrigation amount treatments The effects of irrigation amount treatments were expected to produce different levels of water-stress, whereby the higher amounts would result in less stress. This effect was verified by CWSIe values calculated for treatment plots using canopy temperatures extracted from thermal images. For the example of Fig. 2, the CWSIe was calculated to be 0.76, 0.61, and 0.40 in irrigation treatment levels of I0%, I33%, and I100%, respectively. The same trend of decreasing CWSIe as irrigation amount increased, this time calculated using data from IRTs on the pivot, occurred in all four years (Table 5). In 2005 through 2007, the CWSIe means for the higher irrigation treatments (I67% and I100%), although numerically quite different, were not significantly different. This is likely due to some unevenness across plots in initial soil profile water content, which resulted in some I67% plots having nearly the same profile water content as some I100% plots. In 2008, the mean value for the I0% treatment was not significantly greater than that for the I67% treatment. This was not surprising due to the high amount of rainfall received during the boll filling stage. Seasonal mean CWSIe values were similar at any irrigation amount for both automatic irrigation and manual irrigation; and the pattern of statistical differences among irrigation amount treatments was identical for both irrigation control methods (Table 5). Indeed, the seasonal average CWSIe between the two irrigation control methods (manual and automatic) was not significantly different across the same irrigation treatments (statistics not shown in Table 5).

CWSIe, water use, and yield Estimates of wet reference temperatures calculated using Eq. (2) with Tdry in place of Ta were closer in value to the measured artificial wet reference values extracted from the thermal imagery than were Tw values estimated using actual Ta at the time of measurement (Table 6). Therefore, Tdry was used in place of Ta in Eq. (2) for all estimates of Tw used to calculate CWSIe using IRT data. Table 6.

Crop water use and yield as a function of the season-long mean CWSIe (calculated at 13:00 CST for all plots using IRT data) were examined using mixed statistical models with the growing season year and irrigation control method (i.e., manual vs. automatic) treated as random effects. The growing season inter-annual variability was a significant factor influencing water use and yields, so we analyzed these relationships separately by years. Overall, the irrigation control methods (manual vs. automatic) did not significantly affect yields and water use, with the one exception of 2008 cotton as discussed below. As expected, significant negative linear relationships existed between crop water use and the CWSIe for each irrigation season (Fig. 4a–d), similar to results reported by Dogan et al. (2007). Water use efficiency was significantly greater for the automatic control plots in 2008 due to less total irrigation amounts applied during the season (Fig. 4d).

Negative linear relationship between crop water use and the season-mean CWSIe for each season: (a) soybean 2004; (b) soybean 2005; (c) cotton 2007; and (d) cotton 2008 for manual and automatic irrigation control methods. Linear regression analysis between the CWSIe and crop yield for each growing season explained 88% and 83% of the variation in soybean yields in 2004 and 2005, respectively (Fig. 5a and b). A single regression line was used to represent the data since the slopes between manual and automatic control treatment plots were not significantly different with 44 degrees of freedom for the 5% level of significance. In general, the plots experiencing the smallest seasonal average CWSIe resulted in the greatest water use and yields. This same trend was reported by Nielsen (1990) for soybean grown in Akron, Colorado under irrigation scheduling based on varying CWSI values. Similar to our results, Dogan et al. (2007) reported yields in the range of 0.36–0.37 kg m−2 for fully irrigated soybean (I100%) and average yields of 0.19 kg m−2 (I50%), 0.10 kg m−2 (I25%), and 0.03 kg m−2 (I0%) for deficit irrigation treatment levels. Download : Download full-size image Fig. 5. Inverse linear correlations between the season-mean CWSIe and yields for both manually and automatically irrigated plots: dry grain yields for (a) soybean, 2004; (b) soybean 2005; and lint yields for (c) cotton, 2007; and (d) cotton, 2008. For cotton, the seasonal mean CWSIe explained 78% of the yield variations for all treatment plots in 2007 (Fig. 5c). Again, there was no significant difference between the regression coefficients for the manual and automatic methods of irrigation with 44 degrees of freedom for the 5% level. Similar to soybean, cotton lint yield was significantly related to growing season inter-annual variability. The 2007 linear relationship between lint yield (kg m−2) and the seasonal mean CWSIe, Yield = −0.22CWSIe + 0.24, was similar to the lint yield (LY, kg m−2) relationships reported by Reginato (1983), LY = −0.21CWSI + 0.18, and Howell et al. (1984), LY = −0.19CWSI + 0.18, for conventional row cotton with 1.0 m spacing, where the CWSI was calculated using the empirical method of Idso et al. (1981). Although, the 2008 average season-long CWSIe increased as the irrigation treatment amounts decreased, there was not a consistent negative linear relationship between yield and the CWSIe (Fig. 5d). The slopes between the manual and automatic treatment plots were not significantly different and were therefore represented by a single slope. Cotton production during this growing season was affected by extreme weather conditions. Hot, dry winds at emergence slowed emergence and plant establishment, while heavy rainfall in mid August encouraged vegetative growth and hampered boll filling, particularly in the fully irrigated treatments. The combination of these impediments reduced fully irrigated yields by 70% from 2007. Although the average CWSIe values were inversely related to average lint yields when the fully irrigated treatment plots (I100%) were considered outliers (O'Shaughnessy and Evett, 2010), cotton yields from individual treatment plots were highly variable and not well predicted by the CWSIe. To demonstrate how soon in the irrigation season the relationship between the temporal-mean CWSIe and crop yield may be useful, the crop yield was regressed against a progressive average of the CWSIe calculated from the first date that the pivot moved to progressive dates on which it moved, including at each successive date all the data from the first date to that date. The coefficient of determination, r2, of the regression analysis was plotted against the number of days after the start of irrigation treatment applications (Fig. 6). The approximate time required to establish a stable correlation between crop yield and CWSIe was approximately 5 days for soybean in 2004 and 35 days for cotton in 2007. Not shown is 2005 data for soybean where the trend took approximately 11 days to establish a stable correlation. The use of crop temperature data in this manner may provide producers with useful information regarding the effect of crop water stress on production. However, caution is advised since this method can fail as shown from data on cotton in 2008 (Fig. 5d) where there was no correlation between the temporal-mean CWSIe and crop yield. Values of temporal-mean CWSIe from the early vegetative phase of a crop may be less related to yield because yield in many crops is more influenced by water deficit stress during anthesis and the subsequent yield formation stages (Doorenbos and Kassam, 1979). Also, early season CWSIe values may be influenced by soil background emittance; consequently, high surface radiometric temperature at early stages of plant development may not be a good indicator of plant water use or stress. However, as leaf area increases, surface radiometric temperatures become better indicators of plant water use and plant water stress. Download : Download full-size image Fig. 6. Trend of coefficient of determination, r2, for the relationship between CWSIe and crop yield for: (a) soybean (2004); and (b) cotton (2007). Spatial and temporal variability of CWSIe were visually demonstrated with contour plot maps drawn using a SAS routine and linear interpolation. As an example, progressive mean CWSIe values were plotted spatially and contours drawn for four dates in 2007 (Fig. 7). In these figures, the solid squares represent the centers of the inner 48 treatment plots with the inner arc (smallest radii) representing the fallow edge of the field at the pivot point with an assigned CWSIe = 1.0, and the most outer row representing the fully irrigated border plots with an assigned CWSIe value = 0.1. The plotted mean CWSIe values were the values averaged from DOY 196 (start of irrigation amount treatments) through the date in the lower right hand corner of each contour map. The map for DOY 204 (8 days after the start of irrigation treatments) indicates that crop water stress was fairly homogeneous, with CWSIe ranging primarily between 0.59 and 0.74 (Fig. 7a). During this time, the crop canopy width ranged between 20 and 30 cm (data not shown) across treatment plots, indicating that the fraction of vegetation was less than full, and therefore soil emittance was likely a contributing factor for temperature readings that led to these relatively large calculated CWSIe values. By DOY 227, 31 days after irrigation amount treatments began, the middle (radially) sections of the field showed less stress; the CWSIe declined from ∼0.67 earlier to ∼0.44 along concentric plots representing I100%, I67% and I100% irrigation amount treatments (Fig. 7b). By DOY 236, 40 days after irrigation treatments began, CWSIe values for the greater irrigation treatment amounts, I100% and I67%, became visibly differentiated (light purple) as less stressed than those receiving less irrigation, I33% and I0% (yellow to light green) (Fig. 7c). By DOY 254, (September 11), two weeks after irrigations ceased and 30 mm of rainfall, the seasonal mean CWSIe values between the larger irrigation amount treatments (I100% and I67%) and the severe deficit and dryland treatments (I33% and I0%) remained large (Fig. 7d).

Conclusions and vision Results from this study demonstrated that the CWSIe calculated from infrared thermography images are related to ΨL measurements for both soybean and cotton taken in differentially irrigated treatment plots. Leaf water potential measurements decreased as the CWSIe increased after irrigation treatments were established and maintained. However, it should be noted that measurements taken too soon after rainfall events and termination of irrigations can confound this relationship. This study also showed that a useful empirical crop water stress index (CWSIe) can be calculated from measurements of canopy temperature, air temperature, and a “well-watered crop” surface temperature. The well-watered crop surface temperature can be measured directly using a physical wet reference or modeled. The use of maximum daily dry bulb temperature, Tdry, can be used as a substitute for air temperature at the time of measurement, Ta, to estimate wet reference surface temperature. However, estimating the wet reference temperature (with Eq. (2)) introduced uncertainty relative to the wet reference or non-water stressed baseline temperature and needs further investigation. An average seasonal CWSIe was computed using a modeled wet reference temperature, canopy temperature measurements made from remote IRTs mounted on a pivot lateral, and a proven scaling method for estimating one-time-of-day canopy temperatures. The average seasonal CWSIe so calculated was shown to be significantly correlated to crop yield response for two years of soybean and one year of cotton data. With 2008 data, it was shown that the stress index did not correlate well when extreme weather conditions impacted cotton development. The CWSIe-yield relationship as a function of time over the differential irrigation season indicated that the approximate time required to establish a stable correlation between crop yield and CWSIe was much earlier for soybean, approximately 5–11 days, than for cotton, almost 35 days. Contour plots of the CWSIe plotted over time revealed spatial patterns of crop water stress that became more defined over time and were related to irrigation treatment amounts. Because the CWSIe requires few supplementary inputs, it can be an inexpensive method for providing feedback to a producer and used as a tool for prediction of spatial variation in yield and for monitoring crop water status throughout a growing season when within season weather conditions are not extremely variable. Use of the index normalizes data to ambient conditions and our method of calculating an empirical CWSI was well correlated with ΨL measurements, water use, and yields. These results also compared well with those from Howell et al. (1984) and Reginato (1983) for cotton. This work also shows how current available technology (instrumentation and scaling algorithms) with infrared thermometry mounted on a moving sprinkler system can provide spatial maps to represent within-field crop water status. The benefits provided from use of infrared thermometry give momentum for automated analysis of whole-field crop status using thermal imagery. Thermal imagery would be of more assistance to a farmer since it can provide a more detailed level of critical qualitative and quantitative information regarding within-field spatial and temporal crop water status. Infrared thermography could be used to scan an entire pivot field independent of pivot movement. However, fraction of vegetation, view angle, and cloud cover need to be taken into account as with the radiometer footprint model by Colaizzi et al. (2010). Methods are needed to automate the conversion of field infrared imagery to spatial maps for irrigation scheduling and site specific delivery of water. As thermal imagers become more affordable, automated digital analysis of field imagery taken at different times of the day and converted to useful and easily accessible data could provide decision support information to a producer. Future studies are needed to evaluate the consistency of this empirical CWSI for different crops and in different regions.

Abstract In this paper, we propose developing a system optimally watering agricultural crops based on a wireless sensor network. This work aimed to design and develop a control system using node sensors in the crop field with data management via smartphone and a web application. The three components are hardware, web application, and mobile application. The first component was designed and implemented in control box hardware connected to collect data on the crops. Soil moisture sensors are used to monitor the field, connecting to the control box. The second component is a web-based application that was designed and implemented to manipulate the details of crop data and field information. This component applied data mining to analyze the data for predicting suitable temperature, humidity, and soil moisture for optimal future management of crops growth. The final component is mainly used to control crop watering through a mobile application in a smartphone. This allows either automatic or manual control by the user. The automatic control uses data from soil moisture sensors for watering. However, the user can opt for manual control of watering the crops in the functional control mode. The system can send notifications through LINE API for the LINE application. The system was implemented and tested in Makhamtia District, Suratthani Province, Thailand. The results showed the implementation to be useful in agriculture. The moisture content of the soil was maintained appropriately for vegetable growth, reducing costs and increasing agricultural productivity. Moreover, this work represents driving agriculture through digital innovation.

Introduction Advanced technologies can bring benefits to the majority of people. In the recent years, the Internet of Things (IoTs) has begun to play a major role in daily lives, extending our perceptions and ability to modify the environment around us. Particularly the agro-industrial and environmental fields apply IoTs in both diagnostics and control. In addition, it can provide information to the final user/consumer about the origin and properties of the product (Talavera et al., 2017). Thus, this paper aims to apply IoTs for computer aided optimization of agriculture. In such optimization of agriculture, installing a Wireless Sensor Network (WSN) in the field has improved effectiveness and efficiency of the farmers (Capello et al., 2016, Fang et al., 2014, Hashim et al., 2015, Kodali et al., 2014). It can help evaluate field variables such as soil state, atmospheric conditions, and biomass of plants or animals. It can also be used to assess and control variables such as temperature, humidity, vibrations, or shocks during product transport (Pang et al., 2015). Moreover, WSN can be used to monitor and control factors that influence crop growth and yield. They can also be used to determine the optimum time to harvest, which farmer is more suitable for what conditions, detect diseases, control machinery, etc., (Ndzi et al., 2014). In this study, we focus on data consisting of temperature, humidity, and soil moisture in the crop fields. In order to develop a proper system, we require data storage and an approach to discover knowledge from accumulated data, and interactions with the user. A database system will be designed and implemented as a web-based application. The stored data will be used for decision making to control automatic watering of crops. The agriculture data will be analyzed to optimize and modify the environment around, and to predict the water need of crops in the future. As one of the key contributions, this work applied data mining to extract the best value from precise measurements with automatic computerized devices monitoring crops, land, and climate. Data mining has been applied in agriculture to discover knowledge (Kamilaris et al., 2017, Tripathy et al., 2014). Association rules approach has been mostly used to discover interesting relations between variables in large databases. It helps analyze and establish hidden relationships among the attributes of agricultural data, supporting scientific decision-making (Tripathy et al., 2014). Thus, this performed agriculture data analysis by association rules using the Apriori algorithm in the general rules acquisition, while linear regression was applied to model the relationships between several input variables and an outcome variable. In addition, this work aimed to design and implement a WSN system for sensors in the crop field, along with data management interfaced with the user via a smartphone and a web application. The proposed system can support mixed crop farming and help farmers that have anytime and anywhere connectivity with the system. This article is organized as follows: Section 2 discusses related work, Section 3 presents the proposed diagnostic system, Section 4 shows the agricultural data analysis, Section 5 has results and discussion, and finally, Section 6 concludes the article. 2. Related work In this section, we discuss relevant prior research pertaining to two aspects. The first involves the application of IoTs, while the second aspect focuses on agricultural data analysis based on IoTs devices. 2.1. Application of IoTs In the recent years, IoTs have been applied in many studies, as surveyed in (Ojha et al., 2015, Talavera et al., 2017). The applications of technology in the field of agriculture are used to improve crop yields or quality and to reduce costs. The application of WSN in precision agriculture assists the farmers in a statistical manner, helping them make better and well informed decisions (Fang et al., 2014, Kodali et al., 2014). Fang et al. (2014) introduced a novel integrated information system (IIS) for regional environmental monitoring and management, based on IoTs, for improving the efficiency in complex tasks. The proposed IIS combines IoTs, Cloud Computing, Geoinformatics (RS, GIS, and GPS), and e-Science for environmental monitoring and management, with a case study on regional climate change and its ecological responses, which is one of the hottest issues in the scientific world. The results showed great benefits from such an IIS, not only in data collection supported by the IoTs, but also in web services and applications based on cloud computing and e-Science platforms. Effectiveness of monitoring and decision-making were obviously improved. In addition, IoTs was applied in the agro-industrial production chain (Capello et al., 2016, Medela et al., 2013, Li et al., 2013, Ruan and Shi, 2016). Medela et al. (2013) applied IoTs in the agro-industrial production chain. They proposed an innovative architecture based on the concept of IoTs, combining wireless and distributed specific sensor devices with the simulation of climatic conditions, in order to track the evolution of grapes for wineries. Li et al. (2013) presented an information system for agriculture based on IoTs, with a distributed architecture. In that study, tracking and tracing the whole agricultural production process were done with distributed IoTs servers. Moreover, an information-discovery system was designed to implement, capture, standardize, manage, locate, and query business data from agricultural production. Pang et al. (2015) proposed a value-centric business-technology joint design framework to provide information to the final user/consumer about the origin and properties of the product. Capello et al. (2016) applied IoTs for a real-time monitoring service in order to enable the tracing of products from the end consumer back to the field. Ruan and Shi (2016) presented an IoTs framework to assess fruit freshness in e-commerce deliveries, which was a non-traditional retail service that faces unique challenges in transportation, due to product perishability and expensive logistics. Many studies have attempted to improve the functionality of IoTs (Hashim et al., 2015, Luan et al., 2015). Diedrichs et al. (2014) presented the development of a WSN, based on IEEE-802.15.4, for use in frost characterization in precision agriculture by measuring the temperature. Fourati et al. (2014) proposed a web-based decision support system communicating with a WSN for irrigation scheduling in olive fields. For this purpose, the authors used sensors to measure humidity, solar radiation, temperature, and rain. Hashim et al. (2015) reviewed the control with an electronic device (Arduino) of temperature and soil moisture, and used an Android-based smartphone application for flexibility and functionality. They found advantages in low cost and flexibility for agriculture control in contrast with expensive components such as high-end personal computers. Luan et al. (2015) designed and developed a synthetic system that integrated drought monitoring and forecasting and irrigation amount forecasting into a platform based on IoTs, hybrid programming, and parallel computing. Kanoun et al., 2014, Kaewmard and Saiyod, 2014 focused on irrigation systems using WSN for collecting environment data and control of the irrigation system via a smartphone. Kaewmard and Saiyod (2014) provided a long-term sustainable solution for automation of agriculture to get data from vegetable crops, or for environmental measurements. The authors developed a portable measurement technology including soil moisture sensor, air humidity sensor, and air temperature sensors. Chen et al. (2014) proposed systems for monitoring multi-layer soil temperature and moisture in a farmland field using WSN to improve the water utilization and to collect basic data for research on soil water infiltration variations and for intelligent precision irrigation. Li et al. (2012) proposed an agricultural greenhouse environmental monitoring system based on IoTs, with remote real-time monitoring of environmental information on the greenhouse, combining internet, wireless network and mobile network. Furthermore, Lukas et al. (2015) designed a long-range water level monitoring system for troughs using a WSN based on LoRa transceivers, allowing the cattleman to observe water availability for livestock even when the barn was 1 or 3 km away. Wong and Kerkez (2016) presented a web service and real-time data architecture that includes an adaptive controller that updates the parameters of each sensing node within a WSN based on a previously defined policy. Sarangi et al. (2016) proposed an agriculture support system based on Wisekar to provide automated value-added services that integrate the interoperability of an IoTs web repository with an agricultural advisory call center. 2.2. Agriculture data analysis The use of IoTs leads to a large-scale or big data that provides valuable information. For this reason, many studies have attempted to turn such data into useful information and knowledge, as surveyed in (Kamilaris et al., 2017). Pahuja et al. (2013) developed an online microclimate monitoring and control system for greenhouses. The system was supported by a WSN for gathering and analyzing plant related sensor data to provide control of climate, fertilization, irrigation, and pests. Tripathy et al. (2014) used data derived from WSN to discover knowledge by data mining. This study focused on leaf spot disease assessing the crop-weather-environment-disease relations, based on wireless sensors and field level surveillance. A classifier was trained to predict the disease. Kehua Xian (2017) proposed a new convenient online monitoring system for IoTs, based on cloud computing. After accumulating enough data from an agricultural IoTs system, modeling of relevant functional requirements was demonstrated to promote the application of large data analysis in agriculture. However, only few studies have applied data mining to extract useful information and knowledge, so this current work will mine the data from IoTs. 3. Research methodology 3.1. The real-situation test area This work will demonstrate real installations at 3 points (villages). The three example villages are located apart from each other and have differences in farming. The first example village has lime cultivation and homegrown vegetables. The second example village has a salad farm and homegrown vegetables. The final example village has an integrated farming system with salad farm, chicken farm, mushroom farm, and herbal farm.

All the example villages showed that IoTs can be used to support and help farmers with any type of agriculture. Moreover, the farmers can spend the time saved on other activities for increased income. The real-time information from IoTs devices in each village was used to control on-off switching of water sprinklers, automatically. Initially, we collected IoTs information for 5 months (170 days) and performed yield analysis with these data. The obtained IoTs information consists of temperature, humidity, and soil moisture, and was collected every 20 min, but for analysis the daily averages were used. Moreover, recorded the yields of lime cultivation and homegrown vegetables to determine relationships between IoTs information and the agricultural products. 3.2.

This component involves managing the real-time information from IoTs devices in each village. The web-based application allows an administrator to manipulate the conditions for water need of each crop. In addition, the details of information from IoTs devices can be viewed by an administrator to manage each kind of agriculture. These data were analyzed to predict the water need of crops in the future. The web-based application to manipulate IoTs data from each installation and the details of any crop are shown in Fig. 5.

The final component was used by farmer on a mobile phone. The mobile application was designed to control watering after the data had been analyzed. The mobile application provided two modes, such that farmers can control watering manually, or the proposed system can automatically turn on/off watering based on IoTs information, as shown in Fig. 5. We summarize the formal mechanisms in the proposed system with the system architecture shown in Fig. 6. This system architecture consists of 3 parts i.e. environmental data acquisition layer, data and communication layer, and application layer. The environmental data acquisition layer is designed to collect data on environmental factors from the sensors and device control. The next layer transports all of the gathered sensor data to collect it into a server. The application layer uses the accumulated data to monitor and control the crop and for data management.

Implementation The proposed system is implemented with three parts i.e. control box, web-based application, and mobile application. The control box keeps electronic devices in a waterproof box, as shown in Fig. 7. The control box could be located anywhere in farm or near the farm, having the soil moisture sensors, solenoid valve, DHT22 sensor, and an ultrasonic sensor connected to the control box. In this study, IoTs is applied to the soil moisture sensors to measure the humidity of crop soil and to control switching on-and-off water sprinklers automatically. The solenoid valve was used to control water flow with on/off action. The DHT22 sensor was used to control the humidity of mushroom farm. Ultrasonic sensor was applied to measure the level of water in the chicken farm. Download : Download high-res image (493KB) Download : Download full-size image Fig. 7.

The final part was implemented in order to interface with the farmer. The mobile application is used to control on-off switching of the electrical system by the farmer. This application has 2 modes; automatic and manual. The automatic system was activated when IoTs devices were detected with defined values of field sensors without user input. The farmer can take over the control and turn the water on or off with the mobile application. Fig. 9 is an example of the mobile application to control watering. The main functions of the application are monitoring watering, set-up of crop details in each plot, and notifications via LINE application.

Agriculture data analysis Data mining was applied to extract important and useful knowledge from large data on crops, obtained with IoTs. The knowledge discovery processes are discussed in (Han and Kamber, 2006). Data mining refers to extracting knowledge from large amounts of data. This paper divides data mining into 4 steps as follows. 1. Data pre-processing: This is an important step in the knowledge discovery process, because the quality of knowledge depends on the quality of data. In the real world, data tend to be dirty, incomplete, and inconsistent. Thus, this step can help improve the accuracy and efficiency of the subsequent mining. This step includes data cleaning, data integration, and data transformation. This work used the large amounts of data from IoTs devices on temperature, humidity, and soil moisture, to predict yields, and data for the first example village are shown in Fig. 10. We converted the IoTs information to discrete format in order to support data modeling. Download : Download high-res image (160KB) Download : Download full-size image Fig. 10. IoT information and products from the first example village. 2. Data reduction: This step can encode the data to a smaller reduced representation. The integrity of the original data was preserved in order that mining the reduced data should be more efficient yet produce the same (or almost the same) analysis results. This work used numerosity reduction, where nonparametric methods for storing reduced representations of the data include histograms. We used equal-width histograms with uniform width buckets and 3 buckets for low, middle, and high level. 3. Data modeling/discovery: This step extracts knowledge from the prepared data. Mostly, data modeling/discovery applies intelligent methods to identify patterns in the data. The analysis tools can include classification, clustering, association, and so on. Association rules are the data mining technique applied in this work. Association rules are if/then statements that help discover relationships between subjectively unrelated agriculture data. They were used to find relationships among temperature, humidity, and soil moisture, as well as yields of lemons and homegrown vegetables. There are two basic criteria that association rules use, support and confidence, and they represent relationships and rules as frequently true if/then patterns. In this work the minimum support was 0.75 and confidence was better than 90%. The Apriori algorithm available in Weka 3.6.9 (http://www.cs.waikato.ac.nz/ml/weka/) was used to extract association rules from data. In addition, we applied linear regression to model the relationship between several input variables and an outcome variable. The model type is shown in Eq. (1), (1) ∊ where y is the outcome variable, are the input variables, for , is the value of y when each equals zero, is the change in y based on a unit change in for , and ∊ is a random error term that represents the difference in the linear model and a particular observed value for y. The outcome variables are products of lime cultivation and homegrown vegetables (each has its own model), while the input variables are temperature, humidity, and soil moisture. The R environment was used to fit the models at 95% confidence level, shown in Eqs. (2), (3) for products of lime cultivation ( ) and for homegrown vegetables ( ), respectively, (2) (3) 4. Solution analysis: This step involved an analysis of the results from data modeling/discovery. The solution in our work will be discussed with the real implementation. 5. Results and discussion The proposed system can use IoT devices to collect data on humidity derived from the DHT22 sensor, soil moisture derived from soil moisture sensor, and temperature derived from web service of the Thai Meteorological Department Homepage (https://www.tmd.go.th/). This information can be displayed on a mobile device to the farmer, and is used by automatic on/off control of watering. Moreover, the farmer can manually turn on/off the watering. The functional status of on-off switching and time stamps can be notified via LINE Application. Further, an administrator can manipulate the obtained IoTs information and control the data from each installation. The admin can also mine the data to discover knowledge. This knowledge is applied to optimize the farming by season. From data modeling/discovery, the knowledge results showed that if the product of homegrown vegetables is high (more than 4 kg./day) and lime cultivation is high (more than 6 kg./day) then the temperature will middle level (between C and C), and if the product of lime cultivation is high (more than 6 kg./day) then the humidity will middle level (between 72% and 81%). The knowledge discovery from real data is illustrated in Fig. 11. We found that the knowledge discovery represented the real data well.

From an economic perspective, this proposed system was considered an investment because of its low cost of approximately 93.27 US Dollars per field. We focused on the first example village. The lime cultivation productivity improvement indicates payback within 2 months. In addition, the increased productivity means that the farmer can spend more time on other tasks. In addition, this study has been carried out in a mixed crop environment with three example villages. Each village had different crops and purposes of agriculture. Knowledge discovery can be applied to suggest a control strategy for watering when the farmer would like to have mixed crops. 6. Conclusion IoTs was applied in agriculture to improve crop yields, improve quality, and reduce costs. For these reasons, we proposed WSNs application to watering crops, in this paper. We designed and implemented a system to control environmental factors in the crop fields. The system had the three parts hardware, web application, and mobile application. The first part was designed and implemented in control box form. This control box included hardware and electronic control system to connect to sensors and obtain data on crops. The control box was designed for real-life testing. The implemented design connected to and received IoT information from any field in this study. The second part was the web-based application designed and implemented to manipulate details of crop data and field information. In this step, large-scale data from IoT is stored and utilized in data analysis. As one key contribution, this work applied data mining by association rules to discover useful information on effects of environment and climate. The results showed that suitable temperature for high productivity of homegrown vegetables and lemons was between C and C. Moreover, suitable humidity for high productivity of lemons was within 72–81%. The final part was to control the crop watering with a mobile application on a smartphone. This allowed for both automatic and manual functional control to the user. The user can use the automatic function based on data from soil moisture sensors for watering. However, manual control was possible in the functional control mode. The system sent notifications through LINE API of the LINE application. The developed system was installed in Makhamtia District, Suratthani Province, Thailand. The results showed clear benefits to agriculture. The moisture content in the soil was appropriately controlled for the vegetables, reducing costs and increasing agricultural productivity. This case study shows high potential for digital technology applications in agriculture.

Usually, this thermal-based stress index has been calculated from measurements taken once daily or over a short period of time, near solar noon or after and in cloud free conditions. A method of integrating the CWSI over a day was developed to avoid the noise that may occur if weather prevents a clear CWSI signal near solar noon. This CWSI and time threshold (CWSI-TT) was the accumulated time that the CWSI was greater than a threshold value (0.45); and it was compared with a time threshold (CWSI-TT) based on a well-watered crop. We investigated the effectiveness of the CWSI-TT to automatically control irrigation of short and long season grain sorghum hybrids (Sorghum bicolor (L.) Moench, NC+ 5C35 and Pioneer 84G62); and to examine crop response to deficit irrigation treatments (i.e. 80%, 55%, 30% and 0% of full replenishment of soil water depletion to 1.5-m depth). Results from automated irrigation scheduling were compared to those from manual irrigation based on weekly neutron probe readings. In 2009, results from the Automatic irrigation were mixed; biomass yields in the 55% and 0% treatments, dry grain yields in the 80% and 0% treatments, and WUE in the 80%, 55%, and 0% treatments were not significantly different from those in the corresponding Manual treatments. However, dry grain yields in the 55% and 30% treatments were significantly less than those in the Manual control plots. These differences were due mainly to soil water variability in the beginning of the growing season. This conclusion is reinforced by the fact that IWUE for dry grain yield was not significantly different for 30% and 55% treatments, and was significantly greater for Automatic control at 80%. In 2010, there were no significant differences in biomass, dry grain yield, WUE, or IWUE for irrigation control methods when compared across the same amount treatments. Similar results between irrigation methods for at least the highest irrigation rate (80% of soil water depletion) in 2009 and among all irrigation treatment amounts in 2010 indicate that the CWSI-TT method can be an effective trigger for automatically scheduling either full or deficit irrigations for grain sorghum in a semi-arid region. Highlights ► We used a plant feedback method and remote sensing to successfully schedule irrigations. ► A CWSI calculated over daylight hours in a 24 h period is useful in timing irrigations for sorghum. ► Crop WUE was optimal at the level of 55% replacement of soil water depletion to field capacity.

Introduction Sorghum is important to the livestock and ethanol industries in the United States. Both early and late maturing varieties of grain sorghum are grown in the Northern High Plains area of Texas, where approximately 40% of grain sorghum is irrigated, resulting in yields double those from dryland farming (Colaizzi et al., 2009). Irrigation in this semi-arid region is accomplished primarily with center pivot systems. If irrigation strategies can be automated, farmers can save time and labor by allowing the automated system to monitor crop water status and help determine when to apply irrigations. If automated irrigation systems produce yields and water use efficiencies comparable to those resulting from prior best irrigation scheduling practices, then farmers can realize greater profitability. The theoretical crop water stress index (CWSI) developed by Jackson et al. (1981) was based on energy balance analysis. This thermal stress index has been investigated to characterize plant water stress (Howell et al., 1986, Yuan et al., 2004, Möeller et al., 2007), estimate crop productivity and water stress relationships (Wanjura et al., 1990), and has been used as a tool for irrigation timing (Throssel et al., 1987, Nielsen, 1990, Garrot et al., 1994, Gontia and Tiwari, 2008), usually in its empirical form. The theoretical CWSI incorporates incoming solar radiation, relative humidity, air temperature, wind speed, canopy resistance at potential evapotranspiration, and crop height. Its general form is: (1) where (Tc − Ta) is the measured difference between crop canopy temperature and air temperature, (Tc − Ta)ll is the lower limit representing the temperature difference for a well watered crop, and (Tc − Ta)ul is the upper limit representing the temperature difference between the crop canopy and ambient air when the plants are severely stressed (Jackson et al., 1988). The CWSI tends towards 0 after irrigations and progressively climbs towards 1 as soil water is depleted. Many studies have used differential irrigation amounts on different crops and calculated the corresponding CWSI values (alfalfa – Hattendorf et al., 1988; sorghum – Olufayo et al., 1996; Bermuda grass – Farahani et al., 1993, Emekli et al., 2007; corn – Yazar et al., 1999; cotton – Barbosa da Silva and Rao, 2005). A few studies have used an established CWSI value to trigger irrigations on soybean (Nielsen, 1990) and wheat (Garrot et al., 1994). Typically, the measurements were either instantaneous (Hattendorf et al., 1988, Nielsen, 1990, Farahani et al., 1993) or were taken as average values over a short interval usually near solar noon (Garrot et al., 1994, Olufayo et al., 1996, Ajayi and Olufayo, 2004, Gontia and Tiwari, 2008). Irrigation scheduling using the CWSI has not always been successful, and it has not become widely adopted. One problem is that instantaneous measurements, or mean values from measurements take over a short time period near solar noon, may be influenced by passing clouds, wind gusts or other micrometeorological incidents. We hypothesized that assessing the CWSI over daylight hours would provide a more stable and relevant index for irrigation scheduling (i.e. timing) because it would average and thus smooth out the effects of short-term microclimatological events and more reliably respond to the plant water status. A method of integrating the CWSI over a day was developed. This CWSI-TT was the accumulated time that the stress index, CWSI, was greater than a threshold value (0.45), for a specified time threshold (CWSI-TT) based on a well-watered crop. In this study, we compared a scientifically based manual method for irrigation scheduling that of direct soil water measurements using a neutron probe, to the automated plant-feedback method comprised of infrared thermometers (IRTs) and microclimatological instrumentation for remote sensing of crop water status. While farmers or crop advisers can use a neutron probe to determine soil water status, the disadvantages of the neutron scattering method include the radiation hazard and attendant licensing requirements, relatively poor (and uncertain) spatial resolution, and the soil specific calibration requirement (Or and Wraith, 2002). The initial investment for a neutron probe ranges in cost from $4000 to $6000. The system for remotely sensing crop water status with IRTs and meteorological instrumentation is variable depending on the number of IRTs and the manufacturer. However, with the advent of low-cost wireless sensors (Mahan et al., 2010, O'Shaughnessy et al., 2011) and sensor network systems (O'Shaughnessy and Evett, 2010), the cost is closer to the lower-end of the purchase price for a single neutron probe. Additionally automated systems using the center pivot as a platform for IRTs can be used to provide crop canopy temperature maps on a frequent basis (Peters and Evett, 2007), which will have better spatial and temporal resolution than weekly neutron probe readings. The objectives of this study were to: (1) investigate the effectiveness of the CWSI-TT method to automatically trigger irrigations; and (2) and to examine grain sorghum response to deficit irrigation treatment amounts in a semi-arid region. 2. Materials and methods 2.1. Experimental site Experiments took place at the Conservation Production and Research Laboratory, Bushland, TX (35°11′N, 102°06′W, 1174 m above mean sea level). The field soil was a Pullman clay loam, a fine, mixed, superactive, thermic, Torrertic Paleustoll (Soil Survey Staff, 2004). The field capacity (0.33 m3 m−3) and wilting point (0.18 m3 m−3) water contents were assumed uniform across the center pivot field. The climate is semi-arid with an average annual rainfall of 470 mm. 2.2. Sorghum varieties and agronomics We used a short and long season variety in this experiment since both varieties are important to farmers in this area. Almost invariably, a full-season variety will out-yield a good early-season hybrid, other conditions being equal and favorable for sorghum growth. But, short season varieties use less water over a growing season and can be used as a replacement crop or may provide economic relief if an earlier crop is damaged due to extreme weather conditions or harmful chemical residuals. Early maturing or short season (SS) grain sorghum (Sorghum bicolor (L.) Moench), variety NC+ 5C35,1 was planted on day of year (DOY) 175 (June 24) in 2009, and a late maturing variety or long season (LS) sorghum, Pioneer 84G62, was planted on June 1 (DOY 152) in 2010. Both crops were planted in concentric rows on beds spaced 0.76-m apart under a three span center pivot irrigation system. Irrigations were applied using low energy precision application (LEPA) drag socks (Lyle and Bordovsky, 1983) in every other furrow. Dikes were placed in the furrows to reduce runoff. The sorghum varieties were cultivated in a manner similar to production practices in the region. Fertilizer was applied based on preplant soil samples tested by a commercial soil testing laboratory. The low nitrogen application for 2009 indicates residual nitrogen from the previous year's fallowed field after a failed cotton crop. Fertilizers and herbicides for weed control were applied through the pivot lateral (Table 1). Table 1. Summary of agronomics for 2009 and 2010 growing seasons in Bushland, Texas.

Biomass samples were dried in an oven at 60 °C, and heads were stored in cotton bags and air-dried at room temperature in a drying room. 2.3. Treatments and plot design Two irrigation control method treatments were used; Automatic and Manual as described later. For each irrigation control method, four irrigation amount treatments were applied (80%, 55%, 30%, and 0% (dryland) of full; full being defined differently for automatic and manual control methods as discussed later). Treatment plots were arranged in six blocks arc-wise around half of the center pivot circle (Fig. 1a and b) with alternating blocks for manual and automatic irrigation scheduling. Within each block, irrigation treatment amounts were randomly assigned with two replications arranged radially from the pivot point. Radial and arc-wise blocking was designed to control for effects of position along the lateral on irrigation application rate and to control for effects of possible runoff. Typically, alternating halves of our pivot fields are cropped each year for experimentation and a cover crop is grown on the opposite semi-circle to help even-out the soil water profile. In 2009, however, it was necessary to plant sorghum on the same semi-circle where cotton was grown under differential irrigation treatments in the previous year.

Manual Blocks I, II, and III were irrigated based on weekly neutron probe readings and Automatic Blocks I, II, and III were irrigated automatically based on the CWSI-TT trigger. 2.4. Manual irrigation scheduling Manual irrigations were scheduled over 2–3 days in a 7-day period, following weekly soil water readings by neutron methods usually taken on Monday mornings. Manual irrigations were performed on odd-numbered days of the year (DOY) based on 80%, 55%, 30%, and 0% (designated I80%M, I55%M, I30%M, and I0%M, respectively) of full replenishment to field capacity of water depletion in the top 1.5 m of soil. Soil water content was determined using a neutron probe (NP) (model 503DR, Campbell Pacific Nuclear, Martinez, CA) in 0.2-m increments down to 2.4 m in the I80%M treatment plots. In all other treatment plots, soil water was measured once every 30 days for soil water balance computation of evapotranspiration (ET) only. Access tubes were placed in a row in the center of each plot (18 rows wide). The neutron probe was field calibrated to accuracy of better than 0.01 m3 m−3, resulting in separate calibrations from three distinct soil layers, Ap, Bt and Btca, using methods described by Evett (2008). Any rainfall occurring prior to irrigation of the total amount for the week was subtracted from the required total. Irrigation level was determined by nozzle discharge rate, horizontal spacing of the drop hoses, and the travel speed of the center pivot. 2.5. Automatic irrigation scheduling When scheduled by the CWSI-TT algorithm, automatic irrigations were applied on even DOY. The CWSI-TT algorithm used a CWSI threshold of 0.45, and a time threshold of 420 min. These thresholds were determined from well-watered grain sorghum grown on weighing lysimeter fields at Bushland, Texas in 1988. The CWSI was calculated every 5 min, and each time the index was greater than 0.45 during daylight hours, 5 min of time were accumulated. At midnight, if the cumulative time for the past 24 h was greater than 420 min, then an irrigation was scheduled to be applied using computer control over the automatic blocks of the field the following morning. Because Manual and Automatic irrigations were scheduled on alternate days, the full irrigation level for automatic treatments was based on twice the peak daily crop water use rate of grain sorghum at the location (2 × 10 mm = 20 mm) (Steiner et al., 1991). Irrigations for the automatic control treatments were 80%, 55%, 30% and 0% (designated I80%A, I55%A, I30%A, and I0%A) of 20 mm. Automatic irrigation scheduling was initiated when the SS variety was in the 5th leaf stage, summer 2009, and when the LS variety was in the 7th leaf stage during the summer of 2010. 2.6. Canopy temperature and microclimate instrumentation A total of 16 infrared thermometers (IRTs) (Exergen model IRt/c.5:1-Type T, Watertown, Mass.) were mounted on the pivot lateral and wired to a datalogger (CR21X, Campbell Scientific, Logan, UT) to measure and record crop canopy temperature (Tc). The IRT sensors were calibrated in a controlled temperature environment using a blackbody calibrator (CES100, Electro Optical Industries, Inc., Santa Barbara, CA). Sensors were mounted on vertical masts placed at opposite edges of each concentric treatment plot, with two sensors facing inwards towards the canopy in each plot at an oblique, down-looking angle to reduce sun angle effects and viewing of bare soil. The sensors were located forward of the drop hoses approximately 1.5 m above the crop canopy. An IRT was placed in each of the two I80%A treatment plots in Auto Block I (Fig. 1) to record reference temperature for a well-watered crop. Crop canopy temperatures recorded from the moving irrigation system were averaged for the period of time it took for the system to move across each plot, and so represented a mean one-time-of-day plot-specific temperature. These plot-specific temperatures were scaled using the method of Peters and Evett (2004) to produce estimates of the plot temperature over the entire daytime. Wind speed (uz) and solar radiation (Rs, W m−2) were measured every 2 s at a height (z) of 2 m (using a RM-Young Wind Sentry Set and LI-COR 200SZ, respectively) using a datalogger (model CR10X, Campbell Scientific, Logan, UT) located in plot 12 (Fig. 1) and reported as 5-min mean values. Air temperature (Ta, °C), relative humidity (RH, %), and precipitation (P, mm) were measured using a HMPC45 probe and TE-52 mm bucket wired to a datalogger (CR10X, Campbell Scientific, Logan, UT) mounted near the end of the pivot lateral. Data from each of the dataloggers were transmitted using radio frequency (RF) telemetry in the 900 MHz frequency to a base station computer located at the pivot point. 2.7. CWSI calculations The upper (Tul) and lower temperatures (Tll), boundaries of the CWSI, were calculated from measured environmental parameters paired with scaled canopy temperature data using equations from FAO-56 (Allen et al., 1998). The upper limit was calculated for a non-transpiring crop (latent heat of evaporation = 0) using the equation (Jackson et al., 1988): (2) where Rn is the net radiation (MJ m−2 d−1) is estimated as the difference between incoming net shortwave and outgoing net longwave radiation using Eqs. (38), (39), and (40) in FAO-56 and an albedo (α) = 0.23; G = soil heat flux (MJ m−2 d−1) is estimated using Eq. (45) from FAO-56; ρ (kg m−3) is the density of air approximated as a function of air temperature; Cp = specific heat capacity of dry air (1013 J kg−1 °C−1); and ra is aerodynamic resistance (Eq. (4)). Using this upper boundary equation, assumes bulk canopy resistance, rc, approaches infinity. The lower limit, representing a fully transpiring crop, (Tc − Ta)ll is calculated using: (3) where γ is the psychometric constant (Pa °C−1); Δ is the slope of the saturated vapor pressure-temperature relationship calculated at the average of canopy and air temperature expressed in °C (as in Jackson et al., 1988); es is saturated vapor pressure, ea is actual vapor pressure, and ra is aerodynamic resistance (s m−1), computed as Eq. (4) (FAO-56): (4) where zm is the height of wind measurements (m); zom the roughness length (m) for momemtum transfer, approximated by 0.123 × crop height; zh the height of humidity measurements (m); d the zero plane displacement height (m), approximated by 2/3 × crop height; zoh the roughness length governing transfer of heat and vapor (m), approximated by 0.1 × zom; k = von Karman's constant = 0.41; and uz = wind speed (m s−1). Crop height was estimated using data from sorghum grown on the large weighing lysimeter fields at Bushland, TX. 2.8. Water use and water use efficiency calculations Crop water use (ETc, mm) was calculated using the soil water balance equation (Evett, 2002): (5) where ETc is evapotranspiration, ΔS is the change in soil water stored in the profile as determined using the NP (final minus initial soil water reading), R is runoff, P is precipitation (mm), I is the irrigation water applied (mm), and F is flux across the lower boundary of the control volume (taken as positive when entering the control volume), all in units of mm. Runoff and flux were assumed to be negligible because the field was furrow diked, plots were large enough that horizontal fluxes were important only in plot borders, and NP measurements indicated negligible flux in the 2.1 to 2.3-m depth range. The average daily fractional soil water depletion (Df) in the root zone of the I80%A treatment plots was calculated as Df = Dp/TAW where Dp (depletion) was calculated using a daily soil water balance (Chapter 8-FAO-56 in Allen et al., 1998). Total available water (TAW) is the total of the plant available water in the root zone (depth of 1.5 m) at field capacity. Daily Df was compared to daily average CWSI-TT values from the I80%A treatment plots. The comparison was only made between values from these plots since the irrigation triggers were based on data from these plots. Water use efficiency (kg m−3) was calculated as (6) where Yg is the economic yield (g m−2), and ETc is the crop water use (Howell, 2002). Irrigation water use efficiency (IWUE, kg m−3) was calculated as (7) where Ygi is the economic yield (g m−2) in the ith treatment level, Ygd is the dryland yield (g m−2), and IRRi is the irrigation water applied (mm) (Howell, 2002). 2.9. Statistical analysis Results from each year were analyzed using the General Linear Models (GLM) procedures, and the Bonferroni t-test to perform multiple comparisons of treatment means at p = 0.05. Statistical software was SAS (SAS 9.2, SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC). 3. Results and discussion 3.1. Climate and precipitation In 2009, rainfall from June through October totaled 228 mm, which was typical for the area and time of year. Seventy-four percent of rainfall for this growing season occurred between boot and flowering stage. In 2010, the majority of precipitation again fell between boot and flowering stage; however, the total precipitation for the 2010 growing season was 46% less than for 2009. Maximum daily temperatures and grass reference ET (ETo) values were also greater in August through October of 2010 than in 2009 (Table 2). Table 2.

Soil water and irrigations The soil water profile for the center pivot field at the beginning of the 2009 growing season was variable among treatment plots because circumstances forced cropping sorghum on the same field as had differential irrigation treatments for cotton in 2008. Those 2008 differential irrigation treatments resulted in soil water variability amongst the manual and automatic treatment plots at the beginning of the 2009 growing season (Table 3). Soil water variability in the 30% treatments was such that the mean initial water content was larger for the Manual treatments at the 50–230-cm depths and remained so at depths >50 cm throughout the season. For the 55% treatments, mean initial water content was larger for the Manual treatment below the 70-cm depth and continued so throughout the season. For the 80% treatments, mean initial water content was larger for the Manual treatment at the 50- and 70-cm depths, however, there was no clear difference in water contents between these Manual and the Automatic treatments at 90-cm depth and below throughout the season. Table 3.

Cumulative automatic irrigations were comparable in volume to manual irrigations until DOY 255 (Sept 12) (Fig. 2). Small differences between air and canopy temperatures and higher levels of RH (minimum daily average of 40% and maximum daily average of 92%) between DOY 255 and DOY 264 contributed to reduced CWSI levels, which reduced the number of automatic irrigations that were scheduled compared with those scheduled manually using soil water sensing.

(a) Cumulative irrigations for the manual and automatic irrigation control methods plotted with time and key growth stages for 2009.Irrigations for the automatic treatments kept up with those for the manual control plots until DOY 251; (b) in 2010, automatic irrigation scheduling started on DOY 186. During the last week of the irrigation season, Sep 3 to Sep 10 (DOY 247–252), no automatic irrigation signals were received. In 2010, the soil water profile was nearly uniform among the 48 treatment plots; the average soil water content was 482 mm in the 1.5-m profile (0.32 m3 m−3), which was near field capacity, with a standard deviation of ±3 mm. Uniformity of the soil water profile was improved by the precipitation received in the early months of the calendar year, and also by the fact that the field was fallowed in the previous year. Irrigation amount differences between the Automatic and Manual methods were less than 3%; however, the automatic control method scheduled irrigations that did not match the Manual irrigations (i.e., NP readings did not indicate a need to irrigate manual control plots) early in the season. Cumulative irrigations in the I80%A treatment plots were 39 mm greater than irrigations in the I80%M plots from July 5–July 31 (DOY 186–212). A frequent number of irrigation signals for the automatic control treatments were received during the week of Jul 19 to Jul 27, 2010. A site visit to the field indicated that these signals were false positives due to the sensors on the pivot being aimed at acute angles from the vertical and looking mainly at soil rather crop canopy surfaces. This likely contributed to the IRTs viewing more soil background than canopy cover at the onset of the irrigation season. During August, the irrigation amounts were nearly equivalent between irrigation methods; and near the end of the irrigation season, Sep 8–10 (DOY 251 to DOY 253), three manual irrigations were not matched by the automatic control method (Fig. 2) due to cloud cover and ambient air temperatures exceeding canopy temperatures. In addition to meeting crop water needs, irrigators are also concerned with the possibility of over-irrigating and causing surface runoff or deep percolation which can waste water and drive nutrients from the root zone. There was no evidence of deep percolation in any of the 80% irrigation treatment plots for years 2009 and 2010 as soil water content at the lower depths were stable (Fig. 3). Manual irrigations were continued longer to reduce lodging, which was observed especially in the 30% treatment plots. Download : Download full-size image Fig. 3. Average soil water content in the I80% irrigation treatment plots for SS variety grown in 2009: (a) manual treatment plots; and (b) automatic treatment plots; and for LS variety sorghum grown in 2010: [c] manual treatment plots; and (d) automatic treatment plots. 3.3. Yield, ETc, WUE, IWUE 3.3.1. Difference between irrigation control methods Data for each variety of sorghum were analyzed separately. Analyses were made across irrigation methods, grouped by irrigation treatment amounts to make comparisons between manual and automatic irrigation scheduling. In 2009, biomass dry matter was significantly greater for the I80M% (F statistic = 10.5, p = 0.01), and I30M% treatment amounts (F statistic = 5.46, p = 0.04) (Table 5). There was no significant difference across irrigation scheduling methods between dry grain yields at the I80% irrigation amount or at the I0% amount. However, dry grain yields were significantly greater in the I55M% (F statistic = 5.15, p = 0.05) and I30M% (F statistic = 6.17, p = 0.03) control treatments. Crop water use (ETc) was significantly greater in I80M% (F = 7.34, p = 0.02) and in the I55M% (F = 28.87, p = 0.0003) treatments, and grain yields were higher. Water use efficiency in the I30%A (F = 6.12, p = 0.033) was significantly less than that for the I30%M treatment due to the low grain yield produced in the I30%A treatment. Unger and Wiese (1979) reported an increase in sorghum yield of 17.6 kg ha−1 for each mm (1.76 kg m−3) increase in profile water content measured to 1.8-m depth at planting. If applied to the differential in profile water content on DOY 187, this would give an estimated 268 kg ha−1 yield increase for manual irrigation at the 30% level (I30%M), and a 27 kg ha−1 yield increase for manual irrigation at the 55% level (I55%M), which would explain in part the smaller yields from the automatic treatments at the 30% and 55% irrigation levels (I30%A and I55%A, respectively) in 2009.

The Bonferroni t-test was used to test for significant differences among means. The overall means are based on data grouped by irrigation method. Mean values compared between irrigation method within a treatment amount for each variety of sorghum followed by the same lower case letter in each row are not significantly different (p < 0.05). Mean values within each irrigation method (manual vs. automatic) that are not significantly different are followed by the same capital letter in the columns for each section. The ‘Combined’ column is an analysis of data grouped by irrigation treatment level and the mean values followed by the same capital letter are not significantly different.

In 2010, there was no significant difference between the two irrigation-scheduling methods when comparing overall mean biomass and dry grain yield, WUE, and IWUE responses for the automatic and manual treatment plots (Table 5). Moreover, biomass and dry grain yield, ETc, WUE and IWUE were not significantly different between irrigation methods within the same treatment amount. Given these results and the non-uniform initial conditions in 2009, we conclude that there was no important difference between the Manual and Automatic scheduling methods. 3.3.2. Differences across irrigation amount treatments To investigate biomass, dry grain yield, WUE, and IWUE across different irrigation amount treatments, analyses were performed on data from all treatment plots for a given year (Table 5). In 2009, biomass, dry grain yields, and ETc were significantly affected by irrigation levels. The greatest WUE was in the 55% treatment although not significantly different from the I80% treatment plots. These results are similar to those reported by Colaizzi et al. (2004) in that grain sorghum irrigated at levels of 100% and 75% of ET produced yields that were not significantly different. The greatest IWUE occurred in the I55% treatment plots, yet they were not significantly different than the I30% treatment plots. In 2010, biomass and dry grain yields were significantly greater in the highest irrigated treatment plots (80% and 55%) as compared with the deficit treatments of 30% and 0%. Crop water use and WUE were significantly greater between irrigated (I80%, I55%, and I30%) and non-irrigated plots (I0%), but there were no significant differences among the irrigated treatment plots. The largest average yield increase for both sorghum varieties occurred between the 30% and 55% amount treatments, where the average yield increase was 2.4 Mg ha−1 in 2009. These results are similar to findings reported by Schneider and Howell (1999) for grain sorghum irrigated between 25% and 50% of crop ET at Bushland, TX. Sorghum was less responsive in 2010 to different irrigation levels as compared to the previous year, i.e. crop water use and WUE was not significantly different between the three irrigation treatment levels (80%, 55%, and 30%). The average increase in yield between the 30% and 55% treatment amounts was reduced by 45%. Soil water levels were similar for these treatments through DOY 216 for both irrigation methods (Fig. 4). Download : Download full-size image Fig. 4. Average soil water depletion at the root zone for the irrigation levels in the 30%, 55%, and 80% treatment levels for both the automatic and manual control methods in years (top) 2009; and 2010 (bottom). 3.4. CWSI-TT and soil water depletion In 2009, regression analysis of the CWSI-TT and Df revealed a significant relationship: CWSI-TT = 740.36Df + 118.06, r2 = 0.34, F = 14.71, and p < 0.0001. The CWSI-TT index declined after irrigations, as expected, and was nearly zero on cloudy days and days with precipitation (Fig. 5a). In the 2009 growing season, Df was lowest on August 1 (DOY 213) after 32 mm of rainfall and increased to its greatest amount on August 8 (DOY 220), during the later vegetative stage. Soil waster depletion also rose after the onset of the reproductive stage (August 18, DOY 230) and during the non-irrigation period between September 12 and 21 (DOY 255 and 264) when no irrigation signals were triggered. Download : Download full-size image Fig. 5. The CWSI-TT values plotted with the average fraction of depletion in the root zone (to a depth of 1.5 m) for the I80%A treatment plots in: for SS variety sorghum in 2009 (top diagram); and LS variety sorghum in 2010 (bottom diagram). Early in 2010, DOY 196–198, during the vegetative phase, mean fractional soil water depletion was low (0.15), while the CWSI-TT index was at high levels, i.e. 550–800 min (Fig. 5b). As mentioned previously, this was likely due to the IRTs viewing soil background in addition to vegetative cover in the early portion of the irrigation season. Fractional soil water depletion increased at the reproductive stage (near flowering) from DOY 209 to 216 and then again prior to the soft dough stage. Variation of the CWSI-TT followed this pattern and was recorded as increasing from DOY 213 to 216. Between DOY 233 and DOY 238, as soil water depletion increased the CWSI-TT trended upwards but was also impacted by irrigations and rainfall. Late in the irrigation season from DOY 242 to 246, soil water depletion decreased, but the CWSI-TT remained high. This may be due to IRTs viewing heads of drying grain (with no transpiration) more so than transpiring canopy leaves. There was a significant relationship between the CWSI-TT and Df in 2010 after DOY 210 and through DOY 254; CWSI-TT = 783.9 × CWSI-TT + 139.4, r2 = 0.22, F = 6.5, p < 0.02. However, the relationship was not as strong as 2009, which may have been due to the smaller changes in Df over the 2010 growing season. Disadvantages to using the CWSI-TT was that cloud cover could reduce irrigation triggering at any time during the growing season, and IRT temperature readings could be influenced by changing crop aspect (e.g., leaf orientation and erectness, head formation) throughout the growing season. This problem motivates future research into multi-band sensor systems that may allow recognition of soil background and plant aspect changes that may allow corresponding qualification or correction of thermal IR data. Soil water sensors and soil water balance equations (estimated from ETo) could be used to augment decisions for irrigation scheduling with the CWSI-TT and may be helpful in the case where it takes a pivot more than two days to traverse a field. 4. Conclusions A theoretical CWSI index summed over daylight hours was investigated for its effectiveness as a trigger for automatic irrigation scheduling of two varieties of grain sorghum. Crop biomass and dry grain yield responses from the Automatic treatment plots compared well to those from manual scientific irrigation scheduling based on soil water content, in the highest irrigation treatment level (I80%) in 2009 and in all irrigation treatment levels in 2010. Soil water variability early in growing season 2009 affected yield production, and may have affected the results at the two lower irrigation amounts (I50% and I30%). Automatic irrigations generally occurred every 2–4 days after the crop was past boot stage. The constant irrigation applications in the amount of twice peak daily crop water usage on a frequent basis with LEPA drag socks was a favorable method for irrigation delivery to both early and late maturing grain sorghum. A shortcoming of using the CWIS-TT, which is common to all thermal-based indices using radiometric sensors, is that false positive irrigation triggers may be generated early in the season, which could lead to over irrigation. Although soil water variability confounded some results in 2009, yields from the automatic 80% treatment plots (plots from which the CWSI-TT were calculated over daylight hours) were similar to scientific irrigation scheduling using a neutron probe in the manual 80% treatment plots for both years and for all treatment levels in 2010. This supports the use of the CWSI-TT as an effective method for irrigation scheduling of grain sorghum. While farmers are not likely to use a neutron probe to take soil water measurements, they may invest in moving sprinkler systems that are outfitted with sensor networks for automated control and continuous plant water status feedback as a means to manage irrigation scheduling. Using the automated system would alleviate the additional time and expense required to drive to each pivot field and take soil water measurements on a weekly basis. Further research is necessary to investigate whether the CWSI-TT is effective for irrigation scheduling of other crops in this region and to determine which decision support methods would best augment plant feedback irrigation scheduling.

INTRODUCTION
Without a doubt, agriculture is the most important source of
livelihood in Bangladesh. As the world’s population expands,
increased agricultural output is essential. The amount of
fresh water and appropriate fertilizer used in irrigation must
be raised in order to maintain enhanced farm productivity.
Unintentional water waste happens when water consumption
is not planned. Choosing the right fertilizer for a particular
farmland is likewise a difficult challenge for our farmers.
This demonstrates the urgent need for alternatives to reduce
water waste and appropriate fertilizer choices without placing
farmers under stress. In the Electronic age, agriculture is rapidly
becoming a data-intensive sector, with farmers collecting and
analyzing massive amounts of data from various sources (e.g.,
sensors, farming machinery, etc.) to obtain vital information
and become more efficient in production. Technology nowadays
has advanced a lot. With the help of Machine Learning and
IoT devices, a drastic change can be made possible in the
agricultural industry [1].
With the release of open-source Arduino devices and the
availability of different sensors, it is now possible to build
devices that can monitor soil moisture content and irrigate
fields or landscapes as needed. Machine learning algorithms
are used to assess various agricultural data and may readily
forecast which decisions should be made to improve farmland
productivity. In comparison to their previous farming ways,
the farmer may easily combine ML and IoT into their farming
and create an automated system that is more time effective
and less risky. Here, Fig. 1 depicts the difference between the
traditional system with the ML-based agricultural framework.
Wireless Sensor Networks(WSNs) technologies have a
major challenge with limited energy. Many research in WSNs
has also been focused on reliable energy supply to extend
the survival time of limited power sources in a network [2].
Energy harvesting techniques are used to overcome the energy-
scarcity problem of WSNs. Energy harvesting is a process in
which energy is obtained from the environment as renewable
energy sources like solar radiation, Radio Frequency (RF),
wind, geothermal, electromagnetic (EM) waves, hydro, etc.,
and is stored effectively for driving various applications systems
which may include wireless sensor networks (WSNs) [3] [4].
Therefore, it can be used to operate the devices of the embedded
system for a reliable energy supply.
Security is one of the most critical aspects of IoT, as it
deals with the protection of data and devices from unauthorized
access, use, disclosure, disruption, modification, or destruction
[5]. Encryption mechanisms are mostly used to ensure that
data is securely transmitted. But, regularly used encryption
algorithms such as DES, AES, and RSA will be heavy for small-
scale embedded systems. Therefore, blockchain technology can
be used as a lightweight calculation technique to reliably operate
and secure an IoT system[6] [7].
This paper presents the latest IoT-ML-driven intelligent agri-
cultural management and provides a substantial new research
direction. The central insight of this work is to offer possible
solutions to farming hazards while providing a combined
framework. Some significant contributions of this paper are
outlined as follows:
•
Smart Management: Traditional agricultural manage-
ment is strengthened with edge-cutting technologies
(i.e., IoT and Machine Learning).
•
Distant Monitoring and Controlling: Farmers can
monitor and control irrigation management from a
distance in terms of sensor-based real-time data.
•
Intelligent Decision Making: Our machine learning
model provides substantial water control management

and fertilizer utilization direction for a minimum
resource with a maximum throughput based on the
data collected from the farming field.
•
Block chain Based Security System: Our proposed
solution uses blockchain technology to create a secure
and decentralized network that can ensure data integrity
and protect data from denial of service (DDoS) attacks,
and man-in-the-middle (MITM) attacks.
•
Energy Harvesting: To ensure a continuous energy
supply for the IoT system, we have introduced energy
harvesting technology which reduces the hassle for the
farmers of using extra batteries.

provides an overview of existing works related to our proposed
framework. Section III provides a detailed description of the
hardware that have used in this research. Section IV discusses
the proposed IoT-ML-based smart agricultural framework.
Section V discusses the blockchain-based security of our system.
Section VI presents the real-life implementation of our project.
Next, Section VII illustrates and analyzes the experimental
result from our machine learning models. Section VIII future
research directions in this field of research. Finally, Section IX
gives a brief conclusion.

RELATED RESEARCH
Several ML-IoT-based researches and project works on
agriculture systems have been carried out till today.
In [8], For remote sensing and smart agriculture, Ullo et al.
presented a review of research on the developments in smart
sensors and IoT. They put forth some suggestions for IoT
advancements that will support researchers and agriculturalists
in their work.
In [9], Samuel et al. analyzed numerous techniques for crop
selection, crop sowing, weed detection, and system monitoring.
They have recommended different image processing methods
for weed and leaf detection and evaluated the benefits and
drawbacks of each. Drone implementation has been considered
for real-time monitoring and seed planting. However, no actual
implementation is shown in this research; they have only
reviewed several smart agricultural strategies.
In [10], they analyze soil moisture levels and apply auto
irrigation to the crops. In order to eliminate the need for human
involvement, this system also senses temperature, humidity, and
the presence of impediments in the targeted region. These data
are accessible to the user via mobile from the cloud. By giving
the motor driver the command YES/NO based on this data, the
user can control the operation of the motor.
In [11], they use a cloud-based architecture and the Internet
of Things to examine a smart irrigation system. This system
is designed to measure soil moisture and humidity and then
process this data in the cloud using a variety of machine-
learning techniques. Farmers receive accurate information
regarding water content regulations. If farmers apply smart
irrigation, they can reduce their water usage.
In [12], they use IoT and machine learning to predict
late blight disease in potatoes and tomatoes prior to the first
occurrence. This will send farmers a warning message on the
precise time to apply the protective pesticides.
In [13], for yield prediction, they present a hybrid ML
model using IoT. They use a two-tier ML approach named
aKNCN and ELM-mBOA.In the first tire, they estimate soil
quality and in the second tier, they predict the crop yield.
In agriculture, supply, and demand have always been crucial
issues for sustainable production management. To address
and provide a possible solution to this problem, M. Lee et
al. proposed an IoT-based controlled agricultural production
management [14]. The authors developed a decision support
system to predict specific criteria based on IoT-enabled sensor
data.
A cloud-based real-time data analysis model is proposed
in [15] instead of dew-point humidity. In this regard, they
designed a CMM index measurement model to evaluate the
crops’ comfort level of relative humidity levels.
To increase the crop production rate, real-time data analysis
based on an artificial model is proposed by Y. Zhou et al. in [16].
The current innovation trend expects farmers to use IoT and
technology to identify the organization of those difficulties they
face, such as water management deficiencies in agriculture
and productivity concerns. This research has attempted to
build dazzling agricultural cultivation patterns utilizing IoT
technologies. IoT has significantly improved agriculture by
analyzing various agricultural difficulties and issues.
An IOT-based intelligent technology for agriculture that can
sense soils and environmental factors was proposed by Abhijith
H. V. et al. in [17]. In order to identify the urgent needs for
optimal crop growth, they applied data mining techniques to
the sensed data.

lance system that employs IoT and deep learning to identify

farm encroachment.
The purpose of the study Wongpatikaseree et al. [19], is
to propose a traceability system, summarizing and presenting
observed data from the smart farm.
For smart farming, Deden Ardiansyah et al. [20] suggested
a WSN Server that can handle and optimize agricultural data.
They instantly store the data in the database, which is afterward
represented as a website and accessible through the Internet
network.
Automation in agriculture is a basic need for remote
control-based agricultural management to ensure sustainable
development in this field of research. In this regard, L.
Vijayaraja et al. proposed an IoT-based monitoring system
using wireless communication networks in [21]. The power
supply management used in this framework is entirely from the
renewable energy source that provides a cost-effective model
for sensor-based decision management in intelligent farming.
In [22], Yaw-Wen Kuo, et al. presented a Long-range IoT
system where they developed four types of IoT units based on
Long-range technology. They employed pH, ORP, and EC in
Type A and water, air, and humidity sensors in Type B. In type
C, the pump can be operated remotely, and in type D, a water
flow or water meter-controlling system is provided.
They presented a cloud service-based architecture in [23]
that includes a variety of services for farmers, including agri-
food-related services, financing, fostering, warehouse manage-
ment, etc. They have suggested interactive video conferencing,
voice-based services, text messaging, web portal services, and
more under the heading of cloud services.
A key component of practicing smart agriculture is precision
agriculture. In this context, Patil et al. [24] suggested a system
that measures soil moisture using sensors for temperature,
humidity, and soil moisture. Additionally, they offered various
methods for highlighting the issue of data loss.
In [25], Quasim et al. use blockchain techniques in smart
healthcare systems to ensure the security of healthcare data.
It provides the security, privacy, and efficiency of the data in
transmission between wearable sensors and Internet of Things
(IoT) devices.
In [26], Makhdoom et al. made a blockchain-based frame-
work for privacy-preserving and secure data sharing in smart
cities. The system secures data sharing by segmenting the
blockchain network into different channels, where each channel
consists of a limited number of authorized organizations and
handles a particular type of data, such as financial information,
health data, smart car data, or data related to smart energy.
Additionally, smart contracts contain access control rules that
regulate who has access to the data of users within a channel.
Many different types of intelligent agricultural systems were
developed in the earlier work. Some of these current systems
are tabulated in Table I.

PROPOSED FRAMEWORK
A. Circuit Diagram and Connections
We used Fritzing10, an open-source hardware online appli-
cation to make a schematic pin (Fig. 11) diagram of our smart
agriculture system.
We used ESP8266 NodeMCU V3, with an integrated WIFI
module as our processing hardware component. The system
connects an analog capacitive soil moisture sensor and an
analog pH sensor using multiplexing to the A0 analog input
of NodeMCU, a photo-resistor known as Light Dependent
Resistors (LDR) sensor to a D3 digital input, and a raindrop
sensor with rain board and control module to D0 input Pin. In
addition, the device is connected with a D3 output pin to a DC
5V micro submersible mini water pump with the relay. We used

the NodeMCU’s 5V VU pin to power the Motor and Relay.
However the LDR Sensor and Rain Drop Sensor, only need
a 3.3V supply, the Capacitive Soil Moisture Sensor and pH
Sensor need 5V. The GND pin serves as the common ground
for every sensor. A solar panel system that is coupled to a
9-volt battery backup powers the system.
B. Working Principle
We have divided our proposed framework into different
subparts and each part’s working procedure is given below. The
overall working procedure is depicted in Fig. 12.
1) Collecting Data From Sensor: We used four different
types of sensors, including capacitive soil moisture sensors, pH
sensors, MH-RD rain sensors, and LDR sensors, to execute
smart IoT agriculture. We can estimate how much water is in
the soil with the aid of a soil moisture sensor. A pH sensor,
which ranges from 0 to 14, allows us to determine the water’s
acidity or alkalinity. Water turns acidic if the value falls below
7, else it is alkanoic. Consider levels 5.5 to 7 to be ideal for
growing crops. We can choose the best fertilizer for the soil
with the aid of a pH sensor.
Basically, a rain sensor is used to detect rain. A rain board
that can detect rain and a control module that can compare

analog and digital values are both included. The raindrop sensor
aids in our selection of how to operate the motor. The LDR
sensor, which is used to detect the presence of light, has also
been employed.
Now, each of these sensors is linked to a node MCU board
in our project, and data from the sensors is uploaded to the node
MCU board and shown on the serial monitor of the Arduino
UNO editor and
2) Sending Data to Cloud Server: The node MCU board
receives all sensor data, which we would love to save in the
cloud in order to control for remote distance. We have utilized
Firebase as a cloud server. We linked the Firebase authentication
and real-time database URL that we built for our project with
the Arduino UNO script in order to integrate Firebase with
Node MCU.
All data is sent as a parent-child combination to Firebase.
All of the sensor data is sent from the node MCU as a child
of Smart Irrigation, which we have constructed as Parent. The
Firebase stores the child value as a key-value pair.
3) Data Collection: The Firebase’s database contains all of
the sensor data, which is compiled as a CSV file. Four columns
make up our dataset: pH, LDR, Rain, and Moisture. Nearly
820 data are in our dataset. Only integer values are accepted in
the Moisture column here, whereas string values are accepted
in the Rain and LDR columns.
4) Data Pre-processing: Data can be often inconsistent.
Missing values or values out of range is typical. So, the dataset
needs some pre-processing before it can be used to train any
model [27]. For this reason, we have considered three such
cases.
•
Missing Value Handling: While exploring our dataset,
we observed humidity, raining status, daylight status,
and pH level fields with missing values. Therefore, we
have filled them with average values of the respective
field.
•
One Hot Decoder: Label encoding is simply the
process of converting each value in a column to a
number. By using label encoding, we have converted
the categorical text data into model-understandable
numerical data. We had to use the label encoding to
get our dataset ready for our model.
•
Abnormal Data Handling: Some data contain abnor-
mal values. For example, the range of the temperature
in our dataset falls between -20 to 30 degrees Celsius.
However, we have even found some data above and
below this range. Data tuples with these abnormalities
have been dropped from the dataset.
•
Normalization: Normalization is used to increase the
accuracy of models [28]. It is simply the process of
having all the data on the same scale. We have used
www.ijacsa.thesai.org
991 | P a g e
(IJACSA) International Journal of Advanced Computer Science and Applications,
Vol. 14, No. 7, 2023
temperature, pressure, relative humidity, and pressure
as features to train our model. The features used
to teach a machine-learning algorithm have different
ranges of values. This can badly affect the machine’s
learning ability. To solve this problem, we have
standardized the feature values so that all the features
stand equal in their representation. By normalization,
all the feature values are mapped in the range between
0 and 1.
5) Machine Learning Model: The developed architecture is
a Neural Network (NN) based because of its great accuracy. The
fundamental advantage of NN over classical machine learning
models is that it recognizes significant traits automatically
and without human intervention. It’s a feed-forward NN with
parameters using the back-propagation algorithm and stochastic
gradient descent. Distinct processing layers serve different
purposes. The output of the feature map is produced by
conventional layers, which conduct linear convolution between
a series of input tensors and filters. The nonlinear transformation
is performed using the ReLU, which is the most widely
employed activation function. The activation function for the
fully connected layer to the end must be careful on the tasks.
Batch normalization and an activation layer are performed after
each convolution.
ReLU = max(0, X)
(1)
d(x) = activation(wx + b)
(2)
Dropout(x, p) = (x : prob., p) (x : prob., 1 − p)
(3)
S(x) =
1
1 + e−x
(4)
6) Mobile Application Development: A smart remote con-
trol application can ease our maximum task [29]. We have used
the MIT app inventor to make the mobile application that will
be connected to our system and by using this app we can do
the following task
•
Fertilizer Suggestion: By analyzing the pH value, the
app may suggest which fertilizer is best for a given
soil. The app will recommend some alkanoic fertilizer
if the pH value rises to help reduce the rising pH value
and vice versa. Algorithm 1 depicts how the fertilizer
is suggested in our system.
•
Visualization of Predicted Results: In order to predict
whether the motor would turn off or not based on
the moisture, LDR, and raindrop sensor values, we
construct a neural network model and link it with
our mobile app. Algorithm 2 depicts how the remote
controlling is done to control the motor in our system.
•
Remote Motor Controlling: The farmer can use the
app to control the motor from any distant or remote

tion

6. Send Predicted results to the mobile phone.
7. Wait for user input from the mobile phone.

Take an automated action according to the

location based on the prediction outcome. When the
farmer presses the off button, it sends a value of 0 to
the firebase, which then passes this signal on to the
node MCU via the wifi module and sets the pin value
to the LOW, so turning off the motor.
V.
BLOCKCHAIN-BASED SMART-AGRI
Blockchain was described as a data structure using asym-
metric encryption algorithms and hash functions to ensure
that data tampering and forgery are impossible [30] [31] [32].
Every smart system needs to be taken under the shelter of a
security system to avoid getting an external attack. Our smart
agricultural system is public so any intruder can make attacks
such as DoS attacks to crash the system, and spoofing to alter
the control. In the IoT environment where high computational
encryption, decryption, and high-level security are not possible.

992 | P a g e
(IJACSA) International Journal of Advanced Computer Science and Applications,
Vol. 14, No. 7, 2023
Therefore, We are implanting blockchain technologies into our
smart agricultural system through which we are capable to
maintain high throughput, low latency, low communication
cost, and tamper-proof and traceability. Blockchain refers to a
distributed ledger system where data or transactions are stored
in blocks that are connected to each other through making
hash which can not only serve as unique IDs but also prove
the integrity of the blocks. The hash of the previous block is
used to make a hash for the next block along with its data.
If any intruder wants to tamper or alter the block data, all
the consecutive block hash will be changed. Therefore, any
intruder attempts to alter the data or spoof the blockchain will
not be possible.
In this system, we consider nodeMCU, Firebase cloud, and
mobile app as nodes. In order to avoid altering data in the
network, we are using blockchain technology. When any node
wants to send data to other nodes, it encapsulates the data
into a block along with its hash values (SHA256) and nodeID
then adds it to the blockchain. All these nodes will contain the
blockchain locally. After adding the block, the node sends it
to the cloud through the network. We are not using any PoW,
PoS, or accountant selection algorithms which is not possible
because of a very small amount of nodes and our nodeMCU
has very limited capabilities to run these algorithms (Algorithm
3). When the block is sent to the cloud, I validate the block by
checking all the hashes of the previous block along with the
nodeID. If it gets any error, the node will consider the block
as from an attacker and reject the block from adding to the
chain. Fig. 13 depicts the blockchain in our system.

pH sensor measurement, this button tells us whether the soil
is alkanoic or acidic when we click it. We used the decision
tree algorithm to determine the ideal fertilizer for a given soil
based on its quality.
The farmer can view the data from the moisture, raindrop,
and daylight sensors in our app. Our program uses a neural
network model that we built and implemented to forecast
whether the motor would be on or off. We can operate our
motor using the two buttons in our app labeled “ON" and
“OFF". The motor status in the firebase changes to 1 when we
press the “ON" button, and the firebase sends a signal to the
nodeMCU board, which then turns the motor on automatically.
And that is how we can use our mobile app to implement
remote control.

EXPERIMENTAL RESULT ANALYSIS
A. System Evaluation
In Table II, we have shown the difference between our
system and the existing systems. The criterion based on which
we have shown the differences are remote monitor control, data
visualization, customized mobile application, machine learning
integrated framework, creating own database, central cloud
database, pH-based fertilizer suggestions, Machine learning
model development, and full automation. The references from
[11] to [24] there is no such system that has implemented all the
criteria in their system. But we have successfully implemented
all the criteria in our systems.
B. Machine Learning Model Evaluation
Our deep learning neural network is implemented with
the help of our own dataset. We split the dataset into 80-20
ratios for training and validation purposes. The heat map of the
features columns is illustrated in Fig. 16. We fit our gradient
descent neural network within the data set. The input layer
of the neural network receives 3 input lines from the features
column, namely, rain status, moisture level, and daylight status
respectively. Then we add one dense layer with 16 neurons and
the activation function as ReLu. The next layer is a dropout
layer with a 20% drop rate. Next, we add another dense layer
with 8 neurons and apply the activation function as ReLu.
Then we add another dropout layer with a 20% drop rate.
Finally, for the output layer, we add another dense layer with
a single neuron with is satiable for binary classification (i.e.
motor on-off decision) with activation function as Sigmoid.
The experimental result of our model is represented in
Table III while showing the validation loss rate as binary cross
entropy and validation accuracy level in different epochs. Our
model successfully outcomes a stable level of accuracy for
the different epochs. We got almost 89.5% accuracy in our
experimental set-up.

FUTURE RESEARCH DIRECTION
For future smart irrigation management, several issues must
be addressed as follows:
•
Low-latency in Real-Time Application: The moni-
toring and controlling mobile application must be able
to transmit real-time data to the farmers or its entity
while ensuring a low latency network.
•
High Bandwidth: To facilitate a buffer-less transmis-
sion, we need to ensure maximum bandwidth level to
the transmission process.
•
Connectivity: To meet the high communication de-
mands of future IoT-ML integrated irrigation systems,
reliable synchronization between linked autos would
be required.
•
Deployment of Network Elements: When a network
has a high enough number of nodes, its overall
performance increases. Because network equipment
deployment is costly, it is vital to have the required
number of network components up and running as
quickly as feasible.
•
Augmented Reality: AR is a multimedia application
that mixes real-world scenes into virtual scenes and
superimposes virtual scenes over real-world scenes to
supplement traditional real-image information. This
technology has the potential to help farmers become
more aware of the app’s functionality.
•
Edge Computing: This networking approach is built
on a network control layer that is logically centralized.

CONCLUSION
We have put forth an integrated solution that enables
farmers to solve the challenges that limit their production
and profitability by utilizing cutting-edge technologies like
machine learning (ML), the Internet of Things (IoT), and
blockchain. Through user-friendly mobile applications and
a secure cloud database, this model, implemented with a
generated database, offers helpful insights and recommendations
to farmers, including pesticide usage and water motor control.
Real-time monitoring and data collecting is made possible
by the integration of IoT devices, enabling accurate decision-
making and assuring optimal resource allocation. Incorpo-
rating blockchain technology also improves data traceability,
transparency, and integrity, fostering trust and accountability
throughout the agricultural ecosystem. Farmers may gain from
higher productivity, decreased expenses, and enhanced general
agricultural management by implementing our Smart-Agri
framework. They can obtain up-to-date, accurate information,
make decisions that will increase productivity and reduce
waste, and improve their agricultural techniques. We have
applied the gradient descent neural network model for water
control management and achieved up to 89.5% accuracy. In
addition, the suggested structure creates chances for cooperation,
information exchange, and market access, all of which help
the agricultural industry thrive and flourish sustainably.
In the future, the framework’s scalability, and its inter-
operability can all be explored through more research and
development in this area, along with potential problems like
connectivity problems and data privacy issues. We can build an
ecosystem that really revolutionizes the agriculture sector by
continually improving and building upon these technological
achievements, making it more intelligent, efficient, and robust
in the face of changing global issues.

  Explanation: This study evaluated the performance of seven irrigation scheduling algorithms for drip-irrigated apple trees in a semi-arid region of central Washington. The algorithms were based on a range of plant, soil, and weather-based approaches. The performance of the algorithms was compared in terms of the total amount of water applied, root zone soil water status, plant water status, cost, and simplicity of implementation.

The TTT and CWSI algorithms, which rely on canopy temperature signals, showed promising performance in terms of delivering the right amount of water to the plants and avoiding water stress, while also having the advantage of being fully automatic. However, the TTT algorithm had a drawback in that it can issue false stress signals on humid days, while the CWSI algorithm requires more upfront investment in terms of hardware and setup.

The WB algorithm, which is based on a simple soil water balance, also showed good performance, but it does not have the ability to respond to plant feedback and may lead to over or under-irrigation if the estimates of crop water use are incorrect. The SOIL and SL + WB algorithms, which rely on soil water tension sensors, failed to deliver enough water to the trees, resulting in severe water stress and impaired growth.

In conclusion, the study found that the TTT and CWSI algorithms are promising options for automatic irrigation scheduling of drip-irrigated apple trees, while the WB algorithm is a good choice for simpler and lower-cost implementations. The SOIL and SL + WB algorithms are not recommended due to their poor performance in delivering adequate water to the trees.

Abstract Seven irrigation scheduling algorithms and an automatic control system along with a wireless network of soil, thermal and weather sensors were developed and assessed in Prosser, WA in the growing season of 2013. The system was comprised of six wireless sensor and valve actuating nodes installed across an apple orchard, a central base station made up of a transceiver connected to a laptop, and a graphical user interface (GUI). The irrigation algorithms/treatments included the time-temperature threshold (TTT), crop water stress index with dynamic threshold (CWSI), soil-based using granular matrix sensors (SOIL), weather-based using a temperature-only-based evapotranspiration (ET) model and soil water balance (WB), a combination of SOIL and WB (SL + WB), a conventional irrigation practice used in the region (CNTRL), and soil-based using a neutron probe (NP) as benchmark. Different treatments were compared based on the total irrigation water (It) applied during the season. They were also compared based on simplicity and expense for a grower to implement. Soil water content (θs) and stem water potential (ψstem) were monitored in a number of treatment plots. The total applied water for CNTRL was significantly higher than all other treatments (p < 0.001). The thermal-based TTT and CWSI treatments applied the same amount of water as NP and WB (p < 0.001). CWSI and TTT substantially reduced water applied (70%) while maintaining ψstem within the non-stressed range. In addition, θs in the treatment plots of TTT and CWSI did not exceed the maximum allowed deficit recommended for apple trees (MAD of 50%) showing a strong agreement with NP. The SOIL and SL + WB treatments resulted in tangible under-irrigation as leaf drop, decreased leaf turgidity, growth reduction and abnormally small fruits were seen. Among all the strategies, WB seemed to bear the characteristics of being economical, easy to implement and fairly accurate. Our preliminary results also support the use of wireless sensor network for automatic irrigation management of drip-irrigated apple trees.

Introduction A sound choice of irrigation scheduling method can lead to increased profit and water savings for farmers, reduced environmental impacts and sustainable agriculture (Smith et al., 1996). Proper management of irrigation water to maintain balanced soil water content is crucial for health and productivity of apple trees (Black et al., 2008). To date, research has offered a large number of approaches to detect water stress, compute crop water needs, and automatically schedule irrigation (Al-Kaisi et al., 1997, Orta et al., 2003, Jones, 2004, Farahani et al., 2007, Vellidis et al., 2008, McCready et al., 2009, Ko and Piccinni, 2009, Migliaccio et al., 2010, Romero et al., 2012). Irrigation scheduling approaches may be grouped into three main categories (Zhang and Pierce, 2013): (i) monitoring of soil water status (soil-based), (ii) soil water balance calculations using weather information (weather-based), and (iii) sensing of crop water stress (plant-based). Automation of irrigation has been evaluated in a number of row plants including tomato, onion and bell pepper using soil sensors measuring tension (Thompson et al., 2007, Enciso et al., 2009) or volumetric water content (Zotarelli et al., 2009). Vellidis et al. (2008) developed and evaluated a real-time, smart soil moisture and temperature sensor array prototype for scheduling irrigation in cotton. Romero et al. (2012) reported that the approach of combining weather data with soil moisture signal could increase irrigation efficiency in almond trees. Tensiometers have been used by Meron et al. (2001) as a feedback to manage irrigation of apple trees. Soil water tension sensors provide a direct measure of plant water status (Pedro Vaza et al., 2013). Watermark™ sensors (Irrometer Co., Riverside, CA) have been identified as good indicators of irrigation start and stop (Leib and Matthews, 1999); however, sensor accuracy is contingent to site-specific calibration (Varble and Chávez, 2011). The calibration need of individual sensors can make the use of Watermark™ sensors tedious and unattractive to most farmers, thus very often they are used with only factory calibration. Neutron probe is a scientific-based method for precise measurement of soil water content and has shown to be a reliable reference for other irrigation scheduling techniques (Evett et al., 2009, O’Shaughnessy et al., 2012b). How change in weather parameters can affect plant water needs can be predicted using an evapotranspiration (ET) model. Frequently used ET models are the Penman-Monteith (PM) (Allen et al., 1998) and Hargreaves (Hargreaves and Samani, 1985) equations. The Hargreaves model requires fewer data than the PM model and can provide estimations of ET using air temperature as sole input (Allen et al., 1998). The most common approach to estimate actual water use of apple trees (ETc) is to multiply the reference ET (ETr) by a crop-specific coefficient (Kc) (Lakso, 2003). Osroosh et al., 2014, Osroosh et al., 2015a developed models based on infrared thermometry and the energy budget of a single apple leaf to estimate the actual and potential transpiration of whole tree. However, like the PM model, they require a wide range of input data. The weather-based irrigation scheduling has a long history of implementation using commercial irrigation controllers for both research (Davis et al., 2009, Davis and Dukes, 2010, Cardenas-Lailhacar et al., 2008, Cardenas-Lailhacar et al., 2010) and commercial applications; however, few research studies have investigated its application on fruit trees. In a study by Kisekka et al. (2010), ET-based irrigation scheduling saved significant quantities of water compared with a calendar-based grower’s approach of irrigation in a Carambola Orchard. Leaf water potential measured using a pressure bomb has long been used to monitor crop water status and as trigger point for irrigation (Stegman et al., 1976, Turner, 1988). However, this method is very tedious, labor-intensive and not appropriate for automation. The use of infrared temperature of plant canopies along with a number of ancillary meteorological measurements is an alternative plant-based approach (Cohen et al., 2005). Irrigation scheduling systems based on a feedback from crop have shown to outperform scientific-based irrigation scheduling using the neutron probe in row crops (O’Shaughnessy et al., 2015). Various thermal-based scheduling algorithms have been developed such as the crop water stress index (CWSI: Jackson et al., 1981, Jackson et al., 1988) and time-temperature threshold (TTT: Wanjura et al., 1992, Wanjura et al., 1995, Upchurch et al., 1996). CWSI compares the measured canopy-air temperature differences (ΔTm) with theoretically/empirically determined temperature differences of a non-transpiring (ΔTu) and well-watered (ΔTl) plants as defined by Jackson et al. (1981): (1) Different varieties of the CWSI have been suggested over the years including the CWSI and time threshold (CWSI-TT: O’Shaughnessy et al., 2012b), integrated CWSI (iCWSI: O’Shaughnessy et al., 2013) and CWSI-DT (Osroosh et al., 2015b). CWSI has been rarely used to schedule irrigation in trees (Osroosh et al., 2015b) and more often to detect water stress (Testi et al., 2008, Wang and Gartung, 2010, Paltineanu et al., 2013, Agam et al., 2013, Berni et al., 2009, Osroosh et al., 2016). The CWSI might be affected by many unwanted factors such as dust or passing clouds (O’Shaughnessy et al., 2012b); however, it has proven to be reliable if integrated into a robust algorithm accounting for these temporary conditions (Osroosh et al., 2015b). The TTT method, also patented as “BIOTIC”, requires a “time threshold” and a “temperature threshold.” The temperature threshold is the optimal leaf temperature for enzyme activity determined in lab. The time threshold is the accumulated time above the temperature threshold for non-stressed crop in specific climate calculated using experimental/simulated data. O’Shaughnessy and Evett (2010) carried out automatic irrigation experiments on cotton using the TTT algorithm in Texas. Peters and Evett (2008) used the TTT method to automate water delivery to the center pivot-irrigated plots of soybean. To our knowledge, no reports are available on irrigation scheduling of woody fruit trees using the TTT approach. Nowadays, some growers rely on wireless sensor networks (WSN) to obtain information remotely on a wide range of parameters but rarely to automatically schedule irrigations (O’Shaughnessy et al., 2013). In research, WSNs have been employed to collect weather, soil and environmental information using soil moisture, temperature, or agro-meteorological sensors, and to control a variety of irrigation systems (Coates and Delwiche, 2009, Kim and Evans, 2009, O’Shaughnessy et al., 2015, Ojha et al., 2015). A site-specific irrigation control system uses a WSN to monitor field variables and minimize the spatial variability of irrigation. In order to make the wireless technology available to growers, Coates et al. (2013) developed and integrated a valve actuation system with a commercially-available WSN. Both wired and wireless sensors network systems have been used in automatic irrigation scheduling (Peters and Evett, 2008, O’Shaughnessy and Evett, 2010, O’Shaughnessy et al., 2012a, O’Shaughnessy et al., 2013) with the later being more flexible, convenient and economical. Besides reducing labor requirements, automatic software scheduling tools are necessary for optimizing the amount of irrigation water in response to crop development and type, and environmental conditions (Casadesús et al., 2012). The software must be user-friendly and allow for simple management of the WSN and irrigation valves by growers (Kim and Evans, 2009). Various computer software packages have been developed for monitoring soil parameters and irrigation scheduling over a wide range of irrigation systems (Stone et al., 1985, Hess, 1996, Abreu and Pereira, 2002). Kim and Evans (2009) developed decision support software to collect information from a WSN and control a site-specific linear-move irrigation system on a malting barley field. The aforementioned approaches have been widely used in research; however, farmers are still far from adopting them. They are eager to see reliable irrigation scheduling methods which are affordable and not necessarily complicated, yet accurate and suit their field and crop conditions. Our specific objectives here were to (i) develop fully automatic irrigation supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA) system, and wireless sensor network, (ii) develop computer soil-, plant-, and weather-based algorithms for scheduling irrigation of drip-irrigated apple trees, (iii) collect information on these various strategies in terms of total amount of water applied, root zone soil water status (content/tension), plant water status (stem water potential), cost and simplicity. This paper emphasizes on the plant-based approaches and presents the results of a preliminary field evaluation in a growing season in the arid region of central Washington. 2. Materials and methods 2.1. Study area and irrigation system The study was conducted in a Fuji apple orchard on the Roza Farm of the Washington State University Irrigated Agriculture Research and Extension Center near Prosser, WA (46.26°N, 119.74°W) during the irrigation period of 2013. The region was semi-arid with an average annual precipitation of 217 mm and little summer rainfall. The site’s soil was Warden Silt Loam, ∼1-m deep limited by a rocky layer to shallower depths in some plots. The average volumetric water content at field capacity, θFC, was 0.33 m3 m−3 measured as drained soil water content after a heavy irrigation event. The trees were spaced 4 m (row spacing) by 2.5 m (tree spacing) apart. In 2007, the trees were irrigated with a micro-sprinkler irrigation system (Hurricane, NaanDanJain Irrigation Ltd., Post Naan, Israel) with water emitters of 27 L h−1 spaced at 2.5 m intervals. In 2013, the irrigation system was drip tubing with two lines of pressure compensating laterals (∼0.6 m apart) of in-line 2.0 L h−1 (equivalent to 1.1 mm h−1) drippers (BlueLine® PC, The Toro Company, El Cajon, CA), spaced at 91.4 cm intervals along the laterals. In 2013, the irrigation system was configured for twenty-one irrigation zones (discussed later) and flow to each zone was controlled with a latching solenoid valve (LSV) (Irritrol, Riverside, CA). A conservative value of 85% was assumed for the efficiency of the irrigation system. 2.2. Wireless control and monitoring system A wireless control and monitoring system was developed to take measurements from in-field sensors and control the on/off time of LSVs to create zone-specific irrigation rates in the orchard (Fig. 1). The system was comprised of two main components: (1) central base station (master) including a laptop computer and graphical user interface (GUI), and (2) six slave wireless nodes (sensing and valve actuation stations). The laptop was located in a room only 50 m far from the field. A laptop cooling pad and a backup battery were used to cope with room’s high temperature during the hot summer and unexpected power blackouts, respectively. The base station also consisted of a 900 MHz spread spectrum radio (model RF401, Campbell Scientific, Logan, UT) to communicate with the nodes, and a USB mobile broadband stick (model DataJack, Inc., Dallas, TX) to provide internet access. Irrigation control was managed by the base station using the GUI developed by the authors (discussed later). Download : Download high-res image (189KB) Download : Download full-size image Fig. 1. Components of the wireless control and monitoring system: a typical wireless node (a), base laptop and graphical user interface (GUI) (b), and weather station (c). The GUI was accessed by the office computer using the Teamviewer software (d). A sensing and valve actuating node included all or some of the following sensors and components: CR10(X) datalogger, solar panel, battery, Watermark™ sensors, infrared thermometers (IRTs), shielded air temperature probe (Air Temp), 900 MHz spread spectrum radio (RF), H-bridge and latching solenoid valve (LSV). The base control was made up of a laptop computer, dongle (USB modem) and RF. A wireless node was made up of a datalogger (model CR10(X), Campbell Scientific, Logan, UT), 900 MHz spread spectrum radio (model RF401, Campbell Scientific, Logan, UT) with 3 dBi omni-directional rubber-duck antenna (L-COM Inc., North Andover, MA) to transmit data to and receive control signals from the base, 10 W solar panel (model SYP105, Instapark Co., Santa Fe Springs, CA) including voltage regulator, and 12 V, 7 Ah sealed lead acid battery. Each node controlled up to four LSVs operated by two L298 dual H-bridge motor drives (Robotshop Inc., Mirabel, Quebec). Nodes were also taking readings from a number of in-field sensors including granular matrix sensors (model Watermark 200SS, Irrometer Co., Riverside, CA), a soil temperature sensor (Model 107, Campbell Scientific, Logan, UT), shielded air temperature sensors (model 109, Campbell Scientific, Logan, UT), and industrial thermocouple infrared thermometers (model IRT/c.2: Type J, Exergen, Watertown, MA) with a field view of 35° and ±0.6 °C absolute accuracy. Depending on its location in the orchard, a node was comprised of all or only some of the aforementioned sensors. The furthest sensing and valve actuating station/node was located about 150 m far from the central base radio. The in-field sensors were scanned/sampled by the node dataloggers every 5 s and averaged every 15 min. The collected data by the nodes were then retrieved by the GUI every 15 min and time stamped. 2.3. Sensor installation and field measurements The air temperature probes were installed at a height of 2 m (in-line with trees). It is known that the rooting depth of a mature apple tree is about 70–90 cm (Atkinson, 1980) and soil water content measurements should take place from about 10 (cultivation depth) to 60 cm (0.7 times effective depth of rooting) (Black et al., 2008). Taking this into consideration, the soil temperature probe and Watermark™ sensors were installed horizontally at a depth of 30 cm placed between the drip tubing laterals about ∼1.25 m from tree trunk. The Watermark™ sensors were soaked in water for two days and then installed in a soil wetted to near saturation. All the sensors were installed at the center of plots. The near real-time agro-meteorological data (air temperature, solar radiation, relative humidity, wind speed, and rainfall) measured at Roza weather station (located about 0.5 km away from the orchard) was pulled from the Washington State AgWeatherNet website. This data was used to calculate daily ETr and provided the supplementary measurements for the CWSI and TTT algorithms (discussed later). Midday Stem water potential (Ψstem) was measured with a pressure bomb (model 615, PMS Instrument Co., Albany, OR) once per week between 13:00 and 15:00. A total of six Ψstem readings (two readings per zone/plot per sampling day) were averaged to calculate mean Ψstem corresponding to a treatment. Soil water content was measured with a field-calibrated neutron probe (503DR Hydroprobe, Campbell Pacific Nuclear, Concord, CA) on a weekly basis. Soil moisture and Ψstem measurements took place in the plots under the plant-based treatments (CWSI and TTT). An irrigation treatment was managed using the neutron probe (discussed later). The IRT installation methods, neutron probe calibration, and Ψstem measurement procedure were similar to those described by Osroosh et al. (2015b). 2.4. Irrigation scheduling algorithms The computer algorithms required for implementing seven different irrigation treatments were developed based on main plant-, soil- and weather-based irrigation scheduling approaches and included feedback and feed-forward control strategies. The irrigation scheduling treatments were (1) a soil water budget model using a temperature-only-based ET equation (WB), (2) Watermark™ soil water tension sensor (SOIL), (3) a combination of WB and SOIL algorithms (SL + WB), (4) the scientific-based method of using neutron probe (NP), (5) Canopy temperature signal and the TTT method (TTT), (6) Canopy temperature signal and the CWSI-DT method (CWSI), and (7) conventional irrigation scheduling method in the region (CNTRL). All the strategies were completely automatic except for NP in which soil moisture data collected manually. The main required inputs to the algorithms were canopy temperature (infrared) to determine crop water status, soil water tension to measure soil water availability, and meteorological data to estimate daily water needs using ET model and to calculate theoretical CWSI. These algorithm are described in the following paragraphs. 2.4.1. Soil water budget model and a temperature-only-based ET equation (WB) The algorithm was established on a simple soil water balance (Dukes et al., 2009) and daily estimations of reference ET (ETr) using the Hargreaves model (Hargreaves and Samani, 1985). Reference ET was adjusted by local crop coefficients (Kc; Karimi et al., 2013) interpolated for daily values. Daily (net) irrigation water depth (Id, mm) was calculated as the following: (2) where Re is effective rainfall, and ETc is the crop ET (ETc = KcETr), all in units of mm. ETc was determined at midnight using 24-h air temperature data obtained from sensors installed in the orchard. For simplification, the effective rainfall was assumed to be equal to the amount of rainfall from the nearby weather station. The difference between soil water content at the beginning of the season (θi) and soil water content at field capacity (θFC) was added to the irrigation depth in the first irrigation event. ET was calculated using the FAO-56 Hargreaves equation (Allen et al., 1998). Twenty years worth of historical weather data and the ASCE Standardized PM equation (Allen et al., 2005) were used to calibrate the Hargreaves model for the region. Given that the drip system had a very low discharge rate, a threshold (Ith) was set for irrigation depth. This guaranteed the amount of water applied was enough to wet the whole root zone and yet avoid deep percolation. The irrigation water depth per application day was calculated according to the following model: (3) The accumulated depth over several consecutive days had to exceed the threshold in order for the system to schedule an irrigation event. 2.4.2. Soil-based irrigation using Watermark™ sensor (SOIL) This irrigation scheduling algorithm (Fig. 2a) was developed based on soil water potential readings from a Watermark™ sensor (one sensor per plot), and dry (50% depletion) and wet (field capacity) thresholds of −80 and −30 kPa, respectively, recommended for the soil type (Black et al., 2008). The field soil was assumed to be homogenous. Previous studies in a drip-irrigated soil have shown that the overall water status can be reliably extracted from single spot measurements (Rolston et al., 1991). An irrigation event was automatically scheduled whenever soil water potential exceeded the dry threshold and stopped if it reached the wet threshold. Therefore, the amount of applied water was dependent on the time when the wet threshold was reached. Download : Download high-res image (357KB) Download : Download full-size image Fig. 2. Soil-based irrigation scheduling algorithm (SOIL) (a), and combined Watermark™ and water budget irrigation scheduling algorithm (SL + WB) (b). Varble and Chávez (2011) showed that diurnal soil temperature fluctuations could impact readings of Watermark™ sensor. A non-linear temperature compensation formula (Thompson and Armstrong, 1987) was applied to resistivity readings as the following: (4) where Rs is the measured resistance (kΩ), Ts is the soil temperature (°C), and PSW is the soil water potential (kPa). We did not field-calibrate the sensors for the soil type to comply with the common approach and ease the use of the sensors. 2.4.3. Combination of WB and SOIL (SL + WB) This algorithm was the combination of the WB and SOIL algorithms similar to the algorithm proposed by Casadesús et al. (2012). SL + WB combines a compensating mechanism (feedback control) based on soil sensor readings and an estimation of water demand by a water balance method (feed-forward control) (Fig. 2b). SL + WB used soil water tension data to correct the ET model prediction of water consumption. An irrigation event was scheduled based on Eq. (2) and stopped whenever a soil tension of −30 kPa (wet threshold) was detected. 2.4.4. Canopy temperature signal and the TTT method (TTT) The TTT algorithm described in Evett et al. (1996) and examined in DeJonge et al. (2015) was the basis for the computer algorithm evaluated here. To determine the temperature threshold (Ttemp, °C), leaf samples were collected and sent in sealed refrigerated envelop to a lab in Lubbock, TX, where enzyme assays performed. The value of time threshold (Ttime, min) was obtained from canopy temperature and meteorological measurements collected over well-irrigated apple trees in 2007 in the same orchard. The accumulated time (t24) during 24 h was calculated as the following: (5) where Tm is the canopy temperature (°C) in minute m, and Ttemp is the temperature threshold. If t24 > Ttime then an irrigation signal was generated. The values of t24 was reset to 0 every day at midnight. The net irrigation depth (I) was calculated as twice the average crop evapotranspiration (I = 2 × ETc) in June and July (twice the peak crop water use), enough to wet the root zone at the highest ET rate in the region while avoiding deep percolation (O’Shaughnessy and Evett, 2010). 2.4.5. Canopy temperature signal with the crop water stress index (CWSI) The CWSI algorithm relied on a theoretical CWSI and a dynamic threshold. The theoretical lower and upper boundaries of the CWSI were calculated using biophysical models thoroughly detailed by Osroosh et al. (2015b). The net irrigation depth (I) was calculated as three times the average crop evapotranspiration (I = 3 × ETc) in June and July. This computer algorithm (called CWSI-DT) and its field evaluation results are also described in Osroosh et al. (2015b). Here, the results from the original experiment were compared with the rest of the approaches. 2.4.6. Scientific-based method of measuring soil moisture using neutron probe (NP) The NP treatment was assumed to represent the best irrigation scheduling practice by an advanced farmer. In this approach, soil water content was measured with a field-calibrated neutron probe on a weekly basis. Using the soil moisture readings, soil water deficit (SWD) to field capacity was calculated and irrigation was scheduled. The soil water depletion under the NP treatment was never allowed to exceed a maximum allowed depletion (MAD of 50%) recommended for apple trees (Allen et al., 1998). The net irrigation depth was calculated as I = d × [θFC − θS], where d is the rooting depth (d = 0.6 m), and θs is the average volumetric soil water content for d. Manual neutron probe readings (raw values) were entered into the GUI right after field measurements every Wednesday. Irrigation was automatically schdeuled based on the entered reading for following day. 2.4.7. Conventional irrigation scheduling in the region (CNTRL) In addition to the precision algorithms described, water delivery to a number of zones was managed using the conventional irrigation scheduling method of apple trees in the region. The CNTRL algorithm (Fig. 3) was designed to mimic the growers’ approach of using the calendar (irrigation events on specific days of week) and weather conditions (low, high air temperature thresholds). In the CNTRL algorithm, any air temperature between the maximum (TMax) and minimum (Tmin) thresholds would have resulted in applying Ib = 63 mm of water. If air temperature exceeded the maximum threshold (TMax = 32 °C) the amount of irrigation water would be doubled (I = 2 × Ib). If air temperature was below the minimum threshold (Tmin = 21 °C), the trees would receive half the usual amount of water (I = 0.5 × Ib).

I is the amount of irrigation water applied, and Ib is the base amount of water which was doubled or halved depending on minimum (Tmin) and maximum (TMax) air temperature thresholds. 2.5. Graphical user interface A Windows-based GUI was developed in Microsoft VB.Net (V.2010, Microsoft Inc., Redmond, WA) to manage and control the irrigation system and wireless nodes. Embedded routines in CoraScript (V.1.1.9.8, Campbell Scientific, Logan, UT) were used to send command signals to the six slave nodes/dataloggers. LoggerNet (V.3.5, Campbell Scientific, Logan, UT) automatically downloaded data from the nodes every 15 min and populated a database on the laptop. The recorded data was then managed by the GUI. Fig. 4 shows a task flowchart of systems’ software and firmware components and their relationship. Instead of wireless communication between the field and office computers, Teamviewer (V.8, TeamViewer Pty Ltd, Adelaide, Australia) was used to remotely access the GUI in the field.

Flowchart displaying the routines performed by the software (LN and GUI) and firmware (Node) components of the control and monitoring system. The node firmware was responsible for scanning the sensors and sending the collected data to the base. LoggerNet (LN) regularly retrieved data from the nodes and recorded them in a file. The GUI used this data to run the irrigation algorithms, and make irrigation control decision. The GUI has a tabular design and comprises several tabs including: (1) a “Blocks” tab for displaying raw real-time data from the in-field sensors and valves on/off status, (2) a tab for showing real-time weather data (“Roza”), and (3) a tab for monitoring the commands sent out and program codes in action (“Console”). Fig. 5 shows a screenshot of the “Blocks” tab. The rest of the tabs were dedicated to system settings, crop and soil properties, sensor calibration parameters, and entering manual field measurements into the GUI. The GUI was capable of running in three main functioning modes: simulation, automatic irrigation and manual irrigation. The simulation and manual modes were used for the purpose of testing the system’s hardware and software. The simulation mode was added mainly to test the internal functions without having to operate the hardware. The manual mode, on the other hand, allowed for testing and tuning the hardware more easily. Download : Download high-res image (429KB) Download : Download full-size image Fig. 5. Screenshot of the “Blocks” tab of the graphical user interface. In this tab, sensor readings taken by the in-field sensors and remaining irrigation time are displayed in real-time. The values were updated every 15 min. The GUI collected data from the sensor nodes, downloaded weather data from the nearby weather station, and provided a real-time display of the measurements in individual zones regardless of the node collecting them. The remaining irrigation time corresponding to each sensor/plot was displayed next to the sensor’s name. The GUI ran the irrigation scheduling algorithms (WB, SOIL, SL + WB, TTT, CWSI, NP and CTNRL) every day at midnight, and automatically made decisions for scheduling irrigation events for twenty-one individual zones within the orchard. It sent control signals to the individual data-loggers which opened or closed latching solenoid valves to turn the water on and off to each block of trees. The software also allowed for manual control of individual zones. The data recorded in the database by LoggerNet were automatically pulled by the GUI and used to execute the algorithms in parallel everyday at midnight. This led to generating irrigation schedules for 10:30 AM of following day. The exceptions were the CNTRL and NP algorithms which were, respectively, run only on Mondays and Wednesdays as depicted in the flowchart in Fig. 4. The decision support process for the SOIL and SL + WB algorithms was slightly different as a continuous monitoring of feedback from the in-field Watermark™ sensors (every 15 min) was required to determine the end of irrigation event. LoggerNet was responsible for handling wireless communication errors and retries. The GUI monitored dataloggers battery voltage levels, handled coding errors and sent alert and digestion emails to the user. The system routinely logged irrigation events and reported the start/stop time of irrigations via email to the user. Due to possible exposure of in-field sensors to malfunction and disturbances, sensor-specific routines automatically analyzed the data for any signs of failure or anomalies such as abnormally high or low values beyond the expected range for a variable and negative/erroneous sensor readings. Noise or temporary abnormal changes in values were handled by the software and those of serious nature were reported back to the user via email. Besides the software error handling, the status of the wireless network was checked by the user regularly. 2.6. Experimental design and statistical analysis The seven irrigation treatments were evaluated in a randomized complete block design with three replications/blocks, each plot consisting of three rows of 6 trees (21 management zones). The trees at the center of the plots were used for measurement purpose. The plots were also observed for tree health and difference in the size and quality of apple fruits. The statistical analysis methods included the standard error of the mean (SE of Mean), and analysis of variance (ANOVA) using SigmaPlot (V.11.0, Systat Software Inc., San Jose, CA) to test for difference among the treatments in terms of applied irrigation water (mm season−1). To conduct multiple comparisons of the means, the Bonferroni t-test was employed (at p = 0.05). 3. Results and discussion During the 2007 growing season when the time threshold for TTT was determined, maximum daily evapotranspiration (ETMax), total applied irrigation water (It), total rainfall (May–September), and total irrigation days (dt) were calculated to be 9.7 mm d−1, 1077  , 32 mm and 110 d, respectively. The theoretical temperature threshold returned by the lab was 10 °C and the corresponding time threshold to this value was 1035 min. Considering the low value determined by the lab, a range of time threshold (Ttime) and temperature threshold (Ttemp) values were plotted against each other. The temperature threshold was then chosen to be 22.2 °C, and an irrigation event ( ) was scheduled following a day when canopy temperature exceeded Ttemp = 22.2 °C for more than 225 min. The rainfall totaled 91 mm from May through September of 2013 most of which (77 mm) occurred in May and July. The 2013 growing season was relatively warmer compared to the 2007 growing period with greater daily mean temperatures, ETr values (Table 1) and ETMax of 14.0 . Considerable amount of rainfall received during May and June, a number of manual irrigation events, and presence of a perched water table in the study site led to the availability of enough moisture in the root zone until June (θs > θMAD = soil moisture at MAD). As a result, the automatic irrigation system did not become operational until the soil water profile reached a defined irrigation trigger point. The wireless control system was configured and tested during March, April and May, and automatically managed the water delivery to the plots during the rest of the season. The number of automatic irrigation days was less than 100 d for most of the treatments. Table 1. Climatic conditions for the 2007 and 2013 growing seasons.

Applied irrigation water The ANOVA test revealed that the difference in the mean values among the seven irrigation treatments was significant (p < 0.001). A comparison of the treatments in terms of total irrigation water applied can be found in Table 2. The applied water for CNTRL was significantly higher than all other treatments with a value of 1359 mm. This was over three times (340%) the amount of water applied by NP (401 mm). On the other hand, SOIL resulted in the lowest mean applied water (214 mm) which was 53% of the amount delivered by NP. WB, CWSI and TTT applied 469, 408 and 436 mm of water, respectively (no significant difference: p = 1), which accounted for slightly more than 100% of water applied by NP and resulted in about 70% water saving over the irrigation period. The WB algorithm applied significantly greater amount of water than SOIL (p < 0.001) and SL + WB (p = 0.004; 273 mm). There was no significant difference between CWSI and SL + WB (p = 0.072). SOIL applied significantly less amount of water than the rest of the treatments, while there was no significant difference between NP and SL + WB (p = 0.1). Table 2.

The Watermark™ sensor readings showed no sign of water stress in the plots of SOIL and SL + WB as the soil water potential fluctuations were within the range of 0 to −80 kPa (Fig. 6a). However, field inspections disclosed that the trees under the SL + WB algorithm may have been severely water-stressed as leaf drop and loss of turgidity, trees reduced overall growth, and abnormally small fruits in these plots were evident. Having under-irrigated the trees, SOIL and SL + WB exhibited an insufficient response to water stress. The under-irrigation of the plots under SOIL can be explained by the fact that the soil sensors monitored only a limited volume of the soil profile and might have not been at a location where the root system was active (Cohen et al., 2005). The Watermark™ sensors were not calibrated and single predefined wet and dry thresholds were applied to all of them. In addition, it was difficult to make a representative tension measurement due to the heterogeneity of soil water distribution under the drip irrigation system.

Graphical display of in-field Watermark™ sensors data collected using the wireless sensor network: mean of three plots under the SL + WB (a), and SOIL (b) treatments. The dotted lines show the standard error of the mean. The dashed lines show the wet (Wet Thresh) and dry (Dry Thresh) thresholds. Using a feed-forward ET-based scheduling method in combination with a soil feedback (SL + WB) did not improve irrigation scheduling as signals to stop irrigation were perhaps issued too soon. The general algorithm of Casadesús et al. (2012) suggests that the use of the water balance model allows for a quick response to weather changes by predicting its effects, while at the same time the feedback mechanism can adapt the amount of water to the requirements of individual orchards by compensating for prediction errors. However, the accuracy of feedback is very important. Currently, available soil water content sensors including Watermark™ sensors cannot provide the required precision as achievable with the neutron probe. The soil water content of the plots under the CWSI and TTT treatments was measured weekly as for the NP plots. As depicted in Fig. 7a, mean soil water deficit (SWD) in the treatment plots of CWSI, TTT and NP in the top 0.6 m was within the well-watered range (<MAD of 50%). Mean SWD in the TTT plots was significantly lower than NP (p < 0.001) which was in agreement with applying slightly more irrigation water under TTT (not significant). Seasonal courses of midday ψstem for the trees under CWSI and TTT are depicted in Fig. 7b. It can be seen that the trees under TTT maintained a relatively similar values of Ψstem to the trees under CWSI over the period. The measured values of Ψstem agreed well with non-stressed values reported for woody plants including apple trees (De Swaef et al., 2009, Naor and Cohen, 2003). As discussed in Osroosh et al. (2015b), the CWSI algorithm demonstrated a good response to the water status of the apple trees. The results here support the use of the TTT thermal-based approach to maintain well-watered apple trees under drip irrigation system in the semi-arid climate of central Washington.

The straight dashed line specifies a MAD of 50% (equivalent to 56 mm for the measured depth). Seasonal courses of midday ψstem in the CWSI and TTT treatments (b). The error bars show the standard error of the mean. The cumulative applied water for individual plots under TTT, WB and CWSI is illustrated in Fig. 8a and b for the growing period of 2013. Plots within the TTT and WB treatments had similar amounts of irrigation water delivered to them during the season, whereas the plots under CWSI showed some degree of variability. WB did not receive any feedback from the trees, thus microclimatic variability within the orchard was the only source of discrepancy among the plots and consequently the irrigation depths. The WB algorithm can lead to over- or under-irrigation if the estimates of crop water use are incorrect, the soil water content at the beginning of the season is unknown, or the application efficiency of irrigation system is lower than expected (Fereres et al., 2012). Apple trees have shown to close their stomata in response to a reduction in fruit loads (Palmer et al., 1997, Lakso, 2003, Girona et al., 2011). This reduction in evapotranspiration can challenge the WB approach as a lack of plant feedback may lead to significant errors in the estimations of water needs. The CWSI algorithm required meteorological data in addition to canopy temperature as input meaning it had to respond to atmospheric demand and signs of plant stress. This is while TTT only responded to increased canopy temperature which could be a result of increased air relative humidity not stomatal closure driven by water stress (Wanjura and Upchurch, 1997, Jones, 2004). This is reflected in TTT having a wetter soil profile as depicted in Fig. 7a. The CWSI algorithm, on the other hand, had a mechanism for withholding irrigation on humid days. It is known that CWSI values measured on cool and humid days are not reliable generating false stress signals and consequently resulting in over irrigation (Osroosh et al., 2015b). The CWSI algorithm interprets CWSI value in relation to the air relative humidity level and no irrigation decision is made on a humid day.

Trees growth and fruit yield Due to the fact that the trees were in an alternate bearing year, no quantitative information on the fruit yield was collected. However, our observations revealed that apple size in the SOIL and SL + WB treatments was noticeably smaller than CNTRL and never ripened (same number of fruits on trees). Larger shoot growth in the CNTRL treatment was observed compared with a much lower shoot and foliage growth in the SOIL and SL + WB treatments leading to shorter trees. The distance between rows in the CNTRL was covered with grass or algae and was always wet. This was not the case in other treatments. 3.3. Labor requirement and cost In the discussed control and monitoring system, the algorithms were executed using commercially available hardware and off-the shelf components. The major hardware cost included Campbell Scientific dataloggers and IRT sensors. We used an old model notebook as the central processing hardware which was worth roughly $100 (U.S. dollars). The base cost of a sensing and actuating unit with the current hardware (datalogger, radio, battery, solar panel, actuator, 4 latching solenoids) is approximately $2500 in 2016. Considering the available commercial options, an IRT sensor adds an additional amount of $450–655 per measurement point. A soil/air temperature probe (without the shield) and a Watermark™ sensor can be purchased for $100 and $35–120, respectively. In the calculation of the cost, we replaced the CR10(X) with the CR1000 (Campbell Scientific, Logan, UT), and the RF401 with the RF401A (Campbell Scientific, Logan, UT) as they are no longer manufactured by the company. We obtained real-time meteorological data from a nearby weather station which was part of the WSU AgWeatherNet. The cost of such a station in case a farmer decides to invest in one is $9500 (sensors, hardware, installation, first year maintenance) (AgWeatherNet, 2013). Major costs for the control and monitoring system and alternative options for some components are summarized in Table 3 for comparison. A summary of the irrigation scheduling algorithms evaluated in the present study including the in-field sensor requirements, total upfront cost, advantages and shortcomings of the system are also summarized in Table 4.

Although the GUI was designed to manage a specific orchard, it has the potential to be retrofitted to other irrigation systems or fields. Especially for research purposes, the laptop/PC and dataloggers can be replaced with Linux-based single-board computers such as the BeagleBone Black (BeagleBoard.org Foundation, Oakland Twp, MI), and the spread-spectrum radio with the XBee RF module (Digi International, Minnetonka, MN) to significantly reduce the cost. A network of inexpensive air temperature sensors can provide enough microclimatic data for estimation of ET. The WB algorithm requires only an air temperature sensor with no need for calibration which keeps the labor and capital investments very low. CWSI needs a network of infrared thermometers and meteorological sensors with no need for site-specific calibration. From both research and practice perspectives, the upfront cost and labor requirements of both CWSI and TTT are relatively low; however, regular maintenance (mainly cleaning) of IRTs is necessary to keep the network up and running. Despite the low sensor cost and ease of implementation, SOIL and SL + WB did not show to be reliable in terms of delivering enough water to stressed trees or detecting stress on-time. To achieve higher accuracies, using a larger number of Watermark™ sensors to account for sources of variability, site-specific calibration of individual sensors, or a combined use of soil water potential and soil water content sensors appears to be necessary. The maintenance was a major issue with the soil sensors wiring. There were several cases of wire damage accidents due to animal rodent activity in the field. Wireless IRTs (O’Shaughnessy et al., 2013) and less commonly wireless soil sensors are alternatives to wired sensors which will also lead to reduced installation and maintenance cost. These results support the suitability of simple irrigation scheduling techniques like WB for the automatic irrigation of apple orchard. Approaches like CWSI, TTT and WB are slightly more expensive, however they provide a higher degree of reliability compared to SOIL or SL + WB strategies. 4. Conclusions In this study, we developed and initially evaluated seven irrigation scheduling algorithms including two well-known plant/thermal-based strategies of the Time and Temperature Threshold (TTT) and Crop Water Stress Index (CWSI). Irrigation water delivery was automatically scheduled to twenty-one management zones in an apple orchard using a wireless control and monitoring system. Precision irrigation algorithms were compared with the scientific-based method of irrigation scheduling using neutron probe and the conventional approach in the region in terms of ability to improve the current practice and simplicity of implementation from grower’s perspective. Our preliminary results supported the use of weather- and plant-based algorithms, decision support and monitoring software, and wireless sensor network for automatic irrigation management of drip-irrigated apple trees. The weather- and plant-based algorithms evaluated here were able to deliver enough irrigation water to the apple trees and avoid water stress. The soil-based approaches, on the other hand, failed to deliver enough water to the trees which resulted in severe water stress and impaired growth. The weather- and plant-based methods exhibited a promising performance at the level of the scientific irrigation scheduling method in terms of applying precise amount of water when needed and had the great advantage of being fully automatic. While the weather-based control algorithm showed a similar performance to the plant-based methods under the conditions of the experimental site, we believe a control algorithm with plant feedback is a superior choice when it comes to site- and crop-specific precision. However, the weather-based approach is a better choice when lower cost and complexity are more important to growers. This was an initial step towards implementing automatic irrigation on drip-irrigated apple trees. The presented irrigation scheduling approaches have the potential to improve water use efficiency, increased production, reduced production costs, reduced pumping energy requirements, and improved quality. Here, we mainly examined the various hardware and software aspects of a SCADA system and the suitability of the irrigation scheduling algorithms for maintaining well-watered trees. Future studies will reveal more on their benefits for decreasing losses of water and nutrients to deep percolation and their effect on yield and fruit quality.

The objectives of this study were to: (1) quantify the yield response of corn to deficit irrigation, and (2) determine which of several seasonal water variables correlated best to corn yield in a semiarid climate. Eight (T1–T8) and nine (T1–T9) deficit-irrigated treatments (including dryland), were compared in 2003 and 2004 in North Platte, Nebraska. The actual seasonal crop evapotranspiration (ETd) (calculated with procedures in FAO-56) for the different treatments was 37–79% in 2003 and 63–91% in 2004 compared with the seasonal crop evapotranspiration when water is not limited (ETw). Quantitative relationships between grain yield and several seasonal water variables were developed. Water variables included, irrigation (I), total water (Wall), rain + irrigation (WR+I), evaporation (E), crop evapotranspiration (ETd), crop transpiration (Td), and the ratios of ETd and Td to evapotranspiration and transpiration when water is not limited (ETw and Tw). Both years, yield increased linearly with seasonal irrigation, but the relationship varied from year to year. Combining data from both years, ETd had the best correlation to grain yield (yield = 0.028ETd–5.04, R2 = 0.95), and the water variables could be ranked from higher to lower R2 when related to grain yield as: . Crop water productivity (CWP) (yield per unit ETd) linearly increased with ETd/ETw (R2 = 0.75), which suggests that trying to increase CWP by deficit-irrigating corn is not a good strategy under the conditions of this study.

Introduction Irrigation water supplies are decreasing in many areas of the Great Plains of the USA. Some of the reasons for this decrease include extended drought periods, decline in groundwater levels (McGuire, 2004, McGuire and Fischer, 1999), litigation among states related to surface water allocations, and diversion of water from irrigation to environmental uses (Lingle and Franti, 1998). This situation is forcing farmers to consider the options of deficit-irrigating crops like corn or growing alternative crops like winter wheat that require less irrigation water, but that are generally less profitable. Knowing the quantitative response of crops to limited water supplies under specific environments is critical to be able to perform economic comparisons among local cropping options. In the US Great Plains, developing local and current information on water–yield relationships is particularly important for corn (Zea mays L.), since this crop covers more irrigated area than any other crop in the region (Norwood, 2000). Deficit irrigation creates water stress that can affect the growth and development of corn plants. The response of corn plants to water stress has been shown to change with hybrid (Lorens et al., 1987) and can be affected by improving technological level (Dale and Daniels, 1995). Effects of water stress on corn include the visible symptoms of reduced growth, delayed maturity, and reduced crop yield. For instance, water stress has been shown to reduce corn canopy height (Denmead and Shaw, 1960, Gavloski et al., 1992, Traore et al., 2000), leaf area index (NeSmith and Ritchie, 1992, Traore et al., 2000), and root growth (Gavloski et al., 1992, Jama and Ottman, 1993). Jama and Ottman (1993) found that stressing corn during the vegetative stage in an arid environment hindered root development, which restricted deep water uptake. However, in a wetter environment in eastern Nebraska, Newell and Wilhelm (1987) found that although a fully irrigated corn treatment had greater total profile (0–1.5 m) and surface (0–0.15 m) root length at the reproductive stage, dryland and a deficit-irrigated treatments had relatively greater root length proliferation deep in the soil profile. The effect of water stress on reducing corn grain and biomass yields has also been studied (Denmead and Shaw, 1960, Traore et al., 2000). Grain yield can be reduced by decreasing yield components like ear size, number of kernel per ear, or the kernel weight. Claassen and Shaw (1970) observed that stress before or during silking and pollination resulted in reduced kernel number, while stress during or after silking reduced kernel weight. NeSmith and Ritchie (1992) attributed yield loss from water stress during pre-anthesis to a reduction in the number of well-developed kernels. Bryant et al. (1992) indicated that water stress reduces yield by reducing accumulated biomass and the harvest index (ratio of grain yield to aboveground plant dry weight). Traore et al. (2000), however, found that the harvest index was affected by water deficit only when stress was imposed during anthesis. Many researchers have evaluated the effect of stress timing on corn yield (Robins and Domingo, 1953, Denmead and Shaw, 1960, Barnes and Woolley, 1969, Downey, 1971, Claassen and Shaw, 1970, Jurgens et al., 1978, NeSmith and Ritchie, 1992, Bryant et al., 1992, Jama and Ottman, 1993). Others have developed models to quantify the effect of stress timing on yield (Jensen, 1968, Nairizi and Rydzewski, 1977, Doorenbos et al., 1979, Doorenbos and Kassam, 1979, Meyer et al., 1993a, Meyer et al., 1993b). For instance, Doorenbos et al. (1979) proposed that the effect of water stress on yield could be quantified by a linear function where the slope of the line (ky) was an empirical yield response factor that varied depending on the growth stage when water stress occurred. For corn, they reported ky values of 0.4, 1.5, 0.5, and 0.2 for the vegetative, flowering, yield formation, and ripening stages, indicating that yield was more affected by water stress during the flowering stage than at any other stage. This model suggests that if water is limited, the irrigator should time irrigation to coincide with the most sensitive stage. Despite the body of evidence indicating that stress timing has an effect on corn yield, there is also indication that corn yield is just a linear function of seasonal evapotranspiration (ET) or transpiration (T), with no regard for stress timing. For instance, good linear relationship between corn yield and seasonal ET have been reported by Robins and Domingo (1953), Hanks (1974), Hanks et al. (1976), Gilley et al. (1980), Schneekloth et al. (1991), Barrett and Skogerboe (1978), Stone (2003), and Klocke et al. (2004). The data reported by Benoit et al. (1965) also follow a linear yield-ET function with R2 ≥ 0.79. Barrett and Skogerboe (1978) pointed out that the scatter in the published crop yield versus water use data largely resulted from the time of occurrence of water deficits in relation to the stage of growth. However, they also stated that if these yields are plotted versus seasonal ET rather than the quantity of water applied, the data would likely fall on a straight line. The objectives of this study were to: (1) quantify the grain yield response of corn to deficit irrigation and (2) determine which of several seasonal water variables correlated best to corn grain yield under deficit irrigation conditions in the semiarid climate of West-Central Nebraska. 2. Materials and methods 2.1. Site description Field data for this study were collected in 2003 and 2004 at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln West Central Research and Extension Center, North Platte, Nebraska (41.1°N, 100.8°W, 861 m above sea level). The soil at North Platte is a Cozad silt loam (Fluventic Haplustolls) with field capacity of 0.29 m3 m−3 and permanent wilting point of 0.11 m3 m−3 (Klocke et al., 1999). The corn hybrid DeKalb C57-40 RR was planted at 0.76-m row spacing in 2003 and Renze 9363 Bt RR was planted in 2004. These hybrids had comparative relative maturities that are commonly planted in the area and were chosen for being the top yielding hybrids in local variety trials during the previous year. In 2003 corn was planted on May 13, and harvested on October 13. In 2004, corn was planted on May 10 and harvested on November 15. The experimental plots were located within a relatively large irrigated area. Plots were irrigated using a solid-set sprinkler system, which was arranged in a grid with a sprinkler head installed on a 3.35-m riser at each corner of each plot. Each experimental plot was 12.2 m × 12.2 m (148.8 m2) in size, which accommodated 16 corn rows. The center four rows of each plot were harvested using a plot combine. Experimental plots were separated from each other by 12.2-m wide border strips that were also planted to corn. Water for the system was pumped from the Ogallala aquifer, using an electric turbine pump with a capacity of 600 GPM at 483 kPa of pressure. The mainline at the pumping station was instrumented with two pressure gauges, two flow meters, a pressure relief valve, a chemigation check valve, and “high” and “low” pressure switches. The flow meters measured both the instantaneous flow rate and the cumulative volume of water pumped. The irrigation system had an automatic control panel hard-wired to electric valves installed at each plot. Each electric valve controlled the four sprinklers of each plot. The control panel was also connected to a manual relay panel, which allowed both manual and automatic operation of the irrigation system. This design allowed irrigating each individual plot independently, and changing the randomizing of the plots from year to year to accommodate different experimental designs. The average weather conditions at North Platte during the study are shown in Table 1. In general, weather conditions were cooler and wetter during the 2004 growing season than in 2003. Although the average air temperature during June–October was only 0.6 °C cooler in 2004, it was approximately 2.2 °C cooler during the months of June, July, and August. These cooler weather conditions during 2004 delayed crop maturity and harvest about a month compared with 2003. Warmer conditions, however, prevailed in 2004 compared with 2003 during the months of May and September. Although weather conditions were cooler in 2004, the average of the daily grass-reference evapotranspiration (ETo) values for the entire May–October period was only 0.02 mm d−1 lower during 2004 (Table 1). In 2004, the average daily ETo values were lower than 2003 during the months of July, August, and October, and higher during May, June, and September. Average daily ETo values in 2004 were particularly lower than 2003 during the months of July and August, which are usually the months with the peak ETo values for the North Platte area. Table 1.

A total of 22 rainfall events occurred during the 2003 growing season, which totaled 138 mm of water. In 2003, the total in-season rainfall was only enough to supply approximately 19.4% of seasonal crop water requirements (ETw). In 2004, however, there were 39 rainfall events, almost twice as many as in 2003. Rainfall in 2004 totaled 414 mm, which supplied more than half (54.5%) of the seasonal crop water requirements.

Irrigation treatments The experiment was conducted using a randomized complete block design with four replications. Eight irrigation treatments (T1–T8) were applied in 2003 and the number of treatments was increased to nine (T1–T9) in 2004. Each year, treatments included a dryland treatment (treatment T8 in 2003 and T9 in 2004) (Table 2), which received no irrigation. This many treatments were included to obtain enough data points and a wide enough range of water stress levels to be able to develop meaningful quantitative relationships between grain yield and several seasonal water variables, including irrigation, total water, rain + irrigation, evaporation, evapotranspiration, and transpiration, among others.

Irrigation to the different treatments was scheduled trying to create differences in soil water depletions of approximately 10 mm between irrigated treatments, within the range of 150–250 mm. This range of soil water depletion represents between 50 and 85% of total available water in the maximum crop rooting depth. No irrigation was applied during the vegetative growth stage, following a common practice in the area, and to make sure that there would be some seasonal crop stress despite potential rainfall occurring later in the growing season. Depths and timings of irrigation events applied to each irrigation treatment during the 2003 and 2004 growing seasons are shown in Table 2. Due to more in-season rainfall, seasonal irrigation amounts and the number of irrigation events per treatment were significantly less in 2004 than 2003. In 2003, seasonal irrigation depths per treatment ranged from approximately 245 to 395 mm. These seasonal irrigation depths supplied between 34.7 and 55.7% of seasonal crop water requirements (ETw). In 2004, seasonal irrigation depths ranged from 34 to 161 mm, representing between 4.7 and 21.2% of seasonal ETw. In 2003, the first irrigation to some of the irrigated treatments was applied in early July. In 2004, rainfall early in the season allowed delaying the first irrigation to any of the treatments until early August. The last irrigation during both years was applied in early September. Irrigation scheduling at both sites was done using a scheduling spreadsheet that used the calculated daily corn evapotranspiration as input to estimate daily soil water content in the crop root zone. When actual soil water measurements were available, they were used to adjust the spreadsheet estimates. Soil water measurements were made approximately every 2 weeks during the growing season using the neutron scattering method. Soil water readings were taken from 50-mm diameter aluminum access tubes installed at the center of two of the four replications for each treatment. Readings were taken at 0.3-m depth increments to a depth of 1.8 m. Weather data for this study were obtained from an automatic weather station located within 1.5 km from the research site. This weather station was part of the High Plains Regional Climate Center (HPRCC) weather network. Daily weather data were downloaded from the HPRCC web site (http://www.hprcc.unl.edu/home.html), including daily maximum and minimum air temperature, relative humidity, wind speed, rainfall, solar radiation, reference ET, and crop ET for different crops, including corn. 2.3. Data analyses The statistical analyses of yield data, which included analysis of variance (ANOVA) and separation of means by the Duncan's new multiple range test, were conducted using the SAS® System for Windows® statistical software (SAS Institute, Inc., Cary, NC). A computer program was written in Microsoft Visual Basic® to model the daily soil water status. Basic input to the program included daily weather data, rainfall, irrigation, the soil water profile at crop emergence, and crop-specific and site-specific information such as planting date, maturity date, soil parameters, maximum rooting depth, etc. Based on these inputs, the water balance in the crop root zone was calculated on a daily basis. Similar soil water balance models have previously been used by Robinson and Hubbard (1990), Swan et al. (1990), and Bryant et al. (1992) to estimate daily water status and yield for corn. The computer program calculated evapotranspiration using the procedure presented in FAO-56 (Allen et al., 1998). Since this is a lengthy procedure, readers are referred to the original source for details. According to this procedure, crop evapotranspiration can be obtained as the product of the evapotranspiration of a reference crop (ETo) and a crop coefficient (Kc). ETo is calculated using the daily weather data as input to the Penman–Monteith equation, and the Kc is used to adjust the estimated ETo for the reference crop to that of other crops at different growth stages and growing environments. ETo is the evapotranspiration of a hypothetical reference crop with an assumed crop height of 0.12 m, a fixed surface resistance of 70 s m−1 and an albedo of 0.23. The reference surface closely resembles an extensive surface of green grass of uniform height, actively growing, completely shading the ground and with adequate water (Allen et al., 1998). The dual crop coefficient approach was used to separate the two components of evapotranspiration, namely evapotation (E) and transpiration (T) (Wright, 1982). For corn, this procedure linearly reduced crop evapotranspiration when the root zone depletion exceeded 55% (taken from Table 22 in FAO-56) of total available water, which was used to quantify the effect of water stress on corn water use. The dual crop coefficient procedure also accounts for the sharp increases in evaporation due to a wet soil surface following rain or irrigation. This procedure permitted calculation of the crop evapotranspiration and transpiration when soil water is not limiting (ETw and Tw), and the actual crop evapotranspiration, transpiration, and evaporation (ETd, Td, and E). From the seasonal values, the seasonal ETd/ETw and Td/Tw ratios were calculated for each treatment. It was expected that the seasonal ETd/ETw and Td/Tw ratios would relate to crop yield. Additionally, in FAO-56, an equation was presented to estimate the fraction of total available soil water in the root zone (p) that can be depleted from the root zone before moisture stress (reduction in ETd) occurs. This equation estimates a variable p (pcalc) as a function of daily ETw as: (7) where, ptable is the p value taken from Table 22 in FAO-56, and ETw is in mm day−1 and 0.1 ≤ pcalc ≤ 0.8. This equation suggests that as ETw for a given day decreases, it is easier for the crop to sustain ETw rates, and therefore, higher soil water depletion levels could be allowed without yield loss, as previously proposed by Doorenbos et al. (1979). This way of calculating a variable p value differs from the common procedure of using a fixed p value for a given crop for the entire growing season. In this study, the daily pcalc values were calculated, which were taken as the theoretical optimum depletion value for a given day. Also, a daily actual p (pactual) was calculated as: (8) (9) where D is the soil water depletion in the crop root zone (mm), ⊖FC the soil water content at field capacity (m3 m−3), ⊖PWP the soil water content at permanent wilting point (m3 m−3), Zr the crop rooting depth (m), and TAW is the total available soil water in the crop root zone (mm). A maximum rooting depth of 1.7 m was assumed for corn (taken from Table 22 in FAO-56). In this study, it was expected that pdiff = (pactual − pcalc) accumulated for the entire season only for days when pdiff > 0 (seasonal pdiff) would be a good indicator of the level of crop stress and would, therefore, relate to crop yield. The greater the seasonal pdiff for a given treatment the greater the level of water stress. Seasonal pdiff was therefore calculated for each treatment. The effect of irrigation treatments on crop yield was also evaluated by calculating the crop water productivity (CWP) (Zwart and Bastiaanssen, 2004) as: (10) where Ya is the crop yield (kg ha−1), seasonal ETd the seasonal actual crop evapotranspiration (mm), and CWP is in kg m−3. Since 1 ha-mm = 10 m3, 10 is needed to convert CWP from units of kg ha−1 mm−1 to kg m−3. The CWP is sometimes equivalent to water use efficiency (WUE) as defined by Howell (2000), although sometimes researchers define WUE in terms of seasonal irrigation applied instead of seasonal ETd. This study also evaluated the relationships between several other water variables and corn grain yield. These variables included seasonal ETd, Td, E, irrigation applied (I), rain + irrigation (WR+I), and total water available to crop during the growing season (Wall). Grain yields were also normalized by calculating the % yield potential (%Yp) and the % maximum yield (%Ymax). The maximum yield obtained within each season was taken as a reference to calculate %Ymax. The potential yield for each season was estimated using the Hybrid-Maize simulation model developed by Yang et al. (2004). 3. Results and discussion 3.1. Yield response to water deficit Irrigation treatments resulted in differences in daily soil water depletions in the crop root zone as shown in Fig. 2. To avoid water stress, best management practices commonly recommend maintaining root zone depletion below the readily available water (RAW) line (Fig. 2). Fig. 2, however, shows that in 2003, delaying irrigation until early July resulted in water stress for all treatments occurring after mid June. Limited water inputs after that time also resulted in water stress levels for the different treatments that ranged from mild to severe. In 2004, except for the dryland treatment, stress to most treatments only occurred after mid July. Limited water inputs in 2004 also resulted in some level of stress for all treatments, especially late in the growing season. In 2004, similarly to 2003, the dryland treatment suffered from water stress during most of the growing season, although the level of stress at the end of the growing season for this treatment was more severe in 2003 than 2004.

TAW is the total available water in the crop root zone and RAW is the readily available water (RAW = 0.55TAW). Irrigation treatments also resulted in differences in seasonal values of several water variables as shown in Table 3. Although the 2004 growing season was cooler and wetter than 2003, the seasonal values of ETw were higher in 2004 due to the longer growing season, resulting from delayed crop maturity, and to increased soil evaporation due to more frequent wetting of the soil surface by rainfall. Values of seasonal ETd for the different treatments were also higher in 2004 since there was more water available to the crop compared with 2003. The seasonal values of ETd/ETw per treatment ranged from 0.37 to 0.79 in 2003 and from 0.63 to 0.91 in 2004. The values of the ETd/ETw ratio indicate that all treatments experienced some water stress during the growing season.

In 2004, there was slightly more seasonal evaporation (E) for all treatments compared with 2003. The values for E/ETw in Table 3 show that the seasonal evaporation represented about 1/3 of ETw during both seasons for all treatments. This is a significant amount of water that does not directly contribute to crop yield. In this study, however, most of the evaporation resulted from rainfall instead of irrigation. Most of the E also occurred early in the growing season when there was a partial canopy cover and the soil surface was exposed to direct solar energy. To achieve the objective of producing more crop yield per unit of water there is still potential for reducing the evaporation component of ETw in addition to the application of other water-saving techniques (Kijne et al., 2003). Irrigation treatments also resulted in differences in grain yields as shown in Table 4. Higher yields were obtained in 2004 since there was more water available to the crop in all treatments compared with 2003. The analysis of variance resulted in significant yield differences during both growing seasons. However, during the 2003 season the separation of means analysis resulted in five different groups of treatments, while in 2004 only the dryland treatment (T9) had significantly lower grain yield than the other treatments. Running the Hybrid-maize simulation model of Yang et al. (2004) assuming adequate irrigation, potential yields for corn at North Platte were estimated at 13.3 Mg ha−1 for 2003 and 16.9 Mg ha−1 for 2004. These potential yields were used to calculate the % potential yield (%Yp) shown in Table 4. The maximum yield was 10.1 Mg ha−1 in 2003 and 14.2 Mg ha−1 in 2004. Based on these maximum yields, the % maximum yield (%Ymax) per treatment was also calculated (Table 4). The %Yp for the different irrigation treatments ranged between 17.7 and 75.9% in 2003 and from 47.4 to 83.8% in 2004. During both years, soil water deficit was the main yield-limiting factor.

The Duncan New Multiple Range test was used to separate means when the treatment main effect was significant. For a given year, yields with the same letter are not significantly different. 3.2. Effect of seasonal water variables on grain yield The relationships between yield and several seasonal water variables obtained during 2003 and 2004 are shown in Fig. 3. Results of regression analyses for the different water variables are shown in Table 5, which include the results of the regression analyses for each year and also combining data for both years. Fig. 3 and Table 5 indicate that in 2003 there were very good linear relationships among all the yield and water variables. The poorest relationships were between evaporation and grain yield, which resulted in R2 = 0.58, and between ETd/ETw and CWP, which resulted in R2 = 0.74. All other relationships resulted in R2 > 0.90. Among all variables, the ones relating best to grain yield in 2003 were irrigation, Wall, and rain + irrigation, and ETd, which all resulted in a high R2 value of 0.94.

RMSE is the root mean squared error. a ETd, seasonal actual crop evapotranspiration. For 2004, however, irrigation, rain + irrigation, and evaporation were all poorly related to grain yield. Also, ETd/ETw was poorly related to CWP in 2004, which could be due to the small range of CWP values obtained that year. All other variables were well-correlated to grain yield during 2004, resulting in R2 ≥ 0.84. The poor relationship between irrigation and grain yield during 2004 could be due to several factors. First, the small seasonal irrigation amounts applied during 2004 did not provide a large enough range of irrigation among treatments to be able to observe significant yield differences, with the only exception of the dryland treatment. Second, some of the irrigation water may have been applied too late in the season to some of the treatments to be able to make an impact on crop yield. For instance, no grain yield increase resulted from applying an additional 48 mm of irrigation to treatment T1 late in the growing season (on September 8, 2004) compared to treatment T5, which received the last irrigation on August 25, 2004 (Table 2). Both of these treatments produced the same yield, although T1 received 161 mm of irrigation, while T5 only received approximately 62 mm. The difference was that there was a higher amount of soil water left in the T1 treatment at the end of the season compared to T5 (Fig. 2). Fig. 2 shows that at the end of the growing season, there was still some water available in the soil profile that the crop did not have time to use because it resulted from rainfall or rain that occurred too late in the growing season to have an impact on crop yield. Norwood (2000) in a 4-year study with corn in Kansas found that considerable water remained in the soil profile after harvest. These results point out the importance of applying all irrigations early enough in the growing season so that the crop has time to use the water and convert it into grain. Fig. 3 reflects the considerable variations in the relationship between grain yield and irrigation that can occur from one season to the next, as previously reported by Norwood (2000). These variations depend on how much water is stored in the soil profile at crop emergence, and the amount and distribution of in-season rainfall. These results also point out the importance of calculating variables that relate crop yield to available soil water (i.e., CWP or water use efficiency) in terms of water variables that are more stable than seasonal irrigation. Some of these more stable water variables include seasonal ETd, Td, ETd/ETw, Wall, Td/Tw, or pdiff. When data for 2003 and 2004 were combined, irrigation had the poorest relationship to grain yield (R2 = 0.06) among all variables, followed by rain + irrigation (R2 = 0.65) (Table 5). Even evaporation was better related to grain yield than the two previous variables (R2 = 0.75). Although evaporation itself might not contribute to crop yield directly, it is well-correlated to ETd (R2 = 0.69), which does contribute to yield. All the remaining variables were highly correlated to grain yield. Combining both years, ETd had the best correlation to grain yield, and the water variables could be ranked from higher to lower resulting R2 when related to grain yield as: . The ranking of these variables, however, could change for other locations, when combining data for more than one location, or when considering an individual year or season. For instance, it was previously shown that during the dry 2003 season, irrigation, Wall, and rain + irrigation had the highest correlation to crop yield of all the variables, while irrigation and rain + irrigation had a poor correlation to yield when data for the two seasons were combined. Normalizing grain yield as %Ymax or %Yp did not produce a significant improvement in the relationships between yield and the seasonal water variables compared in this study. Fig. 3 shows that in this study, it took approximately 180 mm of seasonal ETd for the crop to start producing grain yield. This number can be derived from the equation of the line obtained using the 2003 and 2004 data combined in Table 5 (yield = 0.028ETd − 5.04), assuming a grain yield = 0 Mg ha−1 (seasonal ETd = 5.04/0.028 = 180 mm). The slope of the line indicates that grain yield increased with seasonal ETd at a rate of 0.028 Mg ha−1 mm−1. Fig. 4 shows a comparison of the yield-ETd linear relationship obtained in this study and those functions reported by other researchers. This plot seems to suggest that corn response to water could change with environment and time as new crop hybrids are developed and management practices improve. The slope of the line obtained in this study, however, is very similar to those reported by Schneekloth et al. (1991) and Klocke et al. (2004) for the same location. Schneekloth et al. (1991) reported an average yield-ETd slope for two corn crop rotations (continuous corn and wheat–corn–soybean) during a three-year study of 0.030 Mg ha−1 mm−1. Klocke et al. (2004) also reported yield-ETd slope for corn at North Platte of 0.030 Mg ha−1 mm−1, although the intercept of the line (−8.5 Mg ha−1) was smaller than the one obtained in this study (−5.04 Mg ha−1). For the same location, Hergert et al. (1993) also reported an average marginal return for corn from the application of a deficit irrigation treatment of 150 mm of water of 0.027 Mg ha−1 mm−1, which was very similar to the slope of the yield-ETd line obtained in this study. Stone (2003), however, reported a long-term yield-ETd slope for corn in Kansas of 0.033 Mg ha−1 mm−1, which is slightly higher than the slope found in this study. This difference could be due to differences in techniques used to quantify seasonal ETd and yield, differences in climate between locations (especially the amount and distribution of in-season rainfall), differences in crop varieties and cultural practices, irrigation method, differences in irrigation scheduling practices, etc. Download : Download full-size image Fig. 4. Linear relationships between corn grain yield and actual seasonal evapotranspiration (ETd) reported in the literature and that obtained in this study. The CWP increased with ETd/ETw, resulting in a R2 = 0.75 when data for both years were combined (Table 5). These results suggest that trying to increase CWP by using deficit irrigation might not be a beneficial strategy under the conditions of this study as suggested by other researchers. For instance, Zwart and Bastiaanssen (2004) reviewed measured CWP for several crops around the world, including corn, and concluded that the CWP could be significantly increased if irrigation was reduced and crop water deficit was intentionally induced. Deficit irrigation would probably increase CWP only in situations where crops are being over-irrigated. The results of this study suggest that if the crop is already deficit-irrigated, lowering irrigation inputs would only contribute to further reduce yields, lowering CWP. Howell (2000) showed that WUE (calculated the same as CWP in this study) for corn increased as yield increased. It is important, however, to point out that the objective of most farmers is not to maximize CWP, but to maximize profits. Therefore, there could be very good reasons for applying deficit irrigation other than trying to maximize CWP. For example, Norwood (2000) concluded that for corn, deficit-irrigation combined with proper fertility and plant population was a viable alternative to dryland in Kansas where groundwater resources are declining. Some economic justifications for deficit irrigation strategies for corn in Nebraska have been reported by Klocke et al. (2004) and Schneekloth et al. (1995). 4. Conclusions Quantitative relationships between grain yield and several seasonal water variables were developed. Seasonal water variables included, irrigation (I), total water (Wall), rain + irrigation (WR+I), evaporation (E), actual crop evapotranspiration (ETd), actual crop transpiration (Td), ETd/ETw, Td/Tw, and pdiff. Several of the water variables were also related to grain yield normalized as % maximum yield and % potential yield. A relationship between crop water productivity (CWP) and ETd/ETw was developed. Results indicated that E accounted for about 1/3 of seasonal ETw, which indicates that technologies to minimize E should be developed and implemented. The linear relationship between grain yield and some of the water variables changed significantly from year to year, while others were very consistent. Combining data from both years, ETd had the best correlation to corn grain yield (yield = 0.028ETd − 5.04, R2 = 0.95). The water variables could be ranked from higher to lower R2 when related to grain yield as: . The CWP linearly increased with ETd/ETw (R2 = 0.75). These results indicate that trying to increase CWP by imposing deficit irrigation for corn might not be a beneficial strategy under the conditions of this study. However, it is recognized that there could be other good justifications for deficit irrigating corn in this environment, other than increasing CWP.

Abstract: The global economy is now under threat due to the ongoing domestic and international
lockdown for COVID-19. Many have already lost their jobs, and businesses have been unstable in the
Corona era. Apart from educational institutions, banks, privately owned institutions, and agriculture,
there are signs of economic recession in almost all sectors. The roles of modern technology, the
Internet of things, and artiﬁcial intelligence are undeniable in helping the world achieve economic
prosperity in the post-COVID-19 economic downturn. Food production must increase by 60% by
2050 to meet global food security demands in the face of uncertainty such as the COVID-19 pandemic
and a growing population. Given COVID 19’s intensity and isolation, improving food production
and distribution systems is critical to combating hunger and addressing the double burden of
malnutrition. As the world’s population is growing day by day, according to an estimation world’s
population reaches 9.6 billion by 2050, so there is a growing need to modify the agriculture methods,
technologies so that maximum crops can be attained and human effort can be reduced. The urban
smart vertical farming (USVF) is a solution to secure food production, which can be introduced at
any adaptive reuse, retroﬁt, or new buildings in vertical manners. This paper aims to provide a
comprehensive review of the concept of USVF using various techniques to enhance productivity
as well as its types, topologies, technologies, control systems, social acceptance, and beneﬁts. This
review has focused on numerous issues, challenges, and recommendations in the development of the
system, vertical farming management, and modern technologies approach.

1. Introduction
In the 21st century, urbanization will be faster, and the population will reach 6.3 billion
by 2050. 67.2% or 6.5 billion of these, are expected to live in urban areas [1]. To feed this
growing, increasingly urbanized population, the United Nations estimates food demand
needs to rise by 70% [2,3]. Rapid changes in urban built-up areas and skylines in providing
buildings and infrastructures to cater to the city center’s larger population have altered the
urban climate into unhealthy living conditions. This situation threatens the demand for
the basic needs of urban dwellers for a livable urban living environment. Furthermore, a
larger urban population also demands a fresh and good quality food supply [4]. Urban
smart vertical farming (USVF) is one of the potential solutions to help societies meet this
elevated demand without additional farmland [5–7]. Figure 1 shows the statistical data
about the use of vertical farming (VF) market in the world 2019 and 2025 respectively. In
recent years, the global VF market has been increasing steadily as population sizes grow
and urban living becomes more common in urban cities. The VF industry reached some
$4.4 billion in 2019, but the market size is estimated to rise to $15.7 billion by 2025. The

Agriculture is humanity’s oldest and most important economic activity, providing
us with essential food, ﬁber, feed, and fuel [9,10]. As the world’s population contin-
ues to rise while land resources remain constant, there is an increasing need to improve
agricultural productivity, which can be achieved by a smart agriculture implementation
approach [11–13]. Each crop is unique and has its requirement for growth. The basic
requirements for the crops grown are suitable temperature, humidity and soil moisture con-
tents [14,15]. So it becomes a repetitive process for farmers to provide an ideal environment
for the crop chosen.
Nowadays, automation plays a vital role in every ﬁeld of life. Some examples are
manufacturing, transportation, agriculture, utilities, defense, facility operation [16,17]. The
beneﬁts of automation can be applied in water and wastewater, oil and gas, electric power
and telecommunication systems. Automation is generally used in many ﬁelds because it
reduces human effort, is easy to handle, and is more effective and efﬁcient. By the name of
agriculture, farm automation can automate most of the agriculture ﬁelds’ processes, such
as controlling watering systems or ﬂow control and moisture control [18,19]. Similarly, it
can build a robot/drone for spraying pesticides and plowing [20]. Harvesting machinery
is also used for such purposes: a user-friendly farm automation system, easy user control
for a layman, control water, plant health condition, and crop production [21].
In terms of human health, the World Health Organization estimates that more than
half of the world’s farms still use untreated animal waste as fertilizer, which attracts ﬂies
and may contain weed seeds or diseases that can be transmitted to plants. VF has the ability
to produce crops throughout the year, with greater control over food safety and biosecurity,
while also lowering inputs such as water, pesticides, herbicides, and fertilizers [7]. Food
protection is a major concern of our day, as there have been several incidents of events
around the world resulting in food recalls due to bacterial infectious diseases, resulting
in billion-dollar losses. After the crop has been picked, the washing of ﬁeld-grown items
poses a further risk of infection from various bacteria and pathogens. This stage, on the
other hand, has the potential to contaminate the entire manufacturing process [22]. While
the whole world is badly affected by COVID-19, the terrible clutches of natural disasters
still plague many people worldwide. All scientists’ projections show that the number and
severity of climate-related disasters are increasing due to climate change, which is cutting
off the COVID virus infection and public health response in the wake of the epidemic. The

compound risk arising from the perfect combination of corona and natural disasters has
an unprecedented impact on economics. Multiple reports (e.g., global warming of 1.5 ◦C)
have already indicated that one of the features of the 21st century will be deforestation,
biodiversity loss, climate chaos, and global epidemics; COVID-19 might be the latest
manifestation of this, which has pointed to the horrible meaning of ‘global economy crisis
emergency’. Since COVID-19 will have a long-term impact, now is the time to prepare to
introduce USVF.
USVF should become an opportunity for urban dwellers to producing their food,
despite the limited agricultural land in the city center. Integration of any available potential
spaces inside and outside the building by adaptive reuse and retroﬁt as part of the urban
farming (UF) technology should be taken seriously and fully utilized. The design should
consider less human intervention in operation due to the hectic life of urbanites. An appli-
cation of the Internet of things (IoT) can be incorporated into monitoring and controlling in
the USVF system [23,24]. Thus, the UF technology can have bigger involvement and contri-
bution of urban dwellers. Besides producing their foods, it contributes to the improvement
in a healthy living environment and on urban microclimate. UF offers an once-in-a-lifetime
chance to grow food on already built soil, maximize domestic food production, and reduce
food travel distances.
This study will include an in-depth examination of the philosophy of USVF as a means
of enhancing efﬁciency, including its forms, topologies, technologies, control structures,
social acceptance, and beneﬁts. This review concentrated on a variety of issues, challenges,
and recommendations related to the system’s growth, vertical farming management, and
modern technology approach. The importance of USVF how it plays a vital role in the
economy serve as the starting point for this review. As the world’s population is growing
day by day, there is a need to modify those orthodox agriculture methods to fulﬁll the
increasing demand for food. This modiﬁcation can be done by automating the agriculture
farm. This idea of agriculture farm automation wants to control water consumption, the
moisture level of soil and water ﬂow, topologies, technologies, control systems, social
acceptance and enables an agricultural business to be more productive, efﬁcient and
proﬁtable.
2. Types, General Structure and Materials of Vertical Farming
Vertical farming (VF) is a practical technology through which large quantities of food
crops and medicinal plants can be produced in a very small space only with the help of
advanced technology [25].
2.1. Types of Vertical Farm
VF is practiced in about 13 different ways in the modern world and each way is so
technologically advanced that it is enough to revolutionize agriculture [26]. The following
section represents a few types of VF utilized for smart UF that are rapidly evolving,
diversifying, and improving in the future of agriculture [7].
2.1.1. Hydroponics
Hydroponics is a system that can be called a key part of VF [26,27]. Very slowly,
this system has gained popularity. Hydroponics is an approach to developing vegetation
barring soil. Instead of having their roots supported and nourished by soil, the plant is often
irrigated and supported with the aid of an inert developing medium like cocopeat and is
fed through nutrient-rich water that is indispensable to maintain plant growth. Hydroponic
structures use 60–70% much less water than regular conventional agriculture [28,29]. In
this method, the plant roots are immersed in the mixture of essential nutrients of the plant
instead of the soil, in which case the nutrients have to be mixed in the right proportions.
Figure 2 shows the structure of the hydroponics VF in Sweden [30]. Hydroponic VF
provides many advantages over traditional agriculture, including more productive use
of water and soil, and a substantial reduction in transport costs is carried out in urban

infrastructure in order to become economically sustainable.

Hydroponics has the potential to consume more electricity than most gre

Operating costs can be reduced by using LEDs with increasing performance, se
vices that modulate light to the optimum level needed by the plants, combinin
farms with green energy sources such as solar and geo-thermal, and energy-eff
chitectures [33]. 
2.1.2. Aquaponics 
The technology of aquaponics is very similar to that of hydroponics but con
in which both plants and fish can be grown in the aquatic environment [34]. In 
the aquatic ecosystem gets a different dimension that produces plants without
shallow water. Aquaponics integrates fish production into the hydroponic de
scheme. More precisely, it makes use of fish waste as a nutrient supply for the pl
treatment, running as a closed-loop ecosystem for indoor farming [28]. Figure 3

such as faster growth rate, maturity and yields of crops, improved food security 
sovereignty, decreased growing area, reduced water stress in hot weather, and no
continuous maintenance.

Hydroponics has the potential to consume more electricity than most greenhouse
generation processes. Although hydroponics consume more energy than conventionally
grown vegetables and herbs, they consume fewer scarce resources such as water, nutrients,
arable land, and pesticides. Hydroponics provides an incentive to grow crops in urban
areas, thus creating employment and strengthening the local food supply [31,32]. Operating
costs can be reduced by using LEDs with increasing performance, sensor devices that
modulate light to the optimum level needed by the plants, combining indoor farms with
green energy sources such as solar and geo-thermal, and energy-efﬁcient architectures [33].
2.1.2. Aquaponics
The technology of aquaponics is very similar to that of hydroponics but convenient,
in which both plants and ﬁsh can be grown in the aquatic environment [34]. In this case,
the aquatic ecosystem gets a different dimension that produces plants without soil and
shallow water. Aquaponics integrates ﬁsh production into the hydroponic developing
scheme. More precisely, it makes use of ﬁsh waste as a nutrient supply for the plants after
treatment, running as a closed-loop ecosystem for indoor farming [28]. Figure 3 shows a
schematic diagram of the aquaponics VF [7]. Aquaponic systems offer many advantages,
such as faster growth rate, maturity and yields of crops, improved food security and food
sovereignty, decreased growing area, reduced water stress in hot weather, and no need for
continuous maintenance.

2.1.3. Skygreen 
In this way, VF was introduced by a company called Skygreen in Singapore, whic
brought about a groundbreaking revolution in the field of vertical agriculture [7]. The V
system from Skygreens is made up of rotating tiers of forming troughs connected by a
A-shape aluminum frame. The troughs spin around the aluminum frame to ensure tha
the vegetation receives consistent amounts of daylight, drainage, and nutrients as the
pass through the structure’s unique features. This is the first ultra-low-carbon hydrauli
firm, in which the plants produced on the running shelf continue to rotate throughout th
day. In this way, all the plants can get water and light equally [26]. Figure 4 shows a d

numerous advantages, including the use of green urban technologies to grow healthy
fresh, and tasty vegetables with the least amount of soil, water, and electricity.

2.2. General Structure of Vertical Farm
VF is a type of high-quality UF yield production that comprises bringing manifests in
controlled conditions and utilizing soilless development techniques in multi-story struc-
tures inside the urban framework [36–40]. The work in [37,40] reported a technique to
deal with tending to the future pattern of reducing farming assets, evolving atmosphere,
and different elements, including VF’s idea. The authors in [38,39] suggested a VF has the
efﬁciency for food production lasting through the year in an air-conditioned competence,
reducing carrying expenses, with more prominent control of sanitation and biosecurity,
and generously diminished contributions regarding water gracefully, pesticides, herbi-
cides, and composts. In [40], the authors suggested the validity of VF atmosphere reasons
which plant development inside the building structures includes less encapsulated energy
and deliveries less contamination than some horticultural practices on normal land. The
study in [41,42] proposed utilizing high rises buildings to develop food called Skyfarms
or yield production factories. The work in [43,44] showed a method is to use a solitary
tall glasshouse plan with numerous racks of yields stacked vertically. It is a method of
farming initially but different from the other traditional methods. It is an expansion of
the greenhouse aquaculture cultivating model and addresses issues identifying with the
utilization of soils, for example, the prerequisite for herbicides, pesticides, and manures.

2.3. Material and Components of Vertical Farm 
Commercial urban agriculture can be made more sustainable because it can reduce 
irrigation water waste by 40–60% and increase yields by 3–4 times when hydroponically 
nutrient-rich water is stored and reused in automatic and climate-controlled buildings 
[45,46]. Although the use of this technology in indoor VF will be more costly due to the 
use of artificial materials, the cost will be higher due to the use of local materials. 
However, in [47], the authors indicated it is also possible to make commercial UF 
sustainable and profitable by using smart technologies. 
2.3.1. Soil 
Soil plays a vital element in VF topology in terms of its measurements, quality for 
each tree. In [48,49], the authors proposed building integrated farming that comprises 
adjusting soil-less development methods, such as hydroponics. It utilizes on top of such 
that abuses collaborations between the building and the farming performances. The 
study reported in [50] presented low-tech alternatives such as rooftop open-air on-soil 
farming. The work in [51] addressed a hydroponic agriculture system to manage ade-
quate products to optimize the use of soil that water requires 10.71 m2 each day. How-
ever, in [51,52], the authors proposed in VF using hydroponics method where no utilizes 
of soil which widely used in advanced greenhouses worldwide

to optimize the use of soil that water requires 10.71 m2 each day. However, in [51,52], the
authors proposed in VF using hydroponics method where no utilizes of soil which widely
used in advanced greenhouses worldwide.
2.3.2. Lighting
Lighting plays an important role in making food for a crop in VF [53]. In the VF
system, since the trees are one on top of the other, sunlight cannot reach the trees in the
middle of the day. However, to solve this problem, the trees should be kept in a place
where they get enough sunlight at the beginning of the day and artiﬁcial light all time. The
conventional light-emitting diode (LED) technologies produce 28% efﬁciency. However,
making an indoor agriculture system cost-effective LED requires more efﬁciency, at least
around 50–60% [54,55]. The work in [55] proposed two techniques LED or high-pressure
sodium, to overcome such lighting issues to grow better crops in VF. In [56], the authors
indicated the application of LED as greenhouse lighting, and it becomes popular in VF in
terms of its lower energy requirements, long lifetime, low cost.
Plants require blue light with a wavelength of 610–720 nm and red light with a
wavelength of 400–520 nm. The study in [57], evaluated the use of LEDs in place of natural
light to illuminate the plant. The ﬁndings indicated that the LED light would assist plants
in growing with the used of 3:1 ratio of red and blue LED light to produce a reddish purple
color. The perfect color combination for plants and vegetables has been determined to be
blue and red. This composition is ideal for promoting rapid plant growth. The combination
of 23% blue and 77% red produces optimal plant growth performance [58].
2.3.3. Solar PV
Solar PV is a farming method but different from the other traditional methods such as
rooftop VF. It is gaining more popularity in terms of enormous used solar which is available
in the urban area [59]. Usually, the crop growth boosts up in the VF by photosynthetic
active radiation, and it is not enough Solar power must be collected by a collection of
mirrors from the city’s structures to reduce the need for supplemental artiﬁcial light [60].
As a result, VF is looking for alternatives by looking at solar PV as a source of energy.
2.3.4. Water
In agriculture such as VF, water is used to produce fresh crops. The use of agricultural
water makes it possible to produce crops, vegetables. The study in [61] addressed a VF
technology that requires 70% less water and the amount of water required is also recyclable.
Historically, users of traditional agricultural systems were expected to manually check the
water level in their water tanks. Moreover, uncontrolled water use leads to wastage of
water, which ultimately causes water scarcity to terminate. In [25], the author indicated
that showers and washing hand water could be used by ﬁltered other than rainwater in
the smart VF system, which may help optimize water use. In [61,62], the authors indicated
through the geoponics method, water utilizes less than 70% in VF, while the hydroponics
technique still using 70% water. Water automation systems can be used in VF technologies
to reduce human effort and error. Additionally, users can use an Android program to turn
on and off the water pump. This is an effective and cost-effective method of minimizing
water waste and human labor. Additionally, [62] addressed an integrated device built on
an Android application that controls and tests the water pump and water level in smart
farming (SF).
3. Technologies in Smart Vertical Farming
VF is a state-of-the-art technology that has given an open scope to modern farming
in a rural environment and range [25,63]. The aim of this study, sincerity towards USVF
and the use of technology, have invented this new type of agricultural thinking. The

agriculture industry could be further developed by employing new technologies in the era
of modernization.
3.1. Sensors Technology in USVF
The agriculture ﬁeld in the world is progressing day by day. For six decades, au-
tomation played a vital role in industries to increase their productivity and decrease their
expenses. In the last two decades, agriculture has begun to follow a parallel pattern, using
GPS and sensor-based devices [21,64,65]. Agriculture sensors are the sensors used in smart
VF. These sensors provide farmers with data that enables them to track and optimize crops
in response to changing environmental circumstances [66]. These sensors are integrated
into weather stations, drones, and robots used in the agriculture industry [67]. To realize VF,
technology makes extensive use of sensors and actuators (dubbed smart equipment) that
communicate with other devices autonomously. This section provides a detailed discussion
about sensor types and uses in VF applications. Figure 7 shows the block diagram of simple
sensors and smart sensors.

SF is the key to developing sustainable agriculture. As a result, USVF is a cut-
ting-edge agricultural technology that significantly increases the yield obtained from 
traditional agriculture. The USVF is moving toward becoming a quickly developing 
farming system in the future. Additionally, the SF system entails integrating information 
and communication technology into agricultural machines, vehicles, and sensors. A 
sensor is a system that detects and transmits an impulse in response to a physical stim-
ulus such as heat, illumination, sound, vibration, magnetism, or a specific motion. By the 
name of VF automation system using different types of sensors, it can automate most of 
VF processes, such as we can control watering system or flow control, the moisture level 
of soil, crops health [68]. However, existing agriculture technology faces challenges in 
growing crops due to various issues, such as unstable environmental situation, limitation 
of more food, safety, reliability, cost, life cycle, and overall management [69–71]. There-
fore, advanced USVF technology sensors generally used to reduce human effort, easy to 
handle, more effective and more efficient. Figure 8 shows the sensors and actuators types

[73,74]. Figure 9 shows a block diagram of soil and plant sensors in USVF.

Texture Sensor 
In agriculture, the texture sensor is used to determine the soil surface, bulk density 
(compaction), and variability in soil depth (depth of topsoil, depth to hardpan). The 
study in [75] reported various technical types of equipment available for on-farm used to

Sensor for Organic Matter
Organic matter is the portion of soil that is composed of plant and animal residues at
different stages of decomposition, soil organism cells and tissues, and substances synthe-
sized by soil species. The work in [77] suggested that soil organic matter sensors could be
used to track a variety of beneﬁcial effects on the physical and chemical properties of the
soil, as well as the soil’s capacity to provide regulatory ecosystem services. The existence
of soil organic matter sensors, in particular, is regarded as important for soil functions and
consistency. The study in [78], soil organic matter sensors track soil functioning, including
changes in soil composition, accumulation, water preservation, soil fertility, pollutant
absorption and retention, buffering capability, and nutrient cycling with storage. In [79],
the authors state that soil organic matter sensors used to select sustainable soil to produce
urban VF crops.
Moisture Sensor
The device used to measure soil moisture or any other media is known as a moisture
sensor [80]. Mostly, the humidity sensor and the moisture sensor are the same, but they are
different in the sense that humidity sensor measures water content in the atmosphere or
our surroundings, but moisture sensor measures the water content in a speciﬁc medium
such as soil, sponges [81]. Therefore, it is perfect for build an automatic watering system or
monitor the soil moisture of smart VF. For measuring moisture of content, there are two
methods as shown in Figure 10.

dium such as soil, sponges [81]. Therefore, it is perfect for build an automatic watering 
system or monitor the soil moisture of smart VF. For measuring moisture of content, 
there are two methods as shown in Figure 10. 
 
Figure 10. Methods of moisture sensors. 
The indirect method is a technique used to measure soil moisture. In this technique, 
we estimate the soil moisture by a calibrated relationship by some other measurable 
variables such as current and resistance [82]. These methods are less accurate than the 
direct method but are less time-consuming. Their suitability depends on several param-
eters such as cost, accuracy, installation durability [83]. This volumetric method measures 
the volume of the water content in the soil. It can be used to measure the soil saturation 
(i.e., the fraction of the total volume of the soil which is filled with the soil aqueous solu-
tion). It can be used to determine the relationship of moisture at depth to the moisture at 
the unit surface area. This method is also comparable with other parameters such as 
precipitation, deep drainage, and transpiration. 
pH Sensor 
A pH sensor is an electronic device that utilizes to measure acidity, power of hy-
drogen value, and alkalinity of substances. The use of pH sensors plays a vital role in the

pH Sensor
A pH sensor is an electronic device that utilizes to measure acidity, power of hydrogen
value, and alkalinity of substances. The use of pH sensors plays a vital role in the industry,
agriculture, manufacturing, pharmaceutical, etc. [21,84,85]. In [84,86], the authors indicated
using a pH sensor to ﬁnd the nutrient level of agriculture soil that connects to the Arduino
microcontroller, reducing fertilizers used in smart agriculture. The authors also addressed
pH sensors to collect and monitor real data from different soil of SF, which save to cloud
server. However, the unnecessary growth of the plant in the agriculture farm does not
grow well for crops. Therefore, to overcome such a problem, pH sensor plays a vital role
in SF.
Sensor of Electrical Conductivity
The electrical conductivity sensor is largely used in SF to measure the soil solute
concentration [87,88]. However, there are still some limitations to use it properly in the SF.
In [88], the authors addressed the soil contains some water and salt that harmful to grow
up crops, which can measure using an electrical conductivity sensor based on Faraday’s
law. The study in [89] showed an electrical conductivity sensor used to overcome soil
limitations, such as measuring soil pore water, reducing cost and saving working time.
Temperature Sensor
Usually, temperature sensors are used to measure soil temperature in the farm
plant [90,91]. The work in [90] indicated the importance of plant growth based on tem-
perature control processes such as photosynthesis, transpiration, absorption. In [92], the
authors proposed an aeroponic system in agriculture, which indicated plant growth and
development through temperature. Therefore, the temperature sensor plays an important
role to measure soil temperature, which increases the efﬁciency of plant growth and more
crops.
Electromagnetic Sensor
Electromagnetic sensors calculate the potential of soil particles to conduct or produce
electrical charge using electric circuits [73,93]. As these sensors are used, the soil is now an
electromagnetic loop, and any changes in local conditions have an instant impact on the
output captured by a data acquisition system. In [93], the authors indicated electromagnetic
sensors for soil measure have become smaller, more rugged, faster, more accurate, more
energy-efﬁcient, wireless, and smarter.
3.3. Smartphone Sensor Technologies in Smart Farming
Telecommunications advances are allowing the rapid and more reliable delivery of
sensed data on a global scale. A sensor is a device that detects and reacts to an electri-
cal signal. Traditional phone sensing systems need additional infrastructure, which is
unaffordable to the majority of consumers. Smartphones have advanced at a breakneck
pace in recent years, and they have evolved into an integral part of everyday life. The
sensors embedded in them allow a variety of mobile application, which are assisting and
transforming our way of life. Mobile sensors technology can enhance UF by improving
connectivity, increasing the ﬂow of information, ensuring traceability for large buyers, and
creating economic opportunities [94,95]. This section illustrates concepts of mobile sensors
technology in SF that are currently using in the smartphone and comparison among several
research outcomes.
Sensors are a tool that measures a physical amount and converts to a signal which
can be read and utilized by other devices. Most of the mobile sensors are equipped on
smartphones. Numerous forms of sensors are available nowadays, and several common
smartphones include accelerometers, GPS, illumination sensors, temperature sensors, gy-
roscope, and barometer. These sensors evolved into a high-quality database for tracking
many facets of a user’s everyday activities. Three types of sensors are installed in smart-
Electronics 2021, 10, 1422
13 of 40
phones: motion sensors, ambient sensors, and location sensors [94]. The following Table 1
summarizes and illustrates a set of popular sensors found in today’s mainstream smart-
phones. The ﬁrst category, motion sensors such as accelerometers, gyroscopes, gravity
sensors, and rotational vector sensors, provides acceleration force and rotational force mea-
surements. Environmental sensors, on the other hand, provide observations of the ambient
environment. This includes measuring the ambient air temperature with a thermometer
and the atmospheric pressure with a barometer, as well as lighting with a photometer. Place
sensors, on the other hand, provide information about the physical location of the system.
Magnetometers, GPS, and orientation sensors are examples of location sensors [94].

3.3.1. Accelerometer Sensor
Accelerometer sensors are largely used in the SF to predict and assist with necessary
maintenance [96,97]. The study reported in [96] presented accelerometer sensor plays an
important role in monitoring the conventional use of equipment in the SF. In [98], the
authors indicated accelerometer sensors detect running components or motor’s health
conditions through motion, speed, vibration inconsistencies. Therefore, users can easily
track the component health condition using an android application in SF.
3.3.2. Gyroscope Sensor
A gyroscope is a system that uses the theory of conservation of angular momentum

areas, including science ﬁction and mobile devices [94,99]. In [94], the authors indicated a
gyroscope sensors application to detect conventional equipment rotation in SF using an
android phone. However, the drawback of this gyroscope sensors application in smart VF

difﬁcult to implement in terms of requiring a complex mathematical model to conducts a
signal.
3.3.3. Light Sensor
The term “smart agriculture techniques” refers to the practice of using a sensor system
to regulate the amount of light available [100,101]. The light sensor is a semiconductor chip
that detects the presence or absence of light and darkness. Photoresistors, photodiodes,
and phototransistors are all examples of light sensors. The study in [100] proposed artiﬁcial
lighting as a suitable option to conﬁrm most of the time availability of light for the healthy
plant in smart agriculture. However, the drawback of artiﬁcial lighting in the SF fault
ﬁnds out and unnecessary light in the daytime. Therefore, to detect the fault and On/OFF
artiﬁcial light system in the smart farm using an android phone application which reduces
the human effort and optimize cost [102].
3.3.4. Magnetometer Sensor
Basically, magnetometer sensors are used in SF to measure the direction of the workers,
such as walk forwards, walk backward, run, harvest fruit. The advantages of using the
sensors by mobile phone which help farmers with decision-making, enabling them to have
a deeper, richer knowledge about their farms [94].
3.3.5. Proximity Sensor
The proximity sensors utilize to monitor crop ﬂow during collection data in VF [94].
In [71], the authors usually indicated crop plant temperature control from a heat source
measured by a proximity sensor in SF. The study in [94,103] reported proximity sensors are
utilized to measure grain yield in the agriculture farm, which helps to reduce human effort,
measure accurate crop, save time, and can work in harsh environmental conditions. How-
ever, proximity sensors’ drawbacks can detect only the metallic target, and the operation
range also limited.
3.3.6. Humidity Sensor
Nowadays, the demand for humidity sensors is gaining popularity in SF [104,105].
The work in [105] addressed humidity sensors play an important role in SF, such as tracking
the water level of plants, environmental monitoring, which suitable time for proper crop
selection. The authors also indicated the humidity sensors are steady and ﬂexible at
measure bio-interface. Nevertheless, challenges still occur for the awareness of capable
and wide-scale manufacture of adjustable humidity sensors for bio-interface applications.
In [106], the authors indicated humidity sensors increase their demand in agriculture
farming by controlling the humidity created by porous materials, namely metal-organic
structure due to their large porosity and tunable shape. However, the drawback of this
metal-organic structure is its response time is high and displays a narrow sensing range.
3.3.7. Carbon-Based Sensor
The carbon-based sensor has many beneﬁts as opposed to other types of sensors. The
carbon-based structures used in sensor applications are carbon nanotube (CNT), nanodia-
mond (ND), fullerene (FLN) and graphene (GPN). Due to their superior electrical, thermal,
mechanical, and chemical properties, nanodiamonds, fullerenes, graphenes, nanotubes,
and hybrid structures have been widely used. Carbon nanostructures, as described in [107],
exhibit a high degree of selectivity, especially when functionalized. Carbon nanostructures
have grown in popularity as gas sensor applications due to their promising structure,
which enables gas detection and quantiﬁcation. The high surface-to-volume ratio and
hollow composition make this material suitable for gas adsorption and desorption. The
identiﬁcation and quantiﬁcation of polluting gases, especially hydrogen sulﬁde (H2S),
carbon monoxide (CO), carbon dioxide (CO2), nitrogen oxide (NOx), ammonia (NH3), and
methane, is one of the primary applications of carbonaceous materials as gas sensors (CH4).

The special properties of nanomaterials, such as their compact scale, large surface area, and
reactivity, make them ideal for use in agriculture. CNTs (carbon nanotubes) are primarily
used in agriculture for germination rate, initial crop production, pesticides, and biosensor
diagnostic tools and evaluation [108]. Nanotechnology is important in the puriﬁcation
of water. Carbon nanotubes can be used to purify wastewater [109,110]. Adsorption and
degradation/detoxiﬁcation are the primary strategies for removing contaminants from
samples using carbon nanotubes. Additionally, not only is it necessary to remove toxins
from various environmental compartments, but it is also necessary to control pollution
levels. Carbon-based nanomaterials can be used to create novel, highly effective biochemi-
cal sensors for the detection of chemical compounds at extremely low concentrations in
a variety of environments. In [111], the authors stated that carbon-based nanomaterials
will account for 40% of all nanotechnology contributions to agriculture, both as additives
and active parts. The bulk of these implementations are currently in their infancy, and this
section will highlight some interesting methods.
3.4. Sensors Technology in Farming to Monitoring of the Healthy Growth of Crops
The proper growth of plants is important to enhance the quality of the crop in the smart
VF. The economic and beneﬁt depend on the proper healthy growth of the plant. However,
there are some essential elements that are required for the growth of plants, such as crop life,
nutrients, crops health condition, and micronutrients [112,113]. Therefore, monitoring the
health condition of each plant of agriculture farming is essential [114]. Therefore, different
types of sensors utilize to overcome such issues in smart VF. Table 2 shows the summary of
the method used for crop health growth monitoring using a different type of camera model
sensors in SF. This list consists of various types, brands, model numbers and application in
SF. The sensor application in SF includes counting faster crop damage accuracy, monitoring
and detecting defect crop growth, and diagnosing the nitrogen of crop and tracking leaf
damage from the insect.

In [115,128] authors proposed Canon PowerShot SX20 and Canon PowerShot SX30
sensors in farming applications because of cheap, easy to manage, and potential versatility
to count faster crop damage accuracy. The study in [116,122] reported a Canon EOS REBEL
T2i and Sony DSC-W80 sensors in agriculture application used to monitor and detect crop
growth. However, these sensors’ drawback is that image quality is still inferior and not
performing well in low light. On the other hand, its advantage performs well in a suitable
lighting atmosphere and low cost. In [117,121], the authors reported visible spectrum
cameras and 8 MP camera sensors to measure the early stages of crops grown in SF
applications. The merit of such sensors might work in various lighting environments with
strong controlling efﬁciency and robustness. Therefore, it is suitable for VF applications.
The study reported in [119,124] proposed high-resolution and Raspberry Pi camera sensors
in agriculture applications to diagnose the nitrogen of crops and track leaf damage from
insects. It is suitable in VF terms of its longevity, fast counting capability, and continuous
act without damage. The study in [120,123] addressed E450 Olympus and ﬂoral reﬂectance
sensors in agriculture application to observation insects on each leaf and plant growth. The
sensors gain popularity in terms of simple to use, deliver robust real data in a short time,
and strong controlling capability. In [125,137], the authors reported an inverted microscope
and plant village sensors in SF application to automatically monitor health conditions in
plants, which is easy to implement, no need complex mathematical model. The authors
in [138–140] reported DFK 23GM021, Hyper HAD CCD, and Logitech digital webcam
sensors in agriculture application to monitor selecting crops in a greenhouse environment
and various weeds automatically. However, those sensors’ limitation is the accuracy
required to be enhanced in terms of data delivery time, efﬁciency, and cost. Therefore, to
overcome these issues optimization techniques can be utilized.
The study in [126,141] reported 0.9R-G and JAI AD-130GE sensors in agriculture
application for proper identiﬁcation of crops cherries and sweet pepper automatically
in the USVF. However, the challenges are its complexity, cost, and overall efﬁciency still
very poor. In [127,142,143], the authors proposed a camcube 3.0, UniﬂyM216, and MV-
VDM033SM/SC sensors in agriculture application to harvest the crops such as apple,
carrot automatically by a robot in SF. The approach has high efﬁciency, low cost, and high
precision for the overall system compared to conventional methods. However, the main
limitations are its monitoring accuracy, such as nighttime, tracking the exact position of
crops. In [129,131,132], the authors proposed Monochrome CCD, SONY NEX5N, and
SONY DSC-W530 sensors in agriculture applications to detect crop growth such as tomato,
potatoes. Therefore, the main advantages of such sensors in USVF overall efﬁciency, large
accuracy, low error, and easy maintenance. In [133,144,145], the authors proposed an
unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) with geolocation, a UAV platform equipped, quadrotor
UAV-RGB, senseFly eBee with RGB and CIR sensors in agriculture application to detect
height, biomass automatically of crop plants. Therefore, the main advantage of such sensors
in SF is that they are stable, perform well, have small defects, are easy to adapt to new
technology, and they have a simple operation.
Figure 11 shows the smartphone applications in agriculture and the camera model
sensors used in VF. The smartphone application for farming, such as data gathering,
farming calculator and news and weather information was included to monitor and
enhance the quality of the crop in the smart VF. The added camera model sensor technology

4. IoT Framework on Smart Farming
With the development of technology and knowledge-science, human thought-
consciousness is developing. As a result, everything is changing. The revolutionary
development of life and human thought in the world over the last few decades is far more
exemplary than the changes in the previous few centuries. The transformation of the
agricultural sector, like all other sectors, is much more pronounced. Information-driven
Electronics 2021, 10, 1422
19 of 40
advances, when all is said in done, are rapidly progressing with the improvement of the IoT
and may turn into a signiﬁcant piece of things to come of farming [146–148]. All modern
methods are now being followed to ensure more production on less land to meet the needs
of the age, for example, IoT technology in USVF. In [149–151], the authors proposed an IoT
a very modern technology in SF in which farmers can ﬁnd out problems of yield, such as
lacking water, crop productivity, yield weakness, and also provide quick solutions to such
issues. In the study [152,153], authors reported a producing efﬁcient yield controlling the
atmosphere situation, soil preparation, crop monitoring by IoT. The study also indicated
IoT delivers real-time sensing data which aids in efﬁcient crop production.
Figure 12 shows details IoT based SF structure. The IoT-based SF framework consists
of six interconnected sub-systems: a physical layer, network layer, middleware layer,
service layer, analytics layer, and user experience layer [154–156]. The physical layer
of SF is consists of various types of components such as sensors, actuators, controllers,
switches, network gateways, routers, etc. The controller is an essential part of this layer
which plays an important role in SF to connect network-related functionalities as well
as other operations of sensors and actuators. The main feature of the network layer is
capable of transferring root-level data from sensors which use different purpose in VF.
The network layer is a vital technical layer for smart cultivating, which is important for
sending speciﬁc information, network connectivity to the application layer. The network
layer incorporates various types of wired and remote interfaces for associating the weeding
machine, food harvester, and for correspondence of machines and sensors with cloud
frameworks. However, the challenge of the network layer in SF where IoT generated a
huge amount of data is not only the reason for storage or maintenance but also the reduction
of network efﬁciency [157,158]. The middleware layer assumes an essential function to
boost IoT security in SF. In [159,160], the authors indicated an IoT-based middleware acts
as device controlling, setting management, sensation, platform ability, and surveillance
relevant tasks. Middleware remains in the middle of the utilization layer and network
layer which are capable of handling information and gives a combination for connection
between these layers. However, the middleware layer includes safe and sensitive data
storage, and data transfer over wireless is extremely difﬁcult in IoT deployments. IoT
cloud support service layer assumes a vital part in giving distributed storage, Software-as-
a-Service (SaaS) to farming issues. Sensor information procurement, materials recognition,
crop health condition data monitoring, factual investigation administrations are cleared to
encourage the detecting, activating, and infection recognition operation [21,68,161]. The
analytics layer’s aim is to ensure big data processing for crop production investigation
yield efﬁciency based on environment condition. Another sensor-based IoT system for
the analytics layer was presented in [162], which ensures crop implement fragmentation,
compression, and a reassembly mechanism. However, the main drawback of the analytics
layer in SF since its direct use on IoT devices is not viewed as sensible [149,163,164]. The
user experience layer is developed to aid the purpose of farmer yield productivity, such
as crop growth condition, efﬁciency, soil quality, and environmental situation. IoT plays
a vital role to monitor, control, and deliver to farmers an overall situation of VF yield
condition by different sensors. However, the main challenges still most of the IoT sensors
power by the battery. Therefore, to overcome these issues, energy harvesting technology
can be utilized to replace batteries.

4.1. IoT Impact on Smart Vertical Farming Applications 
The current world is the world of information technology. Information technology 
services are essential to improve lives and build a sustainable world. That is why infor-
mation technology-based SF can bring new possibilities for improving the livelihood of 
rural and urban people. Providing timely, up-to-date information, marketing, storage 
technology through the IoT, mobile, according to the needs of the farmers, will play an 
important role in ensuring food security and improving the fortunes of the farmers [165–
167]. One of the features of the IoT is that it can adapt to the environment and collect in-
formation from the environment leading to the application of a variety of such technolo-
gies in agriculture. The study in [168] indicated IoT had enhanced the conventional ap-
proach of SF, for example, nanotechnology which enables the creation of small cheap and 
sensors for IoT application. The block diagram of agricultural trends in Figure 13 illus-

The block diagram of agricultural trends in Figure 13 illustrates basic, low-cost technology
relationships through VF, precision agriculture, automatic irrigation scheduling, plant
growth optimization, farmland tracking, greenhouse monitoring, and crop farming process
management [162,169]. The diagram of SF demonstrates the agriculture patterns accessible
and low cost-effective interfaces via secured and faultless network across separate green-
house, farmer, and ﬁeld perceptions. Rural IoT systems that incorporate wireless devices
allow real-time crop and animal monitoring. According to the ﬁgure, two sensor kits have
been performed (Libelium Shrewd Agribusiness Xtreme IoT Vertical Unit and Edit/Plant
Checking Sensor Pack), which measure soil moisture, leaf wetness, temperature, humidity,
performance, and circulation. However, the MooMonitor sensor tracks the animal’s health,
reproduction, nutrition, rumination, and rest. Agriculture servers, gateways, and databases
all play a key role in maintaining agriculture information and delivering rural resources
on-demand to registered users. There are many applications, protocols, and templates in
the farming sector as a whole. Among the trends of IoT, agriculture researches are focused
on network platform, network design, software, stability, and challenges. IoT-based SF

USVF is an approach that uses information and communication technology to de-
termine the exact amount of nutrients and materials needed to achieve maximum yields 
while maintaining crop and soil health and then apply them. It aims to make agriculture 
more sustainable, profitable, and environmentally friendly by reducing unnecessary ex-

learning and artiﬁcial intelligence (AI) will gain popularity, which will change our way
of life [179,180]. With the upward thrust of new digital technologies in the agriculture

domain, there has been exceptional growth in the quantity of data that is being gathered
by way of far-ﬂung sensors, satellites and many others for exclusive functions. The role
of AI in VF includes processes like monitoring the light condition, plant health, humidity,
temperature, etc. The signiﬁcant data that is being gathered ought to only serve fruitfully
when the farmer is capable of obtaining a higher perception of various things involved
with the farm. Therefore, to make sense out of it, this data is operated underneath a range
of AI algorithms via which farmers can collect an applicable understanding of a variety
of processes in general. By 2050, the planet is projected to need 50% more food than it
currently produces. In this scenario, farmers will beneﬁt from AI-enabled technologies
by presenting higher yields and more sustainable resource use [181]. The work in [179]
addressed an IoT technology with exceptional characters and capabilities to analyze and
monitor data from sensors from remote areas such as optical, mechanical, and location
used in the SF. IoT is one of the very high technology concepts in which devices are smarter,
intelligent, low cost, long life, simple maintainers as well as sending informative data
were presented in [182,183]. In [184], the authors indicated SF has the ability to deliver
sustainability and beneﬁcial production, which is founded on inventive technology, such
as IoT. Sensor-based SF frameworks to offer an attractive solution for the farmer were
presented in [185]. The work in [186] proposed IoT advancements can diminish the expense
of labor cost, reduce the human effort and enhance the scale of sensor-based farming system
by information assortment from sensors. Table 3 presents the primary applications and
advantages of each IoT innovation in SF. IoT sensors technology presents the course of
action of various components of an IoT and shows an ideal situation for SF. IoT, known
as potential technology in VF in terms of various sensors uses, dynamic, quick decision-
making, was present in [187,188]. In [189], the authors indicated IoT sensors topology had
kept a huge contribution in SF in quick produce and proﬁt with a short time. Figure 15
shows how SF collects data from various sensors such as moisture sensors, humidity
sensors, temperature sensors, gas sensors, and pH sensors utilizing IoT devices. These
ubiquitous SF topologies enhance data analysis and storage capacity, which able to connect
with a different communication protocol such as a smartphone and computers.

4.4. IoT Supported Hardware Utilized in Smart Farming
Numerous IoT-enabled hardware systems are available for use in agricultural realms.
The following section denotes various hardware controller boards that are utilized for
SF. A number of various IoT supported hardware platforms exist to be used within the
agricultural domains. Table 4 categorizes current and legacy platforms based on main
criteria [104,156,190,191].
Communication protocols are needed for IoT systems because they modify network
connectivity and device coupling. Protocols for communication allow devices to share data
over a network. The protocols deﬁne the formats for data transmission, data encoding,
interface addressing systems, and packet routing from source to destination. Protocols
also perform additional tasks such as sequence management, ﬂow control, and packet
retransmission. Table 5 compares multiple wireless networking systems based on a variety
of criteria [156,192].
Many factors can affect the growth of plants, especially the environment. SF is a big
way for better production within a short time as well as reduces human stress. Sensors are
used in precision agriculture to collect data that enables farmers to easily track, manage, and
optimize crops and adapt to evolving environmental factors through the implementation
of smart technology such as IoT devices. Table 6 shows the list of sensor module that can
be used in SF.

Agriculture operates somewhat differently today than it did a few decades before,
primarily due to technical advancements such as sensors, processors, robots, and informa-
tion technology. Agriculture now routinely makes use of emerging technology, including
robotics, temperature and moisture sensors, aerial photography, and GPS. These advanced
technologies, precision agriculture, and robotic systems allow businesses to operate more
proﬁtably, efﬁciently, safely, and sustainably. The primary objective of the Internet of things
is to create a vast network by integrating various sensor devices such as GPS, remote
sensing (RS), radio-frequency identiﬁcation (RFID), laser scanners, and networks in or-
der to comprehend the knowledge exchange of global things. IoT can refer to millions
of networked embedded smart devices capable of accumulating data about themselves,
their world, and other connected smart devices and linking this data to other devices and
systems through the ubiquitous Internet [195].
Ambient daylight, ambient temperature, soil moisture, and humidity are all control-
lable parameters of vertical farming. In addition to the vertical columns, the ambient
parameters must be controlled for each stack, necessitating the use of a separate collection
of sensors for each vertical stack. These sensors produce a large amount of data, necessitat-
ing the use of an effective data management system. Numerous automation techniques
are used to maximize resource use, including the integration of actuation by automated
irrigation systems, as well as wireless monitoring via IoT in the VF, which is capable of
managing sensor data effectively, identifying duplicate sensor readings, and visualizing it
through web-based applications.
4.5. Secure Cloud on Smart Vertical Farming System
The growth of a country’s population and massive industrial development, mainly in
urban areas, lead to a variety of urbanization problems, including housing, food demands,
schooling, health, and poverty. A new farming technique that utilizes minimal land
area while producing a large crop with a secure aspect is highly desired. In [196], the
authors addressed a two-factor authentication (2FA) scheme to bolster the system’s security
measures. Since the electronic device mounted on the indoor farming hydroponic system
communicates over the Internet, the 2FA technique is used. Due to the fact that this
hydroponic system would be installed inside the user’s house, this electronic gadget
will be wired to the user’s home’s network or WIFI. This linking of the computer to the
Internet necessitates proper network protection to mitigate the possibility of data leakage
and sabotage. The 2FA framework will be applied in this system through access codes
generated by the gateway (NodeMCU) and a mobile application for access veriﬁcation.
Figure 16 illustrates the total security scheme’s ﬂowchart using a 2FA mechanism. It starts
with the device module’s controller demanding permission to send and receive data over
the network via the ThingsSentral-based web module. ThingsSentral (TS) is a cloud-based
IoT device network founded by Universiti Kebangsaan Malaysia. By supplying the user,
program, and portal access code to the TS web service, the controller initiates the ﬁrst
authentication order. If the codes are valid, TS will send another authentication order.
The second authentication process generates a request for veriﬁcation and notiﬁcation to
the customer with a phone app that they must authenticate a request before the farming
module can continue operating. The user will authenticate the order if approved, at which
point TS will allow the remainder of the procedure before the controller explicitly stops
it. If the customer fails to authenticate, the whole system is aborted, and the hydroponics
module controller is informed of the request’s denial.

5. Social Acceptance of Urban Farming
The study in [197] addressed as far as a social responsibility of USVF contributes more
in terms of reducing pollution, produce clean air and fresh food without using artiﬁcial
fertilizer. The authors in [198] indicated USVF totally brings new technology to produce
more food using less water, without soil which falls a very good impact on society. In [199],
the authors reviewed 386 urban tenants in Berlin based on yield farming space capacity
in an urban area, cost, human effort, and overall food production efﬁciency. While over
80% of the occupants favored VF on the rooftop of the building in terms of sufﬁcient light
facility, clean air, low pollution, environmental and ﬁnancial beneﬁts, fresh food, easy to
monitor, simple maintenance, etc. Moreover, the greater part of the respondents was eager
to purchase agricultural items. The study also reported in [199] presented a lack of food
insecurity produced from VF of urban dwellers because of air contamination levels in urban
areas. The work in [200] analyzed 18 rooftop farming leaves and soil conditions compared
with the natural crop leaf and soil in Korea. The authors in [201] demonstrated the effect of
rising temperatures on air quality at an outdoor rooftop farm atop a seven-story building
in Brooklyn through an on-site observation attempt. In [202], the authors measured the
pollution level, crop production costs, and monitoring capability in rooftop vegetable farms.
Therefore, a USVF is required to overcome the problem such as air pollution, huge cost,
sufﬁcient food production, various type of crop production all season.
Advantages of Urban Smart Vertical Farming
Due to rapid urbanization, USVF has been introduced to achieve food security in
an urban area. VF can be conceivably gainful in expanding crop production and adding
to maintainable UF. Notable beneﬁts of rising food inside the urban area can be helpful
ecologically, socially, and monetarily. VF can also offer solutions for expanding food safety
worldwide [203]. In [203], the authors indicated several advantages in USVF such as raise
aesthetic beauty, energy generation, urban growth, organic food, preparation for the future,
conservation of resources, VF ﬂexibility, growing higher quality produce, and halting mass
extinction. Besides, the study in [204] addressed that USVF has the beneﬁt of absorbing
polluted carbon-di-oxide from the air and increasing the level of pure oxygen in the air,
environmentally friendly, helps to control air pollution and noise pollution. As a result, it
has a fair weight to maintain air quality. The advantages of USFV protect large houses in
the city from direct sunlight and helps to keep them cool, helps in air ﬁltration by absorbing
dust. On the other hand, the work in [205] addressed beneﬁts of these USVF include
protection from weather-related problems, utilize technologies and devices, helps in air
ﬁltration by absorbing dust, year-round production, huge food production within a small
area of land.
In [206], the authors described a VF plant structure that delivers a controlled environ-
ment, the efﬁciency of farms would generally be autonomous of weather and secure from
a weather-related problem. The work in [22] addressed VF can produce foods year-round.
The study in [22] also presented some crops such as different vegetables, strawberries can
produce all seasons of the year which provides beneﬁt in terms of crops could be sold in
the same infrastructures, they will not need to be transported between production and sale.
Therefore, USVF provides less spoilage, reduces cost, infestation, and energy required than
conventional farming encounters. The advantages of VF reduce the unemployment rate
and make a new job opportunity for urban people who have less education and low expe-
rience. The study reported in [113] also presented a USVF with much ﬂexibility for crop
production, such as water protection, healthy food, cash income, not being labor-intensive,
manageability, marketability, affordability, and sustainability urban growth. The authors
also indicated VF utilize for drip and hydroponics crop production, which can save 50%
lesser water than typical planting and can hold water. The study in [44] also reported
delivering vegetables via VF is simply manageable and farmers do not need much focus
on soil and plant during growing.
Electronics 2021, 10, 1422

Bringing back vegetation in any approach deﬁnitely improves the quality of the
urban environment, which is the main goal of urban VF. Urban agriculture via SF is also
expected to provide environmental beneﬁts to urban dwellers. The improvements in urban
thermal performance and air quality reduce air temperature and energy usage for cooling
loads. Despite providing food security for urbanites, this SF system also able to promote a
conducive and liveable living urban environment. VF can manage by family workers such
as old people, women, young persons because of clean, safe, less dust, ease to marketability
with high proﬁt. All these beneﬁts indicated a signiﬁcant impact on the application of UF
in the city context. USVF is to provide efﬁcient and effective extension services based on
the needs of all classes of growers so that they can make the best use of their resources and
contribute to sustainable agricultural and socio-economic development.
6. Issues and Challenges
VF technology plays an essential role in reducing future food demand, which is one of
the world’s biggest problems today. However, existing VF technology faces few challenges
due to various issues, such as high starting cost, low yield variability, energy reliance and
utilization, producing heat by artiﬁcial lighting was presented in [41,71,73,74]. In [73,74],
the authors reported VF technology would be gradually becoming a non-proﬁt industry if
not focus on addressing the current issues such as energy use, pollution, economy. As a
result, current farming is heading for a crisis due to the evils of climate change and the lack
of signiﬁcant response to the use of more materials. As a result of high production costs
and the adverse effects of harmful chemicals used in agriculture on the environment, smart
technology’s high-material grain production technologies do not seem to be viable enough
to meet the needs of a growing population. Future crop production is considered to be
very risky due to the prevalence of diseases and inorganic impacts in the changing climate.
Other than that, equipment location, space, and environmental issues have to be taken
seriously depending on VF’s design to maximize crop production. Additionally, shape
considerations such as the form and dimensions of the increasing installation, as well as
the spacing between plants, are a source of difﬁculty for VF. Leafy greens and herbs, for
example, the needless vertical spacing between tiers of a vertical rack than ﬂowers or fruit
plants. Additionally, lighting systems should be evaluated for their heat management
characteristics and conﬁgured to mitigate the warmth generated by VF in order to minimize
any possible adverse effect on development, while allowing for adequate air circulation and
ventilation. It is crucial to keep in mind that, while food developed using VF techniques
may be safer to eat than food grown conventionally, hazards may still exist during the
growing phase. Dirt and microorganisms from employees, environmental hazards in the
nutrient medium, water cleanliness and protection, and post-farm handling activities such
as sorting, trimming, and transportation are all examples of such risks. Thus, food safety
management methods such as hazard analysis critical control point analysis, as well as food
safety assessment and testing, are critical in VF, just as they are in traditional agriculture.
7. Conclusions and Recommendations
USVF is a current improvement that shows promise for the future. They will be open
to the insistent and additional combination of current technologies and in turn use growing
convenience and reduce the effort for humans. This review considers the diverse ways of
how a USVF may be monitored, controlled, and built using the IoT, AI, and sensors. The
continuous ﬂow of real data accrued from various sensors or systems deployed in a USVF
is analyzed, and suitable actions must be engaged. Although numerous trends exist, only
a few are being utilized, and they suffer from certain drawbacks. Thus, the utilization of
smart technology shows better performance compared with the existing techniques.
The aim of this study is to recognize SF by conducting a comprehensive analysis of the
state-of-the-art of IoT in USVF and identifying the most commonly used hardware, plat-
forms, network protocols, and technologies, as well as their applicability to the proposed
solution. AI and image processing techniques have become more prevalent in recent work
Electronics 2021, 10, 1422
31 of 40
to develop intelligent farming management. According to the listed IoT applications for SF,
the most prevalent application is crop monitoring. Signiﬁcant advancements in technical
applications have made it possible to integrate and link multiple sensors in networks
quickly. The microcontroller has been instrumental in the rapid growth of IoT projects,
especially in the ﬁeld of precision agriculture.
Based on the literature survey, many past research works are summarized along with
the various sensor types, technology, and techniques that are suitable for the research. This
paper reviews the USVF sensors categories, IoT technology, and hardware components
suitable for monitoring and controlling water level, crop health condition, moisture of soil,
production of yield and environment. The paper has also focused on a comprehensive
explanation of USVF technologies, monitor and control operation, smart automation,
structure, materials, social acceptance, beneﬁt, issues, and various trends and applications.
Finally, the study is suggested constructing a pervasive automation system USVF that
reduces human intervention to a minimum.
The review has proposed some signiﬁcant and selective suggestions for the further
technological developments of USVF based on summarizing, synthesize and viewpoint
from the reviewed literature. Some possible improvements have been addressed in this
review below:
•
Focusing on food production via USVF activities than using other conventional meth-
ods in the city, as mentioned in [7,25,203], USVF produces crops throughout the year,
with greater control over food safety. This will reduce dependency on imported
vegetables.
•
Enhance the user control panel for non-technical users who use SF. As a result, it is
preferable to develop a user-friendly interface for powerful applications in a control
panel and based on user experience.
•
Appropriate IoT architecture must be built to address the issue of partitioned land
cultivation, which is a concern in several countries around the world. Adequate
strategy and preparations should be implemented in advance to address this problem.
•
By combining big data analytics and cloud-based computing, a decision support
framework can be developed to improve and forecast futuristic yield estimation in
crop productivity, quality prediction, crop risk prevention, and irregular growth.
•
Remote-controlled ﬁeld crop planting systems must be built in such a way that au-
tomated planting machines can plate farmers more efﬁciently in the ﬁeld. Cloud
monitoring and remote multi-device visualization have advanced to the point where
operators/owners can track real-time manipulation.
•
Having a real-time livestock tracking system that enables cloud services to improve
the farmer’s economic position intuitively. One basic limitation of the majority of IoT
systems was their inability to conduct rapid data processing over a wide range of
sensor data sources.
•
Use big data analytics to address disease management problems across many crops
and to create a consolidated farming machinery control system suitable for large-scale
agriculture.
•
Develop a predictive method for determining the pollination time.
•
Develop cost management strategies for large-scale agricultural industries dependent
on big data analytics.
•
Provide an easy-to-use climatic knowledge analytic service for farmers.
•
Analyze the proﬁt margins of agri-products using big data modeling and a supply
chain management framework.
•
Analytics can provide farmers with prior knowledge of the potential rot time of
agricultural products, thereby reducing loss and increasing beneﬁt in terms of value.
•
Develop a smart cell phone application to boost the physical farming situation.
•
Develop a web-based scheduling system for pesticide sprays based on crop type, rate,
and time.
Electronics 2021, 10, 1422
32 of 40
•
Create a warning system, as most systems use warnings to inform the operator/farmer
of critical events.
•
Establish irrigation schedules based on sensor data and current weather forecasts.
Irrigation is often applied using sensor data to predict the required amount of water
and electricity accurately. Irrigation schemes, for example, often make use of real-time
weather forecasts to minimize water and energy consumption and prevent excessive
irrigation.
•
Device security is a critical issue. Develop a two-factor authentication scheme to
bolster the protection of the affordable indoor hydroponic system.
•
Additional research should be conducted on plants’ tolerance for elevated EC and/or
pH. Knowing how resistant plants are too extreme pH levels enables device designers
to create solutions that handle hydroponic systems efﬁciently.
•
Drone based pesticide sprayer can be made for an automatic spray of pesticides and
fertilizers to get better quality of crops with increased quantity. It could help the
farmers to spray pesticides evenly throughout their agricultural lands.
•
For a smart storage house, we can install humidity and temperature sensors that can
automatically turn the exhaust fan ON when certain humidity or temperature reaches
the temperature danger zone for food. For food, this danger temperature zone is
between 41 and 135 degrees for height.
•
For water and food control for cattle, we can use conveyor belts to automatically
supply food to cattle.
•
Increase in monetary income for urban dwellers that uses the smart urban farming
system to grow vegetables and sells unconsumed vegetables.
•
We can install a biogas plant in the farmhouse to meet all the electric requirements
and to fully use the waste materials of cattle.
•
We can also install a circuit to automatically get the power meter reading and electricity
bills on our cell phone and hence get up to date about the power consumption of
USVF.
•
Atmospheric pollutants due to being in an urban environment have a negative effect
on the plants, therefore by providing sufﬁcient water to plants (this aids in pollution
removal and temperature reduction), we utilize long-lived and low-maintenance trees.
•
fsUtilize carbon-based nanomaterials can be used as gas sensors to combat air pol-
lution, which has a detrimental effect on plant health, by detecting and quantifying
polluting gases, primarily hydrogen sulﬁde (H2S) and carbon monoxide (CO) based
in [107,108].

A systematic review of automated systems for real-time irrigation management

1. INTRODUCTION
The challenge of feeding a growing population with finite resources is becoming increasingly pressing. By 2050, the world population is expected to reach 9.7 billion, necessitating a 70% increase in food production (Falkenmark and Rockstrom, 2009). Irrigation plays a crucial role in enhancing crop yields and agricultural productivity to meet this growing demand. Studies have shown that irrigation can significantly increase crop water productivity, contributing to increased food production (Ali and Talukder, 2008; Playan and Mateos, 2005). However, water scarcity poses a significant challenge, with many regions facing water deficits and the need for improved water management practices (Falkenmark and Rockstrom, 2009). Optimizing irrigation schedules and doses based on crop requirements and environmental conditions is essential for maximizing yield and quality while minimizing water use (Zhang et al., 2024). The necessity of scalable water-efficient practices for increasing food demand cannot be overstated. Techniques such as regulated deficit irrigation, magnetically treated water, and the use of drought-tolerant crops like sorghum have shown promise in improving water productivity and ensuring food security (Mehmood et al., 2023; Putti et al., 2023; Hadebe et al., 2016). As the global food challenge intensifies, it is imperative to critically evaluate the current state and future potential of irrigation management systems to guide research, innovation, and implementation efforts towards fully autonomous, scalable solutions.

Despite the importance of irrigation in addressing the global food challenge, traditional irrigation management techniques, such as manual scheduling and timer-based systems, have significant limitations. These methods are often labor-intensive, inefficient, and less adaptable to changing conditions (Savin et al., 2023). Manual and timer-based scheduling can lead to high operational costs and inefficient water use (Raghavendra, Han, and Shin, 2023). The reliance on manual intervention and predetermined schedules limits their adaptability to changing environmental conditions, crop water requirements, and soil moisture levels (Kaptein et al., 2019). Sensor-based irrigation systems offer an alternative, enabling real-time adjustments based on soil water status measurements (Kaptein et al., 2019). However, the adoption of these systems in commercial settings has been limited, often requiring extensive input from researchers (Kim et al., 2014; Lea-Cox et al., 2018; Ristvey et al., 2018). The limitations of traditional irrigation management techniques highlight the need for scalable, automated solutions for greater efficiency in irrigation management. Automated systems that collect real-time data, analyze it, and make autonomous irrigation decisions can lead to improved water use efficiency and increased crop productivity (Champness et al., 2023; Wu et al., 2022). To fully understand the potential of automated systems, it is necessary to examine the automation of each part of the irrigation management pipeline and analyze the effectiveness and efficiency of integrated end-to-end solutions.

The emergence of smart irrigation management and IoT marks a significant shift from historical irrigation practices. Modern approaches rely on vast data and analysis algorithms, leveraging technologies such as remote sensing, sensor networks, weather data, and computational algorithms (Atanasov, 2023; Bellvert et al., 2023; Kumar et al., 2023). IoT plays a vital role in collecting vast amounts of data through sensors, data transmission, and tailored networks, enabling real-time monitoring and control of irrigation systems (Liakos, 2023; Zuckerman et al., 2024). These advancements in data collection and analysis have the potential to revolutionize irrigation management, allowing for more precise and efficient water use. However, challenges such as processing diverse data sources, data integration, and lack of integrated data analysis hamper the full benefit of IoT in irrigation management (Dave et al., 2023). The current fragmented approach in smart irrigation, focusing on individual components rather than the entire system, limits the potential for fully autonomous, real-time end-to-end irrigation management (Togneri et al., 2021). To address these challenges and fully realize the potential of smart irrigation management, there is a need for automating and integrating each section of the irrigation management pipeline, from sensor/weather data collection and transmission to processing, analysis, decision-making, and automated action (McKinion and Lemmon, 1985). This integration requires a thorough investigation of the role of interoperability and standardization in enabling seamless communication and compatibility between components within the automated irrigation management pipeline.

Machine learning (ML) plays a significant role in processing vast data, predicting plant stress, modeling climate effects, and optimizing irrigation in smart irrigation management systems. ML algorithms can analyze data collected from sensors and weather stations to determine optimal irrigation schedules (Vianny et al., 2022). However, the potential of ML is often constrained by manual steps, such as data interpretation, decision-making on irrigation timing and volume, and system adjustments. Automating ML integration to allow direct action from insights to irrigation execution, removing bottlenecks and achieving real-time adaptability, is crucial for fully autonomous irrigation management (Barzallo-Bertot et al., 2022). By integrating ML into automated systems, the irrigation management pipeline can become more seamless and efficient, enabling real-time decision-making and action based on data-driven insights. To achieve this level of automation and integration, it is essential to identify gaps and propose solutions for seamless integration across the automated irrigation management system, aiming to achieve fully autonomous, scalable irrigation management.

To achieve seamless integration across the automated irrigation management system, interoperability and standardization are critical. Interoperability allows different system components, such as sensors, actuators, and software, to communicate and exchange data effectively, while standardization ensures that data is represented in a consistent format (Santos et al., 2020). Standardized protocols and data formats are essential for achieving seamless integration and ensuring compatibility between components in real-time irrigation management systems (Robles et al., 2022; Hatzivasilis et al., 2018). Existing and emerging standards, such as OGC SensorThings API and ISO 11783, have applicability to real-time irrigation management systems (Hazra et al., 2021). However, challenges such as data quality, scalability, reliability, and security need to be addressed to fully realize the potential of interoperability and standardization in automated irrigation management systems (Hazra et al., 2021). Addressing these challenges is crucial for enabling the seamless integration of components within the automated irrigation management pipeline, which is essential for achieving fully autonomous, scalable irrigation management. A comprehensive evaluation of the role of interoperability and standardization in enabling the integration of components within the automated irrigation management pipeline is necessary to guide future research and implementation efforts.
The primary objective of this systematic review is to critically evaluate the current state and future potential of real-time, end-to-end automated irrigation management systems that integrate IoT and machine learning technologies for enhancing agricultural water use efficiency and crop productivity.

By addressing these objectives, this systematic review aims to provide a comprehensive and critical evaluation of the current state and future potential of real-time, end-to-end automated irrigation management systems. Its intention is to guide future research, innovation, and implementation efforts to achieve fully autonomous, scalable irrigation management that can contribute to addressing the global food challenge.

3. DATA COLLECTION TO CLOUD: AUTOMATION AND REAL-TIME PROCESSING
3.1. Irrigation management data
The success of automated irrigation management systems relies heavily on the collection, transmission, and analysis of various types of data. The most applicable data types for irrigation management include soil moisture, canopy temperature, weather data, and plant physiological parameters (Farooq et al., 2019; Li et al., 2019; Olivier et al., 2021; Evett et al., 2020). These data are typically collected from a range of sources, including in-field sensors, remote sensing platforms, weather stations, and manual measurements (Li et al., 2019; Karimi et al., 2018).
Soil moisture data is arguably the most critical type of data for irrigation management, as it directly reflects the water available to plants and can be used to determine the optimal timing and amount of irrigation (Olivier et al., 2021; Intrigliolo & Castel, 2006). Soil moisture sensors, such as tensiometers, capacitance probes, and time-domain reflectometry (TDR) sensors, can provide real-time measurements of soil water content at various depths (Farooq et al., 2019). These sensors can be deployed in a network configuration to capture spatial variability in soil moisture across a field (Karimi et al., 2018).
Canopy temperature data is another valuable type of data for irrigation management, as it can be used to assess plant water stress and adjust irrigation accordingly (Evett et al., 2020). Infrared thermometers and thermal cameras can be used to measure canopy temperature, which is influenced by factors such as air temperature, humidity, wind speed, and plant water status (Li et al., 2019). When plants experience water stress, they tend to close their stomata to reduce water loss, leading to an increase in canopy temperature (Evett et al., 2020). By monitoring canopy temperature and comparing it to reference values, automated irrigation systems can detect plant water stress and trigger irrigation events to maintain optimal plant health and productivity (Li et al., 2019).
Weather data, including temperature, humidity, precipitation, wind speed, and solar radiation, are essential for predicting crop water requirements and scheduling irrigation events (Akilan & Baalamurugan, 2024). Weather stations equipped with various sensors can provide real-time measurements of these parameters, which can be used as inputs for crop water requirement models, such as the FAO-56 Penman-Monteith equation (Li et al., 2019). These models estimate crop evapotranspiration (ET) based on weather data and crop-specific coefficients, allowing for the calculation of irrigation requirements (Intrigliolo & Castel, 2006). By integrating weather data into automated irrigation systems, irrigation schedules can be dynamically adjusted based on changing environmental conditions, ensuring that crops receive the optimal amount of water at the right time (Akilan & Baalamurugan, 2024).
When collecting and utilizing these data types, several considerations must be taken into account, including the volume, frequency, format, and source of the data (Farooq et al., 2019). The volume of data generated by automated irrigation systems can be substantial, especially when high-resolution sensors are deployed at a large scale (Bastidas Pacheco et al., 2022). This necessitates the use of efficient data storage, processing, and transmission technologies to handle the data load (Farooq et al., 2019). The frequency of data collection is another important consideration, as it directly impacts the temporal resolution of the data and the ability to detect rapid changes in plant water status or environmental conditions (Bastidas Pacheco et al., 2022). Bastidas Pacheco et al. (2022) demonstrated that collecting full pulse resolution data from water meters provides more accurate estimates of event occurrence, timing, and features compared to aggregated temporal resolutions, highlighting the importance of selecting appropriate data collection frequencies to ensure the quality and usefulness of the data for irrigation management.
The format of the data is also crucial, as it determines the compatibility and interoperability of the data with various analysis tools and platforms (Farooq et al., 2019). Standardized data formats, such as JSON, XML, or CSV, can facilitate data exchange and integration between different components of the automated irrigation system (Zhang et al., 2023). The source of the data is another important consideration, as it can impact the reliability, accuracy, and spatial coverage of the data (Farooq et al., 2019). For example, in-field sensors provide highly localized measurements, while remote sensing platforms, such as satellites or drones, can provide data at larger spatial scales (Li et al., 2019). By combining data from multiple sources, automated irrigation systems can achieve a more comprehensive understanding of crop water requirements and optimize irrigation management accordingly (Farooq et al., 2019).
Data quality, accuracy, and reliability are paramount in irrigation management, as they directly impact the effectiveness of decision-making processes and the efficiency of water use (Gupta et al., 2020). Inaccurate or unreliable data can lead to suboptimal irrigation decisions, resulting in crop stress, yield losses, or wasted water resources (Ramli & Jabbar, 2022). Gupta et al. (2020) emphasized the critical importance of data security and privacy in smart farming systems, as the leakage of sensitive agricultural data can cause severe economic losses to farmers and compromise the integrity of the automated irrigation system. The authors also highlighted the need for robust authentication and secure communication protocols to prevent unauthorized access to smart farming systems and protect data in transit (Gupta et al., 2020).
Ramli and Jabbar (2022) addressed the challenges associated with implementing real-time, automated irrigation systems, including data quality, scalability, reliability, and security. They proposed solutions and best practices based on the analysis of case studies and real-world implementations, such as the use of redundant sensors, data validation techniques, and secure communication protocols (Ramli & Jabbar, 2022). The authors also emphasized the importance of regular maintenance and calibration of sensors to ensure the accuracy and reliability of the collected data (Ramli & Jabbar, 2022).
Researchers have investigated the use of data compression, aggregation, and filtering techniques to reduce bandwidth requirements and improve transmission efficiency in automated irrigation systems (Karim et al., 2023; Rady et al., 2020; Cui, 2023). Karim et al. (2023) explored the effectiveness of various data compression techniques, such as lossless and lossy compression algorithms, in reducing the size of data packets transmitted over wireless networks. The authors found that lossless compression techniques, such as Huffman coding and Lempel-Ziv-Welch (LZW), can significantly reduce data size without compromising data quality, while lossy compression techniques, such as JPEG and MP3, can further reduce data size by introducing acceptable levels of distortion (Karim et al., 2023).
Rady et al. (2020) developed a novel data compression algorithm specifically designed for irrigation data, which achieved significant compression ratios without compromising data quality. The authors demonstrated that their algorithm could reduce the amount of data transmitted over wireless networks, thereby improving the efficiency of the irrigation system and reducing costs (Rady et al., 2020). Cui (2023) investigated the use of data aggregation and filtering techniques to reduce the number of transmissions and save bandwidth in automated irrigation systems. The author proposed a data aggregation scheme that combines multiple sensor readings into a single value, such as the average soil moisture over a specified time interval, to reduce the frequency of data transmissions (Cui, 2023). Additionally, the author explored the use of data filtering techniques, such as Kalman filters and particle filters, to remove noise and outliers from sensor data, improving the accuracy and reliability of the transmitted information (Cui, 2023).
Data standardization and harmonization are crucial for facilitating seamless integration and interoperability between the various components of automated irrigation management systems (Zhang et al., 2023; Ermoliev et al., 2022). Zhang et al. (2023) developed a novel cyberinformatics technology called iCrop, which enables the in-season monitoring of crop-specific land cover across the contiguous United States. The authors highlighted the importance of data standardization and harmonization in the context of iCrop, as it allows for the efficient distribution of crop-specific land cover information based on the findable, accessible, interoperable, and reusable (FAIR) data principle (Zhang et al., 2023). By adopting standardized data formats and protocols, such as the Open Geospatial Consortium (OGC) standards, iCrop enables the seamless integration of various data sources and facilitates the interoperability of the system with other agricultural decision support tools (Zhang et al., 2023).
Ermoliev et al. (2022) proposed a linkage methodology for linking distributed sectoral/regional optimization models in a situation where private information is not available or cannot be shared by modeling teams. The authors emphasized the need for data standardization to enable decentralized cross-sectoral coordination and analysis, as it allows for the consistent representation and exchange of data between different models and stakeholders (Ermoliev et al., 2022). By adopting standardized data formats and interfaces, the proposed linkage methodology can facilitate the integration of various optimization models and support the development of comprehensive decision support systems for sustainable resource management (Ermoliev et al., 2022).
Metadata plays a vital role in providing context and enabling better data interpretation and decision-making in automated irrigation management systems (Jahanddideh-Tehrani et al., 2021). Metadata refers to the additional information that describes the characteristics, quality, and context of the primary data, such as the sensor type, calibration parameters, measurement units, and timestamp (Jahanddideh-Tehrani et al., 2021). Jahanddideh-Tehrani et al. (2021) highlighted the importance of metadata in water resources management, as it enables decision-makers to use the data to the best of its capabilities by understanding factors such as when water data was collected and what factors might have contributed to the measurements. The authors emphasized the need for standardized metadata formats and guidelines, such as the Dublin Core Metadata Initiative (DCMI) and the ISO 19115 standard, to ensure the consistency and interoperability of metadata across different water information systems (Jahanddideh-Tehrani et al., 2021).
In the context of automated irrigation management systems, metadata can provide valuable information about the data collection process, sensor performance, and environmental conditions that can aid in data interpretation and decision-making (Cota & Mamede, 2023). For example, metadata about the sensor type and calibration parameters can help assess the accuracy and reliability of the collected data, while metadata about the weather conditions and soil properties can provide context for interpreting the data and adjusting irrigation strategies accordingly (Cota & Mamede, 2023). By incorporating metadata into the data management and analysis pipeline of automated irrigation systems, decision-makers can make more informed and context-aware decisions, leading to improved water use efficiency and crop productivity (Jahanddideh-Tehrani et al., 2021).

3.2. Edge Computing and Fog Computing
Edge computing and fog computing have emerged as transformative technologies in the realm of real-time irrigation management systems, offering significant potential for improving efficiency, scalability, and reliability (Abdel Nasser et al., 2020; Tran et al., 2019). Edge computing refers to the practice of processing data near the edge of the network, close to the source of the data, while fog computing is a decentralized computing infrastructure that extends cloud computing capabilities to the network edge (Hassija et al., 2019). These technologies bring computation and analytics closer to the data source, reducing the need for data to travel to the cloud and enabling faster processing and decision-making (Hassija et al., 2019; Zhang et al., 2020).
The potential of edge computing and fog computing in real-time irrigation management is immense. Abdel Nasser et al. (2020) proposed a two-layer system for water demand prediction using automated meters and machine learning techniques, demonstrating the potential of edge computing in improving the efficiency and scalability of irrigation management. The system collects and aggregates data from distributed smart meters in the first layer, while the second layer uses LSTM neural networks to predict water demand for different regions of households. By leveraging edge computing, the system can achieve high accuracy in predicting water demand, which is essential for efficient irrigation management (Abdel Nasser et al., 2020).
Tran et al. (2019) conducted a comprehensive review of real-time, end-to-end automated irrigation management systems, highlighting the role of fog computing in addressing data transmission challenges and enabling seamless integration across the irrigation management pipeline. The authors emphasize that real-time, end-to-end automated irrigation management systems have the potential to significantly improve water efficiency, crop yields, and reduce labor costs. However, they also identify several challenges that need to be addressed, such as data quality, scalability, reliability, and security, which can be effectively tackled by implementing fog computing architectures (Tran et al., 2019).
Edge computing offers several benefits in real-time irrigation management systems, including reduced latency, real-time decision-making, and reduced reliance on cloud connectivity (Mishra, 2020; Zhang et al., 2020). By processing data closer to the source, edge computing enables faster response times and more efficient data handling (Mishra, 2020). Mishra (2020) highlights that edge computing reduces latency by processing data closer to the source, enabling real-time decision-making and lessening reliance on cloud connectivity by shifting processing to local or edge devices.
Zhang et al. (2020) explore the application of edge computing in agricultural settings, demonstrating its potential to improve the efficiency and accuracy of irrigation systems. The authors discuss how edge computing has prospects in various agricultural applications, such as pest identification, safety traceability of agricultural products, unmanned agricultural machinery, agricultural technology promotion, and intelligent management. They also emphasize that the emergence of edge computing models, such as fog computing, cloudlet, and mobile edge computing, has transformed the management and operation of farms (Zhang et al., 2020).
Fog computing plays a crucial role in distributing processing and storage across the network, enhancing the scalability and reliability of automated irrigation systems (Premkumar & Sigappi, 2022; Singh et al., 2022). Premkumar and Sigappi (2022) evaluate the current state of automated irrigation management systems and propose a hybrid machine learning approach for predicting soil moisture and managing irrigation. Their study emphasizes the potential of fog computing in distributing processing and storage across the network, improving the efficiency and scalability of irrigation systems. The proposed hybrid machine learning approach outperforms other machine learning algorithms in predicting soil moisture, demonstrating the effectiveness of fog computing in enhancing the performance of automated irrigation systems (Premkumar & Sigappi, 2022).
Singh et al. (2022) discuss the role of fog computing in distributing processing and storage across the network, enhancing scalability and reliability in agricultural management systems. The authors argue that by implementing fog computing, these systems can achieve faster data processing and response times, improving overall efficiency and effectiveness. They also highlight that fog computing can address the challenges faced by real-time data transmission in agricultural management systems, such as latency, bandwidth limitations, and data security (Singh et al., 2022).
The integration of edge and fog computing in real-time irrigation management systems is crucial for achieving fully automated, scalable, and reliable solutions. As the demand for autonomous irrigation management grows, these technologies will play a pivotal role in enabling faster decision-making, reduced latency, improved resource utilization, and seamless integration across the irrigation management pipeline (Tran et al., 2019; Zhang et al., 2020). By bringing computation and analytics closer to the data source and distributing processing and storage across the network, edge and fog computing can significantly enhance the efficiency and effectiveness of automated irrigation systems, contributing to the overall goal of addressing the global food challenge through optimized water resource management and increased agricultural productivity (Abdel Nasser et al., 2020; Premkumar & Sigappi, 2022; Singh et al., 2022).

3.3. Automation of Data Collection
The automation of data collection is a critical component in the development of real-time, end-to-end automated irrigation management systems that integrate IoT and machine learning technologies. It enables the efficient gathering of vital information about crop health, environmental conditions, and water requirements, which is essential for enhancing agricultural water use efficiency and crop productivity. Two key aspects of automated data collection are the use of advanced sensing technologies for non-invasive plant stress detection and the implementation of wireless sensor networks and energy-efficient communication protocols for large-scale, long-term data collection.
Advanced sensing technologies, such as hyperspectral imaging and thermal sensing, have emerged as powerful tools for non-invasive plant stress detection in automated irrigation management systems. These technologies provide valuable information about crop traits, enabling early and accurate detection of plant health issues (Triantafyllou et al., 2019). Triantafyllou et al. (2019) propose a comprehensive reference architecture model that incorporates advanced sensing technologies in the sensor layer for real-time plant stress detection, highlighting their importance in providing non-invasive plant stress detection. Similarly, Hossain et al. (2023) present a novel IoT-ML-Blockchain integrated framework for smart agricultural management that leverages advanced sensing technologies to optimize water use and improve crop yield, contributing to the overall goal of enhancing agricultural water use efficiency and crop productivity.
Hyperspectral imaging can capture subtle changes in plant physiology that are indicative of stress, while machine learning algorithms can be employed to extract meaningful patterns from the spectral data and classify different stress types (Araus et al., 2014). Thermal sensing can detect changes in canopy temperature, which is influenced by factors such as plant water status (Li et al., 2019). By monitoring canopy temperature and comparing it to reference values, automated irrigation systems can detect plant water stress and trigger irrigation events to maintain optimal plant health and productivity (Li et al., 2019).
The integration of advanced sensing technologies in automated irrigation management systems has the potential to revolutionize precision agriculture. Jiang et al. (2019) demonstrate the effectiveness of a deep learning-based model in accurately detecting leaf spot diseases, highlighting the importance of image augmentation and deep learning algorithms in enhancing the model's performance.
Wireless sensor networks (WSNs) and energy-efficient communication protocols have the potential to significantly improve the efficiency and reliability of data collection in large-scale, long-term irrigation systems. WSNs offer a cost-effective and scalable solution for real-time data collection in large-scale irrigation systems, providing remote monitoring and automated control capabilities (Mehdizadeh et al., 2020). Nishiura and Yamamoto (2021) propose a novel sensor network system that utilizes drones and wireless power transfer to autonomously collect environmental data from sensor nodes in vast agricultural fields, reducing operational costs and enhancing the efficiency of data collection. Similarly, Higashiura and Yamamoto (2021) introduce a network system that employs UAVs and LoRa communication to efficiently collect environmental data from sensor nodes distributed across large farmlands, optimizing data collection and reducing travel distance and time.
Energy-efficient communication protocols are crucial for ensuring reliable data transmission in challenging environmental conditions and extending the lifespan of sensor nodes (Mehdizadeh et al., 2020). Al-Ali et al. (2023) investigate the potential of WSNs and energy-efficient communication protocols for data collection in large-scale, long-term irrigation systems, discussing the challenges and opportunities of using these technologies to improve the efficiency and reliability of real-time data collection in irrigation management. Mehdizadeh et al. (2020) emphasize the need for careful consideration of factors such as data accuracy, energy consumption, and network reliability when designing effective WSNs for irrigation management, enabling timely irrigation decisions and improved crop yields.
The automation of data collection through the use of advanced sensing technologies and wireless sensor networks is essential for achieving fully autonomous, scalable irrigation management. By enabling non-invasive plant stress detection and large-scale, long-term data collection, these technologies contribute to the overall goal of optimizing water resource management and increasing agricultural productivity. The integration of these technologies in real-time, end-to-end automated irrigation management systems has the potential to enhance agricultural water use efficiency and crop productivity, ultimately contributing to the development of fully autonomous, scalable irrigation management solutions.

3.4: Real-Time Data Transmission Protocols and Technologies
Real-time data transmission is a critical component of automated irrigation management systems, as it enables the timely delivery of sensor data to the cloud for processing and decision-making. The exploration of suitable protocols and network architectures is essential for ensuring efficient and reliable data transmission in these systems, contributing to the overall goal of enhancing agricultural water use efficiency and crop productivity.
The Message Queuing Telemetry Transport (MQTT) protocol has emerged as a popular choice for real-time data transmission in IoT networks, including those used for automated irrigation management. MQTT is a lightweight, publish-subscribe protocol designed for constrained devices and low-bandwidth networks (Author, 2019). Its simplicity and low overhead make it well-suited for IoT applications where data transmission speed and energy efficiency are critical (Saranyadevi et al., 2022). MQTT provides three Quality of Service (QoS) levels, ensuring data reliability in real-time scenarios (Author, 2019). Chen et al. (2020) proposed novel algorithms to improve data exchange efficiency and handle rerouting in MQTT-based IoT networks for automated irrigation management systems. Their TBRouting algorithm efficiently finds the shortest paths for data transmission, while the Rerouting algorithm effectively handles the rerouting of topic-based session flows when a broker crashes. The combination of these algorithms can significantly improve the performance and reliability of automated irrigation management systems (Chen et al., 2020).
Client-server IoT networks, such as those based on MQTT, play a crucial role in real-time data transmission for automated irrigation management systems. In these networks, sensors and devices (clients) publish data to a central broker (server), which then distributes the data to subscribed clients (Verma et al., 2021). This architecture enables efficient data collection, processing, and dissemination, facilitating the integration of various components within the automated irrigation management pipeline. Verma et al. (2021) proposed an architecture for healthcare monitoring systems using IoT and communication protocols, which provides a comprehensive overview of existing approaches and highlights challenges and opportunities in the field. Although focused on healthcare, the insights from this study can be applied to automated irrigation management systems, emphasizing the importance of interoperability and standardization for seamless integration (Verma et al., 2021).
In addition to MQTT, other application layer protocols such as XMPP, CoAP, SOAP, and HTTP have been explored for real-time data transmission in IoT networks. Each protocol has its strengths and weaknesses, making them suitable for different applications and scenarios. XMPP (Extensible Messaging and Presence Protocol) is an open-standard protocol that supports real-time messaging, presence, and request-response services (Saint-Andre, 2011). CoAP (Constrained Application Protocol) is a specialized web transfer protocol designed for use with constrained nodes and networks in the Internet of Things (Shelby et al., 2014). SOAP (Simple Object Access Protocol) is a protocol for exchanging structured information in the implementation of web services, while HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol) is the foundation of data communication for the World Wide Web (Fielding et al., 1999).
Motamedi and Villányi (2022) compared and evaluated wireless communication protocols for the implementation of smart irrigation systems in greenhouses, considering factors such as power consumption, range, reliability, and scalability. They found that ZigBee is the most suitable local communication protocol for greenhouse irrigation due to its large number of nodes and long range, while MQTT is the recommended messaging protocol for smart irrigation systems due to its TCP transport protocol and quality of service (QoS) options. GSM is a reliable and cost-effective global communication protocol for greenhouse irrigation, providing wide coverage and low cost (Motamedi & Villányi, 2022).
Syafarinda et al. (2018) investigated the use of the MQTT protocol in a precision agriculture system using a Wireless Sensor Network (WSN). They found that MQTT is suitable for use in IoT applications due to its lightweight, simple, and low bandwidth requirements. The average data transmission speed using the MQTT protocol was approximately 1 second, demonstrating its effectiveness for real-time data transmission in precision agriculture systems (Syafarinda et al., 2018).
The choice of application layer protocol for real-time irrigation management depends on factors such as data transmission speed, reliability, and energy efficiency. MQTT and RTPS (Real-Time Publish-Subscribe) are both suitable for real-time data transmission in IoT systems, but they have different strengths and weaknesses. MQTT is a better choice for applications that require low latency and high throughput, while RTPS is a better choice for applications that require high reliability and low latency (Sanchez-Iborra & Skarmeta, 2021). The exploration of MQTT and client-server IoT networks, along with the comparison of various application layer protocols, provides valuable insights into the suitability of these technologies for real-time data transmission in automated irrigation management systems.
In summary, real-time data transmission protocols and technologies play a vital role in the automation of irrigation management systems, enabling the efficient and reliable delivery of sensor data to the cloud for processing and decision-making. The exploration of MQTT and client-server IoT networks, along with the comparison of application layer protocols, highlights the importance of selecting suitable technologies based on factors such as data transmission speed, reliability, and energy efficiency. By leveraging these technologies, automated irrigation management systems can achieve seamless integration and contribute to the overall goal of enhancing agricultural water use efficiency and crop productivity.

3.5. Challenges and Solutions in Real-Time Data Transmission
Following the exploration of data collection, processing at the edge and fog, and automation in previous sections, we now turn to the critical aspect of real-time data transmission. While essential for automated irrigation management, this stage presents unique challenges that must be addressed to ensure system efficiency and reliability.
Obstacles in Real-Time Data Transmission
Agricultural environments present unique challenges for real-time data transmission, directly impacting the effectiveness of automated irrigation systems. Environmental factors can significantly disrupt wireless communication. Adverse weather conditions such as heavy rain, fog, and high winds can weaken or even block radio signals, leading to data loss and compromised system performance. Physical obstacles like trees, buildings, and uneven terrain further complicate signal propagation, creating reliability issues (Jukan et al., 2017; Yi & Ji, 2014; Zhang, Chang & Baoguo, 2018). These environmental challenges necessitate robust communication protocols and network architectures that can ensure consistent and reliable data flow.
In addition to environmental factors, technical limitations also present significant obstacles. Large-scale agricultural operations often demand long-distance data transmission, which can be hindered by the limited range of certain wireless communication protocols. Network congestion, occurring when multiple sensors transmit data concurrently, can lead to delays and potential data loss, further complicating real-time decision-making (Hameed et al., 2020). To mitigate these issues, researchers have investigated the potential of cognitive radio networks (CRNs) and dynamic spectrum access (DSA) for optimizing spectrum utilization and reducing interference (Righi et al., 2017; Shafi et al., 2018; Trigka & Dritsas, 2022). CRNs enable devices to intelligently sense and adapt to the surrounding radio environment, dynamically adjusting transmission parameters to avoid interference and improve communication efficiency. DSA, on the other hand, facilitates the dynamic allocation of unused spectrum, enhancing spectrum utilization and reducing congestion.
Furthermore, data security and privacy are paramount concerns in real-time irrigation systems. The sensitive nature of agricultural data, such as crop yields and farm management practices, necessitates robust security measures to prevent unauthorized access and data breaches (Gupta et al., 2020). Implementing secure communication protocols, authentication mechanisms, and encryption techniques is essential to protect data integrity and ensure the trustworthiness of the system.
Investigating Data Optimization Techniques
To enhance the efficiency and reliability of real-time data transmission in automated irrigation systems, researchers have explored a range of data optimization techniques. Data compression techniques aim to reduce the size of data packets transmitted over the network, minimizing bandwidth requirements and improving transmission speed (Rady et al., 2020; Karim et al., 2023). Lossless compression algorithms, such as Huffman coding and LZW, preserve data integrity while effectively reducing data size, ensuring that no information is lost during transmission (Cui, 2023). Lossy compression algorithms, such as JPEG and MP3, offer higher compression ratios but introduce a controlled level of data loss, which may be acceptable for certain applications where some loss of precision is tolerable (Karim et al., 2023). The choice between lossless and lossy compression depends on the specific application and the trade-off between data size and accuracy.
Data aggregation techniques provide another effective approach to optimize data transmission. By aggregating multiple sensor readings into a single representative value, such as average soil moisture or temperature, the number of transmissions can be significantly reduced, conserving bandwidth and energy resources (Cui, 2023). This is particularly beneficial in large-scale irrigation systems where numerous sensors are deployed across vast areas, generating substantial amounts of data. Additionally, data filtering techniques play a crucial role in improving data quality and reliability. Kalman filters and particle filters can effectively remove noise and outliers from sensor data, ensuring that only accurate and relevant information is transmitted and used for decision-making (Cui, 2023). This is essential for preventing erroneous data from influencing irrigation decisions and potentially leading to suboptimal water management.
Sensor calibration, drift correction, and fault detection are essential for maintaining data accuracy and reliability (Dos Santos et al., 2023). Regular calibration ensures that sensors provide accurate measurements over time, while drift correction techniques account for gradual changes in sensor readings due to environmental factors or aging. Fault detection mechanisms can identify and address sensor malfunctions or anomalies, preventing erroneous data from influencing irrigation decisions and potentially harming crops or wasting water.
Addressing the Challenges
Effectively addressing the challenges in real-time data transmission requires a multifaceted approach that encompasses environmental, technical, and data-related considerations. Implementing robust and adaptive communication protocols is crucial for overcoming interference and signal degradation caused by weather conditions and physical obstacles. Selecting appropriate protocols, such as LoRa or ZigBee, with suitable range and penetration capabilities can ensure reliable data transmission in challenging agricultural environments (Motamedi & Villányi, 2022). Additionally, employing techniques like frequency hopping and error correction codes can further improve communication resilience and mitigate data loss.
Optimizing network architecture is another key consideration. Deploying a distributed network architecture with edge and fog computing capabilities can significantly enhance data processing and transmission efficiency (Abdel Nasser et al., 2020; Tran et al., 2019). Edge devices can perform initial data processing and aggregation tasks, reducing the amount of data transmitted to the cloud and minimizing latency, while fog nodes can provide additional processing power and storage closer to the data source, enhancing scalability and reliability. This distributed approach alleviates the burden on the central cloud server and allows for more responsive and efficient irrigation management.
Data optimization techniques play a vital role in reducing bandwidth requirements and improving transmission efficiency. The choice of data compression, aggregation, and filtering techniques should be tailored to the specific requirements of the irrigation system, considering factors such as data type, accuracy needs, and available bandwidth. By carefully selecting and implementing these techniques, the overall performance and effectiveness of real-time irrigation systems can be significantly enhanced, leading to more sustainable water management practices and improved agricultural productivity.
By addressing these challenges and implementing appropriate solutions, real-time data transmission can become a reliable and efficient component of automated irrigation systems, contributing to the overall goal of achieving sustainable and productive agriculture in the face of growing food demands and water scarcity.

3.6. IoT Network Architectures and Variable Rate Irrigation (VRI) for Real-Time Irrigation
Real-time irrigation management systems heavily rely on the efficient and reliable transmission of data from sensors and weather stations to the cloud for processing and decision-making. However, agricultural environments present unique challenges to wireless communication, including adverse weather conditions, physical obstacles, and the limitations of wireless technologies. These challenges necessitate robust and adaptive solutions to ensure the consistent and timely flow of data, enabling truly autonomous irrigation scheduling.
Environmental factors, such as heavy rain, fog, and strong winds, can significantly disrupt wireless communication by attenuating or even blocking radio signals, leading to data loss and compromised system performance (Ed-daoudi et al., 2023; Jukan et al., 2017; Yi & Ji, 2014; Zhang, Chang & Baoguo, 2018). Dense vegetation, buildings, and uneven terrain create further complications by causing multipath propagation and shadowing effects (Yim et al., 2018; Gautam and Pagay, 2020). The study by Yim et al. (2018) on LoRa networks in a tree farm environment exemplifies these challenges, revealing reduced communication range and data reliability compared to theoretical expectations. This underscores the need for carefully selecting and optimizing communication protocols and network parameters to ensure reliable data transmission in such environments.
The study by Guzinski et al. (2014a) using a modified TSEB model further highlights the importance of high-resolution data in accurately capturing the spatial and temporal dynamics of energy fluxes influenced by environmental factors. This emphasizes the need for advanced data acquisition and processing techniques that can effectively represent the complexities of agricultural settings.
The limitations of traditional wireless communication technologies, such as limited range and network congestion, pose additional challenges for large-scale agricultural operations. Long-distance data transmission can be hindered by range limitations, while network congestion arising from numerous sensors transmitting concurrently can lead to delays and data loss, hindering real-time decision-making (Hameed et al., 2020). Addressing these challenges requires the exploration of advanced networking technologies that can optimize spectrum utilization, mitigate interference, and improve reliability and efficiency.
Cognitive Radio Networks (CRNs) and Dynamic Spectrum Access (DSA) offer promising solutions for optimizing wireless communication in agricultural settings. CRNs empower devices with the ability to intelligently sense and adapt to the surrounding radio environment, dynamically adjusting transmission parameters to avoid interference and improve communication efficiency (Righi et al., 2017; Shafi et al., 2018; Trigka & Dritsas, 2022). Research has explored the potential of CRNs in predicting Radio Frequency (RF) power to avoid noisy channels and optimize spectrum utilization (Iliya et al., 2014; Iliya et al., 2014). These studies demonstrate the effectiveness of combining optimization algorithms with artificial neural networks (ANNs) to enhance the accuracy and generalization of RF power prediction, enabling CRNs to make informed decisions about channel selection and avoid interference.
DSA complements CRN technology by dynamically allocating unused spectrum, further enhancing spectrum utilization and reducing congestion (Shi et al., 2023). The numerical model developed by Shi et al. (2023) showcases the potential of CRNs and DSA for optimizing wireless communication in challenging environments.
The integration of CRNs and DSA into the IoT network architecture requires careful consideration of spectrum sensing techniques, network topology, and data security. Research on cooperative spectrum sensing suggests that distributed approaches, where sensor nodes collaborate and share information, can significantly improve the accuracy and efficiency of spectrum sensing, particularly in dynamic environments (Trigka and Dritsas, 2022; Khalid & Yu, 2019). This collaborative approach enables a more comprehensive understanding of the radio environment and facilitates the identification of available frequency bands for data transmission.
The choice of network topology also impacts the performance and scalability of CRN-based irrigation systems. Mesh networks, where sensor nodes are interconnected and relay data for each other, offer enhanced resilience and coverage compared to star topologies where nodes communicate directly with a central gateway (Akyildiz & Vuran, 2010). However, mesh networks can be more complex to manage and may introduce additional routing overhead. The trade-off between network resilience and complexity needs to be carefully evaluated to select the most appropriate topology for a specific agricultural setting.
Data security and privacy are paramount concerns in IoT-based irrigation systems due to the sensitive nature of agricultural data (Gupta et al., 2020). Implementing secure communication protocols, authentication mechanisms, and encryption techniques is essential for protecting data integrity and ensuring system trustworthiness. Research on secure spectrum leasing and resource allocation algorithms for CR-WSN-based irrigation systems has demonstrated the potential of these technologies for enhancing security and efficiency (Hassan, 2023; Afghah et al., 2018).
In conclusion, the development of effective and reliable real-time irrigation management systems requires a comprehensive approach that addresses the challenges of data transmission in agricultural environments. The integration of robust and adaptive communication protocols, optimized network architectures, and advanced networking technologies like CRNs and DSA, along with a focus on data security and privacy, can contribute significantly to achieving the goal of autonomous and efficient irrigation scheduling.
4. AUTOMATED DATA PROCESSING IN THE CLOUD
4.1. Data Quality and Preprocessing
Data quality is paramount in automated irrigation systems as it directly influences the effectiveness of decision-making and water use efficiency. Issues like missing values, inconsistencies, and outliers arising from sensor malfunctions, environmental interference, or network problems (Lv et al., 2023) can significantly impact the performance of machine learning models used for irrigation scheduling and management.
Real-time data cleaning techniques are essential for addressing these challenges. Kalman filtering proves particularly effective in handling missing values and correcting erroneous readings by recursively estimating the system's state based on previous measurements and current sensor data, taking into account noise and uncertainty (Kim et al., 2020). Moving average techniques, by averaging consecutive data points, provide a more stable representation of the underlying trend, filtering out short-term fluctuations (Chhetri, 2023). For outlier detection, adaptive thresholding methods offer a dynamic approach, adjusting thresholds based on the statistical properties of the data to effectively identify anomalies and minimize false positives (Bah et al., 2021). These techniques are crucial in maintaining the integrity of real-time data streams and ensuring the accuracy of subsequent analyses.
Adaptive data preprocessing is essential for managing the diversity of data sources and formats commonly found in irrigation systems. Data normalization techniques, such as min-max scaling or z-score normalization, ensure that all features contribute equally to the analysis by transforming data values to a common scale (Pradal et al., 2016). This is crucial for preventing features with larger values from dominating the analysis and ensuring that all features are given equal consideration. Similarly, feature scaling methods, like standardization or normalization, optimize the range of feature values to improve the performance and convergence of machine learning models (Tortorici et al., 2024). By scaling features to a similar range, the influence of outliers is reduced, and the model's ability to learn from the data is enhanced.
Data fusion techniques play a critical role in integrating information from diverse sources, creating a more comprehensive and reliable dataset for irrigation management. Dempster-Shafer theory, a generalization of probability theory, allows for the expression of both uncertainty and the degree of conflict in evidence, making it suitable for fusing uncertain and conflicting data from heterogeneous sources (Sadiq and Rodriguez, 2004). This is particularly relevant in irrigation systems where data from different sensors may provide slightly different or even contradictory information due to sensor variations or environmental factors. Bayesian inference offers another powerful framework for combining information from multiple sources, updating the probability of a hypothesis as new evidence becomes available. By applying these techniques, data from soil moisture sensors, canopy temperature sensors, weather stations, and other sources can be integrated to provide a holistic understanding of crop water requirements and environmental conditions, leading to more informed and accurate irrigation decisions.
The impact of data quality extends beyond model accuracy to the robustness of machine learning models under varying conditions. Robust models should maintain consistent performance even when faced with data inconsistencies or unexpected situations. Techniques like data augmentation and domain adaptation can enhance model robustness by exposing the model to a wider range of data variations during training. Data augmentation involves generating additional training data by applying transformations or introducing noise to existing data, making the model more resilient to noise and variations in the real-world data. Domain adaptation techniques aim to adapt a model trained on one domain (e.g., a specific crop or geographic location) to perform well on another domain with different data characteristics. This is particularly relevant in irrigation management, where models may need to be applied to different crops, soil types, or climatic conditions.
The choice of data cleaning, preprocessing, and fusion techniques should be carefully considered based on the specific characteristics of the irrigation system and the available data. By selecting and implementing appropriate techniques, the accuracy, reliability, and robustness of machine learning models can be significantly improved, leading to more efficient and sustainable irrigation management practices.
4.2. Scalable and Autonomous Deployment using Containerization Strategies
The transition from data collection and transmission to efficient data processing requires a robust infrastructure capable of handling diverse workloads and data volumes. Containerization technologies, specifically Docker and Kubernetes, offer a promising solution for deploying and scaling data processing and machine learning modules within cloud environments like AWS, Azure, and GCP (Vargas-Rojas et al., 2024; Rosendo et al., 2022; Solayman & Qasha, 2023). Docker provides a standardized way to package applications and their dependencies into self-contained units known as containers, ensuring consistent and reproducible execution across different platforms (Rosendo et al., 2022). Kubernetes, acting as a container orchestrator, manages their deployment, scaling, and networking across a cluster of machines (Rosendo et al., 2022). This combination presents several advantages for automated irrigation management systems.
Firstly, containerization facilitates efficient resource utilization and scalability. By encapsulating applications and their dependencies, containers enable the isolation of resources and prevent conflicts between different modules (Vargas-Rojas et al., 2024; Solayman & Qasha, 2023). This isolation allows for the efficient allocation of resources, such as CPU, memory, and storage, to each container based on its specific needs. Kubernetes further enhances scalability by allowing for the automatic scaling of containers based on real-time demand, ensuring the system can adapt to varying workloads and data volumes, preventing bottlenecks, and ensuring responsiveness to changing conditions (Karamolegkos et al., 2023).
Secondly, containerization promotes portability and reproducibility. By packaging applications and their dependencies into a single unit, containers make it easy to move and deploy them across different cloud environments without the need for environment-specific configurations (Rosendo et al., 2022; Solayman & Qasha, 2023). This portability simplifies the development and deployment process, reducing the time and effort required to set up and manage the system. Additionally, containers ensure reproducibility by providing a consistent execution environment, regardless of the underlying infrastructure. This eliminates variability and ensures that the system will behave consistently across different deployments (Zhou et al., 2023).
Optimizing container orchestration and resource allocation is crucial to minimizing latency and maximizing throughput in real-time data processing pipelines. Techniques like auto-scaling and dynamic resource allocation play a critical role in this context (Hethcoat et al., 2024; Werner and Tai, 2023; Kumar et al., 2024). Auto-scaling automatically adjusts the number of container instances based on real-time demand, ensuring that sufficient resources are available to handle peak workloads while avoiding over-provisioning during periods of low demand (Hethcoat et al., 2024; Kumar et al., 2024). Dynamic resource allocation enables the fine-grained adjustment of resources allocated to each container based on its specific needs and the current workload (Werner and Tai, 2023). This ensures efficient resource allocation and provides each container with the necessary resources to perform its tasks effectively.
Performance monitoring tools, such as Kubernetes Metrics Server and Prometheus, are essential for gaining insights into the performance of containers and the overall system (Hethcoat et al., 2024; Kuity & Peddoju, 2023). These tools provide valuable data on key performance indicators, such as CPU and memory usage, network traffic, and application-specific metrics. By monitoring this data, administrators can identify bottlenecks, optimize resource allocation strategies, and continuously improve system performance (Hethcoat et al., 2024). This data-driven approach ensures that automated irrigation management systems can operate efficiently and reliably.
By integrating containerization technologies with optimization techniques and performance monitoring, automated irrigation management systems achieve the scalability, autonomy, and efficiency required for effective real-time data processing and decision-making. This approach facilitates a seamless and responsive system that can adapt to changing conditions and contribute to the overall goal of optimizing water resource management and increasing agricultural productivity.

4.3. Deploying ML Models for Data Processing
Transitioning from data collection, preprocessing, and transmission, the deployment of machine learning (ML) models marks a pivotal stage in the automated irrigation management pipeline. This stage entails utilizing cloud platforms to facilitate real-time data processing and inference, enabling data-driven decision-making for optimal irrigation management and ultimately contributing to fully autonomous, scalable irrigation management.
Several architectures and frameworks exist for deploying ML models on cloud platforms, each offering unique advantages and catering to different requirements. TensorFlow Serving, for instance, provides a high-performance system specifically designed for serving TensorFlow models (Abadi et al., 2016). This framework enables efficient and scalable inference, making it suitable for real-time applications where low latency and high throughput are crucial. For instance, in a large-scale irrigation system with numerous sensors generating data continuously, TensorFlow Serving can efficiently handle the high volume of inference requests and provide timely predictions for irrigation scheduling. Similarly, Apache MXNet Model Server offers a flexible and efficient solution for deploying models trained with MXNet, supporting a wide range of deep learning models and inference backends (MXNet Developers, 2015). This versatility makes it suitable for complex irrigation systems that may utilize different types of ML models for various tasks, such as predicting crop water requirements, detecting plant stress, or forecasting weather conditions. ONNX Runtime, on the other hand, provides a cross-platform inference engine compatible with various ML frameworks, including PyTorch, TensorFlow, and MXNet (Microsoft, 2017). This versatility enables the deployment of models in diverse environments, facilitating interoperability and reducing the need for model conversion. For example, an irrigation system that uses models trained in different frameworks can utilize ONNX Runtime to deploy them on a single platform without the need for time-consuming and error-prone model conversion processes.
Choosing the appropriate architecture or framework depends on several factors, including the specific ML framework used for model training, the desired level of performance and scalability, and the need for cross-platform compatibility. For instance, if the primary concern is low latency and high throughput for real-time inference, TensorFlow Serving might be the optimal choice for TensorFlow models. However, if flexibility and support for various deep learning models are required, Apache MXNet Model Server could be more suitable. In cases where cross-platform compatibility is essential, ONNX Runtime offers a versatile solution.
Once the ML model is deployed, optimizing its performance and resource utilization becomes crucial for ensuring the efficiency of integrated end-to-end automated irrigation systems. Model compression techniques, such as pruning and quantization, offer effective methods for reducing the size and computational requirements of ML models without compromising accuracy (Premkumar & Sigappi, 2022). Pruning involves eliminating unnecessary connections or neurons from the model, effectively streamlining its structure and reducing computational complexity. This can be particularly beneficial for deep learning models, which often have a large number of parameters and can be prone to overfitting. By removing redundant or less important connections, pruning can improve modelgeneralizability and reduce inference time. Quantization, on the other hand, involves reducing the precision of model parameters, typically from 32-bit floating-point numbers to lower-precision formats such as 8-bit integers. This reduction in precision leads to smaller model sizes and faster inference speeds, making it particularly beneficial for resource-constrained environments or real-time applications. For instance, in edge computing scenarios where ML models are deployed on devices with limited computational resources, quantization can enable efficient inference without sacrificing accuracy.
Furthermore, hardware acceleration through the utilization of GPUs or TPUs can significantly enhance model performance by leveraging specialized hardware designed for parallel processing (Premkumar & Sigappi, 2022). GPUs, with their massive parallelism and high memory bandwidth, excel at accelerating matrix operations and convolutions, which are fundamental computations in many deep learning models. This acceleration can significantly reduce inference time and enable real-time processing of sensor data for timely irrigation decisions. TPUs, specifically designed for deep learning workloads, offer even greater performance and energy efficiency for specific model architectures. These hardware accelerators can drastically reduce inference time, enabling near real-time decision-making and enhancing the responsiveness of automated irrigation systems. For example, in a scenario where immediate response to changing weather conditions or soil moisture levels is critical, hardware acceleration can ensure that irrigation decisions are made and executed promptly.
In addition to model compression and hardware acceleration, distributed training techniques play a crucial role in optimizing the training process for large-scale ML models. Techniques such as Horovod and BytePS enable the distribution of training across multiple machines, effectively parallelizing the process and reducing training time (Premkumar & Sigappi, 2022). This is particularly beneficial for complex models with a large number of parameters or when dealing with large datasets. By leveraging distributed training, irrigation management systems can train more sophisticated models and improve their predictive capabilities, leading to more accurate and efficient irrigation decisions. For instance, a system that utilizes a deep learning model with millions of parameters can benefit from distributed training to reduce training time from days to hours, enabling faster model iteration and improvement.
Integrating the deployed ML models with other components of the automated irrigation management pipeline is essential for achieving a fully autonomous and cohesive system and addressing the need for seamless integration across the automated irrigation management system. Standardized protocols, such as MQTT and CoAP, provide lightweight and efficient communication channels for exchanging data between these components (Poojara et al., 2023; Jimenez et al., 2020a; Gour et al., 2023). MQTT, with its publish-subscribe architecture, enables real-time data streaming and event-driven communication, making it suitable for transmitting sensor data, control signals, and inference results (Raikar & M, 2023). This enables the ML model to receive real-time updates on soil moisture, weather conditions, and plant health, allowing for dynamic adjustments to irrigation schedules based on the latest data. CoAP, designed for constrained devices and low-power networks, offers a web-transfer protocol for resource-constrained environments, enabling efficient communication between sensors, actuators, and the ML models (Raikar & M, 2023). This is particularly relevant in situations where sensors or actuators have limited processing power or battery life, as CoAP minimizes communication overhead and energy consumption. Additionally, RESTful APIs provide a standardized interface for accessing and controlling the ML models, enabling seamless integration with other software components and facilitating system management and monitoring (Wang et al., 2022). This allows for easy integration with existing farm management systems or third-party applications, creating a unified platform for comprehensive irrigation management.4.4. Online Learning in the Cloud
The complexities of real-time data processing in irrigation management necessitate the exploration of advanced techniques to continuously learn and adapt to the dynamic nature of agricultural environments. Online learning algorithms offer a promising solution, enabling the continuous update and improvement of machine learning models based on incoming real-time data. This adaptability is crucial for addressing the challenges of changing environmental conditions, such as weather patterns and crop growth stages, and optimizing irrigation decision-making to enhance water usage efficiency and crop productivity.
Several online learning algorithms have demonstrated potential for real-time data processing and model adaptation in the context of irrigation management. Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) facilitates the incremental update of model parameters with each new data point, allowing for efficient adaptation to changing data distributions (Bottou, 2010). This incremental learning process ensures that the model remains responsive to the latest conditions, minimizing the risk of outdated predictions and improving the accuracy of irrigation decisions. Passive-Aggressive algorithms, on the other hand, adjust model parameters only when a misclassification occurs, providing a computationally efficient approach for handling large data streams (Crammer et al., 2006). These algorithms offer a robust approach to handling noisy data, a common challenge in real-world sensor readings, by making small adjustments only when the model's prediction deviates significantly from the actual value (Fei et al., 2019). Online Random Forests extend the concept of random forests to the online setting, enabling the incremental construction and update of decision trees as new data arrives (Saffari et al., 2009). The continuous evolution of the ensemble ensures that the model remains relevant to the changing environment, capturing intricate relationships between variables and leading to more informed irrigation decisions.
Research in various domains highlights the importance of online learning for real-time data stream analytics. Snyder et al. (2020) explored the application of online learning techniques for identifying relevant tweets in real-time, improving situational awareness for first responders. The proposed interactive learning framework allows users to continuously label the relevance of incoming tweets, enabling the real-time refinement of the underlying machine learning model. This user-guided approach aligns well with the dynamic nature of irrigation management, where models need to continuously adjust to varying environmental conditions and crop water requirements. Similarly, research in the field of cyber-physical systems (CPS) underscores the need for online learning algorithms to effectively extract insights and knowledge from continuously generated data streams (Fei et al., 2019). These capabilities are crucial for enabling feedback loops between physical processes and cyber elements, facilitating the integration and optimization of CPS in irrigation management systems.
To implement online learning in cloud-based irrigation management systems, various architectures and frameworks can be considered. Apache Spark Streaming, Apache Flink, and AWS Kinesis provide scalable and fault-tolerant platforms for processing real-time data streams, allowing for the development of online learning pipelines that continuously ingest and analyze data to update machine learning models (Zaharia et al., 2012; Carbone et al., 2015; Amazon Web Services, 2023). These frameworks leverage serverless computing paradigms, automatically scaling resources based on the volume and velocity of incoming data, ensuring efficient resource utilization and responsiveness to fluctuations in demand (Fei et al., 2019).
Effectively managing the exploration-exploitation trade-off is crucial for optimizing online learning in irrigation management. Techniques such as Multi-armed bandits (Sutton & Barto, 2018), Bayesian optimization (Shahriari et al., 2016), and Reinforcement Learning (RL) (Sutton & Barto, 2018) can be employed to balance the allocation of resources between exploring new irrigation strategies and exploiting the current best-performing approaches. These techniques enable the identification of optimal irrigation policies, adapting to changing environmental conditions and maximizing long-term rewards.
In conclusion, online learning techniques, coupled with scalable cloud-based architectures, offer a powerful solution for real-time data processing and continuous adaptation in irrigation management systems. By leveraging algorithms like SGD, Passive-Aggressive, and Online Random Forests, along with stream processing frameworks like Apache Spark Streaming, Apache Flink, and AWS Kinesis, irrigation management systems can effectively handle the complexities of real-time data, optimize water usage, and enhance crop productivity in the face of dynamic environmental conditions.

    Access Comment(s) Under a Creative Commons License Abstract: With the escalating
    global challenges of food security and resource sustainability, innovative solutions
    like deep learning and computer vision are transforming agricultural practices
    by enabling data-driven decision-making. This paper provides a focused review
    of recent advancements in deep learning-assisted computer vision techniques tailored
    specifically for greenhouse environments. First, deep learning and computer vision
    fundamentals are briefly introduced. Over 100 studies from 2020 to date are then
    comprehensively reviewed in which these technologies were applied within greenhouses
    for growth monitoring, disease detection, yield estimation, and other tasks. The
    techniques, datasets, models, and overall performance results reported in the
    literature are analyzed. Tables and figures showcase real-world implementations
    and results synthesized from current research. Key challenges are also outlined
    related to aspects like model adaptability, lack of sufficient labeled greenhouse
    data, computational constraints, the need for multi-modal sensor fusion, and other
    areas needing further investigation. Future trends and prospects are discussed
    to provide guidance for researchers exploring computer vision in the niche greenhouse
    domain. By condensing prior work and elucidating the state-of-the-art, this timely
    review aims to promote continued progress in smart greenhouse agriculture. The
    focused analysis, specifically on greenhouse environments, fills a gap compared
    to previous agricultural surveys. Overall, this paper highlights the immense potential
    of computer vision and deep learning in driving the emergence of data-driven,

    of escalating global challenges such as population growth, climate change, and
    urbanization, the call to reimagine our agricultural and horticultural systems
    becomes more critical than ever. The shadow of these issues hovers ominously over
    future food security, intertwined with the sustainable usage of our dwindling
    natural resources [1]. Yet, in this realm of concerns, a beacon of promise emerges
    from technological advancements, holding the potential to revolutionize the agricultural
    and horticultural landscapes [2]. Our pursuit, therefore, centers on the strategic
    leverage of these cutting-edge technologies to create more sustainable, productive,
    and resilient farming ecosystems worldwide. Sustainable access to high-quality
    food is not just a predicament for developing countries; even developed nations
    are grappling with this issue. Current agricultural practices, conducted predominantly
    in open fields, are not sufficiently productive to meet the escalating demand.
    As the World Health Organization projects, food production will need to increase
    by 70% by 2050 to meet the needs of an estimated global population of 10 billion
    [3], about 7 billion of whom will be living in urban areas [4]. Thus, exploring
    alternative production systems becomes not just an option but a necessity to ensure
    a sustainable food supply chain.'
  key_findings: "1. Deep learning techniques have shown promising results for computer\
    \ vision tasks in greenhouse environments, including crop monitoring, disease\
    \ detection, yield estimation, and quality analysis. \n2. Several challenges remain,\
    \ including the lack of large-scale standardized datasets, the need for specialized\
    \ and optimized models for greenhouse conditions, computational constraints, and\
    \ limited integration of diverse sensing modalities."
  limitations: '1. Limited focus on economic sustainability of greenhouse farming.

  explanation: 'The study conducted a comparative life cycle assessment (LCA) to evaluate
    the environmental impacts of a conventional five-year crop rotation system, without
    and with implementation of precision agriculture technologies (PATs), for crop
    production in Austria. The research compared the following PATs: automatic steering,

    using remote sensors. The comparison aimed to determine the effectiveness of the
    technologies in reducing environmental impacts resulting from agricultural practices
    and identify areas for further refinement of LCA methodology in this domain.


    The research found that implementing PATs can have a positive impact on the environment
    by reducing the use of agricultural inputs (such as fertilizers and pesticides)
    and, therefore, reducing greenhouse gas emissions, energy consumption, and pollution.
    The study also highlighted areas of the LCA methodology that could be improved

- explanation: This study focuses on a specific use case of applying machine learning
    (ML) to optimize the allocation of resources in a network of Internet of Things
    (IoT) devices used in smart agriculture. The network consists of IoT devices that
    collect data from a smart farm and transmit it through aerial drones to a local
    server. Virtual Network Functions (VNFs) must be executed sequentially on the
    raw packets, which represent split functionalities of a single processing job.
    Furthermore, certain VNFs, such as compression, may potentially alter packet sizes.
    The challenge involves determining the optimal placement and scheduling of VNFs
    on processing nodes (UAVs and the local server), accounting for processing time,
    transmission delay, and power consumption (both transmit and processing power)
    in a distributed manner.

  explanation: The Soil Profile Optimizer (SPO), developed by Memic et al. (2021),
    is a software plug-in for DSSAT that enables the optimization of selected soil
    profile parameters through inverse modeling. This study demonstrated the application
    of SPO for site-specific crop modeling by calibrating three soil profile parameters
    (SLLL, SLRO, and SRGF) to simulate grain weight in a 3-year maize field trial.
    The model performance using optimized soil profiles led to an R2 of 0.76, an EF
    of 0.75, and a mean RMSE of 600 kg ha-1, indicating a substantial improvement
    over simulations conducted with field-scale soil characterization (R2 = 0.03,
    EF = -0.13, RMSE = 1800 kg ha-1). The study highlights the potential of the SPO
    in improving the accuracy of crop simulations in site-specific management applications.

    impact of optimizing additional soil profile parameters or the effect of using
    different optimization algorithms. The study did not evaluate the transferability
    of the optimized soil profile parameters to other sites or years.
  main_objective: To demonstrate the application of the Soil Profile Optimizer (SPO)
    for site-specific crop modeling by calibrating selected soil profile parameters
    to simulate grain weight in a 3-year maize field trial.
  relevance_evaluation: The paper's relevance to the specific point you are making
    in your literature review is high. The paper provides a detailed description of
    a new software tool, the Soil Profile Optimizer (SPO), which can be used to optimize
    soil profile parameters for site-specific crop modeling. This tool has the potential
    to improve the accuracy of crop simulations in site-specific management applications.
    This is because the SPO can be used to calibrate soil profile parameters to match
    observed yield data, which can lead to more accurate simulations of crop growth
    and yield. The paper also provides a case study demonstrating the application
    of the SPO for site-specific crop modeling in a 3-year maize field trial. The
    results of the case study show that the SPO can significantly improve the accuracy
    of crop simulations, as indicated by an increase in R2 from 0.03 to 0.76 and a
    decrease in RMSE from 1800 kg ha-1 to 600 kg ha-1. Overall, the paper provides
    strong evidence to support the claim that the SPO can be used to improve the accuracy
    of crop simulations in site-specific management applications.

    Water sustainability will be scarce in the coming decades because of global warming,
    an alarming situation for irrigation systems. The key requirement for crop production
    is water, and it also needs to fulfill the requirements of the ever-increasing
    population around the globe. The changing climate significantly impacts agriculture
    production due to the extreme weather conditions that prevail in various regions.
    Since urbanization is increasing worldwide, smart cities must find innovative
    ways to grow food sustainably within built environments. This paper explores how
    precision agriculture powered by artificial intelligence (AI) can transform crop
    farms (CF) to enhance food security, nutrition, and environmental sustainability.
    We developed a robotic CF prototype that uses deep reinforcement learning to optimize
    seeding, watering, and crop maintenance in response to real-time sensor data.
    The system was tested in a simulated CF setting and benchmarked. The results revealed

    Background on Precision Agriculture Precision agriculture has become an important
    strategy for the sustainable feeding of growing urban populations. However, efficiently
    cultivating food within space-constrained city environments requires innovative
    techniques to optimize limited land and resources. Precision agriculture, which
    utilizes data and technology to target interventions, shows promise if adapted
    for urban farming contexts. As urban spaces continue to expand, the integration
    of precision farming has emerged as a pioneering approach, representing a significant
    departure from traditional agricultural practices to more specialized, data-guided
    strategies. The main aim of precision farming within an urban context is to refine
    plot-level management concerning plant health and production efficiency. This
    is achieved through state-of-the-art technologies like satellite imaging, sensor
    technology, Global Positioning Systems (GPS), and data analytics, which help to
    monitor and regulate urban green spaces and crops more efficiently for the betterment
    of public health. Historically, decisions on irrigation, seed sowing times, and
    the quantity of fertilizer used in traditional farming were primarily based on
    human intuition and previous records. On the other hand, urban precision farming
    leverages real-time data to foster better decision making. This leads to enhanced
    productivity, improved sustainability, and reduced costs by applying the right
    treatments at the right time and place. To deepen our understanding of these novel
    practices, Table 1 comprehensively compares various agricultural methods, briefly
    summarizing the benefits and drawbacks of each technique. This valuable decision-making
    tool helps identify potential research areas for autonomous farm robots, especially
    within urban landscapes. Table 1. Comparison of different methods in agriculture.
    1.2. Need for Sustainable Farming Practices The need for food is anticipated to
    increase significantly as the world population approaches 10 billion by 2050.
    This creates considerable hurdles for the agricultural industry, which is already
    under pressure from causes like climate change, water scarcity, and land degradation.
    Furthermore, conventional agricultural methods have frequently been linked to
    harmful environmental effects such as soil erosion, excessive water use, and pollution
    from pesticides and fertilizers. Figure 1 shows the evolution of agricultural
    machinery over time. Figure 1. Evolution of agricultural machinery. Therefore,
    addressing these issues requires the use of sustainable farming techniques. Sustainable
    agriculture aims to enhance food production without sacrificing the ability of
    future generations to meet their own needs. It encompasses a broad spectrum of
    ethical, socially responsible, and commercially successful actions. For instance,
    they reduce water waste through wise irrigation techniques while minimizing pollution
    through specific fertilizers and pesticides. 1.3. Introduction to Deep Reinforcement
    Learning (DRL) A sophisticated machine learning method, DRL, combines deep learning
    and reinforcement learning. Reinforcement learning is concerned with how agents
    should behave in an environment to maximize cumulative rewards, whereas deep learning
    is designed to handle high-dimensional data. In DRL, an agent gains decision-making
    skills through interaction with its surroundings. In contrast to supervised learning,
    where the model is trained on a dataset with labelled examples, an agent learns
    via feedback based on its behaviors in reinforcement learning. As it interacts
    with the environment, the agent gains rewards, and it aspires to increase the
    total of these rewards over time. Deep learning’s function is to make approximations
    of the mathematical formulae that calculate potential rewards or recommend the
    optimal course of action. DRL has succeeded in several fields, including autonomous
    driving, robotic control, and superhuman video game skill. DRL is exceptionally
    well suited to dynamic and unpredictable contexts like agriculture because of
    its capacity to manage complicated, high-dimensional environments. The main objective
    of this research is to investigate how Deep Reinforcement Learning may be incorporated
    into autonomous agricultural robots for adaptive seeding and water management.
    Our goal is to create a system that can make wise judgments in real time based
    on environmental variables by fusing precision agricultural concepts with the
    cutting-edge capabilities of DRL. This study focuses on implementing the Proximal
    Policy Optimization (PPO) algorithm, a cutting-edge DRL method renowned for its
    sample efficiency and simplicity, in an autonomous agricultural robot outfitted
    with multiple sensors. The PPO algorithm uses these sensors’ vital information
    to decide upon the seed sowing depth, density, and irrigation schedules. This
    research lays the framework for a new generation of intelligent agricultural systems
    that can help address today’s food issues while advancing efficiency and sustainability
    in farming methods. Precision agriculture can be advanced by incorporating DRL
    into autonomous robots, making farms more productive and resistant to the difficulties
    presented by a changing global climate. The structure of this study begins with
    an introduction, moves through a literature review, a description of the Proximal
    Policy Optimization algorithm, a description of the robot design, an experimental
    setup, a performance evaluation, and ends with conclusions and recommendations.
    2. Literature Review Autonomous agricultural robot development began in the late
    20th century. According to [1,2,3], early agricultural robots mainly concentrated
    on straightforward tasks like weeding. Agricultural robots started employing increasingly
    advanced technologies, such as GPS, computer vision, and sensor technology, as
    technology advanced. There was a rush of research on the automation of harvesting
    procedures in the early 2000s. These studies developed robotics for the fresh
    fruit industry to automate fruit harvesting [4,5]. Agricultural robots have become
    more versatile over time as robotics and artificial intelligence (AI) have advanced.
    The necessity of giving agricultural robots various sensors and decision-making
    abilities was emphasized by [3]. More recently, in 2017, Duckett et al. introduced
    the idea of “Agricultural Robotics for the Real World”, examining various applications
    and the possible use of robotics in agriculture. Most traditional seed-sowing
    techniques involve physical work. Initially, it was common to scatter seeds by
    hand; later, row-sowing equipment like seed drills were created [4]. Decisions
    about the seed sowing depth and density were frequently based on experience and
    were, therefore, imprecise. Farming has always depended heavily on effective water
    management. When fields were flooded by water in the past, flood irrigation was
    frequently practiced [5]. This approach could be more effective. Technology led
    to the creation of sprinkler and drip irrigation systems. Although these techniques
    required manual intervention and decision-making, they were more effective. The
    ability of DRL to make decisions in complicated contexts has lately led to its
    use in agriculture. Refs. [6,7,8,9,10] explored deep learning’s multiple agricultural
    applications, such as in crop and weed detection. DRL was used by [7] to optimize
    irrigation scheduling. They created a DRL agent that considers the trade-off between
    crop productivity and water usage when learning how to irrigate an agricultural
    field. Similarly, ref. [8] suggested a DRL-based precision irrigation system,
    demonstrating significant water savings while preserving crop output. A DRL-based
    telepresence robot with the ability to maneuver around was discussed in detail
    in [9,10,11,12]. Table 2 shows the comparison of different published works related
    to smart and sustainable farming with the usage of different technologies, and
    the advantages and disadvantages of those technologies. Table 2. Comparison of
    different published works in the related field. Despite improvements in DRL and
    agricultural robotics, they have not yet been integrated for adaptive seed planting
    and water management. The majority of DRL implementations have concentrated on
    discrete activities like scheduling irrigation. Most of the potential of DRL in
    adaptive seed sowing, where the robot chooses the sowing depth and density in
    real time based on environmental circumstances, has yet to be thoroughly investigated.
    Additionally, there is a requirement for more complete systems that integrate
    different components like seeding, water management, and fertilizer management
    into a single autonomous robotic system. Through DRL, such systems can be equipped
    to make integrated decisions while concurrently considering several elements [18,19,20,21,22,23,24].
    The need for the real-world testing and validation of these systems is another
    flaw. Although numerous studies include simulated environments, there are fewer
    cases of substantial real-world deployments, which is essential for comprehending
    real-world difficulties and limitations. Furthermore, creating algorithms that
    can effectively function with little data is required. The majority of DRL algorithms
    require data that may need to be more practical in some agricultural contexts,
    particularly in underdeveloped countries where data are scarce. It is also important
    to consider the practicality and scalability of agricultural robots built using
    DRL technology. Large-scale deployments need to be explored to comprehend these
    systems’ economic effects and scalability across many types of crops and diverse
    geographical regions. Even if the development of autonomous agricultural robots
    and the use of DRL in agriculture have advanced significantly, there is still
    a need to bridge the gap between these two by creating integrated systems. This
    integration should concentrate on real-world applicability, scalability, economic
    viability, and technological improvement. By creating an autonomous agricultural
    robot that uses DRL for adaptive seed sowing and water management, and deploying
    and evaluating the system in a real-world environment on a 1-acre test farm, our
    project intends to fill some of these gaps. Through this, we intend to open the
    door for further study and advancements in intelligent and sustainable precision
    agriculture. 3. Deep Reinforcement Learning 3.1. Overview of Deep Reinforcement
    Learning A branch of machine learning known as DRL combines deep learning and
    reinforcement learning (RL). The core tenet of RL is that agents operate in ways
    that maximize some sort of concept of cumulative reward. DRL develops this concept
    by approximating the functions required for difficult decision making using a
    neural network, as shown in Figure 2. Figure 2. DRL architecture and process.
    A set of states 𝑆 , a set of actions 𝐴 , and a policy, which is a mapping from
    states to actions, make up the basic context for RL: 𝜋: 𝑆 → 𝐴 . The agent interacts
    with environmental interaction by observing a state 𝑠 ∈ 𝑆 , acting 𝑎 ∈ 𝐴 , obtaining
    a reward r, and then changing to a new state 𝑠 ′ . Finding a policy that maximizes
    the predicted cumulative reward is the objective. The Q-function, which is designated
    as 𝑄(𝑠, 𝑎) and calculates the predicted cumulative reward of acting in state s
    and then following policy, is an essential part of RL. DRL uses deep neural networks
    to approximate the Q-function. Mathematically, the Q-function is defined by the
    Bellman equation in Equation (1): 𝑄(𝑠, 𝑎)=𝑟+𝛾𝑚𝑎𝑥(𝑄( 𝑠 ′ ,  𝑎 ′ )) (1) where 0
    ≤ 𝛾 ≤ 1 is the discount factor. Here, 𝑚𝑎𝑥(𝑄( 𝑠 ′ ,  𝑎 ′ )) represents the maximum
    predicted reward that can be achieved from the next state 𝑠 ′ , considering all
    possible actions 𝑎 ′ in that state. This term is a key component of the Bellman
    equation used in reinforcement learning, specifically in the context of Q-learning.
    It encapsulates the idea of an agent (in this case, the agricultural robot) learning
    to predict the total amount of reward it can expect in the future, given its current
    state and action. In order to approximate the Q-function, 𝑄(𝑠, 𝑎; 𝜃) , DRL uses
    a neural network, which stands for the weights of the network. 𝑄(𝑠, 𝑎; 𝜃) is a
    function approximated by a neural network, where 𝜃 represents the network’s weights,
    that is used to predict the expected rewards for taking action 𝑎 in state 𝑠 ,
    guiding the decision-making process of the agent. 3.2. Proximal Policy Optimization
    (PPO) Algorithm A policy optimization technique in DRL called Proximal Policy
    Optimization (PPO) aims to update the policy without making significant changes.
    Compared to other policy optimization techniques, it is distinguished as being
    more stable and effective with regard to sample complexity, as shown in Figure
    3. PPO works in two stages: Figure 3. PPO working principle. First, by interacting
    with the environment while employing the present policy, data are gathered. Second,
    the policy is optimized by maximizing an objective function. With each update,
    the policy can vary excessively, hindering learning. The PPO algorithm explicitly
    solves this problem. This is accomplished by optimizing a surrogate objective-containing
    modification of the policy gradient objective function, as shown in Equation (2):
    𝐿(𝜃)=𝑚𝑖𝑛(𝑟(𝜃) 𝐴 𝑎𝑑𝑣 , 𝑐𝑙𝑖𝑝(𝑟(𝜃),1−𝜀,1+𝜀)  𝐴 𝑎𝑑𝑣 ) (2) Here, 𝐴 𝑎𝑑𝑣 is the advantage
    function evaluating how good the action is compared to the average action; this
    function evaluates how much better an action is compared to the average action
    under the current policy. The advantage function is crucial in reinforcement learning
    as it helps to determine the relative quality of the actions taken by the agent.
    𝜀 is a hyperparameter controlling how much the policy is permitted to change.
    𝑟(𝜃) is the ratio of the probability of the action under the new and old policies.
    When incorporated into autonomous agricultural robots for adaptive seed planting
    and water management, PPO has various benefits in agricultural contexts. Sample
    Effectiveness: PPO is renowned for its sample effectiveness. Being able to make
    sense of few data is essential in agriculture because of the short growing season.
    Stability: By preventing the policy from shifting too much, the clipping in the
    objective function promotes more stable learning. This translates into long-term
    decision making that is trustworthy and consistent in the context of agriculture.
    Handling Continuous Action Spaces: Making decisions in agriculture, such as how
    much water to use for irrigation or how deep to plant seeds, must be performed
    continuously. PPO is well suited to making these kinds of decisions since it performs
    well in continuous action spaces. Real-time Decision Making: PPO’s effectiveness
    and stability make it capable of making judgments in real time, which is essential
    for adaptive water management and seed sowing, where conditions might change quickly
    due to the weather or other factors. Mathematically, these advantages can be crucial
    for optimizing the yield 𝑌 , given by Equation (3): 𝑌=𝑓(𝑋, 𝑊,𝑑, 𝑃) (3) Where 𝑋
    represents the seed sowing density, 𝑊 is the amount of water utilized, 𝑑 is the
    sowing depth, and P is the policy (in this instance, PPO optimization). The objective
    is to maximize 𝑌 while considering the agricultural environment’s limitations
    and unique characteristics. PPO is particularly favourable for adaptive seed sowing
    and water management in agriculture; this is because it can integrate autonomous
    agricultural robots due to its sample efficiency, stability, competence in handling
    continuous action spaces, and real-time decision making. These benefits help to
    optimize important agricultural variables, resulting in higher yields and more
    environmentally friendly farming methods. 4. Autonomous Agricultural Robot 4.1.
    Robot Design and Components In this study, DRL is used in the multidimensional
    design of an autonomous agricultural robot focused on adaptive seed sowing and
    water management. Our robot, Agrorobotix, includes an intelligent decision-making
    system, a reliable mechanical structure, and sensor integration, as shown in Figure
    4. Figure 4. Agrorobotix structure. The mechanical setup of Agrorobotix consists
    of a chassis, four wheels, four motors, a mechanism for drilling holes in the
    ground, a seed dropper, a flattener, and a watering system. The robot’s chassis,
    which serves as its main body, is strong enough to support its parts while it
    moves around an agricultural field. It houses the sensors, control unit, motors,
    battery, and other components required for autonomous operation. The robot has
    four wheels, each propelled by a different engine, as shown in Figure 5. This
    enhances the control of the movement, including rotation and navigating various
    terrains. A mathematical model of the motors is as follows, as described in Equation
    (4): 𝑇=𝑘(𝑉−𝑤𝑅) (4) Figure 5. Agrorobotix mechanism and working. 𝑘 is the motor
    constant, 𝑉 is the applied voltage, 𝑤 is the angular velocity, 𝑅 is the resistance,
    and 𝑇 is the torque. A motorized arm and a drill make up the drilling mechanism.
    The component can move vertically, enabling it to drill holes in the ground at
    different depths based on the information provided by the sensors. Let us use
    𝑑 as the drilling depth, 𝑇 𝑑 for the torque needed for drilling, and 𝑃 𝑑 for the
    power required for drilling. They have a relationship that can be modelled as
    shown in Equations (5) and (6): 𝑇 𝑑 =𝐹𝑟 (5) 𝑃 𝑑 = 𝑇 𝑑 𝑑𝜔 (6) where 𝐹 is the applied
    force, and 𝑟 is the drill’s radius and 𝜔 is the angular velocity. The next step
    is attaching a seed dropper to the drilling mechanism. The seeds are carefully
    dropped into the drilled holes. The seed dropper system is set up to distribute
    seeds according to the DRL system’s predetermined intervals and dosages. The flattener,
    a component with a flat surface placed over the soil to ensure the seeds are adequately
    coated, performs this. Finally, the robot has a sprinkler system. The ideal amount
    of water will be provided over the sown area. The water flow rate 𝑄 can be computed
    as shown in Equation (7): 𝑄= 𝐴 𝑐𝑠 𝑣 (7) where 𝐴 𝑐𝑠 is the cross-sectional area
    of the flow and 𝑣 is the velocity of water. 4.2. Power Management To ensure that
    the Agrorobotix robot always has enough power to return to its base for recharging
    or maintenance, several strategies can be implemented as part of its energy management
    system. Here are some approaches used by Agrorobotix: Energy Monitoring System:
    Implement a real-time energy monitoring system that continuously tracks the robot’s
    power levels. This system alerts the robot when its energy levels drop below a
    predefined threshold, prompting it to return to the base for recharging. 2. Automated
    Recharging Stations: Set up automated recharging stations strategically in the
    field. The robot can autonomously dock and recharge when needed, minimizing downtime,
    and ensuring constant operational readiness. 3. Battery Health Management: Implement
    a battery health management system that monitors the battery condition, optimizes
    charging cycles, and prevents deep discharges, thereby extending the battery life
    and reliability. 4.3. Sensor Integration 4.3.1. Soil Moisture Sensors Agrorobotix
    incorporates soil moisture sensors to gauge the water in the soil. These are essential
    in letting the DRL system know if watering is required. The estimates for soil
    moisture are as described in Equation (8): 𝜃 𝑠𝑜𝑖𝑙 = ( 𝑚 𝑤𝑒𝑡 − 𝑚 𝑑𝑟𝑦 ) 𝑚 𝑑𝑟𝑦 (8)
    where 𝑚 𝑤𝑒𝑡   is the mass of the wet soil and 𝑚 𝑑𝑟𝑦 is the mass of dry soil. 4.3.2.
    Weather Sensors Weather sensors are crucial for detecting environmental factors
    like temperature, humidity, and rainfall. Making judgments on irrigation timing
    and the sowing depth require the use of this information. 4.3.3. Global Positioning
    System (GPS) The robot has a GPS module that enables precise field navigation.
    This is essential to ensuring that the robot follows the best courses for irrigation
    and sowing. The tuple (latitude, longitude) can indicate the robot’s position
    𝑃 . The DRL system continuously receives data from various sensors and uses the
    PPO algorithm to make real-time decisions about the seed sowing depth, density,
    and irrigation. In this study, Agrorobotix, an autonomous agricultural robot using
    the newest sensors and Deep Reinforcement Learning technology, is painstakingly
    designed. Its sturdy construction and thoughtful decision-making capabilities
    enable adaptive seeding and water management, which promote more effective and
    sustainable agriculture methods. Agrorobotix’s advanced decision-making capabilities
    and structural robustness have received particular attention during development,
    as these are essential for adaptive seeding and water management. A key component
    of these capabilities is the integration of GPS technology. Thanks to this technology,
    Agrorobotix can move and position itself in the best possible ways to accomplish
    its tasks while accurately navigating a variety of agricultural landscapes. Because
    GPS enables accurate data collection and the execution of learned strategies in
    real-time field conditions, it is essential for the effective implementation of
    deep reinforcement learning algorithms. As a result, the system’s robust design,
    astute decision making, and accurate GPS-guided navigation work together to greatly
    improve agricultural practices’ sustainability and efficiency. 4.4. Integration
    of PPO in the Robot A key feature of Agrorobotix is the PPO algorithm, which enables
    the robot to make wise and adaptable decisions for seed sowing and water management
    in real time. The integration establishes the connection between the robot’s mechanical
    parts, the PPO algorithm, and its sensory inputs. 4.4.1. Data Acquisition and
    Preprocessing Data serve as the foundation for PPO. Agrorobotix has several sensors,
    including GPS, weather sensors, and soil moisture sensors. Let us denote the raw
    sensory data at time 𝑡 as 𝑆 𝑡 . These data need to be pre-processed to create
    the state space that will be used as input by the PPO algorithm. The state space,
    denoted as 𝑋 𝑡 , can be represented as a vector in Equation (9): 𝑋 𝑡 =[ 𝑠 𝑚𝑡 ,
    𝑠 𝑤𝑡 ,  𝑝 𝑡 ] (9) where 𝑠 𝑚𝑡 represents the soil moisture, 𝑠 𝑤𝑡 represents weather
    information (such as temperature, humidity), and 𝑝 𝑡 represents the robot’s position,
    obtained from GPS data. 4.4.2. Action Execution and Feedback The robot’s components
    are actuated per the action 𝐴 𝑡 selected by the PPO algorithm. For example, if
    𝐴 𝑡 calls for sowing seeds at depth 𝑑 , the drilling machine would be activated
    to produce the holes at depth 𝑑 , the seed dropper would dispense the seeds, the
    flattener would cover the holes, and the sprinkler might be activated depending
    on the moisture levels. Let us denote the action space as 𝐴 𝑡 =[𝑑, 𝑛, 𝑤] , where
    𝑑 represents the depth of seed sowing, 𝑛 represents the number of seeds, and 𝑤
    represents the amount of water to be sprinkled. 4.4.3. Reward Calculation and
    Policy Update After executing the action, Agrorobotix observes the immediate reward
    𝑅 𝑡 , which is a function of various factors such as the soil moisture, weather
    conditions, and seed sowing depth. The cumulative reward 𝐺 𝑡 is calculated as
    in Equation (10): 𝐺 𝑡 =𝛴 (𝛾^𝑖 ∗  𝑅 𝑡+𝑖 ) (10) where 0 ≤ 𝛾 ≤ 1 is the discount
    factor. The policy is updated using the collected rewards, and the process is
    repeated. Real-time Adaptation Agrorobotix gathers new data as it continues interacting
    with the environment, which are then used to update the policy. As a result, the
    PPO algorithm improves its decision making over time by adjusting to the surroundings.
    4.4.4. Mathematical Optimization for Resource Consumption A secondary objective
    can be integrated into PPO to ensure minimal resource consumption. The robot can
    be optimized for the minimal use of water and energy. Minimize in Equation (11):
    𝛴( 𝑤  𝑡 + 𝑒 𝑡 ) (11) Subject to Equation (12): 𝐺 𝑡 ≥𝑡ℎ𝑟𝑒𝑠ℎ𝑜𝑙𝑑 (12) where 𝑤  𝑡
    is water consumption, and 𝑒 𝑡 is the energy consumption at time 𝑡 . In the context
    of Agrorobotix’s operations, the reward function 𝑅 𝑡 plays a pivotal role in guiding
    the robot’s learning and decision-making process. After executing an action 𝐴
    𝑡 , such as sowing seeds or managing water, Agrorobotix calculates the immediate
    reward 𝑅 𝑡 . This reward is a multi-faceted function that incorporates several
    critical agricultural factors, including, but not limited to, the following: Soil
    Moisture: Agrorobotix measures the moisture level of the soil, aiming for an optimal
    range that ensures adequate water for the crops without over-irrigation. The closer
    the soil moisture is to this optimal range, the higher the reward 𝑅 𝑡   received.
    Weather Conditions: The algorithm considers current and forecasted weather conditions.
    Favourable weather that promotes healthy crop growth contributes positively to
    the reward. Seed Sowing Depth: The accuracy of the seed sowing depth, as per the
    agronomic standards for different crops, influences 𝑅 𝑡 . A precise sowing depth
    ensures better seed germination and contributes to a higher reward. The cumulative
    reward 𝐺 𝑡  is then calculated based on these immediate rewards over time, as
    outlined in Equation (10). This approach enables Agrorobotix to adapt its actions
    dynamically, aiming to maximize 𝐺 𝑡  by optimizing these key factors, thus ensuring
    efficient and sustainable agricultural practices. In general terms, processing
    sensory data to create a state space, using the PPO algorithm to choose actions,
    carrying out these actions using the robot’s mechanical parts, and changing the
    policy using the incentives earned are the steps involved in incorporating PPO
    into Agrorobotix. This makes it possible for Agrorobotix to modify its water management
    and seed-sowing plans in real time, resulting in higher yields and sustainability.
    The pseudocode algorithm of PPO is described in Algorithm 1. Algorithm 1: Proximal

    is initialized to adjust the policy parameters during training. In each iteration,
    the robot observes the state 𝑠 t from its sensors (soil moisture, weather sensors,
    GPS). The action 𝑎 t is selected based on the policy 𝜋( 𝑎 t | 𝑠 𝑡 ; 𝜃) and executed
    by the robot (drilling, sowing, flattening, and watering). The robot observes
    the immediate reward 𝑟 t and the new state 𝑠 t+1 . The advantage estimate 𝐴 t
    is computed, which represents how good the taken action is compared to the average
    action. The policy parameters 𝜃 are updated by optimizing the surrogate objective,
    which is a clipped version of the objective; this is to prevent policy updates
    that are too large. This process is repeated over multiple iterations and epochs
    for stable learning. 5. Experimental Setup 5.1. Description of the Test Farm The
    experimental setup was carried out on a test farm spanning an area of 1 acre,
    as shown in Figure 6. The farm is in a region of Faisalabad, Pakistan, with a
    temperate climate that is characterized by moderate rainfall and a growing season
    typically from early spring to late fall. The soil is loamy and has been traditionally
    used for growing a variety of crops including wheat, maize, and vegetables. The
    test farm was specifically chosen for its representativeness of typical agricultural
    conditions. The field experiments with Agrorobotix spanned over a period of 30
    days, enabling comprehensive data collection and algorithm refinement. Figure
    6. The 1-acre test farm. 5.2. Data Collection and Training Historical information
    about the farm, such as its weather patterns (temperature, humidity, and precipitation),
    soil moisture, and crop yield records, was gathered before the experiment began.
    Agrorobotix uses an array of sensors to gather these data, which form the basis
    of the algorithm’s decision-making process. Our autonomous agricultural robot,
    Agrorobotix, collected data in real time throughout the trial using its built-in
    sensors. Gazebo was used in the simulation environment to replicate the conditions
    on a farm. A high-fidelity model of Agrorobotix and the test farm were used in
    the simulation. The various environmental situations could be replicated using
    Gazebo, and the robot’s behaviours could be examined. Through a continuous feedback
    loop, the robot adapts its actions based on the outcomes of previous actions,
    enhancing its efficiency and accuracy over time. The collected data were pre-processed
    to be fed into the DRL model. The state space vector 𝑋 t is defined as described
    in Equation (13): 𝑋 t =[ 𝑠 𝑚𝑡 , 𝑠 𝑤𝑡 ,  𝑝 𝑡 ] (13) where 𝑠 𝑚𝑡 represents the soil
    moisture, 𝑠 𝑤𝑡 represents weather information, and 𝑝 𝑡 represents the robot’s
    position, which was obtained from GPS data. The PPO algorithm was employed as
    the DRL model, which was trained using both historical data and real-time data
    collected from Gazebo simulations. The objective was to maximize the cumulative
    reward 𝐺 𝑡 . The learning curves for these tasks are given in Figure 7. During
    training, we simulated an Agrorobotix in parallel for each sampling and collected,
    in total, a thousand time steps for each task. The policy 𝜋(𝜃) was modified iteratively
    through epochs, and the training continued until convergence. Figure 7. Learning
    curve of PPP for Agrorobotix. Following training, Agrorobotix was used on the
    test farm’s 1-acre property. Its primary responsibilities included water management
    and adaptive seed sowing. As instructed by the PPO algorithm, the robot used its
    drilling machine to create holes, seed droppers, flatteners to level the field,
    and sprinklers to water the crops. It was crucial to adjust the model with actual-world
    data while Agrorobotix moved through the test farm. The robot functioned at the
    test farm throughout two growing seasons and continuously adjusted its irrigation
    and seeding policies. The model tuned itself to the test farm’s actual environmental
    conditions and limits, as shown in Figure 8. Figure 8. Agrorobotix working in
    1-acre test farm. The crop yield and water use were the two main criteria for
    assessing Agrorobotix’s performance. Water use was calculated in liters, while
    crop production and the shoot length in particular were calculated in centimeters.
    The crop production and water usage of Agrorobotix were compared to traditional
    farming methods to examine the results. The effectiveness and advantages of using
    a Deep Reinforcement Learning-based strategy in agriculture were established through
    this comparison. PPO’s integration into Agrorobotix and implementation on the
    test farm produced positive outcomes. The robot could manage water resources and
    plant seeds flexibly and efficiently. The experimental set-up that combined physical
    and virtual settings greatly honed and tested Agrorobotix’s performance in actual
    agricultural situations. The use of autonomous robots and deep reinforcement learning
    offers a significant step towards sustainable and effective farming practices.
    6. Results and Discussion In this study, the ‘conventional’ method refers to traditional
    agricultural practices, which typically include manual labor and basic mechanization
    without advanced automation or data-driven decision-making systems. This method
    has been optimized based on standard agricultural practices, which involve routine
    watering and fertilization schedules, regular pest control measures, and traditional
    soil management techniques. These practices serve as a benchmark for comparing
    the efficiency and effectiveness of the Agrorobotix system in enhancing sustainable
    agriculture. 6.1. Comparison with Conventional Farming Techniques 6.1.1. Crop
    Yield One of the essential metrics in this study is the crop yield, which directly
    impacts the efficiency and sustainability of agricultural practices. The crop
    yield was quantified as the total shoot length of crops produced per unit seed,
    as shown in Figure 9. Let us denote the crop yield using Agrorobotix as 𝑌 𝑟 and
    the crop yield using conventional farming techniques as 𝑌 𝑐 , as shown in Equation
    (14). 𝑌 𝑟 =𝑇𝑜𝑡𝑎𝑙 𝑙𝑒𝑛𝑔𝑡ℎ 𝑜𝑓 𝑐𝑟𝑜𝑝𝑠 𝑝𝑟𝑜𝑑𝑢𝑐𝑒𝑑 𝑝𝑒𝑟 𝑢𝑛𝑖𝑡 𝑠𝑒𝑒𝑑 𝑏𝑦 𝐴𝑔𝑟𝑜𝑟𝑜𝑏𝑜𝑡𝑖𝑥 (𝑐𝑚/𝑠𝑒𝑒𝑑)  𝑌

    (14) Figure 9. Shoot length in (a) 0 month, (b) 1st month, (c) 2nd month and (d)
    3rd month. According to the results, there was a 16.3% increase in shoot length
    with the use of Agrorobotix, as shown in Equation (15): ( 𝑌 𝑟 − 𝑌 𝑐 .)/ 𝑌 𝑐 .
    ∗ 100=16.3% (15) This can also be visualized through the graph in Figure 10: Figure
    10. Shoot length comparison of Agrorobotix and conventional method. 6.1.2. Water
    Usage Another critical metric is the water usage, which is crucial for sustainable
    agriculture. Let us denote the water usage using Agrorobotix as 𝑊 𝑟 and the water
    usage using conventional farming techniques as 𝑊 𝑐 , as shown in Equation (16):
    𝑊 𝑟 =𝑇𝑜𝑡𝑎𝑙 𝑤𝑎𝑡𝑒𝑟 𝑐𝑜𝑛𝑠𝑢𝑚𝑒𝑑 𝑝𝑒𝑟 𝑢𝑛𝑖𝑡 𝑎𝑟𝑒𝑎 𝑏𝑦 𝐴𝑔𝑟𝑜𝑟𝑜𝑏𝑜𝑡𝑖𝑥 (𝑙𝑖𝑡𝑒𝑟𝑠/𝑎𝑐𝑟𝑒)  𝑊 𝑐 =𝑇𝑜𝑡𝑎𝑙
    𝑤𝑎𝑡𝑒𝑟 𝑐𝑜𝑛𝑠𝑢𝑚𝑒𝑑 𝑝𝑒𝑟 𝑢𝑛𝑖𝑡 𝑎𝑟𝑒𝑎 𝑏𝑦 𝑐𝑜𝑛𝑣𝑒𝑛𝑡𝑖𝑜𝑛𝑎𝑙 𝑓𝑎𝑟𝑚𝑖𝑛𝑔 (𝑙𝑖𝑡𝑒𝑟𝑠/𝑎𝑐𝑟𝑒) (16) According
    to the results, there was a 21.7% reduction in water usage with the use of Agrorobotix,
    as described in Equation (17): ( 𝑊 𝑐 − 𝑊 𝑟 )/ 𝑊 𝑐  ∗ 100=21.7% (17) This can also
    be visualized through the bar graph in Figure 11: Figure 11. Comparison of water
    usage when using Agrorobotix and conventional method. 6.2. Insights and Implications
    The results demonstrate that Deep Reinforcement Learning increases crop productivity
    while reducing water use in an autonomous agricultural robot. The graphs and mathematical
    model show that Agrorobotix performs better than conventional agricultural methods.
    The DRL model’s reward improvement demonstrates how the robot can grow intelligent
    and acquire sound judgement. Adaptation is crucial in agriculture since environmental
    conditions can be unpredictable. During field trials, a number of operational
    parameters were evaluated in order to determine the usefulness and effectiveness
    of Agrorobotix in agricultural settings. These parameters include the average
    speed at which the robot operates and the total amount of time needed to finish
    typical agricultural tasks on a field of one acre. Agrorobotix was entrusted with
    a number of standard farming tasks during these trials, including planting, watering,
    and crop health monitoring. The mean velocity of the robot was measured, taking
    into account different kinds of terrain and operational circumstances. Agrorobotix’s
    operational performance across a range of agricultural tasks is summarised in
    Figure 12. The robot’s average speed, which ranges from 3 to 4 km/h, is shown
    on the left for tasks like watering, seeding, and crop monitoring. These velocities
    are designed to strike a balance between effectiveness and the dexterity needed
    for fine farming tasks. Agrorobotix’s time efficiency is demonstrated by the graph
    on the right, which shows how long it takes to finish each task on a one-acre
    field. The durations, which vary from 5 to 7 h, demonstrate the robot’s ability
    to complete tasks quickly, possibly lowering labour hours and increasing the overall
    productivity of the farm. This information highlights how Agrorobotix is used
    in the field in a way that is consistent with sustainable farming methods and
    precision agriculture. Figure 12. Agrorobotix: speed and time metrics for farming
    tasks on a 1-acre field. Figure 13 illustrates a comparison between the chemical
    usage of traditional farming methods and those employed with Agrorobotix. The
    bar chart clearly shows a 33% reduction in chemical usage when utilizing Agrorobotix’s
    precision application system, as indicated by the decrease from 100% (representing
    the baseline chemical usage in traditional methods) to 67%. This significant reduction
    underscores the benefits of efficiency and sustainability offered by Agrorobotix
    in agricultural practices. Figure 13. Chemical usage comparison: traditional vs.
    Agrorobotix. A comparative study was conducted to validate the algorithm’s soil
    moisture estimation against traditional methods. This involved performing parallel
    measurements over the experimental period, demonstrating the algorithm’s precision.
    The graph in Figure 14 compares the soil moisture estimation over a 30-day period
    using the Deep Learning Reinforcement (DLR) algorithm implemented in Agrorobotix
    with traditional methods. The blue line represents the soil moisture levels as
    estimated by the DLR algorithm, while the green line illustrates the estimates
    obtained through traditional methods. This visual representation offers a clear
    comparison of the two approaches, demonstrating the DLR algorithm’s ability to
    accurately estimate soil moisture over an extended period, which is crucial for
    informed and efficient agricultural practices. Figure 14. Soil moisture estimation:
    DRL algorithm vs. traditional methods (30 days). The results of this study indicate
    that autonomous robots may revolutionise agricultural practices. Such robots can
    tackle some of agriculture’s most serious issues, such as resource optimisation
    and sustainability, by making data-driven decisions. Additionally, as technology
    advances, the capabilities and application of these robots may be enhanced, ushering
    in a new era of precise and sustainable agriculture. The findings of this study
    serve as a basis for further investigation and development in the fields of agricultural
    robotics and artificial intelligence. 7. Conclusions In conclusion, this research
    article shows that implementing new sustainable irrigation methods improves crop
    farming and reduces water consumption. The potential of Agrorobotix to transform
    urban agriculture is demonstrated by its integration into smart city frameworks.
    Agrorobotix makes a substantial contribution to the sustainability and efficiency
    of urban farming practices, which are essential to the creation of smart cities,
    by utilizing cutting-edge AI and robotics. By maximizing the utilization of resources
    to minimize environmental effects and improve food security in urban areas, this
    system is in line with the smart city objective; as a result, the Agrorobotix
    system has shown that integrating deep reinforcement learning into autonomous
    agricultural robots provides significant advantages for adaptive seed sowing and
    water management. The Agrorobotix design prioritizes water sustainability, but
    it also makes a major contribution to effective land management and the optimization
    of fertilizer usage. Agrorobotix guarantees sustainable resource utilization beyond
    water conservation by carefully dousing fertilizers and monitoring soil health.
    The outcomes of considerable experimentation and comparison with traditional farming
    methods reveal significant benefits. Crop yield rose by an average of 16.3%, outpacing
    conventional techniques and boosting food production. Additionally, the Agrorobotix
    system’s deployment led to a stunning 21.7% decrease in water usage, successfully
    addressing the significant problem of resource conservation. These figures highlight
    the enormous potential for enhancing agricultural practices using deep reinforcement
    learning algorithms, particularly the Proximal Policy Optimization algorithm.
    The Agrorobotix system provides a sustainable and effective solution for modern
    agriculture, opening the way for higher production and environmental stewardship
    by intelligently optimizing seed sowing and water management procedures. This
    study also qualitatively assessed the broader implications of AI-enabled precision
    farming. Interviews with the farmers and stakeholders were conducted, which revealed
    the benefits of the proposed approach. Acknowledging Agrorobotix’s limitations,
    like terrain navigation difficulties and maintenance needs, we plan to explore
    these areas in future work to enhance the practical applicability and operational
    efficiency of agricultural robotics. The multidimensional impacts of precision
    crop farming beyond its measurable outcomes emphasize its potential to foster
    social cohesion and well-being in urban communities. Author Contributions Conceptualization,

    and Opportunities with Recent Advancements Chapter © 2021 Impact of Internet of
    Things in Agriculture Chapter © 2022 1 Introduction Agriculture has long been
    the cornerstone of human civilization, providing sustenance, livelihoods, and
    economic prosperity to communities around the world. However, the global agricultural
    landscape is rapidly evolving, presenting both unprecedented challenges and exciting
    opportunities. As the world''s population continues to surge towards an estimated
    9.7 billion by 2050, the demand for food, fiber, and bioenergy is intensifying
    [1, 2]. This surge in demand, coupled with the increasingly volatile climate and
    resource constraints, necessitates a profound transformation in how we practice
    agriculture. The answer to this challenge lies in the convergence of cutting-edge
    technologies, notably Artificial Intelligence (AI) and the Internet of Things
    (IoT), which collectively form the bedrock of what is now known as “Smart Agriculture”
    or “Precision Agriculture” [3,4,5,6,7,8]. Smart Agriculture represents a paradigm
    shift from traditional farming methods to a data-driven, interconnected, and intelligent
    approach to cultivation. It harnesses the power of AI, data analytics, automation,
    and IoT to optimize agricultural processes, conserve resources, enhance crop yields,
    and mitigate environmental impacts [8,9,10,11,12]. This chapter embarks on a journey
    into the realm of AI and smart technologies within the context of agriculture.
    It explores how these technologies are reshaping the agricultural landscape, from
    the vast fields of staple crops to the intricate networks of urban vertical farms.
    It examines the key applications of AI and smart technologies in precision farming,
    highlights real-world case studies of their implementation, and considers the
    implications for farmers, consumers, and the environment. In an age where information
    is a critical resource, the fusion of AI and agriculture represents a pivotal
    moment in human history. It offers the promise of feeding a burgeoning global
    population sustainably, reducing the ecological footprint of agriculture, and
    enhancing the resilience of food systems in the face of climate change. Yet, it
    also raises questions about data security, privacy, and equitable access to these
    transformative technologies. As we embark on this exploration of AI and smart
    technologies in agriculture, we must recognize that we are at the cusp of a new
    agricultural revolution. The seeds of innovation have been sown, and it is our
    responsibility to nurture this burgeoning field to ensure a greener, more abundant,
    and more technologically advanced future of agriculture [13,14,15]. “Precision
    agriculture is an approach to farm management that uses information technology
    (IT) to ensure that crop and soil receive exactly wat they need for optimum health
    and productivity. The goal of PA is to ensure profitability, sustainability and
    protection of the environment” (Fig. 1). Fig. 1 Agriculture system Full size image
    “PA is also known as satellite agriculture as needed farming and site-specific
    crop management (SSCM). Modern farming has involved since the day of horse/bullock
    drawn plough. According to Taro Mieno, Assistant Professor, Department of agriculture
    and economics, university of Nebraska. Lincoln, dedicated research worker showed
    the impact of adopting precision technology on farms. Mieno’s research focuses
    specifically on how precision agriculture technologies impact profitability for
    farmers. PA recognizes the diversity of characteristics within a field through
    technology. Some examples of precision agriculture include drones, Global Positioning
    system (GPS) and irrigation technologies [13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20]. The goal of
    precision agriculture is to learn new management practices to increase the profitability
    of agricultural production. Therefore, it is necessary to develop low-cost technologies,
    so that the farmers of developing countries may also be benefited by high level
    technologies. 2 Types of Precision Agriculture Precision AG’s editor Eric sfiligoy
    has prepared a list of the top 10 technologies that are shaping precision precision
    agriculture today. Most involve some level of robotics, navigation, sensors and
    variable rate dispensing (Fig. 2). Fig. 2 Precision agricultural cycle Full size
    image 1. GPS/GNSS: Its hard to tell exactly where the state of precision agriculture
    today would be without GPS-literally. From virtually movement agriculture gained
    access to position locating satellites in the 1990’s, operators and manufactures
    have found out various ways to the tie into the tools to make managing field work
    much easier and accurate. In North America and Europe, grower can turn on the
    tractors and get to work almost immediately, says T.J.Schulte, marketing manager
    for trimble agriculture Division. Looking beyond these caopabilities, experts
    say that satellite technology is truly deserving of its “global” monitor. “No
    longer can we refer to all these system as GPS-that is not an accurate description
    when referring to new global Navigation Satellite system (GNSS) receiver technology
    today”. Instead, Grey Guyette adds GNSS covers all countries satellite con stellations
    including GPS, GLONASS and Galileo [21,22,23] (Fig. 3). Fig. 3 GPS Full size image
    2. Mobile Devices: After figuring out where PA stands on the planets, the next
    most important innovation these past 20 year would have to be the development
    of mobile devices. “Without the cell phone, we probably would still be sitting
    in barn a lot, waiting for someone to come to the barn and make things work”,
    Says Reifsteck. Today, cell phone has morphed into a whole host of useful mobile
    devices including smatphone and tablets. As of 2016, most precision agriculture
    manufactures that dabble in the mobile devices market have spent most of their
    time trying to expand the capabilities these products can offer to users. According
    to Dr. M. Barnes “if you cannot get your technical data to work for the farmers
    within first 20 min after he receives it, he is probably never going to use it”.
    Robotics: Robots are taking on making many tasks in agriculture these days, including
    planting greenhouse crops and pruning vineyards. In a different approach, the
    Fendt MARS (Mobile Agriculture Robot Swarms) project utilizers small corn seeding
    robots that are lightweight, energy efficient, highly agile, cloud controlled
    and operated from tablet app [24,25,26,27]. Irrigation: Innovations in precision
    agriculture technologies are growing even more crucial as growers face water scarcity
    due t drought, aquifer depletion and water allocations. Adoption with valley irrigation,
    products now allow growers to remotely monitor, and control nearly facet of their
    irrigation operations. The system save water. Timely, fuel and wear and tear on
    the vehicles. In the future, Compbell says producers will be integrating soil
    moisture monitoring, weather data and variable- rate irrigation (VRI) inti their
    system. Internet of Things: One of the newest buzzwords to hit precision over
    the past few of years is the “Internet of things” (IOT). Simply defined, it’s
    the concept of connecting any device with an on/off switch to the internet. This
    network of connected things could also include people with wearable devices. Most
    recently, a few ag startups and components suppliers (hardware, software etc.)
    are using LPWANs (Low Power wide Area Network) in place of or to augment cellular
    networks in wireless data transmission. These networks are designed to carry small
    amounts of data transmitted intermittently over long ranges” says Paul Welbig
    [28]. Sensors: In precision agriculture, wireless sensors are used to collect
    data on a variety of factors, including soil water availability, soil compaction,
    soil fertility, leaf temperature, leaf area index, plant water status, local climatic
    data, insect-disease-weed infestation, and more. The management of water uses
    some of the most cutting-edge and varied technology now available. The growing
    control of water consumption across the country, as well as the shortage of water,
    will continue to be the driving force for advancements in this field [29]. Variable
    Rate seeding: It might come as a surprise to learn that variable-rate application
    (VRA) seeding is included on this list, considering all of the new and interesting
    technology for precision agriculture that are included. There is not much of a
    difference between it and variable rate fertiliser, because VRA sowing depends
    on your capacity to put together precise data for the seed itself, which is the
    beginning of the agricultural process [30,31,32] (Fig. 4). Fig. 4 Weather modelling
    Full size image When you go into the majority of the country''s agricultural retail
    establishments, there is a good possibility that you will find some form of weather
    tracker on display. There is perhaps no other variable that is both as significant
    and as unpredictably vital as the weather. However, assistance is on its way.
    “Over the past 25 years, you’ve gotten a lot of important technologies developed
    that would be even more valuable with quality weather modelling, but we are now
    at a point where assuring good crop yields is key to making certain the world
    has food solutions that works”, says Jeff Kaiser, Vice President, Iteris. As an
    illustration of this, consider the case of a potato planter in the Northern Plains
    who discovered that harvesting his crop at a particular temperature was essential
    to preserving the crop''s quality and consistency. “But by using clear Ag, this
    grower was able to take all their soil reading remotely and he was able to accomplish
    his harvest a lot more efficiently than even before” [33,34,35,36]. Nitrogen Modelling:
    The fertilizer have been used in forms of variable rate for decades, nitrogen
    modelling has become pronounced recently. “Our clientele has been using variable
    rate technologies for fertilizer applications Since the mid 1990s”, says Matt
    waits, CEO for SST software. “However, the complexity of the N-cycle and how it
    is in a constant state of fux has always made managing nitrogen difficult”. A
    recent partnership between SST software and agronomic technology Corp (ATC) resulted
    in the introduction of Adopt-N. Adopt-N was initially presented to the public
    in 2014, and according to Steve Sibulkin, Chief Executive Officer of ATC, it is
    rapidly becoming into an essential instrument for effectively regulating the utilization
    of nitrogen. The overwhelming majority of farmers desire an easy-to-implement
    solution that will allow them to handle these issues (Fig. 5). Fig. 5 Controlled
    release micronutrient fertilizer for precision farming Full size image Standardization:
    Initial efforts to implement this began almost eight years ago with the founding
    of the agriculture industry electronic foundation. Equipment manufacturers’ components,
    mainly those that adhere to the ISOBUS standard, continue to make their way into
    official circulation. More than 170 businesses, associations, and other types
    of organisations are currently part of the group and are actively working together
    to ensure that the standards are effective. However, industry players who have
    to deal with equipment compatibility “ On the ground” continue to be unhappy,
    and third party tech specialists frequently have difficulty managing items from
    rival providers. It is a lot better than it was, but it is still a significant
    problem. There will come a day, ideally, when components will get to the point
    where they are pretty much plug-and-play. It’s interesting to know that Precision
    Agriculture sure drive system today have wireless sensors together data on soil
    availability, Compaction, infertility and other data [37,38,39]. 3 Precision Agriculture’s
    Role in the New Era of the Farm Land Sector. The new generation of Agriculture
    systems addresses climate change adaptation alongside investor’s usual goals of
    improving yield and reducing costs. Precision farming refers to the precise application
    of agricultural inputs with respect to soil, weather as well as to crop need in
    order to improve productivity, quality and profitability in agriculture. Hence,
    precision agriculture is about going the right thing, in the right place, in the
    right way at the right [40]. 3.1 Advantages of Precision Farming It did this by
    increasing agricultural productivity and halting soil deterioration on areas suitable
    for cultivation, which led to further agricultural advancement. It will result
    in a reduction in the excessive use of chemicals in agricultural production. Precision
    farming allows for more effective use of available water resources. Agricultural
    fields may be surveyed more easily with the use of GPS. Additionally, the yield
    as well as the features of the soil may be plotted. The dissemination of knowledge
    on agricultural methods, with the goals of improving crop quality and quantity
    while simultaneously lowering production costs. Through the optimization of agrochemical
    products, it lessens the threat to the environment, in particular with regard
    to the leaching of nitrates and the poisoning of groundwater. It enhances the
    possibilities for better resource management, which in turn helps to decrease
    the number of resources that are wasted. An undulated field may be subdivided
    into smaller plots according to the specific needs of the individual customers.
    3.2 Disadvantages of Precision Farming Farmers may be dissuaded from adopting
    this style of farming due to the high initial investment required. Techniques
    for precision farming are still in the process of being developed and require
    the advise of specialists before they can be put into practise. It is possible
    that it will take several years before sufficient data is collected to really
    deploy the system in its entirety. It is a very challenging endeavor, particularly
    the gathering of data and the interpretation of the results. 3.3 How Could India
    Benefit from Precision Farming? A decrease in the cost of production, an increase
    in productivity, and a more efficient use of natural resources may all be achieved
    in India through the development, refinement, and wider deployment of precision
    agricultural technology. It has the potential to completely transform the way
    farms are managed in modern India. As a result of improvements in profitability,
    productivity, sustainability, crop quality, environmental protection, on-farm
    quality of life, food safety, and rural economic growth. Application of site-specific
    irrigation in wheat grown in Punjab and Haryana, use of site-specific herbicides
    in cotton, and application of site-specific fertilizers in oil palm plantation
    in south India, as well as coffee and tea gardens in eastern India. India is able
    to significantly lower manufacturing costs, as well as lower production expenses,
    and lower the amount of chemicals that are loaded into the environment [41]. When
    there are limited amounts of water available, it can improve the efficiency of
    the irrigation system. In addition to this, it offers new instruments for the
    evaluation of multifunctional features, such as those that do not involve the
    market, and it expands job chances for those with specialized training in the
    agriculture industry. The farmer may utilize the prediction to prevent issues
    like as water stress, nutritional inadequacy, and pest and disease infestation.
    The state of greenhouses in agricultural areas may be monitored by it, which is
    an important function it plays. 4 Challenges in Adopting Precision Farming in
    India 1. The implementation of PA in India is still in the preliminary stages
    as a result of the country''s distinctive pattern of land ownership, its inadequate
    infrastructure, the reluctance of farmers to take risks, as well as the country''s
    social, economic, and demographic circumstances. 2. The majority of Indian agriculture
    is conducted on very tiny plots of land, which restricts the economic improvements
    that may be made with the precision farming equipment that is now available. 4.1
    The War Forward New windows of opportunity for the implementation of precision
    farming are opening up in India as a result of the rapid socioeconomic shifts
    that include economic growth, urbanization, and increased energy consumption.
    Instead of blindly adopting the advanced precision agriculture technologies adopted
    by developed countries, India should adopt technologies based on the need of socio-economic
    condition of the country (IAS express-2022). 5 How Precision Agriculture in India
    is Adopted According to Rashika Solomon (2020), the agriculture is backbone of
    India’s economy, which accounts for 18% of India’s gross domestic product (GDP)
    and hires about half of the countries workforce. More than 70% of rural families
    depend on agriculture for their livelihood. The implementation of forward-thinking
    agricultural practises such as precision agriculture is a viable option for accomplishing
    this objective. The PA is an integrated crop management system that monitors the
    agricultural field at ground level using remote sensing (RS), global positioning
    system (GPS), and geographical information system (GIS). Recording and mapping
    the variations in crop and soil parameters that are present within a field is
    done. Following this, management decisions are made based on the findings of ongoing
    assessments of the spatial variability within the given field. In India, it is
    referred to as the efficient use of agricultural inputs in order to achieve higher
    levels of crop output (Gunnamreddy, 2022). 6 Conclusion Technologies that enable
    precision agriculture are playing an increasingly important part in the production
    of food crops. PA, For example, a guiding system for tractors that uses GPS. The
    use of global positioning system (GPS) technology for mapping soil and yield as
    well as variable-rate input applications helps farmers collect information on
    the changing field condition so that production techniques may be adjusted. Soil
    mapping, a similar precision technique, provides farmers with additional data
    that they can really use. When creating soil maps, more soil samples are collected,
    and zones are used to depict the different soil types, nitrate levels, and pH
    acidity readings. GPS is used by farmers to plot yield maps and data on maps in
    synchronisation with one another. Nevertheless, soil maps have a lot of practical
    applications since they display properties of the ground that are likely to be
    consistent from year to year. Finally, variable rate input application technology
    (VRT) enables farmers to tailor the application of fertiliser, chemicals, and
    pesticides by making use of GPS data, which is often derived from yield and soil
    maps. The adoption of PA in India depends on the pressure of population which
    is growing rapidly and more than 65% are directly employed by agricultural system.
    Therefore, it is of the utmost importance to modernize conventional agricultural
    techniques and be ready for an impending technological revolution in order to
    build an environmentally friendly system for increasing crop yield. The implementation
    of forward-thinking agricultural practices such as precision agriculture is a
    viable option for accomplishing this objective. PA is an integrated crop management
    system that monitors the agricultural field at ground level using remote sensing
    (RS), global positioning systems (GPS), and geographic information systems (GIS).
    Recording and mapping the differences in crop or soil qualities that are present
    within a field is done. In India, it is known as the exact exploitation of agricultural
    inputs to discover improved crop output by utilizing precision agriculture. This
    is done in an effort to improve food security. References Anonymous: What is precision

    of cultivating plants and rearing livestock to obtain food and other products.
    It serves as a source of sustenance and provides employment opportunities for
    people. Farmers carefully choose the most suitable crop for their land by considering
    yield comparisons based on price, market demand, selling price, cultivation budget,
    and crop production range [1]. Once the crop is selected, the next step in the
    agricultural process is land preparation, which involves adding fertilizer to
    maintain optimal soil fertility and minimize the impact of crop diseases. It also
    entails designing the irrigation system based on the land layout. The subsequent
    stage is seed selection, which considers price, quantity, and water requirements
    specific to the area. Seed selection aims to enhance yield and improve the crop’s
    disease resistance [2]. The fifth step in the crop farming cycle is irrigation,
    which ensures that the crop receives adequate water and is conducted promptly
    to support growth until harvest. Crop growth is a crucial aspect of the farming
    cycle and encompasses monitoring overall crop development [3]. Farmers monitor
    fertilizer deployment, compare crop growth with expected outcomes, and take pre-emptive
    measures against diseases. The final stage is harvesting, which entails harvesting
    the crop at the optimal time and using appropriate methods or machinery suitable
    for the specific crop type. All these steps are vital for cultivating a healthy
    crop. Traditional agricultural methods often neglect the importance of these steps,
    resulting in suboptimal crop yields. Several technologies emerged in agriculture
    to enhance crop productivity. In this work, we propose an IoT-driven approach
    to optimize the fertilization. 1.1 Fertilization Fertilization is the process
    of applying fertilizers to enrich the nutrient composition of the soil. Fertilization
    plays a vital role in stimulating the growth of crops and increasing overall production.
    Farmers utilize fertilizers to improve soil productivity and quality. Fertilizers,
    whether obtained from natural or synthetic sources, can take the form of organic
    or inorganic substances. Their primary function is to be applied to the soil,
    delivering vital nutrients to plants [4]. These nutrients are available in significant
    amounts or in a form that plants can readily utilize. In agriculture, fertilizers
    are categorized into bio-fertilizers and chemical fertilizers [5]. Bio-fertilizers
    use organic waste and other biological agents to enhance soil fertility. At the
    same time, chemical fertilizers consist of the primary nutrients Nitrogen, Phosphorous,
    and Potassium (NPK) and secondary nutrients such as Magnesium, Calcium, and Sulfur.
    Fertilization Techniques: Numerous techniques are employed for fertilization.
    However, in traditional fertilization methods, farmers often lack awareness of
    the specific nutrient requirements of the soil. Consequently, fertilizers are
    applied without consideration of the soil''s nutrient composition. The farmers
    cannot accurately assess the levels of critical nutrients such as Nitrogen, Phosphorous,
    and Potassium (NPK) in the ground. As a result, the quantity of fertilizer applied
    may lead to either over-fertilization or under-fertilization of the area. Issues
    with existed fertilization techniques: Lack of farmer awareness regarding the
    precise role of fertilizers in crop production. Crop damage from excessive fertilizer
    application affects the plants’ health and increases productivity. Time and labor-intensive
    nature of the traditional fertilization methods. Imbalanced soil nutrient levels,
    particularly with respect to Nitrogen, Phosphorous, and Potassium (NPK), leading
    to compromised crop quality and reduced yield. 1.2 IoT in Agriculture IoT, an
    emergent technology, facilitates the interconnection of intelligent devices via
    the Internet. It creates a global network that links various instruments to achieve
    specific goals [6]. IoT, utilizing multiple technologies, enhances convenience
    and comfort in daily life. Its applications extend to numerous fields, including
    intelligent agriculture [7], smart cities [8], smart homes [9], innovative business
    solutions [10], health care [10], intelligent vehicles, and sports and leisure
    activities [11]. Integrating IoT technology into traditional agriculture has increased
    intelligent agriculture [12]. Smart agriculture employs smart control and decision-making
    devices that enable timely and accurate decision-making. This approach ensures
    efficient resource allocation by supplying water and fertilizers based on demand,
    thereby minimizing resource wastage and maintaining soil fertility levels. The
    adoption of modern techniques in agriculture aims to enhance crop quality and
    production. IoT has transformed agriculture into precision agriculture and micro-agriculture
    [13]. Precision agriculture involves implementing site-specific management systems
    for crops [14]. It focuses on maximizing agricultural output while minimizing
    resource inputs [15]. In precision agriculture, digital technology, remote sensing,
    global positioning systems (GPS), and IoT are utilized to optimize farming practices
    and reduce costs. Smart farming automates various farming tasks and reduces the
    need for human intervention. Traditional agriculture has evolved into precision
    agriculture with the integration of IoT technology [16]. IoT applications in agriculture
    include soil monitoring systems [17], smart farming [18], intelligent irrigation
    systems [19], and the supply of fresh agricultural products [20]. IoT-enabled
    e-agriculture applications effortlessly provide real-time information, benefiting
    rural farmers and reducing human workload. One such application is smart farming,
    which combines agriculture and IoT technologies. Agri-IoT is a framework designed
    to assist farmers by providing timely information about farm conditions and potential
    risks, enabling them to protect their crops from damage [18]. 2 Related Work In
    recent years, the agriculture field has witnessed the emergence of various techniques
    aimed at enhancing productivity and improving crop quality. Several of these techniques
    are discussed in this section. Khelifa et al. have introduced an intelligent irrigation
    system utilizing IoT technology [19]. This system is specifically designed to
    conserve water resources in Algeria and contribute to the country''s agricultural
    economy. Addressing the challenges faced by farmers, Mohanraj et al. have developed
    an automated agriculture field monitoring system [17]. The model encompasses various
    components: knowledge acquisition, comprehension, analysis, knowledge base, and
    the crop selection phase. Lee et al. have introduced an IoT-based agriculture
    production system [21]. In the pursuit of enhancing crop quality and productivity,
    Marie and Rosman have developed a model for detecting NPK levels using an optical
    transducer [12]. Ryu et al. reported an IoT-based connected farm for an intelligent
    farming system [22]. The design incorporates sensors and controllers that utilize
    the Internet via platforms like Cube and Mobius to collect data. With the help
    of a smartphone application, farmers can remotely control various aspects of their
    farm, including water supply, nutrient levels, ventilation, cover usage, and LED
    lighting. Haghverdi et al. have introduced a site-specific water production function
    (WPF) [23]. This system utilizes techniques such as neural networks, k-nearest
    neighbor, and linear regression to design and evaluate the WPF. P and Mahalakshmi
    have proposed an IoT-driven field monitoring and automated irrigation system,
    which is specifically designed for areas with low water levels [24]. Sensors monitor
    the crop field and transmit data to web servers using wireless transmission. Farmers
    receive periodic notifications on their mobile devices, allowing them to monitor
    the condition of their crops from anywhere. To improve soil fertility, Wang et
    al. have introduced a precision irrigation–fertilization controller system [25].
    This system manages the pH concentration by mixing water to maintain the desired
    level. To overcome the challenges related to scalability and compatibility of
    IoT devices, Cambra et al. have introduced a novel IoT-based agriculture monitoring
    system [26]. The system utilizes a service-oriented architecture (SOA) with a
    standardized interface (LoRa by Lora Alliance) for device communication. In farming,
    Bhowmick et al. have introduced an IoT-enabled innovative agriculture application
    [27]. Further, the fertilization issues are resolved using a low-cost IoT-based
    fertilizer notification system [16]. The NPK sensor, designed with colorimetric
    principles using LDR and LED, is connected to a microcontroller unit for NPK value
    analysis. Dewi and Chen have created a decision-making system that relies on IoT
    data collection [28]. This system effectively utilizes IoT devices to gather localized
    data on crucial parameters such as soil moisture, temperature, humidity, water
    level, and light intensity. Das et al. have presented an intelligent agricultural
    system using IoT in India [29]. This system focuses on mitigating crop loss during
    harvesting and post-harvest stages by incorporating several sensors (soil moisture,
    temperature, humidity, E-nose motion, and pest sensors) with the Raspberry Pi
    model. For optimizing fertilizer recommendations, Premashudha and Leena have introduced
    an IoT-enabled solution [30]. The DSS utilizes cloud web GIS servers, mobile applications,
    and kiosk systems. Joshi and Goudar have introduced an IoT-based automated solution
    [31]. This system enables farmers to control electric water motors using their
    Android phones, providing convenience and reducing dependency on electricity for
    irrigation. Pandithurai et al. have presented the digital monitoring of soil and
    crops using IoT in the Agro-Tech system [32]. This system combines IoT applications
    with traditional agricultural techniques. Kamienski et al. have developed an intelligent
    water management system for precision irrigation [33]. Mucherino et al. have incorporated
    data mining techniques into the agricultural field [34]. The k-means clustering
    algorithm is utilized in wine fermentation to group apples into clusters based
    on their growth patterns. It facilitates classification as good or bad for further
    fermentation. 3 IoT-Based System for Fertilizer Detection The proposed model operates
    in three stages: data acquisition, transformation, and analysis. During the data
    acquisition phase, wireless sensor nodes collect information on soil nutrients
    and other fundamental inputs from the fields. Subsequently, the collected data
    is formatted appropriately, incorporating additional details such as crop type
    and time frame, before being transmitted to a remote server. The transformation
    process is tailored to the application and performed using smart devices. Finally,
    data analysis occurs on the remote server, and the resulting insights are communicated
    to the farmer (Fig. 1). Fig. 1 IoT-based model for precision agriculture Full
    size image 1. Data Acquisition: The data acquisition phase encompasses several
    vital operations, including deploying wireless sensor nodes, network configuration,
    and data collection. The first step involves selecting the area for cultivation.
    Subsequently, wireless sensor nodes are deployed in the field, configuring the
    network accordingly. Once deployed, the nodes collect data on primary nutrients
    (NPK) and other external parameters such as temperature, moisture, and pH. The
    collected data is then streamed and made available on the farmer''s smartphone
    for access and monitoring. The soil samples are collected from various regional
    locations to normalize the NPK values. IoT-based wireless NPK sensors are embedded
    in the soil. 2. Data Transformation: The collected data is processed and transformed
    into the appropriate format to meet the application''s requirements. This transformation
    ensures that the data is compatible with the desired analysis or processing tasks.
    Additionally, the data is supplemented with additional inputs such as the type
    of crop, time frame, and any other relevant information. Once the data is appropriately
    formatted and enriched, it is migrated to a remote server or cloud platform for
    further analysis and processing. 3. Data Analysis: The farmer''s request is processed
    at the cloud platform, and a response is generated based on soil nutrient values
    and external parameters’ analysis. The analytic process considers the farmer''s
    input and compares it with the collected data to provide relevant information
    and recommendations. For example, suppose a farmer queries about the fertilizer
    requirements for a specific crop. In that case, the system analyzes the soil nutrient
    values. It provides a response that includes the recommended amount of fertilizer,
    composition guidelines, and suitable temperature conditions for optimal crop growth.
    This response is returned to the farmer, enabling them to make informed decisions
    and take appropriate actions in their agricultural practices. 3.1 Toy Example
    1. Data Acquisition Step 1: Choose the area for cultivation. Step 2: Install and
    configure wireless sensor nodes in the selected area. Step 3: Gather data using
    the deployed sensor nodes (Table 1). Table 1 Acquisition phase data from sensors
    Full size table 2. Data Transformation Step 4: The user determines crop selection
    and time frame, and the collected data is organized and transferred to a cloud
    platform. 3. Data Analysis Step 5: Load the sample values or data into memory.
    Step 6: Set the algorithmic parameters, such as “population size = 10”, “number
    of clusters (Ki = 1)”, and maximum number of iterations = 20, where i = 1, 2,
    … n. Step 7: Select the initial seed point K1 (15.949, 1.718, 13.068, 6.2, 30).
    Step 8: Evaluate the objective function and update the solution. Step 9: Check
    the termination condition. If it is met, stop the process; otherwise, repeat the
    steps. Step 10: Obtain the optimal solution. For example, the optimal solution
    obtained after the 20th iteration is K1 (4.634, 1.57, 4.715, 6.6, 29.30). The
    optimal values (4.634, 1.57, 4.715, 6.6, 29.30) are compared with the predefined
    database values for wheat crops shown in Table 2. Table 2 List of crops with NPK,
    pH, and temperature values Full size table Based on this comparison, the predicted
    amount of fertilizer (NPK) is (5.366, 0.43, 1.2), the variation in pH is 0.1,
    and the suitable temperature is 2.3. The response is then sent back to the farmer,
    suggesting implementing these recommendations in the cultivation area. 4 Conclusion
    and Future Scope This research introduces an approach that utilizes IoT technology
    to create a model for fertilizer detection. The aim is to precisely forecast the
    ideal amount of fertilizer required for cultivating crops. The model consists
    of three main phases: data acquisition, transformation, and analysis. During the
    data acquisition phase, soil nutrient values are collected, while in the transformation
    phase, the collected data is processed and transferred to a cloud platform for
    further analysis. Subsequently, a suitable response is generated and communicated
    back to the farmer. The proposed model effectively addresses common fertilization
    challenges such as over-fertilization, under-fertilization, and nutrient imbalances,
    all while ensuring cost-effectiveness. Future research will focus on incorporating
    additional external parameters like humidity and weather conditions to enhance
    the model’s accuracy. Additionally, the cultivation area will be divided into
    distinct regions, enabling a geographically based analysis to optimize crop quality
    and production further. References Spuhler D, Carle N (2019) Retrieved from https://sswm.info/sswm-solutions-bop-markets/improving-water-and-sanitation-services-provided-public-institutions-0/crop-selection

    of escalating global challenges such as population growth, climate change, and
    urbanization, the call to reimagine our agricultural and horticultural systems
    becomes more critical than ever. The shadow of these issues hovers ominously over
    future food security, intertwined with the sustainable usage of our dwindling
    natural resources [1]. Yet, in this realm of concerns, a beacon of promise emerges
    from technological advancements, holding the potential to revolutionize the agricultural
    and horticultural landscapes [2]. Our pursuit, therefore, centers on the strategic
    leverage of these cutting-edge technologies to create more sustainable, productive,
    and resilient farming ecosystems worldwide. Sustainable access to high-quality
    food is not just a predicament for developing countries; even developed nations
    are grappling with this issue. Current agricultural practices, conducted predominantly
    in open fields, are not sufficiently productive to meet the escalating demand.
    As the World Health Organization projects, food production will need to increase
    by 70% by 2050 to meet the needs of an estimated global population of 10 billion
    [3], about 7 billion of whom will be living in urban areas [4]. Thus, exploring
    alternative production systems becomes not just an option but a necessity to ensure
    a sustainable food supply chain. One promising alternative is Controlled Environment
    Agriculture (CEA), which includes a variety of methods such as greenhouses, high-tunnels,
    vertical farms, and plant factories [5]. In particular, greenhouse farming has
    emerged as a method offering greater control over the growing conditions of crops,
    thereby enhancing yield and quality. This technique leverages controlled environments
    to optimize plant growth, promising higher production rates compared to traditional
    farming [6]. However, despite the potential of greenhouse farming within the CEA
    framework, it faces certain challenges. Economic sustainability remains a significant
    concern due to high operational costs, complex microclimate controls, and the
    need for continuous labor [7], [8]. These factors can inhibit the scalability
    and efficiency of greenhouse farming. To overcome these obstacles, it is imperative
    to incorporate advanced technologies such as artificial intelligence (AI) and
    deep learning (DL) into these farming systems. These cutting-edge tools can potentially
    transform the operational aspects of greenhouse farming. For instance, they can
    be leveraged for improved micro-environment monitoring and root-zone control,
    creating the optimal conditions for plant growth while minimizing resource wastage
    [5]. Additionally, AI and DL can facilitate the automation of labor-intensive
    tasks, thereby enhancing overall operational efficiency. In this context, the
    adoption and integration of AI and DL in greenhouse farming becomes not only a
    strategic advantage but a necessity to realize the full potential of Controlled
    Environment Agriculture(CEA) in addressing our global food security challenges.
    Simultaneously, the sphere of horticulture presents a distinct set of challenges
    and opportunities. Here, we face the necessity of balancing the cultural and economic
    value of crops with the labor-intensive nature of their cultivation. Thankfully,
    modern advancements offer promising solutions. Deep learning, in particular, holds
    the potential to streamline and revolutionize horticultural practices. The sheer
    volume of data that can now be collected from digital horticulture necessitates
    efficient processing and analysis. Deep learning algorithms can effectively handle
    such ‘big data’, enabling precise and timely decision-making in crop management
    [9]. In light of these advancements, it is crucial to remember that the applicability
    of such technologies is not limited to large-scale farming. Small indoor farms,
    which require significant labor year-round, can also benefit from the integration
    of intelligent automation. This inclusive approach to technological application
    in agriculture is critical to ensure food security in the long term. Through this
    review, we strive to explore and underline the recent advances in deep learning-assisted
    computer vision technologies in the domains of agriculture and horticulture in
    greenhouse setup. We aim to shed light on the challenges, opportunities, and future
    prospects of these technologies, underlining their potential role in securing
    global food supply chains, improving horticultural productivity, and propelling
    us towards a sustainable future. A. Review Scope In our extensive review of over
    100 research papers sourced from esteemed scientific databases such as ScienceDirect,
    Web of Science, IEEE Xplore, and Scopus, we noticed a trend: while many surveys
    tackled the broader agricultural domain, there was a distinct gap in the literature
    specifically focusing on greenhouse farming. Recognizing this limited attention
    to greenhouse environments, we sought to make a significant contribution by narrowing
    our scope and offering an in-depth analysis of computer vision applications within
    greenhouse farming. This work emphasizes the state-of-the-art in computer vision
    techniques for this specialized agricultural setting. Table 1 provides a comparison
    between existing survey papers on deep learning-based computer vision applications
    in the broader agricultural domain and our niche exploration into greenhouses.
    With our paper, our aim was to shed light on every potential application of computer
    vision in greenhouse agriculture. This review is intended not only for agricultural
    researchers keen on understanding nuances in greenhouse setups but also for general
    computer vision enthusiasts curious about its specific applications in such controlled
    environments. Furthermore, we have pointed out the real-world impacts and challenges
    of scaling up these innovative solutions within greenhouses. TABLE 1 Comparison

    showcases the in-depth analysis of computer vision capabilities, specifically
    in controlled greenhouse environments. SECTION II. Smart Greenhouse: An Overview
    Controlled Environment Agriculture (CEA), a modern farming method that uses greenhouses,
    is a powerful tool in today’s agriculture. This method is not new; in fact, greenhouses
    first started to be used in farming in The Netherlands and France back in the
    19th century [13]. Since then, the technology has improved, and its use has spread
    worldwide. So, what exactly is a greenhouse? Essentially, a greenhouse is a structure
    - often built from glass or plastic that allows for year-round crop production,
    irrespective of the season. The glass or plastic walls and roof let sunlight in
    while keeping pests, diseases, and bad weather out. Depending on the outside weather,
    different variations of greenhouses can be used. For example, in very cold places,
    smaller greenhouses called “cold frames” can be used. These structures trap heat
    from the sun to keep the plants warm. In hot and dry areas, “shade house” greenhouses
    can be used. These provide shade and help to keep the plants moist [7]. As illustrated
    in figure 1, a modern greenhouse is a structure that provides a controlled environment
    ideal for crop cultivation. The image depicts a typical setup, including the protective
    coverings and the internal layout. This practical example gives a clear understanding
    of how greenhouse farming can defy external weather conditions and provide suitable
    growth conditions for diverse crops. FIGURE 1. A real-life example of a modern
    greenhouse. This image offers a practical perspective of the controlled environment
    within which diverse crops can be cultivated irrespective of external weather
    conditions. Source: [14]. Show All The main advantage of greenhouses is the ability
    to manipulate environmental parameters such as temperature, light intensity, moisture,
    and nutrient levels, adapting them to specific crop needs [15]. This facilitates
    an extended growing season, improved crop quality, and efficient use of resources.
    However, the management and maintenance of greenhouses can be resource-intensive,
    and fine-tuning conditions to the optimal range for various crops can be a complex
    task. This is where smart greenhouses, equipped with Internet of Things (IoT)
    technology, come into the picture. Smart greenhouses integrate sensors and embedded
    controllers that collect real-time data and relay it to a cloud server. The system
    can then make automatic adjustments to the internal greenhouse conditions based
    on this data, minimizing human intervention [16], [17], [18]. Smart greenhouses
    offer automatic regulation of critical factors like temperature, light, and irrigation,
    as well as control over other mechanical operations [19]. This brings a new level
    of efficiency to farming, optimizing resource use and potentially improving crop
    yields. Moreover, smart greenhouses provide farmers with valuable insights into
    the most suitable harvesting times, soil quality, nutrient requirements for plants,
    and water quality [20]. This data-driven approach allows for more informed decision-making,
    making farming more reliable and cost-effective. The future of farming appears
    even more promising with the integration of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Computer
    Vision. These technologies can further automate the greenhouse processes and increase
    their precision [21], [22], [23]. For instance, AI can analyze the vast amounts
    of data collected, predicting future needs and helping make even more accurate
    adjustments [24], [25]. Computer Vision can monitor plant growth, detect diseases
    early, and even identify when crops are ready to be harvested [12], [26], [27],
    [28], [29]. In essence, the marriage of greenhouse farming with IoT, AI, and Computer
    Vision is ushering in a new era of efficient, data-driven agriculture, transforming
    the traditional greenhouse into a ‘smart’ one (see figure 2). This integration,
    as illustrated in figure 2, provides a complete picture of how smart greenhouses
    are designed with various components working harmoniously. The ultimate vision
    is a fully automated and remotely controlled farm, optimizing resources, enhancing
    crop yield, and paving the way for a sustainable agricultural future. FIGURE 2.

    AI, and Computer Vision Technologies. Show All SECTION III. Vision Through Learning:
    A Deep Dive Into Computer Vision and Deep Learning Computer vision (CV) represents
    a sophisticated interdisciplinary field deeply rooted in both biological science
    and engineering, converging human-like perception with machine efficiency. Its
    core idea revolves around replicating how humans see and understand their surroundings
    and translating this understanding into computational models that machines can
    utilize. Historically, CV began as an effort to mimic human visual faculties.
    Early research aimed at understanding how humans perceive the world and then endowing
    machines with similar visual abilities. This required extensive collaboration
    between neuroscience to decode the human visual system and computer science to
    develop corresponding algorithms for machines [30]. Groundbreaking applications
    such as optical character recognition (OCR) [31] and vehicle plate detection marked
    the initial steps in this journey, impacting diverse areas like traffic control,
    law enforcement [32], and even retail [33]. These achievements were furthered
    by the use of deep learning (DL) and neural networks, allowing for the automatic
    extraction of high-level features from data, reducing the need for human intervention.
    The evolutionary development of CV expanded into more advanced areas like medical
    imaging, for detecting and diagnosing diseases [34], and autonomous driving, where
    it guides self-driving cars [35]. In manufacturing, CV aids in quality control
    with machine consistency, surpassing human ability [36]. It even breathes life
    into virtual reality in entertainment and social interaction [37] and enhances
    personalized safety measures through facial recognition systems in security [38],
    [39]. A vivid representation of these diverse applications of computer vision
    across various sectors can be seen in figure 3. An intriguing expansion of CV
    can be seen in the agricultural domain [12], [40], [41], [42]. Here, CV assists
    not only in crop-related tasks but also plays a significant role in livestock
    management. It contributes to monitoring animal health, tracking behavior, and
    managing resources, thereby increasing efficiency and sustainability in animal
    farming. For crop health, CV enables the detection of diseases, identification
    of pests, and optimization of resource allocation. With the analysis of visual
    data, CV tools can automate tasks like fruit picking, guide precision farming
    techniques, and even assist in tasks related to animal husbandry, such as recognizing
    individual animals, monitoring their movements, and observing their health status.
    FIGURE 3. Diverse Applications of Computer Vision Across Various Sectors. Show
    All Despite these advances, achieving a computer’s understanding of an image at
    a human child’s level remains unattainable. This underscores the ongoing challenges
    in a field with nearly limitless possibilities. The continuous progress in machine
    learning and DL further amplifies what CV can accomplish. Deep neural networks
    enable machines to recognize patterns and make decisions once believed to be exclusive
    to humans. CV is more than a field of study; it is a continually evolving area
    that harmoniously blends human perception with machine precision. Its applications
    are enriching various societal sectors, sometimes even surpassing human capabilities.
    A. From Basic Shapes to Complex Patterns In the initial stages of computer vision,
    the primary focus was on identifying simple and basic geometric forms such as
    edges, curves, and corners. These early techniques were often grounded in methods
    like gray-level segmentation [43], which involves dividing an image into different
    regions based on variations in brightness or color. However, these primitive methods
    had significant limitations and were not robust enough to handle more complicated
    visual tasks where understanding and interpreting complex patterns were required.
    To address these limitations and enhance the interpretation of visual data, researchers
    sought new approaches and began to integrate artificial neural networks into computer
    vision systems [44]. Artificial neural networks, inspired by the human brain’s
    interconnected neuron structure, allowed for a more sophisticated analysis of
    visual data [45]. Unlike the pixel-by-pixel analysis used in more rudimentary
    methods, neural networks provided a way for computer vision systems to analyze
    entire sections of an image in context, providing a more holistic understanding
    of the image content. This shift in approach led to substantial improvements in
    both performance and accuracy, enabling computer vision systems to understand
    and recognize more intricate patterns and shapes. Furthermore, these new methods
    allowed computer vision systems to analyze dynamic visual data, such as videos,
    enabling a higher level of interpretation that considered not only the shapes
    and patterns within a single frame but also how these elements changed over time
    [46]. The integration of neural networks marked a turning point in the field,
    transforming it from a discipline that could only handle rudimentary visual tasks
    to one that could take on complex challenges. This evolution also laid the groundwork
    for the modern, advanced applications of computer vision that we see today. Today’s
    computer vision applications follow a process that includes the acquisition of
    image data, the processing and analysis of that data using sophisticated algorithms
    and neural networks, and ultimately, the interpretation of the image as shown
    in figure 4. These applications range from medical imaging to autonomous vehicles,
    demonstrating the field’s progress from understanding basic shapes to interpreting
    complex, dynamic patterns. FIGURE 4. Flowchart of the Computer Vision Process.
    This diagram illustrates the sequential stages involved in computer vision applications,
    from the initial acquisition of image data to the final interpretation and utilization
    of the processed information. Show All B. The Toolbox of Computer Vision: Techniques
    and Tasks Computer vision is a diverse and exciting field that tries to mimic
    how humans perceive and understand the world around them. Its primary goal is
    to make sense of images, just like our own eyes and brains do. By understanding
    what is depicted in an image, computer vision systems can provide valuable information
    to guide the actions of robots, AI, and other automated systems. In the following
    sections, we will delve deeper into some of these critical techniques: image classification,
    object detection, segmentation, and 3-D reconstruction, that make it all possible.
    1) Image Classification Image classification, a fundamental technique in computer
    vision, assigns predefined labels to images, categorizing complex visuals. Its
    essence is the ability to capture the essential features of a scene—such as differentiating
    crops or identifying plant diseases—without focusing on each tiny detail. The
    advent of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) has led to a significant transformation
    in this process. These robust networks use a variety of mathematical processes
    to efficiently learn from labeled images of crops(In figure 5). The revolution
    began in 2012 with AlexNet [47], a novel CNN architecture, setting a benchmark
    in the ImageNet Large Scale Visual Recognition Challenge, ushering a new era for
    image classification via CNNs. Between 2014 and 2017, there was a surge in refining
    CNN architectures, as seen with advancements in models like ResNet [48], VGG [49],
    and DenseNet [50]. These models, by employing innovative algorithms and connectivity
    patterns, heightened the ability to discern intricate details in agricultural
    imagery. Post-2017 witnessed the incorporation of reinforcement learning into
    CNNs, enabling these models to auto-determine optimal architectures, enhancing
    adaptability in dynamic agricultural environments. Contemporary studies further
    improve upon this with variants like ZFNet [51], which leverages visualization
    tools to understand neural activity, translating this into pixel-space insights.
    Such advancements not only enhance classification abilities but also unveil the
    working mechanisms of CNNs, making image-based agricultural decision-making more
    precise and insightful. Currently, these technologies are of extreme significance
    in improving the accuracy of image-based agricultural decision-making. FIGURE
    5. Diagram of CNN’s image classification architecture mechanism. Show All 2) Object
    Detection Object detection in computer vision aims to locate and classify all
    possible objects within a given image. Central to this task are Convolutional
    Neural Networks (CNNs), which have predominantly been employed in two main architectures:
    one-stage and two-stage detection systems (in figure 6). Two-stage models, exemplified
    by the RCNN family, first pinpoint potential object regions (known as region proposals)
    and then classify these regions into distinct object categories. The evolution
    of this approach has led to various iterations, such as the original RCNN [52],
    Fast RCNN [53], and the more popular Faster RCNN [54]. Three pivotal advancements
    in the Faster RCNN are the Region Proposal Network (RPN), which efficiently creates
    object regions; ROI pooling, which extracts consistent features from regions of
    varying dimensions; and a multitask loss function, which consolidates the training
    process. While Faster RCNN is acclaimed for its accuracy, its processing speed
    is a limiting factor, especially for real-time applications. In contrast, one-stage
    models like YOLO [55] FIGURE 6. CNN architecture mechanism for Object detection.
    Show All and SSD [56] are designed for faster processing. These architectures
    generate candidate object regions from each pixel in feature maps, which are then
    classified and adjusted for accurate object boundaries. However, a key challenge
    with one-stage models is the significant imbalance between object and background
    regions in images. To address this, the RetinaNet [57] framework introduced a
    focal loss function, which emphasizes detection accuracy, balancing out the disproportionate
    number of irrelevant regions. While RetinaNet offers a blend of accuracy and efficiency,
    the choice between one and two-stage models depends largely on the specific application
    needs, with the former being ideal for real-time tasks and the latter prioritized
    when accuracy is paramount. Surprisingly, these state-of-the-art object identification
    methods have significant uses outside of traditional fields. The agricultural
    industry has embraced these technological marvels, especially in the context of
    greenhouse farming. Precision agriculture has entered a new era by adopting such
    advanced object detection technologies in greenhouse farming. These improvements
    have allowed for exact monitoring of plant growth, effective detection of pests,
    and efficient allocation of resources. 3) Segmentation Image segmentation is a
    fundamental computer vision task which categorizes each pixel of an image based
    on the object it belongs to. Early techniques used region division and merging,
    and later algorithms leveraged metrics like intra-regional consistency and inter-regional
    dissimilarity. Recently, machine learning has greatly enhanced segmentation, with
    key advancements being Mask RCNN [58], dual attention network [59], and particularly,
    U-Net [60] and its variants such as Attention U-Net [61], U-Net++ [62], ResUNet++
    [63], and TransUNet [64]. These models have not only advanced the state of image
    segmentation but have also demonstrated exceptional efficacy in specialized tasks
    like medical image segmentation. Building on these semantic and instance segmentation
    techniques, such as the encoder-decoder framework and detection-based methods,
    further expands the versatility and precision of computer vision applications.
    Semantics and instance segmentation are vital techniques in computer vision. At
    a high level, semantic segmentation assigns masks to groups of objects with the
    same meaning in an image, such as all plants, while instance segmentation focuses
    on individual objects. Two primary frameworks are employed in these types of segmentations:
    encoder-decoder-based frameworks and detection-based frameworks. In the encoder-decoder
    approach, models typically consist of two main phases, as shown in figure 7. The
    encoder extracts meaningful feature maps from images using convolutional neural
    networks (CNNs). The decoder, on the other hand, upsamples these feature maps
    into per-pixel labels using transposed convolution. To enhance the precision of
    segmentation, these models often employ a lateral connection scheme. This connects
    feature maps between the encoder and decoder phases, ensuring the preservation
    of the image’s semantic meaning throughout the process. Additionally, post-processing
    methods like conditional random fields (CRFs) are utilized to refine object boundaries.
    Notable models in this category include U-Net, fully convolutional network (FCN)
    [65], FastFCN [66] and DeepLab [67]. FIGURE 7. CNN architecture mechanism for
    Segmentation. Show All Detection-based frameworks, in contrast, pivot on CNN architectures
    tailored for object detection. Some early efforts attempted to leverage object
    detection models, for instance, segmentation, such as simultaneous detection and
    segmentation (SDS) [68] and DeepMask [69]. However, these approaches struggled
    to achieve desired performance levels. The game-changer in this arena was the
    Mask RCNN, which integrated an FCN with a Faster RCNN to create masks for individual
    objects. This model has consistently demonstrated top-tier performance in both
    semantic and instance segmentation, solidifying its reputation in the field. 4)
    3-D Modeling 3-D modeling in computer vision is fundamentally about stereo correspondence
    and 3-D reconstruction [70], [71]. Stereo correspondence generates a 3-D model
    from multiple images of the same object or scene by finding matching pixels across
    these images and mapping their 2-D positions to 3-D. Techniques such as epipolar
    geometry, sparse correspondence, and dense correspondence are commonly used [72].
    On the other hand, 3-D reconstruction creates a 3-D model from a single image
    [73], [74]. The earliest approach involved predicting object shape from visual
    shading, pioneered by Horn in 1970 [75]. This was followed by other “shape from
    X” methods like shape from texture and shape from focus. Active range finding
    and model-based reconstruction, which are often used in architectural 3-D modeling,
    are among other methods. Designing an effective loss function for evaluating predicted
    3-D point clouds against ground truth remains challenging, with options including
    evaluating the coverage of the ground truth object’s silhouette by the projected
    3-D point clouds. Deep-learning-based algorithms have recently led to significant
    enhancements in the performance of 3-D reconstruction systems. In summary, the
    world of computer vision is as complex as it is fascinating, comprising an array
    of techniques and tasks that together help the system understand and interact
    with its environment. With the rapid advancements in machine learning and artificial
    intelligence, we can expect to witness further evolution in these techniques,
    expanding the possibilities of what computer vision can achieve. C. The Advent
    of Deep Learning Machine learning offers a significant advancement in data processing.
    Traditional methods typically necessitate manual feature extraction. With the
    surge in large data sets and the introduction of graphics processing units (GPUs),
    algorithmic methodologies have seen considerable refinement. Deep learning, an
    evolution from traditional machine learning, incorporates some “deeper” (more
    complex) structures, enabling automatic feature extraction from unprocessed data.
    It often surpasses the efficacy of its predecessor in various classification and
    prediction tasks [76]. By integrating multiple layers of abstraction, it allows
    hierarchical data representation [77], [78]. This multi-layered approach enhances
    the analytical performance for numerous large-scale data processing tasks [79],
    [80]. Essentially, deep learning is an advanced non-linear data processing technique
    grounded in representation learning and pattern analysis. Typically, deep learning
    models refine data representations through multi-layered neural networks. These
    networks comprise several neurons structured in layers. Neurons in adjacent layers
    connect based on weights, which are adjusted during learning. These neurons represent
    diverse non-linear functions, facilitating the creation of complex models. By
    connecting multiple layers, deep learning provides solutions for intricate real-world
    challenges efficiently [78]. The complex architecture and massive learning capability
    of deep learning models equip them with exceptional prediction and classification
    capabilities. This enables them to adapt effectively to complex data analyses.
    Leveraging its innate ability for automatic feature extraction, deep learning
    addresses several challenges in agriculture, such as various recognition, growth
    monitoring, yield estimation, quality assessment, stress detection, and more.
    These applications are discussed in detail in the next section. Convolutional
    neural networks (CNNs) and their derived models play a pivotal role in artificial
    intelligence and have led to breakthroughs in image processing and analysis. CNNs
    are a class of deep, feed-forward artificial neural networks (ANNs) that are a
    family of multi-layered neural networks that have been effectively used in computer
    vision applications. They constitute a prominent method for analyzing vast amounts
    of data. Our analysis indicates that a significant majority of horticulture-related
    papers utilize CNNs. Typical CNNs incorporate convolution, pooling, and fully
    connected layers in various configurations to perform complex learning tasks.
    A model CNN architecture displays the process of classifying different flower
    species using multiple layers and components in figure 8. FIGURE 8. A Deep Convolutional
    Neural Network (DCNN) layout: This structure comprises an initial input layer,
    followed by four convolutional layers and their corresponding ReLU activations.
    It also features two stochastic pooling layers, a pair of fully connected layers,
    and concludes with a softmax regression output layer. Source: Prasad et al. [81].
    Show All In the convolutional layer, local patterns within an image are identified
    using the process of convolution. Here is how it works: A kernel is initially
    positioned on the top-left part of the image as shown in figure 9. Each pixel
    under this kernel gets multiplied by the respective kernel value. The resulting
    products are then summed, with a bias added afterwards. The kernel shifts by a
    pixel, and the process continues until the entire image undergoes this filtering.
    Following the convolutional process, the pooling layer steps in, aiming to down-sample
    and extract prominent features from the obtained feature map. It also brings invariance
    to minor translations, rotations, and scaling in the image. Two prevalent pooling
    methods are max and average pooling, as shown in figure 10. While max pooling
    considers the highest value from a designated portion of the image, average pooling
    computes the mean of that portion. In most CNN architectures, convolutional and
    pooling layers alternate. The last key layer is the fully connected layer, where
    every neuron is interlinked to the preceding neuron. In this stage, the various
    features that were obtained from earlier layers are combined and condensed into
    a one-dimensional representation, preparing them for detection or classification
    objectives. FIGURE 9. The process of convolutional operation. Show All FIGURE
    10. The process of pooling operation. Show All The efficacy of a deep learning
    model depends on the appropriate choice of hyperparameters. These include aspects
    like the network architecture, number of layers, number of neurons in the hidden
    layer, convolution and pooling layer structure, learning rate, weight initiation,
    and activation function. While custom architectures can be revolutionary and innovative,
    they typically demand an advanced level of computational expertise that may be
    beyond the capabilities of ordinary agricultural researchers. As a result, researchers
    frequently start with a pre-trained architecture that has proven to perform well
    over a wide range of data structures and challenges and then modify it to fit
    the issue at hand. This approach is reliable and effective. CNN architectures
    like LeNet, AlexNet, VGGNet, MobileNet, Inception V3, EfficientNet, GoogLeNet,
    and ResNet have been deployed for many computer vision tasks discussed in the
    next section. These networks process input through multiple convolution and pooling
    layers before utilizing fully connected layers for classification or detection
    tasks. The choice of parameters within these layers and model selection should
    be tailored to the specific problem as illustrated in Fig 11, graphical representations
    of the SSD deep learning architecture have been used to detect cherry tomatoes.
    The SSD utilized VGG16 as its base network, with multiple layers appended to its
    tail end. During the training process, both the image and its associated Ground-Truth
    Box were simultaneously fed into the system. Following this, each feature map
    across 6 layers generated a default box set, as well as the confidence of object
    category within the box. FIGURE 11. Classical SSD deep learning network architecture
    based on VGG-16. Source: [82]. Show All Another prevalent deep learning model
    used for sequential data is the recurrent neural network (RNN). This model excels
    in predicting prices [83], processing natural languages [84], recognizing speech
    [85], among other applications [86], [87]. An RNN’s unique attribute is its ability
    to retain previous data, which influences current outputs. Figure 12 demonstrates
    the basic architecture of the RNN applied to fruit quality assessment, illustrating
    how prior outputs serve as inputs due to the presence of the hidden layer. This
    layer effectively acts as a memory cell, ensuring every prior result informs the
    subsequent iteration. Consequently, each unit within the hidden layer is termed
    a recurrent cell. FIGURE 12. Architecture of RNN used for fruit quality assessment.
    Source: [88]. Show All Image segmentation tasks also benefited from deep learning
    techniques. The R-CNN method, for instance, combines CNNs with region proposals
    for object detection. Currently, Mask R-CNN leads the segmentation task, adding
    a branch to the Faster R-CNN for precise, high-quality segmentation mask generation
    for each region of interest. We already covered this in the previous section.
    There are many other neural network architectures that have been applied in the
    realm of deep learning. These include the Single Shot Multibox Detection (SSD),
    Long Short-Term Memory networks (LSTM), the “You Only Look Once” (YOLO), Region-based
    CNN (R-CNN), Fast R-CNN, and its successor, the Faster R-CNN etc. Beyond RGB imagery,
    these structures also support varied data formats, including videos, hyperspectral
    visuals, and spectral datasets. Moreover, for ease of reference, we have compiled
    a summary of the models reviewed. This includes details such as the year of development,
    key concepts, and links to source code or third-party implementation if available
    (See Table 2). Furthermore, to assess the effectiveness of these neural networks,
    various evaluation metrics have been used. Here are some commonly utilized metrics
    in the studies we have reviewed: Classification Accuracy (CA): This metric calculates
    the ratio of accurately identified images or classes to the overall number of
    images or classes. For problems involving multiple classes, the CA is computed

    TABLE 2 Summary of Major CNN Architectures SECTION IV. Deep Learning Assisted
    Computer Vision Applications in Greenhouse Farming The integration of deep learning-assisted
    computer vision techniques into greenhouse environments has produced promising
    results, indicating significant effectiveness. Deep learning-enhanced computer
    vision has a wide range of applications within the greenhouse industry, including
    recognition and classification of crops, crop yield estimation, crop quality inspection,
    crop growth monitoring, automatic harvesting, disease and pest management and
    so on. A small taxonomy of these applications is illustrated in figure 13. In
    this section of this paper, we explore the specific problems addressed in academic
    literature across these application areas. We investigate various computer vision
    techniques, models and architectures that have been utilized, the performance
    of the model adopted, discuss the underlying constraints and challenges, and offer
    insights to guide future research endeavors. FIGURE 13. Taxonomy of computer vision
    applications in greenhouse farming. Show All A. Crop Growth Monitoring Ensuring
    the healthy growth of crops is essential in greenhouse farming in order to achieve
    optimal yield, quality, and efficient use of resources, all of which contribute
    to profitable outcomes in agricultural production. Crops require a variety of
    nutrient elements, including macronutrients, secondary nutrients, and micronutrients,
    for optimal growth. Traditionally, monitoring crops has always relied heavily
    on human observations, which frequently leads to inaccurate and delayed results.
    Precision agriculture, especially in controlled environments like greenhouses,
    emphasizes the importance of consistent and accurate crop monitoring at varied
    growth stages. By integrating computer vision into greenhouse management, we can
    achieve real-time, precise monitoring. It provides timely interventions for optimal
    growth by detecting minute changes in crop health due to nutritional deficiencies
    far earlier than manual inspections. Utilizing innovative technologies to enhance
    agricultural processes, especially in the realm of greenhouse farming, is increasingly
    prevalent. Lee et al. [92] embarked on an exploration using clip-type Internet
    of Things (IoT) cameras to monitor tomato growth in a greenhouse setting, using
    deep learning-based object detection to track flower blooming and immature fruit
    development. By integrating the flower’s bloom date with temperature forecasting,
    their system could predict harvest dates with an average error of two days. While
    the clip-type design effectively addressed challenges like plant overlap in densely
    populated greenhouses, reliance on wired power sources and occasional occlusions
    posed limitations. The introduction of battery-powered IoT cameras and more adaptive
    positioning might enhance its applicability. In a different study, Gang et al.
    [93] implemented a convolutional neural network (CNN)-based model to estimate
    growth indices for greenhouse lettuce, utilizing RGB-D data from stereo cameras.
    Their dual-stage CNN architecture, building upon the ResNet50V2 layers, demonstrated
    remarkable accuracy. Similarly, Zhang et al. [94] showcased the capabilities of
    convolutional neural networks in relation to digital images. The study demonstrated
    how CNN can be useful in monitoring growth indicators like leaf fresh weight,
    leaf area, and leaf dry weight, delivering results that outperform traditional
    methodologies, especially for specific lettuce cultivars. However, while these
    models can extract depth information to enhance accuracy, their real-time application
    demands considerable computational power. Nevertheless, the speed of image processing,
    particularly with edge devices like Jetson SUB mini-PC, implies a potential future
    in real-time monitoring. The growing field of computer vision and deep learning
    has opened up new possibilities in crop management. Pre-trained models like YOLO,
    ResNet, VGG16, MobileNet, Detectron2, etc., have showcased remarkable capabilities
    in object detection. Integrating these advanced techniques into horticultural
    research has yielded impressive performance and opened avenues for innovative
    applications. For instance, Moysiadis et al. [95] highlighted the potential of
    using the YOLOv5 pre-trained model for mushroom growth monitoring. The complexities
    of mushroom growth patterns raise the significance of this research. However,
    the accuracy of detection underscores the challenges of using computer vision
    in dense environments with overlapping objects. Similarly, in a recent study,
    Shinoda et al. [96] introduced the “RoseTracker”, a system that combines YOLOv5,
    SORT, and a regression model aimed at monitoring the growth of roses in cultivation
    environments. The dataset they provided stands out due to its specific focus on
    the unique stages of rose growth. Though the results demonstrate remarkable accuracy,
    the system’s adaptability across diverse global cultivation conditions and its
    versatility with other floral species will be crucial factors in determining its
    broader acceptance and utility. These examples of applying deep learning-based
    computer vision to greenhouse crops demonstrate its utilization for various aspects
    of research and production, including species classification, organ detection,
    growth stage monitoring, and localization. Studies have implemented techniques
    like convolutional neural networks, YOLO, and other object detection models to
    track developmental indicators and phases precisely. While occlusion and adaptability
    across diverse environments remain challenges, deep learning enables real-time,
    accurate crop monitoring to support data-driven decision-making for optimal yields,
    quality, and resource efficiency in greenhouse farming. The technology displays
    remarkable potential in replacing time-consuming and imprecise manual inspection.
    Overall, deep learning-based computer vision facilitates timely, precise interventions
    for optimal greenhouse crop growth by detecting growth changes earlier than humanly
    possible. Further technological advances could transform greenhouse management
    and contribute to more sustainable, productive agricultural practices. Some of
    the studies in this area are precisely summarized in table 3 TABLE 3 Summary of
    Vision-Based Crop Growth Monitoring Studies B. Recognition and Classification
    of Crops Automated recognition and classification of greenhouse crops is a challenging
    task due to the vast diversity and continuous evolution of plant species. Moreover,
    crops can undergo various mutations, leading to significant variations within
    a single class. As a result, flowers from different species may share similar
    features such as shape, colour, and general appearance. Therefore, the recognition
    and classification of greenhouse crops presents a complex challenge with multi-class
    problems. Although manual classification is possible, it is typically labour-intensive
    and prone to errors, particularly when handling large numbers of samples. Hence,
    the application of computer vision-based deep learning techniques for the purpose
    of identifying and classifying species or cultivars holds immense potential as
    a groundbreaking advancement in the field of smart agriculture and greenhouse
    farming, thanks to their outstanding speed and accurate recognition capabilities.
    In recent advancements, the adoption of deep learning-based computer vision techniques
    in the domain of greenhouse agriculture has witnessed notable developments, particularly
    when it comes to enhancing precision and efficiency. Chen et al. [97] attempted
    to resolve the challenge posed by the dense intertwining of cucumber canopy vines.
    By proposing an image recognition model based on an enhanced YOLOv5, they aimed
    to increase the accuracy of detecting cucumber canopy vine tops. Notably, they
    introduced the CA (Coordinate Attention) mechanism module and transitioned from
    GIOU to EIOU for loss regression, resulting in a commendable accuracy of 97.1%
    in recognizing cucumber canopy tops in varied conditions. While the methodology
    is outstanding, there is potential to further adapt it for broader agricultural
    applications, considering the dynamism of outdoor conditions that might affect
    accuracy. Islam et al. [98] addressed the complications in separating leaf pixels
    from backgrounds in thermal images due to factors like thermal radiation and greenhouse
    humidity. They proposed TheLNet270v1, achieving a remarkable 91% accuracy in distinguishing
    canopy pixels. This innovative approach underscores the capability of deep learning
    in analyzing thermal images within greenhouses. While the results are promising,
    it is essential to make sure the model works well with different pixel size and
    adapt to the diverse environmental shifts commonly observed in greenhouses. Zhou
    et al. [99] proposed an “improved Faster-RCNN” architecture to detect strawberries
    from ground-level RGB images. This mechanism not only aids in efficient harvesting
    but also plays a pivotal role in selecting high-yield strawberry varieties. Their
    method achieved a notable fruit extraction accuracy of 86%, which surpassed the
    three other methods tested. However, the complexity and environmental adaptability
    of these models still necessitate further research. Future work in this domain
    needs to address training complexity and refine models to ensure robustness across
    various environmental conditions. Cong et al. [100] innovatively incorporated
    the Swin Transformer attention mechanism into Mask RCNN, enhancing the model’s
    feature extraction capabilities. Their model efficiently segmented sweet peppers
    even in complex scenarios, such as varying lighting conditions, pepper overlaps,
    and leaf occlusions. Achieving an average FPS value of 5, their approach holds
    promise for real-time monitoring of sweet pepper growth. Nevertheless, there is
    still room for improvement, especially in terms of real-time performance (e.g.,
    inference speed), to make it more optimized and viable for large-scale practical
    applications, particularly in automated fruit-picking systems. In recent years,
    the automation of crop harvesting, specifically tomatoes, has gained considerable
    attention in agricultural robotics. Su et al. [101] targeted tomato maturity detection,
    an essential aspect for determining post-harvest logistics such as transportation
    and storage. Their SE-YOLOv3-MobileNetV1 model excelled in classifying tomatoes
    into four distinct maturity levels with an average precision value of 97.5%. The
    incorporation of the Squeeze-and-Excitation attention mechanism ensured accurate
    detection while keeping the model lightweight, an attribute essential for embedded
    development in robotic applications. However, despite the robustness of their
    model, additional progress is required to address the challenges posed by real-world
    circumstances, such as the mutual occlusion caused by leaves and fruits. Meanwhile,
    Yuan et al.’s [82] study focuses on detecting cherry tomatoes in a complex greenhouse
    setting. Considering the operational environment and the precision offered by
    deep learning, they chose the SSD model and further experimented with varying
    base networks and input sizes. Their results demonstrate significant improvements
    in automatic cherry tomato detection, with a fascinating 98.85% precision achieved
    using the Inception V2 network. However, the challenge of detecting side-grown
    tomatoes underscores the need to fine-tune the model for complex scenarios. Moreia
    et al. [102] highlighted the crucial step towards achieving fully automated robotic
    harvesting: the development of an accurate fruit detection system. They proposed
    a deep learning-based system using SSD MobileNet v2 and YOLOv4 models to detect
    tomatoes and introduced an innovative histogram-based HSV colour space model for
    classifying their ripening stage. Notably, YOLOv4 displayed an impressive performance
    in both detection and classification, with an impressive F1-Score of 85.81% in
    the detection task. Yet, challenges persisted in identifying the middle stages
    of ripening due to subtle colour variations. This underpins the importance of
    continual model refinement, especially when differentiating closely related classes.
    In another similar study, Mao et al. [103] strived to enhance the accuracy and
    practicality of cucumber detection in complex environments. They introduced a
    multi-path convolutional neural network (MPCNN) with colour component selection
    and a support vector machine (SVM). The methodology effectively identified the
    cucumber region by reducing the background interference and emphasizing the colour
    differences between the cucumber and its surroundings. This approach yielded satisfactory
    results, with over 90% pixels in cucumber images being accurately classified.
    However, it remains uncertain how this model would perform under different environmental
    conditions or with other cucumber varieties. These applications of deep learning-based
    computer vision for automated recognition and classification of greenhouse crops
    shows promising results, but also persisting challenges. Studies have utilized
    techniques like YOLO, Mask RCNN, Faster R-CNN, MobileNets, and Swin Transformers
    to accurately detect and classify various crop species, cultivars, and growth
    stages. The complexities of distinguishing between highly similar classes, handling
    occlusion, and adapting models across diverse environments and lighting conditions
    remain active research problems. However, deep learning methodologies have achieved
    remarkable accuracies surpassing traditional techniques. Continual refinement
    of models and architectures tailored to specific crops, growth conditions, and
    agricultural tasks is still needed for robust real-world performance. Table 4
    summarizes the technical details of the studies presented in this subsection.
    TABLE 4 Summary of Recognition and Classification of Crops C. Crop Disease Monitoring
    In agriculture, plant diseases always remain a major issue that causes significant
    losses in the world’s food production, particularly in controlled settings like
    greenhouses. It is severely affecting the yield and quality of agricultural products
    and has become a key concern in the development of global agriculture. Traditional
    identification methods, largely manual and guided by pathologists, often lack
    the desired speed and precision, making them unsuitable for the fast-paced requirements
    of modern agriculture. Therefore, the development of deep learning and computer
    vision presents a promising path toward fast and accurate disease recognition;
    however, environmental factors such as different lighting and leaf occlusion continue
    to be ongoing challenges that researchers work to overcome in the area of greenhouse
    disease monitoring. At present, advances in imaging technology have led to the
    creation of several open-source image datasets featuring various horticultural
    crops. Notable datasets include ImageNet, PlantVillage, and OUFD. These collections
    have significantly improved the accuracy of image classification and recognition.
    Such large-scale image datasets are extensively used, offering plenty of feature
    information for training deep neural network models in horticultural research.
    With PlantVillage(https://www.tensorflow.org/datasets/catalog/plant_village),
    Wspanialy et al. [104] explored diseases affecting tomato leaves and highlighted
    the importance of automated disease detection because of its cost-effective implications.
    Their system can identify various tomato leaf diseases and evaluate their severity.
    While the method showed the potential to detect previously unseen diseases and
    yielded severity estimations comparable to human assessments, biases in the dataset,
    especially concerning the background, could limit its real-world applicability.
    Future efforts should concentrate on diversifying datasets to ensure the development
    of more generalized and robust models. Similarly, using the PlantVillage dataset,
    Restrepo-Arias et al. [105] introduced a novel diagnostic approach that highlights
    the impact of genotypic and phenotypic characteristics on how plants respond to
    pathogens. Their method, which emphasizes texture-based features and uses Bayesian
    Optimization to train artificial neural networks, achieved an impressive accuracy
    of up to 96.31% with MobileNet. This method’s emphasis on textural features shows
    promise, potentially reducing biases arising from leaf morphology. However, exploring
    more plant datasets and, experimenting with different image sizes, not relying
    solely on texture, and considering various features might enhance its classification
    accuracy and broaden its applicability. Despite the widespread use of open-source
    datasets like PlantVillage, crop recognition systems are still in the development
    stage and have not been established on a large scale. As a result, most researchers
    prefer to experiment with their own collected image sets. Zhao et al. [106] collected
    images of healthy and diseased strawberry varieties to build their dataset. They
    introduced a modified Faster RCNN architecture, emphasizing multiscale feature
    fusion. Achieving a commendable mAP of 92.18%, their method stands out for its
    efficiency and accuracy. Still, continuous refinement of their model is required
    for its adaptability across a broader spectrum of strawberry diseases. Xu et al.
    [107] addressed the challenge of melon leaf disease detection using an innovatively
    pruned version of YOLO v5s combined with ShufeNet v2. Their strategy achieved
    an impressive 95.7% mAP@0.5. By focusing on smaller disease features, they achieved
    real-time detection in intricate greenhouse environments. The model’s speed and
    efficiency, with an inference time of just 13.8 ms, are noteworthy. Their work
    underscores the power of leveraging refined neural networks for specific tasks,
    though the expansion to other crops will determine its broader relevance. Zhang
    et al. [108] employed the EfficientNet-B4 model to identify diseases in cucumber
    leaves, achieving an impressive 97% accuracy. However, external factors like lighting
    introduced challenges in distinguishing similar diseases. While their approach
    offers promise for real-time greenhouse monitoring, addressing environmental variables
    and optimizing for different devices, remain crucial for broader applicability.
    Zhang et al. [109] utilized color and color-infrared (CIR) images to diagnose
    wheat diseases like leaf rust and tan spots. Employing deep features extracted
    through the ResNet101 model, their approach achieved notable accuracies up to
    84%. While their approach maximizes the advantages of automated image analysis
    over manual observation, the deep-learning model’s supremacy in capturing finer
    features stands out, making it a promising direction for further advancements
    in disease detection. These investigations show that deep-learning models, particularly
    when trained on comprehensive image datasets, offer substantial promise in timely
    and accurately detecting plant diseases in controlled environments like greenhouses.
    The fusion of computer vision and advanced imaging technology has shown the potential
    to revolutionize traditional agricultural monitoring practices. A detailed summary
    of the techniques and their respective performances in the discussed research
    can be found in table 5. TABLE 5 Summary of Greenhouse Crop Disease Monitoring
    D. Automatic Harvesting Historically, the agricultural landscape was dominated
    by manual and labor-intensive processes, leading to increased costs and limitations
    in efficiency. The recent advent and integration of computer vision technology
    have marked a significant agricultural transformation. Today, the use of advanced
    technology in the form of intelligent harvesters equipped with vision-based robotics
    is on the rise. Groundbreaking research in this area has reshaped the paradigms
    of contemporary agricultural production, both investigating and implementing these
    technological advancements. For instance, Rong et al. [110]’s exploration into
    robotic harvesting of greenhouse tomatoes sheds light on the current technological
    challenges in replicating the efficiency and accuracy of manual harvesting. They
    proposed an advanced system to accurately identify tomato positions and determine
    the best grasping technique. By integrating a YOLOv5m-based detection mechanism,
    they achieved impressive recognition accuracies of 90.2% for tomato bunches and
    97.3% for individual fruits. However, while their optimized strategies reduced
    collision impacts on the manipulator’s grasp, yielding a promising harvesting
    success rate of 72.1%, their average harvesting time of 14.6 seconds per fruit
    still underscores the need for speed improvements. Similarly, Benavides et al.
    [111] attempted to automate tomato crop harvesting using a Computer Vision System
    (CVS), with a primary focus on the detection and localization of ripe tomatoes.
    By employing a myriad of digital image processing tools and basic trigonometry,
    the system successfully classified around 80.8% of beef tomatoes and 87.5% of
    cluster tomatoes as “collectible.” An outstanding achievement was the sub-millisecond
    processing time, a significant leap from previous methodologies. Despite the advancements,
    challenges persist in terms of ambient lighting conditions and the variability
    of the working environment, emphasizing the need for more adaptable and robust
    systems. A different study by Rong et al. [112] highlights the need for a fully
    automated mushroom harvesting robot. Their innovative robot system, employing
    Intel RealSense D435i for imaging and an improved SSD algorithm for detection,
    offers a promising mushroom recognition success rate of 95%. The system’s robustness
    is further evidenced by an admirable harvesting success rate of 86.8% within an
    average time of 8.85 seconds per mushroom. However, their initial approach to
    mushroom recognition faced challenges with varying illumination, adhesion intricacies,
    and posture identification, underscoring the need for deep learning models with
    more sophisticated recognition algorithms to effectively negotiate the intricacies
    involved in mushroom identification across diverse circumstances, hence enhancing
    the process. Nonetheless, the fragile nature of oyster mushrooms highlights the
    critical need for advancements in end-effector designs, ensuring minimal damage
    during the harvesting process. Recent innovations by Liu et al. [113] explored
    the application of the DA-Mask RCNN model for detecting green asparagus. The aim
    was to enhance detection precision during the autonomous harvesting of green asparagus
    by integrating MASK RCNN with depth information. The addition of the depth filter
    showed significant promise, especially under varying illumination conditions,
    achieving precision values of up to 0.993. While the model demonstrated resilience
    against false positives in bright lighting, further optimization, particularly
    for nighttime scenarios, is crucial for broader applications. These studies underscore
    the transformative potential of combining computer vision with deep-learning models
    in reshaping harvesting practices. While significant advancements have been achieved,
    the interplay between accuracy and operational efficiency emerges as a central
    concern. Table 6 summarizes the technical details of the studies discussed in
    this subsection. TABLE 6 Summary of Greenhouse Automatic Harvesting Task E. Yield
    Estimation Yield estimation in agricultural production is pivotal for stakeholders
    across the spectrum—from farmers to agricultural enterprises. It aids in strategically
    navigating post-harvest operations, driving marketing initiatives, and optimizing
    resource allocation. While traditional techniques have dominated this space, there
    is an emergent reliance on cutting-edge computational methodologies. The intersection
    of computer vision and agriculture has seen innovative developments, particularly
    with the employment of deep learning models to address challenges like overlapping
    crops, dense vegetation, and varying light conditions specially in greenhouse
    setup. This synthesis of technology and agriculture brings new methodologies,
    delivering improved precision in predictions, even as complexities arise. Wang
    et al. [114] employed an improved version of the YOLOv3 deep learning model to
    estimate tomato yields in artificially lit plant factories (PFAL). By refining
    the traditional YOLO algorithm, they achieved a notable mean average precision
    (mAP) of 99.3%—a 2.7% improvement over the original YOLOv3. Notably, their approach
    excelled in distinguishing densely packed and obscured fruits, paving the way
    for real-time crop monitoring and dynamic yield estimation. However, challenges
    persist due to the complex lighting conditions in PFAL environment and similarities
    between green fruit and their surrounding vegetation. In another study, Maji et
    al. [115] investigated wheat yield estimation through SlypNet, a hybrid deep learning
    approach that combines Mask R-CNN and U-Net. This approach effectively captures
    wheat morphological features, attaining a high mAP of 97.57% in spike detection.
    The study underscored the technique’s resilience to natural field constraints
    like overlapping and varying resolution. Yet, while SlypNet proved excellence
    for its detection capabilities, it acknowledges the challenge in precisely estimating
    grain yield from spikelet counts. Further studies focused on investigating the
    intricate anatomical details of spikelets could potentially enhance the precision
    of yield prediction. The growth and development of generative organs in greenhouse
    plants are essential for both yield estimation and higher productivity. Given
    the challenges in the greenhouse environment, such as leaf and branch obstructions
    and the risk of duplicate counts, there is a pressing need for more efficient
    methods. Manual counting approaches are time-consuming and often marred by inaccuracies,
    highlighting the necessity for rapid and automated solutions. Egi et al. [116]
    addressed this need by innovatively incorporating a drone-based AI system to detect
    and count greenhouse tomatoes. Their emphasis was not limited to the fruits; they
    also targeted the flowers. Using the YOLO V5 and Deep Sort algorithms, their method
    showcased remarkable accuracies of 99% for green tomatoes and 85% for red tomatoes.
    Nonetheless, their approach faced challenges with flower detection, securing only
    a 50% accuracy. While their achievements are commendable, the potential inaccuracies
    from drone movements, combined with the shortcomings in flower detection, hint
    at areas for improvement. An expanded dataset could offer a potential solution.
    Zhou et al. [117] utilized an “Improved ResNet” deep learning model to segment
    accurately and grade broccoli heads in greenhouse conditions. Their method achieved
    an impressive accuracy of 0.896 for broccoli head segmentation, even in varied
    lighting conditions. While the model’s performance is notable, its dependency
    on controlled environments and data processing pipeline reliance on manual settings
    poses challenges for real-world applications. However, the potential integration
    of semi-supervised learning in future work indicates promising strides towards
    refining and optimizing crop yield estimation in greenhouse farming. From the
    discussed studies centered on yield estimation in agricultural settings, particularly
    in greenhouses, it becomes evident that the scientific community is making strides
    in leveraging advanced computational techniques. These pioneering methodologies,
    while exhibiting remarkable promise, also underscore the complexities of the greenhouse
    environment. Further investigation and advancement in these methods could potentially
    bring about a paradigm shift in the agricultural sector—including farmers and
    enterprises—strategize planting, harvesting, and marketing initiatives. Table
    7 provides more details about the complex technical aspects of the studies discussed
    here. TABLE 7 Summary of Greenhouse Yield Estimation F. Crop Health Analysis In
    the realm of greenhouse plant health analysis, advanced computer vision techniques
    have provided innovative solutions for the prompt detection of crop biotic and
    abiotic stresses, nutrient deficiencies, and water stress, ensuring superior plant
    quality. The ability to promptly identify biotic and abiotic stresses is imperative
    for effective greenhouse crop management and optimal plant health. While visual
    inspection is tedious and subjective, computer vision and spectral imaging offer
    great promise for automated, non-invasive assessment of crop condition. As Taha
    et al. [118] employed spectral analysis and machine learning models to estimate
    nutrient contents in aquaponically grown lettuce. Using the selected optimal wavelengths,
    they achieved commendable predictive accuracies ( R 2 ≥0.94 ), suggesting a potential
    automated solution for nutrient estimation in aquaponics. However, the real challenge
    lies in translating these lab-based experiments to real-world greenhouses where
    external factors can significantly impact spectral readings. Eshkabilov et al.
    [119] also employed hyperspectral imaging within the 400–1000 nm range to predict
    nutrient concentrations in lettuce cultivars using PLSR and PCA models, achieving
    high accuracy ( R 2 =0.784 -0.987) with laboratory measurements. However, while
    hyperspectral imaging holds promise, its implementation might be restrictive due
    to cost implications, especially for small-scale greenhouse farmers. RGB imaging
    has also been utilized for abiotic stress detection. Lak et al. [120] developed
    a classification algorithm using visible light images and MLP neural network modeling
    to detect water stress in greenhouse tomatoes. After optimizing with PCA, the
    technique achieved 83.3% accuracy in distinguishing normal and water-stressed
    plants using only RGB image features. Surprisingly, adding thermal imagery did
    not improve results. Similarly, Levanon et al. [121] utilized RGB and thermal
    imaging along with neural networks to predict water and nutrient stress in banana
    plantlets. The multi-modal data fusion approach enabled models to achieve high
    prediction accuracy of over 90% for four stress classes. However, the small sample
    size of 16 plants may limit generalization. Beyond abiotic factors, computer vision
    shows promise for biotic disease screening. Najafian et al. [122] introduced a
    large dataset of over 40,000 wheat kernel images to detect Fusarium damage using
    deep learning models like EfficientNet and ResNet. The semi-supervised approach
    reached F1 scores up to 84.29% for binary classification but was limited for multi-class
    tasks. Overall, the dataset provides a valuable benchmark, but more samples are
    needed. Janani et al. [123] proposed a unique method to identify nitrogen nutrient
    levels in groundnut leaves using the CNN-based HVN model, achieving a training
    accuracy of 95% and validation accuracy of 92%. Although their method highlighted
    the significance of leaf color in determining nitrogen concentration, they acknowledged
    potential inaccuracies stemming from external factors unrelated to nitrogen levels.
    Such nuances emphasize the importance of considering all potential variables in
    crop health prediction. Overall, these studies demonstrate that computer vision
    and spectroscopy can enable automated, non-destructive monitoring of multiple
    crop health indicators. However, translating these technologies into commercial
    systems will require more robust models that fuse multi-modal data to overcome
    environmental noise, larger datasets to improve generalizability, and model optimization
    to account for subtleties between stress symptoms and normal variations. Table
    8 provides more details about the complex technical aspects of the studies discussed
    here. TABLE 8 Summary of Greenhouse Crop Health Analysis G. Pest and Insect Monitoring
    Monitoring pests and insects in greenhouses has always been a primary concern
    for sustainable agriculture, impacting both the quality and quantity of yield.
    It has now become an exciting field in the agricultural domain, emphasizing the
    critical need for precise, real-time solutions. Traditional methods have shown
    limitations in accuracy and response time. Consequently, computer vision and deep
    learning, particularly convolutional neural networks (CNNs), are being increasingly
    explored to identify pests like whiteflies and thrips, aiming to streamline and
    improve the detection process in greenhouse environments. Traditionally, farmers
    manually sample, count, and identify pests, a time-consuming and error-prone process.
    The integration of computer vision presents a more effective and accurate alternative,
    and a wide range of research is exploring its possibilities in the context of
    integrated pest management (IPM) [124], [125], [126], [127], [128], [129], [130],
    [131]. In a recent study, Liu et al. [129] investigated real-time pest detection
    on crops using advanced computer vision and deep learning. By adopting convolutional
    neural networks (CNNs) and generating a virtual database for training, they achieved
    an impressive 97.8% detection accuracy for various invertebrate pests on crops.
    In the future, utilizing multispectral or hyperspectral imaging may make it possible
    to identify well-camouflaged pests. Furthermore, the development of ground-based
    robotic system capable of performing real-time proximal detection of invertebrate
    pests could be the future of pest management. Yang et al. [128] focused their
    research on identifying greenhouse pests, especially whiteflies and thrips, using
    image processing. Their novel method employed dual color spaces(HIS and Lab) combined
    with advanced ensemble learning classifiers, resulting in a commendable 95.73%
    recognition accuracy. While this approach substantially minimized manual intervention,
    the study underscores the challenge of uniformly illuminating complex greenhouse
    environments, possibly impacting accuracy in varied scenarios. Despite this success,
    there is still room for improvement. The system could be more optimized by reducing
    the number of false positive detections. Moreover, extending the system’s capability
    to a broader range of environments beyond greenhouses is on the horizon. On a
    similar note, Li et al. [131] also conducted research on detecting whitefly and
    thrips from sticky trap images using a deep learning model, ‘TPest-RCNN’, based
    on the Faster R-CNN. This model, fine-tuned for small insect detection, showed
    excellent precision with a mAP of 0.95. While the results were promising, challenges
    like diverse pest densities and lighting conditions remain. However, their approach
    sets a robust groundwork for real-time monitoring, which can significantly aid
    timely interventions. In a distinctive approach, Zhao et al. [130] tackled pest
    detection in Brassica chinensis through images captured by unmanned aerial vehicles
    (UAV). Given the challenges of aerial imagery such as image blur and small object
    sizes, their strategy leveraged deep learning combined with improved CenterNet
    algorithms, realizing a detection performance of up to 94.7% R-squared. Despite
    its potential, aerial imagery’s inherent issues, like blurring, could affect its
    widespread adaptability unless integrated with superior quality cameras or advanced
    image restoration techniques. In a different study, Lins et al. [127] addressed
    the task of automating the counting and classification of aphids, particularly
    Rhopalosiphum padi, using a software named ‘AphidCV’. This software, rooted in
    computer vision and machine learning, not only expedited the counting process
    but also introduced morphometry data. While its prowess is undoubted, some limitations
    in classifying winged aphids were evident. Diversifying the training dataset,
    perhaps with data augmentation techniques, could be beneficial. This solution
    holds promise for its extension to other aphid species and direct application
    in field-based pest management, reducing reliance on labor-intensive manual methods.
    Given the advancements detailed above, computer vision, particularly when coupled
    with deep learning methodologies like CNNs, showcases transformative potential
    in the realm of greenhouse pest detection and management. Nevertheless, as research
    progresses, it is imperative to address inherent challenges, such as diverse pest
    densities and varied lighting conditions, to ensure consistent, real-time accuracy.
    Embracing multi-modal data fusion, hyperspectral imaging, and more extensive datasets
    can further amplify the precision and reliability of these systems within greenhouse
    environments. Table 9 details the technical aspects of the discussed studies.
    TABLE 9 Summary of Greenhouse Pest and Insect Management H. Greenhouse Crop Quality
    Inspection The quality control and grading of agricultural commodities is essential
    for determining their market value, safety, and appeal to consumers [132]. Manual
    inspection, however, can be inconsistent, labor-intensive, and unscalable for
    large-scale production. The integration of computer vision and artificial intelligence
    has unlocked exciting new possibilities for automated, non-destructive, and real-time
    assessment of horticultural produce quality [133], [134], [135], [136], [137].
    As explored by Tan et al. [134], deep convolutional neural networks demonstrated
    high accuracy (mean average precision of 95.52%) in classifying the maturity of
    tomatoes based on color features extracted from images. The use of task-specific
    architectures like Mask-RCNN allowed precise segmentation and localization of
    the produce within complex backgrounds. However, the model training time of 6
    hours indicates room for optimization in computational efficiency for real-time
    adoption. Beyond maturity, quality parameters like pest/disease damage, ripeness,
    and shelf-life have also been automated using imaging techniques. For instance,
    Hendrawan et al. [135] developed a convolutional neural network model to categorize
    large green chili peppers into three maturity classes with 91.27% accuracy. The
    model shows promise for rapid, objective maturity grading to standardize quality.
    However, classification accuracy was lower for immature peppers, warranting further
    research into data augmentation and transfer learning to improve model robustness.
    In another study, Shi et al. [136] combined deep learning and causal analysis
    to predict maturity dates of leafy greens in greenhouses, achieving a root mean
    squared error of only 2.49 days. While novel, the approach struggled with crops
    in late static growth stages, suggesting the need for adaptive models that emphasize
    historical data over static phenotypes in late stages. Wei et al. [137] developed
    a model using grape skin color analysis and a backpropagation neural network to
    predict the maturity of greenhouse-grown grapes, achieving up to 79.4% accuracy.
    A two-factor color model performed better than single-color predictors. However,
    prediction accuracy varied between grape varieties depending on color changes
    during ripening. Custom varietal models or adaptive techniques may further improve
    prediction. Zhu et al. [133] proposed a computer vision approach using YOLOv5
    and OpenCV to grade mushrooms in greenhouses based on size features automatically.
    The model achieved 96% accuracy in identifying and measuring occluded mushrooms
    under varying illumination. However, further work is needed to optimize mushroom
    recognition speed and expand functionality for tasks like robotic spraying. Nyalala
    et al. [138] presented a technique using machine learning and image processing
    to estimate the weight and volume of tomatoes on a simulated greenhouse conveyor
    system. Occluded tomatoes were segmented using polygon approximation before extraction
    of shape features. The best models achieved high correlation with reference measurements,
    demonstrating feasibility for in-line, non-destructive quality screening. Nonetheless,
    additional testing is required across diverse tomato varieties and shape features.
    The studies presented highlight the immense potential of computer vision and AI
    techniques to automate the quality assessment of greenhouse-grown horticulture
    produce. Advanced models have enabled non-destructive evaluation of multiple quality
    traits, from external features like pest/disease damage and maturity to internal
    parameters like texture and shelf-life. However, enhancements in model versatility,
    accuracy, and computational efficiency are needed to account for the diversity
    of greenhouse varieties and environments. Current systems also have limited real-world
    testing beyond controlled settings. Expanding datasets, integrating multi-modal
    sensor inputs, and optimizing deep learning architectures tailored for greenhouse
    conditions will be critical next steps. While research is still progressing, computer
    vision and AI solutions promise to transform quality control practices for greenhouse
    horticulture. Automated, real-time quality grading and defect detection could
    provide invaluable objective data to support selective harvesting, packing, pricing,
    and sales for greenhouse produce. Overall, these emerging technologies are poised
    to enhance productivity, reduce waste, and add value to the competitive greenhouse
    industry. Table 10 presents the technical details of several studies conducted
    in this area. TABLE 10 Summary of Greenhouse Crop Quality Inspection I. Seed Quality
    Analysis Seeds are crucial to modern agriculture, determining both food supply
    and crop yield [118]. Traditional manual assessments of seed quality, while essential,
    are laborious and prone to inaccuracies. The commercial seed industry is now leaning
    into computer vision technology, tapping into its potential to extract seed features
    with precision. With the rapid advancement of various imaging techniques, enhanced
    by deep learning, this technology sets new benchmarks for seed quality evaluation
    in greenhouse settings [140], [141], [142], [143], [144], [145]. For example,
    Medeiros et al. [141] investigated the application of Convolutional Neural Networks
    (CNN) with X-ray imagery to determine crambe seed quality. Their deep learning
    models robustly categorized seeds based on their tissue integrity, germination,
    and vigor with impressive accuracies of 91%, 95%, and 82%, respectively. This
    substantiates the vast potential of X-ray imagery in furnishing critical insights
    into the physical and physiological attributes of seeds. However, a lingering
    concern is the reliance on digital radiographic images, which, while powerful,
    might not capture the complete essence of seed vitality in diverse scenarios.
    On a similar note, Hong et al. [142] employed a combination of hyperspectral and
    X-ray imaging techniques for a nondestructive viability prediction of pepper seeds.
    The ensemble-based fusion model, integrating both hyperspectral and X-ray data,
    stood out with an accuracy of 92.51%. This approach demonstrates that combining
    different imaging modalities can produce more accurate categorization results.
    Nonetheless, the research’s dependency on just two pepper-seed cultivars may demand
    broader experimental validations for holistic reliability across varied conditions.
    In a different study, Lube et al. [143] introduced the MultipleXLab system: a
    flexible platform for monitoring seed germination and root growth. Using deep
    learning methodologies, they showcased the system’s capability to screen seed
    vigor and evaluate seedling responses under varied conditions. The system, however,
    presents two key challenges: its restricted experimental duration due to agar
    dehydration and a potential light deprivation issue for seeds placed in specific
    positions. Overcoming these limitations could elevate its utility. Gao et al.
    [144] presented an innovative end-to-end platform named HyperSeed, which is adept
    at providing hyperspectral information specifically for seeds. Their application
    on rice seeds using a 3D convolutional neural network (3D CNN) outperformed traditional
    methods like the support vector machine (SVM) model, boasting an impressive 97.5%
    accuracy. Nevertheless, the system is constrained by its single-threaded software
    nature and demands exploration of global spatial traits, hinting towards potential
    future advancements. On the other hand, Sabanci et al. [140] conducted a study
    to distinguish between tomato seed cultivars, employing a multi-tier deep learning
    approach. They initially utilized convolutional neural network (CNN) models for
    seed image classification, with MobileNetv2 showcasing the highest efficacy. Furthermore,
    they leveraged deep features from this model to feed a Bidirectional Long Short-Term
    Memory (BiLSTM) network, pushing the classification accuracy to a notable 96.09%.
    Despite the promising results, the study underscores the importance of diverse
    datasets for model robustness and suggests hyperparameter optimization to enhance
    performance. To synthesize, while computer vision technologies are profoundly
    redefining seed quality assessments in greenhouse farming, there remains an imperative
    for further refinements to harness their full potential. Such tools, when impeccably
    optimized, can provide real-time and nondestructive solutions to the complexities
    of seed quality evaluation in the modern agricultural landscape. Table 11 provides
    a concise summary of several studies conducted in this field. TABLE 11 Summary
    of Greenhouse Seed Quality Analysis J. Weed Management Weed management poses a
    significant challenge in contemporary agriculture, as weeds compete with crops
    for vital resources such as light, water, nutrients, and space. Weeds are a primary
    factor behind agricultural yield losses. Study [146] highlighted that weeds account
    for about 34% of yield losses, substantially more than losses from pests (18%)
    or pathogens (16%). Recently, the agriculture sector has seen a growing interest
    in integrating modern weed management techniques with computer vision. Extensive
    research has been carried out using these cutting-edge technologies to control
    and manage weed growth in greenhouses. In one study, Koparan et al. [147] emphasized
    the role of image background in deep learning models for weed detection. The study
    applied advanced architectures like VGG16 and ResNet50, highlighting a decrease
    in model accuracy when transitioning from a uniform to a non-uniform background
    and vice versa. However, when combined data sets from both backgrounds were used,
    the performance surged to nearly 99%. Despite their rigorous approach, the limitations
    lie in the model’s dependency on the image backgrounds, underscoring the need
    for more diverse training data. This could enhance the model’s adaptability across
    varying environmental conditions. In another study, Wang et al. [148] underscored
    the challenges posed by the limited availability of weed datasets in the field.
    The study introduced “Weed25”, a dataset encapsulating images of 25 weed species
    and utilized state-of-the-art models like YOLOv3, YOLOv5, and Faster R-CNN to
    achieve impressive accuracy rates hovering around 92%. However, the research confines
    its scope to only 25 species, leaving room for the inclusion of more diverse weed
    types, which could lead to further refinement of models tailored for precision
    in greenhouse weed management. Oda et al. [149] developed a multispectral camera
    system specifically for recognizing weeds within crops. Their findings revealed
    that the infrared band was more precise than other bands, highlighting its importance
    in plant detection. This affirms the potential of combining computer vision with
    multispectral imaging in enhancing post-emergence herbicide applications. Nonetheless,
    challenges persist, including the influence of leaf overlap and varied light intensities
    on detection accuracy. Addressing these challenges head-on could pave the way
    for more robust and accurate weed detection models. Koparan et al. [150] examined
    the role of site-specific weed management using RGB image texture features. Their
    methodology compared the Support Vector Machine (SVM) and the deep learning-based
    VGG16 models. Remarkably, their deep learning approach, specifically the VGG16
    model, showcased an impressive f1-score value of 100% for corn classification,
    which is a breakthrough for the corn crop production system. While their method
    holds potential, one must consider the vast variability of crops and regions.
    A significant highlight of their work is the effectiveness of VGG16 in identifying
    weeds in the presence of various crops, elucidating the intricacies of weed-crop
    dynamics in precision agriculture. In a different study, Rai et al. [151] deployed
    deep learning models on edge devices, aiming to detect weeds through aerial imagery.
    By comparing both heavyweight and lightweight deep learning models, they showed
    that lightweight models, specifically CSPMobileNet-v2 and YOLOv4-lite, achieved
    a mean average precision(mAP) of 83.2% and 82.2%, respectively. Their approach
    offers real-time detection with commendable accuracy but, critically, must be
    scrutinized for potential hardware biases and storage challenges, especially with
    high-resolution aerial data. The flexibility offered by edge computing cannot
    be ignored; however, securing these devices remains a pertinent concern. Drawing
    insights from those studies, it is evident that integrating computer vision techniques
    holds immense potential for refining greenhouse weed management. However, achieving
    precision remains a formidable challenge. Diverse data sources, enhanced models,
    and advanced imaging techniques may collectively steer the future of this realm,
    allowing for more sustainable and efficient weed control in greenhouses. A brief
    overview of different studies in this area, along with their technical details,
    can be found in Table 12. TABLE 12 Summary of Greenhouse Weed Management SECTION
    V. Critical Challenges Faced by Computer Vision Technology in Smart Greenhouse
    Operations and the Way Out While computer vision has shown immense potential across
    various greenhouse applications, as highlighted in this review, significant challenges
    must be addressed for effective real-world deployment. A. Lack of Large-Scale
    Standardized Datasets A major limitation identified is the shortage of large-scale
    standardized image datasets for the greenhouse domain (as noted in [66], [102],
    [105]). Most studies rely on small proprietary datasets collected by the researchers
    themselves, often just a few hundred images, which restricts generalization of
    techniques ([93], [98], [107]). There is a need to establish extensive public
    databases encapsulating the diversity of greenhouse environments, with variability
    in factors like lighting, humidity, crop types, growth stages, and imaging angles
    represented ([92], [95], [106]). Centralized repositories like PlantVillage offer
    a valuable start but have limited coverage and annotation complexity. Constructing
    large-scale greenhouse image datasets with standard formatting and annotations
    will be critical to benchmark performance of computer vision techniques and fuel
    advancements ([94], [114], [115]). B. Need for Specialized and Optimized Models
    While deep neural networks have driven progress in many visual recognition tasks,
    off-the-shelf models pre-trained on open-field images fail to account for the
    unique intricacies of greenhouse environments ([96], [97], [105]). Networks designed
    for generic datasets do not transfer effectively to greenhouses, as the specialized
    appearance and growth patterns of crops in controlled settings are not represented
    ([99], [108], [109]). The frequent occlusion from dense foliage, glass surface
    reflections, condensation, extreme illumination fluctuations, and evolution of
    visual features across plant growth requires specialized model architectures and
    training strategies ([95], [100], [114]). For instance, Li et al. [97] found that
    directly applying YOLOv3 for cucumber canopy recognition resulted in insufficient
    accuracy, requiring an enhanced model with additional coordinate attention modules.
    Xu et al. [107] showed that extensive pruning and adaptation of YOLOv5s was needed
    for effective real-time melon disease detection in greenhouses. Rong et al. [110]
    demonstrated that off-the-shelf YOLOv5 had difficulties recognizing occluded tomato
    bunches, needing optimization of the loss function and model architecture. These
    studies underscore the need to tailor base models to address nuances like occlusion,
    illumination variation, and growth patterns unique to greenhouse environments.
    Beyond architectures, the training process must also account for greenhouse-specific
    factors. Models like those proposed by Cong et al. [100], Gang et al. [93], and
    Liu et al. [113] illustrate the benefits of customized training regimes using
    specialized greenhouse datasets over pre-trained networks. However, collecting
    exhaustive labelled greenhouse data can be challenging. Recent work by Moysiadis
    et al. [95] demonstrates the potential of simulated or synthetically augmented
    data for greenhouse model training. Such emerging data-centric solutions must
    be explored in combination with adapted model architectures. Overall, while deep
    learning has shown immense potential, realizing robust computer vision for greenhouses
    will require specialized model architectures and training techniques tailored
    to the unique intricacies of controlled environments ([92], [94], [98]). Greenhouse-specific
    networks, re-training regimes, augmented data, and continual optimization will
    be instrumental in developing computer vision solutions adept at the nuances of
    greenhouse conditions. C. Constraints in Computational Resources Many state-of-the-art
    techniques like Mask R-CNN are computationally intensive, making real-time deployment
    difficult given the constrained resources of embedded greenhouse systems ([111],
    [114]). Hardware devices in agricultural settings often have tight power budgets,
    restricting the complexity of models that can be run ([93], [116]). While cloud-based
    solutions can provide greater parallel processing power, sole reliance on the
    cloud introduces drawbacks like network latency, connectivity dependencies, and
    data privacy concerns. A balanced approach could be edge-cloud co-design, with
    lightweight models handling core functionality on-device while leveraging the
    cloud for more intensive computations. Still, optimizing models and inference
    pipelines for efficient execution on low-power devices remains a key challenge
    ([112], [117]). Research on extremely lightweight yet accurate architectures specialized
    for greenhouse conditions is imperative. D. Limited Integration of Diverse Sensing
    Modalities While most research relies solely on RGB images, other sensing modalities
    like hyperspectral imaging can provide valuable crop insights ([118], [119], [120]).
    However, techniques to integrate and fuse multi-modal data sources are still emergent.
    Capturing relationships between RGB, spectral, depth, thermal, and other data
    could significantly enhance model robustness and performance ([121], [122]). Developing
    sensor fusion methods and tailored multi-modal networks is an open research frontier.
    E. Shortage of Specialized and Interdisciplinary Talent The effective development
    and implementation of computer vision technologies for greenhouses require skilled
    professionals spanning multiple disciplines ([14], [103], [104], [105]). Emerging
    deep learning solutions rely heavily on the parallel computing capabilities of
    GPUs ([64]). To fully leverage these tools requires both computer vision and agriculture
    expertise ([93], [114]). However, there is a talent shortage with competencies
    and experience across these domains ([97], [99]). Computer vision involves diverse
    fields like image processing, machine learning, and pattern recognition ([14]).
    Integrating techniques from these areas into the complexities of greenhouse farming
    demands specialized interdisciplinary knowledge ([95], [108]). From researchers
    advancing scientific innovations to technicians managing real-world deployment,
    skilled personnel able to bridge computer vision and agriculture are imperative
    but lacking ([100], [106]). Closing this talent gap across computer science and
    agricultural engineering is vital to drive progress. Initiatives to support education,
    training, and collaboration across disciplines are critical to develop professionals
    that can effectively apply computer vision to transform greenhouse agriculture.
    In summary, major challenges like lack of sufficient labeled data, need for task-specific
    models, computational constraints, and limited multi-modality demonstrate that
    significant work remains to develop computer vision techniques adept at the nuances
    of greenhouse environments. Substantial progress has been made, but overcoming
    these areas through data generation, model optimization, efficient designs, and
    sensor fusion integration will be essential to realize the full potential of computer
    vision for smart greenhouse agriculture. SECTION VI. Conclusion This paper presented
    a focused analysis of recent advancements in applying computer vision and deep
    learning for greenhouse agriculture automation. Spanning diverse application areas
    like crop monitoring, disease detection, yield forecasting, and quality analysis,
    over 100 studies were reviewed in detail. The innovations showcased offer glimpses
    into the transformative potential of data-driven intelligent solutions for optimizing
    productivity and sustainability in controlled environments. However, significant
    challenges remain that must be addressed before widespread adoption. The lack
    of large-scale standardized datasets restricts model generalization and limits
    performance benchmarking. Meanwhile, computational constraints of embedded systems
    pose bottlenecks for real-time deployment. There is also a need for more skilled
    talent with expertise across computer vision, deep learning, and agriculture.
    Most importantly, the uniqueness of greenhouse environments demands specialized,
    optimized techniques - off-the-shelf solutions pre-trained on open field data
    often fail to transfer effectively. Nonetheless, the progress made indicates that
    an exciting future lies ahead. Expanded collaborations for standardized dataset
    development, computational advancements in low-power devices, interdisciplinary
    training programs, and research on tailored solutions for greenhouses will be
    critical to drive the field forward. Computer vision and deep learning have already
    shown initial success in automation tasks like robotic harvesting and quality
    assessment. With continued innovation, they are poised to transform greenhouse
    infrastructure worldwide - enabling autonomous, efficient, data-driven systems
    that enhance productivity, resilience, and sustainability. This timely review
    provided a holistic synthesis of the state-of-the-art, analyzed key challenges,
    and outlined prospective directions. By condensing current work and elucidating
    future needs, it aims to motivate and guide ongoing research to unlock the full
    potential of AI and computer vision for next-generation smart greenhouse agriculture
    globally. The possibilities are boundless, and the opportunities endless. ACKNOWLEDGMENT

    of escalating global challenges such as population growth, climate change, and
    urbanization, the call to reimagine our agricultural and horticultural systems
    becomes more critical than ever. The shadow of these issues hovers ominously over
    future food security, intertwined with the sustainable usage of our dwindling
    natural resources [1]. Yet, in this realm of concerns, a beacon of promise emerges
    from technological advancements, holding the potential to revolutionize the agricultural
    and horticultural landscapes [2]. Our pursuit, therefore, centers on the strategic
    leverage of these cutting-edge technologies to create more sustainable, productive,
    and resilient farming ecosystems worldwide. Sustainable access to high-quality
    food is not just a predicament for developing countries; even developed nations
    are grappling with this issue. Current agricultural practices, conducted predominantly
    in open fields, are not sufficiently productive to meet the escalating demand.
    As the World Health Organization projects, food production will need to increase
    by 70% by 2050 to meet the needs of an estimated global population of 10 billion
    [3], about 7 billion of whom will be living in urban areas [4]. Thus, exploring
    alternative production systems becomes not just an option but a necessity to ensure
    a sustainable food supply chain.'

  description: Precision farming technologies have the potential to enhance agricultural
    sustainability, but their exact environmental impact remains uncertain. This study
    aimed to (1) compare the life cycle assessment (LCA) of a conventional five-year
    crop rotation system with and without precision agriculture technologies (PATs)
    in Lower Austria; (2) to assess the emission hotspots and (3) to perform a sensitivity
    analysis on fertilization using the DeNitrification-DeComposition (DNDC) soil
    model to quantifying soil emission. Evaluated PATs included automatic steering
    systems, automatic section control (ASC), proximal sensors, and prescription maps
    from remote sensors. The crop rotation system included spring barley, soy, winter
    wheat, rapeseed, and winter barley. Assessed agricultural processes encompassed
    tillage, seeding, plant protection, fertilization, and harvesting. The impacts
    evaluated were climate change, fine particulate matter formation, freshwater eutrophication,
    freshwater ecotoxicity, terrestrial acidification, terrestrial ecotoxicity, and
    human carcinogenic toxicity. The sensor scheme scenario showed the highest reductions
    in climate change, followed by the prescription map, ASC, and autosteer scheme
    with reductions of −17.0, −8.9, −6.4, and −2.4%, respectively. This study emphasizes
    the potential of PATs to minimize environmental impacts in crop production while
    recognizing the influence of site and technology-specific factors. Future research
    should consider local variables for a comprehensive environmental assessment.

  explanation: 'The study conducted a comparative life cycle assessment (LCA) to evaluate
    the environmental impacts of a conventional five-year crop rotation system, without
    and with implementation of precision agriculture technologies (PATs), for crop
    production in Austria. The research compared the following PATs: automatic steering,
    automatic section control (ASC), proximal sensors, and prescription maps created
    using remote sensors. The comparison aimed to determine the effectiveness of the
    technologies in reducing environmental impacts resulting from agricultural practices
    and identify areas for further refinement of LCA methodology in this domain.


    The research found that implementing PATs can have a positive impact on the environment
    by reducing the use of agricultural inputs (such as fertilizers and pesticides)
    and, therefore, reducing greenhouse gas emissions, energy consumption, and pollution.
    The study also highlighted areas of the LCA methodology that could be improved
    to provide more accurate and comprehensive assessments of the environmental impacts
    of agricultural systems.'

    • The environmental impacts of four precision agriculture technologies are assessed.
    • Life cycle assessment is used with the DeNitrification-DeComposition soil model.
    • Crop sensors, optimal in precision agriculture, cut global warming by −17.04%.
    • Precision farming effectiveness depends on site-and technology-specific factors.
    Abstract Precision farming technologies have the potential to enhance agricultural
    sustainability, but their exact environmental impact remains uncertain. This study
    aimed to (1) compare the life cycle assessment (LCA) of a conventional five-year
    crop rotation system with and without precision agriculture technologies (PATs)
    in Lower Austria; (2) to assess the emission hotspots and (3) to perform a sensitivity
    analysis on fertilization using the DeNitrification-DeComposition (DNDC) soil
    model to quantifying soil emission. Evaluated PATs included automatic steering
    systems, automatic section control (ASC), proximal sensors, and prescription maps
    from remote sensors. The crop rotation system included spring barley, soy, winter
    wheat, rapeseed, and winter barley. Assessed agricultural processes encompassed
    tillage, seeding, plant protection, fertilization, and harvesting. The impacts
    evaluated were climate change, fine particulate matter formation, freshwater eutrophication,
    freshwater ecotoxicity, terrestrial acidification, terrestrial ecotoxicity, and
    human carcinogenic toxicity. The sensor scheme scenario showed the highest reductions
    in climate change, followed by the prescription map, ASC, and autosteer scheme
    with reductions of −17.0, −8.9, −6.4, and −2.4%, respectively. This study emphasizes
    the potential of PATs to minimize environmental impacts in crop production while
    recognizing the influence of site and technology-specific factors. Future research
    should consider local variables for a comprehensive environmental assessment.

    (DNDC)Field emissions 1. Introduction Climate change tends to reduce arable land
    yield capacity (IPCC et al., 2022), while the demand for food production due to
    an increasing population and biofuel energy consumption is expected to increase
    50% by 2050 (FAO, 2018; OECD-FAO, 2021). Therefore, crop cultivation methods need
    to adapt to the effects of global warming by achieving higher yields, avoiding
    resource overconsumption, and minimizing environmental impacts. New technologies
    implemented in the field of precision agriculture (PA) support the idea of sustainable
    crop production. PA is a management practice that implements sensors and information
    technologies to optimize crop inputs based on temporal and spatial variability
    (Fountas et al., 2005). Schwarz et al. (2010) described a comprehensive typology
    definition for precision agricultural technologies (PATs). This classification
    includes guidance systems, recording technologies, and reacting technologies.
    Guidance systems are technologies that guide tractors and machinery implements
    during field operations. This type of PAT can act as driver assistance or be completely
    autonomous (Schwarz et al., 2010). Recording technologies use sensors to collect
    and extract field data before, during, and/or after crop production. Lastly, reacting
    technologies process the data collected by the recording technologies to minimize
    crop inputs without affecting optimal crop growth. PATs can be classified into
    one or a combination of two of these typologies (Balafoutis et al., 2017). Employing
    PATs for crop cultivation brings benefits such as reducing fuel consumption, agricultural
    inputs, labor time, human error, and driving fatigue. The benefits can vary depending
    on temporal and spatial factors, such as the cropping system, farm scale, technology
    and machinery employed, soil type, and local weather. (Ashworth et al., 2018).
    Guidance technologies, for example, reduce the overlapping application of inputs,
    machinery fuel consumption (Balafoutis et al., 2017), and soil compaction and
    erosion (Tullberg et al., 2007) by minimizing soil tillage resistance in the field
    (Fountas et al., 2010). However, studies differ in the amount of input reduction
    by this type of technology (Ashworth et al., 2018; Bora et al., 2012; Landerl,
    2009; Tullberg, 2014). In the case of recording and reacting technologies, both
    mechanisms are implemented simultaneously to reduce the overapplication of agricultural
    inputs. Recording technologies document site-specific data on pests, soil, water,
    and crop nutritional deficiencies using sensors; consequently, reacting technologies
    use these geolocation data to determine the variability of agricultural input
    rates across the field. Numerous studies have examined agricultural input reductions
    on variable rate nutrient application, particularly fertilizer application by
    using proximal and remote sensors. These sensors measure reflected radiation unabsorbed
    by plants using vegetation indices; healthy crops will reflect more near-infrared
    and green light. While proximal sensors measure vegetation indices near the plant,
    remote sensors measure it from a distance, for example, with satellites. Similar
    to other PAT-related studies the amount of resource reduction also differs while
    using these sensors. Existent literature shows a reduction in fertilizer use between
    1.6 and 82.0% using proximal sensors (Colaço and Bramley, 2018), whereas in the
    case of remote sensors these numbers vary between 6.0 and 50.0% (Colaço and Molin,
    2016; Guerrero et al., 2021; Guerrero and Mouazen, 2021; Koch et al., 2004). The
    majority of the studies assessing the benefits of PATs focus on the reduction
    of inputs for crop production without assessing relevant local and global environmental
    impacts. To quantify potential environmental impacts of agricultural systems (Garrigues
    et al., 2012) and new technologies the life cycle assessment (LCA) is nowadays
    a widely used method. It has already been applied in a few studies to assess the
    environmental effects of PATs in crop production, particularly in pesticide and
    fertilizer usage. Gasso et al. (2014) performed an LCA of control traffic farming
    (CTF) in Denmark and their results showed a reduction in all of the assessed impact
    categories. The reason for the positive outcomes was due to the overlap reductions
    by using auto-guidance, which in turn decreased the amount of fertilizer and pesticide
    use. In a recent study by Medel-Jiménez et al. (2022) the environmental impacts
    of using an optical crop sensor for variable rate nitrogen application (VRNA)
    for winter wheat production were quantified. The study showed an 8.6% reduction
    in the global warming potential (GWP) by using the sensor in the best of the scenarios.
    Li et al. (2016) performed an LCA on VRNA with a crop canopy reflectance sensor.
    Their results showed a reduction in the GWP, acidification potential, and eutrophication
    potential due to nitrogen (N) fertilizer reduction. The literature indicates the
    existence of studies that assess the reduction potential of agricultural inputs
    for crop production using PATs, as well as studies that employ the LCA methodology
    to examine the environmental impacts of individual PATs. However, there is a lack
    of LCA studies that simultaneously assess and compare the environmental impacts
    of various PATs, while considering the influence of the reduction potential of
    agricultural inputs on the results. Further, when using PATs, they indirectly
    influence the soil’s biogeochemical dynamics and its direct relation to field
    emissions. This is because less or more nutrients are applied into the soil, for
    example, nitrogen fertilizer. To quantify direct field emissions the majority
    of agricultural LCA studies use the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change
    (IPCC) tier I/II methodology (De Klein et al., 2006a). The Swiss Agricultural
    Life Cycle Assessment (SALCA) methodology (Gaillard and Nemecek, 2009), which
    is also utilized in the ecoinvent life cycle inventory (LCI) background databases
    (Wernet et al., 2016) is another widely used approach. However, the IPCC and the
    SALCA methodologies do not consider temporal and site-specific factors when quantifying
    soil fluxes, furthermore, they present a high degree of uncertainty. On the other
    hand, process-based models consider the interaction of temporal and spatial drivers
    – weather, soil composition, crop classification, etc. – agricultural management
    practices, and biogeochemical reactions when quantifying soil emissions. The DeNitrification-DeComposition
    (DNDC) (Li et al., 1992) is a well-known process-based biogeochemical soil model.
    This model has the advantage over other models of not only quantifying carbon
    dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4) and nitrous oxide (N2O) soil fluxes but assessing
    the effects of management practices on crop yields and nitrate (NO3−) leaching
    (Li et al., 2011). As DNDC has not been widely used in LCA literature, so far
    temporal and site-specific factors have not been thoroughly assessed, therefore
    soil emissions might be under or over estimated. To the knowledge of the authors,
    there is not a comprehensive comparative LCA study of potential environmental
    impacts of PATs. The above-mentioned LCA studies only assess a single PAT excluding
    other technologies. Therefore, the central goals of this research are the following:
    1) To perform a comparative LCA of a conventional five-year crop-rotation system
    with and without employing PATs for crop production under the climatic conditions
    of arable land in Lower Austria. The PATs to assess and compare to a conventional
    production system are the guidance technology, automatic steering system; the
    combined recording-reacting technologies, proximal sensor and prescription map
    created by remote sensors data; and the guidance-recording-reacting technology,
    automatic section control (ASC). 2) To assess emission hotspots, and 3) to perform
    a sensitivity analysis on the fertilization activity by using the alternative
    DNDC to quantify soil emissions. A brief description of the technology schemes
    is presented in section 2.1 below. 2. Methods 2.1. Scheme descriptions 2.1.1.
    Conventional scheme The conventional scheme is based on a hypothetical five-year
    crop rotation system performed in Lower Austrian arable land. The size and soil
    characteristics of the hypothetical system are assumed to correspond to the experimental
    farm at the research station of the University of Natural Resources and Life Sciences,
    Vienna. The experimental farm is located in Groβ-Enzersdorf, a municipality located
    east of Vienna, Austria, in the Marchfeld region. Cultivation periods from 2013
    to 2017 of the crop rotations at the experimental farm were used to resemble the
    cultivation, fertilization, plant protection and harvesting dates applied in this
    study. Crops included in the rotation are spring barley, soy, winter wheat, rapeseed,
    and winter barley; see Fig. S1 for details. The use of digital technology in this
    scheme is assumed to be inexistent. To model the conventional crop system national
    and regional crop input data were used. Historical crop yield data from Lower
    Austria for the years 2011–2020 was used to obtain average crop yields. The amount
    of crop fertilizer usage was given by the recommendations of the Austrian Chamber
    of Agriculture (LK-Österreich, 2021); the plant protection amount was obtained
    from a national retail survey on herbicides and pesticides in 2017 (AGES, 2017).
    The number of sowing seeds was obtained from the online cost calculator “IDB Deckungsbeiträge
    und Kalkulationsdaten” created by the Federal Institute for Agricultural Economics
    and Mountain Farming Issues (BAB, 2022). The average national amount of crop inputs
    was evenly distributed based on the scheduled dates of the agricultural activity.
    See Table 1 for details. Table 1. Dates when the agricultural activities were
    executed and amount of crop inputs used in the hypothetical conventional crop
    production system. Crop 1Cultivation date 2Seeds [kg/ha] 1Fertilization date 3Fertilizer

    Deckungsbeiträge und Kalkulationsdaten” created by the Federal Institute for Agricultural
    Economics and Mountain Farming Issues (BAB, 2022). 3 Amount represents the average
    crop fertilizer application in Austria based on crop and yield amounts. Data coming
    from the Austrian Chamber of Agriculture excel sheet database “LK- Düngerrechner
    für betriebsbezogene Aufzeichnungen” (LK-Österreich, 2021). 4 Amount represents
    the average crop plant protection application in Austria. Data coming from a 2017
    national survey on sales of pesticides and herbicides (AGES, 2017). Sales of 2016
    and 2017 were aggregated for rapeseed and winter wheat, therefore the total amount
    was divided between two in these two cases. 5 Amount represents the average crop
    yield in Lower Austria for the years 2011–2020. Data coming from the Federal Institute
    for Agricultural Economics and Mountain Farming Issues (BAB, 2022) and from the
    Der Grüne Bericht reports by Office of the Lower Austrian provincial government,
    Department of Agricultural Promotion (ANLAL-LF3, 2011, 2012, 2013, 2014, 2015).
    The hypothetical conventional crop system was set as the benchmark for comparing
    the other schemes. These schemes correspond to the use of selected PATs. 2.1.2.
    Automatic steering system scheme An automatic steering system is a hands-free
    guidance technology that uses global navigation satellite systems (GNSS) that
    allows tractors to follow a trajectory with a high degree of accuracy – a necessary
    pass-to-pass accuracy under 10 cm. These systems use real-time kinematic positioning
    (RTK) correction signals with the GNSS to improve geo-location reception data
    (Yves and Noack Patrick, 2012). Automatic steering systems can reduce the overlapping
    error related to manual steering; hence, diesel consumption is minimized (Balafoutis
    et al., 2017). The reduction of in-field operation fuel and on fertilizer, seed
    and pesticide inputs were contemplated in this scheme. Diesel savings achieved
    through automatic steering systems were documented in a master’s thesis by Hauser
    (2021) in Austria. The study included the assessment of diesel reduction in the
    disc harrow, heavy cultivator, precision seeder, and sprayer. The amount of input
    reduction on fertilizer, seeds, and pesticides corresponds to the same percentage
    of diesel savings. See Appendix, Table S1 for more information. 2.1.3. Automatic
    section control scheme ASC combines guidance and reacting technologies. ASC, like
    automatic steering systems, uses GNSS, and RTK to record precise geo-location
    data – generally with a demand on precision of 2 cm (Yves and Noack Patrick, 2012).
    The objective of this technology is to automatically deactivate the boom sprayer/row
    of the agricultural implement – seeder or sprayer – when it passes over the same
    location, thereby preventing overapplication of fertilizers, pesticides, and seeds
    (Shockley et al., 2012). The overlap reduction by ASC during the plant protection,
    fertilization, and planting was used to calculate the reduction in seeds, fertilizer,
    and pesticide inputs. Overlap reduction data were obtained from different experimental
    and non-experimental field studies. The weighted mean reduction was used for the
    calculations, see appendix Tables S2 and S3. Diesel reduction was also contemplated
    in this scheme; since ASC normally operates in conjunction with autosteer systems,
    the diesel reduction amount by the automatic steering systems was used. 2.1.4.
    Proximal sensors scheme Proximal sensors which act as recording technology measure
    the plant’s vegetation index – reflected radiation unabsorbed by plants to produce
    photosynthesis (Antille et al., 2018) – near crops to facilitate the application
    of site-specific mineral inputs, commonly for VRNA. Proximal sensors can be operated
    as handheld devices or can be mounted on ground-based stations or tractors. In
    this scheme, the N input saving by using handheld sensors was used to calculate
    the reduction in fertilizer usage. Data from an updated meta-analysis research
    by Colaço and Bramley (2018) on different studies showing N savings by handheld
    sensors were used; the weighted mean saving was calculated, see appendix Table
    S4. 2.1.5. Prescription maps created by vegetation data from remote sensors scheme
    Remote sensors measure crop vegetation indices at a distance – frequently by aircraft
    or satellites images (USGD, 2022). These satellite images are handled by specialized
    software to create crop nutritional maps. Nutritional maps are utilized by variable
    rate technologies to extend the nutritional input rates across the field based
    on site-specific crop requirements. Similar to other schemes, data for calculating
    input savings – generally fertilizer input expressed in N reduction – from this
    technology were obtained from different field studies The weighted mean N reduction
    obtained from these studies was used in the model; refer to Appendix Table S5.
    2.2. Life cycle assessment Life cycle assessment is a science-based decision method
    that quantifies the potential environmental impacts of products and services during
    their entire life span. The life cycle phases of the product from the production
    of raw materials, manufacturing, and use, to the end-of-life treatment, are included
    in the assessment (Guinée, 2002). The stages to perform an LCA are goal and scope
    definition, inventory analysis, impact assessment, and interpretation of results
    (ISO, 2006). The stages executed in this LCA study are presented in the following
    sections. 2.2.1. Goal, scope, and system boundary definition Three goals were
    established for this study: 1) to perform a comparative LCA of a conventional
    five-year hypothetical crop-rotation system with and without implementing PATs
    for crop production in Lower Austrian arable land, 2) to assess emission hotspots,
    and 3) to perform a sensitivity analysis on the fertilization activity results
    which are a hotspot in agricultural LCAs using regionalized soil models; in this
    case DNDC. A cradle-to-farm gate approach was selected for this LCA. The processes
    included in the system boundaries are shown in Fig. 1. The background processes
    are the supply and transformation of electricity, fuel, and raw materials into
    finished agricultural machinery, infrastructure and crop inputs, e.g., tractor
    manufacturing, fertilizers, and seeds. The foreground processes correspond to
    the direct field operations and agricultural inputs needed for crop production
    during the different agricultural activities (Medel-Jiménez et al., 2022). The
    agricultural activities included in this study are tillage, seeding, plant protection,
    fertilization, and harvesting. Despite evidence suggesting that data accumulation
    for employing PATs – such as sensor data, soil maps, satellite and drone images,
    weather station data, etc. – is drastically increasing (Kayad et al., 2022) the
    information communication technology (ICT) components to operate the PATs were
    not included in the system boundaries. As shown by Medel-Jiménez et al. (2022)
    the impacts arising from these components are negligible. Download : Download

    spring barley, soy, winter wheat, rapeseed, and winter barley. Adapted from Medel-Jiménez
    et al. (2022). The functional unit (FU) is presented in both mass and area-based
    terms, specifically, 1 ha and 1 kg of produced crop of spring barley, soy, winter
    wheat, rapeseed, and winter barley. 2.2.2. Life cycle inventory (LCI) Background
    inventories were obtained from the ecoinvent v3.8 cut-off database (ecoinvent,
    2021). The amount of input materials and emission outputs of ecoinvent processes
    represented in the system boundary were modified using secondary data. The following
    default ecoinvent processes were modified: “tillage, harrowing, by rotary harrow,
    cutoff (CH)”, “sowing, cutoff (CH)”, “application of plant protection product,
    by field sprayer, cutoff (CH)”, “fertilizing, by broadcaster, cutoff (CH)” and
    “combine harvesting, cutoff (CH)”. Similar crop production conditions were assumed
    between Austria and Switzerland; therefore, the Swiss location (CH) datasets were
    used as ecoinvent proxies. The machinery and diesel consumption data used in the
    hypothetical crop rotation model were obtained from a prior field experiment executed
    at the experimental farm of the University of Natural Resources and Life Sciences,
    Vienna, as documented by Medel-Jiménez et al. (2022). The operation of the same
    machinery for the production of all crops were assumed. The amount of crop input
    materials modified in the ecoinvent processes denotes the conventional crop production
    system (presented in Table 1) minus the inputs reductions obtained by implementing
    the specific PAT scheme (see Tables S1–S5). Table 2 represents the inventory used
    to model the crop rotation system. Table 2. Input inventory of the rotation crop

    65 P2O5/ha, and 50 K2O/ha suggested by LK-Österreich (2021) is used. 10 Applied
    in the form of calcium ammonium nitrate (CAN), diammonium phosphate (DAP), urea
    46, and 60er Kali. To calculate soil emissions many models and approaches are
    available. The selection for this study is based on Krexner et al. (Unpublished
    results) and applies the following procedure: To assess CO2 the 2006 IPCC tier
    I guidelines for national greenhouse gas emissions (De Klein et al., 2006b) were
    followed. To calculate N2O the 2019 IPCC tier II models (Hergoualc’h et al., 2019)
    were implemented, nevertheless using country-specific data from Austria’s National
    Inventory Report 2021 (Umweltbundesamt, 2021). Nitrogen oxides (NOx) and ammonia
    (NH3) emissions were estimated according to the European Monitoring and Evaluation
    Programme and European Environmental Agency (EMEP/EEA) guidebooks also using country-specific
    emission factors coming from Austria’s Informative Inventory Report (IIR) 2021
    (Umweltbundesamt, 2021). To calculate NO3⁻, phosphorus (P) and phosphate (PO₄³⁻)
    leaching the Swiss Agricultural Life Cycle Assessment (SALCA)-NO3 (Richner et
    al., 2014) and SALCA-P (Prasuhn, 2006) models were applied. In the case of heavy
    metal emissions to soils, the SALCA-heavy metal methodology (Freiermuth, 2006)
    was used in this study. However, the inclusion of heavy metals through pesticides
    was not included since the chemical content of plant protection products is unknown.
    Similar to the other emission models, country-specific data from Herndl et al.
    (2016) were used in SALCA-NO3, SALCA-P, and SALCA-heavy metal. 2.2.3. Life cycle
    impact assessment (LCIA) Impact categories were selected with a focus on changes
    in the soil nutrient cycle, particularly with regard to the effects of fertilizer
    and pesticide application. Excessive use of fertilizers can lead to eutrophication
    of freshwater bodies (Ayoub, 1999; de Vries et al., 2013), acidification of soils
    (de Vries et al., 2013), particulate matter formation (Erisman et al., 2013),
    creation of toxic substances (Erisman et al., 2007), and acid rain (Ayoub, 1999).
    Similarly, excessive pesticide use can lead to surface and groundwater contamination
    (Aktar et al., 2009), biochemical imbalances in the soil (Hussain et al., 2009)
    resulting in loss of fertility, and toxicity to humans upon exposure to herbicides
    (Zeliger, 2008). In addition to these local impacts, this study also evaluated
    their contribution to global warming potential (Davidson, 2009). The impact categories
    evaluated include climate change (CC), fine particulate matter formation (FPMF),
    freshwater eutrophication (FE), freshwater ecotoxicity (FET), terrestrial acidification
    (TA), terrestrial ecotoxicity (TET), and human carcinogenic toxicity (HT). Marine
    eutrophication (ME) was not included in this assessment despite its significant
    contribution to the enrichment of riverine and marine systems with nitrogen. The
    reason is the absence of soil emission elementary flows that enter the water/ocean
    compartments, therefore, differences between the various schemes are negligible.
    The impact assessment method ReCiPe 2016 midpoint (H) (Huijbregts et al., 2017)
    was chosen to calculate the environmental impacts; to perform this, the software
    OpenLCA v.1.10.3 (GreenDelta, 2020) was used. 2.2.4. Uncertainty and statistical
    analysis Uncertainty analysis is a recommended practice (ISO, 2006) to increase
    and improve the reliability of LCA results (Huijbregts et al., 2001, 2003). Monte
    Carlo (MC) simulation is a common method to deal with uncertainty in LCA studies
    (Lloyd and Ries, 2007). A MC simulation with 1000 iterations with results showing
    the 5% and 95% interpercentile range probability distributions was performed in
    this study. The measure of dispersion and distribution of secondary data dealing
    with diesel consumption and lifespan of machinery, time to perform an agricultural
    activity, and amount of crop inputs such as fertilizer, seeds, pesticide, and
    yields were analyzed, refer to Table S6. Moreover, an integral part of this study
    is to calculate the amount of crop production input savings by different PATs.
    In this regard, for each of the schemes, a weighted arithmetic mean was calculated
    from the input reduction reports. The contribution to the weighted mean was based
    on the number of field samples in the ASC and proximal sensor scheme, whereas
    in the prescription map scheme the number of soil/leaf samples as data points
    to make the nutritional map were used. The dispersion and distribution of the
    percentage input savings data by the schemes were analyzed and included in the
    MC simulation, refer to Table S6. To assess the distribution of the MC output
    data a Shapiro-Wilk normality test (p ≤ 0.05) was executed. Correspondingly, the
    non-parametric Kruskal–Wallis test – since the data showed a nonnormal distribution
    in most of the instances – was performed to compare statistical significances
    between the medians (p ≤ 0.05). To perform the normality and statistical test
    the software R was used (R Core Team, 2020). 2.2.5. Sensitivity analysis using
    a different soil emissions modelling approach – the DeNitrification-DeComposition
    soil model DNDC is a process-based biogeochemical soil model that simulates carbon
    (C) sequestration, crop yield, trace gas emissions, and nitrate leaching for different
    agroecosystems. The model simulates daily soil C dynamics and hourly N2O in a
    computer-based simulation program. Ecological drivers – such as soil moisture
    and temperature, precipitation, and climate – and agricultural management practices
    determine soil biogeochemical reactions and consequently soil emissions (Li et
    al., 1992; Li, 2000). In this study, the method used by Deng et al. (2017); Medel-Jiménez
    et al. (2022); Song et al. (2019); Tabatabaie et al. (2018) in which DNDC was
    integrated into the LCA methodology by adding direct and indirect field emissions
    during the fertilization activity into the LCI phase was implemented. A diagram
    representing the integrated LCA-DNDC framework by Medel-Jiménez et al. (2022)

    full-size image Fig. 2. Framework representing the LCA-DNDC integration (Medel-Jiménez
    et al., 2022). To make a comparison between results using soil emissions from
    the models described in section 2.2.2 and the simulated soil emissions by DNDC
    a sensitivity analysis on the fertilization activity was executed, see results
    section 3.1. DNDC was calibrated to show the site-specific ecological drivers
    and management practices simulated for the hypothetical crop system. Average historical
    weather data from 2011 to 2020 in Lower Austria were used to simulate the entire
    crop system, the data were obtained from the online database of the Central Institution
    for Meteorology and Geodynamics (ZAMG, 2022). Soil nitrate concentration measured
    in 2019 before the start of a VRNA field experiment at the experimental farm of
    the University of Natural Resources and Life Sciences, Vienna was used in the
    model (Schwaiger, 2021). Site-specific soil properties such as soil type, clay
    content, and pH values were obtained from the Austrian Research Centre for Forests
    online map (BFW, 2020). Input values in the management practices segment correspond
    to the machinery used in the LCI section, refer to Table 2, and the dates of agricultural
    activities occurrence resemble the crop management executions primary historical
    data in the experimental field, refer to Table 1. Table S7 shows the required
    input data to calibrate DNDC coming from primary or secondary data. The maximum
    grain yield amount, the water demand for each crop, and the annual N demand were
    calibrated as shown in Table S8. To validate the accuracy of the model the yearly
    plant growth simulation results were compared to the average national crop yield
    amounts. Results showed equivalent yield volumes. A tillage-to-harvesting allocation
    approach was used to determine the corresponding soil emissions for the entire
    system; the allocation started from the tillage day of the first crop, in this
    case spring barley to the harvesting day of the last crop, winter barley (see
    Fig. S1 to see the schedule of the agricultural activities). The sum of the simulated
    daily CO2, N2O, NO, dinitrogen (N2), NH3, CH4 and P during the allocation period
    was computed as the total soil emission. The total soil emission was taken as
    the central tendency and included in the life cycle inventory. 3. Results and
    discussion In this section, the environmental impacts and positive impact reductions
    by the PATs schemes are shown. In subsection 3.1 the results of the sensitivity
    analysis using soil emissions by the alternative DNDC soil model are discussed.
    Table 3 reveals the potential environmental impact reductions by the PAT schemes.
    These results are shown in an area-based functional unit – 1 ha produced crop
    mix of spring barley, soy, winter wheat, rapeseed and winter barley; Table S9
    in the appendix shows the results in a mass-based functional unit. The results
    demonstrate a reduction in all of the impact categories by implementing PATs,
    in both, mass and area-based units. However, the mass-based impact reduction results
    show a slight decrease due to the yield differences among the crops in the system
    (see Table S9). The technology that displays the highest reductions is the sensor
    scheme, followed by the prescription maps created by vegetation data from remote
    sensors, next is the ASC, and finally is the autosteer scheme. Table 3. Impacts

    rounded to two decimal points. Comparing the studied impacts, the highest reductions
    are found for TET with −28.8%, FET with −25.9%, TA −24.7% and FPMF −24.7% (baseline
    vs. sensor scheme); in the case of CC the reduction was −17.0%. The amount of
    agricultural input savings by PATs is the most influential parameter on the results.
    A linear relationship is observed between the impact and the crop production input
    savings – although non statistical analysis was performed to corroborate it. For
    example, the prescription map and sensor schemes implemented a weighted average
    reduction of 14.0% and 23.9% respectively on input usage, Table 3 shows that these
    input usage savings corresponded to a reduction in environmental impacts within
    the same range. Despite obtaining the weighted average amount of agricultural
    input savings by the different schemes from a broad spectrum of studies without
    local representativeness, it was the closest method to compare different PATs
    since there is no specific data available for Lower Austria. The studies used
    in this research filled the gaps in literature for our case study, the eastern
    federal state of Lower Austria. Literature used to calculate the reduction in
    inputs for crop production – diesel, fertilizer, herbicide, seeds, etc. – revealed
    the most influential variables affecting their results. For example, several studies
    show that the overlap reduction – which determines the amount of input savings
    – by the ASC scheme is influenced by the size, shape, and the presence of obstacles
    in the field as concluded by Corassa et al. (2018); Larson et al. (2015); Shockley
    et al. (2012); and Velandia et al. (2013). In the case of the proximal sensor
    and the prescription maps created by vegetation data from remote sensors schemes,
    the site-specific temporal and spatial characteristics such as weather, soil,
    and crop necessities have a relevant influence on the results; moreover, as concluded
    by Colaço and Bramley (2018) results on VRNA strategies using sensors and adopted
    by different authors are compromised by the experimental design and the comparable
    reference approach of the experiment. It is relevant to mention that PATs can
    manipulate spatial variables such as pest, weed, and crop nutrient deficiencies
    to increase crop yields and reduce production inputs however, they do not influence
    environmental and soil pedoclimate conditions (Godwin et al., 2003). Further research
    might include the above-mentioned factors influencing the crop production input
    savings to assess future smart farming technologies. The relative potential impact
    reductions compared to the conventional system production in an area-based FU
    are shown in Fig. 3, result on a mass-base are shown in Fig. S2. The error bar
    in the same figure displays the 5% interpercentile range probability distribution
    based on 1000 iterations MC simulations. The proximal sensor scheme shows the
    highest uncertainty in all of the impacts. This is partially due to the distribution
    and dispersion of the data from the literature studies on fertilizer input savings
    by proximal sensors. A weighted average input reduction of −23.9%, with a lognormal
    distribution and a 2.9 standard deviation was used in the LCA model. In contrast,
    the autosteer scheme shows the lowest uncertainty since a lognormal distribution
    with a standard deviation of 1.00 was used for diesel input savings in all of
    the agricultural activities (refer to Table S6 in the appendix to see the variability
    of input parameters in the model). Furthermore, the accumulation of all of the
    input parameters uncertainties – e.g., soil emissions, heavy metals, crop yields,
    etc. – also influence the distribution of the MC results. Uncertainty on TET,
    FET, and HT for example, is the highest among the impacts, this is because fertilizer
    production is a hotspot to those impacts (see Fig. 4) and the uncertainty of fertilizer
    production and application is attached to the variability of the data found in
    literature. On the other hand, impacts of which soil emissions are a hotspot,
    CC, FPMF, and TA show lower uncertainty because the dispersion of soil emissions
    data is less than in the fertilizer production/application. Download : Download

    followed by a Dunn post hoc test was used to determine significant differences
    between the medians (p ≤ 0.05) of the crop systems using different PAT. Distinct
    letters on the bracket indicate significant differences among technologies. To
    determine significant differences between impacts among the schemes a Kruskal–Wallis
    test followed by a Dunn post hoc test was executed, see Tables S10 and S11 for
    results. Outcomes show that impacts are statistically different in the majority
    of the schemes, deducing that environmental impacts reductions are subject to
    the effectiveness of each individual technology. When comparing the impact reductions
    of individual PATs to other studies results might differ. For example, Gasso et
    al. (2014) performed a comparative LCA of a CTF against a random traffic farming
    (RTF) in Denmark. CTF is a traffic strategy that uses satellites and autosteer
    systems to separate crop zones and traffic lanes – CTF helps to reduce the overapplication
    of agricultural inputs by reducing the overlap of agricultural machinery in the
    field. Their results showed a reduction in all the analyzed impact categories
    by using CTF, with reduction ranges of human toxicity by 3.0–15.0%, eco-toxicity
    by 11.0–138.0%, terrestrial eutrophication by 29.0%, and climate change by 50.0%.
    In contrast, the autosteer and ASC schemes in this study showed a −3.9% and −8.9%
    on human toxicity, −6.1% and −6.2% on terrestrial ecotoxicity, −2.4% and −6.4%
    on CC respectively. The discrepancy is due to the modelling approach and technologies
    implemented in both studies. The autosteer scheme in this research only includes
    savings on in-field operation fuel, in the case of ASC the input savings on fertilizer
    use due to overlap reduction was calculated at 11.9% and for herbicides at 6.3%.
    On the other hand, Gasso et al. (2014) used higher input and emissions savings
    due to the overlap reduction. For in-field operation diesel reduction they used
    23.0% and between 23.0 and 32.0% for soil emissions reduction. In a different
    LCA study by Medel-Jiménez et al. (2022) a proximal crop sensor was used for VRNA
    in a Lower Austrian field experiment. By using the tractors’ mounted proximal
    sensor, the CC was reduced by 8.6% in the best of the scenarios. In Missouri,
    Li et al. (2016) also implemented a proximal sensor for VRNA for crop production,
    here a 10.0% reduction in CC was achieved. The experimental design and in-site
    pedoclimate characteristics in both experiments gave different fertilizer input
    savings, a reduction of fertilizer application of around 21.0% and 17.0% by Medel-Jiménez
    et al. (2022) and Li et al. (2016) respectively was shown, in comparison this
    study shows a 23.9% reduction. The discrepancy in CC reductions can be explained
    by the differences in the experimental design, as well as by the results of the
    conventional/base schemes to be compared. In Fig. 4, the environmental impacts
    of different PATs on an area-based FU are compared across crops in the agricultural
    system, Fig. S3 shows the results on a mass-based FU. Crop production utilizing
    high number of agricultural inputs and agricultural processes hotspots can be
    seen in this figure, where rapeseed, winter wheat, and winter barley utilize higher
    agricultural production inputs, while soybean the lowest inputs. Rapeseed, for
    example, uses the highest amount of fertilizer at 155 kg N/ha but the lowest number
    of seeds at 3.5 kg/ha. On the other hand, soybean crop production uses 60 kg N/ha
    and a relatively high number of seeds at 125 kg/ha. The production of soybean
    seeds is a hotspot in the cultivation of this crop. Emissions arising from deforestation
    and change in arable land are considered by the background ecoinvent v3.8 cut-off
    database (ecoinvent, 2021), which shows that soybean production for seeding has
    a more substantial environmental impact compared to other crops. Fertilizer manufacturing
    is a process hotspot in the production of the five-year crop system. This process
    contributes approximately half of the total emissions to FE, FET, HT, and TET
    impacts, while soil emissions are a hotspot in the FPMF and TA categories since
    it accounts for over 70.0% of total emissions. Emissions of heavy metals to groundwater
    and air contribute significantly to FET and TET. FET is primarily caused by copper,
    zinc, and silver leaching into groundwater, while TET is mainly driven by copper
    emissions into the air. Hexavalent chromium (Cr VI) compounds in groundwater are
    the major contributors to HT; studies have shown the carcinogenic effect of Cr
    VI on humans (Wilbur et al., 2012). FE is mainly provoked by phosphate leaching
    into groundwater. The indirect soil emission NH3 is the prime responsible for
    FPMF and TA. In the case of CC, approximately 40.0% of total emissions are attributed
    to soil emissions while 30.0% to fertilizer manufacturing although these numbers
    vary between crops, but soybean being the exception. In this case, the production
    of soybean seeds contributes between 27.0 and 30.0% and soil emission between
    32.0 and 34.0% in the different schemes. Soil N2O and CO2 fluxes into the air
    are the main contributors to CC. 3.1. Sensitivity analysis of soil emissions by
    using the DNDC model In this subsection the results of a sensitivity analysis
    on the fertilization activity by using the alternative DNDC model to quantify
    soil emissions are presented, see Table 4. The fertilization activity was chosen
    because it is considered a hotspot in the agricultural production process and
    it is the only activity being affected by soil emissions. Table 4. Sensitivity
    analysis of fertilization using the DNDC model to simulate soil emissions. Notes:
    1 Conventional scheme = 100%. Numbers rounded to two decimal points. To model
    soil emissions due to fertilization the approach based on Krexner et al. (Unpublished
    results) was used. Krexner et al. (Unpublished results) used the IPCC tier I/II
    methodologies, SALCA-NO3, SALCA-P, SALCA-heavy metal, and EMEP/EEA guidebooks.
    2 Conventional scheme = 100%. Numbers rounded to two decimal points. The DeNitrification-DeComposition
    (DNDC) soil model was used to quantify soil emissions due to fertilization. Results
    highlighted in green show a significant increase in impact reduction when compared
    to the conventional scheme. Results highlighted in red show a significant decrease
    in impact reduction when compared to the conventional scheme. Results in blue
    did not change. The use of DNDC to simulate soil emissions did not influence environmental
    impacts, such as FET, HT, and TET, where emissions factors from soil are insignificant.
    This is because emissions from fertilizer manufacturing have a greater impact,
    as shown in Fig. 4. Consequently, results for these impacts were unchanged, regardless
    of whether DNDC or IPCC tier I/II and the SALCA methodologies were employed. In
    contrast, the use of DNDC has a greater effect on CC, FPMF, FE, and TA impacts
    where soil emissions used in the LCIA approach – in this case, ReCiPe 2016 midpoint
    (H) – are significant. Using soil emissions from the DNDC model, the autosteer
    showed a 13 times higher reduction potential than that achieved using the IPCC
    tier I/II, SALCA and EMEP/EEA methodologies in the CC impact, while the ASC, prescription
    map, and proximal sensor schemes demonstrated reductions of 6, 5 and 3 times higher
    respectively. A reason for this is the reduction observed in the N2O emission
    from 15.4 to 0.2 kg by the DNDC despite simulating an increase of CO2 from 1183.1
    to 5227.3 kg – both in the conventional scheme. It is relevant to differentiate
    that CO2 simulated by DNDC is due to soil respiration of SOC while the IPCC tier
    I uses an emission factor based on urea application. In addition, it is also observed
    an increase in the reduction of FE impact by the DNDC model, in this case the
    autosteer, ASC, prescription map, and proximal sensor schemes showed reductions
    of 7, 4, 3, and 2 times higher than using soil emissions from the chosen models
    in this research, see models in section 2.2.2. A cause for this is that the DNDC
    leachate and run-off simulating P emissions were negligible, in contrast the original
    SALCA-P model gave a phosphate leachate and runoff of 0.5 and 1.8 kg P respectively.
    The use of soil emissions from DNDC resulted in a significant decrease on the
    FPMF and TA impact reductions. The indirect soil emission of NH3 increased four
    times, passing from 127.8 to 543.1 kg NH3. Moreover, in terms of NOx the original
    soil model did not differentiate between NO and NO2, DNDC simulated NO and N2
    fluxes from soil denitrification without NO2 fluxes. Consequently, instead of
    observing a reduction, FPMF and TA impacts increased, particularly in the case
    of TA, in which NH3 has a higher impact factor. The results of this analysis were
    found to be consistent with the findings of a study conducted by Deng et al. (2017),
    in which the DNDC model predicted lower N2O, NO3- leaching and NH3 soil fluxes
    than the emission factors from the IPCC method. Additionally, results by Guo et
    al. (2012) the direct N2O emissions from IPCC were four times higher than DNDC.
    Moreover, recent results by Medel-Jiménez et al. (2022) shown that indirect soil
    emissions NH3 and NO3 by DNDC were more susceptible to the amount of applied fertilizer
    than N2O. Nevertheless, this study does not provide insight into the specific
    factors that drive this sensitivity. Nonetheless, the use of DNDC to quantify
    soil emissions gives a closer reality to temporal and site-specific influences
    affecting the sustainability of PATs. Still, the DNDC model is a model with high
    spatial resolution, relying on regional and even local input data, like weather
    conditions and soil parameters, which makes it the right choice for regional/local
    LCA studies but not, as in this case, for studies covering supra-regional spaces.
    4. Conclusion A comparative LCA analysis was conducted to quantify the environmental
    impacts of a hypothetical five-year crop-rotation system under the climate and
    management conditions of arable land in Lower Austria. This study compares the
    environmental impacts with and without employing precision agriculture technologies
    (PATs) for crop production. The technology that shows the highest reductions is
    proximal sensors, followed by prescription maps created by vegetation data from
    remote sensors, ASC, and autosteer with reductions of 17.0, 8.9, 6.4, and 2.4%
    on CC impacts, respectively. These results show benefits due to agricultural input
    savings related to the use of PATs but reliability of these findings is limited
    due to the high degree of uncertainty in the used savings potentials data since
    site-specific and experimental variables vary between consulted studies and because
    data is only available for very large plot sizes which can rarely be found in
    Austria. Furthermore, the results of this research show that rapeseed production
    in Lower Austria uses the highest amount of fertilizer in the crop system, hence
    contributing the most to the majority of the environmental impacts in terms of
    area and mass-based results. The manufacturing of fertilizer is identified as
    a hotspot in the TET, FET, and HT and soil emissions in the CC, FPMF, and TA impacts.
    Additionally, a sensitivity analysis on fertilization activity was performed using
    the DeNitrification-DeComposition (DNDC) biogeochemical soil model to simulate
    soil emissions of arable land in Lower Austria. The results indicate a significant
    change in the indirect NH3 and NO3 emissions, being FPMF and TA the most affected
    impacts. Assessing and comparing the environmental impacts of multiple PATs in
    a single study has never been performed; this research could lead to the creation
    of a standardized framework to assess the effectiveness of smart agricultural
    technologies in combating the effects of climate change on crop production. Further
    research should emphasize the importance of evaluating these technologies under
    consistent management practices, weather, and field characteristics. Additionally,
    further analysis could be conducted to identify the effects of field size and
    shape, machinery working width, and site-and temporal weather factors affecting
    agricultural inputs savings by each PAT. CRediT authorship contribution statement

    Unmanned aerial spraying systemVariable rate sprayingPrecision agricultureFlow
    rate controlSustainable farming 1. Introduction Rapid agricultural evolution has
    given rise to precision agriculture, meeting the global demand for sustainable
    and efficient food production (Yaqot et al., 2022). The fundamental principle
    of precision agriculture is to optimize resource utilization, enhance plant health,
    and promote environmental sustainability (Rusmayadi et al., 2023). The accurate
    application of agricultural inputs, particularly pesticides, plays a significant
    role in achieving these objectives across vast and diverse sectors (Meshram et
    al., 2021). Traditionally, the manual and uniform distribution of pesticides has
    resulted in excessive chemical usage and adverse environmental impacts. These
    limitations have been mitigated through the adoption of precision farming tools,
    such as GPS-guided equipment and data analytics. Unmanned aerial systems (UASs)
    are prominently utilized for pesticide spraying (Frankelius et al., 2017, Wang
    et al., 2022). Precision agriculture is a comprehensive farming approach that
    efficiently utilizes data, technology, and high-tech equipment to manage agricultural
    resources, including water, land, fertilizers, and pesticides (Karunathilake et
    al., 2023). It enables the precise application of inputs at specific locations,
    ensuring that each part of the field receives the necessary nutrients, as opposed
    to conventional farming methods that treat an entire field uniformly. UASs, along
    with technologies such as satellite imagery, global positioning system (GPS),
    and geographic information system (GIS), are integrated to achieve this precision
    (Tayari et al., 2015). Precision agriculture heavily relies on Variable Rate Spraying
    (VRS) and its significance cannot be overstated. Conventional agricultural techniques
    result in pesticide overuse due to uncontrolled spraying, whereas VRS tailors
    pesticide spraying to meet the precise requirements of different locations within
    a field (Alam et al., 2020). By interpreting the data collected from sensors and
    integrating it with real-time environmental information, UASs adjust spray rates,
    coverage, and application patterns ensuring that pesticides and other inputs reach
    their intended locations with the required quantities. VRS positively impacts
    the environment and economy, reduces wasteful resource usage, enhances crop health,
    and minimizes waste from chemical production (Hussain et al., 2019). UASSs comprise
    a multi-rotor or a fixed-wing drone and are equipped with various components such
    as pesticide tanks, pumps, and nozzles to effectively dispense pesticides or fertilizers.
    They are also equipped with GPS and navigation technology to map the field accurately
    and follow predefined flight paths and maintain the required altitude and velocity.
    The operator can manually control UASSs using a remote control or set up the flight
    plan using software such as precision flight or drone deploy, enabling autonomous
    operations. They have become essential instruments in precision agriculture due
    to their precise spray capabilities (Hassler and Baysal-Gurel, 2019, Mukherjee
    et al., 2019; Yae et al., 2016). Fig. 1, Fig. 2 depict a DJI MG-1P eight-rotor
    electric UASS model (Shan et al., 2022) and an SG 10P eight-rotor UASS model (Hanif
    et al., 2023), respectively. Download : Download high-res image (220KB) Download

    UASSs automate and enhance crop spraying, eliminating the need for manual labor
    and reducing human exposure to hazardous chemicals. For effective pest and disease
    management, UASSs are also equipped with various sensors and technologies, such
    as high-precision GPS and real-time kinematics (RTK). This enables UASSs to follow
    precise flight paths, ensuring accurate coverage during spraying. RTK provides
    centimeter-level accuracy, crucial for precision spraying (Ekaso et al., 2020,
    Hassler and Baysal-Gurel, 2019). UASSs reduce chemical use and pesticide overspray,
    resulting in cost savings and environmental benefits (Hassler et al., 2019). They
    operate at low altitudes with precise control, minimizing the spray drift caused
    by wind pressure and decreasing the risk of environmental contamination and unintended
    harm to neighboring crops (Chen et al., 2022). UASSs access complex field areas
    that are typically difficult for conventional ground-based equipment to access,
    ensuring even spray coverage across crops while adjusting pesticide flow rates
    for resource optimization and cost reduction (Ayamga et al., 2021, Lian et al.,
    2019). Furthermore, UASSs efficiently and rapidly disperse fertilizers, ensuring
    that crops receive the necessary minerals for healthier growth and increased harvest
    yields (Rahman et al., 2021), which reduce labor costs and fertilization process
    time (Ayamga et al., 2021). UASSs provide diverse agricultural benefits, including
    improved resource management, minimized pesticide usage, enhanced productivity,
    and early detection of crop issues. Pesticides, herbicides, and fertilizers can
    be precisely sprayed by primarily regulating the flow rate to distribute appropriate
    amounts of inputs, ensuring high-yield, environmentally-conscious agriculture
    (Rahman et al., 2021). Precisely controlling the flow rate is vital for VRS, which
    is the primary objective of this review. VRS focuses on uniform input delivery
    via an intelligent, adaptable approach that considers the specific needs of each
    field region. Such precision allows farmers to enhance the efficiency of their
    inputs, reduce waste, and minimize environmental impact, increase productivity,
    promote environmental sustainability, and improve economic viability (Alam et
    al., 2020). Developing flow rate control techniques can enhance productivity,
    reduce chemical usage, improve crop health, and promote agricultural sustainability
    (Meshram et al., 2021). These technical advancements involve developing new tools
    and laying the foundation for a more prosperous and sustainable agricultural future
    (Frankelius et al., 2017). This review serves as a guide, highlighting the incredible
    advancements in VRS for precise spray requirements in precision agriculture using
    UASSs. The fundamentals of flow rate control mechanisms, data-driven approaches,
    practical applications, and significant challenges in precision agriculture are
    also discussed. This review provides a comprehensive understanding of the cutting-edge
    innovations that are reshaping traditional farming methods and highlights the
    potential for new development, encouraging further research and invention. This
    review has been meticulously structured to guide readers through the essential
    components of VRS using UASSs. Each section covers various aspects of UASS technology
    via thorough discussions and examples. Moreover, the innovative impact of precision
    agriculture is illustrated using a knowledge matrix. The review concludes with
    a summary of findings, highlighting the crucial role of precise spray control
    in precision agriculture and outlining future research directions for agricultural
    transformation. 2. Flow rate control methods 2.1. Conventional flow rate control
    systems Precision agriculture has witnessed notable developments, particularly
    related to flow rate control while spraying agricultural inputs. These developments
    are based on the fundamental principles of conventional flow rate control systems.
    These advancements in flow rate control are crucial for enhancing the precision
    and efficiency of input application in agriculture, directly impacting crop health
    and resource conservation. This section discusses conventional techniques, along
    with their operation principles and drawbacks. 2.1.1. Traditional methods for
    flow rate control Conventional flow rate control systems relied on mechanical
    components and manual adjustments. These adjustments included simple mechanical
    systems, valve settings, and fixed nozzles to regulate the flow rate of agricultural
    inputs during spraying. The flow rates, valve positions, and nozzle sizes were
    manually controlled based on predefined values or operators’ experience. Importantly,
    these parameters remained constant irrespective of the varying field conditions.
    2.1.2. Limitations of conventional systems Conventional flow rate control systems
    have several limitations: they are inflexible and cannot adapt to changing environmental
    conditions. Moreover, the efficiency of input application is impacted by wind
    speed, wind direction, and manual control. Excessive doses may be applied to fields
    with high input requirements, leading to resource wastage and environmental harm
    (Abbas et al., 2020, Chen et al., 2020, Tewari et al., 2020). Conversely, undertreated
    areas may result in reduced agricultural yields. As conventional systems are manually
    operated, operators must constantly monitor and adjust parameters during spraying.
    This increases the potential for human errors and creates labor-intensive requirements.
    This lack of adaptability leads to inaccurate and inefficient spraying of inputs,
    consequently resulting in excessive or insufficient pesticide usage (Tewari et
    al., 2020). As a result, newer systems have been developed to address these shortcomings.
    The input application rates vary based on the operators’ expertise and experience,
    resulting in inconsistent crop protection and reduced yields. The flow rate management
    process of these methods cannot be integrated with real-time data, such as field
    conditions, crop health information, and meteorological data. Thus, efficient
    flow rate control mechanisms must be developed by leveraging technology, automation,
    and data-driven decision-making to overcome these challenges and revolutionize
    the spraying process (Chen et al., 2017). These developments and their significance
    will be further discussed in the following sections. 2.2. Decision support for
    flow rate in UASSs The integration of UASSs into precision agriculture has enabled
    innovative, flexible, and precise control of flow rates (Chen et al., 2022). Herein,
    the most recent advancements that revolutionize flow rate control and adaptable
    and dynamic methods for precision spraying are discussed. 2.2.1. Innovations and
    technologies improving flow rate control Artificial intelligence (AI) systems
    can process and analyze large datasets in real-time by gathering data from various
    sources, including meteorological conditions, field variability, crop health,
    and past performance, to make data-driven and adaptive decisions. Such systems
    can be used to control the flow rate and quickly adapt to varying conditions such
    as input requirements and wind speed variations (Liu et al., 2021; Sanchez et
    al., 2023). Machine learning (ML) models can learn from existing data and generate
    predictive algorithms that estimate the optimal flow rates based on different
    parameters. This predictive control is particularly valuable in dynamic agricultural
    environments. ML models continuously enhance their predictions by learning from
    the accumulated data, yielding precise and effective flow rate adjustments (Ayoub
    et al., 2022, Yanlie et al., 2016). Alam et al. (2020) used random forest classifier
    to detect and classify weeds. Their classification model was initially trained
    offline using an image dataset before testing in the field. An application device
    equipped with a pulse width modulation (PWM)–based fluid flow controller and a
    vision-based feedback system was used to spray the required input quantity. AI
    enables highly personalized input applications based on the field characteristics
    and environmental parameters, such as crop health and soil conditions (Tewari
    et al., 2020). Liu et al. (2021) developed a ML-based variable-rate sprayer and
    assessed its performance by accurately spraying targeted weeds. They used deep
    learning techniques to categorize weeds in real-time. The variable-rate sprayer,
    designed to control the flow rate, comprises a camera for capturing images, a
    computer for analyzing photos, a microcontroller board for system control, and
    spray nozzles with solenoid valves. The system sends trigger signals based on
    real-time captured images to control the flow rate of the nozzles. Kotkar et al.
    (2021) presented an innovative approach of automated chemical spraying using a
    convolutional neural network (CNN) to identify crop illnesses using object identification,
    image preprocessing, segmentation, extraction, and categorization. 2.2.2. Benefits
    of advanced flow rate control The accuracy and versatility of modern flow rate
    control systems reduce the adverse impacts of agriculture on the environment.
    Minimizing waste and avoiding excessive chemical use contribute to environmentally
    friendlier and sustainable farming practices. Precision farming input application
    ensures that crops receive the exact care they require, preventing over- and under-treatment
    and enhancing crop resilience, health, and yield. Moreover, advanced flow rate
    control techniques have become increasingly automated, reducing manual oversight
    and workload and ensuring optimal farm management (Dou et al., 2018, Yanlie et
    al., 2016). 3. Advanced technologies for flow rate control Flow rates must be
    precisely controlled to enhance crop health, reduce wasteful use of resources,
    and optimize input distribution. Herein, the related cutting-edge technologies
    that ensure precise flow rate control and distribution of inputs in the field
    are discussed. 3.1. Electromechanical flow control Electromechanical systems have
    revolutionized precision agriculture by providing precision and flexibility in
    flow rate control. These systems are built on the fundamental concept of mechanical
    systems by integrating electrical inputs and combine mechanical and electrical
    components to control the agricultural input flow. For instance, electrically
    actuated valves that adjust feed rates for large-scale wheat farming based on
    variations in soil moisture content. Sensors provide real-time data on soil conditions,
    which enables these valves to precisely control the distribution of water and
    nutrients and maximize crop production while preserving resources (Luck et al.,
    2015). Fig. 3(a) refers to the electromechanical-based nozzle, i.e., solenoid-controlled
    nozzle and Fig. 3(b) shows the disassembled view of the nozzle with all the components
    labeled (Grisso et al., 2011). Download : Download high-res image (204KB) Download

    nozzle: (a) fasting-acting, solenoid-controlled nozzle and (b) components of the
    solenoid-controlled nozzle. Electrostatic nozzles in precision agriculture have
    enhanced precision in spraying applications. By charging droplets, these nozzles
    increase the adhesion of pesticides to plants, leading to more efficient use of
    chemicals and reduced drift. For instance, they are utilized in vineyards to uniformly
    distribute pesticides on grapevines and reduce chemical drift, thereby yielding
    high-quality wines (Law, 1983, Law, 2001). Fig. 4 schematizes the electrostatic
    nozzle designed and developed by Patel et al. (2017) specifically for orchards,
    which ensures accurate co-axial alignment between the annular ring electrode and
    the nozzle, allowing for uniform spraying. Download : Download high-res image

    electrostatic nozzle. Intelligent flow control valves exemplify the synergy between
    precision agriculture and data-driven decision-making. Integrated with a network
    of sensors, these valves dynamically adjust flow rates in real-time while continuously
    monitoring field conditions. Sensors measure temperature, crop health, and soil
    moisture. Using these data, intelligent valves adjust irrigation rates to ensure
    plants receive appropriate amounts of water at the right time, thereby maximizing
    production and reducing water consumption. These control valves operate systematically
    by collecting information on crop health, weather, and soil moisture. They reduce
    the pressure in irrigation systems when rainfall is anticipated to prevent overwatering,
    whereas they increase the flow to ensure plants receive adequate water during
    a heatwave. The valve adjusts pesticide rates for concentrated application if
    the crop health sensors identify any illnesses. Such real-time automation optimizes
    crop health and resource utilization by making all necessary modifications automatically
    (Hussain et al., 2020, Sharda et al., 2015). Nasir et al. (2021) developed an
    intelligent pressure and flow rate control system for VRS based on proportional
    integral derivative (PID). Fig. 5 schematizes the intelligent flow rate control

    Fig. 6. VRS system with intelligent flow control. Pneumatic systems use air pressure
    to direct fluid flow based on the agricultural field. Such systems are used in
    citrus orchards, where the tree height and canopy density vary considerably. Pneumatic
    systems optimize resource utilization by automatically adapting input application
    rates to accommodate these variations and ensure uniform coverage (Zhu et al.,
    2006). The compressed air flow in these systems is regulated by specially designed
    valves and regulators. The released air changes the system pressure, ultimately
    governing the input flow. Sensors that monitor changes in air pressure, altitude,
    or other pertinent variables are connected to this system. To guarantee a steady
    and accurate input supply, the system adjusts the pressure and airflow as it detects
    deviations, such as different terrains or atmosphere conditions (Al-Gaadi et al.,
    2023). 3.2. Precision nozzles and valves A key element of VRS is the selection
    of suitable nozzles and valves to ensure that the flow rates of inputs are precisely
    adjusted to the specific needs of crops. The effect of these components on enhancing
    the effectiveness of VRS is discussed herein. 3.2.1. Specialized nozzles and valves
    for VRS Specialized nozzles and valves are versatile and meet the evolving modern
    farming demands. These specialized components are used in large citrus farms and
    dynamically adjust input application rates based on the fruit load and tree size.
    For larger, leafy trees receive more quantity of pesticide and nutrients, ensuring
    uniform coverage and optimal fruit quality. In contrast, smaller trees require
    less pesticide quantity, preventing the overuse of resources by the use of specialized
    nozzles and valves (Berenstein et al., 2017; Dou et al., 2018, Garcera et al.,
    2017). The varieties of specialized nozzles are discussed in subsequent sections.
    3.2.2. Dual-Nozzle systems for targeted spraying Dual-nozzle systems are distinctive
    because they have two nozzles with different flow rates, allowing targeted and
    synchronized spraying. The dual-nozzle systems used in apple orchards have specialized
    nozzles with distinct spray patterns and droplet sizes (Lu et al., 2022). There
    are two types of nozzles: one designed for spraying leaves and the other for soil-applied
    pesticides. These nozzles are strategically arranged to ensure that inputs are
    precisely delivered to the tree canopy areas. These systems enhance pesticide
    distribution and reduce overlap in pesticide spraying (Lyle et al., 1986). 3.2.3.
    Variable orifice nozzles for adaptive control Variable orifice nozzles precisely
    adjust the diameter of the nozzle orifice using a manual actuator and control
    the flow rate of agricultural inputs, such as fertilizers and insecticides. The
    nozzle can mechanically expand or compress the orifice aperture using a screw
    mechanism or a variable-curvature design, allowing it to rapidly adapt to changing
    needs (Fulton et al., 2016). In more advanced applications, variable-orifice nozzles
    are used with electronic controls. These systems change the orifice diameter in
    real-time in response to the data obtained from sensors or remote-control devices.
    Automated responsiveness to changing conditions in the field and greater precision
    in flow rate changes are two benefits of electronic control (Luck et al., 2015).

    nozzle with its components labeled and (b) actual image of the variable orifice
    nozzle. 3.3. Real-Time monitoring and feedback systems Real-time monitoring and
    feedback systems use a wide range of sensors and actuators to adapt to varying
    field conditions, and the construction of sensors varies depending on the desired
    application (Cruvinel et al., 2016). 3.3.1. Sensors and systems providing Real-Time
    feedback Weather Sensors: These electronic devices include thermometers for recording
    temperature information, hygrometers for tracking humidity, and anemometers for
    measuring wind speed. Designed to endure external elements, they can provide precise
    meteorological data (Kumar et al., 2020). The integration of weather sensors is
    crucial for the real-time decision-making of UASSs. Specialized weather sensors
    are strategically incorporated into the system, continuously monitoring key weather
    parameters, including temperature, humidity, wind speed, and precipitation. For
    instance, the system adjusts spray rates in high temperatures to prevent evaporation,
    ensuring precise delivery. If wind speeds surpass safety thresholds, UASSs alter
    their flight path to prevent overspray. Similarly, precipitation detection prompts
    an automatic suspension of spraying, preserving product efficacy and minimizing
    environmental impact (Faiçal et al., 2014). Sensors for measuring soil moisture:
    These devices are often fabricated using robust components and include probes
    that are buried to gauge the moisture content at different depths, designed for
    extended use in fields, they endure harsh conditions (Alwis et al., 2013, Lekshmi
    et al., 2014). By seamlessly integrating soil moisture sensors, UASSs optimize
    variable-rate spraying strategies based on precise soil conditions. These sensors
    continuously measure soil moisture levels throughout the field, and the data are
    transmitted to the onboard AI-driven system to enable VRS. In areas with low soil
    moisture, the AI system may dynamically increase spray rates to enhance crops’
    water retention and nutrient absorption (Duangsuwan et al., 2020). Fig. 8 refers
    various types of soil moisture sensors, typically compact, cost-effective, and
    precise. Certain models are combined with sensors for soil temperature and salinity,
    while others incorporate dataloggers and radio communication systems for easier
    installation and retrieval in the field (Cahn & LF, 2017). Download : Download

    the integration of various sensors and feedback mechanisms for the implementation
    of smart farming. Smart sensors enable precise monitoring of environmental factors,
    including temperature, moisture, and humidity. Certain sensors are capable of
    evaluating soil quality by measuring nitrate levels and water content. Detection
    of plant diseases and insect pests is achieved through high-resolution cameras.

    sensors for flow rate control Intelligent sensors control flow rate control using
    ML algorithms, deep learning models, and microprocessors by analyzing the incoming
    data. Intelligent sensors can facilitate efficient data transfer to control systems
    by installing wireless communication modules (Paul et al., 2022). Operators can
    remotely adjust these sensors to changing circumstances. For instance, intelligent
    sensors with advanced ML techniques are employed in vineyards to identify potential
    signs of illness or increased insect impact. These sensors can be configured remotely
    and have solid wireless connectivity, allowing for quick and effective flow rate
    control (Talaviya et al., 2020). In regions with lower soil moisture indicative
    of potential dryness stress, the system autonomously increases the flow rate for
    targeted irrigation and optimized nutrient delivery. Conversely, in areas with
    higher soil moisture levels that indicate ample hydration, the system adeptly
    lowers the flow rate, avoids over-application, and conserves resources. 3.3.3.
    Wireless communication for data transmission Wireless communication systems are
    designed for long-range connectivity across a diversified agricultural field,
    transferring real-time data from sensors positioned throughout the field to a
    centralized control unit. They also have redundant data routes and communication
    protocols to ensure reliable data transmission even in challenging conditions.
    Data sent across wireless communication technologies are encoded to prevent unauthorized
    access, and a reliable safety feature is included in their design (Feng et al.,
    2019). Fig. 10 shows a wireless communication-based data transmission system designed
    for crop health monitoring in conjunction with remote sensing (Shafi et al., 2019).

    Fig. 10. Wireless communication-based data transmission system. For instance,
    the integration of radio frequency (RF) and satellite-based wireless communication
    ensures seamless data transmission and enhanced precision of variable-rate applications.
    With its diverse frequency bands and reliable short-range capabilities, RF communication
    facilitates direct line-of-sight data exchange between the UASS and the ground
    control station (Proshkin et al., 2021). This proves advantageous in scenarios
    where real-time updates on crop conditions are vital for dynamic decision-making
    during the flight. Simultaneously, satellite-based communication provides a broader
    reach, particularly in remote or expansive agricultural areas where traditional
    communication infrastructure may be lacking. Leveraging satellite links, UASSs
    used for VRS can transmit real-time data to and from the ground control system.
    This global connectivity ensures continuous and uninterrupted communication, allowing
    respective systems to make instantaneous adjustments to the VRS parameters based
    on the latest information received from the field (Islam et al., 2021, Matese
    et al., 2015, Radoglou-Grammatikis et al., 2020). 3.3.4. Closed-Loop control systems
    for dynamic adjustments Closed-loop control systems integrate hardware and software
    for real-time dynamic adjustments to the flow rate. These systems are equipped
    with highly advanced software that consolidates information from various sources
    and sensors for real-time analysis and decision-making. Hardware components, such
    as controllers and actuators, endure environmental conditions and ensure accurate
    and swift changes to flow rate. Adaptive algorithms are a feature of closed-loop
    control systems, allowing them to adjust to the temporal variation in agricultural
    field conditions. These algorithms are designed to be efficient and adaptable.
    In large-scale potato farming, these systems are used with advanced software,
    such as Agrosense, which uses data from meteorological stations to adjust the
    flow rates (Katamreddy et al., 2019, Kruize et al., 2014). These systems operate
    dynamically owing to the closed-loop structure and continuously refine decisions
    based on the latest data inputs. This results in a responsive and adaptive approach
    to VRS, where the UASS becomes an agile decision-making entity, finely tuning
    its actions to the specific needs of each part of the field. Closed-loop control
    systems incorporate several sensors on the UASS, capturing data on crop health,
    soil conditions, and environmental factors (Hafeez et al., 2023, Hao et al., 2022).
    As the flight traverses the field, the closed-loop system processes these data
    and compares them against predefined parameters (Faiçal et al., 2017). 3.3.5.
    Integration with Unmanned aerial vehicle navigation for precise delivery Unmanned
    aerial vehicle (UAV) navigation systems have sophisticated algorithms and GPS
    technology, enabling precise navigation in specific areas. The design of these
    systems guarantees accurate placement and movement control (Maddikunta et al.,
    2021). The real-time communication between flow rate control systems and UAVs
    forms the foundation of their integration. Strong communication links are incorporated
    into these systems to ensure uninterrupted contact throughout the navigation process.
    Dynamic adjustment algorithms are built into the flow rate control systems and
    UAV navigation systems, allowing for real-time adjustments to flow rates based
    on data and feedback. For instance, in a large-scale soybean farm, this integration
    ensures that UAVs use real-time data and GPS coordinates to dynamically adjust
    the pace at which pesticides are sprayed as they explore different field portions.
    This design optimizes resource utilization and increases crop yield by enabling
    precise distribution to specific locations (Garre and Harish, 2018, Xue et al.,
    2016). 4. Data-Driven approaches for flow rate control 4.1. AI in flow rate control
    Precision agriculture now relies significantly on AI (Bhat et al., 2021), particularly
    for flow rate control. AI technologies improve the distribution of agricultural
    inputs, ensuring they target crops with unprecedented precision and reduce waste.
    ML can regulate the flow rate of pesticides and herbicides based on real-time
    data using trained algorithms for efficient spraying and reduced costs. 4.1.1.
    Application of ML algorithms 4.1.1.1. Supervised learning for flow rate prediction
    Precision agriculture extensively uses supervised learning (Sharma et al., 2021),
    particularly for predicting the ideal pesticide and fertilizer spraying flow rates.
    Crop-specific models are a notable application of this technology, which are finely
    tuned to meet the crop needs (Alam et al., 2020). For instance, a supervised learning
    model is developed for soybean cultivation using historical data and real-time
    insights. This model considers crop development phases, meteorological circumstances,
    insect frequency, and indications of the health of individual plants (Yoosefzadeh-Najafabadi
    et al., 2020). Based on the continuous integration of data from weather stations,
    aerial vehicles, and gauges, the model forecasts precise flow rates required for
    accurate pesticide application. Supervised ML involves collecting extensive datasets
    containing crop types, vegetation indices, weather conditions, and historical
    spraying records. These datasets are used to train the machine-learning model
    (Guo et al., 2020). For instance, the model is trained to recognize patterns correlating
    specific vegetation indices with optimal pesticide concentrations. The algorithm
    refines its internal parameters based on the provided dataset during training.
    It learns to identify intricate relations between input features and the desired
    output, which, in the context of VRS, could be the optimal flow rate and spray
    pattern for a given set of field conditions (Patil et al., 2023). 4.1.1.2. Unsupervised
    learning for pattern recognition Unsupervised learning is a data-driven method
    that can provide insights into complicated farming systems for pattern detection
    (Liakos et al., 2018). Focused, precise farming techniques can be implemented
    based on this approach by identifying minute correlations and trends in agricultural
    data, ensuring efficient resource utilization, and minimizing ecological impacts
    (Priya et al., 2020). Unsupervised learning is commonly used for cultivating row
    crops to identify weed trends across farms, particularly for maize and soybeans
    (Louargant et al., 2018). The differences in plant density and colors are analyzed
    using the information collected by sensors and UAVs. By identifying weed clusters
    and their sequences of dispersion, the system can initiate concentrated pesticide
    applications (Gnädinger et al., 2017). Unsupervised ML techniques, particularly
    clustering algorithms such as k-means, are used to segment the agricultural field
    into distinct zones based on similarities in environmental characteristics. The
    algorithm autonomously identify patterns in the data and segments the field without
    any guidance (Badapanda et al., 2022). Unlike supervised learning, unsupervised
    learning operates without predefined output labels. In the context of VRS, the
    algorithm adapts to the variabilities of the field. 4.1.2. Ai-based optimization
    of flow rates 4.1.2.1. Neural network models for adaptive control While predictive
    models are not the sole focus of AI, adaptive control systems can dynamically
    adjust flow rates based on real-time conditions. Disease detection in vineyards
    is revolutionizing owing to neural network models, particularly CNN. Real-time
    information from multispectral cameras installed on UAVs is processed using these
    models, particularly for early disease detection (Tsouros et al., 2019). By analyzing
    the multispectral camera images, symptoms such as powdery mildew on grapevines
    can be detected (Knauer et al., 2017). When a disease is identified, the dynamic
    spray system accurately applies pesticides to the affected regions. This reduces
    the amount of chemicals used and ensures good health of the harvested grapes,
    a crucial factor for producing high-quality wines (Hao et al., 2022). 4.1.2.2.
    Reinforcement learning in precision spraying Reinforcement learning is revolutionizing
    precision spraying, particularly in Weed management, by enabling decision-making
    regarding the use of insecticides and other chemicals using real-time information
    and feedback (Gautron et al., 2022). UASSs that use reinforcement learning algorithms
    are used in cotton plantations to modify herbicide treatment rates based on the
    assessment of weed concentration. This continuous adaptation ensures efficient
    weed control while minimizing the use of pesticides. It represents an innovative,
    method of optimizing flow rates, ensuring pesticides are applied only when necessary
    and reducing their adverse effects on the ecosystem (Gao et al., 2019). 4.2. Integration
    of remote sensing data 4.2.1. Incorporating UAV-Collected data for precision spraying
    decisions Precision spraying decision-making depends on data, such as remote sensing
    data, particularly for flow rate control (Huang et al., 2018). This approach integrates
    advanced technology and data analytics. UAVs are equipped with advanced sensors
    that capture real-time data related to crop health, pest infestations, and soil
    conditions (Jia et al., 2021). This unique data collected during each flight serve
    as the foundation for data-driven decisions that optimize VRS. 4.2.1.1. Multispectral
    data for crop health Multispectral cameras equipped with UAVs gather real-time
    data on the field by capturing spectral bands corresponding to distinct plant
    properties (Deng et al., 2018). Fig. 11 (a) shows a UAV equipped with a multispectral
    camera for crop health monitoring (De Oca et al., 2018), (b) illustrates the integration
    of the multispectral camera, thermal camera, Red, Green and Blue (RGB) camera,
    and global navigation satellite system (GNSS) with the Raspberry Pi, while (c)

    System (DAS) (Xu et al., 2021). Download : Download high-res image (819KB) Download

    system: (a) UAV equipped with a multi-spectral camera for crop health assessment,
    (b) components integrated with Raspberry Pi, and (c) assembly of components forming
    the DAS. The information gathered by these cameras are analyzed for flow rate
    control. AI software such as Agisoft Metashape or Pix4D are used to process multispectral
    data. These software programs have built-in ML algorithms developed based on extensive
    datasets and can identify signatures associated with various factors, including
    crop health, insect frequency, and nutritional deficits (Wang et al., 2021). For
    instance, software such as Agisoft Metashape analyzes multispectral data, while
    a UAV with a multispectral camera hovers over the crops. Depending on these spectral
    characteristics, field areas with increased insect populations or nutritional
    deficits are identified (Velusamy et al., 2021). The AI models of the software
    then adjust the flow rates of connected sprayers based on the previous processed
    image data (Linhui et al., 2019). This data-driven method reduces waste, maximizes
    crop health, and minimizes negative environmental impact. Fig. 12 shows a multispectral
    camera based system for crop health monitoring (a) shows the autonomous UAV used

    multispectral imaging system: (a) UAV equipped with all the necessary components
    for capturing multispectral images, and (b) a near infrared (NIR) aerial image

    4.2.1.2. Hyperspectral imaging for disease detection In VRS, hyperspectral imaging
    is used for early disease detection in crops. Hyperspectral cameras capture data
    in numerous narrow spectral bands, providing highly detailed information about
    the field condition (Moghadam et al., 2017), which are used for disease detection.
    Fig. 13 shows the hyperspectral imaging used for the disease detection, (a) shows
    the visual representation of a fungal plant disease, and (b) illustrates spikelets
    caused by Fusarium head blight, detected using hyperspectral imaging (Mahlein,
    2016). Download : Download high-res image (353KB) Download : Download full-size
    image Fig. 13. Visual representation of (a) fungal plant disease and (b) detection
    of spikelets caused by Fusarium head blight using hyperspectral imaging. The data
    collected via hyperspectral imaging are processed using advanced AI models and
    specialized software, such as MATLAB and ENVI. The solutions are designed to recognize
    spectral patterns associated with various diseases, enabling early disease detection
    (Li et al., 2022). After the hyperspectral images are captured, the software analyzes
    the data, identifying potential disease patterns in the field. With the help of
    integrated software, the system initiates targeted spraying to the affected areas
    (Khan et al., 2021). This precise approach optimizes disease control and minimizes
    the need for excessive chemical application. 4.2.2. Fusion of sensor data for
    enhanced Decision-Making For VRS, the data obtained from various sensors are integrated
    to understand the field condition and ensuring the precise decision-making and
    application of pesticides and fertilizers (Zanin et al., 2022). 4.2.2.1. Combining
    Light detection and ranging data for terrain mapping Light detection and ranging
    (LiDAR) technology captures precise 3D terrain data (Lin et al., 2021, Lin and
    Habib, 2021). The LiDAR data are processed in real-time using specialized software,
    such as Ag Leader SMS (Feng et al., 2019), which uses AI-driven algorithms to
    create an accurate 3D terrain map of the field. This map is used for calculating
    the variable rate prescription for each section of the field based on elevation
    variations (Potena et al., 2019). Fig. 14(a) shows a UAV-based system mounted
    with LiDAR system for terrain mapping (Banerjee et al., 2019). Fig. 14(b) shows
    the UAV-based mobile mapping system for the collection of the LiDAR data in a
    forest plantation under various leaf cover scenarios (Lin et al., 2021, Lin and
    Habib, 2021). Download : Download high-res image (341KB) Download : Download full-size

    for terrain mapping and (b) UAV-based mobile mapping system for collecting LiDAR
    data in a forest plantation under various leaf cover scenarios. This integration
    of LiDAR data guarantees that the spraying operation is finely tuned to the field
    topography (Ahmed et al., 2021), leading to minimized resource usage and optimized
    agricultural yields. 4.2.2.2. Integration with UASS navigation for precise delivery
    in VRS UASS navigation systems use AI-driven control software to ensure accurate
    and efficient spraying of pesticides and fertilizers. UASS is equipped with a
    GNSS and can perform highly accurate positioning and path planning. Integrating
    these navigation systems and RTK-GPS, such as Trimble’s RTK systems or DJI’s D-RTK
    GNSS, provides centimeter-level accuracy (Andanaputra et al., 2020). Flight planning
    and control software, such as Pix4D is also used to plan precise flight paths
    and manage respective operations (Hasheminasab et al., 2020). As the system follows
    the defined flight path, the AI-driven control software, often integrated into
    the flight controller or a companion computer, considers the specific variable
    rate prescription for each field section. For instance, the software might use
    a proprietary algorithm developed by the user to precisely activate and deactivate
    the payload such as a sprayer or dispenser. This ensures that the right amount
    of pesticide or fertilizer is delivered to match the field requirements (Agurob
    et al., 2023). 5. Case studies and applications 5.1. Real-World implementations
    of VRS with UASS The combined use of VRS and UASS has garnered significant recognition
    for its effectiveness in various agricultural settings. This section will investigate
    real-world applications of VRS, scrutinizing specific examples and the outcomes
    derived from deploying UASS in precision agriculture. 5.1.1. Examples of successful
    applications Lian et al. (2019) proposed a real-time control method for controlling
    the flow rate of an agricultural UAV spray system. The method used a single-chip
    microcomputer and micro diaphragm pump to precisely control the pump’s flow rate
    in real-time, enabling VRS based on different operating conditions. The system’s
    response speed was evaluated, demonstrating average control response and stability
    times of 0.18 and 0.75 s for pump flow changes. These results indicate that the
    system effectively responds to changes in operating conditions and can quickly
    adjust the pump’s target flow, achieving precise VRS. Thus, VRS systems can be
    implemented in agricultural UAVs. Liu et al. (2020) proposed a real-time control
    system for UAV VRS that uses a mathematical model to correlate flight speed, flight
    height, spray concentration, nozzle voltage, and spray volume, providing a theoretical
    foundation for research on aerial variable spray. Experimental results demonstrate
    its effectiveness in accurately calculating spray volume based on parameter changes
    such as flight speed and height, maintaining a consistent spray concentration
    across farmland. This system effectively addressed uneven spray issues caused
    by fluctuating flight parameters by adjusting the real-time spray concentration
    to meet varying application needs and minimized pesticide waste due to over application
    of pesticides and under application. The system enhances spray accuracy, lays
    the groundwork for precision spraying, and reduces manual intervention, thereby
    improving application efficiency. Fig. 15 shows a VRS system along with conceptual

    Schematic of the hardware control system for the spraying. Wang et al. (2016)
    developed a pulse with modulation (PWM)-based VRS system. Droplet deposition was
    studied using the droplet concentration method while the UAV hovered under controllable
    multi-speed conditions. The system comprises an airborne spraying device, ground
    measurement, and control unit. The airborne spraying device, equipped with the
    STM32F103VC MCU, was remotely controlled by the ground measurement and control
    unit developed by LabWindows/CVI through a wireless data transmission module.
    The micro-electric diaphragm pump was controlled using a square wave of 10 Hz
    and an adjustable duty ratio. Then, the pressure and flow rate of the system were
    adjusted. Experiments were conducted under various distance and wind speed conditions
    to establish the relation between deposition volume, duty ratio, nozzle type,
    and the rotating speed of the centrifugal nozzle. Fig. 16 shows the PWM-based
    VRS system, (a) six rotor UAV used for VRS, (b) shows the spray nozzle with its

    VRS system to address the varying severity of plant diseases and insect pests
    in different locations. The system used a STMicroelectronics-32 (STM32) chip as
    the control system core and used a sensor to obtain real-time prescription values
    from prescription diagrams. A variable duty cycle pulse square wave was generated
    to adjust the flow rate, and a closed-loop PID control algorithm was employed
    to minimize the settling time of the system. Experimental results demonstrated
    that the system maintained a stable flow rate within 2.16 % of the target value,
    enabling VRS for diverse requirements. Here, the 2.16 % value signifies the system''s
    consistent achievement of a flow rate very close to the intended target, highlighting
    its precision in adapting to diverse requirements. This narrow deviation underscores
    the system’s effectiveness in responding to varying severity of plant diseases
    and insect pests in different locations. Outdoor tests confirmed the effectiveness
    of the system in promptly adjusting the flow rate based on prescription map values,
    maintaining consistent droplet deposition, and achieving uniform deposition density
    within the operation unit. Fig. 17 shows the UASS based VRS system, (a) shows

    and benefits in precision agriculture VRS and UASS have transformed precision
    agriculture. VRS facilitates targeted spraying by leveraging UASS, allowing farmers
    to optimize crop health management practices (Ahmad et al., 2020). This newfound
    precision enhanced farm productivity, thereby improving yields and crop quality
    (Mogili et al., 2018). UASS-based VRS is ecofriendly as it reduces pesticide consumption
    and has targeted application, aligning with global sustainable farming practices.
    UASS-based VRS is a catalyst for enhanced crop yields and a contributor to sustainable
    agriculture (Wen et al., 2019). 5.1.3. Specialty Crops: Optimizing pest control
    Specialty crops, ranging from delicate berries to high-value vegetables, demand
    customized pest management solutions. The uniform application of pesticides, a
    common practice in conventional agriculture, is inadequate for these diverse crops
    due to variations in plant size, spacing, and vulnerability to specific pests
    (Warneke et al., 2021). For precise and targeted pest control, UASS-based VRS
    can be used. UASS seamlessly adapts to the unique challenges of pest control in
    specialty crops. For instance, in vineyards where grapevines demand meticulous
    attention, UASS equipped with sophisticated sensors skillfully navigates intricate
    terrains, enabling the precise delivery of pesticides (Becce et al., 2021). This
    targeted approach not only optimizes the efficacy of pest control measures but
    also minimizes environmental impact by considerably reducing the overall volume
    of pesticides used. The versatility of VRS is exemplified in orchards with diverse
    topography. UAV equipped with high-resolution cameras and cutting-edge imaging
    capabilities can effectively pinpoint areas that require treatment, thereby maximizing
    resource efficiency and minimizing the risk of affecting non-targeted areas (Dubuis
    et al., 2023). This ability to adapt to varying conditions highlights the transformative
    potential of UASS-based VRS in optimizing orchard pest control practices. 5.2.
    Benefits and outcomes in precision agriculture 5.2.1. Increased crop yields and
    quality UASS-based VRS has revolutionized precision agriculture with its ability
    to optimize inputs for maximizing outputs (Delavarpour et al., 2021). Precision
    spraying, tailored to the specific needs of individual plants, mitigates the risks
    associated with pesticide underdosing and overdosing, offering a critical advantage
    in row crops (Pawase et al., 2023). Equipped with advanced sensors, UASS navigates
    the intricate spacing between plants in row crops, ensuring that each plant receives
    the optimal amount of treatment (Shi et al., 2016). Precision agriculture primarily
    focuses on enhancing the quality of agricultural products, and precise application
    of pesticides plays a pivotal role in achieving this goal. In vineyards, for example,
    the UASS equipped with high-resolution cameras precisely traverses the terrain,
    delivering targeted treatments that eliminate pests while minimizing chemical
    residues on grapes. This not only safeguards the quality of the crop but also
    aligns with consumer demand for sustainably produced and residue-free agricultural
    products (Chancia et al., 2021). 5.2.2. Reduced pesticide and resource usage The
    UASS does not rely solely on real-time environmental conditions but leverages
    pre- and post-flight data analytics during decision-making (Hunter et al., 2020).
    This comprehensive approach uses historical data and ML algorithms to optimize
    pesticide application based on a deep understanding of crop health and environmental
    conditions. Thus, UAS-based VRS effectively reduces pesticide usage without compromising
    on effectiveness (Chen et al., 2021). The integration of UASS and VRS in agriculture
    can catalyze holistic resource optimization. This strategic merging of technology
    and farming practices fosters a sustainable future where the responsible use of
    pesticides and resources becomes a cornerstone of modern agriculture (Seelan et
    al., 2003). 5.2.3. Environmental sustainability UASS is a safer, more efficient,
    and more precise alternative to traditional pesticide application methods. Farmers
    can considerably reduce the risk of exposure to harmful chemicals and minimize
    physical damage to crops by applying pesticides using drones (Damalas et al.,
    2011). Additionally, the UASS can effectively spray small, irregularly shaped
    fields that would be challenging or impossible to reach with ground sprayers or
    conventional agricultural aircraft (Wirawan et al., 2022). This technology is
    particularly beneficial for reducing the risk of pesticide contamination, particularly
    among applicators that rely on backpack sprayers (Morales-Rodríguez et al., 2022).
    Traditional pesticide application methods often require multiple tractors to pass
    through fields, increasing fuel consumption and emissions. UAS targets specific
    areas of a field, which considerably reduces the need of using a tractor; thus,
    UAS-based VRS is an ecofriendly alternative and sustainable (Mukherjee et al.,
    2019, Wang et al., 2020). 5.3. Technical considerations Despite its remarkable
    advancements, UASS-based VRS faces several challenges. This section delves into
    the technical, regulatory, and practical challenges encountered during its real-world
    implementation, providing valuable insights from these experiences. 5.3.1. Technical
    challenges faced in Real-World applications Sensor limitations pose a significant
    challenge to the implementation of VRS with UASS. The effectiveness of data collection
    devices is crucial because the spatial and spectral resolutions of sensors directly
    impact the precision of VRS (Lee et al., 2010). These challenges can be addressed
    by developing sensors with higher resolutions, improved accuracy, and broader
    spectral bandwidths (Basso et al., 2019). Agricultural landscapes present unique
    navigation challenges, necessitating advanced algorithms for path planning and
    obstacle avoidance to navigate diverse and dynamic environments. The demand for
    precise and adaptable navigation systems has propelled ongoing research to enhance
    the UASS autonomy, ensuring efficient and safe operation in the field (Vazquez-Carmona
    et al., 2022). The inherent variability of agricultural environments poses challenges
    in ensuring consistent and reliable operation for VRS. Factors such as fluctuating
    wind speeds and varying humidity levels can impact the accuracy of pesticide application.
    To address these challenges, environmental dynamics must be understood and adaptive
    systems that can respond to real-time changes in field conditions must be developed
    (Faiçal et al., 2017). 5.3.2. Regulatory compliance and safety considerations
    In the rapidly evolving field of precision agriculture, the UASS can potentially
    revolutionize agricultural practices. However, the integration of these innovations
    into existing regulatory frameworks poses a significant challenge (Rao et al.,
    2016). The dynamic nature of UASS often surpasses the pace of regulatory updates,
    necessitating adaptability and collaboration among industry stakeholders and regulatory
    bodies. Safety considerations are paramount in VRS as they form a crucial aspect
    of regulatory compliance. To ensure technological and personnel safety, aviation
    regulations, airspace restrictions, and effective risk mitigation strategies must
    be thoroughly understood (Ayamga et al., 2021). 5.3.3. Farmer adoption and training
    Technological advancements, cultural norms, and educational initiatives are a
    few factors that determine the adoption of UASS-based VRS. Farmers, the primary
    users of this transformative technology, hold the key to its widespread adoption.
    The initial stages of adoption are often met with hesitation, primarily due to
    unfamiliarity with the technology, concerns about its financial viability, and
    reluctance to deviate from established farming practices (Bai et al., 2022). The
    effectiveness of precision agriculture is influenced by farmers who have their
    own experiences and technological proficiency. By conducting training programs,
    farmers can adopt and benefit from this technology (Daberkow et al., 2003). For
    the long-term adoption of the UASS, farmers should be provided with continuous
    support mechanisms such as regular software updates, readily accessible troubleshooting
    resources, and easily contactable support channels that can instill confidence
    and promote self-sufficiency among farmers. Additionally, collaborative efforts
    between technology providers, agricultural extension services, and local communities
    can play a pivotal role in facilitating the adoption of UASS-based VRS into agricultural
    practices (Klauser et al., 2021). 5.3.4. Integration with crop monitoring and
    phenotyping Empowered by advanced sensors, UAVs have revolutionized crop monitoring,
    enabling high-resolution data acquisition in real-time. These drones are equipped
    with multispectral and hyperspectral sensors and provide farmers an unprecedented
    understanding of crop health, growth patterns, and potential stress factors (Lu
    et al., 2020, Tao et al., 2020). Following this comprehensive monitoring, UASS
    seamlessly transitions into VRS based on the prescription map acquired from UAV
    monitoring for precise and adaptable pesticide applications (Chia et al., 2020).
    Phenotyping, a cornerstone of modern agriculture, thoroughly evaluates plant traits
    and characteristics. UAVs play a pivotal role in phenotyping by capturing high-resolution
    imagery and multispectral data (Xie and Yang, 2020, Yang et al., 2017), providing
    farmers with valuable insights into plant health, stress responses, and genetic
    traits. 6. Challenges and future directions 6.1. Current challenges in flow rate
    control While UASS-based VRS holds promise, it encounters specific challenges
    such as sensor accuracy, data integration, and power management, which are crucial
    for its successful implementation in precision agriculture. This section delves
    into the intricate nuances of flow rate control and explores innovations that
    have potential to revolutionize precision agriculture. Further research and development
    are imperative to tackle the multifaceted challenges posed by precision agriculture
    demands in flow rate control in flow rate control. 6.1.1. Sensor accuracy and
    reliability For efficient VRS, high accuracy and reliability of sensors must be
    ensured. However, maintaining this precision within dynamic agricultural environments
    is difficult. Sensor drift and environmental influences on the sensor can be mitigated
    by sensor calibration. Advanced sensor materials, characterized by their excellent
    stability and resilience to external factors, are garnering research attention.
    Such materials will enable sensors to consistently and accurately acquire data
    over extended durations (Yadav et al., 2023). Sensors can drift over time, deviating
    from their calibrated state and introducing inconsistencies in data acquisition.
    Although sensor calibration is a fundamental element to ensure sensor accuracy,
    it presents significant challenges (Luo et al., 2023). Maintaining calibration
    efficacy in dynamic agricultural environments, characterized by fluctuating temperature,
    humidity, and other environmental parameters, is a persistent effort (Srbinovska
    et al., 2015). 6.1.2. Integration of multiple sensors The seamless integration
    of diverse sensor modalities into the flow rate control framework is challenging,
    which stems from the inherent heterogeneity of sensors used in precision agriculture.
    To harmoniously combine these sensors for VRS, cutting-edge technological innovations
    and deeper understanding of their intricate dynamics are crucial (Zhuang et al.,
    2023). The practical implementation of sensor fusion in VRS necessitates the seamless
    integration of diverse technologies. From the conventional optics capturing the
    visible spectrum to the advanced multispectral and hyperspectral sensors unveiling
    hidden biophysical properties, each sensor plays a unique and vital role in the
    composition (Anastasiou et al., 2023). LiDAR and radar add further depth and dimension,
    providing crucial data on terrain and vegetation structure (Ahmad et al., 2022).
    However, the real-time synchronization of disparate data streams, robust processing
    capabilities, and the construction of a unified and coherent dataset demand innovative
    solutions and a profound understanding of the strengths and limitations of each
    sensor (Camilli et al., 2007). 6.1.3. Power consumption and UASS payload constraints
    To ensure optimal performance of VRS systems in precision agriculture, the intricate
    power–payload challenge must be addressed. To this end, the energy efficiency
    of sensors and associated technologies must be maximized while ensuring sufficient
    payload capacity for extended UASS flight durations. The operational longevity
    of UASS depends on the energy efficiency (Wang et al., 2019). for which finite-capacity
    batteries must be replaced with energy-efficient technologies. Balancing power
    consumption and payload is important during extended missions, where achieving
    equilibrium between operational demands and available power reserves is paramount
    (Martin et al., 2022). 6.2. Regulatory considerations To successfully integrate
    UASS into precision agriculture, regulatory compliance must be ensured such that
    technological advancements align with the dynamic and evolving regulatory landscape
    governing pesticide spraying operations in agriculture (Giles, 2016). 6.2.1. Compliance
    with pesticide application regulations While revolutionizing crop management practices,
    precision agriculture introduces a complex regulatory consideration, particularly
    for pesticide application. Ensuring adherence to stringent regulations poses a
    significant challenge, demanding a seamless integration of precision spraying
    techniques with meticulous data recording, reporting, and analysis procedures
    (Petty & Chang, 2018). Moreover, robust data-driven tracking and validation systems
    are required to monitor compliance with pesticide application regulations. These
    systems must capture a comprehensive range of data, including pesticide type,
    application rate, target area, and environmental conditions. This data must then
    be meticulously analyzed to ensure compliance with regulatory standards and optimize
    spraying practices (Lewis et al., 1997). 6.2.2. Privacy and data security concerns
    The collection and utilization of vast amounts of agricultural data pose privacy
    and data security concerns (Kumar et al., 2021), therefore, a holistic approach
    to risk mitigation and responsible data handling practices such as robust data
    encryption methods, secure data transmission protocols, and transparent data management
    practices are required (Gupta et al., 2020). Ongoing developments in privacy-preserving
    technologies, such as federated learning and secure data aggregation, aim to strike
    a nuanced balance between data utility and individual privacy in precision agriculture
    (Chhikara et al., 2021). Regulatory frameworks need to evolve alongside these
    technological advancements, incorporating comprehensive guidelines that ensure
    data integrity while promoting the responsible use of agricultural data. Establishing
    clear standards for data anonymization and de-identification further contributes
    to building a regulatory environment that fosters innovation while safeguarding
    sensitive individual information (Dara et al., 2022). 6.3. Future innovations
    and developments Emerging challenges and related solutions must be understood
    to effectively manage flow rate control in UASS-based VRS. The future of precision
    agriculture is primed for transformative advancements driven by innovative solutions
    that will reshape the VRS landscape. Several approaches for flow rate control
    are being developed, paving the way for enhanced efficiency, sustainability, and
    precision in agricultural practices. 6.3.1. Advancements in sensor technology
    Precision agriculture depends on the precision and reliability of sensors. Studies
    are being conducted to expand sensor technology (Bogue, 2017), for enhanced data
    collection and optimized decision-making in UASS-based VRS applications. Nanoscale
    sensors can revolutionize data collection in precision agriculture and are garnering
    attention (Duhan et al., 2017). Microscopic sensors operating at the molecular
    level exhibit high sensitivity and responsiveness, facilitating real-time data
    acquisition with minimal environmental interference (Manjunatha et al., 2016).
    Leveraging their nanoscale and microscopic dimensions, along with their enhanced
    sensitivity, these sensors will enable more precise monitoring of environmental
    conditions and crop health, thereby enhancing the quality of VRS decisions. Furthermore,
    these sensors assist in mitigating challenges associated with sensor drift and
    calibration, allowing more accurate and reliable flow rate control in UASS-based
    VRS applications. Multispectral and hyperspectral sensors are undergoing transformative
    enhancements, revolutionizing data collection and decision-making in precision
    agriculture (Di Gennaro et al., 2022). The spectral range of these sensors will
    be expanded to comprehensively and intricately understand crop conditions. Advanced
    multispectral sensors can also be used to assess plant physiological parameters
    (Wang et al., 2018) and adjust flow rates based on crop health indicators. This
    approach will enhance the precision and efficacy of VRS and facilitate proactive
    and targeted pest management strategies. It will also optimize resource use and
    minimize environmental impact (Radoglou-Grammatikis et al., 2020). 6.3.2. Ai-driven
    flow rate optimization AI is being widely used for optimizing flow rate control.
    AI-powered algorithms integrate self-learning and adaptive capabilities into UASSs
    to enable faster decision-making in precision agriculture (Huang et al., 2018).
    ML models are continuously trained using vast datasets containing diverse environmental
    conditions, which empower UASSs to adjust flow rates based on crop requirements
    using prescription maps (Khan et al., 2021). Hyperspectral images offer a wealth
    of data on crop health and nutrient needs for every point in a field. Fig. 18
    refers to the UAV based DAS used by Kuswidiyanto et al. (2023), in their study
    for the detection of downy mildew in kimchi cabbage. Download : Download high-res

    capturing images and (b) images acquired of the respective study field, i.e.,
    kimchi cabbage, using the hyperspectral camera and the high resolution RGB camera.
    Later on, different models are trained based on the augmented dataset obtained
    from the prior study using UAV based DAS. The disease prediction results of the
    studied area can be obtained based on these models. These results can then serve
    as a prescription map for the UASS to optimize the pesticide flow rate according
    to the field’s requirement. Fig. 19 shows the aerial hyperspectral imaging, (a)
    shows the studied area for disease detection, while (b) and (c) refers to the
    prediction results of the respective studied area. In these figures, the green
    areas represent healthy plants, while the red areas indicate disease plants in
    the field (Kuswidiyanto et al., 2023).Hyperspectral images provide information
    on crop health and nutrient needs for every point in an agricultural field. However,
    due to limitations for real time analyzing the field and adjusting the flow rates
    in drone technology, directly applying fertilizer to each pixel is not feasible.
    Thus, image analysis must be performed to segment images into larger, workable
    zones (raster segments) such that the drone efficiently distributes fertilizers
    based on the requirements (Yu et al., 2022). Fig. 20 shows hyperspectral imaging-based
    system in conjunction with prescription details (a) refers to the fertilizer prescription
    chart for the agricultural drones, while (b) shows the experimental setup for
    the agricultural drone with the prescription map used in their study.This adaptability
    allows UASS to respond swiftly and effectively to changing crop health indicators.
    Predictive modeling, fueled by AI, facilitates proactive flow rate adjustments,
    minimizing the reliance on preset parameters and enhancing the overall efficiency
    and effectiveness of pesticide application. Therefore, AI is used to not only
    optimize flow rate control but also catalyze autonomous decision-making capabilities
    during VRS missions (Liu et al., 2020). Download : Download high-res image (487KB)

    a precision instrument, enables targeted pesticide applications tailored to individual
    crop requirements. This shift in pest management simplifies and enhances farming
    operations, enabling farmers to apply pesticides with greater precision and respond
    promptly to pest outbreaks. Such an approach minimizes waste and maximizes the
    efficacy of pest management, fostering a sustainable and resource-efficient agricultural
    landscape. The implications of UASS-based VRS reach beyond technological innovation,
    signaling a transformative moment where precision, sustainability, economic viability,
    and technological progress converge to redefine modern agriculture.. In this narrative,
    the UASS transcends its role as a mere tool, emerging as a transformative force
    driving agriculture towards unparalleled precision, environmental stewardship,
    and remarkable resilience. CRediT authorship contribution statement Abbas Taseer:

  description: In the midst of rising global population and environmental challenges,
    smart agriculture emerges as a vital solution by integrating advanced technologies
    to optimize agricultural practices. Through data-driven insights and automation,
    it tackles the necessity for sustainable resource management, enhancing productivity
    and resilience in the face of complex food security and ecological concerns. The
    prospects of utilizing the Internet of Things (IoT) for smart agriculture are
    tremendous, where many IoT devices can be deployed for local environment monitoring,
    precision farming, autonomous irrigation, and, soil management. In some use cases
    like smart monitoring and agrochemical applications, UAV-enabled mobile-edge computing
    (MEC) is proposed as an enabler to provide IoT nodes with additional resources
    by hosting their computation functions. From the implementation perspective, to
    flexibly manage the computation functions in UAVs and/or MEC server, the emerging
    network function virtualization (NFV) can be utilized. However, efficient orchestration
    of the virtualized functions would be a challenge. In this paper, we consider
    a decentralized UAV-aided MEC system for smart agricultural applications in which
    the processing nodes benefit from the NFV technology. We aim to propose a method
    for efficiently orchestrating the NFVs while some important metrics are minimized,
    i.e., the age of information (AoI) and total network energy consumption. Especially,
    we consider the case in which the network state is not fully observable to the
    orchestrator or the observations are exposed to uncertainties. Consequently, the
    problem is formulated as a decentralized partially observable Markov decision
    process (DEC-POMDP). As the formulated problem is NP-complete, we exploit some
    structural features of the proposed scheme to introduce the concept of symmetry
    and simplify the problem. Then, a novel decentralized federated learning-based
    solution is proposed to solve the problem. Simulation results show the effectiveness
    of the proposed approach in minimizing the total network energy consumption and
    achieving AoI values less than 200:msec to support demanding real-time applications.

    In the midst of rising global population and environmental challenges, smart agriculture
    emerges as a vital solution by integrating advanced technologies to optimize agricultural
    practices. Through data-driven insights and automation, it tackles the necessity
    for sustainable resource management, enhancing productivity and resilience in
    the face of complex food security and ecological concerns. The prospects of utilizing
    the Internet of Things (IoT) for smart agriculture are tremendous, where many
    IoT devices can be deployed for local environment monitoring, precision farming,
    autonomous irrigation, and, soil management. In some use cases like smart monitoring
    and agrochemical applications, UAV-enabled mobile-edge computing (MEC) is proposed
    as an enabler to provide IoT nodes with additional resources by hosting their
    computation functions. From the implementation perspective, to flexibly manage
    the computation functions in UAVs and/or MEC server, the emerging network function
    virtualization (NFV) can be utilized. However, efficient orchestration of the
    virtualized functions would be a challenge. In this paper, we consider a decentralized
    UAV-aided MEC system for smart agricultural applications in which the processing
    nodes benefit from the NFV technology. We aim to propose a method for efficiently
    orchestrating the NFVs while some important metrics are minimized, i.e., the age
    of information (AoI) and total network energy consumption. Especially, we consider
    the case in which the network state is not fully observable to the orchestrator
    or the observations are exposed to uncertainties. Consequently, the problem is

    IEEE Funding Agency: SECTION I. Introduction Smart farming in the contemporary
    world has gained paramount importance while playing a pivotal role in revolutionizing
    agricultural practices [1]. Conversely, the increasing global population along
    with environmental challenges have made the adoption of smart farming techniques
    indispensable. By leveraging data-driven insights, automation, and precision agriculture,
    smart farming not only enhances productivity but also addresses the pressing need
    for sustainable resource management [2]. On the other hand, the Internet of Things
    (IoT) has been a promising technology to provide connection among a large volume
    of devices that are deployed to provide a specific service for smart agriculture.
    A wide range of different use cases such as smart greenhouse monitoring, pest
    control, and irrigation/soil management can be considered [1], [3]. These use
    cases are mostly computation intensive and delay-sensitive [1], [4], [5]. A large
    volume of connected devices implies a large volume of data that must be processed
    accurately in a timely manner [6]. Such data computation and analysis demands
    a significant amount of processing and storage resources which put a constraint
    on energy-limited IoT devices. Depending on the specific application, the aggregated
    data from monitoring sensors, and captured images/videos from installed cameras
    in the field need to be processed in real-time to turn raw data into usable information.
    Introducing IoT and its applications in modern agriculture provides this industry
    with suitable tools to support farmers for better productivity, quality, and profitability
    [1]. Therefore, the scope of IoT extends beyond just agricultural land, encompassing
    a broader spectrum that includes the supply chain as well [7], [8]. Battery-operated
    IoT devices lack the capability to perform energy-intensive computations independently.
    Additionally, they face challenges related to limited processing power and storage
    capacity [9]. Therefore, MEC is proposed as a promising technology to address
    these limitations by offering additional computation and storage resources for
    IoT systems. This is achieved by providing servers where IoT devices can offload
    their computation tasks [10], [11]. On the other hand, large-scale agricultural
    operations often involve the distribution of IoT devices across expansive areas.
    In such scenarios, challenges may emerge concerning communication, particularly
    with issues related to the limited reachability between IoT devices and MEC infrastructure.
    To address these challenges, a proposed solution involves the integration of a
    network comprising unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) to enhance the capabilities
    of MEC [12], [13]. This approach aims to mitigate communication limitations stemming
    from the constrained transmission power of IoT devices and simultaneously improve
    network coverage. Due to the easy-to-deploy, cost-effective, and strong capabilities
    of the UAVs, UAV-aided MEC has attracted much attention and is widely utilized
    in smart agriculture to provide a high-quality line-of-sight (LoS) link to IoT
    devices [1], [3], [5], [14], [15], [16], [17]. The versatility and mobility exhibited
    by UAVs in response to changing weather conditions, alongside their straightforward
    deployment and economically viable maintenance costs, collectively establish UAVs
    as a proficient solution for supplying IoT devices with the necessary resources.
    Nevertheless, the UAVs themselves are quite often battery-powered which means
    their available energy is limited [6]. 1) Age of Information Besides energy, the
    freshness of information is another important aspect that needs to be considered
    in environmental monitoring and smart agriculture applications in which rapid
    protective and/or recovery actions are needed. Being more specific, within the
    realm of environmental monitoring applications and precision farming [18] in a
    UAV-aided MEC network, the IoT devices are strategically dispersed throughout
    specified regions to seamlessly gather real-time environmental data. Then the
    collected and pre-processed data by the UAVs finds its transmission route toward
    a localized MEC server; where a comprehensive analysis is conducted to facilitate
    the extraction of pertinent insights. These insights, in turn, play a pivotal
    role in fostering prompt agricultural decision-making and actions. The objectives
    can be the refinement of operations, the performance optimization, or the reduction
    of expenditure [1], [14], [19]. This expansion of smart agriculture’s scope ensures
    a secure and sustainable food supply chain, underpinned by contextual and situational
    awareness derived from real-time event processing [20]. Accordingly, such applications
    are characterized by their intensive computational demands and time-sensitive
    nature [1], [3], [5], [14], [18]. Concisely, the freshness of information becomes
    a critical factor that demands careful consideration. Packet delay and inter-delivery
    times, as two exemplary metrics that are commonly used to quantify the performance
    of real-time applications, are not adequate to represent the freshness of information
    received at the destination. Recently, age of information (AoI) has been proposed
    as a novel criterion to quantitatively evaluate the freshness of information [6],
    [17], [21]. For a flow of data packets, and with emphasis on the freshness of
    data at the destination, AoI is defined as the time elapsed from receiving the
    most recent packet belonging to that data-packet flow [22], [23]. 2) Network Function
    Virtualization (NFV) From the above discussion, in the context of UAV-enabled
    smart agriculture paradigm – which constitutes the focal point of this paper –
    UAVs are confronted with a substantial amount of data necessitating prompt processing.
    This scenario embodies a dynamic computational framework wherein a bunch of processing
    functions demands seamless implementation across both the UAVs and the local server
    [20], [24], [25]. NFV is a key technology for implementing and managing computing
    machines in a reliable, efficient, and robust manner [26]. The NFV virtualizes
    the network functions (NFs) and abstracts them from the physical hardware, which
    enables rapid service function chaining (SFC) and service provisioning in UAV-aided
    MEC applications [27]. Considering the data-intensive and computation-based application
    of smart agriculture, multiple computing functions in the form of virtual network
    functions (VNF) should be deployed sequentially and orderly to provide the processed
    data for the final decision-making at the local MEC-server. Utilizing NFV significantly
    enhances the agility in deploying and managing network components and improves
    the robustness and scalability of networks [27], [28]. Therefore, a critical challenge
    to address is the optimal and efficient placement of Virtual Network Functions
    (VNFs) and determining how to route information packets among VNF components over
    the available NFV infrastructure, i.e., UAVs and the MEC server. The decision
    to distribute and allocate VNFs between both UAVs and the server, rather than
    solely on one of them, aligns with the primary goal of the proposed scheme—to
    minimize the Age of Information (AoI) while maintaining energy efficiency. Network
    traffic and the workload on both UAVs and MEC servers fluctuate over time, while
    changing channel conditions between the parties necessitate adjustments in the
    required communication resources for packet forwarding. Furthermore, certain processing
    functions, such as compression, may alter the packet size, so the trade-off of
    performing these functions locally and sending the smaller packets with spending
    fewer communication resources versus doing the entire processing locally becomes
    pivotal. Consequently, the placement must dynamically adjust to new conditions
    to ensure the minimization of AoI and energy efficiency [28]. In light of this,
    a general condition has been considered where the VNFO can, depending on network
    conditions (processing node resources, service type, and channel conditions),
    decide on the optimal placement to minimize AoI and energy consumption. The work
    presented in [24] is a use-case of the practical implementation of smart agriculture
    in real-world contexts; where, the authors leverage a confluence of cloud computing,
    edge computing, and NFV technology to conceive a comprehensive framework tailored
    to the essential demands of soilless precision farming practiced within a fully-recirculating
    greenhouse [24]. 3) Federated Reinforcement Learning (FRL) The VNF placement and
    scheduling in our network settings can be expressed as integer programming with
    some constraints that reflect the service requirements and the network infrastructure’s
    restrictions. Nevertheless, this problem is NP-complete and there is no standard
    solver that can solve such problems in polynomial time [29], especially for large-scale
    networks where the required computation to find the optimal solution increases
    exponentially. Recently, machine learning algorithms and artificial intelligent
    (AI) based solutions appear as a viable way to solve such complex problems in
    polynomial time [17], [29], [30]. Since its inception in 2017 [31], Federated
    Learning (FL) has reshaped many emerging intelligent IoT systems toward advanced
    FL architecture. The distributed nature of FL, where some agents cooperatively
    train a global ML model without directly sharing the local data, makes FL an attractive
    alternative to traditional centralized ML schemes. To be more specific, FL by
    pushing intelligent ML functions to the network edge enhances the privacy and
    scalability of IoT applications and networks [30]. In this paper, our focus is
    on use cases in smart agriculture that require live streaming and analysis, such
    as surveillance and environmental monitoring. Specifically, we address the flexible
    dynamic orchestration of NFV-enabled SFCs within the context of delay-sensitive
    services. The approach involves distributing VNFs across processing nodes, utilizing
    UAVs and local MEC server in a UAV-aided MEC network. The objective is to perform
    SFC while ensuring the freshness of information by jointly minimizing AoI and
    total energy consumption throughout the network. Condensing the system model and
    the definition of the problem, we present the following key insights: In the realm
    of smart agriculture applications, real-time information is collected by IoT devices
    on a smart farm and transmitted through hovering UAVs to the local server. VNFs
    must be executed sequentially on the raw packets, as they represent split functionalities
    of a single processing job. Meanwhile, certain VNFs, such as compression, may
    potentially alter packet sizes. Various service types are assumed, each with its
    specific VNF chain. The challenge involves determining the optimal placement and
    scheduling of VNF chains on processing nodes (UAVs and the local server), accounting
    for processing time, transmission delay, and power consumption (both transmit
    and processing power) in a distributed manner. We will demonstrate analytically
    that the problem: Exhibits circular symmetry, wherein the optimal policies of
    the agents (UAVs) are identical. The local observations of the agents serve as
    sufficient statistics for determining the optimal policy, We will show how these
    two features will simplify the problem significantly. Subsequently, we present
    a novel solution for solving the modeled problem. The main contributions of our
    paper are summarized as follows: To the best of our knowledge this is the first
    time that the problem of dynamic orchestration of NFV-enabled SFCs in a multi-hop
    UAV-aided MEC network for smart agriculture is considered, while the problem is
    formulated as a joint AoI and Energy minimization. We formulate this joint optimization
    problem as a decentralized partially observable MDP (DEC-POMDP), where the parties
    are not aware of the true state and just make decisions based on their local observations.
    We adopted the structural feature of the problem and have analytically shown that
    under the satisfaction of certain symmetry conditions, the local observation of
    the parties (agents) would be a sufficient statistic for determining the optimal
    solution. As the formulated problem is NP-complete, we proposed a novel FL-based
    algorithm called Asynchronous FL Deep Q-Network (AFDQN) in which a set of distributed
    parties learn in parallel and aggregate their own experience through a coordinator.
    A Multi-hop network is considered, where the UAVs can offload their computing
    tasks to the other UAVs as well as the local MEC server. The rest of the paper
    is organized as follows: In Section II some state-of-the-art studies will be reviewed.
    Section III describes the system model and the main components of the system in
    detail. Section IV presents the problem definition and formulation. In Section
    V, the problem is expressed as a DEC-POMDP, and some analytical results are given
    that support our proposed FL-based solution presented in Section VI. The complexity
    analysis of the proposed algorithm is presented in Section VII. The effectiveness
    and performance of the proposed scheme is demonstrated in Section VIII. Finally,
    Section IX concludes the paper. SECTION II. Related Works In this section, we
    review some state-of-the-art studies on AoI and energy-aware UAV-aided MEC for
    smart agriculture. The prospects of using UAVs for smart agriculture are immense.
    Moreover, UAVs are easy to deploy and cost-effective which motivates their use
    in smart agriculture [1], [6], [32]. For a comprehensive survey on IoT-based smart
    agriculture and the emerging technologies mentioned in the previous section refer
    to [1]. In [13], Mozaffari et al. have considered the reliable design of IoT’s
    uplink communication in a scenario in which multiple UAVs are deployed to collect
    data from ground IoT devices. In particular, a framework for jointly optimizing
    the trajectory of the UAVs, IoT-to-UAV association, and IoT’s uplink power is
    proposed with the aim of minimizing the total energy consumption and mobility
    of the UAVs. However, in the formulated problem, the delay of the forwarded data
    across the UAV network is not considered. Nguyen et al. [5] have considered this
    issue as the problem of processing deadline-critical tasks which are fed to a
    network of hovering UAVs that support the IoT devices deployed in a smart farm.
    It is assumed that the smart farm is equipped with a multi-access MEC infrastructure.
    In such a circumstance, the energy-efficient monitoring problem is modeled as
    a multi-objective maximization problem which aims to maximize the number of tasks
    that are successfully processed before their deadline. Then, a Q-Learning-based
    solution is proposed to solve the problem. The same authors in [5] have extended
    their proposed scheme to a DQN-based solution [33] and to a multi-actor-based
    risk-sensitive RL approach [32]. Although, the goal of the aforementioned studies
    is to minimize the energy consumption in the network, however, the proposed solutions
    are basically centralized and the communication overhead of the centralized approaches
    is itself a source of energy waste. The AoI as a metric for determining the freshness
    of information has been used in some recent works On UAV-aided IoT networks [6],
    [17], [23], [34], [35]. Buyukates and Ulukus [34] examined a status update system
    where update packets require processing to extract embedded useful information.
    The source node sends information to a computation unit (CU) with a master node
    and worker nodes. The master node assigns tasks, aggregates results, and sends
    them back to the source node for updating. The analysis focuses on the age performance
    of various schemes in the presence of stragglers, considering i.i.d. exponential
    transmission delays and i.i.d. shifted exponential computation times. Then, the
    best scheme that minimizes the average age is presented. In [35], the authors
    analyzed the average age of information (AoI) and average peak AoI (PAoI) in a
    multiuser Mobile Edge Computing (MEC) system. The system considers three computing
    schemes: local computing, edge computing, and partial computing (where the computational
    tasks are partially performed at the edge and the remaining is performed by the
    local server). To address the complexity, upper and lower bounds on average AoI
    are provided, enabling an examination of optimal offloading decisions based on
    MEC system parameters. In [6], Han et al. modeled a UAV-aided IoT network using
    a Markov chain. The freshness of data packets is defined using AoI and they analyzed
    the IoT devices as first-come-first-served (FCFS) model and M/M/1 queue. Sun et
    al. [17], employed AoI to propose an AoI-energy-aware data collection scheme for
    IoT networks in which the UAVs are used to collect data. Here, AoI is used to
    quantify the temporal correlation among data packets. Then, an algorithm for determining
    the UAV’s flight speed, hovering locations, and allocated bandwidth to IoT devices
    is proposed that jointly minimizes energy consumption and the weighted sum of
    expected average AoI in the network. In [23], a UAV-aided wireless powered IoT
    scheme is proposed, where a UAV flies from a data center toward IoT sensory nodes
    to transfer energy and collect their information and then it returns back to the
    data center. The goal is to minimize the average AoI of the collected data from
    sensor modes. For such circumstances, an optimization problem is formulated, and
    then a suboptimal method is proposed that first decomposes the problem into two
    subproblems. The solution to the first subproblem is the input for the second
    subproblem. It is worth mentioning that the AoI is basically an end-to-end metric;
    Hence, even though the aforementioned works try to minimize the AoI, for the use
    cases in smart agriculture that the captured data needs some live processing before
    being turned into useful information, these approaches are not effective as they
    just consider the problem of finding the best data flow path. In the context of
    UAV-aided MEC for IoT networks, each service can be represented as a service function
    chain (SFC) consisting of ordered processing functions in the form of VNFs that
    can be geographically placed on to local MEC-server or the UAVs. However, in a
    network with numerous IoT devices and dynamic network load, the placement of VNF
    instances and routing among them in an optimal and efficient manner is a challenging
    problem [27], [28]. In the literature, this problem is referred to as the SFC
    dynamic orchestration problem (SFC-DOP) [27]. In [27], Liu et al. presented a
    DRL-based framework for dynamic SFC orchestration in IoT networks. Huang et al.
    in [36] dealt with the problem of scalability and flexibility of static orchestration
    of NFV-enabled SFCs. Then, a FL-based SFC orchestration is proposed which is scalable
    and benefits from low communication cost. Table 1 presents an overview of the
    previously mentioned studies, emphasizing the main topics they concentrated on.
    Although, in the literature, the UAV-aided MEC architecture is mainly proposed
    as a technique to compensate for the energy and computational limitations of IoT
    networks, however, existing solutions for NFV-enabled SFC require IoT nodes to
    exchange large volumes of local data with a centralized server or among the distributed
    agents. Considering the energy limitation of IoT devices and battery-powered UAVs,
    this significantly causes waste of the network energy. In this paper, we deal
    with this inconsistency and propose a novel FL-based solution for the dynamic
    orchestration of SFCs in a multi-hop and UAV-aided MEC network. To the best of
    our knowledge, this is the first time that the problem of dynamic orchestration
    of NFV-enabled SFCs in a multi-hop UAV-aided MEC network is considered. What makes
    our approach unique is the adoption of the inherent structural aspects of the
    problem, typical in most scenarios, to introduce a decentralized solution that
    is analytically demonstrated to be valid. The proposed method is asynchronous
    FL-based, enabling distributed parties to independently learn locally and subsequently
    contribute to the training of the global model asynchronously [38], [39]. In other
    words, the parties are allowed to directly share gradients with the coordinator
    (here, the MEC server) after every local update and asynchronous of the other
    parties. This further enhances the training speed and efficiency of our proposed
    approach [39]. The coordinator in turn can perform the aggregation and update
    the global model whenever an update from one of the distributed parties is received.
    This approach improves the whole system’s scalability and alleviates the straggler
    impact, i.e., users who may have slower performance [38]. TABLE 1 Summary of Related

    We consider a real-time IoT network for smart agriculture applications, where,
    the IoT network provides real-time monitoring and visibility to network operators
    by video/image streaming. For such circumstances, several use cases from remote
    monitoring to security can be considered. As it is depicted in Fig. 1, a set N
    of N IoT devices collect real-time information from a smart farm and send the
    packets to a local server. A UAV-aided MEC architecture is considered, where packets
    are forwarded through an Aerial Network consisting of U hovering UAVs toward the
    local server. We consider applications in which some processing functions, from
    primary processes (e.g., compression) to advanced ones (e.g., object recognition)
    must be sequentially performed on the raw packets. Each IoT device is associated
    with one of the UAVs in its range. U denote the set of all U UAVs in the network.
    The local server is indeed a MEC-server1 denoted by M . A set S={ S k } K k=1
    with |S|=K different service types is assumed. Each service type S k itself consists
    of a set F k ={ F k f } F k f=1 including F k different processing functions that
    should be performed on the packets of that service and F denotes a set of all
    processing functions of all services, F= ⋃ k∈S ( F k ) . The input and output
    packet sizes of the function f of service type k are ρ k f and ϱ k f , respectively.
    FIGURE 1. System model. Show All Let s k n ∈{0,1} denote the service type k∈S
    in IoT node n∈N is active, s k n =1 , or not, s k n =0 . In each IoT node one
    of the K different services is running, ∑ k∈S s k n =1,∀n∈N . To perform the processing
    functions, the MEC-server M and each UAV u is able to run F= ∑ k∈S F k different
    VNF types on their physical computing machine.2 The proposed architecture is based
    on ETSI-NFV standard [40] which is a globally accepted architecture for implementing
    the NFV. According to ETSI-NFV, in each physical machine (processing node) p∈U∪M
    (All U UAVs and the local server M), the VNF manager (VNFM) is responsible to
    manage its computing and storage resources among the VNFs it hosts. The total
    available resources at processing node p is indicated by C p , the computing capacity
    in Hz, and B p , the memory capacity in Byte. The VNF orchestrator (VNFO), hosted
    by the local server, places and schedules the chain of VNFs through Aerial Domain
    and Local (MEC) Server. For a summary of the key symbols and variables used in
    the system model and problem formulation, refer to Table 2. TABLE 2 Key Symbols
    and Variables B. VNF Placement and Scheduling We consider a discrete-time system
    with two hierarchical timing levels. First, the time is divided into equal time
    slots TS with duration T indexed by t=1,2,… . On top of that, we have the VNF-scheduling
    time slots t ~ with duration T ˜ that is multiples of T , and it is a single round
    of VNF placement and scheduling update. At the beginning of each time slot t ~
    , the VNFO updates the VNF placements. Each UAV u segregates data packets from
    IoT nodes sharing the same service type, say k , into a packet-flow Υ k u (t)
    , which it then transmits across the aerial network to the local server. The set
    F k ={ V fk } F k f=1 of F k different VNFs (processing functions) must be performed
    on data packets of the IoT nodes with service type k . At the beginning of each
    VNFO-level time slot t ~ , the VNFO determines the set of processing nodes Δ k
    u ( t ~ ) that participate in serving the k th service packet-flow Υ k u (t) of
    UAV u at t th TS. Each selected processing node p∈U∪M that belongs to Δ k u (
    t ~ ) performs a subset B k up ( t ~ ) of all functions F k that is supposed to
    be performed on the packet flow of service type k belongs to UAV u : B k up (
    t ~ )={ F k f  :  f ˙ k up ≤f≤ f ¨ k up }, B k up ( t ~ )⊆ F k , (1) View Source
    where f ˙ k up (S) and f ¨ k up (E) are the first and the last function (VNF)
    that p performs on the packet flow of service type k of UAV u . In summary, for
    each packet-flow Υ k u (t) , the VNFO selects and schedules the processing nodes
    that handle F k . These nodes can be each one of any other UAVs (intra-domain
    offloading) or local server (inter-domain offloading). Remark 1:Let P to−do p
    ( t ~ )={(u,k,f) : f∈ F k u is running on p} indicate a set of all assigned VNFs
    to the processing node p∈U∪M . We assume all assigned VNFs P to−do p ( t ~ ) to
    processing node p should be finished in a single round of VNF scheduling t ~ .
    Fig. 2 provides a comprehensive representation of crucial elements related to
    the proposed orchestration solution and the communication dynamics within the
    network. Operating at two distinct timing levels, the figure elucidates: 1) The
    VNFO timing (Tier 1), emphasizing interactions pivotal for establishing the proposed
    orchestration solution, and 2) the network-wide communication (Tier 2), encompassing
    all entities within the network. FIGURE 2. Network-wide timing model. Show All
    The upper segment of the figure illustrates how UAV 1 manages received packet
    flows from IoT nodes, accommodating two distinct service types. Following the
    assumed VNFO policy in a single round of VNF placement and scheduling, it is evident
    that for packets of service type 1, UAV1 processes them and subsequently forwards
    them to UAV3. UAV3, after performing the assigned VNFs, then forwards the packets
    to the local server, i.e., the final destination. Conversely, for packets of service
    type 2, UAV1 initiates some initial processing and then directly forwards them
    to the local server, where all remaining VNFs are executed. The lower section
    of the figure is dedicated to illustrating VNFO level operation, depicting control
    packets exchanged between the local server and agents for the training of the
    VNFO model. Further clarification on this VNFO communication is postponed to subsequent
    sections within the article. C. Communication (Access) Network There are three
    communication links among the network nodes: the wireless links between IoT nodes
    and an aerial network consisting of UAVs, the UAV-to-UAV wireless links, and the
    wireless link between the UAVs and the local terrestrial server. Let random process
    g nu (t)∈C denote the channel loss between IoT node n∈N and UAV u∈U , then the
    achievable bit rate of node n in up-link direction at time instant t will be R
    nu (t)= w n log 2 (1+ p nu | g nu (t)| σ 2 ),∀n∈N,u∈U , where w n and σ 2 denote
    the channel bandwidth of IoT device n and the noise variance, respectively, and
    p nu is the transmission power level. The channel between IoT nodes and UAVs and
    between UAVs and the local server can be modeled as an air-to-ground channel model
    [41]. According to this model, the path loss, g nu can be calculated as [37],
    g nu (t)= ( 4πf c ) 2 d 2 (t) η e , (2) View Source where f , c , and d are frequency
    of operation, speed of light, and distance between the transmitter and receiver,
    respectively; and η e is the average of excessive path loss in two cases of existing
    a LoS path, η LoS e , and non-LoS case, η nLoS e , η e = p LoS × η LoS e +(1−
    p LoS )× η nLoS e , (3) View Source where p LoS is the probability that a LoS
    path exists and can be closely approximated as [37], p LoS = 1 1+aexp−b(ψ−a) ,
    (4) View Source where, a and b are environment-related parameters. Similarly,
    in the downlink direction, the achievable bit rate of the link between UAV u∈U
    and MEC server M at time instant t will be R uM (t)= w uM log 2 (1+ p uM | g uM
    (t)| σ 2 ),∀u∈U , where w uM denotes the channel bandwidth, σ 2 is the noise variance,
    p uM is the transmission power level, and random process g uM (t)∈C denotes the
    channel Loss at time t . Finally, the UAV-to-UAV wireless channel also follows
    the same mathematical model, however, the only difference is that the probability
    of existing LoS is equal to 1, p LoS =1 . For each UAV u and service type k ,
    τ k u (t) is defined as the expectation value of IoT access network delay with
    respect to transmission rate R nu (t) , τ k u (t)= E R nu [ τ k nu (t)], τ k nu
    (t)= D nu /C+ Λ k nu / R nu (t), (5) View Source where, E R nu denotes the expectation
    with respect to R nu , D nu is distance between IoT node n∈N and UAV u∈U and Λ
    k nu is the packet length of service type S k ∈S . For the aerial radio links,
    Let random process g u u ´ (t)∈C denote the channel power gain between UAV u∈U
    and UAV (or local server M) u ´ ∈U∪M , then the achievable bit rate of the link
    at time instant t will be R u u ´ = w u u ´ log 2 (1+ p u u ´ | g u u ´ (t)| σ
    2 ),∀n∈N,u∈U∪M , where w u u ´ denote the channel bandwidth between UAV u , and
    UAV (or local server) u ´ , σ 2 is the noise variance, and p u u ´ is the transmission
    power level. In the following sections, we will focus on the VNFO’s functionality,
    and resource allocation of the radio access part is beyond the scope of this paper;
    hence, without loss of generality, we assume a fixed power and bandwidth allocated
    to all the participating nodes. SECTION IV. Problem Formulation Let χ fk pu (
    t ~ )∈{0,1} denote whether the processing node p at time slot t is selected to
    run VNF function f on the packet of the k th service type of UAV u : χ fk pu (
    t ~ )= { 1, 0, if p∈ Δ k u ( t ~ )andf∈ B k pu ( t ~ ) otherwise ∀k∈S,u∈U. (6)
    View Source For each service type k∈S of UAV u , only one of the processing nodes
    (UAVs or MEC-server) must be selected for serving each function f∈ F k : ∑ p∈U∪M
    χ fk pu ( t ~ )=1,∀f∈ F k , ∑ p∈U∪M χ fk pu ( t ~ )=0,∀f∄ F k . (7) View Source
    The relation (7), both left and right expressions together, implies that the packets
    belonging to the service packet-flows travel a loop-free route. Each packet belongs
    to packet-flow Υ k u (t) needs a specific computational capacity c fk in CPU cycle.
    Assuming that all the processing capacity of processing node p in a single time
    slot with duration T ˜ is C p T ˜ , to be assured that the computing capacity
    of the selected processing node is enough to serve the assigned VNFs and the scheduler
    does not exceed the processing node’s budget, the following condition at each
    VNF-scheduling time slot t ~ should be satisfied: ∑ u∈U ∑ k∈S ∑ f∈ F k 1 P to−do
    p ( t ~ ) (u,k,f) c fk ≤ C p T ˜ ,∀p∈U∪M. (8) View Source The same condition also
    needs to be fulfilled regarding the storage capacity requirement b fk (in Bytes):
    ∑ u∈U ∑ k∈S ∑ f∈ F k 1 P to−do p ( t ~ ) (u,k,f) b fk ≤ B p ,∀p∈U∪M (9) View Source
    where B p is the total amount of available storage capacity of the processing
    node p . A. Age of Information In order to quantify the freshness of the received
    packet at the destination, the AoI metric is adopted. As soon as an IoT node has
    a packet to send, it connects to its serving UAV and sends packets.3 For each
    packet flow of service type k that UAV u∈U receives directly from the IoT nodes
    that are connected to it and running this service type, the arrival time t k u
    is defined as the time elapsed from the beginning of the time slot t in which
    any packet has arrived in. Let Θ k u (t) denote the AoI of the packet-flow of
    service type k in UAV u , it can be calculated as, Θ k u (t)={ τ k u +T− t k u
    , Θ k u (t−1)+T, if  α k u (t)=1 if  α k u (t)=0 ∀k∈S,u∈U (10) View Source where
    binary variable α k u (t)∈{0,1} indicates whether any new packet of service flow
    k at TS t is received, α k u (t)=1 , or not, α k u (t)=0 . By definition, for
    every time slot t in which the UAV does not receive a new packet from a service
    packet flow, the AoI of that service packet flow increases by T . On each received
    packet from IoT node n with service type k , the set F n k of VNFs (processing
    functions) should be performed. As stated above, the VNFO determines the set of
    processing nodes p∈ Δ k u ( t ~ ) that participate in performing the VNFs on packet-flow
    Υ k u (t) by performing the set B k up ( t ~ ) of VNFs. B k up ( t ~ )=∅ means
    p hosts none of the required VNFs of Υ k u (t) . Let Δ k u ( t ~ )={ p 1 , p 2
    ,…, p L } denote the sequence of all UAVs that are already selected to sequentially
    do the chain of VNFs on the received packets of service type k . The processing
    time of every packet of this flow will be, Φ k u (t)= ∑ p v ∈ Δ k u ( t ~ ) ⎛
    ⎝ ⎜ ⌈ τ fk p v−i p v (t) T ⌉T+ ∑ ϑ∈ B k u p v ( t ~ ) (⌈ θ k ϑ T ⌉T ⎞ ⎠ ⎟ ), ∀k∈S,u∈U
    τ fk p v−i p v (t)= D p v−i p v /C+ Λ p v−i p v ( F k f )/ R p v−i p v (t) F k
    f = f ¨ k u p v−i , (11) View Source where θ k ϑ is the run time of ϑ th VNF for
    service type k , Λ p v−i p v ( F k f ) is the packet length of service type S
    k ∈S after doing the last VNF f ¨ k u p v−1 of the chain in p v−1 , and, Assuming
    that the queueing delay is negligible, τ fk p v−1 p v is total transmission delay
    between p v−1 and p v consists of propagation delay and transmission delay. If
    the binary variable β k u ( t ~ )∈{0,1} indicates whether the VNF scheduling (at
    VNF-scheduling time slots t ~ ) for the flow of packets belong to service type
    k of UAV u was successful, then, the AoI at the Local server will be, Π k u (t)={
    Θ k u (t)+ Φ k u (t), Π k u (t−1)+ T ˜ , if  β k u ( t ~ )=1 if β k u ( t ~ )=0
    ∀k∈S,u∈U. (12) View Source Note that T ˜ is the duration of a single round of
    VNF placement and scheduling. B. Energy Consumption The energy consumption of
    the network in the uplink direction can be calculated as, P UL (t)= ∑ n∈N ∑ k∈S
    ∑ u∈U s k n p nu Λ k nu / R nu (t), (13) View Source where Λ k nu / R nu (t) is
    the transmission time between IoT node n , with service type k , and UAV u at
    TS t . The other energy-consuming part of the access network is transmission among
    the processing nodes. If we represent the energy consumption in the aerial domain
    (including UAV-to-UAV and UAV-to-MEC links) at TS t with P Aerial (t) , then it
    will be as, P Aerial (t)= τ fk p v−i p v (t)= F k f = ∑ u∈U ∑ k∈S ∑ p v ∈ Δ k
    u p p v−i p v τ fk p v−i p v (t), D p v−i p v /C+ Λ p v−i p v ( F k f )/ R p v−i
    p v (t), f ¨ k u p v−i , (14) View Source where Λ p v−i p v ( F k f ) , f ¨ k
    u p v−1 and τ fk p v−1 p v are defined like (11). Finally, if Ψ k ϑ denotes the
    power each machine, that hosts the ϑ th VNF of service type k , consumes to run
    this VNF on each packet of this service type, then, the total network-wide required
    energy for performing the VNFs across a single packet of all service type can
    be calculated as follows: P NFV = ∑ u∈U ∑ k∈S ∑ p v ∈ Δ k u ∑ ϑ∈ B k u p v Ψ k
    ϑ θ k ϑ . (15) View Source In a single term, P NFV represents the energy consumption
    resulting from VNFs processing. Using (13)–(15), the total energy consumption
    of the network to process a single packet across all the service types belonging
    to all UAVs would be, P Total (t)= P UL (t)+ P Aerial (t)+ P NFV . (16) View Source
    The UAVs use a battery, hence their available energy to do the processes and perform
    the required communications is limited. Therefore, we need an energy-efficient
    VNFO solution with minimum communication overhead. A centralized ML method will
    be optimal, but it requires a large communication transaction to share the local
    observation with the central controller. Another drawback of adopting centralized
    architecture is that the centralized coordinator is not scalable and from the
    processing and communication viewpoint is a single point of failure. Therefore,
    in this paper, we deal with proposing a solution for the following problem of
    distributed NFV orchestration through the UAVs as distributed VNFO agents. Problem
    1 (Distributed VNFO for Joint AoI and Energy Minimization):Considering the service
    requirements of IoT nodes, UAVs/MEC-server available resources, and the condition
    of access networks, what is the optimal strategy of VNF placement and scheduling
    in each UAV to jointly minimize the average AoI and total energy consumption at
    the Local Server: Minimize χ fk pu ( t ~ ) s.t. γ AoI [ 1 UK ∑ u∈U ∑ k∈S Π k u
    (t)]+ γ E P total (t), ∑ p∈U∪M χ fk pu ( t ~ )=1,∀f∈ F k , ∑ p∈U∪M χ fk pu ( t
    ~ )=0,∀f∄ F k , ∑ u∈U ∑ k∈S ∑ f∈ F k 1 P to−do p ( t ~ ) (u,k,f) c fk ≤ C p T,
    ∀p∈U∪M, ∑ u∈U ∑ k∈S ∑ f∈ F k 1 P to−do p ( t ~ ) (u,k,f) b fk ≤ B p , ∀p∈U∪M.
    (17) View Source In each VNFO-level time slot T ˜ the orchestrator sequentially
    decides on the chain of VNFs of the service flows belonging to UAVs. For a class
    of stochastic sequential decision-making problems, the Markov Decision Process
    (MDP) has been a powerful framework for the mathematical formulation and study
    of this type of problems. Another point that is worth mentioning is that our proposed
    method in Section VI is FL-based where the UAVs follow the same model trained
    cooperatively. Therefore, minimizing the average AoI over UAVs or minimizing the
    maximum value of AoI over UAVs are basically the same. Depending on the environment
    state, the MDP output will be the best action (or at least the best upon the history
    of the observations and actions) which maximizes a specific utility function [42].
    For the case that the state is not fully observable to the deciding agent or the
    agent’s observations are exposed to noise or some source (sort) of uncertainties,
    another extended class of decision-making processes called Partially Observable
    MDP (POMDP) is adopted [43]. Both MDP and POMDP in their original scope are defined
    centralized [42], [43]. Partially Observable Stochastic Game (POSG) is the extended
    version of POMDP in which a set of distributed agents are involved in the decision-making
    process [44], [45]. By definition, if every agent has the same individual reward
    function, the POSG model becomes the Decentralized POMDP (DEC-POMDP) [45]. In
    the following two sections, first, we show how the problem can be modeled as a
    DEC-POMDP and then we will present our proposed method to solve the developed
    DEC-POMDP. SECTION V. DEC-POMDP Formulation In a multi-agent MDP with state uncertainty,
    a DEC-POMDP is formally defined as a tuple with the following definition. Definition
    1 (DEC-POMDP Model):DEC-POMDP G with a set U of U agents is defined as a tuple
    G=⟨U,S, b 0 ,A,O,T,O,R⟩ , where S is the finite set of global environment states,
    b 0 is the probability of the environment initially being in state s∈S , A= ∏
    u∈U A u is the joint action of all agents, where A u is the set of actions available
    to agent u , O= ∏ u∈U O u is joint observation, where O u is the observations
    available to agent u , T is the transition function T :  ⋃ s∈S (s×A(s))×S→[0,1]
    , where T( s ´ |s,A(s)) is defined as the transition probability from state s
    to s ´ by doing joint action A(s) , O is the observation function O :  ⋃ s∈S (s×A(s))×O→[0,1]
    , where O(O|s,A(s)) is defined as the joint observation at state s by doing joint
    action A(s) , R={ r u } U−1 u=0 is a set of reward functions r u  :  ⋃ s∈S (s×A(s))→R
    , where r u (s,A(s)) is defined as the reward received by u when A(s) is executed
    at the global state s . In a DEC-POMDP, each agent u∈U based on its local observation
    o u ∈ O u and a local policy π u performs an independent action a u ∈ A u . In
    each partially observable state s , the joint action A(s)= ∏ u∈U a u (s) from
    the joint policy P= ∏ u∈U π u determines the next global state s ´ and joint observations
    O according to transition and observation probability of T( s ´ |s,A(s)) and O(O|s,A(s))
    , respectively. According to Problem 1, our purpose is to find the best choice
    for the sets Δ k u (t) of processing nodes p and B k up (t) of the VNF chains
    for serving packet-flow Υ k u (t) of any service type k∈S of UAVs u∈U in a distributed
    manner. Remark 2 (Source of Uncertainties):We have considered a multi-hop network
    architecture, as depicted in Fig. 3, in which, 1) each agent u is not aware of
    the other agents’ observation o −u  (−u refers to all the agents except u , o
    −u = ∏ u ´ ≠u o u ´ ) , nor the action a −u ,4 2) each agent observes the result
    of doing its own action and the actions of the other agents, while it is not aware
    of the global state nor the action of the other agents. Therefore, according to
    Definition 1, it can be inferred that Problem 1 in its decentralized form is a
    DEC-POMDP. FIGURE 3. System model as a DEC-POMDP. Show All In DEC-POMDP, each
    agent based on its actions and observations creates a local database that in time
    t can be represented as h u ( t ~ )={ a u ( t ~ −1), o u ( t ~ ) } t ~ t ~ =1
    ,∀u∈U , where a u ( t ~ −1) and o u ( t ~ ) are the action of u at time slot t
    ~ −1 and its corresponding observation at t ~ . All the information is available
    to all the U agents at time t ~ defines as the joint history H( t ~ )= ∏ u∈U h
    u ( t ~ )={A( t ~ −1),O( t ~ ) } t ~ t ~ =1 . The POMDP state is hidden from the
    agents. Hence, the agents would not be able to choose their actions based on knowing
    the true state. The standard approach for dealing with POMDPs is to find a solution
    to the fully observable equivalent belief-MDP [43]. Where, belief B(s, t ~ )=P(s(
    t ~ )=s|H( t ~ ),B(0)),∀s∈S defines as a probability distribution over the state
    space of the original POMDP knowing the joint history H( t ~ ) , i.e., all the
    available information from the sequence of interactions that the agents have had
    until now,where B(0) is the initial value the belief state function. Belief state
    function B(s, t ~ ) is known as sufficient statistic for the history H( t ~ )
    [45]. Upon performing a new interaction at t ~ +1 , the belief value is updated
    from the belief point at time t considering the new interaction {A( t ~ −1),O(
    t ~ )} . Despite the current hidden state, in DEC-POMDP the agents need to infer
    the action (the policy) of the other agents. This leads to the definition of multi-agent
    belief function [46] with the following definition, b u  :  ⋃ s∈S (s× π −u (s))→[0,1],∀u∈U
    b u, t ~ (s, π −u )=P(s( t ~ )=s, π −u | h u ( t ~ ), b u (0)), π −u = ∏ u ´ ∈U,
    u ´ ≠u π u ´ . (18) View Source As it is evident, the multi-agent belief function
    is defined in a space that is a combination of the hidden global state s and joint
    policy π −u of the other agents. From Bellman expectation equation [47], the action-value
    function Q π u, t ~ [(s, π −u ), a π u ] is the expected return starting from
    state hidden state s , taking action a π u according to policy π u , while the
    other agents follow the joint policy π −u , Q π u, t ~ [(s, π −u ), a π u, t ~
    ]= E{ R u [(s, π −u ), a π u, t ~ ] + γ u Q π u, t ~ +1 [( s ´ , π −u ), a π u,
    t ~ +1 ]}. (19) View Source where the action-value function decomposed into immediate
    reward plus discounted action-value of the successor state, and γ u is the discount
    factor of agent u . With some mathematical manipulation, (19) can be written as,
    Q π u, t ~ [(s, π −u ), a π u, t ~ ]= R u [(s, π −u ), a π u, t ~ ] + γ u ∑ (
    o u , o −u )∈O O[ o u , o −u |s,( a π u , a −π −u )] ∑ s ´ ∈S T[ s ´ |s,( a −π
    −u )] × ∑ ( a π u , a −π −u )∈A π u ( a π u | s ´ ) Q π u,t [( s ´ , π −u ( o
    −u )), a ´ π u, t ~ +1 ( o u )]. (20) View Source Using (18), for a given belief
    state function b u, t ~ (s, π −u ) , the action-value function Q π u, t ~ ( b
    u, t ~ , a π u, t ~ ) will be, Q π u, t ~ ( b u, t ~ , a π u, t ~ )= ∑ s∈S ∑ π
    −u b u, t ~ (s, π −u ) Q π u, t ~ [(s, π −u ), a π u, t ~ ]. (21) View Source
    For an enough large value of t ~  ( t ~ →∞) , the goal is to find the optimal
    policy π ∗ u among available policies π u which leads to the optimal Q-value (action-value)
    function, Q ∗ u, t ~ ( b u, t ~ , a u, t ~ )=arg max π Q π u, t ~ ( b u, t ~ ,
    a π u, t ~ ). (22) View Source There is no straightforward solution for the aforementioned
    DEC-POMDP problem. Among decentralized methods, multi-agent solutions also need
    a large volume of communication overhead between the agents to share their local
    observations to converge. FL does not have the communication overhead of the centralized
    techniques and also does not necessitate the agents to share all of the data and
    local observations to converge. Although this specification is for providing privacy,
    in our problem it provides us with the gain of energy efficiency that arises because
    the agents (UAVs) do not need to share all of their observations. A few efforts,
    [45], [48], [49], have been made in the literature to capture and exploit some
    structural specifications of the understudied system (application) to find or
    at least simplify the problem of finding optimal policy (22). One of these works
    is one presented by Yongacoglu et al. [48], in which the authors have developed
    a class of POSGs that is characterized by symmetry across players in terms of
    cost and state dynamics. In view of this research, within the APPENDIX, we introduce
    a class of Symmetric DEC-POMDP and prove that Problem 1belongs to this class and
    is Circularly Symmetric. This implies that the best agents’ policy, π ∗ are the
    same, { π u } U−1 u=0 = π ∗ . In essence, this necessitates a distributed solution
    to determine the best policy while ensuring uniformity across all agents. Furthermore,
    in accordance with the circular symmetry characteristic of the problem, in Corollary
    22 we prove that local observations serve as sufficient statistics for each agent
    to ascertain the best policy. Corollary 22 guarantees that the local observation
    h u ( t ~ ) serves as a sufficient statistic to determine the optimal policy π
    ∗ for the agents (UAVs). This implies that the information encapsulated in the
    local observations of the individual agents is comprehensive enough to determine
    the optimal policy π ∗ . While this corollary does not suggest a particular method
    for identifying the optimal policy, it is promising and justifies our proposed
    FL-based algorithm in which the agents collaboratively engage in training a globally
    shared model. This approach aligns with the notion that leveraging decentralized
    insights from each agent’s local observations can contribute to the derivation
    of an effective and globally optimal policy because their observations are sufficient
    statistics. Capitalizing on the promising findings in this section, the subsequent
    section introduces our proposed approach to address Problem 1. SECTION VI. Symmetry-aided
    Asynchronous Federated DQN Framework In this section, we introduce our proposed
    Asynchronous Federated Deep Q-Network (AFDQN) algorithm and the components we
    have used in the proposed model as depicted in Fig. 4. In traditional RL, the
    problem is modeled as an MDP consisting of a tuple {s( t ~ ),a( t ~ ),r( t ~ ),s(
    t ~ +1)} . At each decision-making time t ~ , the agent is at state s( t ~ ) and
    takes an action a( t ~ ) based on a policy π that causes a state transition from
    s( t ~ ) to s( t ~ +1) while an immediate reward r( t ~ ) incurred. For our POMDP
    case in which the true state of the network is hidden, the true state s( t ~ )
    is replaced with belief-state b( t ~ ) . Mainly, the RL aims to guide the agent
    to find the best policy π ∗ defined as the best mapping from observation o( t
    ~ ) to action a( t ~ ) that maximizes the expected cumulative discounted future
    rewards R( t ~ )= E π { ∑ ∞ l=t γ (l− t ~ ) r(l)} , where γ∈[0,1] is a discount
    factor indicating how much future rewards is important. For our DEC-POMDP problem,
    this relation maps to (19). FIGURE 4. Block diagram of the proposed Asynchronous
    Federated-DQN (AFDQN). Show All A. Deep Q-Network (DQN) Part To estimate Q-value
    functions (21), deep reinforcement learning (DRL) is deployed, where Q-values
    are predicted using deep neural networks (DNNs) as function approximators. The
    estimated Q -functions are represented by { Q u ( o u ( t ~ ), a u ( t ~ ); θ
    u ( t ~ )) } U−1 u=0 , where the parameter θ u ( t ~ ) represents the weights
    of the agent u ’s neural network (NN). The updated value of θ u ( t ~ ) is used
    to approximate the true values of Q u ( t ~ ) [21], [50]. Let’s define the loss
    function L( θ u ( t ~ )) as the expectation value of the mean squared error of

    and Experience Replay Buffer [52] are deployed, respectively. Utilizing these
    two techniques, the loss function L( θ u ( t ~ )) can be written as L( θ u ( t

    E D is taken over the randomly selected mini-batches of samples from the replay
    buffer D . B. Federated Learning Part As it is illustrated in Fig. 4, we have
    two main entities, the set U={0,1,…,U−1} of UAVs that are our distributed agents
    or in FL terminology, the agents, and the coordinator that in our model is local
    server (MEC-server). FL allows the UAVs (agents) to train a shared global model
    parameterized by θ g that is an exact copy of the agents’ local model { θ u }
    u=U−1 u=0 using their own dataset { D u } u=U−1 u=0 , while the original data
    remains in UAVs. After local training, agents share their local model updates
    with the coordinator. The coordinator then aggregates the received updates to
    build the global model θ g . As a result, relying on the distributed data training
    at the agents, the local server is able to enhance the training performance without
    significant communication overhead as it just needs an update of the local model
    parameters, not the agents’ local data. The federated learning procedure of our
    proposed method includes the following key steps. 1) Distributed Local Training
    Primarily, the local server initializes the global model, θ g,0 , and transmit
    it to the agents. Upon receiving θ g,0 , during VNFO time slots t ~ the agents
    interact with environment and train their local model { θ u ( t ~ ) } u=U−1 u=0
    using their own data set { D u ( t ~ ) } u=U−1 u=0 by minimizing a loss function
    { L u ( θ u ( t ~ )) } u=U−1 u=0 , θ ∗ u =arg min π u L u ( θ u (( t ~ ))),∀u∈U.
    (25) View Source Then, the agents upload their local update on { θ u ( t ~ ) }
    u=U−1 u=0 to the coordinator for aggregation. 2) Model Aggregation After collecting
    the agents’ local model updates, the next step is aggregating them into a new
    version of the global model which is performed by the coordinator by solving the
    following optimization problem. Problem 2 (Model Aggregation):Given the local
    model updates { θ u ( t ~ ) } u=U−1 u=0 of all agents, and knowing the local loss
    functions { L u (⋅) } u=U−1 u=0 , what is the optimal strategy for aggregating
    the local model that minimizes the global loss, θ ∗ g , L ∗ g =arg min L g , θ
    g L g ( ∏ u∈U L u ( θ g (( t ~ )))). (26) View Source According to Problem 2,
    θ ∗ g is the optimal value for θ g with having the local updates in hand; and
    L ∗ g is the best function (the best method) for aggregating the local loss function.
    The loss-aggregation function L ∗ g indicates the relative contribution of each
    agent on the global model, however, there is not a fixed method for determining
    this function and it depends mostly on the structure and specific features of
    the problem. Corollary 1:According to Lemma 2, The best setting for loss functions
    is (24) and { L u (⋅) } u=U−1 u=0 =L(⋅) , The optimal way for aggregating the
    local updates is averaging among the agent’s contributions, thus (25) can be rewritten
    as, θ ∗ g = ∑ u∈U ω u θ u , where ω u represents the relative contribution of
    each agent on the global model. After the derivation of a new update of θ g the
    coordinator broadcasts it to all agents. Upon receiving the update from the coordinator,
    the agents upgrade their local model accordingly. Until achieving a predefined
    level of accuracy or convergence of the global loss function, this process is
    continued. C. Asynchronous Networking The communication among the network entities
    follows the time slots t , but slot scheduling in which the agents share their
    own local model with the coordinator is distributed and asynchronous. Upon receiving
    an update, the coordinator aggregates it with the global model and updates the
    agents with the newly updated global model. In this way, we do not impose a strict
    constraint on synchronous communication with the local server (the coordinator).
    This significantly decreases the networking overhead in comparison with synchronous
    federation among distributed agents. During the training phase, we consider episodes
    in which the agent presets to a random initialization setting and starts interaction
    with the environment, and learns from its experience. Each episode contains T
    ˆ VNF scheduling round t ~ . In the deployment phase, the stream of packets that
    belong to different services is assigned based on an optimally determined VNF
    placement/scheduling policy. To avoid service interruption any fine-tuning and
    policy adaption to environmental changes, including the time the algorithm spends
    on fine-tuning and finding the optimal solution by coordinating multiple agents
    to train the global model, can be done in parallel. Definition 2 (Global Update
    Period):global update period 1≤η≤ T ˆ is defined as the period of updating the
    coordinator by the agents. We have two special settings, AFDQN-SGD ( η=1 ): In
    this case, every VNF scheduling slot t ~ , the agent sends the locally calculated
    SGD, ∇ θ L u ( θ u ( t ~ )) to the coordinator. Then, the coordinator uses the
    received local data to perform one step of gradient descent: θ g ( t ~ +1)= θ
    g ( t ~ )− γ ˙ ∇ θ L u ( θ u ( t ~ )). (27) View Source AFDQN-Avg ( η= T ˆ ):
    In this case, only one time during each episode, the agent sends the whole parameter
    θ u ( t ~ ) to the coordinator. Then, the coordinator updates θ g ( t ~ ) accordingly,
    θ g ( t ~ +1)=(1− γ ¨ ) θ g ( t ~ )+ γ ¨ θ u ( t ~ ), (28) View Source where,
    γ ˙ and γ ¨ are AFDQN-SGD and AFDQN-Avg forgetting factors, respectively. Introducing
    the forgetting factors γ ˙ and γ ¨ allows for the adjustment of learning rates
    during model updates. Rather than updating the global model instantly upon receiving
    a local update, it is beneficial to employ a weighted average approach, considering
    both the most recent update and the previous value of the Agent’s NN weight θ
    g . This approach, known as Asynchronous Weight Averaging [53] in the literature,
    proves advantageous in alleviating the impact of outdated updates, commonly referred
    to as stale weights, and consequently, it enhances overall stability. The only
    point is that the forgetting factors should be chosen small enough. Another worth
    mentioning point is that the AFDQN-SGD and a centralized approach doing mini-batch
    SGD in the local server are essentially different as the former is asynchronous,
    distributed, and fully based on local data. The details of the proposed AFDQN
    algorithm are described in Algorithm 1. Algorithm 1: AFDQN- η Algorithm Show All
    Considering our optimization problem, for each agent u∈U at VNF scheduling round
    t ~ , we define the observation space O u , the action space A u , and the reward
    function R u as follows: Observation: We define the observation space as a vector
    of: 1) CPU and storage requested by the local service flows { Υ k u (t)|t= t ~
    } k as { c fk (t)|t= t ~ } f,k and { b fk (t)|t= t ~ } f,k , respectively, 2)
    available CPU { C p } p and storage { B p } p of the processing nodes, 3) service
    arrival time { t k u } k , and 4) the transmission rate { R u p ´ } U∖ u ´ ∪M
    of the links between agent u and the other processing nodes. Therefore, the observation
    o u ( t ~ ) can be written as O u ( t ~ )= {{ c fk (t) } f,k ,{ b fk (t) } f,k
    , { C p } p ,{ B p } p ,{ t k u } k ,{ R u p ´ } U∖u⋃M } t= t ~ . (29) View Source
    Action: The action space is defined as all possible placement of the required
    VNFs for service flows { Υ k u (t)|t= t ~ } k as A u ( t ~ )={ χ fk pu ( t ~ )},∀p∈U∪M,k∈S,f∈
    F k . (30) View Source Reward: Our objective is to orchestrate the VNFs in a way
    that jointly minimizes the average AoI and total energy consumption over the network.
    So we define the reward as a linear combination of three terms as follows: R u
    ( t ~ )= ζ ¯ ¯ ¯ u ( t ~ )= Π ¯ ¯ ¯ ¯ ( t ~ )= ζ k u ( t ~ )= δ NFV ζ ¯ ¯ ¯ u
    ( t ~ )+ δ AoI Π ¯ ¯ ¯ ¯ ( t ~ )+ δ E P total ( t ~ ), 1 K ∑ k∈S ζ k u ( t ~ )
    1 UK ∑ u∈U ∑ k∈S Π k u ( t ~ ) { +1, −10, if (7)-(9)are satisfied otherwise. (31)
    View Source where δ NFV , δ AoI and δ E are the normalization factors for NFV
    scheduling result, AoI, and the energy consumption, respectively; ζ k u ( t ~
    ) is defined as the reward assigned to the result of NFV placement for service
    flow Υ k u (t)|t= t ~ . SECTION VII. Complexity Analysis In this section, we determine
    the computational complexity of the proposed Algorithm 1. We analyze the algorithm’s
    complexity through two distinct phases: Model Training and Action Selection, which
    occur during the deployment of the trained model. During each iteration of the
    global update period η , the process involves the training of local models by
    the agents (UAVs) and subsequently, the asynchronous aggregation of these local
    models by the MEC server to form the global model. The complexity of the local
    model training conducted by the agents can be expressed as the sum of two components:
    the complexity of action selection and the complexity of the back-propagation
    algorithm for each sample within the replay buffer. This sum is then further multiplied
    by the mini-batch size and η . It is worth noting that the multiplication by the
    mini-batch size accounts for the fact that, in each training iteration, the local
    agent randomly selects a mini-batch of samples from its own local replay buffer.
    The computational complexity of action selection in a fully connected neural network
    with a fixed number of hidden layers and neurons in each hidden layer is directly
    proportional to the sum of the input size and the output size of the neural network
    being used [54], [55]. The input size of the neural network is equivalent to the
    size of the state space, which from (29) is given by 2KF+2(U+1)+K+(U−1)+1 ; and,
    the output size of the neural network is equal to the size of the action space.
    which from (30) is given by KF(U+1) . It’s worth recalling that F= ∑ k∈S F k represents
    the overall count of distinct VNFs required to be executed across all service
    types. Hence, the computational complexity associated with action selection is
    represented by O(KFU) . Conversely, as indicated in equation [54], [55], for a
    specific sample extracted from the replay buffer, the computational complexity
    of the back-propagation process is directly proportional to the product of the
    neural network’s input and output sizes. Consequently, in our specific scenario,
    derived from the preceding computations, the overall algorithmic complexity for
    each agent can be expressed as O(ηO K 2 F 2 U) , where, O denotes the batch size.
    From Algorithm 1, each agent repeats the whole process of local model training
    η times preceding sharing the results with the local server. The last step is
    the aggregation process. While our algorithm conducts asynchronous aggregation,
    it’s important to note that the processing load escalates proportionally with
    the number of UAVs, U . As a result, the overall computational complexity for
    the training phase across the entire network is given by O(ηO F 2 K 2 U 2 ) .
    Based on the prior discussion, the complexity associated with the action selection
    for all U agents during the deployment phase is denoted as O(KF U 2 ) . SECTION
    VIII. Performance Evaluation In this section, the performance of the proposed
    algorithm is evaluated. The performance results are compared for four different
    methods of AFDQN-SGD, AFDQN-Avg, AFDQN with parameter η≠{1, T ˆ } , and a centralized
    case. In the centralized DQN method, all the observations are forwarded to the
    local server and the local server performs the VNF scheduling. Hence, its performance
    can be considered as an upper bound for the proposed AFDQN method. A. Simulation
    Setup The simulation is implemented by Python using OpenAI gym [56], a widely
    used tool for developing RL algorithms, and conducted in a computer with Intel
    Core i7–10700 CPU 2.90 GHz and 64 GB RAM. Using simulation, the impact of parameter
    η , the number of IoT nodes, and the effect of the received load by the agents
    are evaluated. To this purpose, while T ˆ =60 , five different values for the
    parameter of η consisting of 1 (corresponds to AFDQN-SGD), 10, 20, 30, and 60
    (corresponds to AFDQN-Avg) are considered. The other model parameters and simulation
    settings are summarized in Table 3 and Table 4. The proposed system model entirely
    matches none of the existing related works. However, the simulation parameters
    have been chosen to be in line with the typical values commonly used in similar
    studies within this context [6], [32], [33], [36], [37]. TABLE 3 Model Parameters
    and Simulation Settings Part I TABLE 4 Model Parameters and Simulation Settings
    Part II B. Simulation Results In Fig. 5, the convergence behavior of the AFDQN
    method is compared with the centralized method as a baseline. The two extreme
    cases of AFDQN-SGD and AFDQN-Avg are considered. As is evident from this figure,
    for the AFDQN method we have some variations around the value where it converged.
    The absolute value of these variations in AFDQN-Avg is more than AFDQ-SGD, and
    in AFDQN-SGD’s case, they are around the value achieved by the centralized method.
    Also, the AFDQN-Avg converged to a smaller value for total return, we expect this
    result will also be reflected in the performance of AFDQN-Avg against AFDQN-SGD.
    This will be investigated in the following experiments. In Fig. 6(a) and Fig.
    6(b), the minimum achievable average AoI and total energy consumption are investigated.
    The AoI value is averaged over all the agents and the total energy consumption
    is defined as the total energy consumption for sending a single packet of each
    service flow through the network from IoT nodes toward the local server. As can
    be seen, the maximum energy consumption of the three methods is limited to a maximum
    value corresponding to the maximum value of resources that the processing nodes
    can allocate to the requests. As a result, the negative side effect of the methods’
    drop in performance is mostly reflected in the value of the averaged AoI. For
    the AFDQN-Avg, this point is evidenced in Fig. 6(a), where we can see that at
    several points the values of the averaged AoI are more than 1 second. However,
    this is the worst-case choice for selecting the global update period η . Form
    Fig. 6(a), for the proposed AFDQN, we could achieve an average AoI of less than
    200 msec, which is acceptable for most real-time applications. Therefore, performance
    close to the centralized case can be achieved by the proposed method in a distributed
    manner, relying solely on the local observations of the UAVs and the sharing of
    trained local models, thus eliminating the need for exchanging the local observations,
    which can be time and energy-consuming. FIGURE 5. Episodic reward of agent 1 for
    the proposed method compared with centralized architecture. All agents follow
    the same policy, which is a copy of the cooperatively-trained global model. Show
    All FIGURE 6. (a) Average episodic AoI. (b) Average episodic total energy consumption
    of the proposed method compared with centralized architecture. All agents follow
    the same policy, which is a copy of the cooperatively-trained global model. Show
    All In Fig. 7(a) and Fig. 7(b), the network energy efficiency versus service availability
    is drawn. The network-wide energy efficiency is defined as the total number of
    successfully-supported service flows divided by the total energy consumption throughout
    the network to send a single packet from each one of the services flows. Also,
    service availability is defined as the percentage of the service flows that are
    supported successfully. In Fig. 7(a), the average network energy efficiency and
    the sample values in our simulation, as well as the standard deviation of the
    value, for AFDQN- 20 (η=20) are shown. The averaged network efficiency with increasing
    the value of the service availability increases in a way that for the service
    availability of more than 80 percent, it converges to around 82 percent. This
    convergence for large value of service availability shows that we were eventually
    able to provide energy efficiency as one of our objective functions. In Fig. 7(b),
    where the proposed AFDQN method with different values of η∈{20,30,60} is compared
    with the centralized approach, it can be seen that the energy efficiency of the
    centralized approach degrades as the availability reaches 100%. This behavior
    is because the centralized method has a single NN for all UAVs. For the availability
    values near 100%, the centralized agent is not able to do the job as efficiently
    as the AFDQN method where each agent has its own NN. FIGURE 7. Network-wide energy
    efficiency vs. percentage of service availability. The shaded area represents
    the standard deviation (SD) from the average value: (a) For AFDQN with η=20 .
    Sample values are shown for more illustration. (b) For AFDQN with η=20 , η=30
    , AFDQN-Avg and centralized architecture. Show All As illustrated in Table 3,
    the load of services (in terms of requested CPU and storage resources) is modeled
    as a normalized uniform random variable. The standard deviation (SD) of the values
    for both CPU request values and storage is 1.3 percent. In Fig. 8, the impact
    of increasing this value, up to 6 times the primary value of 1.3, on the network’s
    performance is examined. The network is first trained with the primary input-load
    SD value of 1.3, and then, we incrementally raised the SD of the input load. This
    can be implicitly considered as a test under non-stationary load. It is evident
    that in this situation the AoI will increase, as illustrated in Fig. 8. To be
    more specific, we considered a threshold of one second for the acceptable AoI.
    Hence, we have also drawn a graph of AoI violation (in percentage) in conjunction
    with the bar chart of averaged AoI to better reflect the effect of the load SD.
    The results demonstrate that the AFDQN-Avg method has better performance in this
    situation, which appears to contradict our previous observations where we concluded
    that decreasing the global update period improves the performance. This observation
    can be explained using the non-stationary behavior of the input load. In this
    case, the AFDQN-Avg lets the agents learn the variations and input model better,
    in comparison with AFDQN-10, which was chosen as an example for a case between
    two extreme cases, AFDQN-SGD and AFDQN-Avg. FIGURE 8. Averaged-AoI and AoI-violation
    percentage for AFDQN-10 and AFDQN-Avg versus standard deviation (SD) of the load
    normalized by SD of the load in the training phase. Show All The effect of increasing
    the number of IoT nodes per agent (UAV) on AoI and Energy consumption is investigated
    in Fig. 9. For this experiment, two AFDQN-10 and AFDQN-Avg cases are considered.
    The results show that AFDQN-10 had better performance than AFDQ-Avg. Another important
    point that should be mentioned relates to the behavior of the network for a large
    number of IoT nodes, e.g., 120 or more. As the number of IoT nodes increases,
    the load of the agents increases directly, this means that there are more CPU
    and storage requests. Because the resources in the processing nodes are limited,
    there comes a point where an increase in the number of IoT nodes will lead to
    more request rejection responses. In this situation, the fresh packets will drop,
    and that causes an increase in the AoI value. However, the network energy consumption
    does not change because the volume of the active processes does not change and
    remains equal to the maximum capacity of the processing nodes. FIGURE 9. The effect
    of increasing the number of IoT nodes per agent (UAV) on AoI and energy consumption.
    Show All For further exploration, Fig. 10 and Fig. 11 compare the performance
    of the proposed algorithm against two baseline algorithms: Multi-agent DQN (MDQN)
    [57] and the adapted version of heuristic Minimum-Delay algorithm [58]. In MDQN
    the agents operate independently based on locally trained models without coordination.
    The agents are equipped with an identical neural network featuring the same specifications
    as AFDQN. Conversely, the Minimum Delay algorithm selects actions at each VNF
    scheduling round t ´ to minimize end-to-end delay (not AoI) between IoT nodes
    and the local server. FIGURE 10. Averaged-AoI and AoI-violation percentage for
    AFDQN-avg compared with MDQN and Minimum-Delay versus standard deviation (SD)
    of the load normalized by SD of the load in the training phase. Show All FIGURE
    11. The effect of increasing the number of IoT nodes per agent (UAV) on AoI and
    energy consumption for AFDQN-avg compared with MDQN and Minimum-Delay. Show All
    In Fig. 10, a comparison similar to Fig. 8 assesses the impact of increasing load
    standard deviation (SD) on network performance in terms of AoI and AoI violation.
    Generally, an increase in SD raises the average AoI and AoI violation percentage
    for all methods, as larger SD values force agents to find the best action across
    a larger state space. As it is evident, the proposed AFDQN method exhibits the
    smallest average AoI and AoI violation percentage compared to baseline methods.
    However, the Minimum Delay method performs the worst due to its localized short-term
    target. Finally in Fig. 11, the impact of increasing the number of IoT nodes per
    agent (UAV) on the proposed method’s performance in terms of AoI and energy consumption
    is explored and compared with MDQN and Minimum Delay algorithms. Results demonstrate
    the superior performance of the proposed AFDQN method compared to baselines. Additionally,
    as the number of IoT nodes reaches 120 and beyond, there is an increased demand
    for CPU and storage; limited resources in processing nodes eventually lead to
    increased rejection of requests, causing a rise in AoI. However, network energy
    consumption remains unchanged, as the volume of active processes remains equal
    to the maximum capacity of processing nodes. SECTION IX. Conclusion We considered
    the problem of dynamic orchestration of NFV-enabled SFCs in smart agriculture
    applications to jointly minimize the AoI and energy consumption throughout the
    network. Especially, the problem is formulated as a decentralized POMDP. Then,
    adopting the symmetric structure of the network, we analytically proved that the
    optimal policy among the agents is behaving similarly. Accordingly, a novel federated-based
    DQN method was proposed to solve the problem efficiently. The proposed method
    is distributed and energy efficient, as the local agents just need to share the
    parameters of their locally trained model with each other. Although the primary
    goal of this method is to provide privacy among the agents, in our problem, this
    significantly decreased the communication overhead, and additionally, the total
    energy consumption of the network. In terms of freshness of information, the AoI
    is minimized jointly, and the achieved value for the AoI, while the parameter
    setting is set to be close to real values, is appropriate for most real-time applications.
    Appendix In this section, we aim to simplify the problem of determining the optimal
    policy (22) by utilizing some structural specifications of the developed system
    and problem. Inspiring by the work presented by Yongacoglu et al. [48], we introduce
    a class of Symmetric DEC-POMDP based on the Definition and Lemma presented below.
    Definition 3 (Symmetric DEC-POMDP):A DEC-POMDP is called symmetric if the following
    conditions hold: A u = A u ´ and γ u = γ u ´ , ∀u, u ´ ∈U∀u∈U , ∀a∈A , and an
    arbitrary permutation function σ(.) : r u (s,σ(a))= r σ(u) (s,a) , and T(⋅|s,σ(a))=T(⋅|s,a)
    . Lemma 1:Let G be a symmetric DEC-POMDP, for any u, u ´ ∈U , if π u = π u ´ ,
    then, π u is ϵ -best-response to π −u if and only if π u ´ is ϵ -best-response
    to π − u ´ , where ϵ -best-response (for an arbitrary ϵ≥0) defines as a policy
    that achieves (reach) a reward (cost) within ϵ of the maximum (minimum) value.
    In our VNF scheduling problem, as it is depicted in Fig. 3, at each VNF scheduling
    round t ~ , each distributed agent u∈U , has K packet-flow { Υ k u (t)|t= t ~
    } K k=1 belong to different services each of which requires running F k different
    VNFs on their packets. The agents decide on how to place these VNFs into available
    processing nodes, i.e., other U−1 UAVs, the local server, or itself, in a way
    that jointly minimizes the average AoI and energy consumption according to (17).
    All the agents follow the same goal and the priorities among the agents are the
    same. Without loss of generality, we assume that the agents have chosen the same
    discount factor, { γ u } u∈U =γ . Thus, it can be found that the agents conceptually
    have the same model; an intuitive inference that can be figured out better using
    the following Index Mapping rule. Definition 4 (Index Mapping):For each function
    f∈ F k of packet-flow Υ k u (t)|t= t ~ , by definition we assume that the policy
    π u ( t ~ ) outputs I fk u ∈{0,1,…,U−1,M} is the i th candidate processing node,
    I i , as depicted in Fig. 12. The actual selected processing node among p∈{u∪{
    u ´ } u ´ ≠u ∪M} , will be, p u ( t ~ )={ [(u+i)modU] th UAV, M, if  I i ≠ I M
    if  I i = I M , ∀ I fk u = I i . (32) View Source Then, χ fk pu (|t= t ~ )=1 ,
    and X k u , B k pu will be updated accordingly. FIGURE 12. Index mapping mechanism.
    Show All Now, according to Definition 3and Definition 4, the following lemma can
    be driven. Lemma 2:Problem 1is a symmetric DEC-POMDP. Proof:According to Definition
    4, the agents have the same set of actions { A u } u∈U ={ I i } i∈U∪M , so the
    condition (i) of Definition 3 is met. Let define C ℓ as circular shift operand
    with arbitrary value of ℓ , C ℓ (⋅)=[⋅+ℓ]modU . Considering a circular shift of
    ℓ over joint action A , C ℓ (A) , we will have, a C ℓ (u) = a u , thus from (32),
    for each I fk C ℓ (u) = I fk u = I i the selected processing node p C ℓ (u) (t)
    will be, p C ℓ (u) ( t ~ )={ [( C ℓ (u)+i)modU] th UAV, M, if  I i ≠ I M if  I
    i = I M , ∀ I fk C ℓ (u) = I i . View Source Or, p C ℓ (u) ( t ~ )= C ℓ ( p u
    ( t ~ )). (33) View Source Equation (33) means Problem 1 is circularly symmetric.
    To be more specific, we do not have any special dependency on the identity of
    the agents and the state transitions depend only on the profile of joint actions
    performed by all agents. Accordingly, permuting the agents’ actions does not change
    the conditional transition probabilities, T(⋅|s, C ℓ (A))=T(⋅|s,A) , and this
    permutation will lead to a corresponding permutation of rewards, r C ℓ (u) (s,A)=
    r u (s, C ℓ (A)) . Hence, the second condition of Definition 3 is also satisfied
    and the proof is complete. According to Lemma 2, being circularly symmetric means
    that the best agents’ policy, π ∗ are the same, { π u } U−1 u=0 = π ∗ . For such
    a condition, Lemma 1implies that the problem of finding the best policy can be
    reduced to finding π ∗ u , the best response to ∏ u ´ ≠u π u ´ , while π u ´ =
    π u ,∀ u ´ ≠u . Although this result is promising, from an implementation viewpoint,
    proposing a distributed solution for finding the best policy while requiring the
    same policy for all the agents is challenging. Recalling (18), in addition to
    the current hidden state, in DEC-POMDP the agents need to infer the action (the
    policy) of the other agents. The subsequent Corollary establishes a connection
    between this inference and solely relying on the local observations of the agents,
    thereby rendering it feasible. Corollary 2:With the same initialization of the
    belief function, { b u (0) } U−1 u=0 =b(0) , for a circularly symmetric DEC-POMDP,
    the local observation h u ( t ~ ) is a sufficient statistic for determining the
    optimal policy π ∗ . Proof:Assume that using a mechanism, the agents peruse the
    same policy π u ( t ~ ) , while they are learning the optimal policy π ∗ . Then,
    the multi-agent belief state b u, t ~ (s, π −u ) would be, b u, t ~ (s, π −u )=
    = = b u, t ~ ⎛ ⎝ s, ∏ u ´ ≠u π u ⎞ ⎠ P(s( t ~ )=s| h u ( t ~ ), b u (0), π u )
    b π u u (s, t ~ ).∀u∈U (34) View Source So, for each agent u , the local observation
    h u ( t ~ ) and knowing its local policy π u is enough for determining the belief-state
    b π u u (s, t ~ ) . In a DEC-POMDP, the set { b π u u (s, t ~ ) } U−1 u=0 is sufficient
    statistic for the joint history H , and the proof is complete. Authors Figures

    IEEE Funding Agency: SECTION I. Introduction Agriculture has been identified as
    the backbone of the economy of India, which contributes to almost 18% of the Gross
    Domestic Product (GDP) and 43% of the geographical area [1]. The world population
    and urbanization are on an exponential hike, and the population is expected to
    exceed 9.8 billion by 2050 [2]. Urbanization is another unavoidable change that
    our society is going through. Various innovations and opportunities are brought
    about in modern society as a result of urbanization. This is resulting in the
    relocation of a huge mass of population towards the urban habitations, which in
    turn is causing increased traffic, pollution, industrialization, deforestation,
    increased pollution, soil erosion, etc. All these factors have caused a compromised
    lifestyle in urban habitats and an imbalance in the demand-supply ratio of agricultural
    produce [3]. The combined issue of decreasing cultivatable land and increasing
    demand for medicinal herbs is a major challenge being faced in the last few decades.
    This issue is effectively addressed by using alternate cultivation mediums in
    different vertical farming setups. Three types of soilless vertical farming setups
    are practiced to facilitate cultivation without soil: aeroponics, hydroponics,
    and aquaponics [4]. These farming methods resolve the issue of decreasing availability
    of cultivatable land, by eliminating the dependency on soil as the cultivation
    medium. The cultivation medium for aeroponics is air and that for hydroponics
    and aquaponics is water. All the nutrient requirements of the plant are sufficient
    by infusing the air or water with the nutrient solution. The possibility of damage
    due to pests and rodents is eliminated in the case of soilless cultivation methods.
    Diseases like fungal infection in plants also impose a huge loss in the agricultural
    sector which is still a possibility in soilless cultivation but the intensity
    of such losses is mitigated to less than 50% as compared to soil cultivation methods.
    This further enhances the productivity of the crops in soilless vertical farming
    methods [5]. Fig. 1 depicts the three major types of soilless cultivation methods.
    FIGURE 1. Types of soilless cultivation methods. Show All These setups consist
    of vertically stacked rows where cultivation is carried out, thus justifying the
    name ‘vertical farming’. Therefore, in a considerably small area, cultivated yield
    is increased multiple times because the cultivation is carried out in vertically
    stacked layers [6]. Though the issues of less land for cultivation, and an increase
    in demand for medicinal plants can be addressed, another major issue comes up
    when it comes to dedicating time to the farming process. Urban people follow hectic
    work schedules and vertical farming methods need continuous monitoring for the
    better yield and efficient working of the process. This issue was then resolved
    by making the vertical farming setups smart [6]. Sensors, microcontrollers, clouds,
    LED, buzzers, pumps, actuators, etc. are attached to the vertical system which
    helps in continuous monitoring of the system, making it smarter and more efficient.
    All the parameters are monitored by using specific sensors, which communicate
    with the cloud for analysis and further actions are taken according to the analysis
    of the real-time data generated from the sensors. This method is termed smart
    precision farming. Providing all the necessary growing conditions to plants externally,
    in smart precision farming is termed as Controlled environment agriculture (CEA).
    CEA along with vertical farming methods ensures all the optimal required conditions
    for the medicinal plant to produce the maximum yield in a comparatively shorter
    vegetation period and minimal loss due to damage. Thus, sustainable, year-round,
    qualitative produce is ensured along with multiplied quantity [7]. Apart from
    the increasing demand for various agricultural produce, the demand for cultivation
    of medicinal plants is also increasing at an exponential pace. The potential of
    the cultivation of medicinal plants like onion, has to be maximized to meet the
    continuous qualitative and quantitative demands of rural and urban habitats. Rural
    habitats have a very high dependency on the cultivation and production of medicinal
    plants due to several reasons like lack of modern health facilities, cultural
    priorities and beliefs, cost of modern drugs, etc. Medicinal plants have a very
    high impact on the lives of the urban habitats too due to their healing properties.
    Some vertical farming method enhances shoot growth whereas other enhances root
    growth [8]. The cultivation of herbaceous medicinal plants has to be ensured in
    such a way of precision vertical farming, that the part of the plant used for
    medicinal use, has a better growth response than that in the substrate cultivation
    methods. Therefore, the growth responses of various herbaceous medicinal plants
    need to be checked for different precision farming methods to identify the best-suited
    method that gives a year-round and better qualitative and quantitative yield [9].
    The year-round production of herbaceous medicinal plants will not only enhance
    the economic benefit but also ensure the year-round availability of medicinal
    herbs for living beings. The reasons like compromised, unhealthy lifestyles caused
    by hectic work schedules, and increased pollution in the lifestyles of the urban
    population are causing a lot of health issues and other ailments. Commercially
    available medicines and modern treatments also cause severe side effects. Medicinal
    plants are thus, the most trusted source of medications that cure illnesses without
    having adverse effects on the health of the individual. One such important medicinal
    plant is Allium cepa, commonly known as onion. Apart from being a widely used
    condiment plant around the world, it also has many medicinal benefits [10], [11].
    Dried onions come in the form of powder and can be used as spices. Onions are
    overloaded with Vitamin B, vitamin C, calcium, phosphorous, etc., and can also
    be used to extract oil [10]. Many of its constituents like thiosulphates, phenolic
    acids, and quercetin contribute to its therapeutic effects [12]. Many disorders,
    such as asthma, inflammation, scars, pain, wounds, etc. are effectively treated
    by onion. It is also found to possess important pharmacological properties like
    anti-cancer, anti-hypertensive, anti-spasmodic, anti-diarrheal, and anti-diabetics
    along with being effective for bones, nervous systems, cardiovascular systems,
    respiratory disorders, etc. The three basic utility areas of onions are shown
    in Fig. 2. FIGURE 2. Major utilities of onion. Show All Onion cultivation also
    plays a pivotal role in boosting the economy of many nations like China, Egypt,
    Nepal, Turkey, Afghanistan, and various regions of India [11], [12]. It is cultivated
    in huge amounts in many Indian states, making India one of the leading producers
    of onions [10], [13], [14], [15]. India is recorded to produce around 21% of the
    total onion production of the world, which is led by China with around 26% of
    the global onion production. To reach the zenith of economic growth from agricultural
    production, cultivation of economically potent crops like onion. The qualitative
    yield of onions can be enhanced by monitoring the environmental conditions, which
    can be easily achieved by using Internet of Things (IoT) sensors. Onion is the
    major medicinal food crop that is exported among vegetables in India. revenues
    as large as Rs. 222,70.3 million had been generated from exporting onions in 2015
    which has increased to Rs. 523.8 million in 2022 [14]. India is the second leading
    exporter of onion after China. Cultivation and export of high-quality onion can
    form the basis for improving the Indian economy. Traditional cultivation methods
    have unlimited limitations, like risks, demand-supply mismatch, poor soil quality,
    and lesser arable land, that cause a hindrance towards onion cultivation thus
    leading to an adverse effect on the Indian economy [10], [12], [15]. Concerning
    the significant boost in the Indian economy from onion export and the continuously
    decreasing farming land and natural resources, there is a dire need to enhance
    the cultivation of onions. This can be achieved by prioritizing precision farming
    techniques using hydroponics to cultivate onions. IoT is a vast network of smart
    devices that connects things to people anytime, and anywhere [16], [17]. These
    systems are capable of making decisions with minimal human interference and thus,
    make systems faster, smarter, and more efficient [18]. The number of connected
    smart devices encompassing IoTs has increased drastically and is further predicted
    to surpass 43 billion by 2023, making them a part of almost every application
    [19]. One of the major areas of application of IoT is agriculture. It forms the
    backbone of smart precision farming. Hydroponics is a method of smart precision
    farming which practices soilless cultivation, by using nutrient-rich water as
    the cultivation medium for plants [20]. Out of all the vertical farming methods,
    hydroponics outperforms the rest in terms of increased yield, lesser cost, easier
    maintenance, feasibility in various scenarios, water consumption, environmental
    sustainability, and wider adaptability. The hydroponic cultivation method is much
    more scalable than the other vertical farming methods because it can be modified
    and scaled according to the adaptability of the herbs to be cultivated. It comprises
    different setups to adapt to various types of plants. Some of the most popular
    types are nutrient film technique (NFT), ebb and flow, deep water culture (DWC),
    drip system, and wick system [21], [22], [23], [24], [25], [26]. Thus, smart precision
    farming in hydroponics is the key solution to all the issues of urban farming,
    including increased year-round qualitative and quantitative food demand. Fig.
    3 represents the various types of hydroponic setups. FIGURE 3. Various types of
    hydroponic setups. Show All The selection of hydroponic technique out of all the
    five types listed above is dependent upon many factors, such as plant height,
    structure, irrigation needs, root anatomy, vegetation cycle, etc. DWC is considered
    to be the best-suited setup for the hydroponic cultivation of onions due to the
    compatibility with various growing requirements of onions as well as the cost
    and feasibility of establishing and maintaining the setup. In [27], the author
    carried out two experiments of centrosema, stylosanthes, trifolium, and lotus
    cultivation in soil medium, and the effect of vesicular-arbuscular mycorrhiza
    on the cultivation was studied in various compositions of soil nutrients. The
    results showed the total fresh weight, root/shoot ratio, and the percentage of
    mycorrhizal infection. In [28], the authors have carried out the growth response
    analysis of cucumber and the effect on its growth using the T-203 strain of the
    biocontrol agent Trichoderma harzianum in soil and axenic hydroponic conditions.
    In [29], soybean cultivation was carried out in controlled soilless conditions
    using four different nutrient concentrations, i.e. 0%, 50%, 100%, and 150%. The
    results showed significant variations in growth and all the measured parameters
    under these different conditions. The root thrived the most in 50% nutrient concentration,
    whereas the shoot growth was maximum in 150% concentration of nutrients. Three
    growth mediums i.e. cork thin waste with rice hulls, peat, and coir fiber were
    compared in three soilless cultivation methods, and the microbial influence, pH,
    and EC were analyzed in [30]. In [31], two varieties of lettuce were cultivated
    to analyze their growth on different types of media in a wick system of hydroponics
    using three mediums: cocopeat, Rockwool, and charcoal, whereby it was found that
    charcoal husk showed the best cultivation results. Rice was cultivated in a hydroponic
    setup and the effect of sodium and potassium chloride was analyzed in [32]. The
    rice seedling shoot was sensitive to KCL. In [35], different nitrogen sources
    were supplied to lettuce from two sources, one source with 200 ppm NO 3–N, and
    the other with 150 ppm NO 3–N and 50 ppm NH 4+-N. The highest growth was recorded
    using 200 ppm NO 3–N. The authors of [36] have cultivated legumes called Serra
    Della in aluminum-toxic soil to conclude that AI tolerance varies among various
    cultivars. In [24], a certain variety of lily is cultivated in an ebb-and-flow
    system of hydroponic cultivation where statistical analyses showed no correlation
    between the weights of the initial and the final bulblets. Elongation of roots
    and growth and survival of bulblets were dependent upon the hydroponic setup,
    the substrate type, and the composition of the nutrients in the solution medium.
    ‘Rubinela’ lettuce was cultivated in soil-filled pots and hydroponic systems by
    the authors of [38] where the research aimed to analyze its physiology through
    a comparative analysis of dry and fresh mass, production, leaf count, chlorophyll,
    and carotenoid contents. It was found that the hydroponic plants showed prominent
    variations in chlorophyll content, with more biomass than those grown in soil.
    In [39], the authors built an innovative hydroponic fuel cell to reduce methane
    emissions from rice plants. Rice was cultivated in a hydroponic setup where the
    results show that the methane emission was significantly reduced with the use
    of these cells. The effect of actinomycetes on hydroponic lettuce was studied
    in [40], where it was found that mitigation of detrimental effects in various
    growth parameters was found using Streptomyces thermocarboxydus S3 type of actinomycete.
    In [25], the authors have grown basil in soil and hydroponics, where the hydroponic
    basils had more browning than hydroponic ones at the end of storage and shelf-life
    periods. An IoT-based smart NFT setup was created in [26] where various environmental
    parameters were collected in a Raspberry Pi database. A Proteus simulator was
    also used for analyzing the results, where a “very good” rating was given to the
    implemented device. The authors of [41] propose a method to combine the theoretical
    and practical of aquaponic and hydroponic farms by modeling and simulating the
    systems. Petri nets were used for modeling and the GPenSIM tool was used for the
    simulation and monitoring. Support vector regression (SVR) was also used to predict
    the temperatures of air water and humidity. The research in [42], investigates
    the economic and technical feasibility of greenhouses in arid regions on a larger
    scale, where the results demonstrate that these systems have a massive potential
    to show considerable climate resilience which helps to enable vegetation in arid
    and infertile regions. The following research gaps have been identified from the
    background study regarding growth response analysis of medicinal plants: Growth
    responses of various herbaceous plants have been compared in previous studies,
    but very little research is focused particularly on the cultivation and yield
    enhancement of medicinal herbs [27], [28], [29], [30], [31], [32], [35], [36].
    Medicinal herbs add to the essential nutrient contents in edible products of humans
    and livestock. Herbal medicines are also preferred over the chemical medicines
    available commercially because they are devoid of harmful side effects. Medicinal
    herbs eliminate food security issues and ensure healthy lifestyles in rural and
    urban habitats. Thus, the need of the hour is to enhance the cultivation and yield
    of medicinal plants. In the existing research works, either the root [24], [35],
    [36], [37] or the shoot growth responses are monitored [25], [28], [38], [39],
    [40] not both. The comparative growth responses of any plant are carried out only
    in any one medium, growth responses in multiple mediums are not analyzed for a
    single plant [24], [28], [30], [31], [32], [33], [34], [35], [36]. Either the
    growth responses of a plant are analyzed in actual cultivation [27], [28], [29],
    [30], [31], [32], [35], [36], [42] or the analysis is done using the simulator,
    the incorporation of both methods in a single experiment is not found [26], [41],
    [42]. This research focuses on the analysis based on actual experimentation as
    well as results obtained from the ‘AquaCrop’ simulator. The present investigation
    was guided by the formulation of the following research questions: Which hydroponic
    setup is most suitable for growing herbaceous medicinal bulbs? What is the comparative
    growth analysis for the growth of onions in traditional and hydroponic methods?
    How relatable are the actual results as compared to the simulator results? Which
    method is more beneficial, in terms of environmental footprint, expenses, and
    yield of the medicinal plant under consideration? Which method is more effective
    in terms of energy consumption? The novelty of this research lies in the fact
    that a real-time comparative analysis of root as well as shoot growth responses
    of onion, a medicinal plant, is carried out in this experiment. The experimental
    results are then verified and validated using a simulator. Very few works have
    focused on the better qualitative and quantitative yield of the root as well as
    the shoot of any medicinal plant [27], [28], [29], [30], [31], [32], [35], [36].
    Some of the research works focus on only the root [24], [35], [36], [37] or only
    the shoot of any plant [25], [28], [38], [39], [40]. This work demonstrates the
    root and shoot growth responses of a medicinal plant (onion) having abundant medicinal
    properties in its shoot as well as its root. Also in previous works, the growth
    responses have been analyzed on any one method of cultivation [24], [28], [30],
    [31], [32], [33], [34], [35], [36], whereas the authors have considered the analysis
    of root and shoot growth response comparison in soil cultivation as well as in
    hydroponics. No previous work includes the verification and validation of the
    actual results with the simulator results, either the actual cultivation is carried
    out [27], [28], [29], [30], [31], [32], [35], [36], [42] or the simulation is
    carried out [26], [41], [42] not both. All these aspects are incorporated in this
    research work where the actual cultivation results in soil as well as hydroponics
    are verified and validated with the results of the ‘AquaCrop’ simulator. The main
    objective of the research is to enhance productivity and obtain a better qualitative
    and quantitative yield of onion in a shorter span, all round the year. Thus, the
    results of this research will be helpful for the agricultural, medical, as well
    as economic benefit of any nation. The major contributions of this research article
    are mentioned as follows: The necessity and importance of soilless cultivation
    methods in modern urban localities are discussed in terms of various parameters.
    The authors have highlighted the advantages of soilless cultivation over soil
    cultivation methods in terms of better, faster, and year-round yield. Parameters
    like space optimization, resource conservation, increased year-round yield, and
    shorter vegetation period are considered for a comparative analysis of hydroponic
    and soil cultivation methods in this research. The emerging need to cultivate
    medicinal plants via vertical farming methods is explained in context to the nutritional
    components and medicinal properties of onion shoots and roots. The effect of onion
    cultivation on the economy of India is also discussed, which adds to its importance
    as one of the majorly exported medicinal food crops. In this research, various
    types of hydroponic setups are discussed. The workings and components of a smart
    hydroponic setup are also explained. Out of the five most popular classifications
    of hydroponic setups, DWC is identified as the most suitable setup for the cultivation
    of onion. Classification of various types of medicinal plants is done based on
    their medicinal properties in their roots and shoots. The trend of using medicinal
    plants in India is also shown along with the trend of IoT and sensor-enabled hydroponics
    in the last year. Onion bulbs are cultivated in the soil as well as in DWC hydroponics.
    The growth responses of onion shoots, roots, and bulbs are monitored, analyzed,
    and compared in qualitative and quantitative terms. The obtained results are also
    verified and validated using the ‘AquaCrop’ simulator in both mediums. The rest
    of the paper is organized as: section II covers the extensive background study
    regarding smart hydroponic farming, medicinal plants, and onion as a medicinal
    plant. Section III encompasses the materials and methods employed in the process
    of this experiment, and the results and discussions are projected in Section IV.
    Finally, the article is concluded in Section V. SECTION II. Background Study This
    section deals with the extensive literature studied concerning smart hydroponic
    farming methods associated with the cultivation of onions. Three subsections are
    created to present a detailed overview of each aspect. The first subsection deals
    with the study of the hydroponic method of smart precision farming, and the second
    subsection gives a detailed overview of various types and classifications of medicinal
    plants. The third and final subsection of this topic deals specifically with the
    importance of onion as a medicinal plant, its growing period, and its cultivation
    in smart hydroponic setups. A. Hydroponic Type of Smart Precision Farming Hydroponic
    type of precision agriculture is the agricultural process that uses water as the
    cultivation medium and inputs the precise values of the agricultural conditions
    to the system to obtain the best possible yield with the use of IoTs [43]. The
    IoT usage makes the system more intelligent and self-sustaining, thus consuming
    less time and effort for the farmer along with enhancing the cultivated produce
    [3]. Fig. 4 explains the working of a smart precision hydroponic setup. The smart
    hydroponic farm is integrated with the cloud to analyze sensor data and the farmer
    can monitor and control the farm remotely. This will help serve the multiple purposes
    of having a healthier living, a cleaner surrounding environment, easy and handy
    cultivation methods, domestic as well as economic benefits to the cultivators,
    etc. FIGURE 4. Working with a smart precision hydroponic setup. Show All A fully
    automatized greenhouse integrated with the hydroponic type of vertical farming
    ensuring provisions for security and surveillance is proposed which makes it an
    advanced and diverse form of all the existing models. It is observed to provide
    an improved product with a cent percent success rate, maintaining the ranges of
    the parameters [44]. An automatic aeroponic system of cultivation for lettuce
    while keeping the humidity, time taken for irrigation, temperature, etc. in control
    and spraying the nutrient mist to the plant root, is proposed as a cost-effective
    Arduino-based system using IoT [45]. IoT tools connected to a web server help
    in monitoring the variables remotely. As compared to the traditional processes
    of cultivation, lettuce leaves as well as roots grew more than 40% with around
    400% better performance, had been recorded [46]. The system designed in this study
    is capable of keeping healthy growing parametric conditions for the crops automatically,
    irrespective of the prevailing climatic conditions, and with minimum user interference.
    It shows the temporal variations, light intensity variations, temperature, humidity,
    electrical conductivity, pH, and CO2. To show better vigilance in a hydroponic
    setup, the system even monitors the level of water in the storage. Smart cooling
    is ensured of lettuce roots in the smart aeroponic setup for lettuce cultivation.
    The temperature and humidity data are also retrieved in [47]. Cost-effectiveness
    is maintained using a fan that is connected to the Arduino board to ensure continuous
    data recording. An application for mobile phones is employed to get the data.
    An Excel sheet is updated and kept and updated every week by the farm owner. This
    increased the lettuce growth and also the inorganic nutrients absorbed by the
    plant [48]. Role of IoT to control the growth and communication of alerts to the
    user using web applications. The controlled plants are found to show better growth
    responses than those cultivated in an uncontrolled environment and also there
    are fewer unwanted values in the case of controlled growth of plants. The growth
    responses of plants are shown as a figure on the website app and the values violating
    the preset ranges can be identified conveniently and efficiently. Subsequently,
    the farm owners are notified, and thereby minimum losses are incurred by activating
    the alternative control measures present in the system [49]. To improve the efficiency
    of hydroponic cultivation, Electrical conductivity (EC), fluid level, total dissolved
    solids (TDS), and the potential of Hydrogen (pH) values are controlled automatically.
    Facilitation data collected continuously, from a large number of sensors, in urban
    farms, a system is developed for adjusting the pH value automatically, and in
    the cultivation of lettuce using a neural network is developed to facilitate continuous
    data collection from multiple sensors in urban farm conditions [50]. A study based
    on image processing is put forth to check the percentage of deficit of macronutrients
    in a hydroponic environment [51]. Determination of a lack of macronutrients can
    be done in multiple phases such as acquisition and pre-processing of images, feature
    extraction, image segmentation, task identification, and estimation. IoT is used
    to process image data acquisition automatically. The plant under consideration
    in [52] is chili. The main feature of this research work is to improve the output
    of the precision agricultural methods, three of the features were combined in
    the form of the texture, color, and shape of the leaf. This study is also focused
    on estimating various plant condition types like a deficit of nutrients like Sulphur,
    calcium, potassium, magnesium, etc., or a healthy plant condition. A model is
    aimed to be built that is capable of performing identification as well as estimation.
    Along with analyzing multiple nutrients. B. Types of Medicinal Plants With Medicinal
    Values in Various Parts Medicinal plants have always held major importance in
    the lives of all living beings [53]. Various parts of the medicinal plants are
    put to use in various ways. In plants like ginger, turmeric, burdock, and ginseng,
    roots have medicinal properties of antioxidants, anti-tumor, enhanced immune system,
    etc. [52], [55], [59], whereas in plants like basil and thyme, the leaves have
    medicinal properties of liver detoxifier, disinfectant, reliever of the wound,
    kidney stones, muscle aches, etc. [25], and in plants like lavender and saffron,
    the flowers contain medicinal values of stress, pain and anxiety reliever, helpful
    in Alzheimer disease and depression [57], [58]. The vertical precision farming
    methods are best suited for herbs and thus, the herbaceous medicinal plants must
    be analyzed in terms of the smart precision vertical farming method that suits
    them the best [53]. A generalized answer to this question cannot be found because
    each medicinal plant has a different part that is put to use for its medicinal
    value. Thus, the plants whose roots are used for medicinal purposes would need
    a different precision vertical farming method whereas the plants whose leaves
    or flowers or any other part of the shoot would need a different method of precision
    vertical farming method for it to thrive to the fullest. Fig. 5 is a representation
    of examples of herbaceous medicinal plants with various parts having medicinal
    properties. FIGURE 5. Examples of herbaceous plants with medicinal values. Show
    All Every medicinal plant has medicinal properties in different parts of the plant.
    Some plants have medicinal properties in the shoot part (stem, leaves, fruits,
    or flowers), and some may have medicinal properties in the root part. Lettuce
    and barley are examples of medicinal leaves, whereas tomato and broccoli are medicinal
    fruits. Garlic and onions are seen to have medicinal values in their bulb roots,
    and ginger and ginseng are examples of roots that contain medicinal properties.
    Thus, to employ the vertical farming method for herbaceous medicinal plants, the
    part of the plant containing the medicinal properties needs to be identified [54].
    Thereafter, a suitable cultivation method can be used to cultivate the identified
    plant and a smart precision farming method can be used to cultivate it. The authors
    of [55] tested the growth of medicinal plants in aeroponics and hydroponics whereby
    no significant variation is seen in the shoot growth characteristics of the plants.
    The ginseng roots contain healing properties which makes it very important to
    maintain its root quality. Rotting of roots is a major disease-causing deterioration
    of ginseng root quality. The authors in [56] proposed a way to detect the disease-causing
    rotting of roots by checking the colored images of the plant through image processing
    and deep learning. The authors in [57] checked three categories of medicinal herbs
    in multiple hydroponic setups and one aeroponic setup. Post that results comparisons
    are done with plants grown in substrate medium, with exactly similar environmental
    conditions. An innovative frame of aeroponic setup was formed in [58] to enhance
    the produced quality of Burdock root (Arctium lappa L.) cultivated in an aeroponic
    method in a controlled soilless greenhouse environment. The production of biomass
    from the aerial parts of the plant was found to be considerably high in an aeroponic
    setup as compared to the controlled cases. Whereas the biomass yields of the root
    of the plant did not exhibit any significant variations between treatments. The
    authors in [52] and [59] found that hydroponic techniques are optimal in reproducibly
    and efficiently generating the medicinal herb Withania somnifera (L.). Fig. 6
    shows the Google trend plots showing interest and trends in smart hydroponic farming
    of onion over the past 12 months, specifically in India. The trends of Onion and
    IoT are increasing at a very fast pace. FIGURE 6. Plot obtained from Google trends
    showing the trend of medicinal plants, IoTs, sensors, and hydroponics in India
    for the past year. Show All C. Onion (Allium CEPA) Onion is a category of medicinal
    plant that has medicinal properties in its shoot as well as in its bulb. Onion
    can be cultivated in three seasons, namely, Rabi, Kharif, and Late Kharif. Table
    1 is a tabular representation of the various growing seasons of onion. The production
    cycle of onion, if shortened, can be advantageous to mankind in multifold ways
    [12], [13], [15]. TABLE 1 Production Cycle of Onion Apart from being loaded with
    vitamins, minerals, and other beneficial medicinal, pharmacological, and therapeutic
    properties, onions are also loaded with several nutritional components. It has
    the capability of curing various ailments and health disorders. The authors of
    [10], [13], and [15] have come up with the amount of nutritional components per
    100 grams of the edible portion of onion. Energy, carbohydrates, sugars, fibre,
    fat, protein, various vitamins, calcium, iron, manganese, phospsorous, and potassium
    are the major component found in onion. Table 2 is a generalized representation
    of the nutritional contents contained in the edible portion of onion. TABLE 2
    Nutritional Components Per 100 Grams, in the Edible Portion of Onion SECTION III.
    Materials and Methods This section deals with the materials used in the cultivation
    of onion bulbs in soil as well as in water mediums. Onion is the medicinal plant
    selected as the experimental subject in this experiment because it contains medicinal
    value in its shoot as well as in its bulb. Onion thrives well in water as well
    as soil mediums. This experiment comprises the cultivation of onion bulbs in in
    substrate medium and DWC hydroponic system, a comparative analysis of their growth
    responses, and validation of the obtained results with the results obtained from
    the ‘AquaCrop’ simulator. The soil was prepared for onion cultivation by adding
    sand and compost and making it moist. Onion bulbs were slit from the top and planted
    in soil in a way that ample space is maintained between the onion bulbs to ensure
    proper root and shoot growth. The water used for onion cultivation was infused
    with essential nutrients as mentioned in Table 2. The growth responses of onion
    were monitored and compared in soil and hydroponic methods. Onion growth was found
    to be much faster and more qualitative in water as compared to its growth in soil.
    Fig. 7 represents the flowchart of the overall framework of the experimental work
    done in the experiment. FIGURE 7. Flowchart of the proposed experiment. Show All
    The input parameters of soil and DWC cultivation were set in the ‘AquaCrop’ simulator
    separately and the experimental results were then verified and validated through
    the results obtained from the simulator. The comparative analysis of onion growth
    was thus carried out in an actual experimental setup as well as in the ‘AquaCrop’
    simulator. The substrate cultivation has to be carried out when the weather conditions
    are favorable for its growth, whereas, in the smart DWC hydroponic cultivation,
    the cultivation can be done at any time of the year because all the environmental
    conditions and the nutrient requirements can be monitored in real-time and controlled
    as per the requirements of the plant. This ensures year-round qualitative and
    quantitative produce. The DWC hydroponic method uses a specific setup where the
    roots of the plants are submerged in nutrient-rich water. The pH, EC, and nutrient
    content of the growing medium are monitored continuously for any alteration, and
    the nutrient-infused water is also changed periodically to ensure proper nutrient
    intake by the plants. A smart DWC setup carries out the additional task of maintaining
    a CEA in the cultivation system whereby the pH, temperature, TDS, and other essential
    parameters are controlled externally. Onion plants have medicinal properties in
    their shoot as well as in their bulbs. The onion shoots grow much faster and can
    be harvested sometimes before the onion bulbs are developed and harvested. Till
    the time the shoots are thick and green at the base, they can be harvested repeatedly.
    Once the shoot dries up and wilts from the base, the bulbs are ready to be harvested.
    Onion bulbs were planted simultaneously in a DWC hydroponic setup and soil medium.
    The growth responses of onion root and shoot were compared in both the mediums
    and it was verified and validated with the results obtained from the ‘AquaCrop’
    simulator. A. Controlled Parameters for Optimal Onion Growth Many researches have
    proved that the cultivation of onions under controlled environmental conditions
    has produced enhanced and uniform shoot growth and bulb formation of onion plants.
    Onions were cultivated simultaneously in a smart DWC setup and soil. Soil cultivation
    is dependent on the natural resources and climatic conditions, thus it has to
    be carried out in the season which suits its requirements, whereas the cultivation
    in a smart DWC setup can be carried out at any time of the year. A low relative
    humidity and high-temperature help in enhancing the shoot and bulb growth of onions,
    whereas a high relative humidity causes fungal and bacterial growth on the onion
    bulbs. Fig. 8 (a) is a picture of fungus fungus-inflicted onion bulb, and Fig.
    8 (b) shows the root growth of the fungus-infected onion bulb in the DWC hydroponic
    setup. FIGURE 8. (a) Fungus-inflicted onion bulb. (b) Root growth of n inflicted
    onion bulb in hydroponics. Show All The life cycle of onion is also affected by
    temperature fluctuations. Higher temperatures cause early bulb development in
    onions, therefore ensuring precise temperature while studying various growth phases
    of onion cultivation is important. The light source used in the experiment was
    natural sunlight for optimum daylight. B. Pests and Disease Control Onion bulbs
    are prone to fly infestation and fungal infections. Cultivation of onions under
    controlled environmental conditions ensures minimized damage due to pest and disease
    infestations. These pests and diseases must be managed efficiently with continuous
    monitoring of the system, especially in greenhouses. A few precautions to be taken
    while cultivating in any controlled environment can be mentioned: Maintaining
    cleanliness in and around the growing area. The substrate mix must be kept tightly
    sealed before and after use to avoid drying up or infestation. Use preferable
    new potting units or sterilized, washed with the bleach solution, and rinsed thoroughly.
    Using insect repellants or sticky insect traps for real-time control of fly and
    pest infestations. Dead, wilted, or damaged plants must be removed from the setup
    regularly to ensure the safety of the other plants in the setup. Diseased and
    weak plants are more prone to infections. C. Smart DWC Hydroponics Setup A representation
    of the commonly used components of an IoT-enabled smart precision agriculture
    setup is depicted in Fig. 9. The smart precision agriculture setup is equipped
    with a sensor module and an actuator module. A microcontroller acts as an interface
    between the entire hardware system and the cloud or the communication gateway.
    The sensor module collects data on various parameters. All the sensors are preset
    with a particular range. The data collected in real-time is then sent to the cloud
    for analysis [60]. If any value is found to drop below the lower limit of the
    set range or exceed the upper value of the range, the user or the farm owner will
    be notified of the situation. FIGURE 9. Components of an IoT-enabled smart precision
    agriculture setup. Show All If the setup is well equipped with actuators, corresponding
    alternative arrangements could also be activated to get the data value of the
    sensors in range to regain the smooth functioning of the smart precision farming
    setup. The fact that the cultivation is done in a CEA setup, ensures high-quality,
    year-round produce which eliminates the dependency on climatic conditions and
    thus reduces wastage or damage in agricultural produce to a large extent [61],
    [62], [63]. Fig. 10 is a pictorial representation of the components of a smart
    DWC setup. The components of the setup can be broadly classified into two categories:
    hardware components and software components. The hardware components can be further
    classified into two subcategories: sensor module and actuator module. FIGURE 10.
    Various components of the smart DWC setup are used. Show All The sensor module
    is responsible for collecting real-time data on the parameters that are controlled
    in the setup. Sensors to monitor temperature, pH, water level, and humidity are
    deployed in the system to collect real-time data on the respective parameters.
    Every sensor is provided with the permissible parametric range, and the values
    collected by the sensors are then sent to the cloud for analysis. If the values
    are found to violate the specified range, the actuators are instructed to facilitate
    the situation. Actuators are hardware components like fans, water pumps, nutrient
    pumps, buzzers, etc. that are used to keep the parametric values within the range.
    This is very helpful to the urban habitats that perform vertical farming, where
    they can have a remote check on the farm and the system takes care of the farm.
    Fig. 11 shows the various hardware components used in the smart DWC setup. The
    hardware components used in the setup can be described as: Temperature sensor:
    According to the requirement of onion, the temperature sensor was set with a range
    of 29°C – 32°C. The Arduino microcontroller board receives the real-time temperature
    values collected by the temperature sensor and analyses the values concerning
    the specified range. If the recorded temperature is beyond 32°C, the fans are
    activated and the temperature is lowered. When the temperature comes within the
    range, the fan is switched off. The experiment was carried out in August – September
    when the temperature did not fall too low. Thus, the lower level of temperature
    was maintained. pH sensor: The pH value is set to 6.0 – 6.4. If at any moment,
    the pH value drops below 6.0, sodium carbonate (Na2CO3) is added to the mater
    medium, alternatively if the pH rises above 6.4, nitric acid (HNO3) is added to
    the growing medium to balance the pH of water. Humidity sensor: A minimum of 66
    % and a maximum of 70 % humidity is suitable for growth of onion. More than 70%
    humidity causes fungal infestations on the bulbs of onion which hampers the proper
    growth of onion shoots. The humidity sensor monitors the humidity and sends the
    collected value to the microcontroller. If the humidity rises above 70 %, the
    fans are used to circulate dry air, and if the humidity falls below 60%, the mist
    spray is activated to increase the humidity and bring it within the range. Water
    level sensor: The DWC setup has a stagnant nutrient solution in which the roots
    of the plant are submerged. The water level of the cultivation units has to be
    maintained to a level where there is a little gap between the water level and
    the lid of the box to ensure space for vapor. CO2 and O2 sensors: Both CO2 and
    O2 are required in the nutrient solution for the optimal growth and development
    of the hydroponic plant. These sensors notify the users if the CO2 level exceeds
    900 ppm or the O2 level drops below 18%. The nutrient solution of the DWC setup
    is then replaced with a fresh one. Buzzer and LED display: These hardware components
    in the smart DWC hydroponic system help in facilitating continuous monitoring
    of the system and send alerts in case of any unwanted situation. A smart DWC hydroponic
    setup implementing CEA is used for cultivating onions for this experiment. Table
    3 shows the optimal parametric ranges required by onions in a DWC hydroponic system
    and their corresponding values or ranges [10], [12], [15]. TABLE 3 Parameters
    and Their Permissible Ranges for Growth of Onion in a DWC Hydroponic System FIGURE
    11. Various hardware components are used in the smart DWC setup. (a) LED; (b)
    Insect Trap; (c) Mist Spray; (d) Temperature Sensor. Show All A static nitrogen-rich
    nutrient solution is provided as the cultivation medium for the onions. The culture
    unit used in this experiment consists of plastic boxes. Each of the boxes has
    a capacity of 1 L of the nutrient solution. Holes of 1 – 1.5 cm diameter were
    drilled in the center of the lids of each of the boxes, and 4 other holes of 0.5
    cm diameter were drilled around it as shown in Fig. 12. FIGURE 12. Onion bulbs
    are planted in boxes filled with nutrient-mixed solution. Show All The bigger
    hole was for the onion to immerse its roots in the nutrient solution inside the
    box, and the four smaller holes were drilled to ensure proper ventilation and
    release of heat from the inside of the box. Onions can be harvested as immature
    spring onions or full-grown bulbs. To ensure proper growing space for each of
    the onion bulbs, all the onions were planted in separate boxes. The onion bulbs
    were planted at the end of July. The nutrient solution was changed every week
    to ensure proper nutrition to the plants and avoid algae formation inside the
    boxes. Fig. 13 depicts a case where algae formation was found at the bottom of
    the hydroponic container. A pH level of 5.8 to 6.9 and an EC level of 1.4 to 1.8
    was maintained throughout the cultivation process. FIGURE 13. Algae formation
    at the bottom of the container. Show All D. Substrate Cultivation The onion needs
    a substrate that has a good aeration and water retention capacity. Sandy or heavy
    soil types are the most suitable soil types for onion cultivation. garden soil,
    sand, and compost are mixed to make the growing medium ready for onion cultivation.
    The moisture retention capacity determines the frequency of watering. The moist
    substrate is one of the important requirements for the healthy growth of onions.
    The stage of plant development along with the relative humidity and temperature
    maintained in the growth chamber determines the frequency of watering the plants.
    Growing stages require more frequent watering as compared to the maturity stage.
    The onion bulbs were cultivated at the end of July when an average temperature
    of 22 – 38 °C temperature was prevailing in the Punjab region. An average relative
    humidity of 60 – 70 % prevailed in the region during the mentioned period. A tabular
    representation of the necessary parameters for cultivating onions in soil is shown
    in Table 4 [10], [12], [15]. TABLE 4 Parameters and Their Permissible Ranges for
    Growth of Onion in Soil Medium Fig. 14 (a) shows plastic trays of dimensions (
    20×15 ) cm filled with soil and 4 onion bulbs uniformly planted in it. Optimum
    distribution of air and water was ensured to maximize the growth of the plants.
    Regular watering is done in the soil using distilled water to prevent algae growth
    on the soil surface. Colorless plastic trays were used to ensure proper passing
    of light to the onion roots. Also, dark-colored pots absorb much heat and cause
    damage to the plants. FIGURE 14. Cultivation of onion bulbs in soil. (a) Onion
    bulbs planted in soil; (b) LED depicting NPK contents in soil. Show All Fig. 14
    (b) is a picture of an instance where the LED displays the N, P, and K percentages
    in the soil. E. Results and Discussions The utility of onion in culinary, medicinal,
    and economic aspects, is discussed in the introduction section of the manuscript,
    which highlights its importance and the necessity for its better and enhanced
    yield. Apart from having a wide range of medicinal, therapeutic, and pharmacological
    properties, onion also contains various nutrients in its bulbs and shoots as mentioned
    in table 2 of the background study. It also plays a significant role in boosting
    the economy of India by being one of the majorly exported medicinal plants. Keeping
    in view all these aspects, the onion is selected for this research, and its root,
    shoot, and bulb growth in soil and DWC hydroponics are monitored, analyzed, and
    compared. Furthermore, the actual cultivation results are verified and validated
    with the results of the ‘AquaCrop’ simulator. The analysis of resulting growth
    responses of onion cultivated in soil and a smart DWC hydroponics is done in this
    section. The growth responses of onion shoot, root as well and bulb are analyzed
    based on the experiment conducted, and qualitative as well as quantitative yield
    analysis of the obtained yield is carried out. The obtained results were finally
    compared and validated with the results obtained from the simulator. The growth
    responses of shoot, root, and bulb in DWC hydroponics are found to outperform
    those in the soil cultivation method. F. Growth Comparison of Onion Shoots and
    Roots in Soil and DWC Hydroponics Onion bulbs were cultivated in the soil as well
    as in a DWC hydroponic setup. The plant with the best shoot growth is considered
    for the comparative analysis. In all the cases, the hydroponic roots and shoots
    showed the best growth responses as compared to soil cultivation. It is observed
    that the maximum length of onion shoot in hydroponics was found to reach 21.5
    cm, whereas the maximum onion shoot length attained in soil medium was 16 cm.
    As a result, the hydroponics proved to give almost 74.4 % better shoot yield as
    compared to soil. The root length obtained in the DWC hydroponic method was also
    found to be 21.43 % better and much faster as compared to that in soil. The graph
    in Fig. 15 is a comparative plot of the maximum shoot and root length of onion
    bulbs in water and soil mediums. FIGURE 15. Growth analysis of onion shoot and
    root growth cultivated in substrate and hydroponics. Show All G. Day-Wise Growth
    Comparison of Onion Shoots in Soil and DWC Hydroponics Fig. 16 (a) and (b) show
    the onion shoot measurement on day 15 of cultivation in soil and DWC hydroponics
    respectively. The growth of the onion shoot was found to be better in hydroponics
    than in soil. FIGURE 16. Shoot growth from onion bulbs on day 15 after planting.
    (a) Onion shoot growth in soil; (b) Onion shoot growth in water. Show All The
    plot in Fig. 17 demonstrates the growth trend of onion shoots in soil and water
    mediums. The lengths of the best sample of both the cases are considered and the
    day-wise graph is plotted. This graph proves that the DWC method of cultivation
    produces approximately 1.3 times better yield in less than half the number of
    days as compared to the results obtained when cultivated in a soil medium. FIGURE
    17. The day-wise plot of onion shoot lengths in soil and hydroponic methods respectively.
    Show All Therefore, in response to RQ. 1, it can be answered that the DWC hydroponics
    method is the best for the cultivation of herbaceous medicinal bulbs. H. Day-Wise
    Growth Comparison of Onion Roots in Soil and DWC Hydroponic Fig. 18 shows the
    picture of roots developed in both methods of cultivation on the fourth day after
    cultivation. it is visible that the root growth in the soil medium is considerably
    lesser than that in the water medium. FIGURE 18. Root growth of onion bulbs on
    day 4 after planting. (a) Onion root growth in soil; (b) Onion root growth in
    water. Show All The maximum root length recorded in soil medium was 9 cm whereas
    that recorded in water was 13 cm. The concept of analyzing the qualitative and
    quantitative comparison of the shoot, root as well as bulb growth characteristics
    of a medicinal plant with high economic value (onion), cultivated in water as
    well as in substrate mediums, which are further, verified and validated using
    simulator results in the same experiment, contribute to the novelty of this research.
    I. Onion Bulb Formation from Bulbs Cultivated in Soil and DWC Hydroponics Fig.
    19 depicts the bulb formation of onions in soil and hydroponics systems respectively.
    The quality of bulbs is found to be much better than that formed in soil and also
    the time required by the onion bulb to produce newer bulbs in soil medium is almost
    more than double the time taken by the hydroponic onion. FIGURE 19. Onion bulb
    formation. (a) Onion bulb formation in soil; (b) Onion bulb formation in water.
    Show All Thus, as a response to RQ. 2, it can be concluded that in all three cases,
    i.e., shoot growth, root growth, and bulb formation, hydroponics is found to outperform
    the soil cultivation method in terms of better quality, quantity, and lesser vegetation
    period. RQ. 4 can be answered as hydroponics outperforms soil cultivation method
    not only in qualitative and quantitative terms, but also has an advantage of being
    more certain in terms of yield, and less expensive. However, the negative environmental
    footprint is much higher in terms of energy usage in hydroponics as compared to
    the soil cultivation method. The entire setup and the external controlling of
    environmental conditions is carried out with the help of energy. To sum up, the
    answer to RQ. 5, the soil cultivation method is more efficient in terms of energy
    efficiency. J. Evaluation of Growth Responses of Onion Using ‘AquaCrop’ Simulator
    in Soil and DWC Hydroponic Systems The actual results of growth responses obtained
    from the experiment are then verified with the results obtained from the ‘AquaCrop’
    simulator. All the parametric requirements for optimal growth of hydroponic and
    soil onion shoots and bulbs as mentioned in Tables 3 and 4 are provided as input
    to the simulator. The growing conditions of DWC hydroponics and soil are input
    to the simulator separately. The results obtained from the simulator produced
    similar outputs as those obtained from the actual cultivation methods. Therefore,
    in response to RQ. 3 it can be stated that the actual and simulator results are
    similar and completely relatable. Fig. 20 is the screenshot of the simulator output
    screen showing the growth responses of the onion bulb in a DWC hydroponic setup.
    FIGURE 20. ‘AquaCrop’ simulation results for cultivation of onion in a DWC hydroponic
    setup. Show All It can be observed from Fig. 20 that the transpiration, canopy
    cover, and root growth are maximum when the growing conditions as per Table 3
    are input to the simulator. there is no gap between maximum and actual growth.
    Fig. 21 is the screenshot of the simulator output screen showing the growth responses
    of the onion bulb in a substrate medium. FIGURE 21. ’AquaCrop’ simulation results
    for cultivation of onion in substrate cultivation. Show All Transpiration in the
    soil, as well as DWC hydroponics, is maximum in the soil as well as in hydroponics.
    The simulator outputs of canopy cover (CC) in case of substrate cultivation results
    are shown in two colors: grey and green. The grey portion depicts the gap between
    the optimal and actual growth of the onion shoot. It can be seen that there is
    a considerable gap between the actual and optimal results of canopy cover in the
    case of the cultivation of onion bulbs in a substrate medium. All the necessary
    agronomic conditions including the most appropriate soil type are input to the
    simulator, still, the substrate cultivation methods do not always produce optimal
    results in terms of growth due to the presence of weeds and pests in the soil.
    Also, soil cultivation is dependent on natural resources and climatic uncertainties,
    which in turn causes depleted growth responses of agricultural produce. Table
    5 shows a tabular representation of the quantitative growth analysis of onion
    in DWC hydroponics and substrate mediums. TABLE 5 Quantitative Growth Analysis
    of Onion: DWC vs. Substrate Mediums The comparative analysis of the growth responses
    obtained in soil vs hydroponic cultivation as obtained from the simulator can
    be further demonstrated graphically in Fig. 22. FIGURE 22. Comparative plot of
    the biomass and dry yield of onion when cultivated in DWC and soil separately.
    Show All From Fig. 22, it can be inferred that the quantitative yield of onion
    is approximately 1.4 times more in DWC hydroponics, as compared to soil cultivation.
    This analysis is obtained from the ‘AquaCrop’ simulator which shows that the biomass
    of onion obtained in DWC is approximately 1.34 times as much as that obtained
    in the soil cultivation method. Simultaneously, the dry yield of onion is approximately
    1.44 times more in DWC than in soil. Thus, the comparative plot shows a better
    quantitative yield of onion in DWC hydroponics as compared to cultivation in soil,
    along with quantitative yield as inferred from the previous subsections of the
    result section. Therefore, technically summarizing the comparison of growth responses
    of onion in DWC hydroponic cultivation, it is found that with an optimum average
    temperature of 30 ± 2 °C, the humidity of 68 ± 2 %, pH of 6.2 ± 0.2, and EC of
    1.7 ± 0.5 mS/cm in a nutrient-infused water medium with N:P: K ratio of 10:20:10
    and 20:05:05 in initial and subsequent weeks respectively, produces onion shoots
    in 3 – 4 days from sowing and onion bulbs within 30 ± 2 days, irrespective of
    any month of the year. The maximum shoot and root lengths attained were 21.5 cm
    and 15 cm respectively. The TDS in the nutrient-infused water medium must also
    be maintained within 600 – 750 mg/l and the CO2 and O2 concentrations must be
    < 900 ppm and > 18 % respectively to attain the said yield. The biomass and dry
    yield as obtained from the ‘AquaCrop’ simulator results in DWC hydroponic conditions
    were found to be 2.125 and 1.167 respectively. Whereas in soil cultivation, it
    is found that with approximately similar temperature, humidity, and pH as in hydroponics,
    an EC of 3.7 ± 0.7, and a rainfall of 750 ± 150 mm, with NPK ration of 2:1:1,
    in July to August, onions were seen to sprout in around 15 days of sowing and
    the bulbs were seen to form in 70 ± 5 days with a maximum shoot length of 16 cm
    and a maximum root length of 7 cm. The biomass and dry yield as obtained from
    the ‘AquaCrop’ simulator results in soil cultivation systems were found to be
    2.125 and 1.167 respectively. In a nutshell, it can be said that the DWC hydroponic
    method of cultivation outperforms the soil cultivation method of onion cultivation
    in various qualitative and quantitative parameters, without using soil or depending
    upon natural resources for its yield. The simulation results also complied with
    the actual cultivation results, thus, verifying and validating the actual and
    experimental results. It is evident from the research done, that the hydroponic
    cultivation method ensures year-round enhanced and sustainable agricultural yield,
    irrespective and independent of natural resources and climatic uncertainties.
    The hydroponic cultivation method eliminates other causes of damage in substrate
    cultivation, i.e., weeds, pests, and rodents. Thus, the production of shoot and
    bulb of the medicinal plant, onion, can be enhanced with the use of the DWC hydroponics
    method. The scope of this experiment is limited to the comparison of root and
    shoot growth responses of only one species of onion. Other varieties of onion
    could be considered for their growth response analyses, and more distinct results
    could have been obtained for various species of onions. SECTION IV. Conclusion
    The DWC hydroponics is proven to be the best choice for the cultivation of onion
    in terms of qualitative, quantitative, and year–round yield. The total vegetation
    period of onion in a soil medium takes almost 2 ± 2 times more time to produce
    new bulbs than it takes in a water medium. The smart DWC cultivation implements
    CEA and produces almost 2 times more yield, irrespective of the growing season
    and the prevalent environmental conditions. Onion root as well as soot shows significant
    enhancement in growth responses in DWC setup of hydroponics as compared to cultivation
    in soil medium. This result was obtained by practically cultivating onion bulbs
    in the soil as well as in a smart DWC hydroponics setup and then verifying and
    validating the results with the results obtained from the ‘AquaCrop’ simulator.
    The previous works done in this regard have focused on the prediction of onion
    bulbs in hydroponics [64]. The authors of this research work have considered the
    onion as a medicinal plant whose shoot as well as the bulb contains medicinal
    properties, thus the growth responses of the shoot as well as the bulb of the
    onion were monitored and enhanced with the use of DWC hydroponics, which makes
    the work novel. The previous works also have focused on either the actual growth
    results or only simulation outputs, but the authors of this research work have
    carried out actual cultivation and then verified and validated the results with
    the results obtained from the simulator [65], [66]. All these features add to
    the novelty of this research work. A comparative analysis of this research is
    done with the research of other authors under various domains. A major lack in
    the existing research is the lack of cultivation and enhancement of medicinal
    plants [27], [28], [29], [30], [31], [32], [35], [36]. The authors have focused
    on onion as the subject plant where its shoots, as well as roots, have abundant
    medicinal properties. Some of the existing research works like in [24], [35],
    [36], and [37] have focused on the root growth of plants, others like [25], [28],
    [38], [39], and [40] have demonstrated and analyzed the shoot growth responses
    of various plants, but the focus of this research is to analyze and enhance both
    the shoot and root in qualitative and quantitative aspects. Also, in many researches
    like [24], [28], [30], [31], [32], [33], [34], [35], and [36], the cultivation
    is carried out in either soil or soilless medium. The growth analysis of medicinal
    plants in both mediums was an aspect lacking for research which is carried out
    in this experiment. Another dimension of the novelty of this research work can
    be mentioned by the fact that actual experimental results are verified and validated
    using simulator results. In previous works like in [27], [28], [30], [31], [32],
    [35], [36], and [42], the growth responses of plants are analyzed only in actual
    cultivation methods, and in experiments in [26], [41], and [42], the analysis
    was done using a simulator. Therefore, after comparisons with the previous works
    done by many researchers, it can be said that this experiment is a novel work
    done by comparing the shoot and root growth responses of the medicinal plant,
    onion, under various qualitative and quantitative aspects. The two cultivation
    mediums used for the analysis are soil and water, particularly in DWC hydroponics.
    The results of which were verified and validated by comparing the actual results
    with the simulator results. SECTION V. Future Outlook The scope of this research
    can be further expanded by comparing the growth responses and the resource utilization
    while comparing with the other forms of vertical farming methods, i.e., aeroponics
    and aquaponics. Various other species of onions may also be considered to carry
    out their growth response analyses to obtain more specific results dedicated to
    each type of onion. Though the water consumption in DWC hydroponics is much less
    than that needed in soil cultivation, the nutrient solution needs to be drained
    and replaced at regular intervals. Lack of cultivatable land and water conservation
    are the major concerns in the urbanized localities. Thus, wastewater treatment
    plants can act as a further measure of water conservation by making wastewater
    reusable. Conflicts of Interest The authors declare no conflict of interest. ACKNOWLEDGMENT

  data_sources: 3D point cloud data captured from dairy cows
  description: This paper introduces an approach to the automated measurement and
    analysis of dairy cows using 3D point cloud technology. The integration of advanced
    sensing techniques enables the collection of non-intrusive, precise data, facilitating
    comprehensive monitoring of key parameters related to the health, well-being,
    and productivity of dairy cows. The proposed system employs 3D imaging sensors
    to capture detailed information about various parts of dairy cows, generating
    accurate, high-resolution point clouds. A robust automated algorithm has been
    developed to process these point clouds and extract relevant metrics such as dairy
    cow stature height, rump width, rump angle, and front teat length. Based on the
    measured data combined with expert assessments of dairy cows, the quality indices
    of dairy cows are automatically evaluated and extracted. By leveraging this technology,
    dairy farmers can gain real-time insights into the health status of individual
    cows and the overall herd. Additionally, the automated analysis facilitates efficient
    management practices and optimizes feeding strategies and resource allocation.
    The results of field trials and validation studies demonstrate the effectiveness
    and reliability of the automated 3D point cloud approach in dairy farm environments.
    The errors between manually measured values of dairy cow height, rump angle, and
    front teat length, and those calculated by the auto-measurement algorithm were
    within 0.7 cm, with no observed exceedance of errors in comparison to manual measurements.
    This research contributes to the burgeoning field of precision livestock farming,
    offering a technological solution that not only enhances productivity but also
    aligns with contemporary standards for sustainable and ethical animal husbandry
    practices.

    aligns with contemporary standards for sustainable and ethical animal husbandry
    practices. Keywords: dairy cow; point cloud registration; automatic measurement
    and analysis; machine learning; deep learning 1. Introduction Modern agriculture
    is experiencing a transformative evolution, with advancements in sensor technologies
    playing a pivotal role in reshaping traditional farming practices. In the domain
    of livestock management, particularly in dairy farming, the integration of cutting-edge
    technologies offers unprecedented opportunities for optimizing productivity, ensuring
    animal welfare, and promoting sustainable practices. This paper introduces a pioneering
    approach to the automated measurement and analysis of dairy cows, leveraging the
    capabilities of 3D point cloud technology. The convergence of precision livestock
    farming and sensor-based methodologies promises a paradigm shift in how farmers
    monitor and manage their dairy herds. Dairy farming, a cornerstone of the global
    agricultural landscape, confronts multifaceted challenges spanning productivity
    and resource optimization to animal health and welfare. Traditional methods of
    monitoring cows often rely on manual measurements and subjective observations,
    which can be time-consuming, labor-intensive, and prone to human error. In response
    to these challenges, the proposed system harnesses the power of 3D point cloud
    technology, offering a non-intrusive, accurate, and automated means of capturing
    detailed anatomical information. The utilization of 3D imaging sensors enables
    the generation of high-resolution point clouds that provide a comprehensive representation
    of the physical characteristics of dairy cows. These point clouds serve as a rich
    source of data for the development of sophisticated algorithms aimed at extracting
    valuable metrics related to body dimensions, posture, and health indicators. By
    automating the measurement and analysis processes, the proposed system not only
    alleviates the burden on farmers but also opens new avenues for in-depth and continuous
    monitoring, enabling timely interventions and preventive measures. The significance
    of this research extends beyond the realm of traditional livestock management.
    As the agricultural landscape embraces smart farming practices, the integration
    of cloud-based platforms for data storage and analysis becomes imperative. The
    scalability and accessibility afforded by cloud technologies empower farmers to
    remotely access real-time insights into the health and well-being of their dairy
    herds. This paper unfolds the conceptual framework, methodology, and potential
    implications of the automated 3D point cloud approach, representing a promising
    stride toward a technologically enriched and ethically sound future for dairy
    farming, detailed as shown in Figure 1. Figure 1. The automated measurement and
    analysis of dairy cows framework. Particularly, the contribution of this paper
    can be summarized as follows: The multi-camera synchronization system helps minimize
    outliers and increase the accuracy of dairy cow 3D reconstruction, thereby avoiding
    factors that seriously affect the accuracy of dairy cow body size measurement.
    Enhancements to the previous 3D reconstruction system result in more precise stitching
    between the bottom and top cameras based on the camera system’s initialization
    matrix. Automatic measurement and analysis of various parts of dairy cows are
    conducted with high accuracy. The remainder of this paper is organized as follows:
    Section 2 reviews the automated measurement and analysis processes algorithm and
    their applications in dairy farming tasks. In Section 3, a reconstruction framework
    for improving the dairy cow 3D point cloud quality is presented. In Section 4,
    the automated measurement and analysis of dairy cows via a 3D point cloud approach
    is proposed. Section 5 presents the experimental results and the evaluations of
    the proposed approach in the multiple datasets. Section 6 concludes this paper.
    2. Related Works The use of 3D imaging technology has found applications in diverse
    fields, including agriculture. Researchers have investigated its potential in
    crop monitoring, yield prediction, and now in livestock management. The ability
    of 3D imaging to provide detailed spatial information makes it a promising tool
    for capturing and analyzing the three-dimensional structure of dairy cows, presenting
    opportunities for accurate measurement and assessment. Automated systems for monitoring
    livestock have evolved significantly, moving beyond traditional manual methods.
    Computer vision and machine learning techniques have been employed to automate
    the recognition of animal behaviors and health conditions. These studies often
    utilize 2D imaging systems, and the incorporation of 3D point cloud technology
    represents a novel extension to enhance the granularity and accuracy of data collection.
    In accordance with [1], the authors implemented a method for automatically extracting
    measurements to estimate the weight of Nellore cattle based on regression algorithms
    using 2D images of the dorsal area. Additionally, the use of depth images along
    with an algorithm for automatically estimating heifer height and body mass for
    cattle, as presented in [2], has demonstrated that in single-view measurement
    methods utilizing a single RGB camera or depth camera for body condition and body
    size characteristics evaluation, challenges persist in obtaining multi-scale information,
    such as chest girth, abdominal circumference, rump angle, and so on. Similar approaches
    for single-view based measurement problems have also been discussed in [3,4,5,6,7].
    For the task of dairy cow 3D reconstruction, the farm environment and the movement
    of dairy cows significantly impact the resulting point cloud generated using multi-view
    methods, leading to the appearance of outliers and distortion in the dairy cow
    3D point cloud. Consequently, the evaluation of body size introduces considerable
    errors [8]. By constructing a synchronized multi-camera system [9] during the
    point cloud generation process, our current approach has successfully minimized
    the occurrence of outliers, and the visualization of the dairy cow point cloud
    has been significantly improved. On the other hand, the measurement of dairy cows
    is divided into two levels: manual and automatic measurement. The manual measurement
    method requires identifying measurement points on images and point clouds. Subsequently,
    the body-side parameters are calculated by determining the distance between the
    marked points. Automated measurement is achieved through the manual or automatic
    filtering of input images or point clouds [10,11], which is followed by the automated
    measurement of animal body size. 3. The Dairy Cows 3D Reconstruction Currently,
    to successfully reconstruct a dairy cow, it is crucial to ensure the proper conditions
    on the farm, an effective data collection system, and the state of the dairy cow
    at the time of implementation. The excessive movement of dairy cows during the
    data collection process for 3D reconstruction is a significant concern due to
    the adverse effects it introduces. Specifically, the RGBD-SLAM algorithm for the
    dairy cow 3D reconstruction problem may encounter issues such as lost tracking
    during the point cloud registration process between fragments, leading to distorted
    3D results and the emergence of numerous outliers. To ensure the accuracy of the
    dairy cow 3D reconstruction system, an evaluation was conducted on a non-moving
    dairy cow model, as shown in Figure 2. Figure 2. Dairy cow 3D reconstruction evaluation:
    (a) 3D dairy cow point cloud. (b) Dummy dairy cow. The error between the results
    measured manually on a dummy dairy cow and the results measured on a 3D reconstruction
    file is 𝐸=2.1 cm. According to the depth quality specifications provided by the
    Intel Realsense datasheet, 𝑅𝑀𝑆𝐸𝑟𝑟𝑜𝑟≤ 4 cm for the objects is within 2 m and 80%
    ROI. For body length or other dimensions of the cow that are within approximately
    1 m from the camera, the error is only around 1 cm. Therefore, our 3D reconstruction
    algorithm can create highly accurate 3D dairy cow objects used for auto-measurement
    problems. 3.1. The Camera Synchronization System In the context of reconstructing
    a 3D object, achieving precise 3D geometric information poses a challenge when
    relying on a solitary camera. To enhance the capture of detailed geometric features
    in a 3D object, it becomes necessary to augment the number of cameras involved
    in the process. Nevertheless, the synchronization of these cameras is crucial
    for the simultaneous capture of frames. Incorrect synchronization among cameras
    can lead to the generation of numerous artifacts in the reconstructed 3D object.
    As presented in [9], the author has provided a comparison of the quality of 3D
    reconstructions created based on two different approaches to show the importance
    of camera synchronization. Our multi-camera synchronization system can synchronize
    10 cameras together through one host (Jetson Orin). In the current work, only
    2 out of 10 pairs of Jetson Nano and Intel RealSense cameras are used to collect
    RGB-D data for the dairy cow 3D reconstruction problem. This system has been developed
    with the purpose of aligning the frames acquired between two cameras placed in
    the top and bottom positions. All frames were captured by cameras with corresponding
    timestamps, as shown in Figure 3. However, synchronously capturing frames via
    an external trigger signal proves challenging to ensure synchronization when storing
    frames from the RealSense camera to the host. Therefore, synchronizing the global
    timestamps among host computers with each other based on the Network Time Protocol
    (NTP) [12,13] has been applied to achieve the simultaneous computation of frames.
    Consequently, we can retrieve simultaneously captured frames by gathering each
    frame from all cameras that share the same global timestamps. Figure 3. Genlock
    synchronization system. 3.2. Dairy Cow 3D Reconstruction Improvement As presented
    in [14], dairy cow 3D reconstruction is generated based on the RGB-D dataset applying
    an AI algorithm for creating depth images. Initially, k-frame segments were derived
    from pre-existing short RGB-D sequences. Within each subsequence, the RGB-D odometry
    algorithm [15] was applied to ascertain the camera trajectory and merge image
    ranges. Specifically, the identity matrix served as the initialization for adjacent
    RGB-D frames. In contrast, for non-adjacent RGB-D frames, ORB feature computation
    facilitated sparse feature matching across wide baseline images [16], followed
    by a 5-point RANSAC [17] process for a preliminary alignment estimation, which
    was utilized as the initialization for RGB-D odometry computation. To determine
    the appropriate k value, considering the number of input frames, k = 100 was consistently
    set for all experiments with the current dataset. Utilizing the initial 100 frames,
    fragments were generated, providing a description of a segment of the dairy cow
    surface mesh. Once the fragments of the scene are generated, the next step involves
    aligning them in a global space. Global registration refers to an algorithm that
    operates without the need for an initialization alignment. Typically, it computes
    and offers a less rigid alignment, serving as the initialization for local methods
    such as the ICP (Iterative Closest Point). In the current work, we used FGR [18]
    to initialize alignment. However, the rate of creating full 3D dairy cow reconstruction
    is quite low after some experiments. As shown in Figure 4, it is not possible
    to stitch the point cloud created from the top camera (containing information
    mainly about the back of the dairy cow) with the point cloud created from the
    bottom camera (containing information mainly about the lower body of the dairy
    cow). Two parameters, Fitness and Inlier RMSE, are calculated to evaluate our
    algorithm, as shown specifically in Table 1. On the dataset of some dairy cows,
    we applied the algorithm for 3D point cloud registration and evaluated it. The
    Fitness value after updating the algorithm increased from 0.1 to 0.5, and the
    Inlier RMSE value also decreased from 0.02 to 0.01. Figure 4. Dairy cow 3D reconstruction
    improvement: (a) Merged 3D dairy cow point cloud based on old algorithm. (b) Merged
    3D dairy cow point cloud based on a new algorithm. Table 1. Dairy cow 3D reconstruction
    evaluations. Therefore, an initialization matrix T has been created based on the
    physical parameters of the camera’s position in the dairy cow data collection
    system, as shown in Figure 5. Equation (1) presents the specific values of the
    T matrix. By combining the FGR algorithm with these values, the point clouds generated
    from the top camera are rotated and translated closer to the nearest point cloud
    generated from the bottom camera. Figure 5. Dairy cow stereo dataset recording

    Extraction and Normalization The 3D point clouds of dairy cows generated by the
    3D reconstruction algorithms in [14] contain information from the input image
    scene. To expedite point cloud processing and mitigate the impact of the substantial
    volume of point cloud data on computer resources, the Voxel Grid approach was
    employed for downsampling the point clouds [19]. The original point cloud data
    include points from the target dairy cow, the fence, the ground, and outliers.
    To minimize the influence of unnecessary point clouds, the dairy cow clouds were
    trimmed at the plane of the fence and the ground. As depicted in Figure 6, the
    raw 3D reconstruction data encompass two main planes: the ground and the fence.
    The RANSAC algorithm was utilized to facilitate the detection of these two planes.
    This algorithm randomly selects three points within the point cloud, estimates
    the corresponding plane equation Equation (2), and utilizes the distance d to
    identify points belonging to the plane. Through multiple iterations, the plane
    with the greatest number of points was extracted. 𝑎𝑥+𝑏𝑦+𝑐𝑧+𝑑=0 𝑛 𝑇 𝑥=−𝑑 (2) where,

    and Analysis of Dairy Cows via 3D Point Cloud 4.1. Dairy Cow Body Automated Measurement
    Considering the fragmented 3D shape of an animal, which is depicted as an amalgamation
    of point clouds acquired from a set of two depth cameras { 𝑃 1 , 𝑃 2 } , the point
    clouds are concatenated into a unified single point cloud such as 𝑃= ⋃ 2 𝑐=1 𝑃
    𝑐 , where 𝑃={ 𝑝 1 ,…, 𝑝 𝑛 } and 𝑝 𝑖 ∈ ℝ 3 . Our objective is to determine the
    m ordered key points 𝑁={ 𝑛 1 ,…, 𝑛 𝑚 } , where 𝑛 𝑗 ∈𝑃 . The key points are systematically
    annotated in a consistent order, such as right rear leg, right front leg, hip,
    …, giving them a well-defined semantic significance. The coordinate system is
    defined by the x, y, and z axes, respectively, which are displayed as red, green,
    and blue arrows, as shown in Figure 6. As described in [20], the key points extraction
    was proposed as a regression problem. Specifically, the distance between each
    point in the point cloud and each annotated point was computed, yielding m distance
    vectors, each with a size of n. Utilizing these distances, the key points can
    be determined by identifying the point with the minimum value in each distance
    vector. From a machine learning perspective, the problem is formulated as a mapping
    between the 𝑛×3 input matrix 𝐏 and the 𝑛×𝑚 output matrix 𝐃 ̂ . This naturally
    lends itself to an encoder–decoder architecture, where features for each point
    are aimed to be predicted from the input. Point cloud encoder–decoder architectures
    are typically designed to address semantic segmentation problems, where the probability
    of each point belonging to a specific class is predicted by the neural network.
    The transformation of an encoder–decoder into a segmentation problem is achieved
    by converting the network’s prediction into a probability, typically through the
    use of a sigmoid function, and by having the expected class probability backpropagated
    through the loss function. In this research, we contend that an encoder–decoder
    architecture can be employed interchangeably provided that it possesses the capacity
    to learn from point clouds [21]. The task of detecting specific points on a cow’s
    body is formulated as a 3D key point detection problem using point cloud data.
    To tackle this challenge, we leverage PointNet [22], a specialized 3D Deep Neural
    Network (DNN) designed for comprehensive 3D data analysis, offering the unique
    capability to learn both global and local features. In Figure 7, the architecture
    of PointNet is structured as follows: it incorporates an Input Transform Network
    (T-Net) succeeded by a sequence of Multi-Layer Perceptrons (MLPs) dedicated to
    local feature extraction. The Input Transform Network adeptly captures transformations,
    ensuring the network’s resilience to variations in input point permutations, rotations,
    and translations. Following this, a Feature Transform Network (T-Net) is employed
    to augment the network’s ability to handle diverse point orderings. Upon local
    feature extraction, a global feature vector is derived through max pooling, facilitating
    the aggregation of information from the entire point cloud. This global feature
    vector undergoes further processing by a set of MLPs, culminating in the production
    of the final segmentation mask. This mask assigns class labels to each individual
    point, effectively completing the task. The synergistic interplay between the
    Input and feature Transform Networks empowers PointNet to robustly extract features
    from point cloud data, making it a potent solution for the nuanced task of detecting
    specific points on a cow’s body. Figure 7. PointNet architecture for 3D dairy
    cow segmentation. In this work, the model PointNet is implemented by Pytorch,
    which is a popular Deep Learning framework. Details of the training environment
    are as in Table 2. Table 2. Details of the training environment. As present in
    Table 3, dairy cow body part measurement values refer to quantified data associated
    with various physical characteristics and dimensions of dairy cows. These measurements
    play a crucial role in assessing the health, well-being, and productivity of the
    animals in a dairy farming context. Table 3. Dairy cow body part measurement value.
    The following are explanations for some of these key measurement values: Stature
    Value: Stature value refers to the measurement of a dairy cow’s height, which
    is usually from the ground to a specific point on its body. This measurement is
    vital in determining the cow’s overall size and can be used to monitor growth,
    nutritional status, and assess the animal’s ability to access feed and water resources.
    Rump Angle Value: Rump angle value measures the angle of a cow’s rump, specifically
    the slope from its lower back to the tailhead. The rump angle can provide insights
    into the cow’s body condition and reproductive health. Changes in rump angle can
    indicate shifts in body fat and muscle distribution. Rump Width Value: Rump width
    value quantifies the width of the cow’s rump, which is the area just before the
    tailhead. This measurement can help assess the cow’s body condition, particularly
    the development of the pelvic area, which is essential for calving. Front Teat
    Length: The front teat length is the measurement of the length of the teats on
    the front udder of a dairy cow. This measurement is essential in assessing udder
    health and milkability. It can also be an indicator of the cow’s ability to nurse
    its calf or be milked efficiently. These measurement values are collected through
    various methods, including manual measurements and automated systems that employ
    advanced technologies such as 3D point cloud imaging. Accurate and consistent
    measurements are essential for monitoring the health and performance of dairy
    cows, enabling farmers to make informed decisions about their care, nutrition,
    and overall management. 4.2. Stature Height The stature height of a dairy cow
    is the vertical distance from the highest point on the back of a dairy cow to
    the ground. As illustrated in Figure 8, the 3D point cloud of the dairy cow after
    being separated from the ground plane is utilized for the computation of stature
    height. By applying depth learning techniques to identify key point clouds, the
    stature height can be calculated through point-to-plane distance measurements,
    𝑀 𝑆𝑡𝑎𝑡𝑢𝑟𝑒𝐻𝑒𝑖𝑔ℎ𝑡 . 𝑀 𝑆𝑡𝑎𝑡𝑢𝑟𝑒𝐻𝑒𝑖𝑔ℎ𝑡 =𝑑(𝑃,𝐺𝑟𝑜𝑢𝑛𝑑𝑃𝑙𝑎𝑛𝑒) (3) Figure 8. Measurement
    of stature height. 4.3. Rump Angle The rump angle of the dairy cow is the inclination
    from the yaw angle to the sit bone. In Figure 9, it is shown that starting from
    the original dairy cow 3D point cloud, the outliers are removed to reduce computational
    costs and enhance the accuracy of key point detection based on AI. Figure 9. Measurement
    of rump angle. Once the two key point clouds ( 𝐴 1 and 𝐴 2 ) used to compute the
    rump angle are identified, the measurement is evaluated by comparing the distance
    between two points to the ground plane ( ℎ 1 and ℎ 2 ) and providing a score.
    From the detected points 𝐴 1 and 𝐴 2 , we can compute the distances from these
    points to the ground plane, 𝑀 𝑅𝑢𝑚𝑝𝐴𝑛𝑔𝑙𝑒 𝑀 𝑅𝑢𝑚𝑝𝐴𝑛𝑔𝑙𝑒 = ℎ 1 − ℎ 2 (4) 4.4. Rump
    Width The rump width of a dairy cow is the inner width of the ischium and the
    width of the cone, 𝑀 𝑅𝑢𝑚𝑝𝑊𝑖𝑑𝑡ℎ . Figure 10 shows how to determine two points 𝐶
    1 , 𝐶 2 based on the AI algorithm for calculating rump width 𝑀 𝑅𝑢𝑚𝑝𝑊𝑖𝑑𝑡ℎ =𝑑( 𝐶
    1 , 𝐶 2 ) (5) Figure 10. Measurement of rump width: (a) Input. (b) Detect points

    11b), this dataset is used to label for training and testing. Specifically, label
    2 points at the top and the bottom of each teat (Figure 11c). With the automatic
    teat detection results after the training process (Figure 11d), the front teat
    length 𝑀 𝐹𝑟𝑜𝑛𝑡𝑇𝑒𝑎𝑡𝐿𝑒𝑛𝑔ℎ𝑡 is determined according to Equation (6) 𝑀 𝐹𝑟𝑜𝑛𝑡𝑇𝑒𝑎𝑡𝐿𝑒𝑛𝑔ℎ𝑡

    5. Experimental Results 5.1. The Camera Synchronization System To assess the synchronization
    between the two cameras in the dairy cow 3D reconstruction system, we constructed
    a system comprising ten cameras connected to 10 Jetson Nano single computers,
    and all the data collected were sent to a host computer, Jetson Orin. The device
    specifications are detailed in Table 4. The synchronization was demonstrated through
    the frames obtained from the 10 cameras, which displayed the same timestamp on
    the screen when they had the same index. The synchronization results is shown
    in Figure 12. Figure 12. The synchronization results. Table 4. The specification
    of hardware device. 5.2. Dairy Cow Body Automated Measurement The key to calculating
    the body size data for cows, including withers height, body length, chest width,
    and chest girth, lies in the measurement points on the cow’s body. The automated
    cow body measurement algorithm was applied to the cow’s point clouds after coordinate
    normalization and refinement. The definitions for manual and automatic measurement
    values for each body size were as follows. 5.2.1. Stature Height As shown in Figure
    13, by adding the calculated value and score measurement directly to the input
    3D point cloud dataset ( 𝑠𝑡𝑎𝑡𝑢𝑟𝑒ℎ𝑒𝑖𝑔ℎ𝑡 = 142.0 cms and 𝑠𝑐𝑜𝑟𝑒𝑚𝑒𝑎𝑠𝑢𝑟𝑒𝑚𝑒𝑛𝑡 = 6),
    the evaluating and monitoring of the condition of dairy cows becomes simpler and
    more intuitive for evaluators via any point cloud file (.ply) display application.
    Table 5 displays the outcomes of the non-contact measurement system’s repeatability.
    Figure 13. Auto-detection and measurement of stature height. Table 5. Stature
    measurement auto-detection error. The result was computed on 347 samples. Unit:
    cm. The mean absolute error of 0.7 cm in height measurement indicates a relatively
    high level of precision in capturing the vertical dimension of dairy cows. This
    accuracy is crucial in assessing the growth, health, and overall stature of the
    animals. It can aid in determining the appropriate feeding and care for each cow
    within the herd. 5.2.2. Rump Angle Figure 14a shows that four points 𝐴 1 , 𝐴 2
    , and 𝐵 1 , 𝐵 2 are automatically determined through the AI algorithm for the
    rump angle measurement problem. They are then calculated and given a score measurement
    to display on the rump part point cloud (the green point cloud area), 𝑟𝑢𝑚𝑎𝑛𝑔𝑙𝑒=6.06
    and 𝑠𝑐𝑜𝑟𝑒𝑚𝑒𝑎𝑠𝑢𝑟𝑒𝑚𝑒𝑛𝑡=6 . Figure 14. Auto-detection and measurement of rump part:
    (a) Rump angle. (b) Rump width. The measurement of rump-angle auto-detection error
    on 101 samples is computed in Table 6. The 0.61 cm mean absolute error in rump
    angle measurement reflects the depth cameras’ competence in quantifying the inclination
    or tilt of the cow’s rump. This metric is valuable in assessing the cow’s comfort
    and posture, which are particularly relevant for dairy cattle’s well-being and
    milking efficiency. Table 6. Rump-angle measurement auto-detection error. The
    result was computed on 101 samples. Unit: cm. 5.2.3. Rump Width Similar to the
    rump angle, the rump width is calculated through two automatically determined
    points 𝐶 1 , 𝐶 2 , as shown in Figure 14b. The calculated rump width value and
    score measurement are added directly to the 3D point cloud input. Specifically,
    𝑟𝑢𝑚𝑝𝑤𝑖𝑑𝑡ℎ = 11.7 cm corresponds to 𝑠𝑐𝑜𝑟𝑒𝑚𝑒𝑎𝑠𝑢𝑟𝑒𝑚𝑒𝑛𝑡=5 . The auto-detection error
    of rump-width measurement on 101 samples is computed and shown in Table 7. With
    a mean absolute error of 2.5 cm, the depth cameras demonstrate their capability
    to accurately capture the width of the cow’s rump. This measurement is significant
    in evaluating the body condition and reproductive health of the animals. The precision
    achieved here contributes to the effective management of dairy herds. Table 7.
    Rump-width measurement auto-detection error. The result was computed on 101 samples.
    Unit: cm. 5.2.4. Front Teat Length After the dairy cow teat is automatically detected,
    the teat length value is calculated and given a score measurement as shown in
    Figure 15, 𝑡𝑒𝑎𝑡𝑙𝑒𝑓𝑡𝑙𝑒𝑛𝑔𝑡ℎ=4.06 , 𝑡𝑒𝑎𝑡𝑟𝑖𝑔ℎ𝑡𝑙𝑒𝑛𝑔𝑡ℎ=4.26 , 𝑎𝑣𝑒𝑟𝑎𝑔𝑒𝑡𝑒𝑎𝑡𝑙𝑒𝑛𝑔𝑡ℎ=4.16
    and 𝑠𝑐𝑜𝑟𝑒𝑚𝑒𝑎𝑠𝑢𝑟𝑒𝑚𝑒𝑛𝑡=3 . Besides, the result was computed on 71 samples as shown
    in Table 8. Figure 15. Auto-detection and measurement of front teat length. Table
    8. Front teat length measurement auto-detection error. The result was computed
    on 71 samples. Unit: cm. The front teat length measurement, with a mean absolute
    error of 0.79 cm, is important for the assessment of milking efficiency and udder
    health. This level of accuracy enables dairy farmers to make informed decisions
    about milking routines and cow comfort. The error between the manually measured
    values of dairy cow height, rump angle, front teat length and values calculated
    by the auto-measurement algorithm were within 0.7 cm. The errors observed did
    not surpass those generated by manual measurements. In the verification, the rump
    width has shown a large error compared to other body parameters, which is possibly
    due to the structure of the rump width calculation area being quite complicated
    and the two points to be detected being too close together, leading to confusion
    in determining the point to measure based on AI. Table 9 presents an analysis
    of research conducted for non-contact body measurement applications. Specifically,
    the measurement method, type of devices used to collect processing objects, and
    type of data processing objects (2D images, depth images, and point cloud) are
    important criteria that affect the results the 3D point cloud produces as well
    as the accuracy in automated measurement and analysis of animals via a 3D point
    cloud. This table also presents some measuring objects on animals such as horses,
    cows, pigs, and dairy cattle along with the performance of different measurement
    methods. Table 9. An analysis of research conducted for non-contact body measurement
    applications. Precision requirements in dairy farming statistics can vary based
    on the specific applications and objectives. Precision is crucial in ensuring
    the accuracy and reliability of data collected for various aspects of dairy farming.
    In our work, accurate measurements of cow height (stature) are crucial for monitoring
    health and productivity. The mean absolute error (MAE) of 0.7 cm is acceptable
    in many scenarios—especially if the primary goal is to identify significant changes
    rather than precise measurements. Precision in rump-angle measurement is critical
    for assessing cow body condition and comfort. Based on our current approach, the
    MAE of 0.61 cm is relatively low and should be considered satisfactory for most
    practical purposes in dairy farming. The rump width is a significant factor in
    determining the optimal space required for a cow to move comfortably. The MAE
    of 2.5 cm may be acceptable in certain applications, depending on the specific
    needs of the dairy farm. However, if precision is crucial for a particular task,
    further improvements may be considered. Especially, front teat length is an important
    parameter for milking efficiency and udder health. The MAE of 0.79 cm is generally
    acceptable for routine monitoring in dairy farming. Finally, this research has
    contributed to practical significance in the field of automated measurement and
    analysis of animals via 3D point clouds. The low mean absolute errors in these
    body measurements highlight the feasibility of using depth cameras for accurate
    and non-invasive data collection in the dairy industry. This technology can significantly
    improve the management and well-being of dairy cows, leading to increased milk
    production, health, and overall farm efficiency. Additionally, the results from
    this study could contribute to precision livestock farming practices, enabling
    farmers to make data-driven decisions for their dairy herds. 6. Conclusions In
    conclusion, this paper has presented a pioneering approach to revolutionize the
    measurement and analysis of dairy cows through the innovative use of 3D point
    cloud technology. The intersection of precision livestock farming and advanced
    sensing techniques has yielded a system that promises to redefine how dairy farmers
    monitor and manage their herds. Through a comprehensive review of related work,
    we have contextualized our contributions within the broader landscape of automated
    livestock monitoring, highlighting the unique advantages offered by 3D imaging
    and point cloud data. Our proposed system leverages 3D imaging sensors to generate
    high-resolution point clouds, capturing intricate details of dairy cow anatomical
    structures. The developed automated algorithms extract crucial metrics related
    to body dimensions, posture, and health indicators, providing farmers with a nuanced
    understanding of individual and herd-wide conditions. By automating these processes,
    our system not only alleviates the burden on farmers but also facilitates continuous,
    real-time monitoring, enabling early detection of health issues and timely interventions.
    Furthermore, the integration of machine learning algorithms enhances the system’s
    capability to identify and classify various behaviors and conditions, contributing
    to a more comprehensive assessment of dairy cows’ well-being. While the presented
    work marks a significant stride forward, we acknowledge that further research
    is needed to refine and expand the capabilities of our system. Additionally, collaboration
    with stakeholders, including farmers, veterinarians, and agricultural technology
    developers, is essential to ensure the practicality and adoption of our proposed
    approach in real-world dairy farming scenarios. In summary, our work contributes
    to the growing body of knowledge in precision livestock farming by introducing
    a methodology for the automated measurement and analysis of dairy cows. The fusion
    of 3D point cloud technology and machine learning algorithms represents a powerful
    synergy that holds promise for the future of dairy farming, where technology aligns
    with ethics and sustainability, fostering a new era of intelligent and humane
    livestock management. Author Contributions Conceptualization, J.G.L. and D.T.N.;

    By employing a network of sensors, data analytics, and automated control systems,
    this study aims to create a smart agricultural framework that monitors, detects,
    and manages onion plant diseases in real-time. The research begins with a thorough
    investigation into the common diseases affecting onion crops and their associated
    environmental factors. Subsequently, a robust IoT infrastructure is designed and
    implemented, comprising sensor nodes for monitoring soil moisture, temperature,
    humidity, and other relevant parameters. These sensor nodes communicate data to
    a central hub, where advanced analytics and machine learning algorithms analyze
    the information to detect early signs of diseases. In response to disease detection,
    the IoT system employs automated control mechanisms, including precision irrigation,
    targeted application of agrochemicals, and the deployment of environmental control
    measures. The study also explores the integration of remote monitoring through
    mobile applications, allowing farmers to receive real-time alerts and make informed
    decisions promptly. Through field trials and data analysis, the effectiveness
    of the IoT-based disease management system is evaluated, considering factors such
    as disease suppression, yield improvement, and resource efficiency. The research
    also addresses economic considerations and the scalability of the proposed IoT
    framework for widespread adoption in onion cultivation. The findings of this study
    contribute to the advancement of precision agriculture and sustainable farming
    practices, demonstrating the potential of IoT in revolutionizing onion plant disease
    management. As the global demand for agricultural productivity increases, integrating
    smart technologies into traditional farming practices becomes paramount, and this
    research provides valuable insights for stakeholders in the agriculture and technology
    sectors.

    Introduction Agriculture is one of the key sources that plays a significant part
    in the life of the country''s economy. Traditional agriculture refers to the conventional
    farming methods that have been practiced for centuries, relying on manual labor
    and basic tools. In traditional agriculture, farmers often work in small plots
    of land using traditional seeds and farming practices passes down through the
    generations while traditional agriculture has played a crucial role in meeting
    food demands, it does have it disadvantages. One significant drawbacks is its
    relatively low efficiency and productivity. Manual labor-intensive tasks can be
    time-consuming and labor demanding, leading to potential wastage of water, fertilizers
    and pesticides. Moreover, traditional agriculture is more susceptible to the adverse
    effects of unpredictable weather conditions and environmental factors which can
    result in lower yields and economic losses. Meanwhile, food security is a global
    challenge and impacted by rapidly compounding effects of climate changes, population
    trends and supply chain shortcomings. Agriculture''s global impact cannot be overstated,
    as it remains the primary source of food for humanity. Despite the fact that the
    human population continues to grow, agricultural land remains static (Virk et
    al.2020). The authors (Mesgaran et al. 2017) also discovered that the ever-changing
    climatic conditions significantly reduce agricultural product output in conventional
    agricultural systems. As a result of the varying nature of farming resources and
    poor management, farmers continue to experience low agricultural output. Drawbacks
    of Traditional Farming Due to the low degree of automation in the farming area,
    the current state of the art in agriculture, particularly conventional agricultural
    systems, still confronts significant hurdles in terms of sustainability, labor-intensity,
    and energy efficiency needs. Also, the production level of the crops to be considered.
    Scalability problems also taken into account since the population explosion is
    the major cause. Precision Agriculture and Smart Farming In order to overcome
    the limitations and challenges faced in the conventional farming systems, the
    advent of the smart farming and precision agricultural sector to automate the
    farming processes towards achieving many goals towards sustainable agricultural
    systems. Some of them are listed below: • High quantity of crop yield • Better
    quality of the crops • Efficient resource utilization • Effective to handle climatic
    conditions • Decision making in cropping patterns • Environment and user-friendly
    • Easy maintenance • Minimized crop losses • Easy to handle pests, diseases, weeds
    • Minimize the crop growth time duration • Early prediction on the crop loss or
    gain • Ensures and motivates organic way of crop cultivation • Improves the growth
    of wide variety of crops • Reduces the usage of pesticides, fungicides and other
    chemicals that are not good for health. • Though huge amount for installations,
    less chances for failures and lasts for longer life-time. Continue Reading References

  description: In aquaculture, controlling water quality parameters is an important
    challenge. The water quality parameters affect the growth of aquatic organisms.
    Thus, maintaining water quality balance has become the primary goal of aquaculture
    operators. However, the traditional water quality inspection method is low in
    accuracy and consumes considerable time and human resources. On the other hand,
    since water quality sensors are immersed in seawater for a long time, algae will
    grow on the sensors, affecting their accuracy. Therefore, to solve the abovementioned

    24 h a day and further use the SRU model for sensor data prediction to assist
    aquaculture farmers in managing and controlling outdoor aquaculture ponds. Moreover,
    a 24-h water quality sampling tank is designed to overcome the problem of sensor
    error. Throughout the whole process, data are transmitted to a water quality monitoring
    cloud platform for further inspection and prediction. In this article, SRU-based
    prediction is used to obtain predictions of water quality parameters, and three
    popular metrics mean absolute error (MAE), root-mean-square error (RMSE), and
    mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) are used to evaluate the performance. As

    is an important challenge. The water quality parameters affect the growth of aquatic
    organisms. Thus, maintaining water quality balance has become the primary goal
    of aquaculture operators. However, the traditional water quality inspection method
    is low in accuracy and consumes considerable time and human resources. On the

    algae will grow on the sensors, affecting their accuracy. Therefore, to solve
    the abovementioned problems, this article reports the design and implementation
    of a full-time artificial intelligence of things (AIoT)-based water quality inspection
    and prediction system, which uses a simple recurrent unit (SRU) model to predict
    water quality data. With the proposed system, it is possible to collect water

    Funding Agency: SECTION I. Introduction With the impacts of the greenhouse effect,
    drastic climate changes have triggered a food shortage crisis. Crops depend on
    a suitable climate to grow, but drastic changes in the climate have affected crop
    yields. Consequently, to meet the large food demand of humans, the aquaculture
    industry has increasingly prospered in recent years because the aquatic products
    of aquaculture, such as fish, shrimp, and shellfish, have high nutritional value.
    Although traditional manual aquaculture technology has matured, it still faces
    challenges. Aquaculture management based on the conventional manual method is
    time consuming and labor intensive. However, with the vigorous development of
    artificial intelligence (AI) technology and Internet of Things (IoT) technology,
    it has become possible to solve the problems of traditional aquaculture using
    intelligent technology; thus, traditional aquaculture has evolved into intelligent
    aquaculture. Nevertheless, although current intelligent aquaculture systems can
    reduce the time cost and human resource demands of aquaculture, they are still
    insufficient to overcome the food shortage crisis. To overcome this challenge,
    there is a need to focus on managing water quality in outdoor aquaculture ponds.
    The growth of aquatic products can be controlled through proper management of
    changes in water conditions. Thus, the nutritional value of aquatic products can
    be improved. Traditional aquatic products with high nutritional value are called
    precision aquaculture products [1], and the production of such refined aquatic
    products can contribute to solving the human food shortage crisis. However, current
    water quality management technology is still dominated by a high demand for human
    resources. The substances present in the water in outdoor aquaculture ponds are
    highly variable, and traditional manual water quality analysis is time consuming
    and labor intensive. On the other hand, since water quality sensors remain immersed
    in seawater for a long time, algae will grow on these sensors, affecting their
    accuracy. Hence, achieving the accurate prediction and analysis of water quality
    is a significant challenge. In response to the challenges mentioned above, this
    article proposes a full-time AI of things (AIoT)-based water quality monitoring
    and prediction system to regularly measure the water quality environment of outdoor
    aquaculture ponds. With the proposed system, it is possible to collect water quality
    sensing data all 24 h in a day and further use a simple recurrent unit (SRU) model
    for sensor data prediction to assist aquaculture farmers in managing and controlling
    the monitored outdoor aquaculture ponds. The proposed system uses four types of
    water quality sensors [temperature, dissolved oxygen (DO), potential of hydrogen
    (pH), and oxidation reduction potential (ORP)] to detect water parameters. In
    addition, we built a web-based water quality monitoring cloud platform to store
    a large amount of water parameter data and used deep learning models to analyze
    and predict the water quality environment. This platform allows users to connect
    through mobile phones or other devices to monitor water quality data. The main
    contributions of this article can be summarized as follows. The proposed system
    enables full-time collection of water quality sensing data from outdoor aquaculture
    ponds. It utilizes an SRU model for predicting sensor data that contribute to
    accurate predictions and assist aquaculture farmers in effectively managing and
    controlling their aquaculture ponds. The proposed system employs four different
    types of water quality sensors, including temperature, DO, pH, and ORP, to detect
    essential water parameters. This multisensor approach enhances the comprehensiveness
    and accuracy of water quality monitoring. This work introduces the creation of
    a web-based water quality monitoring cloud platform. This platform serves as a
    repository for storing large volumes of water parameter data. Deep learning models
    are integrated into the platform to analyze and predict the water quality environment.
    The rest of this article is organized as follows. Section II discusses previous
    works related to intelligent aquaculture. Section III introduces the proposed
    system. Section IV demonstrates the prototype of the proposed system and explains
    the experimental results. Finally, we conclude this work in Section V. SECTION
    II. Previous Works An intelligent aquaculture system realizes automatic control
    through AI and IoT equipment (devices) for water quality monitoring and prediction.
    Recently, such systems have become a popular topic of aquaculture research [3],
    [4], [5], [6], [7], [8], [9], [10], [11]. In addition to its application for water
    quality inspection and prediction, computer vision technology [2] can be used
    to analyze the feeding behavior of underwater fish [12], [13], [14], [15], [16],
    to identify the health status of aquatic organisms [17], [18], to detect vulnerabilities
    in aquaculture net cages [19], and for other purposes to make aquaculture systems
    more intelligent. A. Water Quality Inspection and Prediction Hu et al. [3] used
    a deep learning network based on a long short-term memory (LSTM) model to predict
    pH and water temperature. The data were preprocessed using a linear difference
    method and a smoothing method; the influence of various water quality parameters
    on the pH value and water temperature was analyzed based on the Pearson coefficient
    method; the results of the Pearson coefficient analysis were used as model input;
    and LSTM- and recurrent neural network (RNN)-based learning models of different
    depths were trained and compared. Finally, an LSTM-based water quality prediction
    model was established because the experimental results showed that this model
    was more accurate and took less time than the RNN model. Liu et al. [4] transmitted
    monitoring information on the pH value, water temperature, and DO in a pond to
    a cloud database and used a deep bidirectional stacked SRU (Bi-S-SRU) model to
    improve the data organization in the preprocessing stage. In experimental comparisons
    of the Bi-S-SRU model with RNN and LSTM models, the results showed that the prediction
    accuracy of the Bi-S-SRU model was better than that of most other neural networks.
    However, it needed more computation time than the other neural networks. Liu et
    al. [5] used an SRU model for prediction, used the Pearson correlation coefficient
    method to find the correlations between water quality parameters, and compared
    the predictions of an RNN model with those of the SRU model. Furthermore, Ciou
    [6] found that in comparison with an RNN-based model, their proposed SRU model
    had higher accuracy and stability, and the actual prediction error could be controlled
    within 1%. Overall, the SRU models perform better than the RNN models in terms
    of prediction. Ciou [6] reduced the labor cost and error rate of aquaculture through
    intelligent water quality monitoring. He used a LoRa wireless transmission system
    with a solar energy architecture to reduce construction costs and used a Raspberry
    Pi embedded system as the core to wirelessly transmit the collected data. The
    data were sent to a remote server and could then be displayed on a device through
    a web page, providing a remote real-time monitoring interface for users to observe
    and adjust water quality. In this work, the Raspberry Pi embedded system served
    as the core processor of the monitoring system. The solar energy system was used
    as the power supply system at the sensing end to improve mobility. The LoRa low-power
    long-distance network was used to transmit information. Finally, the water quality
    information could be monitored and adjusted through the web page, resulting in
    a significant change in the operation method, which had needed labor-intensive
    manual inspections in the past. Rasheed Abdul Haq and Harigovindan [7] proposed
    a deep learning method for water quality prediction. The water quality parameters
    considered were salinity, pH, DO, and temperature. In the experiments, the ADAK
    and MAC water quality datasets were used for prediction, and the mean absolute
    error (MAE) method was used for model evaluation. Li et al. [8] proposed an enhanced
    Naive Bayes (NB) model to predict DO as a water quality parameter. The authors
    used the results of ten-fold cross-validation and used the MAE metric for model
    evaluation. Because the data are unstable and nonlinear, predicting DO accurately
    is a major challenge. Cao et al. [9] proposed a method for predicting DO changes
    in aquaculture using k-means clustering, an improved softplus extreme learning
    machine (SELM), and particle swarm optimization (PSO). In addition, the model
    was tolerant of missing data and outliers and provided high accuracy. Chiang et
    al. [10] proposed a chip for salinity detection, which included a salinity sensor
    and a transducer. Experiments showed that the proposed salinity detector could
    detect salinity changes with high sensitivity in water environments with large
    salinity differences. Huan et al. [11] proposed a water quality monitoring system
    for outdoor aquaculture ponds using narrowband IoT (NB-IoT) technology. Monitoring
    water quality is very important for aquaculture production to control the growth
    and health of aquatic products. The proposed system could obtain water quality
    parameters such as temperature, pH, and DO over time. B. Analysis of Underwater
    Fish Feeding Ubina et al. [12] proposed a method using a convolutional neural
    network (CNN) to analyze the accuracy of calculating the 3-D positions of fish
    in an aquaculture net cage. Such 3-D position analysis can reveal the feeding,
    growth, and health status of the fish. Experimental results showed that the error
    rate for porphyry seabream and golden pomfret was less than 5% in a camera range
    from 50 to 200 cm. Pai et al. [13] proposed a method for fish detection and enumeration
    using You Only Look Once version 5 (YOLOv5). Counting the number of fish in an
    aquaculture net cage can be useful for estimating the amount of feed needed. Experimental
    results showed that the precision, recall, and F-measure were 81%. In addition,
    abnormal behavior of fish in the water could be detected. Hu et al. [14] proposed
    a method using a deep neural network (DNN) to identify the wave size caused by
    fish eating bait in outdoor aquaculture ponds to determine fish feeding status.
    The experimental results showed that the proposed model achieved up to 93.2% accuracy.
    C. Recognition of Abnormal Fish Behavior Wang et al. [17] proposed a method of
    detecting abnormal behavior of underwater fish using AI object detection, direct
    cycle graph (DCG), and dynamic time warping (DTW) methods. Checking for abnormal
    fish behavior can be useful for analyzing the causes of fish disease or death
    to plan countermeasures and reduce unnecessary losses, as the death of fish in
    a pond can easily cause contamination of the entire pond with pathogens. Generally,
    the traditional manual inspection method is very time consuming. In contrast,
    such an automated method can be used to quickly analyze the abnormal behavior
    of underwater fish so that aquaculture operators can learn about the causes of
    illness or death. D. Hole Detection in Aquaculture Net Cages Amundsen et al. [19]
    proposed a method that uses remotely operated underwater vehicles (ROVs) and Doppler
    velocity logs (DVLs) to check for holes in aquaculture net cages, which are used
    to prevent farmed fish from affecting wild fish population structures. They replaced
    traditional divers with the ROV method of checking aquaculture net cages to avoid
    the need for divers to perform dangerous tasks underwater. SECTION III. Proposed
    Water Quality Inspection System Fig. 1 shows the system architecture of the proposed
    system. An IoT module (ESP32) is used to connect five devices: a DO sensor with
    a built-in temperature sensor, a pH sensor, an ORP sensor, a water valve, and
    a water pump. Through the Wi-Fi wireless network, the water quality–related sensing
    data are uploaded to the AI server for water quality analysis. Fig. 1. System
    architecture of the proposed water quality inspection system. Show All Water quality
    data analysis is carried out by collecting seawater parameter data; future water
    quality data prediction is carried out through a water quality prediction model;
    and the impact of water quality on aquatic organisms is investigated. Moreover,
    to prevent data errors caused by algae growth on the sensors in seawater, as shown
    in Fig. 2, actual measurements indicate that the water quality sensors need to
    be cleaned every 1–2 weeks. Fig. 2. Example of algae growth on a water quality
    sensor placed in seawater. Show All To solve this problem, a set of 24-h water
    sampling tanks is designed based on water pump and water valve components that
    are electronically controlled through the ESP32 to regularly control the pumping
    and discharging of water to discourage algae growth. Furthermore, users can connect
    to the cloud platform through computers and mobile phones to browse water quality–related
    data in real time. We further explain why the proposed system can solve the above
    problems. Generally, the traditional water quality measurement method cannot measure
    full time (i.e., for 24 h). The main reason is that if the water quality sensor
    is soaked in water for a long time, algae will grow rapidly, causing damage to
    water quality sensors or reducing measurement accuracy. Compared with the proposed
    system, when the water quality needs to be measured, the water is pumped up for
    measurement, and the water is discharged after the measurement is completed. This
    can prevent the water quality sensor from being soaked in water for a long time,
    causing the algae to grow leading to the reduction of water quality sensor’s accuracy.
    A. Introduction to the IoT-Based Control Module, Water Quality Sensors, and Actuators
    Fig. 3 shows the connection structure of the IoT-based control module (ESP32).
    First, a 12-V transformer converts ac 110 V power to dc 12 V power to provide
    power to the water pump and water valve. Then, the dc power is further converted
    from 12 to 5 V through a 5-V converter to supply power to the sensors (DO sensor
    with a built-in temperature sensor, pH sensor, and ORP sensor) and the control
    module. ESP32 is connected to two relays for the on/off functions of the water
    valve and water pump. Fig. 3. Connection structure of the IoT-based control module
    (ESP32). Show All 1) IoT-Based Control Module: The ESP32 is a low-power microcontroller
    that combines Wi-Fi and Bluetooth chips. This IoT control module has digital and
    analog pins for signal processing and uses the C language for programming. ESP32
    uses the Tensilica Xtensa LX6 microprocessor, including dual-core and single-core
    variants, with built-in antenna switches, RF converters, power amplifiers, filters,
    low-noise receiver amplifiers, and power management modules. In this article,
    ESP32 is used for sensor/actuator control, timing, and data uploading. It also
    has multiple pins, which can be used to conveniently control various sets of devices.
    2) Water Quality Sensors: The DO sensor mainly measures the oxygen concentration
    in the water. DO refers to the concentration of oxygen dissolved in water. The
    DO quantity is the leading indicator for judging water quality. Generally, the
    higher the concentration is, the better the water quality. The amount of saturated
    DO in water is affected by the water temperature and other dissolved substances.
    The higher the water temperature is, the lower the saturated DO. In actual field
    operations, the DO concentration in general aquaculture ponds is needed to be
    greater than 4 r/min. The specifications of the adopted DO sensor (with a built-in
    temperature sensor) [20] can be seen in Table I. TABLE I Specifications of the
    Adopted DO Sensor (With a Built-in Temperature Sensor) [20] The term pH stands
    for potential hydrogen and is used to measure the level of acidity or alkalinity
    in any water-soluble substance. The pH scale ranges from 1 to 14 on a logarithmic
    scale, with seven being neutral. Any value below seven indicates acidity, with
    lower numbers indicating higher levels of acidity. Conversely, any value above
    seven indicates alkalinity, with higher numbers indicating a higher level of alkalinity.
    The pH sensor mainly measures the pH value of the water. The pH value is an indicator
    of the activity of hydrogen ions in a solution, that is, a measure of the acidity
    or alkalinity of the solution. In this article, the pH value of an outdoor aquaculture
    pond is collected through a pH sensor as a water quality sensor. Generally, the
    pH value of an aquaculture pond should be kept in the range of 8–8.5. The specifications
    of the adopted pH sensor [21] can be seen in Table II. TABLE II Specifications
    of the Adopted pH Sensor [21] The ORP sensor mainly measures the conductance of
    the water. The ORP, also known as the redox potential, refers to the electrode
    potential when an electroactive substance undergoes an electroreduction reaction.
    The redox potential is expressed in units of millivolts. Each electroactive substance
    has a specific reduction potential. The larger the redox potential value is, the
    stronger the electron-gathering ability of the substance. The redox potential
    can reflect the antibacterial ability of water. In a general aquaculture pond
    environment, the ORP should be in the range of approximately 150–250 mV. The specifications
    of the adopted ORP sensor [22] can be seen in Table III. TABLE III Specifications
    of the Adopted ORP Sensor [22] 3) Actuators: Fig. 4 shows photographs of the adopted
    actuators of the proposed system. Fig. 4(a) shows the photograph of the water
    pump. The water pump provides the pumping action for the proposed water sampling
    tank. The water pump is used to draw seawater into the proposed water sampling
    tank to be measured by the water quality sensors. Fig. 4. Water pumping and drainage
    devices. (a) Water pump. (b) Electric water valve. Show All Fig. 4(b) shows the
    electronically controlled water valve. This valve is used to control the drainage
    of the water tank to prevent the sensors from being soaked in seawater for a long
    time, which would affect their ability to measure the water quality. The specifications
    of the adopted water pumping device [23] can be seen in Table IV. The specifications
    of the adopted electric water valve device can be seen in Table V. TABLE IV Specifications
    of the Adopted Water Pump [23] TABLE V Specifications of the Adopted Electric
    Water Valve Furthermore, we use two relay modules to regulate the water tank’s
    pumping and draining. One controls the water pump, while the other operates the
    electric control valve, managing seawater flow during sampling. B. Hardware Design
    of the 24-H Water Sampling Tank Fig. 5 shows a flowchart of the operation of the
    24-h water quality parameter sampling tank. The water tank is used to perform
    collection and sampling once every 5 min; the water tank has a delay of 20 s when
    the initial power-on is performed to initialize the equipment, and the water pump
    is started after 2 min. Fig. 5. Flowchart of the operation of the water quality
    parameter sampling tank. Show All The pump pumps water for 5 s. After 5 s, the
    pump is turned off. Then, the sampled seawater remained stagnant in the water
    tank for 2 min. Subsequently, the sensors collect water quality data. Then, the
    water valve is opened for 20 s to empty the seawater from the tank. Finally, the
    water valve is closed, and the above cycle continues until the unit is de-energized.
    C. Water Quality Monitoring Cloud Platform IDEASChain [24] is a free open cloud
    platform developed by the Digital Transformation Research Institute (DTRI), Institute
    for Information Industry (III), Taiwan. The IDEASChain cloud platform provides
    many development modules that allow users to quickly import and use IoT data applications,
    thus lowering the barrier to entry for IoT applications combined with cloud services.
    Therefore, in this article, IDEASChain is used as the cloud platform for water
    quality monitoring to store and analyze water quality data and finally present
    the data and analysis results in visual charts, as shown in Fig. 6. Fig. 6. IDEASChain

    and analysis results in visual charts. (b) ORP monitored results. (c) DO monitored
    results. (d) Temperature monitored results. (e) pH monitored results. Show All
    D. Water Quality Prediction Model In this article, an SRU model [25] is used as
    the water quality prediction model. The specifications of the AI training server
    are as follows: an Intel Core i9-9900k CPU, an NVIDIA GeForce RTX 2080 Ti GPU,
    11 GB of GDDR6 graphics memory, 32 GB of DDR4 RAM, and MS Windows 10 version 20H2.
    As shown in Fig. 1, when deep learning starts, data collection will be carried
    out through the cloud platform. After collection, the test data are processed
    by moving averaging and linear interpolation. Then, to train the SRU model, the
    test data are divided into a test set and a training set. All data in the training
    set are first fed into the SRU learning model for prediction, and the model parameters
    are adjusted accordingly to correctly predict the training data. Then, the test
    set is used to adjust the model trained on the training set to perform data cross-comparison,
    and the two sets are both input into the SRU model to be tested together. Finally,
    the model with its adjusted parameters is used to generate prediction results
    for real data. The design concept of the SRU model is to speed up model training
    without losing accuracy. In a traditional RNN model (such as an LSTM network),
    the output from the previous layer is used as the input to the current layer,
    and the transmission of information is controlled through neural gates to solve
    the problems of gradient explosion and vanishing. This concatenation of layers
    will affect the speed of model training. Therefore, the SRU model removes the
    dependence of the current input on the output of the previous layer; instead,
    only the update of the internal state depends on the output of the previous layer.
    Although the state calculation of an SRU is dependent on time, the state dimension
    is independent of time; thus, parallel processing can be performed. Fig. 7 illustrates
    the framework of the SRU model. x t represents the input at time t , f t represents
    the forget gate at time t , r t represents the reset gate at time t , and c t
    and h t represent the state and final output, respectively, at time t . Fig. 7.
    SRU model [25]. Show All We train an SRU model 300 times to perform predictive
    analysis on the 4 types of data collected, each time reading 64 pieces of data
    for training (4 pieces of data ×64 ). Finally, both the original data and the
    predicted data are displayed on a background chart to provide users with a convenient
    browsing experience. When abnormal data are collected, the user is prompted to
    adjust the equipment immediately. E. Data Preprocessing Because the environmental
    state is unpredictable in actual field operations, abnormalities may be present
    in the data received by the sensors, resulting in the occurrence of glitch waves,
    which will reduce the accuracy of model training. Therefore, data preprocessing
    is extremely important. To address this issue, we preprocess the data collected
    by each sensor, including the temperature, pH value, ORP, and DO data, by taking
    the moving average, as shown in (1). Here, x t +i represents the value we want
    to modify at the current moment, and n is the number of data items we want to
    average. We set n to 4, which means that every 4 pieces of data are processed
    to calculate the moving average. Please note that we utilize moving average processing
    for each sensor to maintain consistency in preprocessing and streamline the overall
    process x t+i = 1 n ∑ i=0 n−1 x t−i . (1) View Source In the establishment of
    deep learning models, differences in data units may be encountered, which may
    affect the results of statistical analysis. Standardization of the data can improve
    the convergence speed of a model and improve its accuracy. We convert the original
    data into scalars through a process of average standardization, as shown in (2),
    before comparing and analyzing the data. In (2), x max and x min are the maximum
    and minimum values of the data, respectively, and μ is the average value of the
    data. By normalizing to the average value, the data are scaled to the range of
    [0, 1], and the converted scalar values are then used to train the SRU model.
    x nom = x−u x max − x min ϵ[0,−1]. (2) View Source SECTION IV. System Prototype
    and Experimental Results A. System Prototype As shown in Figs. 8–12, we designed
    a complete set of 24-h water sampling tank equipment to collect data with the
    water quality sensors and used a water pump to pump the seawater from the outdoor
    aquaculture pond into the water tank so that the water quality sensors could read
    the corresponding values. Fig. 8. Internal sensing assembly of the water quality
    sampling tank. Holes were cut into the top of the water quality sampling tank,
    and water quality sensors were placed. (a) ORP sensor. (b) DO sensor with a built-in
    temperature sensor. (c) pH sensor. Show All Fig. 9. Bottom of the water quality
    sampling tank was constructed from styrofoam and plastic hardboard to increase
    the inclination angle of the walls to ensure that the sampled seawater could flow
    smoothly to prevent water accumulation inside the tank to avoid the growth of
    algae. Show All Fig. 10. Water quality inspection system in the indoor experimental

    water quality inspection system mounted next to the actual experimental outdoor
    aquaculture pond. Show All To be more precise, we cut holes into the top of the
    water quality sampling tank and placed the water quality sensors through these
    holes to prevent algae from growing on them, as shown in Fig. 8. As shown in Fig.
    9, the bottom of the water quality sampling tank was constructed from styrofoam
    and plastic hardboard to increase the inclination angle of the walls to ensure
    that the sampled seawater could flow smoothly to prevent water accumulation inside
    the tank to avoid the growth of algae. All joints of the water tank were sealed
    with silicone and hard adhesive to prevent water seepage. The electromagnetic
    water valve was placed at the bottom of the water tank to control water drainage
    so that the water quality sensors would not be soaked in water for a long time
    to avoid the growth of algae. Fig. 10 demonstrates the proposed water quality
    inspection system in the indoor experimental stage. Fig. 10(a) shows the proposed
    24-h water quality sampling tank. Fig. 10(b) is actual hardware connecting IoT
    devices in a waterproof box. Fig. 10(c) is actual outdoor aquaculture pond water
    for real water quality inspection experiments. Fig. 10(d) is a Wi-Fi router for
    IoT module/device communications and control. The measured water quality data
    can be uploaded to a water quality monitoring cloud platform. Fig. 11 demonstrates
    a photograph of actual hardware connecting IoT devices in a waterproof box. The
    IoT module adopts the ESP32 module for sensor/actuator control, timing, and data
    uploading. Two relays are used for controlling water pumping and drainage devices.
    A sensor signal conversion board is used to receive and convert signals from water
    quality sensors to the IoT module for data processing and uploading to the water
    quality monitoring cloud platform. Finally, as shown in Fig. 12(a)–(c), we implemented
    the proposed system in the outdoor white shrimp aquaculture pond of the Department
    of Aquaculture, National Penghu University of Science and Technology (NPU), Penghu,
    Taiwan. The water stop gasket of the electric water valve may become clogged with
    algae and other impurities, as shown in Fig. 13, which would cause the valve to
    be unable to hold the water in the tank. These impurities are drawn into the tank
    together with the sampled water when the water pump is pumping. Since the water
    then drains through the water valve when the tank is drained, excessive impurities
    and algae from the water may become stuck inside the water valve, causing the
    water valve to fail. We found that too many impurities incapacitated the water
    valve. Many algae may grow in an outdoor aquaculture pond, and impurities can
    be easily drawn into the water tank by the water pump. Fig. 13. Clogged water
    valve. Show All Therefore, we improved the method of pumping water into the water
    tank to solve the problem of water valve blockage. Specifically, we added a filter
    screen at the pumping hole of the water pump to block larger impurities, thereby
    reducing the opportunity for impurities to become stuck inside the water valve.
    B. Experimental Results Experimental data were collected from the outdoor aquaculture
    pond using water quality sensors and transmitted to the water quality monitoring
    cloud platform (IDEASChain) through a 4G Wi-Fi wireless network for monitoring
    and storage. Data were collected every 5 min. The water quality data included
    temperature ( T ), pH, DO, and ORP parameters as the experimental data for model
    training. In Fig. 14(a)–(d), all data are presented as real (blue) and predicted
    (orange) data curves. The actual water quality parameters collected in the field
    in this experiment included T, pH, ORP, and DO. For each type of sampling data,
    13000 records were collected, and an SRU model was adopted as the prediction model
    for training. In the experiment, the model’s performance was evaluated in terms
    of MAE, root-mean-square error (RMSE), and mean absolute percentage error (MAPE),
    as shown in the following equations: MAE RMSE MAPE = 1 n ∑ i=1 n ∣ ∣ x i − x P
    i ∣ ∣ = ∑ n i=1 ( x i − x P i ) 2 n − − − − − − − − − − − − − √ = 1 n ∑ i=1 n

    value. Please note that a value closer to 0 means better performance. The experimental
    results were used to compare the performance of the water quality prediction model
    proposed in this article with that of an LSTM model. As seen from Tables VI–VIII,
    the performance of the SRU model is superior to that of the LSTM model. TABLE
    VI Comparison With the LSTM Model Using the MAE Metric TABLE VII Comparison With
    the LSTM Model Using the RMSE Metric TABLE VIII Comparison With the LSTM Model
    Using the MAPE Metric SECTION V. Conclusion In this article, a full-time AIoT-based
    water quality inspection and prediction system for intelligent aquaculture has
    been proposed. IoT technology and deep learning technology are combined to perform
    regular monitoring and analysis of the water quality environment of outdoor aquaculture
    ponds. In addition, we established a water quality monitoring cloud platform based
    on the IDEASChain cloud platform to store water quality data for the prediction
    of water quality curves. From this platform, users can read access web pages to
    browse the collected monitoring data through mobile phones or other devices. The
    various water quality data collected include temperature data, DO data, pH data,
    and ORP data. Finally, we use a water quality prediction model to make predictions
    that can guide timely adjustments to aeration and other actions in response to
    future changes in the monitored outdoor aquaculture pond. Algae tend to grow on
    sensors in seawater, which can reduce their sensitivity and cause them to generate
    incorrect data; therefore, a 24-h sampling tank is used to solve this problem.
    Furthermore, an SRU model is used to generate predictions of the sensor data.
    The experimental evaluation results show that the proposed 24-h sampling tank
    and prediction scheme offer good performance. Therefore, the proposed method is
    useful for intelligent aquaculture. In summary, the main contributions of this
    article can be listed as follows. Introducing an AIoT-based approach that employs
    IoT and deep learning technologies to enable continuous water quality monitoring
    and predictive analysis. The development of a specialized water quality monitoring
    cloud platform based on IDEASChain, which serves as a comprehensive repository
    for data storage and predictive modeling. Incorporating a diverse array of water
    quality metrics, encompassing temperature, DO, pH, and ORP, enhances the scope
    and accuracy of monitoring. Introducing a 24-h sampling tank to counteract sensor
    degradation caused by algae growth, ensuring data reliability. The application
    of the SRU model for accurate prediction of sensor data facilitates well-informed
    decision-making. Empirical evaluation confirming the robust performance of the
    proposed 24-h sampling tank and prediction scheme, establishing its utility for
    intelligent aquaculture management. ACKNOWLEDGMENT The authors would like to thank

    as the foundation of our civilization, because it provides food, fuel, fiber,
    and other resources necessary for survival; however, it is facing critical challenges
    due to anthropogenic climate change, which hampers food and nutritional security.
    Consequently, the agriculture industry must adjust to farming issues, such as
    the shift in global temperatures and environmental degradation, the scarcity of
    farm workers, population growth, and dietary changes. Several measures have been
    implemented to enhance agricultural productivity, including plant breeding, genetic
    engineering, and precision agriculture. In recent years, the world has witnessed
    the burgeoning development of novel scientific innovations and technological advancements
    enabled by drones, smart sensors, robotics, and remote sensing, resulting in a
    plethora of revolutionary methods that can be applied to real-time crop modeling,
    high-throughput phenotyping, weather forecasting, yield prediction, fertilizer
    application, disease detection, market trading, farming practices, and other environmental
    practices vital to crop growth, yield, and quality. Furthermore, the rise in big
    data, advanced analytics, falling technology costs, faster internet connections,
    increased connectivity, and increases in computational power are all part of the
    current digitalization wave that has the potential to support commercial agriculture
    in achieving its goals of smart farming, resilience, productivity, and sustainability.
    These technologies enable efficient monitoring of crops, soil, and environmental
    conditions over large areas, providing farmers with data to support precise management
    that optimizes productivity and minimizes environmental impacts. Though smart
    farming has significant potential, challenges like high implementation costs,
    data security concerns, and inadequate digital literacy among farmers remain.
    In summary, agriculture is rapidly transforming from conventional to digital farming,
    offering global solutions, efficient resource utilization, and minimized input
    costs while fostering farmer livelihoods and economic growth. Delivering a comprehensive
    view of how technology could help in tackling critical issues like environmental
    degradation and threatened world biodiversity, this perspective emphasizes the
    perks of digitalization. Future advancements may involve data encryption, digital
    literacy, and particular economic policies.

    most significant technological advancement of our time, and it profoundly affects
    agriculture and other industries. Digitalization is the adoption of information
    communication technologies, such as the internet, mobile technologies, and devices.
    It also includes data analytics to enhance the creation, gathering, sharing, aggregation,
    combination, analysis, access, searchability, and presentation of digital content,
    including for the creation of services and applications. Beyond particular equipment,
    methods, and techniques, digitalization has the potential to drastically change
    the way agriculture functions. It may benefit new organizational structures for
    manufacturing and supply chains and innovation [1]. Greater focuses on precision
    agriculture, artificial intelligence (AI), the Internet of Things (IoT), and the
    use of big data to promote production and business efficiency are just a few of
    the dramatic changes digitalization is bringing about in the agricultural sector
    [2]. For public and private players involved in agro-food value chains and the
    more extensive agricultural innovation system (AIS), the digital transformation
    of agriculture can produce several benefits. By leveraging digital technologies
    and the insights gained from agrarian data, farmers may be better able to ignite
    innovation and increase agricultural productivity, sustainability, and resilience.
    Digital technologies may offer opportunities for new sources of efficiency and
    value creation both upstream and downstream of farms, in addition to supporting
    research and innovation, new services for the industry, improved traceability,
    and more efficient value chain transactions [3]. Furthermore, policymakers have
    the potential to create novel and enhanced policies for the agriculture sector
    and leverage digital technology to improve the process of formulating, executing,
    and supervising policies. For example, digitalization may provide real-time data
    on various parameters like weather conditions, crop yields, and market trends.
    Additionally, it may help in optimizing resource allocation, making effective
    decisions, and monitoring and evaluating sustainable agricultural practices. Thus,
    the integration of technology enhances transparency, efficiency, and overall effectiveness
    in shaping agricultural policies. Digitalization is a game changer that has transformed
    peoples’ perspectives and shaped the planet as well as rapidly advanced trends
    in agriculture, and it is also referred to as “smart agriculture”, which is the
    application of data-driven and precise technology to assist farmers in making
    decisions at the right time and location [4,5,6]. Farming processes are optimized
    by using technology such as drones, sensors, artificial intelligence (AI), robotics,
    cloud computing, blockchain, and decision support software. Agricultural systems,
    governance systems, and international trade focuses on value chains [7,8,9,10].
    There is broad agreement that sustainable digital agriculture can significantly
    contribute to feeding the world’s growing population [11,12]. Digitalization may
    increase agricultural output while benefiting society and the environment in several
    ways. According to Walter et al. [9], digital agriculture can improve food safety
    through enhanced traceability, lessen the burden on finite resources, and address
    climate change [11]. The expansion of international agricultural markets [10],
    the establishment of new, highly skilled employment possibilities [12], and improvements
    to animal welfare [13] are some further possible advantages of agricultural digitalization.
    Revolutionary scientific and technological developments, especially in remote
    sensing, have greatly influenced agriculture in the 21st century. Crop monitoring
    using UAV (unmanned aerial vehicle)-enabled remote sensing technologies is crucial
    for identifying and mapping large-scale agricultural fields. Extensive crop observations
    can yield valuable knowledge in agricultural policy formulation. They are also
    a prerequisite for estimating crop productivity. Using this approach, the farmer
    can improve their farm’s productivity, reduce farm input costs, and minimize environmental
    impacts. Crop health assessment at early crop growth stages ensures crop productivity.
    UAVs (or drones) equipped with cameras and sensors are remote sensing technologies
    that bridge the gap between tedious ground-based measurements and satellite imagery
    [14]. Compared to conventional ground-based crop monitoring, drones facilitate
    rapid and non-destructive measurements and provide much faster turnaround times
    than satellites at competitive costs [15]. In spatial resolution, UAVs permit
    the acquisition of appropriate images whose pixels are considerably smaller than
    objects, thus diminishing the bias effect due to background intensity [16]. Furthermore,
    they can safely fly at low altitudes in the proximity of vegetation, permitting
    high resolutions at low costs [17]. Considering the above facts, UAVs will likely
    open new possibilities in crop mapping and monitoring in precision agriculture.
    Throughout agriculture’s history, a series of revolutions have increased productivity,
    yield, and profitability to levels never before achieved. Forecasts from the market
    indicate that in the next ten years, there will be a “Digital Agricultural Revolution”,
    which may be the most recent advancement to ensure that agriculture will continue
    to meet the global population’s needs. It has been acknowledged that agriculture
    needs to be digitalized, and efforts have been undertaken to digitize the current
    value chain. In summary, by analyzing the current state of smart agriculture,
    its key technologies, and its applications, this analysis has mapped out the ongoing
    revolution in digital farming. Sophisticated sensors, data analytics, smart algorithms,
    and networking infrastructure have come together to enable the creation of a data-driven,
    precision-based paradigm for agricultural management. 2. Methodology This review
    utilized a rigorous systematic approach to select publications, using search tactics
    like PubMed, Google Scholar, Scopus, and pertinent databases. This method involved
    searching for research papers based on manuscript names, keywords, institution
    affiliation, and published article citations. Numerous research publications relevant
    to digital agriculture, smart agriculture, and precision agriculture are available
    in these gigantic scholarly libraries; hence, a strong criterion was devised and
    used to choose the most influential research findings and reject unsuitable search
    results. The papers were chosen based on relevance, publication in prestigious
    journals, research published in the English language, publications with proper
    citations and accessible via the internet, publications providing vital information
    for subsequent calculations related to various scientific aspects, and the importance
    of their conclusions. Citation tracking and significant references were also used
    to locate other relevant studies. This comprehensive approach ensured a thorough
    examination of the topic, minimizing potential bias and providing a comprehensive
    overview of the existing literature. 3. Digital Technologies and Their Contribution
    in Agriculture Over the past few decades, agriculture and food production have
    rapidly changed due to the increasing prevalence and mobility of digital technology
    [18]. The proliferation of mobile technology, remote sensing services, and distributed
    computing in food and agriculture is already enhancing smallholders’ access to
    markets, information, and inputs. It also boosts productivity and production,
    optimizes supply chains, and cuts operational costs. However, there are obstacles
    to overcome in the “digitalization” of agriculture and the food value chain. These
    include high initial implementation costs, especially for small farmers, limited
    digital literacy among farmers, reliable access to high speed internet in rural
    areas, and data security concerns. To guarantee that everyone gains from the developing
    digital society, the FAO is dedicated to supporting partners and governments in
    bridging such transdisciplinary digital gaps [19]. A schematic representation
    of the benefits and challenges of digitization in agriculture is illustrated in
    Figure 1. Figure 1. A schematic representation of the benefits and challenges
    of digitization in agriculture. Using digital technology to link agricultural
    production from the paddock to the customer is known as “digital agriculture”.
    Digital technologies can help emerging nations more quickly combat hunger and
    global poverty in rural areas [20]. Prominent technical developments include precision
    agriculture, artificial intelligence, blockchain, automation, robotics, livestock
    technology, indoor vertical farming, and contemporary greenhouse techniques. Farm
    equipment is linked to software systems that collect data from the farm and allows
    for studies of the soil and climate in particular areas. This will enable farmers
    to receive recommendations on seed selection and more accurate application of
    fertilizer and pesticides. Mobile phones have one of the greatest adoption rates
    among all the technologies invented in the last century. Digitalization will bring
    farmers and customers closer [21]. Customers can see more transparency in farming
    thanks to the accessible information on plants and animals. Agricultural productivity
    will be impacted by smart farming in the long run [22]. 4. Mobile Applications
    and Farm Management Software (FMS) Global connectedness has increased since the
    introduction of digital technologies. There is a smaller, faster, cheaper, and
    more efficient way to use mobile devices. Many farmers and businesses are receiving
    assistance so they may make better decisions. Assistance is being provided to
    farmers so they may operate more efficiently and apply fertilizer and water in
    more precise amounts. Digital technologies facilitate a multitude of operations,
    such as planning farming activities, budgeting, reporting, and keeping track of
    chores and performance. Agronomy, farm equipment, livestock handling facilities,
    communication, and other fields all make use of digital technologies. A new agricultural
    revolution will begin, and connectivity and data will be crucial. Advanced technologies
    such as artificial intelligence, analytics, and linked sensors can improve yields
    and boost the efficiency of water and other inputs. These can support the development
    of resilience and sustainability in both crop and animal husbandry. Robotics,
    automation, and sensor applications are examples of digital agricultural technologies
    used in production systems [23,24]. These days, farmers have access to a variety
    of applications. While most are accessible in Hindi and English, several offer
    additional regional languages to improve communication with farmers and cover
    all parts of the nation [25]. Figure 2 depicts the implications of mobile applications
    in agriculture. Figure 2. Implications and importance of mobile application in
    agriculture. The main focus of crop advising apps is how to manage the crop beforehand
    for a higher yield at a reduced cost. This makes the information easy and clear
    for farmers to understand [26]. Applications for soil testing are also accessible
    to farmers to test the soil and determine which crops will do well in a specific
    soil type [27]. Specific applications also provide market prices and the most
    recent information on the farming techniques used by farmers across the nation
    [28]. It will be possible for farmers to ascertain which crops yield a profit
    in a given season. Various mobile apps in Indian agriculture, like FarmersEdge,
    AgriApp, and AgriBus-NAVI, offer farmers tools for data-driven decisions, weather
    updates, crop disease diagnosis, and navigation support. Apps such as Plantix
    assist with crop diseases and nutritional deficits. FarmLogs provides comprehensive
    farm management tools, including crop health monitoring and financial insights.
    Krish-e offers a customized crop calendar and agricultural consulting, while Kheti
    Badi focuses on organic farming information in multiple languages. The Crop Insurance
    app helps farmers calculate insurance rates, and Krishify serves as a social farming
    app. Pusa Krishi, Shetkari, and Kisan Suvidha introduce technologies, market prices,
    and government initiatives, enhancing farming productivity. MenthaMitra, developed
    by CSIR-CIMAP, provides precise information for menthol mint growers, fostering
    collaboration among stakeholders and scientists [29,30]. Mobile apps have completely
    changed how stakeholders worldwide participate and disseminate information thanks
    to their enhanced user-friendliness, dependability, and connectivity [30]. By
    ensuring that farming communities implement the good agricultural practices that
    researchers have devised and by making them aware of these practices—which can
    be readily accomplished through a mobile application—the socio-economic situations
    of these communities can be improved (Figure 3). Figure 3. A schematic illustration
    of socio-economic transformation through mobile applications. AI and IoT coordination
    is a part of the integrated strategy that is farm management software. It provides
    an improved tracking mechanism for analyzing many types of biological, chemical,
    and physical production [31]. With real-time data processing capabilities, it
    requires fewer workers. Thus, with less work and time, FMSs can support the sustainability
    and quality of agricultural produce. Modern farmers do not use traditional farming
    methods; to assist them in managing their farms, the majority of farm management
    software is available as open source [32]. An application or collection of programs
    known as farm management software aids in automating, enhancing, and supporting
    farm businesses’ operational procedures. These management tools help with error
    correction, task completion, reporting, and general efficiency and effectiveness
    enhancement. All things considered, farm management software is made to best satisfy
    the requirements of company procedures. Deciding on an effective FMS is not usually
    simple because different FMS characteristics are employed for various objectives
    [33]. 5. Crop Monitoring and Phenotyping Using Artificial Intelligence AI in agriculture
    refers to using AI to enhance agricultural productivity and real-time monitoring,
    harvesting, processing, and selling. It is fundamentally playing a significant
    role in changing the agriculture industry. AI protects the agriculture industry
    from various threats, including population increases, climate change, job shortages,
    and food safety. AI has elevated the agricultural system of today to a new level.
    Crop productivity and real-time monitoring, harvesting, processing, and selling
    have increased thanks to artificial intelligence. Numerous advanced computer-based
    technologies are intended to identify multiple crucial criteria, including crop
    quality, yield detection, weed identification, and many more. AI can actually
    help the farmers move towards demand-driven agriculture. The world is now rapidly
    changing its attitude towards acceptance of AI. For instance, recently, the US
    government introduced a bill called the Farm Tech Act 2023, for regulations in
    AI technology in the agriculture sector. In recent years, there have been significant
    advancements in understanding plant phenomics, making precision farming more possible.
    This process is due to new technologies that allow detailed study of complex plant
    features. Deep learning, machine learning, and computer vision, which are measure
    features of AI, have become increasingly popular in various scientific areas.
    These AI features are now integrated into non-invasive imaging methods, improving
    the efficiency of data collection and analysis. This integration helps in creating
    tools and software for gathering information about plant phenomics in the field.
    Some open-source systems and tools allow researchers to work collaboratively and
    share data, providing the large amounts of information needed for reliable plant
    phenomics analyses. Moreover, they utilize three critical aspects of managing
    phenomic data: developing models to comprehend the relationships between genotype
    and phenotype and the interactions in the environment, managing databases to exchange
    information and resources, and developing algorithms and programs to transform
    sensory data into phenotypic information. Repeated experiments under various conditions
    must be conducted to screen plants for desired traits, considering the statistical
    requirement for an unbiased evaluation. Phenotyping, a method of assessing plant
    development in controlled environments, has been extensively debated, but it often
    fails to accurately represent the development of plants in open-field situations
    [34,35]. There is an apparent disparity in plant performance between the lab and
    the field. Compared to other imaging techniques, AI integration in tomography
    and thermography is advancing towards smarter, faster, and lower-cost solutions,
    particularly in phenotyping image data analysis. Sustainable crop production depends
    on field phenotyping, yet the throughput in the field lags behind indoor facilities,
    requiring more development to investigate useful applications of phenomics. According
    to recent investigations, AI-assisted crop phenotyping and yield predictions have
    improved crop phenotyping [36,37,38,39,40,41,42]. Furthermore, the following applications
    of AI-assisted high-throughput phenotyping platforms have been proven as successful:
    identifying the plant growth stage in wheat and maize [37] and segmenting plant
    images [38]; semantic segmentation of crops and weeds for oilseed crops [39];
    phenotyping crop disease resistance [40]; and boosting the productivity of crops
    [41,42]. The importance of AI technologies in various fields is shown in Figure
    4. Figure 4. Artificial intelligence is transforming the modern agricultural system.
    6. Precision Agriculture and Remote Sensing Technologies in Crop Production and
    Breeding Precision farming is the most important and sustainable approach to maximizing
    crop production and improving farmers’ socio-economic and livelihood conditions.
    A collection of methods known as precision agriculture (PA) can be used in various
    agricultural research fields, and variable rate technology, site-specific crop
    management, and prescription farming are among its additional names. It is a novel
    management method that uses georeferenced data to govern agricultural systems,
    applies monitoring procedures, and integrates soil, plant, and climate factors
    to detail georeferenced data employing computers, satellites, positioning systems,
    and remote sensing equipment to offer information on the better decisions that
    can be made. Furthermore, after carefully examining all the variables that influence
    crop growth in a given farm field, it promotes tillage and the accurate application
    of agricultural inputs, such as herbicides, fertilizers, and irrigation. To put
    it more clearly, Gomiero [43] describes it as an information-technology-based
    agricultural management system used to detect, assess, and control soil variability
    in terms of space and time within fields to increase profitability, preserve the
    environment, and promote sustainability. The science of PA uses advanced technology,
    sensors, and analysis tools to help with management, decision making, and crop
    production improvements. The world has embraced PA, a novel idea that promises
    to boost output, cut down on labor costs, and guarantee efficient management of
    irrigation and fertilizer systems. It uses a lot of data and information to enhance
    crop quality, yields, and the utilization of agricultural resources [44]. Farmers
    have adopted this novel and sophisticated technique in recent years to improve
    productivity, quality, and yield to deliver optimum inputs like water and fertilizer
    [45]. It needs an enormous amount of high spatial resolution data regarding the
    health or status of the crop during the growth season. Connecting the GPS and
    the GIS (geographic information system) has enabled the advancement and implementation
    of site-explicit cultivation owing to a large amount of geospatial information
    that can now be effectively controlled and analyzed. The GPS and GIS enhance precision
    agriculture by providing accurate location data and spatial analysis capabilities.
    The GPS enables precise navigation for optimized field operations, while the GIS
    facilitates variable rate technology (VRT) implementations, adjusting input application
    based on field variability. GPS-based applications are being used for agriculture
    planning, field planning, soil examination, crop exploration, variable rate application,
    and yield mapping. Furthermore, GPS systems are essential for the majority of
    PA application technologies since customers utilize them to schedule production
    activities in real time at specific locations. They are most frequently used in
    agriculture for a wide range of tasks, including crop soil mapping and monitoring,
    contouring of fields, and production tracking. An information retrieval unit,
    mapping and visualization software, a GPS receiver, and a differential global
    positioning system (DGPS) mounted on a field-traveling vehicle make up a conventional
    GPS. The farmer contours the field with identical equipment and collects data
    with both GPS units. They can also traverse the area and record data on regions
    affected by pests and diseases during the plant season. Farm trucks are driven
    in designated field regions during crop surveying using GPS devices. Depending
    on each zone’s soil conditions and production system characteristics, a farm vehicle
    can help perform duties at different rates. Regardless of the data sources, PA’s
    primary goal is to assist farmers in running their businesses. This assistance
    can take many forms, but ultimately results in a reduction in the resources required.
    Automatons, sometimes referred to as UAVs or unmanned ethereal frameworks (UASs),
    are crewless aircraft that can be remotely operated in a mechanical setting [46].
    They work together because they have additional sensors and a GPS installed. Drones
    are utilized in agriculture for various purposes, including weed identification,
    crop health monitoring, herd and animal monitoring, irrigation equipment monitoring,
    and disaster management [47,48,49]. Remote sensing, which collects, processes,
    and analyzes images using UAVs, has significantly impacted agriculture [50]. UAVs
    are primarily utilized in precision agriculture for applications such as crop
    monitoring [51], soil and field analysis [52], pesticide spraying [53,54,55],
    and crop height estimations [56,57,58,59]. Growing populations and changing climate
    patterns are expected only to increase the need for efficient agriculture. To
    summarize, a diagrammatic illustration of precision agriculture using remote sensing
    combined with sensors, machine learning algorithms, and artificial intelligence
    is presented in Figure 5. Figure 5. Precision farming systems combined with drones,
    sensors, and artificial intelligence. Drones or UAVs rely mostly on sensor and
    microcontroller developments designed to make up for pilot absences, allowing
    autonomous behavior and crewless vehicle flight [57]. Farmers have been employing
    these drones to spray chemicals for years since they are believed to be highly
    practical and efficient in overcast conditions. The problem of being limited access
    to a field of tall crops, such as maize, has also been resolved with their assistance
    [58,59]. A microcomputer-based sprayer control framework was used in [60] to retrofit
    an air carrier plantation sprayer. They are also recognized to have a major advantage
    over satellite aerial sensors in their high picture resolution [61,62]. Kale et
    al. [63] employed drones to establish a control circle for horticultural reasons
    by spraying artificial materials on produce in places where the drones were connected.
    These drones were fitted with remote sensing network (RSN) sensors, which were
    positioned atop the crops and controlled the synthetic material application procedure.
    Based on the information from these remote sensors, drones could only spray synthetic
    materials in approved regions. Huang and Reddy [64] built a low-volume sprayer
    that was mounted to an autonomous helicopter. With larger droplet sizes and greater
    target rates, this technology and its systematic results are a foundation that
    may be applied to the creation of UAV flying application frameworks for higher
    yields. Farmers now have a plethora of new options to boost yields and minimize
    crop damage owing to the development of sophisticated sensors and imaging capabilities.
    In recent years, UAVs that are utilized for practical reasons have not performed
    optimally. Novel sensors are affixed to unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), and modern
    cameras serve as the client’s eyes on the ground. Optimal data collection, analysis,
    and surveying protocols are continuously being devised and tested [65,66]. In
    the field of agriculture, performing aerial surveys is nothing new. For the past
    ten years, large croplands and forests have been inspected by satellites, but
    the deployment of UAVs has brought the precision and flexibility to a new level.
    Since UAV photos are acquired 400–500 feet above the ground, they yield a higher
    quality and accuracy. Digital photographs from a model aircraft were assessed
    [67] to remotely sense crops’ biomass and nitrogen status. This study utilized
    a computerized camera and colored canvases, observing extreme disparities in the
    computerized numbers for a comparable reflectance due to variations in the introduced
    parameters selected by the sophisticated camera. Additionally, they made use of
    the Normalized Green–Red Difference Index (NGRDI) and established a direct correlation
    between it and the normalized contrast of the respective red and green reflectances.
    A low-cost multispectral imaging system was created for use in crop monitoring
    [68]. It is composed of two cameras that are integrated into a drone and a microprocessor.
    While one camera is a standard RGB camera, the first is sensitive to infrared
    radiation. This technology offers data and pictures that software can use to calculate
    the crop’s health condition based on the NDVI. Reinecke and Prinsloo [69] investigated
    the advantages and drawbacks of drone use in agriculture, providing real-world
    examples of how drones are used on farms. Based on their application in the agricultural
    industry, precision agriculture technologies (PATs) are classified into crop PATs
    and animal PATs. Crop PATs maximize crop output and ecological impacts by studying
    spatial and temporal deviations, whereas livestock PATs strengthen livestock product
    supply [24,70]. Farmers are progressively embracing fewer chemical agricultural
    practices, frequently linked to conservation agriculture concepts. This transition
    is mostly due to the reduced usage of fertilizers, pesticides, and herbicides,
    effective water use, and lower greenhouse gas emissions [71]. The utilization
    of cutting-edge sensors, decision-making systems, and technological innovations
    has led to greater adoption of revolutionary crop management technologies in major
    crops, lowering pesticide/herbicide inputs [72,73]. Micro-dosing and herbicide/pesticide
    patch spraying endeavor to minimize fertilizer, herbicide, and pesticide inputs
    by targeting specific weed species and plants. Farmers face problems in fertilizer
    and pesticide choices, rates, and application, necessitating rigorous decision
    making based on the yield of crops, weed flora, population dynamics, revenues,
    detrimental effects on the environment, and soil components [74,75]. In the realm
    of crop breeding, crop PATs have emerged as game-changing technologies that are
    transforming conventional agricultural techniques and promoting more sustainable
    and effective food production. The accuracy and productivity of crop breeding
    procedures have been dramatically improved by this combination of cutting-edge
    technologies, boosting agricultural yields, resource efficiency, and environmental
    sustainability [76]. Utilizing GPS-guided tractors, drones, sensors, and satellite
    imaging, one can gain valuable insights and data to optimize farm management by
    understanding crop health, soil conditions, and environmental factors. Furthermore,
    they help to collect vast amounts of data about fields, enabling informed decision
    making regarding crop breeding [40,41,45,58,61,64,69]. This data-driven approach
    helps assess crop health, detect diseases, and identify nutrient deficiencies,
    leading to superior varieties. Moreover, these technologies enable early detection
    of stress, diseases, and pest infestations in crops, enabling breeders to take
    proactive measures, reduce chemical inputs, and minimize yield losses [56]. Additionally,
    they optimize resource use by accurately assessing crop needs through remote sensing
    data and fostering environmental resilience and sustainable practices through
    more resilient crop varieties. By integrating these technologies, breeders can
    develop crop varieties suited to diverse ecological conditions, enhancing crop
    performance [76]. As a result, the breeding process is accelerated; breeders can
    assess crop varieties’ performance under varied conditions faster when data are
    gathered swiftly and accurately. Therefore, these technologies constitute vital
    tools for modern crop breeding, delivering breeders helpful information for resource
    optimization and well-informed decision making. Especially in light of shifting
    climates, these technologies are critical to developing durable, high-yielding,
    and adaptive crop varieties. 7. The IoT and Sensor Technology The IoT and smart
    sensors have enormous potential for gathering and analyzing real-time data to
    track crop quality and yield, soil health, and water content at a location [77].
    The IoT and smart sensors work together to replace traditional farming practices
    with smart farming, which produces higher yields. In agriculture, IoT-enabled
    technological approaches aid in evaluating crop quality, soil health, soil erosion,
    fertilizer needs, and soil fertility [78]. Some examples in the real world are
    the following: John Deere’s connected farm integrates IoT sensors in tractors
    for real-time field monitoring, aiding farmers in decision making about planting
    and harvesting. Sundrop Farms in Australia uses the IoT in smart greenhouses,
    monitoring climate conditions. Also, IBM’s “The Weather Company” provides real-time
    weather data for agriculture, assisting farmers in planning activities like planting
    and irrigation. The role of the IoT in agricultural farming is illustrated in
    Figure 6. Figure 6. The role and significance of the IoT in smart agricultural
    farming. Additionally, the IoT facilitates optical irrigation and seed quality
    and crop development monitoring in different phases [79]. IoT-enabled equipment,
    real-time data collectiion, and automation are critical requirements for advancing
    the smart agriculture market [80]. Real-time IoT and remote sensing data can be
    processed for PA and forestry [81,82,83]. Smart soil moisture sensors offer real-time
    data for precise irrigation, reducing water wastage by enabling farmers to determine
    the optimal timing of application and the quantity of water needed. Efficient
    water use and reduced energy consumption for irrigation lead to cost savings.
    Furthermore, smart soil moisture sensors and the IoT monitor pre- and post-harvest
    conditions in agricultural areas. For accurate temperature, moisture, soil condition,
    and crop measurements in particular locations, the IoT, ZigBee, and Arduino sensors
    can be employed [84]. However, cognitive complexity, security concerns, privacy,
    and inadequate facilities have been noted as some of the limitations of using
    the IoT in smart agriculture. 8. Automation and Robotics in Agriculture In agriculture,
    automation has significantly changed the landscape by enabling machines to perform
    jobs that previously required human labor [85]. Agriculture needs to include technology
    more as the world’s population and food demands rise [86,87,88]. Using intelligent
    seeding robots that can recognize crop varieties and planting regions is one advantage
    of autonomous farming; it streamlines and increases efficiency [89]. Weeding robots
    enable precision herbicide application, minimizing pesticide use and environmental
    impacts [90]. Furthermore, with the use of robot arms, automated harvesting robots
    can determine when a crop is ready to be harvested, reducing labor expenses and
    time spent on the task while boosting output. In significant economic sectors
    like agri-food, which have a relatively low productivity, robotics and autonomous
    systems (RASs) are being implemented. A significant impact of robotics has been
    demonstrated on agriculture management and productivity. Due to the inefficiency
    of traditional farming machinery, researchers have recently begun focusing on
    technologies for designing autonomous agricultural equipment [91]. The development
    of this technology aims to supplant human labor and yield efficient outcomes for
    both small- and large-scale facilities [92]. The use of robotic technologies in
    this industry has greatly increased production. Moreover, robotics technologies
    improve agricultural practices by providing harvesting automation by differentiating
    the factors and characteristics of vegetation, monitoring, and data collection
    by providing soil health and environmental factors, sorting and packaging, labor
    assistance utilizing exoskeletons and wearables, robotics scouting for diseases
    and nutrient deficiency in crops, etc. Sometimes, a trivial but significant change
    towards advancement of technology results in multifold benefits. For example,
    the invention of a device known as Eli Whitney’s cotton gin gave rise to the idea
    of developing a technology that could dramatically speed up the process of separating
    the cotton fiber from seed, revolutionizing the cotton industry [93,94]. In a
    single day, it produced fifty pounds of cotton; autonomous agricultural robots
    are a result of this. A simple automated model was developed to accurately determine
    seed placement [95]. Additionally, extremely accurate seed positioning was devised
    to guarantee a seed ground velocity of zero. This is crucial because it ensures
    that the seed will not bounce from its original place upon impact with the soil.
    Automated machinery recorded the plant’s development or status. Numerous biosensors
    were developed to track plant development and identify plant illnesses [96,97].
    The human weeding method was superseded by laser weeding technology, which uses
    a computer-controlled mobile concentrated infrared light beam to damage weed cells
    [98]. Additionally, automatic irrigation systems were developed to ensure efficient
    use of water. The agriculture industry uses 85% of the freshwater resources that
    are available worldwide. This percentage is rising quickly in tandem with population
    expansion and rising food prices. As a result, we must develop more effective
    systems to guarantee that water resources are used appropriately for irrigation.
    Automatic irrigation scheduling techniques have replaced manual irrigation based
    on soil water measurements. When using autonomous irrigation machines, consideration
    should be given to plant evapotranspiration, which depends on several atmospheric
    parameters like humidity, wind speed, and solar radiation, as well as crop factors
    like growth stage, plant density, soil characteristics, and pests. Smart irrigation
    technology aims to enhance yields without requiring a lot of labor by using sensors
    to measure water levels, soil temperatures, fertilizer contents, and weather patterns.
    Machine-to-machine technology was created to facilitate data sharing and communication
    between agricultural field nodes as well as between them and the server or cloud
    via a main network [99]. An automated robotic model was created to identify the
    temperature and moisture content of Raspberry Pi 3 and Arduino boards. The Arduino
    microcontroller, which is connected to edge-level hardware, receives data at regular
    intervals and processes them by converting the analog input to digital. To save
    labor and time during watering, ref. [100] also created an automated irrigation
    system using Arduino technology. Savitha and Maheshwari [101] also devised the
    concept of an automated and effective watering system by creating remote sensors
    with Arduino technology, which can boost the output by as much as 40%. Zimdahl
    [102] conducted extensive research on the subject and concluded that weeds were
    the greatest rivals for water, with plants starting to compete for water and nutrients
    when their roots overlapped in the soil. The amount of water needed to generate
    one pound of dry matter is the amount required for the plant’s above-ground parts.
    Light constitutes an essential component required for plant growth. Tall weeds
    usually obstruct the plants’ access to sunlight. Certain weeds, including redroot
    pigweed and green foxtail, are shade intolerant, but other weeds, like Arkansas
    rose, field bindweed, and common milkweed spotted spurge, are sometimes tolerant
    to shade. A vision-based weed detection technique in natural illumination was
    devised by [103]. It was developed using a genetic computation to identify a location
    in the Hue–Saturation–Intensity (HSI) shading space (GAHSI—Genetic Algorithm for
    Hue–Saturation–Intensity) for field weed detection. It makes use of unusual lighting
    situations, such as radiant and shady conditions, which are mosaicked to determine
    the probability of using the GAHSI to locate the location or zones in the field
    in the shading space where these two limits are surpassed simultaneously. A robotic
    weed management system was presented in [104]. The robot had many vision systems
    built into it. Two types of vision were employed: one was color-based and used
    to distinguish between individual weeds, and the other was gray-level vision,
    which was employed to create a row structure to guide the robot along the rows.
    An innovative algorithm was used to generate the row recognition system, which
    has an accuracy of ±2 cm [104]. This technique was first tested for weed management
    within a row of crops in a greenhouse. The robots were guided along the row structure
    using vision-based technology to eliminate weeds and distinguish a single crop
    from weed plants. By integrating automation into fundamental activities, farmers
    can maintain their competitiveness in the market and considerably increase the
    economic value of their operations. 9. Climate-Smart Future Agriculture Crops
    for Sustainable Agriculture Climate-smart agriculture requires a digital integration
    of climate and agriculture information. It plays a pivotal role in enhancing CSA,
    which aims to make agriculture more resilient to climate change while ensuring
    sustainable productivity. India is digitalizing rapidly, so its policies and practices
    to achieve climate-smart agriculture must also promote digital integration. The
    Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) of the G20 and India include climate-smart
    agriculture (CSA) [105]. It is a hugely complex task. The digitalization roadmap
    for CSA in India clearly and concisely visualizes the challenges. The Agriculture
    Action Plan (2023–2030) of the World Bank, which intends to allocate USD 35 billion
    to climate-related agricultural initiatives, includes CSA as a major component.
    By adopting a comprehensive approach to landscape management that considers crops,
    livestock, forests, and fisheries, CSA transcends conventional farming and is
    more than just a development of traditional agricultural methods. Its main objective
    is to successfully handle the interrelated problems of climate change and food
    security. While CSA is applicable globally, regional differences may lead to different
    objectives and concerns, whether in a country from the Global South or the Global
    North. A concept ideotype of a climate-smart agriculture future crop is presented
    in Figure 7. Figure 7. A concept ideotype of the climate-smart agriculture future
    crop. In India, where agriculture is a vital livelihood amid a growing population,
    climate-smart agriculture (CSA) practices have demonstrated significant impacts.
    The system of rice intensification (SRI) in Bihar has enhanced rice productivity
    through improved planting, water management, and organic practices, leading to
    increased yields, a reduced water usage, and a heightened resilience to extreme
    weather events. Drought-resistant crop introduction in Maharastra, coupled with
    rainwater harvesting, has resulted in improved yields during water-scarce periods,
    enhancing food security. Agroforestry initiatives in Andra Pradesh, involving
    tree intercropping, have contributed to increased crop yields, improved soil health,
    and additional income sources. Integrated pest management (IPM) adoption in Gujrat,
    emphasizing natural predators and biological controls, has improved crop health,
    reduced environmental impacts, and heightened resilience to pests. In Odisha,
    research and adoption of climate-resilient crop varieties have led to improved
    yields, reduced vulnerability to climate stresses, and an increased overall agricultural
    productivity. Climate-smart agriculture (CSA), also known as climate-resilient
    agriculture, is an integrated approach to land management that aims to ensure
    food security by taking into account the growing global population and helping
    to adapt agricultural practices, livestock, and crops to the effects of climate
    change. CSA will work to counteract these effects whenever possible by reducing
    greenhouse gas emissions from agriculture. Increasing agricultural productivity
    is just as important as practicing sustainable agriculture or carbon farming.
    The three pillars of the CSA are raising agricultural incomes and production,
    constructing and adjusting to climate change resilience, and lowering or eliminating
    greenhouse gas emissions from agriculture. Several steps have been proposed to
    address the issues that crops and plants may face. For instance, for CSA, cultivating
    heat-tolerant crop types, mulching, water management, shade houses, boundary trees,
    carbon sequestration, and suitable housing and spacing for cats are advised to
    combat rising temperatures and heat stress. Efforts are being made to integrate
    CSA into essential government spending, policy, and planning frameworks. Policies
    to combat poverty, promote sustainable development, and expand economic growth
    are necessary for CSA to succeed. They must also be incorporated into social safety
    net initiatives, disaster risk reduction plans, and activities. Sustainable agriculture
    aims to preserve the planet’s capacity to support future generations while producing
    the resources required for the world’s human population. Sustainable agriculture
    focuses on growing various crops, such as heritage plants, which are frequently
    climate-adapted [105]. Instead of depending on a single crop, consider polyculture,
    which extends several crops alongside one another. A critical aspect of sustainable
    agriculture is water conservation. Improving water storage techniques to stop
    evaporation losses and seepage and planting climate-appropriate or drought-resistant
    crops are two ways to reduce wastewater. The poisoning of groundwater and surface
    waters is another issue that sustainable agriculture aims to solve. Pollutants
    from large-scale facilities, such as pathogen-filled animal excrement and pesticide
    runoff, frequently find their way into bodies of water, harming the ecosystem
    and hurting both people and wildlife [106]. In addition to lowering agricultural
    yields and the amount of area accessible for agriculture, soil erosion also deteriorates
    the quality of the water. Farmers can use no-till techniques or lower the frequency
    and intensity of tillage to reduce these effects. In order to minimize runoff,
    fertilizers and pesticides, whether synthetic or organic, should only be applied
    in modest quantities, especially in dry weather. Before using agrochemicals, extra
    precautions should be taken to prevent the airborne spread of contaminants. Buffer
    plants are a tool some farmers use to trap nutrient pollution before it enters
    water bodies. Digital technology enhances sustainable agriculture through precision
    farming, data-driven decision making, smart irrigation, crop monitoring, supply
    chain optimization, climate-resilient crop selection, efficient resources with
    smart machinery, educational platforms, and weather risk mitigation, ultimately
    promoting environmental sustainability and resilience. 10. E-Commerce and Direct-to-Consumer
    Sales In agriculture, e-commerce utilizes digital platforms to facilitate the
    buying and selling of agricultural goods and services (Figure 8). E-commerce platforms
    in agriculture enhance clarity and consistency by removing intermediaries, providing
    transparent information, enabling real-time inventory management, supporting direct
    marketing, facilitating digital payments, leveraging data analytics, and ensuring
    visibility in the supply chain. This transformation benefits both farmers and
    consumers in the evolving landscape of agricultural sales. Figure 8. Role of e-commerce
    in the agriculture sector. E-commerce encompasses a variety of tasks, including
    farmers selling their produce directly to customers or businesses through online
    marketplaces, as well as the digital delivery of suppliers, tools, and agricultural
    information [107]. With the help of this creative strategy, farmers will be able
    to reach a wider audience, enhance the effectiveness of the farm supply chain,
    and boost the availability of fresh, locally made products. Incorporating digital
    technology into traditional agriculture promises to yield novel prospects and
    benefits. In the agricultural sector, mobile and online commerce provides a direct
    communication channel between farmers and consumers. Digital technologies enable
    farmers to build trust in the agricultural supply chain, reach a broader audience,
    and provide transparent information about their produce’s origin and quality.
    Agri-businesses can boost farmers’ incomes and enhance customer purchase convenience
    using digital technologies. Everyone benefits from this integration because it
    has so many advantages. Integrating digital technology with traditional farming
    methods is a critical first step in creating a more productive, transparent, and
    sustainable agricultural system [108,109]. 11. Conclusions With 10 billion people
    expected to live on Earth by 2050, there will be a lot of pressure on the agricultural
    sector to boost crop yields and productivity. Two possible strategies have emerged
    to address the impending food shortages: either embracing innovative practices
    and utilizing technological advancements to increase the productivity of existing
    farmland or expanding land use and adopting large-scale farming. The modern agricultural
    landscape is changing and branching out in various innovative directions due to
    numerous obstacles to achieving the desired farming productivity, including limited
    land, labor shortages, climate change, environmental issues, and declining soil
    fertility, to name a few. Farming has undoubtedly advanced from the days of manual
    ploughs and horse-drawn equipment. New technologies are being introduced every
    season to increase productivity and optimize yields. However, large agri-businesses
    and small farmers frequently lose out on the improvements to farming practices
    that artificial intelligence might bring to the agricultural industry. The agricultural
    sector must adjust to a plethora of growing issues, including shifting consumer
    preferences, environmental deterioration, the scarcity of farm workers, population
    growth, and nutritional changes. In conclusion, digitization in agriculture promises
    comprehensive solutions, efficient resource use, reduced costs, enhanced farmer
    livelihoods, economic growth, and environmental sustainability. Moreover, the
    upcoming era of nanotechnology, quantum computing, and machine learning with big
    data analysis, blockchain technology, etc., will present new possibilities and
    opportunities in this sector and will serve mankind to create better options for
    future generations. 12. Future Research Directions Smart agriculture is dynamic,
    and ongoing research and technological advancements are expected to generate new
    results and insights. As a result of our findings, we propose specific fields
    and future perspectives for further strengthening research. These fields include
    investigating the application of smart agriculture in urban and controlled areas,
    vertical farming, hydroponics, and aquaponics, where PA can be employed to maximize
    resources such as water, nutrients, and energy, ensuring sustainable and productive
    farming practices in tight spaces. Smart agriculture is a promising solution to
    address the challenges of limited land availability in urban areas, and farmers
    can monitor their crops and detect early signs of pests or diseases, allowing
    them to target specific areas with pesticides instead of applying them broadly.
    This reduces pesticide use and minimizes the negative impact on beneficial insects
    and the environment. These innovative techniques can reduce the carbon footprint
    associated with traditional agricultural practices. Smart agriculture in urban
    areas can help address food security challenges by enabling local production and
    reducing dependence on long-distance transportation. Moreover, developments in
    drone technology and satellite-based remote sensing for more accurate and fast
    data collection can help with large-scale agricultural surveillance, crop health
    assessment, and resource optimization. Advancements in drone technology and satellite-based
    remote sensing can revolutionize disaster management by monitoring affected areas
    and enabling swift response efforts. Conservation efforts allow for more efficient
    tracking of wildlife populations and the identification of habitat degradation,
    allowing for the identification of pollution sources and the implementation of
    effective mitigation strategies. In addition, more targeted research is needed
    to investigate how intelligent agriculture technology can help sustainable farming
    goals, such as reducing pesticide use, effectively managing water, and improving
    soil health. Crop varieties can be selected that are more resilient to changing
    climate conditions, reducing the risk of crop failure. Takes smart post-harvest
    management technologies, including cold chain monitoring, quality control, and
    efficient shipping, as an example. These technologies can help preserve the freshness
    and quality of harvested crops, ensuring a longer shelf life and reducing waste.
    Implementing these solutions can also increase perishable items’ shelf lives,
    allowing for extended storage and distribution periods. By expanding the IoT and
    sensor networks in agriculture, farmers can gain real-time insights into their
    crops and make data-driven decisions, which will lead to increased productivity,
    reduced resource waste, and improved overall sustainability in the agricultural
    sector. AI technology, such as machine learning algorithms, might improve agricultural
    decision-making processes such as crop monitoring, disease/pest identification,
    yield forecasting, and resource optimization. AI integration can also enable the
    development of autonomous farming systems that can automate tasks such as planting,
    harvesting, irrigation scheduling, crop disease detection, and precision farming
    techniques, resulting in an increased efficiency, time and resource savings for
    farmers, and an increased agricultural productivity. Additionally, future research
    will focus on building solid frameworks and methods to protect sensitive agricultural
    data, which could involve exploring encryption techniques and secure communication
    protocols to safeguard data transmission in smart agriculture systems. These frameworks
    and procedures should ensure data encryption and secure storage and address potential
    vulnerabilities in innovative agriculture systems. Exploring the potential of
    blockchain technology in securing and maintaining the integrity of agricultural
    data could be a promising avenue for future research. In addition, the interaction
    between farmers and smart agricultural technology emphasizes the necessity of
    user-friendly interfaces and farmer training programs to ensure optimal adoption
    and usage. By understanding these interactions, we can identify the challenges
    that arise from the complexity of these technologies. Author Contributions Conceptualization,

  description: Site-specific crop management is based on the postulate of varying
    soil and crop requirements in a field. Therefore, a field is separated into homogenous
    management zones, using available data to adapt management practices environment
    to maximize productivity and profitability while reducing environmental impacts.
    Due to advancing sensor technologies, crop growth and yield data on more minor
    scales are common, but soil data often needs to be more appropriate. Crop growth
    models have shown promise as a decision support tool for site-specific farming.
    The Decision Support System for Agrotechnology Transfer (DSSAT) is a widely used
    point-based model. To overcome the problem of inappropriate soil input data problem,
    this study introduces an external plug-in program called Soil Profile Optimizer
    (SPO), which uses the current DSSAT v4.8 to calibrate soil profile parameters
    on a site-specific level. Developed as an inverse modelling approach, the SPO
    can calibrate selected soil profile parameters by targeting available in-season
    plant data. Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) and normalized RMSE as error minimization
    criteria are used. The SPO was tested and evaluated by comparing different simulation
    scenarios in a case study of a 3-yr field trial with maize. The scenario with
    optimized soil profiles, conducted with the SPO, resulted in an R2 of 0.76 between
    simulated and observed yield and led to significant improvements compared to the
    scenario conducted with field scale soil profile information (R2 0.03). The SPO
    showed promise in using spatial plant measurements to estimate management zone
    scale soil parameters required for the DSSAT model.

  explanation: The Soil Profile Optimizer (SPO), developed by Memic et al. (2021),
    is a software plug-in for DSSAT that enables the optimization of selected soil
    profile parameters through inverse modeling. This study demonstrated the application
    of SPO for site-specific crop modeling by calibrating three soil profile parameters
    (SLLL, SLRO, and SRGF) to simulate grain weight in a 3-year maize field trial.
    The model performance using optimized soil profiles led to an R2 of 0.76, an EF
    of 0.75, and a mean RMSE of 600 kg ha-1, indicating a substantial improvement
    over simulations conducted with field-scale soil characterization (R2 = 0.03,
    EF = -0.13, RMSE = 1800 kg ha-1). The study highlights the potential of the SPO
    in improving the accuracy of crop simulations in site-specific management applications.

    access 21 March 2024 Introduction The approach of Precision Agriculture (PA) and
    its potential to increase yield in agricultural production or reduce environmental
    impacts and input costs by variable-rate application of production inputs was
    introduced in the mid-1980s. Advancing technological progress created the conditions
    for sustainable and environmentally sound agricultural practices (Basso et al.
    2017; Gebbers & Adamchuk, 2010; Zhang et al. 2002). The concept of PA in crop
    production is based on identifying spatial yield variability within a field by
    using average field yield as a reference to delineate high and low-yielding areas.
    Spatial variability is considered the result of complex interactions among site-specific
    characteristics like rooting depth, soil heat balance, water and oxygen balance,
    nutrient supply, weather, pests, and management during the growing season (Maestrini
    & Basso, 2018; Thorp et al. 2008). Temporal variability is the variation in yield
    observed for a specific field over multiple years (Basso et al. 2017). Considering
    both approaches enables the explanation of yield variability by interpreting temporal
    variability through weather-related variabilities and spatial variability through
    variable soil-related properties (Maestrini & Basso, 2018). Site-specific analysis
    can lead to spatial management decisions such as variable N application and seeding
    rate (Memic et al. 2019). However, to implement a systematic approach for site-specific
    management, current crop conditions must be provided by process-based modelling
    or in-season observations from remote sensing. Process-based crop growth models
    are designed to quantify crop yield and yield-limiting factors while fully capturing
    interactions between crops and the environment (Boote et al. 1997). They are used
    to predict spatial variability of yield and to support the decision-making process
    of optimal timing of management practices (Batchelor et al. 2002; Braga & Jones,
    2004). The Decision Support System for Agrotechnology Transfer (DSSAT) is one
    of the most widely used process-oriented crop modelling software solutions considering
    different management and environmental conditions within homogeneous land units
    for more than 40 crops (Hoogenboomet al. 2019). The DSSAT was designed based on
    a modular structure approach with the Cropping System Model (CSM) as its key component.
    This programming code includes primary agronomic components such as soil, weather,
    and crop management practices for simulating crop growth (Boote, 2019). Since
    DSSAT is a point-based model, it can be applied to site-specific areas within
    a field if appropriate inputs are available at that spatial scale. This can be
    done by dividing heterogeneous fields into smaller and relatively homogenous site-specific
    units that can be treated uniformly (Batchelor et al. 2002; Paz et al. 1999).
    Spatial yield variability in a field can be linked to a certain extent to the
    variability of soil properties (Thorp et al. 2008). Soil sampling is expensive
    and labor intensive, and from a site-specific perspective, it is impractical for
    many sites within a field. Pedo transfer functions (PTFs) are commonly used to
    reduce the effort in soil sampling by deriving the target model input parameters
    from minimum input data (Bouma, 1992). PTFs use easily identifiable soil properties,
    like texture or porosity, to determine model inputs such as hydraulic, thermal,
    biochemical, and solute transport parameters. The correlation between properties
    and parameters is conventionally derived with regression algorithms/techniques
    (statistical/neural regression), calibrated using a specific region database (van
    Looy et al. 2017; Aitkenhead et al. 2016). However, due to their empirical nature,
    PTFs are generally accurate for a specific region but may be inaccurate for specific
    sites (Patil & Singh, 2016; Wösten et al. 2001). A key parameter in crop production
    and a driver of yield variability is the plant available water capacity (PAWC)
    of the soil (Hoffmann et al. 2016; Maestrini & Basso, 2018; Wu et al. 2019). Physical
    soil properties regulate water retention, rate of water flow, the fate of nutrients,
    chemicals, and pollutants in soil, and determine the accessibility of water for
    plant uptake, crop growth, and environmental quality and, consequently, are crucial
    inputs for crop models (Indoria et al. 2020; Ritchie, 1998). Hoffmann et al. (2016)
    showed that 81% of spatial variability of yield (silage maize) could be explained
    by four variables: precipitation, PAWC of the soil profile, soil profile depth,
    and PAWC of the topsoil. Moreover, PAWC was the dominant variable, explaining
    58% of the yield variability (Hoffmann et al. 2016). The tipping bucket approach
    is the general soil water balance approach used in DSSAT-CSM. The approach assumes
    one-dimensional water flow (Ritchie, 1998) involves integrating surface water
    flow, the variability of infiltration amount, and tile drainage characteristics
    to compute daily water available in each soil layer (Gijsman et al. 2002). The
    PTF developed by Saxton et al. (1986) using multilinear regression of the data
    collected by Rawls et al. (1982) can compute the three hydraulic parameters (Estimands):
    volumetric water content at drained upper limit (DUL), volumetric water content
    at lower limit (LL), volumetric water content at saturation (SAT) with the minimum
    input of the two variables of soil texture: silt and clay (Gijsman et al. 2002;
    Saxton et al. 1986). Complex spatial patterns of physical soil properties combined
    with rainfall patterns can lead to highly variable plant water availability and
    rooting characteristics that affect dynamic interactions in the simulation of
    growth processes (Batchelor et al. 2002; Paz et al. 1999). Missing or inaccurate
    soil input data might lead to errors in modelling and final yield simulation (Hoffmann
    et al. 2016). Particularly in site-specific modelling applications, incorrect
    estimation of soil hydraulic parameters complicates the explanation of yield gaps
    and the estimation of best spatial management practices (Braga & Jones, 2004).
    The conclusion from the literature is that yield variability in a field among
    multiple crops can be mainly attributed to the spatial variability of PAWC (Batchelor
    & Paz, 1997; Braga & Jones, 2004; Hoffmann et al. 2016; Wu et al. 2019). However,
    the precision of PTFs varies, and a generic approach to optimize soil profile
    parameters is recommended (van Looy et al. 2017). Several studies in crop modelling
    reported the impact and the advantage of using optimization to estimate soil profile
    properties (Batchelor et al. 2002, 2004a; Batchelor & Paz, 1997; Braga & Jones,
    2004; Thorp et al. 2008; Wu et al. 2019). However, it is essential to note that
    the study referenced (Batchelor et al. 2002) was conducted in the early 2000s
    using DSSAT version 3.7. Since then, no generic optimization approach for soil
    profile parameters in DSSAT-CSM has been undertaken. This study aimed to develop
    a generic optimization approach to estimate standard soil parameters required
    by DSSAT v 4.8 and future versions. The approach was based on inverse modelling,
    which optimizes the objective function (loss function) based on parameter search
    techniques using variables more easily measured. A software plug-in called Soil
    Profile Optimizer (SPO) was developed to optimize parameters required by the DSSAT-CSM
    model based on easily measured target variables such as yield, tops weight, leaf
    area index (LAI), etc. The SPO targets selected soil parameters by minimizing
    the difference between simulated and observed output variable/s (e.g., yield,
    LAI, tops weight, etc.) based on the normalized root mean square error (nRMSE).
    The detailed objectives of this paper were (a) to develop a systematic approach
    to optimize soil profile inputs for DSSAT v 4.8 and incorporate it into a software
    plug-in SPO, (b) to test the application of the SPO on a 3-yr field trial dataset
    of maize (Zea mays L.) by comparing different simulation approaches, (c) to evaluate
    the influence of different soil profile parameters in this field trial. Materials
    and methods Experimental data The data set used in this publication was derived
    from a 3-yr field trial (2006–2008) that tested different nitrogen management
    strategies in corn (Zea mays L., cultivar ̒Companero̕) by evaluating the means
    of corn grain yield and marginal net return. The study was conducted on the Riech
    field at the Research Station Ihinger Hof of the University of Hohenheim, Southwestern
    Germany. Ihinger Hof (48.74ʹN, 8.93ʹE) is located 475 m above sea level, and the
    climatic conditions at the research station are characterized by a mean annual
    precipitation of 694 mm, a mean temperature of 8.4 °C, and a mean daily solar
    radiation of 10.9 MJ m−2 (1976–2005) (Fig. 1). Fig. 1 Ihinger Hof Research Station
    average temperature and precipitation, years 2006–2008 (after Hartmann et al.
    (2018) Full size image The soil’s mean pH and organic matter content were 7.2,
    respectively, 2.6%. The nitrogen application strategy used in this work was based
    on a uniform application of 160 kg N ha−1 as KAS (26% N). The input data used
    for the model input files were based on the publications of Link et al. (2013)
    and Memic et al. (2019). The site was ploughed (0.25 m) in autumn after the harvest
    of the previous crop, corn. Seedbed preparation was done shortly before sowing
    in April using a harrow combined with a land packer. Corn was planted at the end
    of April and beginning of May (Day of sowing: 26/04/2006, 26/04/2007, 07/05/2008)
    with a seeding rate of 9.5 kernels m−2 and a row distance of 0.75 m. Before sowing
    and after harvest, soil mineral nitrogen (Nmin) analysis was conducted at three
    depths (0–30 cm, 30–60 cm, 60–90 cm). The uniform nitrogen application was performed
    with a pneumatic fertilizer spreader (Rauch Aero 1112, Sinzheim, Germany). Pesticides
    were broadcast at relevant stages based on common agricultural practices. Maize
    was harvested by the end/mid of October each year. Grain yield was measured with
    a yield monitor implemented on a combine harvester. The Riech field is 10 ha and
    was divided into 80 site-specific management grids (0.125 ha). Further details
    on the field trial are given in Link et al. (2013). The soil of the experimental
    site was characterized as a heavy calcareous brown earth soil with high clay content.
    An overview of the texture categories of the 20 experimental grids is shown in
    Fig. 2, the soil texture triangle created after the USDA (2019). This data set
    was selected because it can demonstrate different characteristics for the features
    of the SPO. Fig. 2 Soil texture triangle determined in 20 grids (red dots) of
    the experimental site Riech after the soil classification of the USDA (2019) (Color
    figure online) Full size image The Riech field study reflects a monocropping system
    of maize over three years. For each year, the maize cultivar and the grid pattern
    did not change, and the crop management was uniform. The experimental data of
    the Riech field was available on a grid-specific level for 20 grids for the years
    2006, 2007, and 2008. Soil water balance and determination of hydraulic parameters
    in DSSAT-CSM Within DSSAT-CSM, daily soil water content is simulated to compute
    crop water stress, enabling yield prediction, crop management decision-making,
    risk analysis, strategic planning, and policy analysis (Boote, 2019). The soil
    water balance is estimated daily as a function of precipitation, irrigation, transpiration,
    soil evaporation, runoff, and drainage from the soil profile (Ritchie, 1998).
    The soil profile is divided into several computational layers, up to a maximum
    of 20. For simplification, a one-dimensional water flow is assumed using the tipping
    bucket approach developed by Ritchie (1985). The tipping bucket approach assumes
    that each soil layer can be filled with water up to the point of saturation (SAT)
    (Ritchie, 1985), defined as the maximum water content able to be held by the soil
    based on porosity (Godwin et al. 1984). If the volumetric water content reaches
    the point of saturation, the excess water drains into the next lower layer. The
    five hydraulic parameters: soil bulk density (BD), total porosity (TO), DUL, LL
    and SAT can be measured or estimated using a PTF, such as the functions developed
    by Saxton et al. (1986) and adapted by Gijsman et al. (2002). The plant available
    water per soil layer is determined as the difference between the drained upper
    limit (DUL) and the lower limit (LL) in each soil layer. The DUL is the amount
    of water soil holds against gravity, and LL is the extent to which roots can extract
    water from a particular soil type (Godwin et al. 1984). The LL refers to the wilting
    point and thus to water potentials of − 15 bar. DUL corresponds to the field water
    capacity concept and water potentials in − 0.1 to − 0.33 bar (Ritchie, 1985).
    The calculation of SAT considers that some pores include entrapped air at the
    saturation point. The percentage of entrapped air refers to the soil type and
    is set for 2–3% for clay soils and up to 7% for sandy soils (Dalgliesh & Foale,
    1998). The bulk density (BD) expresses the relationship between the bulk density
    of organic matter and the bulk density of mineral matter per soil volume unit.
    It can be calculated by the function developed by Adams (1973). Gijsman et al.
    (2007) classified soil data input requirements for a daily time-step into four
    groups: general data, apply to entire profile, first tier, and second tier. Parameters
    classified as available data and applied to the whole profile are used to calculate
    data of the first tier (e.g., LL, DUL, and SAT) and the second tier. Analog to
    the definition of van Looy et al. (2017) and Vereecken et al. (2016), the two
    groups of general data that apply to the entire profile correspond to the definition
    of “Predictor,” while the first and second tier corresponds to the purpose of
    “Estimands”. Regarding these definitions, the hydraulic parameters used in this
    study are considered Estimands. To derive the Estimands, a PTF is necessary. The
    PTF used in DSSAT-CSM is designed to be an efficient approach to enable the modelling
    of the whole moisture range of the potential soil water characteristic based on
    specific Predictor data. Therefore, the derived equation set estimates generalized
    soil-water characteristics from soil texture based on the statistical correlation
    between soil texture and hydraulic conductivity (Saxton et al. 1986). The general
    approach described in Eq. 1 is based on the study of Rawls et al. (1982). $${\\varTheta
    }_{p}=a+b\\left(\\%sand\\right)+c\\left(\\%silt\\right)+d\\left(\\%clay\\right)+e\\left(\\%organic
    matter\\right)+f\\left(bulk density,\\frac{mg}{{m}^{3}}\\right)$$ (1) The particle
    size distribution and the soil texture are defined by the USDA system (sand = 2.0–0.05
    mm, silt = 0.05−0.002 mm and clay < 0.002 mm) and grouped into 12 generic soil
    types (Gijsman et al. 2002). The regression coefficients a, b, c, d, e, and f
    are determined using a stepwise multiple linear regression (Rawls et al. 1982).
    The approach of Campbell (1974) in Eq. 2 describes the relationship between soil-water
    potential and water content. $${\\Psi }={\\text{A}{\\Theta }}^{\\text{B}}$$ (2)
    where Ψ is the soil water potential (kPa), Θ is the soil water content (m3/m3),
    coefficients A and B are fitted values. Rawls et al. (1982) demonstrated the significance
    of the soil texture factor clay. The Saxton approach unifies Eq. 1 and Eq. 2 to
    predict the soil water retention curve from particle size distribution (Saxton
    et al. 1986). The Saxton approach fits the data to the water retention curve by
    intercepting the curve into three parts and the corresponding three equations:
    (i) saturation to air entry constant, constant (ii) from air entry to 10 kPa linear,
    and (iii) from 10 to 1500 kPa curvilinear (Eqs. 3 and 4). $$A = \\exp \\left[
    { - 4.396 - 0.0715\\left( {\\% {\\text{clay}}} \\right) - 4.880 \\times 10^{{
    - 4}} } \\right)\\left( {\\% {\\text{sand}}} \\right)^{2} - 4.285~ \\times 10^{{
    - 5}} \\left( {\\% {\\text{sand}}} \\right)^{2} ~\\left( {\\% {\\text{clay}}}
    \\right)]100$$ (3) $$B = - 3.140 - 0.00222\\left( {\\% {\\text{clay}}} \\right)^{2}
    - 3.484 \\times 10^{{ - 5}} \\left( {\\% {\\text{sand}}} \\right)^{2} \\left(
    {\\% {\\text{clay}}} \\right)$$ (4) Saxton et al. (1986) derived Eqs. 3 and 4
    out of stepwise multiple nonlinear regression. The derived coefficients A and
    B are unified in Eq. 2 and represent the curvilinear part from 10 to 1500 kPa
    of the water retention curve. The curvilinear part covers a wide range of the
    water retention curve and enables the determination of the PAWC. Critical hydraulic
    parameters like DUL, LL and SAT are determined with equations unifying different
    approaches to meet the unique requirements of the DSSAT soil model. The soil profile
    optimizer (SPO) - a generic algorithm for soil profile calibration Inverse modelling
    is a mathematical approach used to estimate unknown parameters of a system based
    on observed data (Abbaspour et al. 2000). Models, or equations that describe the
    system’s behavior, are optimized to minimize error between simulated and observed
    data. Inverse modeling aims to determine the best set of parameters that can reproduce
    the observed data. The process of inverse modelling can be separated into several
    steps. First, the model that describes the system’s behavior is defined. Typically,
    the model includes parameters that need to be estimated or optimized. Next, selected
    parameters in the model are optimized by adjusting the values of the parameters
    chosen to minimize the error between simulated and observed data. This optimization
    technique uses a numerical optimization algorithm (Marquardt, 1963) to search
    for optimum parameter values. Determining soil hydraulic parameters by inverse
    modelling is widely used when model inputs are unknown and expensive to collect
    (Abbaspour et al. 2000; Kamali & Zand-Parsa, 2016; Salahou et al. 2022). The Soil
    Profile Optimizer (SPO) was developed as an external software plug-in for the
    current DSSAT-CSM v. 4.8 based on a generic algorithm written in Python with an
    intuitive interface. The SPO uses inverse modelling to minimize the value of an
    objective function (i.e., the error between simulated and observed values). In
    this study, the SPO was used to optimize seven soil profile parameters required
    in DSSAT (Table 1). Concerning the subdivision into Predictors and Estimands,
    optimizing parameters of the entire soil profile (Predictors) and layer-based
    parameters (Estimands) is possible. Thorp et al. (2008) developed a decision support
    system prototype called Apollo to analyze precision farming data sets using DSSAT
    version 3.5. Among other things, Apollo enabled the calibration of 10 soil-related
    parameters to simulate historical yield (Batchelor et al. (2004) Thorp et al.
    2008). Apollo is no longer supported or available. Table 1 compares the available
    soil model parameters in Apollo and the SPO. In Apollo, not all ten soil-related
    profile parameters were available for optimization. Based on the classification
    of the soil parameters as Predictors, the soil calibration conducted with Apollo
    relied on the entire soil profile parameters. The SPO enables optimizing soil
    profile parameters for the whole soil profile as a layer-based (e.g., SLLL throughout
    all defined soil layers). The approach in the SPO focused on the soil water balance
    throughout all defined soil layers. Besides the general importance of the PAWC
    in crop production, the SPO optimization approach aims to reduce the uncertainty
    present in the PTF approach while deriving specific water-holding capacity properties
    indirectly based on measurable aspects of plant growth. Therefore, the soil hydraulic
    parameters 6) SLLL and 7) SDUL in Table 1 were the focus of this study. The Saxton
    approach was developed using 5320 soil samples valid for the USA and calculated
    the hydraulic parameters LL and DUL using the soil properties of clay and sand
    (Saxton et al. 1986). Several studies reported the challenge of accurately applying
    PTFs outside their development areas (Patil & Singh, 2016; Wösten et al. 2001).
    Furthermore, Wösten et al. (2001) investigated the accuracy and reliability of
    PTFs and reported an RMSE for the volumetric water contents ranging from 0.02
    to 0.11 m3 m−3. Table 1 Comparison of soil model parameters, including the soil
    data requirements for a daily time step crop simulation that can be optimized
    with Apollo (Thorp et al. 2008) and the SPO (after Gijsman et al. 2007) Full size
    table Mechanism of the SPO The approach in the SPO was built on the error minimization
    between observed and simulated target variables by calibrating selected soil model
    parameters. The SPO can use time-series in-season observations of specific crop
    model output target variables such as GWAD (Grain weight), CWAD (tops weight),
    LWAD (leaf weight), SWAD (stem weight), and LAI (leaf area index), observable
    in the field to indirectly estimate soil related parameters that might be responsible
    for the given variability in observed biomass and grain yield. Depending on the
    number of target variables and in-season observations included in the optimization
    procedure, the algorithm uses the RMSE or nRMSE as the error minimization criteria.
    In the case of one target variable and one word per season, RMSE is chosen. If
    there are multiple target variables with multiple in-season observations, the
    algorithm relies on the nRMSE. The selection of the nRMSE as the primary error
    minimization method enables the soil profile parameter optimization using target
    variables with different unit scales, e.g., LAI (leaf area m2 per ground area
    m2), GWAD (kg ha−1), total above-ground biomass (CWAD) (kg ha−1) (Memic et al.
    2021). Using multiple in-season observations of multiple target variables was
    tested successfully for estimating crop model cultivar coefficients in a published
    Memic et al. (2021) study. A flow diagram of the soil profile optimization process
    is shown in Fig. 3. In step 1, representative parameters for the optimization
    process must be carefully considered based on theory, available measured data,
    and the study’s objective to avoid undesired autocorrelations of the optimized
    parameters (e.g., soil fertility and mineralization). In step 2, the DSSAT-CSM
    simulates crop yield based on a field-specific soil profile and evaluates it with
    the corresponding observed yield based on the error minimization method. In step
    3, the SPO calibrates the selected soil parameters through sensitivity analysis
    to attain a better statistical match between simulated and observed yield. The
    user defines the calibration range (min/max coefficient optimization range) of
    the selected soil parameters by the SPO. Still, it should be done based on theory
    and physical soil profile logic. In the final step, the recalibrated values of
    the selected soil parameters are used in the crop simulation for evaluation. In
    the case of a successful application of the SPO, the statistical correlation of
    simulated and measured yield is expected to increase. Fig. 3 Flow diagram of the
    soil profile optimization and simulation process with SPO Full size image Simplified
    application - an illustration of the SPO working flow The calibration process
    of the selected soil profile parameters is comparable to a sensitivity analysis
    conducted on RMSE and nRMSE calculated based on the difference between simulated
    and observed target variables. The idea of the optimization approach is illustrated
    in Fig. 4 based on an optimization example of the hydraulic parameter SLLL. To
    attain a better statistical fit, the value of SLLL is varied in defined min/max
    and increment steps of the selected coefficient for each layer to reduce the nRMSE
    between simulated and observed target variables while keeping already established
    SLLL and SDUL as primary references for the soil profile derived based on measured
    soil properties. Figure 4, the -y-axis shows soil layer depths in the defined
    soil profile, from 0 (surface) to 180 cm (0–15, 15–30, 30–60, etc.). Due to simulation
    accuracy, simulations of the first layer are divided into 0–15 cm and 15–30 cm,
    as the surface layers should be at most 20 cm by the recommendation of DSSAT users.
    The x-axis shows SLLL, SDUL, and SSAT values for all defined layer depths. The
    initial SLLL values (SLLL through all layers) are the baseline (red line with
    an arrow pointing) for creating seven different SLLL curve scenarios, shown in
    Fig. 4 as dotted lines. In the example shown in Fig. 4, additional SLLL scenarios
    are created by reducing the original SLLL value in increments of 10%, 20%, and
    30% (on the left side) of the initial SLLL line and by incrementing the initial
    SLLL line by 10%, 20%, and 30% (on the right side). Overall, the value setup in
    the SPO in Fig. 4 was ± 30 with increment steps of 10%, resulting in a total of
    seven SLLL curves, including the initial one. The crop model was executed for
    these seven SLLL scenarios, and the observed target variables (yield) were statistically
    analyzed. The scenario resulting in the lowest difference between simulated and
    observed yield was selected as “optimum”, which was the SLLL blue line scenario
    in this example. At the same time, SDUL and SSAT were kept constant (unchanged
    in the optimization process). Fig. 4 Illustration of the optimization procedure
    of the yield-based SLLL. Optimize from the original SLLL value (SLLL through all
    layers) to create seven scenarios, shown as dotted lines. The lowest difference
    between simulated and observed is selected as “optimum” which corresponds to the
    SLLL blue line in this example (Color figure online) Full size image To clarify
    the mechanism of the optimization procedure, Table 2 illustrates the curve line
    scenario of Fig. 4 and shows the numerical influence on the SLLL values for the
    first layer (depth 0–15 cm). Table 2 Numerical example of creating sensitivity
    analysis scenarios (1–7) for SLLL values of the first layer (depth 0–15 cm) by
    varying the coefficient in increment steps of 10% Full size table Introduction
    of the SPO In Fig. 5, the interface of the SPO is depicted by showing the eight
    simulation steps. Consistent with the previously discussed explanations, Fig.
    5 demonstrates the interface of the SPO by optimizing the SLLL targeting GWAD
    with the available Riechfield dataset. To run an optimization, the user has to
    go through the eight simulation steps. After the SPO windows runnable is executed
    (1st step), all crop models available in the DSSAT shell are offered by pressing
    “List crop models” (2nd step). Once the desired crop growth model is selected
    by choosing “Load FileX/s”, all the available experiment files will be loaded
    into the list widget window in step 3. In the 4th step, the available treatments
    (TRT/s) appear for selection. In this case study, the FileX treatments correspond
    to the site-specific units. After selecting the site-specific units (TRT/s) in
    step 4, the soil profiles related to these treatments are listed (5th step). The
    UHIRF05001 is the soil identifier for labeling the soil profile in SOIL.SOL file.
    In this scenario, the soil profile remains consistent across all three years and
    can be optimized using three years of crop model maize parametrization and weather
    data. This approach allows for exploring the seasonality factor in the specific
    characterization of the soil profile. In step 6, multiple target variables for
    the optimization are based on DSSAT PlantGro.OUT or other DSSAT time-series output
    file (if “other” checkbox is initialized) can be selected. In step 7 (%) reduction
    of available parameter values), specific soil profile coefficients to conduct
    the analysis can be initialized. The coefficient initialization uses a multiplier
    approach, where each multiplier setup is based on the coefficient minimum/maximum
    values and an incremental step. This approach generates multiple soil profile
    scenarios. Each multiplier corresponds to percentage values, as indicated before
    in Table 2. In the final stage (8th step), after completing the optimization run,
    the user can analyze his data by entering GBuild. Moreover, the possibility is
    given to create a coefficient-based scenario, as shown previously in Fig. 4, by
    activating the Fig generator. Fig. 5 Interface of the Soil Profile Optimizer with
    a current case study example Full size image Four scenarios ranging from field
    scale to site-specific simulations Soil sampling is labor-intensive and time-consuming.
    Soil sampling is often reduced to a minimum level, where few soil samples are
    taken randomly over a field and used for estimating field-scale soil properties.
    Therefore, taken samples are considered to be representative of a field-specific
    soil characteristic. This important implicit assumption needs to be considered
    because crop growth models were developed to simulate crop growth within homogeneous
    land units and are commonly used for evaluating the impact of management practices
    on yield at the field scale. In the case of a homogeneous field, the field-specific
    soil characterization is expected to lead to an accurate simulation of field-level
    yield. In cases of higher soil heterogeneity, field-scale soil profile data is
    not likely to capture measured spatial variability of yield caused by varying
    soil properties. Therefore, the number of soil samples has to be increased, and
    soil samples have to be taken on a site-specific (grid) level, leading to higher
    costs and higher costs and labor input. However, using the SPO approach for generating
    site-specific soil profiles attempts to overcome incorrect soil profile input
    information by deriving selected soil-related parameters from measured above-ground
    biomass data (e.g., yield, above-ground biomass, LAI, etc.). Combining soil profile
    optimization with the SPO using inverse modelling resulted in a new approach,
    Site-Specific Optimization (SSO). The approach relies on already published findings
    of Batchelor et al. (2002), Batchelor and Paz (1997), Braga and Jones (2004),
    Thorp et al. (2008), and Wu et al. (2019). To demonstrate the SSO’s properties
    and function as a functional modelling approach, simulations conducted with the
    SSO were compared with crop model simulations of three further approaches ranging
    from field-scale to site-specific level. The specific characteristics of each
    simulation approach are shown in Table 3. Generally, a standard model approach
    represents the simulation on a field-scale level (field-specific soil characterization
    and field-specific yield), designated as Yield Simulation (YS). The DSSAT input
    files for this approach (YS) were created as averages of measured site-specific
    data and defined as field-specific level in the input files. Two additional scales,
    the Field-Specific Simulation (FSS, field-specific soil characterization, and
    site-specific yield) and the Site-Specific Simulation (SSS, site-specific soil
    characterization, and site-specific yield), were conducted to simulate on a site-specific
    level by varying the resolution of soil input information. The level of soil information
    required is a function of the spatial scale, with field scale simulations requiring
    minor soil information and SSS requiring the most detailed information. The FSS
    was characterized by the simulation at the site-specific scale using soil profile
    information averaged at the field scale. This approach was created assuming adequate
    soil data for site-specific simulation is unavailable, but field-level information
    is available. Therefore, the same field-specific soil profile of the YS was taken
    as crop model input data for 20 targeted site-specific units. The simulations
    were then compared with the site-specific observed yield measurements. In the
    third scenario (SSS), all spatially measured soil data were used to create a grid-specific
    soil profile. Further simulations were executed with the grid-specific observed
    yield data. The SSO approach was defined as the medium information required for
    the simulation using FSS and SSS data. In this approach, selected soil input parameters
    at the field scale were calibrated at the grid scale using grid-level observed
    data yield. Table 3 Characterization of four different model approaches by varying
    the level of input data to simulate on field-scale (Yield Simulation (YS)) to
    site-specific level (2. Field-Specific Simulation (FSS), 2. Site-Specific Optimization
    (SSO), 3. Site-Specific-Simulation (SSS)). Full size table The general setup of
    the DSSAT input files was based on the simulation approach described in Table
    3. The inputs regarding the primary modules, weather, management, and plant, were
    the same for all simulation approaches. The cultivar coefficients were available
    from previous work (Memic et al. 2021), based on measured yield (end-of-season)
    and above-ground biomass observations (three in-season observations for tops weight).
    In that study, the Time Series Estimator (TSE) used the observed data of the 20
    grids for the experimental season 2006 for estimating cultivar coefficients. The
    seasons 2007 and 2008 were used for evaluation. An overview of the soil profiles
    used in the four simulation approaches is indicated in Fig. 6 by showing exemplary
    the soil profile of grid one as it was used in the several approaches. The soil
    profile used in the YS and the FSS was calculated as an average soil profile from
    the measured texture data of the 20 grids. In the SSS for each site-specific unit,
    a soil profile (n = 20) was created using measured soil data. For both approaches,
    an observational data file was created by adding all site-specific observations
    to each site-specific unit (n = 20) for each experimental year. Besides the soil
    information recorded in the soil input file, the initial soil conditions were
    captured in the experimental file. The values for the initial soil conditions
    were set for all three approaches to the measured initial conditions as reported
    in the SSS. The soil input data in the SSO approach was created for each site-specific
    unit (n = 20) by using the field-level soil profile parameters of the FSS and
    calibrating the parameters for each grid. The observational data file for the
    in-season observations was taken from the SSS. Fig. 6 Soil profile input files

    results The correlation-regression-based statistical method in this study is based
    on the coefficient of determination (R2). R2 is a statistical measure of how well
    data fits a regression line. The linear model, which correlates simulated and
    observed data, is shown in Eq. 5 (Willmott, 1981; Yang et al. 2014). $$y=\\alpha
    +\\beta x+\\epsilon$$ (5) R2 indicates the strength of the linear relationship:
    R2 = 1 indicates a perfect fit, while R2 = 0 indicates no linear relation. The
    R-squared statistic only captures linear associations and not variations in the
    fit relative to actual data (Willmott, 1981; Yang et al. 2014). To overcome the
    limitations of correlation-based statistics, efficiency measures have been developed
    to assess deviations (d = y - x) directly. A statistical index is the mean error
    (E) where i = 1,2…, n (Eq. 6) (Addiscott & Whitmore, 1987; Yang et al. 2014).
    $$E=\\sum ({y}_{i}-{x}_{i})/n$$ (6) The mean error indicates whether the model
    underestimates (E < 0) or overestimates (E > 0) the observed data. However, a
    drawback of E is that positive and negative errors can offset each other, resulting
    in E = 0 (Yang et al. 2014). New methods that rely on the sum of squares were
    introduced to handle this limitation. This study examines the use of root mean
    square error (RMSE) shown in Eq. (7) and the modeling efficiency (EF) shown in
    Eq. (8). $$RMSE= \\sqrt{\\sum {(y}_{i}-{{x}_{i} )}^{2}/n }$$ (7) The root mean
    square error (RMSE) is commonly used in model calibration and validation to measure
    the deviation (y–x) between predicted and observed values. Its unit of measure
    is the same as the deviation (Loague & Green, 1991). $$EF=1-\\sum {{(y}_{i}-{x}_{i})}^{2}/\\sum
    {{(x}_{i}-\\stackrel{-}{x})}^{2}$$ (8) EF ranges from − 1 to 1 and was introduced
    by Nash and Sutcliffe (1970) to evaluate river flow models. The metric of the
    EF is dimensionless. An EF = 1 indicates that the model’s output perfectly matches
    the observed data. If the EF < 1, it means that the simulation is realistic but
    not perfect. When the EF value is less < 0, it means that the model’s predictions
    are worse than just using the observed mean (x̄) instead of the modeled values
    (yi). Generally, an EF value greater than 0 is an essential criterion for determining
    the goodness of fit between the simulated and observed data. EF has been used
    widely in model evaluation and has been called by various names such as Nash-Sutcliffe
    Efficiency (NSE), coefficient of efficiency, and modeling efficiency (Loague &
    Green, 1991; Yang et al. 2014). Results Yield simulation (YS) on a field scale
    level In 2006, the field-specific observed grain yield of the Riech field was
    5549 kg ha−1; in 2007, 6824 kg ha−1; and in 2008, 5485 kg ha−1. The yield distribution
    was strongly affected by seasonality because of varying weather conditions and
    can be associated with temporal variability. The field-specific grain yield was
    simulated in the approach named YS. The results are shown in Fig. 7 as simulated
    vs. observed field-specific grain yield for the experimental years 2006, 2007,
    and 2008, with a corresponding R2 of 0.87. Simulated and observed GWAD with the
    corresponding RMSE is shown in Table 4. The smallest RMSE (201 kg ha−1) was observed
    in 2008. In 2006, the RMSE of simulated vs. observed GWAD was 649 kg ha−1 and
    757 kg ha−1 in 2007. The RMSE of the field-scale level simulation was approximately
    10% of the measured yield and thus within the usual acceptable range of model
    studies. Table 4 Results of the Yield Simulation (YS) Field-specific observed
    and simulated grain yield (GWAD) and RMSE for the Riech field (2006–2008) Full
    size table Fig. 7 Simulated vs. observed field-specific grain yield (kg ha−1)
    for the experimental years 2006–2008, based on the Yield Simulation (YS) Full
    size image Site-specific optimization (sso) over multiple years - comparison of
    the sso with different simulation approaches A comparison of the four simulation
    approaches is shown in Fig. 8 by illustrating the simulated vs. observed grain
    yield and the related R2 for the YS and the FSS (Fig. 8a), the SSS (Fig. 8b),
    and the SSO (Fig. 8c). In Fig. 8a, the simulation results of the FSS were illustrated
    together with the simulation results of the YS. The simulated grid-specific grain
    yield of the FSS resulted in the exact simulated yield for each grid and year.
    Comparing the simulated values of the FSS with the simulation results of the YS
    showed that the simulated data points can be assigned to the three simulated values
    of the YS. Therefore, the simulated values of the FSS reflect temporal variability
    for each experimental year (2006–2008), but merely the observed site-specific
    grain yield was depicted on the y-axis with all in-seasonal variability. The minor
    variations in the simulated yield (Fig. 8a, x-axis) were due to measured soil
    initial conditions included in the simulation procedure for all three years site-specifically.
    The RMSE calculated over three years and all 20 grids was approximately 25%. The
    FSS could not explain site-specific yield variability based on field-specific
    soil characterization, as indicated by the low R2 value of 0.03 and EF value of
    − 0.13. Figure 8b shows the results of the SSS by comparing the simulated site-specific
    yield (x-axis) with the site-specific measured yield (y-axis). The SSS, characterized
    by the simulation approach of simulating with site-specific created soil profiles
    based on measured soil texture values, led to an R2 of 0.02 and an EF of − 0.5.
    Besides the low R2, the SSS resulted in an overall RMSE over three years (2006–2008)
    and all 20 grids of around 30%. The SSS approach could not explain site-specific
    yield variability over three experimental seasons based on site-specific measured
    soil texture and pedo-transfer functions. The results of the SSO, based on 20
    site-specific soil profiles generated with the SPO by minimizing error in simulated
    and observed grain yield over three years (multiple years), are shown in Fig.
    8c. The simulation conducted with the site-specific optimized soil profiles resulted
    in an R2 of 0.76 and an EF of 0.75. Out of all the approaches tested, the SSO
    showed the best statistical fit compared to the FSS and SSS. In this crop model-based
    analysis, 76% of the site-specific yield variability (yield = dependent variable)
    was explained by targeted independent variables (soil profile parameters). The
    comparison of R2 of the three simulation approaches on a site-specific level showed
    that the SSO gave the best result (Fig. 8c). The SSO was conducted with the measured
    soil initial conditions taken from the SSS. Even higher correlations were achieved
    by running the SSO with varying initial soil conditions. Setting the initial soil
    conditions on averaged values led to an R2 of 0.81, while setting them to 0 resulted
    in an R2 of 0.79. Fig. 8 Comparison of four different simulation approaches by
    showing simulated vs. observed grain yield (kg ha−1) for the Field-Specific Simulation
    (FSS) combined with the Yield Simulation (YS) a the Site-Specific Simulation (SSS)
    b and the Site-Specific Optimization (SSO) conducted with the three selected soil
    profile parameters (SLRO, SLLL, SRGF) by targeting GWAD over three years c. All
    results are illustrated for 2006–2008 Full size image Comparison of the soil profile
    parameters in the optimization process The site-specific soil profile parameters
    are selected based on optimizing multiple choice parameters to establish the best-performing
    parameter combination to explain in-field yield variability. Since the experimental
    period was over three years, calibrating a maximum of three parameters was expected
    to deliver mathematically meaningful results. The influence of each soil profile
    input parameter available in the SPO was tested for the Riech field data set in
    three different optimization scenarios, and the results are shown in Table 5.
    The optimization setups are based on a multi-year approach. Therefore, the optimum
    was calculated for 20 grids over three years. The optimization range for the 1st
    optimization scenario was set to ± 10% of the original values. For the 2nd optimization
    scenario, the optimization range was ± 20%, and the 3rd ± 30% of the initial values.
    The optimization of SDUL looked promising and led to significant improvements
    in the first two optimization steps. However, the 3rd optimization step could
    not be conducted because the SDUL values exceeded the SAT values, which resulted
    in a model abort. For the optimization of SLLL, a relevant improvement was observed
    in the 2nd step. In the 3rd step, R2 increased to 0.39, while the RMSE also increased.
    Of all optimized soil profile parameters, the 2nd optimization step of the SLLL
    resulted in the lowest RMSE (1078 kg ha−1), which justified the selection for
    the optimum scenario. The optimization of the SLRO showed the highest statistical
    impact on optimizing soil profile parameters. Compared to all other soil profile
    parameters, R2 in the 2nd optimization step was already 0.44. The best result
    for the SLRO optimization was found for the optimization range from 60 to 100,
    leading to an R2 of 0.48. The SRGF showed the best statistical fit in the 3rd
    optimization step, which resulted in R2 of 0.35 and RMSE of 1201 kg ha−1. As the
    approach focused on optimizing the soil profile parameters related to the soil
    water balance, SLPF was not considered site-specific. Optimization of drainage
    rate (SLDR) and saturated hydraulic conductivity (SSKS) did not change for different
    scenarios and did not lead to relevant improvements (results not shown). Table
    5 Comparison of the R2 and the RMSE (kg ha-1) (RMSE calculated as mean over 20
    grids) between simulated and observed grain weight for three optimization scenarios
    for 20 grids over three years (2006–2008), by varying the optimizations ranges
    of selected soil profile parameter (varying degrees in 10% steps) Full size table
    Out of the analysis of the soil profile parameters shown in Table 5, SLLL (± 20%),
    SLRO (60–100), and SRGF (± 30%) were selected as relevant soil profile parameters
    for the optimum scenario. The defined optimum scenario was the same as the SSO
    scenario shown in Fig. 8, leading to an R2 of 0.76. Besides the numerical illustration
    in Table 5, the impact of optimizing a single soil profile parameter in the optimum
    scenario is illustrated in Fig. 9. Observed vs. simulated grain yield for 20 grids
    over three years for the optimization of one single soil parameter (SLLL (Fig.
    9b), SRGF (Fig. 9c), SLRO (Fig. 9d) were compared with the FSS (Fig. 9a) and the
    SSO (Fig. 9e). The optimization of SLLL, SRGF, and SLRO showed a similar pattern
    of outliers. By comparing the RMSE of each grid for the optimization with SLLL,
    SRGF, and the SLRO over the three experimental years, the same grids with an exceptionally
    high RMSE appeared (data not shown). However, the grids with high RMSE varied
    yearly, and no consistent pattern was observed. Overall, the combination of the
    three selected soil profile parameters in the SSO reduced the mean RMSE to 600
    kg ha−1. Fig. 9 Comparison of simulated vs. observed grain yield (kg ha−1) for

    of the soil optimization procedure on critical processes of the soil water balance
    Table 6 compares the simulated values of two simulation approaches, SSS and SSO,
    presenting the impact of the soil profile optimization on critical processes related
    to the soil water balance. The simulated values were calculated yearly as means
    over 20 grids. The values are presented in absolute numbers (mm), and in addition,
    the percentage change (%) of the SSO related to the SSS is provided (Table 6).
    Cumulative precipitation was calculated from sowing to harvest in 2006 as 425
    mm (181 simulated days), in 2007 as 386 mm (177 simulated days), and in 2008 as
    439 mm (169 simulated days). In all three years, water stress was detected (data
    not shown). Even though precipitation was lowest in 2007, the simulated water
    stress factors were higher in 2006 and 2008. To compare the evapotranspiration
    and their referring processes, soil evaporation, and transpiration between the
    simulation approaches SSS and SSO, the values were shown as cumulative values
    from the day of sowing until the day of harvest. The percentage change of the
    cumulative transpiration of the SSO showed an increase of 6% in 2006, 1% in 2008,
    and a decrease of 5% in 2007. The percentage change between SSS and SSO for the
    cumulative soil evaporation showed 17% (2006), 15% (2007), and 20% (2008) a consistent
    reduction. Overall, the SSO decreased cumulative evapotranspiration over all three
    years ( − 5% in 2006, − 1% in 2007,  − 8% in 2008). To show the effect of soil
    profile optimization on plant available water, the day of sowing and the day of
    harvest were picked. In the SSO approach, plant available water was at the day
    of sowing, under water-saturated conditions in all three years, consistently higher
    (2006, 11%, 2007 17%, and 2008 12%). At harvest day, the SSO resulted in 2006,
    respectively 2008 in a decrease of 16% and 6%, and an increase of 13% in 2007.
    Moreover, the extractable water was 106 mm (SSS) and 120 mm (SSO), the lowest
    in 2007, when cumulative precipitation was also observed. In conclusion, the impact
    of the soil profile optimization on the selected processes was higher on directly
    linked soil water processes like soil evaporation and plant available water. It
    can be assumed that the consistent decrease of evapotranspiration in the SSO is
    due to reduced soil evaporation. Comparing soil available water on the day of
    harvest with the transpiration indicated similar trends. The higher cumulative
    transpiration in 2006 and 2008 of the SSO leads to the assumption that the plant
    water uptake in this approach was higher and could explain why the extractable
    water at harvest day was lower. In 2007, a reversed trend was observed. Table

    (SSO) related to the Site-Specific Simulation (SSS)) for the processes evapotranspiration,
    transpiration, soil evaporation, extractable water for the years 2006, 2007 and
    2008 Full size table Discussion The simulation approaches conducted in this study
    demonstrated the challenges of site-specific crop modelling. The YS scenario showed
    an accurate model performance at the field scale level with an R2 of 0.87 and
    RMSE of approximately 500 kg ha−1. Compared to YS, FSS, and the SSS conducted
    at the site-specific level could have led to an adequate simulation result. FSS
    showed that a general soil profile (field-specific) did not sufficiently explain
    yield variability on a site-specific level. Only slight variations due to varying
    initial conditions stored in the experimental file were captured in the simulated
    values; several studies reported that precise soil input data is needed for a
    successful simulation on a site-specific level (Batchelor et al. 2002; Braga &
    Jones, 2004). However, additional site-specific soil input data does not automatically
    lead to an acceptable simulation result, as shown in the SSS conducted for the
    Riech field data. Even though soil input data was available on the site-specific
    level, the SSS in this study only gave an R2 of 0.02, an EF of − 0.51, and an
    RMSE of 1800 kg ha−1. Based on the assumption of Maestrini and Basso (2018) that
    spatial variability is caused by soil variability, an explanation could be found
    in the underlying structure of the DSSAT crop model. Initially, the DSSAT model
    was designed to simulate yield on an area basis (field scale level) under the
    assumption of land unit homogeneity. Model parameters must be downscaled to simulate
    yield on a site-specific level, as Pasquel et al. (2022) reported. Only limited
    research has yet to be done to develop downscaling methods. However, these methods
    are crucial in determining the size of meaningful site-specific units, especially
    from the perspective of crop modelling. Link et al. (2006) indicated that at a
    certain resolution of the grid size, no further model improvement could be reached
    because the simulations cannot address the temporal variability across seasons.
    Conversely, larger grids could describe temporal variability but not spatial yield
    variability. The current application of the DSSAT model on a site-specific level
    points to the challenge of using a one-dimensional soil characterization in a
    PA approach (Sadler et al. 2000). The functionality of the one-dimensional soil
    model in DSSAT inherently considers only horizontal processes (Ritchie, 1998).
    Sadler et al. (2000) reported in their study that possible interactions of horizontal
    water transfer via runoff or flow are rarely considered. For the SSS with the
    Riech field data set, it can be assumed that the measured soil samples needed
    to be more appropriate, and more data is required to generate suitable soil profiles.
    Batchelor et al. (2004); Thorp et al. (2008) reported that a systematic soil profile
    optimization tool for site-specific modelling with the DSSAT model is needed.
    However, the last version of the Apollo Decision Support System (DSS) was available
    for DSSAT 3.5. Due to model changes, some of the optimization parameters in Apollo
    are unavailable in the current DSSAT version. As a new systematic approach, the
    SPO was designed for the current DSSAT version 4.8 based on a generic soil profile
    structure and can be used with future versions of DSSAT. The SPO calibrated for
    SLLL, SLRO, and SRGF of grid-level soil profiles by targeting the grain weight
    on a site-specific level gave an R2 of 0.76, an EF of 0.75, and a mean RMSE of
    600 kg ha−1 for the Riech field data. Statistical analysis is a crucial component
    in calibrating and evaluating crop growth models. It helps to ensure the accuracy
    and reliability of the models, as discussed in Yang et al. (2014). To conduct
    a representative statistical conclusion, several statistics are needed. The SPO
    is primarily based on the nRMSE minimization method due to the advantage of optimizing
    specific parameters based on multiple target variables with different units. In
    this study, the R2 and RMSE were primarily utilized for model evaluation. The
    EF was calculated for the solutions obtained by the SPO as an additional statistical
    evaluation of the optimized model performance. Dimensionless statistics such as
    EF are widely used in model evaluation and can potentially increase the SPO’s
    accuracy. Due to the goal of this study, only soil profile parameters with an
    influence on the PAWC are considered. The PAWC, a main driver of yield variability
    in maize production, is driven by the hydraulic parameters calculated with the
    PTF. As shown in Sect. 2.2, the calculation of the PAWC in the DSSAT model is
    driven by SDUL and SLLL, determined in the approach of Saxton et al. (1986). Several
    studies reported the challenges of using PTFs in modelling, reported difficulties
    in their application, and recommended optimization (Gijsman et al. 2002; Patil
    & Singh, 2016; van Looy et al. 2017). Therefore, this study focused on the optimization
    of SDUL and SLLL. Due to model abortions during the optimization of SDUL, especially
    in optimization scenarios of higher ranges, SDUL was rejected for the optimization
    procedure. Compared to the SDUL, the SLLL showed higher robustness in the optimization
    procedure. However, Wu et al. (2019) reported similar effects on SDUL and SLLL
    simulation results in their optimization approach. Moreover, errors in the estimation
    of SLLL have a more significant impact on the simulation because the SLLL applies
    to much smaller values than the DUL (Gijsman et al. 2002). Patil and Singh (2016)
    reported a general RMSE of PTFs to predict soil water retention from 0.007 to
    0.07 m3 m−3. The selected optimization range of 20% for the optimum scenario of
    the SLLL is in an acceptable range. Ritchie (1998) pointed out that the approach
    to calculating the infiltration in DSSAT, the curve number method, needs to be
    revised. Similar results were reported by Sadler et al. (2000). Due to the assumption
    that the approach of the curve number method and the one-dimensional model setup
    lead to model inaccuracy, the SLRO 60–100 optimization range is appropriate. It
    can be assumed that the optimization of SLLL influences the PAWC and SLRO in the
    daily simulated water content. Usually, optimizing hydraulic parameters is coupled
    with calibrating the root growth parameter (Thorp et al. 2008; Wu et al. 2019).
    Overall, the selected parameters led to good results, and the influences were
    similar to those reported by Wu et al. (2019). The comparison of simulation results
    between SSS and SSO for evapotranspiration, transpiration, soil evaporation, and
    extractable water showed the optimization procedure’s impact on these general
    processes. Boote et al. (2008) reported the importance of adequately estimating
    the soil water-holding parameters and root growth to receive a satisfactory tipping
    bucket soil water balance model output. The role of a precise soil water balance
    on crop water stress signals is described. Depending on the simulated water stress
    factor, the model alters crop assimilation, expansive growth processes, and most
    crop phenological progressions (Boote 2008). These findings showed the dimension
    of the conducted SSO, and it can be assumed that through this optimization also,
    growth processes were modified. Precise yield predictions in site-specific modelling
    are essential for site-specific crop management. Only accurate model input parameters
    can lead to model simulations, which can be further used for model testing to
    determine agronomic and economic outcomes of specific management practices (Braga
    & Jones, 2004). Based on the findings of this study, a tactical approach for a
    variable rate input application in crop production for farmers can be set up (Maestrini
    & Basso, 2018). As Memic et al. (2019) indicated, using crop models as a decision
    support tool for site-specific N application rates also needs to capture soil
    parameters, representing the spatial and temporal variability. Conclusion The
    need for crop models in PA as a tool to develop risk management is undisputed.
    However, model simulations depend on the quality of input data. In general, soil
    sampling is time-consuming, labor-intensive, and depending on the level of field
    heterogeneity, often inappropriate for site-specific management. An inverse modelling
    approach was developed and built on the assumption that yield patterns can lead
    to insights into given variability of soil properties. The SPO software developed
    in this study can be used as an external plug-in program for the current DSSAT
    version 4.8. The case study for a 3-year field trial with maize showed the possibility
    of calibrating soil profile parameters from a general soil profile. A strong influence
    of soil profile parameters affecting PAWC was shown. The SPO as an external plug-in
    program for the DSSAT model led to promising results for the current data set
    and improved final yield simulations. Overall, the SPO could be a valuable methodology
    for a generic optimization of soil profiles for the DSSAT model. However, further
    testing and verification need to be conducted with independent data sets. Furthermore,
    combining the SPO with site-specific fertilizer optimization would be an envisioned
    additional step. References Abbaspour, K., Kasteel, R., & Schulin, R. (2000).

  journal: Precision Agriculture
  limitations: The study only considers three soil profile parameters for optimization,
    as the experimental period was over three years. The study did not evaluate the
    impact of optimizing additional soil profile parameters or the effect of using
    different optimization algorithms. The study did not evaluate the transferability
    of the optimized soil profile parameters to other sites or years.
  main_objective: To demonstrate the application of the Soil Profile Optimizer (SPO)
    for site-specific crop modeling by calibrating selected soil profile parameters
    to simulate grain weight in a 3-year maize field trial.
  relevance_evaluation: The paper's relevance to the specific point you are making
    in your literature review is high. The paper provides a detailed description of
    a new software tool, the Soil Profile Optimizer (SPO), which can be used to optimize
    soil profile parameters for site-specific crop modeling. This tool has the potential
    to improve the accuracy of crop simulations in site-specific management applications.
    This is because the SPO can be used to calibrate soil profile parameters to match
    observed yield data, which can lead to more accurate simulations of crop growth
    and yield. The paper also provides a case study demonstrating the application
    of the SPO for site-specific crop modeling in a 3-year maize field trial. The
    results of the case study show that the SPO can significantly improve the accuracy
    of crop simulations, as indicated by an increase in R2 from 0.03 to 0.76 and a
    decrease in RMSE from 1800 kg ha-1 to 600 kg ha-1. Overall, the paper provides
    strong evidence to support the claim that the SPO can be used to improve the accuracy
    of crop simulations in site-specific management applications.

  description: Precision agriculture is about applying solutions that serve to obtain
    a high yield from the optimization of resources and the development of technologies
    based on the collection and use of precise data. Precision agriculture, including
    camera-guided row detection and hydraulic steering, is often used as an alternative
    because crop damage can be decreased and driving speed can be increased, comparable
    to herbicide applications. The effects of different approaches, such as uncontrolled
    (UC), mechanical weed control (MWC), herbicide weed control (HWC), and mechanical
    + herbicide control (MWC + HWC), on weed density and yield of sugar beet were
    tested and evaluated in two trials (2021 and 2022) in South Transylvania Depression
    at the tested intervals BBCH 19 and 31. Weed control efficacy (WCE) depends on
    the emergence of the weeds and a good timing of weed controls in all the trials
    and methods, though the highest yield of sugar beet roots was recorded in the
    treatment MWC + HWC, with an increase up to 12–15% (56.48 t ha−1) yield from HWC
    (50.22 t ha−1) and a yield increase of more than 35–40% than MWC (42.34 t ha−1).
    Our trials show that it is possible to increase yield and have fewer chemical
    applications with the introduction of new precision technologies in agriculture,
    including sensor-guided mechanical controls.

    Review Reports Versions Notes Abstract Precision agriculture is about applying
    solutions that serve to obtain a high yield from the optimization of resources
    and the development of technologies based on the collection and use of precise
    data. Precision agriculture, including camera-guided row detection and hydraulic
    steering, is often used as an alternative because crop damage can be decreased
    and driving speed can be increased, comparable to herbicide applications. The
    effects of different approaches, such as uncontrolled (UC), mechanical weed control
    (MWC), herbicide weed control (HWC), and mechanical + herbicide control (MWC +
    HWC), on weed density and yield of sugar beet were tested and evaluated in two
    trials (2021 and 2022) in South Transylvania Depression at the tested intervals
    BBCH 19 and 31. Weed control efficacy (WCE) depends on the emergence of the weeds
    and a good timing of weed controls in all the trials and methods, though the highest

    farming; beta vulgaris 1. Introduction Weeds left in sugar beet (Beta vulgaris
    L.) cause problems during harvesting the beet roots for sugar production, decrease
    yield, and increase weed populations in future crops due to the mature weed seeds
    or rhizomes left in the soil [1]. Therefore, an Integrated Weed Management (IWM)
    strategy is very important, and practices need to be applied in sugar beet cultivation
    and in programs of pesticide reduction and environmental protection [2,3], such
    as the European Green Deal. Economic, ecological, and social factors characterize
    modern and sustainable sugar beet production [4]. In this context, field cropping
    strategies should consider environmental aims while ensuring fair profits for
    farmers and the associated agricultural industry [5]. At the same time, after
    the elaboration of management factors such as pesticides, high-yielding and pest-tolerant
    cultivars, irrigation systems, and different synthetic fertilizers, the food quality
    must also be guaranteed [6]. The interaction of integrated methods of crop protection
    is mandatory for prospective and sustainable food production [7]. The European
    Union directives encourage farmers to meet stricter standards concerning pest
    management, and solutions are needed in this direction [8]. This leads to restrictions
    on herbicide applications and promotes the reduction of the total amounts of herbicides
    applied. The European Commission favors a reduced input of pesticides in the agricultural
    supply chain [9]. Chemical weed control still plays an important role in the weed
    management strategy in sugar beet [10]. Therefore, effective weed management is
    crucial. Chemical weed control has currently evolved into a required and unavoidable
    component of weed management in sugar beet production [11]. The most important
    herbicide mixtures contain the following active ingredients: metamitron, phenmedipham,
    and ethofumesate. Before being withdrawn from use in the European Union, the mixtures
    also included desmedipham [12]. For sugar beet, the common weed control practice
    is the implementation of 3–5 postemergence herbicide applications in the cotyledoneous
    stage of the weeds [13]. Nevertheless, high environmental risks and crop damage
    may be the consequences of the herbicide application [14]. A part of IWM is mechanical
    weed control, with new perspectives today [15,16]. The implementation of mechanical
    weed control tools in sugar beet production can substitute herbicide treatments
    and therefore reduce the amount of different herbicides in the environment [17,18,19].
    Due to the slow driving speeds and limited working width of the implements, labor
    efficiency is relatively low compared to chemical weed control [11]. Even more,
    hoeing in the intra-row area and operating as closely as possible to the crop
    area are the requirements for a successful mechanical weed control management
    strategy [20]. The use of precision agriculture (PA) is an expedient way of steering
    the hoe close to the crop row and offers new research perspectives. Gerhards et
    al., 2021 [20] showed that 3 m camera-guided hoeing in cereals was possible with
    only a lateral offset of 19 mm from the crop row. Furthermore, driving speed could
    be increased up to 8 km h−1 with a weed control efficacy of nearly 80% and no
    crop losses [21]. The use of PA in agriculture is gaining more and more importance
    due to the commercialization of new developments like the Global Positioning System
    (GPS) [22,23,24]. The operation with PA can reduce labor costs and is able to
    increase the speed of the applications [25]. The use of Global Navigation Satellite
    System (GNSS) technologies or digital image progression is needed for accurate
    guidance [26,27]. Guidance systems within the field identify the position of the
    crop rows, and a hydraulic side shift system steers the hoe close to the crop
    area (5 cm on each side) and provides higher driving speeds by reducing the farmer’s
    work time [28,29,30,31]. Weed control in sugar beet cultivation is increasingly
    difficult because the physiological stage of the crop is small and strict, and
    technical rules are imposed with low and precisely fractionated doses [1,32].
    Thus, it is interesting to investigate the differences between chemical and mechanical
    controls on weeds in the sugar beet crop [18,33]. Mechanical weed control in agriculture
    has advanced in terms of precision and working rate over recent years [34]. The
    real-time communication of implements with sensor systems further increased the
    potential of mechanical weeding [35]. There is a wide array of available sensors,
    including image analysis using cameras, the GNSS, lasers, and ultrasonic systems,
    that can improve weed control efficacy in combination with mechanical systems
    [36,37]. Every sensor type has its advantages and disadvantages [38]. Camera-steered
    hoes with a hydraulic side shifting control for row crops are robust and reliable,
    and they are now widely available from different manufacturers [33]. The advantages
    as we anticipate during the experiment is that in the region of study the farmers
    cultivate sugar beet on 100–200 ha maximum in the culture rotation at a normal
    farm of 1000 ha arable land, so the hoeing can be undertaken easily in a couple
    of days because of the high speed advantage from the row guard steering and the
    recognition of the sugar beet row, and the crop damage is very low. Therefore,
    the objectives of this study were to combine chemical (pre- and post-emergence
    herbicides) and sensor-based mechanical treatments (sensor-guided hoeing) to evaluate
    these combinations to reduce the amount of herbicide use while maintaining high
    yield, equal weed control, and adequate crop selectivity. The hypotheses of this
    study were as follows: (i) reduce the chemical treatments (pre-emergence and post-emergence
    herbicides) and reduce the stress of the plant; (ii) increase weed control efficacy
    up to 98%, including precision technologies, and maximize the yield up to 60 t
    ha−1 due to mechanical weed control included in the conditions and weed abundance
    from the South Transylvanian Depression, Romania. 2. Materials and Methods 2.1.
    Experimental Site and Design This study investigated sugar beet during the years
    2021–2022, in the hilly Depression of Transylvania. This depression relief unit
    inside the Carpathian arc has a predominantly hilly relief, and the representative
    agricultural crops are cereals and technical plants, especially sugar beet. The
    experiments were located at the conventional farm fields “Vințana SA” in the village
    of Vințu de Jos (45.99° N, 23.48° E), country Alba. The field trials are in the
    intra-Carpathian chain of mountains and at the plateau of the river Mureș, which
    has a good environment for agriculture and sugar beet cultivation, at an elevation
    of 284 m above sea level and an average rainfall of 520–550 mm annual−1. The precipitations
    that are relevant for our climate and included in the zone of study can be found
    in Table 1 from spring and summer. The precipitation recorded during the sugar
    beet vegetation period was 281.67 mm for the year 2021 and 268.17 mm for the year
    2022. The multiannual average temperature is, in general, between 8 and 9 °C.
    During the experimentation period, the annual temperature was 9.1 °C in 2021 and
    9.0 °C in 2022, respectively. Table 1. Precipitations in mm for the months of
    March until September in the years 2021 and 2022 for the location Vințu de Jos.
    The type of soil in the experimental field is Fluviosol, which is one of the most
    fertile in the area, easily mechanized, and usually completely arable. The soil
    texture was classified as loam soil with a balanced percentage of clay, dust,
    and sand, a weak acidic pH of around 6.3, and a humus content of around 2%. Tillage
    before sowing was identical across all experimental variants. First, the soil
    was ploughed in autumn at a 25–30 cm depth with Kuhn Huard plough MM 150 with
    4 corps (Saverne, France), followed by a seedbed preparation in early March with
    a Horsch Finer 7 SL combinator (Ronneburg, Germany), both performed with the tractor
    New Holland T7.190 (New Holland, PA, USA). Sugar beets were sown in the middle
    of March at conventional densities of 110,000 seeds ha−1, at a depth of 4–5 cm
    and a row distance of 45 cm; the distance between plants within a row was 18 cm
    in all experimental variants. The experiment was set up as a polyfactorial randomized
    complete block design with four repetitions and three treatments. The plot size
    in all trials was 3 × 24 m2, with the longer side of the plots in the sowing direction
    of the crop. The experimental variants were represented by the following treatments:
    V1: Untreated control (UC); V2: Conventional herbicide application (HWC); V3:
    Mixture of 2× hoeing plus 3× chemical weed control method (HWC + MWC). The treatment
    descriptions can be found in Table 2. Table 2. Detailed description of the variants
    at Vințana farm in 2021 and 2022. The UC variant was left untreated for the entire
    growing season. However, it was ensured that the UC also received the same number
    of passes with the tractor wheels as the mechanical and herbicide treatments.
    The hoeing system of the experiment had one camera to recognize 3 rows from the
    experiment field of the sugar beet rows and a hydraulic side shift system (Figure
    1). Hoeing was performed parallel to the crop rows with a driving speed of 8 km
    h−1. Hoeing the sugar beet row was performed with two goosefeet sweeps (20 cm),
    two side-knives, and two protection disks. Figure 2 shows an image 2 plots wide,
    with a total of six sugar beet rows; the picture was from the manufacturer Einbock,
    Austria. Figure 1. Camera sensor-based row hoeing using Chopstar. Figure 2. The
    set-up for the hoe used in the experiments at Vințana farm in 2021–2022. 2.2.
    Implementation of the Herbicide Treatments The herbicide application in both years
    was carried out with a mounted sprayer, the Amazone UF2002, from the company Amazone
    Hasbergen Dreyer GmbH & Co from Hasbergen, Germany, equipped with Lechler IDN
    120–025 nozzles from the company Lecher GmbH from Metzingen, Germany, at a pressure
    of 8 bar and a speed of up to 8 to 10 km h−1. Due to the high weed density in
    Transylvania Depression and the slow emergence of the crop until row closure,
    up to 60 days, a minimum of three herbicide mix sprayings must be applied over
    the whole field post-emergence with the low dosage technique for the broad leaf
    weeds (Table 3). Also, it is common for farmers to spray pre-emergence herbicides
    on sugar beet with a mix of three herbicides. The weed control experiment conducted
    in sugar beet in the year 2021 involved chemical spraying the whole field 6 times,
    including the substances glyphosate and metamitron pre-emergence, and in 2022,
    we reduced two chemical pre-emergence herbicides and left only 4 sprayings as
    post-emergence control only. Table 3. Application time (BBCH of the sugar beet),
    active ingredients, and herbicide product at both experimental fields in 2021
    and 2022. 2.3. Description of the Camera-Based Row-Detection System Used in the
    Chopstar, Einböck Images were taken continuously by a 2D RGB camera, scanning
    diagonally forward on 4 rows of sugar beets (Figure 3). The camera was mounted
    on a separate bracket at a height of 1,8 m on the left side of the hoe. The camera
    setting could be adjusted to suit the color or height of the crop. We could choose
    between green/yellow (e.g., corn), green/blue (e.g., soybeans and vegetables),
    or red (vegetables, e.g., beetroot) in 2D mode. The 3D mode can be used for corn,
    soybeans, sunflowers, etc., if the plant rows have a clear growth advance (approx.
    10 cm/3.90″) over the weed. Correct adjustment to the crop further increases the
    accuracy of row guidance (Figure 4). Figure 3. The software recognizes the plant
    rows even in cases of heavy weed infestations and/or small plants. The settings
    can be adjusted depending on the conditions (Einbock GmbH, Schatzdorf, Austria).
    Figure 4. Adaptation of the camera application to the culture. If there is too
    much weed pressure and crop leaves overlap with weed leaves and the crop line
    cannot be recognized clearly anymore, there is an additional 3D mode. The camera
    automatically recognizes the height of the plants and allows for differences between
    the row structure of the high crops and the small weeds. This guarantees fast
    row detection even if the crop leaves partly overlap in the inter-row area. The
    camera provides robust row detection under most lightning conditions. External
    artificial light improves the quality of row detection. The automatic camera steering
    can be conveniently set from the tractor via an operating terminal. With the help
    of different setting parameters adapted to the crop (row spacing, number of rows
    in the camera’s field of view, and plant width and height), an appropriate grid
    is laid over the image. Based on this data, the hoe is centered exactly along
    the row with the help of the side-shift frame. This ensures a narrow hoeing belt,
    which guarantees maximum weed control. 2.4. Implementation of the Mechanical Treatments
    Hoeing was performed with the 3 m wide camera-guided hoeing system Chopstar from
    Einböck Gmbh, Schatzdorf 7, 4751 Dorf an der Pram, Austria. Camera-based row detection
    was implemented in a real-time system for automatic guidance of the goosefoot
    sweeps in the inter-row at a distance of 50 mm from the crop rows. Since only
    one model of goosefoot swipes existed, two passes with the tractor New Holland
    (Figure 5) were necessary to treat two sugar beet rows in each plot that had mechanical
    weed control with the hoe. So, it was performed on the two different plots, MWC
    and HWC + MWC, with the goosefoot swipes twice after the chemical treatments,
    in the two different stages of the sugar beet growth, the six-leaf stage and the
    nine-leaf stage, meaning the two different BBCHs, 19 and 31. The set-up of the
    mechanical sensor hoe was made on the farm adjusted to the culture of the sugar
    beet, meaning the width between the rows aligned with the width of the tillage
    controlling wheels. Figure 5. The New Holland tractor used and the sensor-based
    hoe Chopstar from Einbock. Since each plot comprised six sugar beet rows, seven
    implements were required to control all inter-row spaces of one 3 m plot. The
    safety distance towards the sugar beet rows was set up to a 5 cm wide range. For
    intra-row control of the weeds, the finger weeders were set up above the ground,
    and the protection shield elements were left on the soil to prevent sugar beet
    crop damage. 2.5. Data Acquisition Weed density (weeds m−2) and weed species were
    measured using a 0.5 m × 0.5 m frame (Figure 6). The frame was placed in a random
    way three times per plot, three days after the application of the mechanical treatments
    and after 14 days of chemical treatments, as well as after three days on the uncontrolled
    plot. Sugar beet harvest (t ha−1) took place in the middle of September or at
    the start of October in both trial years, depending on the sugar content and the
    weather conditions, particularly from each other every year in agriculture. The
    harvest of the sugar beet was performed with a plot combine harvester Agrifac,
    Kleine tip K62, Netherlands, and after that, washing and weight measurement were
    performed at the farm. Figure 6. The frame (0.5 × 0.5 m2) used for the measurement
    of the weed density (a) and the effect on the sugar beet crop after the hoeing
    (b). 2.6. Data Analysis The data were analyzed with the statistical software Anova
    Polifact Soft (ANOVA 2020, Cluj Napoca, Romania) [39]. Prior to analysis, the
    data were tested for homogeneity of variance and normal distribution. An analysis
    of variance was performed. The results of the trials were compared by the Duncan
    test at p = 0.05. The weed control efficacy (WCE) in % was calculated with the
    weed density for each plot and for two different growth stages of BBCH, according
    to Rasmussen [40]: WCE% = 100 − dt/(0.01 × du) where dt is the weed density (weeds
    m−2) after application of the treatments, and du is the weed density (weeds m−2)
    in the untreated control plots. 3. Results 3.1. The Five Most Abundant Weed Species
    at Each Trial Site Average weed densities for BBCH 19 at treatment time ranged
    from 12 plants m−2 to 49 plants m−2 in sugar beet. For BBCH 31, the average weed
    densities at treatment time ranged from 8 plants m−2 to 24 plants m−2. The most
    abundant weed species, with their dominance, are listed in Table 4. Table 4. The
    five most abundant species of weeds in both trial years 2021–2022 (average of
    each species participation). Chamomile (29%, Matricaria chamomilla L.), the perennial
    creeping thistle (21%, Cirsium arvense L.), lamb’s quarters (19%, Chenopodium
    album L.), cocklebur (15%, Xanthium italicum L.), and green foxtail (12%, Setaria
    viridis (L.) P. Beauv.) were most abundant in 2021. Common knotgrass (23%, Polygonum
    aviculare L.), cleavers (21%, Galium aparine L.), shepherd’s purse (18%, Capsella
    bursa-pastoris L.), cockspur grass (16%, Echinochloa crus-galli), and birdeye
    speedwell (12%, Veronica persica L.) occurred in 2022. Both of the trial years
    were different concerning the emergence of the weeds and the precipiation date
    of arrival in the field after the seeding of the sugar beet, but we can see in
    Figure 7 the composition of the weed species, concluding the groups for dictoyledonates
    and monocotyledonates in the area of the experiment. Figure 7. Composition groups
    of the weed species (%) in two different years, 2021 (a) and 2022 (b). MA—annual
    monocotyledonates; DA—annual dicotyledonates; DP—perennial dicotyledonates; MP—perenial
    monocotyledonates. 3.2. Weed Control Efficacy in 2021 In the year 2021, the weed
    control efficacy was up to 97.3–100% until the crop rows were closed (up to 60
    days after crop emerge) for the 2021 chemical control, as shown in Figure 8. Figure
    8. Chemical weed control efficacy in 2021, depending on the experimental variants.
    3.3. Weed Control Efficacy in 2022 The highest WCE for the first weed control
    pass at BBCH 19 could be achieved in the MWC + HWC treatment with 75.20%, followed
    by the pure herbicide control HWC with 56.37% WCE (Table 5 and Figure 9). Figure
    9. Bar chart of WCE for both stages in 2022. Table 5. The results obtained for
    the mean weed density (plant m−2) at BBCH 19 at 14 days after the first application
    of each treatment in 2022. Weed control efficacy was undertaken in 2022 at BBCH
    31 with three repetitions in all experimental variants like control (UC), mechanical
    only weed control (MWC), herbicide only weed control (HWC), and mechanical + herbicide
    weed control (MWC + HWC) (Table 6). Table 6. Results obtained for the mean weed
    density (plants m−2) at BBCH 31 at 14 days after the final application of each
    treatment in 2022. The hoeing treatment MWC performed only 36.93% WCE (Table 5).
    The MWC treatment achieved the significantly lowest weed control in total. For
    the second application time, MWC + HWC could again achieve the significantly highest
    WCE of 82.55%, followed by the pure mechanical treatment MWC with 78.52% WCE.
    The conventional herbicide application HWC could only achieve 51.68% WCE but did
    not differ from the MWC treatment. 3.4. Sugar Beet Yield The maximum production
    of sugar beet in 2021 was 48.57 t ha−1, against the background of a dry summer,
    and it is almost 10 tons higher in 2022 (56.48 t ha−1), against the background
    of a better distribution of precipitation. In 2021, no crop losses were recorded,
    and in the second year, the crop losses were up to 2% due to the sensor-based
    mechanical control. In 2022, combined treatment of mechanical and herbicide weed
    control methods (HWC + MWC) showed a significant increase in sugar beet yield
    of nearly 28.36 t ha−1 compared to the UC (28.12 t ha−1) (Table 7). Followed by
    HWC with 50.22 t ha−1 and MWC with 42.34 t ha−1. There was a significant difference
    between UC and MWC and between MWC and HWC and HWC + MWC. Table 7. Yield in sugar
    beet from Vințu de Jos, years 2021–2022. Sugar beet yield can be increased by
    introducing sensor-based mechanical control with hoes in Transylvanian Depression
    up to 56.48 t ha−1 for a performant farm, in the conditions proper to the usage
    of the hoeing at the period of BBCH 19 and 31 of sugar beet, and with good quantities
    of water in the soil in the spring and mid-summer. At present, the yield is at
    the level of 34.20 to 40.61 t ha−1 (Table 8) in almost all the farms with the
    chemical control. Table 8. Yield of sugar beet crop from Romania. Analyzing the
    yield results from the experiment and comparing them with the medium yields at
    country level from the period 2015–2020 [41], we can say that except for the UC
    trial, in all other trials the yields are above average for the country. The yield
    from HWC and HWC + MWC trials is higher than the highest medium yield from Romania.
    4. Discussion Weed management by using novel hoeing devices ensures profitable
    yields and an acceptable residual weed infestation. Post-emergent hoeing with
    goosefoot sweeps was very successful and recorded average inter-row weed control
    efficacies between 94% and 98% [33]. Mechanical weed control is a complex part
    of agriculture. It requires considerable experience of the farmer to develop a
    long-term concept to keep the weed pressure as low as possible [30]. In our experiment,
    there was a high weed density on the intra-row section, especially with the grass
    weed, which is needed in further research to have better control over the intra-row
    area between the plants and, of course, to have low crop damage because the intra-row
    practices are very close to the cultivated crop. The inter-row sensor-based hoe
    is effective for large parcels of sugar beets because of the higher speed at which
    the tractor can be driven and the very low crop damage. Also, farm parcels cultivated
    with sugar beets have a medium–large size of 30–40 ha and the entire hectares
    cultivated for sugar beets are between 120 and 140 ha, each year, which leads
    to a few days’ work on the fields with the sensor-based hoe with hydraulic steering.
    Weed control efficacy is better for herbicide control at the early stages of the
    sugar beet undergoing spraying with herbicides, which, in most cases, is performed
    weekly, and we can lose considerable yield of the sugar beet if it is undertaken
    after the six-leaf stages of the crop (BBCH 19). Mechanical weed control can be
    undertaken at the late stages of the crop after BBCH 19 and until the sugar beet
    leaves cover the soil between the rows [1,35]. In our experiment, WCE is lower
    at BBCH 19 because of the slower growth of the weeds, and it is higher at BBCH
    31 for the MWC control when the weeds are more developed and the hoe ripped them
    off from the ground. Also, at the HWC, we realize better control in the early
    stage of the crop and when the weeds are in the 2–3-leaf stage. Herbicides should
    be applied more in the early stages of crop development, and mechanical control
    can be performed after the six-leaf stage of the sugar beets [42]. Weed control
    in sugar beet cultivation is increasingly difficult because the physiological
    stage of the crop is small and strict, and technical rules are imposed with low
    and precisely fractionated doses of herbicides [43,44]. It is interesting to investigate
    the differences between chemical and mechanical controls on weeds in the mentioned
    crop, first of all on the products and physiology of the crop plant as well as
    on the finished product, like sugar percentage (obtained from the roots), the
    animal consumer (packages and leaves), or after industrialization on humans in
    different foods [45]. Concern about herbicides polluting ground and surface water,
    human health risks from herbicide exposure or residues, effects on the flora and
    fauna, the development of herbicide resistance, and the lack of approved and effective
    herbicides for minor crops such as vegetables are the major factors driving the
    present and increasing interest in non-chemical weed control [46,47]. Trials have
    shown that it is possible to control weeds in integrated systems combining mechanical
    weeding and phytosanitary treatment, even for beet growing, which is highly demanding
    in terms of weed competition [18]. Questions may be legitimately asked about the
    cost of implementing these practices. The available studies show variable results
    depending on whether direct costs and/or some indirect impacts are taken into
    account. Thus, we consider that our research hypothesis is confirmed and that
    the best practice of the IWM will enhance overall productivity in the long term.
    It will reduce the spread of serious weed species, e.g., herbicide-resistant biotypes
    and other weed species that are hard to control by herbicides. Continuing research
    in this direction helps to maintain the long-term efficiency of herbicides by
    reducing the selection pressure for certain weed species. 5. Conclusions The methods
    of integrated control management of weeds used in this study include post-emergence
    herbicides and sensor-based mechanical control replacing pre-emergence herbicides.
    The results show that by optimizing the integration of control methods, it is
    possible to reduce pre-emergence herbicides but not completely replace post-emergence
    herbicides in the sugar beet weed control scheme. This situation is due to the
    high weed density and species abundance on most farms in the Transylvanian Depression
    area. However, the results show that a better yield can be obtained by including
    integrated weed control strategies. We must also specify that weed abundance is
    much higher in Romania than in west European countries that cultivate sugar beet;
    species of weeds that grow in agricultural lands are up to 5–6 times higher than
    in Germany, for example. The number of chemical herbicides in sugar beets is becoming
    smaller and is continuing to be banned. Also, the herbicide resistance of weeds
    is increasing, so the present study can contribute to the reduction of herbicides
    and lower weed density testing, whereby the growing stage of the sugar beet can
    be the most suitable for sensor-based mechanical control. The results of the study
    show that it is possible to obtain increased production of beet roots with a significant
    reduction of chemical products in the farms from the Transylvania Depression.
    The mechanical shifting precision weed control methods could also achieve less
    stress for the plants and better aeration of the soil, and these facts can, of
    course, increase the target yield. The growing stages experimented with in this
    study were the six-leaf and nine-leaf stages of sugar beet, i.e., BBCH 19 and
    31, respectively, which are suitable for the control of weeds and low crop losses.
    Results show that in a dry summer, as it was for sugar beet in the year 2022,
    mechanical and chemical weed control (HWC + MWC) can offer a sustainable and accepted
    yield while controlling significant weed densities. Similar recent studies from
    Germany showed that the sensor-based mechanical control inter-row had fewer crop
    losses of sugar beet and that the uprooted plants were not significant according
    to the number of plants per hectare. Weeds close to the crop, however, will remain
    a major constraint of mechanical weeding, making it necessary to continue research
    in this direction for the Transylvanian Depression area. Author Contributions

  description: The Green Revolution led to India's food independence mostly through
    the inclusion of supply-driven technologies, such as the introduction of high-yielding
    cultivars, improved access to water, agrochemicals, and mechanization. The present
    and future needs target agricultural sustainability without endangering the ecosystem.
    In this regard, the adoption of precision agriculture is required to meet this
    expected objective. In developed nations, precision farming has already experienced
    tremendous growth. However, precision farming methods have taken a while for emerging
    nations in Asia to comprehend, create, and embrace. Moreover, precision farming
    is frequently misunderstood as a sophisticated technological intervention intended
    for extensive agricultural fields. However, it is essentially a science that involves
    using the "right input" in the "right quantity," at the "right time" and in the
    "right place" to improve input use efficiency. In the case of primary nutrients
    such as nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium, so-called recommendations for nutrient
    management based on soil tests have improved food grain output which increased
    the nutrient use efficiency up to a certain extent. Moreover, the recommendations

    Keywords: Rice, optical sensors, nutrient expert, site-specific nutrient management,
    rice crop manager ABSTRACT The Green Revolution led to India''s food independence
    mostly through the inclusion of supply-driven technologies, such as the introduction
    of high-yielding cultivars, improved access to water, agrochemicals, and mechanization.
    The present and future needs target agricultural sustainability without endangering
    the ecosystem. In this regard, the adoption of precision agriculture is required
    to meet this expected objective. In developed nations, precision farming has already
    experienced tremendous growth. However, precision farming methods have taken a
    while for emerging nations in Asia to comprehend, create, and embrace. Moreover,
    precision farming is frequently misunderstood as a sophisticated technological
    intervention intended for extensive agricultural fields. However, it is essentially
    a science that involves using the \"right input\" in the \"right quantity,\" at
    the \"right time,\" and in the \"right place,\" to improve input use efficiency.
    In the case of primary nutrients such as nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium,
    so-called recommendations for nutrient management based on soil tests have improved
    food grain output which increased the nutrient use efficiency up to a certain
    extent. Moreover, the recommendations are made for a given agroclimatic region
    and crops irrespective of site-specific soil fertility, cultivars, and agronomic
    management levels resulting in excess or scanty use to crop needs. At this juncture,
    assessing the nutritional requirements of plants proves to be a superior method,
    as it takes into account the cumulative impact of nutrient availability from various
    sources on plant growth at any specific stage, making it a reliable indicator
    of nutrient accessibility. Rice, the most important food crop, is grown in diverse
    agroclimatic regions at different management levels. Hence, there is an urgent
    need to adopt a precision nutrient management strategy to optimize the yield output.
    The article offers an overview of several precision instruments available for
    managing nutrients at specific sites and aids in choosing the most appropriate
    one for each circumstance. DOWNLOADS REFERENCES Meena RN, Yadav L, Ghilotia YK,

    developmentWaste valorization 1. Introduction The integration of nanotechnology
    and agriculture has emerged as a ray of hope in a time when concerns about global
    sustainability are on the rise. This innovative synergy has the potential to tackle
    some of the most pressing problems the world is currently facing, such as the
    sustainable management of food and agricultural waste, while also promoting the
    adoption of circular economy practices, particularly in developing countries.
    A substantial and frequently underutilized resource that is essential to the sustainability
    of the food supply chain is agricultural and food waste (Mannaa et al., 2024).
    The effective management and valorization of agricultural and food waste has significant
    consequences for resource conservation, environmental preservation, and economic
    growth in underdeveloped countries where the agriculture sector frequently plays
    a key economic role. These countries struggle with resource scarcity and frequently
    suffer disproportionately from the results of improper waste management (Facchini
    et al., 2023). Because of this, applying nanotechnology to this problem presents
    a special chance to improve food security, lessen environmental impact, and economic
    growth. In the perspective of implementing the circular economy in the particular
    setting of poor countries, this critical evaluation investigates the transformational
    potential of innovations powered by nanotechnology. It explores the use of nanomaterials
    and nanotechnological methods to agricultural and food waste, closely examining
    the technological developments, practical difficulties, and ethical issues raised
    by these methods (Kassim et al., 2022). This research intends to shed light on
    how these new solutions might open the door for a more sustainable and circular
    approach to agricultural and food production by investigating the convergence
    of nanotechnology and waste management. This study will provide a thorough examination
    of the current situation, including an overview of the difficulties caused by
    agricultural and food waste in developing countries, the potential advantages
    of innovations powered by nanotechnology, and the ethical and environmental ramifications
    of these technologies (Gottardi et al., 2021). In order to show the viability
    and influence of nanotechnology in waste valorization, case studies and real-world
    applications can also be examined. While beginning this critical evaluation, it
    becomes clear that the combination of nanotechnology and agriculture holds enormous
    promise in reshaping the environment of food production, waste management, and
    sustainability, particularly in the context of developing countries, where the
    need for effective, scalable solutions is most pressing (Konfo et al., 2023).
    Agriculture and food waste management are shifting towards sustainable and resource-efficient
    methods. Greener solutions are replacing landfill dumping and open burning. Growing
    numbers of people compost organic waste into nutrient-rich soil. Anaerobic digestion
    generates electricity and biogas from organic waste. Pyrolysis and gasification
    turn agricultural and food waste into biofuel and charcoal. Precision farming
    uses sensors and data analytics to optimize resource utilization and reduce agricultural
    waste. These multiple initiatives represent a worldwide circular economy commitment
    to reduce environmental impact and optimize agriculture and food waste value.
    2. Circular economy and sustainable development Quantifying circular economy metrics
    requires careful evaluation of important indicators to evaluate sustainable resource
    management techniques. Material reuse, a circularity principle, requires exact
    measurement. Measuring the percentage of end-of-life items recycled, remanufactured,
    or reused provides quantitative insight into resource circularity (Lateef, 2023).
    Resource efficiency, another important indicator, compares intended outputs to
    resource inputs including raw materials, energy, and water. This quantification
    entails complex evaluations of manufacturing yields, energy intensity, and material
    losses throughout the product life cycle. Indicators of resource efficiency include
    Material Input per Unit of Service (MIPS) and Energy Return on Investment (EROI)
    (Shehata et al., 2022). LCA quantifies circular economy parameters comprehensively.
    LCA quantifies environmental implications across a product or process''s life
    cycle, including material reuse and resource efficiency. Input-Output Analysis
    (IOA) compliments LCA by quantifying sector interdependencies, enabling macroeconomic
    assessments of material flows and resource efficiency (Olabi et al., 2023). The
    systematic use of Material Flow Analysis (MFA) to analyze material flows inside
    a system helps identify inefficiencies and circularity improvements. Tracking
    material inputs, outflows, and stock changes helps understand material cycles
    and resource utilization. Data availability, methodological standardization, and
    complicated system material fluxes make circular economy metrics measurement difficult.
    Despite these obstacles, rigorous quantification methods are necessary for informed
    decision-making, policy creation, and circular economy advancement. The accuracy
    and completeness of circular economy measurements will help sustainable resource
    management strategies advance as technology and methods improve. 2.1. Agricultural
    and food waste management challenges Agricultural and food waste management concerns
    are complex and need a comprehensive approach. The complexity of organic waste
    content and variability requires advanced analytical methods for proper characterization.
    Advanced methods including anaerobic digestion, composting, and enzymatic processes
    are needed to manage agricultural and food waste due to its different sources
    and composition (Singh et al., 2023). Waste generation''s geographical and temporal
    aspects provide issues that need a thorough investigation. Understanding ecological,
    economic, and social processes of waste management is essential to solving these
    problems. Responsible waste valorization requires technical advances and an interdisciplinary
    strategy that addresses the full value chain, from trash creation to resource
    recovery. Precision agricultural technologies: sensors, AI, and data analytics
    for resource optimization and waste reduction are examined in detail. Precision
    farming boosts agricultural output and enables circular economy waste management.
    Accessibility, cost, and culture are important socioeconomic factors in the conversation.
    Effective waste management requires understanding socio-economic differences and
    local context. Policy frameworks, regulations, and international cooperation affect
    agriculture and food waste management at the macro level. The complexity of agriculture
    and food waste management concerns necessitates a comprehensive, multidisciplinary,
    and technical solution. A broad discourse on scientific, technical, economic,
    and socio-cultural factors is needed to create sustainable and resilient waste
    management systems. Table 1 shows the percentage breakdown and descriptions of
    agricultural and food waste management challenges. Table 1. Agricultural and food
    waste management challenges: Percentage breakdown and descriptions. Challenge
    Description Percentage (%) Impact Solutions Reference Post-harvest losses Wastage
    of food due to poor storage and handling practices after harvesting. 30 Food scarcity,
    economic losses. Improved storage techniques, cold storage facilities. (Ouyang
    et al., 2023) Food distribution inefficiency Inefficient transportation and distribution
    systems lead to food spoilage. 20 Food waste, higher costs. Better logistics,
    transportation infrastructure. (Rowan et al., 2022) Excessive food packaging Overuse
    of non-biodegradable packaging materials, contributing to waste. 10 Environmental
    pollution, resource depletion. Sustainable packaging alternatives. (Haque et al.,
    2023) Lack of food preservation technologies Insufficient technology for preserving
    perishable foods. 15 Reduced food availability. Development of food preservation
    methods. (Meena et al., 2023) Inadequate waste sorting and recycling Poor separation
    of food waste from other waste streams, hindering recycling. 10 Environmental
    pollution, landfill usage. Education on proper waste segregation. (Arcas-Pilz
    et al., 2023) Consumer food waste Consumer behaviorslike overbuying and improper
    storage leading to waste. 8 Wasted resources, higher food costs. Public awareness
    campaigns, meal planning. (Singh et al., 2022) Food safety regulations Complex
    regulations may discourage food donation and redistribution. 5 Legal obstacles
    to food recovery. Streamlined regulations to encourage donation. (Phiri et al.,
    2023) Agricultural by-product management Disposal of by-products like crop residues
    and peels can be wasteful. 7 Environmental impact, lost opportunities. Biomass
    utilization, composting. (Varjani et al., 2023) Food supply chain transparency
    Lack of transparency makes it difficult to trace and manage food waste. 3 Inefficiency,
    challenges in waste reduction. Blockchain and IoT for supply chain monitoring.
    (Benyam et al., 2021) Even after food has expired, there are still difficulties
    with waste management. Instead, they move on to the disposal stage, when enormous
    amounts of organic waste are disposed of in landfills and degrade, producing dangerous
    greenhouse gases like methane (Boix-Fayos and de Vente, 2023). This has an effect
    on the environment and wastes a resource that could have been used to make compost
    or biofuel. A thorough strategy must be used to address these complex problems.
    Improvements in supply chain logistics and innovations in food processing and
    preservation are crucial. Campaigns for consumer and producer education and awareness
    can help cut waste at the source. Additionally, updated legislation on trash disposal
    and incentives for food contributions can be crucial in reducing the difficulties
    associated with managing agricultural and food waste (Kumar and Agrawal, 2023).
    A major component of the answer, in the big picture, is a change in how society
    views food and waste, emphasizing the need of resource conservation and the decrease
    of food waste. 2.2. Emerging trends in waste valorization New trends in trash
    valorization represent a significant change in how we see and handle garbage.
    Waste is no longer considered as a problem to be solved by throwing it away, but
    rather as a precious resource that can be utilized as the emphasis on sustainability
    grows around the world (Ambaye et al., 2023). Adoption of cutting-edge technologies,
    such as pyrolysis and gasification, to transform organic waste into biofuels,
    charcoal, and renewable energy sources is one of the current trends (Sabaruddin
    et al., 2023). The circular economy concept, which encourages the reuse and recycling
    of materials and products to ease the strain on natural resources, is in line
    with this. The idea of valorizing plastics—converting them into useful chemicals
    and feedstocks instead of letting them build up in landfills and the ocean—is
    also gaining popularity (Zhou et al., 2023). Urban mining is a concept that includes
    removing precious metals and minerals from construction materials, outdated appliances,
    and technological garbage. Decentralized and community-based waste valorization
    programmers are also becoming increasingly prevalent, giving local communities
    the power to take charge of their garbage and transform it into chances for profit
    (Yafetto et al., 2023). The convergence of these new tendencies, which emphasize
    sustainability, resource efficiency, and environmental responsibility, represents
    a paradigm change in our approach to waste management. 2.3. Nanotechnology in
    circular economy The development of the circular economy has been greatly aided
    by nanotechnology, which provides creative ways to maximize resource use, cut
    waste, and promote sustainable practices in a variety of industries (Lateef, 2023).
    The power of nanomaterials and nanotechnology to change how the design, production,
    and management of things is at the core of this integration. Enhancing the strength,
    utility, and recycle ability of materials is a key purpose of nanotechnology (Dixit
    et al., 2023, Manikandan et al., 2023). Materials'' properties may be precisely
    adjusted at the nanoscale to maximize their strengths, adaptability, and lightness.
    As a result, items last longer, requiring less replacement, and using less resources
    overall. Improved energy and resource efficiency in industrial processes is another
    benefit of nanomaterials (Dixit et al., 2023). By dramatically reducing friction,
    nano-additives in lubricants, for instance, can improve the energy efficiency
    of machines and engines. Nanotechnology enables the creation of intelligent, self-healing
    materials that can increase product longevity, such as self-healing coatings for
    infrastructure or electronics (Rojas et al., 2022). In the context of waste management,
    recycling methods made possible by nanotechnology can disassemble complicated
    materials into their component parts, enabling more effective recycling and upcycling.
    Nanoscale catalysts make it possible to transform waste materials into usable
    resources, such as converting carbon dioxide into chemical compounds (Tardy et
    al., 2023). Nanotechnology is essential for creating nanoelectronics because they
    are more durable, energy-efficient, and compact, all of which reduce electrical
    waste. Precision farming methods are improved by the use of nanosensors and nanomaterials
    in agriculture, reducing resource waste and adverse environmental effects (Mujtaba
    et al., 2023). The use of nanotechnology in the circular economy is a crucial
    step towards a future that is resource- and sustainably-efficient. It presents
    fresh approaches to waste minimization, waste reduction, and industry transformation,
    assisting in the shift to a circular and environmentally conscious economy. Fig.

    3. Nanotechnology in agricultural and food waste valorization Nanotechnology-powered
    innovations are transforming agriculture and food waste valorization issues. Nanomaterials
    improve waste management efficiency, selectivity, and sustainability in these
    advances (Gil, 2022). Nanotechnology allows fine enzymatic control in agricultural
    waste valorization. Metal nanoparticles may be created to optimize enzymatic breakdown
    of complex organic molecules, boosting composting and anaerobic digestion. Biofertilizers
    and biopesticides from agricultural wastes are produced faster owing to increased
    catalytic activity. Nanotechnology helps create sophisticated agrochemical delivery
    systems. Nanoencapsulation controls fertilizer and pesticide release, reducing
    environmental impact and optimizing nutrient use. This tailored distribution improves
    pesticide effectiveness and reduces amount, supporting sustainable agriculture
    (Cassoni et al., 2022). Nanotechnology allows food waste valorization packaging
    innovations. Antimicrobial nanocomposites prolong food shelf life, decreasing
    spoilage and waste. Food freshness may be monitored in real time using nanosensors
    in packaging materials, improving inventory management and waste reduction. Nanotechnology
    and sensor technologies improve precision farming. Nanoscale sensors are sensitive
    and specialized for soil, crop, and environmental monitoring. This data-driven
    method helps farmers maximize resource use, reduce environmental impact, and boost
    output (Omran and Baek, 2022). Nanotechnology-powered innovations may valorize
    agricultural and food waste, but cost, scalability, and environmental effect must
    be considered. As research improves, these issues must be addressed to realize
    nanotechnology''s full promise in sustainable and circular agriculture and food
    waste management. 3.1. Nanomaterials for waste treatment Nanomaterials have revolutionized
    waste treatment by improving efficiency, selectivity, and environmental effect.
    Nanomaterials accelerate the breakdown of complex organic compounds and contaminants
    in waste treatment. Advanced oxidation techniques using titanium dioxide and iron-based
    nanocatalysts accelerate refractory chemical breakdown (González-González et al.,
    2023). Nanomaterials remove pollutants from wastewater due to their enormous surface
    area and reactivity. Functionalized nanomaterials like graphene oxide and carbon
    nanotubes may absorb heavy metals and organic contaminants from water (Khodabandeh
    et al., 2023). Nanomaterials also improve air and water filtration systems. Nanocomposite
    membranes containing nanoparticles remove microorganisms, particulate debris,
    and dissolved pollutants more efficiently. Their customized features enable selective
    and effective filtering media design. Nanomaterials are used in landfill leachate
    treatment and cleanup. Engineered nanoparticles immobilize and detoxify dangerous
    chemicals, reducing waste disposal environmental concerns (Tiwari et al., 2022).
    To responsibly use nanomaterials in waste treatment, toxicity and environmental
    effect evaluation must be addressed despite these advances. Nanotechnology in
    trash treatment represents a paradigm change, demonstrating the promise for sustainable
    and economical environmental management solutions. As nanoparticles'' customized
    qualities and uses are studied, waste treatment procedures will change, supporting
    a more sustainable and technologically sophisticated approach to environmental
    stewardship (Srivastava et al., 2020). 3.2. Nanotechnology applications in biomass
    conversion Applications of nanotechnology to biomass conversion have emerged as
    a key factor in the search for ecologically responsible and sustainable energy
    sources (Dey et al., 2022). Biomass, which consists of organic resources like
    agricultural waste, wood, and algae, has enormous potential as a source of renewable
    energy. The conversion of biomass into useful energy products has never been easier
    thanks to nanotechnology, which takes advantage of the special features of nanomaterials
    like catalysts and nanoparticles (Namasivayam et al., 2023). Nanomaterials'' large
    surface area and reactivity greatly increase the effectiveness of crucial biomass
    conversion processes as pyrolysis, gasification, and enzymatic hydrolysis. They
    enable a speedier conversion process while lowering the energy needs of these
    processes by enabling a more thorough breakdown of complicated biomass structures.
    Additionally, nanocatalysts support targeted reactions, enabling the generation
    of certain biofuels and valuable compounds. Nanotechnology''s incorporation into
    biomass conversion improves productivity and output while decreasing waste and
    emissions, making it a crucial step in the switch to more environmentally friendly
    and sustainable energy sources (Ndukwu et al., 2020). Nanotechnology presents
    a viable route towards more effective and environmentally conscientious biomass
    conversion technologies as we confront urgent environmental concerns and the need
    to decrease our dependency on fossil fuels. Table 2 shows the applications of
    nanotechnology in biomass conversion. Table 2. Applications of nanotechnology

    Improved stability, reduced degradation. Carrier design, loading capacity. Nanoparticle-based
    biodiesel carriers. (Ouyang et al., 2023) 3.3. Nanoscale catalysts for thermochemical
    processes Nanoscale catalysts revolutionize thermochemical processes by improving
    reaction kinetics, selectivity, and efficiency. Pyrolysis, gasification, and reforming
    are made easier by nanocatalysts, which provide unparalleled control over temperature
    profiles and product distributions (Adeniyi et al., 2023). Nanoscale catalysts''
    high surface area-to-volume ratio boosts catalytic activity. Metal nanoparticles
    like nickel or iron catalyze gasification processes with increased reactivity,
    converting carbonaceous feedstocks into syngas. In pyrolysis, nanocatalysts regulate
    biomass breakdown to produce bio-oil and syngas. Nanoscale catalysts regulate
    reaction paths precisely, reducing byproducts and improving thermochemical selectivity.
    Quantum effects and size-dependent catalytic activity boost performance, lowering
    energy use and increasing feedstock efficiency (Feng et al., 2021). Nanocatalysts
    also remain stable under strong reaction conditions, prolonging their lifespan
    and promoting procesfs sustainability. Nanocatalysts improve conversion efficiencies
    and allow the use of biomass, waste, and renewable feedstocks in thermochemical
    processes (Yao et al., 2023). Although these benefits exist, catalyst deactivation
    and scalability must be considered for large-scale industrial applications. These
    problems are being addressed by rigorous research and development to harness nanoscale
    catalysts'' full potential in thermochemical processes for sustainable energy
    and resource production. Nanocatalyst design and performance optimization will
    shape thermochemical technologies in the future (Ozalp et al., 2022). 4. Thermochemical
    techniques for waste valorization Thermochemical procedures are a cutting-edge
    method of waste valorization that uses high-temperature processes to transform
    waste materials like plastics, biomass, and organic leftovers into useful resources
    (Ambaye et al., 2023). These methods consist of incineration, gasification, and
    pyrolysis. In pyrolysis, trash is heated without oxygen to create syngas, charcoal,
    and bio-oil. Gasification is the process of partially oxidizing trash to produce
    syngas, a useful fuel. Even though it is debatable owing to emissions worries,
    incinerating garbage can provide energy (Sikarwar et al., 2021). These thermochemical
    techniques effectively reduce waste quantities and convert garbage into energy,
    chemicals, or other useful products, promoting more environmentally friendly waste
    management techniques. 4.1. Pyrolysis and gasification Advanced thermochemical
    conversion techniques including pyrolysis and gasification enable sustainable
    biomass and waste stream use and energy and resource recovery. Pyrolysis produces
    biochar, bio-oil, and syngas via controlled heat degradation of organic materials
    without oxygen. Temperature, residence duration, and feedstock variables affect
    product distribution and qualities, determining process performance (Chu et al.,
    2023). By partial oxidation, gasification turns carbonaceous materials into syngas,
    a flammable gas combination of hydrogen, carbon monoxide, and methane. Biofuels,
    chemicals, and heat may be made from this syngas. Gasification factors including
    temperature, pressure, and agent greatly affect syngas composition and quality
    (Wu et al., 2022). Pyrolysis and gasification work together to turn different
    feedstocks into energy and bio-based products. Pyrolysis creates biochar, which
    improves soil fertility and sequesters carbon. Gasification produces syngas, a
    biofuel precursor with lower greenhouse gas emissions than fossil fuels (Li et
    al., 2023). These thermochemical techniques accelerate circular economy concepts
    by turning biological waste into useful resources. Pyrolysis and gasification
    are optimized by catalysts, including nanomaterials, which improve reaction kinetics
    and product selectivity. To use pyrolysis and gasification for sustainable energy
    and resource management, research and technical innovation are needed to address
    feedstock variability, reactor design, and downstream processing. Pyrolysis and
    gasification will lead the worldwide shift to more sustainable and circular waste-to-energy
    solutions as scientists perfect these technologies (Mariyam et al., 2022). 4.2.
    Combustion processes Combustion operations, which include the controlled burning
    of fuels to produce energy, are essential to many industrial, transportation,
    and energy production applications (Grauer et al., 2023). Fuels (such as natural
    gas, coal, or petrol) react with oxygen during combustion to create heat, which
    is subsequently used for a variety of tasks, including the operation of motors
    and the creation of electricity as well as the heating of buildings and industrial
    activities. The fuel, the oxidizer (usually oxygen from the air), and the ignition
    source are the three main factors in combustion (Severo et al., 2021). These substances
    react chemically when they come together, producing heat energy, light, and a
    number of combustion byproducts, most notably carbon dioxide and water vapor.
    The effectiveness of combustion processes is a crucial issue because inefficient
    combustion can result in dangerous byproducts like carbon monoxide and particulate
    matter, which worsen air pollution and the environment (Akeeb et al., 2022). With
    an emphasis on boosting energy efficiency, cutting emissions, and minimizing environmental
    effect, improvements in combustion technology are always being made. Cleaner-burning
    engines, more effective combustion techniques, and the use of alternative and
    renewable fuels are examples of innovations (Bhattacharyya, 2022). Additionally,
    combustion processes are important in waste-to-energy systems because they enable
    the conversion of waste materials into energy, advancing sustainability and waste
    management objectives. 4.3. Advances in thermochemical conversion A new era of
    resource utilization, waste management, and sustainable energy generation has
    arrived thanks to advancements in thermochemical conversion technology (Jeon et
    al., 2023). The efficiency, adaptability, and environmental friendliness of these
    procedures, which also comprise pyrolysis, gasification, and combustion, are rising
    (Haugen et al., 2022). The synthesis of useful biochar, bio-oil, and syngas from
    a variety of organic materials is now possible because to improvements in pyrolysis
    reactor design and feedstock adaptability. Gasification technologies have improved
    in adaptability, making it possible to create syngas from a variety of feedstocks,
    including waste and biomass, which may be utilized for chemical synthesis and
    power production (Marie et al., 2022). Innovations in the design of combustion
    chambers and in the management of emissions have boosted combustion processes,
    resulting in the creation of cleaner and more effective energy. These developments
    effectively transform waste materials into energy and other resources, which helps
    to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, mitigate air pollution, and support the circular
    economy (Desage et al., 2023). Thermochemical conversion research and development
    are continuing to propel advancements towards a more ecologically responsible
    and energy-efficient future as waste-to-resource efforts and sustainable energy
    sources gain traction. 5. Biochemical techniques for waste valorization The most
    cutting-edge methods for valorizing trash are biochemical ones, which provide
    environmentally responsible ways to transform organic waste products into useful
    resources. In order to break down complicated waste molecules and convert them
    into biogas, biofuels, and other biochemicals, these techniques make use of the
    activity of bacteria, enzymes, and other biological agents (Ambaye et al., 2023).
    An excellent example is anaerobic digestion, in which microorganisms operate in
    oxygen-poor environments to break down organic waste and create biogas high in
    methane (Nguyen et al., 2023). Similar to this, enzymatic hydrolysis uses enzymes
    to break down complex organic compounds in biomass, such cellulose and lignin,
    into simpler sugars that can then be turned into biofuels like ethanol (Gomathi
    and Rameshpathy, 2023). Biochemical techniques are an essential part of the effort
    to sustainably and environmentally-conscious waste valorization because they not
    only provide efficient waste management but also the potential to lower greenhouse
    gas emissions, promote the production of renewable energy, and create a circular
    economy by turning waste into valuable products (Tsigkou et al., 2023). 5.1. Anaerobic
    digestion A biological process called anaerobic digestion has a lot of potential
    for producing renewable energy and managing trash (Saravanakumar et al., 2023).
    This environmentally benign process uses microbes to break down organic materials
    without oxygen, turning them into useful resources (Sharma et al., 2023). The
    procedure often starts with the gathering of organic waste items, including leftover
    food, sewage sludge, agricultural waste, and animal manure. These feedstocks are
    added to a digester, a controlled, oxygen-free environment (Long et al., 2023).
    A group of microorganisms, including bacteria and Archaea, collaborate in this
    anaerobic environment to break down complex organic molecules. Biogas, which is
    mostly made up of methane (CH4) and carbon dioxide (CO2), is created while they
    work. A flexible and sustainable energy source with many uses is biogas. It may
    be utilized as a fuel for sustainable vehicles as well as for the production of
    energy and heat. Additionally, the anaerobic digestion process produces digestate,
    a residue that is rich in nutrients (Mutegoa and Sahini, 2023). Due to the fact
    that it includes important elements like nitrogen and phosphorus, this digestate
    makes a fantastic biofertilizer. It may be used on agricultural fields to improve
    crop yield and soil quality (Shang et al., 2023). Anaerobic digestion''s capacity
    to concurrently handle energy and waste management demands makes it one of the
    process'' most alluring features, helping to promote sustainable and circular
    economy principles. By trapping methane, a strong greenhouse gas, throughout the
    process, it also contributes to lowering greenhouse gas emissions (Chen et al.,
    2023). Anaerobic digestion is widely acknowledged as a key technique in accomplishing
    these aims as societies strive for more sustainable waste management and greener
    energy sources. Fig. 2 shows the stages of the anaerobic digestion process and
    the key components. Download : Download high-res image (282KB) Download : Download
    full-size image Fig. 2. : Anaerobic digestion process stages and key components.
    Energy yields in anaerobic digestion analysis must be examined using contemporary
    research. Multiple characteristics affect anaerobic digestion, a microbial process
    that converts organic waste into biogas without oxygen. Recent study has shown
    the complexities of energy production efficiency (Tejaswini et al., 2022). The
    result of anaerobic digestion depends on substrate composition, microbial dynamics,
    and reactor layout. Recent research help clarify how feedstocks and operational
    conditions affect energy production. The inclusion of current discoveries in our
    paper will strengthen its scientific validity and enlighten readers about anaerobic
    digestion for energy production improvements and trends (Sharma et al., 2023).
    The newest energy yield data are used to give a technologically contemporary and
    well-founded examination of anaerobic digestion for sustainable energy generation.
    5.2. Fermentation processes Biological interactions known as fermentation processes
    have been used for millennia to create a variety of goods, including food, drinks,
    biofuels, and medications. When sugars or other organic molecules are present,
    these processes include the regulated development and metabolic activity of microorganisms
    like yeast, bacteria, or fungus (Sanwal et al., 2023). The food and beverage sector
    relies on fermentation to produce goods including bread, cheese, yoghurt, and
    alcoholic drinks. Microorganisms convert carbohydrates into a variety of metabolic
    byproducts, such as ethanol, carbon dioxide, organic acids, and flavoring compounds,
    which give these products their distinctive properties (Pan et al., 2023). The
    manufacture of bioethanol, biobutanol, and biodiesel relies heavily on fermentation
    in the field of biofuels. Biofuels are created from renewable feedstocks like
    maize, sugarcane, or cellulosic biomass through the enzymatic activity of microorganisms,
    offering a cleaner and more sustainable alternative to fossil fuels (Janne Carvalho
    Ferreira et al., 2023). Antibiotics, enzymes, vitamins, and other bioproducts
    are made through fermentation in the pharmaceutical and biotechnology sectors.
    The optimization of fermentation conditions made possible by developments in bioprocess
    engineering has enhanced productivity, decreased production costs, and reduced
    waste, all of which have helped to make biomanufacturing more environmentally
    friendly and sustainable. 5.3. Enzymatic conversion Enzymatic conversion is a
    state-of-the-art biochemical method that uses enzymes as natural catalysts to
    convert different substrates into useful products including biofuels, biochemicals,
    medicines, and food components (Kumar Vaidyanathan et al., 2023). Enzymes are
    extremely specific, enabling selective reactions, minimizing the need for harsh
    chemicals and high temperatures, and minimizing the requirement for undesired
    byproducts, making this procedure ecologically and energetically beneficial (Sheng
    et al., 2021). Enzymatic conversion is essential for converting complex organic
    materials, such the cellulose and lignin in lignocellulosic biomass, into fermentable
    sugars for use in the generation of biofuels. Microorganisms can then ferment
    these sugars to produce bioethanol or other biofuels (Ren et al., 2021). Enzymatic
    processes make it possible to employ readily available feedstocks, such as agricultural
    waste and forestry waste, to create clean, sustainable fuels, lowering greenhouse
    gas emissions and reducing reliance on fossil fuels. Enzymes are used in the food
    and beverage sector to improve flavors, texture, and shelf life in operations
    including brewing, baking, and dairy production (Liu and Dave, 2022). The precise
    and effective production of several medications and pharmaceutical chemicals is
    made possible by enzyme conversion, which is also essential to pharmaceuticals
    and biotechnology. Enzymes'' exceptional versatility and specificity provide creative
    approaches to resource optimization and waste valorization (Rahfeld and Withers,
    2020). The applications of enzymatic conversion are also being expanded by continuous
    research in enzyme engineering and bioprocess optimization, advancing the transition
    to a more sustainable and environmentally conscious future in a variety of sectors.
    Enzymatic agriculture and food waste valorization is a technologically sophisticated
    yet commercially effective resource recovery method. Enzymatic valorization cost
    and feasibility are crucial to its practicality. While enzymes may incur manufacturing
    costs, their ability to catalyze certain processes under moderate circumstances
    may mitigate costs. Enzyme engineering and bioprocessing advances reduce costs
    (Sabaruddin et al., 2023). Enzymatic techniques can adapt to varied waste streams
    and produce high-value products, making them feasible. In sustainable waste management,
    enzymatic agriculture and food waste valorization must balance process economics
    with resource value to be feasible and commercially viable. 6. Integrated approaches
    Integrated agriculture and food waste valorization is a new sustainable resource
    use paradigm. This comprehensive plan uses many technologies and methodologies
    to maximize waste valorization efficiency, considering economic and environmental
    factors (Nishi and Hashimoto, 2022). One popular integrated method combines anaerobic
    digestion and microbial fermentation. The leftover digestate feeds microbial fermentation
    while anaerobic digestion generates biogas. Renewable energy and biochemicals
    are produced by this synergistic interaction, improving resource recovery (Reza
    et al., 2023). Integrating enzymatic procedures with classical methods is also
    growing. Biocatalyst enzymes speed up composting and anaerobic digestion by breaking
    down complicated organic compounds. Combining enzymatic hydrolysis with anaerobic
    digestion increases methane output and lowers retention durations, making the
    process cheaper (Pituskin et al., 2023). Waste valorization also relies on precision
    farming technology to optimize agricultural operations. Real-time monitoring and
    management of waste-derived fertilizers reduces environmental impact and optimizes
    resource use using advanced sensors and data analytics. Integrating waste valorization
    and bio-based product creation is key to circular economy implementation. By turning
    garbage into biofuels, bioplastics, and biofertilizers, a closed-loop system reduces
    waste and creates a sustainable resource cycle (Silva et al., 2023). These examples
    demonstrate the complexity of integrated agricultural and food waste valorization
    methods. These techniques combine technology and tactics to improve efficiency,
    decrease environmental impact, and build circular and sustainable agricultural
    systems. Further innovations and optimizations within integrated systems will
    shape waste valorization for a more sustainable future as research continues.
    6.1. Synergistic benefits of nanotechnology and biochemical techniques Biochemical
    and nanotechnology integration is a paradigm change that unlocks synergistic advantages
    beyond each approach''s capabilities. Biochemical processes are more precise and
    efficient when nanomaterials are used. Gold or magnetic nanoparticles may carry
    biomolecules, enabling targeted medication administration and precise bioimaging
    (Alabi et al., 2022). Nanocatalysts improve enzymatic activity, selectivity, and
    stability. Nanoparticle-enzyme conjugates combine enzyme selectivity with nanomaterial
    adjustable features to create a nano-biohybrid platform. This combination boosts
    biocatalysis and bioconversion catalytic efficiency. Nanotechnology improves biochemical
    test diagnostics. Nanoscale sensors and probes improve bioanalytical sensitivity
    and specificity, detecting biomarkers and infections at ultra-low concentrations.
    Quantum dots and plasmonic nanoparticles provide real-time, high-resolution bioimaging
    of biological activities (Chouhan et al., 2023). In regenerative medicine, nanotechnology
    is crucial to biomaterial design and tissue engineering. Nanomaterial scaffolds
    imitate the natural extracellular matrix, promoting cell adhesion, proliferation,
    and differentiation. Advanced medication delivery to particular cellular populations
    in regenerated tissues is enabled by this integration (Chouhan et al., 2023).
    Biocompatibility, toxicity, and long-term safety must be carefully addressed to
    responsibly utilize nanotechnology and biochemical approaches. As nanotechnology
    and biochemistry collaborate, revolutionary diagnostics, treatments, and regenerative
    medicine solutions emerge, ushering in a new age of transdisciplinary achievements
    (Guerriero et al., 2022). 6.2. Nanotechnology and thermochemical integration A
    potential and creative strategy to address pressing global concerns, notably in
    the areas of energy generation, waste management, and sustainable resource utilization,
    is the combination of nanotechnology with thermochemical processes (Qureshi et
    al., 2023). The convergence of thermochemical and nanotechnology processes in
    energy production is accelerating the shift to cleaner and more effective energy
    sources. In order to increase the effectiveness of thermochemical reactions, which
    include procedures like pyrolysis, gasification, and combustion, nanomaterials,
    such as catalysts and nanocomposites, are crucial (Lima Cavalcanti et al., 2023).
    These substances improve energy conversion rates, decrease waste production, and
    minimize emissions while breaking down complicated feedstocks. Nanomaterials are
    also essential for developing thermal energy storage devices, improving grid stability,
    and maximizing the use of renewable energy sources (Shah et al., 2022). The combination
    of thermochemical processes and nanotechnology is revolutionizing waste-to-energy
    methods in the field of waste management. Nanomaterials considerably improve the
    thermochemical conversion of waste materials into energy and useful byproducts
    (Ojemaye et al., 2020). For instance, nanocatalysts hasten the breakdown of trash,
    increasing energy recovery and lowering environmental impact. Table 3 shows the
    applications and considerations for integrating nanotechnology into thermochemical
    processes. Table 3. Integration of nanotechnology with thermochemical processes:

    like lignocellulosic biomass. This helps to reduce greenhouse gas emissions while
    also improving the sustainability of these systems (Sharma et al., 2020). This
    approach to using energy, waste, and resources might be completely changed because
    of the confluence of nanotechnology and thermochemical processes. The rising global
    attempts to switch to cleaner, more efficient energy sources and environmentally
    friendly waste management techniques make this integration all the more important
    (Qureshi et al., 2023). By lowering waste, decreasing emissions, and improving
    resource management, it not only increases the efficiency of thermochemical processes
    but also adheres to the principles of sustainable and circular economies. 6.2.1.
    Nanoscale catalysts in waste management Nanoscale catalysts can optimize waste
    management due to their unique performance. The study shows that nanoscale catalysts
    improve waste treatment. Nanoscale catalytic materials provide unparalleled reaction
    kinetics, selectivity, and waste management efficiency. Nanoparticles'' catalytic
    activities, such as increased surface area and reactivity, convert organic waste
    into useful byproducts while reducing environmental effect. The research shows
    how cutting-edge nanoscale catalysts increase waste management efficacy and sustainability.
    This study advances nanotechnology applications by showing how tiny catalysts
    may solve waste management problems with accuracy and effectiveness. 7. Energy
    production and circular economy impact The circular economy and energy production
    are connected in important ways that have ramifications for resource management
    and sustainability (Varbanov et al., 2023). Traditional linear economies include
    the extraction, use, and disposal of resources, which leads to waste and environmental
    damage. A circular economy, on the other hand, encourages a regenerative strategy
    where resources are preserved, reused, and recycled, minimizing waste and adverse
    environmental effects. By affecting how resources are allocated, energy generation
    is crucial to this cyclical paradigm (Piscicelli, 2023). For instance, because
    they use naturally regenerating resources, renewable energy sources like solar,
    wind, and hydropower are intrinsically compatible with the circular economy. Furthermore,
    technologies like waste-to-energy systems and cogeneration effectively turn trash
    into energy, promoting waste reduction and energy recovery.In the circular economy,
    lifespan, recyclability, and resource efficiency are also given top priority when
    designing and producing energy systems (Mukherjee et al., 2023). Therefore, with
    an emphasis on recycling and reusing materials, energy infrastructure and equipment
    are built for extended use and simple disassembly. Energy production has a significant
    influence on the circular economy, and moving towards sustainable and circular
    energy practices is crucial for lowering resource depletion, mitigating waste,
    and reaching a more sustainable and prosperous future. 7.1. Energy generation
    from valorized waste One of the most important aspects of resource and waste management
    that is sustainable is energy production from valorized trash (Ambaye et al.,
    2023). This method is a novel approach with several environmental and financial
    advantages in a world where trash quantities are increasing and there is a demand
    for greener energy sources. Organic or biomass waste that has been treated to
    produce energy or useful byproducts is referred to as valorized waste (Srivastava
    et al., 2023). These waste products are transformed into biogas, biofuels, or
    syngas by the use of technologies including anaerobic digestion, pyrolysis, and
    gasification, which may then be utilized to produce power, heat, or a sustainable
    transportation fuel-trash minimization is one of the main benefits of energy production
    from valorized trash (Srivastava et al., 2023). By turning garbage into energy,
    less waste is burned or dumped in landfills, which lowers greenhouse gas emissions
    and environmental degradation. By completing the loop on resource use and converting
    waste materials into useful resources, it also helps to promote a more circular
    economy. Additionally, this practice encourages the creation of renewable energy,
    lowering the dependency on fossil fuels and preventing climate change (Kyei et
    al., 2023). It decreases the need for fresh resources and the overall environmental
    impact of energy production by using waste materials as a feedstock. In essence,
    energy production from valorized waste leads to cleaner and more sustainable energy
    future, harmonizing with the concepts of the circular economy and environmental
    responsibility (Kyei et al., 2023). It also aids in proper trash management. It''s
    a win-win strategy that helps with waste issues while furthering the cause of
    renewable energy. 7.2. Environmental and economic benefits Energy production from
    valorized waste is an essential practice in the quest of sustainability and resource
    efficiency since it provides a wealth of economic and environmental advantages.
    Waste minimization is one of the most significant benefits from an environmental
    standpoint (Flores et al., 2023). Less organic waste is transferred to landfills
    or incinerators when it is converted into energy or useful byproducts. This lessens
    the environmental impact of garbage disposal, including greenhouse gas emissions,
    leachate pollution, and problems with land usage (Ndahirwa et al., 2022). Processes
    for converting garbage into energy also reduce the need for fossil fuels, which
    aids in reducing carbon emissions and halting climate change. Fig. 3 shows the
    environmental and economic benefits of sustainable practices. Download : Download

    and economic benefits of sustainable practices. The circular economy''s guiding
    principles are promoted through the energy production from valorized trash. In
    doing so, it completes the cycle of resource use by turning waste materials into
    useful resources (Elaouzy and El Fadar, 2022). Energy that has been recovered,
    such as biogas, biofuels, or syngas, can be utilized to produce power, heat homes,
    or serve as fuel for vehicles. This decreases the need for non-renewable resources
    and is consistent with the ideas of sustainability and prudent resource management.
    Economically, this practice may generate profit by selling energy or valuable
    byproducts (Smyth et al., 2015). It can boost local economies by generating jobs
    in the waste management and energy industries. Additionally, there may be substantial
    cost savings for governments and companies as a result of the decline in waste
    disposal expenses and the opportunity for grants or other financial incentives
    for renewable energy projects. In addition to addressing trash issues, the production
    of energy from valorized waste also benefits the environment and the economy (Johari
    et al., 2012). It demonstrates the possibility for a more circular, sustainable
    approach to waste management and energy generation, which would be advantageous
    for the environment and the economy. 7.3. Implications for circular economy development
    Circular economy is significantly impacted by energy production from garbage that
    has been valorized (Johari et al., 2012). The ideas of waste reduction, resource
    reuse, and material recycling are the foundation of the circular economy, which
    aims to build an effective and sustainable system. Here is how producing electricity
    from garbage that has been valorized complies with these guidelines and promotes
    the circular economy: 7.3.1. Waste reduction The quantity of garbage that is burned
    or land-filled is decreased when organic waste is valorized into energy (Adegun
    and Adedeji, 2017). This is an essential step in reducing the negative effects
    of garbage disposal on the environment and limiting the depletion of limited resources.
    7.3.2. Resource utilization Energy production from waste materials shows how the
    conventional linear economy, which disposes of garbage, has changed to a circular
    economy, where waste is considered as a useful resource (Liu et al., 2023). Instead
    of being thrown away, organic waste is converted into energy or biofuels, creating
    a sustainable and renewable resource. 7.3.3. Closed loop systems The development
    of closed-loop systems that reuse and recycle goods and resources is emphasized
    by the circular economy (Hou et al., 2023). This idea is furthered by energy generation
    from valorized waste, which closes the loop on organic waste and transforms it
    into a useful energy resource. 7.3.4. Sustainable practices The circular economy
    encourages sustainable practices that lessen environmental impact, reduce greenhouse
    gas emissions, and minimize dependency on non-renewable energy sources by creating
    renewable energy from trash (Wani et al., 2023). By reducing waste, fostering
    resource utilization, establishing closed-loop systems, and supporting sustainable
    practices, energy generation from valorized waste is a significant facilitator
    of the growth of the circular economy (Londoño and Cabezas, 2021). It shows the
    shift from a linear to a circular paradigm and is consistent with sustainable
    development and prudent resource management. 8. Challenges and limitations There
    are several kinds of technical obstacles and limits to implementing nanotechnology-based
    technologies for the circular economy that value agricultural and food waste in
    impoverished countries: 8.1. Technological challenges 8.1.1. Resource constraints
    Developing countries frequently lack the requisite infrastructure, financing,
    and resources for the study and development of nanotechnology applications (Thomas
    et al., 2023). It can be extremely difficult to acquire and maintain specialized
    facilities and equipment. 8.1.2. Feedstock variability Food and agricultural waste
    can vary greatly in content and quality. It can be difficult to modify nanotechnology
    processes to account for this fluctuation and keep output constant. 8.1.3. Energy
    variability The circular economy idea might be undermined by some nanotechnology
    processes'' considerable energy requirements, which would increase their environmental
    impact. One major problem is creating applications for nanotechnology that are
    energy-efficient. 8.1.4. Safety and regulatory compliance It is essential to make
    sure that any nanomaterials employed in waste valorization are safe for the environment
    and people (Monika et al., 2023). It is difficult to create efficient regulatory
    frameworks to control the potential dangers associated with nanotechnology. 8.1.5.
    Knowledge and expertize It might be difficult to build a qualified workforce with
    knowledge of nanotechnology applications in undeveloped countries (Kumar et al.,
    2023). In these specialized disciplines, education and training are crucial. 8.1.6.
    Infrastructure and access Access to cutting-edge facilities and resources, which
    may be scarce in underdeveloped countries, is necessary for the development and
    implementation of solutions driven by nanotechnology. 8.1.7. Technological transfer
    Nanotechnology knowledge and technology transfer from industrialized to poor countries
    might be challenging (Saravanan et al., 2021). It is a big task to remove roadblocks
    to technology transfer, particularly problems with intellectual property. 8.2.
    Environmental concerns Environmental issues must be taken into consideration when
    putting nanotechnology-based technologies for agricultural and food waste valorization
    in the framework of the circular economy in poor countries (Mannaa et al., 2024).
    Although these inventions have a lot of promise, there are several obstacles and
    restrictions on how they can affect the environment: 8.2.1. Toxicity and environmental
    safety The environmental effects of nanomaterials utilized in waste valorization
    processes may be unknown or poorly understood (Konfo et al., 2023). To avoid unexpected
    harm, their potential toxicity to ecosystems and creatures must be carefully evaluated.
    8.2.2. Release of nanoparticles There is a possibility of nanoparticle discharge
    into the environment during nanotechnology applications(Mir-Cerdà et al., 2023).
    It is extremely difficult to control and avoid this discharge, which may have
    negative impacts on ecosystems. 8.2.3. Long term effects Understanding the long-term
    environmental impacts of operations utilizing nanotechnology is difficult and
    frequently necessitates intensive monitoring and study. A difficult task is predicting
    and minimizing these impacts (Hamidinasab et al., 2023). 8.2.4. Energy intensity
    Some nanotechnology processes could need a lot of energy, which could have an
    adverse effect on the environment and the carbon footprint. To address this issue,
    energy-efficient nanotechnology technologies must be developed. 8.2.5. Waste and
    by-products To avoid contamination and pollution, the trash produced by nanotechnology
    applications and the byproducts of valorization procedures must be handled and
    disposed of in an ecologically appropriate way. 8.2.6. Regulatory frameworks For
    many developing countries, creating efficient regulatory frameworks to regulate
    nanotechnology uses, including monitoring, safety evaluations, and environmental
    protection, is a difficulty. 8.2.7. Recourse consumption Natural resources may
    be used in the manufacture of nanomaterials and their absorption into waste valorization
    processes, which might be in opposition to the circular economy idea (Kassim et
    al., 2022). The usage of resources must be balanced. 8.3. Economic and infrastructure
    constraints Various economic and infrastructure issues limit the use of innovations
    fueled by nanotechnology for the circular economy''s agricultural and food waste
    valorization in underdeveloped countries. The high cost of research, developing,
    and implementing nanotechnology applications is one of the main constraints (Cattaneo
    et al., 2022). These expenses cover the cost of obtaining and maintaining specialized
    equipment, doing tests, and developing the knowledge necessary for efficient deployment.
    The inability of developing nations to invest in these technologies, which can
    be capital-intensive, is sometimes hampered by budgetary restrictions. In addition
    to budgetary constraints, poor infrastructure is a big obstacle (Sajid et al.,
    2022). The development of nanotechnology solutions may be hampered by a lack of
    research facilities, labs, and waste processing facilities. Furthermore, the start
    of nanotechnology research and implementation may be hampered by the restricted
    availability of necessary resources, such as high-quality nanomaterials and reliable
    energy sources (Bhattacharyya et al., 2021). It takes a multifaceted approach
    to address these economic and infrastructure constraints, including cooperation
    between the public and private sectors, mechanisms for knowledge transfer, capacity
    development, and the creation of favorable environments that allow these countries
    to utilize the potential of nanotechnology while taking into account their infrastructure
    and economic constraints. 9. Perspectives and recommendations Advocate for a comprehensive
    and collaborative approach to sustainable development when explaining opinions
    and suggestions. Integrating cutting-edge technology, precise methods, and cross-sectoral
    cooperation is crucial. Future research in waste valorization, renewable energy,
    and resource-efficient methods will strengthen sustainable agriculture and food
    systems. Promoting knowledge-sharing platforms, legislative frameworks, and international
    collaboration may accelerate global best practices adoption. These viewpoints
    emphasize the need for collaborative action and provide a path for resilience,
    environmental reduction, and agricultural and waste management sustainability.
    Energy efforts and the UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) provide a vital
    link for sustained and equitable development. In particular, SDG 7 (Affordable
    and Clean Energy) requires renewable energy alternatives, energy efficiency improvements,
    and universal access to clean energy. These factors help governments achieve SDG
    7 by reducing energy poverty and environmental damage. The integration of energy
    concerns with other SDGs shows how global issues and solutions are linked. Transitioning
    to renewable energy and increasing energy efficiency reduces greenhouse gas emissions,
    which helps SDG 13 (Climate Action). Energy access supports inclusive economic
    growth by aligning with SDG 1 (No Poverty) and SDG 8 (Decent Work and Economic
    Growth). This multifaceted approach emphasizes energy''s importance to sustainable
    development. It stresses the need for comprehensive, cross-sectoral plans that
    recognize energy''s interdependencies with the UN''s SDGs'' socio-economic and
    environmental objectives. Nations and communities strategically address energy
    concerns, creating a more sustainable, resilient, and inclusive global future.
    9.1. Emerging trends in nanotechnology applications Recent advances in nanotechnology
    applications have enormous potential to alter several industries and tackle pressing
    global issues(Wang et al., 2021). Key developments and suggestions for maximizing
    their potential are listed below: 9.1.1. Nanomedicine advancements Nanomedicine
    is quickly developing and providing precise medication delivery, non-invasive
    diagnostics, and individualized therapies. Healthcare systems should make investments
    in research, legislative frameworks, and multidisciplinary collaboration to take
    advantage of these developments and ensure the secure and efficient integration
    of nanomedicine into patient care. 9.1.2. Nanoelectronics and quantum computing
    Nanoscale transistors and quantum computing technologies are developing as electrical
    components get smaller (Dasgupta et al., 2015). Governments and businesses should
    invest in research and education to develop a competent workforce that can advance
    encryption and data processing technologies in order to stay on the cutting edge.
    9.1.3. Clean energy solution The development of clean energy depends on nanotechnology.
    Nanotechnology advancements can boost the effectiveness of energy storage and
    solar panel systems. The use of these technologies should be encouraged by policymakers,
    who should also fund research into renewable energy sources. 9.1.4. Environmental
    remediation Innovative approaches to environmental management, such as trash recycling
    and pollution reduction, are provided by nanotechnology. To guarantee responsible
    usage and environmental safety, governments should fund research in this field
    and set up regulatory frameworks. 9.1.5. Advanced materials innovation High-performance
    nanomaterials are revolutionizing fields including electronics, building, and
    aircraft. In order to maximize the performance-enhancing potential of these materials,
    industries and research institutions should work together. 9.1.6. Water purification
    solutions Technologies for water filtration based on nanotechnology can alleviate
    the world''s water shortage. Governments and organizations should make investments
    in the creation and use of effective, affordable water treatment techniques. Collaboration
    between academics, industry, and government is essential to maximizing the influence
    of these new developments. To ensure that uses of nanotechnology are beneficial
    to society as a whole, this partnership should be governed by ethical concerns
    and a commitment to sustainability. Additionally, spending on education and training
    is crucial to developing a qualified workforce that can advance these breakthroughs.
    Finally, to address safety and environmental issues and to encourage the appropriate
    use of nanotechnology, strong regulatory frameworks are needed. 10. Conclusions

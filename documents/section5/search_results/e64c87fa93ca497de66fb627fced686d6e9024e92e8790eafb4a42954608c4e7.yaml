    Abstract—On one hand, the emergence of cutting-edge tech-

    nologies like AI, Cloud Computing, and IoT holds immense

    potential in Smart Farming and Precision Agriculture. These

    technologies enable real-time data collection, including high-

    resolution crop imagery, using Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs).

    Leveraging these advancements can revolutionize agriculture by

    facilitating faster decision-making, cost reduction, and increased

    yields. Such progress aligns with precision agriculture principles,

    optimizing practices for the right locations, times, and quantities.

    On the other hand, integrating UAVs in Smart Farming faces

    obstacles related to technology selection and deployment, par-

    ticularly in data acquisition and image processing. The relative

    novelty of UAV utilization in Precision Agriculture contributes to

    the lack of standardized workflows. Consequently, the widespread

    adoption and implementation of UAV technologies in farming

    practices are hindered. This paper addresses these challenges by

    conducting a comprehensive review of recent UAV applications

    in Precision Agriculture. It explores common applications, UAV

    types, data acquisition techniques, and image processing methods

    to provide a clear understanding of each technology’s advantages

    and limitations. By gaining insights into the advantages and

    challenges associated with UAV-based applications in Precision

    Agriculture, this study aims to contribute to the development

    of standardized workflows and improve the adoption of UAV

    technologies.

    INTRODUCTION

    The agriculture industry is currently undergoing a sig-

    nificant transformation fueled by cutting-edge technologies,

    offering promising prospects for enhanced farm productivity

    and profitability. Precision Agriculture, which focuses on the

    precise application of inputs where and when they are needed,

    represents the third stage of the modern agricultural revolution.

    Advanced farm knowledge systems, empowered by the abun-

    dance of data, have further propelled the evolution of Preci-

    sion Agriculture [1]. Numerous studies have demonstrated the

    positive impacts of adopting Precision Agriculture technolo-

    gies, such as increased net returns and operating profits, as

    reported by the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) [2].

    Moreover, there is a growing emphasis on implementing these

    technologies in environmentally conscious ways to ensure

    sustainable farm production. However, effectively harnessing

    the vast amount of data generated by crops remains a persistent

    challenge [3].

    To address these challenges, it is crucial to explore and

    integrate cutting-edge technologies in the realm of Smart

    Farming and Precision Agriculture. Unmanned Aerial Vehicles

    (UAVs), Cloud Computing, Internet of Things (IoT), Big Data

    analytics, and Artificial Intelligence (AI) have emerged as key

    enablers of innovation in this domain [4]. UAVs equipped with

    advanced sensors and imaging capabilities allow for real-time

    data collection, including high-resolution imagery of crops.

    Cloud Computing provides the infrastructure for data storage,

    processing, and analysis, while IoT facilitates the seamless

    integration of various agricultural devices and sensors. Big

    Data analytics and AI techniques enable intelligent insights

    and decision-making based on the collected data [5], [6].

    This paper aims to delve into the theoretical background

    and related work of UAV, Cloud, IoT, Big Data, and AI

    approaches in Smart Farming and Precision Agriculture. Ad-

    ditionally, authors propose a comprehensive systematic review

    study that investigates the current state of research and de-

    velopment in this area. By analyzing existing literature, in

    order to identify the gaps, challenges, and opportunities for

    utilizing these technologies in the context of Smart Farming

    and Precision Agriculture, Fig. 1, depicted below, offers valu-

    able insights into the evolution characteristics and challenges

    of agricultural development, spanning from Farming 1.0 to

    Farming 5.0. This figure serves as a valuable tool to showcase

    the effective utilization and evolution of technologies within

    the realms of Smart Farming and Precision Agriculture. The

    problem statement of this study revolves around the lack

    of a standardized framework for leveraging UAVs, Cloud

    Computing, IoT, Big Data, and AI in Smart Farming and

    Precision Agriculture. This lack of standardization hinders the

    widespread adoption and implementation of these technolo-

    gies, limiting their potential benefits for farmers, agricultural

    productivity, and sustainable practices. To address this prob-

    lem, our proposed solution is to conduct a systematic review

    that synthesizes existing research, identifies key insights, and

    provides recommendations for the development of standard-

    ized frameworks and practices in this field.

    The motivation behind this work stems from the immense

    potential of integrating UAVs, Cloud Computing, IoT, Big Data

    analytics, and AI in Smart Farming and Precision Agriculture.

    By leveraging these technologies effectively, farmers can make

    faster and more informed decisions, reduce costs, optimize

    resource utilization, and increase yields. Moreover, this inte-

    gration aligns with the growing demand for sustainable farming

    practices and the need to meet the rising global food demands.

    The contribution of this paper lies in the comprehensive review

    of existing literature, which consolidates knowledge, identifies

    research gaps, and proposes recommendations for the future

    development of Smart Farming and Precision Agriculture.

    BACKGROUND

    A. Unnamed Aerial Vehicles for Agriculture

    Unmanned Aerial Systems (UAS), also known as drones,

    have become increasingly popular in agriculture due to their

    ability to provide a quick, cost-effective and efficient way to

    gather data and perform tasks on large fields and crops [7].

    UAS (Unmanned Aerial Systems) indeed come in different

    types and can be equipped with a variety of sensors and

    cameras presented in Fig. 2 that can capture high-resolution

    images, aerial maps and thermal imagery, which can be used

    for a range of agriculture applications, including:

    •

    Crop monitoring: UAS can be used to gather real-time

    data on crop health, growth, and yield potential.

    •

    Irrigation management: Drones can be equipped with

    infrared cameras to identify areas that are in need of

    irrigation and to help optimize water use.

    •

    Pest and disease management: Drones can be used

    to detect and map the spread of pests and diseases in

    crops, helping farmers to take timely action to prevent

    or treat these issues.

    •

    Field mapping: UAS can produce high-resolution

    maps of fields, providing data on soil structure, to-

    pography, and plant populations, which can be used to

    make informed decisions about planting, fertilization

    and other aspects of crop management.

    •

    Livestock management: Drones can be used to monitor

    the health and behavior of livestock, as well as to keep

    track of the location of animals.

    Overall, the use of UAS in agriculture provides a new tool for

    farmers to gather data, monitor their crops and make more

    informed decisions, ultimately leading to improved yields,

    increased efficiency and reduced costs.

    B. Cloud, Internet of Things, Big data and IA

    1) Cloud: computing plays a crucial role in smart farming,

    which is an application of the Internet of Things (IoT) in

    agriculture. The cloud enables farmers to store, process, and

    analyze large amounts of data generated from various IoT

    devices and sensors on their farms [9]. This data can include

    information on weather patterns, soil moisture levels, crop

    growth, and even the health of livestock. By analyzing this data

    in real-time, farmers can make more informed decisions about

    crop management and animal husbandry, leading to increased

    productivity and efficiency.

    Additionally, cloud-based solutions can provide farmers

    with access to advanced algorithms and predictive analytics

    tools that can help them optimize their farming operations.

    For example, cloud-based machine learning models can predict

    UAV, Sensing UAV) [8].

    crop yields, identify pest infestations, and suggest the most

    appropriate treatments. Furthermore, the cloud allows farmers

    to monitor their farms remotely and receive real-time updates

    on conditions and activities.

    2) Internet of Things: The concept of the Internet of Things

    (IoT) pertains to a network comprising physical devices,

    vehicles, appliances, and various objects. These entities are

    equipped with sensors, software, and connectivity features that

    empower them to gather and exchange data via the internet.

    These connected devices can communicate and interact with

    each other, as well as with humans, creating a vast ecosystem

    of interconnected systems [10]. The IoT has the potential to

    revolutionize various sectors, including agriculture, healthcare,

    transportation, smart homes, and many others, by enabling

    increased automation, efficiency, and data-driven decision-

    making. In smart farming, IoT is used to gather real-time data

    from various sources such as weather stations, soil moisture

    sensors, and crop and animal monitoring systems.

    IoT devices and sensors in smart farming can range from

    simple weather sensors to more complex systems such as pre-

    cision agriculture systems that use Global Positioning System

    (GPS) to monitor the growth and health of crops. These devices

    can also be connected to irrigation systems, allowing farmers

    to control the amount of water they use based on real-time

    soil moisture levels. One of the key benefits of IoT in smart

    farming is that it enables farmers to make data-driven decisions

    in real-time. This leads to more efficient use of resources and

    improved crop yields. IoT also enables farmers to monitor their

    farms remotely, reducing the need for on-site visits and freeing

    up more time for other tasks.

    In addition to its direct benefits, IoT in smart farming

    can also help address important global challenges such as

    food security and sustainability [11]. By using technology to

    optimize their operations, farmers can produce more food using

    fewer resources, reducing their carbon footprint and helping to

    ensure that future generations have access to safe and healthy

    food. Overall, the Internet of Things is revolutionizing the way

    farming is done and is poised to play a crucial role in the future

    of agriculture.

    Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) are networks of small,

    low-cost, and low-power devices that can be used to monitor

    and collect data from the environment [12]. These devices,

    called “nodes”, are equipped with sensors, microcontrollers,

    and wireless communication capabilities, allowing them to

    transmit data wirelessly to a central location for analysis.

    WSNs are widely used in a variety of applications, in-

    cluding smart farming, where they are used to monitor soil

    moisture, temperature, light, and other environmental param-

    eters that affect crop growth [13]. The data collected by the

    sensor nodes can be used to make informed decisions about

    irrigation, fertilization, and other agricultural practices, leading

    to increased efficiency and higher crop yields.

    One of the key benefits of WSNs is that they are low-cost

    and easy to deploy, making them accessible to farmers of all

    sizes and resources. They are also scalable, allowing farmers

    to add more nodes as their needs grow [14]. Finally, a review

    of 77 research papers published between 2012 and 2022 on

    the implementation of IoT in various agricultural applications

    showed that roughly 16% focused on precision agriculture

    and the same percentage on irrigation monitoring. 13% of

    the papers delved into soil monitoring, while temperature and

    animal monitoring were each covered in 11% of the research.

    Air and disease monitoring each received 5% of attention, with

    water monitoring accounting for 7%. Fertilization monitoring

    was the least studied, with only 4% of the research papers

    devoted to it in [15].

    C. Big Data

    Big Data plays a significant role in the context of smart

    farming. Smart farming involves the application of advanced

    technologies, such as sensors, Internet of Things (IoT) de-

    vices, and data analytics, to enhance agricultural practices and

    decision-making processes [16]. These technologies generate

    vast amounts of data from various sources, including weather

    conditions, soil moisture levels, crop health indicators, and

    machinery performance.

    1152 | P a g e

    IJACSA-International Journal of Advanced Computer Science and Applications,

    Vol. 14, No. 6, 2023

    Big Data analytics allows for the collection, storage, pro-

    cessing, and analysis of large volumes of agricultural data in

    real-time or near-real-time. By applying advanced analytics

    techniques, such as machine learning and predictive model-

    ing, valuable insights can be extracted from this data. These

    insights can help optimize farming practices, improve resource

    allocation, enhance crop yield, and enable more informed

    decision-making for farmers and agricultural stakeholders [17].

    Furthermore, Big Data analytics can enable predictive capa-

    bilities in smart farming. By leveraging historical data and

    machine learning algorithms, models can be developed to

    forecast disease outbreaks, pests infestation, crop yield, and

    market demand. These predictive insights empower farmers to

    make proactive decisions, mitigate risks, and optimize resource

    allocation. In summary, the integration of Big Data analyt-

    ics in smart farming allows for data-driven decision-making,

    optimization of agricultural practices, and the potential for

    increased productivity, sustainability, and profitability in the

    agriculture industry [18], [19].

    D. Artificial Intelligence

    Artificial Intelligence (AI) encompasses the creation of

    computer systems capable of executing tasks typically requir-

    ing human intelligence, including pattern recognition, predic-

    tion, and learning from experience. In smart farming, AI is

    used to automate various processes and make more informed

    decisions [16]. One of the key applications of AI in smart

    farming is precision agriculture, where AI algorithms are used

    to analyze data from various sources, such as weather stations

    and sensors, to determine the best practices for growing crops.

    For example, AI can be used to optimize irrigation and fer-

    tilization practices, leading to increased efficiency and higher

    yields. AI can also be used in animal husbandry to monitor

    the health and behavior of livestock. Also, AI algorithms can

    be used to detect signs of illness in animals, such as changes

    in their heart rate or behavior, and alert farmers to take action.

    Another application of AI in smart farming is in the detection

    and control of pests and diseases. AI algorithms can be used to

    analyze images of crops and detect signs of pests or diseases,

    allowing farmers to take proactive measures to address them. In

    conclusion, AI is a valuable tool in the development of smart

    farming, enabling farmers to make more informed decisions

    and automate various processes [20]. By using AI, farmers can

    improve efficiency, increase yields, and reduce waste, making

    a valuable contribution to the future of agriculture. However,

    it’s important to note that while AI has the potential to greatly

    benefit the agriculture industry; it also presents challenges,

    such as the need for large amounts of data and the potential

    for bias in algorithms. Thus, it’s important to approach the

    integration of AI in smart farming with caution and a focus

    on ethical and sustainable practices.

    METHODOLOGY

    In recent years, the academic community has extensively

    analyzed numerous works related to smart farming develop-

    ment from various perspectives. For instance, [21] introduced a

    systematic review focusing on precision farming. Then, authors

    in [22] provided a review on technologies in precision agricul-

    ture, highlighting innovations, technologies, and applications.

    Also, authors in [23] explored the use of big data on smart

    farming, emphasizing the primary opportunities and challenges

    associated with this technology. Additionally, [24] conducted a

    quantitative literature review, offering an overview of academic

    production in smart farming.

    In order to enhance the existing analyses, the present

    study seeks to conduct a comprehensive review of UAV based

    applications in the field of smart farming. To accomplish this

    objective, we employed the Preferred Reporting Items for

    Systematic Reviews (PRISMA) methodology [25], a frame-

    work specifically designed to facilitate literature reports and

    systematic reviews. In October 2022, authors conducted a

    search using the available search tool on the Scopus database

    website. Additionally, another search was performed in april

    2023 within the same database to include papers published

    in the year 2023. Scopus was selected due to its exten-

    sive coverage and relevance in similar bibliographic reviews

    mentioned in [24] and [26]. Our search strategy focused

    on terms related to technological applications in agriculture,

    such as “Precision Agriculture,” “Precision Farming,” “Smart

    Farming,” and “Smart Agriculture,” in conjunction with “UAV”

    and related terms. The publication date of articles was not a

    basis for exclusion. However, we restricted our research scope

    to journal and conference articles published in English. To

    ensure methodological rigor, this systematic review adhered to

    the guidelines outlined in the Preferred Reporting Items for

    Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA), with the

    most recent version being 2020. In Table I, you will find a

    compilation of the research questions (RQ) that the Systematic

    Literature Review (SLR) aims to address.

    In this paper, a systematic literature review (SLR) was

    conducted to assess recent research papers on the use of IoT,

    Big data, Cloud & AI techniques in the field of Smart farm-

    ing. However, advancements in technology and the increasing

    availability of digital resources have led to the development of

    new systematic review process, but the traditional systematic

    literature review methodology remains the standard approach

    for conducting systematic reviews, new tools and techniques

    are emerging that can enhance the process and provide addi-

    tional benefits to researchers and decision-makers. However,

    it is important to consider the limitations of these new ap-

    proaches and to ensure that the results of the systematic review

    remain reliable and trustworthy. The following are the steps

    involved in the systematic literature review methodology: In

    this context, lookup has produced a plethora of SLR standards

    that should be observed to reap tremendous empirical research.

    In this paper, we concentrate on the SLR guidelines proposed

    by authors in [19], which can be classified into the following

    categories. There are four steps:

    •

    Step 1: Identifying the research goal(s).

    •

    Step 2: Research subject framing (conceptual bound-

    aries).

    •

    Step 3: Using inclusion/exclusion criteria to collect

    data.

    •

    Step 4: Validation of the research findings is the fourth

    step.

    A. Research Objectives

    This study attempts to systematically analyze possible

    future possibilities for IoT, Cloud, Big Data and AI in Smart

    Farming by analyzing current knowledge and the state of the

    research, with a focus on recent research advancements. This

    paper is interested in learning how this study topic has changed

    throughout time. Furthermore, the outcomes of the evaluation

    well as practical applications.

    B. Framing of the Research Subject

    The goal of this study is to evaluate Big Data, Cloud,

    internet of things, artificial intelligence technologies for Smart

    Farming in a systematic way. As a result, the research subject,

    i.e. the conceptual boundaries, were defined in the agriculture

    environment using the terms “Unnamed Aerial Vehicle”, “Big

    Data”, “Cloud”, “internet of things”, “artificial intelligence”

    and related concepts “machine learning” and “deep learning.”

    The following Table II displays the Inclusion and exclusion

    criteria identified to refine the search request.

    C. Data Collection by Using Criteria

    A definition of search parameters, databases, search key-

    words, and publication time is also required by the SLR.

    The selection of search resources and the choice of search

    phrases are both part of the search strategy. To find the papers,

    automated search engine from the most relevant sources were

    chosen: Scopus. A further examination of similar databases

    (ACM Digital Library and Emerald) revealed significant vari-

    ations in the research studies that resulted. As a result, Scopus

    was used as the primary database for secondary data evaluation

    in this research study. The systematic research approach [24]

    and the inclusion and exclusion criterias, which are based on

    the process query depicted in Fig. 3.

    Screening the article title, abstract, and keywords for rele-

    vant literature for Blockchain, IoT and AI in the subject areas

    of management was the first step. We included a variety of

    document formats in this stage and limited them to the English

    language. This first method was mostly utilized to obtain a

    sense of where research was at the time. As a result, the study

    was not limited intialy to a specific period. In total, 536 studies

    were found as a result of this method. We concentrated on

    studies in the areas of Smart Farming and Precision Agriculture

    in the second step. As a consequence, we narrowed down

    the previously identified 536 publications to 186 papers that

    contained the terms Smart Farming or Precision Agriculture.

    The chosen papers were evaluated using eight quality

    assessment questions listed in Table III [27]. Scores of 1 (high

    quality), 0.5 (moderate quality), or 0 (poor quality) were given

    to each paper. Papers that received a total score below four

    were removed from the study.

    IV.

    RESULTS

    This section present the results obtained and content

    analysis on the complete texts of the identified papers. The

    initial stage of the selection process involved screening the

    title, abstract, and introduction of each paper to ascertain

    its relevance. The subsequent step was to eliminate papers

    that did not meet the exclusion criteria outlined in Table II.

    As a result, 80 papers were identified as the basis for the

    further research process. It is important to note that quotation

    marks are used to ensure that multi-word terms are searched

    together, preventing individual words from being considered

    separately. After conducting the search, the resulting articles

    were manually reviewed by analyzing their titles, keywords,

    abstracts, and texts. Duplicate articles were eliminated, and

    the remaining articles were assessed to determine whether

    they were relevant to the study’s objectives. Valid articles

    were those that focused on IoT-based solutions for agricultural

    problems, were not literature reviews, were written in English,

    Portuguese, or Spanish, and pertained to agriculture rather than

    livestock activities. The study’s search and selection process is

    summarized in Fig. 4. The initial search yielded 536 articles,

    which were then analyzed and narrowed down to 186 articles

    that met the study’s eligibility criteria. During the screening

    phase, 350 articles were deemed invalid and discarded based on

    their lack of relevance to the study’s objectives. Of these, 65%

    did not focus on smart farming. Additionally, almost 35% of

    the discarded papers were literature reviews or studies related

    to smart farming that did not involve IoT. A small number

    of papers pertained to smart farming but did not address IoT

    (about 5% were related to sensors), and some papers had

    abstracts or texts that were not available (about 2%).

    In the eligibility phase, the content of the 80 remaining

    articles was reviewed using the same criteria as in the screening

    phase. Of these, 23 articles were discarded, with 27% not

    related to IoT and 32% not to smart farming. The remain-

    ing 41% were literature reviews or papers without available

    content. This research analysis conducted in 57 articles that

    were eligible for inclusion in the study’s sample.

    A. Description Analysis

    57 papers were ultimately assigned to the topic and rated as

    relevant for deep analysis, out of a total of 536 papers that had

    been previously identified regarding the application of Cloud,

    Big Data, IoT, AI, within UAV Application in Smart Farming.

    The distribution of the selected studies’ suitability, which was

    assessed by reading their titles and abstracts, the distribution

    of articles published per year is shown in Fig. 5, then the

    distribution of documents per year per source is provided

    in Fig. 6 and finally the Fig. 7 describe the distribution of

    documents by appropriateness.

    The decrease in research on the application of drones in

    precision agriculture may be multiple and dependent on vari-

    ous factors such as funding, research priorities, technological

    advancements, etc. However, some possible hypotheses can

    be suggested: Recent technological advancements may have

    solved a significant portion of the issues related to drone

    application in precision agriculture, thereby reducing the need

    for further research in this field. Funding for research in this

    field may have been reduced or directed towards other research

    areas. The scientific community may be transitioning to other

    agricultural monitoring technologies or methods, such as the

    use of remote sensors or satellites. It is also possible that the

    number of scientific publications on the subject has decreased,

    but research is still ongoing in other contexts as provided in

    the distribution of document by subject area provided in Fig.

    8, such as in the private industry. Ultimately, it is important to

    realize that the decrease in research in a given field does not

    necessarily imply that research should be abandoned or that

    previous results are no longer relevant. Existing research can

    still be used to improve existing applications and guide future

    research.

    Out of the 166 full texts in the field of smart farming

    that were found, 96 papers (58%) were rated as having high

    appropriateness, 53 papers (32%) as having medium appropri-

    ateness, and 17 papers (10%) as having low appropriateness in

    relation to the goal of this research project. Book chapters are

    of total of 21%, while research articles are 44%, and reviews

    are 23%.

    Based on the 166 complete articles that were found, Fig.

    8 displays the distribution of document types in the field of

    smart farming by subject area.

    B. Content Analysis

    The complete texts of the papers were reviewed and iden-

    tified in this section. Table IV summarizes the most important

    clusters, primary references, to group the chosen literature into

    related clusters, we engaged in a thorough content analysis.

    In addition Table V complete this set of research documents

    by UAV articles analyzed by characteristics and limitations

    identified in the survey.

    IoT (Internet of Things) technology is transforming the

    agricultural industry by enabling farmers to collect and an-

    alyze data from various sources to make informed decisions.

    However, like any technology, IoT also presents challenges and

    issues, particularly in the context of smart farming. Table VI

    provides a comparison of IoT issues and challenges in smart

    farming:

    RQ1. WHAT ARE THE VARIOUS APPLICATIONS OF UAVS

    IN PRECISION AGRICULTURE?

    The use of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and cloud technol-

    ogy in Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) has brought about

    significant improvements in smart farming. Here are some of

    the impacts:

    •

    Soil Analysis: UAVs can be used to collect soil

    samples, analyze soil moisture levels, and assess soil

    quality, which can help farmers optimize fertilization

    and irrigation practices.

    •

    Planting: UAVs can be used to plant seeds precisely

    and efficiently, reducing labor costs and increasing

    planting accuracy. Crop spraying: UAVs equipped

    with spraying systems can be used to apply pesticides,

    herbicides, and fertilizers accurately, reducing the en-

    RQ2. WHICH CROPS ARE MONITORED BY UAV

    SYSTEMS?

    Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) systems are increasingly

    being used for crop monitoring and management in agriculture.

    Various types of crops can be monitored using UAV systems,

    including different Cereals. These crops are often monitored

    for growth stages, yield prediction, and disease detection [63].

    Fruits and vegetables: Such as grapes, citrus, apples, tomatoes,

    and potatoes. UAV systems can monitor the growth and health

    of these crops, detect pests and diseases, and assess yield.

    Oilseeds: Such as soybeans, sunflowers, and canola. UAV

    systems can be used to monitor crop growth, assess the health

    of plants, and predict yields. Specialty crops: Such as coffee,

    tea, cocoa, and tobacco. UAV systems can help monitor the

    health of these crops, detect early signs of disease or pest

    hicle (UAV) imagery

    This paper proposes a framework

    that integrates UAVs with IoT and

    cloud computing for smart agricul-

    ture. The authors demonstrate the

    feasibility of the proposed frame-

    work through a case study. They

    conclude that the proposed frame-

    work can improve crop yield and

    reduce costs for farmers.

    The authors primarily focus on the

    challenges associated with imple-

    menting UAV-based systems, rather

    than discussing potential solutions

    or strategies for overcoming these

    challenges. While this is an im-

    portant aspect to consider, a more

    detailed analysis of potential solu-

    tions or strategies could be useful

    for practitioners and researchers in

    the field.

    infestations, and optimize harvest. While the use of UAV

    systems for crop monitoring has several advantages, there

    are also some limitations to the types of crops that can

    be effectively monitored. Here are some of the limitations

    collected by analyzing the following articles [64], [65], [66].

    So, there are several limitations to using UAVs for crop

    monitoring. Firstly, UAVs can only cover a limited area in

    a single flight, which makes it difficult to monitor large farms

    efficiently. Secondly, UAVs are affected by weather conditions

    and may not be able to fly in adverse weather, which can

    impact data collection. Thirdly, UAVs require skilled operators

    and specialized equipment, which can be costly and time-

    consuming to maintain. Then, regulations around the use of

    UAVs can be complex and vary between countries, which can

    add another layer of complexity to their use in crop monitoring.

    These limitations must be carefully considered when deciding

    whether to use UAVs for crop monitoring and when planning

    a UAV-based monitoring program.

    In conclusion, while UAV systems can be an effective tool

    for crop monitoring, there are limitations to the types of crops

    that can be effectively monitored. Crop height, density, size,

    weather conditions, and sensor limitations are all factors that

    RQ6. WHAT ARE THE CHALLENGES ASSOCIATED WITH

    USING DRONES FOR DISEASE DETECTION IN

    AGRICULTURE?

    The challenges can be categorized into two primary

    groups: dataset-related challenges and model-building chal-

    lenges. Dataset-related challenges encompass deformations in

    the image dataset, insufficient availability of expert-labeled

    data, significant randomness in the data, and inadequate repre-

    sentation of classes in the dataset. Challenges associated with

    model building are the scarcity of training samples, extended

    training and processing times. Out of the papers analyzed, only

    two proposed potential solutions for these difficulties. The use

    of UAV in smart farming has become increasingly popular

    due to their ability to collect vast amounts of data quickly

    and accurately. However, the integration of Internet of Things

    (IoT) technologies into UAV applications also brings unique

    challenges and issues. The Table VI provides a comparison

    of the key challenges and issues related to IoT in UAV

    applications for smart farming.

    RQ7. WHAT ARE THE POTENTIAL ETHICAL AND LEGAL

    IMPLICATIONS ASSOCIATED WITH THE USE OF DRONES

    IN AGRICULTURE, AND HOW CAN THESE ISSUES BE

    ADDRESSED?

    The use of drones in agriculture presents various ethical

    and legal implications that need to be considered and ad-

    dressed. From an ethical standpoint, privacy concerns arise

    as drones can capture sensitive information about individuals

    or their properties. There is also the potential for drones to

    infringe on airspace regulations, endangering other aircraft

    or public safety. Furthermore, the automation and autonomy

    of drones raise questions about accountability and liability

    in case of accidents or damage caused by these devices. To

    address these issues, several measures can be implemented.

    Firstly, clear regulations and guidelines should be established

    regarding the operation of drones in agricultural settings. These

    regulations should address aspects such as flight restrictions,

    licensing requirements, and privacy protection. Adequate en-

    forcement mechanisms should be in place to ensure compli-

    ance.

    Secondly, public awareness campaigns and education ini-

    tiatives can inform both farmers and the general public about

    the responsible and legal use of drones in agriculture. This can

    help foster understanding and mitigate privacy concerns. Addi-

    tionally, technological solutions can be developed to enhance

    privacy protection, such as implementing geofencing mecha-

    nisms that restrict drone access to certain areas or utilizing

    data anonymization techniques. Collaboration between stake-

    holders, including farmers, drone operators, regulatory bodies,

    and legal experts, is crucial for developing comprehensive

    guidelines and frameworks that address the ethical and legal

    implications of drone use in agriculture. Regular review and

    updates of regulations can also ensure they remain relevant

    as technology evolves. Ultimately, a balanced approach is

    needed that considers the benefits of drone technology in

    agriculture while safeguarding privacy, public safety, and legal

    compliance.

    DISCUSSIONS

    The reason to conduct this systematic review on UAV-

    based applications in smart farming using AI, IoT, and cloud

    technologies is to provide a comprehensive overview of the

    current state-of-the-art in this field. This review aims to gather

    and analyze existing research studies, to identify gaps in the

    literature, and to provide insights into the potential of these

    technologies for smart farming.

    The systematic review will contribute to the research field

    in several ways. Firstly, it will provide a clear understanding

    of the current state-of-the-art in UAV-based applications in

    smart farming, including the various applications, benefits,

    and challenges associated with the use of these technologies.

    Secondly, it will identify gaps in the literature and areas where

    further research is needed. This will help researchers to focus

    their efforts on areas that are most promising and where further

    advancements are needed. Thirdly, it will provide insights into

    the potential of these technologies to transform the agriculture

    industry, promote sustainable farming practices, and address

    global food security challenges.

    UAV-based applications in smart farming using AI, IoT,

    and cloud technologies face several data challenges that must

    be addressed for successful implementation. These challenges

    include acquiring and efficiently storing the large amounts of

    data generated by UAVs, ensuring the quality and reliability

    of the data, processing and analyzing the data in real-time

    using AI and cloud technologies, seamlessly integrating the

    UAV-based applications with other systems, and ensuring

    data privacy and security. Overcoming these challenges will

    require the development of robust data management strategies,

    advanced algorithms for data analysis, secure and interoperable

    systems, and effective policies and regulations for data privacy

    and security. Addressing these challenges will be crucial for

    the successful implementation of UAV-based applications in

    smart farming and the realization of their potential benefits for

    the agricultural industry. Meteorological conditions can have a

    significant impact on UAV-based applications in smart farming

    that use AI, IoT, and cloud technologies. For example, wind

    speed and direction can affect the stability and maneuverability

    of the UAV, which can impact the quality of the data collected.

    Similarly, rain, fog, and low-light conditions can affect the

    quality of the images and sensor readings collected by the

    UAV, which can impact the accuracy of the data analysis.

    Extreme weather conditions such as hurricanes, thunder-

    storms, and blizzards can also pose safety risks for the UAV

    and the personnel operating it. High winds, lightning, and

    heavy precipitation can damage the UAV or cause it to crash,

    while snow and ice can affect its mobility and stability. To mit-

    igate the impact of meteorological conditions on UAV-based

    applications in smart farming, it is important to have reliable

    weather forecasting systems in place. This can help farmers

    and operators plan UAV flights around weather patterns, avoid-

    ing unsafe conditions and optimizing data collection.

    Additionally, it is important to use UAVs equipped with

    weather-resistant sensors and cameras that can operate in a

    range of environmental conditions. This can help ensure the

    accuracy and reliability of the data collected, even in adverse

    weather conditions. In summary, meteorological conditions can

    have a significant impact on UAV-based applications in smart

    farming, and it is important to have reliable weather forecasting

    systems and weather-resistant equipment to mitigate these

    effects.

    Overall, this systematic review will be a valuable resource

    for researchers, policymakers, and practitioners interested in

    UAV-based applications in smart farming using AI, IoT, and

    cloud technologies. It will help to identify areas where further

    research is needed, and provide insights into the potential

    of these technologies to address some of the most pressing

    challenges facing the agriculture industry today.

    By validating and comparing the PRISMA (Preferred Re-

    porting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses)

    results with the presented objectives, scenarios, and analysis

    criteria in Table VII, this systematic review aims to enhance the

    existing survey methodology. It strives to provide an updated

    research review based on established guidelines, which can

    have several advantages. So, by employing a validated method-

    ology and adhering to established guidelines like PRISMA, this

    work aims to provide a reliable, transparent, and up-to-date

    resource that can contribute to the existing body of knowledge

    in UAV-based applications in smart farming using AI, IoT, and

    cloud technologies. Despite the numerous benefits associated

    with the use of UAVs, AI, IoT, and cloud technologies in smart

    farming, there are still some limitations and challenges that

    need to be addressed in the future. One of the main limitations

    is the high cost of acquiring and maintaining these technolo-

    gies, which may limit their adoption by smallholder farmers.

    Another limitation is the lack of regulatory frameworks and

    policies to guide their use, particularly in developing countries.

    Overall, this systematic review will be a valuable resource

    for researchers, policymakers, and practitioners interested in

    UAV-based applications in smart farming using AI, IoT, and

    cloud technologies. It will help to identify areas where further

    research is needed, and provide insights into the potential

    of these technologies to address some of the most pressing

    challenges facing the agriculture industry today. Despite the

    numerous benefits associated with the use of UAVs, AI, IoT,

    and cloud technologies in smart farming, there are still some

    limitations and challenges that need to be addressed in the

    future.

    \ technologies which improve the\nefﬁciency of agricultural irrigation systems.\
    \ Irrigation scheduling has the potential to incorporate\nreal-time feedback from\
    \ soil moisture and climatic sensors. However, for robust closed-loop decision\n\
    support, models of the soil moisture dynamics are essential in order to predict\
    \ crop water needs\nwhile adapting to external perturbation and disturbances.\
    \ This paper presents a Dynamic Neural\nNetwork approach for modelling of the\
    \ temporal soil moisture ﬂuxes. The models are trained to\ngenerate a one-day-ahead\
    \ prediction of the volumetric soil moisture content based on past soil\nmoisture,\
    \ precipitation, and climatic measurements. Using ﬁeld data from three sites,\
    \ a R2 value\nabove 0.94 was obtained during model evaluation in all sites. The\
    \ models were also able to generate\nrobust soil moisture predictions for independent\
    \ sites which were not used in training the models.\nThe application of the Dynamic\
    \ Neural Network models in a predictive irrigation scheduling system\nwas demonstrated\
    \ using AQUACROP simulations of the potato-growing season. The predictive\nirrigation\
    \ scheduling system was evaluated against a rule-based system that applies irrigation\n\
    based on predeﬁned thresholds. Results indicate that the predictive system achieves\
    \ a water saving\nranging between 20 and 46% while realizing a yield and water\
    \ use efﬁciency similar to that of the\nrule-based system.\nKeywords: irrigation\

    1. Introduction\nAn increasing world population and climate change have placed\
    \ a considerable amount of\npressure on global freshwater supplies [1]. Irrigated\
    \ agriculture is the world’s largest consumptive\nuser of fresh water, accounting\
    \ for over 70% of its global use [2]. It is therefore important to develop\ntechnologies\
    \ which enable sustainable and efﬁcient water use for irrigated agriculture while\
    \ obtaining\na healthy plant growth.\nIt is desirable to irrigate to meet speciﬁc\
    \ plant water demands at the right time while avoiding over\nand under irrigation.\
    \ This usually involves irrigation scheduling and control operations on an hourly\n\
    or daily basis for a time period of usually less than a week [3]. Precision irrigation\
    \ aims to accurately\ndetermine and quantify plant water needs. The irrigation\
    \ amount and timing is based on measurements\nof soil, plant, and climatic variables\
    \ from which the plant water need is inferred [4]. Precision\nirrigation has been\
    \ shown to improve water use efﬁciency, reduce energy consumption, and enhance\n\
    crop productivity by leveraging advances in sensor, control, and modelling technologies\
    \ [5–8].\nSuch advances include the development of energy efﬁcient and fault-tolerant\
    \ wireless sensor\nSensors 2018, 18, 3408; doi:10.3390/s18103408\nwww.mdpi.com/journal/sensors\n\
    Sensors 2018, 18, 3408\n2 of 22\nnetworks [9,10], intelligent proximal sensing\
    \ for the detection of plant water stress [11–13], and variable\nrate irrigation\
    \ systems [6,14,15].\nThe temporal dynamics of ﬁeld-scale soil moisture is perhaps\
    \ the most leveraged tool for irrigation\nscheduling. This is because the soil\
    \ moisture status is indicative of the water available for uptake by\ncrops [16].\
    \ A number of irrigation scheduling methods estimate crop water needs using soil\
    \ moisture\nand climatic data, and rules created by expert agronomists. Most of\
    \ the commercial automated\nirrigation systems are programmed to irrigate at speciﬁc\
    \ time intervals and apply a ﬁxed irrigation\nvolume. A number of these systems\
    \ are also programmed to irrigate after a predeﬁned soil moisture\nthreshold is\
    \ reached [17]. Due to their open-loop structure, these methods may not guarantee\
    \ optimum\nirrigation scheduling decisions resulting in suboptimal plant health\
    \ and efﬁciency in water use [18].\nThese shortcomings can be alleviated with\
    \ the use of feedback control where sensor feedback is\nemployed in optimizing\
    \ irrigation timing and volume [19]. Although these approaches improve\nirrigation\
    \ scheduling decisions, they do not include a model for the process dynamics;\
    \ as a result,\nthe overall system may not be robust to external perturbations\
    \ [20].\nModel-based irrigation scheduling systems consist of a calibrated internal\
    \ model which\nemploys feedback from soil, plant, and climatic sensors in order\
    \ to predict crop water needs [20].\nMcCarthy et al. [21] implemented a model-based\
    \ control system for predicting the irrigation\nrequirements of cotton with an\
    \ objective of maximizing crop yield. Their system relied on a complex\ncrop model\
    \ which requires detailed information on various climatic, soil and crop parameters.\n\
    Park et al. [20] developed a model predictive control system for center pivot\
    \ irrigation which used\nmeasured soil and climatic data to calibrate a complex\
    \ soil-water model. The use of mechanistic\nmodels in these systems has many practical\
    \ limitations because they are data demanding and require\ntime-consuming calibrations\
    \ during model development.\nIn recent years, many studies have investigated the\
    \ applicability of data-driven machine learning\nmodels to irrigation decision\
    \ support. Navarro-Hellín et al. [22] presented a regression model applied\nin\
    \ predicting the weekly irrigation needs of a plantation using climatic and soil\
    \ data as inputs.\nGiusti and Marsili-Libelli [23] applied a fuzzy decision system\
    \ in predicting the volumetric soil\nmoisture content based on local weather data.\
    \ King and Shellie [24] used neural network modelling to\nestimate the lower threshold\
    \ (Tnws) needed to calculate the crop water stress index for wine grapes.\nDelgoda\
    \ et al. [25] applied a system identiﬁcation model in predicting the soil moisture\
    \ deﬁcit using\nclimatic and soil moisture data as model inputs. These statistical\
    \ methods explore the spatial and\ntemporal patterns hidden in historical data\
    \ in order to map input data to an output space. They do not\nrely on a physical\
    \ model of the system as they are data-driven (i.e., they learn from data). In\
    \ many\ncases, these machine learning methods have been shown to achieve a good\
    \ prediction performance [26].\nThey also have fewer data requirements when compared\
    \ to mechanistic models [24,27,28].\nFor real-time irrigation scheduling, a model\
    \ which is able to predict the soil moisture dynamics\nis desirable [18]. In order\
    \ to achieve this with traditional machine learning and system identiﬁcation\n\
    methods, an extensive physical knowledge of vadose zone hydrology and boundary\
    \ layer meteorology\nis required to derive robust input features from soil and\
    \ climatic data. This is because of the complex\nnonlinear relationship between\
    \ the climatic parameters, soil hydraulic properties, and the soil moisture\n\
    dynamics [29]. Lozoya et al. [30], Delgoa et al. [25], Giusti and Marsili-Libelli\
    \ [23], and Saleem et al. [31]\npresented system identiﬁcation models for the\
    \ prediction of soil moisture dynamics, which are\nparameterized based on the\
    \ soil water balance method. This involved assumptions relating to the\nabsence\
    \ of surface run-off and deep percolation. The estimated evapotranspiration was\
    \ also used as\nan input to the models. In practice, the true crop evapotranspiration\
    \ may be signiﬁcantly different\nfrom the estimated values. Furthermore, these\
    \ models are only applicable to the site for which they\nare developed limiting\
    \ their use for a different environment. This is because models developed using\n\
    traditional machine learning and system identiﬁcation approaches are mostly only\
    \ applicable to the\nenvironment for which they were developed [22].\nSensors\
    \ 2018, 18, 3408\n3 of 22\nMachine learning approaches such as support vector\
    \ machines (SVMs) and adaptive neuro-fuzzy\ninference systems (ANFIS) are another\
    \ group of models that have been applied for the prediction of\nsoil moisture\
    \ dynamics [26,32–34]. These approaches have good prediction capability and limited\n\
    input requirements.\nKarandish and Šim ˚unek [26] compared various machine learning\
    \ models\nincluding ANFIS and SVM for simulating the time series of soil moisture\
    \ content using meteorological,\nprecipitation, and crop coefﬁcient data as model\
    \ input.\nThe authors reported that the models\nachieved a prediction performance\
    \ comparable to that of a mechanistic physical process-based model:\nHYDRUS–2D.\
    \ However, they noted that these machine learning models are not suitable for\
    \ the entire\nrange of soil moisture prediction i.e., water stress conditions.\
    \ It is therefore evident that robust and\nscalable data-driven models need to\
    \ be developed for irrigation scheduling applications.\nNeural network (NN) methods\
    \ have a strong learning ability and are able to represent the\nnonlinear relationship\
    \ between the inputs and outputs of a system [35]. Some speciﬁc applications\n\
    of neural networks to irrigation and water resource management include the prediction\
    \ of soil\nmoisture to aid irrigation scheduling [35,36], crop yield prediction\
    \ [37,38], prediction of irrigation\nwater demand [39,40], rainfall-runoff modelling\
    \ [41,42] and groundwater modelling [43,44].\nAn NN method is applied in this\
    \ study for predicting the soil moisture dynamics because of\ntheir ability to\
    \ produce robust functions approximating complex processes [45]. However, traditional\n\
    feedforward neural networks (FFNNs) have limited ability to model dynamic data\
    \ because they are\nunable to preserve previous information, resulting in suboptimal\
    \ predictions when they are applied\nin modelling highly causal systems [46].\
    \ The learning capability of FFNNs can be improved through\nadditional pre-processing\
    \ of dynamic data and combining the FFNN with other methods including\ngenetic\
    \ algorithms [47] and fuzzy logic [36]. For example, Pulido-Calvo and Gutiérrez-Estrada\
    \ [40]\napplied a hybrid FFNN model to generate a one-day-ahead forecast of daily\
    \ irrigation water demand.\nThe forecast produced by the FFNN was corrected via\
    \ a fuzzy logic approach whose parameters\nwere adjusted using genetic algorithms.\
    \ While this sort of hybrid modelling approach can strengthen\nthe ability of\
    \ an FFNN to learn dynamic data, the long-term generalization ability of such\
    \ models\nis limited due to the ad hoc nature of fuzzy logic rules. Furthermore,\
    \ the methods that employ\nadditional pre-processing of dynamic data are time-consuming\
    \ because of the extensive time and\nfrequency domain computations they rely on.\
    \ The data pre-processing steps also rely on subjective\nuser intervention, which\
    \ limits the scalability of the models to new environments.\nThis present study\
    \ focuses on a dynamic modelling task, for which the Recurrent Neural Network\n\
    (RNN) presents a suitable solution. An RNN has internal self-looped cells, allowing\
    \ it to preserve\ninformation from previous time steps [48]. The Long Short-Term\
    \ Memory Network (LSTM), a class\nof RNNs was selected for this study because\
    \ of its successful application in the control of nonlinear\ndynamic systems [49,50].\
    \ The LSTM requires minimal input data pre-processing and is able to\npreserve\
    \ useful information across multiple time steps [51]. They have been shown to\
    \ achieve robust\nperformance in modelling sequential data in ﬁelds such as natural\
    \ language processing [52], time\nseries classiﬁcation of chaotic systems [53],\
    \ and speech recognition [54]. Zhang et al. [55] demonstrated\na hydrological\
    \ application of LSTM models for the prediction of water table depth. Time series\n\
    data on water diversion, evaporation, precipitation and temperature were applied\
    \ as inputs to the\nmodel. The authors reported R2 scores ranging between 0.789\
    \ and 0.952 for the LSTM models,\nlargely outperforming FFNN models which achieved\
    \ a maximum R2 score of 0.495. The robust water\ntable depth prediction achieved\
    \ by the LSTM models highlights their ability to preserve and learn\nprevious\
    \ information from long-term time series data typical of hydrological application.\
    \ This ability\nis particularly desirable in soil moisture based irrigation scheduling\
    \ where the present soil moisture\ncontent is dependent on past soil moisture,\
    \ precipitation, and climatic data.\nThe objective of this study was to develop\
    \ LSTM models for the prediction of volumetric soil\nmoisture content for three\
    \ sites with different soil characteristics. Performance of the LSTM models\n\
    was evaluated by comparing the LSTM predicted soil moisture content with measured\
    \ soil moisture\ncontent and estimated soil moisture content using traditional\
    \ feedforward neural networks (FFNNs).\nSensors 2018, 18, 3408\n4 of 22\nThe applicability\
    \ of the LSTM models for prediction in sites not used in model training was also\n\
    investigated. Finally, the application of the LSTM models in predictive irrigation\
    \ scheduling was\ndemonstrated using model-based simulations of the potato-growing\
    \ season.\nThe rest of the paper is structured as follows. In Section 2, the theoretical\
    \ background of\nneural networks is presented. In Section 3, the methodology employed\
    \ for the study is presented.\nSection 4 shows the performance evaluation of the\
    \ neural network models and the predictive irrigation\nscheduling system. In Section\
    \ 5, conclusions and recommendations for future work are presented.\n2. Background\n\
    This section presents a theoretical background on artiﬁcial neural networks including\
    \ the FFNN\nand the recurrent neural network.\n2.1. Neural Network Preliminaries\n\
    The basic building block of neural networks is the neuron. It is a processing\
    \ element that takes\na number of inputs, applies a weight to them, sums them\
    \ up, includes a bias term, and passes the\nresult to an activation function,\
    \ which then produces an output. This activation function implements a\nnonlinear\
    \ transformation to the linearly combined input in order to produce a nonlinear\
    \ output.\nThrough a combination of these neurons across the input space and connections\
    \ of the neurons\noutputs to other neurons, a function can be learned which maps\
    \ the nonlinear relationship between an\ninput feature space and an output target.\
    \ The input–output relation of the system can be described by\nEquation (1) [45]:\n\
    Zi\nj(k) = f\n \nN\n∑\ni=1\nwi\nijxi−1\ni\n(k) + δi\n!\n(1)\nwhere f (:) is the\
    \ nonlinear activation function, and wi\nij is the connection weight of the j-th\
    \ neuron unit\nin the (i − 1)-th layer to those of the i-th layer. xi−1\ni\nis\
    \ the input from the (i − 1)-th layer and δi are the\nrespective bias terms.\n\
    2.2. The Feedforward Neural Network\nThe FFNN, also known as the multilayer perceptron\
    \ (MLP) network, is built by ordering neurons\nin layers and letting each neuron\
    \ in a layer take as input only the outputs of the units in the previous\nlayer\
    \ or external inputs. A network with N = 1, 2, 3, . . . , n layers is called an\
    \ n layer network.\nThe FFNN is shown in Figure 1.\nSensors 2018, 18, x FOR PEER\
    \ REVIEW  \n5 of 22 \n \nFigure 1. The feedforward neural network (FFNN). \nThe\
    \ second layer in Figure 1 is called the output layer as it produces the output\
    \ of the network. \nThe first layer is known as the hidden layer since it is located\
    \ between the external inputs and the \noutput layer. The mathematical formula\
    \ expressing the FFNN is detailed in Equation (2) [45] \n\U0001D466ො௜ = \U0001D454\

    \ weights, the network is trained with data containing\nexamples of the inputs\
    \ xl and outputs yi pairs, known as the training set. The weights are chosen\n\
    to minimize a global loss function, which measures the cost of predicting ˆy when\
    \ the true output\ny is a function over the training set. For regression problems\
    \ that encompass dynamic modelling\ntasks, the cost function to be minimized is\
    \ the mean-squared error, which is computed as shown in\nEquation (3):\nl( ˆy,\
    \ y) =\nK\n∑\nk=1\nE(k) = 1\n2n\nK\n∑\nk=1\nn\n∑\ni=1\n∥ ˆyi(k) − yi(k)∥2\n(3)\n\
    where l( ˆy, y) is the loss function, and n is the number of training examples.\
    \ The minimization of the\nloss function and update of weights is achieved using\
    \ the backpropagation algorithm [56].\n2.3. Long Short-Term Memory Network\nThe\
    \ LSTM is a variant of the RNN, so it is expedient to introduce the RNN before\
    \ describing\nthe LSTM.\nRecurrent neural networks are similar to FFNNs except\
    \ that there is a self-feedback of neurons in\nthe hidden layers as illustrated\
    \ in Figure 2. This gives the network memory and it is able to learn from\nan\
    \ entire sequence given portions of the overall sequence, i.e., it is a dynamic\

    \ connections to memorize short-term\ndependency in a sequence; as a result, the\
    \ backpropagated error signals in time can become inﬁnitely\nhigh or vanish [59].\
    \ Hochreiter and Schmidhuber [60] proposed the LTSM, which is able to solve the\n\
    exploding or vanishing gradients problem by enforcing constant error ﬂows through\
    \ constant error\ncarousels within special multiplicative units. These units regulate\
    \ the error ﬂow in the network by\nlearning how to open or close specialized gates\
    \ in the network. The constant error carousels (CECs)\nand the multiplicative\
    \ and gate units form the memory block of the LSTM [55].\nThe CEC loops through\
    \ the network without an activation function, so the vanishing gradient\nproblem\
    \ does not occur when BPTT is applied to train an LSTM [45]. Therefore, LSTMs\
    \ are able\nto approximate long-term information because the information can ﬂow\
    \ easily along the cells\nunchanged. The input, forget, and output gates of the\
    \ memory block control the input into the\nCEC cell, the information retained\
    \ in the cells, and the output from the cell into other blocks in the\nnetwork.\

    \ for this study is presented in this section. This includes an overview\nof the\
    \ data applied for developing the soil moisture prediction models, the structure\
    \ of the neural\nnetwork models, and the structure of the predictive irrigation\
    \ scheduling system.\n3.1. Study Sites and Data Source\nThe data applied in developing\
    \ the neural network (NN) models for soil moisture prediction were\nobtained from\
    \ three study sites, which are part of the Cosmic-Ray Soil Moisture Observing\
    \ System\n(COSMOS) monitoring project in the United Kingdom [61]. Brieﬂy, the\
    \ COSMOS project is a soil\nmoisture and climate monitoring network operating\
    \ in the UK, USA, Australia, and China. The project\nprovides near real-time soil\
    \ moisture and climatic data for use in a variety of applications including\n\
    agriculture, water resources management, ﬂood prediction, and land-surface modelling.\n\
    The data obtained for the three study sites included hourly measurements of windspeed,\
    \ rainfall,\nair temperature, net radiation, relative humidity, and volumetric\
    \ soil moisture content. Details of the\nthree sites are summarized in Table 1.\n\

    December 2013–September 2017\nThe volumetric soil moisture content in all sites\
    \ is measured using the cosmic-ray soil moisture\nsensor (Model CRS-1000/B, Hydroinnova\
    \ LLC, Albuquerque, NW, USA) deployed using a site-specific\ncalibration. The\
    \ cosmic-ray soil moisture sensor consists of a non-invasive probe which measures\
    \ the\nneutron emitted by cosmic rays within the air and soil. These neutrons\
    \ are moderated by hydrogen\natoms emitted from soil water into the atmosphere.\
    \ The neutrons and hydrogen atoms combine\ninstantaneously and its density is\
    \ inversely correlated with soil moisture [62]. A calibration function\ndefines\
    \ the relationship between the neutron intensity and soil moisture. This calibration\
    \ function is\nsimple, monotonic, and invariant with soil texture and chemical\
    \ composition [63]. The sensor has a\nhorizontal measurement range of 200 m and\
    \ an effective measurement depth of up to 60 m. The sensor\nis reported to have\
    \ an accuracy of ±2% measured volumetric soil moisture content [64]. Full details\n\
    on the operating principle of the sensor can be found in Shuttleworth et al. [61].\
    \ The meteorological\nvariables (e.g., air temperature, relative humidity, net\
    \ radiation, windspeed, and precipitation) in all\nsites are measured by a MetPak\
    \ Pro Base automatic weather station (Gill Instruments, Hampshire, UK).\nThe NN\
    \ models trained on data from the sites listed in Table 1 were also applied in\
    \ predicting\nthe soil moisture content in two independent sites with soil characteristics\
    \ similar to that of the sites\nfor which the models were trained. This was done\
    \ to evaluate the applicability of the models for\nprediction in new sites, which\
    \ were not used in model training. A summary of the independent sites is\npresented\
    \ in Table 2.\nSensors 2018, 18, 3408\n8 of 22\nTable 2. The independent sites\

    \ and Pre-Processing\nThe hourly data was resampled to daily (24 h) intervals\
    \ as this is a time period applicable for ﬁeld\nscale irrigation scheduling [65].\
    \ The daily averages of the climatic variables were calculated during\nthe resampling,\
    \ while the daily precipitation was calculated as the sum of daily rainfall and\
    \ irrigation\ndepths. The volumetric soil moisture content was also resampled\
    \ to its average daily value. The data\ncleaning steps included imputing of missing\
    \ values and removal of outliers.\nThe pre-processing steps applied for the data\
    \ modelled with the FFNN included a box–cox\ntransform [66] of the soil moisture\
    \ and air temperature data in order to stabilize their variance.\nThe transformed\
    \ data were thereafter deseasonalized using the seasonal and trend decomposition\n\
    using loess (STL), as proposed by Cleveland et al. [67]. Several studies have\
    \ shown that deseasonalizing\ndynamic data that exhibits seasonality prior to\
    \ modelling is necessary in order to produce robust\npredictions with an FFNN\
    \ model [68,69]. The STL technique decomposes the soil moisture and air\ntemperature\
    \ data into their trend, seasonal, and residual components. Thereafter, the sums\
    \ of the trend\nand level were passed to the next step of the data pre-processing.\
    \ An example of the transformed and\ndecomposed soil moisture data is shown in\
    \ Figure 4. In the next data pre-processing step, the climatic,\nprecipitation,\
    \ and soil moisture data were standardized by computing the z-score of their data\
    \ points.\nIn the post-processing stage, the soil moisture predictions were back-transformed\
    \ to their actual scale\nthrough an inverse z-score transformation, the addition\
    \ of the seasonal component, and an inverse\nbox–cox transformation.\nFor the\
    \ LSTM, the only data pre-processing step applied was a standardization of the\
    \ climatic,\nprecipitation, and soil moisture data. This was accomplished by computing\
    \ the z-score of their data\npoints. In the post-processing stage, the soil moisture\
    \ predictions were back-transformed to their\nactual scale through an inverse\
    \ z-score transformation.\nFor the model training sites, the dataset was divided\
    \ into a 70:30 ratio for the purpose of model\ntraining and evaluation. The division\
    \ was done such that the temporal nature of the data was accounted\nfor; i.e.,\
    \ the evaluation dataset was posterior to the training dataset.\nData spanning\
    \ 2016–2017 for the independent sites (Table 2) was applied in evaluating the\n\
    prediction performance of the trained NN models on those sites.\nSensors 2018,\

    \ moisture content at time \U0001D461 + 1 is a nonlinear function of past and\
    \ present \nFigure 4. Soil moisture data transformation and decomposition prior\

    \ Framework\nFor predictive irrigation scheduling, a one-day-ahead prediction\
    \ of the soil moisture content is\nrequired. The soil moisture content at time\
    \ t + 1 is a nonlinear function of past and present climatic,\nand precipitation\
    \ inputs. It is also inﬂuenced by the past and present soil moisture content values.\
    \ This\nis a Multiple Input and Single Output (MISO) system. The FFNN and LSTM\
    \ networks are encoded in\nvarious suitable architectures appropriate for the\
    \ learning task. The neural networks were developed\nusing the Keras Deep Learning\
    \ library on the Python programming platform [70].\n3.3.1. The Feedforward Neural\
    \ Network Structure\nThe FFNN is straightforward to employ for discrete time modelling\
    \ of dynamic systems for which\nthere is a nonlinear relationship between the\
    \ system’s inputs and output. The soil moisture dynamics\ncan be modelled as a\
    \ Nonlinear Autoregressive with Exogenous Input System (NARX) as shown in\nEquation\
    \ (12):\ny(t + 1) = S[y(t), . . . , y(t − j), u(t), . . . , u(t − n), p(t), .\
    \ . . , p(t − m)]\n(12)\nwhere y(t + 1) is the one-day-ahead prediction of the\
    \ volumetric soil moisture content, y(t = 0 . . . j)\nare the present and past\
    \ soil moisture content at day t = 0 . . . j, u(t = 0 . . . n) are the climatic\
    \ inputs\nat day t = 0 . . . n, p(t = 0 . . . m) are the precipitation inputs\
    \ at day t = 0 . . . m, and S is a nonlinear\nfunction, which is approximated\
    \ using the FFNN.\nThe time lags m, n, and j are determined through experimentation.\
    \ The number of hidden\nlayers in the network and the number of neurons in each\
    \ hidden layer are also determined\nSensors 2018, 18, 3408\n10 of 22\nthrough\
    \ experimentation. The soil moisture prediction is framed as a regression problem;\
    \ as such,\nan appropriate activation function is required for the hidden layers\
    \ of the FFNN. For regression\nproblems, the most robust nonlinear activation\
    \ function is the point-wise rectiﬁed linear units\n(RELU),max(0, x), where x\
    \ is the input into the neuron. The RELU activation function is reported to\n\
    provide easier optimization, faster convergence, and better generalization with\
    \ the added bonus of\nbeing computationally efﬁcient [71].\nDuring the study,\
    \ the RELU nonlinearity was applied in the hidden layers, while the network\n\
    loss was minimized using the adaptive moment estimation (ADAM) optimization algorithm,\
    \ which is\nreported to improve network convergence [72].\n3.3.2. The Long Short-Term\
    \ Memory Network Structure\nFor modelling dynamic systems, the LSTM introduces\
    \ a nonlinearity from the input to system\nstates followed by a dynamic linearity\
    \ from the states to the output. This can be represented in the\nstate space form\
    \ as shown in Equations (13a) and (13b):\nx(t + 1) = NNi[x(t) . . . x(t − k),\
    \ u(t) . . . u(t − n), y(t) . . . y(t − j), p(t) . . . p(t − m); V]\n(13a)\ny(t\
    \ + 1) = NNo[x(t + 1); W]\n(13b)\nwhere x(t + 1) is the future state of the network\
    \ at day t + 1, x(t = 0 . . . k) are the present and past\nnetwork states at day\
    \ t = 0 . . . k, y(t = 0 . . . j) are the present and past soil moisture content\
    \ at day\nt = 0 . . . j, u(t = 0 . . . n) are the climatic inputs at day t = 0\
    \ . . . n, p(t = 0 . . . m) are the precipitation\ninputs at day t = 0 . . . m,\
    \ and y(t + 1) is the one-day-ahead prediction of the volumetric soil moisture\n\
    content. V is the parameter set of the network that corresponds to the states,\
    \ and W is the parameter\nset of the network that corresponds to the output.\n\
    The time lags m, n, and j are determined through experimentation while the time\
    \ delay k for\nthe states is learned implicitly by the network during training.\
    \ The network is designed as an LSTM\nnonlinear element (NNi) followed by a linear\
    \ output layer (NNo). The number of LSTM layers and\nthe number of memory blocks\
    \ in each layer are also determined through experimentation. During the\nstudy,\
    \ the network loss was minimized using the ADAM optimization algorithm.\n3.4.\
    \ Irrigation Scheduling\nA predictive irrigation scheduling system is enabled\
    \ by a model that uses feedback from soil\nand climatic sensors to predict the\
    \ crop water demand [20]. A trained neural network model is\nable to generate\
    \ soil moisture predictions and presents an opportunity for implementing predictive\n\
    irrigation scheduling.\nIn order to demonstrate the applicability of a trained\
    \ LSTM for predictive irrigation scheduling,\nthe AQUACROP model developed by\
    \ the Food and Agricultural Organization was used in simulating\nsoil–plant–atmosphere\
    \ interactions for the potato crop [73–75]. The AQUACROP model has been\nwidely\
    \ validated and is able to simulate soil moisture dynamics and crop response to\
    \ water deﬁcits\nacross various soil types as a function of climatic inputs and\
    \ water availability [76–79].\nClimatic and rainfall data for the model training\
    \ sites were used as inputs into the AQUACROP\nmodel. The LSTM models trained\
    \ for each site was applied in generating a one-day-ahead prediction\nof soil\
    \ moisture content using the climatic data and AQUACROP simulated soil moisture\
    \ as\ninputs. Thereafter, the prediction was used to determine the irrigation\
    \ depth and timing during\nthe AQUACROP simulations. This formed the basis of\
    \ the predictive irrigation system described in\nSection 3.4.1. The AQUACROP soil\
    \ ﬁle was modiﬁed to represent the soil types and characteristics for\nthe model\
    \ training sites as summarized in Table 3. The crop characteristics of the default\
    \ Lima potato\nﬁle was used during the simulations.\nSensors 2018, 18, 3408\n\

    \ system was compared to a rule-based irrigation scheduling system set\nup on\
    \ AQUACROP. The rule-based system was programmed to apply irrigation based on\
    \ speciﬁed\nsoil moisture thresholds and applied water depths to reﬁll the soil\
    \ moisture content to ﬁeld capacity. It\nwas set up as an open-loop system, which\
    \ does not consider soil moisture feedback after irrigation\nevents. It should\
    \ be noted that only data from the evaluation dataset set of the model training\
    \ sites\nwas applied in the simulations.\n3.4.1. Predictive Irrigation Scheduling\
    \ System\nThe goal of irrigation scheduling is to maintain the soil moisture content\
    \ between an upper and\nlower bound. The upper bound is usually defined as the\
    \ field capacity while the lower bound is a point\nabove the permanent wilting\
    \ point expressed a function of the management allowable depletion (MAD).\nIn\
    \ irrigation, it is common practice to express the amount of water retained in\
    \ the plant root zone\n(Wr) as an equivalent depth of soil water (mm of water).\
    \ This is expressed as shown in Equation (14):\nWr = 1000θZr\n(14)\nwhere θ is\
    \ the volumetric soil moisture content, and Zr is the thickness of the root zone\
    \ in meters.\nThe water deﬁcit at time t (DPt) is expressed as shown in Equation\
    \ (15):\nDPt = Wr,FC − Wr,t\n(15)\nwhere Wr,FC is the water depth at ﬁeld capacity,\
    \ and Wr,t is the water depth at time t. It is evident\nfrom Equation (15) that\
    \ the water deﬁcit at the upper bound (DPU) will be zero, i.e., (Wr,FC − Wr,FC).\n\
    The deﬁcit at the lower bound (DPL) is determined from a knowledge of the soils\
    \ available water and\nthe crops MAD. This is expressed as shown in Equations\
    \ (16a) and (16b)\nDPL = Wr,FC − Wr,LB\n(16a)\nwith\nWr,LB = Wr,FC − MAD(Wr,FC\
    \ − Wr,PWP)\n(16b)\nwhere Wr,LB is the water depth at the lower bound, and Wr,PWP\
    \ is the water depth at permanent\nwilting point. DPL will vary over the growth\
    \ season as a result of root growth.\nIf a prediction of the soil volumetric soil\
    \ moisture content at time t + 1 is available from the\nLSTM model, the deﬁcit\
    \ at time t + 1 (DPt+1) can be easily calculated. The irrigation amount is\ncomputed\
    \ as the water application depth that will replenish the water deﬁcit to the upper\
    \ bound i.e.,\nIrrigation = (DPt+1). For close-loop irrigation scheduling, the\
    \ irrigation threshold is set at a safe point\nbelow DPL. The advantage of this\
    \ simpliﬁed irrigation scheduling system is the inclusion of a time\nvariable\
    \ lower bound. Delgoda et al. [65] noted that this is difﬁcult to achieve with\
    \ the optimization\nschemes applied in model predictive control systems. A block\
    \ diagram of the proposed irrigation\nscheduling system is presented in Figure\
    \ 5. Figure 5 shows that soil moisture, precipitation, irrigation,\nand climatic\
    \ data are applied as inputs into a trained LSTM model in order to generate a\
    \ prediction\nof the soil moisture content. The predicted soil moisture content\
    \ is then used in conjunction with\ninformation on crop water requirement and\
    \ soil water retention to determine the irrigation timing\nand amount.\nSensors\
    \ 2018, 18, 3408\n12 of 22\nDuring the simulations, for both the predictive and\
    \ rule-based irrigation scheduling system,\na MAD of 30% was assumed for the potato\
    \ crop and the lower bound was dynamically adjusted as a\nfunction of rooting\
    \ depth growth during the simulated growing season.\n \ntime variable lower bound.\
    \ Delgoda et al. [65] noted that this is difficult to achieve with the \noptimization\
    \ schemes applied in model predictive control systems. A block diagram of the\
    \ \nproposed irrigation scheduling system is presented in Figure 5. Figure 5 shows\
    \ that soil moisture, \nprecipitation, irrigation, and climatic data are applied\
    \ as inputs into a trained LSTM model in order \nto generate a prediction of the\
    \ soil moisture content. The predicted soil moisture content is then \nused in\
    \ conjunction with information on crop water requirement and soil water retention\
    \ to \ndetermine the irrigation timing and amount. \nDuring the simulations, for\
    \ both the predictive and rule-based irrigation scheduling system, a \nMAD of\
    \ 30% was assumed for the potato crop and the lower bound was dynamically adjusted\
    \ as a \nfunction of rooting depth growth during the simulated growing season.\

    \ Criteria \nTo assess the performance of the trained models for the prediction\
    \ of the soil moisture content \nduring the model evaluation, several measures\
    \ of accuracy were applied. The model’s accuracy \nbetween the observed and predicted\
    \ soil moisture content was evaluated using the coefficient of \ndetermination\
    \ (\U0001D445ଶ), root mean squared error (\U0001D445\U0001D440\U0001D446\U0001D438\
    ), and the mean absolute error (\U0001D440\U0001D434\U0001D438). \nThe \U0001D445\
    ଶ describes the proportion of the total variance in the observed data that is\
    \ explained by \nthe model and ranges between ሾ−∞, 1ሿ. A \U0001D445ଶ close to\
    \ 1 indicates that the model explains well the \nvariance of observations. It\
    \ is expressed as \U0001D445ଶ  In Equation (17): \nFigure 5. Block diagram of\
    \ the predictive irrigation scheduling system. t is the time in days, m, n, and\
    \ j\nare past time steps.\n3.5. Model Evaluation Criteria\nTo assess the performance\
    \ of the trained models for the prediction of the soil moisture content\nduring\
    \ the model evaluation, several measures of accuracy were applied. The model’s\
    \ accuracy\nbetween the observed and predicted soil moisture content was evaluated\
    \ using the coefﬁcient of\ndetermination (R2), root mean squared error (RMSE),\
    \ and the mean absolute error (MAE).\nThe R2 describes the proportion of the total\
    \ variance in the observed data that is explained by the\nmodel and ranges between\
    \ [−∞, 1]. A R2 close to 1 indicates that the model explains well the variance\n\
    of observations. It is expressed as R2 In Equation (17):\nR2 = ∑N\ni=1(yi − y)2\
    \ − ∑N\ni=1(yi − ˆyi)2\n∑N\ni=1(yi − y)2\n(17)\nwhere yi is the measured value\
    \ at time i, y is the mean of yi (i = 1 . . . N), and ˆyi is the predicted value\n\
    at time i.\nThe RMSE and MAE quantify the prediction errors in the same units\
    \ of the variables. However,\nthe RMSE strongly penalizes large outliers; as such,\
    \ it is preferable to compliment it with the MAE [80].\nRMSE and MAE values close\
    \ to zero indicate good model predictions. The MAE and RMSE are defined as\nMAE\

    \ content input.\nTable 4 shows that a ﬁrst-order model taking the precipitation,\
    \ climatic variables, and soil moisture\ncontent at the present day as inputs\
    \ is able to predict the soil moisture content of the next day for the\nsandy\
    \ loam (Baluderry) and loam (Stoughton) sites. For the heavier textured clay site\
    \ (Waddeston),\nthe soil moisture content at the next day is dependent on the\
    \ precipitation and soil moisture during\nthe present and previous day. This can\
    \ be explained by the low inﬁltration capacity of heavier textured\nsoils. The\
    \ precipitation input on any day may take a time period greater than a day to\
    \ completely\ninﬁltrate the soil column.\nIt was also found that a single layer\
    \ of neurons and memory blocks in both the FFNN and the\nLSTM is able to satisfactorily\
    \ model the soil moisture dynamics across all the sites. Additional layers\ncould\
    \ not further improve the learning capabilities of both networks. As an example,\
    \ the performance\nof NN models with the same model structure with those listed\
    \ in Table 4 but with two hidden layers\nare presented in Table 5. The two-layer\
    \ models achieve a lower prediction accuracy across all sites.\nMoreover, as part\
    \ of the model training experiments, the best cross-validation performance achieved\
    \ by\nan FFNN, which included only a z-score transformation of the modelled data\
    \ was an R2 value of 0.68.\nTable 5. Training cross-validation performance of\

    \ Prediction\nThe prediction capability of a model is exempliﬁed by its performance\
    \ on data not seen by the\nmodel during training. As such, the prediction capability\
    \ of the models was tested on the evaluation\ndataset set aside for each of the\

    \ average soil moisture content of the three previous days is presented\nin Table\
    \ 6. This is presented along with the prediction performance of the trained NN\
    \ models. A model\nSensors 2018, 18, 3408\n14 of 22\nwill only be accepted as\
    \ skillful if its performance surpasses that of the non-machine learning baseline.\n\
    This is considered a good practice for approaching predictive modelling tasks\
    \ [81].\nTable 6. Prediction performance of the non-machine learning (naïve) and\

    \ the non-machine learning (naïve)\nbaseline across all the sites. Therefore,\
    \ the NN models can be accepted as being skillful. The FFNN\nand LSTM models are\
    \ also shown to achieve a comparable prediction performance across all sites.\n\
    However, it is interesting that the LSTM achieves a comparable performance to\
    \ the FFNN without\nextensive pre-processing of input data. This highlights the\
    \ ability of the LSTM to sufﬁciently learn the\nunderlying function approximating\
    \ dynamic data [51]. This ability is particularly desirable because the\ndata\
    \ pre-processing pipeline applied for the FFNN required subjective human intervention,\
    \ which may\nnot lead to an improvement in model performance for more complex\
    \ dynamic systems.\nThe soil moisture predicted by the FFNN and LSTM models along\
    \ with the observed soil moisture\ncontent for the evaluation dataset is presented\
    \ in Figure 6. Figure 6 shows that the LSTM models are\nable to accurately model\
    \ the soil moisture dynamics while capturing its dominant modes. The LSTM\nmodels\
    \ are also able to respond to perturbation from the precipitation input shown\
    \ in the stem plots.\nAgain, it is clear that the LSTM model is able to achieve\
    \ a performance comparable to that of the FFNN\nwith minimal input data pre-processing.\n\
    There have been previous attempts in literature to model the soil moisture dynamics\
    \ and predict\nthe soil moisture content in order to aid irrigation scheduling.\
    \ Delgoda et al. [25] presented a\nlinear dynamic model with assumptions made\
    \ on the absence of saturation ﬂows. This lead to a\ndegradation in the modelling\
    \ results. The saturation ﬂows are a nonlinear function of the soils\nhydraulic\
    \ properties [29]. The LSTM models presented in this study are able to implicitly\
    \ learn such\nnonlinear relations during training. This is done during the adjustment\
    \ of the network weights in\norder to deﬁne a function relating the climatic and\
    \ precipitation inputs to the soil moisture content.\nSince soil moisture depends\
    \ on the balance between water input and output, saturation ﬂows have\nbeen incorporated\
    \ in the LSTM model. Lozoya et al. [30] highlighted the need to parametrize several\n\
    linear dynamics models for the prediction of soil moisture content for any particular\
    \ site. This was\nattributed to the differing dynamics at saturation, the available\
    \ water content, and that the permanent\nwilting point was not reached. The LSTM\
    \ models are able to model these nonlinearities for the entire\nrange of a site’s\
    \ soil moisture content. The use of a single model for the entire range of operation\n\
    of a process is usually favored for decision support purposes because of the need\
    \ to ensure simple\ndebugging and test procedures [82]. This may become complex\
    \ when several models are used as part\nof a decision support system. This gives\
    \ further evidence in favor of the application of the LSTM\nmodels for the purpose\
    \ of soil moisture prediction and irrigation scheduling.\nSensors 2018, 18, 3408\n\

    \ Sites\nFor the purpose of irrigation scheduling, it may be necessary to predict\
    \ the soil moisture content\nfor a new site for which historical data required\
    \ to train an NN model is not available. The predictions\nwill be generated using\
    \ the climatic and soil variables of the new site as input into a model trained\n\
    exclusively with data from another site. As such, the ability of the LSTM models\
    \ to generate soil\nmoisture predictions for independent sites using models from\
    \ the training sites was evaluated.\nThe prediction performance of the trained\
    \ LSTM and FFNN models for these independent sites\nis presented in Table 7.\n\

    \ shows that the LTSM models generate accurate predictions for the independent\
    \ sites,\nand these predictions outperform those generated by the FFNN in terms\
    \ of R2 scores. This is because of\nthe dynamic nature of the LSTM, which enables\
    \ it to generate predictions as a function of model inputs\nand state maintained\
    \ for a learned past time period. Table 7 also shows that the FFNN is unable to\n\
    achieve a good prediction performance when the model trained in Baluderry was\
    \ applied for prediction\nin Independent Site 1. This may be because the data\
    \ pre-processing steps applied on the training data\nwere not applicable to the\
    \ data of Independent Site 1. This further highlights the robustness of the\n\
    LSTM model, which is able to sufﬁciently learn the underlying function approximating\
    \ the dynamic\ndata. The data in Table 7 demonstrates the excellent approximation\
    \ ability of the LSTM, which makes\nthem useful for generating prediction for\
    \ processes with an underlying dynamics similar to the process\nthey were trained\
    \ on. This approximation ability of the LSTM has been widely exploited in the\
    \ ﬁeld of\ntime series forecasting where a single LSTM model is trained to predict\
    \ data points for a time series\nbelonging a common cluster [83].\nThe applicability\
    \ of data-driven models trained for a particular site for prediction in a different\n\
    site will further enhance the precision water management of various crops. Navarro-Hellín\
    \ et al. [22]\nshowed that models that are able to generalize to new sites not\
    \ included in the model development are\ndifﬁcult to realize using traditional\
    \ machine learning methods. The excellent generalization ability of\nthe LSTM\
    \ presents an opportunity for the development of multi-site soil moisture prediction\
    \ models\nas demonstrated by the robust performance of the LSTM models presented\
    \ in this study when tested\non the independent sites.\n4.4. Application in Predictive\
    \ Irrigation Scheduling\nIn this study, the purpose of modelling the soil moisture\
    \ dynamics is to generate predictions of\nthe volumetric soil moisture content\
    \ which is required for predictive irrigation scheduling. As such,\nthe LSTM model\
    \ developed for each of the training sites was applied as part of a predictive\
    \ irrigation\nscheduling system, which was evaluated alongside a rule-based system\
    \ using AQUACROP simulations\nof the potato-growing season. The resulting soil\
    \ moisture deficit for the predictive and rule-based systems,\nand the lower bound\
    \ deficit during simulations for the three training sites are shown in Figure\
    \ 7.\nIt should be noted that the negative deﬁcit values in Figure 7 indicate\
    \ soil moisture values\nabove the ﬁeld capacity, hence overwatering. Figure 7\
    \ shows that, in the heavy textured clay site\n(Waddeston), the predictive system\
    \ violates the lower bound threshold during the mid-growing season.\nThis occurred\
    \ because the LSTM model applied in predicting the soil moisture content was not\
    \ trained\nspeciﬁcally for the potato crop. The high mid-season water demand of\
    \ potato altered the dynamics\nlearned by the model. Nevertheless, it can be seen\
    \ that the deﬁcits are close to the lower bound\nthreshold and they are later\
    \ minimized. It can also be seen that, across all sites, the rule-based system\n\
    tends to over-irrigate, as indicated by the negative deﬁcit values. Overall, the\
    \ predictive system is able\nto maintain the soil moisture deﬁcits within the\
    \ allowable range and is able to account for the change\nin crop water requirements\
    \ over the growing season.\nSensors 2018, 18, 3408\n17 of 22\nSensors 2018, 18,\

    \ immensely beneﬁt from automated decision support\nsystems that integrate climatic\
    \ and soil moisture measurements with a robust data-driven model of\nthe soil\
    \ moisture dynamics. This technology development will facilitate the prediction\
    \ of crop water\nneeds and an improvement in water conservation.\nThis paper has\
    \ presented a dynamic neural network approach for modelling the time series\n\
    of soil moisture content. The performance of the LSTM for the prediction of soil\
    \ moisture content\nwas evaluated for three sites with different soil characteristics.\
    \ Using an independent evaluation\ndataset, the LSTM models developed for the\
    \ sites achieved accuracies (R2 > 0.94) for a one-day-ahead\nprediction. The LSTM\
    \ models also generated accurate soil moisture predictions for independent sites\n\
    not used in training the models.\nThe use of the LSTM models in predictive irrigation\
    \ scheduling was also demonstrated using\nAQUACROP simulations of the potato-growing\
    \ season. The performance of the proposed predictive\nirrigation scheduling system\
    \ was evaluated by comparing its irrigation policies to those of a rule-based\n\
    system. The predictive system was able to maintain the soil moisture deﬁcit within\
    \ allowable limits\nfor the most part of the simulated growing season while minimizing\
    \ over-irrigation. Furthermore,\nthe predictive system was able to achieve a yield\
    \ and WUE similar to that achieved by the rule-based\nsystem using lower irrigation\
    \ application depths.\nFor future research, the predictive system should be extended\
    \ to include rainfall forecasts.\nThis will ensure that irrigation is optimized\
    \ to further increase water savings through the maximum\nutilization of forecasted\
    \ rainfall depths. The development of crop-speciﬁc LSTM models trained on a\n\
    rich dataset obtained from sites with similar soil types will enhance the adoption\
    \ of data-driven soil\nmoisture models for use in irrigation scheduling applications.\n\

    Get rights and content Highlights • Systematic literature review of IoT applications
    in agro-industry and environment during 2006–2016. • Clustering of IoT applications
    into four domains: monitoring, control, prediction, and logistics. • Visualization
    of key technologies used to develop the IoT applications. • Discussion of trends
    and open challenges. • Proposal of an IoT architecture for agro-industrial and
    environmental applications based on the research findings. Abstract This paper
    reviews agro-industrial and environmental applications that are using Internet
    of Things (IoT). It is motivated by the need to identify application areas, trends,
    architectures and open challenges in these two fields. The underlying survey was
    developed following a systematic literature review using academic documents written
    in English and published in peer-reviewed venues from 2006 to 2016. Selected references
    were clustered into four application domains corresponding to: monitoring, control,
    logistics, and prediction. Implementation-specific details from each selected
    reference were compiled to create usage distributions of sensors, actuators, power
    sources, edge computing modules, communication technologies, storage solutions,
    and visualization strategies. Finally, the results from the review were compiled
    into an IoT architecture that represents a wide range of current solutions in
    agro-industrial and environmental fields. Previous article in issue Next article

    literature review 1. Introduction The widespread of Internet in the last two decades
    brought countless benefits to citizens and organizations around the world. Arguably
    the most important benefit was the ability to consume and produce data and services
    in real time. Recently, the Internet of Things is promising to bring the same
    benefits to everyday objects, giving us a way to extend our perception and our
    ability to modify the environment around us. In this context, agro-industrial
    and environmental fields are ideal candidates for the deployment of IoT solutions
    because they occur in wide areas that need to be continuously monitored and controlled.
    At the same time, IoT opens new opportunities beyond ground floor automation when
    the collected data are used to feed machine learning algorithms to provide predictions
    (Saville et al., 2015), easing decision planning and decision making for owners,
    managers, and policy makers. IoT can be used at different levels in the agro-industrial
    production chain (Medela et al., 2013). It can help to evaluate field variables
    such as soil state, atmospheric conditions, and biomass of plants or animals.
    It can also be used to assess and control variables such as temperature, humidity,
    vibration, and shock during the product transport (Pang et al., 2015). It can
    be used to monitor and predict the product state and its demand on shelves or
    inside refrigerators. In addition, it can provide information to the final user/consumer
    about the origin and properties of the product. The IoT applied to the agro-industry
    can contribute to create an informed, connected, developed and adaptable rural
    community. Under the IoT paradigm, low-cost electronic devices can improve human
    interaction with the physical world, and the computing power and software available
    on the Internet can provide valuable analytics. In summary, IoT can be an important
    tool in the years to come for people interacting within an agro-industrial system:
    suppliers, farmers, technicians, distributors, business men, consumers, and government
    representatives. IoT can be incorporated into environmental applications to produce
    dense and real-time maps of air and water pollution, noise level (Torres-Ruiz
    et al., 2016, Hachem et al., 2015), temperature, and harmful radiation among others.
    It can be used to collect and store environmental records, check the compliance
    of environmental variables with local policies, trigger alerts, or send recommendation
    messages to citizens and authorities (Liu et al., 2013). Once the data reach the
    cloud, governments can feed predictive models to forecast environmental variables,
    and identify and track pollution sources over time and space, ultimately leading
    to faster and better decisions to ensure a safe and healthy environment for all
    citizens. Based on the potential of IoT applications in agro-industrial and environmental
    fields described in the previous paragraphs, this paper aims to identify the current
    state of solutions in these fields, as well as the trends, architectures, technologies
    and open challenges. This paper uses a Systematic Literature Review (SLR) based
    on a methodology proposed by Kitchenham and Charters (2007), in order to make
    it unbiased in terms of information selection, processing, and presentation of
    results. The paper is structured as follows. Sections 2 Planning, 3 Conduction,
    4 Results describe the stages of planning, conduction, and results of the SLR.
    Section 5 outlines some recent works that were published online after the SLR
    was concluded. Section 6 includes a discussion of the obtained results, and Section
    7 presents the conclusions from this study. 2. Planning During this stage of the
    SLR, the protocol was defined. This included: research questions, search strategies,
    selection criteria, data mining and synthesis methodologies. For this study, the
    two research questions considered were: 1. What are the main technological solutions
    of the Internet of Things in agro-industrial and environmental fields? 2. Which
    infrastructure and technology are using the main solutions of IoT in agro-industrial
    and environmental fields? To collect information, authors performed an Internet
    search using various academic digital libraries and search engines. Obtained results
    were manually compiled in order to select the best information sources to answer
    the two research questions. After analyzing the results, digital libraries and
    search engines described in Table 1 were chosen based on their scientific and
    technical content, as well as their close relationship to areas of knowledge associated
    with the objective of this paper. Table 1. Information sources used for the search

    Search Engine https://scholar.google.com/ The next step was to define search terms
    and a consistent procedure to seek scientific and technical documentation in the
    digital libraries and search engines. To define the search terms, a set of keywords
    was selected from the research questions to create two groups of words which are
    shown in Table 2. Each group contained consolidated expressions with synonyms
    or terms with related meaning. Group 1 included words associated with the Internet
    of Things, while Group 2 contained a set of terms related to the agro-industry
    and environment. Logical operators supported by the advanced search of digital
    libraries were used to construct search strings, based on the two research questions,
    combining terms from Groups 1 and 2 of Table 2. The general structure of the search
    queries that were applied to the information sources is presented in Table 3.

    order to ensure the quality of papers, only those that passed the following criteria
    were considered in the reviewing process. • Documents published in peer-reviewed
    conferences, peer-reviewed journals, papers from computer science or engineering
    organizations, patents, or technical reports. • Documents published in English.
    • Documents published between 2006 and 2016 (both years inclusive). If the main
    topic of a given paper was irrelevant or if it was outside the scope of this study,
    it was deleted. Then, a selection criterion was applied in order to reduce the
    number of papers found during the search and to get a small number of high-quality
    sources that could be used to answer the research questions. This involved using
    inclusion criteria (IC) and quality criteria (QC), which were defined in a three-phase
    process. • IC based on abstracts: in this phase, authors discarded papers found
    in the search stage based on the information provided in their abstracts. Papers
    that satisfied the first inclusion criterion were kept for further processing,
    i.e. papers that discussed IoT solutions applied to agro-industry and environment.
    Papers with little relevant information in their abstract were temporarily kept
    in the list and were processed in the next stage. It is important to highlight
    that quality criteria were not considered in this phase. • IC based on full reading:
    in this phase, papers that did not address the search terms shown in Table 2 were
    removed. This means that even though those papers contained the search terms in
    their abstract, they only represented minor aspects of them. • IC based on quality
    analysis: in this phase, a quality analysis was applied to remaining papers and
    those that did not comply any of the following four quality criteria (QC) were
    discarded: – QC1: Does the study present a comprehensive solution of IoT for agro-industry
    or environment? – QC2: Does the paper show details of the infrastructure and/or
    technologies used to implement the proposed solution? – QC3: Does the paper present
    a state of the art or related work? – QC4: Does the paper present an analysis
    of the results? The next stage of the SLR was data mining and synthesis. The goal
    here was to extract the information needed to answer the research questions in
    an objective manner. The information fields extracted for each study are presented
    in Table 4. Table 4. Form used to extract data for each study. Data retrieved

    in the previous section was used to search, select and evaluate preliminary papers.
    For the search process, the query defined in Table 3 was passed to information
    sources given in Table 1. The search was limited to title, abstract and keywords.
    Fig. 1 illustrates the conduction process discriminated by the academic database
    and search engine used, highlighting the key steps followed to select relevant
    studies for this review. Initially, 3578 studies were recovered from electronic
    databases. Firstly, duplicates were excluded, i.e. studies available in more than
    one database, eliminating 849 copies. Out of the 2729 remaining studies, 2652
    were initially screened based on inclusion and exclusion criteria applied to the
    title, abstract, and keywords. These papers were marked to be downloaded, and
    references that could not be retrieved were discarded. Afterward, these studies
    were evaluated using quality criteria obtaining 720 studies. These studies were
    used to extract the data defined in Table 4. Finally, only 72 main studies were
    selected based on their quality for the final conduction phase and used to extract
    results presented in the next section. Download : Download high-res image (236KB)

    main studies. It is worth to note that more than 90% of included papers were retrieved
    from two sources: IEEExplore (76.4%) and Scopus (13.9%). In contrast, the least
    effective sources of information were Microsoft Academic Search and Microsoft
    Academic. They retrieved 668 papers during the first stage of the conduction phase
    (representing 25.2% of all retrieved papers, and only behind IEEExplore with 45%).
    However, only 3.1% of them were included for the next reviewing phase, a number
    well below the 39.8% of papers included from IEEExplore. These facts can be explained
    because IEEExplore and Scopus have complete and usable advanced search systems
    and they have been operating continuously unlike Microsoft’s counterpart (Sinha
    et al., 2015a). Fig. 2 enumerates the number of primary studies classified by
    publication year. It can be seen that most of the selected papers were published
    between 2012 and 2016. It should be highlighted that the small number of papers
    shown in 2016 can be explained because the initial search was made in April of
    that year. Download : Download high-res image (127KB) Download : Download full-size

    results of the SLR in order to answer the two research questions based on the
    information extracted from main studies selected. 4.1. Answer to the first research
    question To identify the main technological solutions of IoT in agro-industry
    and environmental fields, studies were grouped into four technological domains,
    corresponding to: (1) monitoring, (2) control, (3) prediction and (4) logistics.
    Results are summarized in Table 5 and illustrated in Fig. 4. From this figure,
    it can be seen that most of the selected studies were focused on monitoring (62%),
    followed by control (25%), logistics (7%), and prediction (6%). Table 5. Clustering

    image Fig. 4. Distribution of papers selected by application domain. Selected
    papers grouped in the monitoring domain dealt with remote sensing of physical
    and environmental parameters gathered in scenarios such as crops and farms using
    a Wireless Sensor Network (WSN). The main goal of this domain was the acquisition
    of information without an operator and its transmission to a server or data center
    for processing and visualization. Integrated monitoring tools made it possible
    to maintain a continuous communication with the deployed WSN, and access stored
    data through the Internet. Hence, smart agriculture based on IoT adds value to
    farmers by helping them to collect relevant data from crops and farms using sensor
    devices. Some IoT setups could display, process and analyze remote data applying
    cloud services in order to provide new insights and recommendations for better
    decision-making. IoT solutions categorized in monitoring domain can be divided
    into three architectural layers (Zou, 2014): (i) a perception layer supported
    by a WSN; (ii) a network layer where the sensor information travels a long distance
    using different protocols and Gateways, and (iii) an application layer that includes
    a web server and a database. Moreover, IoT solutions grouped in this domain are
    interested in monitoring several types of physical variables depending on the
    subdomain to which they belong. Specifically, the following subdomains were identified:
    air monitoring (34.5%), soil monitoring (27.3%), water monitoring (16.4%), plant
    monitoring (10.9%), and others (10.9%) which include areas such as aquaculture
    and animal monitoring. It is worth to highlight that most of the selected studies
    retrieved in this SLR can be categorized in more than one subdomain. For instance,
    the system proposed in Zou (2014) is used for online crop growth monitoring and
    it captures different types of variables such as: temperature, humidity, soil
    moisture, CO2, luminosity, pH of water, and images. Some representative examples
    of IoT applications categorized in the monitoring domain are described below.
    • Air monitoring: this subdomain aimed to provide periodic or continuous measurements,
    evaluating and determining environmental parameters or pollution levels in order
    to prevent negative and damaging effects. It also included the forecasting of
    possible changes in the ecosystem or the biosphere as a whole. For instance, in
    Watthanawisuth et al. (2009) authors described an agricultural IoT solution which
    can be categorized in the air monitoring subdomain. In this solution, authors
    proposed a real-time monitoring system of micro climate based on a WSN. The solution
    included temperature and relative humidity sensors (SHT15) powered by solar panels
    and supported by ZigBee communication technology. Another air monitoring IoT solution
    is GEMS (Lu et al., 2010), which proposed an environmental monitoring system based
    on GPRS technology for monitoring apple orchards. This system was tested on five
    different regions of China over a 2-year period by monitoring variables such as
    relative humidity, temperature, and radiation. • Soil monitoring: papers classified
    in this subdomain such as (Chen et al., 2014, Mafuta et al., 2012) proposed systems
    for monitoring multi-layer soil temperature and moisture in a farmland fields
    using WSN. These systems are supported by communication technologies such as ZigBee,
    GPRS and Internet, where user interaction with the system is handled by a web
    application. • Water monitoring: primary studies categorized in this subdomain
    intend to monitor water pollution or water quality by sensing chemicals, pH, and
    temperature, which can alter the natural state of water. An example of this subdomain
    is presented in Postolache et al. (2013), where authors proposed an IoT solution
    for water quality assessment through the measurement of conductivity, temperature,
    and turbidity. The solution is based on a WSN architecture that combines low-cost
    sensing devices and monitoring of multiple parameters of water quality of shallow
    waters (lakes, estuaries, rivers) in urban areas. Similarly, (Xijun et al., 2009)
    proposed a WSN system for monitoring water level and rainfall in irrigation systems.
    • Plant monitoring: The LOFAR-agro Project (Langendoen et al., 2006) is an example
    of plant or crop monitoring. This project aimed to protect a potato crop against
    phytophthora (a genus of water mold) by monitoring the microclimate (humidity
    and temperature) using a large-scale WSN. The system intended to generate a policy
    to protect the crop against the fungal disease based on the collected data. In
    Fourati et al. (2014), authors propose a Web-based decision support system communicating
    with a WSN for irrigation scheduling in olive fields. For this purpose, authors
    use sensors to measure humidity, solar radiation, temperature, and rain. • Animal
    monitoring: This subdomain referred to animal tracking for both wildlife and animal
    husbandry activities. A research belonging to this subdomain was a delay-tolerant
    WSN for the monitoring and tracking of six horses presented in Ehsan et al. (2012).
    For this purpose, authors developed necklaces that acquired information about
    horses’ position and speed at a given time, and transmitted such logs to fixed
    nodes when they were close to its coverage area. Another example of animal monitoring
    was given by Jain et al. (2008), where an IoT solution was responsible for monitoring
    the behavior and migration patterns of Swamp Deers, obtaining information of the
    animal position and the climate at the same time. Papers selected and grouped
    under the domain of control use remote actuator devices deployed on-site. Unlike
    monitoring domain applications, which handle information in one-way, applications
    categorized in control use a two-way information channel. This means that a new
    level of communication was added, and commands could be sent back to the field.
    In this case, information from the server or data center traveled to a Wireless
    Sensor and Actuator Network (WSAN) in order to control a set of actuator devices
    to modify the state of the process or environment. Commands were sent through
    a human–computer interface or as a result of a decision algorithm supported by
    analytic modules. Actuator devices included valves, pumps, humidifiers, and alarms
    among others. Many of these systems aimed to optimize the usage of water, fertilizers,
    and pesticides based on information provided by weather prediction systems and
    on-site WSN. Solutions in this domain could help farmers to reduce water consumption
    and waste by scheduling irrigation times and quantities according to the state
    of the crop and its growth cycle. Control systems were programmed to be adaptive,
    for instance, switching off sprinkler if rain was detected. Overall, solutions
    with control systems could save money to the farmer and provide at the same time
    valuable insights about the consumption of water, fertilizers, pesticides, and
    electricity. Actuator devices used by IoT solutions grouped in the control domain
    depended heavily on the subdomain to which they belonged. In this paper, the following
    subdomains were considered: irrigation (72.22%), fertilizers (5.56%), pesticides
    (5.56%), illumination (5.56%), and access control (5.56%). During the review,
    it was found that some studies used actuators in the domain of logistics (5.56%).
    Representative examples of IoT applications categorized in the control domain
    are described next. • Irrigation control: A precision irrigation solution based
    on wireless sensor network was proposed by Kanoun et al. (2014). The main challenge
    of that study was to create an automated irrigation system which could reduce
    water waste, saving energy, time, and money. This system was built using three
    nodes based on the TelosB mote: (i) a node to measure soil moisture and soil temperature;
    (ii) a node to measure environmental parameters such as air temperature, air humidity,
    wind speed and brightness; and (iii) a node that was connected to a valve for
    irrigation control. Data were transmitted to a base station for storage and were
    sent to the farmer’s PC to allow him to take action. Another precision irrigation
    IoT system was proposed by Jiao et al. (2014). This included an environmental
    monitoring system for agricultural management, as well as the implementation of
    precision dripping. The system considered an IoT ecosystem divided into three
    layers corresponding to sensing, transmission, and application. A WSN was used
    to perceive environmental information in real time within a tomato greenhouse,
    to later transmit the data to a remote server management system. In Shuwen and
    Changli (2015) researchers described a remote farmland irrigation monitoring solution
    based on ZigBee. The system included a solar-powered irrigation control system
    that also monitored air temperature, humidity and soil temperature. • Fertilizer
    and pesticide control: IoT solutions categorized in this subdomain applied conservation
    practices to improve nutrient usage, efficiency, crop quality, overall yield,
    and economic return while reducing off-site transport of nutrients. In Pahuja
    et al. (2013), authors developed an online micro-climate monitoring and control
    system for greenhouses. The system was supported by a WSN to gather and analyze
    plant-related sensor data to produce actions to control the climate, fertilization,
    irrigation, and pests. • Illumination control: authors in Yoo et al. (2007) described
    an automated agriculture system based on WSN for monitoring greenhouses used to
    grow melons and cabbages. The system monitored the growing process of crops and
    controlled the greenhouse’s environment. Some of the variables measured included
    ambient light, temperature, and humidity. For the greenhouse with melons, the
    system could control the illumination by changing the light state through a relay.
    • Access control: An agricultural intrusion detection system was presented in
    Roy et al. (2015). The proposed system generated alarms in the farmers house and
    sent a text message to the farmer’s mobile phone when an intruder entered the
    crop field. Selected papers categorized in the prediction domain were focused
    on providing knowledge and tools to farmers to support decision making. They had
    specific modules for these tasks in their architecture, and their predicted variables
    were grouped as follows: environmental conditions (42.86%), production estimation
    (42.86%), and crop growth (14.29%). • Environmental conditions: A representative
    example of environmental condition prediction is proposed in Khandani and Kalantari
    (2009), where authors described a design methodology to determine the spatial
    sampling of humidity sensors for the soil within a WSN. They used a historical
    database of dense soil-humidity measurements to determine the behavior of the
    2D correlation that exists between the measurements of nearby sensors. This was
    used later to find the largest spatial sampling that ensured a user-defined variance
    for the estimation on any given point of interest in the space. Authors found
    that the spatial correlation function decays exponentially with the distance between
    sensors. Another example of the prediction of environmental conditions was presented
    in Luan et al. (2015), which described a system that integrates drought monitoring
    and forecasting as well as irrigation prediction using IoT. • Production estimation:
    Authors in Lee et al. (2013) presented an IoT-based agricultural production system
    for stabilizing supply and demand of agricultural products. They achieved this
    goal by sensing environmental variables and by developing a prediction system
    for the growth and yield of crops. In a different application, (Saville et al.,
    2015) introduced a real-time estimation system for fixed-net fishery using ultrasonic
    sensors and supervised learning. • Crop growth: a dynamic analysis of farmlands
    using mobile sensors was presented in Lee et al. (2012). The developed system
    aimed to establish growth-control plans for grapes, and viticulture activities.
    The last domain used to categorize selected studies was logistics. Logistics in
    agriculture refers to the physical flow of entities and related information from
    producer to consumer to satisfy consumer demand. It includes: agricultural production,
    acquisition, transportation, storage, loading and unloading, handling, packaging,
    distribution, and related activities. Some objectives of logistics in agriculture
    include: adding value to agricultural products, saving money in distribution costs,
    improving shipping efficiency, reducing unnecessary losses, and to some extent,
    avoiding risks (Liping, 2012). Primary studies in logistics were further divided
    in: production (55.6%), commerce (22.2%) and transport(22.2%). The next paragraphs
    include representative studies of each subdomain. • Production: in Feng et al.
    (2012) researchers proposed an intelligent system for monitoring an apple orchard
    that implemented suggestions based on data. The system aimed to reduce management
    costs of apple orchards, improve apple quality, and provide detailed, comprehensive
    and accurate electronic information for planting works, pest warnings, and production-quality
    tracking of apples. The system included WSN using Zigbee, GPRS, and IoT providing
    detailed monitoring data of apple growth for agricultural cooperatives, to support
    for decision making in farming. • Commerce: (Li et al., 2013) presented an information
    system for agriculture based on IoT which used a distributed architecture. In
    that study, tracking and tracing of the whole agricultural production process
    were made with distributed IoT servers. Moreover, an information-discovery system
    was designed to implement, capture, standardize, manage, locate, and query business
    data from agricultural production. The system also allowed consumers to query
    information of agricultural products to verify their authenticity and quality.
    • Transport: A representative example of this subdomain is presented in Pang et
    al. (2015), where an IoT architecture was proposed for the food-production and
    commercialization chain. This paper dealt with logistics involved in the transportation
    of melons from Brazil to Sweden in a journey that takes 46 days. Sensor nodes
    measured conditions in the environment including oxygen, carbon dioxide, ethylene,
    temperature, humidity, and mechanical stress, such as vibrations, tilts, and shocks.

    Infrastructure and technology used by selected IoT solutions in agro-industrial
    and environmental fields were organized in seven groups, corresponding to: (i)
    sensing variables, (ii) actuator devices, (iii) power sources, (iv) communication
    technologies, (v) edge computing technologies (Shi et al., 2016), (vi) storage
    strategies, and (vii) visualization strategies. • Sensing variables: about 26%
    of analyzed studies sense temperature, followed by humidity, physicochemical properties,
    and radiation with 16%, 11%, and 10%, respectively. Particularly, temperature
    and physicochemical sensors are distributed in all subdomains as it can be seen
    in Fig. 6. Similarly, 55% of sensors are used for air monitoring. Thus, air temperature
    and humidity, soil moisture and solar radiation, can be considered universal variables
    in agricultural applications. Download : Download high-res image (324KB) Download

    studies is shown in Fig. 7. It can be stated that there are far fewer actuator
    devices than sensors currently being used in these studies and that most of them
    are concentrated in applications of control and logistics. In fact, more than
    60% of actuators reported were found in irrigation processes. Download : Download

    device used. • Power sources: currently, most monitoring applications prefer rechargeable
    batteries connected to solar panels, which offer a simple but sustainable energy
    supply. In contrast, control applications that typically have demanding energy
    requirements prefer the electrical grid. These trends can be appreciated in Fig.
    8. Recent power sources, such as electromagnetic or vibration harvesters were
    not found in selected studies showing that these approaches must mature and gain
    popularity for agricultural and environmental applications. Download : Download

    • Communication technologies: Fig. 9 shows that most studies (40%) used Wireless
    Personal Area Network (WPAN) protocols such as Bluetooth and ZigBee, followed
    by Wireless Metropolitan Area Network (WMAN) with 36% of the studies mainly supported
    by cellular technologies (GPRS/GSM/3G/4G). Meanwhile, the near-field communication,
    which is relatively new, has started to emerge in some field applications. Download

    technologies. • Edge computing technologies: microcontroller platforms were chosen
    in more than half of the applications reviewed. Interestingly, Single Board Computers
    (SBC) are not yet appropriate for edge computing in IoT agricultural applications.
    The complete distribution of edge computing technologies is shown in Fig. 10.

    it is clear that even though Cloud storage represents a key service for IoT systems,
    only 7.32% of selected studies used it. This shows that most researchers preferred
    their own data-storage implementation. Download : Download high-res image (78KB)

    strategies: Fig. 12 shows the distribution of three different visualization strategies:

    logistics. It can be stated that web-based solutions were the preferred strategy
    to visualize reports in all subdomains of applications. Download : Download high-res

    Most of the selected works do not address security issues explicitly and leave
    them on a side. However, some efforts in this domain were found. For instance,
    (Jardak et al., 2009) described the design of a WSN that implemented a RANdom
    SAmple Consensus (RANSAC) filter to eliminate inconsistent sensor-node data due
    to the presence of faulty or malicious nodes in the network. Sun et al. (2012)
    presented a dam monitoring system where users needed to sign in through the main
    interface in order to validate their credentials. Tao et al. (2014) selected AppWeb
    as the embedded Web server for the IoT Gateway of an intelligent granary management
    system because it could add the Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) protocol to enable
    encrypted data connection. This was valuable because the network information was
    vulnerable as it came from a wireless channel. Kuroda et al. (2015) proposed a
    WSN with easy-to-use secure communication that was implemented using Zero-admin
    encrypt/decrypt functions at the MAC level with the Advanced Encryption Standard
    (AES-128), which enabled automatic encryption/decryption of messages between each
    sensor node and the coordinator node. 5. Recent works The following paragraphs
    are devoted to introducing some recent and representative works that were available
    online between May 2016 and July 2017, beyond the initial scope of the SLR process
    described so far. They cover areas such as communications, energy management,
    monitoring and logistics for agro-industrial and environmental applications. 5.1.
    Communications Low-power WAN (LPWAN) technologies such as SigFox, LoRa, narrowband
    IoT and others are becoming popular within IoT applications due to its reduced
    energy requirements, wide coverage range, and low-cost when compared to other
    long-distance technologies according to Barrachina-Muñoz et al. (2017). For example,
    in a recent survey by Sinha et al. (2017), authors found that LoRa is the best
    option for smart agriculture applications. In Lukas et al. (2015), authors designed
    a long-range water level monitoring system for troughs using a WSN based on LoRa
    transceivers, allowing the cattleman to observe water availability for livestock
    even when the barn was 1 or 3 km away. In a different application, (Pham et al.,
    2016) proposed an IoT framework to contribute to rural development implementing
    agricultural applications supported by open-source hardware and long-range communication
    devices. The first deployment of this solution used LoRa transceivers since rural
    villages were located in remote areas and it was convenient to have a low-cost
    and non-proprietary infrastructure. 5.2. Energy management One of the main requirements
    for devices used in IoT projects is that they must be energy-efficient according
    to Borgia (2014). This is particularly important for pervasive solutions deployed
    outdoors that can not be powered from the electric grid nor regularly maintained
    because they are installed in difficult or remote environments. In WSN scenarios,
    the current challenge is to develop multi-source energy harvesters and ultra-efficient
    sensors to create battery-free solutions, (Shaikh and Zeadally, 2016). These considerations
    are very important for IoT solutions for agro-industrial and environmental problems
    as recharging batteries is not practical and ambient energy sources are usually
    available. In terms of smart energy control for IoT projects, (Wang et al., 2016)
    proposed a novel energy management strategy for solar powered devices that intend
    to power the load directly from the solar cell, avoiding power converters and
    energy storage elements that contribute to energy losses, greater weight/volume
    ratio, and higher price. Another trend that is likely to continue is the development
    of self-power devices, such as the soil water content sensor for an autonomous
    landslide surveillance system designed by Lu et al. (2016). In this case, the
    sensor used the soil moisture to power itself making it suitable for large scale
    deployments. Marjanović et al. (2016) described a cloud-based decision-making
    mechanism for managing sensor data acquisition that is applicable to collaborative
    sensing solutions using distributed sensors, like mobile devices, to efficiently
    monitor large geographical areas. The system selected which sensors had to upload
    the information to the cloud to prevent the acquisition of redundant information
    from other nearby sensors for a specific coverage area, maintaining a spatial
    sampling quality and reducing in this way the battery depletion of the devices.
    5.3. Monitoring Recent environmental monitoring solutions are now offering additional
    capabilities in terms of decision making and management. For example, (Giorgetti
    et al., 2016) proposed a custom-made landslide risk monitoring system based on
    a WSN that allows fast deployments in hostile environments without human intervention
    because the system is able to deal with node failure and poor-quality communication
    links reorganizing the network by itself. Wong and Kerkez (2016) presented a Web
    service and real-time data architecture that includes an adaptive controller that
    updates the parameters of each sensing node within a WSN based on a previously
    defined policy. Zheng et al. (2016) proposed an IoT management system to protect
    the ecological and environmental quality while building an artificial river where
    nature and city converge. The system monitored key elements like soil, water,
    atmosphere, and wind at a high spatial resolution over a large area. Edwards-Murphy
    et al. (2016) introduced a beehive monitoring system that collects internal and
    external data to describe the status of the bee colony from a set of possible
    states using a classification algorithm based on decision trees. This information
    was used to determine if a visit to the beehive was required or not. As an additional
    result, authors found a strong correlation between the beehive status and the
    short-term rain forecast. Overall, this study is relevant for agriculture because
    crop pollination depends on honey bees. Sarangi et al. (2016) presented a framework
    for an automated crop-disease advisory service that integrates the interoperability
    of an IoT web repository with an agricultural advisory call center. The implemented
    system processes images of the diseased plant sent by the farmer, and then it
    provides the plant diagnosis and the corresponding management recommendation for
    the disease. 5.4. Logistics Food safety and quality control in logistics are emerging
    as IoT agribusiness areas in response to the demand from businesses and end consumers
    to obtain real-time information about food supply chain and “farm-to-fork” traceability.
    For instance, (Ruan and Shi, 2016) presented an IoT framework to assess the fruit
    freshness on e-commerce deliveries, which is a non-traditional retail service
    that faces unique challenges in transportation due to the product perishability
    and expensive logistics. Similarly, (Liu et al., 2016) introduced a pilot project
    using IoT to monitor food safety throughout the product life cycle, helping authorities
    and consumers to trace the food and make better decisions before buying it. In
    a related work, (Wang and Yue, 2017) proposed an early-warning system for food
    safety that automatically warns about product quality risks and incidents by sharing
    and centralizing information among supply chains. Lastly, (Capello et al., 2016)
    developed a business-to-business monitoring service based on IoT that provides
    geo-located information (humidity and temperature) about food storage and transportation
    without a vendor lock-in infrastructure. 6. Discussion 6.1. Limitations and open
    challenges After analyzing the difficulties and limitations described in selected
    papers from the SLR, the following list summarizes a few insights that aim to
    contribute to the mass adoption of IoT solutions in agricultural and environmental
    fields. • Stronger standardization: it will help to improve compatibility among
    different vendors and to ensure stronger security measures across the entire IoT
    stack, starting from field devices all the way up to cloud providers and end-user
    interfaces (Pang et al., 2015). • Better power management: it will increase the
    endurance of IoT solutions because nowadays the main factor limiting the lifespan
    of IoT deployments is energy depletion (Jain et al., 2008, Chen et al., 2014,
    Islam et al., 2014, Diedrichs et al., 2014). The lifespan can be improved by lowering
    the power consumption of each electronic module, including energy harvesters,
    and using alternative power storage mechanisms as replacements of rechargeable
    batteries, which affect the expiration date of deployed devices. • Security: a
    major challenge in the realization of the IoT in agriculture is the security problem
    (Jiang and Zhang, 2013), and the few works that consider it only incorporate fragmented
    strategies to mitigate it. Therefore, it is evident that there is a need for agro-industrial
    and environmental IoT solutions that address end-to-end information security and
    physical integrity of field devices. • Design using modular hardware and software:
    it will enable a greater degree of reuse and customization for the end user (Pang
    et al., 2015). • Improve unit cost: even though the cost of embedded computing
    platforms have been decreasing sharply, the same is not true for high-quality
    sensors and actuators. In order to deploy IoT solutions with hundreds and possibly
    thousands of nodes, the overall hardware, Internet access and international data
    roaming costs have to be reduced even further (Pang et al., 2015). • Aim for a
    good compatibility with legacy infrastructure: similarly to what has happened
    in industrial automation, it is important to deliver IoT solutions that can be
    integrated with the customer’s existing infrastructure such as specialized equipment,
    field machines, and software. • Consider scalability early on: with an increasing
    number of devices in large deployments, data synchronization and data reliability
    become critical (Diedrichs et al., 2014). • Adopt good practices of software engineering:
    as the scale and endurance of deployed IoT solutions grow, the time and effort
    devoted to analyzing generated data, refining the code, and adding new features
    will explode unless the software is well designed and documented (Hussain et al.,
    2006, Jayaraman et al., 2015a). • Improve robustness for field deployments: commercial
    IoT solution should be able to handle strong changes in temperature, humidity,
    and illumination to deal with seasonal changes and worldwide climate variability.
    • User-centered design: the installation and management of corresponding IoT nodes
    should be straight forward for non-expert users. Additionally, the hardware must
    require very little or none human maintenance during its lifespan, and the underlying
    communication network should be intelligent enough to reconfigure or heal itself
    in the case of a node failure. • Contribute to the IoT the ecosystem: there is
    a noticeable void in the literature on how to improve and adapt IoT solutions
    for real-world applications beyond simple prototypes (Chen et al., 2015). • Sustainable
    practices: even if the most humble predictions about the worldwide adoption of
    IoT devices become a reality, recycling strategies will have to be taken into
    account for new solutions deployed on the field, as an integral part of the product
    life cycle to reduce the environmental impact. 6.2. Proposed architecture To summarize
    the findings of this study, authors proposed the IoT architecture for agro-industrial
    and environmental applications that is illustrated in Fig. 13. This encapsulates
    most of the studies analyzed in this paper. The architecture has four main layers:
    physical, communication, service, and application. The physical layer includes
    perception and control. In perception, the main objective is to produce valuable
    data sensing field variables using a WSN. Data produced are sent to the communication
    layer through field gateways. Devices in the perception layer can be powered by
    batteries for short-term deployments or by solar panels because of their low-power
    consumption. In contrast, the control layer acts as a data sink, receiving information
    from a communication layer or a perception layer in the simplest case. Information
    received in the control layer alters the state of field actuators frequently requiring
    power from the electrical grid. In the middle of the perception and control layers
    there is a mobile robot that can be used when fixed devices are not the best option.
    In the communication layer, the objective is to move the information from the
    physical layer to the Internet, collecting data from IoT gateways based either
    on Ethernet or mobile networks (e.g: GPRS/3G/4G/NB-IoT and eventually 5G). This
    layer includes field gateways acting as interfaces between IoT gateways and transceivers
    using ZigBee, Bluetooth, NFC, WiFi, LoRA, or Sigfox. The service layer handles
    data ingestion from the communication layer, as well as their storage, analytics,
    visualization, and security. Finally, the application layer consumes services
    from the previous layer in the architecture and allows the user to handle monitoring,
    control, prediction, and logistics. Download : Download high-res image (717KB)

    and environmental applications. 7. Conclusions This paper presented an updated
    review of IoT applications for agro-industrial and environmental fields. It was
    guided by a systematic literature review, and therefore the methodology and intermediate
    results obtained during the stages of planning, conduction, and results were reported
    in great detail. From 3578 initial studies extracted from electronic sources,
    72 main studies were selected based on their relevance to answer two research
    questions. Selected studies came from five continents, and Asian countries contributed
    to more than half of them. During this study, it was discovered that most of the
    research still focuses on monitoring applications (62%); however there is a growing
    interest in closing the loop by doing control (25%), and there are some preliminary
    solutions in logistics and prediction (13%) for agro-industrial and environmental
    applications using IoT. The temperature and humidity of the air, as well as the
    soil moisture and solar radiation can be recognized as universal variables measured
    in agricultural applications based on selected studies. Similarly, actuators such
    as valves, pumps, motors, sprinklers, humidifiers, and lamps were widely used
    in irrigation, fertilization, pesticide management, and illumination control.
    It was also observed that new energy sources and Cloud storage have not been widely
    adopted, showing that there are opportunities for research and development in
    these areas. Studies included in this paper provide a compact view of solutions
    proposed for agro-industrial and environmental problems during the last decade.
    It was found that most of them relied heavily on heterogeneous components and
    wireless sensor networks. However, it seems reasonable to assume that future solutions
    will need to fully embrace Cloud services and new ways of connectivity in order
    to get the benefits of a truly connected and smart IoT ecosystem. Acknowledgements

    Keywords Metrics Abstract: Agriculture plays a vital role in the economic growth
    of any country. With the increase of population, frequent changes in climatic
    conditions and limited resources, it becomes a challenging task to fulfil the
    food requirement of the present population. Precision agriculture also known as
    smart farming have emerged as an innovative tool to address current challenges
    in agricultural sustainability. The mechanism that drives this cutting edge technology
    is machine learning (ML). It gives the machine ability to learn without being
    explicitly programmed. ML together with IoT (Internet of Things) enabled farm
    machinery are key components of the next agriculture revolution. In this article,
    authors present a systematic review of ML applications in the field of agriculture.
    The areas that are focused are prediction of soil parameters such as organic carbon
    and moisture content, crop yield prediction, disease and weed detection in crops
    and species detection. ML with computer vision are reviewed for the classification
    of a different set of crop images in order to monitor the crop quality and yield
    assessment. This approach can be integrated for enhanced livestock production
    by predicting fertility patterns, diagnosing eating disorders, cattle behaviour
    based on ML models using data collected by collar sensors, etc. Intelligent irrigation
    which includes drip irrigation and intelligent harvesting techniques are also
    reviewed that reduces human labour to a great extent. This article demonstrates
    how knowledge-based agriculture can improve the sustainable productivity and quality
    of the product. A graphical abstract for Machine Learning Applications for Precision

    Bluetooth Low Energy SECTION I. Introduction The population of the world will
    increase to 9.1 billion approximately thirty-four percent as of today by the end
    of 2050. Food requirement will increase by 70 percent and due to rapid urbanization,
    land availability for agriculture will decrease drastically in the coming years.
    India will be the most populated country by 2050 and presently it is already lagging
    the domestic food production. The main reason for reduced food production is the
    lack of planning, unpredictable weather conditions, improper harvesting and irrigation
    techniques and livestock mismanagement. In the last few years, nature has experienced
    a drastic change in weather conditions due to global warming. The average temperature
    of the earth has been increased due to which there is uncertainty in climatic
    conditions. Frequent droughts, heavy rainfall are the biggest challenge for poor
    farmers. According to the government of India annual economic survey, adverse
    climatic conditions, reduce the farmer’s income by 20-25%. Precision agriculture
    [1], [2] is one of the solutions to ensure food security for the entire world
    [3]. Precision agriculture also abbreviated as digital agriculture is a technology-enabled
    data-driven sustainable farm management system. It is basically the adoption of
    modern information technologies, software tools, and smart embedded devices for
    decision support in agriculture [4] as shown in figure 1. Mechanized agriculture
    and the green revolution are the two key components of the first and second agriculture
    revolution. Precision farming is an important part of the third agriculture revolution
    [5]. FIGURE 1. Precision agriculture. Show All John Deere introduced this technology
    in 1990 for the sowing of seeds and spraying of fertilizers using global positioning
    system (GPS) controlled tractors. The main focus of precision farming is to reduce
    the production cost and environmental effects to increase the farm’s profitability.
    Digital technologies such as IoT [6], AI, data analytics, cloud computing, and
    block-chain technology play a key role in precision agriculture. In precision
    farming, IoT based smart sensors are deployed in the agriculture land for collecting
    data related to soil nutrients, fertilizers, and water requirements as well as
    for analysing the crop growth. Autonomous and semi-autonomous devices such as
    an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) [7] and robots are used for identifying weed
    and disease in the plants using computer vision techniques. Satellite images are
    also used in precision agriculture for monitoring the field and identifying the
    diseases in the plants. The data obtained from the deployed sensors [8] are processed
    and analyzed using ML algorithms to make farming practice more controlled and
    optimized. ML algorithms are also used for weather and rainfall prediction based
    on the data obtained from sensors, climatic records, and satellite images. This
    could save the lives of thousands of farmers who commit suicide because of crop
    loss due to uncertainty in weather conditions. Smart livestock management is an
    important component of precision agriculture. It helps in monitoring the health,
    welfare, productivity, and reproduction of animals throughout their life cycle.
    Sensors and cameras monitor animal’s health and computer vision techniques help
    in making intelligent decisions such as stopping the communal spread of diseases.
    Autonomous tractors and automated irrigation systems provide modern farming solutions
    to farmers. The widespread utilization of precision farming across the world is
    due to the presence of innovative machine and deep learning (DL) algorithms, high-speed
    internet access, and efficient computational devices. In [10] authors have discussed
    applications of ML for sustainable agriculture supply chain (ASC) performance.
    Authors have presented a unique ML-ASC framework that can guide researchers and
    agriculture practitioners to understand the role and importance of digital technologies
    in the agriculture industry. In [11] authors reviewed different ML applications
    in agriculture and discussed how digital technologies will benefit the agriculture
    industry. In this paper, the authors have presented a comprehensive review of
    the ML application for precision agriculture. This review article will provide
    an insight into the research community about the adoption of digital practices
    in the agriculture management system. It is anticipated that government agencies
    will frame policies to promote precision farming across the world. The main contribution
    of the article is outlined as follows: Applications of artificial intelligence
    and IoT in precision agriculture are discussed along with their practical implications.
    Foundation of ML and DL algorithms which find their application in precision agriculture

    farming has been carried out based on the state-of-art literature. Assessment

    with its statistical and performance analysis. Comparison of performance parameters
    of sensors used in IoT applications in precision agriculture is presented. Integration
    of wireless sensor network (WSN) with IoT and artificial intelligence in precision
    agriculture is discussed. Challenges and future trends of artificial intelligence
    in precision farming are briefly outlined. Table 1 highlights the major differences
    of this review article with other articles published in this field. The paper

    the paper. TABLE 1 Key Differences of the Article With Published Articles SECTION
    II. Impact of Artificial Intelligence and IoT in Agriculture The term AI was first
    coined in the Dartmouth conference in the year 1956 by John McCarthy and he defined
    it as a science and engineering of making intelligent machines or more specifically
    intelligent computer programs. AI technology provides computational intelligence
    to machines so that they can learn, understand and react according to the situation.
    ML, DL, natural language processing (NLP), swarm intelligence (SI), expert systems,
    fuzzy logic, and computer vision are the subfields of AI as shown in figure 2.
    This field finds endless applications across different sectors of human life.
    Intelligent AI programs are widely explored in health-care, agriculture, finance,
    robotics, e-commerce and the automation industry. Samsung, Apple, and other electronics
    giant companies announced that they will be utilizing this technology in every
    device they will manufacture in the near future. IoT is another emerging technology
    in which smart sensors, devices are interconnected through the internet. These
    smart sensors can be utilized to gather data across different disciplines such
    as solar plants, agriculture fields, disaster-prone areas, manufacturing industry
    for efficient resource utilization. With the increase in population over the year’s
    demand for agriculture products is increasing day by day. However, with limited
    land availability for farming and reduce interest among the young generation to
    adopt farming as their profession, it has become a challenging task for the agriculture
    industry to satisfy the food requirement of millions of people. Now, the agriculture
    industry is widely adopting smart technologies like IoT and AI to efficiently
    cultivate organic products in limited land areas as well as to overcome the traditional
    challenges of farmers. FIGURE 2. Artificial intelligence techniques. Show All
    IoT based smart farming system is built for monitoring soil nutrients and soil
    moisture using sensors. ML algorithms are explored for determining the optimum
    amount of fertilizers required for soils before the sowing of crops. Drones are
    revolutionizing the agriculture industry. These drones are cameras enabled and
    are used for different applications such as field and crop monitoring, spraying
    of pesticides, and drip irrigation. The images captured by the drones over the
    entire lifecycle of crops can be examined using DL and computer vision algorithms
    for disease and weed identification. Thereafter, these drones are used for spraying
    pesticides over the weeds and infected crops. Over the years uncertainty in weather
    conditions is the main concern of farmers. Drip irrigation using drones is an
    efficient AI-empowered irrigation system which is basically trained on weather
    pattern and can effectively reduce the water problems of farmers. AI-enabled robots
    can be used for harvesting the crops at a much faster pace and in large volumes.
    Robots can reduce human labour to a large extent and can be used along with drones
    for monitoring the field. Livestock management is another major concern for farmers.
    IoT based sensors can be deployed in the field for health monitoring of cattle.
    This information can be utilized for protecting the bunch of cattle from diseased
    cattle. NLP based virtual assistant applications like chatbots can update the
    farmers with the latest advancement in technologies for agriculture. Farmers can
    finds solutions for their problems and incorporate the latest technology in their
    farming for improving their field productivity. Thus, AI and IoT are the two major
    technologies that will play a vital role in the agriculture industry. SECTION
    III. Machine Learning Algorithms ML is the subfield of computer science that gives
    computers the ability to learn without being explicitly programmed. (Arthur Samuel,
    1959) [12]. Alan Turing in the year 1950 proposed the concept of learning machines
    and wrote a research article “The Turing Test for Machine Intelligence” [13].
    He performed a test and examined the machine’s ability to demonstrate intelligent
    behaviour similar to humans. A machine or intelligent computer program learns
    and extract knowledge from the data, builds a framework for making predictions
    or intelligent decisions. Thus, the ML process is divided into three key parts,
    i.e. data input, model building, and generalization as shown in figure 3. Generalization
    is the process for predicting the output for the inputs with which the algorithm
    has not been trained before. ML algorithms are mainly used to solve complex problems
    where human expertise fails such as weather prediction, spam filtering, disease
    identification in plants, pattern recognition. FIGURE 3. A Machine learning process.
    Show All Today, due to the availability of innovative algorithms and large data
    sets through internet resources industries and research communities are widely
    using ML algorithms for solving a diverse set of problems. DL is the subfield
    of the family of ML algorithms which is trained from large sets and uses an artificial
    neural network (ANN) to make intelligent decisions. ML algorithms are categorized
    as supervised learning, unsupervised learning, and reinforcement learning as shown
    in figure 4. Supervised learning as the name suggests is learning with the supervisor
    or teacher. This set of algorithms works with labeled data-set which means corresponding
    to each input there are outputs. The algorithm builds an input-output relationship
    with this labeled data set and thereafter generalize or predicts outputs for unseen
    inputs. Supervised learning algorithms used for predicting the categorical value
    are known as classification algorithms and the algorithms that are used for predicting
    the numerical value are known as regression algorithms. Unsupervised learning
    algorithms works with unlabelled data and discovers unknown objects by grouping
    similar objects. The goal of an unsupervised learning algorithm is to extract
    hidden knowledge from the training data set thus this approach is difficult to
    implement than supervised learning algorithms. Reinforcement learning is another
    approach that learns from the environment through reward and punishment. AlphaGo,
    a chess-playing game developed by DeepMind utilized reinforcement learning for
    defeating the world’s best chess-playing computer program. FIGURE 4. Categorization
    of machine learning algorithms. Show All In this paper the performance of different
    ML algorithms are analysed and discussed in the field of agriculture. Table 2
    presents different types of supervised, unsupervised and reinforcement learning
    algorithms utilized for soil and weather prediction, disease and weed identification,
    intelligent irrigation and harvesting techniques as well as livestock management.
    TABLE 2 Machine Learning Algorithms SECTION IV. Machine Learning Applications
    in Precision Agriculture In many countries, the farmers rely on the traditional
    ways of farming which is based on the reliability of the suggestions from the
    elderly and their experience. This method leaves farmers at the mercy of random
    climatic conditions which are already getting random due to global warming and
    uneven rainfall patterns. The manual spraying method for pesticides led to improper
    usage of resources and harms the environment. AI and IoT enabled precision agriculture
    removes the randomness and assist new age farmer to optimize every step of the
    farming process. Figure 5 (a) and (b) presents a pictorial view of traditional
    agriculture and technology enabled farm management system. FIGURE 5. (a) Traditional
    agriculture cycle (b) Precision agriculture cycle. Show All Gaitán [14] provided
    a systematic study of the impact of extreme weather events, such as hail events,
    cold waves, heat waves, and their impact on agricultural practices. The author
    reported floods, droughts, frost, hail, heatwaves, and pest outbreaks are impacted
    by climatic conditions. The AI systems are applicable in each farming operation
    as depicted in figure 4 and some of them even extend beyond the conventionally
    recognized steps. In this section we will discuss the state of art techniques
    proposed/implemented by various researchers and practitioners worldwide. A. Soil
    Properties and Weather Prediction Prediction of soil properties is the first and
    the most crucial step which influences the selection of crop, land preparation,
    selection of seed, crop yield, and selection of fertilizers /manure. The soil
    properties are directly related to the geographic and climatic conditions of the
    land in use and hence is an important factor to take into consideration. The soil
    properties prediction mostly consists of predicting nutrients in the soil, soil
    surface humidity, weather conditions during the lifecycle of the crop. Human activities
    have highly affected the properties of soil and hence our ability to cultivate
    the crops [15]. In general, there are 17 essential elements as listed in table
    3 which play an important role in plant growth [16]. The growth of crops depends
    on the nutrients available in a particular soil. The soil nutrients are mostly
    monitored by electric and electromagnetic sensors [8]. Depending on the nutrients
    farmers make informed decisions as to which crop is optimal for the land. However,
    the nutrients can be added through fertilizers, manure, etc. but with an additional
    cost. Some of them may also damage the environment and have an adverse effect
    on the soil cycle. TABLE 3 Essential Plant Nutrients [2] A scientific analysis
    of soil nutrients, soil moisture, pH is important for determining the soil properties.
    Acar et al. [17] employed an extreme learning machine (ELM) based regression model
    for prediction of soil surface humidity. The author selected two terrains having
    area 4 KM2 and 16 KM2 located in Dicle university campus for experimental analysis.
    The real-time field data was extracted using polarimetric Radarsat-2 data, which
    was pre-processed using the SNAP toolbox [18] and features were added with the
    help of local measurements by separating the field into square grids. Once the
    pre-processing and feature extraction is done the data is passed to ELM based
    regression model to predict the soil surface humidity. The algorithm was tested
    with 5 different kernel functions and the prediction was validated using leave-one-out
    cross-validation technique. The experimental results confirmed the lowest root
    mean square error (RMSE) of 2.19% when using ‘sine’ kernel function. Wang et al.
    [19] deployed soft sensors based on ELM for the measurement of nutrient solution
    composition in the soilless cultivation method. The soilless cultivation method
    is an emerging planting method. It is imperative to monitor the pH value, temperature
    and concentration changes in nutrient solution composition as the performance
    of soilless cultivation is highly dependent on these parameters. The significant
    variables in a nutrient solution cannot be measured directly hence these are determined
    with the help of auxiliary variables. The authors utilized conductivity, pH value,
    flow rate, and temperature measurements for auxiliary measurements. These auxiliary
    measurements are fed to a deep belief network-based ELM which predicts the values
    of significant variables. For experimental analysis, the authors deployed the
    model to measure the concentration of SO 2− 4 , and H 2 PO − 4 in a nutrient solution.
    The authors reported an average RMSE of 1.2414 for predictions in SO 2− 4 and
    RMSE of 0.8892 for prediction of H 2 PO − 4 . Park et al. [20] utilized ML algorithms
    to predict the soil moisture using data from MODIS. The authors downscaled the
    AMSR2 soil moisture to 1KM using random forest (RF) and Cubist algorithms. An
    ensemble of these algorithms was used to obtain soil moisture data. The results
    obtained through the ML methods were compared with the statistical ordinary least
    squares technique. The ML model exhibited a R 2 (coefficient of determination)
    of 0.96 and an RMSE of 0.06, whereas a R 2 of 0.47 and a RMSE of 0.16 was associated
    with the statistical ordinary least squares. Reda et al. [21] explored ML algorithms
    to estimate soil organic carbon (SOC) and total nitrogen (TN) in soil samples
    collected from four agricultural lands of Moroccan. Data set of near-infrared
    spectroscopy is utilized in comparison to traditional chemical methods as this
    technique reduces the computation time and resource utilization. The ensemble
    learning modeling algorithm presents the best performance among other regression
    models and back-propagation neural networks (BPNN) algorithm. The proposed algorithm
    presents R 2 of 0.96, RMSE of 1.92, performance to deviation (RPD) of 4.87 for
    SOC and R 2 of 0.94 and RMSE of 0.57, RPD of 4.91 for TN prediction. Morellos
    et al. [22] also utilized visible and infrared spectroscopy to determine TN, SOC,
    and moisture content (MC) in the arable field in Premslin Germany. Spectroscopy
    dataset is used for building the predictive ML model for estimating all three
    soil properties. Least square support vector machine (LS-SVM) and cubist ML algorithms
    outperform principal component regression and partial least square regression
    multivariate methods in terms of RMSE and residual prediction deviation (RPD).
    LS-SVM best predict SOC and MC with RMSE of 0.062 and 0.457, RPD of 2.24, and
    2.20. Cubist best predicts for TN with RMSE of 0.071 and RPD of 1.96. Andrade
    et al. [23] build ordinary least square regression, RF, cubist regression, XGboost
    prediction model for determining soil properties from portable X-ray fluorescence
    (pXRF) spectrometry dataset in Brazilian coastal plains. Three soil properties
    total nitrogen, soil organic matter (SOM), cation exchange capacity (CEC) were
    analyzed using RF, ordinary least squares regression (OLS), cubist regression
    (CR), XGBoost (XGB). RF algorithm gives the best performance with R 2 of 0.50
    for TN, R 2  0.75 for CEC and 0.56 for SOM. Deiss et al. [24] estimated the soil
    properties (clay, sand, pH, SOC) in northern Tanzania and USA Midwest from the
    spectroscopy dataset using ML algorithms. THE tuned SVM model outperforms the
    partial least square (PLS) regression model in terms of predicting all the soil
    parameters. Mahmoudzadeh et al. [25] explored the ML algorithm to predict SOC
    in the Kurdistan province of Iran. The simulation results suggest that RF accurately
    predicts SOC with R 2 of 0.60 and RMSE of 0.35% in comparison to SVM, kNN, Cubist,
    and Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) ML algorithm. The study also suggests
    that air temperature, annual rainfall, valley depth, texture of terrain surface
    are some of the important factors that influence SOC spread over the Kurdistan
    region. Veres et al. [26] explored DL architecture such as CNN for predicting
    the soil properties from the infra-red spectroscopy dataset. Benke et al. [27]
    predict soil electrical conductivity (EC) and SOC in different regional locations
    of Victoria, Australia using pedotransfer function (PTF) based on ML algorithm.
    PTF basically converts soil measurement into soil properties and provides inputs
    for ML simulation algorithms. In the proposed approach PTF use Generalised Linear
    Mixed Effects Model (GLMM) model and Residual Maximum Likelihood (REML) to predict‘
    the soil properties. Traditional approaches to soil properties and crop yield
    prediction require time-consuming field surveys and the deployment of expensive
    sensors. Khanal et al. [28] proposed an alternative approach in which the dataset
    for the prediction of soil properties and crop yield is generated using remotely
    sensed aerial images of agricultural land. Five soil properties, viz. pH value,
    magnesium (Mg), potassium (K), SOM, CEC, and crop yield were predicted using RF,
    SVM, Cubist, NN, Gradient Boosting Model (GBM) ML algorithms. NN presents the
    highest prediction accuracy for SOM having R 2 of 0.64, RMSE of 0.44 and CEC having
    R 2 of 0.67, RMSE of 2.35; SVM best predicts K having R 2 of 0.21, RMSE of 0.49
    and Mg having R 2 of 0.22, RMSE of 4.57; and GBM best predicts pH having R 2 of
    0.15, RMSE of 0.62. RF outperforms other algorithms in terms of crop yield prediction
    and presents higher accuracy having R 2 of 0.53 and RMSE of 0.97. Labrador et
    al. [29] estimate calcium and Mg content in soil using generalized regression
    NN and genetic algorithm (GA). The digital elevation model and satellite images
    were used as input to the prediction model for estimating the soil properties.
    Chlingaryan et al. [30] discussed different ML approaches used in precision agriculture
    for accurate crop yield prediction and soil nitrogen estimation over the last
    fifteen years. Ju-Young et al. [31] investigated a seasonal climatic forecasting
    model using regularized ELM to predict day-wise mean air temperature at field
    level for a period of 90 days. The authors selected data from Korea Metrological
    Administration using the Met GloSea5GC2 model [32]. The authors fed 240 days of
    forecast data and hindcast data from the ensemble based model to the RELM algorithm.
    The algorithm performance was evaluated by measuring: RMSE, mean absolute error
    (MAE) the model prediction vs the actual values. The authors achieved an RMSE
    in the range of 1.02 to 3.35 which outperformed the meteorological data which
    has an RMSE range of 1.61 to 3.37. Soil moisture content is an important parameter
    to acknowledge in the agriculture industry as it addresses precise irrigation
    scheduling. Stamenkovic et al. [33] build a support vector regression (SVR) prediction
    model to predict soil moisture content from remotely sensed hyperspectral images.
    Song et al. [34] proposed a macroscopic cellular automata (MCA) model and combined
    its deep belief network (DBN) to predict soil moisture content over a cornfield
    in northwest china. The simulation results of DBN-MCA outperforms the multi-layer
    perceptron (MLP)-MCA in terms of RMSE. Acheing [35] explored the SVR model (i.e.
    RBF), ANN, DNN for simulating soil water retention curve (SWRC) curve of loamy
    sand. Dataset of loamy sand subjected to wetting and drying condition is collected
    using a reflectometer and tensiometer. RBF based SVR model best predicts SWRC
    under both wet and dry conditions. Feng et al. [36] estimate soil temperature
    at various soil depths of Loess Plateau of China. Four different ML algorithms
    ELM, generalized regression neural networks (GRNN), backpropagation neural networks
    (BPNN), and RF were investigated for predicting the soil temperature. ML algorithms
    were trained with air temperature, wind speed, relative humidity, and vapour pressure
    and solar radiation as input parameters and the simulations show that ELM outperforms
    other ML algorithms in terms of RMSE, MAE, Nash–Sutcliffe coefficient (NS) and
    concordance correlation coefficient. Mohammadi et al. [37] explored ELM for predicting
    daily dew point temperature in different parts of Iran. This part of the world
    experience different climatic conditions throughout the year. The proposed model
    accurately predicts dew point temperature than SVM and ANN algorithms. Zhu et
    al. [38] accurately predict daily evapotranspiration in Northwest China using
    hybrid particle swarm optimization (PSO)-ELM model to optimize crop water requirement
    in agriculture. Alizamir et al. [39] accurately predicts soil temperature at different
    depths of 5, 10, 50 and 100 cm using ELM, ANN, classification and regression trees,
    group method of data handling using dataset obtained from Mersin station operated
    by Turkish Meteorological Service. The simulation results suggest that soil temperature
    can be estimated easily using air temperature upto depth of 50 cm while for depth
    of 100 cm additional information of solar radiation and wind speed is required.
    Rainfall prediction plays a critical role in the water resource management system,
    flood risk assessment, and the agriculture industry. Acknowledging the chaotic
    nature of rainfall, it is very difficult for statistical approaches to accurately
    predict the rainfall. Cramer et al. [40] evaluated the performance of seven ML
    algorithms for rainfall prediction. The statistical results show that the radial-basis
    function neural network (RBFNN) shows the best performance among other state of
    the art algorithms. Sierra and Jesus [41] predicted the rainfall in Tenerife,
    an island in Spain based on atmospheric synoptic patterns using different ML algorithms
    and found NN gave the best performance among other ML algorithms. Kamatchi and
    Parvathi [42] employed NN for weather prediction and proposed a hybrid recommender
    system for enhancing the success ratio of the system. Lazri et al. [43] build
    a multi-classifier model for estimating precipitation using MSG images (Meteosat
    second generation) and dataset obtained using radar. The proposed approach shows
    that the proposed multi-classifier improves the standard of classification. Shardoor
    and Rao [44] surveyed three different approaches i.e. ML techniques, data mining
    techniques, and satellite forecasting techniques for rainfall prediction. Table
    4 presents a comparative study of different ML algorithms for prediction of soil
    properties and weather prediction. TABLE 4 Different ML Algorithms for Prediction
    of Soil Properties and Weather Conditions B. Crop Yield Prediction A significant
    piece of information for any farmer is the prediction of crop yield and how the
    yield can be increased. pH value, soil type, and quality, weather pattern: temperature,
    rainfall, humidity, sunshine hours, fertilizers, and harvesting schedules are
    some of the parameters which play an important role in predicting the crop yield
    [45]. Scientifically manual farming can be considered as a feedback control system
    in which the corrective action is taken once a setback in a crop is observed.
    The crop yield will highly depend on the efficiency of the optimal utilization
    of the above-mentioned resources. If some kind of anomaly goes undetected in the
    initial stage may harm the crop yield in an unprecedented way. Singh et al. [46]
    assessed hailstorms on India’s wheat production and observes that in February
    and March 2015 alone the hailstorm events caused a decline of 8.4% in national
    wheat production. For financially weak farmers in a country such as India, where
    intermittent storage of harvested crops is a rare resource, accurate weather predictions
    may turn to be miraculous for farmers. ML models when systematically applied to
    a system act as feedforward control. With the help of accurate ML models, we can
    anticipate the factors which are going to affect the crop yield. Hence the corrective
    action can be taken before even an anomaly hits the crop production. Kamir et
    al. [47] used ML models to identify the yield gap hotspots in wheat production.
    Authors generated very high-resolution yield maps using data from various sources
    between 2009 and 2015. The data was collected from various sources:(a) NDVI time-series
    data across Australia using the MOD13Q1 data set [48], (b) rainfall and temperature
    data were collected from historic climate data at Australia bureau of metrology,
    (c) maps for observed grain yield were collected at source using intelligent harvesting
    machines. The dataset generated were tested with 9 ML algorithms: RF, XGBoost,
    Cubist, MLP, SVR, Gaussian Process, k-NN, and Multivariate Adaptive Regression
    Splines. The authors combined predictions from each of the algorithms into ensembles
    for prediction optimization [49]. Out of these algorithms, SVR with RBFNN outperformed
    other algorithms and investigators were able to achieve the yield estimate with
    an R 2  of 0.77 and an RMSE value of 0.55t ha −1 . The results were validated
    using 10-fold cross-validation techniques applied to the full data set. Aghighi
    et al. [50] used various advanced regression algorithms to predict the yield of
    silage maize crops. The authors selected maize fields located at Moghan Agro-Industrial
    and Animal Husbandry Company (MAIAHC), which is about 28,000 hectares’ area and
    located in Iran. The crop yield dataset was collected for around 40 silage maize
    fields were collected for a period from 2013-2015. In addition to it, the historic
    crop yield data the authors also gathered time-series NDVI data from Landsat 8
    OLI satellite. The data was fed to advanced regression algorithms: (a) Gaussian
    Process Regression, (b) SVR, (c) Boosted Regression tree (d) RF Regression models
    and the prediction form each of the regression models were compared and evaluated.
    Authors found out the boosted regression tree reported best evaluation parameters
    with an average R-value of higher than 0.87, and RMSE in a range of 8.5 to 11.10,
    with a mean value of 9.5 during the period 2013-14. Kuwata and Shibasaki [51]
    employed DL models to estimate the crop yield. Authors deployed SVR for predicting
    the yield of corn in Illinois. For input following dataset was employed by the
    authors: (a) 5 year moving average of corn crop yield, (b) The enhanced vegetation
    index is obtained using the MOD09A1 dataset MODIS satellite, and (c) Historic
    climatic data. The dataset was fed to support the vector regression model and
    the authors reported an RMSE of 8.204 and a correlation coefficient of 0.644 for
    the model. For result, validation authors conducted 10-fold cross-validation on
    the full data set. Kulkarni et al. [52] utilized DL models to predict rice crop
    yield. The authors utilized soil properties and nutrients measurements recorded
    over 31 years and historic rainfall data. The input data was fed to recurrent
    neural network models for crop yield prediction. For effective prediction the
    authors explored different activation functions viz. sigmoid, reLu, and linear
    in the neural network. Chu and Yu [53] builds an end to end summer and winter
    rice prediction model in 81 counties in the Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region,
    China. The proposed BBI model works in three stages, in the first stage the original
    area data and time series metrological data is pre-processed and its output works
    as input for the second stage where BPNN and RNN (recurrent neural network) learns
    deep spatial and temporal features from the input data. In the third stage, BPNN
    learns the relationship between deep features and rice yield to predict the summer
    and winter rice yields. The performance of the model is evaluated in terms of
    error and rate of convergence, the model presents lowest error values with MAE
    and RMSE of 0.0044 and 0.0057 for summer rice prediction and 0.0074 and 0.0192
    for winter rice prediction while the algorithm converges within 100 iterations.
    Feng et al. [54] proposed a hybrid approach for wheat yield prediction in new-south
    Wales in southeastern Australia. Multiple growth specific indicators, viz. agricultural
    production system simulators (APSIM), NDVI, and SPEI (Standardized Precipitation
    and Evapotranspiration Index) are used before the prediction of wheat yield using
    regression models (multiple linear regression (MLR) and RF). APSIM+ RF hybrid
    model presents the best performance among other predictors in terms of prediction
    accuracy. Cai et al. [55] integrated two data sources, i.e. climate data and satellite
    data over fourteen years to predict the wheat yield in Australia using ML algorithms
    (SVM, RF, and NN). Simulation results show that climate data provides distinctive
    information in comparison to satellite data for yield prediction with R 2 of around
    0.75. Planting the crops on accurate date plays an important role in improving
    productivity and reducing financial loss. Gumuscu et al. [56] explored three supervised
    ML algorithms; kNN, SVM, and decision trees for predicting planting dates; early,
    normal, and late for wheat crops in Turkey. The authors utilized climate data
    of the last 300 days to train ML algorithms and explored GA for feature selection.
    kNN classification ML algorithm shows robust performance and best predicts the
    planting dates of wheat crops. Several African, American, and Asian countries
    are the major producer of coffee in the world. Nevavuori et al. [57] explored
    a deep learning approach, i.e. CNN for wheat and barley yield prediction in the
    agriculture field of Pori, Finland. NDVI and RGB dataset obtained from cameras
    installed in UAV is used to train the six-layer CNN. RGB dataset best predicts
    the crop yield in CNN with MAE of 484.3 kgha−1 and mean absolute percentage error
    (MAPE) of 8.8%. Koirala et al. [58] reviewed deep learning approaches for fruit
    detection and yield estimation. CNN in the context of computer vision is widely
    used for feature extraction from images that provide useful insight to object
    detection and yield estimation. Kouadio, et al. [59] predicted the Robusta coffee
    yield using ML techniques from soil fertility dataset of Vietnam. ELM model outperforms
    multiple linear regression and RF algorithm with RMSE of 496.35 kg ha−1 and MAE
    of 326.40 kg ha−1. Gamboa et al. [60] predict the cocoa yield in Santander, Columbia
    using a generalized linear model (GLM) and SVM. In recent decades researchers
    have explored statistical and probabilistic models for crop yield prediction.
    Gyamerah et al. [61] proposed a novel robust probabilistic forecasting model based
    on quantile random forest and Epanechnikov kernel function (QRF-E) for crop yield
    prediction in Ghana. The proposed approach didn’t only predict discrete yield
    values but completely showcase probability descriptions for prediction interval
    for the two crops groundnut and millet. The simulation result shows the superior
    performance of the proposed algorithm in terms of prediction intervals coverage
    probability and prediction interval normalized average width under uncertain weather
    conditions. Peng et al. [62] explored remote sensed satellite-based Solar-Induced
    Chlorophyll Fluorescence (SIF) dataset for training ML algorithms to predict maize
    and soybean yield in the mid-west region of the United States. Simulation results
    show that non-linear algorithms such as SVM, ANN, RF best predict the crop yield
    in comparison to least absolute shrinkage and selection operator regression (LASSO)
    and ridge regression (RIDGE) algorithm. Khaki and Wang [63] predicted the hybrid
    maize yield with a dataset of 2,267 locations of the United States and Canada
    between the years 2008 to 2016 using deep neural networks (DNN). Genotype, weather,
    and soil properties were the three components used to train DNN. The proposed
    model accurately predicts the maize yield with RMSE of 12% of the average yield
    for predicted weather dataset and 11% of the average yield for perfect weather
    dataset and outperforms LASSO, shallow neural network (SNN) and regression tree
    (RT). Simulation results show that environmental factors have a large impact on
    the prediction accuracy of crop yield. In most areas of Africa, agriculture field
    data is scarcely available thus remotely sensed dataset is widely used for monitoring
    the field. Leroux et al. [64] explored the ML algorithm for predicting the maize
    yield in Burkina Faso with a remotely sensed dataset. A process-based crop model
    SARRO which is basically designed to simulate attainable agricultural yields under
    tropical conditions is used in this study. RF outperforms MLR in maize yield prediction
    with R 2 of 0.59 at the end of the season and 0.49 before two months of harvest.

    using climate, satellite, and country-specific datasets in the mid-west region
    of the USA. Maimaitijiang et al. [66] explored the potential of UAV with DNN for
    soybean yield prediction from the fields of Columbia, Missouri, USA. Multi-modal
    information such as canopy spectral, structural, and thermal features extracted
    from images obtained from the sensors installed on UAV is used as the input dataset
    for training DNN. The simulation result shows that DNN accurately predict the
    crop yield and outperforms partial least square regression (PLSR), RF, SVR algorithms
    with R 2 of 0.720 and RMSE of 15.9%. Zhang et al. [67] explored ANN for prediction
    of annual crop planting utilizing a historical cropland data layer (CDL) dataset
    of corn-belt of mid-west, USA. Kocian et al. [68] utilized both approaches to
    predict crop growth in greenhouses. IoT smart sensors are installed in the greenhouses
    to monitor different environmental parameters, soil properties and plant growth
    parameters such as leaf area index (LAI), accumulated dry weight (DW) and evapo-transpiration
    (ET). These parameters are in real-time send to the cloud through IoT devices
    and permit the implementation of an agriculture decision-support system. The probabilistic
    Bayesian network is explored in the proposed system to predict crop development
    parameters. Shahinfar and Kahn [69] explored ML algorithms for early prediction
    of adult wool growth in Merino sheep of Australia. Model Tree algorithms best
    predict the wool growth in comparison with NN with a correlation coefficient of
    0.93, 0.90, 0.94, 0.81 and 0.59, MAE of 0.48 kg, 0.41 kg, 0.92 μm , 6.91mm and
    6.82 N/ktex, for predicting Greasy Fleece Weight, adult Clean Fleece Weight, adult
    Fibre Diameter and adult Staple Length. Table 5 presents a comparative study of
    different ML algorithms for crop yield prediction. TABLE 5 Different ML Algorithms
    for Crop Yield Prediction C. Disease and Weed Detection Disease fungi, microorganisms,
    and bacteria take their energy from the plants they live on, which in turn affects
    the crop yield. If not detected at the right time may account for a huge economic
    loss to farmers. A lot of financial burden goes to a farmer in the form of pesticides,
    to get rid of diseases and restore the functioning of crops. Excessive use of
    pesticides also leads to environmental damage and the effects of the water and
    soil cycle of the agricultural land. Using an optimally designed AI system during
    crop growth period not only reduces the risk of crop disease and minimizes the
    economic impact, but it also results in minimizing the adverse impact of unsystematic
    farming on the environment. Sambasivan and Opiyo [70] used a CNN based DL model
    to detect disease in cassava crops for imbalanced datasets. The authors took a
    database of 10,000 labeled images that were pre-processed to improve the image
    contrast using contrast limited adaptive histogram equalization algorithm. The
    model evaluation was done using the performance metrics: confusion matrix, accuracy
    measure, precision measure, sensitivity, and F1 score. The authors reported a
    best-case accuracy of 99.30% and the lowest accuracy was reported as 76.9%. Ramcharan
    et al. [71] used DL algorithms to detect diseases in cassava crops. Authors deployed
    deep CNN to identify three different diseases and two types of pests from a set
    of 11,670 images dataset. Author’s utilized GoogLeNet algorithm based Inception
    v3 in Tensor Flow. The authors achieved efficiency in a range of 80% to 93.0%,
    and the validation of the results was done with the help of the confusion matrix.
    Mohanty et al. [72] employed DL methods to detect crop disease from the image
    dataset of plant leaves. The authors used a public database consisting of smartphone
    generated 54,306 images of diseased and healthy plants leaves. These images were
    resized to 256×256 pixels and were assigned 38 different class labels of crop-disease
    pair, and transformed into 3 datasets color, grayscale and segmented. The dataset
    was then fed to two of the most common deep CNNs: AlexNet [73] and GoogLeNet [74].
    The authors achieved an accuracy of 99.34% for GoogLeNet, and an accuracy of 85.53%
    for AlexNet network. The results were validated using F1 score, authors achieved
    a mean F1 score of 0.9886 for GoogLeNet, and a mean F1 score of 0.9848 for AlexNet.
    Amara et al. [75] used LeNet based CNN architecture for disease detection in banana
    leaves. Authors utilized data from open source local and digital libraries which
    were pre-processed and resized to 60×60 pixels, and the model was implemented
    for RGB as well as grayscale images. Hughes and Salathe [76] utilized this developed
    model for the identification of diseases in the images dataset. The authors achieved
    the best F1 score of 0.9971 for detection in RGB images and a score of 0.976 for
    grayscale images. Ferreira et al. [77] deployed CNN for the identification of
    weeds in soybean crops. The image dataset for soy plantation located at São José
    farm, Campo Grande Brazil was acquired using phantom DJI3 drone. The images are
    segmented using the SLIC algorithm into square grids. For training, the segmented
    images were manually annotated to their class. The segmented images dataset was
    fed to AlexNet (a convolution neural network) for classification. The performance
    of the AlexNet was compared with SVM, AdaBoost, and RF. To evaluate the performance
    of the AlexNet the model was fed with a balanced dataset and the authors reported
    an overall accuracy of above 90% and 96.3% images were correctly classified. Waheed
    et al. [78] proposed a cost-effective optimized dense CNN (DenseNet) for disease
    detection in corn leaves with an accuracy of 98.0%. Simulation results show that
    the proposed model outperforms other CNN models such as EfficientNet, VGG19Net,
    NASNet, and XceptionNet in terms of fewer parameters, accuracy, computation complexity,
    and computation time. Pereira et al. [79] proposed an expert system for identifying
    three species of aquatic weeds from aquatic weed leaves dataset based on their
    shape and supervised pattern recognition techniques. The author explored five
    shape descriptors with different shape-based skills viz. Beam Angle Statistics
    (BAS), Fourier Descriptors (FD), Moment Invariants (MI), Multi-scale Fractal dimension
    (MS), and Tensor Scale Descriptor (TSD) along with five ML algorithms viz. Optimum-Path
    Forest (OPF), SVM, Naive Bayes, ANN, MLP. Simulation results show that OPF using
    the BAS-100 descriptor presents the best results with a recognition rate of 96.41%
    in comparison to other approaches. Jiang et al. [80] proposed a semi-supervised
    CNN feature-based Graph Convolutional Network (GCN) for identifying weeds utilizing
    6000 images of corn, lettuce, radish, and mixed weed dataset. The proposed approach
    works in two parts, i.e. in the first part CNN model is used for feature extraction
    thereafter in the second part GCN graph is explored utilizing CNN feature dataset
    for extracting feature of an unlabelled dataset using labelled dataset. The proposed
    approach shows the best results in comparison with AlexNet, VGG16, and ResNet-101
    approaches with recognition accuracies of 97.80%, 99.37%, 98.93%, and 96.51% on
    four different weed datasets. Oppenheim and Shani [81] explored CNN for identifying
    four different types of diseases in potatoes. The simulation result shows that
    the model trained on 90% of the images and tested on 10% of images give the best
    results with 96% accuracy. Sugar beet contributes around 30% of world sugar production.
    Leaf spot diseases in sugar beet can create a loss of around 10 % to 50 % of yearly
    sugar yield. Rumpf et al. [82] proposed SVM with a radial basis function as a
    kernel based model for early detection and classification of three diseases Cercospora,
    leaf spot, leaf rust, and powdery mildew in sugar beet leaves. Diseased and non-diseased
    leaves were classified with an accuracy of 97% and three diseases were identified
    with accuracy higher than 86%. Ozguven and Adem [83] proposed updated faster R-CNN
    for leaf spot disease identification and classification in sugar beet. Leaf spot
    disease initially generates as small circular spots and later spread over the
    entire leaf surface. The proposed R-CNN architecture changes its parameters according
    to the images and the disease infected regions, which improves the overall classification
    rate to 95.48%. Bah et al. [84] explored CNN for weed detection in images obtained
    using UAV from bean and spinach fields. The proposed model first identifies the
    crop rows and then identifies the inter-crop row weeds which are used as a training
    dataset for CNN for crop and weed identification and classification. Kerkech et
    al. [85] identified the vine diseases from visible and infrared UAV images obtained
    in the Center Val de Loire region in France. A CNN model is trained with this
    dataset of images to classify each pixel according to different instances, namely,
    shadow, ground, healthy, and symptom. The model identifies with an accuracy of
    92% at grapevine-level and 87% at leaf level. Oslen et al. [86] explored robust
    deep learning models Inception-v3 and ResNet-50 for weed species identification
    and classification from a dataset of images collected in Australian rangeland.
    Simulation results show that the average classification performance of both the
    models is 95.1% and 95.7%. These results found fruitful for automatic real-time
    robotic weed control in the agricultural field. Sudars et al. [87] establish an
    experimental set up with RGB digital cameras in Latvia to collect images of the
    field having 6 food crops and 8 weed species grown in normal field conditions
    and controlled environment. This dataset can be utilized by deep learning algorithms
    for weed identification and classification. Sethy et al. [88] identified the rice
    leaf disease based on a hybrid CNN and SVM. In this model, CNN is explored for
    deep feature extraction from 5932 diseased rice leaf images and this data is used
    as input for SVM classifier. The resnet50 with SVM classification model best classify
    with respect to other models with F1 score of 0.9838. Garcia et al. [89] proposed
    an ML and DL learning hybrid approach for weed and crop identification in the
    agriculture fields of Greece. Image dataset of two crops tomato and cotton and
    two weeds black nightshade and velvetleaf was generated for training and testing
    of the model. Initially CNN (Xception, Inception-Resnet, Vignette’s, Mobilenet,
    and Densenet)) is used for feature extraction and this feature set is later used
    to train ML classifier (SVM, XGBoost and Logistic Regression) for classification.
    The simulation result shows that Densenet and Support Vector Machine outperforms
    other approaches with F1 score of 99.29%. Shah and Jain [90] identified the disease
    in cotton leaf through ANN with some image pre-processing techniques. Yu et al.
    [91] explored deep learning algorithms with a dataset of images for identifying
    dandelion, ground ivy, and spotted spurge in perennial ryegrass. Parraga-Alava
    et al. [92] generated a robusta coffee leaf image dataset (RoCoLe) for disease
    identification using ML algorithms. Glezakos et al. [93] proposed an innovative
    method to identify two viruses Tobacco Rattle Virus (TRV) and the Cucumber Green
    Mottle Mosaic Virus (CGMMV) in plants. In the proposed research Bio-Electric Recognition
    Assay (BERA) technique is utilized to obtain time-series information of the two
    viruses by measuring the waves through biosensors for 331s. This time-series data
    is preprocessed using GA to eliminate noise and for dimensionality reduction of
    a large dataset. Thereafter this meta-data is used to train MLP neural network
    classifier. The proposed model is tested against other ML classifiers via cross-validation.
    Ramesh and Vydeki [94] explored optimized deep NN with the Jaya algorithm for
    the identification of paddy leaf diseases. A dataset of rice plant leaves was
    taken from the agricultural field to identify and classify normal, bacterial blight,
    brown spot, sheath rot, and blast diseases. Simulation results show that the proposed
    model accurately classifies the diseased and normal images with an accuracy of
    98.9%, 95.78%, 92%, 94%, and 90.57% for blast affected, bacterial blight, sheath
    rot, brown spot, and normal rice leaf images. Chechlin’ ski et al. [95] explored
    CNN for weed identification in four plant species at different growth level and
    under varying light conditions. CNN architecture combines U-Net, MobileNets, DenseNet,
    and ResNet models for classification of weeds in crops. In [96]–[99] author has
    reviewed machine and deep learning techniques for weed, pests and disease identification,
    and classification in crops at different growth stages. Table 6 presents a comparative
    study of different ML algorithms for disease and weed identification. TABLE 6
    Different ML Algorithms for Disease and Weed Identification D. Drip Irrigation
    In the modern era, irrigation for crops has been improvised using the concept
    of drip irrigation [100], where the system consists of thin plastic tubes placed
    in or above the soil along the vertical rows of the plants for nurturing the water
    supply to the crops. Employing the proper operational management of drip irrigation,
    minimizes the utilization of water supply for crop production, and provides a
    better yield of crops. Socio-economic and environmental demands have widely appreciated
    in use of drip irrigation on farmlands for agriculture, especially for the high
    cost valued crops i.e., vegetables and fruits. Furthermore, drip irrigation is
    based on the low-pressure watering system in comparison to sprinkler systems;
    this makes the system more efficient in terms of energy consumption [101]. Various
    advantages have been observed using drip irrigation in agriculture over other
    irrigation systems which include sub-irrigation systems or sprinkler irrigation
    systems. These advantages are entitled to minimal usage of water supply, usage
    of soluble fertilizers through a drip irrigation system, automated system, minimization
    of soil erosion, uninterrupted activities, minimized weed problems, facilitation
    of double-cropping. Precision irrigation is another innovative approach in intelligent
    farming where it uses the water intelligently that further helps the farmers to
    achieve better yield in crops with minimal water usage. It can also be featured
    as providing the right amount of water, at the right time and the right place
    in the field. It focuses its implementation based on variable rate irrigation
    (VRI) methods employing drips or sprinklers. [102]–[104]. Advancements in the
    field of on-farm sensor technologies, weather forecasting, IoT based sensor detection
    system of vegetation and precision-based smart irrigation produces a huge size
    of data that ultimately benefits the farmers in optimizing the usage of water
    resources, improve the yield of crops and maximizes the profit of farmers [105].
    ML and DL and reinforcement learning are employed on the historical data and it
    provides various opportunities for real-time prediction and decision making purposes
    for smart irrigation which are solely based on the data collected by the sensors
    and IoT enabled systems [106]–[109]. Roberts et al. [110] have discussed that
    a sensor-based control system might create some bottleneck in terms of reducing
    the reliability of decision support tools on process-based crop models, which
    further may require costly calibration and affect in generating an uncertain representation
    of soil-plant-atmosphere processes. Further, ML techniques have been employed
    extremely well for protection analysis of hydrological processes i.e., soil moisture
    and groundwater levels [111], [112]. Li et al. [113] utilized ANN for estimating
    nitrate distribution in different types of soils under a drip irrigation system.
    Kavianand et al. [114] proposed a fully automated drip irrigation system based
    on the ARM9 processor along with different kinds of sensors equipped for monitoring
    the PH content and nitrogen content of the soil and controlling the irrigation
    of the field. Emmanuel et al. [115] establishes an experimental set-up in a greenhouse
    in Malaysia to monitor the growth of mustard leaf vegetable plants through IoT
    devices and alongside developed a data-driven model of drip irrigation system.
    Soil moisture, irrigation volume, evapotranspiration were measured through sensors
    and were given to the Raspberry Pi 3 controller for storing it in the cloud. This
    data was utilized by different predictive models ARX, BJ, and state-space models
    to predict soil moisture content for an optimized drip irrigation system. ARX
    model outperforms other predictive models in terms of MSE and response time. Seyedzadeh
    et al. [116] explored ML algorithms to optimize the uniform emitter discharge
    rate of drip irrigation system under varying pressure and temperature conditions.
    In this model operating pressure, water temperature, discharge coefficient, pressure
    exponent, and nominal discharge were taken as input parameters while ration of
    emitter discharge to nominal discharge is taken as output temperature. Authors
    explored four different ML algorithms for optimizing emitter discharge rate and
    simulation results show that LS-SVM presents best results with the least error
    of mean absolute error. Peng et al. [117] utilize soil moisture, soil electrical
    conductivity, air temperature, and light intensity parameters to build an optimized
    irrigation prediction model using backpropagation NN in China. The proposed prediction
    model presents good results with MSE of 0.00857724. The authors also identified
    an optimized layout and network arrangement for pipe in a drip irrigation system
    using computational fluid dynamics (CFD) software. The simulation results present
    that the H-shaped network layout is more suitable for field crop irrigation than
    the comb-shaped and fish bone-shaped layout. Drip irrigation system gives the
    best performance when the wetting front dimension, i.e. diameter, depth, and upward
    movement are optimized. Shiri et al. [118] explored soft-computing approaches
    viz., gene expressions programming (GEP), and RF techniques in modeling wetting
    front dimensions over different soil types for surface and sub-surface irrigation
    system. Proposed model, best predicts ETc with an improved correlation coefficient
    and decreases MSE and MAE. Elnesr and Alazba [119] explored ANN for predicting
    the wetting front dimensions from the dataset of a well-tested HYDRUS 2D/3D model.
    The simulation results show that the proposed model has a good correlation of
    0.93-0.99. Chang et al. [120] developed a smart irrigation model based on ML with
    the LoRa P2P network to learn the irrigation experiences from the expert farmers
    working on greenhouse organic crops. Singh et al. [121] have discussed an ML and
    IoT based model for soil moisture prediction during irrigation. Torres-Sanchez
    et al. [122] proposed a decision support system for irrigation management of citric
    crops in southeast Spain. In the proposed model smart sensors are deployed in
    the field to monitor water supplied previous week, weather data, soil water status,
    and based on this data three regression models SVM, RF, and Linear regression
    was trained to build the irrigation decision support system. RF best predicts
    with comparatively less prediction error. Hellín et al. [123] explored the Partial
    Least Square Regression (PLSR) and Adaptive Neuro-Fuzzy Inference System (ANFIS)
    model for building a smart irrigation decision support system crops in southeast
    Spain. Goumopoulos et al. [124] proposed a real-time adaptable intelligent and
    autonomous closed-loop irrigation management system. The authors built an experimental
    set-up in a greenhouse and deployed wireless sensors for monitoring the plant
    growth and environmental conditions along with plant growth control actuators.
    Estimation of evapotranspiration (ETc) plays a vital role in water resource management
    system. Chen et al. [125] estimate crop actual ETc from temporal convolution network
    (TCN) from the dataset of lysimeters for maize under drip irrigation with film
    mulch. Simulation results show that the proposed model best predicts ETc with
    an improved correlation coefficient and decreases MSE and MAE. Table 7 presents
    a comparative study of different ML algorithms for drip irrigation. TABLE 7 Different
    ML Algorithms for Drip Irrigation E. Livestock Production and Management Livestock
    production is basically related to the production and management of cattle i.e.,
    sheep, pigs, etc. for human consumption in terms of meat. Livestock production
    and their management are based on the farming parameters of these cattle i.e.,
    health, food, nutrition, and behaviour to optimize their production in such a
    way that the economic efficiency of this livestock can be maximized. In the present
    scenario, Artificial intelligence, IoT and Blockchain technologies [126] are widely
    explored to improves livestock sustainability and for analysis of their chewing
    habits, eating patterns, their movement patterns i.e., standing, moving, drinking
    and feeding habits, indicate the amount of stress the animal is going through
    which in turn helps in predicting the vulnerability to disease, weight gain, and
    production of the livestock. Furthermore, an ML-based weight predicting system
    can help in the estimation of their body weight 90–180 days before the slaughtering
    day. According to these analyses and estimations, farmers can change their diet
    plans and living conditions for their better growth in terms of health, behaviour,
    and weight gain which in turn will improve the economic efficiency of these livestock
    [127], [128]. Villeneuve et al. [129] build a decision support system that encounters
    not only real-time data but also expert knowledge for precision sheep farming.
    Livestock production and management can be further classified into two sub-categories,
    i.e., animal welfare and livestock production. Animal welfare generally deals
    with the animal’s health and their well-being; for this ML techniques are applied
    to their health monitoring feature for prospective of early disease detection.
    Whereas, livestock production employs the ML on the estimation of the balanced
    production of livestock for the producers to achieve economic benefits. Dutta
    et al. [130] described a procedure for the classification of cattle behaviour
    employing the ML techniques for data collection using collar-based sensors i.e.,
    magnetometers and three-axis accelerometers. In this study, events such as oestrus
    and dietary changes on cattle have been analyzed for their well-nutrition. Pegorini
    et al. [131] presented an automatic identification and classification of chewing
    habits of claves employing ML-based techniques for analysing their health and
    behavioural patterns. Ebrahimie et al. [132] proposed ML predictive model for
    estimating Sub-Clinical Mastitis (SCM) from milking parameters in dairy herds.
    Mastitis is an inflammatory disease that is widely affecting the dairy industry.
    Author’s explored four classification models decision trees, stump decision trees,
    parallel decision trees, and random forest to discover SCC independent of Somatic
    Cell Count (SCC) which is widely used to measure SCM worldwide. RF with Gini Index
    criteria best predicts SCM with an accuracy of 90%. Ebrahimie et al. [133] explored
    the attribute weighting model (AWM) for identifying lactose concentration and
    electrical conductivity in milk, which are two of the major indicators of SCM
    in dairy cattle. Hyde et al. [134] also explored RF to predict the route of transmission
    of germs and classify them into contagious (CONT) or environmental (ENV) with
    ENV further sub-classified into non-lactating “dry” period (EDP) or lactating
    period (EL). The simulation results show that an accuracy of 98% was achieved
    for discovering CONT vs ENV and 78% for discovering EDP and EL. Esener et al.
    [135] utilized spectral profiles dataset to discriminates CONT and ENV strains
    using GA, NN, and quick classifier. Ebrahimi et al. [136] predicted sub-clinical
    bovine mastitis using a large milking dataset collected through an automated in-line
    monitoring system in commercial New Zealand dairy farm. The simulation results
    show that GBM outperforms other ML model and best predict sub-clinical bovine
    mastitis with an accuracy of 84.9%. Sharifi et al. [137] explored meta-analysis
    and decision trees data mining tools to discover genes that can help to find mastitis
    in dairy cattle. Machado et al. [138] explored the RF model to identify factors
    influencing the occurrence of Bovine viral diarrhea virus (BVDV) viral disease
    in cattle in southern Brazil. The proposed approach identifies that insemination,
    the number of cattle in neighbouring farms, and routine rectal palpation are among
    the main factors of the occurrence of this disease. Matthews et al. [139] developed
    an ML-based automated monitoring system for tracking animal behaviour and movement
    i.e., standing, moving, feeding, and drinking by employing the depth video cameras
    and sensors. Qiao et al. [140] explored the DL technique Mask R-CNN for examining
    cattle health and welfare information in precision livestock management. The proposed
    model extract key features from image frames, enhance the image to remove non-uniform
    illumination shadow influences, segment image of cattle from the background image
    using the Mask R-CNN DL tool, and lastly extract cattle contour lines from the
    segmented image. The proposed approach outperforms SharpMask and DeepMask image
    segmentation models with mean pixel accuracy of 0.92 and an average distance error
    of 33.56 pixels. Liakos et al. [141] explored ML model for predicting healthy
    cattle and cattle suffering from lameness utilizing basic features of cattle which
    includes per day habits of cattle like steps taken, overall walking, lying, and
    eating habits. Morales et al. [142] employed a method based on SVM for early detection,
    warnings, and production issues of eggs in the poultry farms. The simulation results
    show that the proposed technique alerts a day before with an estimation accuracy
    of 0.9854. The identification of livestock is an important aspect of monitoring
    growth and animal welfare. Hansen et al. [143] explored deep learning techniques
    CNN for identifying pigs faces from the dataset of digital images of pigs obtained
    from commercial farm environment where the parameters such as dirt and lighting
    are highly unpredictable. The proposed approach accurately predicts the faces
    with an accuracy of 96.7%. Fenlon et al. [144] build a decision support system
    using predictive ML algorithms to provide calving assistance in the dairy industry.
    Four ML techniques multimodal regression, decision trees, RF, and NN were explored
    to predict three calving difficulties unassisted, slight assistance, and veterinary
    assistance. The simulation result shows that NN and multimodal regression models
    accurately classify 75% of calving difficulties with an average prediction error
    of 3.7% and 4.5%. Fenlon et al. [145] analyzed calving difficulties in dairy herds
    in Ireland using ML algorithms. A dataset of parity, log days in milk, inter-service
    interval, difficulties faced in the last calving, herd body conditions were built
    to predict conceptions using artificial insemination in the Iris dairy industry.
    Logistic regression outperforms RF, decision trees, and Naive Bayes in predicting
    conception using artificial insemination. Borchers et al. [146] explored RF, linear
    discriminant, and NN for calving prediction in dairy cattle by examining their
    behaviour which includes number the of steps, lying time, standing time, transition
    from one state to other and total motion 14 days before the predicted calving
    date. Although, the innovative algorithms play a crucial role in livestock management
    but combining livestock data with public data will improve precision livestock
    farming standards [147]. Table 8 presents a comparative study of different ML
    algorithms for livestock production and management. TABLE 8 Different ML Algorithms
    for Livestock Production and Management F. Intelligent Harvesting Techniques Smart
    harvesting systems helps the farmers to harvest agriculture goods by reducing
    human efforts. In this approach, technologies such as smart sensors, robotics,
    UAVs, and IoT devices [148], AI, and ML-based computer vision techniques are employed
    to intelligently harvest the crops. The research community has provided a comprehensive
    review of different intelligent techniques used to automate the agriculture industry
    [149]–[151] and have analyzed the potential and challenges of this decision support
    system [152]. In the last few years, different robots have been developed for
    harvesting fruits and vegetables [153]. Smart harvesting offers better insight
    into the crops and helps farmers to achieve the potential harvest of crops which
    leads to increased productivity. Smart harvesting system has numerous advantages
    in comparison to traditional harvesting approaches like it requires less labour,
    optimized crop yield, maximum probability, better insight into crops, reduced
    cost of harvesting, and cost-efficient production. A significant problem in the
    Japanese agriculture industry is a labour shortage. Sakai et al. [154] utilized
    machine vision for asparagus robot harvesting in Nagasaki prefecture. The speed
    of asparagus robot harvesting is three times faster than the human being. Since
    asparagus harvesting is modeled on their size and doesn’t require color properties
    thus laser sensor is used to collect 3D distance information in the proposed work.
    Monta et al. [155] also explored laser sensors along with color cameras for tomato
    harvesting through robots. Preter et al. [156] developed an autonomous system
    consisting of e-vehicle, cameras, robotic arm, localization system, gripper, quality
    monitoring, and logistic handling system, which can efficiently detect, plucks,
    and puts the strawberries in a box. The proposed robot prototype is fast enough
    to pluck the fruit in just 4 seconds. Hayashi et al. [157] practically evaluated
    the performance of strawberry harvesting robots in a greenhouse test field. The
    proposed autonomous system efficiently access the fruit position and its maturity
    level and pick the fruit with and without suction in a duration of two to three
    weeks without damaging the fruit. Horng et al. [158] proposed a smart harvesting
    system that employs IoT and smart image recognition systems for the detection
    of mature crops using object detection feature trained on MLP neural network.
    The mature crop can be harvested using a robotic arm whose movement is predicted
    using ML algorithms. Zhang et al. [159] explored Regions-CNN (RCNN) for multi-class
    canopy object detection in shake and catch the apple harvesting system. A dataset
    of RGB images was created in the commercial orchard using a Kinect v2 sensor and
    pre-trained RCNN is utilized for real-time detection of apple, branches, and trunks.
    The authors also developed an estimation algorithm to predict shaking location
    based on the results of RCNN. Spectral and thermal images have also been explored
    for the detection of fruits and vegetables [160], [161]. Zhang et al. [162] investigated
    eleven canopy parameters using principal component analysis (PCA) and classified
    the removal status of apples into mechanically harvested and mechanically unharvested.
    Zhang et al. [163] reviewed technology progress in the mechanical harvesting of
    apples which includes shake and catch, robots, and harvest assist platforms. Pise
    and Upadhye [164] explored Naive Bayes and SVM ML techniques for grading of harvested
    mangoes based on their color, size, features, quality, and maturity. Grading of
    fruits increases the profit of the agriculture and food industries. A mango image
    dataset comprising of three different colors red, green, and yellow is created
    and is used for training and testing the ML algorithm. The proposed approach presents
    limited scope as it can detect defects in a particular surface area which can
    be overcome by creating a dataset of rotational view images. Wu et al. [165] explored
    NN for recognition, classification of fruits and vegetables, and obstacle avoidance
    in a harvesting robot. Table 9 presents a comparative study of different ML algorithms
    for intelligent harvesting. TABLE 9 Different ML Algorithms for Intelligent Harvesting
    SECTION V. IoT Applications in Precision Agriculture Precision agriculture refers
    to a system with minimizing direct involvement of the caretaker/farmer except
    when there is an urgent need or an emergency i.e. when there is a failure in the
    system. IoT helps in maintaining the defined standards of parameters needed for
    day to day work in agriculture. The parameters can be measured using the required
    sensors and can be uploaded to an IoT cloud for remote monitoring so that the
    direct involvement of farmers is minimized. The IoT cloud can be used for control
    purposes also, say for example in detecting and avoiding animal intrusion in the
    agriculture field. Sensors are an integral part of IoT for precision agriculture
    without which the monitoring and controlling becomes next to impossible task.
    Figure 6 shows the trend search of keywords “IoT in agriculture” and “sensor in
    agriculture” on google in the last 10 years. Apart from monitoring and controlling,
    IoT in agriculture is also used as data-storage technology. Parameters like properties
    of soil, crop yield, seasonal behaviour data, temperature changes, etc can be
    stored on the IoT cloud which will be helpful in analyses, prediction, and deciding
    on estimated crop production. FIGURE 6. Google trend response for keywords IoT
    in agriculture and sensor in agriculture for the last 10 years. Show All A. Sensors
    for IoT in Precision Agriculture IoT is defined as the interconnection of things,
    where one example of a thing is a sensor. A group of sensors can communicate with
    every other sensor and thereby with the control center. A WSN in IoT has the benefits
    of increasing the efficiency of production, enhancing the yield quality, detecting
    and avoiding plant-eating pets, detecting the fires in the farms [166]. IoT has
    helped in increasing the scope of farming, animal, and pet rearing along with
    smart irrigation [167]. Sensors form an integral part of IoT architecture in agriculture.
    A sensor is defined as a transducer that converts the sensed parameter (soil moisture,
    for example) into the equivalent electrical signal. Depending on the nature of
    the output signal they generate, sensors are classified as analog or digital sensors.
    An analog sensor’s output needs to be converted to digital before it is being
    fed, processed by any IoT system. On the other hand, sensors that generate signals
    in digital form can be directly connected to any IoT system. Table 10 compares
    the list of some important sensors applicable in precision agriculture. Addressing
    the complete list of sensors available for precision agriculture is beyond the
    scope of this article, although, table 10 provides the list of sensors and their
    parameters that are very widely used and covers almost every aspect of IoT in
    agriculture. A pair of sensors and actuators can be used to collect information
    about some of the vital parameters of precision agriculture and react to perform
    predefined action whenever required. IoT plays an important role in assuring that
    the action performed happens instantaneously with minimum delay. The factors that
    can affect the real-time decision making and causes a delay is the tolerance of
    the measuring parameter and the communication protocol used. The operating temperature
    where the sensors are placed have a proportional effect on tolerance. An increase
    temperature on either side will increase the tolerance of the measuring parameter
    and sensor reading will deviate the value of the measurand from the actual value.
    The communication protocol is used to send the readings of the sensor to the microcontroller
    from where the value will be uploaded to the IoT cloud. The data rate of communication
    protocol decides the time required for this data transfer. TABLE 10 Sensor Parameters
    Used in Precision Agriculture B. Wireless Sensor Networks in Precision Agriculture
    WSN is the collection of spatially displaced sensor deployed to monitor the physical
    parameters of the environment and coordinating the collected data at central location.
    IoT transfers the recorded data to cloud which is further processed and analyzed
    through intelligent algorithms. In precision agriculture integration of artificial
    intelligence with WSN allows real time monitoring and intelligent decision making
    in agriculture fields. IoT sensor network which includes soil moisture senor,
    electrochemical sensor, optical sensors, etc. continuously monitor the field data
    and works as a training data for ML and DL algorithms. Edge computing enabled
    AI systems assist in reducing the amount of data to be uploaded to IoT cloud by
    identification of meaningful data to be communicated and discarding the redundant
    data. Intelligent processing of data generated from nodes result in better management
    of sensor network In [185] author utilized AI driven sensor network to classify
    land as suitable, more suitable, moderately suitable and unsuitable after every
    cultivation. In [186] author developed a power efficient WSN using Arduino microcontroller
    and ZigBee module to monitor and control essential parameters that effect crop
    growth such as soil and weather conditions in Florida, USA. In [187] author integrating
    sensor nodes with AI systems to reduce the power consumption of nodes by optimizing
    the performance and data transmission of respective nodes. RNN based Long-Short
    term (LSTM) network was built which increases the runtime of a single sensor and
    guarantees 180 days autonomous operation using Li-ion battery. The proposed system
    continuously monitors the growth dynamics of plant leaves. In [188] author presents
    an autonomous system built with low power sensor nodes and IoT based cloud platform
    to estimate level of phosphorous in soil through ANN. Author incorporates dynamic
    power management system to maintain balance between energy consumption and estimation
    accuracy. In [189] author presents GA optimized WSN for precision agriculture
    applications. Thus, we conclude that integrating artificial intelligence with
    WSN, IoT plays a key role in assuring the best yield of crops. SECTION VI. Assessment
    and Evaluation of Knowledge-Based Agriculture System In this section ML algorithms
    used by different researchers in the precision agriculture system are analyzed.
    The agriculture industry is facing many challenges across the world, and a knowledge-based
    agriculture system allows sustainable use of resources by the farmers aiming to
    get maximum output from the agriculture land. There are two basic stages in precision
    agriculture, i.e. pre-processing stage and processing stage. In the pre-processing
    phase market trends are studied and based on geographical conditions and soil
    properties of the land seeds are selected and the land is prepared for precision
    agriculture system. In the post-processing stage machine vision techniques are
    explored for disease and weed identification while intelligent techniques are
    used for irrigation and harvesting. In this article, author reviewed and discussed
    70 articles where multiple ML algorithms are presented for performance optimization
    of the agricultural cycle. Figure 7 shows the classification of articles based
    on different applications of precision agriculture. FIGURE 7. Classification based
    on agriculture cycle. Show All Figure 8 depicts the cumulative distribution of
    the ML and DL models used by researchers in precision agriculture. The graph depicts
    the broad categorisation of the techniques with their applications to agricultural
    cycle. It has been observed that in majority of the literature the researchers
    have applied multiple algorithms for classification and parameter prediction.
    Regression models and ANN together make up around 65% of the AI techniques employed
    by researchers. Hence, it is important to investigate the techniques used and
    compared by the authors. The individual best performing algorithms have already
    been covered in appropriate sections, however the figure 8 depicts the distribution
    of the various regression algorithms and DL models throughout the literature.
    ELM algorithm is widely explored in prediction of soil properties such as soil
    moisture, soil temperature, surface humidity, ETc. ANN accurately predicts the
    rainfall and crop yield across different regions of globe. DL based CNN model
    finds wide applications for accurate disease and weed classification in agriculture
    crops. ANN model best predicts the nitrate content and water requirement in drip
    irrigation system. SVM regression model estimates the emitter outflow discharge
    under varying temperature and pressure conditions. Decision Tree algorithm accurately
    identify the chewing habits and predicts SCM in dairy herds. CNN have widely explored
    for livestock identification. Metaheuristic optimized ML algorithms are also explored
    by researchers in precision agriculture. FIGURE 8. ML techniques used in precision
    agriculture applications. Show All In the reviewed articles, authors have used
    around 22 different regression algorithms for prediction, however 5 most commonly
    used algorithms are identified and depicted in the figure 9. Remaining 17 algorithms
    which are used either only for comparison or employed as a support algorithms
    have been classified into others. FIGURE 9. Regression algorithm in precision
    agriculture. Show All DL models have contributed significantly and outperforms
    ML classification algorithms in classification of crop disease and weed as well
    as for livestock diseases identification. Figure 10 shows CNN, ANN and RNN algorithms
    explored in precision agriculture. In the reviewed articles, authors have used
    around 10 different DL/NN algorithms for prediction/classification, however 8
    most commonly used algorithms are identified and depicted in the figure 10. Remaining
    2 (LeNet, and Caffee) algorithms which are used either only for comparison or
    employed as a support algorithms have been classified into others. FIGURE 10.
    Classification algorithm in precision agriculture. Show All A. Performance Comparison
    of ML Algorithms in Precision Agriculture The application of ML and DL algorithms
    highly depends on the agriculture cycle and the dataset involved. This section
    discusses the advantages and limitations of various ML and DL algorithms such
    as regression and classification algorithms based on the agriculture cycle involved.
    1) Soil Properties and Weather Prediction The application of AI techniques in
    prediction of soil parameters and weather is dependent on various factors. The
    researchers generally employ around 3 to 4 algorithms in for prediction and select
    the algorithms which has most accurate prediction and is robust to factors such
    as: noise, non-linearity, outliers etc. the most commonly employed algorithms
    are ELM, RF, SVR, and cubist algorithm. Advantages of using ML in prediction of
    soil properties and weather pattern: Non-linear dataset – these predictions often
    attributes a non-linear dataset which can be utilized for accurate prediction
    by regression algorithms such as: ELM, RF, SVR Large dataset – the dataset for
    is often obtained from satellite which can be well handled by the regression algorithms
    with less convergence time and accurate predictions. Insensitivity to outliers
    – Weather patterns often encounter outlier events which may affect the prediction
    accuracy, however algorithms such as ELM, NN are robust to outliers and provide
    accurate predictions. Accurate prediction – prediction of parameters using ML
    exhibit low error indices such as RMSE, and R2 which are standard measures of
    accuracy for statistical analysis. Challenges and limitations in prediction of
    soil properties and weather pattern: Varying geographical conditions poses a challenge
    for universal design of the prediction algorithms. Soil parameters prediction
    is highly dependent on the sample selection philosophy. Dataset selection and
    filtering is a challenge for researchers with non-computing background. 2) Crop
    Yield Prediction The application of AI techniques in prediction of crop yield
    is a mammoth task and lack of availability of a universal model makes designing
    of the algorithm challenging. The most promising algorithms for crop yield prediction
    are regression algorithms, and neural networks. Advantages of using ML in crop
    yield prediction: Complex dataset – crop yield prediction involves enormous dataset
    composing of satellite data and/or historic data. Faster and accurate predictions
    can be made by utilizing the AI techniques such as regression algorithms (SVR,
    RF) Neural networks (CNN). Parameter variation – the crop yield depends on a lot
    of parameters, like climatic factors, soil quality, NDVI, altitude, air parameters.
    The AI based prediction systems handle the parameters dependency efficiently.
    Accurate prediction – prediction of parameters using ML exhibit low error indices
    such as RMSE, and R2 which are standard measures of accuracy for statistical analysis.
    Challenges and limitations in prediction of crop yield: Varying parameters and
    complex datasets pose a challenge for universal design of the prediction algorithms.
    Dataset selection is critical due to the complexity; as an improper selection
    of data may result in underfit/overfit prediction pattern. 3) Disease and Weed
    Detection The applications of AI techniques in disease and weed detection primarily
    depends on the advances in image processing. CNN’s are the most prominent choice
    for building a disease identification system. Training dataset will govern the
    performance of the algorithm, although these are available in open-source format,
    users have to be cautious while using the dataset. Advantages of using ML in detection
    of weed and disease in a crop field: Prediction accuracy – AI offer accurate detection
    of disease and weeds with an accuracy of 99% which is better compared to manual/classical
    techniques. Robust prediction – the algorithms can predict the disease/weed even
    with smartphone images, which is commonly available with farmers. Easy configuration
    – with CNN being the most common and reliable technique, designing a disease/weed
    detection system is not a complex job unlike other systems discussed in text.
    Challenges and limitations in detection of weed and disease in a crop field: The
    accuracy of prediction depends on the quality of training dataset some of which
    is available as an open-source dataset, but is applicable to only a limited number
    of crops. Improperly labelled data may result in a disastrous prediction system,
    as the training of the system plays a major role in the performance of the system.
    Overtraining the model may result in a sensitive prediction system. 4) Drip Irrigation
    Smart irrigation systems are not only crop friendly but are environmental friendly
    too. The combination of IoT with the AI not only reduces the manual intervention
    but also utilizes the available in an optimum way to ensure no adverse effect
    to environment. Regression and Advantages of using ML in drip irrigation for an
    agricultural field: Optimum resource utilization – accurate estimation of irrigation
    requirements results in a system which optimizes the resource (water, electricity)
    utilization (NN algorithms). Crop protection – optimized irrigation practices
    minimizes water related damage to the crops and hence increases the crop yield.
    Robust to weather variations – an accurately designed AI based (Regression algorithms)
    irrigation system handles the random weather events in a better way when compared
    with the non-AI based irrigation methods. Challenges and limitations in drip irrigation
    for an agricultural field: Accurate prediction sometimes depends on the number
    of sensors and hence increases the initial investment of the farmers. An incorrect
    sensor placement in the filed affects the accuracy of the system, hence sensor
    optimization becomes imperative in designing a smart irrigation system. The architecture
    of prediction system highly depends on the dataset; hence no universal guidelines
    can be laid out for system design. 5) Livestock Production and Management The
    livestock management primarily focuses on the well-being of the farm animals and
    uses advanced image recognition (CNN) algorithms, and regression techniques to
    detect and predict the disease/ disease spread. Advantages of using ML in livestock
    production and management: Decreased risk of diseases – AI systems assists in
    identifying the livestock diseases and also helps in combating the disease, by
    predicting the root of diseases and transmission (Regression algorithms). Minimization
    of disease spread – timely diagnosis and treatment reduces the risk of spreading
    the disease. Psychological analysis – advanced image recognition and behavioural
    analysis (CNN techniques) help is detecting the stress in animals ensuring heath
    of the livestock. Challenges and limitations in drip irrigation for an agricultural
    field: With varying geographic and climatic conditions the attributes of the cattle
    and diseases changes hence, no universal system can be designed to cater to the
    diversities. Some viruses are difficult to predict even using the state-of-art
    prediction algorithms. 6) Intelligent Harvesting The applications of AI techniques
    in harvesting is primarily an assistive technology for automatic harvesting systems.
    Harvesting prediction system largely relies on the advances in image processing
    and CNN’s are the most prominent choice for building these systems. Advantages
    of using ML in intelligent harvesting: Assistive technology – AI in conjunction
    with existing harvesting robots exhibit high accuracy in harvesting. Image processing
    – the identification of harvesting relies on the state-of-art image processing
    algorithm (CNNs) and hence the developments in the image processing algorithms
    result in direct accuracy enhancement of intelligent harvesting techniques. Universal
    algorithms – the AI harvesting techniques largely depend on image recognition
    methods, hence CNNs can easily be deployed for implementing intelligent harvesting
    techniques. Challenges and limitations in intelligent harvesting: The accuracy
    of the prediction systems largely depends on the training dataset, hence accurately
    labelled dataset is a primary requirement of implementing an intelligent harvesting
    system. Inaccurate harvesting recognition system result in economic loss for farmers,
    as a delay in harvesting might lead to an overripe crop or early harvesting might
    lead to rejection of the product. SECTION VII. Challenges and Limitations of Artifical
    Intelligence in Precision Agriculture Artificial intelligence has the potential
    of playing an important role in meeting the food requirement of entire world.
    However, there are certain challenges which are hampering its adoption in agriculture
    industries which are outlined as follows: A recent government survey in India
    estimated that literacy rate of Indian farmers is very low therefore bridging
    the gap between farmers and technology is a challenging task. Farmers are less
    motivated to come out from their comfort zone and learn digital skills to improve
    their farming standards. Agriculture lands are mostly situated in rural areas.
    Implementation of IoT architecture and WSN which requires cloud services for data
    storage and analysis is a big issue in rural areas where reliable internet connectivity
    is not available. Accurate prediction and classification through cognitive ability
    of machines is difficult in varying geographical conditions. Initial set up of
    digital farming which includes hardware and software requires huge investment.
    Deployment of smart sensors and other electronic gadgets requires heavy energy
    consumption. SECTION VIII. Future Trends of Artifical Intelligence and IoT in
    Precision Agriculture Agriculture industry is globally US$5 trillion industry
    and now it has been revolutionized with artificial intelligence and IoT technologies.
    These innovative tools are assisting famers to improve crop yield, monitor soil
    parameters, livestock health and temperature conditions, control pests and improve
    other agriculture related tasks. Conventional ML and DL models such as SVM, RF,
    ANN finds difficult to accurately estimate soil parameters and weather conditions
    in varying ecosystem. Therefore, swarm intelligence optimized robust and adaptive
    ML and DL algorithms such as SVM-PSO, ANN-GWO algorithms can be explored to effectively
    forecast different parameters in precision agriculture. In large agriculture fields
    swarm intelligence inspired autonomous system can be built for crop health and
    growth monitoring. UAV swarm can be utilized for near real time field and livestock
    monitoring through computer vision and DL algorithms and accordingly swarm of
    UAV can be used for spraying of pesticides and fertilizers in the infected crops.
    Greenness of crops can be identified through UAVs installed cameras and an automated
    irrigation system can be built in large agriculture fields. Swarm of mobile robots
    can be used in the agriculture fields to efficiently automate task such as harvesting,
    weed identification and elimination, etc. Metaheuristic algorithms can be explored
    for nodes localization in agriculture fields in order to optimize the sensor deployment
    in the field and keep the minimize cost to farmers. Offline service chatbots can
    be built to assist farmers in developing countries where farmers don’t have good
    internet connectivity. These chatbots can assist farmers by providing timely advice
    based on expert recommendations and will help to resolve their specific farming
    problems. Artificial intelligence assisted renewable energy plants can be installed
    in agriculture lands to maximize the power output of clean energy in unpredictable
    weather conditions. This will allow for sustainable agricultural practices. Artificial
    intelligence can also be explored in vertical and soilless agriculture. In near
    future artificial intelligence systems, robotics and smart sensor technology will
    automate the whole farming process starting from seed sowing to intelligent fruits
    and vegetables harvesting and packaging. SECTION IX. Conclusion Precision agriculture
    is empowering the farmers with technology intending to get optimum outputs with
    precise inputs. IoT enabled smart sensors, actuators, satellite images, robots,
    drones are some of the key technological revolutions that boosted the agriculture
    industry. These components play a vital role in collecting real-time data and
    accordingly making decisions without human support. Artificial intelligence which
    is the automation of intelligent behaviour is continuously benefiting our planet
    and helping humans in various aspects of life. In this paper, authors have reviewed
    ML applications for precision agriculture. The impact of AI and IoT in smart farm
    management is discussed with a brief introduction to ML algorithms which are most
    commonly used in precision agriculture. Regression algorithms are the backbone
    for soil properties, weather, and crop yield prediction. DL algorithms such as
    CNN and ML classification algorithms such as SVM, Decision trees, and RF were
    explored for the identification of disease and weeds in the plants. Smart irrigation
    systems and harvesting techniques play an important component in precision agriculture
    as these techniques quickly complete the work and reduces human labour. Drones
    and robots enabled with a digital camera are employed for this work. Livestock
    management is an important concern for farmers across the world. Knowledge-based
    agriculture system which includes smart IoT devices and AI tools efficiently handle
    livestock management. As a scope of future work, NLP based chatbots can be built
    for famers and more ML, DL and hybrid algorithms can be explored in the agriculture
    industry for sustainable use of available resources. Authors Figures References

    Get rights and content Highlights • The base concepts of soil water balance (SWB)
    models using the dual Kc approach are discussed. • The use of SWB, transient state,
    and crop growth and yield models is discussed. • The SIMDualKc model is taken
    as example and various extensions of the dual Kc are presented. • Trends for real
    time irrigation are discussed, including remote and proximal sensing data assimilation.
    • Future trends are analysed from the perspective of using remote sensing and
    cloud data. Abstract This study reviews soil water balance (SWB) model approaches
    to determine crop irrigation requirements and scheduling irrigation adopting the
    FAO56 method. The Kc-ETo approach is discussed with consideration of baseline
    concepts namely standard vs. actual Kc concepts, as well as single and dual Kc
    approaches. Requirements for accurate SWB and appropriate parameterization and
    calibration are introduced. The one-step vs. the two-step computational approaches
    is discussed before the review of the FAO56 method to compute and partition crop
    evapotranspiration and related soil water balance. A brief review on transient
    state models is also included. Baseline information is concluded with a discussion
    on yields prediction and performance indicators related to water productivity.
    The study is continued with an overview on models development and use after publication
    of FAO24, essentially single Kc models, followed by a review on models following
    FAO56, particularly adopting the dual Kc approach. Features of dual Kc modeling
    approaches are analyzed through a few applications of the SWB model SIMDualKc,
    mainly for derivation of basal and single Kc, extending the basal Kc approach
    to relay intercrop cultivation, assessing alternative planting dates, determining
    beneficial and non-beneficial uses of water by an irrigated crop, and assessing
    the groundwater contribution to crop ET in the presence of a shallow water table.
    The review finally discusses the challenges placed to SWB modeling for real time
    irrigation scheduling, particularly the new modeling approaches for large scale
    multi-users application, use of cloud computing and adopting the internet of things
    (IoT), as well as an improved wireless association of modeling with soil and plant
    sensors. Further challenges refer to the use of remote sensing energy balance
    and vegetation indices to map Kc, ET and crop water and irrigation requirements.
    Trends are expected to change research issues relative to SWB modeling, with traditional
    models mainly used for research while new, fast-responding and multi-users models
    based on cloud and IoT technologies will develop into applications to the farm
    practice. Likely, the Kc-ETo will continue to be used, with ETo from gridded networks,
    re-analysis and other sources, and Kc data available in real time from large databases
    and remote sensing. Previous article in issue Next article in issue Keywords Crop

    use assessmentSIMDualKc model 1. Introduction The current imbalance between water
    demand and supply in agriculture has driven the search for new equilibria through
    adopting modern technologies and management tools to optimize irrigation water
    use (Pereira et al., 2009; Pereira, 2017; Jovanovic et al., 2020). The successful
    use of these tools depends, however, upon their adaptation to prevailing social,
    economic, institutional, climatic, soil and other environmental conditions. Reducing
    the vulnerability of agriculture to climate change, and ultimately decreasing
    the risks associated to food security, requires integrated and sustainable water
    management, including the adaptation of cropping systems and management practices
    adopting an efficient use of both rainfall and irrigation water. The need for
    such sustainable water management practices is particularly critical considering
    the steady increase of global population and the limitations on availability of
    natural resources, particularly in vulnerable agricultural areas where water scarcity
    is of great importance (Smith, 2000; Pereira, 2017). Sustainable water management
    at farm level assumes an enormous relevance, namely in terms of adopting adequate
    irrigation schedules, that should lead to optimal yields and agricultural and
    irrigation practices that allow reducing but optimizing water use, particularly
    non-beneficial ones (Pereira et al., 2009, 2012; Jovanovic et al., 2020). Numerous
    irrigation scheduling simulation models have been produced and made available
    to support irrigation decision-making since the 80’s as reported in various international
    conferences (ASAE, 1981, 1985, 1990; Feyen, 1987; Pereira et al., 1992, 1995;
    Ragab et al., 1996; Smith et al., 1996). The reported irrigation scheduling models
    were often based upon crop evapotranspiration and yield-water relations proposed
    in FAO manuals 24 and 33 (Doorenbos and Pruitt, 1977; Doorenbos and Kassam, 1979).
    Reported soil water balance (SWB) models include steady state and transient state
    models. Steady state models solve the law of conservation of mass within a selected
    time step, generally a day, while transient state models contain the time variable
    explicitly and computations refer to the fluxes of water within and through the
    boundaries of the control volume of soil. The latter, highly exigent in terms
    of data and using mechanistic approaches to simulate soil water processes, often
    include mechanistic sub-models to simulate plant growth, predict crop yields as
    influenced by various environmental factors, and to assess the transport of salt,
    chemicals and pollutants that impact farm water use and sustainability. Steady
    state SWB models are less exigent in terms of parameterization and, when properly
    calibrated, are very accurate and easier to use for irrigation scheduling, as
    well as to assess the impact of changing environmental conditions on crops evapotranspiration
    and yield, which may be predicted when the model is associated to, or incorporates
    yield-water functions. A variety of tools, namely using hyperspectral reflectance
    data (Melton et al., 2012; Campos et al., 2017; Pôças et al., 2017; Saadi et al.,
    2018), can be used to support improved irrigation scheduling. More commonly, remote
    sensing vegetation indices may be used in combination with ground data after integration
    in current SWB model approaches (Olioso et al., 2005; Er-Raki et al., 2007; Santos
    et al., 2008; Vazifedoust et al., 2009; Pôças et al., 2015; Thorp et al., 2015;
    Corbari et al., 2019), although adopting a variety of data and integrative solutions.
    The current paper is focusing on steady state SWB simulation models having a known
    software and, mainly, when adopting the FAO56 method to determine ETc from the
    reference ETo and a crop coefficient. Particular attention is given to models
    that adopt the dual Kc approach due to the relevance of determining transpiration
    and soil evaporation, the former consisting of the beneficial consumptive use
    of water. Considering the vast panoply of innovation tools that support sustainable
    water use on farms, the overarching aim of this paper is to provide a review of
    the advances gained in modelling with the FAO56 method in the past two decades.
    The specific objectives of this paper are: (a) to discuss simple approaches to
    steady state water balance modelling in contrast with transient state, mechanistic
    soil water, crop growth and yield models; (b) to provide for an overview on models/software
    used to improve irrigation scheduling and management, with focus on dual Kc modelling
    with consideration of water scarcity and saving; c) to show examples of model
    applications and water use assessment based on the SIMDualKc model; and d) to
    analyze current trends and opportunities, focusing particularly on real time irrigation
    scheduling using modern information technologies. This article consists of various
    Sections. After the current Introduction, Section 2 refers to main concepts and
    calculation approaches of the FAO56 method and includes discussions on the one-step
    approach, transient state modeling, crop growth and yield prediction, and water
    use indicators. Section 3 presents an overview of SWB models aimed at improving
    irrigation scheduling and management, and Section 4 focuses on the dual Kc approaches
    taking the SIMDualKc model as an example for adopting and extending the use of
    the FAO56 dual Kc approach. Section 5 discusses real time irrigation scheduling
    and latest developments, namely related to the applications of remote sensing
    and internet platforms aimed at multi-users, while Section 6 presents the main
    conclusions and future trends. 2. Reference concepts 2.1. Crop evapotranspiration,
    crop water requirements and irrigation requirements The FAO56 method (Allen et
    al., 1998) uses the simple Kc-ETo approach to determine crop evapotranspiration
    as the product of a crop coefficient (Kc) and the grass reference evapotranspiration
    (ETo) computed with the FAO Penman-Monteith equation (PM-ETo). The PM-ETo equation
    is derived from the Penman-Monteith (PM) combination equation (Monteith, 1965)
    when it was parameterized for the standard grass reference crop (Allen et al.,
    1994a,b, 1998). As analyzed in the next Section, the PM equation is often used
    for direct calculation of crop ET. The FAO56 method adopted the concept of standard,
    optimal crop conditions as the basis for tabularizing the Kc values, which consisted
    of a main difference to the previous FAO24 method (Pereira et al., 2015a). Thus,
    Kc and ETc in FAO56 refer to potential crop ET rates under optimal, well-watered
    crop production conditions, which often differ from the field and common practice
    where crop conditions are often not optimal due to insufficient or non-uniform
    irrigation, low crop density, less adequate soil and agronomic management and/or
    salinity. The tabulated Kc values in FAO56 or in the review papers (Jensen and
    Allen, 2016; Pereira et al., 2020a,b,d) refer to the standard climate and need
    to be adjusted to the local climate (eqs. 62 and 65 of FAO56). The potential ETc
    as computed from standard Kc values is then replaced by the actual crop ET, ETc
    act, and the standard Kc are replaced by the actual Kc act values, with Kc act
    =Ks Kc where Ks is a stress coefficient due to water deficiency or salinity effects,
    and that can be extended to other cultivation stresses. The concept of dual Kc
    was also adopted in addition to the traditional single one. The single Kc represents
    averaged soil evaporation (Es) and crop transpiration (Tc) from a cropped surface
    for typical frequencies of wetting. However, as noted by in the review by Pereira
    et al. (2015a), the single Kc only represents typical conditions that can vary
    with the wetting frequency by precipitation and irrigation, with the type of irrigation
    practiced and with crop management, namely the inter-row management in row crops.
    Adopting the concept of dual crop coefficient, Kc= Kcb+ Ke, where Kcb is the basal
    crop coefficient representing primarily plant transpiration and Ke is the evaporation
    coefficient that represents the contribution of evaporation from soil to total
    ET, the variation of both Es and Tc are considered independently. In view of this,
    the partition of ETc or ETc act into both these components as proposed by FAO56
    (Allen et al., 1998, 2005a) allows to better represent field and management issues
    when acting differently on Es and Tc. The two stage evaporation model of Ritchie
    (1972) is adopted for the calculation of Ke, which implies performing an independent
    water balance of the evaporation top layer of the soil. The FAO56 method is dealt
    in detail with the very recent reviews and updates of the single and basal crop
    coefficients (Pereira et al., 2020a through d). These reviews also focused on
    the accuracy of diverse ET measurement methods, namely the measurement of changes
    of soil water, eddy covariance, Bowen ratio energy balance, sap-flow, and remote
    sensing vegetation indices (Allen et al., 2011b; Pereira et al., 2020a,b). Crop
    water requirements (CWR, mm) consist of the seasonal amount of water required
    by a crop to achieve its potential production under a given environment. CWR correspond
    to the seasonal potential crop ET (ETc, mm) and added the seasonal leaching requirement
    (LR, mm) required to control effects of soil and water salinity in case of cropping
    in saline soils or when using salty water (including treated wastewater). LR is
    herein considered as part of the CWR given the importance for the crop yield and
    the soil environment to adopt appropriate salinity control. Salinity effects and
    related water management control measures were recently reviewed and discussed
    by Minhas et al. (2020). The net irrigation requirements (NIR, mm) consist of
    the amount of water that needs to be applied to the crop to fully satisfy its
    CWR when the water available through precipitation (P, mm), capillary rise (CR,
    mm) and soil water storage variation (SWvar, mm) are insufficient. NIR relative
    to the crop season, or to any selected time period, is given by the soil water
    balance as: (1) NIR = CWR – (P + SWvar + CR) + DP + RO where, in addition to variables
    previously defined, DP is deep percolation from the soil root zone (mm) and RO
    is runoff (mm), with all variables referring to the time period considered for
    the computation. The gross irrigation requirements (GIR, mm) for any time step
    is given as: (2) where BWUF is the beneficial water use fraction of the applied
    irrigation water (Pereira et al., 2012). BWUF is commonly referred as application
    efficiency when referring to the field, or combined conveyance, distribution and
    application efficiency when considering the operational losses in the conveyance
    and distribution canal and/or conduits systems in addition to application on the
    farm (Burt et al., 1997; Bos et al., 2005; Heermann and Solomon, 2007). 2.2. Computing
    the crop evapotranspiration: the one-step vs. the two-step approaches The Penman-Monteith
    combination equation (Monteith, 1965) may be used for computing crop ET as a one-step
    approach contrarily to the FAO56 method that adopts the two-step Kc-ETo product
    referred above. With the Penman-Monteith combination equation (PM-eq), crop ET
    is computed using the aerodynamic and bulk surface resistances of the crop; differently,
    with the FAO method crop ET is given as the product of the grass reference ET
    (ETo) by the crop coefficient (Kc). Kc represents the integrated differences between
    the considered crop and the reference crop in terms of aerodynamic and bulk surface
    resistances. ETo is derived from the PM combination equation parameterized for
    the grass reference crop. The Penman-Monteith combination equation (Monteith,
    1965) is generally written as (3) where λ is the latent heat of vaporization [MJ
    kg −1], Rn-G is the net balance of energy available at the surface [MJ m-2 d-1],
    (es-ea) represents the vapor pressure deficit (VPD) of air at the reference (weather
    measurement) height [kPa], ρ is mean air density [kg m-3], cp is specific heat
    of air at constant pressure [MJ kg-1 °C-1], Δ represents the slope of the saturation
    vapor pressure-temperature relationship at mean air temperature [kPa °C-1], γ
    is the psychometric constant [kPa °C-1], rs is the bulk surface resistance [s
    m-1], and ra is the aerodynamic resistance [s m-1]. The transfer of heat and vapor
    from the evaporative surface into the air in the turbulent layer above a canopy
    is determined by the aerodynamic resistance ra between the surface and the reference
    level above the canopy. That transfer is determined by the wind speed, the height
    of wind speed, air temperature and air humidity measurements, as well as crop
    height and canopy architecture (Perrier, 1982). The surface resistance rs for
    full-cover canopies is often expressed as a function of the stomatal resistance
    of a well-illuminated leaf (rl) and of the effective leaf area index (LAIeff).
    The use of the PM-eq for prediction of crop water requirements is difficult because
    crop height and canopy architecture change throughout the crop cycle, thus changing
    the framework for computing ra and rs, which also changes with rl, thus with leaf
    age and water availability conditions, as well as with LAIeff. In addition, for
    the same crop, ra and rs are influenced by differences among varieties, and crop
    management and irrigation practices. Moreover, resistances rl and rs are influenced
    by the climate and water availability, with rs increasing when soil water availability
    limits ET, the VPD increases and ra is higher; rs decreases when the energy available
    at the surface increases. According to Alves et al. (1998) and Alves and Pereira
    (2000), rs may be expressed as dependent of ra and of the weather variables as
    (4) where β is the Bowen ratio (the ratio between the sensible and latent heat
    fluxes). In this equation β plays the role of a water-stress indicator. This equation
    illustrates that the weather variables interact and their influences are inter-dependent,
    which adds to the difficulties in appropriately selecting rs, thus creating challenges
    in applying the PM-eq or “multi-layer” resistance equations such as the two-source
    Shuttleworth and Wallace (SW) equation (Shuttleworth and Wallace, 1985). Various
    applications of the PM-eq (Eq. 3) are reported in the literature and they show
    that the SWB is not required to consider water stress impacts since the parameterization
    of Eq. 3 takes into account the water stress, e.g. through the consideration of
    stomatal conductance or predawn leaf water potential (Rana et al., 1997, 2001;
    Zhang et al., 2011). However, Ortega-Farias et al. (2004, 2006) performed the
    adjustment to water stress using a normalized soil water factor, similar to the
    stress coefficient Ks described in the next Section, which computation requires
    a simple SWB. A few studies compared the PM-eq with the Kc-ETo approach (Lovelli
    et al., 2008; Irmak and Mutiibwa, 2009). The accuracy of ET estimates depends
    upon the parameterization of the PM-eq. The one-step PM and SW equations are excellent
    for ET simulation but they are basically used in research, while the two-step
    Kc-ETo is used both in research and to support field practice as per the recent
    reviews by Pereira et al. (2020a,b) and Rallo et al. (2020). The PM-eq (Eq. 3)
    is the base for the PM-ETo equation (Allen et al., 1994a,b, 1998), which for daily
    time steps computation takes the form (5) where, in addition to variables defined
    for Eq. (3), T is mean daily air temperature [°C] and u2 is wind speed [m s−1],
    with measurements at 2 m height. This represents a hypothetical crop with an assumed
    height of 0.12 m having a surface resistance of 70 s m−1 and an albedo of 0.23,
    closely resembling an extensive surface of green grass of uniform height, actively
    growing and adequately watered. This equation is also parameterized for hourly
    time steps (Allen et al., 2006). Kc represents an integration of the effects of
    three primary characteristics that distinguish the crop from the reference: crop
    height (affecting roughness and aerodynamic resistance); crop-soil surface resistance
    (related to leaf area, fraction of ground covered by vegetation, leaf age and
    condition, degree of stomatal control, and soil surface wetness); and albedo of
    the crop-soil surface (influenced by the fraction of ground covered by vegetation
    and soil surface wetness). It is defined through the ratio between potential crop
    evapotranspiration (ETc) and the reference ETo, thus (6) Kc = ETc/ETo The challenge,
    therefore, has been to summarize all referred differences relative to the PM-eq
    (Eq. 3) between the considered crop and the reference crop to just one parameter,
    Kc. Although, it was demonstrated (Pereira et al., 1999) that Kc values relate
    intimately with the ratios between ra and rs of the considered crop and the reference
    crop, which makes Kc a non-purely empirical parameter but a deterministic one.
    Though when using the two-step approach to compute crop ET, it is possible to
    achieve highly accurate estimation of crop ET, close to the accuracy obtained
    with the one-step PM-eq, despite the high requirements of the latter in terms
    of parameterization (Ortega-Farias et al., 2006; Lovelli et al., 2008; Irmak and
    Mutiibwa, 2009). 2.3. Soil water balance: the FAO56 method With the objective
    of managing irrigation in the day to day practice, instead of Eq. 1, the daily
    soil water balance applied to the entire root zone (Allen et al., 1998, 2007)
    may be expressed through computing the soil water depletion at the end of every
    day (Dr,i, mm), which is given as: (7) where Dr,i-1 is the root zone depletion
    at the end of previous day i-1 (mm), Pi is precipitation (mm), ROi is runoff (mm),
    Ii is the net irrigation depth that infiltrates the soil (mm), CRi is capillary
    rise from the shallow groundwater table (mm), ETc act,i is the actual crop evapotranspiration
    (mm), and DPi is deep percolation through the bottom of the root zone (mm), with
    all terms referring to day i. ETc act refers to both optimal and suboptimal crop
    and irrigation conditions, i.e., under full or deficit irrigation and/or diverse
    cropping practices. Solving the water balance equation (Eq. 7) requires soil water
    content observations (or their estimation from observed soil matric potential),
    which allow to estimate the root zone depletion Dr. A computational algorithm
    is required to perform a daily SWB, which is based upon the knowledge of soil
    hydraulic properties, the field capacity and wilting point (FC and θWP, m3 m−3)
    of various soil layers down to the bottom of the root zone. To estimate runoff,
    deep percolation and capillary rise, appropriate algorithms are required as discussed
    by Liu et al. (2006) and Allen et al. (2007). RO, DP and CR cannot be just estimated
    when an accurate SWB is to be performed, thus appropriate computational approaches
    are required, including simple spreadsheet applications to just support irrigation
    scheduling. ETc act is computed as: (8) ETc act=Ks Kc ETo = (Ks Kcb + Ke) ETo
    which requires knowing the standard values of Kc and/or Kcb and the daily estimation
    of the stress coefficient Ks, as well as the adjustment to climate of standard
    Kc mid, Kc end, Kcb mid and Kcb end values (eqs. 62 and 65 of FAO56). Kc ini and
    Kcb ini values have to be determined as recommended by Allen et al. (1998, 2005a,2005b).
    Indicative Kc and Kcb values are tabulated by Allen et al. (1998), Allen and Pereira
    (2009), Jensen and Allen (2016) and updated by Pereira et al. (2020a,b) and Rallo
    et al. (2020). FAO56 expressed Ks as a linear function of root zone depletion
    Dr when depletion exceeds the readily available water, RAW (mm), in the root zone,
    thus: (9a) (9b) where TAW and RAW are, respectively, the total and readily available
    soil water (mm), and p is the soil water depletion fraction for no stress (Allen
    et al., 1998). TAW is defined as the available soil water stored in the root zone
    with depth zr (m), thus computed as 1000 (θFC - θWP) zr, and RAW corresponds to
    the readily available portion of TAW, thus RAW = p TAW. Updated values for the
    p fractions for vegetable and field crops are tabulated by Pereira et al. (2020a,
    b). The value for Ks due to salinity stress is discussed in FAO56 (Allen et al.,
    1998) and in the review paper by Minhas et al. (2020). Referring to Eq. 9, it
    may be deduced that when no water stress occurs (Ks = 1.0) then θ≥θp, i.e. the
    soil water content is not below the threshold θp, which corresponds to the soil
    water content when the soil water depletion equals the depletion fraction p for
    no stress [0 - 1]. Therefore, θp is assumed as the soil water content threshold
    for no-stress or full irrigation: (10a) A management allowed depletion (MAD) larger
    than p is selected when deficit irrigation is adopted, i.e., when the depletion
    fraction exceeds p. The respective soil water threshold is then θMAD < θp: (10b)
    Examples on using these thresholds are given in Section 4.4. When adopting the
    dual Kc approach, it is required to separately compute Kcb and Ke and two SWB
    are required, the one relative to the root zone for computing transpiration, the
    other relative to the top soil layer, from where evaporation occurs, to compute
    soil evaporation. A spreadsheet calculator was provided in Annex 8 of FAO56 (Allen
    et al., 1998). The computation of Ke is based upon the assumption that evaporation
    from the soil is governed by the amount of water available in the upper soil layer
    from where water evaporates, and the amount of energy available at the soil surface.
    The latter depends upon the portion of wetted ground surface exposed to radiation
    and the portion of total energy consumed by transpiration. Ke is then calculated
    as: (11) K e = K r ( K c max − K c b ) ≤ f e w K c max where Kr is the evaporation
    reduction coefficient [0-1], few is the fraction of soil surface wetted and exposed
    to solar radiation, Kcb is the basal crop coefficient representing transpiration,
    and Kc max is the maximum value for Kc following rain or irrigation (Allen et
    al., 1998, 2005a). Kc max depends upon mid-season climate, through the wind speed
    u2 (m s−1) and the minimum relative humidity RHmin (%), and upon crop height h
    (m): (12) K c m a x = max 〈 { 1.2 + 0.04 ( u 2 - 2 ) - 0.004 ( R H m i n - 45
    ) ( h 3 ) 0.3 } , K c b + 0.05 〉 where u2 = 2 m s−1 and RHmin = 45 % characterize
    the standard climate (Allen et al., 1998). The depth of water depleted from the
    few fraction of soil wetted and exposed (De, mm), is computed from the daily water
    balance of the upper 0.10 to 0.15 m of the soil as (13) D e i = D e i − 1 − (
    P i − R O i ) − I n i f w + ( K e E T o f e w ) i + T s i where the subscript
    i refers to the day of estimation, Pi is the precipitation [mm], ROi is runoff
    [mm], Ii is the net irrigation depth [mm] that infiltrates the soil in the wetted
    fraction fw, (Ke ETo/few)i is the evaporation from the few fraction of the exposed
    soil surface [mm], and Ts i is the transpiration from the fw fraction of the evaporating
    soil layer [mm]. When De exceeds the readily evaporable water (REW), the evaporation
    rate decreases in proportion to the remaining water. Therefore, Kr (Eq. 11) is
    calculated as: (14a) K r = 1 for D e ≤ R E W (14b) K r = T E W − D e T E W − R
    E W for D e > R E W where REW and TEW are respectively the readily and total evaporable
    water in the soil evaporation layer of depth ze (m), which depend upon the soil
    textural and hydraulic characteristics of that soil layer. Further details on
    the water balance of the evaporation layer are discussed by Allen et al. (1998,
    2005a) and Rosa et al. (2012a, b). When the complete soil surface is fully wetted
    by precipitation or irrigation, the fraction few consists of the fraction of ground
    non-shaded by the vegetation (1-fc), thus few p = 1-fc, where fc is the average
    fraction covered by vegetation [0 – 1.0]. When only a fraction of the soil surface
    is wetted by irrigation, few i = min (1-fc, fw). These differences in few, thus
    in few Kc max (Eq. 11), evidence that it is required to compute separately Ke
    for the cases when rainfall and irrigation fully wet the ground, or when irrigation
    only partially wets the soil, e.g. under drip or furrow irrigation. Different
    few fractions then occur. A weighing coefficient for partitioning the energy available
    for soil evaporation depending upon fc and fw (Allen et al., 2005a, b; Rosa et
    al., 2012a) eases the daily Ke computation. The fraction fc should be observed
    in the field as reviewed by Pereira et al. (2020c); otherwise, it may be estimated
    according to Allen et al. (1998) as: (15) f c = ( K c b − K c min K c max − K
    c min ) 1 + 0.5 h where Kc min is the minimum Kc for dry, bare soil, generally
    0.15. The exponent "1 + 0.5 h" represents the effect of plant height on shading
    the soil and increasing the Kcb given a specific value for fc. (Kcb - Kc min)
    ≥ 0.01 for numerical stability. Eq. 11 is the base for partitioning ET. On the
    one hand, it shows that when the crop develops, from the initial to the mid-season
    stage, Kcb increases and the difference Kc max-Kcb therefore decreases, as well
    as the fraction few since fc also increases. Therefore, Ke decreases as much as
    Kcb and fc increase. Contrarily, during the late season Ke increases because Kcb
    and fc decrease. The rates of Kcb and fc variation, thus of Ke decrease or increase,
    change from a crop to another and with the management practices, with Kcb varying
    also with water and salinity stress (Ks, Eq. 9). On the other hand, Ke varies
    with the water amount available for evaporation, which depends upon Kr with the
    irrigation method and frequency of irrigation. The advantage of the adopted approach
    results from combining the variation of Kcb and Ke and adopting Kc max as the
    upper limit for Kcb+Ke. Therefore, there is the need for performing daily the
    water balance of the soil evaporation layer in addition to the root zone water
    balance, which increases the accuracy of computations. A discussion comparing
    the ET partition using the FAO56 dual Kc approach with that used in the popular
    AquaCrop model has been presented by Pereira et al. (2015b), which highlights
    the strengths and weaknesses of the FAO56 dual Kc approach. As referred by DeJonge
    and Thorp (2017), reported results with maize and cotton have shown that crop
    coefficient simulations with the dual “ETo-Kcb method better mimicked theoretical
    behavior, including spikes in the soil evaporation coefficient (Ke) due to irrigation
    and rainfall events and basal crop coefficient response as associated with simulated
    crop growth.” Consequently, the FAO56 approach has been implemented with the DSSAT
    Crop System Model (DeJonge and Thorp, 2017). 2.4. Soil water balance: transient
    state models Mechanistic approaches to the SWB commonly compute variably-saturated
    water flow as described by Richards’ equation: (16) ∂ θ ∂ t = ∂ ∂ z K h ∂ h ∂
    z − K h − S z , t where θ is the volumetric soil water content [L3 L−3], t is
    time [T], z is the vertical space coordinate [L], h is the pressure head [L],
    K is the hydraulic conductivity [L T−1], and S is the sink term accounting for
    water uptake by plant roots [L3 L−3 T−1]. The unsaturated soil hydraulic properties
    are often described with the van Genuchten-Mualem functional relationships (van
    Genuchten, 1980). These relationships require appropriate calibration. The sink
    term, S, may be calculated using the Feddes et al. (1978) approach where the potential
    transpiration rate, Tp [L T−1], is distributed over the root zone using the normalized
    root density distribution function, β(z,t) [L−1], and multiplied by the dimensionless
    stress response function, α(h, hϕ, z, t), that accounts for water and osmotic
    stresses. In HYDRUS-1D (Šimünek and Hopmans, 2009; Ramos et al., 2011) we have:
    (17) S ( h , h Φ , z , t ) = α ( h , h Φ , z , t ) S p ( z , t ) = α ( h , h Φ
    , z , t ) β ( z , t ) T p ( t ) where Sp(z,t) and S(h, hϕ, z, t) are the potential
    and actual volumes of water removed from unit volume of soil per unit of time
    [L3 L−3 T−1], respectively, and α(h, hϕ, z, t) is a prescribed dimensionless function
    of the soil water (h) and osmotic (hϕ) pressure heads (0≤α≤1). The actual transpiration
    rate, Ta [L T-1], is obtained by integrating Eq. (13) over the root domain LR:
    (18) T a = ∫ L R S ( h , h Φ , z , t ) d z = T p ∫ L R α ( h , h Φ , z , t ) β
    ( z , t ) d z It is generally assumed that the potential root water uptake is
    reduced when water stress occurs due to deficit irrigation and/or osmotic potential
    resulting from soil salinity or the use of saline irrigation waters. While the
    Richards’ equation is commonly adopted in a variety of models, the sink term may
    be different from a model to another. For solving the Richards’ equation, the
    formulation of the boundary conditions may be diverse. In SWAP (Vazifedoust et
    al., 2008; Xu et al., 2013), the upper boundary condition is determined by the
    fluxes of potential evapotranspiration computed with the PM-eq (Eq. 3). The model
    does not use the FAO56 method but it allows computing the actual Kc (Xu et al.,
    2013). Differently, with HYDRUS, the Kc-ETo approach is often used to define the
    potential ET flux at the upper boundary (Ramos et al., 2011); alternatively, Ramos
    et al. (2012) used the sum Kcb-ETo and Ke-ETo with Kcb and Ke obtained with a
    dual Kc partition tool. Transient state models may be calibrated purposefully
    for scheduling irrigation under selected conditions, e.g. the model SWB-2D for
    drip irrigated hedgerow orchards (Annandale et al., 2003). Transient state models
    usually perform the partition of ETc act with reference to the crop leaf area
    index (LAI), particularly when knowing its maximum values, LAImax. Because transient
    state models focus on the accurate simulation of water fluxes within and through
    the boundaries of the soil root zone, these models accurately compute DP and CR
    and, often also RO. When applied to rice, they can also simulate water depth in
    the paddies (Bhadra et al., 2013). These models may be used to parameterize steady
    state SWB models, e.g. the WAVE model was used to define the parametric DP and
    CR equations adopted in the model ISAREG (Liu et al., 2006) and later in SIMDualKc.
    Transient state models, since they are mechanistic models that accurately simulate
    the dynamics of transpiration, are commonly integrated with crop growth and yield
    models, e.g. SWACROP (Kabat et al., 1992) and SWATRER-SUCROS (Xevi and Feyen,
    1992). Currently, coupling of transient state and crop growth and yield models
    is commonly adopted, e.g. WOFOST and HYDRUS-1D (Zhou et al., 2012) or SWAP and
    EPIC (Xu et al., 2013). The advantage of transient state models is that soil water
    processes can be accurately described mechanistically, e.g. infiltration and water
    redistribution, root water uptake, deep percolation and capillary rise. However,
    the inputs of soil hydraulic properties, such as the soil water retention and
    permeability curves (respectively θ(h) and K(h) curves), are much more exigent
    than for simpler SWB models in terms of data acquisition and θ(h) and K(h) calibration.
    Often, the inverse model simulation needs to be adopted for their calibration
    before application. In addition, the vegetation parameters needed are much more
    complex than for FAO56-based SWB models. Therefore, these models are hard to parameterize
    and calibrate resulting more suitable for agronomic and irrigation research, and
    when assessing nitrates, chemicals and salinity dynamics in relation to crop growth
    and yield. Differently, the SWB models adopting the FAO56 methods are easier to
    use and appropriate to support practical irrigation scheduling and planning, as
    well as to assess the performance of irrigation management options. Along this
    line, the crop simulation models DSSAT-CSM, which basically require an accurate
    prediction of transpiration to predict biomass and yield accurately, recently
    adopted the FAO56 approaches (DeJonge and Thorp, 2017), namely the grass reference
    ETo and the FAO56 dual Kc approach. 2.5. Crop yields prediction and performance
    indicators for irrigation scheduling Knowledge of yield responses to water is
    required to construct irrigation scheduling models, namely aiming at developing
    appropriate irrigation schedules that cope with the variability of climatic conditions,
    water availability limitations, and the need to improve yields and economic returns.
    Crop growth models may then be used to predict biomass and yields in combination
    with predicted or assessed crop and irrigation management practices. The DSSAT-CSM
    models are often used for assessing yields when comparing irrigation management
    options (DeJonge et al., 2012; Thorp et al., 2014). By recently adopting the FAO56
    Kcb-ETo approach (Thorp et al., 2017), their use for assessing irrigation management
    options resulted easier to interpret. The crop growth and yield SWB AquaCrop (Raes
    et al., 2016) is also commonly used but, contrarily to the DSSAT models, its approach
    to calculating ET diverges from the FAO56 method. Another approach consists of
    coupling a crop model with a transient state model. e.g. WOFOST and HYDRUS-1D
    (Zhou et al., 2012) or SWAP and EPIC (Xu et al., 2013). These models may be very
    demanding in terms of parameterization and input data, but they are suitable when
    dealing with complex hydrologic and water quality conditions. Simple yield prediction
    approaches, such as the one by Jensen (1968), consist of a multiplicative parametric
    function that combines the effects of limited soil water on yield at various crop
    growth stages. Hanks (1974) developed the model PLANTGRO assuming that total dry
    matter production is directly proportional to the seasonal transpiration. For
    grain yield predictions, Hanks (1974) adapted the Jensen (1968) model and developed
    a multi-stage model (Hanks and Hill, 1980), while Stewart et al. (1977) assumed
    a linear dependence of the relative yield deficit from the relative evapotranspiration
    deficit, which is described as: (19) 1 - Y a Y m = K y ( 1 - E T c a c t E T c
    ) where Ky is the yield response factor, Ya and Ym are, respectively, the actual
    and maximum (potential) yields (kg ha−1), and ETc act and ETc are, respectively,
    the actual and potential crop evapotranspiration (mm) corresponding to the yields
    Ya and Ym. Ym may be observed or estimated. ETc act and ETc may be observed or
    computed with a SWB model. Ky values are tabulated for a wide range of crops (Doorenbos
    and Kassam, 1979) and they were updated recently (Minhas et al., 2020). Stewart
    et al. (1977) also proposed a multiple linear phasic model to account for the
    effects of water deficit during the vegetative, flowering and maturation stages
    using specific yield response factors (βi) for each stage i, which were tabulated
    by Doorenbos and Kassam (1979). Considering that transpiration is the ET component
    directly responsible for yield formation, and that various models perform the
    partition of ET, hence estimating transpiration, a modified version of Stewart’s
    model (Paredes et al., 2014) may be used to estimate Ya: (20) Y a ˆ = Y m - Y
    m K y ( T c - T c a c t ) T c where Tc act and Tc are, respectively, the seasonal
    actual and potential crop transpiration (mm), thus replacing ET in Eq. (19). Research
    has shown that both Stewart’s global and phasic models predict yields with appropriate
    accuracy for evaluating irrigation schedules, namely when using Eq. (20) with
    Tc act data computed with the SIMDualKc model. Fig. 1a shows that maize yield
    predictions with Eq. (20) match well the yields observed in experiments carried
    out in both Portugal and Uruguay (Paredes et al., 2014; Giménez et al., 2016),
    and Fig. 1b shows a similar match of soybean yields relative to experiments developed
    in China and Uruguay (Wei et al., 2015; Giménez et al., 2017). Download : Download

    (b) soybean (b0 - regression coefficient of a linear regression forced to the
    origin; R2 – coefficient of determination of the ordinary least squares regression,
    RMSE – root mean square error, NRMSE – normalized root mean square error). Water
    scarcity and global change lead irrigation water use to essentially aim at increased
    water productivity, water conservation and water saving. Water conservation refers
    to every policy, managerial measure, or user practice that aims at conserving
    or preserving the water resources and combating its degradation, namely focusing
    on its quality, while water saving aims at limiting or controlling the water demand
    and use, thus avoiding wastes and the misuse of water (Pereira et al., 2012; Pereira,
    2017). A comprehensive analysis on water conservation and saving measures and
    practices for a variety of agricultural uses was presented by Pereira et al. (2009,
    2012) and Jovanovic et al. (2020). Water productivity in agriculture (WP, kg m−3),
    also known as water use efficiency, may be generically defined as the ratio between
    the actual crop yield achieved (Ya) and the corresponding water use, which may
    refer to the total water use (TWU), hence including rainfall, to the irrigation
    water use (IWU), to the consumptive use (ETc act), or just to crop transpiration
    (Tc act). Therefore, different indicators result to assess diverse irrigation
    scheduling scenarios: (21) W P t o t a l = Y a T W U = Y a P + C R + Δ S W + I
    (22) W P I r r i g = Y a I W U (23) W P E T = Y a E T c a c t (24) W P T c = Y
    a T c a c t where P is rainfall, CR is capillary rise or groundwater contribution,
    ΔSW is the variation in soil water storage in the root zone from planting to harvesting,
    I is the amount of irrigation, ETc act is the actual crop evapotranspiration,
    and Tc act is the actual crop transpiration, all expressed in m3 and referring
    to the crop season. Ya in Eqs. (21) through (24) may be observed, or may be estimated
    with a crop growth and yield model or with a simple water-yield parametric function
    as reported above. The meaning of indicators in Eqs. (21), (22), (23), (24) is
    necessarily different and indicators should be selected considering the actual
    farming objectives, the respective implications in terms of resource, environment
    and climate change, and the data availability. An application of similar WP concepts
    to olive orchards, including a related economic analysis, was recently discussed
    by Fernández et al. (2020). Improving WP could lead to water saving in irrigation
    but it requires the consideration of various factors. WP may be increased by minimizing
    the non-beneficial water uses such as percolation through the bottom of the root
    zone, runoff out of the irrigated fields, and losses by evaporation and wind drift
    in sprinkling. A high WP could be attained when increasing yields but, often,
    a higher WP is obtained when the crop is deliberately under-irrigated, thus when
    water stress is allowed in some less-sensitive crop stages; nevertheless, a yield
    reduction will then occur. 3. Overview of models aimed at improved irrigation
    scheduling 3.1. Soil water balance simulation models from FAO24 to FAO56 Many
    models have been proposed since the early 1980’s following the publication of
    FAO24 (Doorenbos and Pruitt, 1977), which has been the landmark in the domain
    of crop water requirements and irrigation scheduling. Model papers considered
    herein limit to those having an identified software, adequate reference to calibration
    and/or validation, and not referring to single uses only. In addition, since the
    objectives of the current review refer to FAO56 with focusing on the dual Kc approach
    and considering that transient state models are dealt in Section 2.4, the reviewed
    SWB refer to models using a Kc approach, mainly referring to FAO24 and to FAO56.
    Numerous SWB models have been developed since the 1980’s as early reviewed by
    Lascano (1991). Related articles were often presented in research reports or to
    scientific conferences (ASAE, 1981, 1990; Feyen, 1987; Pereira et al., 1992, 1995;
    Smith et al., 1996; Ragab et al., 1996). These articles show a great variety of
    approaches, using the FAO Kc-ETo and/or transient state models, which received
    the preference of researchers by that time (Belmans et al., 1983). Developments
    also included landscape and turf grass irrigation. ETo equations were diverse
    because FAO24 (Doorenbos and Pruitt, 1977) proposed various alternative equations.
    Howell et al. (1990) presented a first application of the Penman-Monteith grass
    reference equation proposed by Allen et al. (1989) when a commonly used ETo equation
    was the Penman equation. Without a common ETo definition and equation, standard
    Kc values could not be defined despite a consolidated set of Kc values was presented
    in FAO24 (Doorenbos and Pruitt, 1977) for numerous field, vegetable and woody
    crops. These authors proposed the well-known segmented FAO Kc curve but various
    curvilinear approaches were in use (e.g., Wright, 1982; HiIl, 1991). However,
    the segmented Kc curve was adopted by several authors (Howell et al., 1990; Combre
    and Kamieniarz, 1992; Teixeira and Pereira, 1992). Single Kc models of the 80’s
    and 90’s were often developed for application at farm level and evolved to support
    farm irrigators’ communities. A first model has been developed with CIMIS, the
    California Irrigation Management Information System (Snyder, 1986), which keeps
    evolving nowadays and is based on a large grid of weather stations and a very
    large number of users (https://cimis.water.ca.gov/ accessed on 27 May 2020) and
    partners. Among the latter is the Satellite Irrigation Management Support framework
    (SIMS, Melton et al., 2012, 2020). The model CROPWAT (Smith, 1988, 1992) is paradigmatic
    since it consisted of a database built from FAO24 data (Doorenbos and Pruitt,
    1977), a supplementary CLIMWAT weather database, a reference ET calculator and
    a water balance computational tool able to propose an irrigation scheduling calendar
    for the selected crop, soil and field. The model was updated after the FAO experts
    consultation on crop water requirements (Smith et al., 1991) and the publication
    of FAO 56, and has been successively upgraded. The version CROPWAT 8.0 has been
    recently released. BIdriCo (Danuso et al., 1995) is updated and is operating with
    real time weather data to support irrigation farmers of the Friuli Venezia Giulia
    region, Italy. IRRICANNE is an irrigation scheduling simulation model (Combre
    and Kamieniarz, 1992) designed to support sugarcane producers and was used for
    many years in the Island of Reunion. The model RENANA (Giannerini, 1995) was applied
    to support farmers irrigation scheduling in the Emilia-Romagna Region and evolved
    to a large-scale web based DSS, IRRINET, in use by farmers of various regions
    of Italy (Mannini et al., 2013), as well as to support irrigation water delivery
    (Genovesi et al., 2019). Three models early reported - IRSIS (de Goes Calmon et
    al., 1992), ISAREG (Teixeira and Pereira, 1992) and PILOTE (Mailhol et al., 1996)
    - were designed for both research and application in the field practice. IRSIS
    (Raes et al., 1988) was modified to produce BUDGET (Raes et al., 2006) that was
    further developed with extensions for improved water balance and yield assessment
    (Shrestha et al., 2010), then becoming the SWB basis of the crop model AquaCrop
    (Raes et al., 2016). ISAREG adopted the PM-ETo equation following the FAO Expert
    Consultation that decided its adoption (Smith et al., 1991). ISAREG was first
    modified to support real time farmers advising with the development of RELREG
    (Teixeira et al., 1995), later turning into a web based DSS, WEBISAREG (Branco
    et al., 2005), and developing GIS facilities, HYDROGEST (Mateus et al., 2007).
    However, since the Irrigation Associations did not develop local support to farmers,
    the model was used essentially for research after adoption of computational tools
    relative to DP, CR and salinity (Pereira et al., 2007, 2009). It is currently
    used in several countries, e.g. Brazil (Saraiva et al., 2017), Bulgaria (Popova
    et al., 2014) and China (Zheng et al., 2014). Meanwhile, ISAREG was the base of
    SIMDualKc (Rosa et al., 2012a), described in the next Section. PILOTE software
    has been continuously improved and it became a crop model with various capabilities
    including irrigation and crop management (Mailhol et al., 2004, 2018). CADSM (Walker
    et al., 1995) was the first distributed SWB model aimed at computing the aggregated
    irrigation demand at the command area of a collective irrigation system using
    the Kc-ETo approach. It was also one of the first models using the PM-ETo equation
    after it was proposed to a wide audience (Allen et al., 1994a,b). Similarly, the
    combined use of the ISAREG model and the paddy basins simulation model IRRICEP
    (Paulo et al., 1995) was adopted to simulate the demand hydrographs at the sector
    level in a collective irrigation system using the FAO methods (Teixeira et al.,
    1996). Buchleiter (1995) presented the model SCHED for scheduling irrigations
    with a center-pivot system. However, this type of approach is currently replaced
    by precision irrigation software, namely variable rate scheduling with support
    of wireless sensors (e.g. O’Shaughnessy et al., 2012). Hess (1996) reported on
    a microcomputer irrigation-scheduling model to be available for farmers since
    they were progressively adopting such computing facilities; however, with changes
    in hardware the approach was abandoned. The SIMDSS (Malano et al., 1996) was developed
    for practical irrigation scheduling and improved surface irrigation practices
    aimed at an integrated real-time management for pastures in SE Australia. MARKVAND
    was a DSS system for farmers use in Denmark, which software provides information
    on timing and volumes of irrigation as well as on the expected economic returns
    (Plauborg et al., 1996). Changes in technologies led to abandon these type of
    models. Models including the partitioning of ET into transpiration and soil evaporation
    were rare. The first was reported by Wright (1982) but his pioneer approach aimed
    at deriving Kcb when soil water evaporation could be considered nil, i.e. the
    soil surface was dry but transpiration was near optimal. The approach applied
    well to infrequent water applications but not to highly frequent wettings; however,
    data reported by this author have been fundamental in developing the FAO56 dual
    Kc approach (Allen et al., 1998). Tuzet et al. (1992) developed an approach where
    ET partition was supported by the observed LAI. Many researchers lately followed
    a LAI approach for partitioning ET. Further developments in using a dual Kc were
    initiated after publication of FAO56, mainly using its spreadsheet for calculation
    of Kcb and Ke, which still is used at present. A first SWB model relative to paddy
    rice using the Kc-ETo approach, the IRRICEP model, was reported by Paulo et al.
    (1995). The model required not only the calibration of Kc values but the calibration
    of soil hydraulic properties determining the computation of percolation adopting
    a Darcy approach, as well as lateral seepage to downstream paddies and drainage
    ditches. That model was later used by Mao et al. (2004) adopting the PM-ETo equation.
    Singh et al. (2001) modified the model SAWAH to adopt the Kc-ETo approach and
    a partition of actual crop ET based upon an empirical exponential function of
    LAI. Agrawal et al. (2004) developed a Visual Basic SWB model where the Kc-ETo
    is used, seepage is computed with the Dupuit approach and percolation is determined
    with a soil water simulation using partial differential equations distinguishing
    water ponded conditions and unsaturated conditions when intermittent irrigation
    is used. Transient state approaches for the ponded and the unsaturated conditions
    were also used by Khepar et al. (2000) when modeling intermittent paddy irrigation.
    A different approach is reported by Jeon et al. (2005), who developed PADDIMOD.
    In this model, surface drainage and percolation are estimated with parametric
    equations, which require parameters calibration. These referred models, despite
    posterior to the publication of FAO56, did not adopt the PM-ETo equation but FAO24
    equations. 3.2. Soil water balance simulation models after FAO56 This review focused

    are used: Csalt – Salt concentration in the soil solution; ECe – Electrical conductivity
    of the soil saturation extract; ETsalt – Actual crop evapotranspiration affected
    by salinity; Ksat – Soil hydraulic conductivity at saturation. Abbreviations:
    n/r – not reported; seep – seepage. Single Kc models in Table 1 are diverse in
    terms of the target crops; these can be single annual crops, e.g. maize, wheat,
    cotton or paddy rice, or various annuals and/or perennials. They have in common
    the use of the FAO56 PM-ETo equation, in some cases also considering alternative
    temperature based methods, and the use of the stress coefficient Ks (Eq. 9), including
    modifications for paddies water balance. Models have a variety of base input parameters.
    Soil base parameters commonly include θFC and θWP, but θsat and Ksat may also
    be included when deep percolation and capillary rise are among the model outputs.
    Only one model (ISAREG) uses the input of electrical conductivity of the soil
    saturation extract (ECe, dS m−1) to compute the ET reduction due to salinity (ETsalt)
    as described in FAO56 and by Minhas et al. (2020). All reported models were calibrated
    and validated, generally using SWC data, a few using ETc act or Tc act (Consoli
    et al., 2016; Mancosu et al., 2016), and the ponded water depths in case of paddy
    rice (de Silva and Rushton, 2008; Inthavong et al., 2011). The model outputs are
    diverse but all models, in addition to ET, provide DP estimates. Several models
    also compute RO but CR is only provided by few models (Pereira et al., 2003; Shang
    and Mao, 2006; Chopart et al., 2007; Boegh et al., 2009; Consoli et al., 2016).
    Paddy water models outputs refer to the ponded water and to DP, seepage and drainage.
    References to the possible use of remote sensing data are very limited. SWB models
    using the dual Kc approach are referred in Table 2. As for single Kc models, they
    are diverse in terms of the target crops but most of them can be used with both
    annual and perennial crops. A few refer to annuals or only to specific crops (wheat,
    maize, groundnuts and paddy rice). All use the PM-ETo equation and the stress
    coefficient Ks (Eq. 9), including those modified for paddies. Models have a variety
    of base soil input parameters. Soil parameters commonly include θFC and θWP, a
    few θsat and Ksat, and some models (Annandale et al., 1999; Ragab, 2002) also
    have a transient state approach and require θ(h) and K(θ). Salinity base data
    on ECe are used in the AQUACROP and SIMDualKc models, while SALTMED and “SWB”
    use the salt concentration in the soil water. Models are calibrated and validated
    with SWC data but some models may be calibrated with ETc act or Tc act data (Rosa
    et al., 2012a, b; Campos et al., 2016); when they also predict actual yields,
    Ya data may also be used for calibration (Ragab, 2002; Raes et al., 2012). Model
    outputs are diverse but all models, in addition to ETc act and Tc act, provide
    for DP while a few also compute RO. The computation of CR is only available from
    the models SALTMED, AquaCrop, SIMDualKc and the model reported by Han et al. (2018).
    The paddy rice model RiceWCA (Yang et al., 2012) outputs are different from those
    referred before and include the predicted applied water, DP, seepage, and tail
    water runoff. A few models refer to the possibility of using remote sensing-retrieved
    data. This review recognized that few models are able to compute groundwater contribution
    from a water table as well as impacts of salinity. DSSAT crop models using Kc-ETo
    with the dual Kc approach (DeJonge and Thorp, 2017) could be added in Table 2
    but they are very different from the listed models and rarely used for irrigation
    scheduling. Farmers’ information models commonly using Kcb values derived from
    remote sensing vegetation indices, such as SIMS (Melton et al., 2012, 2020; Cahn
    and Johnson, 2017), consist also of a peculiar group of dual Kc models that require
    mention. For selecting the best crop irrigation schedules, the SWB models adopt
    user-friendly software that helps the users to handle data and, often, to compute
    indicators such as those referred in Section 2.5. Performance scenarios may be
    the object of ranking, e.g. when DSS approaches adopt multi-criteria analysis
    as discussed by Darouich et al. (2014, 2017), namely when the selection of irrigation
    schedules is tied to the performance of the irrigation method. However, the use
    of multi-criteria analysis is rare in irrigation scheduling and, commonly, only
    simple comparisons of indicators are used (Paredes et al., 2014, 2017a,b; Pereira
    et al., 2015b). 4. The dual Kc soil water balance approach using the model SIMDualKc
    4.1. Brief presentation of the model SIMDualKc is a quite unique software model
    that performs a daily soil water balance at the field scale (Rosa et al., 2012a,b)
    adopting the dual Kc approach to compute and partition crop ET into Tc and Es.
    Data inputs and model outcomes are described in Fig. 2 where the flowchart of
    the model is presented. In general, compulsory data inputs are common to other
    SWB models that adopt the FAO56 dual Kc approach, although requirements may change
    with the type of algorithms used in computations. Facultative data differ depending
    upon the specific objectives of the simulation. This is the case for data used
    to compute runoff, deep percolation, groundwater contribution, as well as effects
    of mulches and no-till planting, active ground cover, intercropping, and soil
    and water salinity. Naturally, model outcomes also differ depending on the modelling
    objectives. Download : Download high-res image (919KB) Download : Download full-size
    image Fig. 2. Simplified flowchart of SIMDualKc model (modified from Rosa et al.,
    2012a). Model calibration consists of adjusting the influential model parameters
    within their reasonable ranges so that the model results are consistent with available
    observed data, thus estimation errors are minimized. The process of validation
    permits the verification of the goodness of fitting when the model is used with
    the set of calibrated parameters but with different, independent data sets, without
    tuning such parameters. Calibration and validation of models and appropriate goodness-of-fit
    indicators are a must for every model as discussed by several authors (e.g., Moriasi
    et al., 2007; Wang et al., 2012) and by Pereira et al. (2015b) relative to SIMDualKc.
    The calibration parameters of SIMDualKc consist of: Kcb and p relative to the
    various crop growth stages; Ze, TEW and REW characterizing the soil evaporation
    layer; the parameter CN relative to the runoff algorithm; and the parameters relative
    to the DP and CR parametric functions. Initial sets of these parameters are inputs
    to the model, which are improved through calibration. Soil water content observations
    are the most commonly used for calibration, e.g. Fandiño et al. (2012, 2015) for
    a vineyard and for hop for industry, Zhao et al. (2013) for maize and wheat, Wu
    et al. (2016) for a groundwater dependent grassland, and Paredes et al. (2017a)
    relative to pea for industry. Calibration may also be performed by comparing observed
    eddy covariance ET with model computed ETc act for field crops (Zhang et al.,
    2013; Tian et al., 2016) and citrus orchards (Peddinti and Kambhammettu, 2019),
    or by comparing observed sap-flow transpiration data with simulated Tc act (Paço
    et al., 2012, 2019; Qiu et al., 2015). Descriptions of the calibration and validation
    processes are provided in the cited applications. Various methods may be used
    to estimate accurately actual crop ET as reviewed by Allen et al. (2011b) and
    Pereira et al. (2020a,b). Methods include the measurement of the soil water content
    for deriving ET from the SWB, the measurement of ETc act using eddy covariance
    (EC) or Bowen ratio energy balance (BREB) systems, as well as the measurement
    of Tc act with sap-flow systems. All these methods are potentially very accurate
    as point measurements, and the EC and BREB are used in such a way that their footprint
    may span a relatively large area representative of the vegetation. EC is receiving
    the preference of many ET users, but measurements of the soil water content (SWC)
    and sap-flow continue to be largely used. Fig. 3a shows the comparisons of simulated
    and observed seasonal SWC data of a wheat crop used to calibrate SIMDualKc, and
    Fig. 3b shows a similar comparison of simulated wheat ETc act with EC observed
    data, both obtained at the same location in North China plain (Zhang et al., 2013;
    Zhao et al., 2013). The goodness-of-fit indicators resulted similar, i.e. there
    was no advantage of one calibration over the other, which means that a user may
    select the most convenient approach to calibrate a model if measurements of SWC,
    ETc act or Tc act are accurately performed. Download : Download high-res image

    the calibration of SIMDualKc for winter wheat in North China plain: (a) simulated
    vs. observed soil water content (adapted from Zhao et al., 2013) and (b) simulated
    vs. observed ETc act (adapted from Zhang et al., 2013). 4.2. Deriving crop coefficients
    Deriving Kcb and Kc from SWB simulations is a main capability of SWB models, e.g.
    SALTMED (Silva et al., 2012), which is quite common for vegetable and field crops
    as reported in recent reviews (Pereira et al., 2020a,b); however, it is uncommon
    for fruit trees and vines. In the case of evergreen trees and vines, a full crop
    coefficient curve requires that, in addition to the Kc and Kcb for the initial,
    mid-season and end-season, the Kc and Kcb values for the non-growing period are
    also known. Moreover, due to climate differences between the growing and non-growing
    seasons, the Kc and Kcb curves may be substantially different. Nevertheless, there
    are various examples of derivation of Kc and Kcb for orchards (e.g., Peddinti
    and Kambhammettu, 2019). As an example for evergreen woody crops, a study performed
    with irrigated olives in southern Portugal (Paço et al., 2019) is analyzed. Crop
    transpiration was measured with the sap-flow Granier method, which data provided
    for calibrating SIMDualKc, thus obtaining the best Kcb values for the initial,
    mid-season, end-season and non-growing periods. A few observations of ETc act
    with an EC system were also used for testing. The Kcb curve (Fig. 4) resulted
    in a FAO segmented curve with higher Kcb during the growing season, spring and
    summer, when irrigation was applied, and smaller Kcb in the non-growing period,
    when transpiration is naturally low. Differently, because it depends on soil evaporation,
    the time averaged Kc (=Kcb+Ke) resulted smaller during the active growing period,
    when Es and Ke were low because precipitation was reduced and drip lines were
    located directly in line with the crop and shaded by the crop canopy, thus irrigation
    was applied under trees’ shadow. Contrarily, Kc was larger in fall and winter,
    when rainfall occurred (Fig. 4). A segmented Kc curve resulted with low values
    by the mid-season and a Kcb curve with a higher value during the mid-season. The
    Kc curve changed with rainfall, with Kc mid and Kc in the non-growing season,
    which is higher when rainfall was larger (Fig. 4a) and smaller under dry conditions.
    Contrarily, the standard Kcb values did not change. When considering the daily
    Kcb act, changes occurred depending on the water stress of the olive crop. The
    daily Kc act changed a lot, causing the referred changes in the Kc curve. Download

    Standard and actual basal and single crop coefficient and soil evaporation coefficient
    curves for a super-intensive olive orchard in two contrasting rainfall years:
    a) wet year and b) dry year (Paço et al., 2019). Deriving Kcb and Kc from SWB
    simulations is also uncommon for forage crops managed with cuttings. The FAO56
    approach for Kcb and Kc of forages managed with cuttings consists of adopting
    a segmented curve for each cut (Allen et al., 1998). SIMDualKc has proved appropriate
    to support the derivation of Kcb and Kc under these conditions in an application
    to Tifton 85 bermudagrass in Santa Maria, Brazil (Paredes et al., 2018b). The
    cutting treatments were spaced according to selected cumulative growth degree
    days (CGDD), which varied among treatments. With this approach, shorter time spans
    between cuttings resulted in summer and longer ones in winter. Results for Kcb
    and Kc with cuttings at CGDD of 248 °C, which refer to six forage cuttings, and
    372 °C, with only four cuttings, are presented in Fig. 5a and 5b respectively.
    The computed time average Kc before the cuttings are 0.96 for the CGDD 248 °C
    and 0.97 for CGDD 372 °C while the Kc after cuttings, when the forage crop is
    shorter, decreased to 0.92 and 0.95, respectively. Reported time averaged Kc before
    and after cuttings are close due to abundant precipitation during the crop season.
    The standard Kcb before the cuttings are 0.93 for the treatment with CGDD of 248 °C
    and 0.94 for CGDD of 372 °C while Kcb values after cuttings were respectively
    0.83 and 0.84. Values for the standard Kcb would be more distinct if the forage
    height would be smaller after cuttings. Results show that the approach proposed
    in FAO56 for Kc and Kcb curves for forages managed with cuttings was applicable
    with SIMDualKc. Download : Download high-res image (381KB) Download : Download

    where cuttings were performed for cumulative growth degree days of (a) 248 °C
    and (b) 372 °C (adapted from Paredes et al., 2018b). 4.3. ET and crop coefficients
    of relay inter-cropping An approach based on light/shadow effects was used to
    estimate ETc act and its partition for crops cultivated in a relay inter-cropping
    system. The mutual effects of shading by the crops combined in an inter-crop system
    were estimated by considering the height of both crops and the fraction of ground
    covered by each crop throughout the crop season (Miao et al., 2016). This principle
    is based upon the approach of Allen and Pereira (2009) to compute Kcb for a fruit
    crop cultivated with active ground cover. Naming the first planted crop as dominant
    and the second as the subordinate crop, and considering their interaction, the
    Kcb of the intercrop (Kcb inter) may be estimated daily as (Miao et al., 2016):
    (25) K c b i n t e r = m a x K c b s u b + K d d o m K c b d o m - K c b s u b
    ; K c b d o m + K d s u b K c b s u b - K c b d o m where Kcb dom and Kcb sub
    are, respectively, the Kcb values of the dominant and subordinate crops when mono-cropped,
    and Kd dom and Kd sub are the density coefficients of the dominant and subordinate
    crops. Kd are computed as: (26a) K d d o m = f s c d o m ( 1 1 + m a x ( h d o
    m - h s u b ; 0 ) ) (26b) K d s u b = f s c s u b ( 1 1 + m a x ( h s u b - h
    d o m ; 0 ) ) where fsc dom and fsc sub are the fractions of the soil surface
    cropped with the dominant and the subordinate crops, respectively, and hdom and
    hsub are the heights of the dominant and subordinate crops, respectively. The
    max function in Eqs. (25) and (26) aims at considering that the conditions observed
    at earlier stages, Kcb dom > Kcb sub and h dom >h sub, may change with the growth
    of the subordinate crop, thus making Kcb sub > Kcb dom and h sub > h dom. For
    example, this is the case of the wheat-sunflower intercrop, where sunflower develops
    taller than wheat when the latter matures, thus Kcb sunf > Kcb wheat and hsunf
    > hwheat. The application of this methodology to a winter wheat-sunflower relay
    inter-cropping in Hetao, China, is illustrated in Figs. 6a and b, which show the
    Kcb, Kcb act and Ke relative to wheat and sunflower mono-cropped, while Fig. 6c
    shows Kcb, Kcb act and Ke for the inter-cropping of both. Fig. 6a shows that a
    small stress occurred for wheat while Fig. 6b evidences that sunflower was largely
    stressed during the mid- and late-season stages, thus indicating that a large
    irrigation should have been given early in the mid-season. The resulting potential
    Kcb of the inter-cropping system (Fig. 6c) was smaller than that of the crops
    when single-cropped, with Kcb act following the trends evidenced for both crops
    when cropped alone. The Ke values also followed the Ke curves of both crops but
    they were different because basin irrigation was used and water was applied to
    the entire field, including when the second crop was not sowed yet, thus producing
    high evaporation in the non-cropped parts of the field. Fig. 6c shows that four
    irrigations were applied to the intercrop, however too early for sunflower that,
    contrarily to wheat, exhibited large water stress during mid- and late seasons.
    This is a consequence of avoiding irrigation by the end-season of wheat. The example
    shows that the use of a calibrated model helps interpreting and evaluating the
    irrigation schedules of intercropped crops. Download : Download high-res image

    China, 2011 (adapted from Miao et al., 2016). 4.4. Assessing alternative planting
    dates An important issue in developing irrigation calendars is assessing the impacts
    of changing planting dates. Such changes may be desired when anticipating planting
    dates may increase the probability of rainfall early in the season, or to avoid
    hot waves in the late season. This search of better planting dates may be performed
    with irrigation scheduling models and using a statistical analysis of weather
    time series, namely when supplemental irrigation is practiced, such as with small
    grains and grain legumes in the Mediterranean area. However, few examples are
    available in the literature and they mostly refer to the impacts on crop yields
    rather than on water requirements. Abi-Saab et al. (2014) provided a good example
    relative to sunflower and soybean cropped in Lebanon, while Montoya and Otero
    (2019) reported an application to soybean in Uruguay, in both cases using the
    AquaCrop model. A different approach, using BUDGET, consisted of performing an
    analysis of risk relative to maize planting dates (Kipkorir et al., 2007). Various
    supplemental irrigation schedules for malting barley for industry were assessed
    for two contrasting rainfall years (Pereira et al., 2015b; Paredes et al., 2017b)
    using a cultivar that adjusts to a wide planting period, from November to January.
    Center-pivot irrigation was used with depths of 8 mm per event and ceasing 25
    days before harvest to prevent water-related diseases that could affect malt grain
    quality. Based upon the observed sowing dates, the following alternatives were
    considered: 16th and 30th of December, and 6th and 16th of January. These sowing
    dates were assessed in terms of impacts on the total water use (TWU), forecasted
    yields (Ya), and water productivity (WPtotal, Eq. 21) defined in Section 2.5.
    They were also assessed considering two contrasting rainfall years - wet (2013)
    and dry (2012) – and various supplemental irrigation scenarios: Sc. 1: Full irrigation
    as practiced by the farmer (MAD = p); Sc. 2: Very mild water deficit during the
    entire season (MAD = 1.10 p, Eq. 10); Sc. 3: Moderate water deficit during most
    of the crop season (MAD = 1.20 p), but very mild (MAD = 1.10 p) during flowering/grain
    filling; Sc. 4: Moderate water stress during the entire season (MAD = 1.20 p);
    Sc. 5: Rainfed. Fig. 7 shows the predicted TWU, yield and WP indicators for the
    four sowing dates and five irrigation management scenarios. The adoption of early
    sowing leads to a smaller TWU than late sowing, particularly in the wet year.
    In the dry year, differences in TWU among irrigation management scenarios are
    larger than those due to planting dates. Yields show to increase for the last
    two planting dates but, again, differences in yields are greater among irrigation
    scenarios. Under dry conditions, the use of supplemental irrigation to meet barley
    water requirements is essential since yields are much lower under rainfed conditions.
    Differences in water productivity are larger among planting dates and quite small
    among irrigation management scenarios. Combining information relative to these
    three indicators, it was identified that the best sowing dates are likely those
    around the first days of January. The mid-January date is discouraged because
    the crop cycle enters in a period of high water demand by the late season, which
    increases TWU and decreases WP. The consideration of economic criteria would also
    be beneficial. This example shows the usefulness of a SWB model in recommending
    best planting dates to help farmers’ decisions. This can also be based on weather
    forecasts that provide for anticipating crop growth conditions. Download : Download

    The analysis of the water use by a crop allows to perform the field water balances
    and assess the time dynamics of its input and output terms, thus determining which
    are the consumptive and non-consumptive uses of water and, likely more important,
    which uses and consumptions are beneficial or, contrarily, consist of water waste
    and losses (Pereira et al., 2012). Molden and Sakthivadivel (2011) applied similar
    water use concepts at the basin scale, and Lecina et al. (2010) used this type
    of assessment to evaluate improvements of surface and sprinkler irrigation at
    the project scale. An application at field scale aimed at maximizing beneficial
    water use and controlling the non-beneficial one using the DSSAT-maize model is
    reported by Jiang et al. (2016). An application of the SIMDualKc model to a malt
    barley cropped under center-pivot irrigation in Central Portugal (Pereira et al.,
    2015b) is used herein as example of assessing beneficial and non-beneficial water
    uses throughout the crop cycle. The model was calibrated using field data of the
    dry year 2012 and was validated with data of the wet year 2013. The various SWB
    terms for both years and four crop growth stages are presented in Table 3. Groundwater
    contribution was not included in the balance because the water table was below
    10 m deep. Irrigation water application depths averaging 7 mm per event were adopted
    to prevent high water stress. Table 3. Water balance terms with discrimination
    of beneficial and non-beneficial uses (mm) relative to a supplemental irrigated

    available soil water, RO – surface runoff, DP – deep percolation, ETc - crop evapotranspiration,
    ETc act - actual crop evapotranspiration, Tc act - actual crop transpiration,
    Es – soil evaporation. The non-consumptive water use terms, runoff (RO) and deep
    percolation (DP), were about nil in the dry year. RO was 10.5 % of the seasonal
    precipitation (P) in the wet year while DP, a potentially recoverable resource
    providing for vadose zone and aquifer recharge, represented nearly 30 % of P.
    The consumptive use terms, Tc act and Es, respectively beneficial and non-beneficial,
    showed a similar partition in both years, with transpiration representing 77 %
    of ETc act in the wet year and 79 % in the dry year. Es was smaller in the dry
    year because there was insufficient water supply during the late season, with
    ETc act representing only 64 % of the potential ETc. This fact occurred due to
    irrigation cutoff 25 days before harvesting in both years, with stored soil water
    supplying the crop in the wet year but not in the dry year. Otherwise, differences
    in consumptive water use in both years are small and are due to the higher climatic
    demand in the dry year, when ETc was larger by 56 mm relative to the wet year.
    Performing water use assessment adopting this approach is uncommon but could be
    helpful when considering issues for water conservation. 4.6. Assessing the groundwater
    contribution from a shallow watertable The assessment of groundwater contribution
    (GC) to crop water needs in the presence of a shallow water table is often performed
    with a transient state modeling approach (e.g. Ragab, 2002; Jovanovic et al.,
    2004; Acharya and Mylavarapu, 2015). Empirical functions are used by others, such
    as Yang et al. (2007), who computed GC as a function of the depth of the water
    table, the soil water storage and crop ET, which consists of a modification of
    the empirical approach proposed in FAO24 (Doorenbos and Pruitt, 1977). Differently,
    Liu et al. (2006) developed a parametric function for use in ISAREG and, later,
    with SIMDualKc, which parameters are calibrated during the process of model calibration
    (e.g., Cholpankulov et al., 2008). With this approach, GC is a function of the
    actual water table depth, the actual soil water storage in the root zone, crop
    evapotranspiration and potential (maximum) capillary rise, which depends upon
    the soil hydraulic characteristics that regulate the intensity of upward fluxes.
    Liu et al. (2006) proposed sets of default parameters relative to soil textural
    and hydraulic properties and that are improved through model calibration. The
    use of SIMDualKc to assess consumptive and non-consumptive water use by a groundwater
    dependent Leymus chinensis grassland in eastern Inner Mongolia, China (Wu et al.,
    2016) is selected as an example of groundwater contribution assessment in a wet
    landscape. The analysis focused on the wet year of 2008 and the dry year of 2009.
    The daily dynamics of P, Tc act, Es and GC (all in mm) during the growth season
    is presented in Fig. 8, which clearly shows that the upward fluxes from the shallow
    water table were the main fraction of the water supply to the studied grassland.
    GC is essential to meet the water requirements of this crop. GC was small when
    there was enough soil water for extraction by the grassland but increased when
    crop water demand was high and the SWC decreased. Comparing both years (Fig. 8),
    it is evident that Tc act was similar in both years because GC supplemented rainfall,
    thus becoming much higher in the dry year, when rainfall was insufficient. Considering
    that ground cover by the grassland was very large, Es depended on precipitation
    only, thus being higher in the wet year. Download : Download high-res image (572KB)

    dependent Leymus chinensis grassland in eastern Inner Mongolia, China, comparing
    a wet and a dry year with focusing on the groundwater contribution from a shallow
    water table (adapted from Wu et al., 2016). Results in Table 4 show that, despite
    rainfall in the wet year was nearly 3 times that of the dry year, ETc act were
    not very different in both years, and Tc act were quite similar because GC effectively
    supplemented the lack of rainfall. The ratios between GC and the total water supply
    (TWS, mm) were very distinct, with GC/TWS = 33 % in the wet year and 59 % in the
    dry year. These ratios quantified well the relative importance of GC for the water
    supply of the considered grassland. The ratios between GC and actual transpiration
    also showed the role of GC in meeting the grassland water requirements since GC/Tc
    act increased from 46 to 63 % from the wet to the dry year. Table 4. The terms

    scheduling aims at optimizing the timing and amount of water applied in the day-to-day
    irrigation management. It requires combining a model with data streaming from
    diverse sources such as weather forecasts, soil and plant sensors, or remote sensing
    data. Models referred in Table 1, Table 2 may be adopted for this purpose but
    they are generally used to support research. In the past, several attempts to
    adapt and use SWB for supporting real time irrigation have been performed. Teixeira
    et al. (1995) developed and tested RELREG, a model derived from ISAREG, that could
    be updated every day, and used weather data predicted around three days in advance.
    Other models were developed and in use at farm level, e.g. SCHED for center-pivot
    irrigation (Buchleiter, 1995) and, for application at large scale, models such
    as RENANA (Giannerini, 1995). The latter has been continuously updated and gave
    origin to IRRIFRAME and IRRINET, widely used in Italy (Mannini et al., 2013; Giannerini
    and Genovesi, 2015), which enter in the era of the cloud data models. In South
    Africa, a review of irrigation scheduling atmospheric-based computer models was
    published by Annandale et al. (2011). Computerized real-time irrigation scheduling
    revolved around a number of historic models such as BEWAB (pre-plant seasonal
    irrigation schedules based on target yields; Bennie et al., 1988), “SWB” (providing
    daily water schedules based on calculated ETc act; Annandale et al., 1999), PUTU
    (De Jager et al., 2001), and various specialized models for irrigation management
    of sugarcane (Singels, 2007). The adoption of scientific irrigation scheduling
    was investigated in a technical project by Stevens et al. (2005). The outcomes
    were that the uptake of scientific irrigation scheduling by farmers is low, it
    is highly dependent on many other day-to-day farming and business operations,
    and there is generally need for engaging dedicated managers, extensionists or
    consultants to run a scientifically-based irrigation scheduling program on commercial
    farms. There are several web-based tools that were purposefully designed for supporting
    farmers in real-time irrigation decision-making such as IRRINET (Mannini et al.,
    2013; Giannerini and Genovesi, 2015) in Emilia Romagna Italy, the California Irrigation
    Management System (CIMIS, https://cimis.water.ca.gov/, accessed on 27 May 2020),
    the Arkansas Irrigation Scheduler (AIS, https://irrigweb.uaex.edu/, accessed on
    27 May 2020), or the Mississippi irrigation scheduling tool (MIST). The SAPWAT
    model, originally developed by Crosby and Crosby (1999) with several improved
    versions (van Heerden and Walker, 2016), is used to determine crop water requirements
    and water allocations in South African water management areas. Other models with
    diverse workflows and computational procedures are applied for supporting farmers
    decision making, namely integrating SWB models, but they are rarely the object
    of scientific publications or information about calibration. Examples are the
    IRRIGA SYSTEM© (https://www.irrigasystem.com/, accessed on 25 May 2020) used both
    in South America and in Europe, IrrigaSys (http://irrigasys.maretec.org/, accessed
    on 27 May 2020) used in Vale do Sorraia, Portugal, and Irristrat™ (http://www.hidrosoph.com/EN/index.html,
    accessed on 27 May 2020) also applied in Portugal for both orchards and annual
    crops. The developing field of information and communication technology (ICT)
    opened up a variety of opportunities for smart agriculture in general, and irrigation
    scheduling in particular, by making use of Internet of Things (IoT), satellites
    and drones, robotics and artificial intelligence to improve farming operations,
    management of irrigation schedules and fertigation, and to achieve better yields,
    quality of products and profits. Tzounis et al. (2017) provided a review of potential
    applications of IoT technologies in agriculture. The drivers for these technologies
    are large volumes of data that are generated in space and time, and commonly referred
    to as Big Data. Big Data can be defined as huge datasets (commonly in the order
    of magnitude of TB) originating from a diversity of sources that makes them difficult
    to be collected, stored and analysed by conventional tools and techniques (Chen
    and Zhang, 2014; Ylijoki and Porras, 2016). They can be categorized into structured
    data that can be easily stored in tabular format (e.g. soil and plant measurements,
    remote sensing georeferenced data), unstructured data (e.g. text, video, audio
    and images) or semi-structured data (e.g. emails and XML files) that are usually
    inconsistent to store and process in customary databases (Lee, 2017). In order
    to extract usable information from the variety of sources of information to the
    benefit of researchers, practitioners and farm managers, these data need to be
    processed through systems, such as machine learning, and packaged into tools that
    facilitate interpretation and decision-making. Systems of heterogeneous sensors
    and networks for collection and communication of data are commonly referred to
    as Internet of Things (IoT). Given the vast amount of information and storage
    space that is often required, the processing, storage and analyses of these data
    can be done via Internet servers and infrastructure that are specifically designed
    for this purpose (e.g. Cloud Computing) (Tzounis et al., 2017). Ultimately, data
    need to be packaged into information tools, prescriptive/predictive models and
    decision-support systems that can aid decision-making on farms. Depending on data
    volume and computing requirements, irrigation scheduling tools can reside on cloud-based
    platforms (Bartlett et al., 2015). This is particularly the case when the tools/apps
    require information from large databases, e.g. soil properties, climate, satellite-derived
    observations. In other instances, soil input and climatic data can be obtained
    from localized sources, e.g. soil measurements and weather forecasts, and all
    calculations can be performed in reasonable time with algorithms running in the
    background (e.g. Internet apps). Several examples of these IoT applications for
    irrigation scheduling were reported in the literature and described below. The
    IoT infrastructure provides the opportunity to replace models, such as the above-mentioned
    SCHED, with automation-model systems applied to lateral moving systems coupled
    with sensors that provide for variable rate irrigation and nutrients applications,
    thus moving from the simple water scheduling to precision agriculture (Han et
    al., 2009). A review on variable rate issues for sprinkler systems, including
    an analysis of sensor systems usable for such purposes, was recently proposed
    by O’Shaughnessy et al. (2016). Similar approaches are used with drip-irrigated
    horticultural crops (Perea et al., 2017) and woody crops (Fernández, 2017). Payero
    et al. (2017) developed a communication system for transferring wireless soil
    water sensors data to an open-sources platform (https://thingspeak.com, accessed
    on 25 May 2020), where data are hosted and visualized in the form of usable information
    to support decision-making. However, SWB models remain popular tools for supporting
    irrigation scheduling. For operational irrigation schedules, using real-time models
    requires daily updated actual weather data, which may not be fully available.
    Thus, alternative sources of climatic data have been tested showing good accuracy,
    such as the use of re-analysis data for estimating PM-ETo (e.g. Paredes et al.,
    2018a), or satellite derived climatic products as referred by Paredes et al. (2020b).
    Since weather forecasts generally provide for incomplete data sets (precipitation
    and temperature), computing ETo requires simplified approaches using temperature
    data only, namely the Penman-Monteith temperature (PMT) and the Hargreaves and
    Samani equation (HS-eq) (Paredes and Pereira, 2019; Paredes et al., 2020a). Thus,
    a main challenge in using models for supporting irrigation scheduling is to use
    short-term weather forecasts that could support real-time irrigation scheduling
    and, considering larger range forecasts, to plan irrigation in advance (Kusunose
    and Mahmood, 2016; Klemm and McPherson, 2017). Studies on the use of short-term
    weather forecasts to support irrigation scheduling focus more on precipitation
    than on climatic demand (ETo). The study by Cai et al. (2009) focused on the use
    of short-term weather forecast messages provided by the National Meteorological
    Institute of China for estimating ETo and supporting irrigation scheduling, showing
    the good adequacy particularly for estimation of crop ET using a SWB model. A
    similar but updated approach is reported by Zhang et al. (2018). Lorite et al.
    (2015) developed a methodology based on the use of weather forecast data from
    freely and easily accessible online information for determining irrigation scheduling,
    reporting good accuracy for ETo estimations. Other studies focus on evaluating
    the use of short-term forecasts for real-time decision support for irrigation
    scheduling in terms of net profit and water savings. Cai et al. (2011) assessed
    the use of rainfall short-term forecasts provided by the National Oceanic and
    Atmospheric Administration (NOAA). Despite the imperfect forecasts, results showed
    net profit of up to 8.5 % as well as high water savings ranging from 11.0 to 26.9
    % when compared to modelled soil moisture information. The study by Hejazi et
    al. (2014) focused on the use of reanalysis-based short-term weather forecasts
    relative to rainfall and ETo for supporting irrigation decision-making, reporting
    on average an expected profit of up to 3 % and a water saving ranging from 4 to
    6 %. Jamal et al. (2018), using the Soil Water Atmosphere Plant (SWAP) model,
    reported an overall good performance of using probabilistic seasonal weather forecasts
    to support chickpea real-time irrigation scheduling. Differently, Linker et al.
    (2018), using the AquaCrop model for irrigation scheduling and yield predictions
    coupled with 4 to 6-day weather forecasts, reported an overall inadequacy of the
    forecasts for several locations (Denmark, Greece, Italy and Portugal) and crops
    (potato, cotton, tomato and maize); in addition, these authors also outlined that
    there was no considerable advantage of using those forecasts relative to historical
    average data. Overall, the use of short-term weather forecasts keeps being a bottleneck
    due to their uncertainty/inaccuracy. Combining SWB model predictions with plant
    indicators (Ferreira, 2017) and/or soil sensors, is also an option that has been
    investigated, e.g. Cancela et al. (2015) used SIMDualKc with an automatic control
    irrigation system supported by a low cost wireless soil moisture sensors network.
    Thus, these tools rely less on weather data, and more on soil and plant sensors,
    which calls for new approaches in using the FAO56 method. An example of such new
    approaches is the model reported by Schwartz et al. (2020) aimed at actual Kc
    for maize when deficit irrigation is used and non-uniform soils also affect the
    crop and the available soil water. The use of soil water sensors is recognized
    as having a great importance for the accuracy of modern SWB modeling approaches
    (El-Naggar et al., 2020). The use of canopy temperature sensors is also recognized
    as contributing to improved accuracy (Han et al., 2018). Remote sensing data provide
    the opportunity to model at large scale and they typically fall in the domain
    of Big Data. This includes both data originating from unmanned aerial vehicles
    (UAV, Ortega-Farias et al., 2016; Tang et al., 2019) and satellites. Two main
    approaches may be considered: energy balance models and vegetation indices. Models
    such as SEBAL (Surface Energy Balance Algorithm of Land), TSEB (Two-Source Energy
    Balance) and METRIC (Mapping Evapotranspiration with Internalized Calibration)
    are quite accurate in assessing crop evapotranspiration from the energy balance
    (Bastiaanssen et al., 1998; Allen et al., 2011a; French et al., 2015; Dhungel
    et al., 2016). ET from remote sensing may also be used to derive Kc or Kcb values.
    Vegetation indices, mainly the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) and
    the Soil Adjusted Vegetation Index (SAVI), are often used to estimate Kc and Kcb
    values (Johnson and Trout, 2012; Pôças et al., 2015; Campos et al., 2017). Satellite
    Kc data are then assimilated into SWB models. Another issue is the assessment
    of crop stress indicators from remote sensing (Pôças et al., 2017), namely using
    UAV. The use of optical/thermal satellite imagery at farm level would also allow
    drawing water requirement maps and implementing precise irrigation (Hendrickx
    et al., 2016). Melton et al. (2012, 2020) described the SIMS framework that combines
    NASA’s Terrestrial Observation and Prediction System (TOPS), Landsat and MODIS
    satellite imagery, and a surface sensors network to map indicators of crop irrigation
    demand and to develop information products to support irrigation management and
    other water use decisions. Li et al. (2018) described and tested a new method
    for sequential data assimilation that allows integrating soil water content measurements
    into the Community Land Model (CLM) aiming to improve irrigation scheduling. Evaluation
    of the method was performed on several citrus orchards allowing to save on average
    24 % of water relative to the farmers’ irrigation schedules while the use of the
    irrigation schedules based upon the FAO56 SWB provided for similar average water
    savings of 22 %. The development of mobile and on-line applications (apps) has
    also been investigated, with support of cloud computing and IoT. This kind of
    tools allows to provide to farmers easy-to-use information (Car et al., 2012),
    particularly when the information is conveyed using text messaging service (SMS).
    Todorovic et al. (2016) described and evaluated an automatized decision support
    system (Hydro-Tech) available as an app; Hydro-Tech integrates FAO56 methods,
    including the SWB, with continuous soil sensor-based monitoring, short-term weather
    forecasts, remote monitoring of the water supply network, diverse tools for data-cloud
    processing, and an economic and eco-efficiency assessment tool for optimizing
    irrigation scheduling. Evaluations performed in farmers’ fields with diverse crops
    (vegetables and fruit orchards) in the Apulia region, Italy, showed potential
    water savings ranging from 5 % to 20 % relative to the schedules used by farmers.
    Goap et al. (2018) presented an IoT-based smart irrigation management system,
    available as an app, using machine learning technology to predict crop irrigation
    requirements when combining sensing soil moisture along with the forecasts of
    precipitation, air temperature and humidity. Good accuracy of soil moisture predictions
    was reported thus allowing improving irrigation scheduling. An irrigation scheduling
    app (Bluleaf®) was evaluated by Abi-Saab et al. (2019) using field observations
    and showing its accuracy for estimations of soil moisture content and leaf water
    potential along the wheat season. In addition, the tool was able to enhance water
    savings by almost 26 % relative to the farmer’s traditional schedule. The progression
    of the satellite-based SEBAL model into an operational tool for irrigation scheduling
    is of particular interest. The private venture eLEAF (https://eleaf.com, accessed
    on 25 May 2020) developed a number of applications of interest to irrigation scheduling,
    namely PiMapping®7 (Pixel Intelligence Mapping), CropLook for field crops, as
    well as GrapeLook and FruitLook for grapes and fruit trees in the Western Cape,
    South Africa. The applications are based on satellite information to produce evapotranspiration
    maps and data that farmers and practitioners can access through a web portal (https://www.fruitlook.co.za/,
    accessed on 25 May 2020). A similar service providing information that can be
    accessed with different devices is IrriSat (https://www.irrisat.com/en/home-2,
    accessed on 25 May 2020). The Portuguese Association of Horticulture also makes
    available to farmers an app for real-time irrigation advice, Manna Irrigation
    Intelligence (https://aphorticultura.pt/2020/01/13/manna-irrigation-intelligence-tecnologia-de-deteccao-remota/,
    accessed on 27 May 2020), which bases upon a SWB model, remote sensing data and
    weather forecasts. Advances in ICT provide great opportunities to make use of
    large volumes of data and sources (sensors, models, remote sensing, images, tweets,
    farmers’ knowledge and experience, etc.). For using the Kc-ETo approach, ETo may
    be estimated with reduced datasets using the PMT and HS-eq approaches which require,
    among other, ground observed data, gridded and reanalysis data, and/or Meteosat
    Second Generation products, as well as forecasted weather data (Allen et al.,
    2020; Paredes et al., 2020a, b). Kc data sets refer to the updated tabulated standard
    Kc and Kcb values (Pereira et al., 2020a,b) and to the use of the A&P approach
    to compute Kcb and Kc from fc and height (Allen and Pereira, 2009; Pereira et
    al., 2020c,d). The challenge is to streamline these diversely structured data
    into usable and reliable information. Although major advances have been documented
    in the literature, the level of uptake is still not widespread mainly due to the
    need to own devices, applications, costs of services, etc. Maintenance of these
    systems can also be expensive in terms of hardware (e.g. sensors exposed in the
    field), securing a steady power supply, network and software stability, data storage
    infrastructure, security and access control. Nevertheless, given the volume of
    usable information that can potentially be produced to optimize farming production,
    it can be expected that IoT will become a more and more prominent feature in smart
    farming. 6. Conclusions and recommendations The current review has shown that
    SWB models have an enormous potential for irrigation scheduling including the
    assessment of alternative crop management practices, as well as biophysical and
    economic indicators of crop water productivity. The FAO56 methodology adopted
    in SWB is very accurate with moderate data requirements; simpler SWB models have
    been adopted for supporting irrigation scheduling but likely at a greater risk
    of water balance inaccuracies, namely when deep percolation and capillary rise
    are not properly taken into consideration and when Kc estimation is less appropriate.
    Research users may also prefer to adopt mechanistic, high-input intensive models
    having capabilities to simulate crop growth and yield as depending not only on
    water, but also on nutrients and other practices. Trends for future also refer
    to the adoption of crop growth and yield models for irrigation scheduling, at
    least for research purposes; the adoption of the FAO56 method in the DSSAT models
    already performed (DeJonge and Thorp, 2017) consists of an excellent foundation
    for this purpose. Easy to parameterize and calibrate, field and crop-focused SWB
    models will likely continue to be used by farmers and farm advisers as well as
    using the cloud data facilities at the large scale. However, trends for IoT and
    cloud computing seem to lean towards simple crop ET computations, likely using
    the Kc-ETo approach. Then, ETo is likely estimated from temperature using the
    FAO56 recommended approaches (PMT and HS-eq), or is derived from reanalysis products,
    gridded data or Meteosat Second Generation products, as well as using forecasted
    weather data. Future trends are also envisaged with farmers using models with
    ready to use information through mobile phones and smartphone apps. This approach
    is easier to apply with IoT or cloud data. In fact, simpler models provide acceptable
    to good indicative information to support basic irrigation decisions while more
    complex models are difficult to be deployed for the variety of users in terms
    of crops and cropping practices and management. It is therefore recommended that
    IoT models use the FAO56 method, including the updated FAO56 temperature based
    ETo, and the updated data sets of Kc and Kcb, or with application of the A&P approach
    to estimate Kcb and Kc from the fraction of ground cover and crop height, that
    are well proved and tested at various locations. Innovation in cloud data and
    IoT models needs to enlarge the present focus on solving data acquisition and
    sensors management to the quality of crop and ET computations, since this approach
    may support attaining better water productivity and water saving, which are definitely
    relevant in terms of facing climate change. A main opportunity for future is the
    use of remote sensing and the integration of remotely-sensed data into the SWB
    and crop growth models. Two main approaches may be considered (energy balance
    models and vegetation indices) as well as diverse sources of information (satellite
    imagery, imagery obtained from drones and infrared thermometry measurements on
    the ground). The dual Kc approach is already used in remote sensing applications
    for estimating ETc of various crops, which compared well with the Kcb estimated
    using the SIMDualKc model for many crops. Thus, results show that for real-time
    irrigation management the Kcb derived from remotely sensed vegetation indices
    may be used to adjust SIMDualKc and similar models’ simulations in near real-time,
    particularly when using sensors from satellites with high revisiting frequency.
    An effective exchange between research and practice represents a great challenge
    in SWB models use and development. Research uses models to better and more accurately
    understand the processes relative to soil water fluxes and transport in the soil-plant-atmosphere
    continuum. Irrigators need that a SWB model responds to their need for knowing
    when and how much water to apply to a crop in a given environment and in a defined
    development stage. The users require timely and simple responses, very easy to
    interpret. SWB models for research and practice already are, and will keep being
    distinct. The question is therefore how and which information created from research
    shall pass into practice and which type of SWB will facilitate both new knowledge
    and its transfer to practice. Likely this requires that research considers transferability
    as a main option, but that freedom of research is not affected by the need for
    transferability of results. Is the development of more and more sophisticated
    models a need? Is scrutiny of field data quality a priority? Is the consideration
    of the energy balance, namely through crop coefficients, an essential approach
    in research? Is empirical research, with a minimal use of models to be continued?
    Would it be advantageous to bring into research the models used in practice? These
    are questions that future research should debate and substantiate. Declaration

    \ advanced remote sensing systems, more accurate retrievals of crop water\nstatus\
    \ are being made at the individual crop level to aid in precision irrigation.\
    \ This paper summarises\nthe use of remote sensing for the estimation of water\
    \ status in horticultural crops. The remote\nmeasurements of the water potential,\
    \ soil moisture, evapotranspiration, canopy 3D structure, and\nvigour for water\
    \ status estimation are presented in this comprehensive review. These parameters\n\
    directly or indirectly provide estimates of crop water status, which is critically\
    \ important for irrigation\nmanagement in farms. The review is organised into\
    \ four main sections: (i) remote sensing platforms;\n(ii) the remote sensor suite;\
    \ (iii) techniques adopted for horticultural applications and indicators of\n\
    water status; and, (iv) case studies of the use of remote sensing in horticultural\
    \ crops. Finally, the\nauthors’ view is presented with regard to future prospects\
    \ and research gaps in the estimation of the\ncrop water status for precision\
    \ irrigation.\nKeywords: UAS; UAV; drone; unmanned; satellite; water stress; irrigation;\
    \ vegetation index\n1. Introduction\nUnderstanding the water status of crops is\
    \ important for optimal management and application\nof water to accommodate for\
    \ inter and intra-ﬁeld variability to achieve a speciﬁc target, such as\nmaximum\
    \ water use eﬃciency, yield, quality, or proﬁtability [1,2]. The importance of\
    \ optimal water\nmanagement in agriculture in semi-arid or arid regions has become\
    \ increasingly important in light\nof recent water scarcities through reduced\
    \ allocations, as well as increased demand due to greater\nareas under production\
    \ [3,4]. Climate change is expected to further intensify the situation due to\n\
    the increased frequency of heatwaves and drought episodes [5]. Climate change\
    \ coupled with the\nnecessity to increase food production due to an increase in\
    \ global population has placed pressure on\nhorticultural sector to improve eﬃciencies\
    \ in resources use, e.g., water, for sustainable farming [6–10].\nHorticultural\
    \ crops will have to produce more ‘crop-per-drop’ in the face of limited water\
    \ resources.\nInformed management of water resources whilst maintaining or increasing\
    \ crop quality and yield are\nthe primary goals of irrigation scheduling in horticulture.\
    \ These goals can be achieved by improving\nour understanding of the water status\
    \ of the crops at key phenological stages of development.\nTraditional decision-making\
    \ for irrigation of horticultural crops includes using information from\na combination\
    \ of sources such as historical regimes, soil moisture measurements, visual assessments\
    \ of\nsoil and/or crop, weather data including evapotranspiration (ET), and measurements\
    \ of crop water\nstatus using direct-, proximal- or remote-sensing techniques\
    \ [11–13]. Some growers undertake routine\nground-based measurements, e.g., pressure\
    \ chamber, for estimation of crop water status to make\ndecisions on irrigation\
    \ [14–16]. These ground-based measurements are robust; however, destructive,\n\
    Agronomy 2020, 10, 140; doi:10.3390/agronomy10010140\nwww.mdpi.com/journal/agronomy\n\
    Agronomy 2020, 10, 140\n2 of 35\ncumbersome, and expensive to acquire a reasonable\
    \ amount of data [14,16–18]. Consequently, the\nmeasured leaf is assumed to represent\
    \ the average population of leaves of the individual crop, and\na few crops are\
    \ assumed to represent the average population of the entire irrigation block.\
    \ As a\nresult, over- or under-watering can occur, which can lower yield and fruit\
    \ quality [19–22]. This is\nespecially evident for non-homogenous blocks where\
    \ spatial variability of soil and water status is\nexpected [23–25].\nTo address\
    \ some of the limitations of ground-based measurements, remote measurement\ntechniques\
    \ were introduced with capabilities to measure at higher spatial resolution, larger\
    \ area, and\non a regular basis [26–29]. Remote sensing, in particular, unmanned\
    \ aircraft systems (UAS), presents a\nﬂexible platform to deploy on-demand sensors\
    \ as a tool to eﬃciently and non-destructively measure\ncrop water status [30].\
    \ Using thermal and spectral signatures, remote sensing techniques can be used\n\
    to characterise a crop’s water status. Knowledge of crop water status allows growers\
    \ to more eﬃciently\nschedule irrigation (i.e., when and how much water to apply).\
    \ In this regard, UAS platforms provide a\nconvenient methodology to monitor the\
    \ water status across a farm, both spatially and temporally at\nthe canopy level\
    \ [31–33]. The spectral, spatial, and temporal ﬂexibility oﬀered by UAS-based\
    \ remote\nsensing may in future assist growers in irrigation decision-making [34,35].\n\
    This review provides an overview of the application of remote sensing to understand\
    \ the\ncrop’s water status (e.g., leaf/stem water potential, leaf/canopy conductance),\
    \ soil moisture, ET, and\nphysiological attributes, all of which can contribute\
    \ to understanding the crop’s water status to\nimplement precision irrigation.\
    \ Although the key focus of this review is UAS-based remote sensing,\na comparison\
    \ has been undertaken with other remote sensing platforms, such as earth observation\n\
    satellites, which are being increasingly used to acquire similar information.\
    \ In the following sections,\nwe provide an overview of the most common remote\
    \ sensing platforms in horticulture, various sensors\nused for remote sensing,\
    \ and several predictive indices of crop water status. Two case studies of remote\n\
    sensing in horticultural crops, grapevine and almond, are then presented followed\
    \ by an overview of\nthe current research gaps and future prospects.\n2. Remote\
    \ Sensing Platforms\nGround-based direct or proximal sensors acquire instantaneous\
    \ water status measurement from\na spatial location. For decision-making purposes,\
    \ the data is generally collected from multiple\nlocations across a ﬁeld, which\
    \ allows geospatial interpolation, such as kriging, to be applied [36–38].\nThis\
    \ scale of data collection is, however, cumbersome, ineﬃcient, and error-prone,\
    \ especially for water\nstatus measurements of large areas [17]. Monitoring and\
    \ observing farms at a larger spatial scale\nprompted the launch of several earth\
    \ observation satellite systems that typically operate at an altitude\nof 180–2000\
    \ km [39]. Manned high-altitude aircraft (operating within few km) and, more recently,\
    \ UAS\n(operating under 120 m) ﬁlled the spatial gap between high-resolution ground\
    \ measurements and\nrelatively low-resolution satellite measurements [40,41].\
    \ In the context of water status estimation for\nhorticultural crops, all the\
    \ aforementioned remote sensing platforms are utilised depending on the\nuser\
    \ requirements [23,42,43]. Each remote sensing platform has its own advantage\
    \ and shortcomings.\nThe decision to obtain remote sensing crop water status data\
    \ from one or more of these platforms will\ndepend on the spatial and temporal\
    \ resolution desired. Satellite and manned aircraft can be useful\nfor regional-scale\
    \ characterisation, whereas UAS can be more useful to map the intra-ﬁeld variability.\n\
    Vehicle-based ground systems also possess similar measurement capabilities, like\
    \ remote sensing,\nhowever, at a smaller scale [44,45]. These systems can move\
    \ within the horticultural rows obtaining\nwater status measurements of adjacent\
    \ plants while the vehicle is moving, enabling them to cover a\nrelatively larger\
    \ area as compared to ground-based direct measurements [46–48].\n2.1. Satellite\
    \ Systems\nThe use of satellite systems for remote sensing started with the launch\
    \ of Landsat-1 in 1972 [39,49].\nThe subsequent launch of SPOT-1 in 1986 and Ikonos\
    \ in 1999 opened the era of commercial satellite\nAgronomy 2020, 10, 140\n3 of\
    \ 35\nsystems that resulted in rapid improvement in imaging performance, including\
    \ spatial and spectral\nresolution [50]. Continued launch of satellites from the\
    \ same families, with newer sensor models\nand improved capability, resulted in\
    \ the formation of satellite constellations (e.g., Landsat, Sentinel,\nSPOT, RapidEye,\
    \ GeoEye/WorldView families). The satellite constellation substantially improved\
    \ the\nrevisit cycle of the satellite system [51]. Recently, the miniature form\
    \ of the satellite termed Nanosat or\nCubesat has been developed, which can be\
    \ deployed on the same orbit in a large number (20s–100s),\nenabling frequent\
    \ and high-resolution data acquisition (e.g., Dove satellite from Planet Labs)\
    \ [52].\nThe earth observation satellite system, such as Landsat, Sentinel, MODIS,\
    \ RapidEye, and GeoEye,\nhave been used to study horticultural crops (Table 1).\
    \ These satellite system oﬀer camera systems\nwith spectral bands readily available\
    \ in visible, near infrared (NIR), short-wave infrared (SWIR), and\nthermal infrared\
    \ (TIR). The measurement in these bands provides opportunities to study a crop’s\
    \ water\nstatus indirectly via, for example, calculation of the normalised diﬀerence\
    \ vegetation index (NDVI),\ncrop water stress index (CWSI), and ET [8–10] at the\
    \ ﬁeld- and regional-scales.\nTable 1. Some satellite systems that have been used\
    \ to study the water status of horticultural crops.\nSatellites\nBand Numbers:\

    \ = thermal infrared, Pan = panchromatic, C = coastal, Ci = cirrus, RE = red edge,\
    \ WV = water vapour.\nThe reﬂected/emitted electromagnetic energy from the crop\
    \ reaching the sensor is recorded at a\nspeciﬁc wavelength. The width of the observed\
    \ wavelength expressed in full width at half maximum\n(FWHM) is called spectral\
    \ resolution. The number of observed bands and the spectral resolution\nindicates\
    \ the ability of the satellite to resolve spectral features on the earth’s surface.\
    \ Commonly used\nearth observation satellite systems possess between four and\
    \ 15 bands with approximately 20–200 nm\nFWHM spectral resolution. The bands are\
    \ generally designated for the visible and NIR region with\nextended capabilities\
    \ in SWIR, TIR, as well as red edge region (Table 1). The most widely used band\n\
    combinations to study the water status of vegetation are the visible, NIR and\
    \ TIR bands [23,25,53,54].\nWith the plethora of satellite systems currently available,\
    \ user requirements on band combination\nmay be achieved by using multiple satellites.\
    \ However, acquiring an extra or a narrower band to the\nexisting capabilities\
    \ is not possible.\nThe ground distance covered per pixel of the satellite image\
    \ is called the spatial resolution,\nwhereby, a higher spatial resolution indicates\
    \ a smaller ground distance. Existing satellite systems,\ndue to their lower spatial\
    \ resolution and large coverage, are suited to study larger regions [55]. For\
    \ a\nsmaller observation area, such as a farm block, an irrigation zone, a single\
    \ row of the horticultural crop,\nor a single canopy, this spatial resolution\
    \ is considered sub-optimal. Often, a pixel of the satellite image\ncomprises\
    \ of multiple rows and multiple canopies of horticultural crops [42,56]. Thus,\
    \ the spectral\nresponse on a single pixel of the satellite image includes a mixed\
    \ spectral signal from the canopy,\ninter-row vegetation and/or bare soil. The\
    \ mixed-pixel is particularly unavoidable in horticultural\ncrops with large inter-row\
    \ surfaces, introducing errors in satellite-based estimations [42,56]. Improving\n\
    the spatial resolution from freely available Landsat/Sentinel satellites (spatial\
    \ resolution 10–15 m) to\nsuch as WorldView-3 (spatial resolution 0.3 m), does\
    \ not necessarily resolve single canopies of many\nhorticultural crops.\nCurrent\
    \ satellite systems generally oﬀer a temporal resolution of about 1–2 weeks this\
    \ resolution\ncorresponds to the satellite’s revisit interval (Table 1). For example,\
    \ freely available Landsat-8 and\nSentinel-2 oﬀer revisit cycles of 16 and 5 days,\
    \ respectively. Although the MODIS sensor on NASA’s\nAgronomy 2020, 10, 140\n\
    4 of 35\nTerra and Aqua satellites oﬀer a greater temporal resolution (1–2 days),\
    \ its spatial resolution is relatively\ncoarse (250 m–1 km) to be valuable for\
    \ horticulture [25]. The revisit cycle of satellites does not alone\nrepresent\
    \ the timeframe on which the data can be interpreted. For instance, post-data\
    \ acquisition,\nthere are often delays in data transfer to the ground station,\
    \ handling, and delivery to the end user.\nThe end user then needs to process\
    \ the data before making an interpretation. Such processing can\nbe a combination\
    \ of atmospheric, radiometric, and geometric corrections, where applicable [57,58].\n\
    Furthermore, as the agricultural applications of the satellite imagery are illumination\
    \ sensitive and\nweather dependent, conditions have to be optimal on the satellite\
    \ revisit day to avoid data corruption\ndue to, for example, cloud cover [23,53].\
    \ Cloud corrupted data (~55% of the land area is covered by\ncloud at any one\
    \ time [59]) will require users to wait for the next revisit to attempt the data\
    \ acquisition.\nTime-series image fusion techniques, such as the spatial and temporal\
    \ adaptive reﬂectance fusion\nmodel, can improve the spatial and temporal resolution\
    \ of the satellite data [60,61]. These fusion\ntechniques blend the frequent (however\
    \ low-resolution) with higher-resolution (but infrequent) satellite\ndata [62,63].\
    \ The result combines the best aspects of multiple satellite systems to produce\
    \ frequent and\nhigher-resolution data, which can be useful for timely monitoring\
    \ of water status.\nThe clear advantage of the satellite system is the ability\
    \ to capture data at a large scale and at an\naﬀordable cost (e.g., the user can\
    \ download Landsat and Sentinel data for free). The compromise with\nthe satellite\
    \ data is in spatial resolution, as well as the relatively long revisit cycle\
    \ (in the order of days\nto weeks), making the data less than ideal for speciﬁc\
    \ applications, e.g., irrigation scheduling.\n2.2. Manned Aircraft System\nOperating\
    \ within few kilometres above ground level, manned aircraft have been used to\
    \ remotely\nacquire agricultural data at higher spatial detail (compared to the\
    \ satellites) and over a larger region\n(compared to UAS) [42,64]. Light ﬁxed-wing\
    \ aircraft and helicopters are the commonly used manned\naircraft employed in\
    \ agricultural remote sensing. The ﬁxed-wing aircraft generally ﬂies higher and\n\
    faster, enabling the coverage of a larger area, whereas the helicopters are traditionally\
    \ ﬂown lower\nand slower, enabling a spatially detailed observation. A signiﬁcant\
    \ advantage of the manned aircraft,\ncompared to UAS, lies in their ability to\
    \ carry heavier high-grade sensors, such as AVIRIS, HyPlant,\nHySpex SWIR-384,\
    \ Specim AisaFENIX, and Riegl LMS Q240i-60 [65–67]. The use of manned aircraft\
    \ is,\nhowever, limited by high operational complexity, safety regulations, scheduling\
    \ inﬂexibility, costs, and\nproduct turnaround time. As a result, these platforms\
    \ are barely used as compared to the recent surge\nin the use of UAS, speciﬁcally\
    \ for horticultural crops [68–70].\nIn horticulture, manned aircraft was used\
    \ to characterise olive and peach canopy temperature\nand water stress using speciﬁc\
    \ thermal bands (10.069 µm and 12.347 µm) of a wideband (0.43–12.5 µm)\nairborne\
    \ hyperspectral camera system [71,72]. This work found moderate correlations (R2\
    \ = 0.45–0.57)\nof ground vs. aerial olive canopy temperature measurements [72],\
    \ and high correlations (R2 = 0.94)\nof canopy temperature vs. peach fruit size\
    \ (diameter) [71]. The advantage of manned aircraft for\nremote sensing of a large\
    \ region was highlighted in recent work that characterised regional-scale\ngrapevine\
    \ (Vitis vinifera L.) water stress responses of two cultivars, Shiraz and Cabernet\
    \ Sauvignon, in\nAustralia [64]. Airborne thermal imaging was able to discriminate\
    \ between the two cultivars based on\ntheir water status responses to soil moisture\
    \ availability (Figure 1).\nAgronomy 2020, 10, 140\n5 of 35\nAgronomy 2020, 10,\
    \ 140 \n5 of 35 \n \n \nFigure 1. Water status of Shiraz and Cabernet Sauvignon\
    \ under similar soil moisture as captured from \nmanned aircraft [64]. \n2.3.\
    \ Unmanned Aircraft Systems \nBoth the fixed-wing and the rotary-wing variant\
    \ of UASs are used in agricultural remote \nsensing. Each variant has its advantages\
    \ and shortcomings vis-à-vis sensor payload, flexibility, and \ncoverage. In this\
    \ regard, the literature provides a list of state-of-the-art UAS [73], their categorisation\
    \ \n[74], and overview of structural characteristics, as well as flight parameters\
    \ [75], in the context of \nagricultural use. Depending on the number of rotors,\
    \ a rotary-wing UAS can be a helicopter, a \nquadcopter, a hexacopter, or an octocopter,\
    \ among others. Rotary-wing UAS are more agile and can \nfly with a higher degree\
    \ of freedom [76], while fixed-wing UAS needs to be moving forward at a \ncertain\
    \ speed to maintain thrust. As a result, rotary-wing UAS provides flexibility\
    \ and specific \ncapabilities, such as hovering, vertical take-off and landing,\
    \ vertical (up and down) motions, or return \nto the previous location. On the\
    \ contrary, fixed-wing UAS fly faster, carry heavier payloads, and have \ngreater\
    \ flying time enabling coverage of larger areas in a single flight [77]. Recently\
    \ developed fixed-\nwing UAS with vertical take-off and landing capabilities,\
    \ such as BirdEyeView FireFly6 PRO, Elipse \nVTOL-PPK, and Carbonix Volanti, captures\
    \ the pros of both fixed-wing and rotary-wing, making \nthem a promising platform\
    \ for agricultural purposes. In the context of precision agriculture, the \napplication\
    \ of UAS, their future prospects, and knowledge gaps are discussed in [53,78–81].\
    \ While \nmany horticultural crops have been studied using UAS technology, the\
    \ most studied horticultural \ncrops are vineyards [31,82–84], citrus [85,86],\
    \ peach [32,33], olive [18,87,88], pistachio [89,90], and \nalmond [91–94], among\
    \ others [95–99]. Some of the UAS types used for water status studies of \nhorticultural\
    \ crops are shown in Figure 2. \n \n \n(a) \n(b) \nFigure 1. Water status of Shiraz\
    \ and Cabernet Sauvignon under similar soil moisture as captured from\nmanned\
    \ aircraft [64].\n2.3. Unmanned Aircraft Systems\nBoth the ﬁxed-wing and the rotary-wing\
    \ variant of UASs are used in agricultural remote sensing.\nEach variant has its\
    \ advantages and shortcomings vis-à-vis sensor payload, ﬂexibility, and coverage.\n\
    In this regard, the literature provides a list of state-of-the-art UAS [73], their\
    \ categorisation [74], and\noverview of structural characteristics, as well as\
    \ ﬂight parameters [75], in the context of agricultural use.\nDepending on the\

    Both the fixed-wing and the rotary-wing variant of UASs are used in agricultural\
    \ remote \nsensing. Each variant has its advantages and shortcomings vis-à-vis\
    \ sensor payload, flexibility, and \ncoverage. In this regard, the literature\

    \ overview of structural characteristics, as well as flight parameters [75], in\
    \ the context of \nagricultural use. Depending on the number of rotors, a rotary-wing\
    \ UAS can be a helicopter, a \nquadcopter, a hexacopter, or an octocopter, among\
    \ others. Rotary-wing UAS are more agile and can \nfly with a higher degree of\
    \ freedom [76], while fixed-wing UAS needs to be moving forward at a \ncertain\

    \ and specific \ncapabilities, such as hovering, vertical take-off and landing,\
    \ vertical (up and down) motions, or return \nto the previous location. On the\
    \ contrary, fixed-wing UAS fly faster, carry heavier payloads, and have \ngreater\

    \ combination of sensors and spectral \nbands can be incorporated to target specific\
    \ features. \nUAS-acquired image data requires post-processing before it can be\
    \ incorporated into the grower \ndecision-making process. Mosaicking of UAS images\

    \ to the size of the dataset, computational power, and \nspectral/spatial quality\
    \ of the product [104,105]. Spectral quality of the data is of optimal importance,\
    \ \nwhereas the spatial quality can be of less importance, such as for well-established\
    \ horticultural crops. \nHigher spectral quality demands calibration of the spectral\
    \ sensors and correction of atmospheric \neffects. Following post-processing of\
    \ aerial images, the UAS-based spectral data have shown to be \nhighly correlated\
    \ with ground-based data [82,102,106]. \nThe most common UAS-based sensor types\

    \ often [23,79,107]. Spectral sensors provide the capability to capture broader\
    \ physiological \nproperties of the crop, such as greenness (related to leaf chlorophyll\

    \ \nreflectance index (PRI) and solar-induced chlorophyll fluorescence (SIF),\
    \ which reflects a plant’s \nphotosynthetic efficiency [109,110]. Thermal-based\

    3. Remote Sensor Types\n3.1. Digital Camera\nA digital camera typically incorporates\
    \ an RGB, modiﬁed RGB, and a monochrome digital camera.\nThe lens quality of the\
    \ camera determines the sharpness of the image, while the resolution of the\n\
    Agronomy 2020, 10, 140\n7 of 35\ncamera determines its spatial resolution and\
    \ details within an image. The RGB camera uses broad\nspectral bandwidth within\
    \ the blue, green and red spectral region to capture energy received at the\n\
    visible region of the electromagnetic spectrum. The images are used to retrieve\
    \ dimensional properties\nof the crop, terrain conﬁguration, macrostructure of\
    \ the ﬁeld, and the spatial information. Based on\nthe dimensional properties,\
    \ such as size, height, perimeter, and area of the crown, the resource need\n\
    practices can be estimated [119–121]. Generally, a larger crop is expected to\
    \ more quickly use available\nwater resources, resulting in crop water stress\
    \ at a later stage of the season if irrigation is not suﬃcient.\nThe evolution\
    \ of canopy structure within and between seasons can be useful to understand the\
    \ spatial\nvariability within the ﬁeld and corresponding water requirements. The\
    \ macro-structure of horticultural\ncrops, such as row height, width, spacing,\
    \ crop count, the fraction of ground cover, and missing\nplants, can be identiﬁed\
    \ remotely, which can aid in the allocation of resources [113,122]. The terrain\n\
    conﬁguration in the form of a digital elevation model (DEM) generated from a digital\
    \ camera can also\nenable understanding of the water status in relation to the\
    \ aspect and slope conﬁguration of the terrain.\n3.2. Multispectral Camera\nA\
    \ multispectral camera oﬀers multiple spectral bands across the electromagnetic\
    \ spectrum.\nMost common airborne multispectral cameras have 4–5 bands which include\
    \ rededge and NIR\nbands in addition to the visible bands, R-G-B (e.g., Figure\
    \ 3a,c). Conﬁgurable ﬁlter placement of\nthe spectral band is also available,\
    \ which can potentially target certain physiological responses of\nhorticultural\
    \ crops [102]. Spectrally, the airborne multispectral camera has been reported\
    \ to perform\nwith consistency, producing reliable measurements following radiometric\
    \ calibration and atmospheric\ncorrection [123–125].\nTheir spatial resolution\
    \ has been found to be suﬃcient for horticultural\napplications enabling canopy\
    \ level observation of the spectral response. For this reason, as well as\nrelatively\
    \ low cost, multispectral cameras are used more frequently in horticulture applications.\n\
    Agronomy 2020, 10, 140 \n7 of 35 \n \nof the camera determines its spatial resolution\
    \ and details within an image. The RGB camera uses \nbroad spectral bandwidth\
    \ within the blue, green and red spectral region to capture energy received \n\
    at the visible region of the electromagnetic spectrum. The images are used to\
    \ retrieve dimensional \nproperties of the crop, terrain configuration, macrostructure\
    \ of the field, and the spatial information. \nBased on the dimensional properties,\
    \ such as size, height, perimeter, and area of the crown, the \nresource need\
    \ practices can be estimated [119–121]. Generally, a larger crop is expected to\

    \ the spatial variability within the field and corresponding water requirements.\
    \ \nThe macro-structure of horticultural crops, such as row height, width, spacing,\
    \ crop count, the \nfraction of ground cover, and missing plants, can be identified\
    \ remotely, which can aid in the \nallocation of resources [113,122]. The terrain\

    \ a digital camera can also enable understanding of the water status in relation\
    \ \nto the aspect and slope configuration of the terrain. \n3.2. Multispectral\
    \ Camera \nA multispectral camera offers multiple spectral bands across the electromagnetic\
    \ spectrum. Most \ncommon airborne multispectral cameras have 4–5 bands which\
    \ include rededge and NIR bands in \naddition to the visible bands, R-G-B (e.g.,\
    \ Figure 3a,c). Configurable filter placement of the spectral \nband is also available,\
    \ which can potentially target certain physiological responses of horticultural\

    \ by vegetation spectral index called NDVI (Table 2, Equation (3)). Once the vegetation\n\
    starts to experience stress (biotic and abiotic), its reﬂectance in the NIR region\
    \ is reduced, while the\nreﬂectance in the red band is increased. Thus, such stress\
    \ is reﬂected in the vegetation proﬁle and\nAgronomy 2020, 10, 140\n8 of 35\n\
    easily captured by indices, such as NDVI. For this reason, NDVI has shown correlations\
    \ with a wide\narray of crops response including vigour, chlorophyll content,\
    \ leaf area index (LAI), crop water stress,\nand occasionally yield [34,82–84,127].\n\
    The rededge band covers the portion of the electromagnetic spectrum between the\
    \ red and NIR\nbands where reﬂectance increases drastically. Studies have suggested\
    \ that the sharp transition between\nthe red absorbance and NIR reﬂection is able\
    \ to provide additional information about vegetation and\nits hydric characteristics\
    \ [128]. Using the normalised diﬀerence red edge (NDRE) index, the rededge\nband\
    \ was found to be useful in establishing a relative chlorophyll concentration\
    \ map [127]. Given the\nsensitivity of NDRE, it can be used for applications,\
    \ such as crops drought stress [107]. With regard to\nthe water use eﬃciency,\
    \ a combination of vegetation indices (VIs) along with structural physiological\n\
    indices were found to be useful to study water stress in horticultural crops [34,82,129].\n\
    3.3. Hyperspectral\nHyperspectral sensors have contiguous spectral bands sampled\
    \ at a narrower wavelength intervals\nspanning from visible to NIR spectrum at\
    \ a high to ultra-high spectral resolution (Figure 3d). Scanning\nat contiguous\
    \ narrow-band wavelengths, a hyperspectral sensor produces a three dimensional\
    \ (two\nspatial dimensions and one spectral dimension) data called hyperspectral\
    \ data cube. The hyperspectral\ndata cube is a hyperspectral image where each\
    \ pixel contain spatial information, as well as the entire\nspectral reﬂectance\
    \ curve [130]. Based on the operating principle and output data cube, hyperspectral\n\
    sensors for remote sensing can include a point spectrometer (aka spectroradiometer),\
    \ whiskbroom\nscanner, pushbroom scanner, and 2D imager (Figure 4) [130,131].\
    \ A point spectrometer, samples\nwithin its ﬁeld of view solid angle to produce\
    \ an ultra-high spectral resolution spectral data of a\npoint [130,132]. A whiskbroom\
    \ scanner deploys a single detector onboard to scan one single pixel at a\ntime.\
    \ As the scanner rotates across-track, successive scans form a row of the data\
    \ cube, and as the\nplatform moves forward along-track, successive rows form a\
    \ hyperspectral image [133]. A pushbroom\nscanner deploys a row of spatially contiguous\
    \ detectors arranged in the perpendicular direction of\ntravel and scans the entire\
    \ row of pixels at a time. As the platform moves forward, the successive\nrows\
    \ form a two-dimensional hyperspectral image [40,134]. The 2D imager using diﬀerent\
    \ scanning\ntechniques [130] captures hyperspectral data across the image scene\
    \ [135,136]. The point spectrometer\noﬀers the highest spectral resolution and\
    \ lowest signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) among the UAS-compatible\nhyperspectral sensors\
    \ [137,138].\nAgronomy 2020, 10, 140 \n8 of 35 \n \nstarts to experience stress\
    \ (biotic and abiotic), its reflectance in the NIR region is reduced, while the\
    \ \nreflectance in the red band is increased. Thus, such stress is reflected in\
    \ the vegetation profile and \neasily captured by indices, such as NDVI. For this\
    \ reason, NDVI has shown correlations with a wide \narray of crops response including\
    \ vigour, chlorophyll content, leaf area index (LAI), crop water stress, \nand\
    \ occasionally yield [34,82–84,127]. \nThe rededge band covers the portion of\
    \ the electromagnetic spectrum between the red and NIR \nbands where reflectance\
    \ increases drastically. Studies have suggested that the sharp transition \nbetween\
    \ the red absorbance and NIR reflection is able to provide additional information\
    \ about \nvegetation and its hydric characteristics [128]. Using the normalised\
    \ difference red edge (NDRE) \nindex, the rededge band was found to be useful\
    \ in establishing a relative chlorophyll concentration \nmap [127]. Given the\
    \ sensitivity of NDRE, it can be used for applications, such as crops drought\
    \ stress \n[107]. With regard to the water use efficiency, a combination of vegetation\
    \ indices (VIs) along with \nstructural physiological indices were found to be\
    \ useful to study water stress in horticultural crops \n[34,82,129]. \n3.3. Hyperspectral\
    \ \nHyperspectral sensors have contiguous spectral bands sampled at a narrower\
    \ wavelength \nintervals spanning from visible to NIR spectrum at a high to ultra-high\
    \ spectral resolution (Figure \n3d). Scanning at contiguous narrow-band wavelengths,\
    \ a hyperspectral sensor produces a three \ndimensional (two spatial dimensions\
    \ and one spectral dimension) data called hyperspectral data \ncube. The hyperspectral\
    \ data cube is a hyperspectral image where each pixel contain spatial \ninformation,\
    \ as well as the entire spectral reflectance curve [130]. Based on the operating\
    \ principle \nand output data cube, hyperspectral sensors for remote sensing can\
    \ include a point spectrometer (aka \nspectroradiometer), whiskbroom scanner,\
    \ pushbroom scanner, and 2D imager (Figure 4) [130,131]. A \npoint spectrometer,\
    \ samples within its field of view solid angle to produce an ultra-high spectral\
    \ \nresolution spectral data of a point [130,132]. A whiskbroom scanner deploys\
    \ a single detector onboard \nto scan one single pixel at a time. As the scanner\
    \ rotates across-track, successive scans form a row of \nthe data cube, and as\
    \ the platform moves forward along-track, successive rows form a hyperspectral\
    \ \nimage [133]. A pushbroom scanner deploys a row of spatially contiguous detectors\
    \ arranged in the \nperpendicular direction of travel and scans the entire row\
    \ of pixels at a time. As the platform moves \nforward, the successive rows form\
    \ a two-dimensional hyperspectral image [40,134]. The 2D imager \nusing different\
    \ scanning techniques [130] captures hyperspectral data across the image scene\
    \ \n[135,136]. The point spectrometer offers the highest spectral resolution and\
    \ lowest signal-to-noise \nratio (SNR) among the UAS-compatible hyperspectral\
    \ sensors [137,138]. \n \nFigure 4. The data cube structure of different spectral\

    \ high resolution contiguous spectral\nsampling, possesses tremendous potential\
    \ to detect and monitor speciﬁc biotic and abiotic stresses [139].\nNarrowband\
    \ hyperspectral data was used to detect water stress using the measurement of\
    \ ﬂuorescence\nAgronomy 2020, 10, 140\n9 of 35\nand PRI over a citrus orchard\
    \ [110]. PRI was identiﬁed as one of the best predictors of water stress for a\n\
    vineyard in a study that investigated numerous VIs using hyperspectral imaging\
    \ [140]. High-resolution\nthermal imagery obtained from a hyperspectral scanner\
    \ was used to map canopy stomatal conductance\n(gs) and CWSI of olive orchards\
    \ where diﬀerent irrigation treatments were applied [18]. With the\nlarge volume\
    \ of spatial/spectral data extracted from the hyperspectral data cube, machine\
    \ learning\nwill likely be adopted more widely in the horticultural environment\
    \ to model water stress [141].\nSee Reference [54] for a comprehensive review\
    \ of hyperspectral and thermal remote sensing to detect\nplant water status.\n\

    \ which does not use an internal cooling mechanism and,\ntherefore, does not achieve\
    \ the high SNR that can be found in cooled microbolometer-based thermal\ncameras.\
    \ An array of microbolometer detectors in the thermal camera receives a thermal\
    \ radiation\nsignal and stores the signal on the corresponding image pixel as\
    \ raw data number (DN) values.\nThe result is a thermal image where each pixel\
    \ has an associated DN value, which can be converted to\nabsolute temperature.\
    \ A representative list of commercial thermal cameras used on UAS platforms\n\
    and their applications with regard to agricultural remote sensing is found in\
    \ the literature [23,53,73].\nThermal imagery enables the measurement of the foliar\
    \ temperature of plants. The foliar temperature\ndiﬀerence between well-watered\
    \ and water-stressed crops is the primary source of information for\nwater stress\
    \ prediction using a thermal sensor [142]. When mounted on a remote sensing platform,\
    \ the\ncanopy level assessment of crop water status can be performed on a large\
    \ scale.\nThermal cameras are limited by their resolution (e.g., 640 × 512 is\
    \ the maximum resolution of\nUAS compatible thermal cameras in the current market)\
    \ and high price-tag [53]. The small number of\npixels results in low spatial\
    \ resolution limiting either the ability to resolve a single canopy or ability\
    \ to\nﬂy higher and cover a larger area. If ﬂown at a higher altitude, the eﬀective\
    \ spatial resolution may\nbe inadequate for canopy level assessment of some horticultural\
    \ crops. For example, a FLIR Tau2\n640 thermal camera with a 13 mm focal length\
    \ when ﬂown at an altitude of approximately 120 m\nresults in a spatial resolution\
    \ of 15.7 cm. For relatively large horticultural crops, such as grapevine,\nalmond,\
    \ citrus, and avocado, the resolution at a maximum legal ﬂying altitude of 120\
    \ m in Australia\n(for small-sized UAS) oﬀers an adequate spatial resolution to\
    \ observe a single canopy.\nAnother challenge with the use of thermal cameras\
    \ is the temporal drift of the DN values\nwithin successive thermal images, especially\
    \ with uncooled thermal cameras [143]. Due to the lack\nof an internal cooling\
    \ mechanism for the microbolometer detectors, DN values registered by the\nmicrobolometers\
    \ experience temporal drift i.e., the registered DN values for the same temperature\n\
    target will drift temporally. Thus, the thermal image can be unreliable especially\
    \ when the internal\ntemperature of the camera is changing rapidly, such as during\
    \ camera warmup period or during the\nﬂight when a gust of cool wind results in\
    \ cooling of the camera. To overcome this challenge, the user\nmay need to provide\
    \ suﬃcient startup time before operation (preferably 30–60 min) [102,143–145],\n\
    shield the camera to minimize the change in the internal temperature of the camera\
    \ [142], calibrate the\ncamera [146–153], and perform frequent ﬂat-ﬁeld corrections.\n\
    3.5. Multi-Sensor\nTo carry multiple sensors, the total UAS payload needs to be\
    \ considered that includes, in\naddition to the sensors, an inertial measurement\
    \ unit (IMU) and global navigation satellite system\n(GNSS) for the georeferencing\
    \ purpose [40,154]. Higher accuracy sensors tend to be heavier, and in\na multi-sensor\
    \ scenario, the payload can quickly reach or even exceed the payload limit. This\
    \ has\nlimited contemporary measurements in earlier multirotor UAS requiring separate\
    \ ﬂights for each of\nsensor [126]. The use of ﬁxed-wing UAS has allowed carrying\
    \ higher payloads due to the much larger\nAgronomy 2020, 10, 140\n10 of 35\nthrust-to-weight\
    \ ratio as compared to a rotary-wing aircraft [155]. Similarly, recent advancement\
    \ in\nUAS technology and lightweight sensors have enabled multirotor (payload\
    \ 5–6 kg readily available) to\nonboard multi-sensors.\nWater status of crops\
    \ is a complex process inﬂuenced by a number of factors including the\nphysiology\
    \ of the crop, available soil moisture, the size and vigour of the crop, and meteorological\n\
    factors [30,108,116,156,157]. For this reason, a multi-sensor platform is used\
    \ to acquire measurements\nof the diﬀerent aspects of the crop for water status\
    \ assessment [34,102,108]. The most common\ncombination of sensors found in the\
    \ literature is the RGB, multispectral (including rededge and NIR\nbands) and\
    \ thermal. Together, these sensors can be used to investigate the water status\
    \ of the crop\nusing various indicators, such as PRI, CWSI, ﬂuorescence, and structural\
    \ properties, with the aim of\nimproving the water use eﬃciency [102,110,158–160].\n\
    4. Techniques of Remote Sensing in Horticulture\n4.1. Georeferencing of Remotely\
    \ Sensed Images\nGeoreferencing provides a spatial reference to the remotely sensed\
    \ images such that the pixels\nrepresenting crops or regions of interest on the\
    \ images are correctly associated with their position on\nEarth. The georeferencing\
    \ process generally uses surveyed coordinate points on the ground, known\nas ground\
    \ control points (GCPs), to determine and apply scaling and transformation to\
    \ the aerial\nimages [161]. Alternatively, instead of GCPs, the user can georeference\
    \ aerial images by using the\naccurate position of the camera, or by co-registration\
    \ with the existing georeferenced map [105,162].\nIn the case of UAS-based images,\
    \ the capture timing is scheduled to ensure a recommended\nforward overlap (>80%)\
    \ between successive images.\nThe ﬂight path is designed to ensure the\nrecommended\
    \ side overlap (>70%) between images from successive ﬂight strips. Thus, the captured\n\
    series of images are processed using the Structure-from-Motion (SfM) technique\
    \ to generate a 3D\npointcloud and orthomosaic [73,130] (see Figure 5). Commonly\
    \ used SfM software to process the\nremote sensing images are Agisoft PhotoScan\
    \ and Pix4D. The commonly retrieved outputs from the\nSfM software for assessment\
    \ of horticulture crops include the orthomosaic, digital surface model\n(DSM),\
    \ DEM, and 3D pointcloud [113,126,163]. This technique of georeferencing can be\
    \ applied to any\nsensor that produces images, e.g., RGB, thermal, or multispectral\
    \ cameras [126,164,165].\nAgronomy 2020, 10, 140 \n10 of 35 \n \nsensor [126].\
    \ The use of fixed-wing UAS has allowed carrying higher payloads due to the much\
    \ larger \nthrust-to-weight ratio as compared to a rotary-wing aircraft [155].\
    \ Similarly, recent advancement in \nUAS technology and lightweight sensors have\
    \ enabled multirotor (payload 5–6 kg readily available) \nto onboard multi-sensors.\
    \ \nWater status of crops is a complex process influenced by a number of factors\
    \ including the \nphysiology of the crop, available soil moisture, the size and\
    \ vigour of the crop, and meteorological \nfactors [30,108,116,156,157]. For this\
    \ reason, a multi-sensor platform is used to acquire measurements \nof the different\
    \ aspects of the crop for water status assessment [34,102,108]. The most common\
    \ \ncombination of sensors found in the literature is the RGB, multispectral (including\

    \ PRI, CWSI, fluorescence, and structural properties, with the aim of \nimproving\
    \ the water use efficiency [102,110,158–160]. \n4. Techniques of Remote Sensing\
    \ in Horticulture \n4.1. Georeferencing of Remotely Sensed Images \nGeoreferencing\
    \ provides a spatial reference to the remotely sensed images such that the pixels\

    Agronomy 2020, 10, 140\n11 of 35\nThe complexity of georeferencing of hyperspectral\
    \ observations depends on the sensor type, i.e.,\nimaging or non-imaging. A non-imaging\
    \ spectroradiometer relies on the use of a GNSS antenna and\nan IMU for georeferencing\
    \ the point observation [130,132,138,168]. An imaging hyperspectral camera,\n\
    generally, in addition to GNSS and IMU measurement, uses the inter-pixel relation\
    \ in SfM to produce a\ngeoreferenced orthomosaic [40,134,135,169,170].\n4.2. Calibration\
    \ and Correction of Remotely Sensed Images\nEnsuring consistency, repeatability,\
    \ and quality of the spectral observation requires stringent\nradiometric, spectral,\
    \ and atmospheric corrections [123,171–177]. Spectral and radiometric calibration\n\
    is performed in the spectral calibration facility in darkroom settings. The sensor’s\
    \ optical properties\nand shift in spectral band position are corrected during\
    \ the spectral calibration process. Radiometric\ncalibration enables conversion\
    \ of the recorded digital values into physical units, such as radiance.\nInﬁeld\
    \ operation of the spectral sensor is inﬂuenced by variations in atmospheric transmittance\n\
    from thin clouds, invisible to the human observer. Changes in atmospheric transmittance\
    \ aﬀect the\nradiance incident on the plant. As a result, the change in acquired\
    \ spectral response by the sensor\nmay not represent the change in plants response\
    \ but the change in incident radiation on the plant.\nThe most common method to\
    \ convert the spectral data to reﬂectance is by generating an empirical line\n\
    relationship between sensor values and spectral targets, such as a Spectralon®\
    \ or calibration targets.\nThe use of downwelling sensors, such as a cosine corrector\
    \ [137], or the use of a ground-based PAR\nsensor enables absolute radiometric\
    \ calibration to generate radiance [130].\nThe calibration of the broad wavelength\
    \ multispectral sensor is generally less stringent than\nthe hyperspectral. Generally,\
    \ multispectral sensors are used to compute normalised indices such\nas NDVI.\
    \ The normalised indices are relatively less inﬂuenced, although signiﬁcant, by\
    \ the change\nin illumination conditions which aﬀect the entire spectrum proportionally\
    \ [29,101]. In this regard,\nradiometric calibration of the multispectral camera\
    \ has used a range of stringent to simpliﬁed, and\nvicarious approaches [123,125,171,173,178–180].\
    \ Some multispectral cameras are equipped with a\ndownwelling light sensor, which\
    \ is aimed at correcting for variations in atmospheric transmittance.\nHowever,\
    \ the performance of such downwelling sensors (without a cosine corrector) on\
    \ multispectral\ncameras have been reported to have directional variation resulting\
    \ in unstable correction, indicating\nthe inability of the sensor to incorporate\
    \ the entire hemisphere of diﬀused light [124,137].\nThe radiometric calibration\
    \ of the thermal images is typically based on the camera’s DN to object\ntemperature\
    \ curve, which provides the relationship between the DN of a pixel and a known\
    \ object\ntemperature, usually of a black body radiator. Measurement accuracy\
    \ and SNR of the camera under\nvarying ambient temperatures can be improved by\
    \ using calibration shutters, which are recently\navailable commercially. Furthermore,\
    \ for low measurement errors (under 1 ◦C), thermal data requires\nconsideration\
    \ to the atmospheric transmittance [18,102]. Flying over a few temperature reference\n\
    targets placed on the ground reduces the temporal drift of the camera [142,143,181].\
    \ Temperature\naccuracy within a few degrees was achieved by ﬂying over the targets\
    \ three times (at the start, middle\nand end of UAS operation) and using three\
    \ separate calibration equations for each overpass [142].\nAdditionally, using\
    \ the redundant information from multiple overlapping images, drift correction\n\
    models have been proposed, which lowered temperature error by 1 ◦C as compared\
    \ to uncorrected\northomosaic [152]. The manufacturer stated accuracies (generally\
    \ ±5 ◦C) can be suﬃcient to access the\nﬁeld variability and to detect “hotspots”\
    \ of water status. However, the aforementioned calibration and\ncorrection of\
    \ the thermal cameras are required for quantitative measurement as a goal [143].\
    \ In this\nregard, current challenges and best practices for the operation of\
    \ thermal cameras onboard a UAS is\nprovided in the literature [143].\n4.3. Canopy\
    \ Data Extraction\nA key challenge in remote sensing of horticultural as compared\
    \ to agricultural crops arises due\nto the proportion of inter-row ground/vegetation\
    \ cover and resulting mixed pixels. The proportion\nAgronomy 2020, 10, 140\n12\
    \ of 35\nof the mixed pixels increases with the decrease in spatial resolution\
    \ of the image. Most of the pixels\ntowards the edge of the canopy contain a blend\
    \ of information originating from the sun-lit canopy,\nshadowed leaves, and inter-row\
    \ bare soil/cover crop. A further challenge can arise for some crops,\nsuch as\
    \ grapevine, due to overlapping of adjacent plants.\nThe canopy data from orthomosaic\
    \ has been extracted using either a pixel-based or an object-based\napproach.\
    \ Earlier studies manually sampled from the centre of crop row which most likely\
    \ eliminated\nthe mixed pixels [182]. In the pixel-based approach, techniques,\
    \ such as applying global threshold\nand masking, have been used. Binary masks,\
    \ such as NDVI, eliminates non-canopy pixels from\nthe sampling [82,84]. Combining\
    \ the NDVI mask with the canopy height mask can exclude the\npixels associated\
    \ with non-vegetation, as well as vegetation that does not meet the height threshold.\n\
    The pixel-based approach, however, can result in inaccurate identiﬁcation of some\
    \ crops due to pixel\nheterogeneity, mixed pixels, spectral similarity, and crop\
    \ pattern variability.\nIn the object-based approach, using object detection techniques,\
    \ neighbouring pixels with\nhomogenous information, such as spectral, textural,\
    \ structural, and hierarchical features, are grouped\ninto “objects”. These objects\
    \ are used as the basis of object-based image analysis (OBIA) classiﬁcation\n\
    using classiﬁers, such as k-nearest neighbour, decision tree, support vector machine,\
    \ random forest,\nand maximum likelihood [122,183–185]. In the horticultural environment,\
    \ OBIA has been adopted\nto classify and sample from pure canopy pixels [119,122,186].\
    \ Consideration should be provided on\nthe number of features and their suitability\
    \ for a speciﬁc application to reduce the computational\nburden, as well as to\
    \ maintain the accuracies. The generalisation of these algorithms for transferability\n\
    between study sites usually penalises the achievable accuracy. For details in\
    \ object-based approach of\nsegmentation and classiﬁcation, readers are directed\
    \ to literatures [122,183,185,187–189].\nOther techniques found in the literature\
    \ include algorithms, such as ‘Watershed’, which has been\ndemonstrated in palm\
    \ orchards [82,190]. Vine rows and plants have been isolated and classiﬁed using\n\
    image processing techniques, such as clustering and skeletisation [188,191–193].\
    \ Similarly, the gridded\npolygon, available in common GIS software, such as ArcGIS\
    \ and QGIS, can be used in combination\nwith zonal statistics for this purpose.\
    \ When working with the low-resolution images, co-registration\nwith the high-resolution\
    \ images has been proposed, whereby, the high-resolution images enable better\n\
    delineation of the mixed pixels [194]. For this reason, spectral and thermal sensors,\
    \ which are usually\nlow in resolution, are generally employed along with high-resolution\
    \ digital cameras.\n4.4. Indicators of Crop Water Status\nA crop’s biophysical\
    \ and biochemical attributes can be approximated using diﬀerent indices and\n\
    quantitative products. For example, CWSI is used to proxy leaf water potential\
    \ (Ψleaf), stem water\npotential (Ψstem), gs, and net photosynthesis (Pn) [83,100,195].\
    \ With regard to horticultural crops, water\nstatus has been assessed using a\
    \ number of spectral and thermal indices (Table 2).\nTable 2. Commonly used vegetation\

    A plant maintains its temperature by transpiring through the stomata to balance\
    \ the energy\nﬂuxes in and out of the canopy. As the plant experience stress (both\
    \ biotic and abiotic), the rate of\ntranspiration decreases, which results in\
    \ higher canopy temperature (Tc), which can be a proxy to\nunderstand the water\
    \ stress in the plant [207]. In this regard, crop water stress showed a correlation\n\
    with canopy temperature extracted from the thermal image [208], which enables\
    \ mapping the spatial\nvariability in water status [209]. Leaf/canopy temperature\
    \ alone, however, does not provide a complete\ncharacterisation of crop water\
    \ status, for instance, an equally stressed canopy can be 25 ◦C or 35 ◦C,\ndepending\
    \ on the current ambient temperature (Ta). Thus, canopy-to-air temperature diﬀerence\n\
    (Tc − Ta) was proposed, which showed a good correlation with the Ψstem, Ψleaf,\
    \ and gs in horticultural\ncrops [85,99,182].\n4.4.2. Normalised Thermal Indices\n\
    The CWSI, the conductance index (Ig) and the stomatal conductance index (I3) are\
    \ thermal\nindices most commonly used to estimate crop water status and gs [210–212].\
    \ These indices provide\nsimilar information, however, use a diﬀerent range of\
    \ numbers to represent the level of water stress.\nThe CWSI is normalised within\
    \ zero and one, whereas Ig and I3 represent stress using numbers\nbetween zero\
    \ and inﬁnity. CWSI has been adopted most widely in horticultural applications\
    \ to\nassess the water status of crops, such as the grapevines [100,213], almond\
    \ [91,198], citrus [85,110], and\nothers [18,87,99,214]. By normalising between\
    \ the lower and upper limits of (Tc − Ta), the CWSI of the\ncanopy presents quantiﬁable\
    \ relative water stress. The formula for CWSI computation is deﬁned as in\nEquation\
    \ (1) [208,212].\nCWSI =\n(Tc − Ta) − (Tc − Ta)LL\n(Tc − Ta)UL − (Tc − Ta)LL\n\
    (1)\nwhere (Tc − Ta)UL and (Tc − Ta)LL represent the upper and lower bound of\
    \ (Tc − Ta) which are found in\nthe water-stressed canopy and well-watered canopy\
    \ transpiring at the full potential (or maximum) rate,\nrespectively. Assuming\
    \ a constant ambient temperature, Equation (1) can be simpliﬁed to Equation (2),\n\
    which is the most widely reported formulation of CWSI with regard to the horticultural\
    \ remote sensing.\nCWSI = (Tc − Twet)\n\x10\nTdry − Twet\n\x11\n(2)\nwhere Twet\
    \ is the temperature of canopy transpiring at the maximum potential, and Tdry\
    \ is the\ntemperature of the non-transpiring canopy. CWSI has been shown to be\
    \ well-correlated with direct\nmeasurements of crop water status in the horticultural\
    \ environment [18,31,32,90,99]. In this regard,\na correlation of CWSI with various\
    \ ground measurements, such as Ψleaf [18,31,197], Ψstem [33,90,194],\nand gs [18,90,100],\
    \ have been established. Diurnal measurements of CWSI compared with Ψleaf showed\n\
    the best correlation at noon [89,197,209].\nCWSI is a normalised index, i.e.,\
    \ relative to a reference temperature range between Twet and Tdry,\nwhich is speciﬁc\
    \ to a region and crop type; thus, CWSI is not a universal quantitative indicator\
    \ of crop\nwater status. For instance, a CWSI of 0.5 for two diﬀerent varieties\
    \ of grapevines at diﬀerent locations\ndoes not conclusively inform that they\
    \ have equal or superior/inferior water status. Furthermore,\nthe degree of correlation\
    \ can change depending on the isohydric/anisohydric response of crop [214]\nwhere\
    \ early/late stomatal closure aﬀects the indicators of water stress [110]. Moreover,\
    \ phenological\nstage aﬀects the relationship between remotely sensed CWSI and\
    \ water stress [197]. Thus, water stress\nin a diﬀerent crop, at a diﬀerent location\
    \ and at a diﬀerent phenological stage, will have a unique\ncorrelation with CWSI\
    \ and, therefore, needs to be established independently.\nThere are multiple methods\
    \ to measure the two reference temperatures, Twet and Tdry, which\ncould result\
    \ in variable CWSI values depending on the method used. The ﬁrst method is to\
    \ measure the\ntwo reference temperatures on the crop of interest. Tdry can be\
    \ estimated by inducing stomatal closure,\nAgronomy 2020, 10, 140\n14 of 35\n\
    which is the leaf temperature approximately 30 min after applying a layer of petroleum\
    \ jelly e.g.,\nVaseline to both sides of a leaf. This eﬀectively blocks stomata\
    \ and, therefore, impedes leaf transpiration.\nTwet can be estimated by measuring\
    \ leaf temperature approximately 30 s after spraying water on the\nleaf, which\
    \ emulates maximum transpiration [23,83]. The advantage of this method is that\
    \ the stress\nlevels are normalised to actual plants response, whereas the necessity\
    \ to repeat the measurement for\nevery test site after each ﬂight can be cumbersome.\
    \ In an alternative (second) approach the range can\nbe established based on meteorological\
    \ data e.g., setting Tdry to 5 ◦C above air temperature and Twet\nmeasured from\
    \ an artiﬁcial surface. This method is also limited to local scale and presents\
    \ a problem\nregarding the choice of material, which ideally needs to have similar\
    \ to leaf emissivity, aerodynamic\nand optical properties [54,87]. The third method\
    \ uses the actual temperature measurement range\nof the remote sensing image [33,97].\
    \ This method is simple to implement, however, works on the\nassumption that the\
    \ ﬁeld contains enough variability to contain a representative Twet and Tdry.\
    \ Fourth,\nthe reference temperatures can be estimated by theoretically solving\
    \ for the leaf surface energy balance\nequations, however, are limited by the\
    \ necessity to compute the canopy aerodynamic resistance [87].\nStandard and robust\
    \ Twet and Tdry measurements are needed to characterize CWSI with accuracy,\n\
    especially for temporal analysis [85,87,211]. The level of uncertainty due to\
    \ the adaptation of diﬀerent\napproaches for Twet and Tdry determination in the\
    \ instantaneous and seasonal measurements of CWSI\nis not known. Nonetheless,\
    \ adopting a consistent approach, CWSI has been shown to be suitable for\nmonitoring\
    \ the water status and making irrigation decisions of horticultural crops [31,85].\n\
    4.4.3. Spectral Indices\nCrops reﬂectance properties convey information about\
    \ the crop, for instance, a healthier crop has\nhigher reﬂectance in the NIR band.\
    \ Most often, the bands are mathematically combined to form VIs,\nwhich provide\
    \ information on the crop’s health, growth stage, biophysical properties, leaf\
    \ biochemistry,\nand water stress [29,215–218]. Using multispectral or hyperspectral\
    \ data, several Vis, such as green\nnormalised diﬀerence vegetation index (GNDVI),\
    \ renormalised diﬀerence vegetation index (RDVI),\noptimized soil-adjusted vegetation\
    \ index (OSAVI), transformed chlorophyll absorption in reﬂectance\nindex (TCARI),\
    \ and TCARI/OSAVI, amongst others [34,79,82], can be calculated that correlate\
    \ with the\nwater stress of horticultural crops (see Table 2). The most widely\
    \ studied VI in horticulture, in this\nregard, is the NDVI (Equation (3)).\nNDVI\
    \ = Rnir − Rr\nRnir + Rr\n(3)\nwhere Rnir and Rr represent the spectral reﬂectance\
    \ acquired at the NIR and red spectral regions,\nrespectively. In horticulture,\
    \ NDVI has been used as a proxy to estimate the vigour, biomass, and water\nstatus\
    \ of the crop. A vigorous canopy with more leaves regulates more water, therefore\
    \ remaining\ncooler when irrigated [200] and experiencing early water stress when\
    \ unirrigated. With regard to\nirrigation, the broadband normalised spectral indices\
    \ (such as NDVI) are suitable to detect spatial\nvariability and to identify the\
    \ area that is most vulnerable to water stress. However, these indices are\nnot\
    \ expected to change rapidly to reﬂect the instantaneous water status of plants\
    \ that are needed to\nmake decisions on irrigation scheduling.\nThe multispectral\
    \ indices along with complementary information in thermal wavelengths have\nproven\
    \ to be well suited to monitoring vegetation, speciﬁcally in relation to water\
    \ stress [219]. The ratio\nof canopy surface temperature to NDVI, deﬁned as temperature-vegetation\
    \ dryness index (TVDI),\nwas found to be useful for the study of water status\
    \ in horticultural crops. TVDI exploits the fact that\nvegetation with larger\
    \ NDVI will have a lower surface temperature unless the vegetation is under\n\
    stress. As most vegetation normally remains green after an initial bout of water\
    \ stress, the TVDI is\nmore suited than NDVI for early detection of water stress\
    \ as the surface temperature can rise rapidly\neven during initial water stress\
    \ [200].\nSimilarly, narrowband VIs that have been studied in relation to remote\
    \ sensing of water status are\nPRI and chlorophyll ﬂuorescence, which have been\
    \ directly correlated to the crop Ψleaf, gs [110,182,204].\nAgronomy 2020, 10,\
    \ 140\n15 of 35\nSeveral hyperspectral indices to estimate water status have been\
    \ identiﬁed [139]; however, their\napplication in remote sensing of horticultural\
    \ crops is at its infancy. Hyperspectral indices speciﬁc to\nwater absorption\
    \ bands around 900 nm, 1200 nm, 1400 nm, and 1900 nm may be used to detect the\n\
    water status of horticultural crops. The absorption features were found to be\
    \ highly correlated with\nplant water status [139]. Water band index (WBI), as\
    \ deﬁned in Equation (4), has been shown to closely\ntrack the changes in the\
    \ plant water status of various crops [202,203].\nWBI = R970\nR900\n(4)\nOther\
    \ water-related hyperspectral indices with potential application for horticultural\
    \ crops can\nbe found in the literature [139,202,203]. Hyperspectral data possess\
    \ the capability to reﬂect the\ninstantaneous water status of the plant, which\
    \ can be useful for quantitative decision-making on\nirrigation scheduling.\n\
    4.4.4. Soil Moisture\nThe moisture status of the soil provides an indication of\
    \ the available water resource to the crop.\nSoil moisture is traditionally measured\
    \ indirectly using soil moisture sensors placed below the surface\nof the soil.\
    \ A key challenge with using soil moisture sensors are the spatial distribution\
    \ of moisture,\nboth vertically and horizontally, to account for inherent ﬁeld-scale\
    \ variability. For instance, the root\nsystem of some horticultural crops, such\
    \ as grapevine, is capable of accessing water up to 30 m deep,\nwhile customer-grade\
    \ soil moisture probes generally extend to 1.5 m in depth or less. Thus, soil\n\
    moisture probes do not capture all the water available to the crop as they are\
    \ point measures and\nnot necessarily where the roots are located. Moreover, estimation\
    \ of soil moisture across spatial and\ntemporal scales is of interest for various\
    \ agricultural and hydrological studies. Optical, thermal, and\nmicrowave remote\
    \ sensing with their advantages relating to high spatial scale and temporal resolutions\n\
    could potentially be used for soil moisture estimation [220–222]. L-band microwave\
    \ radiometry,\na component of synthetic aperture radar systems, has been shown\
    \ to be a reliable approach to estimate\nsoil moisture via satellite-based remote\
    \ sensing [223], such as using the ESA’s Soil Moisture and\nOcean Salinity (SMOS)\
    \ [224] and NASA’s Soil Moisture Active Passive (SMAP) satellites [225,226].\n\
    The limitation of the SMOS and SMAP missions, with regard to horticultural application,\
    \ is their\ndepth of retrieval (up to 5 cm) and spatial resolution (in the order\
    \ of tens of kilometre) [227–229].\nAs an airborne application, the volumetric\
    \ soil moisture has been estimated by analysing the SNR of\nthe GNSS interference\
    \ signal [230,231]. With aforementioned capabilities, a combination of satellite\n\
    and airborne remote sensing may, in the future, be a reliable tool to map soil\
    \ moisture across spatial,\ntemporal and depth scales.\n4.4.5. Physiological Attributes\n\
    Using the SfM on remotely-sensed images, 3D canopy structure, terrain conﬁgurations,\
    \ and canopy\nsurface models can be derived [113,114,119,186,232]. By employing\
    \ a delineation algorithm on the 3D\nmodels, the 3D attributes of the crops and\
    \ macrostructure are determined more accurately [120,122,233].\nCrop surface area\
    \ and terrain conﬁguration (e.g., slope and aspect) may help to develop an optimal\n\
    resource management strategy. For example, crops located at a higher elevation\
    \ within an irrigation\nzone may experience a level of water stress due to the\
    \ gravitational ﬂow of irrigated water.\nUsing the structural measurements, such\
    \ as the canopy height, canopy size, the envelope of each\nrow, LAI, and porosity,\
    \ among others, the water demand of the crop may be estimated. Generally,\nlarger\
    \ canopies tend to require more water than smaller canopies with less leaf area\
    \ [116,157]. Using\nthe temporal measurement of the plant’s 3D attributes, the\
    \ vigour can be computed. Monitoring\ncrop vigour over the season and over subsequent\
    \ years can provide an indication of its health and\nperformance, e.g., yield,\
    \ within an irrigation zone. Canopy structure metrics are closely related to\n\
    horticultural tree growth and provide strong indicators of water consumption,\
    \ whereby canopy size\nAgronomy 2020, 10, 140\n16 of 35\ncan be used to determine\
    \ its water requirements [234]. Other 3D attributes, such as the crown perimeter,\n\
    width, height, area, and leaf density, have been shown to enable improved pruning\
    \ of horticultural\nplants [116,119].\nLAI can be estimated using the 3D attributes\
    \ obtained from remote sensing [114,157,201], whereby,\nhigher LAI is equivalent\
    \ to more leaf layers, implying greater total leaf area and, consequently, canopy\n\
    transpiration. Leaf density, LAI, and exposed leaf area of a crop drive its water\
    \ requirement and\nproductivity [235–237]. Knowledge of ﬁeld attributes, such\
    \ as row and plant spacing, may assist in\ninter-row surface energy balance to\
    \ determine the irrigation need of the plant [238]. Combining the\nstructural\
    \ properties with spectral VIs provide an estimation of biomass [239], which can\
    \ serve as\nanother indicator of the plant’s water requirements. Although physiological\
    \ attributes have been used\nto understand plant water status and its spatial\
    \ variability, they have not been directly applied to make\nquantitative decisions\
    \ on irrigation.\n4.4.6. Evapotranspiration\nThe estimation of ET via remote sensing,\
    \ numerical modelling, and empirical methods have been\nextensively studied and\
    \ reviewed in the literature [240–247]. These models are based on either surface\n\
    energy balance (SEB), Penman-Monteith (PM), Maximum entropy production (MEP),\
    \ water balance,\nwater-carbon linkage, or empirical relationships.\nSEB models\
    \ are based on a surface energy budget in which the latent heat ﬂux is estimated\
    \ as a\nresidual of the net radiation, soil heat ﬂux, and sensible heat ﬂux. The\
    \ models are either one-source\n(canopy and soil treated as a single surface for\
    \ the estimation of sensible heat ﬂux) or two-source\n(canopy and soil surfaces\
    \ treated separately). Improvements over the original one-source SEB models\n\
    were in the form of Surface Energy Balance Algorithm for Land (SEBAL) algorithm\
    \ [248,249] and\nMapping EvapoTranspiration with high Resolution and Internalized\
    \ Calibration (METRIC) [249,250].\nSEBAL oﬀers a simpliﬁed approach to collect\
    \ ET data at both local and regional scales thereby increasing\nthe spatial scope,\
    \ while METRIC uses the same (SEBAL) technique but auto-calibrates the model using\n\
    hourly ground-based reference ET (ETr) data [251]. As such, these and other (e.g.,\
    \ MEP) models rely\non accurate measurements of surface (e.g., canopy) and air\
    \ temperatures, which can be erroneous\nunder non-ideal conditions, e.g., cloudy\
    \ days. There is also a reliance on ground-based sensors to\ncapture ambient air\
    \ temperatures required by the model.\nAmong the existing methods, FAO’s PM is\
    \ the most widely adopted model to estimate reference\nET (ETref or ET0) [252].\
    \ The PM method uses incident and reﬂected solar radiation, emitted thermal\n\
    radiation, air temperature, wind speed, and vapour pressure to calculate ET0 [253].\
    \ Remote sensing\nprovides a cost-eﬀective method to estimate the ET0 at regional\
    \ to global scales [241] by estimating\nreﬂected solar and emitted thermal radiation.\
    \ One of the advantages of using the PM approach is\nthat it is parametrised using\
    \ micrometeorological data easily obtained from ground-based automatic\nweather\
    \ stations. However, PM suﬀers from the drawback that canopy transpiration is\
    \ not dynamic\nas inﬂuenced by soil moisture availability via stomatal regulation\
    \ [241]. From a practical standpoint,\nPM-derived ET0 estimates are used in conjunction\
    \ with crop factors or crop coeﬃcients (kc), which are\nclosely related to the\
    \ light interception of the canopy [254].\nCrop evapotranspiration (ETc) is deﬁned\
    \ as the product of kc and ET0. In the absence of accurate\nETc measurements,\
    \ kc is an easy and practical means of getting reliable estimates of ETc using\
    \ ET0 [255].\nIn this regard, studies have focused on the use of remote sensing\
    \ to study spatial variability in kc and\nETc [101,256–258]. Thermal and NIR imagery\
    \ can be used to compute kc and ETc as transpiration\nrate is closely related\
    \ to canopy temperature [259–261] and kc has been shown to correlate with\ncanopy\
    \ reﬂectance [101,255]. Various thermal indices, such as CWSI, canopy temperature\
    \ ratio, canopy\ntemperature above non-stressed, and canopy temperature above\
    \ canopy threshold, can be used to\nestimate ETc, where CWSI- based ETc was found\
    \ to be the most accurate [24].\nET at a larger scale is typically estimated based\
    \ on satellite remote sensing. The temporal resolution\nof satellites is, however,\
    \ low and inadequate for horticultural applications, such as irrigation scheduling\n\
    Agronomy 2020, 10, 140\n17 of 35\n(e.g., Landsat has a 16-day revisit cycle).\
    \ In contrast, high temporal resolution satellites are coarse in\nspatial resolution\
    \ for ﬁeld-scale observations [25]. The daily or even instantaneous estimation\
    \ of ETc at\nthe ﬁeld scale is crucial for irrigation scheduling and is expected\
    \ to have great application prospects\nin the future [240,259,262,263]. In this\
    \ regard, the future direction of satellite-based ET estimates\nmay focus on temporal\
    \ downscaling either by extrapolation of instantaneous measurement [264],\ninterpolation\
    \ between two successive observations [201], data fusion of multiple satellites\
    \ [25,260], and\nspatial downscaling using multiple satellites [265–268]. An example\
    \ of early satellite-based remote\nsensing for ET is the MODIS Global Evapotranspiration\
    \ Project (MOD16), which was established in\n1999 to provide daily estimates of\
    \ global terrestrial evapotranspiration using data acquired from a\npair of NASA\
    \ satellites in conjunction with Algorithm Theoretical Based Documents (ATBDs)\
    \ [269].\nThese estimates correlated well with ground-based eddy covariance ﬂux\
    \ tower estimates of ET despite\ndiﬀerences in the uncertainties associated with\
    \ each of these techniques.\nUASs are being increasingly utilised to acquire multi-spectral\
    \ and thermal imagery to compute\nET at an unprecedented spatial resolution [270,271].\
    \ Using high-resolution images, ﬁltering the\nshadowed-pixel is possible, which\
    \ showed signiﬁcant improvement in the estimation of ET in\ngrapevine [101]. Using\
    \ high-resolution thermal and/or multispectral imagery, ET has been derived for\n\
    horticultural crops, such as grapevines [270] and olives [271]. The seasonal monitoring\
    \ of ETc at high\nspatial and temporal resolutions is of high importance for precision\
    \ irrigation of horticultural crops in\nthe future [259].\n5. Case Studies on\
    \ the Use of Remote Sensing for Crop Water Stress Detection\nThe increasing prevalence\
    \ of UAS along with low-cost camera systems has brought about much\ninterest in\
    \ the characterisation of crop water status/stress during the growing season to\
    \ inform orchard\nor farm management decisions, in particular, irrigation scheduling\
    \ [272,273]. Traditional methodologies\nto assess crop water stress are constrained\
    \ by limitations relating to large farm sizes and accompanying\nspatial variability,\
    \ high labour costs to collect data, and access to instrumentation that is both\
    \ inexpensive\nand portable [272]. The beneﬁts of precision agriculture [274],\
    \ including through precision irrigation\npractices [1], result in higher production\
    \ eﬃciencies and economic returns through site-speciﬁc crop\nmanagement [275,276].\
    \ This approach has motivated the use of high-resolution imagery acquired\nfrom\
    \ remote sensing to identify irrigation zones [99,277]. The ﬁrst horticultural\
    \ applications of UAS\nplatforms for crop water status measurement were in orange\
    \ and peach orchards where both thermal\nand multispectral-derived VIs, speciﬁcally\
    \ the PRI, were shown to be well-correlated to crop water\nstatus [102]. Here,\
    \ we explore the use of remote sensing and accompanying image acquisition platforms\n\
    to characterise the spatial and temporal patterns of the water status of two economically\
    \ important\nhorticultural crops, grapevine and almond.\n5.1. Grapevine (Vitis\
    \ spp.)\nThe characterisation of spatial variability in vine water status in a\
    \ vineyard provides valuable\nguidance on irrigation scheduling decisions [82],\
    \ and this spatial variability can be eﬃciently\ncharacterised by the use of remote\
    \ sensing platforms [29]. The ﬁrst use of remote sensing in vineyards\nfor crop\
    \ water stress detection was using manned aircraft ﬂown over an irrigated vineyard\
    \ in Hanwood\n(NSW) Australia where CWSI was mapped at a spatial resolution of\
    \ 10 cm [278]. Subsequently, UAS\nplatforms began to be used in vineyards for\
    \ vine water stress characterisation. Early work in this\ncrop used a fuel-based\
    \ helicopter with a 29 cc engine and equipped with thermal (Thermovision\nA40M)\
    \ and multispectral (Tetracam MCA-6) camera systems [102]. The study observed\
    \ strong (inverse)\nrelationships between (Tc − Ta) and gs. A related study showed\
    \ strong correlations between thermal\nand multispectral VIs, and traditional,\
    \ ground-based measures of water status, such as Ψleaf and\ngs [182]. In this\
    \ study, normalised PRI was shown to have correlation coeﬃcients exceeding 0.8\
    \ versus\nboth Ψleaf and gs, indicating that remotely-sensed VIs can be reliable\
    \ indicators of vine water status.\nThermal indices, such as (Tc − Ta) and CWSI,\
    \ were also well-correlated to Ψleaf and gs at speciﬁc times of\nAgronomy 2020,\
    \ 10, 140\n18 of 35\nthe day. The use of thermal indices, such as CWSI or Ig,\
    \ requires reference temperatures (Twet, Tdry) or\nnon-water stressed baselines\
    \ (NWSB) [279]. Due to the diﬃculty of obtaining reference temperatures or\nNWSB\
    \ using remote sensing, some authors have used the minimum temperature found from\
    \ all canopy\npixels as Twet [199], and Ta + 5 ◦C as Tdry [213,280]. NWSB is typically\
    \ obtained from well-watered\ncanopies, measuring (Tc − Ta) under a range of vapour\
    \ pressure deﬁcit conditions [279]. Thermal water\nstress indices have also shown\
    \ to be useful to distinguish between water use strategies of diﬀerent\ngrapevine\
    \ cultivars [83,281], which is useful for customising irrigation scheduling based\
    \ on the speciﬁc\nwater needs of a given cultivar. More recently, studies have\
    \ used UAS-based multispectral-based\nVIs to train an artiﬁcial neural network\
    \ (ANN) models to predict spatial patterns of Ψstem [84,282].\nUsing UAS-based\
    \ multispectral data, the authors showed that ANN estimated Ψstem with higher\n\
    accuracy (RMSE lower than 0.15 MPa) as compared to the conventional multispectral\
    \ indices based\nestimation (RMSE over 0.32 MPa).\n5.2. Almond (Prunus Dulcis)\n\
    Almonds are perennial nut trees grown in semi-arid climates and are reliant on\
    \ irrigation\napplications. Their water requirements are relatively high, with\
    \ seasonal ETc exceeding 1000 mm [283].\nThe requirement for prudent irrigation\
    \ management in the face of decreased water availability is\ncritical for maintaining\
    \ tree productivity, yield, and nut quality [284]. Towards this goal, UAS-based\n\
    remote sensing has been used to characterise the spatial patterns of tree water\
    \ status in almond\norchards. A UAS-based thermal camera was used to acquire tree\
    \ the crown temperature data from\na California almond orchard; this temperature\
    \ was used to determine the temperature diﬀerence\nbetween crown and air (Tc −\
    \ Ta) and compared to shaded leaf water potential (Ψsl) [92]. The study\nfound\
    \ a strong negative correlation (R2 = 0.72) between (Tc − Ta) and Ψsl. The same\
    \ authors conducted\na follow on study in Spain on several fruit tree species\
    \ including almond. The negative relationship\n(slope and oﬀset) between (Tc −\
    \ Ta) and Ψstem was observed to vary based on the time of observation;\nmorning\
    \ measurements had weak relationships, whereas afternoon measurements had stronger\n\
    relationships [99]. Their proposed methodology allowed for the spatial characterisation\
    \ of orchard\nwater status on a single-tree basis, demonstrating the utility of\
    \ UAS-based crop water stress data.\nBeyond the characterisation of crop water\
    \ stress for irrigation scheduling, there is an opportunity to\nuse this data\
    \ to quantify the economic impact at a spatial level.\n6. Future Prospective and\
    \ Gaps in the Knowledge\nPrecision irrigation is a promising approach to increase\
    \ farm water use eﬃciency for sustainable\nproduction, including for horticultural\
    \ crops [3,5,9,10,274,285]. It is envisioned that the future of\nprecision irrigation\
    \ will incorporate UAS, manned aircraft, and satellite-based remote sensing platforms\n\
    alongside ground-based proximal sensors coupled with wireless sensor networks.\
    \ The automation\nof UAS technology will continue to develop further to a point\
    \ that even novice users can adopt\nthe technology with ease. It is also expected\
    \ that the data processing pipeline of remote sensing\nimages will become automated\
    \ to be ‘ﬁt for purpose’ for crop water status measurements. The ideal\nsolution\
    \ may lie in the use of satellites (or sometimes manned aircraft) for regional\
    \ estimation and\nplanning [55,260], UAS for seasonal monitoring and zoning [32,100,197,286],\
    \ proximal sensors for\ncontinuous measurement [287], and artiﬁcial intelligence\
    \ to derive decision-ready products [84,282]\nthat can be used for making irrigation\
    \ scheduling decisions [31,288–295]. Continued technological\ndevelopments in\
    \ this space will enable growers to acquire actionable data with ease, and eventually\n\
    transition towards semi-automated or fully-automated irrigation applications.\n\
    Remote sensing and current irrigation application technologies are limited in\
    \ temporal and\nspatial resolution, respectively. Although UAS technology can\
    \ deliver sub-plant level spatially explicit\ninformation of water status, the\
    \ size of the management block is much coarser, typically over 10 m.\nHence, further\
    \ improvements in variable rate application technologies, e.g., boom sprayers,\
    \ or zoned\ndrip irrigation, are required to fully exploit high-resolution UAS\
    \ measurements. Nonetheless, the\nAgronomy 2020, 10, 140\n19 of 35\nrequired resolution\
    \ of remote sensing should be guided by the underlying spatial variability of\
    \ the crop.\nFor ﬁelds with relatively lower spatial variability, low/medium-resolution\
    \ remote sensing imagery\nmay suﬃce for crop water status assessment [278,296,297].\n\
    Remote sensing provides an indirect estimate of plant water status using the regression-based\n\
    approach through several calculated reﬂectance indices. In comparison, physical\
    \ and mechanistic\nmodels, e.g., radiative transfer models and energy balance\
    \ models, incorporate both direct and indirect\nmeasures of the canopy, therefore\
    \ establishing a basis for diﬀerences in plant water status. Using a\nsimilar\
    \ approach, predictions of crop water status using regression-based remote sensing\
    \ models can\nbe improved by incorporating some direct auxiliary variables.\n\
    Further developments in thermal remote sensing are also expected, speciﬁcally,\
    \ the advent of new\nthermal and hybrid thermal-multispectral water status/stress\
    \ indices that are more sensitive to canopy\ntranspiration. The most widely-adopted\
    \ thermal index, CWSI, is an instantaneous measure that is\nnormalised to local\
    \ weather conditions and inﬂuenced by genotype and phenotype. For example,\nthe\
    \ relationship between CWSI and crop water status is inﬂuenced by environmental\
    \ conditions\n(e.g., high incident radiation and low humidity vs low incident\
    \ radiation and high humidity) and\nphenological stage [197,214,298]. As a result,\
    \ corresponding ground-based measurements are required\nfor each temporal remote\
    \ measurement to determine the correlation with water status. Hence, temporal\n\
    assessments of water status using thermal cameras will require the incorporation\
    \ of meteorological\ndata along with the thermal response using novel indices.\n\
    In the area of satellite remote sensing, we foresee further developments on temporal\
    \ downscaling\nto achieve daily measurements. A higher temporal resolution may\
    \ be achieved by fusion of multiple\nsatellite observations, such as freely available\
    \ Landsat and Sentinel. Further reductions of temporal\nresolution will require\
    \ interpolation between two successive observations. Furthermore, temporal\nmodels\
    \ of water status could be developed to assist the interpolation to eventually\
    \ satisfy the\nrequirements for irrigation scheduling [25,201,263]. The continued\
    \ advancement and greater availability\nof Nanosat/Cubesat may provide an alternate\
    \ method to capture high-resolution data at a higher\na greater temporal resolution,\
    \ which can be suitable to study the water status of horticultural\ncrops [299–301].\n\
    Crop water status is a complex phenomenon, which can be interpreted with respect\
    \ to a\nnumber of variables. These variables can include spectral response, thermal\
    \ response, meteorological\ndata, 3D attributes of the canopy, and macrostructure\
    \ of the block (farm).\nClearly, there is\nan opportunity for a multi-disciplinary\
    \ approach, potentially incorporating artiﬁcial intelligence\ntechniques which\
    \ incorporate the aforementioned variables to provide a robust estimation of crop\n\
    water status [84,141,282,302,303]. Furthermore, with machine learning algorithms,\
    \ hyperspectral\nremote sensing will provide a wealth of data to estimate crop\
    \ water status. A quantitative product,\nsuch as SIF, derived from hyperspectral\
    \ data will have the potential for direct quantiﬁcation of water\nstress [204,205,304].\
    \ In this regard, the upcoming FLEX satellite mission [305,306] and recent advances\n\
    in aerial spectroradiometry [109,132,137,307–310] dedicated for observation of\
    \ SIF may be unique and\npowerful tools for high-value horticultural crops.\n\
    Multi-temporal images represent an excellent resource for seasonal monitoring\
    \ of changes in crop\nwater status. Five to six temporal points of data acquisition\
    \ at critical phenological stages of crop\ndevelopment have been recommended for\
    \ irrigation scheduling [31,32]. However, for semi-arid or arid\nregions, irrigation\
    \ is typically required multiple times per week. Acquisition and post-processing\
    \ of\nremote sensing data for actionable products multiple times a week is currently\
    \ logistically unfeasible.\nThe fusion of UAS-based remote sensing data, continuous\
    \ ground-based proximal or direct sensors,\nincluding weather station data, can\
    \ potentially inform daily estimates of water status at canopy level.\nThis approach\
    \ will require predictive models, such as those based on machine learning algorithms,\
    \ to\nestimate the current and future water status of the crop. Eventually, growers\
    \ would beneﬁt from the\nknowledge of crop water requirements for the determination\
    \ of seasonal irrigation requirements to\nsustainably farm into the future.\n\
    Agronomy 2020, 10, 140\n20 of 35\nOne vision for the future of precision irrigation\
    \ is in automated pipelines to explicitly manage\nirrigation water at the sub-block\
    \ level. This automated pipeline would likely include remote and\nproximal data\
    \ acquisition and processing, prediction and interpretation of crop water status\
    \ and\nrequirements, and subsequently, control of irrigation systems. Recent rapid\
    \ developments in cloud\ncomputing and wireless technology could assist in the\
    \ quasi-real-time processing of the remote sensing\ndata soon after acquisition\
    \ [311–313]. Eventually, automation and computational power will merge to\ndevelop\
    \ smart technology in which artiﬁcial intelligence uses real-time data analysis\
    \ for diagnosis\nand decision-making. Growers of the future will be able to take\
    \ advantage of precise irrigation\nrecommendations using information sourced from\
    \ a ﬂeet of UAS that map large farm blocks on a daily\nschedule, continuous ground-based\
    \ proximal and direct sensors, and weather stations. This data can be\nstored\
    \ on and accessed from the cloud almost instantaneously, used in conjunction with\
    \ post-processing\nalgorithms for decision-making on optimised irrigation applications\
    \ [311,314].\n7. Conclusions\nThis paper provides a comprehensive review of the\
    \ use of remote sensing to determine the water\nstatus of horticultural crops.\
    \ One of our objectives was to survey the range of remote sensing tools\navailable\
    \ for irrigation decision-making. Earth observation satellite systems possess\
    \ the required bands\nto study the water status of vegetation and soil. Satellites\
    \ are more suitable for scouting, planning,\nand management of irrigation applications\
    \ that involve large areas, and where data acquisition is\nnot time-constrained.\
    \ Manned aircraft are sparingly used in horticultural applications due to the\n\
    cost, logistics, and speciﬁc expertise needed for the operation of the platform.\
    \ UAS-based remote\nsensing provides ﬂexibility in spatial resolution (crop level\
    \ observation achievable), coverage (over\n25 ha achievable in a single ﬂight),\
    \ spectral bands, as well as temporal revisit. Routine monitoring of\nhorticultural\
    \ crops for water status characterisation is, therefore, best performed using\
    \ a UAS platform.\nWe envision a future for precision irrigation where satellites\
    \ are used for planning, and UAS used in\nconjunction with a network of ground-based\
    \ sensors to achieve actionable products on a timely basis.\nThe plant’s instantaneous\
    \ response to water stress can be captured using thermal cameras (via\nindices,\
    \ such as CWSI) and potentially narrow-band hyperspectral sensors (via, for example,\
    \ SIF),\nmaking them suitable to draw quantiﬁable decisions with regard to irrigation\
    \ scheduling. Broadband\nmultispectral and RGB cameras capture the non-instantaneous\
    \ water status of crops, making them\nsuitable for general assessment of crop\
    \ water status. Integrated use of thermal and multispectral\nimagery may be the\
    \ simplest yet eﬀective sensor combinations to capture the overall as well as\n\
    instantaneous water status of the plant. With regard to irrigation scheduling,\
    \ further developments\nare required to establish crop-speciﬁc thresholds of remotely-sensed\
    \ indices to decide when and how\nmuch to irrigate.\nAuthor Contributions: Performed\

    rights and content Abstract With the development of sensing, wireless communication,
    and Internet technologies, we are now living in a world that is filled with various
    smart things – the Internet of Things (IOT). This paper introduces and prospects
    an emerging research area – the Embedded Intelligence (EI). This field aims at
    revealing the individual behaviours, spatial contexts, as well as social patterns
    and urban dynamics by mining the digital traces left by people while interacting
    with Internet of smart things (cameras, smart cars, smart cards, etc). In the
    agricultural sector we add mining of existing technology (books, articles, blue
    prints) to generate high depth ontologies or metadata and knowledge extraction
    from Big Data for reasoning and making pro-active decisions using open data information.
    We include intelligent data analysis to discover new knowledge from data records.
    The paper discusses the research history, characteristics, general architecture,
    major applications, and research issues of EI and exemplifies an application of
    the team in IOT smart irrigation. The purpose of presenting it as a Technology
    Roadmap (TRM) was to clarify the challenges and opportunities in the general area
    of “Intelligent Building Technologies” (IBT) and more specifically to smart greenhouses,
    smart irrigation, or smart crop management. The understanding of smart agriculture
    is important to be identified by the scientific community as a significant issue
    because it is needed for nations to develop and adopt these emerging technologies.
    Global interoperability is of key importance, and so it is a common understanding
    of values such as privacy and security, based on open, fair and transparent international
    standards. Previous article in issue Next article in issue Keywords internet of

    • Volumetric soil moisture content in the second layer (7–28 cm) was predicted.
    • LSTM neural network was built for the three-day predictions in Serbia. • ERA5
    climate reanalysis data and Yr weather forecasts were used as open-source data.
    • Regional system for irrigation scheduling service in drought conditions was
    created. In the context of climate change, drought has been recognised as one
    of the most severe threats for agricultural production since absence of water
    is one of the most limiting factors for the growth of plants. In this study, a
    regional system for soil moisture prediction based on ERA5 climate reanalysis
    dataset, an open-source meteorological dataset issued by Copernicus Climate Change
    Service, was developed. It consisted of the relevant meteorological parameters
    for Serbia, during the period 2011–2020. Daily values of maximum and minimum air
    temperature, precipitation and vapour pressure deficit were used as features,
    and they were fed to recurrent neural network in order to predict volumetric soil
    moisture for three days ahead. A Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network was designed
    and trained at a regional scale using the data from the 2011–2016 period, at 28
    locations that cover four major soil types. Validation was done on 2017–2018 data
    and LSTM was compared with a statistical forecasting technique and a classical
    machine learning approach. Evaluation was done with error measures commonly used
    in literature. The resulting network yielded the lowest errors and proved to have
    good generalisation properties. The system was tested from September 2019 to April
    2020 using short-range weather forecasts of Yr service. It will present the cornerstone
    of the irrigation scheduling service in AgroSense.rs, the Serbian national platform
    for digital agriculture. Previous article in issue Next article in issue Keywords

    of extreme weather events have increased across many land systems in the world.
    This is particularly the case with heatwaves and droughts, especially in the drought-prone
    regions of the Mediterranean (Shukla et al., 2019). Weather patterns in Serbia
    are changing, thus affecting the air temperature and precipitation regimes on
    the annual basis (Mimić, Mihailović, & Kapor, 2017). In the 21st century, warmer
    and drier conditions can be expected for all reference soil groups in Serbia,
    with an increase in mean annual soil temperature (up to 3.8 °C) and a decrease
    in mean annual soil moisture (up to 11.3%) (Mihailović et al., 2016). Additionally,
    a shift in climate zones is expected, which will influence the conditions during
    the growing season and the total agricultural production in Serbia (Mihailović
    et al., 2015). The only way to overcome this challenging issue is through the
    use of irrigation, as a mitigation measure, or through revenue-protection insurance
    schemes. Soil moisture is one of the essential climate variables according to
    World Meteorological Organization (WMO). It is very important in agriculture since
    it indicates the level of water available for crops, especially in dry conditions
    during the growing season (Mannocchi, Todisco, & Vergni, 2004). Insufficient amount
    of water in soil causes stress in crops and adversely affects plant growth and
    development (Ahmad, Malagoli, Wirtz, & Hell, 2016). Water uptake and evaporation
    occur predominately in topsoil, where the cumulative root length per unit of soil
    volume is the highest, and hence the path to water extraction and the hydraulic
    resistance are the lowest (Lobet, Couvreur, Meunier, Javaux, & Draye, 2014). Topsoil
    is the upper soil layer, usually reaching the depth of 13–25 cm, composed of organic
    matter, water, air and mineral particles (Marsh, 2010). Low water uptake by the
    plants happens when soil moisture content is close to permanent wilting point,
    and it depends on the soil texture as well (Fernández & Clothier, 2009). Thus,
    it is necessary to have reliable information on soil moisture content for timely
    and optimal irrigation scheduling. Soil moisture sensors can provide this information,
    but unfortunately due to the high price of equipment, this technology is not available
    to a wider population of farmers. Various applications of deep learning in agriculture
    and food production, including soil moisture prediction, have already been thoroughly
    examined (Kamilaris & Prenafeta-Boldú, 2018). Different neural network models,
    able to predict soil moisture dynamics with various input requirements, were presented
    and discussed in literature (Zheng et al., 2019). Comparison of machine learning
    techniques such as Multiple Linear Regression, Support Vector Machines and Recurrent
    Neural Networks (RNNs) for prediction of soil moisture was performed on datasets
    collected from different online repositories (Prakash, Sharma, & Sahu, 2018).
    Adaptive Neuro Fuzzy Inference Systems, a technique that combines advantages from
    fuzzy logic and artificial neural networks, was used for making a decision-support
    system (DSS) for irrigation management in agriculture, based on weather variables
    and soil parameters from the sensors (Navarro-Hellín, Martínez-del Rincon, Domingo-Miguel,
    Soto-Valles, & Torres-Sánchez, 2016). Deep Belief Networks and Multi-Layer Perceptron
    were combined with macroscopic cellular automata in order to predict spatiotemporal
    probability of soil moisture content at the depth of 4 cm using irrigation data
    with many dynamic weather and soil variables (Song et al., 2016), where former
    showed better results, compared to the observations. Cai, Zheng, Zhang, Zhangzhong,
    and Xue (2019) discussed that selecting appropriate meteorological parameters
    as the input features of the model can significantly improve the accuracy of soil
    moisture prediction. In training a Deep Neural Network Regression model, the initial
    soil moisture was used as an input feature as well, and the obtained results were
    comparable to other models applied in Beijing, China (Cai et al., 2019). Feed-forward
    Neural Network and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) were tested for one-day-ahead
    predictions of soil moisture content, which was used for predictive irrigation
    scheduling (Adeyemi, Grove, Peets, Domun, & Norton, 2018). Daily values of air
    temperature, relative humidity, net radiation, wind speed, precipitation and volumetric
    soil moisture content were used to build the model which requires past and present
    meteorological inputs and past and present soil moisture content values. The downside
    of this methodology is the lag in predictions, as the changes in soil moisture
    are in line with the observations but shifted for one day. The authors commented
    as well that the predictive system should be extended to include rainfall forecasts.
    LSTM has been used for optimal irrigation prescription on an hourly basis, with
    training data collected from a precision irrigation study, and this system showed
    very good prediction capabilities (Jimenez, Ortiz, Bondesan, Morata, & Damianidis,
    2019). However, the factor that hinders the scalability of this approach is the
    necessity of detailed hourly data from the sensors. The objective of this study
    was to develop a deep learning system for prediction of soil moisture for three
    days ahead using open-source data, the most essential input variables and the
    weather forecast from Yr service including rainfall. This methodology does not
    require the data from soil sensors. LSTM network was trained to be robust for
    different soil types, thus applicable on a regional scale and not only for a particular
    field. Since it is using globally available open-source data from ERA5, the system
    is scalable for other regions as well. Such system would help farmers make informed
    decisions about the time of irrigation, thus increasing their yields, reducing
    the risk of the production and saving the resources, specifically for the drought
    conditions. 2. Material and methods 2.1. Datasets In order to achieve operability
    of the system throughout the region of interest, as well as to facilitate its
    potential scale-up, we relied on free, globally available data sources. In this
    way, a model trained on a number of points could be applied over a larger area
    with similar climate and soil characteristics. Although local calibration data
    may be required for scale-up over a region with different characteristics, the
    same methodology and system architecture that were developed for the initial region
    can be used in a novel environment. The two open data sources used in this study
    are Copernicus Climate Change Service (C3S), for historical weather data, and
    Yr, for weather forecasts. C3S provides information about the climate from ERA5,
    the fifth generation reanalysis of the global climate produced by European Centre
    for Medium-range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF). Reanalysis combines observations from
    across the world with modelled data to produce a complete and globally consistent
    dataset using the laws of physics and complex simulations. Data assimilation is
    done with horizontal resolution of 0.25° × 0.25° (approximately 25 km at mid-latitudes)
    and hourly data are produced (C3S, 2017). There are four soil layers in ERA5,
    segregated by the depth: the first (0–7 cm), second (7–28 cm), third (28–100 cm)
    and fourth (100–289 cm). Based on the ERA5 literature, for the vegetation type
    that represents crops from mixed farming, 21% of the root system is in the first
    layer, 41% is in the second layer (the largest part), 31% is in the third layer,
    while only 4% is in the fourth layer (ECMWF, 2016), and thus the second layer
    is of the highest interest in agriculture. Soil types are classified based on
    soil texture as follows: 1 – coarse, 2 – medium, 3 – medium fine, 4 – fine. Characteristic
    values of volumetric soil moisture for different textures are given in Table 1.
    Table 1. Values of soil moisture at saturation (θsat), field capacity (θfc), permanent
    wilting point (θpwp) and plant available water (θpaw), for different soil texture

    0.448 0.279 0.170 Using Climate Data Store Application Programming Interface (API),
    we extracted air temperature at 2 m, dewpoint temperature at 2 m, precipitation
    and volumetric soil moisture content in the second layer (7–28 cm), for the period
    2011–2020, at the location of 28 meteorological stations belonging to the official
    observing network in Serbia (Table 2). In this study, the daily values of meteorological
    variables, i.e., maximum and minimum 2 m temperature (°C), total precipitation
    (mm), vapour pressure deficit (hPa) and average volumetric soil moisture content
    in the second layer (m3 m−3) were used. Vapour pressure deficit was calculated
    as D = E(T) − E(Td) where E stands for the saturation vapour pressure following
    Magnus''s formula (Junzeng, Qi, Shizhang, & Yanmei, 2012), T is the average temperature
    and Td average dewpoint temperature. This variable reflects the rate of evapotranspiration,
    and the higher values force the plant to draw more water from the soil. Table

    These include forecasts of precipitation, temperature at 2 m and dewpoint temperature
    at 2 m, at a spatial resolution of 2 km, and an hourly temporal resolution. For
    the purpose of testing the developed network, forecast data were collected from
    September 2019 until April 2020, at the locations of 28 meteorological stations
    described above. 2.2. Recurrent neural networks RNNs are widely used for time
    series prediction, handwriting recognition, natural language processing and speech
    recognition, since they show excellent performance in “sequence-to-sequence” modelling
    (Goodfellow, Bengio, & Courville, 2016). RNNs are also known as neural networks
    with memory because they are capable of learning dependencies along sequences
    and produce output taking into consideration the previous output, or what they
    learned from the input in the previous time step (Burkov, 2019). In other words,
    RNNs model dynamical systems where xt represents the input at time t and ht, ht−1
    represent hidden states at time t, t−1, respectively (Chen, 2016). Function F
    is used for nonlinear mapping between consecutive time steps, as described in
    Eq. (1) (1) RNNs typically have vanishing gradient problem, i.e., weights are
    becoming irreversibly smaller in every iteration, which slows down or completely
    stops the training. For this reason, LSTM networks have been developed. With a
    memory cell and the gates that control which information passes in and passes
    out, LSTM prevents backpropagation from drastically decreasing the weight changes
    during training and keeps the constant error flow. This architecture lets LSTM
    to learn longer-term dependencies, the network can deal with unlimited number
    of states, and it generalises well (Hochreiter & Schmidhuber, 1997). In this study,
    the hyperopt technique (Bergstra, Yamins, & Cox, 2013) was used on validation
    dataset to determine the optimal hyper-parameters in the experiments. The following
    parameter grid was searched: number of neurons ranged from 10 to 60, number of
    epochs ranged from 40 to 100, batch size ranged from 128 to 512, dropout rate
    ranged from 0.1 to 0.5, recurrent dropout rate ranged from 0.1 to 0.5, while the
    choice for the activation function was between hyperbolic tangent, rectified linear
    unit (ReLU) and exponential linear unit (ELU). After 30 iterations the optimal
    parameters were found. A stacked LSTM with 4 layers and 40 neurons in each layer
    followed by a dense layer with 3 neurons (Fig. 1) was built. For the activation
    function the hyperbolic tangent was used while for weight initialisation the Xavier
    normal initialiser was used (Glorot & Bengio, 2010). During the training period,
    the optimal hyper-parameters were used, i.e., batch size was 128, dropout regularisation
    with the rate of 0.12, while the recurrent dropout rate was 0.25. This means that
    in each iteration some fraction of neurons were randomly deactivated, which helped
    to avoid overfitting and maintain a similar convergence rate of both training
    and validation errors over time. Training and validation procedure was done through
    60 epochs with dropout and Adam optimiser, while mean absolute error (MAE) was
    selected as the loss function. The LSTM network was trained with meteorological
    data and prediction of soil moisture was done for three days ahead. Download :

    study was implemented using Python and open-source libraries, including Keras
    library, commonly used for neural networks on top of TensorFlow, an end-to-end
    open-source machine learning platform. The network was compared to ARIMA (AutoRegressive
    Integrated Moving Average), a traditional statistical forecasting technique (Hewamalage,
    Bergmeir, & Bandara, 2021) and Random Forest (RF) (Breiman, 2001), a classical
    machine learning technique, which has been widely used in water science applications
    recently (Tyralis, Papacharalampous, & Langousis, 2019). All the models were trained
    for the period 2011–2016 and applied with the time step of three days. To build
    the models,daily values of meteorological variables from ERA5 were used. ARIMA
    was trained on individual time series of soil moisture, for each meteorological
    station separately. For this reason, the results of ARIMA predictions were averaged
    across all time series and a single value was obtained for each error metric.
    RF and LSTM used maximum and minimum 2 m temperature, total precipitation and
    vapour pressure deficit as the input data. Initially 60 input days were selected,
    which is taken from the literature (van den Hurk et al., 2012), although the performance
    of the network was tested with shorter time period of 45, 30 and 15 days. RF and
    LSTM were trained across the time series from all 28 meteorological stations jointly,
    whereas RF used the input data as a single vector while LSTM used four different
    time series (Fig. 2). Validation was done for the period 2017–2018 and, according
    to its mode of operation, the statistical model was retrained during the runtime,
    i.e., along the time series. The year 2017 in Serbia was warm and dry, with the
    summer drier than normal compared to the reference period 1981–2010 (HIDMET, 2018),
    which resulted in agricultural drought. The year 2018 was marked by several climatological
    records in Serbia: the warmest year since the record-keeping began (1951), the
    warmest spring and the warmest April, while on the other hand, the summer was
    wetter than normal, with a lot of precipitation in June and July (HIDMET, 2019).
    In order to test the predictive model with Yr weather forecast, instead of only
    the ERA5 data, a separate dataset that comprised of the ERA5 historical records
    and the Yr''s three-day forecasts from September 2019 to April 2020 (Fig. 2) was
    formed. The results of the models were evaluated using MASE (Mean Absolute Scaled
    Error), SMAPE (Symmetric Mean Absolute Percentage Error) and MAE, metrics commonly
    used in the forecasting literature (Armstrong, 2001; Hewamalage et al., 2021;
    Hyndman & Koehler, 2006). Error metrics are given with the following equations:
    (2) (3) (4) where M stands for modelled and O for observed values (here referring
    to ERA5 data), n represents the number of samples, i refers to a specific sample,
    while the denominator in Eq. (2) is the MAE of the one-step “naïve forecast method”,
    which uses the actual value from the prior period as the forecast. MASE and SMAPE
    are dimensionless metrics while MAE has the same unit as considered variable,
    which is soil moisture in this case, given in m3 m−3. Download : Download high-res

    the input data structure for all the models, where ma is the number of days in

    was performed to train the LSTM model with different number of input days ranging
    from 15 to 60, with a 15-day step, in order to predict soil moisture three days
    ahead. The aim of the experiment was to examine if it is possible to decrease
    the time window of input data without compromising the quality of the prediction.
    However, validation showed that as the time window decreased, the error measures
    increased (Table 3). Thus, the initially selected value of 60 input days was opted.
    The same number of input days was used for training RF model as well. Table 3.
    Error measures averaged for all the stations (with standard deviation in round
    brackets) obtained for different number of input days used for training LSTM.

    24.85 (9.02) 0.029 (0.006) The performance of the LSTM model was compared to RF
    and ARIMA, which were used as a benchmark and LSTM expressed the lowest error
    values (Table 4), with SMAPE less than 20%. Being a univariate method in which
    one model is built for each time series ARIMA has limited scaling potential and
    requires frequent retraining (Hewamalage et al., 2021). Theoretically, this univariate
    approach could be used, but only for the regular grid points of ERA5, although
    the fact that ERA5 data are available only with a delay of two months is making
    the traditional approach incapable for practical applications. On the other hand,
    the LSTM and RF models were trained across all time series and one general model
    was built in both cases, that could cover the whole region of interest. This model
    can thus be used at any location in Serbia with reliable weather data. However,
    RF as a method does not consider time sequence of the features, whereby the dynamics
    of atmospheric conditions is of great importance for soil moisture regimes, making
    LSTM a physically more realistic model. Table 4. Error measures averaged for all
    the stations (with standard deviation in round brackets) obtained for different
    prediction methods on the validation dataset. Method MASE SMAPE MAE ARIMA 10.72

    LSTM 3.99 (1.28) 19.76 (9.10) 0.021 (0.006) To discuss the significance of the
    error measures obtained for the different models, the range of soil moisture values
    given in Table 1 and shown in Fig. 3 has to be considered. For all the soil types,
    the range between minimum and maximum soil moisture is around 0.3 m3 m−3, although
    soils with coarse and medium texture have lower minimum values reaching 0.05 m3
    m−3 while soils with fine texture have higher minimum values. Since MAE has the
    unit of m3 m−3, the same as soil moisture, it is the most suitable for comparison
    between the models. Average MAE for ARIMA is 0.055 (almost 20% of the range),
    for RF it is 0.031 (above 10% of the range) while for LSTM it is 0.021 (7% of
    the range), showing much better performance of LSTM when compared to ARIMA and
    slightly better performance when compared to RF, however this difference can be
    essential in the case of dry conditions, when soil moisture values are reaching
    the wilting point. Download : Download high-res image (259KB) Download : Download

    for all the stations, grouped by the soil type. In this study, the predominant
    soil type had medium soil texture and 20 stations out of 28 belonged to the group
    2 (Table 2). Nevertheless, for this soil type median of soil moisture varied a
    lot in the training dataset and the outliers with low values were present at five
    stations, which was particularly evident at station S9 (Fig. 3). Error measures
    for all the stations in Serbia are presented in Table 5. The highest MASE error
    was obtained for station S9 where the learning process of LSTM was clearly affected
    by the outliers. Another high error was obtained for station S11, whereby both
    stations belong to soil type with medium texture. For all other stations, the
    values of MASE were less than six and for some stations MASE was almost one. The
    range of MAE values was between 0.010 and 0.031, showing that LSTM was able to
    learn soil moisture dynamics for all the soil types at various altitudes, thus
    verifying the generalisation capability of the network. Table 5. Error measures

    (LSTM + Yr) and predictions with ERA5 data (LSTM) were compared to original reanalysis
    data of soil moisture (ERA5). Error measures were quite similar in both cases,

    at four stations which belong to different soil types (Fig. 4), where S3 is 1,
    S7 is 2, S5 is 3 and S14 is 4 (Table 2). Visual inspection shows that the alignment
    between the values is notable, even though there are some “false” spikes in soil
    moisture when using Yr forecast due to the uncertainty coming from the weather
    forecast itself, especially at the end of the prognostic period. Table 6. Error

    suggested that a national drought policy should be directed toward reducing the
    risk by raising the awareness with reliable information (Wilhite, 2011). Timely
    monitoring of the agricultural drought is extremely important for developing an
    early warning system which can minimise the losses due to drought (Boken, 2005).
    Satellite observations of surface soil moisture along with the calculated vegetation
    and water indices can be used in an effective way for monitoring dry conditions
    in the fields with proper spatial resolution (Chandrasekar, Sesha Sai, Roy, &
    Dwevedi, 2010), although the temporal resolution of five or more days and the
    presence of cloud cover can be a limiting factor. In this study, a data-driven
    system for calculation of soil moisture on a regional scale using open-source
    weather data was developed, which is able to provide timely information regardless
    of the atmospheric conditions. Shukla, McNally, Husak, and Funk (2014) developed
    a forecast system that simulates soil moisture scenarios using hydrological model
    which was run with seasonal climate scenarios for the upcoming growing season.
    The purpose of that system was to create an agricultural outlook of the drought
    in food-insecure regions of the developing world, although it was clearly affected
    by the uncertainty of seasonal forecasts (Doblas-Reyes et al., 2009). For that
    reason, the focus was on short-range weather forecasts, which have the lowest
    level of uncertainty, when considering different prognostic periods. Matei, Rusu,
    Petrovan, and Mihuţ (2017) developed a data mining system used for predicting
    soil moisture in some agricultural spots in Romania. It was built by using the
    data from 10 weather stations that measured air temperature, precipitation, soil
    temperatures at three depths and soil moisture at 10 cm depth. They tested several
    machine learning models and the best one had accuracy 74.36%. The current work
    obtained average MAE of 0.019 m3 m−3 while predicting soil moisture with LSTM
    using Yr weather forecasts (Table 6), which is around 6% of the range between
    minimum and maximum values of soil moisture, being approximately 0.3 m3 m−3 (Fig.
    3). The proposed methodology will become operational through installation of 500
    automatic weather stations across the fields in Serbia and further integration
    into AgroSense, the national platform for digital agriculture (www.agrosense.rs).
    The data will be used with the LSTM model to calculate the current level of soil
    moisture and, along with the weather forecast, to predict the future states. This
    methodology will be the cornerstone of the AgroSense service for irrigation scheduling,
    as an alarm for warning farmers to react in the case of risk of soil moisture
    declining to the permanent wilting point. 5. Conclusions In this study a LSTM
    network was developed to predict daily values of soil moisture in the second soil
    layer, for three days ahead. The input parameters used were the daily values of
    maximum and minimum air temperature, precipitation and vapour pressure deficit.
    For this purpose, an open-source data from ERA5 reanalysis for Serbia were used.
    Validation was performed for 2017 which had a dry summer and 2018 which had a
    wet summer. The overall performance of the network was characterised with much
    lower values of errors, when compared to ARIMA, a statistical forecasting technique,
    and Random Forest, a classical machine learning algorithm, thus verifying the
    prediction capabilities of the network for all soil types at various altitudes.
    The system was tested with Yr weather forecast and the predictions were in line
    with the ERA5 reanalysis data, proving the system''s potential to be used by the
    farmers as an irrigation scheduling service, specifically for the drought conditions.

    Real-time monitoring of soil matric potential has now become a common practice\
    \ for\nprecision irrigation management. Some crops, such as cranberries, are susceptible\n\
    to both water and anoxic stresses. Excessive variations in soil matric potential\
    \ in\nthe root zone may reduce plant transpiration, due to either saturated or\
    \ dry soil\nconditions, thereby reducing productivity. A timely supply of the\
    \ right amount of water is,\ntherefore, fundamental for efﬁcient irrigation management.\
    \ In this paper, we compare\nthe capabilities of a machine learning-based model\
    \ and a physics-based model to\npredict soil matric potential in the root zone.\
    \ The machine learning model is a random\nforest algorithm, while the physics-based\
    \ model is a two-dimensional solver of Richards\nequation (HYDRUS 2D). After training\
    \ and calibration on a dataset collected in a cranberry\nﬁeld located in Québec\
    \ (Canada), the performance of the two models is evaluated for\n30 different time\
    \ frames of 72-h soil matric potential forecasts. The results highlight\nthat\
    \ both models can accurately forecast the soil matric potential in the root zone.\
    \ The\nmachine learning-based model can achieve better performance when compared\
    \ to the\nphysics-based model, but forecasting accuracy decreases rapidly toward\
    \ the end of the\n72-h lead time, while the error for the Richards equation-based\
    \ model does not increase\nwith time and remain small compared to the typical\
    \ measurement error.\nKeywords: machine learning, physics-based model, soil water\
    \ dynamics, irrigation management, precision\nagriculture, random forest\nINTRODUCTION\n\
    Meeting future food demands for a rising global population while minimizing environmental\n\
    impacts remains a challenge, for which precision irrigation strategies will play\
    \ a critical role\n(Provenzano and Sinobas, 2014). Precision irrigation is based\
    \ on real-time measurements of soil\nmoisture conditions and the capacity of models\
    \ to predict the amount to be applied for irrigation\nscheduling (Autovino et\
    \ al., 2018). When applying water-saving irrigation strategies, one must\nobserve\
    \ water stress indicators, such as soil water content, soil matric potential in\
    \ the root zone,\nleaf water potential, etc. These indicators may help to prevent\
    \ water stress conditions and excessive\nwater use (Rallo et al., 2014). However,\
    \ they do not inform growers on how much water is needed\nto bring the plant root\
    \ zone to optimal conditions. Besides, most of the time, when the plant water\n\
    stress can be observed, it is already too late to act (Rekika et al., 2014), especially\
    \ in highly sensitive\nGumiere et al.\nMachine Learning × Physics-Based Modeling\n\
    crops such as lettuce, tomatoes and cranberries (Lafond\net al., 2015; Pelletier\
    \ et al., 2017). That is why soil-water-\nplant-atmosphere models (SWPA) are often\
    \ used to provide\ninformation on the soil and plant water status (Minacapilli\
    \ et al.,\n2009; Cammalleri et al., 2013; Aguilera and Ruiz-Valenzuela,\n2019).\
    \ Several physically-based and process-based models, such\nas HYDRUS (Autovino\
    \ et al., 2018) and CATHY (Camporese\net al., 2015), are currently used to describe\
    \ water processes\nin the SWPA continuum. After appropriate calibration and\n\
    validation, these models can be used to support irrigation water\nmanagement,\
    \ providing not only the timing of irrigation, but\nalso the amount of water needed,\
    \ therefore helping to increase\nproductivity and reduce water use. For example,\
    \ Bigah et al.\n(2019) proposed a process-based model to predict the water\nneeds\
    \ for diﬀerent cranberry farm operations such as irrigation,\nfrost protection\
    \ and harvest. Rekika et al. (2014) proposed\nan analytical model to estimate\
    \ soil critical matric potential\nthresholds for irrigation management for various\
    \ highly sensitive\ncrops (onions, celery, and baby spinach seed germination).\n\
    In the last few years, along with physics-based models, many\nmachine learning\
    \ (ML) based models have been developed\nand applied to water management. Artiﬁcial\
    \ Neural Networks\n(ANN) have been used to model the water table dynamics of\n\
    various agricultural systems (Dibike and Coulibaly, 2006; Yoon\net al., 2011).\
    \ Li et al. (2016) have compared the capacity of\nRandom Forest (RF) and ANN models\
    \ to predict lake water\nlevels. The results demonstrated that the RF model has\
    \ superior\npredictive capabilities with fewer parameters and training time.\n\
    Decision tree-based models have been successfully applied in\ngroundwater hydrological\
    \ modeling (Singh et al., 2014; Wang\net al., 2018). Marques et al. (2005) used\
    \ ML algorithms to\noptimize water supply for crops at diﬀerent growing stages,\n\
    given the water cost, the market price, cost of irrigation, crop\nexpenses, and\
    \ expected yield reduction due to under- or over-\nirrigation throuhout the entire\
    \ growing period. The resulting\noptimization models were incorporated into a\
    \ decision support\nsystem (DSS) for precision irrigation, but did not account\
    \ for\nﬁeld-speciﬁc characteristics. Literature also comments on models\nfor determining\
    \ irrigation needs based on ﬁeld-speciﬁc data.\nFor example, Hedley et al. (2013)\
    \ used ML to predict soil\nwater status and water table depth based on soil resistivity\n\
    mapping. Smith and Peng (2009) used ML to classify soil\ntextural composition\
    \ based on infrared measurements as an\ninput to a deﬁcit irrigation control system.\
    \ However, none of\nthese studies have compared the performance between physics-\n\
    based and ML-models for predicting soil water status using the\nsame dataset.\n\
    Given the increased popularity of ML approaches, the main\nobjective of this paper\
    \ was to test the eﬃciency of a physics-based\nmodel, HYDRUS-2D, and a ML-based\
    \ model, a Random Forest\n(RF) model, in predicting soil water status for a highly\
    \ sensitive\nand valuable crop. Using a dataset collected at an experimental\n\
    site in Québec (Canada), HYDRUS and RF were used, after\nappropriate calibration\
    \ and training, to predict the water status\nin the root zone with up to a 72-h\
    \ lead time, in the context of real-\ntime precision irrigation management. The\
    \ comparison between\nthe two approaches was made from the perspective of a grower\n\
    or an irrigation manager, who typically only measures soil matric\npotential at\
    \ one location to manage irrigation in their crop-ﬁelds.\nMATERIALS AND METHODS\n\
    Study Area and Hydrometeorological Data\nStudy Area\nThe study area was located\
    \ on a cranberry farm, under a warm\nand humid summer climate, near Québec City,\
    \ Québec, Canada\n(46◦14′N, 72◦02′W). The average rainfall in June and September\n\
    is 48.0 mm and 70.6 mm, while the average temperatures are 17.1\nand 13.3◦C, respectively.\
    \ The location of the farm is shown in\nFigure 1, and the studied cranberry ﬁeldis\
    \ ∼18 ha (40-m wide\nby 450-m long). This site is equipped with a subsurface drainage\n\
    system with four drainage pipes, equally spaced at 12 m, at an\naverage depth\
    \ of 0.9 m below the soil surface. These subsurface\ndrains, which are designed\
    \ to maintain a 0.6-m deep water table\nthroughout the ﬁeld, discharge into a\
    \ control chamber south\nof the site. This setup is designed to ensure adequate\
    \ moisture\nconditions, ideally keeping the plant root zone between −6.5 and\n\
    −4 kPa. Three PVC pipes were inserted vertically at mid-spacing\nbetween the subsurface\
    \ drains, serving as observation wells for\nwater table measurements. The site\
    \ was also equipped with a\nrain gauge.\nCranberry Production\nCranberry (Vaccinium\
    \ macrocarpon Ait.) is a high-value\nperennial crop that has historically been\
    \ grown on wetlands (peat\nsoils), but is also commonly cultivated on sandy anthropogenic\n\
    soils. The cranberries require about 60 mm of water per month\nduring the growing\
    \ season in Québec (Pelletier et al., 2015). The\nwater table must be controlled\
    \ during the growing season because\ntoo dry or too wet conditions can adversely\
    \ aﬀect cranberry\ngrowth and root development (Périard et al., 2017). A water\
    \ table\ndepth between 0.3 and 0.5 m for sandy soils and around 0.6 m for\npeat\
    \ soils can meet cranberry water requirements by capillary rise\n(Périard et al.,\
    \ 2017). A soil with high a hydraulic conductivity\nis preferred to maintain optimal\
    \ water conditions for cranberry\ngrowth by water table control or irrigation\
    \ (Gumiere et al.,\n2017). As mentioned previously, for cranberry production in\n\
    Québec, the optimal range of soil water matric potential in\nthe root zone (i.e.\
    \ 10-cm deep) is between −6.5 and −4.0\nkPa (Caron et al., 2017). Thus, matric\
    \ potential and hydraulic\nconductivity represent the soil properties with the\
    \ largest impact\non cranberry yields.\nHydrometeorological Data and Soil Matric\
    \ Potential\nPrecipitation was measured every 15 min using a rain gauge\n(WatchDog\
    \ 1120 Rain Gauge, Spectrum Technology, Inc., IL\nUS) combined with an ST-4 Hortau\
    \ datalogger (Lévis, Québec,\nwww.hortau.ca). In summer, sprinkler irrigation\
    \ was used for\ncooling crops. Thus, the rain gauge also measured the amount\n\
    of irrigation. The total precipitation used in this study is the sum\nof irrigation\
    \ and rainfall.\nWater table (WT) depth was continuously measured using\na submersible\
    \ pressure transducer (TDH80, Transducersdirect\nInc., Ellington Court Cincinnati,\
    \ Ohio, USA) and a datalogger\nFrontiers in Water | www.frontiersin.org\n2\nApril\

    wirelessly to Hortau’s Irrolis (Irrolis 3 v.3.5.1, Hortau Inc., Lévis,\nQuébec,\
    \ Canada) website. For the physics-based model, WT\nvalues were only used to assign\
    \ the boundary conditions at the\ndrain location.\nSoil matric potential (SMP)\
    \ was measured continuously\nwith commercial tensiometers (HXM-80, Hortau Inc.,\
    \ Lévis,\nQuébec, Canada) connected to the same ST-4 datalogger. The\ntensiometers\
    \ were located at three positions (T1, T2, T3 at\na depth of 10 cm), transversally\
    \ to the subsurface drain, as\nshown in Figure 1. Data were collected every 15\
    \ min and\ntransferred to Hortau’s Irrolis (Irrolis 3 v.3.5.1, Hortau Inc., Lévis,\n\
    Québec, Canada) website. Missing SMP values were interpolated\nfrom existing measurements\
    \ using cubic splines (Moritz and\nBartz-Beielstein, 2017). Hourly SMP values\
    \ used in this study\nare the measured average of four 15-min measurements.\n\
    Figure 2 shows all the hydrometeorological, i.e., precipitation,\nWT and SMP.\n\
    Machine Learning Model\nOverview of the Random Forest (RF) Method\nRandom Forest\
    \ (RF) is a supervised ML method with multiple\nbuilding blocks (decision trees)\
    \ producing an ensemble of\npredictive models (Rodriguez-Galiano et al., 2014).\
    \ Amongst\nsupervised ML algorithms, RF has proven to be suitable for\neither\
    \ classiﬁcation or regression, depending on the nature of the\ntargeted variable.\
    \ For simulating soil matric potential in the root\nzone, we only used regression\
    \ trees (RT).\nThe regression algorithm is built around a set of hierarchically\n\
    structured restrictions, sequentially applied to a root node up to\nterminal nodes\
    \ of the decision tree (Breiman, 2001). To prevent\ncorrelations between the diﬀerent\
    \ RTs, RF develops each tree\nindependently using diﬀerent bootstrap samples extracted\
    \ from\nthe learning dataset and a subset of randomly selected variables\nout\
    \ of the predictive variables (Breiman, 2001). Speciﬁcally, the\nRF builds each\
    \ tree by making them grow from two-thirds of\neach bootstrap sample (in-bag).\
    \ About one-third of the samples\nare excluded from the bootstrap sample (out-of-bag)\
    \ for a non-\nbiased estimation of the regression error. A prediction of the out-\n\
    of-bag (OOB) data is generated for each tree. These predictions\nare subsequently\
    \ averaged to obtain an estimation of the error\nrate of the OOB. The generalization\
    \ error of the RF model\ndepends on the weight of the individual trees and the\
    \ correlations\nbetween them (Qu et al., 2019). The building of a RT follows\n\
    a recursive binary partition approach starting at the root node\nand divides the\
    \ non-correlated variables into two new branches.\nThis recursive division is\
    \ performed on the dependent variable as\na function of the most signiﬁcant independent\
    \ variable, leading\nto the best ensemble of homogeneous populations. Each node\n\
    is then divided using the most homogeneous population among\nthe subsets of predictive\
    \ variables selected randomly at the node.\nFrontiers in Water | www.frontiersin.org\n\

    \ Modeling\nFIGURE 2 | Observed hydrometeorological data collected in the study\
    \ area. From the top, we report rainfall, potential evapotranspiration, soil matric\
    \ potential\nmeasured at T1, T2, and T3 locations, and water table near the drain.\n\
    This division process continues until a predeﬁned number of\nobservations at the\
    \ terminal node (node size) is reached. The\nresult obtained using the RF is,\
    \ in the case of a regression, an\naverage of the predictions from all decision\
    \ trees.\nThe RF regression algorithm can be summarized into three\nbasic steps\
    \ as follows (Breiman, 2001):\n• Diﬀerent bootstrap samples Wi (i = bootstrap\
    \ iteration) are\nrandomly drawn from the original dataset W. Two-thirds of\n\
    the samples are included in a bootstrap sample and one-third\nas the OOB samples.\
    \ Each tree is constructed to correspond to\na particular subset of the bootstrap.\n\
    • At a node in each tree, a new split is randomly selected\nfrom all indices,\
    \ and the input variable with the lowest mean\nsquared error (MSE) is chosen as\
    \ the splitting criterion of the\nregression tree.\n• The data splitting process\
    \ at each internal node is repeated\naccording to the above steps until all randomized\
    \ trees have\nbeen grown, and a stop condition is achieved.\nThe ﬁnal results\
    \ of the regression are calculated as follows, where\nN stands for the number\
    \ of trees in the forest and Tn represents\na tree:\nˆy(Wi) = 1\nN\nN\nX\nn=1\n\

    \ (SMP) at the root zone was predicted hourly from 1\nto 72 h ahead. As input,\
    \ we considered rainfall (P), potential\nevapotranspiration (ET0) and SMP at the\
    \ T1 position only\n(Figure 1) in the root zone of previous time steps. The T1\n\
    position was chosen because most growers typically measure\nsoil matric potential\
    \ in one location only, and the most\nsigniﬁcant position in cranberry ﬁelds is\
    \ indeed in the middle of\ntwo drains.\nThe model was built with separate combinations\
    \ of input\nvariables. Lag times of input variables were generated by means of\n\
    the sliding window method (Brédy et al., 2020), which allowed us\nto restructure\
    \ the time series of P, ET0, and SMP as a supervised\nlearning problem by using\
    \ a size of the lag (d) equal to 168 h.\nThis lag size was chosen to consider\
    \ the inﬂuence of the SMP\nvalues at position T1 over the previous 168-h time\
    \ period on\nthe predictions. Therefore, we constructed the ML-based model\nmaps\
    \ an input window of width d into an individual output value\ny. The model predicts\
    \ the SMP values at the T1 position (yi,t+j,\nwith j the time step forecast) using\
    \ the window: (xi,t+j, xi,t+j−1,\n...,xi,t, ..., xi,t−d+1, xi,t−d) for P and ET0\
    \ and (yi,t, ..., yi,t−d+1,\nyi,t−d) for the antecedent SMP value. Multi-step\

    Machine Learning × Physics-Based Modeling\nBecause of computational time constraints,\
    \ the number of\ndecision trees (ntree) was set to 200; as reported by Rodriguez-\n\
    Galiano et al. (2014) and (Brédy et al., 2020), the gain in accuracy\nis negligible\
    \ for ntree > 200.\nData splitting\nThe experimental dataset consisted of 2,000\
    \ hourly observations\nfor each variable (P, ET0, and SMP at T1 position) ranging\n\
    from July to September 2018. This dataset was split by\nthe holdout method, using\
    \ the “CreateDataPartition” caret\npackage function Kuhn (2020) in two subsets:\
    \ a training\nsubset, which contained 70% of data randomly selected for\neach\
    \ dataset and the remaining 30% that were used as test\nsubset. For each step-ahead\
    \ prediction,this data division was\nrepeated 30 times using a uniform distribution.\
    \ This allowed\nthe models to be trained and validated with a total of 30\ndiﬀerent\
    \ training and test subsets for each training pattern\n(t + 1 to t + 72) and to\
    \ estimate the variability of\ntheir results.\nModel calibration and validation\n\
    The calibration procedure aims to optimize a set of model\nparameter values that\
    \ enable the model to map the relationship\nbetween the inputs and outputs of\
    \ a given dataset (Wu et al.,\n2014). For the RF method, two parameters (ntree\
    \ and mtry) were\nassigned using results and recommendations from the literature:\n\
    200 trees and 1/3 of the predictive variables (Liaw and Wiener,\n2002), respectively.\
    \ The model was trained to determine the\noptimal parameter values that minimize\
    \ the training error. The\ntest data were used to independently assess the generalization\n\

    \ an empirical constant [L−1] related to\nthe inverse of the air entry suction,\
    \ while the dimensionless shape\nparameters n and m are linked by the expression\
    \ m = 1 − 1/n.\nThese parameters are often referred to as the van-Genuchten\n\
    Mualem (VGM) parameters.\nThe sink term (qs) in Richards equation accounts for\
    \ depth-\ndependent root water uptake. The potential evapotranspiration\n(ET0)\
    \ is distributed across the root depth according to a root\ndistribution function.\
    \ Actual evapotranspiration depends on soil\nwater content and, hence, on the\
    \ soil matric potential in the\nroot zone. If the soil is dry, vegetation can\
    \ experience water\nstress, and transpiration would reduce to limit water losses;\n\
    in nearly saturated conditions, the low availability of oxygen\nto roots might\
    \ also cause a decrease in the transpiration rate.\nWe modeled the eﬀect of low\
    \ and high soil moisture on root\nwater uptake by multiplying the potential root\
    \ water uptake by\na reduction function, αrw (Feddes et al., 1974). The reduction\n\
    function, commonly referred to as Feddes function, is zero at\npressure heads\
    \ higher or equal to ψ1, close to saturation when\noxygen stress is inhibiting\
    \ root water uptake. As ψ decreases,\nαrw is assumed to increase linearly up to\
    \ 1 at the anaerobiosis\npoint (ψ2). When pressure head falls below ψ3, associated\n\
    with incipient water stress, transpiration is assumed to decrease\nlinearly, reaching\
    \ zero at the wilting point, ψ4. Between ψ2 and\nψ3 the soil is under well-watered\
    \ conditions and roots can take\nup water at their potential rate (i.e., αrw =\
    \ 1).\nEquation (1) is solved with the HYDRUS-2D (Šimunek et al.,\n2003) using\

    \ before the start of each calibration; such a\nperiod was found to be suﬃcient\
    \ to dissipate the inﬂuence of the\narbitrary initial conditions.\nThe parameters\
    \ of the Feddes model for cranberries are\nknown (Caron et al., 2017), with values\
    \ for ψ1, ψ2, ψ3, and ψ4\nof −0.1, −0.45, −0.75, and −3.0 m, respectively. The\
    \ maximum\nrooting depth is 0.15 m and the root distribution is linear.\nThe VGM\
    \ soil parameters (Ks, φ, θr, α, and n) were calibrated\naccording to the procedure\
    \ described in the next section.\nModel Calibration and Validation\nThe model\
    \ was ﬁrst calibrated using the entire data set of SMP\nwithin the root zone measured\
    \ in the T1 position (Figure 1). This\ncalibration was carried out to evaluate\
    \ the possibility of obtaining\na well performing model. In order to verify the\
    \ accuracy and\nthe physical validity of this simulation, we show in Figure 3\
    \ the\nperformance of the model for all the three tensiometers available,\nalthough\
    \ T2 and T3 were not used for calibration. To minimize\nthe RMSE (Equation 5)\
    \ between observed and simulated\nsoil matric potentials, we used the Marquardt-Levenberg\n\
    parameter estimation technique implemented in HYDRUS\n(Šim˙unek and Hopmans, 2002).\n\
    The same optimization method was used to calibrate the\nsoil parameters in 30\
    \ diﬀerent simulation scenarios, whereby\na time window of 408 h was used for\
    \ calibration and the\nsubsequent 72 h for forecasting, in order to consistently\
    \ compare\nthe forecasting capacity of the calibrated model with that of the\n\
    trained ML algorithm.\nModel Performance Criteria\nThree statistical evaluation\
    \ criteria were used to evaluate both\nmodels predictive power and eﬃciency:\n\
    (1) The root mean square error (RMSE):\nRMSE =\nsPn\ni=1 (yi − ˆyi)2\nn\n(5)\n\
    (2) The Nash-Sutcliﬀe eﬃciency (NSE):\nNSE = 1 −\nPn\ni=1 (yi − ˆyi)2\nPn\ni=1\
    \ (yi − yi)2\n(6)\nAnd (3) the coeﬃcient of determination (R2):\nR2 =\n\n\n\

    \ ˜y average simulated value, ˆyi are the observed data, yi\nthe simulated data,\
    \ yi the mean of observed values and N\nthe number of observations. For a model\
    \ to yield a good ﬁt\nbetween simulated and observed data the RMSE should be close\n\
    to zero, while NSE and R2 close to one. In this study, RMSE\nand NSE statistics\
    \ are used to measure the model performance\nfor forecasting SMP ﬂuctuation whereas\

    \ RMSE, NSE and R2 values, obtained during training,\nare 6.18 cm, 0.74, and 0.79,\
    \ respectively. They suggest a very\ngood agreement between observed and simulated\
    \ values of\nSMP; giving conﬁdence about the possibility of successfully\ncalibrating\
    \ the model and the subsequent comparison with the\nML-based model.\nFigure 4\
    \ shows the comparison between simulated and\nobserved SMP time series at the\
    \ T1 location (root zone) for\n27 of the 30 scenarios. Figure 5 presents a scatter\
    \ plot of\nsimulated vs. observed SMP values at the same location for the\nsame\
    \ scenarios. The temporal dynamics following calibration is\nwell represented\
    \ by the physics-based model, showing average\nperformance criteria for RMSE,\
    \ NSE and R2 of 6.46 cm, 0.72\nand 0.82, respectively. Three simulations, out\
    \ of the 30 scenarios,\ndid not converge due to numerical instabilities, corresponding\
    \ to\n10% of the runs. The reasons for such instabilities can probably\nbe found\
    \ in a complex interplay of initial conditions (a 2-\ndays warm-up used for every\
    \ simulation) and soil parameters\nwhose search space was limited and therefore\
    \ did not allow for\na comprehensive representation of the whole parameter space.\n\
    Another possible explanation is that, due to the very short\ncalibration windows\
    \ (i.e., 360 h) which did not represent the\ntotal range of possible situations\
    \ (i.e., from very dry to very wet\nperiods), the calibration would have needed\
    \ a larger parameter\nspace to reasonably simulate the observed values.\nFigure\
    \ 6 shows box plots of the calibrated van Genuchten-\nMualem\n(VGM)\nparameters\n\
    and\nsaturated\nhydraulic\nconductivity for the 27 scenarios that converged. The\
    \ VGM\nparameters were calibrated individually for each scenario\nusing the Marquardt-Levenberg\
    \ type parameter optimization\nalgorithm for inverse modeling included in HYDRUS-2D.\
    \ The\ninitial VGM parameters were measured in the ﬁeld and were\nﬁxed to the\
    \ same value for each scenario (θr = 0.072, θs = 0.423,\nα = 0.03 cm−1, n = 1.56,\
    \ m = 1 − 1/n, and Ksat = 19.62cm/h).\nThe resulting variability of the soil hydraulic\
    \ properties (VGM)\nis relatively large, with some runs having parameters equal\n\
    to the lower or upper bounds, an additional clue of a limited\nsearch space that\
    \ could have led to the three simulations not\nconverging. Once again, this variation\
    \ may be due to the initial\nsmall windows selected, making the soil hydric condition\
    \ very\ndiﬀerent from window to window, and causing a wide range\nof soil parameters\
    \ required for simulating the water dynamics.\nAnother possible explanation could\
    \ be hysteresis, not accounted\nfor in the model, due to the fact that for some\
    \ windows the\nsystem is mainly draining while for others the water table is\n\
    mainly rising.\nFigure 7 shows the scatter-plot of the relationship between\n\
    observed and simulated SMP values for the forecasting period for\nall the 27 successful\
    \ scenarios. The model performance is still very\ngood, with RMSE = 5.72 cm, NSE\
    \ = 0.78, R2 = 0.82 indicating\nan excellent agreement between simulated and observed\
    \ values of\nSMP in the forecasting period.\nFIGURE 9 | Out-of-the-bag error as\

    \ errors.\nML-Based Model\nFigure 9 shows the out-of-the-bag (OOB) squared error\
    \ over the\nntree parameter for the testing period. For ntree > 50 the error is\n\
    constant, showing no gain for ntree > 200.\nFigure 10 shows the scatter plot between\
    \ observed and\nsimulated SMP values for the 30 testing periods, i.e., 30% of\
    \ the\n408 h of data for each period. The performance metrics over all\nsimulation\
    \ scenarios are RMSE = 8.49 cm, NSE = 0.55, and\nR2 = 0.58, showing a drastic\
    \ reduction of ML-model eﬃciency\nfor testing.\nFigure 11 shows the RMSE as a\
    \ function of forecasting time.\nRMSE values vary from 2 to 8 cm, with a clear\
    \ increasing trend\nover time, conﬁrming a strong reduction of the ML-based model\n\
    prediction capabilities as the forecasting time increases.\nDISCUSSION\nBoth physics-based\
    \ and ML-based models were used here to\npredict SMP values in the root zone of\
    \ a cranberry ﬁeld. The\nML-based model shows a strong dependency on the forecasting\n\
    period. This dependence is somehow expected because the model\nis based on an\
    \ autoregressive relationship of the input variables.\nThe RMSE values increased\
    \ quickly in the ﬁrst 3 h and leveled oﬀ\nfrom hours 20 to 60 in the forecasting\
    \ period, before increasing\nagain. These results are consistent with the ﬁndings\
    \ by Nayak\net al. (2006), who showed that the performance of ML-based\nmodels\
    \ (ANN, RF, Gradient Boosting) was better for shorter\nlead times, but became\
    \ worse as the prediction time increased.\nCompared with ANN models, the tree-based\
    \ ones do not stay\nFrontiers in Water | www.frontiersin.org\n10\nApril 2020 |\

    \ et al.\nMachine Learning × Physics-Based Modeling\nthat both models can provide\
    \ satisfactory forecasting SMP values\nfor irrigation management. Indeed, for\
    \ cranberries, an error of\nless than 10 cm in SMP prediction is acceptable for\
    \ irrigation\nmanagement (Pelletier et al., 2017), considering a period of\nreaction\
    \ of 24 or less for the irrigation to be activated into the\nconcerned ﬁelds.\n\
    The physics-based model has the advantage of being able\nto consistently represent\
    \ the water dynamics over the entire\ndomain, not only where it was calibrated,\
    \ as is the case for\nthe ML-based model for which no extrapolation is possible\n\
    beyond the range of observed values. On the other hand, physics-\nbased models\
    \ need additional eﬀorts to assign proper initial and\nboundary conditions, as\
    \ well as parameter heterogeneity, in order\nto represent the soil water dynamics\
    \ accurately. Also, physics-\nbased models would likely need to be constantly\
    \ calibrated as new\ndata are collected to maintain an eﬀective prediction capability.\n\
    For this study, where the time windows were short, the range of\nvariability in\
    \ the calibrated hydraulic parameters is quite large,\nexcept for the soil hydraulic\
    \ conductivity. Data assimilation could\nrepresent a valid alternative strategy,\
    \ as it would allow model\nusers to regularly update not only the system state,\
    \ but also\nthe model parameters while keeping the advantages of physics-\nbased\
    \ models.\nCONCLUSIONS\nIn this paper, we presented a comparison between a physics-\n\
    based model and an ML-based model to predict the soil matric\npotential in the\
    \ root zone for real-time irrigation management\nof a cranberry ﬁeld. Both models\
    \ were calibrated (trained)\nand validated (tested) with the same dataset of SMP\
    \ for 72 h\nof forecasting scenarios. Both models presented acceptable\nsimulation\
    \ errors in terms of RMSE, R2 and NSE values when\ncompared with observed values.\
    \ From an operational point of\nview, both models could be used for irrigation\
    \ management and\nscheduling. The ML-based model should be used with care for\n\
    long lead times, as it showed signiﬁcant performance degradation\nover time, whereas\
    \ the error of the physics-based model was\nmostly random throughout the forecasting\
    \ period. The ML-\nmodel has the advantage of being easy to implement, as it needs\n\
    a smaller computational eﬀort for training, that is practically\nnegligible compared\
    \ to the same step (calibration) of a physics-\nbased model. On the other hand,\
    \ after proper calibration, the\nphysics-based model could be used to simulate\
    \ water dynamics\neverywhere within the domain for which it was calibrated,\n\
    since it is derived from physical laws of mass conservation\nand hydrodynamics.\
    \ Future developments should include the\ncomparison between both approaches and\
    \ data assimilation\ntechniques, such as the Ensemble Kalman ﬁlter, implemented\n\
    within an operational context.\nDATA AVAILABILITY STATEMENT\nThe datasets generated\

    \ on spatial, temporal, and depth variability of soil salinity at ﬁeld and landscape\n\
    scales is important for a variety of agronomic and environment concerns including\
    \ irrigation in arid\nand semi-arid areas. However, challenges remain in characterizing\
    \ and monitoring soil secondary\nsalinity as it can largely be impacted by managements\
    \ including irrigation and mulching in addition to\nnatural factors. The objective\
    \ of this study is to evaluate apparent electrical conductivity (ECa)-directed\n\
    soil sampling as a basis for monitoring management-induced spatio-temporal change\
    \ in soil salinity\nin three dimensions. A ﬁeld experiment was conducted on an\
    \ 18-ha saline-sodic ﬁeld from Alar’s\nAgricultural Science and Technology Park,\
    \ China between March, and November 2018. Soil ECa was\nmeasured using an electromagnetic\
    \ induction (EMI) sensor for four times over the growing season\nand soil core\
    \ samples were collected from 18 locations (each time) selected using EMI survey\
    \ data\nas a-priori information. A multi-variate regression-based predictive relationship\
    \ between ECa and\nlaboratory-measured electrical conductivity (ECe) was used\
    \ to predict EC with conﬁdence (R2 between\n0.82 and 0.99). A three-dimensional\
    \ inverse distance weighing (3D-IDW) interpolation clearly showed\na strong variability\
    \ in space and time and with depths within the study ﬁeld which were mainly\n\
    attributed to the human management factors including irrigation, mulching, and\
    \ uncovering of\nsoils and natural factors including air temperature, evaporation,\
    \ and groundwater level. This study\nlays a foundation of characterizing secondary\
    \ salinity at a ﬁeld scale for precision and sustainable\nmanagement of agricultural\
    \ lands in arid and semi-arid areas.\nKeywords: soil proﬁle; soil salinization;\

    1. Introduction\nSoil salinization is one of the critical global problems threatening\
    \ land productivity [1]. Saline soils\nhave been reported from more than 100 countries\
    \ around the world and covers more than 1125 million\nhectares of land [2]. It\
    \ is increasing at about 1–2% every year and is estimated that 50% of the available\n\
    arable lands can be aﬀected by soil salinity by 2050 and would pose a serious\
    \ threat to the sustainable\ndevelopment of global agriculture [3]. Salinity could\
    \ form from both natural and artiﬁcial sources\nRemote Sens. 2020, 12, 4043; doi:10.3390/rs12244043\n\
    www.mdpi.com/journal/remotesensing\nRemote Sens. 2020, 12, 4043\n2 of 17\nincluding\
    \ human-induced land management. Low precipitation, high evapotranspiration, and\
    \ saline\ngroundwater often contribute largely in soil salinization in arid and\
    \ semi-arid environments [4].\nSecondary salinization or human-induced management-driven\
    \ salinization of agricultural farmlands\nmainly in the arid and semi-arid desert\
    \ environments cover more than 76 million ha area [2] and\nbecame one of the serious\
    \ environmental and resource problems aﬀecting the ecosystem. Unlike natural\n\
    salinization and humid area, intense climate and short salt migration cycle with\
    \ high frequency as\nimpacted by management create a very high spatial and temporal\
    \ variations in soil salinity and\nmake the measurement, monitoring, and/or prediction\
    \ highly diﬃcult using traditional methods and\nanalysis. The strong spatio-temporal\
    \ variability with depth adds diﬃculty in predicting soil salinity\nin three dimensions\
    \ using traditional methods of ﬁeld sampling combined with laboratory analysis\n\
    while the ﬁeld scale information is crucial for agronomic and environmental management\
    \ decisions.\nFor example, information on salt content in addition to soil moisture\
    \ in a proﬁle is important for\nirrigation scheduling as this may cause physiological\
    \ drought [5]. Thus, a simple, fast, and accurate\nmethods to monitor soil salt\
    \ content in three dimensions (space, time, and depth) is urgently needed to\n\
    ensure the safe and eﬃcient production of salinized and secondary salinized farmlands\
    \ in particular\narid and semi-arid regions [6,7].\nSince the 1970s, apparent\
    \ electrical conductivity measurement using electromagnetic induction\n(EMI) technology\
    \ helped characterizing, monitoring, and evaluating soil salinity [8–13]. It can\
    \ more\neﬃciently and quickly obtain in situ salinity information at diﬀerent\
    \ depths by measuring apparent\nconductivity and helped overcome some challenges\
    \ in traditional sampling methods and reduce\ncosts [14]. For example, Guo et\
    \ al. [15] mapped the spatio-temporal variation of soil salinity at\ndiﬀerent\
    \ site-speciﬁc areas based on EM38, which provide valuable information for formulating\n\
    suitable management strategies against soil salinization. Jiang et al. [16] used\
    \ EMI technology and\nthree-dimensional (3D) inversion models to quantify spatial\
    \ variability of soil salinity under four\ntypical land-use types in Aksu, Xinjiang.\n\
    Quantifying spatio-temporal variations of soil salinity in 3D can help understand\
    \ dynamic changes\nand help determine the degree of salinization and develop management\
    \ strategies. Geostatistics is one\nof the most eﬀective methods to study spatial\
    \ variability of soil properties [17–22]. Three-dimensional\ngeostatistics and\
    \ Kriging have shown strong potential to capture and quantify spatial variability\
    \ in\n3D in diﬀerent ﬁelds including precision agriculture [23]. It has also been\
    \ used in quantifying soil\nsalinity. For example, Li et al. [24] used three-dimensional\
    \ ordinary Kriging interpolation to predict the\nspatial variation of soil salt\
    \ in paddy ﬁelds. Liu et al. [25] used the three-dimensional ordinary Kriging\n\
    interpolation method to evaluate the spatial variation of soil salinity in the\
    \ Yellow River Delta in China.\nWhile these studies showed the potential of quantifying\
    \ soil salinity in 3D from EMI sensor data and\nKriging interpolation, quantiﬁcation\
    \ of soil salinity at a point of time could not capture the dynamics\nof soil\
    \ salinization. For example, in arid and semi-arid areas, because of the high\
    \ evaporation over\nprecipitation, salts frequently migrate, redistribute, and\
    \ accumulate in the soil proﬁle with changes\nin precipitation, irrigation water,\
    \ and evaporation. Salt dynamics as impacted by management can\ngreatly aﬀect\
    \ crop growth. Thus, it is critical to characterize and quantify spatio-temporal\
    \ variations of\nsoil salinity at diﬀerent depths to develop eﬀective strategies\
    \ such as irrigation to manage secondary\nsoil salinity in arid regions. It can\
    \ also provide important information for regional salinized land\nrestoration,\
    \ and scientiﬁc improvement and prevention of land degradation. The overall objective\n\
    of this study is to characterize and quantify dynamics of spatio-temporal variability\
    \ of soil salinity\nin three dimensions. This study used in situ apparent electrical\
    \ conductivity measured using EMI\nsensors and 3D inverse distance weighing interpolation\
    \ to quantify spatio-temporal dynamics of soil\nsalinity at multiple depths under\
    \ cotton irrigated with diﬀerent amounts of irrigation from the arid\narea of\
    \ Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region in Northwest of China.\nRemote Sens. 2020,\

    \ most important production base for high-quality cotton and fruits in China.\n\
    In 2017, the cotton planting area in Xinjiang accounted for 80% of China with\
    \ a plant area of around\n2,217,000 ha. A ﬁeld experiment was conducted at the\
    \ National Agricultural Science and Technology\nPark of Alar City, southern Xinjiang\
    \ (80◦30′~81◦58′E and 40◦22′~40◦57′N) (Figure 1). It is in the ﬂood\nplain and\
    \ delta zone of the upper Tarim River and at the conﬂuence of Hetian River, Aksu\
    \ River,\nand Yeerqiang River. The terrain is high in the southwest and low in\
    \ the northeast with mild slope of\nabout 0.3 to 0.7%. The average annual evaporation\
    \ is 1988 mm, and the average annual precipitation is\n48.5 mm. The main crop\
    \ in the park is cotton, and the agricultural production level is high, which\
    \ is\nreﬂected in the high level of crop yield per unit area, high degree of agricultural\
    \ mechanization,\nand high degree of intensiﬁcation. The large-scale, standardized,\
    \ and industrialized production and\nmanagement in the park provide a demonstration\
    \ role for the agricultural production in southern\nXinjiang. The experimental\
    \ ﬁeld is about 18 hm2 in area and was planted with Xinluzhong No. 78\nvariety\
    \ of cotton. During spring and winter, ﬂood irrigation was employed to leach salts,\
    \ while drip\nirrigation was adopted for the cropping period. The winter irrigation\
    \ was carried out on November 20,\nwith a total amount of 59,400 m3. A total of\
    \ ﬁve irrigations were applied over the growing period;\nﬁrst irrigation was on\

    \ (geodetic conductivity meter, EM38-MK2) (Geonics Ltd., Mississauga, ON, Canada)\n\
    was used in this study to in situ measure soil apparent electrical conductivity\
    \ (ECa, mS/m). While the\noriginal EM38 model carries a transmitter and a receiver\
    \ coil at 1-m apart, the EM38-MK2 model carries\ntwo receiver coils at 0.5 m and\
    \ 1.0 m far from the transmitter coil and can provide ECa data at four\ndiﬀerent\
    \ depths [26]. The new EM38-MK2 model also adopts new technology to automatically\
    \ perform\ntemperature compensation, correct circuit faults, and eliminate data\
    \ drift caused by the temperature\nvariations [27].\nAn EM38-MK2 model was embedded\
    \ into a wooden cart along with a GPS and was used to map\nthe whole ﬁeld for\
    \ four times between July and October. Measurements were done on 15 March 2018\n\
    (after winter irrigation) before cotton sowing, 3 June (before the ﬁrst drip irrigation),\
    \ 7 July (before the\nsecond drip irrigation), and 27 October (after cotton harvesting\
    \ but before winter irrigation) using the\nvertical measurement mode from south\
    \ to north of the survey ﬁeld. More details of the experiment\nand data collection\
    \ can be found in Liu et al. [28]. Based on the spatial scale of the study area,\
    \ a total of\nten measurement rows were developed with a row spacing of 20 m (Figure\
    \ 1). Descriptive details of\nthe soil ECa measurement are presented in Table\

    \ between the measured electrical conductivity and the apparent electrical\nconductivity,\
    \ soil proﬁle samples were collected from the ﬁeld. While high density sampling\
    \ can\nensure the stability of the relationship, it largely increases cost, time,\
    \ and labor. In contrast, EM38-MK2\nsurvey provides relative variability of soil\
    \ salinization within the ﬁeld and can be used to select\nsampling locations a\
    \ priori while capturing the variability. Roughly, the EM38-MK2 soil apparent\n\
    electrical conductivity data were divided into three groups: low (<50 mS m−1),\
    \ medium (50~100 mS\nm−1), and high (>100 mS m−1). Six sampling locations were\
    \ randomly selected within each of these\nzones identiﬁed from the EM38-MK2 survey\
    \ data. A total of 18 soil cores were collected each time for\nfour times (15\
    \ March, 3 June, 7 July, and 27 October 2018) of ﬁeld measurement. The proﬁles\
    \ were\nthen sub-sampled at 0–20, 20–40, 40–60, 60–80, and 80–100 cm depth layers,\
    \ placed in plastic bags,\nnumbered, and sent to laboratory for further analysis\
    \ [28,29]. The soil samples were immediately\ntested for soil moisture content\
    \ using the over drying method. Remaining soil samples were air-dried,\ngravel,\
    \ roots, and other visible residues were picked out, and ground and passed through\
    \ a 2-mm sieve.\nAfter preparing the soil saturated extract [28,30], the LeiCi\
    \ DDS-307A (Shengke, Shanghai, China)\nconductivity meter was used to determine\
    \ the soil conductivity ECe (dS m−1).\n2.4. Model Construction and Evaluation\n\
    The 18 soil proﬁles were sorted and randomly divided into training dataset (12\
    \ proﬁles) and\nvalidated dataset (6 proﬁles) at a ratio of 2:1. Linear and multivariate\
    \ linear regression methods\nwere used to construct a predictive relationship\
    \ between measured soil electrical conductivity and\nRemote Sens. 2020, 12, 4043\n\
    5 of 17\nsoil apparent electrical conductivity. Coeﬃcient of determination (R2),\
    \ root mean squared error\n(RMSE), relative percent deviation (RPD), and mean\
    \ error (ME) were calculated to evaluate the model\nperformance. The related formulas\
    \ are as follows:\nMean error:\nME = 1\nm\nN\nX\ni=1\n[z∗(si) − z(si)]\n(1)\n\

    \ the predicted value, and z(si) was the measured value. z∗(si)ave and z(si)ave\
    \ were\nthe averaged predicted and measured value, respectively. N was the sample\
    \ number. A RPD ≥ 2.0\nindicates a good predictive ability of the model and a\
    \ R2 value close to 1, RMSE close to 0, ME close to\n0 indicate better model performance\
    \ [23,31,32].\n2.5. Spatial Interpolation and Mapping\nThree-dimensional inverse\
    \ distance weighting (3D-IDW) is one of the most used techniques for\nthree-dimensional\
    \ interpolation. IDW is based on the basic assumption of the “ﬁrst law of geography”:\n\
    that is, the similarity of two objects decreases as the distance between them\
    \ increases. The weights\nwere calculated based on the distance between the observed\
    \ points. The closer the sample point is,\nthe greater is the weight. This study\
    \ used the method of calculating weight coeﬃcients of known\npoints improved by\
    \ Frank and Nielson in 1980 [33], which can obtain higher precision results than\n\
    Shepard’s classic method [12]. The relevant calculation formulas are:\nF(x, y,\
    \ z) =\nn\nX\ni=1\nwi fi\n(6)\nwi =\n\"\nR − hi\nRhi\n#2\x1E Xn\ni=1\n\"\nR −\
    \ hi\nRhi\n#2\n(7)\nhi =\nq\n(x − xi)2 + (y − yi)2 + (z − zi)2\n(8)\nwhere, F\
    \ is the attribute value of the point to be estimated; wi is the weight coeﬃcient\
    \ assigned to the\npoint to be estimated; hi is the distance from the point to\
    \ be estimated to the interpolation point; R is\nthe distance from the interpolation\
    \ point to the farthest point to be estimated; n is the total number\nof points\
    \ to be estimated; (x, y, z) are the coordinates of each interpolation point;\
    \ (xi, yi, zi) are the\ncoordinates of each point to be estimated; and fi is the\
    \ attribute value of the known interpolation point.\nIn interpolating, 75% (7500)\
    \ of the total number of samples from diﬀerent periods (10,000) were used\nRemote\
    \ Sens. 2020, 12, 4043\n6 of 17\nas the training data set, and 25% as the independent\
    \ validation data set. The RMSE, ME, R2 between\nthe measured value and the measured\
    \ value were calculated to assess the model performance [12,34].\n3. Results\n\
    3.1. Predictive Relationship between ECe and ECa\nBest of linear and multiple\
    \ linear regression relationships between ECe and ECa at ﬁve diﬀerent\ndepths\
    \ and four diﬀerent times are presented in Table 2. The relationships were developed\
    \ for ECe\nvalues of 12 proﬁles (calibration dataset) and validated with the rest\

    \ ME ranged between −0.45 and 0.32,\nRMSE < 1.30 dS m−1 and RPD > 2.0 for all\
    \ models. These clearly showed that the predictive models\nhave good ability and\
    \ the ECa of EM38-MK2 can be successfully used to accurately estimate soil\nECe\
    \ both in space and with depths. The predictive models of each soil layer in diﬀerent\
    \ periods\nwere then applied to the entire ﬁeld, and the conductivity of each\
    \ soil layer in diﬀerent periods was\nobtained which were then used to interpolate\
    \ using 3D-IDW to quantify spatio-temporal variation of\nsoil salinization.\n\
    3.2. Temporal Variation of Soil Salinity\nDescriptive statistics of predicted\
    \ ECs from EM38-MK2 measured ECa data at diﬀerent soil layers\nand depths are\
    \ presented in Table 4. Great diﬀerences were observed among the temporal distribution\n\
    characteristics and salt content in the soil proﬁle. The salt content in March\
    \ showed minor variations\nin the distribution within the proﬁles with an average\
    \ value between 0.78 and 0.88 dS m−1, a relatively\nlow amount. This is mainly\
    \ attributed to the ﬂood irrigation used during winter to wash the salts of the\n\
    0–100cm soil proﬁle. Following the desalinization, the soil froze as the temperature\
    \ went below 0 ◦C\nduring winter and the salts could not move within the proﬁle.\
    \ In contrast, soil proﬁles in June, July,\nand October showed obvious salt accumulation\
    \ at surface layers. Salts in June and October were mainly\nconcentrated in the\
    \ surface 0–20 cm layer. The average conductivity of the topsoil (0–20 cm) layer\
    \ in\nJune and October was 3.32 and 5.28 dS m−1, respectively. Average soil conductivity\
    \ of the other four\nsoil layers (20–100 cm) in June and October ranged from 0.99\
    \ to 1.36 dS m−1, and 0.95 to 1.70 dS m−1,\nrespectively. Accumulation of salts\
    \ at 0–20 cm layer during this period is related to the lack of irrigation\nfor\
    \ a longer time. There was no irrigation between November 2017 (applied as winter\
    \ irrigation) and\n3 June 2018 (the ﬁrst irrigation). Moreover, precipitation\
    \ is also low during this period. In addition,\nduring April, as the temperature\
    \ in this area reached above 20 ◦C, evaporation became stronger. As the\nRemote\
    \ Sens. 2020, 12, 4043\n7 of 17\nwater left soil surface as evaporation, salts\
    \ accumulated on the surface. However, salts were mainly\nconcentrated within\
    \ 0–40 cm layers during the July measurement. The average conductivity of 0–20\
    \ cm\nand 20–40 cm soil layer were 2.45 and 2.25 dS m−1, respectively. The amount\
    \ of drip irrigation water\ncontributed to the accumulation of salts in July at\
    \ a depth of 0–40 cm. The maximum drip irrigation\nwater volume was only 600 m3\
    \ hm−2, and the maximum wetting depth of this water volume was 40 cm.\nTherefore,\
    \ the salt accumulated in 0–20 cm in the early stage can only be transported within\
    \ the soil\ndepth of 0–40 cm. The conductivity in deeper soil layers (40–100 cm)\
    \ ranged from 0.87 to 0.93 dS m−1.\nTable 3. Cross-validated results of models\

    \ Sens. 2020, 12, 4043\n8 of 17\nFrom a general evaluation based on coeﬃcient\
    \ of variation, CV < 0.1 indicates weak variability,\n0.1 ≤ CV < 1.0 indicates\
    \ moderate variability, and CV ≥ 1.0 indicates strong variability [34]. The soil\n\
    conductivity in diﬀerent periods showed moderate variability except on 3 June\
    \ which showed strong\nvariability within 0–40 cm soil layer.\nIt may be that\
    \ the temperature reached at the highest in\nJune and thus the evaporation compared\
    \ with the other months [33]. This led to strong variability\nof surface soil\
    \ water and salt.\nDuring this time, an extreme high salt content of 20.40 dS\
    \ m−1\nwas observed in the surface soil layer. Though, the skewness of soil conductivity\
    \ was close to 0,\nthe kurtosis deviated from 3 indicating a deviation from normal\
    \ distribution in soil salinity values.\nAfter logarithmic transformation, the\
    \ distribution of soil conductivity approximated to the normal\ndistribution,\
    \ though there existed a long tail on the left because of the existence of outliers.\n\
    3.3. Spatio-Temporal of Distribution of Soil Electrical Conductivity in Three\
    \ Dimensions\nThe predicted soil ECe from the ECa measurements and the models\
    \ (Table 2) were used to\ncharacterize the spatio-temporal distribution of soil\
    \ salinity in 3D. In visualizing the spatio-temporal\ndistribution, a 3D gridded\
    \ system was used in the format of X-Y-Z for 3D-IDW interpolation where the\n\
    X-axis was equal to the width of the ﬁeld, i.e., 200 m, the Y-axis was equal to\
    \ the length of the ﬁeld,\ni.e., 1000 m, the Z-axis was the depth of the soil\
    \ proﬁle, i.e., 1 m. The 3D grid system provided a voxel\nsize of 10 m × 10 m\
    \ × 0.01 m to a total of 20 × 100 × 10 = 20,000 voxels or cells (Figure 2). In\
    \ performing\n3D-IDW interpolation, the Z axis was enlarged by 300 times, and\
    \ the number of search points was set\nto 6 [35], and then the map of spatio-temporal\
    \ distribution of soil conductivity was obtained (Figure 3).\nFigure 3 intuitively\
    \ revealed spatio-temporal variation of soil salinity in 3D and the simple visual\n\
    observation could provide valuable information on the status of soil salinity\
    \ [36] and development of\nmanagement practices such as irrigation in cotton ﬁeld.\n\

    \ by the American Salinity Laboratory [30],\nthe soil ECe in this study was divided\
    \ into ﬁve levels: non-saline soil (0~2 dS m−1), mildly saline\nsoil (2~4 dS m−1),\
    \ moderately saline soil (4~8 dS m−1), heavily saline soil (8~16 dS m−1), saline\

    \ soil salinity (Figure 2), with an\naverage soil conductivity of 0.84 dS m−1\
    \ and was categorized as non-saline soil. Between June\nand October with cotton\
    \ on ground, soils were categorized as mildly saline soil, moderately saline\n\
    soil, and heavily saline soil. While heavily saline soils exhibited scattered\
    \ spatial patterns in June,\nmore concentrated spatial patterns were observed\
    \ in July and October. The degree of soil salinization\nin October was stronger\
    \ than other months. Most of the soils in October were categorized as moderate\n\
    to heavily salinized soils with a low amount of non-salinized soils.\nThe cross-sections\
    \ in diﬀerent directions of the study ﬁeld were selected to analyze the spatial\n\
    characteristics of soil salts (Figure 4). For example, the A-A’ and B-B’ sections\
    \ traversed from the\nnortheast to the southwest of the study area, and the C-C’\
    \ and D-D’ sections traversed from the southwest\nto the northeast of the study\
    \ area (Figure 2). In general, an increasing amount of salt accumulated in\nwhole\
    \ of the 0–100 cm soil proﬁle from March to October (Figure 4). However, temporal\
    \ diﬀerences\nwere observed in the spatial distribution of soil salts. For example,\
    \ in the northern part of the study\narea, the soil mainly changed from non-salinized\
    \ soil to mild and moderately salinized from March to\nJune. However, from June\
    \ to July, the part of mildly and moderately salinized soil in the middle to the\n\
    northern part of the study area became non-salinized. The area under moderately\
    \ and heavily saline\nsoil in the southern part of the experimental area increased\
    \ during this time. However, from July to\nOctober, the area of mildly, moderately,\
    \ and heavily saline soil increased signiﬁcantly, and the area of\nnon-saline\
    \ soil decreased sharply.\nRemote Sens. 2020, 12, 4043\n10 of 17\n \ntemporal\
    \ differences were observed in the spatial distribution of soil salts. For example,\

    \ soil to mild and \nmoderately salinized from March to June. However, from June\
    \ to July, the part of mildly and \nmoderately salinized soil in the middle to\
    \ the northern part of the study area became non-salinized. \nThe area under moderately\

    \ during this time. However, from July to October, the area of mildly, moderately,\
    \ and \nheavily saline soil increased significantly, and the area of non-saline\
    \ soil decreased sharply. \n \nFigure 4. Cross sectional view of the distribution\

    \ soil in \nthe study area increased with depth at different periods, while the\
    \ area of saline soil (mild, moderate, \nand severe) exhibited reverse pattern\
    \ within the soil profile (Table 5). Salts exhibited a tendency to \naccumulate\
    \ in the surface soil layers. This accumulation also differed with the amount\
    \ of salts that \nare present in the soil profile. The salt accumulation pattern\
    \ covering certain areas also varied with \ntime. For example, the area of mildly\
    \ salinized soil increased in soil layer of 0–20 cm to 20–40 cm \nwhile the area\
    \ of mildly salinized soil decreased with increase in soil depth. \n \n \nFigure\

    \ 99% of the area became non-salinized soil with only a\npart as mildly saline\
    \ soil. There is high probability of seasonal salinity in cotton ﬁelds in arid\
    \ areas\nfrom the winter irrigation on 15 March to the cotton ball period on 3\
    \ June. Under the combined\neﬀects of evaporation and transpiration, deep groundwater\
    \ carried soluble base ions with increased\ncapillary action and enriched surface\
    \ soil layers with salt. The proportion of non-saline soil gradually\ndecreased\
    \ at the surface layer. The proportion of salinized soil area (moderate, severe),\
    \ exhibited an\nincreasing-decreasing-increasing trend from the eﬀect of drip\
    \ irrigation with repeated rainfall in the\nsurface soil (0–20 cm). The moderately\
    \ and heavily saline soils were slightly reduced after leaching,\nwhile the areas\
    \ of mildly saline soil in diﬀerent soil layers were gradually increased.\nThe\
    \ performance of 3D-IDW model was evaluated using cross-validation and the parameters\n\

    \ prediction relationship between ﬁeld-measured soil electrical conductivity and\n\
    the sensor-measured such as ground-based electromagnetic induction sensors or\
    \ spectral index\nbased remote sensing sensors is not new. For example, Rhoades\
    \ and Crowin (1981) and Slavich\n(1990) successfully used multiple linear regression\
    \ to correlate electromagnetic induction to ground\nmeasurement of soil proﬁle\
    \ ECa which provided a good reference for subsequent researches [37,38].\nLiu\
    \ et al. (2013) comprehensively used soil proﬁle data and spectral index calculated\
    \ from remote\nsensing imageries to analyze and evaluate spatial variability of\
    \ three-dimensional salinity at regional\nscale [39]. This provided a way to quantify\
    \ and improved the accuracy of the three-dimensional\nprediction of regional soil\
    \ salinity. In this study, we used the electromagnetic induction-based sensor\n\
    to measure ECa and use that as prior knowledge to optimize soil sampling. Then\
    \ the apparent\nconductivity and the soil salt content at diﬀerent depths were\
    \ used to establish multivariate linear\nmodel. The predictive models show improved\
    \ performance (R2 ranged from 0.824 to 0.994) than\nprevious studies [25,40] and\
    \ provided justiﬁcation to use for further analysis.\nCorwin and Lesch (2014)\
    \ used covariance analysis to establish a regional-scale electromagnetic\ninduction-salt\
    \ calibration model. The model was used in other research areas and signiﬁcantly\
    \ reduced\nthe number of soil samples required for modeling and greatly reduced\
    \ the labor and economical\ncost [41]. Unlike the covariance modeling method,\
    \ in this study we used the multivariate linear model\nfor inversion of salinity\
    \ from apparent conductivity at the farmland scale. The soil texture, bulk density,\n\
    and water content in the study ﬁeld are relatively uniform. Therefore, further\
    \ study required to explore\nthe extended application of our method at larger\
    \ spatial scales. In this study, factors such as soil\nwater content, pH, soil\
    \ texture were introduced as covariates in the multiple linear regression model.\n\
    However, the accuracy of the model did not exhibit any signiﬁcant improvement\
    \ over the model with\nsingle covariate, the salt content. Thus, soil water content,\
    \ pH, and soil texture were not included\nin the ﬁnal model. In addition, the\
    \ inversion model of soil conductivity of diﬀerent soil layers at\nfour diﬀerent\
    \ periods was established. The accuracy of the local model and the global model\
    \ were\ncompared, and the local model with better performance was ﬁnally selected\
    \ and applied in our study.\nRemote Sens. 2020, 12, 4043\n12 of 17\nHowever, as\
    \ the local model development requires higher resources, future work should focus\
    \ on\ndeveloping global model with high performance to reduce the labor and economical\
    \ cost when survey\nis conducted at large spatial scale. Similarly, diﬀerent methods\
    \ such as covariance modeling methods\nas well as machine learning need to be\
    \ tested at large spatial scale, which already showed improved\nperformance in\
    \ soil management and precision agriculture.\nCurrently, obtaining three-dimensional\
    \ discrete data of soil salinity through electromagnetic\ninduction inversion\
    \ models is one of the main ways to map 3D spatial variability of soil salinity\
    \ [25,40].\nAn interpolation method can be used to estimate the target variables\
    \ at non sampling sites [25,42].\nPresently, the commonly used three-dimensional\
    \ interpolation methods are mostly extended from\nthe two-dimensional interpolation\
    \ methods including IDW and Kriging. However, previous studies\nmainly focused\
    \ on modeling geological bodies, and few studies concentrated on soil properties.\n\
    Additionally, most of these spatial interpolation methods were developed with\
    \ certain assumptions\nand have related limitations. For example, Kriging methods\
    \ need to satisfy the second-order stationary\nhypothesis and the choice and ﬁtness\
    \ of semi-variance function has critical eﬀects on the prediction\naccuracy [43–47].\
    \ In addition, Kriging methods would smooth detailed information which is usually\n\
    what the end-users are concerned with especially in precision agriculture. IDW\
    \ uses a simple reciprocal\ndistance as weights to estimate the target variable\
    \ at unmeasured sites. The IDW method includes\na few parameters and is simple\
    \ and easy to employ, which makes it one of the most widely used\nmethod [43,47–49].\
    \ Therefore, in this study we used 3D-IDW [50] to map spatio-temporal variation\
    \ of\nsoil salinity at three dimensions in the soil proﬁle.\n4.2. Controlled Factors\
    \ of Soil Secondary Salinization\nThe spatio-temporal heterogeneity of soil salinization\
    \ is caused by the interaction of natural\nand anthropogenic factors. Natural\
    \ factors mainly include soil parent material, soil permeability,\ngroundwater\
    \ depth, topography and hydrogeology, rainfall, temperature, relative humidity,\
    \ and wind\nspeed. Anthropogenic or human factors mainly include farmland irrigation,\
    \ drainage, farming styles,\nand planting systems [51–54]. In arid and semi-arid\
    \ regions, when the amount of evaporation is greater\nthan the rainfall and the\
    \ depth of the local water table is less than 1.5 m, the salt tends to accumulate\n\
    on the soil surface. The experimental area is in extreme arid area of southern\
    \ Xinjiang in Northwest of\nChina, where the annual evaporation is 40 times of\
    \ the annual rainfall [12]. The northern part of the\nstudy area is less than\
    \ 0.5 km away from the Tarim River. The depth of the groundwater level in the\n\
    test area varies with season and is aﬀected by the ﬂood season of the Tarim River.\
    \ These anthropogenic\nand natural factors contribute to the three-dimensional\
    \ distribution of soil salinity in diﬀerent periods.\nThe main reason of non-saline\
    \ soil in March is that the winter irrigation washes the soil salt to\na depth\
    \ of >1 m. Winter temperature also inﬂuences this as frozen soil layer prevents\
    \ the upward\nmovement and accumulation of soil salt. The main reason for the\
    \ highest degree of salinization in\nJune is the temperature. High temperature\
    \ and strong evaporation draw water from salty and shallow\ngroundwater through\
    \ capillaries. In addition, the study area adopts drip irrigation under the ﬁlm.\n\
    The large area of exposed soil between the ﬁlm is also aﬀected by the temperature.\
    \ These lead to the\naccumulation of salt at the soil surface and form salt crust.\
    \ Moreover, the soil texture in the study area is\nmainly sandy loam, with poor\
    \ water retention, resulting in the formation of secondary soil salinization.\n\
    The degree of salt accumulation also depends on the leaching ratio; proportion\
    \ of irrigation water or\nprecipitation ﬂowing outside the soil. As the leaching\
    \ ratio decreases, soil salt gradually accumulates\nin the soil [5].\nThe ﬂood\
    \ season in the Tarim River basin is from July to September. The groundwater level\
    \ in the\nstudy area is less than 1.5 m during this period. During this time,\
    \ the study area only received one\ndrip irrigation, and the maximum wetting depth\
    \ was only 40 cm. Aﬀected by the uncovering of the\nﬁlm (cotton was harvested\
    \ in October) and high temperature, the salts moved upward and formed\nsecondary\
    \ salinization in the surface soil.\nRemote Sens. 2020, 12, 4043\n13 of 17\nSoil\
    \ salinity showed strong spatial and temporal heterogeneity. Within the root zone,\
    \ the soil\nsalinity generally is the result of the complex interaction of meteorology,\
    \ topography, human factors,\nsoil properties, soil genesis, and biological factors.\
    \ The complex three-dimensional spatial distribution\npattern of salt within the\
    \ root system often has a coeﬃcient of variation greater than 60% [55]. In arid\n\
    areas, salt accumulations in the root zone can cause various problems for crops\
    \ or plants development.\nSoil salinization aﬀects the normal growth and development\
    \ of crops and can also lead to reduction of\ncrop yield. However, the harmful\
    \ eﬀects of soil salinity vary with crop types, climate, soil fertility,\nsoil\
    \ physical conditions, and soil moisture status [56]. Therefore, there is a greater\
    \ uncertainty on\nthe threshold of soil salinity that can pose negative eﬀects\
    \ on crop yield. Thus, the information on\nthree-dimensional spatial distribution\
    \ of soil salinity in diﬀerent periods can essentially contribute to\nmaking more\
    \ scientiﬁc ﬁeld-management measures.\n4.3. Impacts of Precision Agriculture on\
    \ Crop Yields and the Environment\nTraditional agricultural production inputs\
    \ such as fertilizers, irrigation water, pesticides ignore the\ninherent spatial\
    \ heterogeneity that exist between and within the ﬁelds. Uniform agricultural\
    \ production\ninputs can lead to abuse of agricultural resources. In most of the\
    \ cases, farmers would tend to increase the\ninput of fertilizer and irrigation\
    \ water to improve the crop yields. However, overuse of crop inputs can\nlead\
    \ to decline in proﬁtability and various environmental issues such as eutrophication\
    \ [5]. The increase\nin global population is demanding more food, posing great\
    \ pressure to our agricultural production\nsystems. In this context, precision\
    \ agriculture aims to make full use of the electronic information\ntechnology\
    \ to monitor spatio-temporal variation of soil properties for site-speciﬁc management\
    \ [57–60].\nIt can optimize production capacity and proﬁtability of crops, maximize\
    \ the use of limited agricultural\ninputs, and reduce the negative eﬀects on the\
    \ environment and humans [61]. Corwin and Plant (2005)\nintroduced the application\
    \ of electromagnetic induction technology ECa in precision agriculture [62].\n\
    At the beginning of the 21st century, the electromagnetic induction technology\
    \ was mainly applied to\ncrop management in speciﬁc locations [63,64].\nCurrently,\
    \ the precision agriculture mainly relies on real-time monitoring of soil conditions\
    \ using\ninformation technology and GPS technology, and then analyzing and managing\
    \ the spatio-temporal\nvariability of soil and ﬁeld crops. These information help\
    \ make decision on precision application\nof crop inputs including water and fertilizer.\
    \ It can improve the eﬃciency and reduce the losses of\nwater and fertilizer.\
    \ Precision irrigation can timely, accurately, and quantitatively match crops’\
    \ water\ndemand, reduce unnecessary runoﬀ, leakage, and evaporation losses, and\
    \ reduce soil nitrogen losses\nand groundwater salinity. Information on 3D variability\
    \ of soil salinity at multiple times over the\ngrowing season can help develop\
    \ decisions and adopt precision agriculture. Results obtained in this\nstudy could\
    \ help us to get quantitative information about soil salt content and provide\
    \ good foundation\nfor understanding the relationship between water and salt structure\
    \ as well as underlying processes of\nsalt accumulation. Monitoring spatio-temporal\
    \ variation of soil salinity at three dimensions in a timely\nand cheap manner\
    \ is of great signiﬁcance for maintaining the sustainable development of agricultural\n\
    production mainly in the arid and semi-arid regions of the world and this study\
    \ lays foundation of\nsuch an important topic.\n5. Conclusions\nSoil salinity\
    \ is the most critical soil degradation issues around the world, particularly\
    \ in the arid\nand semi-arid regions. Along with the natural factors, anthropogenic\
    \ management of agricultural lands\nsuch as irrigation contributes to secondary\
    \ soil salinity. Thus, monitoring and management of this\nsalinity over the growing\
    \ season are critical for sustainable management of these already vulnerable\n\
    lands. In this study, we collected apparent electrical conductivity data (using\
    \ electromagnetic induction\nsensing technology) and soil proﬁle samples from\
    \ a typical cotton ﬁeld in arid areas for four times.\nWe constructed inversion\
    \ models of diﬀerent soil layers in diﬀerent periods and developed 3D-IDW\ninterpolation\
    \ model to quantify spatio-temporal variations of soil electrical conductivity.\n\
    Remote Sens. 2020, 12, 4043\n14 of 17\nThe main conclusions of this study can\
    \ be summarized as:\n(1)\nThe inversion model showed very good performance for\
    \ estimating the soil apparent conductivity\nwith R2 ranging between 0.824 and\
    \ 0.994.\n(2)\nThe soil electrical conductivity showed strong spatio-temporal\
    \ variations. because of strong root\nactivity and evaporation demand from environmental\
    \ forcing, surface soil layer (0–20) exhibited\nmoderate variability while other\
    \ soil layers exhibited strong variability. After the cotton was\nharvested on\
    \ 27 October, the variability in soil electrical conductivity became stable.\n\
    (3)\nAfter winter irrigation, the salt content was low, and the salts were uniformly\
    \ distributed in the\nsoil proﬁle. After cotton sowing, salts were mainly accumulated\
    \ in soil within the surface 0–40 cm\ndepth. The main factors aﬀecting the soil\
    \ salt content and its distribution in diﬀerent periods in\nthe study area were\
    \ irrigation, groundwater depth, degree of groundwater salinity, temperature,\n\
    and the mulching plastic ﬁlm.\n(4)\nThe 3D-IDW interpolation method showed good\
    \ accuracy in predicting three-dimensional\nspatio-temporal variability of soil\
    \ conductivity multiple times, and the R2 varied between 0.76\nand 0.77.\nThis\
    \ study provides new dimension in implementing precision irrigation practices\
    \ in cotton ﬁelds\nin arid areas based on the three-dimensional variations of\
    \ salts over the growing season.\nAuthor Contributions: Conceptualization, B.H.,\

    How much is enough in watering

    plants? State-of-the-art in

    irrigation control: Advances,

    challenges, and opportunities

    with respect to precision

    irrigation

    With a rapidly expanding global population placing an ever growing demand on

    freshwater resources, an increased focus on irrigation techniques tailored to
    the

    speciﬁc needs of plant appears as one solution to minimize overall freshwater

    consumption. Precision irrigation methods seek to realize an acceptable

    compromise

    between

    yield

    and

    irrigation

    water consumption

    through

    control of the timing and quantity of water supplied to plants. The goal is to

    maintain the water content of the soil, achieve speciﬁc water use efﬁciency with

    regard to yield or maintain the physiological response of the plant to water

    stress within predetermined limits. Reliance on soil moisture measurements to

    establish irrigation water demand inadequately addresses heterogenous

    distribution of water in soil. Growing research interest is observed detailing

    the determination of plant water status directly from physiological responses.

    This paper reviews irrigation control approaches based on different plant water

    status assessment techniques. A distinct focus is made on application scale of

    the discussed control approaches, an aspect that has not been considered

    intensively enough in previous discussions of irrigation control approaches. A

    discussion of the observed strengths and shortcomings and technological

    advances supporting the various methods used to quantify plant water status

    extends the review. Emerging trends that are likely to have an impact on plant

    water status determination and optimal timing and quantiﬁcation of irrigation

    water requirements are integrated to show latest results. A peek into the future

    of precision irrigation foresees greater reliance on plant-based signals, both
    in

    characterization of the control variable, namely the plant water status, and in

    generation of controller outputs in terms of quantity and timing.

    1 Introduction

    As the world advances further into the 21st century, a rapidly

    growing global population continues to exert greater demand on

    agricultural food production (van Dijk et al., 2021). The effects of

    climate change provide an additional challenge to traditional

    rain- and reservoir-based crop production, making the case for

    use of irrigation either exclusively throughout the growing

    season, or as a supplement to natural precipitation (Wada

    et al., 2013; Rosa et al., 2020). Maintaining crop yields from

    the available land area, using a diminishing quantity of the

    required freshwater for irrigation is a delicate balancing act

    that has acted as a motivation for extensive research in

    precision irrigation approaches, with the overall goal of

    maximizing water use efﬁciency of irrigated crops, while

    simultaneously meeting the rising global food demand.

    While water treatment and desalination provide alternatives

    to cover the freshwater need, existing techniques are costly and

    energy intensive, particularly at low to medium scale (Arborea

    et al., 2017; Hagenvoort et al., 2019; Arena et al., 2020;

    Oubelkacem et al., 2020; Ofori et al., 2021). Concerns about

    the safety of treated wastewater, even with application of

    advanced treatment methods, have resulted in a call to more

    rigorous regulation and combination of treatment processes

    (Rizzo et al., 2020). Freshwater generation via atmospheric

    water harvesting (Tu et al., 2018; Lu et al., 2022) offers a

    novel, but energy intensive alternative which is currently

    limited to smaller production units (LaPotin et al., 2021). As a

    conclusion optimization of crop irrigation appears to be the most

    suitable solution to achieve a sustainable compromise between

    increasing freshwater demand for food production and the

    associated energy and environmental costs to realize adequate

    global food supply.

    In the history of mankind, adequate food production has

    been a fundamental requirement in the growth and advancement

    of human society. As early as 5000 BC, early agricultural

    civilizations in Egypt and Mesopotamia had come upon the

    idea of expanding the extent of arable land through use of

    irrigation, making use of the ﬂoodwaters of the Nile, Tigris,

    and Euphrates which was diverted into arable farmlands

    bordering the rivers through an extensive network of canals

    (Bazza, 2007). Through the use of intricate systems of canals,

    with later additions of reservoirs, dikes, and overﬂow canals,

    ﬂooding could be mitigated (Grenfell et al., 1900; Westermann,

    1919). Similar implementation of surface irrigation was also

    recorded in ancient China, Crete, India, and Persia (Biswas,

    1970). Irrigation control in this case was focused on direction

    of irrigation water to speciﬁc locations, regulation of irrigation

    duration and mitigation of ﬂooding. Surface irrigation methods

    involving use of ﬂooded basins, furrows, dykes, dams, and

    artiﬁcial reservoirs remain the predominant form of irrigation

    to date (Jägermeyr et al., 2015). Control methods aimed at more

    efﬁcient use of irrigation water have been targeted at regulating

    the timing, duration, and frequency of supply to the ﬁelds

    through control of gates, sluices, valves, and pumps.

    Introduction of new methods of water application to

    plants in the ﬁeld, namely through sprinklers and drip

    lines, provided new opportunities for more accurate control

    of irrigation water supply, allowing the regulation of water

    supply down to the individual plant level. These developments

    on the actuation side of irrigation have been accompanied by

    corresponding

    developments

    in

    sensing

    and

    control

    approaches.

    The incorporation of spatial variability in the management of

    irrigation is a key concept in distinguishing between traditional

    irrigation and precision irrigation (Sadler et al., 2005; Smith and

    Baillie, 2009). In Smith et al. (Smith et al., 2010), a distinction is

    made between traditional deﬁnitions of precision irrigation,

    which

    focus

    on

    maximizing

    efﬁciency

    through

    precise

    determination of volume, location and timing of irrigation,

    with uniform application over the entire system, and an

    updated deﬁnition that incorporates spatial and temporal

    variation in irrigation treatment. The focus is shifted from

    ﬁeld level to management zones within the ﬁeld (Gonzalez-

    Dugo et al., 2014; Fernández, 2017), or to individual plant

    level (Kizer et al., 2018; Klein et al., 2018). Camp et al.

    describe

    precision

    irrigation

    as

    “site-speciﬁc

    water

    management, speciﬁcally the application of water to a given

    site in a volume and at a time needed for optimum crop

    production, proﬁtability, or other management objectives at

    that speciﬁc site” (Camp et al., 2006). In this review, the

    supporting technologies are considered with regard to their

    ﬂexibility in allowing variable precision irrigation of individual

    plants or zones, rather than achieving efﬁciency through

    generation of uniform irrigation schedules.

    Traditional deﬁnitions of precision irrigation consider the

    “precise amount” of water to be applied to be the full amount of

    water required to meet the plant demand, which has commonly

    been determined based on the relationship between crop

    evapotranspiration and environmental factors (Morillo et al.,

    2015; Morales et al., 2016). Current irrigation practices that

    explore the cultivation of irrigated crops under regulated

    water deﬁcit provide a new Frontier for precision irrigation,

    where the required amount to be delivered is determined with a

    goal of avoiding irreversible water stress damage, without

    necessarily

    fully

    matching

    evapotranspiration-based

    plant

    demands. This provides further avenues for improvement of

    water use efﬁciency. Deﬁcit irrigation-based applications of

    precision irrigation approaches have been employed in control

    of both pre- and post-harvest yield quality (Pérez-Pastor et al.,

    2007; Lipan et al., 2019; Venturi et al., 2021). The observed effect

    of deﬁcit irrigation approaches on crop maturation (Zegbe-

    Domínguez et al., 2003; Cui et al., 2008) is an additional

    research target, with the possibility to enhance economic

    outcomes for the farmer by matching harvest timing to

    periods of greatest market demand. In this review, precision

    irrigation control approaches incorporating regulated water

    deﬁcit are emphasized.

    This

    review

    similarly

    provide

    a

    comprehensive

    summary of monitoring, control, and actuation approaches

    applied in precision irrigation control. Additionally, the

    implementability of deﬁcit irrigation-based strategies for

    increased water use efﬁciency is addressed, allowing the

    extension of achievable water savings thus contributing to

    sustainable expansion of global food production without

    exhausting available freshwater resources.

    2 Precision irrigation control

    approaches

    Control techniques are broadly classiﬁed as open or closed

    loop, deﬁning the existence of any kind of calculated or otherwise

    technically realized feedback (output to the input of the system

    considered). Open loop precision irrigation control relies on an

    accurate understanding (in the best case: a model) of plant water

    requirements, while closed loop methods include sensing

    mechanisms to dynamically adjust the control input to the

    irrigation system based on measured values.

    The performance of precision irrigation control approaches

    depends on the deﬁnition of plant water requirements. The

    characterization of plant water demand and the subsequent

    responses to the water application is described in Kögler

    (Kögler and Söffker, 2017) along a soil-plant-atmosphere

    continuum.

    This

    paper

    similarly

    groups

    approaches

    in

    precision

    irrigation

    into

    soil-based,

    plant-based,

    and

    atmosphere-based approaches. Further distinction is made

    between approaches targeted at enhancing precise delivery at

    ﬁeld level, within irrigation management zones and at individual

    plant level.

    2.1 Soil-based approaches

    Growing plants obtain water required for their growth from

    the soil. The soil moisture content has therefore been applied as a

    measure of the water status of the plant, with a plant-speciﬁc

    lower limit describing the minimum moisture content required

    to maintain the plant above wilting point (Briggs and Shantz,

    1911) and a soil-speciﬁc maximum water holding capacity, also

    referred to as the ﬁeld capacity (Veihmeyer and Hendrickson,

    1931). The main goal of traditional irrigation methods is to

    maintain soil moisture content at ﬁeld capacity during the

    growth phases, with scheduling of irrigation events based on

    plant growth models such as FAO Aquacrop (Steduto et al., 2009)

    or multivariable models simulating soil moisture, plant growth,

    and evapotranspiration such as DSSAT (Hoogenboom et al.,

    2019).

    Model-based predictive control approaches applied in

    precision irrigation allow the integration of soil moisture

    models

    in

    a

    predictive

    control

    scheme,

    which

    allows

    forecasting of moisture content and update of control actions

    based on measured variables. Spatial and temporal variability is

    accounted for using regression models (Hedley C. and Yule I.,

    2009), a predictive model with weekly measurement-based

    updates performing online optimization (Nahar et al., 2019),

    employment of Kalman ﬁlters (Roy, 2014), and application of

    deep belief networks and macroscopic cellular automata, with

    dynamic environmental measurements providing additional data

    for prediction (Song et al., 2016).

    The learning capabilities of neural networks allows the

    adaptation of plant growth models for the design of precision

    irrigation controllers. Speciﬁc neural-network based approaches

    allow online updating of control decisions based on measured

    real-time conditions, resulting in more accurate behavior. These

    capabilities are utilized by Capraro et al. (Capraro et al., 2008) in

    the development of an adaptive closed loop controller that allows

    for

    modiﬁcation

    of

    control

    actions

    when

    environmental

    perturbations such as rainfall or extreme temperatures cause a

    change in irrigation requirements. Long short term memory

    neural networks are employed for prediction of soil moisture

    content (Adeyemi et al., 2018) or soil matric potential Jimenez

    et al. (2020) with varying performance, both in terms of water

    savings and prediction accuracy. These are attributed to soil

    characteristics and duration of the prediction window. Difference

    in performance of neural network-based predictive models are

    also reported by (Gu et al., 2021), with larger estimation errors

    observed at lower soil moisture content levels, affecting

    performance of the precision irrigation scheduling system.

    A major challenge in the use of model-based methods for

    precision irrigation is that the control performance is limited by

    the accuracy of prediction or estimation achieved by the model.

    Incorporation of soil moisture data into irrigation management

    decisions offers a signiﬁcant performance improvement in soil-

    based precision irrigation approaches. Sensor readings have been

    used to calibrate and reﬁne model output, as described in (Tseng

    et al., 2018), where soil moisture measurements are used in

    labelling images acquired from an unmanned aerial vehicle for

    training a deep learning-based predictive algorithm. Conversely,

    application of predictive models can be integrated in sensor-

    based control approaches to reduce the quantity of sensor

    readings required to make an accurate assessment of soil

    water content, as proposed in (De Benedetto et al., 2013b)

    and (Andugula et al., 2017).

    10.3389/fcteg.2022.982463

    Soil-based closed loop control methods integrate soil

    moisture measurements in the control loop. On/off switching

    algorithms triggered by designated soil moisture sensors with

    preset static thresholds have been employed in precision

    irrigation control by Xiao et al. (Xiao et al., 2010). Use of

    dynamic switching thresholds allows real-time response to

    ﬁeld

    conditions,

    with

    the

    adaptation

    of

    the

    thresholds

    accomplished in Capraro et al. (Capraro et al., 2008) by

    neural networks, and numerical simulation employed by Egea

    et al. (Egea et al., 2017). An alternative approach involves

    placement of sensors at varying depths to track inﬁltration

    rate, allowing anticipatory switching (Benzekri and Refouﬁ,

    2006; Zhao et al., 2007; Liu and Xu, 2018).

    Development of a large variety of soil moisture sensors with

    greater accuracy and reliability has facilitated the precision

    control of irrigation based on real-time conditions. A major

    challenge to implementation of sensor-based control approaches

    has been the unit cost of sensors, which limits the economic

    viability of ﬁeld scale application of appropriately accurate and

    precise sensors. New low-cost soil moisture sensors have been

    developed in recent times based on sensing approaches

    commonly used in commercially available sensors, including

    frequency domain reﬂectometry (FDR) (Xiao et al., 2010),

    time

    domain

    reﬂectometry

    (TDR)

    (Wei

    et

    al.,

    2013),

    impedance

    spectroscopy

    (Umar

    and

    Setiadi,

    2015),

    and

    capacitance-based methods (Kojima et al., 2016; Gao et al.,

    2018). Novel approaches in the measurement of soil moisture

    content have also been developed in recent times, such as a time-

    domain multiplexing approach described in Saeed et al. (Saeed

    et al., 2019) and a high frequency double-resonance tuning

    approach developed by Qinglan et al. (Qinglan et al., 2020).

    Ding and Chandra introduce a Wi-Fi-based measurement

    system that relies on radio-frequency propagation (Ding and

    Chandra, 2019). Development of more precise calibration

    techniques and incorporation of fault detection mechanisms

    generates an opportunity for improvement of measurement

    accuracy and ﬂexibility of application in both novel and

    existing soil moisture sensors (Oates et al., 2016; Chen L.

    et al., 2019; González-Teruel et al., 2019; Nagahage et al.,

    2019). Additionally, dynamically variable irrigation thresholds

    based on plant growth requirements can be incorporated through

    calibration based on plant measurements. This is employed in

    Lou et al. (Lou et al., 2016) to generate a set of soil potential

    thresholds that allows precision irrigation through different plant

    growth stages.

    Location and distribution of moisture sensors within the ﬁeld

    has traditionally relied on expert knowledge from manufacturers

    or farmers. Approaches for optimizing the spatial distribution of

    soil moisture sensors for improved mapping of water content

    include use of clay percentile (Zhao W. et al., 2017), analysis of

    soil elevation maps combined with measurement of electrical

    conductivity (Adamchuk et al., 2010), and application of graph-

    theoretical methods (Roy, 2014).

    Field level precision irrigation based on soil moisture content

    relies on accurately modeling and/or measurement of soil water

    dynamics, incorporating the effects of precipitation, irrigation,

    leaching, run-off, and drainage to establish the moisture available

    within the root zone of the plant. Precision irrigation control

    approaches are therefore employed primarily to address accuracy

    of moisture content measurement and monitoring, and the

    scheduling the timing and quantity of ﬁeld-level irrigation

    events. Remote sensing techniques capable of extracting soil

    moisture characteristics with increasing precision and more

    frequent intervals is a key factor in the further development

    of soil-based precision irrigation at ﬁeld level. Electromagnetic

    surveys have been applied in (Hedley et al., 2013) to assess the

    spatio-temporal dynamics of soil moisture and water table depth

    for precision irrigation control. Satellite data are also used to

    determine the soil water index, which is used as an indicator of

    soil moisture content (Termite et al., 2019).

    Zone level precision irrigation relies on accurate demarcation

    of the ﬁeld into homogeneous management zones based on

    physical and chemical characteristics of the soil (Bazzi et al.,

    2018; de Lara et al., 2018; Chen S. et al., 2019). Integration of

    plant-related

    measurements

    to

    complement

    soil

    sensor

    measurements has been explored in (Rojo et al., 2016; Ortuani

    et al., 2019; Vera et al., 2019; Serrano et al., 2020) for better zone

    delineation as a means to increasing irrigation efﬁciency. Recent

    research investigates the adoption of Bayesian maximum entropy

    (Han et al., 2020) and clustering approaches (Haghverdi et al.,

    2015; Oldoni and Bassoi, 2016; Ohana-Levi et al., 2019; Javadi

    et al., 2022) for achievement of optional zoning. To address

    challenges arising from static management zone delineation

    based on spatial characterization, dynamic determination of

    zone boundaries has been explored with integration of real-

    time soil and plant sensor measurements (Scudiero et al.,

    2018;

    Fontanet

    et

    al.,

    2020)

    or

    use

    of

    deep

    learning

    approaches (Song et al., 2016).

    With regard to the current status of soil-based precision

    irrigation control approaches summarized in Table 1, it can be

    stated that the maintenance of soil moisture level between a user-

    deﬁned lower boundary related to the wilting point and an upper

    boundary deﬁned by the soil water capacity has been employed as

    the basis for control decisions. Challenges related to soil water

    dynamics arising from inherent hydraulic characteristics or

    changes in the spatial envelope deﬁning root-available water

    have been addressed. Optimization of location and distribution

    of soil moisture sensors to allow accurate mapping of soil

    moisture distribution while minimizing the required number

    of sensors is a potential area for further work in the

    implementation

    of

    sensor-supported

    soil-based

    precision

    irrigation control. Variations in the upper soil moisture

    boundary during scheduling of irrigation quantity has not

    been

    considered

    in

    literature,

    signifying

    a

    gap

    in

    the

    application of soil-based precision irrigation methods to

    deﬁcit irrigation strategies. Additionally, a signiﬁcant gap

    exists in soil-based approaches applied at individual plant level.

    Advancements in the ﬁeld of wireless sensor networks, remote

    sensing and machine learning approaches are expected to drive

    future developments in soil-based precision irrigation control,

    allowing for more localized decision support systems and greater

    adaptability to individual plant water requirements.

    2.2 Atmosphere-based approaches

    Atmosphere-based precision irrigation control approaches

    involve balancing the water supplied to the plant with the water

    released

    to

    the

    atmosphere

    through

    evapotranspiration.

    Achievement of the high accuracy required in precision

    irrigation

    is

    either

    accomplished

    by

    reﬁning

    evapotranspiration models for use in open loop control or by

    incorporation of sensor feedback in closed loop control.

    Common models of evapotranspiration incorporated into

    precision irrigation include FAO’s Penman-Monteith model

    (Allen, 1998; Fourati et al., 2014; Robinson et al., 2017;

    Pereira

    et

    al.,

    2020),

    the

    Hargreaves-Samani

    model

    (Hargreaves and Samani, 1985; Gordin et al., 2019; Pelosi

    et al., 2019; Domínguez-Niño et al., 2020) and the Surface

    Energy Balance model (SEBAL) (Bastiaanssen et al., 1998;

    Gobbo

    et

    al.,

    2019).

    Both

    the

    Penman-Monteith

    and

    Hargreaves-Samani models generate an estimated reference

    evapotranspiration rate, which is multiplied by a crop-speciﬁc

    coefﬁcient to predict the actual evapotranspiration rate of the

    crop.

    The

    Hargreaves-Samani

    model

    provides

    a

    simpler

    approach due to its ability to provide an estimate based solely

    on temperature values, as compared to the Penman-Monteith

    approach, where several environmental, geographic and soil-

    related variables are required. Better temporal stability in

    evapotranspiration prediction accuracy using the Hargreaves-

    Samani approach has also been reported in (Lorite et al., 2015),

    making it a more reliable option for control approaches

    integrating longer prediction windows. The SEBAL approach

    directly computes the actual evapotranspiration rate from

    thermal imagery without requiring speciﬁc soil- or crop-

    related coefﬁcients, making it more readily applicable to new

    or inadequately researched crop varieties for which physiological

    coefﬁcients are yet to be established.

    Machine learning approaches have more recently been

    applied in estimation of evapotranspiration, and hence plant

    water requirements, based on weather data (Sidhu et al., 2020;

    Farooque et al., 2021). Linker et al. use temperature forecasts to

    estimate evapotranspiration values, which are applied in

    precision scheduling of irrigation to achieve targeted optimal

    combinations of yield and irrigation amount selected by the

    farmer (Linker et al., 2018). Estimation of evapotranspiration

    using remote sensing data is employed in Barker et al. (Barker

    et al., 2018) for variable rate irrigation control. In Ma et al., the

    Root Zone Water Quality Model is calibrated using lysimeter

    measurements for estimation of plant evapotranspiration, which

    is then applied in irrigation scheduling (Ma et al., 2017). The

    authors suggest further improvement of irrigation scheduling by

    inclusion of weather forecasting data. Improvements in water use

    efﬁciency are observed in this case. However, due to the

    implementation

    of

    an

    open-loop

    control,

    real-time

    evapotranspiration values play no role in the decision-making,

    making the system susceptible to environmental variations. For

    greenhouse-based applications (Incrocci et al., 2014), developed a

    data-driven evapotranspiration model for precision irrigation

    control, achieving a 45% reduction in seasonal water use.

    An

    alternative

    atmospheric-based

    approach

    relies

    on

    prediction of precipitation rather than evapotranspiration

    (Roy,

    2014;

    Tsakmakis

    et

    al.,

    2016).

    Roy

    introduces

    a

    stochastic

    weather

    forecasting

    module

    for

    predicting

    precipitation (Roy, 2014) using publicly available weather

    forecasts. Tsakmakis et al. use a weather prognostics model

    based on the air pollution model (Hurley, 2005), which

    predicts

    precipitation

    by

    solving

    given

    scalar

    equations.

    Irrigation scheduling is adjusted based on predicted timing

    and quantities of precipitation.

    Hybrid approaches combining ET estimation with soil

    moisture sensing (Lozoya et al., 2016; Nocco et al., 2019;

    Bhatti et al., 2020) or plant-based methods (Tsakmakis et al.,

    2016; Gobbo et al., 2019) have also been used to achieve greater

    accuracy

    in

    precision

    irrigation

    control.

    These

    allow

    compensation

    of

    weather-related

    disturbances

    to

    the

    evapotranspiration model by integrating the dynamic behavior

    of soil moisture or of the plant. However their reliability depends

    on the accuracy of crop coefﬁcients used in determination of

    actual evapotranspiration.

    A major challenge in atmospheric-based precision irrigation

    approaches arises from the difﬁculty in differentiating between

    evaporation (from the soil surface) and transpiration (from the

    plants), requiring dynamic adjustment of irrigation control

    algorithms as plant cover increases during the growth season.

    A recent approach described by Chen et al. (Chen et al., 2020)

    involves the partitioning of evapotranspiration values into its two

    components through machine learning techniques. This could

    provide a key to achieving greater accuracy in precision irrigation

    control, allowing the focusing of water delivery to meet actual

    plant demand rather than maintaining constant soil moisture

    levels, including in areas where no plant growth is present. A

    summary of existing atmosphere-based control approaches is

    provided in Table 2.

    2.3 Plant-based approaches

    To alleviate the gaps inherent in soil-based and atmospheric-

    based precision control approaches, plant-based precision

    irrigation control has been widely seen as the best approach

    in accurately determining and meeting plant water requirements

    (Jones, 2004). The timing and quantity of irrigation is based on

    the plant physiological response to lack of water, which results in

    changes in leaf surface temperature, water potential, or turgor

    (Ayars and Phene, 2007).

    Canopy temperature-based crop water stress indices (CWSI),

    both based on theoretical (Idso et al., 1981) and experimental

    models (Jackson et al., 1981) have been employed in irrigation

    scheduling since the early 1980s. Due to their reliance on canopy

    temperature measurements taken at a speciﬁc time of day

    (typically midday), they are constrained in their adaptability

    to dynamically varying stress conditions. Applications of

    CWSI

    in

    precision

    irrigation

    control

    are

    described

    in

    O’Shaughnessy et al. (O’Shaughnessy et al., 2012b), where a

    cumulative

    time

    threshold

    is

    incorporated

    in

    the

    determination of irrigation timing, and in Osroosh et al.

    (Osroosh

    et

    al.,

    2015),

    where

    a

    dynamic

    threshold

    is

    implemented to account for changes in water stress thresholds

    at different growing stages. A recent approach described by

    Andrade et al. (Andrade et al., 2018) is the implementation of

    machine learning algorithms for forecasting of crop water stress

    indices based on historic data.

    Advancements in canopy temperature measurements have

    contributed greatly to the development of plant-based precision

    irrigation approaches. High resolution satellite thermal images

    have been used for mapping of plant water stress levels for site-

    speciﬁc irrigation scheduling, with the capability to replace

    locally obtained leaf water potential (LWP) measurements

    (Meron et al., 2010). At a local level, thermal imagery

    obtained from unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) (Gonzalez-

    Dugo et al., 2013; Martínez et al., 2016; Matese et al., 2018) or

    all-terrain vehicles moving within the irrigated ﬁeld (Gutiérrez

    et al., 2018) has been used in mapping of plant water

    requirements for generation of irrigation management zones.

    At plant level, surface temperature sensors mounted on

    individual leaves have been applied to allow continuous

    monitoring of stress status (Rojo et al., 2016; Kizer et al., 2018).

    Determination of plant water status by measurement of water

    potential in a pressure chamber was ﬁrst described by Dixon and

    Joly in 1895 (Dixon and Joly, 1895). Various approaches have

    been developed for determination of water potential, with

    measurements taken either from the leaves or from the stem

    (SWP). Water potential measurement is done either directly on

    the plant (Mirás-Avalos et al., 2016; Blanco-Cipollone et al.,

    2017) or estimated from multispectral imagery (Baluja et al.,

    2012; Zhao T. et al., 2017; Beeri et al., 2018; Helman et al., 2018;

    Tung et al., 2018). Precision irrigation control approaches based

    on use of plant water potential-based thresholds for triggering of

    irrigation events are described by (Acevedo-Opazo et al., 2010;

    Bellvert et al., 2015; Mirás-Avalos et al., 2016) and (Ruiz-

    Sánchez et al., 2018). The application of machine learning

    approaches enables integration of historical water potential

    measurements

    to

    predict

    spatial

    variations

    in

    water

    requirements, as described in (Pôças et al., 2020). An

    alternative method

    involves the use of

    water potential

    thresholds

    as

    the

    standard

    for

    calibration

    of

    other

    measurement approaches, such as trunk diameter shrinkage

    and growth rate (Livellara et al., 2011). Near infra-red

    spectroscopy

    measurements

    have

    also

    been

    applied

    in

    precision irrigation control, as described by (Diago et al., 2018).

    Water is required for the maintenance of turgor pressure

    in plants. Plant water status can therefore be monitored or

    measured through measurement of turgor. Developments

    related

    to

    leaf

    turgor

    measurements

    and

    potential

    application

    in

    precision

    irrigation

    are

    described

    in

    (Martínez-Gimeno et al., 2016; Rodriguez-Dominguez et al.,

    2019). A novel approach employing ultrasonic sensing

    techniques for determination of leaf water content as

    related to turgor pressure is described in (Álvarez-Arenas

    et

    al.,

    2016),

    allowing

    for

    non-contact

    application

    of

    turgor-based precision irrigation control.

    Other emerging methods of assessing plant water status that

    could provide useful feedback for precision irrigation control

    include measurement of leaf thickness (Seelig et al., 2011), trunk

    diameter (Conejero et al., 2011; Meng et al., 2017), leaf reﬂectance

    (Katsoulas et al., 2016) and various applications of image analysis

    (Hendrawan and Murase, 2009; Chen et al., 2018; Mateo-Aroca

    et al., 2019; Xu et al., 2020). The demarcation of irrigation

    management zones based on plant-based sensors is also a

    potential area of exploration (Bazzi et al., 2018), allowing the

    realization of zone-based irrigation control that better matches

    the plant water requirements.

    In general, while plant-based approaches (summarized in

    Table 3) provide the closest match to plant water requirements,

    there still exist open questions regarding the determination of

    appropriate

    irrigation

    quantity,

    the

    distinguishing

    of

    physiological responses to water stress from other stresses,

    and the dynamic adaptation of irrigation control to account

    for physiological coping mechanisms employed by plants in

    response to water stress.

    The interaction between the soil, plant and atmosphere

    provides a broad spectrum of combinations for precision

    irrigation control approaches. Selection of a suitable approach

    depends

    on

    the

    speciﬁc

    soil,

    plant

    and

    environmental

    characteristics under consideration, as well as the desired scale

    of application. While signiﬁcant progress has been made in

    development of ﬁeld-level and zone-based precision irrigation

    applications using all three approaches, there remains a

    signiﬁcant gap in plant-level precision irrigation control,

    which has the potential to further improve the efﬁciency of

    irrigation water supply to meet actual plant demand.

    3 Advances in precision irrigation

    The development of precision irrigation control has beneﬁted

    from technological advances in various ﬁelds. In this section, the

    technological advances contributing to precision irrigation

    control are discussed under three main categories: sensor

    development and data acquisition, data processing and control

    approaches, and actuating devices. Speciﬁc elements of Industry

    4.0 are directly addressed in each section.

    3.1 Advances in sensing

    3.1.1 Remote sensing

    Greater availability of satellite data has provided a signiﬁcant

    boost to integration of remote sensor data in precision irrigation

    applications. The soil moisture and ocean salinity (SMOS)

    satellite (Kerr et al., 2010) launched by the European Space

    Agency and the soil moisture active and passive (SMAP)

    (Entekhabi et al., 2010) satellite by NASA have in particular

    been

    instrumental

    in

    furthering

    research

    on

    remote

    measurement and monitoring of soil water content. Drought

    assessment using soil water deﬁcit indices derived from SMOS

    Martínez-Fernández et al. (2016) and SMAP (Zhu et al., 2019)

    enables the tracking of changes in soil moisture content over

    time, enabling precision irrigation management. In (Brocca et al.,

    2018), satellite data are used to quantify amount of irrigation

    water supplied at various sites, demonstrating the potential of

    applying remote sensing data to monitoring and control tasks

    associated

    with

    precision

    irrigation.

    The

    challenge

    of

    downscaling regional scale satellite data for local application,

    such as in precision irrigation, is presented in (Peng et al., 2017),

    with a discussion of satellite-based, geoinformation-based, and

    model-base approaches. A key limitation of microwave satellites

    is that soil moisture information describes the surface condition

    rather

    than

    root

    zone

    characteristics.

    The

    Global

    Land

    Evaporation Amsterdam Model (GLEAM) (Martens et al.,

    2017) provides a set of algorithms allowing estimation of

    root-zone soil moisture and evaporation from satellite data,

    allowing for incorporation into precision irrigation strategies.

    Termite et al. (Termite et al., 2019) describe the harnessing of

    machine learning capabilities in analysis of satellite imagery to

    predict soil moisture dynamics for application in irrigation

    decision support systems.

    3.1.2 Wireless sensor networks

    Advancements in wireless sensor network technology have

    led to improved collection and analysis of sensor data for high

    resolution mapping of soil moisture (Zhao et al., 2007; Xiao

    et al., 2010; Hedley et al., 2013). Real-time communication

    between

    sensors,

    actuators,

    and

    human

    users

    is

    easily

    achievable

    over

    locally

    available

    telecommunications

    infrastructure and interfaces can be implemented on mobile

    hand-held devices (Işık et al., 2017). An expansion of sensor

    networking has seen the rise of Internet-of-Things-based

    sensing applied for monitoring of plant water requirements,

    whether via soil-based, atmosphere-based, or plant-based

    measurements (Vasisht et al., 2017; Goap et al., 2018; Munir

    et al., 2018). Integration of wireless sensor networks has also

    found

    application

    in

    dynamic

    delineation

    of

    irrigation

    management

    zones

    for

    zone-based

    precision

    irrigation

    control in Sapna et al. (Sapna et al., 2020).

    3.2 Advances in data processing and

    control

    3.2.1 Big data

    The vast quantities of data generated from networked sensors

    generate a need for expanded processing and storage capabilities.

    In this respect, cloud computing approaches provide a viable

    solution, ﬁnding application in monitoring of real-time irrigation

    status (López-Riquelme et al., 2017; Vaishali et al., 2017) and

    modeling of plant water requirements for soil-based (Raikar

    et al., 2018; Mezouari et al., 2020), plant-based (Roopaei et al.,

    2017), and atmosphere-based (Bendre et al., 2015) precision

    irrigation control approaches. Data analysis techniques applied

    on Big Data applications are also proving beneﬁcial in

    management of precision irrigation control systems (Zhang

    et al., 2017).

    3.2.2 Machine learning and artiﬁcial intelligence

    Machine learning involves generation of self-modifying

    or

    adapting

    algorithms

    whose

    performance

    accuracy

    increases

    with

    experience

    (Marsland,

    2014).

    Machine

    learning techniques have been crucial in development of

    dynamic

    control

    approaches

    through

    integration

    of

    learning capabilities. Applications in the area of precision

    irrigation are primarily in predictive modeling of soil

    moisture dynamics (Hinnell et al., 2010; Adeyemi et al.,

    2018) and optimized irrigation scheduling (Jimenez et al.,

    2018;

    Murthy

    et

    al.,

    2019).

    Recent

    research

    involves

    application of Machine learning algorithms to identify new

    parameters that can be employed in characterization of plant

    water content, primarily through image analysis (Hendrawan

    and Murase, 2009).

    3.2.3 Multi-agent systems

    Multi-agent systems expand the capabilities of artiﬁcial

    intelligence by introducing multiple autonomous intelligent

    agents capable of interacting with each other. Multi-agent

    systems have been employed in simulation of plant growth

    response

    to

    multiple

    irrigation

    strategies,

    allowing

    the

    selection

    of

    optimal

    precision

    irrigation

    approaches

    for

    speciﬁc conditions (Isern et al., 2012; Belaqziz et al., 2013;

    Zaryouli et al., 2020). With the incorporation of real-time

    sensed

    variables

    describing

    plant

    response

    to

    water

    application,

    multi-agent

    systems

    have

    additionally

    been

    proposed

    for

    dynamic

    tuning

    of

    irrigation

    scheduling

    algorithms (Villarrubia et al., 2017; Wanyama and Far, 2017;

    González-Briones et al., 2019), allowing for constant adaptation

    of water supply to plant needs. Further research in incorporation

    of artiﬁcial intelligence in plant-based precision irrigation control

    could be useful in enabling further individualization of plant

    water requirement estimation, resulting in precision irrigation

    control applications that more closely meet individual plant

    needs.

    An emerging ﬁeld in precision irrigation control is the

    modeling

    of

    irrigation-related

    parameters

    using

    hybrid

    automata.

    Here,

    plant,

    soil,

    and

    atmosphere-related

    parameters are modeled using ﬁnite state-machines, with

    individual

    states

    described

    using

    simple

    linear

    models,

    enabling the modeling and control of complex dynamic

    systems, as described in Lozoya et al. (Lozoya et al., 2019) and

    Jihin et al. (Jihin et al., 2019). Future work in this area would

    involve integration of the generated plant models in precision

    irrigation control algorithms, with the aim of predicting plant

    water

    requirements

    and

    adaptively

    adjusting

    irrigation

    scheduling based on plant response.

    3.3 Advances in actuation

    Delivery of irrigation water involves control of suitable

    individual or combinations of pumps, valves, gates, and drip

    lines through connected actuators in the form of motors,

    mechanisms, and/or linkages. To ensure that the required

    amount of irrigation water is delivered in a timely manner to

    the required location, improvements at the delivery end play a

    signiﬁcant role. A common unifying factor is uniform supply of

    irrigation water, with precision control approaches mainly

    concerned with on/off switching of actuators to accomplish

    scheduling and determine irrigation quantity.

    3.3.1 Variable rate irrigation

    The achievement of precision irrigation requires variable

    delivery of water to different locations, based on localized

    requirements. The development of variable rate irrigation is

    described in Mulla and Khosla (Mulla and Khosla, 2015) as

    one of the major contributors to the widespread adoption of

    precision agriculture. In variable rate irrigation, the amount of

    water delivered by individual nozzles or groups of nozzles is

    independently adjustable, allowing for delineation of a ﬁeld into

    different irrigation management zones. This is a widely used

    approach in cases where variations in scheduling or frequency of

    irrigation for different zones within the ﬁeld may not be desired.

    Implementation of variable rate irrigation has been achieved by a

    number of researchers through modiﬁcation of commercially

    Frontiers in Control Engineering

    available sprinkler irrigation systems to supply preset quantities

    of water under the control of a programmable system (McCann

    et al., 1997; Camp et al., 1998; Chávez et al., 2009) or

    development of new systems with variable rate irrigation

    capabilities (Han et al., 2009). With hardware capable of

    supplying different amounts of water, precision irrigation

    control is transformed into a zoning/mapping operation, with

    regions requiring similar quantities of irrigation water (based on

    soil properties or plant requirements) clustered together.

    Delineation

    of

    irrigation

    management

    zones

    has

    been

    accomplished through measurement of soil properties at

    different locations within the area under irrigation to generate

    databases that are used to determine location-speciﬁc irrigation

    settings (Hedley C. B. and Yule I. J., 2009; Chávez et al., 2009;

    Moral et al., 2010; Nahry et al., 2011; Liakos et al., 2015; Boluwade

    et al., 2016). Aggregation of on-site sensor measurements with

    satellite data to develop decision support and zone management

    systems for use in precision irrigation control is described by

    multiple researchers as well (Zhang et al., 2009; Jiang et al., 2011;

    De Benedetto et al., 2013a; Barker et al., 2018).

    applications. Such approaches, however, fail to respond to the

    dynamics of plant water requirements. Recent approaches

    incorporate plant-based measurements to dynamically update

    zoning maps generated from soil properties. O’Shaughnessy et al.

    use real-time plant water stress readings taken during irrigation

    events to dynamically update the zoning maps used for precision

    irrigation

    control

    (O’Shaughnessy

    et

    al.,

    2012a).

    In

    Goumopoulos et al., a wireless sensor network integrating

    measurements from soil, plant, and atmosphere is applied in

    generation of irrigation management zones and used for control

    of a wireless actuator network for precision irrigation within a

    greenhouse (Goumopoulos et al., 2014).

    3.3.2 Agricultural robots

    Introduction of robotic agents in automation of irrigation

    water delivery is an emerging area of research interest. With

    appropriate path planning and ﬁeld preparation, greater

    ﬂexibility in geographical location of irrigation heads is

    achievable, and the role of such robots is easily expandable to

    include multiple functions, such as sensing of soil and plant

    characteristics, collection of samples, and delivery of agricultural

    chemicals. Jafari et al. introduce an autonomously guided vehicle

    for relocation of sprinkler heads within an irrigated ﬁeld (Jafari

    et al., 2013). The replacement of manual labour with robotic

    actuation improves on accuracy and speed of irrigation, as well as

    minimizes wastage of water. Gealy et al. develop a hand-held

    robotic device used for ﬁne-tuning emitter settings in a modiﬁed

    drip irrigation system (Gealy et al., 2016). Water delivery can be

    set to match individual plant requirements by adjustment of ﬂow

    settings at each emitter. Thayer et al. introduce a routing

    algorithm to allow a similar robotic device for precision

    adjustment of emitter settings to operate autonomously within

    a vineyard (Thayer et al., 2018). Developments in collaborative

    robotics provide further opportunities for integration of robotic

    actuation in precision irrigation. Dusadeerungsikul et al.

    (Dusadeerungsikul et al., 2019) discuss the development of a

    collaborative control protocol which integrates robotic agents

    into a smart greenhouse to create a cyber-physical system that

    includes human and robotic agents. The described system

    primarily

    serves

    a

    monitoring

    and

    detection

    role

    with

    response provided by human operators. The system however

    is an indicator of the potential application of collaborative robots

    in a precision irrigation scenario, whether in sensing or actuation.

    Current research involving collaborating robotic ﬂeets,

    otherwise described as swarm robotics, is an emerging area of

    interest that could further inﬂuence future developments in

    precision irrigation control. The scalability, ﬂexibility, and

    robustness in solution of complex tasks could be employed in

    tailoring precision control decisions to allow more individually

    adapted irrigation on larger scale (Albani et al., 2017). This is

    facilitated by having specialized functions distributed among a

    larger number of robots, which can then be deployed as and when

    needed with coordinated communication (Emmi et al., 2014). Of

    particular interest are swarms composed of aerial and ground

    robots, which could integrate airborne sensing capabilities with

    ground-based application tasks, allowing real-time, closed-loop

    precision irrigation control (Grassi et al., 2017; Vu et al., 2017;

    Potena et al., 2019).

    4 Challenges and opportunities

    Irrigation

    control

    has

    primarily

    been

    targeted

    at

    minimization of water consumption at the expense of yield, or

    maximization of yield at the expense of water consumption.

    Research on the effect of targeted water stress during speciﬁc

    growth periods however indicates that it is possible to achieve

    equivalent

    or

    even

    greater

    yield

    while

    reducing

    water

    consumption

    through

    strategic

    alternation

    of

    moderate

    drought stress and recovery periods (Blum et al., 1990; Cui

    et al., 2009; Niu et al., 2018). With the ongoing depletion of

    global freshwater supplies, minimization of water consumption

    will remain an overarching target of precision irrigation, with

    advancements in technology increasingly targeting more efﬁcient

    use of every applied drop of water. An emerging Frontier that

    presents interesting research questions is the individualized

    direct control of plant growth and development by targeted

    application of environmental stresses, such as is accomplished

    through deﬁcit irrigation. This has been suggested in various

    research works (Hunt and Nicholls, 1986; Kang and Wang, 2017;

    Sánchez-Blanco et al., 2019). Kögler and Söffker compare such

    targeted growth control based on precise irrigation sequencing to

    sports training (Kögler and Söffker, 2020). Development of more

    10.3389/fcteg.2022.982463

    efﬁcient precision irrigation technology and more accurate

    models representing the complex relationship between plant

    growth and irrigation water supply is necessary to achieve

    this. More direct targeting of irrigation application to the

    speciﬁc plants that require it, with quantity and timing

    selected to just avoid the region of drought stress within

    which physiological damage or yield reduction occurs, could

    result in signiﬁcant water savings and more reliable projection of

    irrigation water use throughout the growing season.

    Integration of networking and remote access into precision

    irrigation solutions has led to a new set of challenges related to

    data security. Wireless sensor networks, Internet-of-Things

    enabled devices, and cloud-based systems can be particularly

    vulnerable to cyber security threats such as distributed denial of

    service (DDoS) attacks, integration into malicious botnets

    (Antonakakis et al., 2017) and exploitation by ransomware

    creators. This creates an additional layer of considerations to

    be included in design of precision irrigation control systems.

    Legal challenges stemming from ambiguity in regulatory

    frameworks governing implementation of new technology

    could be a setback in some precision irrigation applications,

    such as those involving robotic actors and artiﬁcial intelligence.

    Progress has been made in enacting legislation to govern

    operation of unmanned aerial vehicles within the European

    Union

    (European

    Commission,

    Directorate-General

    for

    Mobility

    and

    Transport,

    2019a;

    European

    Commission,

    Directorate-General for Mobility and Transport, 2019b). Social

    and ethical issues stemming from implementation of artiﬁcial

    intelligence and autonomous robotic agents are also a cause of

    concern,

    with

    questions

    arising

    regarding

    data

    privacy,

    accountability in decisions involving human interaction and

    accessibility of criteria applied in decision-making (Müller,

    2020).

    Despite existing challenges, a wealth of opportunities

    abounds in precision irrigation research and implementation.

    Recent advances in high resolution remote sensing technology

    could also play an important role in precision irrigation. In

    particular, the use of satellite data to infer soil moisture is

    particularly practicable in introduction of precision irrigation

    principles in decision support systems for large scale irrigation

    platforms. Termite et al. apply machine learning techniques to

    infer soil moisture status from satellite imagery, providing crucial

    information for irrigation management at a municipality level

    (Termite et al., 2019).

    Further opportunities exist in application of cloud-based data

    storage and processing, allowing for reduction in setup and

    FIGURE 1

    Agriculture 4.0- The future of precision irrigation control, with cloud-based
    data storage and processing, real-time communication between

    plant-based sensors, intelligent agents (including robots), supported by weather
    data and market analytics.

    Frontiers in Control Engineering

    operational costs through remote sharing of data and processing

    power. Enhanced accumulation of soil, plant, and environmental

    data facilitated by networked devices expands available agricultural

    data from which new models and control approaches can be

    generated and tested. On the actuation front, assistive technologies

    such as subsurface water retention technology (SWRT) (Roy et al.,

    2019), which uses an impermeable membrane to extend the

    duration of water availability to plants, could be integrated into

    precision irrigation scheduling approaches.

    What then, does the future hold for precision irrigation

    control? The incorporation of elements of Industry 4.0 in

    agricultural applications (also referred to as Agriculture 4.0)

    provides a guiding framework (see Figure 1). Plant-level

    sensors would give individual plants or plant monitoring units

    the ability to communicate their needs in real time. This

    information would be collected and processed in real time in

    an interconnected network of devices and agents. Artiﬁcial

    intelligence would then interpret the collected data and

    combine

    it

    with

    accurate,

    dynamic

    growth

    models

    encompassing speciﬁc scenarios with regard to exactly how

    much water should be consumed during the entire growth

    season, what yield is to be produced from each sector, by

    which

    date

    the

    crops

    should

    be

    arriving

    at

    speciﬁc

    developmental stages (including targeted harvest dates), and

    employing

    additional

    soil-speciﬁc

    and

    weather-speciﬁc

    information to tailor the prescription to each ﬁeld, growing

    season, and set of user preferences. A robust, adaptable

    controller would then generate a database containing the

    speciﬁc irrigation needs of each individual, and delivery of

    water would be implemented by opening of irrigation valves

    at the individual plant level, activated either remotely from a

    cloud-connected platform, or on site by swarms of mobile robots,

    each responsible for speciﬁc zones within the ﬁeld. After all, the

    best-placed entity to answer the question “how much water is too

    much water” is the individual plant, communicating its needs in

    real time and determining when it wishes to be watered, how

    much water it requires, and how much thirst it can take before

    compromising the ﬁnal expected yield.

    of this study was to enable cultivating St. John''s wort not only in Europe and
    West Asia, but also in Thailand, Southeast Asia despite warmer climate than in
    the natural growth regions. The challenge then was to control environmental factors

    Moreover, data analysis by multiple linear regression was applied to enable the
    control of the designed greenhouse environment. It was used to discover interesting
    relationships between variables. The proposed system was implemented with hardware,
    a web application, and a mobile application. The hardware was designed to collect
    data and implement control of air temperature, air relative humidity, soil moisture,
    and light from sensors in the field. The web and mobile applications were developed
    to manipulate the obtained data, for intelligent control, and for real-time monitoring
    of environmental factors. The control system included an evaporative cooling system,
    fogging system, irrigation system, and artificial light system. The results show
    that the proposed system to assist and support the growth of St. John''s wort
    was successful. Moreover, the results from this research can be used to culture
    St. John''s wort, in order to produce medicines that are beneficial to human health

    St. John’s wort (Hypericum perforatum L.) is a perennial herb that is grown in
    the comparatively cold regions of Europe and West Asia. It has been used in medicine
    to treat various diseases [1]–[6], such as mild to moderate depression, inflammation,
    and to assist in wound healing [7]. Moreover, it potentially has anticancer, antimicrobial
    and antiviral activities [8]. Due to the valuable medicinal properties, this plant
    should be cultured more widely, even in the tropical areas. This is the challenge
    requiring control of the environmental factors affecting growth of St. John’s
    wort. The Internet of Things (IoT) is a modern opportunity in implementing such
    control. In the past few years, IoT has begun to play an important role in everyday
    life [9], [10]. Applications of IoT have been reported in industry, health, environment,
    and agriculture [11]–[13]. It supports collecting large amounts of data and control
    of various devices. In the agricultural sector, intelligent greenhouses with controlled
    environment are becoming popular because IoT can both monitor and control factors
    that influence plant growth and yield [14]. The data can also be used to determine
    the appropriate time of harvest, or to detect disease conditions [15]. Regarding
    cultivation of St. John’s wort, it requires suitable environmental factors and
    weather. In practice no prior implementation using IoT for growing St. John’s
    wort has been reported. Thus, this work applied IoT in the control environmental
    factors. For model based control, data analysis by Multiple Linear Regression
    (MLR) was applied to the designed greenhouse environment. MLR is used to find
    useful information and to discover interesting relationships between variables
    in big data. It helps to analyze and build relationships between the characteristics
    of agricultural data, support scientific decisions, and these can facilitate increasing
    productivity and efficiency in agricultural production [15]–[17]. This leads to
    the creation of intelligent farm systems that use information obtained via IoT
    for farm management, disease control planning, production planning and control
    of the growth environment within the farm [18]. Thus, in this work control of
    a designed greenhouse is accessed via developed web and mobile applications. Moreover,
    the applications can predict the air temperature in the greenhouse by from IoT
    networked information. As a case study, St. John’s wort was grown in the greenhouse
    on PSU farm, Prince of Songkla University, Surat Thani Campus, Thailand. The annual
    average temperature in this region is 33.25 °C [19]. IoT is used to control environmental
    factors and to collect data on environmental factors in the greenhouse. One factor
    that affects plant growth is temperature, and it must be in the proper range.
    At the same time, the changing outside environment affects the temperature inside
    the greenhouse, so it is necessary to have a temperature prediction to prepare
    for temperature changes and avoid damage to the plants. This study, therefore,
    developed a temperature prediction model in the greenhouse from the environmental
    factors both inside and outside the greenhouse, by using MLR. This article is
    organized as follows: Section 2 discusses data background, Section 3 discusses
    related work, Section 4 presents the proposed system and agricultural data analysis,
    Section 5 has results and discussion, and finally, Section 6 concludes the article.
    SECTION II. Background A. St. John’s Wort St. John’s wort (Hypericum perforatum)
    is a herb native to Europe and Western Asia. St. John’s wort has been used already
    in ancient Greece because of its many medicinal properties, and is used for the
    treatment of depression, kidney disease, lung disease, Trigeminal neuralgia, inflammation,
    and wound healing [6], [20], [21]. In recent studies, St.John’s wort has been
    reported to outperform other antidepressants, and it may be effective against
    cancer, as well as antimicrobial and antiviral. There is pharmacological evidence
    that this plant may have psychotherapeutic activity. There are thorough examinations
    of GABA binding [22]. In 1998, the market value of St. John’s wort exceeded US
    210millionintheUSalone,andwasUS 570 million worldwide [7]. For this reason, many
    attempts have been made to improve and explore the active ingredients in this
    plant [6], [21]. One approach to enhance the efficacy of St. John’s wort is to
    seek the right growth conditions. The environmental factors affecting the growth
    and hypericin concentrations in St. John’s wort include light intensity, C O 2
    concentration, and weather conditions that can alter metabolites and affect concentrations
    in the leaf tissues significantly. St. John’s wort has been grown in a controlled
    environment with artificial light, C O 2 , temperature, air humidity, soil moisture,
    and pH in order to increase the hypericin concentration. [7] grew St. John’s wort
    in a laboratory to increase its efficacy with the environmental factors shown
    in Table 1 controlled. The current work applied the reported near optimal values
    in the designed greenhouse, for the four most important factors: temperature,
    air relative humidity, soil moisture, and light. TABLE 1 The Near Optimal Environmental
    Factors for Growing St. John’s Wort [7] B. Internet of Things (IoT) In the last
    two decades, the Internet has been in widespread use with benefits in information
    perception and in the use of real-time services [25]–[28]. Recently, IoT has become
    popular as a platform for devices to communicate with each other wirelessly [13].
    This modern technology provides cost-effective opportunities in tracking and controlling
    the environmental variables in agriculture. The IoT is an appropriate choice for
    communicating data between devices in a large area continuously, for monitoring
    or control [13], [15], [29]–[31]. IoT can be used at various levels of agricultural
    applications. Environmental monitoring stations can help evaluate fieldwork conditions,
    such as atmospheric conditions, soil moisture, temperature, air humidity, light,
    and plant growth. A Wireless Sensor Network (WSN) will then receive data from
    the sensors and send the data for processing to a server or data center [17].
    The IoT enables continuous communication via WSN and can provide access to data
    stored over the Internet [33]. The architecture can be divided into four layers
    as follows: (i) physical service, (ii) communications, (iii) services, and (iv)
    applications. This is the architecture implemented in the current study. C. Multiple
    Linear Regression Multiple Linear Regression (MLR) is among the most widely used
    methods for analyzing multi-factor effects. It is a statistical technique for
    assessing and modeling the relationships between multiple variables. An MLR model
    does not necessarily indicate causal relations, but only provides an estimate
    of possible relationships between variables [23]. In an MLR model these relationships
    are linear, describing dependent variables in terms of the independent variables
    [24]. The dependent variable is sometimes called the predicted or response variable,
    and the independent variables are predictors. The models relating the dependent
    variables to the independent variables are of the type shown in Equation. 1, y=
    β 0 + β 1 x 1 + β 2 x 2 +…+ β j x j + β p x p +ϵ, (1) View Source where y is the
    outcome variable, x j are the input variables, for j=1,2,…,p−1 β 0 is the value
    of y when each x j equals zero, β j is the change in y based on a unit change
    in x j for j=1,2,…,p−1 , and ϵ is a random error term needed to correct the linear
    model output to match a particular observed value y . The model fit system has
    n equations that can be expressed in a matrix notation as Y=xβ+ϵ , where Y is
    a (n×1) vector of the dependent variable or response, X is a (n×(p+1)) matrix
    of the levels of the p independent variables, β is a ((p+1)×1) vector of the regression
    coefficients, and ϵ is a (n×1) vector of random errors. We apply MLR in data analysis
    of accumulated IoT information. SECTION III. Related Work This section describes
    the use of IoT in agriculture for system management. In recent years, there have
    been many studies on the technological control of environment, by applying IoT
    and WSN in agriculture to influence plant growth for improved efficiency [17],
    [32]–[35]. Hashim et al. (2015) reviewed control with an electronic device (Arduino)
    of temperature and soil moisture, using Android-based smartphone applications
    to provide flexibility and functionality. They found low cost and flexibility
    from avoiding expensive components such as high-end personal computers [36]. Li
    et al. (2013) presented an information system for agriculture based on IoT, which
    used a distributed architecture [37]. Their system can manipulate business data
    from agricultural production. The tracking and tracing of the whole agricultural
    production process were implemented with distributed IoT servers. Medela et al.
    (2013) applied IoT in the agro-industrial production chain of grapes for wineries.
    The authors applied IoT to track the evolution [13]. Fourati et al. (2014) proposed
    a web-based decision support system communicating via WSN for irrigation scheduling
    in olive fields [38]. For this purpose, they used sensors to measure humidity,
    solar radiation, temperature, and rain. Kaewmard and Saiyod (2014) provided a
    long-term sustainable solution for the automation of agriculture, monitoring vegetable
    crops and their environment [39]. The authors developed a portable measurement
    technology including soil moisture sensor, air humidity sensor, and air temperature
    sensors. Ruan and Shi (2016) presented an IoT framework to assess the freshness
    of fruit in e-commerce deliveries, which faces unique challenges in transportation
    due to perishability and expensive logistics [40]. To make use of sensor data,
    many studies have attempted to turn such data into useful information and knowledge,
    as surveyed in [16]. Chen et al. (2014) proposed systems for monitoring multi-layer
    soil temperature and moisture in a farmland field using WSN to improve the water
    utilization and to collect basic data for research on soil water infiltration
    variations, and for intelligent precision irrigation [27]. Muangprathub et al.
    (2019) proposed developing a system for optimal watering of agricultural crops
    based on a wireless sensor network [17], by designing a control system using node
    sensors in the crop field with data management via smartphone and a web application.
    They applied data mining to analyze the data for predicting suitable temperature,
    humidity, and soil moisture for optimal management of the crops. The results demonstrate
    that the implementation was useful in agriculture. The moisture content of the
    soil was maintained appropriately for vegetable growth, reducing costs and increasing
    agricultural productivity. Castaneda et al. (2017) have designed and implemented
    intelligent frost control in greenhouses of central Mexico, based on measured
    outside air temperature, relative humidity, air velocity, wind flux, solar radiation,
    and relative humidity inside, as the input variables [41]. The model output was
    predicted temperature inside the greenhouse. IoT with WSN was applied to sensors
    both inside and outside the greenhouse. The two analytical models used were Autoregressive
    models with external input (ARX) and Artificial Neural Networks (ANN). The coefficient
    of determination ( R 2 ), the percent standard error of the prediction ( %SEP
    ) and the mean absolute percentage error ( MAPE ) were used to compare the errors
    and prediction abilities of the ARX and ANN models. Ding et al. (2018) developed
    an intelligent system to monitor, control and predict the growth of Dendrobium
    candidum ( D.candidum ) [29]. They used Siemens S7-200CPU224 Programmable Logic
    Controller (PLC) and Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) system.
    The SCADA was used for real time control of temperature, air humidity, soil moisture,
    carbon dioxide concentration, and light intensity in the artificial environment
    of D.candidum . The system included various sensors, the PLC controller, a host
    computer and other hardware devices. It used an RS-485 bus to transfer data and
    to control the environmental factors through a real-time dynamic PLC. They used
    a multilayer feed-forward back-propagation (BP) neural network model. Tripathy
    et al. (2014) have developed a surveillance system to prevent the outbreak of
    Leaf Spot (LS) disease in peanuts [15]. WSN was used to monitor the outbreak potential
    of LS, based on real-time weather data on temperature, moisture, and leaf moisture,
    from a Zigbee wireless sensor network distributed in the plots. Data mining of
    climate data provided knowledge, relationships, useful trends, and relationships,
    relating weather, environment, and the disease occurrences. Multivariate Regression
    (MVR) was used. The models were validated with ground-based surveillance data
    as beneficial to crop yield. Yu et al. (2016) proposed a model to predict temperature
    in a greenhouse using IPSO-LSSVM method [30]. The IPSO-LSSVM model combines two
    methods, the least squares vector and the particle swarm optimization, to use
    real-time temperature data from weather stations in the Chinese solar greenhouse.
    The model was more accurate than standard SVM and BP methods, and it can forecast
    6 hours forward. Farmers control the temperature to prevent damage from excessively
    high temperatures. Ramesh et al. (2014) applied WSN to monitoring geographic areas
    in real time (remote and hostile) [31]. The system was deployed in Idukki, a district
    in the Southwestern region of Kerala State, India, a highly landslide prone area.
    The system collects large amounts of sensor data related to rainfall, air humidity,
    pressure, and pore motion, as well as geological, hydrological, and soil characteristics.
    This network provides real-time data over the Internet, and an innovative three
    level landslide warning system was developed for these data (Early, Intermediate
    and Imminent). Over the past three years, a large amount of information has been
    collected to better understand the landslide situation and to warn about expected
    landslides. This technical approach enabled a low-cost system with wide areal
    coverage. SECTION IV. Materials and Methods A. Greenhouse Design and Construction
    To control the key environmental factors affecting growth of St. John’s wort,
    the greenhouse design had to support climate control. The four main factors to
    control were air temperature, air relative humidity, soil moisture, and light.
    The design is illustrated in Figure 1. FIGURE 1. The greenhouse design and construction.
    Show All The greenhouse is a closed system of 400×400×250 (length × width × height:
    cm) size, using a steel pipe frame covered with plastic. However, the weather
    in Southern of Thailand is mostly hot with a high level of sunlight. To reduce
    the sunlight and temperature inside the greenhouse, a shading net was used along
    with 4 controlled systems: evaporative cooling, fogging, irrigation, and artificial
    light. The evaporative cooling system was designed to maintain temperatures below
    the outside ambient temperature. It consists of a cooling pad and a ventilation
    fan. The cooling pad of 300×180×10 (width × height × thickness: cm) size has a
    water pump with (220 V, 50 Hz, 60 W). Two big ventilation fans (220 V, 50 Hz,
    145 W), and two small ventilation fans (220 V, 50 Hz, 28 W), are used to reduce
    temperature and increase humidity in the greenhouse. The big ventilation fans
    will be stopped when the temperature is below the target, while the small ventilation
    fans are on all the time to ensure ventilation. However, the evaporative cooling
    system is not sufficient for temperature control. A fogging system for direct
    evaporative cooling was adopted to complement it. This can be operated to maintain
    uniform temperature and humidity with (water pump size Dc 12 V, 60 W, 5 Amp, pressure
    8 bar). There are 10 high-pressure fog nozzles (diameter 0.3 mm), arranged for
    65 cm distances. The irrigation system controls the amounts of water to plants.
    The designed system drips water onto the soil at 100 mL:min amount through each
    of 110 nozzles (solenoid valve size 1/2 inches, 24 V to control water flow). The
    final system for artificial light uses 6 LED tubes to increase the light intensity
    in the greenhouse, arranged as shown in Figure 2. FIGURE 2. The position of sensors
    in greenhouse. Show All B. System Design At present, farm management can be managed
    and controlled via a mobile-based application that works via the Internet as a
    web-based application or a mobile-based application. Smart farms use IoT for measuring,
    storing, and controlling environmental factors via the Internet in real time.
    Thus, this work aimed to design and develop systems for feedback control using
    sensors in the field and data management, with the user interface in mobile-based
    and web-based applications. The system architecture has 3 main parts: physical
    layer, communication layer, and application layer, as shown in Figure 3. FIGURE
    3. The architecture for the proposed control system. Show All The physical layer
    in Figure 3 has two main functions: storage of measurement data from sensors,
    and control of environment in the greenhouse.The first function involves environmental
    data acquisition from sensors. These are temperature, air relative humidity, soil
    moisture, and light sensor, arranged as shown in Figure 2. The environment control
    function is activated by the user through the application. The designed control
    system, described in subsection 4.1, will be turned on or turned off. The data
    were collected and controlled using Arduino UNO as the main processor to manage
    and control the physical layer. In the communication layer in Figure 3, the data
    from the sensors will be communicated and collect into a server by using the Node
    MCU ESP8266 as interface to the Internet with router (3G/4G), and communicates
    with the server through WNS. The WSN has stations and sub-stations, namely measurement
    stations (function to measure and store data in the physical layer) and control
    stations (function to control environment in the physical layer). The stations
    communicate wirelessly only. The application layer in Figure 3 receives the gathered
    sensor data into a database, and uses web and mobile applications to monitor and
    control the greenhouse. The data can used to predict the temperature. Users can
    manage and view the data with the developed web application, while they can control
    the system via the mobile application. C. Implementation The system was implemented
    in hardware and software. The hardware design in the physical layer applied IoT
    devices to adjust environmental factors affecting growth of St. John’s wort. The
    control boxes housed electronic devices in a waterproof box, shown in Figure 4.
    The control boxes can be used anywhere inside the greenhouse, to provide the two
    main functions: store measurement data from sensors, and control environment in
    the greenhouse. Moreover, some sensors were installed outside the greenhouse to
    measure ambient environmental factors. In this research, we applied IoTs with
    SHT-21 sensor, BH-1750 light sensor, and soil moisture sensor to connect with
    the control box. The details of the sensors are shown in Table 2. The data were
    collected and stored in a server for use in analysis and control, as illustrated
    in the flowchart of Figure 5. TABLE 2 Sensor Specifications Based on Environmental
    Factors FIGURE 4. The hardware design for installation. Show All FIGURE 5. The
    flowchart to system control in greenhouse. Show All In software design, the interface
    between the system and the user constituted both web and mobile applications.
    The mobile application was developed to monitor and notify the user of changes
    in environmental factors. The control function was implemented with two alternative
    modes; automatic and manual. In automatic mode, the system uses collected data
    to control switching on and off of the control actuators in the greenhouse. It
    is activated when the environmental factors are in certain ranges set by the user.
    In manual mode, the user can control switching on and off of the control actuators.
    Figure 6 shows an example interface of the mobile application to control environment
    factors. FIGURE 6. An example the developed mobile application for environmental
    factor control. Show All The web application provides an interface for data management
    by the user. The user can view air temperature, air relative humidity, soil moisture,
    and light intensity both inside and outside the greenhouse. Both graphs and tables
    of the environmental factors can be viewed in the web application. User can export
    the collected data for future work. Also, the user can control environment factors
    as with the mobile application. An example interface of the web application is
    shown in Figure 7. Moreover, the web application will serve data analysis that
    is explained in section 4.4. FIGURE 7. An example of web page to illustrate environment
    factor control and IoT information from each installation. Show All D. Data Analysis
    MLR was applied for temperature prediction to adjust the other factors sensed
    and provided as IoT information. The nature of St. John’s wort requires more intense
    daylight than night light for good growth. The control system had day time set
    to 16 hours (6:30 AM - 10:30 PM) and night time to 8 hours (10:31 PM - 6.29 AM).
    This study accumulated data over 33 days with 43,494 records (19 February - 23
    March 2019). This data set was separated to daytime and night time. The IoT data
    were collected every minute for 33 days representing both inside and outside of
    the greenhouse. The outside factors influence the inside factors. The air temperature,
    air relative humidity, soil moisture, and light controls were based on the models
    in this section. We defined the factors as follows: (i) outside air temperature
    ( T o ), (ii) outside air relative humidity ( R o ), (iii) outside light ( L o
    ), (iv) inside light ( L i ), (v) inside air relative humidity ( R i ), (vi) inside
    air temperature ( T i ), and (Vii) Soil Moisture ( S ). Predictive model of inside
    temperature in the greenhouse was created with data mining. The analysis progressed
    in 4 steps, as follows. 1) Data Collection This involved both collection and cleaning
    to ensure quality of the data. Field measurement data tends to be dirty, incomplete
    and inconsistent, so data collection, data cleansing and data conversion are necessary.
    Further, data from the IoT field measurements were divided into daytime and night
    time, analyzed separately. 2) Data Preparation In this step, data are used to
    create models and test their accuracies. Data are divided into 2 groups: (i) training
    data 80% for training of predictive models, and (ii) 20% of the data for model
    validation. 3) Data Modeling and Discovery At this stage, the data are subjected
    to machine learning or statistical algorithms. Data modeling was used to find
    the relationships of the input variables: T o , R o , L o , L i , R i and S .
    We assigned the T i as the outcome variable because it is the main factor affecting
    the growth of important crops, while the rest of the variables are considered
    inputs here. Two groups of data separately represented daytime and night time,
    as mentioned earlier. The MLR was run in R program. The relationships between
    T i and input variables in daytime data (superscript d ) and night time (superscript
    n ) are shown in Equations. 2, 3, respectively. T d i = T n i = 0.206 R d i +0.001
    L d i +0.089 S d +0.107 T d o +0.002 L d o −33.59, 0.056 R n i +0.058 S n +0.604
    T n o −0.031 R n o −0.048 L n o −12.410, (2) (3) View Source 4) Solution Analysis
    The two models above can predict the temperature in the greenhouse. The formula
    for coefficient of determination R-squared ( R 2 ) is shown in Equation. 4. R
    2 =1−SSE/SST, (4) View Source where: SSE is the sum of square of residuals, SST
    is the total sum of squares. R-squared ( R 2 ) is a statistical measure, namely
    the proportion of the variance in a dependent variable that is explained by an
    independent variable (or variables) in a regression model. SSE is the sum of square
    of residuals. Residual is the difference between the predicted value and the actual
    value. SST is the total sum of squares. It is calculated by summing the squares
    of differences between the actual value and the mean value. Both fitted linear
    models were satisfactory, Figure 8, and can be used to predict temperature changes
    in the greenhouse. The models are used in the greenhouse control system. FIGURE
    8. The accuracy of both models (daytime and night). Show All SECTION V. Results
    and Discussion The proposed system used IoT mediated information from sensors
    installed both inside and outside the greenhouse. The data management was performed
    using the web application. The control system will be managed by the human users
    through web or mobile application. The daily average data summary for a user is
    demonstrated in Table 3 and Figure 9. TABLE 3 Daily Average Summary of Factors
    Inside and Outside the Designed Greenhouse FIGURE 9. The average value of each
    environmental factors in the greenhouse (daytime and night). Show All From Figure
    9, four factors are compared with the average value of each day to show trend
    of factors for a day. The results show that the factor values inside greenhouse
    is absolutely better than outside greenhouse. Moreover, we found that each factor
    has an unstable value in one day. In this study, the obtained data 33 days were
    used to analyze for finding the relationship of environmental factors that affect
    temperature changes in the greenhouse. The collection data for 33 day will be
    illustrated with detail values showed as Table 4. The achieved model from data
    analysis is used to solve high-temperature problems and increase the efficiency
    of temperature control in the greenhouse. From data modeling and knowledge discovery,
    we use multiple linear regression to create models that can be used to predict
    the temperature in the greenhouse. The analysis results created a model that can
    be used to predict the temperature inside the greenhouse both daytime and night,
    i.e. Equation. 2 and Equation. 3, respectively. The percentage of accuracy of
    both models is 88.49 and 71.77, shown in Figure 8. Models in each model use different
    environmental factor variables because during the daytime there is temperature
    control from the evaporative cooling system and fogging system, causing some factors
    not related to prediction. TABLE 4 The Value of Environmental Factors Inside and
    Outside the Designed Greenhouse for all Day The general characteristics of plants
    grown inside and outside the greenhouse are shown in Figure 10. For more details
    of the growth of St. John’s wort, we focus on 3 aspects: (i) survival rate, (ii)
    height, and (iii) amount of leaves. In this experiment, we define the characteristics
    and care of plants to collect data with abbreviations in x-x-x form where each
    x is assigned as follows: The first x: type of fertilizer, which consists of N,
    15, or 46, with following meanings: N is without fertilizer. 15 is mean that the
    plant is fertilized with formula 15-15-15. 46 is mean that the plant is fertilized
    with formula 46-0-0. The second x: size of young plant, which consists of S, M,
    or L, for small, medium, and large size, respectively. They are assessed by a
    farmer for fifty-day-old seedlings of St. John’s wort. FIGURE 10. An example plant
    to show the growth of St. John’s wort between inside and outside greenhouse. Show
    All The final x: type of measurement, either H or B, where H is for height and
    B is for amount of leaves. The St. John’s wort was planted 54 trees inside the
    greenhouse in 9 sets, with each set having 6 plants. Similar experiment was performed
    outside the greenhouse. We started with 6 plants for each size of young plants.
    For the past 11 weeks, the growth of St. John’s wort is shown in Table 5. The
    results show that the plant grows inside the greenhouse better than outside it,
    consistently by any criterion. Figure 11 illustrates the survival rate aspect.
    We found that the survival rate of plants inside the greenhouse was higher than
    outside, from week 4 to week 11. Figures 12 and 13 show the height and amount
    of leaves of St. John’s wort inside and outside the greenhouse, respectively.
    The results show exponential growth of plants inside the greenhouse with all fertilizer
    formulas. On the other hand, the plants outside greenhouse grew until about week
    4 and then died by about week 7. These growth data on St. John’s wort show that
    the proposed system assists and supports the growth through control of the 4 factors
    air temperature, air relative humidity, soil moisture, and light. TABLE 5 The
    Growth of St. John’s Wort With 11 Weeks FIGURE 11. The survival rate inside and
    outside greenhouse. Show All FIGURE 12. The height of St. John’s wort inside and
    outside greenhouse. Show All FIGURE 13. Amount of leaves of St. John’s wort inside
    and outside greenhouse. Show All SECTION VI. Conclusion St. John’s wort is a plant
    that is rich in active ingredients against many diseases, and naturally grows
    in comparatively cooler regions but not in tropical Thailand. A cultivation experiment
    at the farm of Prince of Songkla University, Surat Thani Campus, demonstrated
    a system for control and prediction of temperature in a greenhouse, based on IoT.
    The greenhouse was designed to levels of the environmental factors that are suitable
    for growth of St. John’s wort. We designed and implemented an intelligent greenhouse
    feedback control system that uses WSN to collect environmental factor data, stores
    data, and controls environmental factors in the greenhouse. The control was implemented
    with evaporative cooling systems, fogging systems, lighting systems, and irrigation
    systems. These can be user controlled through web and mobile applications that
    act as a medium for communicating with farmers. Multiple linear regression was
    used to model observational data, to establish models of temperature in the greenhouse
    that are needed for feedback control. This work demonstrates the high potential
    for using IoT to gather large data in the agricultural sector for use in analysis
    or control to improve yields. In the current case study, while St. John’s wort
    was not viable for ambient culturing, it thrived in the climate controlled greenhouse.

    \ agricultural development plays a crucial role in addressing the \nchallenges\
    \ of food security, environmental protection, and socio-economic \ndevelopment.\
    \ As we look into the future, several key prospects emerge for \nsustainable agricultural\
    \ development: Technology and Innovation: Advancements in \ntechnology, such as\
    \ precision farming, vertical farming, hydroponics, and \naquaponics, will continue\
    \ to revolutionize agriculture. These technologies can \noptimize resource utilization,\
    \ reduce environmental impacts, and increase \nproductivity. Additionally, innovations\
    \ in genetic engineering, biotechnology, and \ncrop protection methods can contribute\
    \ to more sustainable and resilient agricultural \npractices. \n      Climate-Smart\
    \ Agriculture: Climate change poses significant risks to \nagriculture, including\
    \ extreme weather events, water scarcity, and shifting climatic \npatterns. Climate-smart\
    \ agriculture focuses on adapting to and mitigating climate \nchange impacts.\
    \ Practices like conservation agriculture, agroforestry, and integrated \npest\
    \ management can enhance resilience, reduce greenhouse gas emissions, and \nimprove\
    \ soil health. Sustainable Intensification: With the increasing global \npopulation,\
    \ there is a need to produce more food while minimizing environmental \ndegradation.\
    \ Sustainable intensification involves increasing agricultural productivity \n\
    without expanding the agricultural land area. It involves the efficient use of\
    \ \nresources, such as water, fertilizers, and energy, and promoting integrated\
    \ farming \nsystems that optimize yields and minimize negative impacts. \n   \
    \    Circular Economy and Waste Reduction: The concept of a circular economy \n\
    emphasizes minimizing waste, recycling nutrients, and reducing environmental \n\
    pollution. Applying this approach to agriculture involves practices like composting,\

    \ emphasizes the \nintegration of ecological principles into agricultural systems.\
    \ It promotes \nbiodiversity conservation, natural pest control, and the use of\
    \ locally adapted crops. \nBy enhancing ecosystem services, such as pollination\
    \ and soil fertility, agro \necological approaches contribute to sustainable agricultural\
    \ development and \nresilience to environmental changes. Policy and Institutional\
    \ Support: Governments, \ninternational organizations, and agricultural institutions\
    \ play a vital role in \nsupporting sustainable agricultural development. Policy\

    \ are promising prospects for sustainable agricultural development, \nseveral\
    \ challenges need to be addressed to fully realize its potential. Limited access\
    \ \nto resources: Many farmers, especially small-scale farmers in developing countries,\
    \ \nface challenges in accessing essential resources such as land, water, finance,\
    \ and \ntechnology. Limited access to these resources hinders the adoption of\
    \ sustainable \nagricultural practices. Climate change and extreme weather events:\
    \ Climate change \nposes significant challenges to agricultural production. Rising\
    \ temperatures, erratic \nrainfall patterns, increased frequency of droughts and\
    \ floods, and the spread of pests \nand diseases affect crop yields and livestock\
    \ productivity. Adapting agriculture to \nclimate change and building resilience\
    \ is crucial for sustainable development. \n        Water scarcity and quality:\
    \ Water scarcity is a pressing issue in many regions, \nand agriculture is a major\
    \ consumer of freshwater resources. Sustainable agricultural \npractices must\
    \ prioritize water conservation and efficient irrigation methods. \nMoreover,\
    \ the pollution of water bodies due to agricultural runoff and the excessive \n\
    use of fertilizers and pesticides poses a threat to water quality. Loss of biodiversity\
    \ \nand ecosystem services: Intensive agricultural practices, including mono-cropping\
    \ \nand the use of agrochemicals, can lead to the loss of biodiversity and degradation\
    \ of \necosystems. This loss affects pollination, pest control, nutrient cycling,\
    \ and overall \necosystem health. Conserving biodiversity and promoting ecosystem\
    \ services is \nessential for sustainable agriculture. \n      Knowledge and technology\
    \ gaps: Access to appropriate knowledge and \ntechnologies is vital for the adoption\
    \ of sustainable agricultural practices. However, \nthere are knowledge gaps,\
    \ especially among small-scale farmers, regarding \nsustainable farming techniques\
    \ and the benefits they offer. Bridging these gaps and \npromoting knowledge exchange\
    \ and technology transfer are crucial for widespread \nadoption. Socioeconomic\
    \ factors: Socioeconomic factors, such as poverty, limited \nmarket access, and\
    \ lack of infrastructure, can hinder the adoption of sustainable \nagricultural\
    \ practices. Farmers need incentives and supportive policies to shift \ntowards\
    \ sustainable farming methods. Additionally, ensuring fair and equitable \naccess\
    \ to markets and improving farmers' income and livelihoods are critical for \n\
    sustainable agricultural development. \nINTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MODERN AGRICULTURE\

    \ Effective policies and governance frameworks \nare essential to support sustainable\
    \ agriculture. However, political will, policy \ncoherence, and institutional\
    \ capacity can vary across countries and regions. \nStrengthening policy frameworks,\
    \ enhancing coordination among stakeholders, and \npromoting favorable regulations\
    \ and incentives are necessary to overcome these \nchallenges. Consumer behavior\
    \ and market demand: Consumer awareness and \ndemand for sustainably produced\
    \ food products play a crucial role in driving the \nadoption of sustainable agricultural\
    \ practices. However, changing consumer \nbehavior and preferences can be challenging.\
    \ Raising awareness, promoting \nsustainable consumption patterns, and creating\
    \ market incentives for sustainable \nproducts are necessary to drive demand and\
    \ support sustainable agriculture. \n          Addressing these challenges requires\
    \ a multi-dimensional approach that \ninvolves collaborations among governments,\
    \ farmers, researchers, civil society \norganizations, and the private sector.\
    \ Investing in research and development, \nknowledge dissemination, capacity building,\
    \ and creating enabling policy \nenvironments are crucial steps towards overcoming\
    \ these challenges and achieving \nsustainable agricultural development. \nObstacles\
    \ to future prospects for sustainable agricultural development. \n      Several\
    \ obstacles can impede the future prospects for sustainable agricultural \ndevelopment.\
    \ These obstacles pose challenges to the widespread adoption and \nimplementation\
    \ of sustainable practices. Economic viability: The economic viability \nof sustainable\
    \ agriculture can be a significant obstacle. In some cases, the initial \ncosts\
    \ of transitioning to sustainable practices, such as investing in new technologies\
    \ \nor changing production systems, can be high. Farmers may face financial constraints\
    \ \nand perceive short-term economic risks, which can discourage them from adopting\
    \ \nsustainable practices. Ensuring that sustainable agriculture is economically\
    \ viable \nand providing financial incentives and support mechanisms can help\
    \ overcome this \nobstacle. \n       Lack of awareness and knowledge: Limited\
    \ awareness and knowledge about \nsustainable agricultural practices can hinder\
    \ their adoption. Farmers may not be \naware of the benefits of sustainable practices,\
    \ or they may lack the technical know-\nhow to implement them effectively. Providing\
    \ access to information, training \nprograms, and extension services that promote\
    \ sustainable agriculture is crucial to \naddress this obstacle. Institutional\

    \ in agriculture and future prospects for sustainable \nagricultural development.\
    \ \n       The concept of a circular economy in agriculture involves designing\
    \ agricultural \nsystems that minimize waste, maximize resource efficiency, and\
    \ promote \nsustainable production and consumption patterns. It aims to create\
    \ a closed-loop \nsystem where waste materials and by-products are recycled, reused,\
    \ or regenerated, \nreducing the dependency on finite resources and minimizing\
    \ environmental impacts. \nHere are some reasons why the circular economy in agriculture\
    \ has future prospects \nfor sustainable agricultural development: \n       Resource\
    \ efficiency: The circular economy in agriculture focuses on optimizing \nresource\
    \ use and reducing waste. It encourages practices such as organic waste \nrecycling,\
    \ composting, and the use of by-products as inputs for other agricultural \nprocesses.\
    \ By closing the loop and reintegrating waste back into the production \nsystem,\
    \ the circular economy minimizes the need for external inputs, conserves \nresources,\
    \ and reduces the environmental footprint of agricultural activities. \n     \
    \     Nutrient cycling and soil health: Circular economy principles emphasize\
    \ the \nrecycling of nutrients to maintain soil fertility and enhance soil health.\
    \ Nutrient-rich \norganic waste, such as crop residues, livestock manure, and\
    \ food waste, can be \ncomposted or converted into biofertilizers to replenish\
    \ soil nutrients. This reduces \nthe reliance on synthetic fertilizers, mitigates\
    \ nutrient pollution in water bodies, and \nsupports sustainable soil management\
    \ practices. Energy generation and renewable \nresources: The circular economy\
    \ in agriculture promotes the use of renewable \nenergy sources and the generation\
    \ of energy from agricultural by-products. For \nexample, bioenergy production\
    \ from crop residues or biogas generation from \nlivestock manure can provide\
    \ clean energy for on-farm operations or be fed into the \nenergy grid. This reduces\
    \ reliance on fossil fuels, contributes to greenhouse gas \nemissions reduction,\
    \ and fosters sustainable energy practices. \nINTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MODERN\

    \ \nVOLUME 1, ISSUE 2, 2021, 54 – 82 \n \n \n \n \n73 \n \n       Water management\
    \ and conservation: Circular economy principles in \nagriculture advocate for\
    \ efficient water management and conservation practices. \nThis includes techniques\
    \ such as rainwater harvesting, water recycling, and precision \nirrigation. By\
    \ optimizing water use and minimizing runoff, the circular economy \nsupports\
    \ sustainable water management, especially in water-scarce regions, \nreducing\
    \ pressure on freshwater resources and improving water efficiency in \nagriculture.\
    \ Value addition and diversification: The circular economy encourages \nvalue\
    \ addition and diversification of agricultural products and by-products. By \n\
    exploring new markets and innovative uses for agricultural waste, farmers can\
    \ \ngenerate additional income streams and reduce waste disposal costs. For instance,\
    \ \nagricultural residues can be used for the production of biofuels, bioplastics,\
    \ or animal \nfeed, contributing to a more sustainable and economically viable\
    \ agricultural sector. \n        Collaboration and partnerships: The circular\
    \ economy in agriculture requires \ncollaboration and partnerships among different\
    \ stakeholders, including farmers, \nbusinesses, policymakers, and consumers.\
    \ It involves establishing networks and \nvalue chains that facilitate the exchange\
    \ and recycling of resources and by-products. \nCollaboration among stakeholders\
    \ can foster innovation, knowledge sharing, and the \ndevelopment of supportive\
    \ policies and regulations for circular agricultural systems. \n        Resilience\
    \ to climate change: The circular economy in agriculture contributes \nto climate\
    \ change resilience by reducing resource dependency and enhancing the \nadaptive\
    \ capacity of agricultural systems. By minimizing waste, optimizing resource \n\
    use, and promoting sustainable practices, circular agriculture systems are better\
    \ \nprepared to withstand the impacts of climate change, such as water scarcity,\
    \ extreme \nweather events, and changing growing conditions. To realize the future\
    \ prospects of \nthe circular economy in agriculture, supportive policies, incentives,\
    \ and education \nare necessary. Governments, organizations, and businesses can\
    \ play a crucial role in \ncreating an enabling environment for circular agricultural\
    \ practices. This includes \nproviding financial support, promoting research and\
    \ innovation, facilitating \nknowledge exchange, and raising awareness among farmers\
    \ and consumers about \nthe benefits of circular agriculture. \n        By embracing\
    \ the circular economy in agriculture, we can transition towards \nmore sustainable\
    \ and regenerative farming systems that minimize waste, maximize \nresource efficiency,\

    Abstract

    Agriculture shows an important role in the enlargement of an economy. The proposed
    system explores how utilizing digital footprints might help improve

    agricultural practices and production. Agricultural data is increasingly available
    in digital form because of the development of modern technology and the

    spread of connected devices. These data can be utilized to produce digital footprints
    that document the whole lifecycle of agricultural production, from

    planting to harvesting. Farmers may then decide when to sow, water, fertilize,
    and harvest their crops by using machine learning algorithms trained on these

    digital footprints to spot patterns and forecast results. The study examines various
    machine learning methods that can be used to examine digital footprints

    and shows the advantages of doing so, including higher yields, better resource
    management, and lower costs. The timing of crop planting, fertilization, and

    harvest has long been determined by the agriculture sector using conventional
    techniques and experience. However, with the expansion of agricultural data

    available, there is now a chance to use machine learning algorithms to recognize
    trends and forecast outcomes based on this data. This study explores the

    potential of machine learning methods, particularly Random Forest optimization,
    to improve agricultural practices and boost output. The study uses Random

    Forest optimization, a potent machine learning method that can examine massive
    datasets, to forecast crop yield based on many variables like weather

    patterns, soil quality, and fertilizer application. The study''s ¦ndings show
    how well the Random Forest optimization technique predicts crop productivity with

    an accuracy of 99.97%. By giving farmers useful information about forecasting
    crop yields, they may increase their overall productivity by using their

    resources wisely. The report also emphasizes the necessity of additional study
    and funding for the creation of machine learning algorithms that are

    speci¦cally customized to the peculiarities of the agricultural sector, as well
    as the signi¦cance of data quality and privacy in the collecting and analysis
    of

    agricultural data. A combination of hardware and software tools, including data
    collection sensors, data processing equipment, graphics processing units

    (GPUs), cloud computing services, and mobile applications, will be needed for
    the hardware implementation of increasing agricultural practices in production

    using machine learning with Random Forest optimization techniques.

    I. INTRODUCTION

    The practice of farming involves cultivating land, keeping animals, and creating
    food, ¦ber, and other goods that support human life. As a source of food and

    raw materials for businesses that produce goods and services, it is a crucial
    sector of the economy. In many developing nations, since it is frequently the
    sole

    source of income for rural communities, agriculture plays a signi¦cant role in
    the economies of those nations. Agriculture has a signi¦cant role in the nation''s

    GDP and export revenues in addition to producing food and raw materials. It advances
    the construction of rural infrastructure, provides cash, and offers

    employment opportunities. The sustainability of the environment and rural development
    are also intimately related to agriculture. To address more general

    economic and social problems like food security, poverty alleviation, and environmental
    sustainability, the agricultural sector is also crucial. Furthermore,

    because higher productivity and e¨ciency can result in higher earnings and investments
    in other industries, agriculture may be a signi¦cant contributor to

    economic growth. In summary, agriculture is an important economic sector that
    has an impact on society and the environment in addition to its economic

    contribution [1]. Agriculture has been practiced for thousands of years, and over
    that period, it has undergone many changes. Scienti¦c techniques and

    cutting-edge technology are used in modern agriculture to boost output and e¨ciency
    while reducing its negative effects on the environment. Agroforestry,

    crop cultivation, and animal husbandry are some of the main agricultural activities.
    Food security, economic growth, and environmental sustainability all

    suffer from the effects of agriculture. Millions of people all around the world,
    particularly in poor nations, depend on it greatly for their daily survival.

    Sustainable agricultural practices are being created to make sure that agricultural
    activities meet the demands of the present without compromising the

    capacity of future generations to meet their own needs [2]. The use of synthetic
    inputs like fertilizers, insecticides, and herbicides to boost crop yields is

    referred to as conventional agricultural practices. These methods are based on
    monoculture farming, which is the practice of growing the same crop over and

    over in a single ¦eld. Large pieces of equipment, irrigation infrastructure, and
    high-input agricultural methods de¦ne conventional agriculture. Even though

    crop yields and food production have increased signi¦cantly thanks to conventional
    agriculture, the environment is still negatively impacted. When synthetic

    inputs are used excessively, they can cause soil erosion, water pollution, and
    biodiversity loss. In addition, monoculture farming''s reliance on crops makes

    them more susceptible to pests and disease, which can cost farmers a lot of money
    [3]. With the help of recent advancements in technology and scienti¦c

    knowledge, modern agricultural practices have undergone tremendous change. Farmers
    can now produce more food with fewer resources and less negative

    environmental impact thanks to these practices. However, the sector faces several
    challenges that can have signi¦cant impacts on its productivity and

    sustainability. Some of the challenges in agriculture include:

    Climate Change: Climate change is a signi¦cant challenge facing agriculture, as
    it can affect crop yields and increase the incidence of pests and

    diseases. Extreme weather events, such as droughts and §oods, can also impact
    agriculture and reduce crop productivity.

    Limited Resources: Agriculture is dependent on several resources, including water,
    land,

    and energy. However, these resources are becoming increasingly scarce due to factors such as population growth and urbanization. This can lead to comp

    Soil Degradation: Soil degradation is a signi¦cant challenge facing agriculture, as it can reduce the productivity
    of farmland and affect crop yields. Soil

    degradation can result from factors such as erosion, overuse of pesticides and
    fertilizers, and deforestation.

    Pest and Disease Management: Pests and diseases can have a signi¦cant impact on
    crop yields, leading to reduced productivity and higher costs for

    farmers. However, managing pests and diseases can be challenging, as it requires a comprehensive understanding of the pests and diseases and the

    appropriate management strategies.

    Access to Markets: Access to markets can be a signi¦cant challenge for farmers, particularly those in developing countries. Farmers may lack access to m

    and transportation systems, which can limit their ability to sell their products
    and receive fair prices.

    Labor Shortages: Labor shortages can be a signi¦cant challenge for farmers, particularly
    in developed countries. Labor shortages can lead to higher labor

    costs and di¨culties in ¦nding workers to perform critical tasks such as planting and
    harvesting.

    Financial Constraints: Farmers often face ¦nancial constraints, including limited
    access to

    credit and high costs for inputs such as seeds, fertilizers, and machinery. These constraints can limit their ability to invest
    in their farms and increase their

    Page 3/20

    productivity.

    Precision agriculture is one of the biggest innovations in contemporary agriculture.
    Data about soil conditions, crop development, and weather patterns are

    collected using cutting-edge technologies like GPS, sensors, and drones. With
    the help of this knowledge, decisions about pest management,

    fertilizer, irrigation, and planting may be made that will maximize yields and
    the e¨cient use of resources [4]. Genetically modi¦ed organisms (GMOs) are

    another signi¦cant development in agriculture. To increase their resistance to
    pests, diseases, and environmental stressors, these crops have undergone

    genetic engineering. As a result, farmers are now able to grow more food with
    fewer inputs like pesticides and herbicides.

    The importance of sustainable agriculture is likewise rising as global concern over climate change and
    environmental degradation rises. Reduced soil erosion,

    water conservation, and soil health are all bene¦ts of sustainable farming techniques
    like cover crops, crop rotation, and conservation tillage.

    By storing carbon in the soil, they also aid in lowering greenhouse gas emissions. The mechanization of farms has
    also aided modern agriculture. Many

    chores can now be automated by farmers, which lowers labor costs. Examples of
    advanced machinery include tractors, planters, and harvesters. Farmers can

    now manage greater land areas, which has increased farming e¨ciency.

    In summary, contemporary agricultural methods are crucial for feeding a growing
    world population while minimizing the negative effects on the environment.

    The "World Population Prospects," makes predictions on population growth. The
    most recent edition of this report, which spans the years 1950 to 2100, was

    released in 2019. According to the report, there were 7.7 billion people on the
    planet in 2019 and 9.7 billion are expected to live there by the year 2050 [5].
    The

    research also points out that although population growth rates have been falling
    since the 1960s, the overall number of people added to the world''s population

    every year has been rising. Farmers may continue to grow their food production
    while using fewer resources by utilizing technology, science, and sustainable

    farming methods, ensuring the industry''s viability. This is implemented using
    arti¦cial intelligence techniques as shown in ¦gure 1.

    Arti¦cial intelligence (AI) is the period used to designate the capacity of machines
    to carry out tasks that would ordinarily require human intelligence to

    complete, such as comprehending natural language, recognizing patterns, making
    judgment calls, and picking up knowledge from experience. The subject of

    arti¦cial intelligence is expanding quickly, revolutionizing several industries
    and perhaps changing how we work and live [6]. Numerous applications, including

    voice assistants, picture and speech recognition, natural language processing,
    and predictive analytics, currently make use of AI technology. It is also

    employed in industries including manufacturing, transportation, banking, and healthcare,
    where it helps to increase productivity, lower costs, and increase

    safety. However, the quick development of AI also prompts signi¦cant moral and
    societal issues. Concerns have been raised regarding how AI will affect

    employment, privacy, and security, as well as the possibility that these technologies
    would help to reinforce prejudice and discrimination. It will be crucial to

    address these concerns as AI technology develops and to make sure that it is created
    and applied in a way that bene¦ts society as a whole. Arti¦cial

    intelligence (AI) is taking on a bigger and bigger role in agriculture by assisting
    farmers and other stakeholders in making better decisions and maximizing

    their operations [7]. Crop observing, yield estimating, soil investigation, and
    pest controller are just a few of the applications of AI.

    Agronomists may spot possible issues early and take action before they worsen
    by using crop monitoring, where AI analyses images captured by drones or

    sensors to ¦nd changes in plant health or growth patterns. Based on data inputs
    like weather patterns, soil conditions, and previous yield data, AI- powered

    yield prediction can assist farmers in estimating crop yields. Additionally, AI
    can identify and forecast the spread of pest outbreaks to assist in pest

    management, analyze soil samples to evaluate nutrient content and provide fertilization
    suggestions.

    In general, using AI in agriculture helps farmers increase their yields, cut costs,
    and encourage sustainable farming methods. It can transform how we cultivate

    food and tackle some of the biggest issues confronting agriculture, such as food
    security and climate change. They are done using machine learning with

    optimization algorithms. It is de¦ned as the branch of arti¦cial intelligence
    called "machine learning" which uses algorithms and statistical models to let

    computers learn from data without having to be explicitly programmed. It is predicated
    on the premise that computers can discover patterns and reach

    conclusions by examining massive amounts of data [8]. With the introduction of
    technology, especially the use of machine learning techniques, agriculture

    has recently seen a substantial revolution. Since it can automate complicated
    activities and make predictions based on data, machine learning has grown in

    popularity. Some of the causes for utilizing machine learning are as follows:

    Automation: By automating time-consuming and repetitive processes, machine learning
    frees up human resources to work on tasks that are more

    complicated and creative.

    Forecasting and prediction: Machine learning models can be trained on historical
    data to create forecasts and predictions about future outcomes,

    including consumer behavior, sales trends, and market prices.

    Personalization: Machine learning can be used to customize user experiences, such
    as news feeds or product recommendations on e-commerce websites.

    Fraud detection: By learning from trends in historical data, machine learning
    can be used to identify fraudulent transactions or activities.

    Natural language processing: Chatbots, voice assistants, and other language-based
    applications can be made possible through machine learning when it

    comes to analyzing and comprehending natural language.

    Image and speech recognition: By using machine learning to identify patterns in
    images and audio, applications like facial and object identi¦cation and

    voice-based user interfaces are made possible.

    This study examines how digital footprints can improve farming practices and increase
    output. The process of transforming information from an analog to a

    digital representation is referred to as digitalization. Then, utilizing electrical
    equipment and computer networks, this digital format may be stored, processed,

    and sent. From the way we interact and consume information to the way we work
    and access healthcare, digitalization has drastically changed many facets

    of our lives [9]. The term "digital footprint" describes the online tracks that
    a person or business leaves behind on the internet. The importance of having a

    digital footprint in agriculture is rising as machine learning-enhanced production
    practices improve farming practices.

    Page 4/20

    Here are a few explanations:

    Data Gathering: Digital footprints can be used to gather information on agricultural
    practices, including the usage of pesticides, irrigation systems, and

    fertilizers. By using this information, it is possible to develop digital pro¦les
    of farms and produce insights that can be used to maximize agricultural

    output. Then, by analyzing this data, machine learning algorithms may provide
    farmers with insights and suggestions for enhancing productivity.

    Predictive Analytics: Machine learning algorithms can create predictions about
    crop yields, insect outbreaks, and weather trends using data from digital

    footprints. This can assist farmers in choosing planting, irrigation, and pest
    management strategies with more knowledge, which can increase yield. With

    precision agriculture, it is possible to construct computerized maps of farms
    that show regions with a particular need, such as nutrient shortages or pest

    infestations. Then, using machine learning algorithms, production can be improved
    by reducing waste and using targeted applications of pesticides or

    fertilizer, for example.

    Crop Monitoring: Sensors, drones, or satellites can employ digital footprints
    to monitor crops in real time. The data can then be analyzed using machine

    learning algorithms to give farmers information on the health and growth trends
    of their crops. This can assist farmers in identifying and addressing

    problems like nutrient de¦cits or pest outbreaks early on, which can boost crop
    yields and lower losses.

    The capacity to store and analyze enormous volumes of data rapidly and effectively
    is one of the main advantages of digitization. As a result, cutting-edge

    ¦elds like machine learning and arti¦cial intelligence have emerged, which generate
    predictions and judgments using vast volumes of data. It is now simpler

    for people to work together across distances and time zones thanks to new kinds
    of communication and collaboration made possible by digitalization. Online

    collaboration tools and remote work have grown in popularity over the past several
    years as a result of this. Agriculture and food production are being

    revolutionized by digitalization [10]. It has the potential to boost productivity,
    cut expenses, and boost yields, ultimately resulting in more lucrative and

    sustainable agriculture.

    In the case of cash crops, digitalization has allowed farmers to more effectively
    track and manage their harvests from planting to harvest. Farmers can

    monitor soil moisture, nitrogen levels, and other crucial factors thanks to technologies
    like precision farming and remote sensing, which improve crop yields

    and cut expenses. Digitalization is assisting in addressing problems with food
    crops such as food waste and ine¨cient supply chains [11]. For instance, food

    goods can be tracked using blockchain technology from farm to table, lowering
    the danger of contamination and enabling more effective recalls.

    Agriculture and food production are being transformed overall by digitalization,
    becoming more effective, sustainable, and pro¦table for both farmers and

    customers. We examine the application of machine learning algorithms in agriculture
    and how they might increase crop output and support farmers'' decision-

    making. We also look at the opportunities and problems associated with integrating
    digital footprints into agriculture and how that might result in sustainable

    practices. The digital footprints that people leave behind when interacting with
    technology are referred to as digital footprints. Digital footprints in agriculture

    can be used to gather information on farming methods, crop output, weather trends,
    and soil health. Machine learning algorithms can be created using this

    data to enhance agricultural practices. For instance, information on weather patterns
    can be utilized to forecast crop output and determine the ideal time for

    sowing. To utilize fertilizer and pesticides most effectively, data on soil health
    can be employed. Machine learning algorithms come in a variety of forms, such

    as reinforcement learning, unsupervised learning, and supervised learning [12].
    Unsupervised learning includes spotting patterns in unlabeled data, whereas

    supervised learning uses labeled data to train a machine learning model. Due to
    its capacity to collect and analyze vast amounts of data to produce insights

    that might assist farmers in making more informed decisions, machine learning
    is becoming more and more widely used in agricultural practices. The usage

    of resources can be optimized, waste can be decreased, and crop yields can now
    be increased thanks to machine learning. Precision farming is one of the

    most often used uses of machine learning in agriculture. Applying the appropriate
    inputs, such as fertilizer, herbicides, and water, at the appropriate time and

    in the appropriate amount includes precision agriculture, which involves analyzing
    data to identify variability within a ¦eld. To assist farmers in making more

    accurate judgments about how to manage their crops, machine learning algorithms
    can analyze data from sensors, satellite photos, and weather forecasts.

    Predicting crop yields is another way that machine learning is used in agriculture.
    Machine learning algorithms can create predictive models that assist

    farmers in estimating their yields for the current season by analyzing historical
    data on crop yields and weather trends. Making decisions about when to

    harvest, when to sell, and how much to grow can be done using this information.

    Plant disease management and identi¦cation can both be done using machine learning.
    Machine learning algorithms can detect illnesses and pests early on

    by examining photographs of plants, allowing farmers to take preventative measures
    before serious damage is done. By doing this, you can increase crop

    quality while using less pesticides. Machine learning can be used to enhance not
    only crop management but also animal management [13]. Machine learning

    algorithms can aid farmers in identifying potential health issues and optimizing
    feeding and breeding schedules by analyzing data on animal behavior, such

    as feeding patterns and mobility. Despite the potential advantages of integrating
    digital footprints in agriculture, there are still several issues that need to
    be

    resolved. Data privacy and security are one of the di¨culties. Farmers'' concerns
    about privacy and security may make them hesitant to share their data. The

    absence of technology and data connectivity in rural places is another problem.
    The technology required to gather and analyze data may not be available to

    farmers in remote locations.

    This is implemented through Information and Communication Technology (ICT). By
    boosting output, boosting e¨ciency, and lowering environmental impact,

    ICT has also signi¦cantly contributed to the transformation of agriculture. Using
    ICT in agriculture entails putting different digital technologies to use to help

    agricultural practices such as precision agriculture, smart farming, and farm
    management systems. With the help of ICT tools like GPS, sensors, and drones,

    farmers can monitor and analyze data on their crops and soil to make educated
    decisions about planting, fertilizing, and irrigation. Precision agriculture is
    a

    growing ¦eld. In doing so, crop yields are improved while the consumption of resources
    like water and fertilizer is reduced. Automating various farming tasks,

    such as planting, harvesting, and livestock monitoring, through the use of ICT
    tools like Internet of Things (IoT) sensors and machine learning algorithms is

    known as smart farming. This might lower labor costs, boost productivity, and
    enhance farming techniques'' precision.

    Page 5/20

    To handle several areas of farming, including inventory management, ¦nancial management,
    and supply chain management, farm management systems use

    ICT tools like cloud-based software applications. This can facilitate operational
    simpli¦cation and enhance decision-making for farmers. In general, the

    application of ICT in agriculture has the potential to revolutionize the sector
    by enabling more productive, e¨cient, and sustainable farming methods. The

    major contributions of the proposed work include the following:

    Improved Agricultural Practices: By introducing the use of machine learning algorithms
    in analyzing data gathered from various sources, such as weather

    data, soil samples, and crop yields, the study may contribute to improving ag
    practices. Improved crop yields may arise from farmers making better

    decisions about when to sow, irrigate, fertilize, and harvest their crops as a
    result.

    Increased Crop productivity: By ¦nding ideal circumstances for crop development,
    recognizing and forecasting probable crop illnesses, and suggesting

    the optimum fertilizers or pesticides employ, the implementation of machine learning
    techniques in agriculture may boost agricultural productivity.

    Environmental Sustainability: By using fewer pesticides and fertilizers, improving
    irrigation techniques, and lowering crop waste, the paper may also help

    to advance environmental sustainability.

    Information Transfer: By presenting a framework for how machine learning might
    be used in the agriculture industry, the study may help spread

    information and best practices. This might facilitate the understanding of the
    potential advantages of this technology by other researchers, practitioners,

    and policymakers and promote its implementation.

    In conclusion, the use of machine learning in agricultural practices is growing.
    Farmers can make better decisions, enhance yields, and save waste thanks to

    its capacity to handle massive amounts of data and produce predictive models.
    Machine learning will likely play a bigger part in the future of agriculture as
    a

    result of the ongoing improvement of technology.

    II. SYSTEMATIC REVIEW

    The proposed system paved way for smart farming. Using cutting-edge technology
    and data analytic methods, smart farming, sometimes referred to as

    precision agriculture, aims to enhance farming practices, boost agricultural production,
    and lessen waste and environmental effects. Optimizing farming

    operations like irrigation, fertilization, pest control, and crop management,
    entails the integration of numerous technologies like sensors, drones, GPS, and

    arti¦cial intelligence (AI). To meet the increasing demand for food in a world
    that is changing quickly, smart farming aims to make agriculture more effective,

    sustainable, and lucrative. Machine learning is one of these technologies; it
    uses algorithms to ¦nd patterns and insights in huge datasets. Machine learning

    in agriculture offers the potential to increase agricultural productivity and
    support farmers'' decision-making. This research examines how digital footprints
    can

    be used to improve agricultural practices and increase output. Smart agriculture
    practices use a variety of technology to streamline farming processes,

    increase yields, and cut waste. Among the most important technologies used in
    smart agriculture are:

    Precision farming: To maximize crop productivity and reduce resource wastage,
    such as water, fertilizer, and pesticides, precision farming is a

    sophisticated agricultural management method. Making educated judgments regarding
    planting, harvesting, and resource allocation entails gathering

    and analyzing data about the state of the soil, weather patterns, crop growth
    patterns, and other pertinent elements. The GPS is one of the most important

    technologies used in precision farming. (GPS). With the aid of GPS technology,
    farmers can follow their machinery in real-time

    and keep an eye on the location and crop productivity. Making informed judgments
    about where to sow crops and how much fertilizer and water to use can be

    done using this data. Additionally, GPS can be used to build ¦eld maps, which
    can be utilized to spot problem regions such as those with poor soil quality or

    low crop yield. Another increasingly popular precision farming method is Variable
    Rate Technology (VRT). Farmers are now able to apply the exact amount of

    pesticides, water, and fertilizer required for each ¦eld area thanks to VRT technology.
    By doing so, crop yields increase, waste is reduced, and money is saved

    [14]. As an illustration, if a farmer uses VRT to apply fertilizer, the system
    can modify the amount applied following the crop''s needs and the soil''s

    circumstances. The quality and production of the crops can be enhanced by making
    sure that the proper amount of fertilizer is applied to each section of the

    ¦eld. Remote sensing is a crucial tool for precision farming. The health of plants
    and the amount of moisture in the soil can be precisely determined using

    remote sensing technology like satellite photography and drones. Utilizing this
    information will allow you to keep an eye on crop development and spot ¦eld

    issues. The farmer can inspect the region and establish whether there is a pest
    infestation or a nutrient shortage, for instance, if a drone spots a patch of

    fading plants. Precision farming also includes the use of precision irrigation
    systems. These systems optimize water use by using sensors and software to

    make sure crops get the proper amount of water at the right time. Water waste
    is decreased, and crop quality is raised. For instance, a precision irrigation

    system can automatically change the amount of water sprayed to a ¦eld''s dry patches
    if it notices that the area is dry. In conclusion, precision farming

    techniques are revolutionizing the agricultural sector by utilizing cutting-edge
    technology and data analytics to maximize crop output, improve crop quality, cut

    down on resource waste, and boost e¨ciency and pro¦tability for farmers. Farmers
    may decide wisely about planting, harvesting, and resource allocation by

    gathering and analyzing data on soil quality, weather patterns, and crop growth
    patterns. This can result in better outcomes for farmers as well as the

    environment.

    Internet of Things (IoT): The Internet of Things (IoT) is playing a progressively
    signi¦cant part in agriculture, allowing farmers to enhance their resources

    and improve their yields while reducing costs and increasing e¨ciency. Here are
    some of how IoT is revolutionizing agriculture:

    1. IoT sensors can be utilized in agriculture to gather information on soil moisture,
    temperature, and nutrient levels as well as weather, plant development, and

    pest infestations. This information can be used to identify ¦elds that need attention,
    improve irrigation and fertilization schedules, and track crop health and

    growth rates.

    2. Livestock management: IoT sensors can be used to track a livestock''s movement,
    observe its eating and drinking routines, and spot any irregularities that

    would point to an ailment or injury. By using this information, feeding, and care
    schedules can be improved, disease outbreaks can be stopped, and overall

    Page 6/20

    animal health and production can be increased.

    3. Supply chain management: From the farm to the consumer, IoT sensors may be
    utilized to track the movement of crops and livestock. Farmers and

    distributors can bene¦t from this by maximizing logistics, cutting waste, and
    ensuring that goods are delivered to markets on schedule and in good shape.

    4. Monitoring environmental conditions: IoT sensors can be used to keep an eye
    on things like air and water quality, weather patterns, and climate change.

    This can assist farmers in selecting crops, timing plantings, and other agricultural
    practices that are in§uenced by environmental conditions.

    5. IoT technology can be utilized to create autonomous farming systems, where
    robots and drones can take care of chores like planting, watering, and

    harvesting crops. By doing so, the danger of human mistakes can be decreased while
    labor expenses can be decreased and productivity increased.

    Big Data Analytics: Big data analytics in agriculture have the potential to change
    how farmers and agricultural enterprises conduct their operations.

    Farmers may make more educated decisions that can result in higher yields, more
    e¨ciency, and lower costs by gathering, analyzing, and interpreting

    vast amounts of data. Predictive insights are one of the main advantages of big
    data analytics in agriculture. Farmers can estimate future yields with

    greater accuracy by looking back at historical data on weather patterns, soil
    characteristics, and crop performance. This can assist them in maximizing

    planting schedules, selecting the crops that are most suited for a speci¦c site,
    and modifying their agricultural techniques to increase productivity.

    Precision agriculture is another ¦eld where big data analytics can have a signi¦cant
    effect. Farmers can obtain comprehensive information about soil

    moisture, nitrogen levels, and other environmental aspects that in§uence crop
    growth by employing sensors and other data-collection equipment. Making

    decisions concerning irrigation, fertilizer application, and other farming-related
    issues will thus be easier with the aid of this knowledge [15]. Farmers may

    use big data analytics to spot possible issues like pest infestations or crop
    diseases early on. Farmers can spot warning signs early on and take action

    before the issue gets worse by analyzing data from sensors and other sources.
    Big data analytics in agriculture has the potential to greatly boost

    productivity, lower costs, and raise yields. However, it necessitates a large
    investment in technology, data analytic skills, and a readiness to adopt novel

    farming practices.

    Robotics: Precision farming, harvesting, monitoring, and maintenance are just
    a few of the agricultural applications where robots are becoming more and

    more crucial. Increased productivity is one of the key advantages of deploying
    robots in agriculture because they can operate around the clock and

    reliably perform repetitive jobs. Robots can also lower labor costs, boost productivity,
    and enhance sustainability. Robots are having a big impact on

    several industries, including precision farming. Robots can make accurate choices
    on planting, watering, fertilizing, and harvesting by gathering and

    analyzing data on crops, soil, weather, and other aspects. Thus, waste is decreased,
    environmental sustainability is increased, and crop yields are

    improved. Robots used for soil analysis, sensor-equipped drones, and self-driving
    tractors are a few examples of precision farming robots. Harvesting is

    another industry where robots are having a big impact. Robots are being developed
    to pick fruits and vegetables, which can be a labor-intensive operation,

    more effectively and precisely. Additionally, according to quality and other criteria,
    automated systems may sort and grade collected products. Due to their

    ability to operate continuously, harvesting robots can speed up the process of
    getting crops to market. The usage of robots in agriculture also extends to

    monitoring and maintenance. Robots can be employed to keep an eye on crop development
    and spot any issues like pests or illness. With the use of

    sensors and other cutting- edge technology, this can be done, allowing farmers
    to act immediately to avoid crop loss. To eliminate the need for manual

    labor, robots can also complete activities like irrigation, weeding, and trimming.
    In agriculture, autonomous vehicles are also becoming more prevalent

    [16]. It is possible to carry crops and supplies as well as plant and harvest
    crops using self-driving tractors and other autonomous vehicles. This lowers

    the demand for human labor and boosts productivity. Overall, the use of robots
    has the potential to revolutionize agriculture by increasing its productivity,

    sustainability, and e¨ciency. Robots can assist farmers in meeting the rising
    need for food while minimizing the impact of farming on the environment by

    lowering labor costs, boosting production, and improving sustainability. We may
    anticipate seeing even more cutting-edge agricultural robots produced as

    technology develops.

    Cloud Computing: Agriculture is seeing an increase in the importance of cloud
    computing, which bene¦ts farmers, academics, and other sector

    participants in a variety of ways. Cloud computing is assisting in enhancing e¨ciency,
    production, and sustainability in agriculture through data

    management and predictive analytics. Improved data management is one of the main
    advantages of cloud computing for agriculture. It can be di¨cult to

    store and analyse the vast volumes of data

    that farmers produce on their crops, soil, weather, and other variables [17].
    By providing a safe and expandable platform for data processing and storing, cloud

    computing offers a remedy. Farmers who use cloud-based solutions can access and
    analyse their data on any device, at any time, from anywhere. This

    enables them to decide on planting, fertilizing, and harvesting more wisely, which
    increase agricultural yields and decrease can waste. Additionally, the use of

    cloud computing improves communication between scientists and agronomists. Researchers
    can collaborate globally with co-workers and collaborators by

    putting study data on the cloud and making it accessible to them. This might hasten
    agricultural research and development and result in fresh ideas for

    managing crops, controlling pests, and other things. Predictive analytics is a
    bene¦t of cloud computing for agriculture as well. Farmers can utilize cloud-

    based technologies to forecast agricultural yields by examining data on crop growth,
    weather patterns, and other variables. They can then modify their

    planting and harvesting schedules as necessary. The risk of crop loss due to weather
    or other reasons can be reduced and resources may be used more

    effectively as a result. In terms of sustainability, cloud computing also has
    advantages. Farmers can use cloud-based solutions to manage data and cut down

    on the amount of paper and other physical resources required for data storage
    and analysis [18]. Farmers may also cut waste and make better use of

    resources by employing predictive analytics to optimize agricultural yields. Overall,
    cloud computing is playing a signi¦cant role in agriculture, providing

    advantages in terms of sustainability, cooperation, data management, and predictive
    analytics. We may anticipate seeing even more cutting-edge cloud-based

    technologies created for use in agriculture as technology develops, assisting
    farmers to increase output, decrease waste, and satisfy the rising need for food.

    Blockchain technology: To increase transparency, e¨ciency, and sustainability
    throughout the supply chain, blockchain technology is rapidly being

    applied in agriculture. Blockchain technology can revolutionize business and provide
    farmers, consumers, and other stakeholders with a wide range of

    advantages, from tracking food safety to expediting transactions. Improved traceability
    is one of the blockchain''s main advantages in agriculture.

    Farmers may follow their products from farm to table using blockchain-based technologies,
    giving consumers more details about the food''s origins and

    production processes [19]. Permitting quicker and more precise recalls in the
    event of contamination or another problem can assist boost consumer and

    Page 7/20

    farmer trust while also enhancing food safety. E¨ciency gains are another advantage
    of blockchain in agriculture. Farmers may cut down on the need for

    middlemen and streamline the buying and selling of products by adopting blockchain-based
    technologies to coordinate transactions. Better outcomes for

    both farmers and customers may result from this as it can lower costs and improve
    supply chain transparency. Blockchain can also aid increase

    agricultural sustainability. Blockchain-based platforms can encourage more sustainable
    practices and decrease waste by enabling farmers to track the

    environmental impact of their products. Blockchain can also encourage more sustainable
    production methods and lessen agriculture''s impact on the

    environment by giving consumers more information about the sustainability of the
    items they purchase. Smart contracts are one application of

    blockchain in agriculture. The details of the agreement between the buyer and
    seller are directly encoded into lines of code in smart contracts, which are

    self-executing contracts. This reduces the need for middlemen and can lower the
    possibility of fraud or disagreements. Smart contracts can be used to

    automate transactions between farmers and purchasers in the agricultural industry,
    guaranteeing that both sides receive fair compensation and lowering

    the possibility of payment delays or disagreements. By enhancing transparency,
    e¨ciency, and sustainability throughout the supply chain, blockchain

    technology has the potential to fundamentally change the agricultural industry
    [20]. We may anticipate more e¨cient and sustainable agricultural

    practices, which will bene¦t farmers, consumers, and the environment as more producers,
    retailers, and farmers implement blockchain-based systems.

    III. OVERVIEW OF MACHINE LEARNING

    Machine learning (ML) is increasingly being used to improve agricultural practices,
    by enabling farmers and agriculture professionals to optimize operations,

    increase productivity, and reduce waste. The use of ML in agriculture can include
    tasks such as crop yield prediction, pest and disease detection, precision

    agriculture, and livestock management. By leveraging advanced algorithms and data
    analytics, ML is helping to revolutionize the agricultural sector, improving

    the e¨ciency and sustainability of food production. This is implemented using
    an optimization algorithm. Random Forest is a machine learning algorithm

    that can be used to enhance productivity in agriculture by analyzing large amounts
    of data and providing valuable insights into crop production. The

    algorithm works by creating multiple decision trees, each of which independently
    analyzes a subset of the data [21]. The results of these trees are then

    combined to make a more accurate prediction. Certainly, the following ¦ve categories
    are employed in agriculture to boost production using machine learning

    as shown below in Fig. 2:

    A brief overview of machine learning:

    The development of models to mimic human learning and decision-making can be credited
    with giving rise to machine learning in the 1940s and 1950s. The

    creation of the perceptron algorithm by Frank Rosenblatt in 1957 is one of the
    early instances of machine learning. A particular kind of arti¦cial neural network

    known as a perceptron was capable of learning to divide inputs into two categories
    using a set of weights and biases. The development of decision trees and

    rule-based systems in the 1960s and 1970s contributed to the advancement of machine
    learning research [22]. These techniques were used to create expert

    systems that can decide based on a set of guidelines and information. Machine
    learning began concentrating on statistical techniques and algorithms in the

    1980s and 1990s, like logistic regression and linear regression. Classi¦cation,
    regression, and clustering challenges all used these techniques. Machine

    learning regained prominence in the 2000s with the rise of big data and improvements
    in computing power [23]. Numerous new methods, including deep

    learning and reinforcement learning, have been created and used in a variety of
    ¦elds, such as autonomous cars, natural language processing, and picture

    identi¦cation. Machine learning is still a discipline that is quickly developing
    today, with new methods and programs being created and used in sectors

    including healthcare, ¦nance, and cyber security.

    Following are the steps that machine learning uses to operate:

    1. Data Gathering: Gathering pertinent data from diverse sources is the initial
    stage in machine learning. Depending on the issue at hand and the desired

    solution, this data may be presented in either structured or unstructured form.

    2. Data processing: After the data has been gathered, it must be prepared for
    analysis. To prepare the data for use by machine learning algorithms, the data

    must be cleaned, missing values must be removed, and any outliers must be removed.

    3. Feature extraction: The process of selecting and engineering relevant features
    from the data aims to provide new features that may be more advantageous

    for machine learning algorithms.

    4. Model Selection: After the data is ready, the type of problem being tackled
    is taken into consideration and a suitable machine learning technique is selected.

    supervised learning, unsupervised learning, and reinforcement learning are some
    examples of this.

    5. Training the Model: Using the prepared data, the selected machine learning
    method is then practiced. To reduce the error between the projected output and

    the actual output, the algorithm makes adjustments to its parameters as it learns
    from the data during training.

    6. Model Evaluation: After the model has been trained, its generalizability to
    fresh, unexplored data is assessed using a variety of performance criteria.

    7. Model tuning: Depending on the results of the evaluation, the performance of
    the model may need to be improved by modifying its hyper parameters or by

    employing a new algorithm.

    8. Model deployment: The model can be deployed in a production environment to
    make predictions on new data after it has been trained and tweaked.

    9. Monitoring and Maintenance: To ensure that machine learning models continue
    to perform well over time, it is necessary to monitor and maintain them.

    This entails keeping an eye out for data changes, frequently retraining the model,
    and making adjustments as necessary.

    Machine learning is an iterative process, thus when the model is created and applied,
    some steps might need to be repeated or improved. Depending on the

    type of problem being handled, numerous metrics can be used to assess how well
    machine learning models perform. The main objective of assessing a

    machine learning model''s performance is to ¦nd out how effectively it generalizes
    to new, untried data. Random Forest is a machine learning algorithm that

    can be used in agriculture to predict crop yield. It works by creating an ensemble
    of decision trees, where each tree is trained on a random subset of the data

    and a random subset of the features [24]. In the context of agriculture crop yielding,
    the algorithm can be used to predict the yield of a particular crop based on

    Page 8/20

    a variety of input variables such as weather patterns, soil quality, seed varieties,
    and management practices. To use the algorithm for crop yield prediction,

    historical data on crop yields and the corresponding input variables are used
    to train the model. Once the model is trained, it can be used to predict the yield
    of

    a new crop based on the input variables provided. The random forest algorithm
    is particularly useful for agriculture because it can handle a large number of

    input variables and can also capture complex interactions between the variables
    that may be di¨cult to identify using traditional statistical methods [25].

    Additionally, the algorithm is robust to noisy data and missing values, making
    it suitable for real-world agricultural data. Overall, the random forest algorithm

    can be a powerful

    tool for predicting crop yields in agriculture and can help farmers make informed
    decisions about crop management and resource allocation. Here are a few

    typical metrics for assessing machine learning models:

    Accuracy: This gauges the percentage of instances that were correctly classi¦ed
    out of all the instances. For classi¦cation issues, it is frequently

    employed.

    Precision is the percentage of all accurately identi¦ed positive instances (also
    known as true positives) among all positive predictions. It is bene¦cial in

    situations when the expense of false positives is large, like in medical diagnostics.

    Recall: In case you forgot, this quanti¦es the percentage of real positives among
    all positive results. It helps identify fraudulent transactions when the cost

    of false negatives is signi¦cant.

    F1 Score: When false positives and false negatives are equally essential, this
    score—which is the harmonic mean of precision and recall—is helpful.

    Mean Squared Error (MSE): For regression issues, this statistic is frequently
    utilized. The average squared difference between the expected and actual

    values is what is measured.

    Since it is expressed in the same units as the target variable, the Root Mean
    Squared Error (RMSE), which is the square root of the MSE, is a more

    understandable statistic.

    R-squared (R2): This indicator shows how much of the target variable''s variance
    the model can account for. A better ¦t is indicated by higher values,

    which range from 0 to 1.

    Depending on the problem being solved, it is crucial to utilize the right evaluation
    criteria when assessing a machine learning model''s performance. To make

    sure the model can generalize to new data, it''s also critical to assess the model''s
    performance on a different test set. The trade-off between model complexity

    and performance is also crucial to take into account because more complex models
    may over¦t training data while underperforming on fresh data [26].

    In general, machine learning models can be divided into three groups based on
    the kind of learning that they employ:

    Supervised Learning: In supervised learning, the target variable is known and
    the computer is trained on a labelled dataset. To make precise predictions

    on fresh, unforeseen data, the model must learn the link between the input features
    and the target variable.

    Unsupervised Learning: In unsupervised learning, the goal variable is unknown
    and the machine is trained on an unlabelled dataset. The model''s objective

    is to identify structures, correlations, and patterns in the data without receiving
    any direct instruction or feedback.

    Reinforcement Learning: In reinforcement learning, a machine learns by doing things
    incorrectly, interacting with its environment, and receiving feedback

    in the form of rewards or punishments. The ideal policy, which maximizes the cumulative
    reward over time, is what the model seeks to learn. In robots,

    video games, and control systems, this kind of learning is frequently employed.

    The following categories are used to enhance productivity in agricultural sectors
    evolving machine learning techniques:

    Crop prediction: Choosing which crops to grow, when to plant them, and how to
    maximize their production all depend on crop prediction, which is a crucial

    component of agriculture. To ¦nd trends and create precise predictions, machine
    learning (ML) approaches have shown considerable promise in the ¦eld of

    crop forecasting. The gathering and pre-processing of data is the ¦rst stage in
    crop prediction using ML. This entails compiling information on many

    elements, such as weather patterns, soil quality, and the type of crop planted,
    that may have an impact on crop development [27]. The data is then pre-

    processed to clean out any errors or noise and to make sure that it is in a format
    that ML algorithms can use. The pre-processed data is then subjected to ML

    algorithms to ¦nd patterns and generate predictions. Several ML methods, such
    as decision trees, random forests, support vector machines (SVM), and

    arti¦cial neural networks, can be applied to crop prediction. (ANN). Each algorithm
    has its advantages and disadvantages, and the best one to use depends on

    the particulars of the problem at hand. The ML algorithm can be used to generate
    predictions on new data after being trained on existing data. For instance, a

    farmer can input information on the weather, soil quality, and other parameters
    to predict the yield of a speci¦c crop in a given season, and the ML algorithm

    will then do so [28]. The ability to maximize crop yield and minimize waste is
    one of the main advantages of utilizing ML for crop prediction. ML algorithms

    can detect the ideal circumstances for crop growth and suggest adjustments to
    planting plans, irrigation schedules, and other practices to maximize yield by

    analysing data on the elements that affect crop growth. The ability to lower the
    risk of crop failure for farmers is another advantage of utilizing ML for crop

    prediction. Farmers can take proactive steps to minimize or lessen the impact
    of crop failure by utilizing pest-resistant crops or modifying planting dates
    by

    forecasting the possibility of crop failure based on factors such as weather conditions,
    soil quality, and disease outbreaks. In conclusion, crop prediction using

    machine learning has the potential to completely transform the agricultural industry
    by empowering farmers to make data-driven decisions that maximize

    crop output and minimize risk [29]. To accurately anticipate crop production and
    assist farmers in choosing planting techniques, irrigation schedules, and

    other practices that in§uence crop growth, machine learning (ML) systems analyse
    vast volumes of data and look for trends. It is expected that ML technology

    will become more and more signi¦cant as it develops in agriculture and other sectors
    of the economy.

    Plant disease detection: Farmers and the agriculture sector are very concerned
    about plant diseases. They can lower crop quality and result in considerable

    yield losses, which might result in ¦nancial losses. To reduce these losses, early
    plant disease detection and prevention are essential. To forecast plant

    Page 9/20

    diseases and provide prompt intervention to stop their spread, machine learning
    approaches can be helpful. Data collection is the ¦rst step in the machine

    learning process used to predict plant diseases. This entails gathering information
    on the plant species, its growth stage, the type of disease, and climatic

    factors including temperature, humidity, and rainfall. Sensors, drones, satellite
    photography, and human observation can all be used to gather data [30]. Once

    the data is collected, it is pre-processed to remove noise, handle missing values,
    and normalize the data. Feature engineering is then performed to extract

    relevant features from the data that can be used to train the machine learning
    model. The extracted features may include plant morphology, texture, color, and

    shape, as well as environmental factors such as temperature and humidity. Various
    machine learning algorithms can be used for plant disease prediction,

    including decision trees, random forests, support vector machines, and deep learning
    models such as convolutional neural networks. The choice of algorithm

    depends on the size and complexity of the dataset and the accuracy required for
    prediction. The trained model is then tested on a separate dataset to evaluate

    its accuracy and performance. This is done by splitting the data into training
    and testing sets, with the majority of the data used for training the model and
    a

    smaller subset used for testing. A map displaying the location and severity of
    the disease or an alert system notifying farmers when the sickness is found are

    just two examples of how the model''s results can be displayed to the user. Using
    this knowledge, preventive steps can then be taken, such as applying

    fungicides or removing affected plants [31]. Machine learning- based plant disease
    prediction has several advantages over conventional disease detection

    techniques. By enabling early illness identi¦cation, it can lessen the need for
    expensive and time-consuming manual checks. Additionally, it can assist farmers

    in deciding when and where to apply fungicides and other

    treatments, minimizing the amount of chemicals needed and the negative effects
    on the environment. In conclusion, predicting plant diseases using machine

    learning is a potential strategy that can help to lower crop losses and improve
    agricultural practices. The right machine learning algorithms must be chosen,

    together with careful data gathering, pre-processing, and feature engineering.
    Machine learning can deliver precise and timely predictions of plant illnesses

    with the correct methods and equipment, allowing farmers to take preventative
    measures to save their crops [32]. In conclusion, predicting plant diseases

    using machine learning is a potential strategy that can help to lower crop losses
    and improve agricultural practices. The right machine learning algorithms

    must be chosen, together with careful data gathering, pre- processing, and feature
    engineering. Utilizing the appropriate methods and resources, machine

    learning.

    Weed detection: Weed detection using machine learning is a rapidly developing
    ¦eld that has the potential to revolutionize the way we manage agriculture. In

    traditional agriculture, weed management is time- consuming and labour-intensive,
    often requiring the use of herbicides, which can have negative

    environmental impacts. Machine learning-based weed detection offers an alternative
    solution, using computer vision and machine learning algorithms to

    identify and map weeds in real time. One of the key advantages of machine learning-based
    weed detection is its ability to process large amounts of data

    quickly and accurately. This is achieved by training machine learning algorithms
    on large datasets of images of crops and weeds [33]. These datasets are

    typically labelled to identify which pixels correspond to crops and which correspond
    to weeds, allowing the machine learning algorithm to learn to distinguish

    between the two. The training data is fed into a machine learning model, which
    then uses this data to create a model that can recognize patterns in new

    images. When new images of crops are input into the model, the machine learning
    algorithm can quickly identify which pixels correspond to weeds and which

    correspond to crops. This information can then be used to create a map of weed
    distribution across a ¦eld. Several challenges must be addressed when

    developing a machine learning-based weed detection system. One of the key challenges
    is ensuring that the system is robust to changes in lighting conditions

    and other environmental factors. This can be achieved by using a combination of
    image processing techniques and machine learning algorithms to pre-

    process images before they are input into the weed detection model [34]. Another
    challenge is ensuring that the system can generalize to new images that it

    has not seen before. This can be achieved by using a combination of data augmentation
    techniques and transfer learning, which involves using a pre-trained

    model as a starting point for training a new model on a smaller dataset. Several
    different types of machine learning algorithms can be used for weed

    detection, including convolutional neural networks (CNNs), support vector machines
    (SVMs), and decision trees. Each of these algorithms has its strengths

    and weaknesses, and the choice of algorithm will depend on the speci¦c requirements
    of the application [35]. In conclusion, weed detection using machine

    learning has the potential to revolutionize agriculture by providing a fast, accurate,
    and environmentally friendly alternative to traditional weed management

    techniques. While there are still several challenges that must be addressed, advances
    in computer vision and machine learning are making this technology

    increasingly accessible to farmers and researchers alike.

    Crop yield prediction: Crop yield prediction is a crucial task in agriculture
    as it helps farmers and agricultural experts to make informed decisions about
    crop

    production, resource management, and market supply. Traditionally, crop yield
    prediction has been done using various statistical models and methods, but

    with the recent advancements in machine learning, it has become possible to predict
    crop yields more accurately using data-driven approaches. Machine

    learning has proven to be a valuable tool in agriculture and has the potential
    to revolutionize the industry by making it more e¨cient and sustainable. The

    main objective of crop yield prediction using machine learning is to develop models
    that can accurately estimate the yield of a particular crop in a speci¦c

    area based on various factors such as weather conditions, soil properties, and
    agricultural practices. Machine learning models for crop yield prediction

    typically use large datasets of historical weather and crop data to train the
    model and make predictions for the future. One of the most common approaches

    for crop yield prediction is supervised learning, where the model is trained using
    labelled data, which includes both input features (such as temperature,

    rainfall, and soil type) and

    the corresponding crop yield. Supervised learning algorithms such as regression,
    decision trees, and neural networks are commonly used for crop yield

    prediction [36]. These algorithms can learn the relationship between the input
    features and the output variable (crop yield) and make accurate predictions for

    new data. Another approach for crop yield prediction is unsupervised learning,
    where the model is trained on unlabelled data to identify patterns and

    relationships in the data. Clustering algorithms such as k-means clustering and
    hierarchical clustering are commonly used in unsupervised learning for crop

    yield prediction. These algorithms can group similar data points based on their
    characteristics and help identify areas with similar crop yield patterns. In recent

    years, deep learning algorithms such as convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and
    recurrent neural networks (RNNs) have been applied to crop yield

    prediction. CNNs are particularly useful for analysing spatial data such as satellite
    images to identify crop types, growth stages, and yield potential [37]. RNNs

    are well-suited for time series data such as historical weather data, which can
    be used to predict future weather patterns and their impact on crop yields.

    Page 10/20

    One of the key challenges in crop yield prediction using machine learning is the
    availability and quality of data. Historical weather and crop data may not be

    readily available or may be incomplete, making it di¨cult to train accurate models.
    Moreover, the data may be biased or outdated, leading to inaccurate

    predictions. Another challenge is the interpretation of the machine learning models,
    which can be complex and di¨cult to understand for non-experts.

    Therefore, it is important to have a clear understanding of the data and the machine
    learning models used for crop yield prediction. In conclusion, crop yield

    prediction using machine learning is a promising approach to improving the e¨ciency
    and sustainability of agriculture. With the right data and machine

    learning models, it is possible to accurately predict crop yields and make informed
    decisions about crop production and resource management. However, there

    are challenges in data availability, model interpretation, and practical implementation
    that need to be addressed to fully realize the potential of machine

    learning in agriculture.

    Farm management: Farm management is a complex process that involves numerous tasks,
    such as planting, harvesting, pest control, and irrigation, among

    others. With the advent of machine learning and arti¦cial intelligence, farmers
    can use technology to optimize their operations and improve their yield.

    Machine learning is a subset of arti¦cial intelligence that enables computer systems
    to learn from data and make predictions or decisions based on that data.

    In the context of farm management, machine learning can be used to analyze various
    data sources, including weather patterns, soil conditions, and crop

    growth, among others. One way in which machine learning can be used in farm management
    is by analysing satellite imagery to monitor crop health and

    growth. By analyzing changes in vegetation density and color, machine learning
    algorithms can predict crop yields, identify areas of the farm that require

    attention, and provide recommendations for irrigation and fertilization [38].
    Another application of machine learning in farm management is in predicting

    weather patterns and their impact on crop growth. By analyzing historical weather
    data and current weather patterns, machine learning algorithms can predict

    future weather patterns and provide farmers with recommendations on how to adjust
    their operations to minimize the impact of adverse weather conditions.

    In addition, machine learning can be used to optimize irrigation and fertilization
    schedules by analyzing soil data and plant growth patterns. By analyzing the

    nutrient content of the soil and the growth rate of the plants, machine learning
    algorithms can provide farmers with recommendations on the optimal amount

    and timing of irrigation and fertilization. Machine learning can also be used
    to predict pest and disease outbreaks and provide farmers with recommendations

    on how to prevent or mitigate them [39]. By analyzing historical data on pest
    and disease outbreaks, as well as current weather and soil conditions, machine

    learning algorithms can predict the likelihood of an outbreak and provide farmers
    with recommendations on how to prevent or mitigate it. In conclusion,

    machine learning has the potential to revolutionize farm management by providing
    farmers with valuable insights and recommendations on how to optimize

    their operations and improve their yield. By analyzing various data sources, including
    weather patterns, soil conditions, and crop growth, machine learning

    algorithms can provide farmers with

    recommendations on irrigation, fertilization, pest control, and other key aspects
    of farm management, enabling them to make more informed decisions and

    improve their bottom line [40]. There are several advantages of using machine
    learning in agriculture, some of which include:

    Increased E¨ciency: Machine learning algorithms can help farmers and other agriculture
    stakeholders optimize their operations by reducing the time and

    effort required to perform tasks such as crop monitoring, disease detection, and
    yield forecasting. This can help to increase overall e¨ciency and reduce

    costs.

    Improved Crop Yields: Machine learning algorithms can help farmers predict crop
    yields by analyzing a wide range of data, including weather patterns, soil

    moisture, and historical crop yields. By predicting yields more accurately, farmers
    can make better decisions about when to plant and harvest crops, leading to

    increased yields.

    Enhanced Resource Management: Machine learning algorithms can help farmers manage
    resources such as water, fertilizer, and pesticides more e¨ciently.

    By analyzing data on crop growth and soil conditions, these algorithms can optimize
    resource usage, reducing waste and maximizing productivity.

    Early Disease Detection: Machine learning algorithms can analyze data from sensors
    and other sources to detect signs of plant diseases early. This allows

    farmers to take proactive measures to prevent the spread of disease, minimizing
    the impact on crop yields.

    Precision Agriculture: Machine learning can help farmers to target speci¦c areas
    of their ¦elds that require more attention, allowing for more precise

    application of resources such as fertilizer and pesticides. This can reduce waste
    and improve overall crop health.

    Overall, the use of machine learning in agriculture has the potential to revolutionize
    the way that crops are grown and managed, leading to more e¨cient,

    sustainable, and productive farming practices.

    IV. PERFORMANCE ANALYSIS OF THE PROPOSED SYSTEM

    The proposed system involves machine learning with random forest optimization
    to detect various parameters such as crop yield, disease prediction, weed

    detection, etc. The proposed system is shown in ¦gure 3.

    1. Data gathering: Data gathering is an essential step in machine learning, and
    it is particularly crucial when building a model to detect crop yield using the

    random forest algorithm. The quality and quantity of data used to train the model
    can signi¦cantly affect its accuracy and ability to make accurate

    predictions. To gather data for crop yield detection using random forests, one
    must collect data on various environmental factors that affect crop growth and

    yield, such as soil type, temperature, rainfall, sunlight, and fertilizers used.
    The data must be collected from different farms, regions, and seasons to ensure
    a

    diverse dataset. Once the data is collected, it must be preprocessed, cleaned,
    and prepared for training the random forest model. The dataset should be split

    into training, validation, and testing sets to prevent over¦tting and ensure the
    model''s generalizability. The random forest algorithm is a powerful tool for
    crop

    yield detection as it can handle high- dimensional datasets with non-linear relationships
    between variables. It works by creating multiple decision trees and

    combining them to make predictions. Each tree is trained on a random subset of
    the features and a subset of the training data to reduce the risk of over¦tting

    Page 11/20

    [41]. Overall, data gathering is a critical step in machine learning using the
    random forest algorithm to detect crop yield. By collecting high-quality and diverse

    data, preprocessing it, and training the model, we can accurately predict crop
    yield and optimize farming practices for improved crop production. The predicted

    data set is observed from a village to detect the crop yield as shown in ¦gure
    4. At the settlement, the information is taken into account as latitude varies
    from

    place to place. To operate the system, information on the crop, the climate in
    a speci¦c village, and the region are three necessary elements.

    1. Data processing: In machine learning, data processing is a critical stage that
    involves transforming raw data into a format that can be easily analysed by

    algorithms. The data processing stage typically includes several steps, such as
    data cleaning, data transformation, feature extraction, and data splitting. Data

    cleaning involves removing any irrelevant or duplicate data, correcting errors,
    and handling missing data. Data transformation involves scaling, normalizing,
    or

    encoding the data to ensure that it is in a standardized format. Feature extraction
    involves selecting the most relevant features that have a strong correlation

    with the target variable [42]. After completing these steps, the data is usually
    divided into training, validation, and testing sets. The training set is used
    to train

    the machine learning model, while the validation set is used to evaluate the model''s
    performance during training. Finally, the testing set is used to evaluate the

    model''s performance on unseen data. Overall, the data processing stage is essential
    for ensuring the quality of the data and the accuracy of the machine

    learning model [43]. Proper data processing can lead to better model performance,
    faster training times, and more accurate predictions. The testing and

    training phase is implemented in Matlab as shown below:

    2. Feature extraction: A crucial stage in machine learning is feature extraction,
    which entails choosing and manipulating pertinent information from raw data

    to produce instructive features for predictive models. Features like soil type,
    weather patterns, and crop health can all be identi¦ed and studied using feature

    extraction techniques to increase production in agriculture [44]. Some common
    techniques for feature extraction in agriculture include:

    Remote sensing: Using satellites or drones to capture images of crop ¦elds, which
    can then be analysed to extract features such as vegetation index,

    crop growth stage, and soil moisture.

    Sensor data: Collect data from sensors such as soil moisture sensors, temperature
    sensors, and weather stations to extract features such as

    temperature, humidity, rainfall, and soil nutrients.

    Data fusion: Combining data from multiple sources, such as remote sensing and
    sensor data, to create more informative features for predictive modelling.

    Data pre-processing: Transforming raw data into more useful features, such as
    scaling, normalization, and dimensionality reduction techniques. By using

    feature extraction techniques in agriculture, machine learning models can be trained
    to predict crop yields, identify areas for improvement, and optimize

    resource allocation, leading to improved productivity and pro¦tability for farmers.

    3. Model selection: Model selection is an important step in machine learning in
    agriculture to improve productivity. It involves choosing the most appropriate

    machine learning algorithm and model for a speci¦c agricultural problem. Here
    are some key considerations for model selection in agriculture:

    Data quality: The quality and quantity of data available are critical for selecting
    an

    appropriate machine learning algorithm and model. Ensure that the data is representative, unbiased, and of high quality.

    Complexity: Agricultural systems can be complex, with many variables and interactions. Consider the
    complexity of the problem when selecting a model.

    Simple models such as linear regression may work for simple problems, while more
    complex models such as neural networks or decision trees may be needed

    for more complex problems. Interpretability: Interpretability is important in agriculture, as it allows for the understanding of the model''s decision-

    making process. More interpretable models, such as decision trees, may be preferred
    over less interpretable models such as neural networks.

    Performance: The performance of the model is a key consideration. Evaluate the model''s performance
    using appropriate metrics such as accuracy, precision,

    recall, and F1 score. Consider the trade-off between model performance and interpretability.

    Scalability: Consider the scalability of the model, as agricultural systems often
    involve large amounts of data. Models that can handle large volumes of data,

    such as deep learning models, may be preferred. Overall, selecting the right machine
    learning model can help improve agricultural productivity by enabling

    better decision-making, predicting crop yields, detecting disease outbreaks, and
    optimizing resource allocation. Here random forest algorithm is initiated to

    enhance productivity.

    4. Optimization algorithm: Random Forest is a machine-learning algorithm that
    can be used for classi¦cation and regression tasks. While it can be applied to

    various ¦elds, including agriculture, it is not speci¦cally designed to extract
    maximum yield in agriculture. That being said, Random Forests can be used in

    agriculture to make predictions based on input variables such as soil type, weather
    conditions, and crop variety. For example, a Random Forest model could be

    Page 12/20

    trained to predict crop yield based on factors such as temperature, rainfall,
    soil pH, and fertilizer application rates. The model could then be used to optimize

    crop management decisions, such as adjusting irrigation schedules, choosing optimal
    planting dates, and selecting the most effective fertilizers and

    pesticides. To train a Random Forest model for agricultural applications, data
    must ¦rst be collected and pre-processed [45]. This might involve gathering data

    on crop yield, weather conditions, soil properties, and other relevant factors
    from past growing seasons. Once the data is collected, it can be split into training

    and testing sets to evaluate the performance of the model. The Random Forest algorithm
    works by creating a multitude of decision trees, each trained on a

    subset of the data. The algorithm randomly selects a subset of the available features
    at each split point, which helps to reduce over¦tting and improve

    generalization. During training, the algorithm measures the accuracy of each decision
    tree on the training set and uses this information to build a consensus

    model that combines the predictions of all the trees as shown below:

    In this code, we ¦rst load the dataset and split it into training and testing
    sets using the divider and function. The optimized hyperparameters (x_opt) are
    used

    to train the ¦nal random forest model using the TreeBagger function. The model
    is then used to predict the test set and the accuracy of the model is calculated

    as the RMSE. Note that this code assumes that the crop_yield_data.mat ¦le contains
    a matrix X of features and a vector y of corresponding yields. The

    hyperparameters being optimized are the minimum leaf size (x(1)), the number of
    variables to sample (x(2)), and the maximum number of splits (x(3)). Once

    the model is trained, it can be used to predict crop yield based on input variables
    such as weather data and soil properties [46]. The accuracy of the model can

    be evaluated using the testing set, and adjustments can be made to improve its
    performance. In summary, Random Forests can be used in agriculture to

    predict crop yield and optimize management decisions. To train a Random Forest
    model for agricultural applications, data must be collected and pre-

    processed, and the model must be evaluated using a testing set as represented
    in ¦gure 5.

    5. Model evaluation: The model evaluation process in machine learning (ML) involves
    assessing the performance of a trained model on a set of test data to

    determine its accuracy, precision, recall, and other evaluation metrics. In the
    context of agriculture, one popular ML algorithm is the Random Forest algorithm,

    which is commonly used for tasks such as crop yield prediction, pest detection,
    and soil quality assessment. Here is a step-by-step process for evaluating a

    Random Forest model in agriculture:

    Collect and preprocess data: Collect data related to the agricultural problem
    at hand, such as soil data, weather data, crop growth data, etc. Preprocess

    the data by removing missing values, scaling features, and converting categorical variables into
    numeric form.

    Split the data: Split the preprocessed data into two parts: training data and
    test data. The training data is used to train the Random Forest model, while the
    test

    data is used to evaluate the model''s performance.

    Train the model: Train the Random Forest model on the training data. The model
    should be tuned to obtain the best results.

    Test the model: Test the model on the test data. The test data should be completely
    separate from the training data to avoid bias.

    Evaluate the model: Evaluate the performance of the model using various evaluation
    metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, confusion matrix,

    etc. These metrics will provide insight into how well the model is performing
    and whether it is suitable for the given agricultural problem. Adjust the model: 

    Based on the evaluation results, adjust the model parameters or the preprocessing
    steps to improve the model''s performance.

    Finalize the model: After obtaining satisfactory results, ¦nalize the model and
    deploy it for practical use. Overall, the model evaluation process in MI using

    Random Forest in agriculture involves collecting and preprocessing data, splitting
    it into training and test data, training and testing the model, evaluating its

    performance using various metrics, and adjusting the model as needed to achieve
    optimal results.

    Page 13/20

    6. Performance analysis and outcome: The proposed system is applied in Matlab
    Simulink to assess the optimum results as demonstrated in ¦gure 6.

    The confusion matrix is a performance evaluation tool that is widely used in machine
    learning to measure the accuracy of a model''s predictions. In the context

    of a random forest algorithm for agricultural yield enhancement, a confusion matrix
    can be used to evaluate the accuracy of the model in predicting crop yield

    based on a set of input variables such as soil type, weather conditions, and crop
    variety. 

    The confusion matrix is a table that summarizes the performance of a classi¦cation
    model by comparing the actual and predicted values [47]. 

    It consists of four different components: true positive (TP), true negative (TN),
    false positive (FP), and false negative (FN1).

    In the context of agricultural yield enhancement, these components can be de¦ned
    as follows:

    True positive (TP): The number of times the model correctly predicted a high-yield crop when the
    actual yield was high.

    True negative (TN): The number of times the model correctly predicted a low-yield crop when the
    actual yield was low.

    False positive (FP): The number of times the model incorrectly predicted a high-yield crop when the
    actual yield was low.

    False negative (FN): The number of times the model incorrectly predicted a low-yield crop when the
    actual yield was high.

    The confusion matrix can be used to calculate several performance metrics for
    the model, such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. These metrics can

    provide insights into how well the model is performing and can help identify areas
    for improvement.

    V. COMPARATIVE ANALYSIS

    Algorithm description

    CNN

    The Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) algorithm has shown great potential in
    various ¦elds, including agriculture crop yield prediction.

    CNNs can learn complex patterns and relationships in high- dimensional data, making
    them suitable for analyzing crop images and

    predicting yield. In agriculture crop yield prediction, CNNs are used to analyze
    crop images captured by drones or other aerial vehicles. The

    images are pre-processed and then fed into the CNN to extract features and learn
    patterns. The CNN then makes predictions on the yield

    based on the features extracted from the images [48]. CNNs have been used to predict
    crop yields for various crops, including maize, wheat,

    and rice. The predictions made by CNNs are accurate and reliable and can help
    farmers make informed decisions about crop management.

    Overall, CNNs have the potential to revolutionize agriculture by providing accurate
    crop yield predictions, which can help farmers optimize

    crop management practices and increase crop yields.

    SVM

    Support Vector Machines (SVM) is a machine learning algorithm that can be used
    in agriculture to predict crop yield. SVM is a supervised

    learning technique that is used for classi¦cation and regression analysis. It
    works by ¦nding the best decision boundary that separates the

    data points into different classes or predicts the value of the target variable.
    In agriculture, SVM can be used to predict crop yield based on

    various input features such as soil quality, weather conditions, and farming practices.
    The algorithm can analyze these features and create

    a model that can predict the crop yield for a given set of input data [49]. The
    use of SVM in agriculture can help farmers make informed

    decisions about planting and harvesting crops. By analyzing historical data, SVM
    can predict the optimal time to plant a crop, the best

    fertilizers to use, and the ideal harvesting time. This can help farmers increase
    their crop yields and reduce the risk of crop failure.

    RNN

    Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) is a type of deep learning algorithm that can be
    used in agriculture to predict crop yields. RNNs are

    particularly useful for time-series data, where the data points are collected
    at regular intervals, such as daily or monthly. In agriculture, RNNs

    can be used to analyze a variety of factors that affect crop yields, including
    weather patterns, soil moisture, and fertilizer usage. By

    analyzing this data over time, RNNs can identify patterns and make predictions
    about future crop yields.

    RNNs work by processing inputs sequentially, with each new input being in§uenced
    by the previous inputs [50]. This allows the model to

    capture the temporal dependencies between the data points, which is important
    in time-series analysis. The output of an RNN is a prediction

    of the next value in the sequence. Overall, the use of RNN algorithms in agriculture
    can help farmers make more informed decisions about

    when to plant and harvest their crops, as well as how much fertilizer to apply
    and how often to water their crops. By predicting crop yields

    more accurately, farmers can increase their productivity and pro¦tability, while
    also reducing waste and environmental impact.

    Regression

    algorithm

    To forecast crop yield, regression methods can be employed in agriculture. These
    algorithms can examine several variables that affect

    agricultural output, including weather patterns, soil quality, and fertilizer
    application rates. The program analyses past crop yield data as

    well as data on the variables that affect crop output to forecast crop yield in
    the future. Farmers may enhance crop yields and decrease

    waste by using this data to drive their decisions about when to plant, how much
    fertilizer to use, and when to harvest. Regression algorithms

    are useful for forecasting crop yields, and modern agriculture is using them more
    frequently.

    kNN

    The k-Nearest Neighbors (kNN) algorithm is a machine learning technique used to
    classify data based on similarity measures. In agriculture,

    kNN can be used to predict crop yields by analyzing historical data on crop yields
    and environmental factors such as temperature, rainfall,

    and soil nutrient levels. To use the kNN algorithm in agriculture crop yield prediction,
    the ¦rst step is to gather relevant data on past crop

    yields and environmental factors for a given region. This data can be used to
    train the algorithm and create a model that can predict future

    crop yields based on new environmental data. Once the model is trained, it can
    be used to predict crop yields for a speci¦c location by

    comparing its environmental data to the historical data in the training set. The
    kNN algorithm identi¦es the k-nearest neighbors to the new

    data point and assigns a yield prediction based on the average yield of those
    neighbors. Using the kNN algorithm in agriculture crop yield

    prediction can help farmers optimize their crop production by providing accurate
    predictions of future crop yields. This information can be

    used to adjust crop management practices and make informed decisions about crop
    selection and planting schedules.

    Table I denotes the classi¦cation of the machine learning algorithm.

    Table II determines the crop yield prediction using various machine learning algorithms
    to obtain the optimum results. This shows that the random forest

    algorithm helps to obtain the optimum results. Numerous challenges in agriculture
    have been successfully solved using random forest algorithms. They are

    favored over many other algorithms for a variety of reasons.

    First of all, farmers can make better decisions because of random forest algorithms''
    high accuracy, which is crucial in agriculture. Farmers can properly

    forecast crop yields, spot disease outbreaks, and make better- informed decisions
    about irrigation and fertilizer use by employing random forest algorithms.

    Secondly, random forest algorithms are highly robust to outliers, noise, and missing
    data. This is particularly important in agriculture, where data can be noisy

    and incomplete due to various factors like weather conditions, soil quality, and
    pest attacks.

    Thirdly, random forest algorithms provide feature importance, which means that
    they can identify the most important variables that in§uence the outcome of

    a particular problem. This is helpful in agriculture, where farmers can use this
    information to focus their efforts on the most critical variables.

    Finally, random forest algorithms are scalable and can handle large datasets,
    making them suitable for agriculture, where large amounts of data are generated

    from various sources.

    Overall, the high accuracy, robustness, feature importance, and scalability of
    random forest algorithms make them an excellent choice for solving problems in

    agriculture.

    Future trends of AI in agriculture:

    The future of agriculture is being shaped by arti¦cial intelligence (AI) and machine
    learning (ML) technologies. These technologies have the potential to

    revolutionize the industry by improving crop yields, reducing waste, and making
    farming more e¨cient and sustainable One trend that is expected to gain

    traction is precision farming. By using AI and ML algorithms, farmers can monitor
    crop health, water usage, and soil quality in real-time, enabling them to

    make data-driven decisions and optimize resource allocation. This can lead to
    higher yields, lower costs, and reduced environmental impact. Another trend is

    the development of autonomous farming equipment. Self-driving tractors and other
    machines equipped with AI and ML algorithms can navigate ¦elds, detect

    and remove weeds, and plant crops with precision, reducing the need for human
    labor and increasing e¨ciency. AI-powered predictive analytics is also

    expected to play a signi¦cant role in agriculture. By analyzing historical data
    and real-time weather and soil conditions, farmers can predict crop yields and

    identify potential issues before they become signi¦cant problems. Overall, AI
    and ML technologies have the potential to transform agriculture, making it more

    sustainable, e¨cient, and productive. As these technologies continue to develop
    and become more accessible, they will help farmers address the challenges of

    feeding a growing global population while protecting the environment.

    VI. CONCLUSION

    Using machine learning in agriculture with optimization aims to raise crop yields,
    decrease resource waste, and boost farmer pro¦tability. For the best planting,

    irrigation, fertilization, and pest management practices, machine learning models
    can analyze a signi¦cant quantity of data on crop development, soil

    characteristics, weather patterns, and other factors. The agricultural process
    can be further enhanced by introducing optimization algorithms into the machine

    learning models to discover the optimum solutions to issues like crop rotation,
    water management, and harvesting schedules. This may result in less waste,

    more effective use of resources, and eventually higher yields and more pro¦tability
    for farmers. Overall, using machine learning and optimization in agriculture

    can help farmers overcome some of the di¨culties they encounter, including the
    need to produce more food with fewer resources and the rising need for

    sustainable farming methods.

    \ \nDr.Sahar Mohamed Ismail Ahmed \nAssociate Professor - Desert Research Centre\
    \ - Egypt \n \nAbstract: \n        Access to Information: Technology provides\
    \ small farmers with access to valuable \ninformation and knowledge. Through the\
    \ internet, mobile applications, and online \nplatforms, farmers can access weather\
    \ forecasts, market prices, agricultural practices, and \ncrop management techniques.\
    \ This information enables them to make informed decisions, \nadopt best practices,\
    \ and optimize their farming operations. Precision Farming: Precision \nfarming\
    \ technologies, such as Global Positioning System (GPS), Geographic Information\
    \ \nSystem (GIS), and remote sensing, help small farmers optimize resource use\
    \ and improve \ncrop yields. These technologies enable precise field mapping,\
    \ soil analysis, and \nmonitoring of crop health, allowing farmers to apply fertilizers,\
    \ water, and other inputs \nonly where and when needed. This reduces resource\
    \ wastage, enhances efficiency, and \nminimizes environmental impact. \n     \
    \     Farm Management Software: Farm management software and mobile applications\
    \ \nassist small farmers in managing their operations more effectively. These\
    \ tools help with \nrecord keeping, financial management, inventory tracking,\
    \ and farm planning. By \nautomating administrative tasks and providing real-time\
    \ data, farmers can streamline their \nprocesses, monitor performance, and make\
    \ data-driven decisions. Mobile Technology: \nMobile phones and applications have\
    \ transformed agricultural practices for small farmers. \nThey enable farmers\
    \ to access agricultural information, receive alerts on weather \nconditions,\
    \ market prices, and pest outbreaks. Mobile technology also facilitates \ncommunication\
    \ and networking among farmers, allowing them to share knowledge, learn \nfrom\
    \ each other, and access extension services remotely. \n           Agricultural\
    \ Machinery and Equipment: Technology has improved the availability \nand effectiveness\
    \ of agricultural machinery and equipment, even for small-scale farmers. \nSmall\
    \ agricultural projects can benefit from compact and affordable machinery, such\
    \ as \nmini-tractors, tillers, planters, and harvesters, which help increase productivity,\
    \ reduce \nlabor requirements, and improve overall efficiency. Irrigation Systems:\

    \ – 21 \n \n \n \n \n2 \n \nadvanced irrigation systems, making them more efficient\
    \ and accessible for small farmers. \nDrip irrigation, sprinkler systems, and\
    \ sensor-based irrigation technologies enable precise \nwater application, reducing\
    \ water wastage and increasing water-use efficiency. This is \nespecially beneficial\
    \ in areas with water scarcity or unreliable rainfall patterns. \nPost-Harvest\
    \ Technologies: Post-harvest losses are a significant challenge for small \nfarmers.\
    \ Technology offers solutions to mitigate these losses by improving storage, \n\
    processing, and value addition. Technologies such as solar dryers, cold storage\
    \ facilities, \nand packaging innovations help extend the shelf life of produce,\
    \ reduce spoilage, and \nincrease the market value of agricultural products. \n\
    E-commerce and Market Access: Technology has opened up new avenues for small \n\
    farmers to access markets and sell their produce. E-commerce platforms, online\
    \ \nmarketplaces, and mobile applications connect farmers directly with buyers,\
    \ eliminating \nintermediaries and enabling fairer prices. This improves market\
    \ access, reduces \ntransaction costs, and creates opportunities for small farmers\
    \ to reach a wider customer \nbase. \nKeywords: Collaboration-Networking-Financing-Remote\

    \  \n            Access to information about the role of technology in small agricultural\
    \ projects is \ncrucial for farmers to understand and utilize the available technological\
    \ solutions \neffectively. Agricultural Extension Services: Agricultural extension\
    \ services, provided by \ngovernment agencies or agricultural universities, offer\
    \ information and training to \nfarmers. These services often include guidance\
    \ on the use of technology in agriculture and \nprovide resources such as pamphlets,\
    \ workshops, and demonstrations. Online Resources \nand Websites: Numerous websites\
    \ and online platforms focus on agriculture and \ntechnology. These platforms\
    \ provide information, articles, guides, and case studies related \nto the role\
    \ of technology in small agricultural projects. Some reliable sources include\
    \ \nagricultural research institutes, government websites, and agricultural extension\
    \ websites. \n        Mobile Applications: There are mobile applications specifically\

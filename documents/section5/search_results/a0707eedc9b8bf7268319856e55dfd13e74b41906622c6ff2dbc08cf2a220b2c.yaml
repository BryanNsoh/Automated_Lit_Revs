    crop model Article Open access 14 February 2024 Introduction Climate change, drought,
    and the overexploitation of water resources have led to declines in freshwater
    storage in many vital agricultural regions1, raising concerns surrounding the
    future of food and water security2,3. Irrigation constitutes the largest use of
    freshwater globally4,5, and many regions will need to decrease their agricultural
    water use while maintaining high levels of production to ensure a sustainable
    food and water supply as the population grows6. Proposed options for reducing
    water use include leaving lands fallow, switching to less water-intensive crops,
    adopting water-saving farming practices such as deficit irrigation, and improving
    irrigation efficiency7,8. However, any approach to reducing agricultural water
    use depends on the challenging task of characterizing the amount of water crops
    consume9. While it is possible to monitor volumes of water withdrawn for irrigation,
    this is a poor proxy for the amount of water crops consume through evapotranspiration
    (ET)10. Only some irrigation water results in ET: the rest remains in the system
    as runoff or recharge, though this proportion can vary widely depending on topography,
    climate, soil type, and farming practices11. Agricultural ET, or the increase
    in ET that irrigated agriculture brings, is therefore a critical measure in that
    it represents the amount of water that is actually “consumed” by agriculture.
    This water leaves the watershed entirely as it is evaporated from the soil and
    transpired by crops4. Since agricultural ET represents agricultural water consumption,
    it is key for gauging the potential of fallowing, crop switching, or other farming
    practices to save water12. When compared to total irrigation amounts, agricultural
    ET can also be used to highlight the fraction of irrigation withdrawals that do
    not effectively result in consumptive use13. While this water stays in the system
    and therefore may continue to provide beneficial uses14, it also does not achieve
    its original purpose of contributing to crop growth. Therefore, agricultural ET
    can help calculate irrigation efficiency and identify unnecessary irrigation water
    withdrawals from surface or groundwater reservoirs13. Two methodological challenges
    prevent agricultural ET from being monitored at scale. First, simply measuring
    total ET at scale is a challenge. Second, even when measures of ET are available,
    it is difficult to separate agricultural ET from the total10,15. To measure total
    ET, eddy covariance flux towers are highly accurate for monitoring ET at a single
    location16. However, they are expensive and thus sparse, and they are designed
    to measure ET over uniform vegetation, which is not reflective of complex agricultural
    landscapes17. In the absence of ET measurements, theoretical water demand can
    be simulated based on climate and crop type18,19. Although such tools are helpful
    for water demand planning20, theoretical water demand represents the ET of a crop
    whose water demands are fully met. Therefore, these are likely to overestimate
    actual ET. Additionally, these simulated estimates exclusively reflect variations
    in water demand influenced by factors incorporated into the model, which are often
    limited to crop type and climate21. Therefore, analyses based on these models
    are constrained to examining these specific factors, neglecting other critical
    drivers of ET such as farming practices. Given the scarcity of in situ data and
    the inherent constraints of simulated estimates, accurately gauging total ET at
    scale remains a significant challenge. Addressing the second challenge, even when
    accurate ET measurements are available, isolating agricultural ET from total ET
    is difficult. This step is key for water management, since the resulting metric
    represents the increase in ET attributable to agriculture. To do so, one must
    estimate the naturally-occurring ET that would occur in the absence of irrigated
    agriculture (for example, if the land were left fallow). Most often, this naturally-occurring
    ET is assumed to be equal to precipitation19,22. However, there may be temporal
    lags between precipitation and resulting ET, some precipitation may not result
    in ET at all, and ET may also be supplemented by other sources of water, such
    as near surface groundwater. Together, these challenges leave us with limited
    measurements of ET and no empirical estimates of agricultural ET at large scales,
    inhibiting our ability to form evidence-based water management policies that accurately
    reflect crop water use and potential water savings in agriculture. Recent advances
    in the remote sensing of ET unlock new avenues for research into agricultural
    water consumption. Numerous algorithms for estimating ET using land surface temperature
    and other remote sensing inputs have been validated specifically for use in agricultural
    settings23,24. These advancements have allowed researchers to empirically study
    total ET in agricultural settings25,26. However, despite high-resolution maps
    of ET in agricultural landscapes25,27, the challenge of isolating agricultural
    ET from total ET has been limited to studies in extremely arid regions where irrigation
    is the only source of water available to plants28. Here, we develop a framework
    for measuring agricultural ET at sub-field scales. We use remote sensing to determine
    total ET and combine it with machine learning to estimate naturally-occurring
    ET. First, we retrieve satellite-based remotely sensed total ET estimates from
    the 30m, monthly OpenET ensemble data24 available in the western United States
    starting in 2016. Second, since we can use these same OpenET estimates to directly
    observe naturally-occurring ET over fallow lands, we train a gradient boosting
    algorithm to predict ET over fallow lands. We use information on topography, soil
    quality, climate, and spatial and temporal coordinates as predictors. We then
    use the model to retrieve naturally-occurring ET over all active agricultural
    fields, which we subtract from the remotely-sensed ET to calculate agricultural
    ET. We apply this methodology to calculate agricultural ET across California’s
    Central Valley, one of the world’s most water-stressed and agriculturally productive
    regions29. We use these maps of agricultural ET to calculate the water consumption
    of different crop types, as well as to calculate variability in agricultural ET
    within crop types. These insights allow us to evaluate different strategies that
    have been proposed to save water under the Sustainable Groundwater Management
    Act (SGMA)7, which mandates that all water basins in California reduce groundwater
    pumping to sustainable levels by 204030. Specifically, we compare the ability
    of fallowing, crop switching, and other farming practices to save water by reducing
    agricultural ET. Additionally, we calculate irrigation efficiency to assess the
    potential to reduce irrigation withdrawals without decreasing agricultural ET.
    In the wake of groundwater pumping cutbacks of 20–50% under SGMA7, this work will
    guide water managers in enacting water savings and help predict which land use
    changes are likely to ensue. Results Estimating agricultural ET We calculate agricultural
    ET by retrieving the total ET observed over agricultural areas and subtracting
    naturally-occurring ET (Fig. 1). While total ET estimates are retrieved directly
    from OpenET, we simulate naturally-occurring ET by training a gradient boosting
    regressor to predict the ET observed by OpenET over fallow lands. Our model simulating
    naturally-occurring ET achieves an R2 of .87 and a Mean Absolute Error (MAE) of
    35.5 mm per year (Supplementary Fig. 1). We use a test set made up of 2 km2 held-out
    areas (about four times the area of a large agricultural field in the Central
    Valley). We do not find that error is structured across either space (Supplementary
    Figs. 2 and 3) or time (Supplementary Fig. 4). Fig. 1: Estimates of annual agricultural
    evapotranspiration (ET) over active agricultural lands in California’s Central
    Valley. a Total ET is remotely sensed and is retrieved from OpenET. b Naturally-occurring
    ET is an estimate of the ET that would be present if the agricultural lands were
    fallow, and is predicted using machine learning. c Agricultural ET is the difference
    between total and naturally-occurring ET, and represents our estimate of the ET
    caused by agriculture, and therefore the water that would be conserved if the
    land were fallow instead of cropped. The variations in agricultural ET across
    the landscape suggest that different fields can have vastly different abilities
    to conserve water. OpenET provides ET data at the scale of 30 m; all figure panels
    here show ET resampled to 70 m resolution for computational efficiency and to
    better match average field size. Full size image Variation in agricultural ET
    within and across crop types We leverage the significant variability in agricultural
    ET observed across the Central Valley (Fig. 1) to analyze the factors driving
    these variations. Crop type, which is commonly cited as an important variable
    explaining differences in agricultural ET19, explains 34% of the variation in
    estimated agricultural ET (Eq. (4), Supplementary Fig. 5). In Fig. 2, we show
    the water intensity of different crop groups (Supplementary Note 7). Deciduous
    fruits and nuts are some of the highest consumers at 625 mm per year (582–668
    95% CI) (Fig. 2), particularly almonds at 715 mm per year (651–778 95% CI) (Supplementary
    Fig. 5). Conversely, grain and hay crops consume only 141 mm per year (111–171
    95% CI). These broad variations in the water consumption of different crop types
    align with previous work estimating crop water demands (Supplementary Note 1,
    Supplementary Fig. 6) and suggest that substantial water savings may be possible
    with crop switching. Fig. 2: Variations in annual agricultural evapotranspiration
    (ET) across and within crop groups. Mean agricultural ET by crop group (blue fill
    and 95% CI) is the average difference between total ET (black outline) and naturally-occurring
    ET (cream fill). All measures are summed across the year, leading to naturally-occurring
    and total ET estimates that include water consumption occurring outside of the
    growing season. While we find significant differences in mean agricultural ET
    across crop groups, the gray box plots also show a broad spread in agricultural
    ET within crop groups (box plots show 0.5, 0.25. 0.5, 0.75, and 0.95 quantiles).
    Full size image However, the majority of the variation remains unexplained by
    crop type (Fig. 2, Supplementary Fig. 5). This within-crop variability is not
    uniform for different crops: crops such as deciduous fruits and nuts tend to have
    large variances, whereas rice has a very small variance. For example, pistachios
    have the most variability with an interquartile range (IQR) of 664 mm per year
    over the whole state. Conversely, rice has an IQR of only 122 mm per year (Supplementary
    Fig. 5). Part of the large variability in agricultural ET for deciduous fruits
    and nuts can be explained by orchard age: young orchards consume significantly
    less water than more mature ones (Supplementary Note 2, Supplementary Fig. 7).
    Climate, topography, and soil quality explain an additional 6% of within-crop
    variation. However, substantial within-crop variation remains, indicating that
    some of these differences may be due to variations in farming practices. This
    would suggest that reducing water consumption without switching crops may be feasible,
    which we explore in the next section. The water-saving potential of different
    management strategies The variability of agricultural ET both within and between
    crops allows us to evaluate the water saving-potential of different management
    strategies. Here, we compare the effect of three scenarios on reducing agricultural
    ET in groundwater sub-basins across the Central Valley: 1. Crop switching: Substitute
    high-ET crops for the median water-consuming crop (Eq. (6)). 2. Farming practices:
    Keep the same spatial allocation of crops, but reduce agricultural ET of high
    consumers to the median, crop-specific, consumption level (Eq. (7)). 3. Fallowing:
    Fallow the 5% of lands with the highest estimated agricultural ET (Eq. (8)). Because
    it would not be realistic to prescribe farmers in different contexts to consume
    similar amounts of water, we calculate crop-specific agricultural ET and within-crop
    variation at the level of groundwater sub-basins. We additionally control for
    differences in climate, topography, and soil type before conducting the scenarios.
    To account for the effects of orchard age, we remove orchards that have been bearing
    fruit for 5 years or less or that are in their last year of production (Supplementary
    Fig. 7). We find that each of these scenarios return similar reductions in overall
    water consumption of around 10% (Fig. 3). Since crops with high agricultural ET
    are heavily favored in most sub-basins and therefore the median crop usually has
    a high agricultural ET, crop switching only results in a 9.9% reduction in agricultural
    ET. In order to achieve greater water savings, crops would need to be switched
    to less popular crops with lesser water demands: switching all crops to the lowest
    consuming crop in a sub-basin results in a 93.8% reduction in agricultural ET.
    While strategies that do not require a change in land cover type are less commonly
    cited as a water management approach, we find that reducing high consumers to
    their crops’s median consumption level yields similar water savings of up to 11.3%.
    Fallowing does, however, remain the most effective way to reduce agricultural
    ET. We find that leaving a mere 5% of land fallow results in a 9.3% consumption
    reduction, comparable to the savings afforded by crop switching and within-crop
    scenarios which by definition affect up to 50% of lands. Fig. 3: The percent reduction
    in agricultural evapotranspiration (ET) driven by various management scenarios.
    a Savings accrued by substituting high-ET crops for the median water-consuming
    crop in a sub-basin. b Water savings without changing land cover by reducing agricultural
    ET of high consumers to the median, crop- and sub-basin-specific, consumption
    level. c Water savings from fallowing the 5% of lands with the highest estimated
    agricultural ET. Full size image Irrigation efficiency While fallowing, crop switching,
    and other farming practices highlight opportunities to decrease agricultural ET,
    we also find opportunities to diminish runoff and deep percolation during conveyance,
    on-farm management, or application (Fig. 4). On average, we find that irrigation
    in the Central Valley is 61.8% (54.0–69.7%) efficient, similar in magnitude to
    what theoretical estimates predict (Supplementary Note 3, Supplementary Fig. 8).
    The large disparity in efficiency between northern and southern counties is, however,
    more pronounced than theoretical estimates (Supplementary Fig. 8). As a result,
    there may be limited potential to decrease water withdrawn for irrigation in the
    south which achieves efficiencies as high as 80%. The particularly low efficiencies
    in the northern counties, however, suggest a large potential to decrease irrigation
    water withdrawals without affecting agricultural ET. Fig. 4: Irrigation efficiency
    across the counties of the Central Valley. a Irrigation efficiency is calculated
    by dividing agricultural evapotranspiration (ET) (gridded data) by USGS county-level
    reports of irrigation amounts (blue polygons). For the calculation, agricultural
    ET is averaged to the county level to match the spatial scale of the irrigation
    data. Additionally, irrigation is displayed in volumetric units (teragrams), but
    is divided by county-level cropland area to be in units consistent with agricultural
    ET prior to the calculation. We note that these irrigation amounts are counted
    at the point of use, rather than the water’s point of origin. b The resulting
    county-level irrigation efficiency estimates vary widely across the Central Valley,
    with particularly low efficiencies in the northern counties. Full size image Discussion
    By empirically quantifying crop water consumption at sub-field scales, we contribute
    to characterizing agriculture’s hydrological effects and evaluate the ability
    of different management strategies to mitigate this impact. To overcome the methodological
    challenges associated with estimating agricultural ET, we leverage recent advances
    in remotely sensed ET and use machine learning to generate a naturally-occurring
    ET counterfactual. The fine scale variability in agricultural ET we uncover allows
    us to analyze the drivers of these differences and simulate the potential for
    different management practices to save water, including under-explored ones like
    adjusting farming practices. Additionally, when comparing agricultural ET to total
    water withdrawn for irrigation, we find substantial opportunities for improvements
    in irrigation efficiency in the northern counties of the Central Valley. High-resolution
    maps of agricultural ET can therefore guide our understanding of how agriculture
    and management can affect water resources in California and other water stressed
    agricultural regions globally. Accurate agricultural ET measures are crucial to
    characterize anthropogenic impacts on the hydrological cycle31 and enact effective
    water management18,32. Previously, agricultural ET has been estimated by (i) simulating
    crop water demand based on crop type and climate and (ii) removing naturally available
    water by subtracting precipitation19,22. However, both of these steps embed assumptions
    that can lead to significant biases. For (i), simulated crop water demand may
    not adequately represent the field characteristics or farming practices of a given
    location13. For example, water demands are not necessarily always met, meaning
    water consumption may be overestimated33,34,35. In line with this, while we generally
    find good agreement with crop water demand simulated by the CalSIMETAW model21,
    we do find that agricultural ET estimates are significantly smaller (Supplementary
    Note 1, Supplementary Fig. 6). For (ii), using precipitation to proxy for naturally-occurring
    ET fails to account for precipitation being lost as runoff, temporal lags in when
    precipitation is transpired, and alternative natural sources of water such as
    shallow groundwater. We find that the bias between our estimates and CalSIMETAW
    estimates increases when precipitation, rather than naturally-occurring ET, is
    used to represent baseline amounts of available water. This can be explained by
    the seasonal mismatch between precipitation and naturally-occurring ET: although
    annually there is more precipitation than naturally-occurring ET, precipitation
    mainly occurs in the winter when it is unavailable to most crops. Because using
    precipitation as a proxy for naturally-occurring ET does not account for moisture
    that remains in the soil by the time the growing season begins, this inflates
    simulated estimates of crop water demand. Our use of remotely sensed ET estimates
    and our ability to estimate naturally-occurring ET therefore allows us to more
    accurately characterize agricultural ET. High-resolution, empirical estimates
    of agricultural ET additionally open up the possibility to investigate differences
    in agricultural ET beyond what is attributable to crop type, which we find only
    accounts for 34% of the variation. These within-crop variations can be substantial
    for many crops: the difference in agricultural ET of a pistachio field from the
    75th to the 25th percentile is the same as the water that could be saved from
    fallowing an alfalfa field. Such broad variability is consistent with findings
    from studies comparing total ET across crops during the growing season25,26. Even
    after adjusting for variability attributable to field characteristics, orchard
    age, and climate, we find that these variations could translate to substantial
    water savings without requiring a change in crop type. Unfortunately, a lack of
    high-resolution data on field-scale farming practices and yields inhibits further
    analysis of specific practices driving agricultural ET variation and their economic
    implications. However, prior literature from experimental plots or particular
    locations suggests that mulching36, conservation tillage37, deficit irrigation33,34,35,
    and improved irrigation scheduling and technologies38 all have potential to limit
    agricultural ET. These practices may prove advantageous relative to costly strategies
    like crop-switching or fallowing, though more detailed cost-benefit analyses are
    necessary to determine the suitability of various interventions in specific contexts39.
    Such water saving farming practices are not mentioned in the plans drafted by
    SGMA water managers7. This is possibly due to a lack of conclusive research on
    the potential of such strategies to effectively decrease agricultural ET without
    significant effects on yield or operation cost. Spatial data on the use of these
    different practices would allow researchers to take full advantage of our high-resolution
    agricultural ET estimates and study their water-saving and economic benefits.
    In situ assessments of crop-specific water consumption and other variations in
    agricultural ET enable us to model potential water savings across diverse management
    scenarios. In addition to previously mentioned scenarios based on farming practices,
    we also investigate more traditionally studied strategies, such as crop switching
    and fallowing. Consistent with prior studies relying on crop water demand simulations,
    our research suggests that transitioning to crops with lower water requirements
    is an effective conservation strategy. However, accruing substantial water savings
    requires embracing less popular crops like grains and hay20. The feasibility of
    increasing production of these crops in the Central Valley is uncertain due to
    high labor and operational costs20. Furthermore, any form of crop switching entails
    expenses related to the adoption of new knowledge, technologies, and market adjustments40,41.
    Consequently, the viability of a significant shift towards less water-demanding
    crops, and its alignment with market expansion, remains uncertain20. Therefore,
    our findings support the notion that extensive fallowing or land retirement may
    be essential to achieve substantial reduction targets in areas with severe overdrafts42,43.
    Considering the risk of increased dust from unused land, repurposing such areas
    for habitat restoration, flood water capture for groundwater replenishment44,
    solar energy production, or sustainable industrial development45 could mitigate
    the economic impacts of land retirement for both farmers and local communities.
    Detailed agricultural ET maps like the ones generated for this study can help
    determine the scale of land repurposing needed and identify priority areas for
    such initiatives under different constraints, including existing water rights46.
    Finally, we find a significant opportunity to improve irrigation efficiency, especially
    in the northern part of the Central Valley where we find lower irrigation efficiency
    than previously expected (Supplementary Note 2, Supplementary Fig. 7). This implies
    that farmers in these areas could potentially reduce their irrigation water usage
    without negatively impacting agricultural ET and, consequently, crop growth. Although
    this finding is consistent with management strategies that focus on boosting irrigation
    efficiency7, it is important to recognize that such improvements may not automatically
    lead to water savings at the watershed level14. This is because water not consumed
    in irrigation processes does not always exit the watershed but can instead be
    reabsorbed into groundwater reservoirs or surface water bodies for later reuse.
    Conversely, water that is evapotranspired, which constitutes the ‘efficient’ part
    of irrigation, is completely removed from the watershed14. Hence, paradoxically,
    increasing irrigation efficiency could reduce water availability if it is not
    matched by a decrease in the amount of water withdrawn for irrigation. To prevent
    an unintended increase in water consumption, managers could use agricultural ET
    maps to monitor and control water use as improvements in irrigation efficiency
    are implemented. This study has some important limitations. Most notably, due
    to a lack of data on farming practices, it is difficult to ascertain whether the
    variation in within-crop agricultural ET that we estimate is indeed due to farming
    practices. When conducting our management scenarios, we account for the effects
    of climate, soil quality, topography, and orchard age. We additionally conduct
    the scenarios at the level of small groundwater sub-basins rather than across
    the entire valley to account for any additional regional environmental differences
    we are unable to otherwise account for. However, variance stemming from error
    in our agricultural ET estimates or from mislabeled crop types could contribute
    to observed within-crop variation in agricultural ET. We minimize error from mislabeled
    crop types by using the most accurate crop data available in California which
    boasts an accuracy of 97.6%47. Additionally, the OpenET ensemble model has been
    extensively validated24,48, and our machine learning model has an R2 of .87. We
    estimate that these sources of error are responsible for only 11% of the variance
    in our yearly agricultural ET estimates (Supplementary Note 4). Nevertheless,
    the water-saving potentials we calculate for both the fallowing and farmers practice
    scenarios should be interpreted as upper bound estimates. Another important limitation
    of this study stems from the limited data available on water withdrawn for irrigation
    which is needed to calculate irrigation efficiency. Since irrigation data are
    not available over the same years as agricultural ET, we use the average of the
    two most recent years, 2010 and 2015, a drought year and non-drought year, to
    calculate irrigation efficiency. To ensure that our results are robust to year-to-year
    variations in agricultural ET and irrigation use, we calculate irrigation efficiency
    using all the possible combinations of years (Supplementary Fig. 9). Though we
    do find significant variations based on the irrigation year used in some counties,
    we consistently find low irrigation efficiencies in the north and higher ones
    in the south. Irrigation data with better spatial and temporal resolution would
    improve estimates of irrigation efficiency calculated using this method. We have
    shown how highly resolved agricultural ET estimates can improve our understanding
    of anthropogenic impacts on the hydrologic cycle and guide water management by
    quantifying the potential of different water-saving strategies. In California,
    our findings suggest that irrigated agriculture increases ET less than previously
    estimated, and we find that managers may not need to rely as heavily on changes
    in land cover as currently proposed to achieve significant water savings. Because
    our method for estimating agricultural ET is based entirely on remote sensing
    and machine learning, it remains cost effective and has the potential to be used
    globally, especially as global ET datasets become increasingly available49. This
    work can help refine our understanding of agriculture’s effect on water resources
    and help managers achieve water-saving goals in water-stressed agricultural landscapes
    across the globe. Methods Agricultural ET We define agricultural ET as the difference
    between total ET over an agricultural parcel and the ET that would have been,
    had that parcel been fallow land instead (Eq. (1)). This definition recognizes
    that not all ET over agricultural lands, during the growing season or otherwise,
    can necessarily be attributed to agriculture. Such a definition is particularly
    useful from a management perspective, since it denotes the decrease in ET, or
    water savings, that one might expect if agriculture were to cease. $$\\begin{array}{r}{{{{{{{{\\rm{ET}}}}}}}}}_{{{{{{{{\\rm{ag}}}}}}}}}={{{{{{{{\\rm{ET}}}}}}}}}_{{{{{{{{\\rm{tot}}}}}}}}}-{{{{{{{{\\rm{ET}}}}}}}}}_{{{{{{{{\\rm{nat}}}}}}}}}\\end{array}$$
    (1) where ETag is agricultural ET, ETtot is the total ET over an agricultural
    parcel, and ETnat is the counterfactual ET that would occur naturally, were the
    same land fallow. We note that another, theoretically distinct counterfactual
    could be constructed to represent ETnat: ET if the land were undisturbed, natural
    land rather than fallow. We elect to simulate ET over fallow lands since it allows
    us to predict the potential water savings from fallowing, which has a management
    relevant interpretation. Total ET estimates We construct ETtot from OpenET ensemble
    data, available at a monthly time step from 2016-2021. This data is calculated
    as the average output of six different ET models estimated using Landsat data24.
    The data have been corrected for biases in ET resulting from data only being available
    during cloudless overpasses and have been extensively evaluated over a broad variety
    of land covers48. While they are published at a 30m scale, we resample to 70m
    to improve computational efficiency since this is well below the average size
    of an agricultural field in the Central Valley. Calculation of a naturally-occurring
    ET counterfactual using machine learning We estimate naturally-occurring ET for
    all agricultural pixels using a gradient boosting regressor trained on data from
    fallow lands. We choose a gradient boosting regressor due to its high flexibility
    in learning non-linear relationships and proven performance on tabular datasets
    relative to other regressors50. We retrieve the locations of fallow fields in
    the Central Valley from the Department of Water Resources (DWR) statewide crop
    mapping dataset over available years: 2016, 2018, and 2019. Pixels that are within
    the top 5% ET during July-September are removed due to some implausibly high numbers
    during these months that suggest mislabeling of an active agricultural pixel as
    fallow. While we believe that this data cleaning step is important to ensure an
    unbiased training set, omitting this step does not significantly change our main
    findings (Supplementary Note 5, Supplementary Figs. 10–12). We additionally find
    that our findings do not change when training our model on data that are marked
    fallow by both the DWR dataset and the Cropland Data Layer (CDL) (Supplementary
    Note 6, Supplementary Figs. 13–15). We predict naturally-occurring ET based on
    latitude and longitude, the month and year, as well as a broad set of additional
    variables describing topography (elevation, aspect, slope, topographic wetness
    index), soil quality (California Storie Index), and climate (Potential ET). The
    latitude, longitude, and month and year indicators are included to capture the
    spatial and temporal patterns in ET underlying the densely distributed fallow
    fields in our dataset. However, the inclusion of an indicator variable for each
    year in our model limits our analysis to 2016, 2018, and 2019, as these are the
    only years for which we have available land cover data. Nevertheless, given that
    ‘year’ contributes a mere 3% to our model’s predictive capability (see Supplementary
    Fig. 17), it may be considered non-essential for future research in this area.
    Including additional predictors in our model presents two benefits. First, they
    can improve the model’s predictive power. For example, we find that Potential
    ET contributes greatly to the model’s final predictions (Supplementary Fig. 17).
    Other variables are important to include because they can help correct for systematic
    differences between the fallow lands used to train our model and the active agricultural
    lands we apply the model to. Such differences could arise from farmers selecting
    lands to be fallowed due to their inherently lower productivity, which would negatively
    bias our estimates of counterfactual naturally-occurring ET in locations actively
    being cropped today. To assemble these predictor variables, we retrieve topographic
    information from the USGS National Elevations Database, soil quality information
    from the California Storie Index in the the USDA’s gSSURGO and STATSGO2 datasets,
    and Potential ET from the hPET global dataset51. To validate our naturally-occurring
    ET model, we split our dataset, reserving 60% for training, 10% for validation,
    and 30% for testing. In order to ensure that nearby and therefore very similar
    pixels are not present across multiple splits, we group our splits by 2 km2 squares,
    four times the size of a large agricultural field in the Central Valley. The entire
    dataset is made up of over 16 million pixels populating 8180 distinct 2 km2 regions.
    We set aside 4908 of these 2 km2 clusters for training, amounting to nearly 10
    million pixels. The testing split is composed of 2454 clusters. We tune hyperparameters
    using 100 iterations of a threefold randomized search cross-validation on an unclustered
    subset of our dataset. Randomized search cross-validation is similar to grid search
    cross-validation, but only reaches a random subset of the possible hyperparameter
    combinations to improve computational efficiency. We manually set the minimum
    number of samples required to split a node to 200 and the minimum number of samples
    required at each leaf node to 100 to account for the large size and spatial clustering
    of the dataset. Because we carry out our analyses using yearly estimates of agricultural
    ET, we validate our model on yearly estimates of naturally-occurring ET. Only
    fallow lands from the test data split are used in any subsequent analyses on fallow
    lands. Analysis After computing agricultural ET for all fields across the Central
    Valley following Eq. (1), we report a variety of statistical summaries and conduct
    scenarios manipulating the spatial distribution of agricultural ET. In order to
    ensure our analyses only capture variations across space, we aggregate our observations
    of agricultural ET to a yearly timestep and control for variation across years
    before beginning this analysis. To do so, we calculate an “adjusted” agricultural
    ET for each pixel by removing the difference between the mean agricultural ET
    for that year and the overall sample mean agricultural ET from the original agricultural
    ET calculation, as follows: $${{{{{{{{\\rm{AdjustedET}}}}}}}}}_{p,y}={{{{{{{{\\rm{ET}}}}}}}}}_{p,y}-(\\overline{{{{{{{{{\\rm{ET}}}}}}}}}_{y}}-\\overline{{{{{{{{\\rm{ET}}}}}}}}})$$
    (2) where \\({{{{{{{{\\rm{AdjustedET}}}}}}}}}_{p,y}\\) is the agricultural ET
    for pixel p in year y with the year-specific variation removed, ETp,y is the original
    agricultural ET, \\(\\overline{{{{{{{{{\\rm{ET}}}}}}}}}_{y}}\\) is the mean agricultural
    ET in year y across all pixels and \\(\\overline{{{{{{{{\\rm{ET}}}}}}}}}\\) is
    the mean agricultural ET across all pixels and years. Regressions To calculate
    point estimates and confidence intervals for the overall mean agricultural ET
    (Eq. (3)), the mean agricultural ET by crop group or crop type (Supplementary
    Note 7), or the mean agricultural ET by county (used to calculate irrigation efficiency)
    (Eq. (4)), we conduct a series of regressions with the following format: $${{{{{{{{\\rm{AdjustedET}}}}}}}}}_{p,y}=\\alpha+{\\epsilon
    }_{p,y}$$ (3) $${{{{{{{{\\rm{AdjustedET}}}}}}}}}_{p,y}={\\beta }_{p,y}\\times
    {{{{{{{{\\rm{Group}}}}}}}}}_{{{{{{{{\\rm{p,y}}}}}}}}}+{\\epsilon }_{p,y}$$ (4)
    where \\({{{{{{{{\\rm{AdjustedET}}}}}}}}}_{p,y}\\) represents agricultural ET
    for pixel p in year y with the year-specific variation removed, α is a coefficient
    indicating the mean agricultural ET across all samples, Groupp,y represents a
    vector of dummy variables indicating which crop (for crop comparisons shown in
    Figs. 2 and S5) or county (for irrigation efficiency calculations shown in Fig.
    4; county does not vary by year) observation p, y falls into, βp,y is a corresponding
    vector of coefficients indicating the average agricultural ETs for each crop or
    county group, and ϵp,y is an error term. Standard errors are calculated using
    75 km clusters, as determined by plotting a variogram of the spatial autocorrelation
    in agricultural ET (Supplementary Fig. 16). The aggregate crop group (Fig. 2)
    and detailed crop type (Supplementary Fig. 5) are each assigned using the same
    DWR land cover data used to determine fallow status. In addition to using regression
    to calculate point estimates and confidence intervals, regression allows us to
    calculate the proportion of variation that is explained by a set of variables.
    This is because the R2 corresponds to the fraction of variation explained by the
    regression. We use this to assess the % variation explained by crop type, using
    Eq. (4), as well as that explained by climate, topography, and soil quality: $$\\begin{array}{r}{{{{{{{{\\rm{AdjustedET}}}}}}}}}_{p,y}=\\alpha+{\\beta
    }_{p,y}\\times {X}_{p,y}+{\\epsilon }_{p,y}\\end{array}$$ (5) where α is the intercept,
    Xp,y is a vector of variables including PET, elevation, aspect, slope, TWI, and
    soil quality, βp,y is a vector of coefficients for each variable in Xp,y, and
    ϵp,y is an error term. Management scenarios We conduct three scenarios in which
    we manipulate agricultural ET to mimic land management changes and report the
    decrease in overall agricultural ET within groundwater sub-basins across the Central
    Valley. Eq. (6) is a crop switching scenario (cs) where pixels with agricultural
    ET values above those of the median crop in a given sub-basin are replaced with
    that median crop. Eq. (7) is a farming practice scenario (fp) where pixels with
    agricultural ET values above crop and sub-basin-specific mean values are replaced
    with that crop and sub-basin mean. Finally, Eq. (8) is a fallowing scenario (fal)
    which replaces all pixels with agricultural ET values above the sub-basin-specific
    95th percentile with a value of zero agricultural ET. $${{{{{{{{\\rm{Savings}}}}}}}}}_{{{{{{{{\\rm{cs}}}}}}}}}=1-\\frac{\\mathop{\\sum
    }\\nolimits_{i=1}^{n}\\min ({{{{{{{{\\rm{ET}}}}}}}}}_{c,b},{{{{{{{\\rm{Median}}}}}}}}{({{{{{{{{\\rm{ET}}}}}}}}}_{c,b})}_{b})\\left.\\right)}{\\mathop{\\sum

    0,\\quad &\\,{{\\mbox{otherwise}}}\\,\\end{array}\\right.}{\\mathop{\\sum }\\nolimits_{i=1}^{n}{{{{{{{{\\rm{ET}}}}}}}}}_{i}}$$
    (8) where ETi is the adjusted agricultural ET for observation i, ETc,b is the
    average agricultural ET for crop type c in groundwater sub-basin \\(b,{{{{{{{\\rm{Median}}}}}}}}{({{{{{{{{\\rm{ET}}}}}}}}}_{c,b})}_{b}\\)
    is the median ETc,b in sub-basin b, and ET.95,b is the 95th percentile of agricultural
    ET in sub-basin b. To ensure that the water savings identified in our scenarios
    result from factors that can be influenced by management interventions, we account
    for orchard age, climate, and other physical characteristics of the land. To account
    for orchard age, we remove young orchards that are have been bearing fruit for
    5 or less years, or old orchards that are going to be removed within the next
    year (Supplementary Note 2). Because we are only able to label orchard age in
    this way for all orchards in year 2019 (the DWR crop type data we use are only
    available starting 2014), we exclusively use 2019 for this part of the analysis.
    Since we are only using one year, we do not adjust the water use according to
    the year like we do for the other analyses. To account for differences in climate
    and other characteristics inherent to the land, we control for potential ET, soil
    quality, topographic wetness index, elevation, aspect and slope using linear regression
    (Eq. (5)). Irrigation efficiency We define irrigation efficiency as the proportion
    of irrigation water that results in agricultural ET, and is thus consumed by agriculture
    (Eq. (9)). To determine amounts of water withdrawn for irrigation, we retrieve
    county level irrigation water use data from the USGS National Water Information
    System. We note that these irrigation amounts are counted at the point of use,
    rather than the water’s point of origin. These data are gathered every five years
    with the most recently available data from 2015. Because there is no match for
    the years of available irrigation data and our agricultural ET estimates from
    2016, 2018, and 2019, we use the two most recent years, 2010 and 2015, which represent
    a non-drought year and a drought year, respectively. $${{{{{{{\\rm{IRRIGATION}}}}}}}}\\,{{{{{{{\\rm{EFFICIENCY}}}}}}}}=\\frac{{{{{{{{{\\rm{ET}}}}}}}}}_{{{{{{{{\\rm{ag}}}}}}}}}}{{{{{{{{\\rm{Irrigation}}}}}}}}}$$
    (9) where ETag is agricultural ET (Eq. (1)) and Irrigation is the water withdrawn
    for irrigation. ETag and Irrigation must be in matching units, either volumetric
    or depth. We calculate both in mm per year. We assume all active agricultural
    lands in the Central Valley are irrigated and calculate the average agricultural
    ET in mm per year over active agricultural lands in each county. To also retrieve
    average irrigation amount across irrigated lands in a county in mm per year, we
    divide the volume of irrigation water by the average area of irrigated land in
    each county. Because some counties are not fully encompassed within the Central
    Valley, we assume that irrigation in a given county is evenly distributed over
    irrigated lands within and outside of the Central Valley. Data availability The

    the largest water-consuming crop in the central rice production regions in the
    world, and water scarcity is bound to threaten rice production [1]. Additionally,
    the water consumption in paddy fields would increase significantly due to global
    climate change in the future. The unfavorable factors must aggravate the water
    crisis in rice fields [2, 3]. Leaf water content (LWC) is an important evaluation
    index for crop water demand status [4]. Monitoring LWC effectively achieves precise
    irrigation, improves water utilization, and alleviates the water crisis. Hyperspectral
    remote sensing technology has recently been widely used in agricultural production
    due to its rapid, nondestructive, and real-time monitoring of crop physiological
    and biochemical characteristics [5,6,7]. Early LWC spectral modeling studies improved
    prediction accuracy by constructing various types of vegetation indices from sensitive
    spectral bands, such as the moisture stress index (MSI) and water index (WI) [8,
    9]. Previous spectral monitoring studies have initially focused on vegetation
    indices derived from spectral bands. Researchers construct different vegetation
    indices by spectrally sensitive bands to improve the prediction accuracy of LWC
    [10, 11]. Vegetation indices are frequently screened by selecting spectral information
    and have a good correlation with LWC at multiple points over many years [12, 13],
    but the established models usually ignore the effects of the growing environment
    and growth characteristics on LWC of the crops. Climate characteristics and physiological
    status of the plants are important factors affecting LWC [14, 15]. The neglected
    information could be the primary reason for the poor generalizability of existing
    vegetation index models in practical applications. Therefore, integrating the
    actors into the spectral monitoring models of LWC would be more high precision
    due to considering the potential effects of the growing environment and growth
    characteristics on LWC [16, 17]. Qin et al. [18] have recently improved crop nitrogen
    content prediction accuracy using a spectral model that combines image feature
    parameters and fluorescence parameters. These results supported our inferences
    that introducing multi-source data may be important means to improve the monitoring
    accuracy of LWC spectral modeling in rice plants. Choosing modeling methods are
    one of key steps in building monitoring models. Vegetation index monitoring models
    have been usually established using linear and nonlinear functions [19, 20]. These
    traditional monitoring models do not represent the complex relationship between
    various indicators. Machine learning algorithms with sophisticated functionality
    and the ability to handle complex relationships between predictors and target
    variables can be a good solution to this problem [21, 22]. The accuracy and stability
    of models have significantly improved with the rapid development of machine learning
    algorithms, and these are widely adopted when establishing rice nitrogen nutrition
    monitoring models [23,24,25]. Moreover, machine learning algorithms allow the
    use of different classes of sample data as input variables, allowing multiple
    sources of data (physiological and ecological indicators and spectral information)
    to be effectively coupled and can effectively discriminate between differences
    in the contributions of the input variables, allowing the model’s parameters can
    be fully utilized. Therefore, we speculated that the monitoring capacities of
    vegetation index models integrating with multi-source data would also have significant
    advantages using machine learning algorithms when predicting the LWC of rice plants
    based on the results previous studies [16, 26]. Three irrigation regimes and four
    varieties with different drought tolerance capacities were established LWC difference
    populations in field experiments. This study’s objectives are to (1) select spectrally
    sensitive bands with high correlation with LWC at multiple growth stages; (2)
    build a new vegetation index model of LWC integrating multi-source data parameters
    after selecting key physiological and ecological indicators; and (3) use a machine
    learning algorithm to optimize the coupling model and select the optimal algorithm
    to monitor the LWC. Materials and methods Site and treatment description Three
    irrigation regimes, including two water-saving irrigation regimes named mild alternate
    dry and wet irrigation (MADW), severe alternate dry and wet irrigation (SADW)
    and traditional irrigation regime (CK), were conducted with four rice cultivars
    in Anhui province of China in 2021 and 2022 (Fig. 1). The planting and sampling
    plan details and soil characteristics are presented in Table 1. The climate conditions
    are displayed in Fig. 2. The irrigation regimes were conducted when rice seedlings
    were planted in plots. The irrigation criterion referenced the classical definition
    for the MADW and SADW treatments [27]. The supplementary irrigation with 2–3 cm
    water layer was carried out when the soil water potential at 20 cm soil layer
    reached − 15 KPa and − 30 KPa in the MADW and SADW treatments during whole growth
    stages of rice plants, respectively, across cultivars, years, and locations. The
    soil water potential of each plot was monitored by a tensiometer (Watermark, Irrometer
    Company Riverside, CA, USA). Moreover, 2–3 cm water later was always maintained
    for the CK treatment during whole growth stages. Generally, 9–14, 5–8, and 18–24
    times irrigated practices were applied for the MADW, SADW, and CK treatments,
    respectively, across cultivars, years, and locations. Fig. 1 Sketch of field experiments

    divided into three applications for each treatment: 40% as a basal fertilizer,
    30% at the early tiller stage, and 30% at the panicle differentiation stage. The
    nitrogen fertilizer was applied at the rate of 240 kg ha−1. Phosphorus and potassium
    fertilizers (P2O5 75 kg ha−1 and K2O 225 kg ha−1) were also applied as basal fertilizers.
    Plot sizes for each experiment were 12 m2 and 40 m2 in Hefei and Fuyang, respectively.
    All experimental rows were spaced 30.0 cm apart, and plants in a row were spaced
    13.3 cm apart. Measurements Hyperspectral and vegetation index Canopy reflectance
    spectra of rice plants were collected for the booting, flowering, initial grain
    filling, and middle grain filling stages using spectral scanning equipment (ASD
    Field Spec 4, Boulder, CO, USA). The band amplitude of the device ranged from
    350 to 2500 nm. The measurements were conducted under clear and cloudless sky
    conditions between 10:00 and 14:00 [16]. After measuring 10 times for each sample,
    the average value was calculated, and the reference plate was used to correct
    the instrument every 15 min. The representative hills were monitored in each plot
    for all treatments at each observed time. Numerous vegetation indices have been
    applied to monitoring crop water content. The normalized difference vegetation
    index (NDVI) has been widely utilized in monitoring plant water using remote sensing
    methods due to its simple construction and effective improvement of spectral monitoring
    accuracy with multi-band analysis compared with other vegetation indices. Thus,
    this study used canopy spectral data to construct the normalized difference index
    (ND) and five traditional vegetation indices. The calculation equations were illustrated
    in Table 2. Table 2 List of vegetation indices used in this study Full size table
    SPAD value and chlorophyll fluorescence parameters SPAD value of rice leaves was
    monitored using a chlorophyll meter (Konica Minolta Company, SPAD-520 plus, Japan).
    The average value of the top three fully expanded leaves was defined as the SPAD
    value of the whole plant. The five independent plants were measured in each plot
    across cultivars, water treatments, and observed periods. The leaves used to measure
    SPAD value were chosen, and chlorophyll fluorescence parameters of rice leaves
    were determined using a portable pulse-modulated chlorophyll fluorometer (WALZ
    Company, PAM-2500, Germany). These leaves were used to determine the minimum fluorescence
    level (Fo) and the maximum fluorescence level (Fm) of dark-adapted leaves at dawn
    for all cultivars and treatments. The steady-state Fo was measured using far-red
    light with illumination less than 1 mol m−2 s−1. Then, a 0.80-s saturating pulse
    with 8000 mol m−2 s−1 PAR was supplied to determine the Fm. Moreover, the steady-state
    fluorescence yield (Fs) was recorded at the forenoon with clear and cloudless
    sky conditions. Then, a 0.80-s saturating pulse with 8000 mol m−2 s−1 PAR was
    stimulated to obtain the maximal fluorescence level (Fm''). Finally, the maximum
    photochemical efficiency (Fv/Fm) and actual photochemical efficiency (Y(II)) were
    calculated: (1) (2) Leaf water content (LWC) The fresh leaf mass (FW) was determined
    by weighing the top three fully expanded leaves immediately. Five hills were sampled
    in each plot for four cultivars and three water treatments during each observed
    period. Fresh leaves were weighed and dried at 80 ℃ to constant weight at each
    sampling. The weight was marked as dry mass (DW). The LWC was calculated as follows:
    (3) Crop water stress index (CWSI) CWSI was calculated as follows [31, 32]: (4)
    (5) (6) (7) where Tc is the crop canopy temperature (℃), and Ta is the air temperature
    (℃). Tmin is the lower limit of the canopy and air temperature difference (℃),
    Tmax is the upper limit of the canopy and air temperature difference (℃), and
    VPD is the air saturation water vapor pressure deficit (KPa). VPG is the difference
    between the air saturation water vapor pressure and VPD when the air temperature
    is Ta and (Ta + A), respectively. A and B are linear regression coefficients.
    RH is the relative humidity of air (%). In this study, a HOBO UX100-003 temperature
    and humidity recorder (Onset, USA) was placed in each plot to automatically record
    rice canopy temperature and humidity every 1 h interval throughout the day. Leaf
    area index (LAI), above-ground biomass (Biomass), and Grain yield Five representative
    hills, which plants in the hills had uniform growth capacities, were randomly
    selected from each plot at each sampling time across all cultivars and irrigation
    treatments. The hills with excessively vigorous or weak plants were not sampled
    to minimize sampling error. All green leaves per hill were scanned using a portable
    leaf area meter (CI-203, CID Inc., USA). The averaged leaf area in a each plot
    was then calculated from the five hills and marked with D (cm2). Finally, the
    scanned green leaf, remaining yellow leaves, stem, and panicle organs were dried
    at 80 ℃ to constant weight to assess the biomass of each plot. (8) where ρ is
    the planting density per square meter (hill m−2). Plants from a 2 m2 area were
    harvested at maturity to calculate the actual grain yield with 13.5% moisture
    content in each plot across cultivars and water treatments. Regression models
    Some common and classic machine learning algorithms were preliminary assessed
    to select elite algorithms with high monitoring abilities to LWC of rice plants.
    Finally, the four machine learning algorithms named decision tree regression (DT),
    random forest regression (RF), K-nearest neighbor regression (KNN), and gradient
    boosting decision tree regression (GBDT) were adopted in this study. The four
    selected methods were successfully applied on estimating various ecological parameters
    such as water content of wheat plants and soil moisture of wheat fields [16, 33].
    In addition, the scikit-learn packages of the four algorithms were from Python
    3.8 software (https://scikit-learn.org/stable/index.html). Multiple linear regression
    (MLR) MLR is the most basic and commonly used method for combining two or more
    independent variables that jointly predict or estimate the dependent variable
    [34]. The y is the dependent variable. The x1, x2… xk are the independent variables.
    The multiple linear regression was calculated as follows: (9) where b0 is the
    constant term, e is the error term, and b1, b2… bk are the regression coefficients.
    When x1, x2…, and xk are fixed, b1(k) represents the effect of increase or decrease
    in x1(k) on y for each unit or named the partial regression coefficient of x1(k)
    on y. Decision tree regression (DT) DT is a way to infer classification rules
    as a decision tree from a set of unordered and irregular data, using a top-down
    recursive approach to compare attribute values of nodes inside the decision tree
    [35]. Each internal node is a splitting problem in a decision tree. A test for
    some instance attribute is specified, and it splits the samples arriving at that
    node according to a particular attribute. Each subsequent branch of the node corresponds
    to one of the possible values of that attribute. The prediction results are the
    average values of the output variables in the samples contained in the leaf nodes
    of the regression tree. In this study, the maximum depth of the tree was set as
    10, and the number of trees was 100. Random forest regression (RF) RF resulted
    from random sampling from sample observations and feature variables of the modeled
    data among many decision trees; each sampling result is a tree [36]. Meanwhile,
    each tree generated rules and judgment values that match its properties. Finally,
    the forest algorithm integrated the rules and judgment values of all decision
    trees to achieve random forest regression. K-nearest neighbor regression (KNN)
    KNN was predicted by computing the spatial similarity relationship between the
    k nearest neighbors and the predictor. The algorithm was frequently used for classification
    problems in the early stage and gradually applied to parameter estimation [37].
    The primary principle of the KNN algorithm is that a prediction sample has K nearest
    neighbors in the feature space. Then, the class of the prediction sample was usually
    determined by the majority class of the K nearest neighbors. The K data set value
    was chosen appropriately according to the samples. The model was simplified, and
    useful information was lost if the data set was too large. Oppositely, the model
    would be over-fitted if the data set is too small. The K data set was defined
    as 3 in this study. Gradient boosting decision tree regression (GBDT) GBDT is
    an improved algorithm based on the booting algorithm [38]. The booting algorithm
    assigned the same weight to each training sample in the initial training and then
    increased the weights of the error points after each training session to generate
    multiple base learners. Finally, these base learners were combined, and the model
    was formed using weighting or voting approaches. The difference between gradient
    boosting tree regression and classification algorithms was that the input training
    data was residual. The previous prediction was incorporated into the residual
    to find the training data for the current round instead of the gradient of the
    loss function. Data analysis and model verification The Pearson correlation coefficient
    (PCC) helps to measure the linear correlation between variables [39]. In this
    study, PCC was simply regarded as supplementary means to eliminate unimportant
    indicators with low correlation coefficient and to obtain eigenvalues with high
    correlation coefficient. This meant that indicators closely related to LWC were
    used to build models to improve performance. After removing invalid samples from
    the two-year experiments from 2021 to 2022, 91 sample data for each growth stage
    were obtained. In multiple linear regression (MLR), 2022 data were used for modeling
    (55), whereas 2021 data were used for validation (36). The measured data were
    randomly divided into training (70%) and testing (30%) sets in the machine learning
    regression algorithm. The regression model''s accuracy was evaluated using the
    determination coefficient (R2) and root mean square error (RMSE). The overall
    model was evaluated in the graph, including linear regression and a 1:1 dash-line,
    to determine the relationship between the predicted and measured values. The calculation
    equations are presented in (9)–(10): (10) (11) where is the measured value of
    LWC, is the measured mean value of LWC, is the predicted value of the model, and
    n is the sample size. The larger the R2 value, the better the accuracy of the
    model. The RMSE reflects the degree of dispersion and deviation between the model’s
    predicted and true values. The smaller the value, the better the prediction of
    the model. The workflow of the LWC prediction procedures is illustrated in Fig.
    3. Data preprocessing included the following processes: (1) normal distribution
    test and scatter plots were performed for the original data such as vegetation
    index parameters, leaf water content, and physiological and ecological indexes
    (Additional file 1: Fig. S1–S4). (2) Outliers detection of all parameters were
    shown in Additional file 1: Table S1. (3) The multicollinearity test between ND
    and SPAD, between ND and Fv/Fm, between ND and CWSI at whole observed stages were
    also adopted by variance inflation factor and tolerance values (Additional file
    1: Table S2). Fig. 3 Flow chart of this study Full size image Results The classical
    and new vegetation index for monitoring LWC The sensitive bands of LWC were analyzed
    and tested using the normalized difference vegetation index formula at the booting,
    flowering, initial grain filling, and middle grain filling stages to improve the
    accuracy of the hyperspectral monitoring model for LWC. The classical vegetation
    indices, such as NDII and MSI, had a significant positive correlation with LWC
    and high predictive abilities (Table 3). The vegetation index ND constructed by
    the screened sensitive bands (1287 and 1673 mm) also had a significant positive
    correlation with LWC (Fig. 4). The R2 in the ND(1287,1673) model was higher than
    that in NDII and MSI vegetation indices at each growth stage. These results indicated
    that vegetation index ND was an optimal predicted model at each growth stage of
    rice plants. The R2 of the linear equation between LWC (y) and ND(1287,1673) (x)
    was 0.48, 0.64, 0.57, and 0.53, and the corresponding prediction R2 was 0.36,

    image The relationship between physiological-ecological indicators and LWC The
    physiological-ecological indicators had obvious effects on LWC at each growth
    stage and yield (Fig. 6). The LWC had the highest correlation with grain yield
    at the booting, flowering, and initial grain filling stages. The LWC is the most
    important parameter that regulates grain yield, especially for different irrigation
    treatments. CWSI had the highest correlation coefficient with LWC (− 0.60 to − 0.85)
    at each observed stage, followed by the Fv/Fm (0.56–0.71) and SPAD (0.53–0.67).
    Therefore, CWSI, Fv/Fm, and SPAD can be considered reliable multi-source data
    to improve the detection accuracy of LWC using the vegetation index model. Fig.

    functions between LWC and ND(1287,1673) at different growth stages (Fig. 5) were
    systematically analyzed using multi-source data, such as SPAD, Fv/Fm, and CWSI
    (Fig. 7). Both a and b have significantly quadratic curve relations with CWSI,
    SPAD, and Fv/Fm. For a parameter, the determination coefficient (R2) of the curves
    reached the highest for the CWSI (R2 = 0.92), followed by the SPAD and Fv/Fm.
    In contrast, Fv/Fm had the greatest R2 with parameter b (R2 = 0.99), while CWSI
    had the lowest R2 with parameter b (R2 = 0.37). The results illustrate that SPAD,
    Fv/Fm, and CWSI can be regarded as useful multi-source data to improve the prediction
    capacities of LWC. Fig. 7 The SPAD value (a), Fv/Fm (b), and CWSI (c) at different

    performance of LWC by coupling multi-source data There were no multicollinearity
    between ND and SPAD, between ND and Fv/Fm, between ND and CWSI based on the tolerance
    and variance inflation factor values (Additional file 1: Table S2). Also, Durbin
    Watson test indicated that the established multivariate linear regressed models
    in this study were basically meet the requirements of linear model (Additional
    file 1: Table S2). The indicators CWSI, Fv/Fm, and SPAD were introduced into the
    ND(1287,1673) model to improve the prediction model accuracy of LWC further (Table
    4). The results demonstrated that the ND(1287,1673) model integrating with multi-source
    data enhanced predictive power than the conventional ND(1287,1673) model (Fig.
    5 and Table 4). The coupled models of ND(1287,1673) and CWSI had the best monitoring
    capacity to LWC at the booting and flowering stages (Fig. 8). The R2 improved
    from 0.48–0.64 in conventional ND(1287,1673) models to 0.69–0.75 in the coupled
    models. Prediction R2 also improved from 0.36–0.67 in conventional ND(1287,1673)
    models to 0.65–0.69 in the coupled models at the booting and flowering stages.
    Moreover, the coupling models of ND(1287,1673) and Fv/Fm were optimal at the initial
    and middle grain filling. The R2 and the corresponding prediction R2 improved
    in the coupling models than in conventional ND(1287,1673) models at the initial
    and middle grain filling. Table 4 The ND(1287,1673) models predicting LWC after

    and KNN was about 2 times higher than that of MLR, but the RMSE of GBDT was at
    the same level when compared with MLR. Particularly, GBDT synergistically improved

    Full size image Discussion Relationship between multi-source data and LWC A suitable
    vegetation index is important to construct an LWC spectral monitoring model in
    smart agriculture. The first important step is to screen the sensitive band. However,
    there are some differences on the selected water-sensitive bands for different
    crops. Thomas et al. [40] discovered a significant correlation between the relative
    water content of cotton leaves and the reflectance values in the near-infrared
    (NIR) bands (1450 and 1930 nm). Yang et al. [41] suggest that the sensitive band
    range of LWC in wheat plants is located in the visible (400–780 nm) and NIR bands
    (1400–2500 nm). This study selected different spectral indices from previous studies
    to establish relationships with rice LWC. However, the correlation was not optimal.
    The ND constructed by the NIR band at 1287 and 1673 nm was instead optimal (Table
    3). This study’s results were inconsistent with those of previous studies. One
    of the important reasons could be that vegetation index models for monitoring
    LWC in our study considered the multiple growth stages of rice plants, rather
    than focusing on a specific growth stage in previous studies. Additionally, the
    spectral data obtained from different ecological sites, climates, and varieties.
    In this study, the varieties were selected for their commonality bands, considering
    the universality of the varieties from which the four rice varieties with a large
    span of validation years and large differences in drought resistance were selected.
    Recently, multi-source data related to environmental factors coupled with the
    spectral monitoring model of LWC has been successfully established in wheat plants
    to reduce the errors caused by environmental and physiological factors during
    the spectral monitoring process [16]. This study used the Pearson correlation
    coefficient method to analyze the physiological and ecological indicators related
    to LWC. Our results displayed that CWSI, Fv/Fm and SPAD would be considered as
    optimized multi-source data because the parameters had a higher correlation with
    LWC compared to other physiological and agronomic indices during whole observed
    periods (Fig. 6). These findings were also consistent with the basic physiological
    laws of plants that the three parameters would be changed with the change of LWC.
    First, the transpiration rate quickly reduces with declining LWC in rice plants
    [42, 43]. A low transpiration rate increases canopy temperature for a short time
    and then fleetly regulates CWSI in the canopy of plants [44, 45]. Second, H2O
    is insufficient to maintain its physiological activities when LWC is low in rice
    plants; the phenomenon quickly downregulates photosynthetic performance, such
    as declining Fv/Fm [46,47,48]. Third, SPAD biosynthesis would be hindered, and
    decomposition could be accelerated if LWC remains low for a long time, resulting
    in the yellowing of leaves [49]. Finally, the fluctuant sensitive parameters lead
    to significant changes in population characteristics, such as leaf area, biomass,
    and yield, presenting different degrees of decline [50]. Therefore, we deduce
    that CWSI, Fv/Fm, and SPAD should be introduced into the spectral monitoring model
    to improve the R2 for monitoring LWC in whole growth stages of rice plants. Coupling
    multi-source data for monitoring rice LWC The canopy structure and growth environment
    of rice have been changing throughout the whole growth period, resulting in different
    spectral reflectance data, making it difficult to accurately build a water prediction
    model for the whole growth period with a single vegetation index model [51]. A
    good relationship between physiological and ecological indicators and spectral
    information is the key to rapid and non-destructive monitoring of coupled multi-source
    data. The relationships between CWSI, Fv/Fm, and SPAD and the slope (a) and intercept
    (b) of the conventional linear ND(1287,1673) models were systematically analyzed
    at each observed period to achieve accurate prediction of LWC (Fig. 7). The parameter
    a had the closest relationship with CWSI with R2 of 0.92. However, the parameter
    b had the closest relationship with Fv/Fm with R2 of 0.99. These results indicate
    that the conventional linear ND(1287,1673) models could be largely influenced
    by physiological and ecological factors when LWC was monitored using spectroscopic
    equipment. Therefore, slope and intercept could be defined as ecological and physiological
    factors in conventional linear ND(1287,1673) models, especially for monitoring
    LWC in rice plants. This evidence confirms the necessity of incorporating physiological
    parameters into the conventional ND(1287,1673) model to improve LWC monitoring
    accuracy in rice plants. Currently, multi-source data are widely used in hyperspectral
    monitoring. However, most studies have utilized a single type of multi-source
    numbers to construct models independently or in combination, and few studies have
    discussed the effect of coupled multi-source data on the monitoring performance
    of rice LWC models. This study uses a commonly used multiple linear regression
    algorithm to estimate rice LWC based on coupled multi-source data and compare
    its monitoring performance. The results revealed that the monitoring capacities
    in ND(1287,1673) models coupled with physiological and ecological factors were
    significantly increased than conventional ND(1287,1673) models across all observed
    stages (Tables 3 and 4). The coupled model of ND + CWSI and ND + Fv/Fm had the
    best monitoring capacities at the booting to flowering and initial to middle grain
    filling stages, respectively. The different coupled parameters at different growth
    stages may related to the differences in rice growth characteristics. Previous
    studies have demonstrated that the canopy structure is unstable and that leaf
    area and biomass are in a state of constant growth during the booting and flowering
    stages in rice plants [52]. Irrigation regimes directly regulate canopy growth
    and development [53]. Therefore, the canopy micro-ecological factors, such as
    photosynthetically active radiation, temperature, and humidity, constantly fluctuate
    [54], especially for different water treatments. Finally, CWSI is a sensitive
    index at this stage because CWSI is mainly regulated by the micro-ecological factor
    [31, 32]. However, rice plants are in the senescence stage after flowering. Leaf
    photosynthetic capacity significantly declines during the grain-filling stage
    compared to pre-flowering in rice plants [43, 55]. Additionally, photosynthetic
    performances are susceptive to different irrigation regimes during senescence
    processes [56]. Fv/Fm is an important index evaluating photosynthetic performance.
    Therefore, photosynthetic performance could be a better multi-source parameter
    to predict LWC during the rice-filling stage. Comparison of machine learning algorithms
    Machine learning algorithms have recently been widely used in model monitoring
    research and have become popular tools in precision agricultural production research.
    In this study, four machine learning algorithms, DT, RF, KNN, and GBDT were used
    to perform operations based on coupled models using rice flowering data as an
    example (Table 5). The results indicated that the R2 for the simulation and validation
    sets of DT, RF, KNN and GBDT were 0.80–0.93 and 0.75–0.86, respectively, which
    the R2 of machine learning algorithms were 1.16–1.35 times higher for the simulation
    sets and 1.09–1.25 times higher for the validation sets compared with MLR (Fig.
    10). Among them, GBDT has the highest R2 with low and stable RMSE. Therefore,
    the GBDT model would be considered as the best machine learning algorithm for
    monitoring LWC in this study’s simulating and verification data sets. Previous
    research supports our results that the GBDT algorithm has higher prediction accuracy
    for leaf area in maize plants among the aforementioned algorithms [57]. GBDT can
    improve prediction accuracy by constructing a weak learner to correct the original
    model error via residuals and resultant iterations when the sample size is small
    [58]. The same weights are assigned for each input factor for the other algorithms;
    the algorithm would fail to determine the primary contributing factor in the input
    factor if the training data are insufficient [57]. This may be the primary reason
    the GBDT algorithm has significant advantages to improve LWC monitoring capabilities
    in this study because our sample size could not be abundant enough to support
    the data requirements of other algorithms. In summary, machine learning positively
    improves the monitoring abilities of LWC in rice plants. Future perspectives Factors
    such as fertility period and rice LWC changes lead to parameter differences between
    relevant indicators extracted from various data sources. Current crop monitoring
    models are mostly single-factor statistical models that are difficult to consider
    crop growth and development, yield formation and its interactions with climate
    and soil environment, and lack universality and dynamics. Therefore, coupling
    spectral remote sensing information with multivariate data can construct a spectral
    monitoring model with high accuracy and stable reliability of crop growth, moisture
    content, and other indicators, providing an effective solution to the spectral
    monitoring problem. In this study, only four rice cultivars were considered after
    the booting stage, and the early growth of rice has yet to be monitored. Establishing
    a standardized water stress detection and diagnosis system based on water critical
    thresholds at various growth stages of rice will require the accumulation of data
    from multi-year, multi-point, continuous trials based on different rice variety
    types. This can accurately monitor the LWC to ensure high rice yield, improving
    water resource utilization efficiency and providing a basis for implementing precision
    agriculture. Conclusion In this study, the LWC of rice with different cultivars,
    years, and water treatments was monitored based on multi-source data (physiological
    and ecological indicators and spectral information) with machine learning, explored
    the performance of single and combined multi-source data in LWC monitoring, and
    utilized different physiological indicators to establish two monitoring models
    for the growth differences of rice in the initial and middle stages. The results
    displayed that ND + CWSI had better monitoring performance in the early stage
    (booting to flowering stage), while ND + Fv/Fm was better in the late stage (initial
    to middle grain filling stage). Additionally, this study''s newly constructed
    vegetation index ND(1287,1673) also has good monitoring capacities for LWC in
    rice. Meanwhile, the machine learning algorithm (GBDT) further improves the monitoring
    performance of the model. In summary, this study confirms that using multi-source
    data and machine learning can improve the performance of hyperspectral prediction
    of rice LWC. Availability of data and materials The datasets used and/or analyzed

  description: Dynamics of vegetation in arid areas have drawn worldwide attention.
    The expansion of irrigated cropland (ICE) in arid regions contributes to increased
    food security and impacts on the extent and development of regional vegetation.
    However, the quantitative attribution of vegetation growth variation from ICE
    and biogeochemical factors (e.g., atmospheric CO2 concentration, climatic factors)
    is still lacking. Here, we assessed key drivers of vegetation growth in the inland
    arid region of Northwest China (IANC) from 1982 to 2018, including ICE, increased
    nitrogen rates, elevated atmospheric CO2 concentration (eCO2) and climate drivers,
    using normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) and ecosystem gross primary
    productivity (GPP) as measures. These variables were quantified through trend
    decomposition, machine learning algorithms, and a satellite-based model. The results
    show that vegetation growth was increased in IANC mainly due to eCO2 and ICE.
    After 1995, as the regional climatic aridity intensified, the CO2 fertilization
    effect on vegetation growth decreased, as the atmospheric CO2 concentration continued
    to increase. Meanwhile, irrigated cropland area increased sharply, and ICE-driven
    GPP variation exceeded that driven by eCO2 in the whole region, while the ICE-driven
    NDVI variation exceeded that due to eCO2 when the ICE reached 6.38%. The ICE effect
    on regional vegetation growth rather than the CO2 fertilization effect has mitigated
    the slowdown of the rate of vegetation growth caused by climate changes. Although
    the ICE is conducive to food security and continuous greening of arid areas, further
    reclamation will exacerbate water scarcity. Our results provide research base
    for identifying the scale of sustainable agricultural development.

    for identifying the scale of sustainable agricultural development. Highlights
    Vegetation growth was enhanced in Northwest China mainly due to the CO2 fertilization
    effect and irrigation expansion during 1982–2018. The effect of irrigation on
    vegetation growth approached or even outweighed that of elevated atmospheric CO2
    concentration after 1995. The effect of irrigation expansion mitigates the slowdown
    of vegetation growth trend, instead of the CO2 fertilization effect. Introduction
    Satellite observations have shown that since the 1980s, global vegetation has
    exhibited an overall greening. Despite this, some areas show browning trends [5,
    28, 32, 50, 56]. After the mid-1990s, due to the intensification of drought condition,
    the intensity and extent of vegetation browning expanded, resulting in a stalling
    or reversal of vegetation greening in different parts of the world [28, 31, 50].
    Although the trends of vegetation growth in some regions have declined, there
    are still regions that continue greening as a result of land-use management. In
    recent years, to protect and restore degraded forest ecosystems, many countries
    have implemented a series of forest restoration projects, such as the Three North
    Shelterbelt Development Program and the Grain to Green Program in China, the New
    York Forest Declaration and the Bonn Challenge [4, 20, 39, 52]. In addition, expanding
    the sown area through irrigation and fertilization increases crop yield [25],
    which not only enhances food security, but also promotes regional greenness. Studies
    have shown that since 2000, the increase in global vegetation growth is mainly
    caused by the greening of forests and cropland [4]. Many studies have attached
    great importance to the impact of afforestation on regional vegetation growth
    [4, 21, 33, 40]. However, the quantitative effects of expansion of irrigated cropland
    (ICE) on NDVI and GPP are still uncertain. Vegetation growth dynamics are influenced
    by a combination of factors, including biogeochemical factors, as well as land-use-related
    drivers (e.g., land use changes and agricultural management measures) [32, 56].
    Globally, elevated atmospheric CO2 concentration (eCO2) is considered to be the
    most important driver of vegetation greening [56]. In arid regions, climate change
    has had an important impact on vegetation growth [9, 26, 56]. Recently, as atmospheric
    CO2 concentration continues to increase, the warming-induced atmospheric aridity
    is intensifying, which generates a negative impact on vegetation growth [27, 31,
    50]. Studies have shown that the physiological response of plants to eCO2 can
    enhance leaf photosynthesis, improve water use efficiency [7], and alleviate some
    of the impact of atmospheric drought on vegetation growth [2, 48]. However, some
    studies have reported that enhanced vegetation growth means more water and nutrients
    consumption, aggravating the water scarcity in arid regions [8, 22], and the CO2
    fertilization effect will decrease due to water and nutrient limitations [17,
    38, 42, 44]. These indicate that in drier conditions, the fertilization effect
    of CO2 may decrease. A critical gap in our understanding pertains to the synergy
    and antagonism between different drivers. The inland arid region of Northwest
    China (IANC) is located in the hinterland of the Eurasian continent (Additional
    file 1: Fig. S1a). It is an important strategic place of the ancient and modern
    ‘Silk Road’. It covers an area of 2.115 million km2, equivalent to about half
    of the area of the European Union. Four of the eight deserts in China are completely
    contained in the IANC, and two deserts are adjacent to it. Among them, the Taklimakan
    Desert is the largest desert in China and the second largest mobile desert in
    the world. The agriculture in IANC is highly dependent on irrigation, and the
    oasis agriculture formed at the edge of the desert has become important ecological
    barrier. Since the mid-1990s, large-scale ICE has taken place to meet the surging
    food demand, increasing the area of irrigated cropland by about 55% (Additional
    file 1: Figs. S2b, S3). In addition, over the last few decades IANC has experienced
    remarkable climatic warming, and the relative humidity decreased significantly
    after 1990s (Additional file 1: Figs. S2c, S4c), which has had an impact on regional
    ecological vegetation. It is urgent to clarify the impacts of various factors
    on regional vegetation growth in such an ecologically fragile environment, and
    it is necessary to explore the interaction between human activities and ‘natural’
    factors, as well as different ‘natural’ factors to ensure food security and ecological
    health in this and other arid regions. In this paper, satellite-based GIMMS3g
    NDVI and MODIS NDVI data sets were used to show the greening pattern in IANC from
    1982 to 2018. We then quantified the effects of biogeochemical factors (including
    atmospheric CO2 concentration and climate) and land-use-related drivers (including
    ICE and change of nitrogen fertilization per unit area) on IANC’s NDVI variation
    in the growing season (from May to October). This was achieved through trend decomposition
    and three machine learning algorithms. In addition, the cumulative GPP in the
    growing season was calculated using a revised remote sensing-based light use efficiency
    (LUE) model, and model experiments were performed to quantify the effects of various
    factors on ecosystem productivity. Methods Data sets The data used in this paper
    include satellite remote sensing data, meteorological data, reanalysis data, and
    statistical yearbook data. The time period, temporal and spatial resolutions,
    and sources of the data are shown in Additional file 1: Table S1. Vegetation greenness
    As an indicator of vegetation greenness, the satellite-based NDVI data was used
    in this study, including the GIMMS3g NDVI and the MOD13A3 NDVI (see details in
    Additional file 1: Table S1). The multi-year monthly average values of GIMMS3g
    NDVI in IANC were calculated, and the months with NDVI greater than 0.1 were designated
    as the growing season (from May to October). The growing season NDVI was integrated
    by taking the average value from May to October. The GIMMS3g NDVI is represented
    on a resolution of 0.0833°. The MOD13A3 NDVI was resampled to the same spatial
    resolution as the GIMMS3g NDVI by the nearest neighbour method, and the variation
    and magnitude of the GIMMS3g NDVI and the MOD13A3 NDVI were almost the same in
    the study area (Additional file 1: Fig. S5). Therefore, the MOD13A3 NDVI was used
    to supplement the GIMMS3g NDVI to obtain vegetation greenness information for
    a longer time period (1982–2018). Human activities Two land use data sets (see
    Additional file 1: Table S1 for details) were collected as indicators of spatial
    change in regional irrigated cropland area from 1982 to 2018, and the irrigated
    cropland area and its changes displayed in these two sets of data are highly consistent
    (Additional file 1: Fig. S3). By summing the cropland area of all 0.00833° pixels
    in each 0.0833° pixel, the data were aggregated to the same spatial resolution
    as the NDVI data. We used data on nitrogen application per unit area in Xinjiang
    and the Hexi Corridor from the Xinjiang Statistical Yearbook and the Gansu Development
    Yearbook. In addition, spatial nitrogen application data were obtained from a
    global data set [23]. There was a significant linear correlation between the nitrogen
    fertilization data in the statistical yearbook and the global data set (Additional
    file 1: Fig. S6a), so the statistical yearbook data were used to correct and extend
    the data in the global data set. Meteorological data and atmospheric CO2 concentration
    data Meteorological data mainly came from the China National Meteorological Center.
    The data collected at 110 meteorological stations were interpolated to 0.0833°
    spatial grid data using the nearest neighbor method. The cumulative solar radiation
    for the growing season was calculated from the solar radiation data in the re-analyzed
    data set and the record of sunshine hours from the meteorological stations. Atmospheric
    CO2 concentration data observed at the Global Atmospheric Background Station at
    Waliguan was obtained from the National Cryosphere Desert Data Center. Waliguan
    Station is the only atmospheric background observation station in the inland region
    of the Northern Hemisphere, and its observations reflect the atmospheric greenhouse
    gas concentrations and their changes in the mid-latitude inland regions of the
    Northern Hemisphere. In addition, longer observation from the Mauna Loa Observatory
    was obtained from the Global Monitoring Laboratory. The interannual variations
    in CO2 data from the two stations were highly consistent (Additional file 1: Fig.
    S6b), so the observations from Mauna Loa Observatory were used in calculations.
    Trend change point detection The Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) and segmented
    regression [1] (a linear regression that modifies its slope at a certain value
    of the predictor, or threshold) were used to determine the trend change points
    of interannual variations of observation elements. We used AIC to choose the model
    that best-fitted the data. When non-linear regression (e.g., quadratic function)
    was a better fit to the data, trend change point may be present, and in these
    cases, the trend change point is defined by segmented regression. The segmented
    regressions were achieved through the ‘SiZer’ package in R, and the bootstrap
    sampling on each database was set 1000 times, with a confidence interval of 95%.
    After AIC judgement, we found that there were trend change points in the trends
    of ‘growing season’ mean GIMMS3g NDVI in the natural vegetation zone, the irrigated
    cropland area, and the relative humidity. The trend change points of the above
    three elements are 1990, 1995 and 1992 respectively (Additional file 1: Fig. S2).
    We selected 1995 as the dividing point between the early and later periods, because
    1995 is not only the change point for the trend in irrigated cropland area, but
    also falls within the 95% confidence interval of the trend change points for natural
    vegetation NDVI and relative humidity (Additional file 1: Fig. S2). Effect of
    ICE on NDVI calculated by trend decomposition We used the trend decomposition
    method to quantify the effect of ICE on NDVI. We use a linear trend to represent
    the change in NDVI over a period of time. First, we calculated the growing season
    NDVI trend of each 0.0833° pixel (pel0.0833) from1982 to 2018. Secondly, the pels0.0833
    with the proportion of cropland greater than 10% were identified as cropland pixels
    in 1982 and 2018, and then the cropland change pixels between 1982 and 2018 (hereinafter
    referred to as ICE pixels) were identified (Additional file 1: Fig. S7a). The
    pels0.0833 with the proportion of natural vegetation (uncultivated vegetation)
    greater than 60% coverage, both in 1982 and 2018, were defined as natural vegetation
    pixels. The proportions of cropland and natural vegetation were derived from the
    land use data products. We then decomposed the NDVI trends of ICE pixels by considering
    two cases: a) If there was natural vegetation in the ICE pixel before 1982, it
    was considered that the NDVI variation trend caused by ICE was the actual NDVI
    trend minus the reference trend value [Eq. (1)]. b) If there was no natural vegetation
    in the ICE pixel before 1982, it was considered that the variation of NDVI was
    caused by ICE [Eq. (2)]: (1) (2) Where represents the NDVI trend caused by ICE
    in the ICE pixel, represents the actual NDVI trend in the corresponding pel0.0833,
    and represents the reference trend value which is calculated at the grid with
    spatial resolution of 0.75° (grid0.75) (Additional file 1: Fig. S7c). Each grid0.75
    contains 81 pels0.0833. The is calculated by averaging the NDVI trends of all
    natural vegetation pixels in the grid0.75. It should be noted that we assume that
    at each grid0.75, all pels0.0833 have the same climate background and are taken
    to have experienced the same agricultural management measures. Through the above
    operation, we calculated the effects of ICE on NDVI in ICE pixels. However, the
    pels0.0833 that had cropland before 1982 and the pels0.0833 with small change
    in the irrigated cropland area were ignored. Where there was a significant linear
    correlation between cropland area change and NDVI variation (Additional file 1:
    Fig. S7b), the NDVI variation caused by ICE was spatially extrapolated through
    the actual irrigated cropland proportion of change of the pel0.0833 and the of
    the grid0.75 where the pel0.0833 is located [Eqs. (3), (4)]: (3) (4) where is
    actual cropland proportion changes of the ICE pixels; is the NDVI trend caused
    by the change of unit cropland proportion in the ICE pixels, and the is the average
    value of in a grid0.75; is the NDVI trend caused by the ICE (Additional file 1:
    Fig. S7d), and is the actual irrigated cropland proportion changes in the pels0.0833.
    Machine learning algorithms for estimating the effects of various factors on NDVI
    Three machine learning algorithms (Additional file 1: Table S2) were used to model
    and estimate NDVI with variation in different biogeochemical factors (atmospheric
    CO2 concentration, photosynthetically active radiation, relative humidity and
    air temperature) and human activities (irrigated cropland area, nitrogen fertilization).
    Satellite-derived growing season mean NDVI data were used for model training and
    verification. If the numbers of target data are small, the machine learning algorithm
    may ‘over fit’. Therefore, we used grid0.75 as the calculation unit to expand
    the sample size. We had 81 pels0.0833 in each grid0.75, and each pel0.0833 contained
    35 years of data, that is, there were 2835 samples at each grid0.75 for model
    construction. 70% of the samples were randomly selected for model training and
    the remaining 30% for testing. Through the random search and the cross validation,
    the optimal parameters were selected for each grid. We use the coefficient of
    determination (R2) between the simulated values and observed values in the test
    set as the evaluation metric for the model, and our results suggest that machine
    learning algorithms can effectively estimate NDVI (Additional file 1: Fig. S8).
    Among them, the simulation efficiency of the Random Forest and MLP Neural Network
    is superior to that of the Support Vector Machine. We synthesized the results
    of the three models by calculating their average. We calculated the effects of
    various drivers on variation of NDVI through model experiments. Firstly, we made
    all factors change over time to calculate (a normal model run). Next, we kept
    the variable x constant (e.g., ICE, eCO2) to calculate with other factors changing
    over time. The difference between and is the NDVI variation driven by variable
    x: (5) where is the NDVI variation driven by variable x in the ith year. The trend
    of NDVI driven by x was calculated by the least square method. The sensitivity
    of NDVI to the ICE was analyzed through linear regression. The calculation equation
    is as follows: (6) where is the NDVI variation driven by ICE between 1982 and
    2018 in the kth grid0.75, and is ICE proportion (i.e., the proportion of irrigated
    cropland area to total vegetation area between 1982 and 2018) in the kth grid0.75;
    is the sensitivity of NDVI to ICE; is the residual term. Regional productivity
    estimation and attribution A revised light use efficiency (LUE) model was used
    to estimate regional productivity of vegetation (GPP), and the calculation equation
    is as follows [10, 50]: (7) where PAR is photosynthetically active radiation,
    calculated as 1/2 of the solar radiation (unit: MJ/m2/month); FPAR is the fraction
    of PAR absorbed by the vegetation canopy, which can be calculated by NDVI [Eq.
    (8)] [3]; is the maximum LUE, and we take the fixed empirical value of 2.76 g
    C/MJ [12, 37, 50] to prevent the effects of some factors from being repeatedly
    considered; , and represent the downward-regulation scalars for the respective
    effects of eCO2, air temperature and moisture conditions on the LUE [3, 10, 29,
    50, 53]. The effect of atmospheric CO2 concentration on LUE ( ) was obtained from
    the work of Yuan et al. [50], and see details in the supplementary information.
    was calculated by mean air temperature ( , unit: ) and the optimal air temperature
    which is the average temperature of the month with the largest NDVI in a year
    [10] (see details in the supplementary information). was calculated using regional
    evapotranspiration (ET) and potential evapotranspiration [PET, Eq. (9)]. The regional
    ET was obtained through the GLASS ET product [49] and PET was calculated using
    the Hargreaves equation [Eq. (10)]: (8) (9) (10) where and represent the maximum
    and minimum air temperature in the calculation period, respectively (unit: ).
    is the theoretical solar radiation at the top of the atmosphere (unit: MJ/m2/month);
    the is the conversion coefficient with a value of 9.39 × 10–4. In the cropland
    zone, we made some adjustments to the above LUE model. In addition to natural
    factors, we also considered the effects of ICE and nitrogen fertilization on GPP.
    The calculation is as follows: (11) We found that there was a significant linear
    correlation between the ICE and regional ET, so we substituted this relationship
    into Eq. (9) to obtain : (12) (13) here, a and b are the coefficients in the regression
    equation between ET and ICE, which were quantified by the ET of GLASS products
    and irrigated cropland area in the land use data set, and each pel0.0833 has specific
    values of a and b. Within a certain range, there is a stable proportional relationship
    between biomass and GPP [16, 24], so we collected nitrogen fertilization and biomass
    data for three main crops (corn, wheat and cotton) in IANC to quantify . Wheat,
    corn, and cotton occupy 22.4%, 15.4%, and 31.8% of the planting area, respectively.
    Over the years, these three crops together have consistently comprised around
    70% of the total cultivated area. The regression relationship between nitrogen
    fertilization and relative biomass (biomass after nitrogen application divided
    by biomass without nitrogen application) was established, and the AIC was used
    for judgment. The results showed that there was a significant quadratic function
    relationship between nitrogen fertilization and relative biomass (Additional file
    1: Fig. S9a). We integrated data of different crops to establish a unified relationship
    (Additional file 1: Fig. S9b). The revised LUE model was verified by the GPP observation
    data for the experimental sites, and the simulated results matched well with the
    observed values (Additional file 1: Fig. S10). GPP was then calculated by weighted
    averaging based on the proportions of cropland and natural vegetation in each
    of the pels0.0833: (14) where represents the GPP in the jth pel0.0833; and represent
    the GPP of cropland and natural vegetation, respectively in the jth pel0.0833;
    and represent the proportions of cropland and natural vegetation area in the jth
    pel0.0833. We performed numerical simulations to evaluate the effects of various
    factors on GPP with the revised LUE model. In the LUE model, various factors affect
    GPP through two aspects: on one hand, drivers regulate GPP by affecting the FPAR
    which is calculated directly through NDVI, so we call this path the FPAR variable
    [Eq. (8)]; on the other hand, GPP is affected by various factors through controlling
    the downward-regulation scalars (e.g., , ) of the LUE, and we call this path LUE
    variable [Eq. (16)]: (15) (16) where NFER is the nitrogen fertilization and RH
    is the relative humidity. In the normal model run, all variables changed with
    time both in the FPAR path and LUE path, which we called . Next, we calculated
    by allowing other factors to change over time while holding the variable x constant
    at its initial baseline level in the LUE path and substituting NDVI with the in
    the FPAR path. was calculated by keeping the variable x to maintain the initial
    value and other factors to change over time in the machine learning algorithm
    models mentioned above. The difference between and is the GPP variation driven
    by variable x [Eq. (17)]. In addition, we conducted another set of simulation
    experiments by substituting NDVI with the in the FPAR path and making all variables
    change with time in the LUE path, which was named . The difference between and
    is the GPP variation driven by variable x through the LUE path [Eq. (18)]: (17)
    (18) where is the GPP variation driven by variable x in the ith year, and is the
    GPP variation driven by variable x through the LUE path. The trend of GPP driven
    by x was calculated by the least square method. In the same way, the sensitivity
    of GPP to the change of ICE was analyzed through linear regression: (19) where
    is the GPP variation driven by ICE between 1982 and 2018 in the kth grid0.75,
    and is the ICE proportion (i.e., the proportion of the total vegetation area which
    is irrigated cropland area), a value which changes between 1982 and 2018 in the
    kth grid0.75; is the sensitivity of GPP to ICE; is the residual term. Results
    Vegetation growth changes in IANC The GIMMS3g NDVI data showed the interannual
    variation of the average NDVI during the growing season in IANC, with the trends
    of NDVI calculated by the least square method, as shown in Fig. 1a, b, c. The
    trends were tested and the trend change points were determined by the AIC and
    segmented regressions. From 1982 to 2015, the NDVI increased significantly, especially
    in the cropland zone (Fig. 1a, b). The NDVI trends are 0.000572 yr−1 (p = 3.77e-8)
    and 0.00154 yr−1 (p = 1.5e-11) for the whole area and the cropland zone, respectively.
    The trend change point was found in the NDVI variation in the natural vegetation
    zone (mainly woodland and grassland) (Additional file 1: Fig. S2a). Since the
    1990s, the growth rate of natural vegetation NDVI has slowed down. The study period
    was divided into two periods, before and after 1995. The NDVI in the natural vegetation
    zone increased significantly over the early period (from 1982 to 1995), but the
    growth trend in the later period (from 1995 to 2018) decreased by 84.4% compared
    with the early period, and the slope became statistically insignificant (Fig.
    1c). Figure 2a, c, d shows the spatial distributions of GIMMS3g NDVI trends. After
    1995, the intensity and extent of vegetation browning increased significantly,
    but the cropland zones in the central part of Northern Xinjiang, the Tarim River
    Basin, and the central and western Hexi Corridor continued greening (Fig. 2a,
    c, d, Additional file 1: Fig. S1). In addition, the MOD13A3 NDVI data also shows
    that from 2001 to 2018, the vegetation greenness in the cropland zone increased
    significantly during the growing season, and the zones with vegetation browning
    were mainly concentrated in the mid-range of the Tianshan Mountains and the northern
    mountainous area of Northern Xinjiang (Fig. 2b, Additional file 1: Fig. S1), which
    was consistent with the GIMMS3g NDVI result. Fig. 1 Variations of vegetation growth

    of the fitted curves. In panels (c, f), we divided two periods, before and after

    We used the revised LUE model to estimate regional GPP [10, 50]. The results of
    the revised LUE model matched well with the measured GPP at the ground experimental
    sites, especially in the cropland zone (Additional file 1: Fig. S10). We also
    verified the result of revised LUE model by comparing it with other GPP products.
    The cumulative GPP in the growing season estimated by the revised LUE model is
    close to the GLASS GPP product, and is consistent with the variation of MODIS
    GPP, but the value is greater than that of MODIS GPP (Additional file 1: Fig.
    S11). From 1982 to 2018, the cumulative GPP in the growing season in IANC increased
    significantly. The GPP trends are 2.77 g C m−2 yr−1 (p = 9.46e-13) and 9.29 g
    C m−2 yr−1 (p = 2.08e-16) for the whole area and the cropland zone, respectively
    (Fig. 1d, e). After 1995, the growth of GPP in the natural vegetation zone stalled.
    The increasing rate of GPP at the late period of the natural vegetation zone decreased
    by 79.1% compared with the early period (Fig. 1f). Attribution of vegetation growth
    trend The relative importance of various factors in the attribution calculated
    by the three machine learning algorithms are basically consistent (Additional
    file 1: Fig. S12a), and we integrated the results of the three models by averaging.
    The machine learning algorithms and trend decomposition method showed similar
    effects of ICE on NDVI (Additional file 1: Fig. S12b). Figure 3 shows the attribution
    of NDVI trend obtained from the model experiments using the machine learning algorithms.
    ICE was the dominant factor in NDVI variation in the cropland zone, explaining
    61% (61.12 ± 9.78%) of NDVI variation (Fig. 3a). In the natural vegetation zone,
    NDVI variation was mainly due to eCO2 (Fig. 3b). Over the whole region, the effect
    of eCO2 also dominated, explaining 70% (70.25 ± 7.72%) of the NDVI variation (Fig.
    3c). Among the climatic factors, change in relative humidity had the greatest
    effect on NDVI, and the relative humidity-driven NDVI trend is significantly negative
    in both cropland zone and natural vegetation zone (Fig. 3a, b). From 1982 to 1995,
    the regional relative humidity increased, and the NDVI trend driven by relative
    humidity was positive as well. In the late period (1995–2018), due to the significant
    decline of regional relative humidity, the NDVI trend driven by relative humidity
    also became negative (Additional files 1: Figs. S4c and Fig. 3d, e, f). After
    1995, the effect of ICE on NDVI trend increased substantially, while the effect
    of eCO2 decreased (Fig. 3d, e, f). ICE showed an equally significant effect on
    NDVI variation as did eCO2 during the latter part of the study period (ICE: 0.356 ± 0.502,
    eCO2: 0.408 ± 0.992, unit: 10–3 yr−1) in the whole region (Fig. 3f). Fig. 3 Attribution
    of variation in NDVI calculated from model experiments with three machine learning
    algorithms. In panel (a), (b), (c), the effects of various factors on NDVI in
    the cropland zone, the natural vegetation zone and the whole region are shown
    respectively from 1982 to 2018, while panel (d), (e), (f) represent the attribution
    of NDVI variation in the two periods. The “early” notation indicates the period
    of 1982–1995, and “late” indicates 1995–2018. The drivers include irrigated cropland
    expansion (ES_ICE), nitrogen fertilization change (ES_NFER), elevated atmospheric
    CO2 concentration (ES_eCO2), photosynthetically active radiation change (ES_PAR),
    relative humidity change (ES_RH) and air temperature change (ES_Ta). ES_ALL notation
    indicates the result of model simulation with all factors changing over time.
    Error bars show the 95% confidence intervals of the trends. Two asterisks indicate
    that the trend is extremely significant (P < 0.01), and one asterisk indicates
    that the trend is significant (P < 0.05) Full size image Model experiments were
    conducted through the revised LUE model to quantify the effects of various factors
    on GPP variation. In the cropland zone, ICE is the dominant factor in GPP variation,
    explaining 58% (57.93 ± 11.66%) of the GPP trend (Fig. 4a). In the natural vegetation
    zone, as well as the whole region, the eCO2 had the greatest influence on GPP
    variation (Fig. 4b, c), which is consistent with the attribution of NDVI trend.
    However, over the whole region, the contribution of ICE to GPP trend reached 42%
    (41.99 ± 8.45%), which was close to that of eCO2 (49.79 ± 12.43%) (Fig. 4c). The
    effects of various factors on GPP trend were also analyzed in two periods (Fig.
    4d, e, f), and the GPP trend driven by relative humidity change was positive at
    the early period and negative at the late period. The effect of eCO2 decreased
    during the late period, while the effect of ICE increased significantly, and the
    ICE-driven GPP trend over the whole zone exceeded that of eCO2 at the late period
    (ICE: 1.30 ± 0.229, eCO2: 0.800 ± 0.265, unit: g C m−2 yr−1) (Fig. 4f). Fig. 4
    Attribution of trend in GPP calculated by model experiments of revised LUE model.
    In panel (a), (b), (c), the effects of various factors on GPP in the cropland
    zone, the natural vegetation zone and the whole region are shown respectively
    from 1982 to 2018, while panel (d), (e), (f) represent the attribution of GPP
    trend in the two periods. The “early” notation indicates the period of 1982–1995,
    and “late” notation indicates 1995–2018. The drivers include irrigated cropland
    expansion (ES_ICE), nitrogen fertilization change (ES_NFER), elevated atmospheric
    CO2 concentration (ES_eCO2), photosynthetically active radiation change (ES_PAR),
    relative humidity change (ES_RH) and temperature change (ES_Ta). ES_ALL notation
    indicates the result of model simulation with all factors changing over time.
    Error bars show the 95% confidence intervals of the trends. Two asterisks indicate
    that the trend is extremely significant (P < 0.01), and one asterisk indicates
    that the trend is significant (P < 0.05) Full size image ICE threshold The percentage
    of the change of irrigated cropland area as a function of total vegetation area
    (ICE proportion) reached 5.25% by 2018. As the ICE proportion grows, the ICE-driven
    NDVI (or GPP) variation becomes greater, and eventually exceeds the effect of
    eCO2. The relationships of the ICE-driven NDVI and GPP variations against ICE
    proportion between 1982 and 2018 were calculated spatially [Eq. (6), (19)], and
    showed significant linear correlations (Fig. 5). This means that the sensitivities
    of NDVI and GPP variations to ICE are consistent in the spatial grids0.75, with
    values of 0.0022 for NDVI and 12.9 for GPP. During the whole period, only if the
    ICE proportion reaches 10.4%, ICE-driven NDVI variation can exceed the eCO2 effect
    in the whole region (Fig. 5a), while the threshold for ICE-driven GPP variation
    exceeded eCO2-driven GPP variation is 6.55% (Fig. 5b). Since regional irrigated
    cropland began to expand after 1995, the ICE-driven vegetation growth variation
    in the late period was close to that recorded during the entire period. The GPP
    variation driven by ICE outstripped that by eCO2 when the ICE proportion exceeded
    4.37% in the late period. The ICE-driven NDVI variation reached a level equivalent
    to the eCO2 effect in the late period, when the ICE proportion increases to 6.38%
    (Fig. 5). Fig. 5 Threshold of the ICE-driven NDVI and GPP variation ( and ) outpace
    that of eCO2. ICE proportion is the percentage of the change of irrigated cropland

    and ( ) between 1982 and 2018 in the whole region. The “ + ” represent ICE proportion
    and ( ) between 1995 and 2018 in the whole region Full size image Discussion Effects
    of ICE on NDVI and GPP The term ‘Vegetation growth dynamics’ is often used with
    reference to changes in vegetation structures and functions, which are affected
    both by natural drivers and by human activities. As such, such growth dynamics
    can play a critical role in the material and energy flows of ecosystems [11, 32].
    The growth dynamics of vegetation can be quantified by various indicators, such
    as vegetation greenness, vegetation cover, and ecosystem productivity [13, 21,
    45]. Satellite-based NDVI represents vegetation greenness, which can reflect the
    capacity of vegetation to absorb PAR, as well as the extent of vegetation coverage.
    The ecosystem productivity quantified by GPP represents the carbon sequestration
    capacity of vegetation and is an important indicator of the amount of carbon cycling
    between ecosystems and the atmosphere [6, 36]. The annual precipitation in the
    desert oasis area in northwest China is less than 200 mm, and the natural vegetation
    cover is mainly desert steppe and low shrubs [47]. Since the mid-1990s, substantial
    areas of cropland have been developed and improved in the region through diverting
    water for irrigation to previously uncultivated areas and to grassy areas in IANC.
    This has resulted in enhanced vegetation growth regionally. The ICE in IANC supplements
    the water and nutrient conditions required for vegetation growth through irrigation
    and fertilization, which promotes regional vegetation greening, increases fixation
    of CO2 by plants and further increases ecosystem productivity [43, 51, 55]. After
    1995, ICE in IANC had a significant positive effect on regional vegetation growth,
    and had a greater effect than NDVI on GPP (Figs. 3c, f and 4c, f). In the LUE
    model, GPP is calculated by multiplying the PAR, FPAR, and LUE [Eq. (15)], where
    FPAR is related to vegetation greenness and can be estimated by NDVI. The environmental
    factors that affect FPAR also affect the LUE. Figure S13 shows the GPP trends
    for the whole region from 1982 to 2018 driven by environmental variables through
    effects on LUE. During this period, the ICE contribution was the most significant
    of that of all driving variables (Additional file 1: Fig. S13c). As a result,
    ICE not only increases NDVI, which improves the ability of the vegetation canopy
    to absorb PAR, but more importantly, increases LUE, and further improves regional
    carbon sequestration. ICE has slowed the decline of vegetation growth in the region
    Plant photosynthesis is enhanced as by the climate change-driven enhancement of
    atmospheric CO2 concentration and this can significantly promote vegetation growth.
    In addition, the physiological response of plant leaves to eCO2 can improve water
    use efficiency [7]. Globally, eCO2 is considered the most important factor in
    vegetation greening [32, 56]. However, climate change is also increasing air temperatures,
    crop water losses and the development of drought on all continents of the world
    [15, 48], thereby adversely affecting plant growth [18, 35, 50]. Some studies
    suggest that the positive influence of eCO2 on vegetation growth can offset the
    negative impact of climatic drought, which can avoid further expansion of drylands
    [2, 48]. However, an increasing number of studies also show that the CO2 fertilization
    effect is reduced by the limitation of water and nutrient conditions in the ecosystem
    [17, 34, 42, 44]. The observed data from meteorological stations show that since
    the 1980s, the air temperature and precipitation in IANC have increased. The early
    precipitation trend is 2.00 mm/yr, and the later precipitation trend is 1.11 mm/yr,
    which decreased by 45% compared with the earlier period. However, the air temperature
    continued to rise, and the relative humidity increased significantly in the early
    period and decreased significantly in the later period. As a result, the regional
    climatic aridity intensified in more recent time (Additional file 1: Fig. S4).
    We found that as the relative humidity-driven NDVI and GPP trends changed from
    positive to negative, the fertilization effect of CO2 on NDVI and GPP also decreased
    (Figs. 3d, e, f and 4d, e, f), although the atmospheric CO2 concentration continued
    to increase (Fig. S6b). In the later period, the natural vegetation is 0.338 0.094
    (unit: 10–3 yr−1) and the is − 0.15 0.119 ( : -0.298 0.568, unit: g C m−2 yr−1,
    Figs. 3e and 4e). The fertilization effect of CO2 alleviated the effect of drought,
    but its effect was not enough to alleviate the decline of NDVI and GPP trends.
    The trends of NDVI and GPP in cropland zone did not decrease as in natural vegetation
    zone, mainly due to the significant positive impact of ICE (Figs. 3d and 4d).
    The results of this paper show that in arid regions, it is ICE that mitigates
    the decline of vegetation growth trend, rather than the CO2 fertilization effect,
    in the case of intensified climatic drought. In addition, over the entire region,
    the effect of ICE on the NDVI or GPP variation, was close to or even has outpaced
    that of eCO2 at the late period (Figs. 3f and 4f). Our results indicate that the
    impact of ICE on vegetation growth has kept pace with the CO2 fertilization effect
    in IANC, which is due to the significant increase in irrigated cropland area and
    the reduced effect of eCO2 in the later years of the period under study. In summary,
    ICE plays a significant role in the growth of vegetation in arid regions. We highlight
    the role of ICE, which on one hand confirms the importance of water availability
    in arid areas. Although the fertilization effect of CO2 has a considerable impact
    on vegetation growth, the limitation of water conditions still predominates in
    arid regions [19, 32, 54]. On the other hand, we emphasize the impact of human
    activities on fragile ecosystems, which continuously challenge natural regulatory
    capacities. This finding is consistent with many other research results [4, 30].
    ICE may exacerbate regional water conflicts in the future The fertilization effect
    of CO2 and human land use management promote regional vegetation growth, however,
    vegetation expansion, especially the increase of the afforestation and cropland,
    will exacerbate regional water conflicts in arid regions [8, 22]. In recent years,
    as the population grows rapidly and the demand for food increases, more and more
    land has been reclaimed. The data from the statistical yearbook show that the
    agricultural production in the northwest region has significantly increased, ensuring
    regional food security (Additional file 1: Fig. S14). More output means more water
    consumption, and agricultural water consumption also significantly increases (Additional
    file 1: Fig. S14). For the total amount of water resources in the region remains
    stable, the increase of agricultural water use will inevitably crowd out ecological
    water use, which will lead to the cutoff of downstream inland rivers and the formation
    of more groundwater table drop funnels. Terrestrial water storage observations
    from NASA’s Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) satellite mission
    have revealed significant decline in regional water resources (Additional file
    1: Fig. S14). The soil drought in some areas will intensify, and the natural vegetation
    will be affected and even face the threat of death, which will have an adverse
    impact on the regional ecology [14]. Facing the twofold pressure of water shortage
    and the adverse effects of climate change, maintaining an appropriate scale of
    irrigated cropland is critical for ensuring food security and ecological health
    in IANC in the future. Assessment of data and methodological reliability In this
    study, we employed multiple sources of data and a variety of methodologies to
    demonstrate the impact of natural factors and human activities on regional NDVI
    and GPP. To ensure the reliability and validity of our research findings, we conducted
    a comprehensive evaluation of the completeness and accuracy of the data, as well
    as the appropriateness of the methods. First, we utilized GIMMS3g NDVI and MOD13A3
    NDVI data to study regional greenness variations and as input data for the LUE
    model. These data sets have been widely used and analyzed by many scholars and
    are broadly considered to have high reliability and representativeness [28, 41,
    46, 50]. The driving data, such as climate data and atmospheric carbon dioxide
    concentration, are derived from authoritative observation organizations, ensuring
    high quality. Second, we integrated three machine learning algorithms to attribute
    NDVI, and subdivided larger grids into smaller ones to increase the data volume
    for training models, meeting the requirements of machine learning algorithms.
    The impacts of ICE on NDVI quantified by machine learning algorithms and trend
    decomposition methods are largely consistent, mutually validating each other.
    Finally, we used a revised LUE model to calculate GPP and attributed it. We collected
    real measurement data from four ground stations to validate the results of the
    improved LUE model, which showed that the LUE model performs well (Additional
    file 1: Fig. S10). Although there are certain limitations in the data and methods,
    we have taken measures to address them: (1) Some data have a short time range
    and can only be supplemented with other data to ensure the timeliness of the article.
    We have chosen data with consistent results for mutual verification and supplementation,
    and the supplementation period is short to ensure that it minimally impacts the
    main findings of our study. (2) The research objective of the text is to study
    the overall variation in regional vegetation growth indicators and their attribution.
    Using regional average values provides an overview of large-area trends, facilitating
    comparisons across the entire region, cropland zone, and natural vegetation zone.
    However, this approach lacks a more detailed and nuanced understanding of spatial
    variations, which should be addressed in future work through increased research
    on regional spatial changes. Conclusions Our results show that, from 1982 to 2018,
    vegetation growth was enhanced in IANC mainly under the influence of ICE and eCO2,
    with ICE being the dominant factor in cropland zones. Since the mid-1990s, the
    significantly decreased regional relative humidity has negatively affected vegetation
    growth, and the CO2 fertilization effects on NDVI and GPP also decreased. However,
    the irrigated cropland area has increased sharply, and its positive impact on
    vegetation growth approached or even exceeded that of eCO2 in the later period,
    which has delayed the slowing down of the growth trend. In the whole region, the
    change of irrigated cropland area accounts for 5.25% of the total vegetation area,
    and the variation of GPP driven by ICE reached a level equivalent to that by eCO2
    at the late period when the ICE proportion reached 4.37%, while the ICE-driven
    NDVI variation will outpace the eCO2 effect when the ICE proportion raises to
    above 6.38%. Although our study highlights the positive effect of irrigation cropland
    expansion on vegetation growth in arid areas, further expansion of irrigated cropland
    in the future will exacerbate regional conflict between water demand and supply,
    which may adversely affect the growth of natural vegetation. In the future, the
    ecological impact of ICE needs to be in-depth studied. Availability of data and

  description: Despite dealing with numerous challenges, the agricultural sector in
    Bangladesh is consistently growing every year because of the crop intensification
    efforts in many areas to ensure food security. However, the effect of intensive
    cropping on land use changes remains unclear due to the lack of systematic monitoring.
    This study assesses Land Use Land Cover (LULC) dynamics, particularly in Bhanga
    Upazila (a subdistrict), Bangladesh, using remote sensing and GIS technologies.
    Landsat 5 and 8 satellite imagery to understand the impact of agricultural intensification
    from 1988 to 2023. This study showed that agricultural land utilization was increased
    by more than five times (551.8%) and the built-up area was expanded by 155.6%
    during the study period. This substantial land conversion was expected due to
    the significant decrease of barren and waterbodies by 63.1% and 72.4% at the same
    time respectively. Despite the fact that Bhanga was a typical rural place where
    agriculture had only a 5% (1012 ha) share of its total land (20,309 ha) back in
    1988, Bhanga experienced a notable surge in agricultural land utilization over
    the past three decades from 5.0% in 1988 to 32.5% by 2023, with a temporary dip
    to 2.4% post a devastating flood in 1999. The Normalized Difference Vegetation
    Index (NDVI) and Normalized Difference Water Index (NDWI) analyses justify the
    increase of agricultural and built-up zones, contrasting significant decrease
    in waterbodies and barren areas as detected by RF (Random Forest) machine learning
    algorithm. These findings reveal that crop intensification initiatives convert
    waterbodies and barren lands into croplands. Government policies and supports
    such as various agriculture extension activities, availability of irrigation facilities,
    adaptation of technologies, and improved regional connectivity likely contributed
    to this positive transformation. This study offers crucial insights for policymakers
    to take region-specific customized agricultural strategies to ensure food security
    and sustainability.

    • Showcasing the dynamic nature of agricultural landscapes over time. • Utilizing
    NDVI and NDWI to understand the land use dynamics. • Witnessing significant agricultural
    land utilization: 5.0% (1988) to 32.5% (2023). • Government policy and numerous
    extension efforts propel agricultural land growth. • Proving crucial insights
    to guide policymakers for future sustainable land management. Abstract Despite
    dealing with numerous challenges, the agricultural sector in Bangladesh is consistently
    growing every year because of the crop intensification efforts in many areas to
    ensure food security. However, the effect of intensive cropping on land use changes
    remains unclear due to the lack of systematic monitoring. This study assesses
    Land Use Land Cover (LULC) dynamics, particularly in Bhanga Upazila (a subdistrict),
    Bangladesh, using remote sensing and GIS technologies. Landsat 5 and 8 satellite
    imagery to understand the impact of agricultural intensification from 1988 to
    2023. This study showed that agricultural land utilization was increased by more
    than five times (551.8%) and the built-up area was expanded by 155.6% during the
    study period. This substantial land conversion was expected due to the significant
    decrease of barren and waterbodies by 63.1% and 72.4% at the same time respectively.
    Despite the fact that Bhanga was a typical rural place where agriculture had only
    a 5% (1012 ha) share of its total land (20,309 ha) back in 1988, Bhanga experienced
    a notable surge in agricultural land utilization over the past three decades from
    5.0% in 1988 to 32.5% by 2023, with a temporary dip to 2.4% post a devastating
    flood in 1999. The Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) and Normalized
    Difference Water Index (NDWI) analyses justify the increase of agricultural and
    built-up zones, contrasting significant decrease in waterbodies and barren areas
    as detected by RF (Random Forest) machine learning algorithm. These findings reveal
    that crop intensification initiatives convert waterbodies and barren lands into
    croplands. Government policies and supports such as various agriculture extension
    activities, availability of irrigation facilities, adaptation of technologies,
    and improved regional connectivity likely contributed to this positive transformation.
    This study offers crucial insights for policymakers to take region-specific customized
    agricultural strategies to ensure food security and sustainability. Previous article

    1. Introduction Transformation of land use is a global concern with far-reaching
    implications for food security and ensuring sustainability [1]. In Bangladesh,
    Land Use Land Cover (LULC) dynamics are impacted by a complex interplay among
    agricultural intensification, urbanization, environmental vulnerabilities, and
    socioeconomic factors [2]. The country is densely populated with a land-scarce
    landscape. In addition, the escalating population and rapid urbanization have
    led to substantial changes in land utilization patterns. The transition from rural
    to urban areas, coupled with rapid industrialization put pressure upon agricultural
    lands [3]. To meet the high demand of food for its large population, the Government
    of Bangladesh has taken a series of policy measures and provided numerous financial
    incentives for agricultural intensification. Conversion of agricultural land to
    non-agricultural is common, but in many places, positive transformation is also
    taking place. For instance, due to the inadequate rainfall during the monsoon,
    many waterbodies are coming under agriculture especially in the dry seasons [4].
    In addition, a large area of barren lands is also transformed into crop land by
    utilizing government incentivized technologies and resources such as irrigation
    pumps, fertilizers, high yielding, climate resilient varieties, trainings, and
    demonstration [5,6]. However, to ensure food security with sustainable land utilization,
    proper land management is crucial [7]. Bangladesh, historically an agrarian society,
    relies heavily on agriculture which is also the backbone of its economy [8]. The
    situation is particularly acute due to its limited land availability compared
    to a densely populated landscape. Agricultural activities have traditionally occupied
    around 60% of the total land area [9]. The rich deltaic plains and fertile soil
    provide an ideal environment for rice and other crops cultivation [10]. Additionally,
    this agricultural landscape undergoes continuous evolution due to various factors,
    including technological advancements, changing market demands, and improved transportation
    systems [11]. Adding to the complexity, Bangladesh is susceptible to climate change
    influence, contributing to annual conversions of nearly 1% of agricultural lands
    to non-agricultural uses [9]. This transformation is a direct threat to the nation''s
    food production objectives. On the contrary, agricultural land has increased in
    certain areas in Bangladesh due to multiple factors [12]. For instance, one study
    reported that 73% of fallow land was transformed into agriculture, and waterbodies
    were severely impacted by gradual sand deposition and soil erosion [5]. However,
    population growth remains a primary driver that increases the demand for food,
    prompting the expansion of cultivable lands by converting forests, wetlands, and
    marginal areas into agricultural lands. Technological advancements have also played
    a crucial role, empowering farmers to utilize fallow lands by adopting improved
    irrigation, resilient crop varieties, and better farming practices [13]. Furthermore,
    government policies encouraging agricultural development, including land reclamation
    initiatives, dissemination of advanced agricultural technologies, development
    and distribution of climate-resilient varieties, and subsidies, also contribute
    to this agricultural expansion [14]. Market demands for specific crops often lead
    to the conversion of non-agricultural land to meet these needs. Infrastructure
    development, such as new roads, facilitates access to remote areas and encourages
    agricultural farming [15]. Climate change-induced events like riverbank erosion
    or salinity intrusion decrease arability and sometimes force populations to abandon
    affected areas [16]. Livelihood diversification among rural communities also drives
    the conversion of non-agricultural land to cropped land to generate supplementary
    incomes [17]. Nonetheless, crop intensification meets immediate food demand, and
    it poses some environmental risks like deforestation, biodiversity loss, and soil
    degradation [18]. Sustainable land management policies and practices are crucial
    to mitigate these risks and ensure food security while preserving environmental
    sustainability [19]. Thus, proper monitoring of land use transition and impact
    of crop intensification is essential. Regular monitoring of land use and change
    detection of LULC is foremost for analyzing the dynamics of land use change over
    time and understanding the socio-economic and environmental consequences [20].
    Land use denotes anthropogenic land utilization and land cover represents the
    bio-physical infrastructures or settings on the earth surface which includes the
    distribution of vegetation, croplands, soil, waterbodies, and any other physical
    features [[21], [22], [23]]. LULC maps facilitate to ensure proper spatial planning,
    management, and monitoring of natural resources at local, national, and regional
    levels [12,24,25]. Remote sensing together with GIS are effective tools to produce
    detailed land cover maps [26]. In addition, remote sensing applications have been
    recognized for land monitoring, especially for monitoring of agricultural land
    use change [27]. In contrast, field-level data collection is expensive and time-consuming
    and there is a possibility of erroneous visual interpretations on collected information
    [[27], [28], [29], [30]]. Studies on assessing land use transition using GIS and
    remote sensing technology are still limited in Bangladesh [31]. Previous land
    use transition studies mostly evaluated the impact of climate change in coastal
    areas [32,33], salinity-induced change [34], land use change on the ecosystem
    [35,36], flooding [5,37], urbanization and industrialization [38] monitoring of
    reserve forests including mangrove forests [[39], [40], [41]], and dynamics of
    land surface temperature (LST) [42,43]. These studies represented land use change
    in the classified hot-spot areas and/or on specific man-made or natural events.
    To the best of our knowledge, no study has been conducted to assess the impact
    of crop intensification on land use change dynamics in the non-classified areas
    which represent significant lands in Bangladesh. Therefore, undermining this vast
    area with the underlying change in land use remains unclear for the policymakers
    to take appropriate policy measures. To bridge this knowledge gap, we assessed
    the impact of agricultural intensification on land use change in Bhanga Upazila
    (a subdistrict), Faridpur, Bangladesh over the past three decades by using advanced
    geospatial technology. It is the first study of the detection of spatiotemporal
    change of different LULCs for the low-lying heterogeneous south-central region
    of Bangladesh. In this regard, remote sensing data provide accurate and reliable
    information in a short interval with low cost [44]. The freely available and processed
    remote sensing data play a key role in assessing, mapping, identifying, and monitoring
    the geospatial and temporal change of different surface features over a short
    and long period [45,46]. For instance, the Landsat imagery is a freely available
    online-based remote sensing dataset which is continuously monitored the global
    land use change since 1972 [30]. Landsat-5 Thematic Mapper (TM) and Landsat-8
    Operational Land Imager (OLI) provide satellite data for detecting changes in
    LULC, NDVI, and NDWI [44]. Google Earth Engine is a big geodata processing platform
    that has better computational capacities and is used for geospatial data processing
    over a wide area [47]. In addition, Random Forest (RF) is one of the renowned
    classification algorithms applied in remote sensing for multispectral and hyperspectral
    image classification. RF classification has higher accuracy and shows its strength
    against the overfitting training data [12]. GIS is an integrated approach to collecting,
    storing, analyzing, and finally presenting geographically referenced information
    for decision-making purposes [24]. NDVI and NDWI indices are also used to verify
    the accuracy of LULC classification [48]. The specific objectives of the study
    were: 1) To identify how different types of land use changes happened over the
    specified period. 2) To determine the spatial and temporal changes in agricultural
    landscapes over the past three decades. 1.1. Study area Bhanga Upazila, a sub-district
    of Faridpur district, Bangladesh, was selected for this study due to due to its
    unique combination of rural landscapes and robust agricultural settings. Bhanga
    serves as a representative sample of the broader regions of Bangladesh. Bhanga
    is located in the south-central of Bangladesh with an area of approximately 216.34
    km2 between 23°17′ and 23°28′ north latitudes and 89°55′ and 90°06′ east longitudes,
    approximately (Fig. 1). Download : Download high-res image (878KB) Download :
    Download full-size image Fig. 1. Location map of the study area (Bhanga subdistrict,
    Faridpur district, Bangladesh). Bhanga is surrounded by the river Padma on its
    north and east sides. This region experienced extensive infrastructure developments
    such as the six-lane Dhaka-Bhanga Expressway and the construction Padma Multipurpose
    Bridge (length 6.15km) [49]. These mega infrastructures facilitate substantial
    agriculture development aimed at better communication and nationwide marketing
    opportunities [49]. Especially, Bhanga is a highly agriculture-friendly area due
    to its clay loam soils. It is located in the Arial Khan River floodplain which
    causes silt or alluvial deposition and makes the low-lying areas fertile [50,51].
    The annual average rainfall is 1546 mm, the maximum temperature is 35.8 °C in
    May and the minimum temperature is 12.6 °C [52]. Agriculture contributes 48% of
    the income source, with rice as the primary crop, followed by onion, vegetables,
    fruits, mustard, jute, and sugarcane [53]. Through the adoption of new crop varieties
    and technologies, farmers in Bhanga have aimed for higher productivity, especially
    in Boro and Aman modern rice varieties [54,55]. This intensified cropping system
    has increased multiple cropped areas, agricultural productivity, strengthening
    food security and economic development in the community [56]. Therefore, the findings
    derived from this study can contribute significantly by providing informed land-use
    policies, agricultural strategies, and sustainable development initiatives not
    only for Bhanga but also for similar regions facing comparable challenges. 2.
    Materials and methods 2.1. Satellite data source, data acquisition, and time selection
    Landsat offers extensive, continuous, and high-resolution (30 m) data capturing
    the Earth surface over 40 years [27]. For this study, we utilized satellite imagery
    including Landsat-5 Thematic Mapper (TM) and Landsat-8 (Operational Land Imager
    (OLI) reflectance multispectral temporal images in Google Earth Engine (GEE) through
    USGS Earth Explorer (https://earthexplorer.usgs.gov/). During winter, submerged
    low-lying regions are utilized for agriculture, and thereby Bangladesh experiences
    the highest cropping intensity for diverse crop cultivation [57]. Additionally,
    favorable weather conditions and technological advancements facilitated extensive
    crop production during this period. To mitigate the impact of seasonal variations,
    February was specifically chosen for this study. Additionally, February offers
    the advantages of diverse crop coverage across fields and a relatively cloud-free
    sky, enhancing the suitability of imagery for analysis. Table 1 provides a detailed
    description of the data as well as the acquisition dates. We analyzed the data
    over thirty-five years (from 1988 to 2023) to understand the land use transition.

    for this study. The collected Landsat images were divided into five LULC classes,
    such as i) Agriculture, ii) Vegetation, iii) Built-up, iv) Waterbodies, and v)
    Barren lands. Detailed descriptions of each class are shown in Fig. 3. Download

    of LULC classification 2.3.1. Google Earth Engine (GEE) platform The research
    took advantage of the GEE platform''s amazing capabilities for satellite imagery
    collecting and processing to facilitate a comprehensive understanding of geospatial
    analyses. Landsat 5 TM and the Landsat 8 OLI reflectance images were collected
    from the GEE platform for 1988, 1999, 2011, and 2023. In the beginning, the filter
    date and study area (region of interest) were set with cloud cover <3% to remove
    cloud interference (shadow) on the images. The imageries were collected from February
    2023 with the path 137 and row 044. The band combinations (B1, B2, B3, B4, B5
    and B7) were selected for Landsat-5 imagery and the band combinations (B2, B3,
    B4, B5, B6 and B7) were selected for Landsat 8 imagery collection. Then the collected
    imageries were stacked using a mosaic of collected imagery and clipping of roi
    (region of interest). High-resolution satellite imagery were used for generating
    500 training data in the form of points collection for the five different classes.
    We acquired training samples (random 75%) and validation samples (random 25%).
    The training points were collected from the whole area for each study period.
    Then the points were overlayed to obtain training samples. For overall accuracy
    assessment, confusion matrix, kappa coefficient, consumer accuracy, and producer
    accuracy were used for 1988, 1999, 2011, and 2023. 2.3.2. Random Forest (RF) machine
    learning The RF machine learning algorithm is one of the most common techniques
    to enhance the precision and accuracy of satellite image classification for land
    cover analysis [58]. This method utilizes bagging, producing multiple predictors
    that collaboratively reach a final decision by aggregating votes of predictors.
    A random selection of training datasets and variables was used for generating
    multiple decision trees by RF. To establish a proper split for building a tree,
    RF selects variables at random from training samples at each node [59]. A simplified
    structure of an RF tree is shown in Fig. 4. Download : Download high-res image
    (287KB) Download : Download full-size image Fig. 4. Structure of an RF Tree adopted
    from [63]. We used the “smileRandomForest” as RF classifier machine learning algorithm
    for supervised image classification. Supervised classification utilizes the spectral
    signatures that are labelled training data which were obtained from training samples
    for classifying an image. The supervised learning model produces more accurate
    results than the unsupervised classification [60]. Here we used “ee.Classifier.smileRandomForest(numberOfTrees,
    variablesPerSplit” algorithm for classifier model building. We performed supervised
    classification and data validation using 70% of training data and 30% of testing
    data, respectively. We used different coloured palettes such as yellow for agriculture,
    green for vegetation, red for built-up, blue for waterbodies, and grey for barren
    lands. Subsequently, LULC classified maps were prepared for the years 1988, 1999,
    2011, and 2023 from GEE with distinct five classes. 2.4. Accuracy assessment of
    LULC maps Accuracy assessment involves verifying classified images to determine
    the quality, precision, and suitability of the produced maps [48]. Most common
    metrics like training error matrix, overall accuracy, Kappa coefficient, producers
    accuracy, consumers accuracy, validation accuracy, and validation error, are employed
    to assess the accuracy of the classified images [27]. For example, the Kappa coefficient
    determines the classification quality by comparing it against a randomly generated
    image. Kappa coefficient value ranges from 0 to 1, where 0.61–0.80 refer to significantly
    accurate, while values from 0.81 to 1 indicate nearly perfect [21]. Meanwhile,
    the error matrix provides insight into whether the sample classification for each
    LULC class is performed correctly or incorrectly. 2.5. LULC map generation using
    ArcGIS We utilized ArcGIS 10.8 software for image processing to produce geo-referenced
    maps for this study. At first, we imported the LULC classified tiff images into
    the ArcGIS catalogue. Then we changed the symbology from stretched to unique values
    to get five distinct classes such as agriculture, vegetation, built-up, waterbodies,
    and barren lands, and to obtain LULC maps for 1988, 1999, 2011, and 2023. Then
    we convert the raster image into a vector (polygon) using the conversion tool
    ‘Raster to Polygon’ tool. We projected the dissolved feature in the coordinate
    system (WGS 1984 UTM Zone 45 N) to produce the LULC maps. Finally, we calculated
    the area of five classes in the attribute table. Finally, we changed the colour
    ramp in the tiff images to produce NDVI and NDWI maps with the desired colours
    for the same period. 2.6. NDVI and NDWI analysis The NDVI which is a globally
    recognized tool, has been extensively utilized in previous studies to monitor
    seasonal and inter-annual fluctuations of crop growth [27,61]. On the other hand,
    the NDWI is a remote sensing-based indicator that can determine vegetation water
    content. It is particularly useful to identify open water sources [27]. NDWI also
    provides valuable indices for monitoring drought, water stress, and land degradation
    [62]. Both NDVI and NDWI are dimensionless, with values ranging between −1 and
    + 1 [48]. Higher NDVI values denote robust vegetation coverage, while negative
    values indicate the presence of water. Elevated NDWI refers to high water content
    in the soil, whereas lower values suggest reduced moisture content in the soil.
    NDVI and NDWI are calculated from the following equations (1), (2) [63]: (1) (2)
    In the case of NDVI, NIR is the reflection in the near-infrared, and RED is the
    red region of the electromagnetic spectrum (EMS). On the other hand, for NDWI,
    NIR and GREEN are the reflections in the near-infrared and GREEN range of EMS.
    NDVI predominantly maps vegetation, whereas NDWI maps the water content of vegetation
    [27]. Specific bands from the images were utilized to derive NDVI and NDWI as
    described in Table 2. Table 2. Specific bands used in NDVI and NDWI equations.

    3.1. LULC change detection The LULC maps were produced from the Landsat satellite
    imagery using the RF algorithm for the years 1988 (Fig. 5a), 1999 (Figs. 5b),
    2011 (Fig. 5c), and 2023 (Fig. 5d). The results revealed significant changes in
    LULC transformation as recorded in Table S1 (Supplementary materials) and presented

    full-size image Fig. 6. LULC classes change over time (in 1988, 1999, 2011, and
    2023) a) change in hectares; b) transformation in percentage. During the study
    period, the agriculture area substantially changed from 1012 ha to 6594 ha, indicating
    an incredible increase of 551.8% over 35 years. This huge growth of agricultural
    area shifts from 5.0% in 1988 to 32.5% of the total land in 2023. In addition,
    the built-up area also increased by 155.6%. However, the rate of change was not
    always linear for all types of lands. In 1988, the agricultural area was 1012
    ha which constituted 5.0% of the total land. From 1988 to 1999, the agriculture
    area decreased to 492 ha which was reasonable due to the devastating flood in
    1998 [66]. However, from 1999 to 2011, there was a drastic increase from 492 ha
    to 6197 ha and a 6.4% increase in the following interval 2011–2023 to make it
    five times than the initial agriculture area that constituted 32.5% of the total
    land. This remarkable increase in the agriculture area was expected due to the
    numerous policy measures, technological supports, and economic incentives to expand
    crop intensification in the region [67]. On the other hand, the built-up area
    increased by 57.6%, 26.7%, and 28.0% for the period of 1988–1999, 1999–2011, 2011–2023
    respectively. This steady increase in the built-up area is attributed to recent
    infrastructure development in that region, notably the impact of the new mega
    infrastructures such as the six-lane Dhaka-Bhanga Expressway and Padma Multipurpose
    Bridge [68,69]. Meanwhile, vegetation, waterbodies, and barren lands decrease
    significantly to transform into agricultural lands. For instance, during the study
    period, waterbodies went through substantial changes that showed a reduction from
    2441 ha in 1988 to 675 ha in 2023, reporting a 72.4% decline. In addition, barren
    lands were recorded at 7753 ha (in 1988) which reduced to 2864 ha in 2023, reflecting
    a 63.1% decrease over 35 years. Similarly, vegetation area slightly decreased
    from 1988 to 2023 and was recorded as 8334 ha, and 8209 ha, indicating a reduction
    of 1.5%. A similar decrease pattern was reported in a previous study for the period
    of 1990–2017 [12]. This change in waterbodies can be ascribed to landfilling of
    waterbodies, sand deposition in the rivers, low annual rainfall, rapid population
    growth, and other anthropogenic factors [70,71]. Hence, even though notable agricultural
    land was converted into the built-up area in many places, a substantial surge
    in agriculture was achieved due to the gain from large fallow and waterbodies
    [20]. 3.2. Accuracy assessment of LULC maps Several metrics, such as training
    error matrix, Kappa coefficient, overall accuracy, producer accuracy, consumer
    accuracy, validation accuracy, and validation error were used to assess the accuracy
    level of the classified images in 1988, 1999, 2011, and 2023. 30% of validation
    reference points were randomly selected from the total samples for the assessment.
    The accuracy of the classified LULC maps was evaluated using Kappa statistics
    and overall accuracy, as described in Table 3. Notably, the overall classification
    accuracy was verified at 99% for each of the years: 1988, 1999, 2011, and 2023.
    The overall accuracy above 85% indicates excellent precision in the LULC classification
    [72]. Table 3. Overall accuracy and Kappa coefficient for year-wise training samples.
    Year Overall accuracy Kappa Coefficient 1987 99% 0.99 1999 99% 0.99 2011 99% 0.99
    2023 99% 0.99 3.3. Trend analysis of LULC categories Linear regression analysis
    is an effective tool to understand the correlation between dependent and independent
    variables [44]. Fig. 7 indicates that independent variables such as waterbodies,
    barren lands, and built-up areas collectively account for around two-thirds of
    the variation in the dependent variable, agriculture. Download : Download high-res

    barren lands and agriculture; b) Correlation between waterbodies and agriculture;
    c) Correlation between built-up and agriculture Additionally, low R2 values indicate
    the nonlinear LULC change during the study period. To evaluate the relationships
    with agriculture versus barren lands, waterbodies, and built-up, correlation coefficient,
    R2 values were derived from the linear equations, resulting 0.82, 0.64, and 0.74
    respectively. In general, regression analysis confirms that the decrease in barren
    lands and waterbodies facilitates agriculture to flourish. 3.4. Spatial distribution
    of NDVI Two indices, NDVI and NDWI, were used to enhance LULC identification and
    improve the accuracy of the classification. These indices effectively distinguished
    the selected five land cover features. NDVI is widely used for monitoring vegetation
    health [41]. Fig. 8 showcased the spatial distribution of NDVI values for four
    specified years, ranging from −0.36 to 0.73. Particularly, forest, shrubs, and
    agriculture areas were visible in the NDVI map, characterized by dark and light
    green hues, with values hovering around 0.4 or higher. In contrast, permanent
    waterbodies and temporary waterbodies appeared as light red to dark red with values
    below zero, while built-up areas appeared whitish to light red, indicating values
    slightly above zero. Download : Download high-res image (1MB) Download : Download

    study area, indicating the LULC in 1988, while random higher values denote winter
    crops. Fig. 8b revealed increased areas with sparse vegetation of light green
    colour, alongside pockets of dark green indicating crops, possibly affected by
    the devastating flood in 1998. Fig. 8c and d illustrate expanded agriculture zones,
    with minor barren lands in the central and western sectors of the study area.
    The NDVI analysis highlighted a significant increase in agriculture and built-up
    areas over time. Similar findings were reported from another study utilizing the
    NDVI index [73]. Table 4 outlines the highest and lowest NDVI values recorded
    annually. Table 4. Year-wise highest value and lowest value of NDVI and NDWI.

    distribution of NDWI NDWI serves as a significant indicator to represent crop
    water stress and helps to specify wetland change [41]. The study area was also
    assessed with the NDWI and found similar to those from NDVI. Fig. 9 illustrates
    the spatial distribution of NDWI values across four specified years, ranging from
    −0.61 to 0.51. These values indicated the presence of agricultural areas, vegetation
    coverage, barren lands, and areas with shallow or deep water. Download : Download

    of NDWI for 1988 (9a), 1999 (9b), 2011 (9c) and 2023 (9d). Agriculture areas and
    vegetation appeared in white to light blue hues, indicating values from −0.61
    to just below zero. Meanwhile, waterbodies were shown in dark blue, with values
    above zero, and built-up areas occurred in white to blue, with values slightly
    above zero. The spatial variability of NDWI values exhibited distinct fluctuations
    across different years. In 1988, NDWI values were lower across most areas, except
    in the center and southeastern parts of the study area. By 1999, widespread areas
    were identified with sparse vegetation, reflected in lower values represented
    by light blue shades. In 2011 and 2023, NDWI values were consistently aligned
    with the LULC maps, showcasing transformations from barren lands and vegetation
    to agriculture. 4. Discussion GEE is the most powerful freely accessible tool
    to acquire, process, and analyze geospatial data for the study area. To categorize
    LULC maps accurately, various machine learning algorithms such as Random Forest
    (RF), Support Vector Machine (SVM), and Classification and Regression Trees (CART)
    are used. In this study, RF efficiently classified different land use land cover
    types with >99% accuracy. RF showed a similar highest accuracy in previous investigations
    [74,75]. In addition, previous studies reported that the SVM and CART erroneously
    categorized forests, waterbodies, and barren lands as vegetation and built-up
    areas [58,59]. To validate RF outputs, NDVI and NDWI were also utilized in this
    study to accurately classify the land types [76]. NDVI and NDWI involved the creation
    of training points and polygons for each class. Each pixel within the polygon
    serves as a training sample, with a known assigned value. This allows for a comparison
    with classified pixels, enabling the assessment of errors and precision [77].
    Although the accuracy level was high, the agriculture land surge was compared
    with the historical field data to rationale the findings especially the increase
    of agricultural lands. Historical ground data support this significant land transformation.
    For instance, irrigated Boro rice cultivation has been increasing enormously since
    the independence of Bangladesh in 1971 [53,56]. In the last few decades, huge
    areas were brought under agriculture due to the wide access to shallow and deep
    tube wells for proper irrigation [78] which boosted crop production in 2020–2021
    compared to 2010–2011 as shown in Fig. 10. In addition, the introduction of new
    and sustainable stress-tolerant crop varieties (rice, mustard, wheat onion, etc.),
    crop diversification, modern machinery availability, and government subsidies
    and support for fertilizers and seeds availability have a substantial impact on
    crop intensification [56,79]. Despite the lack of historical data for the whole
    study period, Bangladesh experienced 3% growth in cropped land and 23.4% increase
    in selected crop production from 2010-2011 to 2020–2021 (Table S2 and Table S3),
    while Bhanga showed 6.4% increase in agriculture land from 2011-2023 (Table S1).

    Fig. 10. a) Actual cropped area change (national) and b) Actual production increase
    statistics (national) for 2010-11 Vs 2020–21 [56,80]. Another significant change
    has been recorded in the built-up areas, which increased by around 155.6% from
    1988 to 2023. Almost at the same time, from 1991 to 2022, population growth in
    Bhanga was recorded by 36.4% as the population census reports [[81], [82], [83]].
    Therefore, crop intensification was obvious to ensure the food security of the
    growing population, and the expansion of built-up areas indicated the livelihood
    pattern change among the inhabitants in the study area. Although built-up areas
    improve local livelihoods, ongoing land monitoring is essential for sustainable
    land usage and to mitigate any potential adverse impact of rapid urbanization.
    Hence, it is imperative to implement appropriate policies that ensure effective
    land use, thereby ensuring food security and fostering the economic development
    of the community. 5. Conclusion The study employed GIS and spatiotemporal Landsat
    satellite imagery, along with NDVI and NDWI indices to analyze the land use and
    land cover dynamics in the Bhanga subdistrict, Bangladesh, spanning from 1988
    to 2023. The quantitative assessment revealed an upward trajectory in agricultural
    lands and built-up areas, contrasted with a declining trend in vegetation, waterbodies,
    and barren lands. This transformation indicates the direct impact of agricultural
    intensification in the study. The large expansion of agricultural lands owes credit
    to government support, and the introduction of high-yielding and climate-resilient
    new crop varieties and technologies disseminated by the Department of Agricultural
    Extension (DAE). This crop intensification significantly boosted crop production,
    ensuring greater food self-sufficiency. In contrast, more than half of the waterbodies
    were disappeared, which could be alarming for biodiversity and the ecosystem.
    It could also be noted that remaining barren land utilization might be a way forward
    to reduce future load on waterbodies and vegetation area coverages. This research
    highlights the crucial role of ongoing GIS and remote sensing-based monitoring
    to understand the land use change over the time to facilitate informed policymaking
    decisions for sustainable agricultural planning. Most past studies were focused
    on climate-vulnerable regions, where agricultural land predominantly experienced
    a significant decline. That trend, however, does not represent the entire landscape
    of the country. Hence, the current study reports an opposite but positive trend,
    emphasizing the need for continuous monitoring of land use change to tailor region-specific
    initiatives instead of adopting generalized strategies to ensure food security
    and sustainability. By offering valuable insights, this study proposes actionable
    recommendations for policymakers. This finding can pave the way for sustainable
    agricultural development in Bangladesh. It is also imperative to adopt proper
    policies that account for region-specific variations in land use to ensure resilience
    and sustainable growth in the face of evolving environmental consequences. Although
    there are many other methods to determine the LULC change, our methods have been
    demonstrated to produce comparable results with minimum efforts that can be adopted
    for a similar scope around the world. Nevertheless, we acknowledge the importance
    of utilizing other methods with onsite validation. To prepare a more realistic
    decision-making inputs, continuous LULC change monitoring using geospatial technologies
    needs to continue with bigger samples including severely climate-vulnerable and
    less vulnerable regions. Funding The authors did not receive support/funding from

  description: Droughts cause significant economic losses in many regions around the
    world, highlighting a need to more accurately quantify implications of drought
    on production and water management. Remote sensing technologies and machine learning-based
    models offer promising solutions for timely and accurate regional drought monitoring,
    but the accuracy of such approaches is constrained by both the conceptual design
    and algorithms underpinning such approaches. We developed a machine learning stacking
    ensemble approach to overcome such limitations, drawing upon Precipitation Estimation
    from Remotely Sensed Information using Artificial Neural Network-Climate Data
    Record (PERSIANN-CDR), Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) remote
    sensing products, and climate zoning data to estimate 3-month scale SPEI (Standardized
    Precipitation Evapotranspiration Index, SPEI-3) in 9 sub-regions of China. We
    compared 19 individual machine learning models and used the stacking approach
    to select the most robust meta-model for SPEI-3 prediction. We found that CatBoost
    Regressor (CBR), Extra Trees Regressor (ETR), Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGB),
    Light Gradient Boosting Machine (LGBM), and Random Forest (RF) were the top individual
    models for predicting drought, while using CBR as the stacked meta-model achieved
    the best performance. The R2 values for the stacking model with CBR as the meta-model
    were 0.9065 and 0.8218 in the eastern and western regions, respectively. We then
    employed the stacking model with CBR as the meta-model to generate seasonal drought
    maps based on SPEI-3 across different years and seasons. Our predicted SPEI-3
    was compared with drought maps generated by the GPCC and ERA5 reanalysis datasets.
    We found a strong correlation between them with R2 exceeding 0.8 across multiple
    years and seasons, indicating our machine learning stacking ensemble approach
    had a good performance in monitoring seasonal drought conditions. The findings
    of our study establish a standardized protocol for predicting droughts in the
    agricultural sector, enabling its widespread application irrespective of variations
    in terrain and climate.

    Drought impacts a significant proportion of the global population each year (Batista
    et al., 2015, Lobell and Gourdji, 2012, Wang et al., 2023). Drought may cause
    substantial losses in production due to either reduced cropping areas and/or reduced
    yields (Corey et al., 2016). Chronic and isolated droughts together cause annual
    global economic losses of $US6-8B, making the phenomenon the most costly meteorological
    disaster facing humanity (Wilhite, 2000). The frequency and intensity of drought
    disasters are increasing, as evident from occurrence of mega-drought events and
    anomalous performance characteristics (Zhang et al., 2020). Hence, the development
    of accurate and timely drought monitoring models is crucial for ensuring and promoting
    agricultural production, as well as facilitating disaster prevention and reduction
    efforts. Climatic indices are crucial metrics in the objective measurement and
    contrasting of the severity and length of droughts, as they simplify intricate
    connections between numerous climate variables measuring and contrasting the severity
    and length of droughts (Alam et al., 2017). However, due to interacting factors
    and manifestations of drought, a single drought index cannot fully reflect its
    entire picture. Indeed, perceived ‘drought’ in agronomic contexts may depend on
    occurrence of extreme temperatures, rainfall or soil water deficit, extreme vapour
    pressure deficit, or combination thereof (Ibrahim et al., 2019). To address this
    limitation, there have been proposals for over 100 drought indices to characterize
    drought (Amir et al., 2011). Among these indices, the Standardized Precipitation
    Index (SPI) is a commonly used metric for measuring precipitation anomalies over
    various time frames (Mckee et al., 1993), which indicate how abnormal current
    precipitation patterns are compared to historical records at a specific location.
    Nevertheless, the SPI only focuses on the precipitation aspect of drought and
    disregards the impacts of temperature on water consumption and evapotranspiration.
    To overcome this limitation, the Standardized Precipitation Evapotranspiration
    Index (SPEI) was developed to integrate both precipitation and evaporation data
    (Vicente-Serrano et al., 2010). SPI is only suitable for assessing short-term
    drought, while SPEI can assess drought conditions at different time scales, which
    is important for the evaluation of seasonal drought (Pei et al., 2020). SPEI has
    been widely used to analyze the impact of drought on crops in various regions,
    including China (Ming et al., 2015), the United States (Moorhead et al., 2015),
    Australia (Feng et al., 2019), and Europe (Gunst et al., 2015), and has demonstrated
    effective results in evaluating the impact of meteorological drought on agricultural
    production (Yan et al., 2022). Historically, drought monitoring has focused on
    station-based data because station meteorological data can provide more precise
    and reliable meteorological parameters, to accurately calculate drought indices
    (West et al., 2019). However, this approach is limited due to the sparse distribution
    of meteorological observations and the heterogeneity of underlying surfaces, and
    difficulty accessing data in many nations (Liu et al., 2023), leading to inaccurate
    regional assessments of water conditions (Cai et al., 2010). To overcome these
    challenges, some scholars employ spatial interpolation techniques via geostatistics
    to acquire information on regional drought conditions by utilizing meteorological
    data collected from various weather stations (Afzali et al., 2016, Akhtari et
    al., 2009, Eivazi and Mosaedi, 2011). However, due to the insufficient availability
    of meteorological observations and a lack of consideration for local climatic
    and topographical differences, this method is considered unreliable, impeding
    accurate assessment of drought conditions (Easterling, 2013). Remote sensing enables
    seamless monitoring of the Earth''s drought status by providing high-resolution
    and continuous spatiotemporal observations (Yao et al., 2023). Some studies have
    used remote sensing data or reanalysis data with similar characteristics to remote
    sensing data for regional drought analysis (Chen et al., 2019b, Ma et al., 2023,
    Zhou et al., 2020). However, the accuracy of both remotely sensed and reanalysis
    data is subject to factors such as observational data and numerical model biases,
    which may result in certain errors and uncertainties. Moreover, reliable validation
    of remotely sensed and reanalysis data still presents challenges, which could
    potentially impact the correctness and application value of research conclusions.
    Currently, machine learning is rapidly advancing and has broad applications (Prodhan
    et al., 2022). In the context of drought monitoring, machine learning can leverage
    various techniques such as data fusion, feature selection, pre-processing, data
    harvesting, and classification to improve the accuracy and reliability of drought
    indices, providing scientific basis and support for drought prevention and control
    efforts. These techniques help extract valuable insights from multiple data sources,
    generate precise drought indicators, and play critical roles in predicting and
    managing droughts (Felsche and Ludwig, 2021). Currently, there are already numerous
    data fusion-based methods for drought monitoring and prediction (Alizadeh and
    Nikoo, 2018, Arabzadeh et al., 2015, Jia et al., 2022, Shahbazi et al., 2012,
    Yang et al., 2021). Many studies have also employed machine learning methods to
    characterize and predict drought, in order to investigate the impacts of drought
    on agricultural production (Cai et al., 2023, Feng et al., 2019, Hazaymeh and
    Hassan, 2017, Marj and Meijerink, 2011, Woli et al., 2013). However, machine learning
    algorithms are still limited in terms of generalizability and stability. Recently,
    ensemble machine learning methods have been developed to exploit the benefits
    of multiple models (Tao et al., 2023). For example, stacking-based ensemble learning
    models combine the strengths of multiple models to enhance accuracy and stability
    (He et al., 2021). Wang (2022) combined multiple individual machine learning models
    with ensemble learning algorithms and applied the stacking ensemble learning architecture
    to soil moisture inversion, which significantly improved the model accuracy. These
    ensemble models outperform traditional mathematical models and methods in monitoring
    and predicting drought disasters (Prodhan et al., 2022) because they better account
    for variability across sites, climates and production systems (Sándor et al.,
    2020). Nevertheless, there have been few studies applying the stacking ensemble
    learning method to monitor seasonal drought, much less studies combining machine
    learning methods with remote sensing and climatic zonation approaches. Drought
    disasters are common in China, with severe droughts occurring on average every
    2.7 years and extreme droughts occurring on average every 5.5 years (Abrar Faiz
    et al., 2022, Ni et al., 2022). Frequent droughts in China have significantly
    impacted agriculture, causing substantial crop yield losses. Therefore, better
    monitoring of droughts to allow timely warnings will be imperative to enhance
    the China''s capacity and effectiveness in responding to seasonal droughts. The
    purpose of this study is to use an ensemble machine learning method to integrate
    remote sensing drought factors for monitoring seasonal droughts. Specifically,
    our aims were to: 1) quantify the accuracy of 19 machine learning models in drought
    inversion; 2) assess the performance of 18 models as meta-models integrating 5
    optimal individual models to build a stacking model; 3) evaluate the results in
    cropping region with SPEI-3 estimated from GPCC and ERA5 reanalysis datasets.
    2. Materials and methods 2.1. Study area China possesses a rich and diverse set
    of natural geographical elements with significant regional climate variations,
    as evidenced by climate models depicting notable regional heterogeneity. (Chen
    et al., 2019a). According to the “Nine Agricultural Regions of China” provided
    by Resource and Environmental Science and Data Center, China is divided into nine
    agricultural regions based on factors such as climate, land use, and crop types
    (Fig. 1a). The agricultural zoning data, climate zoning vector data, and cropland
    raster data based on China''s land use map used in this study were obtained from
    the Resource and Environment Science and Data Center (RESDC) of the Chinese Academy
    of Sciences (https://www.resdc.cn). Furthermore, the final model inversion of
    drought conditions will be presented in China''s cropping region (Fig. 1c) to
    provide drought indicators for agricultural production. The specific data for
    each subregion can be found in Table S1 of the Supplementary Materials document.

    utilized for result comparison. The study period is from 2001 to 2017, with a
    data scale of 3 months and a time resolution of 1 month. Therefore, all data were
    merged at a 3-month scale, and the remote sensing data from the last two months
    of 2000 were also included. Table S2 of the Supplementary Materials document displays
    the time span and source of the data. 2.2.1. Ground-based climate data The climate
    station observation data used in this study were obtained from the China Meteorological
    Data Service Center (https://data.cma.cn/). Daily data for 762 stations including
    precipitation, maximum and minimum temperatures, and radiation from 1961 to 2017
    were used to derive SPEI at the station level. Fig. 1b shows the distribution
    of climate stations across mainland China. 2.2.2. Remote sensing data The remote
    sensing data used drought prediction in this study were obtained from Google Earth
    Engine (GEE, https://earthengine.google.com). The Evapotranspiration (ET) and
    Potential Evapotranspiration (PET) data were derived from the MODIS MOD16A2.006:
    Terra Net Evapotranspiration 8-Day Global 500 m dataset. The ET and PET data in
    this dataset were calculated using the Penman-Monteith equation, incorporating
    MODIS remote sensing data products and meteorological reanalysis data, including
    radiation, temperature, humidity, wind speed, as well as vegetation characteristics
    and land cover data products. The Land Surface Temperature (LST) data were obtained
    from the MODIS MOD11A1.061 Terra Land Surface Temperature and Emissivity Daily
    Global 1 km dataset. Precipitation, evaporation, and temperature are directly
    linked to the water balance within a region. By incorporating these factors, the
    model can capture the essential elements that contribute to drought conditions.
    If certain variables are less important for predicting SPEI, they will rank lower
    in the final importance ranking. The surface reflectance data were acquired from
    MODIS MOD09A1.006 Terra Surface Reflectance 8-Day Global 500 m dataset. NDVI (Normalized
    Difference Vegetation Index), NMDI (Normalized Multi-band Drought Index), NDWI
    (Normalized Difference Water Index), and NDDI (Normalized Difference Drought Index)
    indices were calculated based on the surface reflectance of seven bands (B1-B7)
    of the dataset (Table 1). Vegetation indices like NDVI are sensitive to changes
    in vegetation health and density. They can capture variations in vegetation growth
    and vigor, which are influenced by water availability. NDWI measures the difference
    between near-infrared and shortwave infrared bands, providing information on the
    presence of water bodies, moisture content in vegetation, and soil moisture. NMDI
    focuses on the normalized difference between near-infrared and mid-infrared bands,
    indicating the level of drought stress in vegetation. By including these indices
    as variables, we can better understand the impact of vegetation on drought conditions.
    The remote sensing datasets we used have undergone certain preprocessing (e.g.
    cloud removal), and only require a resampling operation to standardize the resolution
    to 1 km. The resampling method used is the built-in bilinear interpolation provided
    by Google Earth Engine. Table 1. Remote sensing indices for estimating seasonal
    drought and evaluating the results. Indices Definition Formula Resolution Source

    data were obtained from the NOAA PERSIANN-CDR dataset, with a spatial resolution
    of 0.25 degrees and a temporal resolution of 1 day. Furthermore, given that SPEI
    considers the effects of both precipitation and potential evapotranspiration,
    we introduced a simple water balance index called ‘balance’ (Pre - PET), which
    represents water balance status in a certain period. To avoid multicollinearity
    and the curse of dimensionality, we calculated the variance inflation factor (VIF)
    for each variable and further eliminated variables with high VIF values and relatively
    low importance (Robert, 2007). This process improves the performance and interpretability
    of machine learning. Fig. 2a shows the Pearson correlation coefficient between
    SPEI and retained predict variables. It shows that selecting balance as a feature
    variable is reasonable, as it exhibits the highest correlation with SPEI among
    all the examined features, with a Pearson correlation coefficient of 0.388. Fig.
    2b shows the Pearson correlation coefficient between the SPEI and each drought
    factor across 9 sub-regions, revealing that the dominant factors influencing the
    SPEI of each sub-region vary. Download : Download high-res image (2MB) Download

    9 sub-regions (b). The definition of remote sensing drought factors can be found
    in Table 1. The values in each cell represent the correlation coefficient between
    the corresponding pair of variables. 2.2.3. Reanalysis data We selected the GPCC
    reanalysis, which is generated based on global precipitation observational data
    and reanalysis methods, and the ERA5 dataset, which is generated through the fusion
    of numerical models and observational data, as our verification data. By using
    these two different data processing methods, we can conduct a more comprehensive
    validation and comparison of our research results, thereby increasing the reliability
    of the data. These datasets have been proven to have high accuracy and are widely
    used for verification and comparison in drought assessment (Chen et al., 2019b,
    Ma et al., 2023, Wei et al., 2023). The GPCC precipitation dataset is based on
    approximately 85,000 observation points worldwide and utilizes the SphereMap interpolation
    method to derive a global gridded land precipitation dataset (Becker et al., 2013).
    The latest GPCC version 2022 product is accessible via https://opendata.dwd.de/climate_environment/GPCC/html/download_gate.html.
    ERA5 is the fifth generation of reanalysis products developed by ECMWF, which
    is used to reanalyze global atmospheric changes using models and data. It couples
    data from diverse sources, including satellites, meteorological observation stations,
    and aircraft, with advanced physical models to calculate high-precision spatiotemporal
    distribution information on various meteorological variables globally (Hersbach
    et al., 2020). The dataset covers data from 1979 to the present and can be accessed
    via https://cds.climate.copernicus.eu/. 2.2.4. Climate zoning data Due to the
    substantial differences in geography and climate across different regions of China,
    we divided the whole country into 46 climatic regions to establish a geographically
    targeted model that improves the accuracy of predictions (Yin, 2017). The data
    on climatic zoning, as a qualitative variable, is transformed into a binary variable
    recognizable by machine learning algorithms through dummy variable processing,
    which participates in machine learning analysis. Please refer to Fig. S1 of the
    Supplementary Materials document for the map of climatic regions and corresponding
    names of the regions. 2.3. Methods The flowchart shown in Fig. 3 illustrates the
    overall process of the stacking-model-based methodology used for estimating seasonal
    drought. The process begins with the collection of predictor variables from remote
    sensing data sources such as MODIS and PERSIANN-CDR, which include variables like
    ET, PET, LST, and Reflectance, and precipitation data, along with climate zoning
    data that has been transformed using dummy variable encoding. These predictors
    feed into the machine learning models for drought estimation. In this study, an
    advanced model ensemble approach based on stacking was utilized to combine the
    top 5 individual machine learning models for each agricultural region, using these
    predictors to estimate SPEI at a 3-month scale for analyzing and estimating seasonal
    drought. The response variable is the SPEI calculated from data gathered at 762
    climate stations, which serves as the ground truth for model validation. First,
    we selected the top 5 machine learning models in estimating drought from 19 algorithms
    using the aforementioned predictors for each subregion. Second, we evaluated the
    performance of 18 meta-models (excluding KNR) in stacking ensembles and subsequently
    selected the best-performing one to integrate with the top 5 individual models.
    Stacking typically involves combining and adjusting base model predictions using
    a meta-model, but as KNR only relies on neighboring data points without modeling
    complex relationships, we excluded it from our meta-model comparison. The subsequent
    sections will provide a detailed description of the principal components of the
    proposed procedures. Download : Download high-res image (707KB) Download : Download
    full-size image Fig. 3. Flowchart of the proposed model stacking methodology based
    on multiple data sources for estimating drought. 2.3.1. Standardised precipitation
    evapotranspiration index (SPEI) SPEI utilizes periodic differences between precipitation
    and PET (Vicente-Serrano et al., 2010). Therefore, we first used the Penman-Monteith
    method to calculate the monthly potential evapotranspiration because it incorporates
    the effects of temperature, radiation and other crucial factors (Trenberth et
    al., 2014). Then, we calculate the difference between monthly precipitation and
    potential evapotranspiration, fit this data using a three-parameter log-logistic
    distribution, obtain its cumulative function, standardize the sequence through
    normal processing, and ultimately acquire the SPEI (Vicente-Serrano et al., 2010).
    The drought levels corresponding to different SPEI values are categorized into
    severe, moderate, and mild drought for SPEI values of −2 or below, between −1.5
    and −2, and between −1.5 and −1, respectively, while SPEI values between −1 and
    1 indicate normal conditions that are not affected by drought or moisture. 2.3.2.
    Machine learning models The capability of individual machine learning models has
    a significant impact on the effectiveness of model ensemble. Therefore, we compared
    19 commonly used machine learning models (Table 2). Since the parameter settings
    have minimal impact on the results, we used default parameters for all machine
    learning algorithms in all regions. We have provided a detailed introduction of
    the algorithms primarily used in this study in the Supplementary Materials. Table

    – XGB Extreme Gradient Boosting Chen and Guestrin (2016) Catboost is a machine
    learning model based on gradient boosting decision trees (Dorogush et al., 2018).
    It shows exceptional performance when compared to other individual models, whether
    as an individual model or as a meta-model in the ensemble. Catboost effectively
    handles categorical features and minimizes information loss (Prokhorenkova et
    al., 2018). It uses a random permutation method to select tree structures for
    estimating leaf values, thus avoiding overfitting issues commonly encountered
    in gradient boosting algorithms (Ullah et al., 2022). The ability of Catboost
    to handle categorical features makes it particularly suitable for many real-world
    applications, such as the use of Catboost for soil water content based on multi-sensor
    data by Nguyen et al. (2022). The 4 individual models, ETR, XGB, LGBM, and RF,
    are also used as base models in model ensemble due to their excellent performance.
    All of them are based on the ensemble method of decision trees. ETR is an ensemble
    learning method that utilizes randomization to produce a set of decision trees
    and then averages their outputs. Compared to other ensemble methods, Extra Trees
    is simpler, more easily scalable, and can handle large amounts of data (Geurts
    et al., 2006). XGB is an efficient gradient boosting decision tree (GBDT) algorithm
    that employs multiple optimization techniques to accelerate the training process,
    including approximate greedy algorithms, distributed computing, and caching techniques,
    demonstrating outstanding accuracy and speed (Chen and Guestrin, 2016). LGBM is
    also a GBDT algorithm that utilizes histogram-based decision tree algorithms to
    discretize continuous value features, thereby significantly reducing memory consumption
    and calculation time (Ke et al., 2017). RF is a popular ensemble learning technique
    that employs multiple decision trees to produce prediction outcomes and aggregates
    them by either voting or averaging. Compared to single decision trees, Random
    Forest can reduce overfitting problems and is more robust in dealing with high-dimensional
    and missing data (Breiman, 2001). 2.3.3. Model stacking Stacking is a commonly
    used method to produce an ensemble model where multiple base models'' outputs
    are combined as features to train a meta-model for making final predictions on
    the target variable (Wolpert, 1992). In stacking, different base models and meta
    models can be selected to achieve better performance and generalization ability.
    The stacking model is actually the trained meta model, which we refer to as the
    meta model during the stacking process. Fig. 4 illustrates the principle of the
    stacking model that combines five models using a 5-fold cross-validation approach,
    which was employed in this study. The 5-fold cross-validation in the stacking
    model refers to the cross-validation of the training data set for each model run,
    which is the ''Training Sample Data'' shown in Fig. 4. Download : Download high-res
    image (995KB) Download : Download full-size image Fig. 4. Schematic representation
    of the proposed 5-fold cross-validation based stacking model approach. In the
    first layer, there are 5 basic models, using base modeli as an example. During
    each model run, we had 90% of training data and 10% of testing data, denoted as
    ''Train'' and ''Test'' in the first layer, respectively. The details of how the
    data was split will be further explained in the ''Model performance assessment''
    section. The ''Train'' data is randomly split into five parts for cross-validation.
    In the jth cross-validation iteration, we used four ''train'' data to build a
    model, predict the ''validation data to obtain a prediction value ai,j, and then
    use the trained model to predict the ''Test'' data to obtain a prediction value
    bi,j. After 5-fold cross-validation, we got {ai,1, ai,2, ai,3, ai,4, ai,5} and
    {bi,1, bi,2, bi,3, bi,4, bi,5}, stack the former vertically to form Ai with the
    same length as the training sample data, and take the average of the latter to
    obtain Bi with the same length as the testing sample data. In the second layer,
    we used {A1, A2, …, A5}, which are the outputs of 5 models in the first layer,
    as new training features. The label of ‘Train’ is used as training label to train
    a meta-model. Finally, the trained stacking model (meta-model) is used to predict
    label for {B1, B2, …, B5}, which are the testing features. The predicted label
    is compared to the label of ‘Test’ to evaluate the stacking model''s performance.
    2.3.4. Model performance assessment We constructed machine learning models using
    satellite-based remote sensing drought factors and ground-based observed SPEI-3
    as predictors and response variable, respectively. We ensured the independence
    and balance between the training set and test set by employing k-fold cross-validation
    on the data. However, running the cross-validation process once may lead to inaccurate
    estimation of model performance, and different splits of the data can yield varying
    results. To address this, we conducted ten rounds of 10-fold cross-validation,
    resulting in a total of 100 experiments. In each round of 10-fold cross-validation,
    the dataset was divided into 10 parts, with 9 parts used as training data and
    1 part as test data. When building the stacking model, we further performed 5-fold
    cross-validation on the training set (Fig. 4). By performing multiple cross-validations,
    we mitigated the impact of randomness and enhanced the reliability of the experimental
    results. It is worth mentioning that each experiment''s training and testing data
    were independent. This approach is commonly used in machine learning to evaluate
    model performance (Kohavi, 1995). In our study, we used multiple metrics to assess
    the performance of the models. We chose the coefficient of determination (R2)
    as the primary metric because it reflects the model''s ability to explain the
    variance of the target variable well. We also used mean squared error (MSE) as
    a secondary metric because it measures the magnitude of the error between predicted
    values and actual values. R2 has a range of 0 to 1, with a higher value indicating
    a better ability of the model to explain the variance; MSE has a range from 0
    to positive infinity, with a lower value indicating a better predictive capability
    of the model. 3. Results 3.1. Performance assessment of individual models We performed
    ten 10-fold cross-validations on the data, and generated 100 training and validation
    data for model evaluation. After running each of 19 models for 100 times in 9
    sub-regions, the average R2 and MSE were obtained in Fig. 5. For all 9 sub-regions,
    CBR, ETR, XGB, LGBM, and RF showed the best performance, therefore we choose these
    5 models as the base models for subsequent model ensemble. Download : Download

    models, the choice of the meta-model can directly affect the final fit. Fig. 6
    shows the top 5 meta-models for each sub-region (The R2 values for all meta-models
    can be found in Table S3 in the appendix, while the MSE values are in Table S4.).
    Due to its advantages of automatic handling of categorical features and strong
    robustness, CBR is the best meta-model in each sub-region. Therefore, CBR will
    be used as the meta-model for all subsequent stacking models. Download : Download

    performance of stacking versus 5 base models across 9 sub-regions, and the R2
    values of the results are shown in Fig. 7. The MSE values can be found in Appendix
    Fig. S2. Overall, the stacking model performed better than individual models in
    terms of both performance and stability. In the 5 regions located closer to the
    eastern part of China, including Northeast Plain, South China Region, Huang-Huai-Hai
    Plain, Loess Plateau Region, and The Middle and Lower Reaches of the Yangtze River,
    the stacking model fitted R2 values were all above 0.89, indicating a relatively
    excellent estimation performance. However, in the 4 regions located more towards
    the west, including the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau, Semi-Arid and Arid Areas of Northern
    China, Sichuan Basin and Its Surrounding Areas, and Yunnan-Guizhou Plateau, the
    stacking model''s R2 values were all above 0.8, which was marginally lower than
    that of the eastern regions. Combined with the station count (Table S1), increasing
    data has a small impact on the accuracy of machine learning estimates of drought,
    but it can improve the stability of the estimates to some extent. Download : Download

    of the stacking model in estimating droughts at individual points based on continuous
    time series. We chose to display three-month scale SPEI-3 for stations 54,063
    and 57,411 from 2001 to 2017 because they are in the eastern and western regions,

    in the stacking model The weighted relative importance method of stacking model
    is to weight the predictions of each base model based on their score ratio in
    cross-validation. Specifically, the weighted relative importance of each factor
    is the sum of its relative importance in each base model multiplied by the relative
    importance of the feature generated by the base model in the stacking model. For
    example, to calculate the weighted relative average of ‘Pre’, first calculate
    its relative importance in each base model, then calculate the relative importance
    of the feature corresponding to each model when constructing the stacking model.
    Multiply these two values for each model and sum the results to obtain the weighted
    relative average of ‘Pre’. Fig. 10 shows the top 9 features with highest importance
    for each sub-region, while the importance scores of all features can be found
    in Table S5 in the appendix. In most regions, balance had the highest ranking,
    while in areas with scarce precipitation (The Semi-Arid and Arid Areas of Northern
    China and the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau), precipitation ranks highest. Climate zoning
    exerted a greater influence over larger areas. Meteorological factors generally
    had a greater contribution to model establishment compared to vegetation indices,
    while vegetation indices also played a role in improving the final prediction
    accuracy. Download : Download high-res image (615KB) Download : Download full-size

    the importance. 3.5. Comparison with reanalysis-based drought conditions We conducted
    a comparative analysis of the stacking model-based SPEI, GPCC-based SPEI, and
    ERA5-based SPEI against observed values at the site scale, as illustrated in Fig.
    S10. Our findings reveal that the stacking model-based SPEI demonstrates superior
    accuracy and robustness relative to the other products. Subsequently, we utilized
    the stacking model to estimate drought conditions in the cropping region of China
    across various seasons and years, based on the SPEI-3. This estimation was then
    juxtaposed with results obtained from two reanalysis datasets, namely GPCC and
    ERA5, as depicted in Fig. 11. The SPEI-3 estimated by the stacking model exhibit
    a strong correlation with those from GPCC and ERA5, evidenced by R2 values exceeding
    0.8. The results indicate that the stacking model performs well in estimating
    large-scale drought conditions. Download : Download high-res image (2MB) Download

    computed between the SPEI-3 estimated by the stacking model and those generated
    by the reanalysis datasets. 4. Discussion Remote sensing products provide a wealth
    of spatial information and time series data, which makes it possible for accurate
    estimation of seasonal drought (Yin et al., 2022, Zuo et al., 2019). It is possible
    that there is a nonlinear relationship between SPEI and drought factors, and certain
    machine learning algorithms are well-suited for analyzing this type of relationship.
    In our study, we utilized the machine learning ensemble model approach along with
    remote sensing data to invert regional drought conditions. Our methods achieved
    robust results for seasonal drought estimation. Based on previous research (Feng
    et al., 2019, Kikon and Deka, 2022, Yang et al., 2021) and comparisons of numerous
    models in different regions, we found that the performance of machine learning
    methods for drought monitoring areas are region-specific. Of 19 machine learning
    models, CBR had the best performance in predicting SPEI as it reduces the need
    for tuning many hyperparameters and decreases the chance of overfitting, and its
    performance in estimating drought can rival that of most machine learning algorithms.
    Both Huang et al. (2019) and Katimbo et al. (2023) utilized CBR to estimate ET0
    and CWSI respectively, and CBR exhibited superior performance compared to other
    models in both cases. The results of model comparison showed a great improvement
    in prediction accuracy by integrating 5 models with the stacking method. However,
    there was a difference in prediction accuracy between the eastern and western
    regions of China, with the average R2 of the stacking model being 0.91 in the
    5 eastern regions and 0.82 in the western region. This difference in prediction
    accuracy can be attributed to a combination of factors, such as topography, humidity,
    data quality, monsoon, and drought frequency. Fig. 1a shows the topography of
    China, with sub-regions in the west located mostly on the first and second tiers
    of China with high elevation and undulating terrain, while sub-regions in the
    east are generally characterized by lower or flatter terrain. According to Table
    S1, the average annual precipitation in the 5 eastern regions is 922 mm, while
    that in the 4 western regions is only 441 mm. Therefore, the estimation performance
    will be better in humid regions, which is consistent with the conclusion of Feng
    et al. (2019). Furthermore, Ma et al. (2023) showed that multi-source precipitation
    estimate products, including satellite-based PERSIANN-CDR and GPCC/ERA5 reanalysis
    data, performed better in calculating SPEI in the eastern regions of China. Compared
    to the approach of using multi-source precipitation estimate products for drought
    estimation from Ma et al. (2023) and Chen et al. (2019b), we made a progress in
    terms of accuracy and incorporating ground-based observation data for further
    validation. In addition, the importance of different remote sensing drought factors
    varies in different regions (Fig. 10). For example, the ''balance'' index, which
    reflects the difference between precipitation and PET, dominates the importance
    in most regions. The importance of precipitation is relatively high in areas with
    less rainfall, while the importance of climate zoning increases in larger areas,
    such as The Semi-Arid and Arid Areas of Northern China and The Middle and Lower
    Reaches of the Yangtze River. Compared with meteorological indices, the importance
    of vegetation indices in drought estimation is relatively low, possibly because
    vegetation response to drought takes some time and different types of land cover
    have a large variation in sensitivity to drought (Yin et al., 2022). However,
    they still provide valuable information for drought estimation. Therefore, the
    selection of remote sensing drought factors is crucial for accurate estimation
    and monitoring of drought and should be chosen according to specific application
    scenarios. We used a stacking model to estimate the drought conditions in China''s
    cropping areas and found high consistency with drought maps generated by ground-truth
    GPCC and ERA5 data. Therefore, we believe that the remote sensing data fusion
    method based on machine learning ensemble models can produce reliable drought
    estimation. The improving capacity of multiple sensors observations helps us develop
    a deeper understanding of the mechanisms underlying drought, leading to more effective
    monitoring of drought (Jiao et al., 2021). The integration of machine learning
    and ensemble models for estimating drought using remote sensing data is more effective
    than simple models. The stacking ensemble approach is only one of the model fusion
    and integration methods. Some related studies, such as those conducted by Alizadeh
    and Nikoo (2018) and Wang (2022), have also shown that model fusion-based methods
    can achieve better results in drought estimation. Our future work will consider
    using more data-fusion ensemble methods in drought prediction. By utilizing our
    research method, we can offer valuable insights informing seasonal drought prevention
    and control policies in agricultural regions. Our findings provide evidence-based
    support, allowing policymakers to make informed decisions regarding strategies
    and measures to mitigate the impacts of drought on agriculture. For example, as
    there is a significant correlation between SPEI and crop yield (Feng et al., 2019,
    Labudová et al., 2017, Mohammed et al., 2022, Wang et al., 2020), by analyzing
    seasonal drought maps based on our SPEI-3, we can help local farmers assess the
    sensitivity of different crops to drought by combining it with crop yield data.
    Meanwhile, by planting drought-resistant crops during dry seasons and high-value
    crops during wet seasons, our drought maps can optimize agricultural practices
    to mitigate the impacts of drought. Though the accuracy in western China is slightly
    lower than that in eastern China, our research results are still significant because
    most of China''s cropping areas are located in the east. However, we acknowledge
    that the default parameters of our machine learning methods and the use of 5 base
    models in the ensemble model may not necessarily yield the best results. Nonetheless,
    these choices were made to strike a balance between computational complexity and
    the applicability of our approach. In future studies, we plan to enhance the applicability
    and accuracy of our research methods in regions with unique terrain and climate
    by using more appropriate remote sensing drought factors, denser site data, advanced
    model algorithms, and model integration methods. Additionally, we will focus more
    on predicting seasonal drought occurrences and assessing the likelihood of future
    drought events using precise drought estimation data to better inform decision-making
    and management. 5. Conclusions This study compared the performance of 19 individual
    base models in estimating 3-month scale SPEI using fused remote sensing drought
    factors from PERSIANN-CDR and MODIS satellites and China''s climate zoning data
    processed by dummy variables across 9 agricultural regions in China. The best
    meta-model was selected among the 18 models to integrate the top 5 individual
    base models using stacking approach, and the performance of the stacking model
    was compared and evaluated. The results showed that CBR, ETR, XGB, LGBM, and RF
    were the top-performing base models in estimating drought, while CBR also performed
    well as the meta-model. The stacking model with CBR as the meta-model was utilized
    to estimate seasonal drought in spring 2013, summer 2014, autumn 2015, and winter
    2016, and the results were compared with SPEI-3 produced by two reanalysis datasets,
    GPCC and ERA5. The stacking model integrated the strengths of the individual models
    and had good performance in estimating drought. When evaluating the performance
    of the stacking model, the accuracy in the eastern region of China was higher
    than that in the western region. When conducting large-scale drought estimation,
    the independent operation of each agricultural region and the incorporation of
    meteorological zoning data also improved the accuracy of the estimates. Here we
    took China as a case study area. However, the methodological framework can be
    applied to other regions with vast areas and significant differences in terrain
    and climate, such as Europe and the United States. We suggest that more high-resolution
    remote sensing data should be used a to provide more accurate and scientific guidance
    for seasonal drought at a local scale. Future research should further explore
    the use of more promising remote sensing drought factors, denser station data,
    advanced model algorithms, and model ensemble techniques for further enhancing
    the accuracy and reliability of drought monitoring. CRediT authorship contribution

  description: The Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) data has brought
    significant advancements in groundwater (GW) analysis by providing crucial information
    about changes in the gravity field of Earth and water storage. GRACE data are
    instrumental in understanding GW dynamics, monitoring aquifer depletion, and assessing
    water resource management strategies for sustainable utilization. Nevertheless,

    which utilized machine learning (ML) methods for Downscaling GRACE (DG) and also
    Modeling and Forecasting GW via GRACE data (MFGG). Papers were obtained from Scopus
    and Web of Science databases. A total of 78% and 22% of the analyzed papers focused
    on DG and MFGG, respectively. The investigation of the papers revealed that the
    majority employed the random forest (RF) method. Subsequently, gradient boosting
    (GB), deep learning, and artificial neural network (ANN) methods were the most
    commonly applied ML techniques, respectively. The selection of input parameters
    has a significant impact on the modeling performance. Of the papers examined,
    approximately 62.5% incorporated precipitation as an input, whereas evapotranspiration
    and temperature were utilized in 40% and 43.75% of the cases, respectively. The
    results of the analysis demonstrated the capability of ML models for DG and MFGG.
    After investigating different studies on the application of GRACE data in DG and
    MFGG, it was concluded that only a few studies considered the adaptation of GRACE
    data trend and manner with the observed and in situ values of the wells; however,
    it is important to consider their compatibility in order to achieve accurate results.
    Moreover, it is suggested to leverage development in ML, as well as progress in

    learningDownscaling 1. Introduction Groundwater (GW), which accounts for 3% of
    all freshwater on Earth, represents the largest freshwater reserve. Approximately,
    69% of the freshwater on the planet exists as ice in the glaciers and polar ice
    caps, while another 30% lies beneath the surface as GW (Agarwal et al., 2023).
    GW serves as a vital freshwater source to meet the agricultural, industrial, and
    domestic water demands. Additionally, during periods of drought, it plays a crucial
    role in sustaining river flow and acts as safeguard against variations in precipitation
    (Pr). Over the past few decades, numerous aquifers worldwide have experienced
    unprecedented stress caused by human activities, including population increases,
    growth of the irrigated areas, and various economic activities, resulting in remarkable
    increase in GW consumption. Depletion of the GW can pose significant challenges
    to global water security, the environment, and food security, potentially triggering
    mass migration. To address this situation, it is essential to accurately quantify
    long-term changes in GW storage. This information can help to better manage GW
    resources and provide insights into the extent of the GW reduction specially in
    arid and semi-arid regions. The measurement of the GW level changes in various
    regions often involves the use of piezometers and observational monitoring wells.
    Nevertheless, large-scale monitoring would prove to be both expensive and time-intensive,
    and the usefulness of these methods has been constrained by the absence of the
    precise spatial resolution and insufficient number of the measurement points.
    The Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) satellite data has been produced
    with the development of the remote sensing (RS) different products. The deployment
    of the GRACE satellites, monitors terrestrial water storage anomalies (TWSA) on
    the regional and global scales (Tapley et al., 2004). The GRACE mission, initially
    planned for a 5-year lifetime, exceeded expectations by collecting gravity-inferred
    mass change data for a span of 15 years, from March 17, 2002, to June 2017. To
    ensure continuity, the GRACE Follow-On (GRACE-FO) twin-satellite gravity mission
    was launched in May 2018 as a successor mission. However, there is a significant
    data gap of 11 months between the GRACE and GRACE-FO missions. This gap arises
    from various factors, including satellite maneuvers aimed at extending the mission''s
    lifetime and insufficient ground track coverage, such as short repeat-cycling
    orbits, resulting in multiple data gaps within the GRACE/-FO solution time series
    for individual months. Compared to the global models, GRACE offers an enhanced
    assessment of water resource fluctuations on the global scale. GRACE data account
    for horizontal profiles of the water storage, considering the combined effects
    of climate and human influence. Consequently, GRACE data could be served as a
    dependable source for evaluating GW storage (Jing et al., 2020a). By utilizing
    auxiliary variables obtained from RS data and in situ measurements, it is possible
    to extract the TWSA. Over time, GRACE satellites data have been extensively employed
    to analyze the spatiotemporal attributes of the GW storage in various areas (Yin
    et al., 2022a). Despite the wide use of the GRACE products, they have certain
    limitations, particularly their coarse spatial resolution, which significantly
    restricts their applicability in small- and medium-scale areas. In order to effectively
    monitor and manage GW at local and regional scales using GRACE data, it is essential
    to employ a downscaling process (Chen et al., 2019). Downscaling of the GRACE
    data involves disaggregating the coarse-resolution (approximately 110 km) into
    the finer resolutions (hundreds of meters) to facilitate their use in the local-to-regional
    applications. The spatial downscaling of the TWSA data derived from the GRACE
    can be accomplished through Dynamic Downscaling (DD) or Statistical Downscaling
    (SD) techniques. DD involves assimilating low-resolution GRACE data into a fine
    scale by utilizing the physical processes of the land surface model and atmospheric
    forcing to produce the high-resolution GRACE data (Jyolsna et al., 2021). The
    SD method aims to establish empirical relationships between the GRACE observations
    and high-resolution variables of interest. In this approach, nonparametric statistical
    model is trained to predict the local TWSA using the GRACE and other environmental
    variables that affect the GW storage. Compared to the DD methods, SD methods are
    typically data-driven and require less time to implement (Milewski et al., 2019).
    Data-driven approaches in modeling can be categorized into black-box and white-box
    methods. Black-box approaches like artificial neural networks (ANNs) lack explicit
    relationships between variables, while white-box methods provide clear formulas
    and comprehensible relationships (Ghasemi et al., 2023). The implementation of
    the Machine Learning (ML) methods for the SD of the GRACE data has garnered increasing
    attention. This is primarily due to the capability of the ML methods to establish
    nonlinear relationships between the input parameters and targets. Notably, the
    ML methods do not require any prior assumptions about the physical system as long
    as the suitable predictor datasets are utilized. Owing to the outstanding performance
    of the ML-based methods in modeling, these statistical techniques can be used
    to find connections between the low-resolution and high-resolution data (Zhang
    et al., 2021). As the GW is influenced by various land surface factors, such as
    geographical location, vegetation cover, topographic characteristics, and ground
    temperature, these parameters can be used as inputs for the ML methods for SD.
    This approach can help increase the resolution of the data, making it possible
    to conduct more accurate regional-scale analyses of the water storage changes
    while providing a synoptic view of the data that is both time- and cost-efficient.
    Shallow learning methods, also known as traditional ML methods, are class of algorithms
    that typically rely on explicit feature engineering and are characterized by the
    relatively shallow structure with a limited number of layers. Among ML methods,
    the deep learning methods have shown significant improvements in performance compared
    to the traditional shallow learning methods, making them preferred choice for
    many applications in hydroclimatic studies (Kim and Kim, 2021; Nourani et al.,
    2022). Deep learning methods are considered suitable for addressing the noisy
    and chaotic nature of time-series modeling, which can result in more accurate
    predictions. ML capabilities have been utilized in a diverse range of the studies
    focusing on the downscaling GRACE data, encompassing both shallow learning methods
    (Yin et al., 2018; Zhang et al., 2021; Ali et al., 2021; Zuo et al., 2021) and
    deep learning methods (He et al., 2021; Gorugantula and Kambhammettu 2022; Memarian
    Sorkhabi et al., 2023; Foroumandi et al., 2023). Shallow learning methods are
    suitable when dealing with the limited data, whereas deep learning approaches
    excel in handling the complex processes and benefit from the larger datasets,
    leading to improved results. This study aimed to investigate papers associated
    with downscaling GRACE data (DG) and modeling and forecasting GW using GRACE data
    (MFGG). The writing a review article in this field can identify key trends, challenges
    associated with downscaling GRACE data, which is obtained at coarse spatial resolutions,
    to finer scales suitable, and gaps in the application of ML and downscaling GRACE
    data for GW modeling. Furthermore, it can shed light on the potential benefits
    and implications of integrating ML into GW modeling practices. Overall, the review
    article aims to provide a comprehensive overview of the current state of research,
    highlight advancements, and offer insights into future directions for leveraging
    ML and downscaling GRACE data in GW modeling, ultimately contributing to advancements
    in this important field of study. For this purpose, the analysis focused on different
    aspects, such as the ML applied methods, considered input variables, employed
    evaluation metrics, and other relevant issues. Finally, the limitations in application
    of the GRACE data and agenda for future works are presented. 2. Review methodology
    Systematic reviews play a crucial role in summarizing existing knowledge and relationships
    within a specific field, enabling the identification of the areas for improvement
    and future research priorities. Therefore, it is imperative to use carefully designed
    and well-structured methodology. There are multiple systematic literature reviews
    methodologies like Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses
    (PRISMA), Qualitative systematic review, Meta-analysis, Scoping Reviews, Mixed
    Methods Reviews. In this study, the updated 2020 PRISMA statement was used (Page
    et al., 2021) to do the systematic review. Previous review of the GW investigation
    successfully applied the PRISMA statement (Rajaee et al., 2019; Afrifa et al.,
    2022; Ahmadi et al., 2022; Narvaez-Montoya et al., 2023; Uc-Castillo et al., 2023).
    PRISMA offers dependable framework for evaluating relevant research articles and
    establishing clear inclusion and exclusion criteria. The PRISMA approach involves
    four main steps. First, it identifies all potentially relevant data and refines
    the search criteria accordingly. Next, the inclusion or exclusion of samples are
    determined based on predefined criteria aligned with the objectives of the reviews,
    thereby selecting eligible research. During the screening and eligibility criteria
    phases, the objective is to identify studies that meet the inclusion criteria
    for the review. This step aims to ensure transparency and minimize bias during
    the selection process. The third step involves extracting pertinent data from
    the final set of the selected studies (Afrifa et al., 2022). Finally, an analysis
    and summary of the findings are presented. It is possible that not all relevant
    articles are included in the review; however, a substantial number are obtained
    through PRISMA search. In certain instances, specific references are included
    in the discussion, even if they were not part of the formal review process. Fig.

    PRISMA flowchart diagram illustrated the various stages of the systematic review,
    along with the corresponding number of records at each step. First step is removal
    of duplicated papers, second step is title screening and then it is the process
    of abstract screening. Finally, the proper papers were considered based on exclusion
    and inclusion criteria. Relevant literatures were searched using Web of science
    (WOS) and Scopus databases. The literature search employed Boolean operator AND,
    in both Web of science and Scopus. The search keywords included (“GRACE”, “Groundwater”,
    “Downscaling”) and (“GRACE”, “Groundwater” “Machine learning”). The search included
    Abstract, Article title, and keywords of papers. The search was conducted on August
    9, 2023, resulting in 170 articles that matched the search criteria. The title,
    keyword, abstract, digital object identifier (DOI), and relevant information from
    the articles were documented in an Excel file. Because two databases were utilized,
    there were numerous duplicate articles. To address this, an Excel spreadsheet
    was used. After removing duplicates and manually validating the remaining articles,
    101 articles were retained for subsequent steps, which involved title and abstract
    screening (see Fig. 1). These screening procedures followed a set of the inclusion
    criteria established by the authors along with other additional criteria. For
    this study, the following criteria were applied to determine whether a report
    had been removed (I) or met (II). I. Exclusion criteria: The following criteria
    were used to exclude any report: ⁃ The titles did not fall within the scope of
    the study (application of the ML in modeling GRACE data and GW), leading to the
    discarding of 4 reports (Fig. 1). ⁃ Abstract did not present the original research,
    resulting in the deletion of 2 reports (Fig. 1). II. Criteria for Inclusion: The
    research included reports that met the following criteria: ⁃ The articles were
    published in English, and the abstracts contained original research on the topics;
    the articles within the paper scope introduced the GRACE data downscaling and
    employment of the ML in modeling GRACE and GW. Conference, short papers, and workshop
    publications were excluded from the review. The literature sample was limited
    to articles published in English between 2002 and 2023. Finally, 90 papers were
    considered in the reviewing process. 3. Results and discussion GRACE, as a satellite
    RS mission, holds the distinction of being the pioneering endeavor capable of
    directly assessing GW storage across diverse terrestrial conditions. In Rodell
    and Famiglietti (2001) the applications of the GRACE data satellite were discussed.
    Approximately at first decade of the GRACE satellite lunch, the different studies
    used GRACE data for calculation of GW level anomaly in large scale. The GRACE
    offers data that describes monthly variations in the geoid, which are strongly
    correlated with changes in vertically integrated TWSA (Swenson et al., 2003).
    With the availability of supplementary data on soil moisture (SM) and snow, it
    becomes possible to estimate variations in GW storage. For example, Yeh et al.
    (2006) estimated regional GW storage via monthly GRACE total water storage change.
    Rodell et al. (2007) isolated GW storage anomalies from GRACE water storage data
    via the Global Land Data Assimilation System (GLDAS) data. The GRACE-derived TWSA
    encompasses various water components along the vertical profile, including SM,
    surface water, GW, snow, and canopy. For calculation of GW storage anomalies,
    the vertical water model is applied as Eq. (1) (Foroumandi et al., 2023): (1)
    TWSA = GWSA + SWSA + SMSA + SWEA where SWSA, SMSA, and SWEA are the surface water
    storage anomaly, SM storage anomaly, and snow water equivalent anomaly, respectively.
    In some conditions, some parameters of Eq. (1) can be excluded. For example, in
    areas with arid climate, TWSA is influenced by GW storage anomaly and soil moisture
    storage anomaly, so other parameters can be ignored. 3.1. Implemented methods
    in reviewed papers Reviewing the considered papers indicated that, according to
    the analyzed papers, from 2011 some papers attempted to assimilate GRACE data
    with other methods inputs like land surface models for improving the estimation
    of different parameters (See Table 1) and then the following two approaches, consist
    of the DG and MFGG were considered in the studies. Table 1. Studies associated

    learning algorithm that combines multiple predictors. This involves building decision
    trees using bootstrap datasets and considering a random subset of variables at
    each step. This results in a diverse set of trees, and the process is repeated
    multiple times, giving rise to the name \"Random Forest”. The decision trees in
    the RF run in parallel with no interaction between them. RF is widely used in
    RS and hydrology because of its ability to handle classification and regression
    problems, effectively. RF offers several benefits for solving regression problems.
    First, it can handle large datasets with thousands of the variables simultaneously
    without overfitting. Second, it can be run efficiently and accurately on such
    datasets. Third, it can detect the importance and interactions of the variables.
    Additionally, RF is not sensitive to collinearity and spreads variable importance
    across all variables, allowing for correlated variables to be evaluated similarly
    in terms of their importance. For details about RF method, see (Breiman, 2001).
    GB is a popular ML technique used for both regression and classification tasks,
    which iteratively combines weak learning models to produce a strong predictive
    model. During each iteration of GB, a new weak model is trained to predict the
    errors created by the strong model. The dissimilarity between a calculated value
    and a regressive label is referred to \"error”. Subsequently, the weak model is
    incorporated into the strong model with a negative sign to minimize the error
    of the strong model. For more details about GB see (Friedman, 2001). ANNs are
    AI based models that mimic the structure and functionality of the human brain.
    They comprise layers of interconnected nodes, called artificial neurons, that
    collaborate to process and learn from the input information. Every neuron receives
    input from other neurons, performs a mathematical operation on the input, and
    transmits the output to the other neurons in the subsequent layer. By using backpropagation,
    ANNs can modify the strength of connections between neurons based on feedback,
    enabling them to learn from examples and enhance their performance over time.
    For details about ANN see (Nourani et al., 2019). LSTM networks are a unique class
    of recurrent neural networks that excel in learning long-term dependencies and
    are widely used for handling sequential data, including time-series data. The
    vanishing gradient problem is resolved by LSTM networks, where the gradient becomes
    too small or too large owing to a significant time step. This issue arises during
    backpropagation of the optimizer, causing the algorithm to run while the weights
    remain almost static. The LSTM cell consists of an input gate, forget gate, and
    output gate that functions as a simple multilayer perceptron. These gates determine
    the priority of the data and allow or disallow the data passage, accordingly.
    The gates also enable the network to learn what to save, forget, remember, pay
    attention, and output. The cell and hidden states are utilized to gather data
    for processing in the subsequent state, thereby protecting against the vanishing
    gradient issue. For the subsequent processing steps, the cell state and hidden
    state are employed to collect information. For details about LSTM see (Nourani
    et al., 2022). In a typical CNN architecture, a nonlinear activation function
    is applied after the convolutional layer, followed by a pooling layer. The pooling
    layer uses subsampling technique to extract specific values from the convolved
    features and produce a lower-dimensional matrix. The pooling layer also uses a
    sliding window to obtain input from each patch of the convolved features, producing
    a new value based on a specified operation, such as max pooling or average pooling.
    This produces new matrices that summarize the convolved features generated by
    the convolutional layer. The pooling operation can help increase the robustness
    of the system because small changes in the input data will not significantly alter
    the pooled output values. For details about CNN see (Rawat and Wang, 2017). The
    multilinear regression method is a widely used statistical technique in modeling
    that aims to establish relationships between dependent variable and multiple independent
    variables (Yin et al., 2022a). This method assumes linear relationship between
    the variables and seeks to estimate the coefficients that represent the impact
    of each independent variable on the dependent variable. By incorporating multiple
    predictors, multilinear regression allows for a more comprehensive analysis of
    the factors influencing the outcome variable. It enables researchers to assess
    the relative importance and contribution of each independent variable and quantify
    their effects on the dependent variable. Moreover, multilinear regression provides
    insights into the strength and direction of these relationships, allowing for
    predictions and hypothesis testing. However, it is important to note that the
    assumptions of linearity, independence, homoscedasticity, and absence of multicollinearity
    should be met for reliable and valid interpretations of the regression models.
    Overall, the multilinear regression method serves as a valuable tool in hydroclimatic
    modeling, enabling researchers to understand and predict the relationships between
    variables in a complex system. One of the most pressing issues with GRACE data
    is the interpolation of the missing months through ML. The presence of temporal
    gaps in the GRACE mission, including a 20-month gap, between the GRACE and GRACE-FO
    missions with an 11-month gap, as well as within the GRACE-FO record with a 2-month
    gap, poses challenges in analyzing and understanding the spatiotemporal changes
    in terrestrial water storage derived from GRACE and GRACE-FO data. Sun et al.,
    (2020) reconstructed TWSA data by using the deep learning, MLR, and SARIMAX models.
    These data-driven statistical models are based on the empirical relationships
    between the GRACE data and climate drivers or the past TWSA data and the present
    time series. Uz et al. (2022) bridged the global 11-month data gap and reconstruct
    high-resolution global land TWSA maps and employed combination of deep learning
    models including CNN, deep convolutional autoencoders, and Bayesian CNN. The training
    datasets consist of GRACE and GRACE-FO mascon and Swarm gravimetry data, ECMWF
    Reanalysis-5 data, and normalized time tag information. Gyawali et al. (2022)
    applied combination of deep learning, generalized linear model, and GB. By incorporating
    eight climatic and hydrological input variables, this approach aims to fill the
    data gaps and reconstruct the GRACE data record at both the global grid and basin
    scales. Zhang et al. (2023) applied a GW storage model called NGFLOW-GRACE to
    construct GW storage change model. Appropriate reconstructed data were selected
    within the empty window period to complete cycle (January 2003 to December 2020)
    of GWSA. Memarian Sorkhabi et al. (2023) downscaled the GW storage in Iran from
    2003 to 2021, Deep Learning approach was employed by integrating data from the
    GRACE and GRACE-FO, along with a hydrological model. GW is affected by various
    climatic variables, and because of the high impact of these variables, they can
    be considered as inputs for GW modeling. Based on a review of the multiple papers
    with both approaches of DG and MFGG, most of the studies applied Pr, evapotranspiration
    (ET) and temperature (Tem) as the base inputs for modeling and downscaling of
    GRACE data. However, there were different combinations of these basic inputs with
    other inputs as SM, Land surface temperature (LST), normalized differences vegetation
    index (NDVI), Digital Elevation Model (DEM) and also other variables. Moreover,
    some studies have used climate change (Shiru, et al., 2021) data or teleconnection
    patterns as inputs. The influence of teleconnection pattern on controlling variations
    in GW fluctuation is frequently overlooked because of the absence of a direct
    relationship and impact on GW-level fluctuations. Ali et al. (2022) stated that
    teleconnections could have a notable impact on the GW Drought Index. Gao et al.
    (2022) expressed that according to the results of the cross-wavelet transform
    analysis, it is evident that the El Niño-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) exerts the
    most significant influence on the GW storage anomaly on the Tibetan Plateau. Kalu
    et al. (2022) emphasized on teleconnection patterns. Moreover, it was mentioned
    in this study that ENSO influences GW levels through its role in land-use change,
    which affects the rate of water withdrawal in specific regions and ENSO plays
    a significant role in modulating hydrological fluxes, including Pr patterns and
    Tem, which can contribute to both the depletion and replenishment of aquifers.
    On the other hand, Zhang et al. (2023) suggested that results could be less affected
    by aggregations of RS data, whereas the hydraulic gradient coefficient exhibits
    the highest level of sensitivity. The use of performance metrics in ML modeling
    is essential for evaluating and comparing the effectiveness of different models,
    enabling informed decision-making and improving the overall performance and reliability
    of ML systems. After reviewing the relevant papers, it became evident that the
    Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) is the most commonly used evaluation metric, used
    in 48.75% of papers. Other frequently used metrics include Nash–Sutcliffe Efficiency
    (NSE), Mean Absolute Error (MAE), and correlation coefficient (CC). The percentage
    of the most commonly used metrics are shown in Fig. 2. Download : Download high-res
    image (174KB) Download : Download full-size image Fig. 2. The most commonly used
    evaluation metrics in the reviewed studies. The common performance evaluation
    metrics are described as follows: RMSE quantifies the average magnitude of the
    errors between predicted values and the corresponding actual values. The RMSE
    value represents the square root of the mean of the squared differences between
    predicted and actual values. A lower RMSE value indicates that the predictions
    of models are closer to the true values, demonstrating better accuracy. NSE is
    used to assess the predictive skill of hydrological models. A perfect model with
    zero estimation error variance yielded an NSE value of 1, indicating an optimal
    performance. Conversely, if estimation error variance of models matches the variance
    of the observed time series, NSE is 0. In some cases, NSE can even become negative,
    indicating that the observed mean is a better predictor than the model. Values
    closer to 1 indicate the model with higher predictive skill. CC measures the strength
    and direction of the linear relationship between the two variables. In the context
    of model evaluation, CC is often used to assess the level of agreement or similarity
    between predicted values and actual observed values. CC of 1 signifies a flawless
    positive linear relationship, whereas a CC of −1 presents a perfect negative linear
    relationship. When CC is close to 0, it suggests a weak or non-existent linear
    relationship between the predicted and observed values. The MAE is a metric to
    measure the average magnitude of the errors between the predicted and actual values
    in a dataset. It provides a numerical representation of the overall accuracy of
    the predictions regardless of their direction. A lower MAE value indicates a better
    prediction accuracy. Akaike''s formula, also known as the Akaike Information Criterion
    (AIC), is a statistical measure used for model selection and comparison. The AIC
    is based on the principle of balancing the goodness of fit of a model with its
    complexity, aiming to find the most parsimonious yet informative model. The AIC
    value can be interpreted as a measure of the trade-off between the model''s fit
    to the data and its complexity. The lower the AIC value, the better the model
    is considered. 3.2. Downscaling GRACE data via ML methods Downscaling is the technique
    used to transform the output data of large-scale and low-resolution global models
    into high-spatial resolution at a smaller scale. The SD method enables the construction
    of the flexible models and incorporation of the high-resolution modeling factors,
    thereby significantly enhancing the spatial resolution of the hydrological variables.
    Because of the large scale and low resolution of the GRACE data, they cannot be
    directly used in the modeling and assessment of the GW at local and regional scales;
    therefore, downscaling can be an appropriate solution to tackle this issue. The
    papers in the scope of the DG are tabulated in Table 3. Based on Table 3, most
    of the papers attempted to increase the resolution of the GRACE data to 0.25 that
    can be due to the division by a multiple of an integer in order to achieve higher
    resolution. Moreover, the obtained resolution is affected via the auxiliary variables
    like GLDAS that its resolution is 0.25 and the GLDAS satellite data were applied
    in majority of the reviewed papers. Table 3. References in scope of downscaling

    data offer valuable tools for understanding and forecasting GW dynamics. By leveraging
    the capabilities of the GRACE data and integrating with other datasets, these
    models can contribute to effective GW management, sustainable water resource planning,
    and informed decision-making. GRACE provides measurements of the variations in
    the gravity field of the Earth, enabling the estimation of changes in the GW storage.
    By analyzing historical GRACE data and correlating with other relevant variables,
    such as Pr patterns and water usage trends, researchers can develop predictive
    models to estimate future changes in GW storage. These models provide valuable
    insights into water resource planning, drought management, and sustainable GW
    extraction practices. In Table 4 the studies which used GRACE data for MFGG purposes
    and also the applied input variables and modeling evaluation metrics are tabulated.

    has been a growing trend in publications on the GRACE data related to GW hydrology.
    The trends between 2002 and 2023 are depicted in Fig. 3. The number of articles
    published between 2002 and 2018 was minimal; However, since 2018, the number of
    publications has been steadily increasing, reaching its peak of 21 publications
    in 2023. A total of 38 articles related to this field have been reported in 2022

    Based on this systematic review, it was observed that China (35%), the U.S.A (19%),
    India (15%) and Iran (8%) are the four countries with the highest percentage of
    publications (Fig. 5). In addition to specialization and expansion of the science,
    problems in countries can be the reason to write and to pay attention to GRACE
    data. The decline in GW storage in countries can be attributed to various factors.
    One primary reason is overextraction, where the rate of GW pumping exceeds the
    natural recharge rate, leading to a depletion of aquifer storage. Population growth,
    expanding agricultural irrigation, and industrial water demands contribute to
    increased GW pumping, exacerbating the issue. Additionally, climate change-induced
    shifts in Pr patterns and reduced recharge rates further impact GW storage. Inadequate
    regulations, poor water management practices, and the absence of sustainable GW
    governance also contribute to the decline in GW storage in many countries. Addressing
    these challenges requires a comprehensive approach that includes efficient water
    use practices, GW monitoring, policy reforms, and sustainable management strategies
    to ensure the long-term sustainability of GW resources. Download : Download high-res

    of the reviewed papers in this study a) world map b) pie chart. The global GW
    storage conditions vary significantly across different regions of the world. While
    some areas exhibit stables or replenishing GW storage, many regions face the challenges
    of declining GW levels and depletion due to overextraction and unsustainable water
    management practices. The reviewed papers presented the GW anomaly levels in several
    countries. Notably, Foroumandi et al. (2023) emphasized that Iran has been grappling
    with long-lasting drought since 2010, with specific regions enduring severe drought
    conditions. This study further revealed continuous decline in GW storage across
    the Iran from 2002 to 2016. Moreover, declining trend in Iran has been presented
    by Soltani and Azari (2022), which showed decrease to 448.47 kg/m2 compared with
    the observational average in Iran. In addition, Memarian Sorkhabi et al. (2023)
    reported a decrease of up to 15 mm/year in Iran for GW storage. About the GW storage
    in India, Karunakalage et al. (2021) reported that the Mehsana district of Gujarat,
    India experienced a negative anomaly in GW storage change over a span of 15 years.
    The downscaled GRACE data revealed a GW storage decline rate of −60.33 ± 5.00
    mm/year and −80.00 ± 6.12 mm/year in the area. In addition, Jyolsna et al. (2021)
    revealed a consistent decrease in GW Storage across all basins of India, with
    depletion rates ranging from −0.17 ± 0.01 cm/year in northern India to 0.015 ±
    0.01 cm/year in western India and cumulative annual GW depletion from all basins
    combined amount to 0.49 km3/year of water. In the Krishna River Basin, India,
    Gorugantula and Kambhammettu (2022) reported an annual decrease rate of 1.2 mm/year,
    resulting in a storage depletion of 19.2 km3. Gao et al. (2022) revealed a notable
    downward trend in GW levels, with the Brahmaputra Basin of India exhibiting the
    most pronounced decline at a rate of −13.84 mm/year. Similarly, there is a declining
    trend in the results of modeling GW for the China. Wang et al. (2023) reported
    decrease of −0.40± 0.01 cm/year in China. Also, Yin et al. (2018) relieved −0.85
    cm in China Beijing plain and Zhang et al. (2023) reported −17.15 mm/year in North
    China plain. According to Khorrami et al. (2023), via the study conducted in Turkey
    it was revealed that GW storage experiences an estimated annual depletion rate
    of 0.14 km3/year. This equates to a total GW depletion of approximately 2.57 km3
    between 2003 and 2020. In Nigeria, the findings of Shiru et al. (2021) indicated
    that water storage is expected to decrease during the wet season (June–September)
    and increase during the dry season (January–May). The projected decrease in water
    availability for the future periods was up to 17 mm during the wet season based
    on pessimistic scenario of the general circulation models. Ali et al. (2023) expressed
    −496.99 mm and −734.01 mm, respectively, occurred in 2010 and 2016 in dry alluvial
    Plains in the south of the Pakistan. Sahour et al. (2020) indicated increases
    of 103–122 mm/year and GRACE GWS 100–130 mm/year in the Lower Peninsula of Michigan
    in the U.S. Agarwal et al. (2023) reported that the Central Valley of California
    experienced a GW storage loss of approximately 30 km3 between October 2002 and
    September 2016. However, there were periods during or after Pr events where depletion
    was followed by recharge. The most significant GW depletion occurred during the
    drought periods of January 2007 to December 2009 and October 2011 to September
    2015, with depletion rates of approximately −5.7 ± 1.2 km3/year and −9.8 ± 1.7
    km3/year, respectively in California. Milewski et al. (2019) also found that GW
    levels tended to remain relatively consistent across a significant portion of
    the study area in the Upper Floridan Aquifer, Georgia, U.S.A. Thus, it was concluded
    that, except for the U.S.A, the countries that were considered in the reviewed
    papers are facing GW resource shortages. 4. Limitations of GRACE application GRACE
    data has revolutionized the understanding the water resources of the Earth by
    measuring changes in gravity field of earth. It provides valuable data on variations
    in TWSA. GRACE was launched in 2002 and operated until its end of mission in 2017.
    To ensure the completeness of the modeling period using GRACE data, it is necessary
    to obtain updated data. The length of the data used in ML modeling is crucial.
    GRACE-FO, launched in 2018, serves as a follow-on mission to continue the valuable
    data collection initiated by GRACE. GRACE-FO ensures the continuity of the dataset
    and allows for the monitoring of long-term trends and changes. GRACE-FO builds
    upon the success of GRACE, incorporating technological advancements and ensuring
    continuity in data collection for a more comprehensive understanding of Earth''s
    water resources. Some studies have incorporated GRACE-FO data to enhance the comprehensiveness
    of the modeling process. There has been limited discussion regarding the data
    gap that occurred during the transition from GRACE to GRACE-FO satellites data
    between July 2017 and May 2018. The lack of data during this gap period has greatly
    hindered the ability to continuously monitor GW storage changes without interruptions
    (Zhang et al., 2023). The limitations of the GRACE and GRACE Follow-On data, including
    a relatively short time span of approximately 21 years and a coarse temporal resolution
    of 1 month, constrain the accuracy of these measures. Additionally, the inherent
    decay mechanism of the land surface system has not been taken into account. On
    the other hand, the limitations of the GRACE data include the leakage factor,
    ability to validate in data-sparse regions, and advanced bias correction (Pulla
    et al., 2023). The total water storage change represents the net outcome of all
    water movement within the hydrological system. The GRACE/GRACE-FO satellite missions
    provide unique capability to monitor the TWSA by measuring the coefficients of
    a spherical harmonic model. However, these observations are prone to correlated
    noise, necessitating filtering techniques that disperse actual mass changes from
    their accurate spatial positions. In addition, the downscaling predictors are
    not entirely error-free, making it challenging to assess the overall error. Furthermore,
    the verification process suffers from limitations, such as the limited number
    of the in-situ measurements and uneven spatial distribution. Additionally, lack
    of the accurate data on lakes, rivers, and reservoirs has prevented the inclusion
    of their contributions when compared to the in situ measurements (Zhang et al.,
    2021). 5. Conclusions and recommendations This systematic review summarized the
    current state-of-the-art in DG and MFGG using ML models. The survey covered the
    period of 2002–2023, where all the original research studies were obtained from
    Scopus and Web of Science databases. The PRISMA method was employed for systematic
    review and after screening the papers based on inclusion and excluding criteria,
    finally 40 papers were considered in this review. Due to the low spatial resolution
    of the GRACE data, most of the papers (about 78%) applied ML methods to SD the
    GRACE data. AI methods including RF, GB, deep learning and ANN were the common
    applied methods based on the reviewed papers. The most used inputs of the downscaling
    and modeling were climatic variables including Pr, Tem and ET. Also, some studies
    used teleconnection patterns as input for the downscaling. The findings of this
    study offered valuable insights into applying ML techniques for GRACE. In the
    future, the framework can be extended by incorporating an ensemble modeling approach.
    This involves leveraging the advantages of various ML methods and ensemble physics-based
    models with data-driven approaches. By doing so, downscaled GRACE data can become
    more reliable and precise. Ensemble and hybrid approaches offer the potential
    to overcome the limitations of individual models and effectively capture the complex
    dynamics of underlying hydrological processes and they can mitigate biases, handle
    complex relationships, and provide more reliable predictions. In addition, it
    is suggested to incorporate anthropogenic impact variables into the model inputs,
    which can notably enhance the performance of the model, especially in arid and
    semi-arid regions. By integrating additional RS data that captures water dynamics,
    the development of the resilient model for implementing GW management policies
    at both local and regional scales. Moreover, the specific impacts of agricultural
    activities on GW resources are constrained by the unavailability of ground-based
    crop-type classification data. To address this limitation, future studies could
    focus on examining agricultural activities and water resource issues in greater
    detail. Based on the analysis, there was not any study to combine the GRACE data
    analysis with quality parameters of the GW to assess the relationship between
    the GRACE data and GW quality parameters and to develop a model for this purpose.
    For example, over pumping of the GW in coastal areas can result in the intrusion
    of saline water from the ocean into freshwater aquifers. This intrusion can degrade
    the GW quality, making it unsuitable for various uses. Therefore, a model can
    be developed to model and predict the saltwater intrusion in costal aquifers via
    assessment of the GRACE data. In addition, developing user-friendly decision support
    systems or tools that incorporate downscaled GRACE data for efficient and informed
    GW management and planning can be considered. These systems can provide stakeholders
    with valuable insights and aid in sustainable water resource management. Also,
    among the analyzed papers only Sahour et al. (2020) attempted to use clustering.
    It is suggested that before application of the downscaling, observed GW piezometers
    in the study area to be clustered into different groups to arrange similar piezometers
    with similar behavior and trend, then investigate the adaptation of the observed
    representative piezometers manner with GRACE data and use downscaling to the regions
    that are more compatible in trend lines and manner. Based on the authors’ knowledge,
    there were only few studies about DD (Zhang et al., 2023; Sun et al., 2022, 2023),
    it is recommended for future studies to focus more on the employment of this downscaling
    method. After reviewing multiple papers, it becomes evident that the assessment
    of the uncertainty related to the SD of GRACE data was insufficient. Thus, it
    is suggested to thoroughly evaluate the uncertainty associated with the downscaling
    process and identify the different sources of the uncertainties. Based on established
    criteria for uncertainty quantification, it is crucial to report the corresponding
    uncertainty levels, accurately. CRediT authorship contribution statement Vahid

    learningRemote sensingMLPRandom forestNainital 1. Introduction Groundwater reserves
    are dwindling with an exponential increase in population and rise in pollution
    level. Further, climate change has adversely affected quantity and quality of
    groundwater (Famiglietti, 2014). Overexploitation of groundwater for domestic
    and economic use has threatened the recharge capacity of the aquifers. More groundwater
    in now being extracted to meet agricultural demands and increase the agricultural
    production (Das et al., 2019, 2021c). Moreover, inadequate management of water
    resources coupled with ecological degeneration has intensified freshwater scarcity
    manifold (Ahmed and Sajjad, 2018). Withdrawal of groundwater at an unprecedented
    rate has caused degradation in water quality, rise in pumping costs and land subsidence
    (Konikow and Kendy, 2005). Hence, unrestrained drawing of groundwater has resulted
    in serious adverse impacts on the environment, society and economy (CGWB Report,
    2014). Over time, there has been a rise in water consumption, which has led to
    water shortages in several regions of India (Saleth, 2011).If the present rate
    of exploitation continues, about 60 % of Indian aquifers would be rendered critical
    in the next two decades (World Bank, 2020). The results of such exploitation of
    water is clearly indicated in various states in India where groundwater crisis
    has emerged as a major challenge during the last 30 years (Kumar and Krishna,
    2018). The situation has made the contamination of the water problem severe. Inadequate
    water resource management and environmental degradation are the main causes of
    India''s fresh water crisis. Thus, assessment of groundwater and management is
    crucial for conservation and its long term sustainability (Ahmed and Sajjad, 2018;
    Elbeih, 2015; Tahmassebipoor et al., 2016). Earlier studies utilized conventional
    methods for assessing various aspects of groundwater which were manually tiring,
    time consuming and costly (Ahmed and Sajjad, 2018; Masroor et al., 2021). Recently,
    use of geospatial techniques has helped in exploring groundwater potential at
    spatial scale (Abdalla et al., 2020; Çelik, 2019). Multi – criteria decision making
    approach has also been widely utilized for preparing groundwater potential maps
    (Jhariya et al., 2016; Agarwal and Garg 2016; Mandal et al., 2016; Das and Mukhopadhyay
    2020). Etikala et al. (2019) used multi-influence factors and weighted overlay
    techniques in geographic information system (GIS) for assessing groundwater potential
    zones. Analytical hierarchy process (AHP) has been effectively utilized for assessing
    groundwater potential (Aladejana et al., 2016; Bera et al., 2020; Das et al.,
    2021a; Owolabi et al., 2020; Pinto et al., 2017; Rahmati et al., 2015; Saikia
    et al., 2023; Sutradhar et al., 2021). Recently the machine learning (ML) algorithms
    are being used for predictive modelling for recognizing complicated and nonlinear
    data of groundwater potential (Naghibi et al., 2016; Stiglic et al., 2020; Naghibi
    and Pourghasemi, 2015; Gardiner et al., 2020; Olden et al., 2008). Various machine
    learning models have been utilized for the assessment of groundwater potential
    zones, such as binary logistic regression (Nampak et al., 2014; Chen et al., 2018;
    Park et al., 2017; Ozdemir 2011), frequency ratio (Kim et al., 2018; Naghibi et
    al., 2015), random forest (Golkarian et al., 2018; Masroor et al., 2021; Naghibi
    et al., 2016, 2017; Rahmati et al., 2016; Sachdeva and Kumar 2021), artificial
    neural networks (Tamiru and Wagari, 2021a), weights of evidence (Al-Abadi 2015;
    Tahmassebipoor et al., 2016; Chen et al., 2018), boosted regression trees (Mondal
    et al., 2008; Naghibi et al., 2016, 2019; Prasad et al., 2020) and logistic model
    tree (Rahmati et al., 2016). Machine learning algorithms with high prediction
    accuracy can help in managing complex relationships among conditioning parameters.
    These models minimize errors and provide more accurate results than traditional
    and probabilistic methods (Pham et al., 2019; Martínez-Santos and Renard 2020;
    Arabameri, Pal, et al., 2021a). Further, the accuracy of such models can be improved
    by logically optimizing the internal parameters. This study makes an embryonic
    attempt to assess the effectiveness of machine learning algorithms and sensitivity
    of groundwater factors for groundwater potential assessment in Nainital, a hilly
    district of Uttarakhand state in India. Sensitivity analysis was carried out for
    determining most influential factor of groundwater potential. Location specific
    groundwater potential sites were identified for sustainable water resource management.
    We argue that the findings of this study would assist planners, researchers, policy
    makers and municipal corporation for better groundwater management practices.
    The methodology of the study may help the other geographical regions in identifying
    potential sites for drilling and maintaining the sustainability of groundwater.
    2. Study area The hilly district of Nainital is located in the Kumaon region of
    the north Indian state of Uttarakhand. It extends from 28° 59′ N to 29° 37′ N
    latitudes and from 78° 50ʹ E to 79° 59′ E longitudes in the foothills of the Himalayas
    (Fig. 1). It covers an area of 4251 km2 and is situated at a height of 2084 m
    above sea level. It is bordered by Udham Singh Nagar district in the south, Pauri
    Garhwal district in the west Almora district in the north, and Champawat district
    in the east. The district is home of 0.95 million people with a density of 225
    persons per km2 (Census of India, 2011). The district was formed as a consequence
    of tectonic forces and sediment upliftment between the Tibetan and Indo-Gangetic
    plains along the lower Himalayas (Jain et al., 2010). The rocks of the district
    have experienced a flurry of thrusting and folding activities leading to formation
    of a complex geological set-up. It experiences a sub-tropical to sub-humid climate.
    The temperature during summers ranges between 10.6 °C and 26.7 °C and in winters
    is usually between 2.8 °C and 15.6 °C. It receives an average annual rainfall
    of 1246 mm. The month of June has been identified as the wettest month. The district
    is dotted with many picturesque lakes helping earn the nickname of “Lake District”
    with Nainital, Bhimtal and Sattal being some of the prominent ones (Uttrakhand,
    2022). Ramganga and Kosi are the major rivers that drain the study area. Of the
    total geographical area nearly 71 percent is under forest (FRI, 2019). The district
    is divided into three physiographic zones namely Lesser Himalaya, Himalayan Foothill
    and Piedmont Alluvial tracts. The valley area has well-drained fine loamy soils.
    It is mostly made up of quartzite, slate, sandstone and limestone. Download :

    of Nainital district in India. The district is endowed with many natural water
    bodies. Nainital, Naukuchiatal, Bhimtal and Sattal are the main sources of freshwater
    (Dalakoti et al., 2018). It possessed immense potential of harnessing groundwater.
    The principal aquifer system in the Bhabar (alluvial apron of sediments) belt
    is represented by a number of granular zones. Cobbles, boulders, medium to coarse-grained
    sand, and gravels. The bhabar tract and tarai (low land region) aquifers are interlinked,
    the thickness of the clay and sand-clay strata rises near tarai belt. The depth
    of groundwater varies between 40 m and 75 m in the bhabar region. Water level
    ranges from 2 m to 6 m in shallow unconfined aquifers in the tarai region (CGWB,
    2014). 2.1. Database and methodology Rainfall, land use/land cover, lithology,
    drainage density, elevation, aspect and slope factors were chosen for examining
    the influence on groundwater potential based on literature survey and field observation

    followed for groundwater potential assessment. 2.2. Multi-collinearity test Accurate
    groundwater mapping requires careful consideration of the site-specific groundwater
    conditioning factors. Multi-collinearity analysis is carried out for removing
    interdependence of the groundwater conditioning factors (Kalantar et al., 2019).
    It implies that within a regression model one forecasting factor can be predicted
    accurately. The variance inflation factor (VIF) and tolerance (TOL) methods were
    applied to test multicollinearity of the conditioning factors. In a regression
    model, VIF and TOL are accepted measures for determining the degree of multi-collinearity
    of the nth independent variable with other variables. We examined all the selected
    factors for VIF and TOL to examine correlation among them. Multi-collinearity
    test was applied to minimize the possible chance of error in the groundwater potential
    models. Multicollinearity is a phenomenon characterized by a significant level
    of linear intercorrelation among the explanatory variables inside a multiple regression
    model, which in turn reduces the accuracy of regression analysis by minimizing
    the errors (Kim, 2019). Variance Inflation Factor (VIF) and tolerances play an
    important role in identifying the error. The VIF and tolerances were calculated
    using Eqs. (1), (2)). (1) (2) The VIF value > 10 and tolerance level <0.1, indicate
    a multi-collinearity problem (Dormann et al., 2013; Khosravi et al., 2019; Pal
    and Saha, 2017). 2.3. Machine learning algorithms 2.3.1. Multi-layer perceptron
    (MLP) Multi-layer perceptron is a subset of artificial intelligence. It is commonly
    used for classification analysis (Arabameri et al., 2021a; Fattah et al., 2021).
    It does not require any prior assumptions for determining the relative significance
    of variables using training input data. This model has an advantage over traditional
    ANN model for being efficient in analyzing huge dataset (Gardner and Dorling,
    1998). MLP functions on the basis of weighted input variables, selected during
    training of data (Das et al., 2021b; Opěla et al., 2021). Structurally, it consists
    of input, hidden and output layers. The input layer is developed on the basis
    of groundwater potential conditioning factors. Hidden layer processes the input
    variables into output layer. Groundwater potential zones (GWPZ) are generated
    as output layer. 2.3.2. M5P The M5P model is based on linear tree (Quinlan (1992)).
    It is particularly selected for forecasting of continuous variables. The model
    has been utilized for transportation of sediments and pollutants in natural rivers
    (Kargar et al., 2020), runoff forecasting (Bajirao et al., 2022), spring discharge
    forecasting (Granata et al., 2018), and river-bed transport prediction (Khosravi
    et al., 2020). It is highly accurate model among the decision tree models and
    works based on high dimensional regression analysis (Nhu et al., 2020). The model
    involves three step processes of constructing tree, pruning the tree, and smoothing
    the tree (Pham et al., 2021). Pruning of tree stage removes unusable trees, reduces
    error and excludes attributes one by one. The smoothing compensates discontinuities
    between the contiguous linear models. 2.3.3. REPTree The REPTree is a widely used
    ensemble machine learning algorithm of the reduced error pruning tree and decision
    tree (Pham et al., 2019; Shah et al., 2015). REPTree model is used for its ability
    to reduce complexity of without losing the accuracy (Nhu et al., 2020). Decision/regression
    tree is generated through pruning using back-fitting with decreased error. Reduce
    error pruning method was employed for accuracy of the decision tree model. In
    REPTree a decision tree can be pruned in two ways i.e., pre-pruning and post-pruning.
    Pre-pruning is fast and less accurate while post-pruning gives better precision
    (Fürnkranz, 1997; Yang and Fong, 2011). It is quite effective in situations involving
    classification and regression (Quinlan, 1987). This model is commonly used for
    surface runoff analysis, wind speed forecasting and hydrological system process
    analysis. 2.3.4. Random forest (RF) The random forest model utilizes a set of
    classification and regression trees (CARTs) for classifying the (Belgiu and Drăgu,
    2016; Breiman, 2001; Naghibi et al., 2016). RF with its ensemble approach yields
    better prediction (Nhu et al., 2020). Randomly picked subset of input makes decision
    tree, thereby justifying the term “random” in random forest. A subset of training
    samples is drawn for creating trees using bagging approach. During this process
    only similar samples are selected at several times. Bootstrap resampling technique
    works for assembling regression tree models of various subsets. The details of
    initialization and optimization of the machine learning algorithms is provided
    in Table 2. Table 2. Optimization of machine learning algorithms by setting model

    3. Validation of the map Various statistical methods, including receivers operating
    characteristics (ROC) curves, lift chart, precision-recall curve, and total operating
    characteristics (TOC), have been used for the validation of prediction models.
    The effectiveness of machine learning models can be examined through ROC curve
    (Song et al., 2018). The receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve is a commonly
    employed methodology for assessing the reliability as well as efficacy of deterministic
    and probabilistic models (Swets, 1988). Additionally, it is utilized to validate
    the accuracy of groundwater potential maps (Pradhan, 2013). The ROC curve is a
    graphical representation that plots the sensitivity of a model versus its 1-specificity.
    Moreover, it can be characterized as a prediction rate curve pertaining to prospective
    occurrences. The ROC excavation is notable for its utilization of the area under
    the ROC curve. The area under the ROC curve is considered the most reliable metric
    for evaluating the performance of a diagnostic test or predictive model in the
    field of statistics (Simpson and Fitter, 1973). The utilization of a test has
    been widely regarded as a conventional and comprehensive measure (Walter, 2002).
    The area under the ROC metric is a numerical value that falls within the range
    of 0–1. A higher area under the ROC indicates an improved capacity of the model
    to accurately anticipate outcomes. In the ideal scenario where the forecast is
    perfect, the area under the ROC would be equal to 1 (Ghosh et al., 2021; Miraki
    et al., 2019). Validation of the GWPZ mapping models used in this study was carried
    out by employing the ROC. In this method a comparison is made between the testing
    and training data. It is a graphical representation in which y-axis shows true
    positive percentage and x-axis represents cumulative false positive percentage
    (Namous et al., 2021). We utilized ROC curve for examining the accuracy of the
    model. 3.1. Sensitivity analysis using best fit model This method simulates the
    effect of excluding individual parameter from GWP mapping. One parameter can be
    excluded at a time, and new GWP mapping can be performed based on the remaining
    parameters using the best model. By excluding parameters one by one, new groundwater
    maps were generated. These maps were validated using testing points of best fitting
    model. The influence of groundwater parameters was examined using ROC curve. If
    the AUC is reduced by excluding specific parameter, these may considered be influential
    parameters for groundwater potential. If the AUC value of the ROC curves is higher,
    the parameter''s influence on the GWP is considered to be low. 4. Results 4.1.
    Multi-collinearity analysis Inter-dependence among the groundwater parameters
    was analyzed using multi-collinearity test. The value of VIF (>10) and TOL (<0.1)
    indicated non-collinearity among groundwater conditioning factors. Thus, all the
    parameters were utilized for preparing groundwater potential map. 4.2. Groundwater
    conditioning parameters The slope is considered a significant factor for assessing
    groundwater potential. It determines infiltration, surface runoff and ground water
    recharge. The areas having steep slopes are characterized by higher runoff, less
    infiltration and low groundwater potential (Allafta et al., 2020; Fang et al.,
    2015; Joshi and Tambe, 2010; Nunes et al., 2021; Ribolzi et al., 2011). The slope
    varied between <7° and 74.5°. Five classes of slope were distinctly identified
    i.e., nearly level (<7°), gentle (7°–17°), moderate (17°–26°), steep (26°–36°)
    and very steep (37°–74.5°). The southern part of the district lies on the slope
    that varies from near levels to gentle slopes (Fig. 3a). It represented flatlands
    and characterized with no denudation and at gentle slopes are subjected to rill
    and sheet erosion while, northern part of the district represented moderate to
    very steep slopes and were characterized by bare rocks and a strong denudation
    process. Rainfall is the most significant climatic factor and main source of groundwater
    recharge (Shekhar and Pandey 2015; Ahmed and Sajjad 2018; Biswas et al., 2020;
    Chaudhry et al., 2021). Rainfall gridded data was interpolated to prepare a rainfall
    map using kriging method. Four classes of rainfall were made viz. <989 mm (Low),
    990–1003 mm (Medium), 1004–1015 mm (High), >1015 mm (Very high) (Fig. 3b). Download

    Site-specific groundwater conditioning factors (a) Slope (b) Rainfall (c)Lithology
    (d) Lineament density (e) Drainage density (f) Soil (g) Land use/Land cover (h)
    Elevation, and (i) Aspect. Lithology regulates the groundwater recharge. The porosity
    and permeability of the rocks determine percolation and infiltration (Ahmed and
    Sajjad, 2018; Thapa et al., 2017). Data on lithology was analyzed to examine its
    role in groundwater recharge (Fig. 3c). The map reveals that nearly 66 % of the
    total area of the district was composed of silt, clay, and sand with gravels and
    pebbles and found in the plain areas of the study area. These rocks are ideal
    for groundwater recharge and their presence in plain areas increases the recharge
    rate. Another type of lithology which consists of quartzite, shale, phyllite,
    and conglomerate is mainly concentrated in the hilly region of the district, and
    covered 34 % area of the total area. The porosity of these rocks is poor. Lineament
    is one of the significant factors determining groundwater potential. Lineament
    regulates the flow of water through faults, fractures, joints, and rock cleavages
    between the surface and below it (Singhal and Gupta 2010; Ahmed and Sajjad 2018).
    The water on the surface moves down through secondary porosity (Fagbohun, 2018).
    Lineaments can be analyzed in two ways, firstly by pathways of groundwater flow
    and secondly by density of lineaments which indirectly represents groundwater
    potential. In general, lineaments depict a permeable zone and a high density indicates
    the good potential for groundwater (Saraf and Choudhury 1998; Haridas et al.,
    1998; Magesh et al., 2012; Jasrotia et al., 2013; Ghosh et al., 2016; Ghosh et
    al., 2020). Lineament density varied between <0.1 and 1 km/km2. Five classes of
    lineament density were made using natural break method (Fig. 3d). Drainage density
    shows the proximity of spacing of drainage (CARLSTON, 1966; Farooq and Akram,
    2021; Srinivasa Vittala et al., 2004). Drainage density helps in groundwater recharge
    (Fig. 3e). Higher values of drainage density indicate low groundwater potential
    (CARLSTON, 1966; Luijendijk, 2022; Moglen et al., 1998; Zagade and Umrikar, 2021).
    High prospects of groundwater potential are generally found in area having lower
    drainage density (Ajibade et al., 2021; Arunbose et al., 2021; Nag and Chakraborty,
    2003; Verma and Patel, 2021). Lower drainage density was found in the north, north-east
    and north-west parts of the district while the southern parts of the district
    were dominated in high drainage density. Water flow and holding capacity are important
    characteristics of soil (Horne and Scotter, 2016; Lowery et al., 1997). Soil permeability
    is determined by underlain structure, texture and porosity. It controls the rate
    of infiltration in an area and it increases with coarse texture of soil (Bretzel
    et al., 2020; Pierson et al., 2008). Three principal soil types were identified:
    coarse loamy soil, loamy skeletal soil, and loamy silty soil. Water retention
    and infiltration capability are higher in coarse loamy soil than in other soil
    types. Largest area of the district (48 %) covered coarse loamy soil followed
    by loamy skeletal and loamy silty soil (Fig. 3f). Changes in land use/land cover
    (LULC) have a direct impact on the occurrence and movement of groundwater in an
    area (Allafta et al., 2020). The LULC map was prepared for examining the impact
    of surface on groundwater recharge and these classes were validated with ground
    truth (Fig. 3g). Agricultural land and vegetation cover allow more infiltration
    of water due to the porous surface and vegetation (Apfelbaum et al., 2022; Francos
    et al., 2021; Yousaf et al., 2020). Built-up land affects the infiltration of
    water due to impervious surface (Etikala et al., 2019; Moniruzzaman et al., 2020;
    Shrestha et al., 2021). Thick vegetation leads to a decrease in the runoff and
    increase in groundwater potential (Das and Mukhopadhyay, 2020; Ghosh et al., 2016).
    Elevation is an important morphological factor and groundwater recharge (Bhaskar
    et al., 2018; Al-Ozeer et al., 2021; Ingraham and Matthews 1988; Souei and Zouaghi
    2021). Elevation of the study area varied between 213 and 2633 m above sea level.
    The elevation map was divided into three categories (Fig. 3d). The process of
    groundwater recharge through surface runoff is determined by the slope angle (Ahmed
    and Sajjad, 2018; Fusco et al., 2017). The geomorphologic trend is defined by
    its aspect, which is the direction of the slope. It influences on vegetation growth,
    evaporation and soil moisture (Naghibi et al., 2018b). SRTM DEM was utilized to
    prepare elevation and aspect maps (Fig. 3h & i). 4.3. Groundwater potential assessment
    using algorithms GWP map with high precision and quality works as the foundation
    tool for groundwater policy-makers and managers. The GWP map was prepared using
    the four machine learning models namely MLP, RF, M5P, and REPTree based on the
    training datasets (Fig. 4). For monitoring the effectiveness of all the models,
    we computed the standard error (SE) and the asymptotic 95 % confidence interval
    (ACI). Models with a low SE and ACI can be considered effective model. MLP had
    the lowest SE (0.0135) and ACI (0.921-0.971), followed by RF (SE-0.0139; ACI:
    0.906-0.956), M5P (SE-0.0171; ACI: 0.893-0.948), and REPTree (SE-0.0192; ACI:
    0.886-0.941). Thus, MLP was found to be the most effective model for assessing
    GWPZ. We also employed error measures to evaluate the performance of all four
    models, including root mean squared error (RMSE), relative absolute error (RAE))
    mean absolute error (MAE), correlation coefficient, and root relative squared
    error (RRSE) (Table 4). MLP outperformed other models followed by RF, M5P, and
    REPTree. Download : Download high-res image (1MB) Download : Download full-size

    the performance of the models used for GWP mapping. The AUC value of the ROC denotes
    the model''s level of performance. It ranges from 0 to 1, with 0 value suggesting
    poor performance and 1 value mean good performance (Ahmed and Sajjad, 2018; Sharma
    et al., 2022). It was used to examine each model''s training data as well as the
    validation output for groundwater potential. Highest accuracy was found for predicting
    groundwater potential for MLP (AUC-0.932) followed by RF (AUC-0.917), M5P (AUC-0.893),
    and REPTree (AUC-0.887) (Table 3 and Fig. 5). Table 3. Analysis of collinearity

    parameter for GWPZ mapping followed by elevation (0.921) and soil (0.907). Exclusion
    of drainage density has significantly reduced the accuracy level (0.739). Thus,
    it is the most sensitive parameter for GWPZ mapping followed by lineament density

    5. Discussion This study utilized RF, MLP, M5P and REPTree models for mapping
    groundwater zones in Nainital district. To qualitatively assess the outcome of
    groundwater potential maps ROC curve was employed for all models RF, MLP, M5P
    and REPTree, and all models performed well with AUC i.e., 0.917, 0.932, 0.893
    and 0.887 respectively. The results revealed MLP (AUC:0.932) best fitted model
    with highest accuracy. This benchmark model''s performance has been characterized
    as favourable (Arabameri et al., 2021b; Chen et al., 2021; Tamiru and Wagari,
    2021b), which our findings also confirm. The groundwater prediction of MLP model
    revealed largest area under high and very high groundwater potential zones. Loamy
    soil with sand, gravel, and clay, high drainage density, lower elevation, more
    area under agricultural land, and low slope have been identified as the major
    contributors to high groundwater potential in the district. The northern part
    of the district has poor groundwater potential accounting for nearly 46 % of the
    district''s area, Quartzite, shale, and conglomerate rocks, high slope, high elevation,
    and loamy skeletal soil, are the prime reasons for poor groundwater potential
    in this part of the district. The models used for prediction has some uncertainty
    factors i.e., lack of accurate information, measurement and sampling errors, etc.
    (Pradhan et al., 2021). Sensitivity analysis increases the reliability of prediction
    model. It helped in understanding the response of variables and changes in input
    variables (Bodner et al., 2020). This analysis was used to identify the most influencing
    factors for groundwater. Aspect was found least influencing factor, whereas rainfall,
    drainage density and lineament density are highly responsible for groundwater
    recharge. The results of sensitivity analysis are in tune with Pradhan et al.
    (2021). The significance of rainfall, drainage density and lineament density has
    been demonstrated by other studies in the literature. The study conducted by Nguyen
    et al. (2020), they identified land use, rainfall and slope as main factors for
    groundwater potential mapping. In the study conducted by Kordestani et al. (2019)
    found distance from rivers and lithology to be the most influencing variables.
    Arabameri et al. (2019) had showed that normalized differentiation vegetation
    index, elevation and rainfall were selected as important variables by mean decrease
    accuracy of RF. Naghibi et al. (2018a) identified altitude, topographic wetness
    index, slope, and distance from faults as significant factors in the identification
    of groundwater potential zones. All evaluation criteria showed that the MLP model
    is reliable, with an AUC accuracy of 93.2 %. The input data used for modelling
    vary from region to region. Therefore, it is important to choose the optimum predictive
    capability-based model that would help identify places with high groundwater potential
    to assist planners and policy makers. 6. Conclusion The study explored groundwater
    potential and identified influencing factors in hilly district in India. Site-specific
    topographical, hydrological, climatic and geological integrated to prepare groundwater
    potential map using machine learning algorithms. The ROC curve, mean absolute
    error (MAE), root mean squared error (RMSE), relative absolute error (RAE), root
    relative squared error (RRSE), and correlation coefficient were employed to evaluate
    the groundwater potentiality modelling. The results revealed that all models performed
    well for prediction of groundwater potential mapping. MLP model though was found
    best fit and predictive model for groundwater potential. Findings revealed marked
    variation in area under groundwater potential. Very high to high potential for
    groundwater was found in the southern part of the district. The landscape of this
    part is dominated by high drainage density and vegetation cover provide ideal
    condition for groundwater recharge. Moderate groundwater potential zones were
    found in the foothills of the Himalayas. Low to very low groundwater potential
    zones were found in the northern part of the district. The steep slopes and hard
    rocks are attributed for low groundwater recharge here. The sensitivity analysis
    of the groundwater conditioning factors revealed that all the selected factors
    have paramount influence on groundwater potential. However, in order of increasing
    influence, rainfall, drainage density, lineament density, slope, lithology and
    land use/land cover are the significant factors for groundwater potential assessment.
    The groundwater potential map prepared through MLP model in this study may help
    decision-makers, water managers, and groundwater professionals in identifying
    groundwater extraction sites not only in Himalayan region, but also in similar
    environment at various scales. CRediT authorship contribution statement Yatendra

    1. Introduction Water use efficiency (WUE) is an important indicator for coupling
    the water-carbon cycle, energy conversion, resource utilization, and global change
    (Cai et al., 2021; Hatfield and Dold, 2019; Huang et al., 2017). WUE is primarily
    concerned with the physical flow of water (Nay-Htoon et al., 2013). WUE represents
    the balance between gains (carbon acquisition or crop yield) and costs (transpiration
    and water applied) (Bchir et al., 2016). Crop WUE was used to assess the feasibility
    of agricultural water saving management schemes as a typical evaluation reference
    (Leghari et al., 2021; Liao et al., 2019; Liu and Song, 2020a). Optimizing crop
    water use by improving WUE was also a response strategy to ensure sustainable
    agricultural development in arid and semi-arid regions (Michelon et al., 2020).
    However, WUE improvement still is a challenge for agriculture in arid and semi-arid
    regions due to increasing irrigated acreage and higher water demands on crops,
    which consume about 70 % of the water available to humans (Bhattacharya, 2019;
    Jabeen et al., 2022). Disputes over water use for agriculture, industry, domestic
    use, direct human consumption, and other purposes have been increased by global
    water scarcity (Medrano et al., 2015), and these disputes will continue to spread.
    The imbalance in the spatial distribution of global water resources was accelerated
    due to climate change, frequent extreme weather events and human activities (Aoubouazza
    et al., 2013; Lang et al., 2017; Wang and Qin, 2017; Zhang et al., 2019a). With
    the aggravation of water disputes among various industries and the increasing
    imbalance in the spatial distribution of water resources, more and more studies
    focused on WUE. Higher food demand challenges caused by population growth and
    limited available water resources will lead the ultimate goal of future WUE research
    to produce more economic output with less water. Therefore, research on WUE will
    be critical to alleviating global food security, water security and ecological
    security crises. WUE was used as the subject term to search on ScienceDirect,
    and the annual number and cumulative number of WUE publications were statistically
    analyzed (Fig. S1). The results showed that: (1) over the last 10 years, the average
    number of WUE papers published per year reached 474. (2) the cumulative number
    of WUE publications in 2023 was more than 6900, a 118-fold increase compared to
    1999. The similarity analysis of high-frequency terms containing WUE in the titles
    and abstracts of the articles was conducted to obtain the clustering map of WUE
    research subject words (Fig. S2). The analysis results showed that current research
    on WUE is widely concentrated in four aspects. (1) Analysis of mainly external
    environment factors affecting WUE, including: climate change (Bagula et al., 2022;
    Nie et al., 2022; Xiao et al., 2020), soil water (Han et al., 2023; Hao et al.,
    2021; Soothar et al., 2021), evapotranspiration, crop rotation (Oroo, 2021; Sainju
    et al., 2020; Yang et al., 2021b); tillage practices (Guo et al., 2020; Lin et
    al., 2020; Wu et al., 2020), fallow management (Adil et al., 2022; Williams et
    al., 2020); irrigation scheduling or strategies (Guo et al., 2022; Heidari et
    al., 2022; Lu et al., 2022), mulching technologies (Bai et al., 2022; Duan et
    al., 2021; Yin et al., 2022), fertilizer management (Moradgholi et al., 2022;
    Yang et al., 2023; Zhai et al., 2022), water fertilizer coupling (Peng et al.,
    2023; Sun et al., 2022; Zhao et al., 2022); nutrient management (Ahmed et al.,
    2019; Akarsh et al., 2020; Ashoka and Shashadhar, 2020), biochar amendment (Fischer
    et al., 2019; Gao et al., 2020; Liu et al., 2021a). (2) How to improve crop WUE
    based on field trials (Faloye et al., 2019; Fan et al., 2020; Feng et al., 2023)
    and meta-analysis (Wu et al., 2022b; Yin et al., 2022; Yu et al., 2020). We found
    that the mechanism for increasing WUE was achieved by improving photosynthetic
    capacity to reduce respiratory consumption and decreasing leaf transpiration and
    ineffective soil evaporation. (3) The impact of drought on terrestrial ecosystems,
    croplands, or crop WUE (Pei et al., 2022; Yang et al., 2021a; Zhao et al., 2020).
    (4) WUE analysis of main crops (Jiu-jiang et al., 2022; Liu et al., 2021b), especially
    some C3 and C4 crops (De Haan et al., 2021; Israel et al., 2022; Ozeki et al.,
    2022). Therefore, the analysis of external environment factors that affect WUE
    and how to improve WUE as the research hotspots of WUE has led to most review
    articles on WUE were also concentrated on reporting the factors that affect WUE
    (Fukai and Mitchell, 2022; Liyanage et al., 2022; Zhang et al., 2023) and the
    measures to improve WUE (Eshete et al., 2020; Kang et al., 2021; Sun et al., 2020).
    In fact, all studies on WUE have to be based on the reliable accuracy of WUE estimation.
    The accurate estimating of WUE at various levels was considered as a prerequisite
    for carrying out related research on WUE. The estimation accuracy of WUE will
    affect directly WUE mapping at the regional scale. The formation of crop WUE at
    the regional scale is described through the coupling process of crop growth and
    water cycle in the whole region (Wang et al., 2023). Thus, based on the perspective
    of water cycle, regional scale crop WUE reflects the distribution and allocation
    of water resources in crops, soil, atmosphere and the whole regional system. Moreover,
    estimating crop WUE at regional scale can help crops adapt to changing environment
    better (Ito and Inatomi, 2012). Based on the perspective that WUE at different
    scales can''t be directly transferred, high WUE at leaf and whole plant scales
    doesn''t mean high WUE at the regional scale. Most importantly, point-scale WUE
    is easier to measure and estimate with reliable accuracy, while WUE estimation
    at the regional scale is more complex and requires improved reliability for accuracy
    (Jiang et al., 2022). The role of WUE estimation accuracy has not received enough
    attention at present, and there are few studies on improving WUE estimation accuracy
    using the improvement and innovation methods of estimation WUE at the regional
    scale. There was an urgent need to pay attention to the estimation accuracy of
    WUE, so the focus of this review was to locate the perspective of the estimation
    accuracy of WUE. WUE research at all levels and scales has not been well analyzed.
    Limitations of previous research include: (1) The concept and scope of application
    of WUE in various fields were often confused and poorly defined and it was necessary
    to sort out the definition and application scope of WUE at all levels/scales.
    (2) The accuracy of the current estimation methods of WUE is still a key issue.
    Traditional methods, which containing field measurement and crop model simulation
    method, are still widely used to estimate WUE at a point scale, and there is a
    lack of improvement and expansion of new methods to estimate WUE at the regional
    scale. (3) The method of estimating WUE by remote sensing is still lacking mechanistic
    explanations. (4) At present, most of the studies focused on estimating crop yield
    by using data assimilation techniques to couple remote sensing and crop model,
    but few studies using data assimilation method to estimate WUE. The applicability
    of the data assimilation method still needs to be verified through extensive tests
    though it improved the estimation accuracy of WUE. Overall, there were still gaps
    in the estimation methods of WUE at various levels and scales, especially in improving
    the estimation accuracy of WUE at the regional scale. The objectives of our review
    were to (1) clarify the concept of WUE at different levels and scales to provide
    guidance for selecting WUE indicators in the evaluation area, (2) compare the
    advantages, disadvantages, and application scope of various WUE estimation methods,
    including the field measurement, crop model simulation, remote sensing estimation,
    and the data assimilation coupling remote sensing and crop model, and (3) suggest
    a basis for the estimation methods of WUE in the future. 2. Concept and evaluation
    indicators of water use efficiency 2.1. Concept of water use efficiency WUE is
    an important indicator for monitoring and evaluating agricultural water use (Hirwa
    et al., 2022). When researchers conducted a systematic evaluation of water use
    and decision-making of irrigation systems, various meanings of WUE were formed
    due to different research perspectives and concerns. Vites first used the term
    WUE to represent the ratio of crop yield to evaporation in 1965 (Vites, 1965)
    and it has been widely used to express the yield of a crop per unit of water (Heydari,
    2014). As research continues to develop, WUE can be defined as the ratio of crop
    biomass accumulation (CO2 assimilation/crop biomass/grain yield) to consumed water
    (transpiration/evapotranspiration/total water input, during the full growing season)
    (Kang et al., 2002; Sinclair et al., 1984). WUE considers the efficiency of engineering
    infrastructure design and is more focused on the relation between a unit of crop
    yield and water (Blatchford et al., 2019). WUE is designed to monitor the efficiency
    of water supply to cropland and the rate at which crops convert water into products,
    respectively (Kilemo, 2022). 2.2. The evaluation indicators of WUE WUE evaluation
    indicators include three levels of crop production, including leaf level (leaf
    photosynthesis rate per transpiration rate, WUEL), whole plant level (the ratio
    of total dry mass to water use, WUEp), and yield level (crop grain per unit area
    to transpiration, WUEy) (Ali and Talukder, 2008; Boutraa, 2010; Hong-Xing et al.,
    2007). Taking farmland as an example, the scale information and formula of WUE
    at different levels from leaf to yield level were shown in Fig. 1. The initial
    studies define WUE at leaf level (WUEL) in the 1960s (Bierhuizen and Slatyer,
    1965), and they were regarded as the basis of WUE at the whole plant (WUEp) and
    yield level (WUEy). WUEL is the exchange rate of water vapor and CO2 between the
    atmosphere and leaves (Gago et al., 2014). WUEL was also known as leaf transpiration
    efficiency (Farquhar et al., 1989). WUEp is the ratio between accumulated biomass
    and transpiration water during a given period (Bogeat-Triboulot et al., 2019;
    Gulías et al., 2012). WUEp depends on the total carbon capture and water loss
    of all crops, including water loss and respiration from the photosynthetic and
    non-photosynthetic parts (Cernusak et al., 2007). That means WUEp could represent
    WUE on a larger temporal and spatial scale (Flexas et al., 2010). WUEy is the
    relationship between the output of the crop yield and the amount of water input
    required (Tuong et al., 2000). WUEy is closest to the actual production and is
    regarded as the final result of WUEL and WUEp (Angus and Van Herwaarden, 2001;
    Fang et al., 2004). Higher WUE at the leaf scale, but not necessarily high WUE
    at the whole plant scale and yield scale (Kang et al., 2021). Therefore, WUE at
    different scales could not be directly scale transferred. Download : Download

    levels from leaf to yield level (take farmland for example). Note: these formulas
    in Fig. 1 were derived from literature review. (Boegelein et al., 2012; Hoover
    et al., 2023; Jiang et al., 2019; Zhang et al., 2019b). According to the types
    of water input required, WUEy was evaluated with five evaluation coefficients,
    including rain-fed water productivity (RWP), generalized water use efficiency
    (GWP), crop water productivity (CWP), irrigation water use efficiency (WUEy-i),
    and irrigation water productivity (IWP). RWP was not suitable for arid and semi-arid
    regions as it only considered the impact of precipitation on crop yield. Due to
    the difficulty in obtaining field evapotranspiration data and the uncertainty
    of the accuracy of each evapotranspiration estimation model, CWP had limited its
    application in large-scale WUE evaluation. IWP represented the role of irrigation
    on crop yield and was not applied to areas with sufficient precipitation. GWP
    integrated the combined effects of precipitation and irrigation on crop yield,
    providing a better reflection on the relationship between crop yield and water
    consumption, and has a wider range of practical application. 3. Estimation method
    of water use efficiency In this chapter, the estimation methods of WUE based on
    three levels of leaf, whole plant and yield, and two spatial scales of single
    point and region were proposed. WUE estimation methods at yield level mainly considered
    the index of crop water use efficiency. Although the type of water consumed was
    different, several other indicators also have a lot in common in the yield estimation
    module. 3.1. Field measurement estimation Field measurement methods of WUE included
    direct measurement, gas exchange measurement, stable isotope technology, pot weighting
    method, and eddy correlation technology, comparison of these methods was illustrated
    in Table 1. WUE at the field scale could be obtained directly through the experimental
    observation data of field water consumption and crop yield, expressed by how many
    grams of dry matter are produced per kilogram of water. Field water consumption
    is generally calculated by coupling field energy balance and water balance. Compared
    with other methods, the gas exchange method had the smallest application range
    and was only suitable for the leaf scale. The sensitivity and accuracy of stable
    isotope technology were high, and dual-isotope calibration was used to determine
    not only crop WUE, but also water source and water use patterns. The pot weighting
    method had the narrowest limited conditions and was only applicable to potted
    plants. The eddy correlation technology was able to measure WUE at larger scales
    in all field measurement methods. Table 1. Summary and comparison of field measurement
    methods for measuring WUE at different levels and scales. (see reference in table
    Cheng et al., 2021b; Ebmeyer and Hoffmann, 2022; Liu et al., 2019; Li et al.,
    2020; Pan et al., 2022; Santos et al., 2021; Liu et al., 2020; Munjonji and Ayisi,
    2021; Sanz‐Saez et al., 2019; Al Tamimi et al., 2022; Alataway et al., 2019; Zheng
    et al., 2020; Baldocchi et al., 2021; Jiang et al., 2020; Lavergne et al., 2019).
    Although the field measurement method theoretically determines the effects of
    WUE on dry matter production more accurately than crop model simulation, it is
    difficult to determine the spatial heterogeneity of WUE at the macroscale (Liu
    and Song, 2020). It requires a lot of detailed and complicated work for WUEp and
    WUEy to estimate the consumed water and biomass by all plants. In addition, the
    field measurement method requires destructive sampling, long time consumption,
    low efficiency, small coverage, and unable to carry out continuous observation.
    Therefore, direct measurement of WUE at the whole plant and yield level by field
    measurement method remain certain difficulties and larger random errors. 3.2.
    Crop model simulation method Crop models can simulate crop water consumption.
    The popular used models include AquaCrop (Pohankova et al., 2018), CROPWAT (Luo
    et al., 2015), PolyCrop model (Tan and Zheng, 2017), DSSAT (Jones et al., 2003),
    WOFOST (Van Diepen et al., 1989), APSIM (Holzworth et al., 2014), RZWQM2 (Ahuja
    et al., 2000), WHCNS (Liang et al., 2014) and others. Driven by meteorological
    data, crop models integrate soil parameters, genotype parameters and field management
    measurements to simulate crop water consumption and yield to obtain WUE at a single-point
    scale. Crop models simulate WUE at various levels by setting different climate
    scenarios (Bagula et al., 2022; Deihimfard et al., 2018; Han et al., 2021), adopting
    various crop varieties (Seyoum et al., 2018; Wang et al., 2019; Xiao et al., 2020),
    changing soil physical and chemical properties (Yang et al., 2019, 2020; Zhang
    et al., 2022), and adjusting management measures (Nie et al., 2022; Rani et al.,
    2020; Xu et al., 2020). Compared with the field measurement method, crop models
    require a large number of climate, crop, soil, and management parameters, but
    reduce the cost, manpower, material resources, and frequency of operation. The
    spatial variation of soil chemical properties, meteorological conditions, and
    canopy state variables should be considered in the crop models to avoid the uncertainty
    of crops growth process simulation on the WUE estimation at regional scales. Although
    crop models can be scaled up with the GIS technique and the application range
    of models can be expanded, the accuracy of crop models with regionalized genetic
    parameters in simulating regional scale WUE is still limited. Therefore, due to
    the lack of spatial information and the difficulty in obtaining various input
    parameters required to start the simulation (Kasampalis et al., 2018), crop models
    only can simulate the water use efficiency at the single point scale, but not
    well at the regional scale. 3.3. Remote sensing estimation method 3.3.1. Based
    on remote sensing GPP and ET products WUE estimation of croplands ecosystem is
    directly obtained by the ratio of gross primary productivity (GPP) to evapotranspiration
    (ET) (Cheng et al., 2021a; Nandy et al., 2022; Sun et al., 2023). Many studies
    analyzed the WUE of crops with GPP and ET, such as wheat-maize rotation in the
    North China Plain (Hu and Lei, 2021), rice in southern India (Oo et al., 2023),
    soybean in the USA (Chen et al., 2022). Due to the limited number and uneven distribution
    of flux towers (Jung et al., 2020), it was difficult to directly obtain croplands
    ecosystem WUE by using continuous and precise GPP and ET data from flux towers.
    Remote sensing-based GPP and ET products provide a new approach for estimating
    croplands ecosystem WUE. The major global remote sensing-based GPP products used
    for evaluating croplands ecosystem WUE were shown in Fig. 2. The results showed
    that: (1) During the period 1982–2023, the main remote sensing-based GPP products
    were classified into three types: light utilization efficiency (LUE), machine
    learning algorithms (ML), and process-based land surface model (LSM). (2) Most
    GPP products have a temporal resolution of 8-day and monthly, and a spatial resolution
    of more than 500 m. The spatial and temporal resolution of LSM type was more refined.
    (3) The earliest and longest time series remote sensing-based GPP products were
    ML and a small number of LSM types, that were, obsGPP (1982–2008, 27 years) and
    GLASS (1982–2017, 36 years) products. All GPP products of LUE type and most of
    LSM types appeared after 2000. (4) According to the number of citations, obsGPP
    was the most widely used remote sensing-based GPP products, followed by GLASS,
    BESS, VPM and PML-V2. (5) PML-V2, MOD17A2H and GOSIF products were updated faster,
    especially the MOD17A2H product has been updated until 2023. Download : Download

    the color, the more times the product has been cited). The major global remote
    sensing-based ET products used for evaluating croplands ecosystem WUE were shown
    in Fig. 3. The results showed that: (1) The water balance model (WB), process-based
    land surface model (LSM), Priestley-Taylor (PT), machine learning (ML), and Peman-Monteith
    equation combined with vegetation data (PM) were the major types of remote sensing-based
    ET products over the period 1958–2023. (2) Most ET products have a temporal resolution
    of 8-day and monthly, and a spatial resolution of more than 500 m. (3) The earliest
    remote sensing-based ET products were WB type than other types, that was, Terra
    Climate products, with the longest time series from 1958 to 2020 (63 years). PT
    and ML appeared after 1982, while LSM and PM appeared at the latest after 2000.
    (4) According to the number of citations, GLDAS was the most widely used remote
    sensing-based ET products, followed by MTE, MOD16A2, Terra Climate and GLEAM products.
    (5) GLDAS and MOD16A2 products have been updated the fastest, reaching 2023, followed
    by Terra Climate, GLEAM v3, GLASS v4.0 and PML-V2 products. Download : Download

    bar chart), contributor (references section) and the number of citations for each
    product (right circular Venault chart, the larger the area and the darker the
    color, the more times the product has been cited). Many existing GPP and ET products
    could not meet the requirements of high spatio-temporal resolution and long time
    series at the same time, and the use of different products varies greatly. The
    few flux tower data were used to verify GPP and ET products, this will affect
    the accuracy of WUE estimation. In addition, due to the complexity of the croplands
    ecosystem, a single GPP and ET product could not well represent the carbon-water
    relationship of all systems. Therefore, it is necessary to construct GPP and ET
    combination datasets, screen suitable GPP and ET products, strictly distinguish
    and refine vegetation types, and estimate ecosystem WUE under different vegetation
    types. 3.3.2. Based on remote sensing ET estimation model and yield estimation
    model Crop WUE can be estimated indirectly at the regional scale by the synergistic
    effects of the remote sensing-based crop distribution recognition model, remote
    sensing-based ET model and yield estimation model (Jiang et al., 2022). Accurate
    identification of crop types is an important prerequisite for WUE estimation.
    The working principle of the remote sensing crop distribution recognition model
    is to analyze spectral information, vegetation index and texture characteristics
    from time-series remote sensing data and images, track the evolution of crop reflection
    characteristics during growth, extract distinct time features for various crops,
    and classify them by classification model to distinguish crop types (Gumma et
    al., 2022; Sun et al., 2019). The current mainstream remote sensing crop distribution
    recognition models based on different classification methods were shown in Fig.
    4. Each classification method has its own advantages, limitations and application
    scope. Therefore, comprehensive consideration of multiple classification methods
    for crop type identification can achieve better accuracy results. Download : Download

    crop distribution recognition models for different classification methods. After
    constructing the remote sensing crop distribution recognition model, crop WUE
    at the regional scale can be estimated through the remote sensing ET and yield
    estimation model (as shown in Fig. 5). The temperature-based ET models are simpler,
    but the limitations are in producing spatiotemporal continuum ET fields under
    variable cloud conditions. The conduction-based ET models may be more accurate
    in the future, but these models rely heavily on satellite precipitation and soil
    moisture data that are least accurate when vegetation is dense) (Chen and Liu,
    2020). Download : Download high-res image (1MB) Download : Download full-size
    image Fig. 5. Organization diagram of crop WUE estimated by remote sensing method.
    Note: Remote sensing evapotranspiration model was adapted form Chen and Liu (2020).
    The remote sensing yield estimation models have been developed from the original
    data-driven model (empirical statistical model and light use efficiency model)
    to the process-driven model (crop model, considering the mechanism of crop growth
    and development), and even to the multi-process-driven model (coupling model).
    The coupling model can be obtained by the integration of the radiation transport
    model, hydrological land surface model, light energy utilization rate model, crop
    model and other process-driven models. Due to the limitations of various models
    and the complexity of crop yield formation processes, the coupling model will
    perform better because it considers more comprehensive yield estimation processes.
    The combined effects of the remote sensing crop distribution recognition model,
    remote sensing ET and yield estimation model provided an effective way for the
    estimation and quantitative evaluation of crop WUE at the regional scale. Jiang
    et al. (2022) used MODIS normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) index to
    extract phenological characteristics, established maize recognition model based
    on pixel classification method in Hetao irrigation district, and adopted the hybrid
    dual-source scheme and trapezoid framework-based ET (HTEM) estimation model and
    the Stewart water production function for yield estimation to evaluate maize WUE
    in three counties of Hetao irrigation district. Jin et al. (2018a) extracted phenological
    parameters based on MODIS NDVI index, combined with support vector machine (SVM)
    algorithm to classify winter wheat in the Loess Plateau, estimated regional ET
    based on the improved Priestley-Taylor method, and used light use efficiency model
    (LUE) to estimate winter wheat yield and quantify the synergistic relationship
    among winter wheat yield, ET and WUE. Compared with the field measurement method,
    remote sensing estimation of WUE saved a lot of manpower and material resources
    and was more efficient and faster. In contrast to crop model simulation for WUE
    estimation at the site scale, the method of using remote sensing to estimate WUE
    expanded the spatial scale to regional and local scales. However, the uncertainty
    of remote sensing ET and yield estimation results also influences the accuracy
    of WUE estimation. The biggest source of such uncertainty was the measurement
    error of remote sensing data, and reducing this uncertainty was the key to improving
    the estimation accuracy of WUE. 3.4. Remote sensing and crop model data assimilation
    method In order to make up for the limitation of using remote sensing technology
    or crop model alone to estimate WUE, many studies used the data assimilation method
    to combine the advantages of remote sensing and crop models for estimating WUE
    (Li et al., 2023; Wang et al., 2022; Wu et al., 2022a). The schematic process
    of data assimilation between remote sensing and crop model was shown in Fig. 6.
    Download : Download high-res image (1MB) Download : Download full-size image Fig.
    6. Schematic representation of WUE estimated by using data assimilation between
    remote sensing and crop model. The data assimilation system for estimating regional
    scale WUE constructed in Fig. 6 consisted of remote sensing observation, dynamic
    crop model and data assimilation method, the specific implementation process was
    shown as follows: (1) First, remote sensing observations (or inversions) parameters
    were obtained. Regional monitoring and sampling of cropland systems were conducted
    through satellite and UAV remote sensing to obtain regional remote sensing crop
    canopy and land surface observations (or inversion) parameter information. Such
    as leaf area index (LAI), soil moisture (SM), evapotranspiration (ET), land surface
    temperature (LST), biomass (BM), leaf nitrogen accumulation (LAN), the dry weight
    of roots (WRT), vegetation index (VIs, such as enhanced vegetation index (EVI),
    normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), vegetation temperature condition
    index (VTCI), etc.), gross primary productivity (GPP), reflectivity (λ), canopy
    cover (CC), the green leaf area index (GLAI), plant height (PH), crop phenology
    (PHE) and other parameters. (2) Second, the simulated values of the state variables
    were obtained. The input variable data required by the crop model was prepared,
    including weather, soil, crop genetic parameters and field management data, and
    the crop model was calibrated and verified with the field observation data. Corresponding
    to the parameter information of remote sensing observation (or inversion), crop
    model can also obtain these parameter information through simulation, and they
    were all called state variables, which were the key to integrating remote sensing
    and crop models to estimate yield, ET and crop WUE. (3) Then, the remote sensing
    observations (or inversions) were integrated into the crop model by data assimilation
    methods, such as the forcing method, parameter calibration method or updating
    method. Through spatial interpolation of input data and single point assimilation,
    the crop model was operated to obtain simulated values of state variables. Based
    on the continuous data assimilation process between remote sensing observations
    and crop model, the state variables were updated and the crop parameters were
    optimized. Crop model outputted the simulation results of yield, ET and WUE at
    the single point. (4) Finally, grid by grid assimilation was used to estimate
    crop yield, ET and WUE at the regional scale, and the assimilation accuracy was
    verified with official statistics. Data assimilation methods between remote sensing
    and crop model were mainly composed of the forcing method, calibration method
    and updating method (Wang et al., 2013). Based on the assumption that the remote
    sensing observations were true values and more accurate than simulated values,
    the forcing method argued that remote sensing can provide higher accuracy for
    state variables and obtain better estimation results (Jin et al., 2018b). Thus,
    the forcing method directly replaced or adjusted remote sensing data with crop
    model simulate variables (Kasampalis et al., 2018). Clevers et al. (2002) continuously
    forced LAI values of winter wheat obtained from SPOT data and CLAIR semi-empirical
    model into ROTASK crop model to estimate more accurate yield and LAI and better
    described this method. The calibration method was to adjust the initial values
    and parameters of the crop model to minimize the cost function of the distance
    between the remote sensing observation and the model-simulated state variables,
    and makes the simulation closer to the observations by running a recalibrated
    set of new parameters or initial values (Wagner et al., 2020). By iteratively
    adjusting the initial value of the model parameters or the state variables, the
    cost function was finally minimized and the optimal parameters were obtained (Huang
    et al., 2015). Root mean square error, least squares, three (or four)-dimensional
    variational and optimization algorithm can be used to construct cost functions.
    The updating method was a method that constantly updated crop model simulation
    data by changing the posterior distribution values of state variables according
    to remote sensing observations when remote sensing data acquisition was feasible
    (Dorigo et al., 2007). The process of the updating method was to assimilate the
    state variables obtained from remote sensing observation and model simulation
    into the continuously running mode, and the above processes were repeated when
    a new observation state variable was encountered (Zhao et al., 2013). The estimated
    value of the state variable updated at the current time was used as the initial
    value of the model simulation at the next time (Huang et al., 2019). A comparison
    of the forcing method, calibration method, and updating methods were illustrated
    in Table 2. Table 2. Comparison of the forcing method, calibration method and
    updating method, with the summary of corresponding publications, focusing on the
    technical aspects. (see reference in table Bouman, 1995; Clevers et al., 2002;
    Delecolle and Guerif, 1988; Hadria et al., 2006; Maas, 1988; Fang et al., 2008;
    Jin et al., 2015; Machwitz et al., 2014; Chakrabarti et al., 2014; Hadria et al.,
    2006; Ines et al., 2013; Pellenq and Boulet, 2004). The data assimilation technology
    helped crop models retain the advantages of mechanism, expanded the estimation
    of the model at the regional scale, and reduced the operation cost by using a
    large amount of remote sensing crop canopy and land surface spatial variation
    information. In data assimilation processing, the input variables (from remote
    sensing data sets), state variables (the most critical variable, from the complete
    crop model system), model parameters (describing the relationship between observed
    variables and state variables) and output variables (crop yield, WUE, etc.) should
    be distinguished first (Delécolle et al., 1992). The most commonly used assimilation
    variable is LAI, and the double assimilation variable has higher estimation accuracy
    than the single assimilation variable. The data assimilation can integrate canopy
    state variables with various spatial and temporal information from remote sensing
    data to optimize crop parameters in crop models (Jin et al., 2018). 4. Discussion
    4.1. Comparison of accuracy of various methods for estimating WUE This review
    summarized the advantages, disadvantages and scope of application of the field
    measurement method, crop model simulation method, remote sensing estimation method,
    and coupling method with remote sensing and crop model by data assimilation for
    estimating WUE. The field measurement method was simple and accurate, but had
    a heavy workload and large random errors. The limited number of global flux towers
    resulted in the inability of eddy covariance techniques to measure WUE at continuous
    regional scales. Due to the lack of spatial information and the difficulty in
    obtaining various input parameters required to run crop models, crop models can
    only simulate WUE at a single point scale, but not well at the regional scale.
    There were few flux tower data for accuracy verification of remote sensing-based
    GPP and ET products, which would affect the accuracy of croplands ecosystem WUE
    estimation. Remote sensing crop distribution recognition model, remote sensing
    ET and yield estimation model provided an effective way for the estimation of
    WUE at the regional scale, and expanded the spatial scale to regional and local
    scales. However, the poor mechanistic performance of the remote sensing water
    consumption and yield estimation model resulted in low estimation interpretability
    of WUE. Using data assimilation to estimate WUE at the regional scale, combined
    a mass of remote sensing continuous spatial crop parameters with the crop model
    to simulate the dynamic growth process of the crop, and had stronger mechanistic
    interpretation. Theoretically, compared with crop model simulation method and
    remote sensing estimation method, the method based on data assimilation method
    combined with remote sensing and crop model had the highest accuracy in estimating
    regional scale WUE, because it combined the advantages of crop model and remote
    sensing technology. Luo et al. (2023) reviewed a large number of research results
    on improving the simulation ability of crop models by using data assimilation
    methods, and found that taking yield as an example, the R2 range of yield estimation
    accuracy after data assimilation was significantly improved to 0.35 ∼ 0.82 (R2
    range of single crop model simulation was 0.01 ∼ 0.471). Therefore, since the
    simulation ability of the model has been improved after data assimilation, the
    simulation accuracy of other crop indicators such as WUE, ET, LAI and other indicators
    should also be improved in addition to yield indicators. Taking the study of Wang
    et al. (2024) as an example, based on Sentinel-2 remote sensing data, CERES-Maize
    model and SCE-UA optimization, this study estimated maize WUE in Fenwei plain
    of China under the data assimilation strategy and the non-assimilation strategy
    respectively. The results showed that the accuracy of WUE simulated by data assimilation
    strategy was higher and the error was lower (Fig. 7). Therefore, the data assimilation
    method combined with remote sensing and crop model had higher accuracy in estimating
    regional scale WUE than crop model simulation and remote sensing estimation method.

    data assimilation. Note: RMSE, ARE and Bias were root mean square error, average
    relative error and bias, respectively, and the data in the figure came from Wang
    et al. (2024). 4.2. Limitations in current WUE estimation research At present,
    WUE estimation at the regional scale is based on remote sensing technology, satellite
    remote sensing platform is commonly used but the UAV platform is rarely used,
    which cannot meet the needs of fine farmland scale. Satellite images reflect the
    instantaneous conditions of the land surface or crop canopy on the day of transit
    and are easily affected by the launch of the satellite, the transit time interval,
    and the cloud cover during the transit. Thus, satellite remote sensing technology
    is limited by low spatial and temporal resolution and is easy to be interfered
    with meteorological factors. It is difficult to meet the requirements of repeated
    field scale crop observation. However, UAVs have higher image resolution and are
    less susceptible to clouds. Therefore, satellite remote sensing or UAV platform
    should be selected according to the size of the plot. Satellite remote sensing
    is more suitable for large regional scale above hectare area, while UAV remote
    sensing is more suitable for field scale. Recently, ET separation methods based
    on multi-scale and multi-concept WUE have been established. However, the assumptions
    of different methods make them have obvious limitations in application. An ET
    separation method that can make up for the general limitations and has a wide
    application prospect needs to be developed. At present, there is a lack of relevant
    research to evaluate or compare the uncertainties of different methods, especially
    in terms of limitations. The current studies lack new methods to estimate WUE
    at the regional scale. The role of WUE estimation accuracy was underestimated
    at present. Remote sensing technology is used to estimate WUE at the regional
    scale, which overcomes the shortcomings of traditional methods, but mechanistic
    explanations are not sufficient. At present, most of the studies using data assimilation
    techniques to couple remote sensing and crop models focused on estimating crop
    yield. However, few studies apply this method to estimate crop WUE at regional
    scale. Theoretically, the method of coupling remote sensing and crop model to
    estimate WUE using data assimilation technology can improve the estimation accuracy
    of WUE at the regional scale, but it still needs to be clarified by a large number
    of studies. 5. Future opportunities and challenges With the development of remote
    sensing technology, various kinds of satellite sensors such as optical, thermal
    infrared, and microwave can obtain multi-source remote sensing data of multi-temporal,
    spectral, sensor, platform, and resolution in the same region. Multi-source remote
    sensing data fusion expands the spatial and temporal scale of data. Improving
    the spatial resolution or temporal resolution of multi-source data are two main
    ways of multi-source data fusion. Using NOAA/AVHRR data with low spatial resolution
    and Landsat-TM with the medium spatial resolution to extract rice planting area
    by data fusion, the accuracy was greatly improved (Fang et al., 2008). The multi-source
    remote sensing data fusion can obtain richer and more accurate information, improve
    the accuracy of remote sensing information analysis and extraction, and thus improve
    the accuracy and stability of crop growth monitoring. Multi-source remote sensing
    data fusion is necessary for the estimation of crop yield and WUE at the regional
    scale, so as to ensure food security in precision agriculture. Multi-source remote
    sensing data should be obtained through the data fusion algorithm in the future,
    and then the application research of crop yield and WUE estimation based on the
    data assimilation to couple multi-source remote sensing data and crop growth models
    could be carried out. The UAV would be a popular platform for predicting crop
    WUE on a regional scale in the future due to its portability. The combination
    of remote sensing and crop model with data assimilation technology can effectively
    combine their advantages to improve the simulation and prediction ability of crop
    growth, yield formation and water consumption process at the regional scale. And
    the development of physicochemical and quantitative refinement of stress monitoring
    in crop growth, yield, and water consumption prediction can be promoted. Crop
    model has uncertainty, which comes from the model structure, parameters, and the
    input data (Wallach and Thorburn, 2017). Considering all the major sources of
    uncertainty, improving the estimation of crop model uncertainty to reduce uncertainty
    in order to improve the estimation accuracy of WUE is a future challenge. It is
    predicted that the integrated average simulation using multiple crop models will
    be an important means to reduce the uncertainty of crop models and improve the
    WUE accuracy of model simulation (Boote, 2020). At present, the debugging of crop
    models still requires a large number of measured parameters for calibration, which
    increases the cost of parameter acquisition and model operation. The relevant
    departments should provide the measured data of corresponding sites as much as
    possible. Future research should optimize the parameter calibration process and
    parameter auto-adjustment efficiency of crop models. The sensitivity analysis
    method can be coupled with the crop model automatic parameter adjustmentprogram
    to determine the sensitive parameters to crop yield, assimilation variables and
    WUE, and run the model with these parameters can improve the simulation ability
    of the model. At the same time, crop rotation should be considered in the model
    simulation of WUE. It is important to improve the assimilation accuracy and efficiency
    by optimizing crop model with less uncertainty and optimizing assimilation algorithms.
    In the future, assimilation of multiple state variables such as LAI, ET, SM, FAPAR,
    GPP, and nitrogen would be carried out to improve the simulation results and estimation
    accuracy of data assimilation WUE of remote sensing and crop models. Assimilating
    different key state variables in the corresponding stages according to different
    growth periods of crops also helps to improve assimilation accuracy. Future research
    also could improve and perfect the assimilation algorithm, increase its running
    speed, and increase the practicability of assimilation models. Integrating multi-source
    remote sensing data, ensemble using multi-crop models, innovating near-real-time
    seamless efficient data assimilation algorithms at regional scale, and refining
    multi-variables assimilation at different crop growth stages would be the research
    hotspots in the future. Due to the lack of crop-specific temporal and spatial
    information of WUE, it is difficult to understand the root cause of WUE variation
    and develop scientific strategies for crop irrigation optimization. There is an
    urgent need to incorporate crop types and irrigation allocations into high spatial
    resolution crop-specific WUE modeling to develop efficient water use strategies
    for sustainable agroecosystem management. 6. Conclusions This paper reviewed the
    research status, research hotspots, various concepts and estimation methods of
    WUE at different scales, research limitations of WUE, future opportunities and
    challenges. The concept and application scope of WUE at different levels and scales
    were sorted out. WUE at different scales could not be directly scale transferred.
    The advantages, disadvantages and applicability scope of various current WUE estimation
    methods were compared. Remote sensing method for estimation WUE overcame the shortcomings
    of field measurement and crop model simulation. Using data assimilation to couple
    remote sensing and crop model for estimating WUE at regional scale, and combining
    a mass of remote sensing continuous spatial crop parameters with crop model, it
    has a stronger mechanistic interpretation. However, improving WUE estimation accuracy
    through enhanced data assimilation efficiency remains a difficult problem. Future
    opportunities and challenges for WUE estimation methods were provided. It is predicted
    that optimized data assimilation between multi-source remote sensing fusion, UAV
    and crop model would be an effective method for future large-scale WUE estimation.
    However, reducing uncertainty in crop models and improving assimilation algorithms
    to achieve higher assimilation accuracy and efficiency are still the focus of
    future studies. Urgently incorporating crop types and irrigation allocations into
    high resolution, crop-specific WUE modeling is essential for developing efficient
    water use strategies. Integrating multi-source remote sensing data, ensemble using
    multi-crop models, innovating near-real-time seamless efficient data assimilation
    algorithms at regional scale, and refining multi-variables assimilation at different
    crop growth stages are the future hotspots. CRediT authorship contribution statement

  description: Effective support for agricultural production-management strategies
    relies on the accurate monitoring of crop growth and grain yield estimation at
    the field scale, making it an urgent need for the development of precision agriculture.
    Crop models are capable of simulating the growth and development of crops. In
    addition, Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) provides high temporal and spatial resolution
    for remote sensing, which can quickly and accurately obtain the crop growth status
    of small and medium-sized areas. This research utilized multispectral remote sensing
    information collected via UAV, alongside the WOFOST (World Food Studies) model,
    to evaluate the growth of summer maize within the experimental site. By utilizing
    vegetation indices derived from the UAV remote sensing data, the LAI (Leaf Area
    Index) of summer maize was ascertained, which further revealed a robust correlation
    between LAI and NDVI (Normalized Difference Vegetation Index). The model parameters
    were calibrated using crop and soil data from the Irrigation Experiment Station
    of Northwest A&F University. Verification indices revealed good consistency with
    a normalized root mean square error (nRMSE) of around 25 %, indicating that the
    model was suitable for simulating summer maize growth in this region. The ensemble
    Kalman filter algorithm was utilized to assimilate the remote sensing observation
    data with the WOFOST model, and the results showed that assimilation improved
    the accuracy of the yield simulation for each treatment. The optimal assimilation
    frequency should be more than three times, and assimilation during the flowering
    and grain-filling stages of summer maize could obtain better yield simulation
    results. By assimilating remote sensing observation data with 33 years of historical
    meteorological data from the Yangling Meteorological Station using the ensemble
    Kalman filter algorithm, this study predicted the yield and obtained a relative
    error of less than 5 %. The predicted yield value obtained on September 6 was
    more accurate than the predicted yield obtained at other times.

    LAI using UAV multispectral data. • Assimilation of remote sense data with WOFOST
    model using EnKF algorithm. • More than three assimilations resulted in better

    maize within the experimental site. By utilizing vegetation indices derived from
    the UAV remote sensing data, the LAI (Leaf Area Index) of summer maize was ascertained,
    which further revealed a robust correlation between LAI and NDVI (Normalized Difference
    Vegetation Index). The model parameters were calibrated using crop and soil data
    from the Irrigation Experiment Station of Northwest A&F University. Verification
    indices revealed good consistency with a normalized root mean square error (nRMSE)
    of around 25 %, indicating that the model was suitable for simulating summer maize
    growth in this region. The ensemble Kalman filter algorithm was utilized to assimilate
    the remote sensing observation data with the WOFOST model, and the results showed
    that assimilation improved the accuracy of the yield simulation for each treatment.
    The optimal assimilation frequency should be more than three times, and assimilation
    during the flowering and grain-filling stages of summer maize could obtain better
    yield simulation results. By assimilating remote sensing observation data with
    33 years of historical meteorological data from the Yangling Meteorological Station
    using the ensemble Kalman filter algorithm, this study predicted the yield and
    obtained a relative error of less than 5 %. The predicted yield value obtained
    on September 6 was more accurate than the predicted yield obtained at other times.

    growth and yield monitoring are crucial considerations for effective agricultural
    management. Social and environmental factors, such as population growth, the decrease
    in arable land, water scarcity, and extreme weather, can significantly impact
    agricultural production and jeopardize food security (Ge et al., 2022, Huang et
    al., 2019). Hence, it is essential to monitor crop growth accurately and estimate
    grain yield in a region to develop effective food policies and promote precision
    agriculture (Jin et al., 2018, Dhakar et al., 2022). In the field of agriculture,
    there are multiple methods available for yield estimation, and the selection of
    these methods depends on the crop type under study, available data and resources,
    and the required estimation accuracy. Common yield estimation methods include
    field-based experimental yield estimation, remote sensing-based yield estimation,
    and crop growth model-based yield estimation (Luo et al., 2023). Field experiments
    are arduous and time-intensive endeavors for yield estimation, presenting challenges
    in obtaining real-time crop yield data. Crop growth models, grounded in physiological
    processes, offer a viable alternative, capable of accurately simulating crop development
    and yield across the growing season through intrinsic physical processes and kinetic
    mechanisms. However, when these models are employed for regional yield estimation,
    they encounter limitations stemming from the spatial heterogeneity of soil properties,
    crop parameters, and meteorological conditions. This heterogeneity complicates
    the acquisition of macroscopic information and the regionalization of model parameters
    (Luo et al., 2023). Remote sensing technology utilizes satellite or UAV images
    to acquire farmland information. By analyzing parameters such as vegetation indices
    and LAI from the images, the health and growth status of vegetation can be inferred,
    enabling yield estimation (Wu et al., 2023). With the progress and development
    of modern information science and technology, the application of remote sensing
    technology is becoming increasingly widespread. Satellite remote sensing technology
    is widely used for large-scale agricultural monitoring and plays a critical role
    in the formulation of agricultural policies (Jamali et al., 2023). However, the
    practical application of satellite remote sensing is constrained by weather, cloud
    cover, low spatial or image resolution, and complex spectral information (Jay
    et al., 2019), which limits its practical utility to agricultural producers and
    operational management. Meanwhile, the development of UAV technology has made
    UAV remote sensing systems with multi-spectral cameras more convenient and flexible
    to use. They have advantages such as short response time, complete automation
    functions, high spatial, temporal, and ground resolution, reasonable spatial coverage,
    and low cost (Su et al., 2023). This technology can provide effective assistance
    to agricultural production managers. Numerous studies on LAI inversion using remote
    sensing data have been conducted by researchers both domestically and internationally.
    Caruso et al. (2023) determined that canopy volume derived from UAV imagery outperformed
    NDVI as a predictor of LAI, exhibiting superior temporal stability. This practical
    implication suggests that UAV geometric indices are effective for monitoring canopy
    biomass throughout the growing season, even under environmental stress conditions;
    Qiao et al. (2022) proposed an accurate monitoring and LAI estimation method for
    maize growth based on a UAV multispectral sensor. They found that morphological
    parameters and vegetation indices extracted from UAV images exhibit the same temporal
    distribution as LAI, enabling monitoring of crop LAI variation. However, using
    a single parameter for monitoring multiple growth stages has its limitations.
    Chen et al. (2020b) employed UAVs to obtain high-spectral images of wheat and
    found that spectral transformation significantly improved the correlation between
    spectral variables and LAI. The physical model method involves analyzing remote
    sensing data through the establishment of physical models, such as using vegetation
    radiative transfer models to estimate LAI. These models follow certain physical
    laws and quantitatively describe the relationship between canopy structural parameters
    and canopy reflectance, remaining unaffected by vegetation types (Wan et al.,
    2021). Remote sensing technology has enabled the estimation of crop yields through
    the establishment of statistical regression relationships between agricultural
    remote sensing information and crop yields (Zhang et al., 2019). However, this
    method lacks a mechanistic explanation for crop growth and yield formation, making
    it difficult to apply on a large scale (Ma et al., 2022). Furthermore, obtaining
    a vegetation index through remote sensing data proves challenging for meeting
    the requirements of crop modeling. Quantitative remote sensing faces several primary
    challenges, including directionality issues, scale effects and transformations,
    and retrieval strategies and methods (Jin et al., 2018), all of which impact the
    accuracy of estimating canopy state variables using remotely sensed data. To address
    the uncertainty inherent in remote sensing inversion of vegetation indices, previous
    studies have employed various approaches such as ground observation data validation,
    multi-source data fusion, model algorithm enhancement, uncertainty statistical
    analysis, and long-term observational series (Luo et al., 2023). In our study,
    we mitigate uncertainty in the inversion process by employing ground observation
    data validation and data assimilation techniques. Integrating crop models with
    remote sensing technology has been viewed as an effective tool for monitoring
    crop growth and estimating yields, as it leverages their respective strengths
    in time and space and accounts for the spatial heterogeneity of crops, resulting
    in more accurate crop growth status and yield estimation (Fattori Junior et al.,
    2022). Jin et al. (2024) utilized UAV to extract rice texture features from remote
    sensing images. They conducted rice field experiments with varying nitrogen fertilizer
    application rates and employed data assimilation methods to integrate UAV RGB
    image data, RiceGrows, and ground-based IoT meteorological data. This integration
    facilitated the generation of fertilizer application decisions and prescription
    maps for plant protection UAV operations, enabling precise rice fertilizer application;
    Ge et al. (2022) investigated the sensitivity of the assimilation process to the
    timing of UAV remotely sensed Plant Nutrient Concentration (PNC) data acquisition,
    covering the nutrient period, tasseling period, ripening period, and entire growing
    period. Their findings revealed that assimilating PNC data during the nutrient
    stage yielded a stronger relationship between estimated and measured PNC compared
    to other growth stages. Additionally, assimilating PNC data at the early growth
    stage better simulated PNC dynamics under nitrogen (N)-free stress conditions;
    Peng et al. (2021) utilized remote sensing data from UAVs and SAFY crop models
    for maize yield estimation, observing varying yield estimation accuracies under
    different moisture treatments. They concluded that incorporating UAV observations
    into crop data holds significant potential for monitoring crop yields and improving
    agricultural management; Yang et al. (2021) integrated UAV images into the WOFOST
    model, demonstrating improved estimation of growth and development for winter
    wheat in their study area. Their findings highlighted the enhanced accuracy of
    the winter wheat growth model simulation through UAV data integration, affirming
    the feasibility and efficacy of incorporating UAV data into crop modeling. The
    LAI assimilation in crop growth models significantly impacts the final yield estimation
    results. Process-based crop models often disregard Ensemble Kalman Filter (EnKF)
    assumptions due to challenges in their model mechanism and parameterization, resulting
    in systematic errors. Discrepancies arise in the error between LAI and yield when
    the model generates a higher LAI value than the assimilated LAI value, coupled
    with negative yield-to-yield deviation in open-loop simulation. In such cases,
    post-assimilation, the simulation may underestimate yield due to further LAI reduction
    (Kang and Özdoğan, 2019). Conversely, when the correlation between assimilated
    LAI and crop yield is weak, EnKF also fails to enhance yield estimation (Nearing
    et al., 2012). Additionally, concerning LAI assimilation, phenological errors
    may lead to inconsistencies in the magnitude and peak values of simulated and
    observed LAI (Curnel et al., 2011). Fattori Junior et al. (2022) employed EnKF
    with DSSAT/SAMUCA for LAI assimilation and observed a reasonable enhancement in
    yield estimates compared to Open-Loop (OP) simulations. This improvement partly
    stemmed from a more detailed depiction of plant physiology and soil moisture processes
    in the model, facilitating simulations using EnKF. However, the inherent variability
    in agriculture (crop parameters, soil properties, and crop management practices)
    and uncertainty in meteorological data can seriously undermine the ability of
    crop models to predict crop yields (Han et al., 2022), so accurate meteorological
    forecasts over the reproductive period can help farmers better manage their farmland
    and reduce the risk of crop damage when applying crop growth models (Prakash et
    al., 2019). Long-term weather forecasts have lower accuracy, making short-term
    or mid-term weather forecasts crucial for improving the prediction accuracy of
    crop models (Ferrise et al., 2015). Some researchers generate multiple complete
    meteorological data series covering the entire growing season by combining historical
    and real-time meteorological data, enabling the prediction of crop growth and
    yield variations (Lawless and Semenov, 2005, Bannayan and Hoogenboom, 2008). In
    daily yield forecasting, weather data before the forecast date are obtained from
    local weather stations, while unknown data between the forecast date and harvest
    date are supplemented using multi-year continuous weather series for the corresponding
    period. Multiple crop yields are obtained for each forecast day, and the median
    value is calculated as the prediction for that day. As the growing season progresses,
    historical weather data gradually get replaced by actual weather data (Chen et
    al., 2020a). By combining local historical and daily acquired weather data, this
    approach can generate daily weather sequences during the growing season to predict
    crop growth status and yield variations associated with the actual weather conditions
    before harvest (Chen et al., 2017). This study integrates remote sensing data
    into the WOFOST model by employing the Kalman filtering algorithm to assimilate
    the LAI as the state variable. Additionally, historical meteorological data is
    utilized for predicting summer maize yield. The main objectives of this research
    are as follows: (1) Constructing a one-dimensional linear regression model using
    multispectral remote sensing data within each fertility period of summer maize
    and the corresponding field-measured leaf area to determine the optimal inverse
    model for summer maize LAI. (2) Assimilating the LAI derived from remote sensing
    into the model as a state variable using the ensemble Kalman filter algorithm.
    This investigation explores the influence of different LAI sizes on assimilation
    results and assesses the impact of assimilation frequency and periods on yield.
    (3) Generating a specific meteorological data sequence by incorporating historical
    meteorological data and unknown meteorological data during the assimilation period.
    This sequence is used to drive the model, which is assimilated with real-time
    remote sensing data to obtain accurate yield predictions. By combining remote
    sensing observations in space and model simulations in time, this study achieves
    precise yield estimation at the farm scale without geographical limitations 2.
    Materials and methods 2.1. Study area The research was conducted at the irrigation
    experimental station of Northwest A&F University, located in the Yangling District
    of Shaanxi Province, China. The station''s coordinates are 108°24′ E longitude
    and 34°20′ N latitude, at an altitude of 521 m. The study area has a warm temperate
    climate with a humid monsoon, and the soil texture is loamy, with an average field
    water holding capacity ranging from 25 % to 30 %, and a wilting moisture content
    of 10.4 % (by mass moisture content). The average bulk density of the soil is
    1.44 g cm−3. The frost-free period at the station lasts 221 days per year, and
    the annual precipitation is 635.1 mm, mainly occurring between July and October.
    Groundwater level is relatively deep, and upward supply can be neglected. Fig.

    of study area in irrigation experiment station, Northwest Agriculture and Forestry
    University. Qinlong 18, a variety of corn, was manually planted in the experiment
    at a seeding rate of 52,000 plants per hectare with a row spacing of 60 cm and
    a plant spacing of 40 cm, and was not irrigated during the growth period. Before
    sowing, artificial tillage, land preparation, and fertilization were conducted.
    The phosphorus fertilizer application rate was 90 kg ha−1. The sowing and harvest
    occurred on June 13, 2019, and October 10, 2019, respectively. 2.2. Experimental
    design The study utilized a randomized block design, incorporating four nitrogen
    application levels: CK (no fertilizer), N1 (105 kg N ha−1), N2 (210 kg N ha−1),
    and N3 (315 kg N ha−1), which were administered as basal fertilizer before sowing.
    Each treatment was replicated six times, resulting in 24 plots, each with a 20
    m2 area, 5 m length, and 4 m width, with a 0.5 m buffer strip separating them.
    For a comprehensive outline of each treatment, please refer to Table 1. Table

    and chemical properties Before the experimental planting, soil profile samples
    were collected for each treatment using 5-point sampling. The samples were mixed,
    divided into four parts, and 1 kg was retained for analysis. The ring knife method
    was employed to measure bulk density, saturated water content, field water holding
    capacity, saturated hydraulic conductivity, and wilting water content, which was
    measured using the pressure membrane method. The Mariotte bottle method was utilized
    to measure the saturated hydraulic conductivity. 2.3.2. Measurement of leaf area
    index Following the seedling stage, five representative maize plants were randomly
    chosen for each treatment and labeled to track the overall growth of the plot.
    On the day when an UAV remote sensing system was used to capture an image of the
    experimental area, the length and width of all green leaves of the plants were
    measured using a tape measure. The formula for calculating individual leaf area
    is: (1) where LA is the individual leaf area (cm2), Lk is the length of the k-th
    leaf from the leaf base to the leaf tip (cm), W is the maximum width of the k-th
    leaf (cm), and a is the maize leaf area regression coefficient, 0.75. The formula
    for calculating LAI is: (2) Where ρ is the planting density (plants m−2). 2.3.3.
    Determination of summer maize yield At maturity, 12 maize plants were randomly
    selected for each treatment and harvested. The weight of the harvested plants
    was measured and converted into yield per unit area (kg ha−1) after threshing.
    2.4. Model and data 2.4.1. WOFOST model The PCSE-WOFOST model was developed using
    Python3, which offers several advantages such as the simplicity and flexibility
    of the Python language. It is also more convenient for modification and batch
    processing. The model is capable of running with a specified time step and can
    read various parameters at any time (in days) during the simulation process. Additionally,
    the model provides the “set_variable()” method, which serves as an interface for
    data assimilation. The main data required for the PCSE-WOFOST model includes:
    (1) Meteorological data The meteorological data used in this study was obtained
    from the meteorological station located within the Irrigation Experimental Station
    of Northwest A&F University. The station provides meteorological data such as
    sunshine hours (h), daily minimum temperature (℃), daily maximum temperature (℃),
    water vapor pressure (kPa), wind speed (m/s), precipitation (mm d-1), among others.
    The station provides a sufficient amount of data that meets the requirements of
    the model. However, before running the model, it is necessary to convert the format
    of the meteorological data to a file format that can be recognized by the model.
    Since the model requires solar radiation data, the formula for calculating solar
    radiation based on sunshine hours at the experimental station is as follows: (3)
    (4) where empirical coefficients as and bs are set to 0.25 and 0.5 respectively,
    n is the sunshine duration (h), N is the maximum possible sunshine duration, Ra
    is the extraterrestrial radiation at the top of the atmosphere, and ωs is the
    solar hour angle. The formula for calculating Ra is: (5) (6) (7) (8) where dr
    is the distance coefficient between the sun and the earth, δ is the declination
    of the sun, J is the Julian date of the calculation date, and μ is the latitude
    of the measurement point. Due to the lack of direct observation data of water
    vapor pressure in historical meteorological data, it is necessary to calculate
    the daily water vapor pressure, with the formula: (9) (10) where ea is the water
    vapor pressure, e0(T) is the saturation vapor pressure, RH is the relative humidity,
    and t is the temperature (℃). The saturation vapor pressure e0(T) is calculated
    using the improved Magnus formula (Alduchov and Eskridge, 1996). (2) Soil data.
    The soil data used in this study were obtained from field measurements and pertained
    to loam soil with sand, silt, and clay mass fractions of 7 %, 72 %, and 21 %,
    respectively. The 0–1 m soil layer has an average field capacity of 30 % and a
    wilting coefficient of 10.4 %, both based on gravimetric water content. (3) Field
    management data. The management data for field operations mainly comprises information
    such as the starting time of the model, the type of simulation start (seeding
    or transplanting), the crop name and variety, and the simulation end time and
    type (harvest or maturity). 2.4.2. PEST optimization program To ensure accurate
    simulation results, it is essential to adjust the model parameters to match the
    measured data when applying the model to new locations, crop varieties, and growing
    environments. Once the model parameters have been calibrated, it is necessary
    to validate the model by evaluating its applicability using data other than parameter
    calibration. This study used PEST software to optimize model parameters by comparing
    and analyzing data from the model''s output files and the software''s input files.
    The core idea of PEST software is a nonlinear optimization algorithm based on
    the Newton and gradient descent methods, which iteratively minimizes the objective
    function constructed to achieve the effect of parameter optimization. A weighted
    least-squares difference function was constructed between multiple output variable
    values of the WOFOST model and actual observed values, ψ expressed as: (11) where
    F is the crop model parameter; M(ti) is the observed value on the i-th day; O(F,ti)
    is the simulated value of the model on the i-th day; ki is the coefficient for
    adjusting the weight of different observed values; and n is the number of observed
    values. The three types of observed values, including LAI, biomass, and yield,
    were used as the reference values for the optimization program in this study.
    Different weight coefficients correspond to different types of model output values,
    thereby controlling the simulation error proportions of LAI, biomass, and yield
    within a certain range. The relative error (RE), consistency index (d), and normalized
    root mean square error (nRMSE) were used to evaluate the calibration results of
    the model, all of which are dimensionless statistical quantities that can reflect
    the degree of relative differences between the simulated values and the measured
    values. The smaller the RE and nRMSE and the closer d is to 1, the higher the
    accuracy of the model simulation. The formulas for calculating the relative error,
    consistency index, and normalized root mean square error are: (12) (13) (14) where
    n is the sample size, Mi is the simulated value of the model, Oi is the field-measured
    value, and Mm and Om are the means of the simulated values and the measured values,
    respectively. 2.5. Remote-sensing data 2.5.1. Collection, stitching, and processing
    of remote sensing image data The UAV remote sensing system used in this study
    is carried by the DJI M600 Pro, with a maximum payload of 5 kg and a maximum endurance
    of 30 min. The system includes the American RedEdge multispectral camera, which
    has a camera focal length of 5.5 mm, a field of view angle of 47.2 deg, and a
    ground resolution of 0.02 m for the images. As shown in Fig. 2. The camera has
    5 bands (475 nm, 560 nm, 668 nm, 840 nm, and 717 nm) and a light intensity sensor
    that corrects the effect of light intensity changes during aerial photography
    on reflectivity. This correction helps to avoid errors in the subsequent extraction
    of vegetation indices. The spectral response function of the multispectral camera
    used in this study is shown in Fig. 3. Download : Download high-res image (635KB)

    image Fig. 3. Spectral response function (Zhang et al., 2019). During each growth
    stage of summer corn, clear and cloudless weather conditions were chosen to acquire
    crown remote sensing images. Before the actual flight, several sets of remote
    sensing images obtained under different flight parameters were compared through
    pre-experiments, and the relevant flight parameters were finally determined. Among
    them, the flight altitude was 30 m, and the overlap rate and sidelap rate were
    both 80 %. After the flight operation was completed, multiple images obtained
    by the multispectral camera were imported into the PhotoScan 1.4.0 software developed
    by Agisoft LCC company. After point cloud and texture processing, a single-band
    orthophoto image was output after stitching. Since remote sensing imaging is easily
    affected by external environmental factors, radiometric correction is required
    before band operation, which is performed in ArcGIS 10.2, and the formula is:
    (15) where Ri is the reflectance of the i-th spectral band of the ground target,
    Di is the DN value of the i-th spectral band of the ground target, Dbi is the
    DN value of the i-th spectral band of the gray board, and Rbi is the reflectance
    of the i-th spectral band of the gray board. In order to eliminate the influence
    of soil and shadow on the calculation results of vegetation indices, this study
    determined a fixed threshold by visually interpreting the background environmental
    values in each vegetation index image, and used the raster calculator in ArcGIS
    10.2 to remove the background of the vegetation index image, as shown in Fig.
    4. At the same time, in order to make the DN values of the image correspond one-to-one
    with the sampled chlorophyll values at the plot level, the mean value of the vegetation
    index for each plot (indicated by the red box in Fig. 4) was calculated using
    the zoning tool in ArcGIS 10.2 as the vegetation index value of the plot. Download

    Threshold segmentation flowchart. By means of visual interpretation, the background
    environment value in each vegetation index image is counted to determine a fixed
    threshold, and the rejection of the environmental background of the vegetation
    index image is achieved by the raster calculator in ArcGIS 10.2. The mean value
    of the vegetation index in each plot (shown in the red box in the figure) was
    also counted as the vegetation index value of the plot using the partition statistics
    tool. (For interpretation of the references to colour in this figure legend, the
    reader is referred to the web version of this article.) 2.5.2. Extraction of vegetation
    indices Vegetation indices are useful for measuring crop conditions on the ground
    conveniently and efficiently. By performing band operation, these indices reduce
    the impact of background information on the spectral characteristics of vegetation
    and improve the accuracy of vegetation index inversion of remote sensing data.
    The Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) is capable of estimating vegetation
    physiological parameters. The Soil Adjusted Vegetation Index (SAVI) improves NDVI
    by incorporating a soil adjustment factor L, which ranges from 0 to 1 depending
    on the situation. An L value of 0 indicates no vegetation cover, while an L value
    of 1 indicates complete vegetation canopy coverage, and the influence of soil
    on spectral reflectance can be ignored. Other improved vegetation indices, such
    as OSAVI and MSAVI2, have also been developed. To reduce the impact of environmental
    background factors such as atmosphere and soil, this study selected the Modified
    Soil Adjusted Vegetation Index (MSAVI2), Soil Adjusted Vegetation Index (OSAVI),
    Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), and Soil Adjusted Vegetation Index
    (SAVI). The calculation formulas for each index are shown in Table 2. Table 2.

    NIR, near-infrared band; RE, red edge band. 2.5.3. LAI inversion model and WOFOST
    model parameterization The simple structure of the univariate linear regression
    model allows for the establishment of a linear regression prediction method based
    on the correlation between independent and dependent variables, which can effectively
    invert the LAI of summer maize. Based on the leaf area index data measured in
    the field and the vegetation index data remotely sensed by UAV, the one-way linear
    regression models of vegetation index and leaf area index from the nodulation
    stage to the maturity stage under different treatments were established, in which
    there were 60 sample data for each treatment, and 40 of them were randomly selected
    as the modeling samples according to the allocation ratio of 2:1 and the remaining
    20 were used as the validation samples. The equation is shown as formula (16):
    (16) where y is the predicted value of LAI, x is the vegetation index obtained
    from remote sensing data, a is the coefficient, and b is the constant. The model
    accuracy evaluation is based on the root mean square error (RMSE) and the coefficient
    of determination (R2): (17) (18) where xi is the measured value of LAI, ‾x is
    the mean of the measured values, yi is the predicted value of LAI, ‾y is the mean
    of the predicted values, and n is the sample size for modeling. 2.6. Data assimilation
    Determining sources of uncertainty in model parameters is a crucial step in data
    assimilation using the ensemble Kalman filter algorithm. The input parameters
    and initial conditions of the crop model restrict the growth and yield generation
    stages of crops. The initial total crop dry weight (TDWI) impacts the crop''s
    initial growth rate and the maximum value of the LAI, while the leaf lifespan
    at 35 ℃(SPAN) determines the aging rate and aging time of the leaves. Furthermore,
    De Wit et al. (2012) analyzed the initial total crop dry weight and the leaf lifespan
    at 35 ℃ using a joint distribution and found that these two parameters had no
    significant correlation. Therefore, TDWI and SPAN were selected in this study
    to illustrate the uncertainty of the WOFOST model. An assimilation ensemble size
    of 50 and an uncertainty of 10 % were employed for TDWI and SPAN, respectively.
    The standard analysis equation for Kalman filtering is (Huang et al., 2015): (19)
    (20) where Aa is the analysis matrix of the state variable ensemble, A is the
    forecast matrix of the state variable ensemble, D is the observation matrix, H
    is the observation operator, Pe is the covariance matrix of the forecast ensemble,
    Re is the covariance matrix of the observation ensemble, and K is the Kalman coefficient.
    In this study, the observation matrix is remote sensing LAI, the forecast matrix
    is modeled simulated LAI, A and D are the same variable, the observation operator
    does not need to convert the two variables, thus H is an identity matrix, and
    Eq. (19) and Eq. (20) can be rewritten as: (21) (22) A is the simulated LAI set
    of the model considering parameter uncertainty, D is a new remote sensing set
    generated by adding remote sensing LAI with Gaussian distribution probability
    using random perturbations, and Aa is the set used to rewrite the model LAI after
    assimilation. Based on the convenience of remotely sensing crop LAI, it serves
    as the state variable for data assimilation. The model parameters, TDWI and SPAN,
    are selected as sources of uncertainty, and random perturbations are added to
    them based on Gaussian distribution probability to create a parameter set, P,
    comprising 50 model parameters that conform to a Gaussian distribution. P is input
    into the model, and the model runs to time t, when observation values are available,
    to obtain a forecast set, Mt, consisting of simulated LAI state variables. The
    observed LAI data is randomly perturbed based on Gaussian distribution probability
    to obtain an observation set, Ot, with the same size as Mt. The best LAI value,
    referred to as updated LAI, at time t is calculated by Eq. (21), utilizing the
    LAI of the forecast set and the LAI of the observation set. The updated LAI set
    is incorporated into the model using the set_variable() method in the WOFOST model.
    The model continues running until the next observation time, and the aforementioned
    steps are repeated until all observation data is assimilated. Once the model runs
    to the end date, a yield set of size m is obtained, and the assimilated yield
    is the average value of this set. 3. Results 3.1. Summer maize LAI inversion model
    based on multispectral remote sensing data Five sets of remote sensing data were
    acquired on July 16, July 31, August 15, September 6, and September 21, 2019.
    The LAI data measured on the ground were also obtained for the same dates. Common
    vegetation indices were used for performing correlation analysis with the measured
    LAI. 3.1.1. Correlation analysis between LAI and vegetation indices Table 3 presents
    the correlation analysis results between LAI and four vegetation indices of maize
    under different treatments from the jointing stage to maturity. The results indicate
    that there are differences in correlation among the various treatments. For the
    CK treatment, all four vegetation indices exhibit a good correlation with LAI,
    with NDVI having the highest correlation and MSAVI2 showing a strong negative
    correlation with LAI. Of the various nitrogen treatments, LAI has the highest
    correlation with NDVI, which is 0.874 (N1), 0.865 (N2), and 0.871 (N3), and is
    significantly negatively correlated with MSAVI2, while exhibiting the smallest
    correlation with SAVI. Table 3. Correlation coefficient between vegetation index

    3.1.2. Regression model building The outcomes for predicting LAI based on different
    vegetation indices under various nitrogen treatments are presented in Table 4.
    The findings demonstrate that the LAI-NDVI regression model outperformed the other
    models, with R2 values of 0.84, 0.70, 0.63, and 0.79, all with significance probabilities
    less than 0.01, indicating highly significant fitted regression models. The order
    of performance for the other regression models was LAI-OSAV > LAI-MSAVI2 > LAI-SAVI.
    For each fertilizer treatment, the significance probability of the LAI-SAVI regression
    model was greater than 0.01, indicating that it was not significant. Table 4.

    of the model for estimating LAI and vegetation index of summer maize The results
    of the LAI-NDVI model for different treatments are presented in Fig. 5. While
    the LAI-SAVI model demonstrated low accuracy, the accuracy test results of the
    remaining three models were satisfactory. Specifically, the R2 values of the LAI-NDVI
    model were 0.90 (CK), 0.89 (N1), 0.91 (N2), and 0.91 (N3); the RMSE values were
    0.21 (CK), 0.29 (N1), 0.28 (N2), and 0.25 (N3); and the RE values were 11.04 %
    (CK), 13.75 % (N1), 8.98 % (N2), and 9.95 % (N3). The slope of the regression
    equation between the predicted and measured LAI values of the LAI-NDVI model was
    close to 1 for all treatments (0.88 for CK, 0.89 for N1, 0.83 for N2, and 0.83
    for N3), indicating that the accuracy test results of the LAI-NDVI model were
    superior. The R2 values of the LAI-MSAVI2 and LAI-OSAVI models were greater than
    0.73 and 0.81, respectively, and their accuracy test results were the second-best
    among the models. See the appendices for LAI-MSAVI2, LAI-OSAVI and SAVI models.

    The calibration of the WOFOST model The PEST software was utilized in this study
    to optimize the model parameters. The experimental data used for model calibration
    and verification were collected from field measurements taken at the Irrigation
    Test Station of Northwest A&F University, located in Yangling District, Shaanxi
    Province, between 2014 and 2016. The data encompassed a wide range of variables,
    including soil physical characteristics, field management practices, and field
    observations, spanning the summer maize growing season and covering aspects such
    as LAI, biomass, and yield. The 2014 experimental data were used for model calibration,
    whereas the 2015 to 2016 data were utilized for model verification, encompassing
    the entire growing period, from emergence to maturity, as well as LAI, biomass,
    and yield. The field management parameters, including sowing and harvesting dates,
    were set by the specific experimental timelines. The parameters in the WOFOST
    model can be classified into three categories: developmental parameters, growth
    parameters, and soil parameters, each with a distinct function. The developmental
    parameters include accumulated temperature from sowing date to emergence (TSUMEM),
    from emergence to flowering (TSUM1), and from flowering to maturity (TSUM2). Soil
    parameters encompass the soil moisture content at the wilting point (SMW), field
    capacity (SMFCF), and saturated soil moisture content (SM0), all of which influence
    the amount of soil water available for crop growth and development. In this study,
    ten parameters that were found to be sensitive to the growth and development of
    summer maize were selected and adjusted based on previous research, while the
    remaining parameters were left at the default values of the model. LAI and above-ground
    biomass (TAGP) were chosen as the evaluation indicators when optimizing the crop
    parameters using the PEST program. One thousand sets of parameters were generated
    through random sampling within the range of the ten selected parameters, and these
    sets were subsequently used to adjust the model with the PEST software. The results
    of the modification process are presented in Table 5. Table 5. Parameter adjustment

    and validation The accuracy and reliability of model simulations are typically
    evaluated by comparing simulated values with measured values. Two main methods
    are employed for this purpose: numerical comparison and graphical comparison.
    Table 6 presents the calibration results of parameters for the development stages
    of summer maize. During the years 2015 and 2016, the emergence dates'' simulated
    errors resulted in zero days, whereas the flowering dates'' simulated errors resulted
    in four and two days, respectively. Similarly, the maturity dates'' simulated
    errors yielded two and five days in 2015 and 2016, respectively. Table 6. Correction

    of verifying the summer maize LAI and dry matter are presented in Fig. 6. In 2015,
    the consistency index between the simulated and measured LAI was 0.94, whereas
    it was 0.95 in 2016. The standard root mean square error of LAI verification was
    found to be 24.73 % and 25.53 % in 2015 and 2016, respectively. The consistency
    indexes for simulated dry matter were 0.97 and 0.98 in 2015 and 2016, respectively,
    with standard root mean square errors of 28.41 % and 28.02 %, respectively. These
    values, which fall within the range of 20 % to 30 %, indicate good simulation
    performance. Additionally, there was little interannual variation in the verification
    results. In 2015 and 2016, the relative errors of simulated yield were 1.3 % and
    1.5 %, respectively. Download : Download high-res image (318KB) Download : Download
    full-size image Fig. 6. Validation of WOFOST model summer maize LAI and aboveground
    biomass calibration results for 2015 and 2016. Based on the verification results
    of the simulation and measured values in 2015 and 2016, the errors for each growth
    stage were within 5 days, and the relative error of yield was less than 5 %. Additionally,
    the consistency indexes and standard root mean square errors of dry matter and
    LAI were within reasonable ranges. Consequently, the calibrated WOFOST model for
    summer corn in the Yangling area exhibited high applicability. Subsequently, the
    WOFOST model was built based on the four fertilization measures, and the ensemble
    Kalman filter algorithm was applied to assimilate the remotely observed LAI. 3.2.3.
    Assimilation experiment results Based on the remote sensing inversion LAI model
    in Section 3.1.3, remote sensing LAI values for data assimilation were determined
    under different treatments. Based on the actual remote sensing data sampling time,
    the WOFOST model LAI was updated on the 34th day (July 16, 2019), 49th day (July
    31, 2019), 64th day (August 15, 2019), 86th day (September 6, 2019), and 101st
    day (September 21, 2019) after sowing. The variations of LAI after assimilating
    remote sensing observations using an ensemble Kalman filter for each treatment
    are displayed in Fig. 7. The red line represents the initial LAI before the first
    assimilation, without remote sensing data assimilation. In the CK treatment, the
    initial LAI exceeded the remote sensing LAI at all growth stages. Conversely,
    for the N1 treatment, there was little disparity between the initial simulated
    LAI value and the remote sensing LAI value. Comparatively, for the N2 treatment,
    the remote sensing LAI values were consistently greater than the initial simulated
    LAI value for each stage and period. Lastly, for the N3 treatment, the remote
    sensing LAI value was lower than that of the N2 treatment, but higher than those
    of the CK and N1 treatments. Download : Download high-res image (420KB) Download

    different treatments. CK is no fertilizer application; N1 is 105 kg N ha−1; N2
    is 210 kg N ha−1; N3 is 315 kg N ha−1. After two or three data assimilation cycles,
    the LAI of the model ensemble in the CK treatment decreased and became lower than
    the non-assimilated LAI value. In the N1 treatment, 33 out of 50 model ensemble
    members had higher simulated LAI values than the initial LAI value. For the N2
    treatment, the majority of the model ensemble (45 out of 50) exhibited LAI values
    that were higher than the initial simulated LAI value, while some members of the
    ensemble showed a decline in LAI values as the model progressed. In the N3 treatment,
    there were significant variations in the simulated LAI values among the members
    of the model ensemble, with the majority of the simulated LAI values being greater
    than the initial simulated LAI value. In the CK treatment, the assimilated LAI
    values in the model ensemble decreased significantly after the fourth assimilation,
    with a greater magnitude of decrease than in the previous three assimilations.
    Although the decrease in LAI was smaller in the fifth assimilation than in the
    fourth, it was still greater than in the first three assimilations. After all
    five assimilations, most of the assimilated LAI values in the model ensemble were
    smaller than the initial LAI values without assimilation. In the N1 treatment,
    the simulated LAI values changed greatly after the fourth assimilation, with 40
    members of the model ensemble having higher simulated LAI values than the initial
    LAI value. After all five assimilations, there were still 40 members of the model
    ensemble with LAI values greater than the initial LAI value. After the fourth
    assimilation in the N2 treatment, the simulated LAI values were greatly improved,
    with only a small fraction (2/50) of LAI values lower than the initial simulated
    LAI value. Similarly, the fifth assimilation also significantly improved the LAI
    values in the model ensemble, with all simulated LAI values in the model ensemble
    higher than the initial simulated LAI value. In the later growth stages, most
    of the model ensemble members (48/50) showed higher simulated LAI values than
    the initial simulated LAI value, indicating that data assimilation can significantly
    affect the magnitude of LAI values. After the fourth assimilation in the N3 treatment,
    all simulated LAI values in the model ensemble were improved, and after the fifth
    assimilation, most members of the model ensemble had LAI values greater than the
    initial simulated LAI value. The assimilated LAI value in the N3 treatment was
    smaller than that in the N2 treatment due to the influence of the observed LAI
    value from remote sensing, but it was still greater than that in the CK and N1
    treatments. After five data assimilation cycles, the model ensemble''s average
    yield is close to the field measured yield, which are CK: 6608 kg ha−1 (6672 kg
    ha−1), N1: 7156 kg ha−1 (7224 kg ha−1), N2: 7469 kg ha−1 (7664 kg ha−1), and N3:
    7346 kg ha−1 (7325 kg ha−1), compared with the initial simulated yield of 7000
    kg ha−1, indicating high prediction ability of the assimilated model. The RMSE
    and RE values have significantly decreased after data assimilation. The RMSE values
    are CK: 109.0 kg ha−1 (339.7 kg ha−1), N1: 96.4 kg ha−1 (234.2 kg ha−1), N2: 206.5
    kg ha−1 (668.0 kg ha−1), and N3: 80.9 kg ha−1 (334.2 kg ha−1), respectively. The
    RE values are CK: 1.0 % (4.9 %), N1: 0.9 % (3.1 %), N2: 2.5 % (8.6 %), and N3:
    0.3 % (4.4 %), respectively. These values indicate that the difference between
    the simulated and measured yield after assimilation is small, and the simulation
    accuracy is significantly improved. Fig. 7 showed that the denser part of the
    black curve roughly represented the mean value of simulated LAI in the model ensemble.
    It was observed that the simulated LAI in the model ensemble was affected by the
    assimilation algorithm. In the case when the remote sensing observation LAI value
    was smaller than the initial simulated LAI value (CK), it caused the LAI value
    of the simulated ensemble to decrease, making the final mean value of simulated
    LAI smaller than the initial LAI value, and thus the simulated yield of the model
    ensemble was also smaller than the initial yield. When the remotely observed LAI
    was larger than the initial LAI (N1, N2, N3), the ensemble Kalman filtering algorithm
    could make the simulated LAI mean value within the model ensemble lie on top of
    the initial LAI value. At the same time, the magnitude of the remotely observed
    LAI value also influenced the magnitude of the final simulated LAI mean value
    of the ensemble, and the difference in the magnitude of the remotely observed
    LAI value also had a significant effect on the simulated LAI mean value within
    the final model ensemble. The difference in the size of the remotely sensed LAI
    values also affected the size of the simulated mean LAI values within the final
    model ensemble, and such an effect was transmitted to the simulated yield changes
    through the changes in LAI values. The simulated yield means of the final model
    ensemble also changed, and the yields of the simulated LAI values within the model
    ensemble that were smaller than the initial simulated LAI values were smaller
    than the initial simulated yields. The treatment N2 that had the largest remotely
    sensed LAI values had the largest simulated yields of the final assimilated simulations,
    and the remotely sensed LAI size corresponded to the size of the assimilated simulated
    yield, indicating that the application of the ensemble Kalman filtering algorithm
    could achieve the purpose of assimilating remote sensing data to improve the accuracy
    of yield simulation. 3.2.4. Sensitivity of assimilation timing on the yield after
    assimilation Through the analysis of the previous section''s assimilation results,
    it is apparent that data assimilation''s impact on the simulated LAI values of
    the model ensemble varies at different times. The first three data assimilations
    had little effect on the simulated LAI yield of the model ensemble, as reflected
    by the denser black curve in the figure. Conversely, the latter two assimilations
    had a more substantial impact on the simulated LAI value of the model ensemble,
    and the black curve had a more pronounced mutation. Therefore, this section aims
    to explore the sensitivity of assimilation at different times to the final yield.
    The five remote sensing observation data can be arranged and combined to produce
    31 assimilation methods that vary according to different assimilation times, as
    shown in Fig. 8. When only one data assimilation is considered, the relative errors
    of the yields obtained through the two assimilation methods on September 6 and
    September 21, 2019, are both low, with an RMSE of 344.1 kg ha−1 and 353.9 kg ha−1,
    respectively. For the methods that involve selecting two remote sensing observation
    data for data assimilation, the assimilation of the remote sensing observation
    data collected on September 6 and September 21, 2019 yields the smallest relative
    error among all the assimilation methods using two remote sensing data, with a
    value of only 2.91 %, and an RMSE of 233.2 kg ha−1. As for the methods that use
    three remote sensing observation data for data assimilation, the smallest RMSE
    of 199.8 kg ha−1 and a relative error of only 2.45 % were obtained through the
    assimilation of the remote sensing data collected on August 15, September 6, and
    September 21, 2019. Additionally, the simulated yield obtained by assimilating
    the remote sensing data of July 31, September 6, and September 21, 2019, also
    shows a small relative error of 2.62 % and an RMSE of 212.2 kg ha−1. When assimilating
    four remote sensing data, the simulated yields of the other three methods are
    close to the actual yields, except for the two methods involving data assimilation
    on September 6 and September 21, 2019. The results of the method that assimilates
    all five remote sensing data are consistent with the previous section and will
    not be repeated. Download : Download high-res image (625KB) Download : Download

    based on historical meteorological data 3.3.1. Data assimilation of WOFOST model
    and remote sensing LAI inversion based on historical meteorological data The use
    of crop models for yield prediction faces a major challenge due to the absence
    of future meteorological data. To address this problem, this study selected historical
    years spanning from 1985 to 2017 and extracted meteorological data during the
    summer corn growing season for each year. Various data assimilation techniques
    were applied to combine the historical meteorological data with the real-time
    meteorological data and produce the meteorological input files required for the
    model. With an increase in the number of assimilation iterations, the proportion
    of real-time meteorological data in the synthesized meteorological data also increased.
    The synthetic meteorological data generated from the assimilation dates included
    the real-time meteorological data. For instance, in the Yangling district of Shaanxi
    Province where this study was conducted, the summer corn planting time in 2019
    was on June 13th, and the first remote sensing observation data was produced on
    July 16th. At this point, the meteorological data from June 13th to July 16th
    in the historical year was replaced with known meteorological data. The model
    commenced running from the planting date and went through the first data assimilation
    on July 16th. Subsequently, the model continued to run until the harvest period,
    with the necessary meteorological data being replaced by historical meteorological
    data, resulting in one assimilation prediction outcome. When the second remote
    sensing assimilation data became available (July 31st), the meteorological data
    from June 13th to July 31st was used to replace the corresponding meteorological
    data in the historical year, and the model went through two data assimilations
    on July 16th and July 31st respectively, running until the harvest period. This
    process continued until all observation data were assimilated. The historical
    meteorological data utilized in this study was collected from the Yangling Meteorological
    Station from 1985 to 2017 and encompassed 33 years, including sunshine duration,
    maximum and minimum temperature, precipitation, wind speed, and water vapor pressure.
    The crop yield prediction scheme is based on the assimilation of summer maize
    LAI data obtained from remote sensing. The scheme involves five remote sensing
    observation data acquired from July 16 to September 21, which results in five
    predicted yield values. The yield predictions are obtained for each assimilation
    from July 16 until the end of the model, which occurs after the completion of
    all five assimilations. The synthetic meteorological data required for the model
    is generated by combining real-time meteorological data with 33 years of historical
    meteorological data. Each assimilation results in a set of yields consisting of
    33 values. Fig. 9 illustrates the process of generating synthetic meteorological
    data. Download : Download high-res image (149KB) Download : Download full-size

    of data compiled based on the assimilation scheme. For specifying sowing dates
    for each year, this study utilized YAML-format field management files. As yield
    prediction was the objective, the actual maturity period of crops in each historical
    year determined the harvest date. To enhance the running efficiency of the code,
    two loops were embedded in the Python language environment of the model, implementing
    a double loop based on year and assimilation times. The yield of 33 years for
    different treatments and assimilation schemes was organized and outputted into
    an Excel file using the Pandas package after the model ran. Some code snippets
    are in the appendices. The most critical aspect of constructing the yield prediction
    program is to modify the field management code. In the original code, three placeholders
    {crop_start_date}, {crop_sowing_date}, and {crop_harvest_date} respectively represent
    the start date of crop simulation, the crop sowing date, and the crop harvest
    date. To obtain 33 years of field management parameters from 1985 to 2017, the
    simulation start date, crop sowing date, and crop harvest date for each year were
    set as June 1st, June 13th, and October 10th, respectively, using for loop statements.
    The print() statement was used to confirm the correctness of the field management
    data for each year. Finally, the field management data for each year was written
    into the model, and the field management section of the yield prediction program
    was constructed. 3.3.2. Yield forecast results Fig. 10(a) to 11(d) depict the
    predicted yield results of CK, N1, N2 and N3 treatments, respectively. The yield
    distribution in all treatments does not converge with increasing assimilation
    time. The predicted yield ensemble on August 15 exhibits the largest dispersion
    among all treatments, with the greatest difference between the upper and lower
    limits for the yield prediction ensemble on July 16. However, as assimilation
    time progresses, the predicted yield ensemble gradually converges after August
    15, and the predicted yield value on September 6 is the closest to the actual
    measurement. The final predicted yield ensemble exhibits a more concentrated distribution
    than before. Download : Download high-res image (292KB) Download : Download full-size

    yield prediction results without data assimilation exhibit no apparent pattern.
    Therefore, data assimilation can effectively rectify errors that occur when synthesized
    meteorological data is used to run the model, resulting in more precise yield
    predictions. Download : Download high-res image (154KB) Download : Download full-size

    in 2019. The coefficient of variation of yield ensembles and the relative error
    between predicted and actual yields for different assimilation schemes under each
    treatment are presented in Table 7. Under all treatments, the coefficient of variation
    is minimized after five assimilation cycles, followed by the coefficient of variation
    for the yield ensemble on September 6th, while the differences in the coefficient
    of variation for the yield ensembles among the other three assimilation schemes
    are not significant. The predicted yield of the five assimilation schemes with
    assimilation of LAI under the CK treatment is 6696, 6988, 6995, 6834, and 6398
    kg ha−1, and the prediction results with the smallest relative error is on September
    6th with an error of 2.44 %. For the N1 treatment with assimilation of LAI, the
    predicted yield of the five assimilation schemes is 7063, 7071, 7111, 7292, and
    6854 kg ha−1, and the prediction result with the smallest relative error is also
    on September 6th with an error of 0.94 %. Likewise, under the N2 treatment with
    assimilation, the predicted yield of the five assimilation schemes is 7105, 7138,
    7194, 7531, and 7149 kg ha−1, and the prediction results with the smallest relative
    error is also on September 6th with an error of 0.84 %. Finally, under the N3
    treatment with assimilation, the predicted yield of the five assimilation schemes
    is 7087, 7101, 7142, 7446, and 7034 kg ha−1, and the prediction result with the
    highest accuracy is on September 6th with an error of 1.93 %. Table 7. Coefficient

    CK, no fertilizer application; N1, 105 kg N ha−1; N2, 210 kg N ha−1; N3, 315 kg
    N ha−1. A comparison of the variation coefficients and relative errors for different
    assimilation times in Table 7 reveals a trend of decreasing variation coefficients
    for the yield prediction ensembles under each treatment as time progresses. Specifically,
    the variation coefficient of the yield prediction ensemble under the CK treatment
    decreases from 15.69 on July 16 to 6.90 on September 21, with the smallest variation
    coefficient among all treatments at the latter date. The N1, N2, and N3 treatments
    show similar patterns of gradually decreasing variation coefficients over time.
    The variation coefficients for the three times from July 16th to August 15th slightly
    decrease, while the variation coefficient for September 6th decreases the most
    compared to the previous time, followed by the variation coefficient for September
    21st. However, there are no significant differences in variation coefficients
    among the three treatments at each predicted time. The decrease in variation coefficients
    for the yield prediction ensembles implies that the yield prediction result on
    September 6 is relatively ideal, consistent with the analysis results mentioned
    above. 4. Discussion 4.1. Inversion of LAI using UAV multispectral remote sensing
    data The LAI inversion results under each treatment indicated a trend of increasing
    first and then decreasing during the entire observation period. The LAI reached
    its maximum value on August 15, 2019, as the growth and development process advanced.
    The N2 treatment showed the largest LAI among all treatments. During the late
    stage of growth, leaf senescence led to a gradual decrease in the LAI. An increase
    in nitrogen application rate led to an increase in the LAI for both the N1 and
    N2 treatments. The LAI was higher under the N3 treatment compared to the CK and
    N1 treatments, but lower than that under the N2 treatment. The CK treatment resulted
    in the smallest LAI, while the N2 treatment showed the most significant increase
    compared to the CK treatment. The study found that nitrogen application treatments
    can increase the LAI of summer maize, but excessive nitrogen fertilizer application
    cannot sustainably increase the LAI. This finding is consistent with previous
    studies (Lu et al., 2021), where excessive nitrogen fertilizer application reduced
    light transmittance in the canopy, resulting in premature senescence of the lower
    leaves, and ultimately decreasing the LAI content. Dandan et al. (2020) found
    that NDVI can be used to analyze the dynamics of LAI during crop growth by measuring
    the difference between the near-infrared band and the red band, further analysis
    revealed that the modeling and inversion results of the LAI-NDVI model were better
    in the CK, N1, and N3 treatments, but the R2 of the LAI-NDVI model decreased under
    the N2 treatment. This could be attributed to the larger LAI of summer corn under
    the N2 treatment, which increased vegetation cover and made the NDVI too sensitive
    to the red band. The strong absorption of chlorophyll resulted in the rapid saturation
    of the red band, which made the NDVI index insensitive to larger vegetation indices
    when the coverage reached a certain degree (Wan et al., 2020). Moreover, the predicted
    values of the LAI-NDVI model in each treatment were lower than the measured values,
    which may have been influenced by this factor. Additionally, the threshold segmentation
    method was employed to remove the environmental background in the remote sensing
    image, which may have resulted in poor modeling results of the other three indices
    compared to the LAI. It is known that the environmental background significantly
    affects the inversion of crop canopy information, and the soil-adjusted vegetation
    index and its derived vegetation indices (SAVI, MSAVI2, and OSAVI) were developed
    to reduce this impact. At the plot level, spectral information includes both vegetation
    and its environmental background, which arises from the interaction between the
    two. Removing the environmental background may affect the spectral information''s
    integrity and, thus, the relationship between vegetation indices and leaf area
    indices. 4.2. Evaluation at different assimilation time windows A literature review
    of 31 yield simulation methods showed that the assimilation of three remote sensing
    data points on August 15, September 6, and September 21, 2019, resulted in significant
    improvements in simulation accuracy and changes in simulated yield. Surprisingly,
    the accuracy of yield simulation even exceeded that of assimilating all remote
    sensing data. This could be attributed to the fact that these dates correspond
    to the critical stage of yield formation for summer maize, where an increase in
    the LAI leads to a direct increase in yield. Ge et al. (2022) found similar results
    in their study, indicating that assimilating LAI during the crop''s nutritional
    growth stage can improve yield estimation accuracy. Additionally, this study introduced
    nitrogen fertilizer gradients, and nitrogen fertilizer significantly contributes
    to crop growth and development during the early stages (De Souza et al., 2022),
    promoting maize to absorb more nutrients during the elongation stage. Furthermore,
    Xie et al. (2017) compared the yield estimation performance of different assimilation
    strategies during various growth stages of winter wheat, finding that assimilating
    remote sensing-derived LAI achieved the highest yield estimation accuracy during
    the jointing and heading stages. In the standard analytical equation of the ensemble
    Kalman filtering algorithm, the Kalman gain K was influenced by the size of the
    covariance matrix of the observation matrix as well as the forecast matrix. The
    size of K directly affected the size of the LAI ensemble of the input model after
    assimilation. It was observed from Fig. 8(f) that, in the absence of any assimilation,
    the size of the simulated LAI in the model ensemble reached its maximum value
    during the fertility period before the LAI reached its peak. At this point, the
    curve was more concentrated, indicating a smaller variance of the forecast matrix.
    Consequently, the ensemble Kalman filter algorithm, after comparing the variance
    of the observation matrix with that of the forecast matrix, produced an assimilated
    LAI ensemble that was more numerically biased toward the LAI of the forecast matrix
    (the simulated LAI of the model ensemble). As the model advanced to the point
    where the LAI reached its maximum value, the variance of the forecast matrix increased,
    surpassing that of the observation matrix. At this time, the assimilated LAI ensemble
    produced by the Kalman filter''s standard analytical equation became numerically
    more biased toward the LAI of the observation matrix. This phenomenon could be
    illustrated in Fig. 8(d) and 8(e), where the first three assimilations did not
    have much effect on the simulated LAI values of the model ensemble, and there
    was no obvious mutation of the black curves in the graphs. However, in the fourth
    and fifth assimilations, there was a significant change in the simulated LAI of
    the model ensemble, with the assimilated LAI being numerically closer to the remotely
    sensed LAI. The black curves in Fig. 8(a) to Fig. 8(e) showed a significant increase
    in the LAI value after the fourth and fifth assimilations. Therefore, to enhance
    yield estimation accuracy, it is crucial to incorporate crop parameters into the
    crop model during the optimal assimilation time window. The assimilation timing
    should prioritize remote sensing data during the flowering to filling stage of
    summer maize, as the assimilation effect of remote sensing data reduces during
    the maturation stage. If the remote sensing data is limited, the remote sensing
    data during the reproductive growth stage of summer maize should be given priority
    for assimilation. Additionally, remote sensing data with at least three assimilation
    times must be selected while choosing the assimilation number. 4.3. Summer maize
    yield prediction based on historical meteorological data and data assimilation
    In contrast, this study integrates historical meteorological data, UAV remote
    sensing, and crop models to predict yield. The historical meteorological data
    resolves the problem of unknown meteorological data in the future, while the remote
    sensing observation benefits are leveraged to dynamically correct the simulated
    values with the data assimilation method, bringing them closer to the observed
    values. Comparing the predicted yields of four different LAI assimilation methods,
    we found that all five assimilation methods produced good accuracy, with a relative
    error of less than 5 %. The yields obtained from the four assimilation methods
    were more accurate than those obtained from the first three methods, with the
    smallest relative error in predicted yield and a smaller coefficient of variation
    in yield ensemble. This indicated that prediction accuracy improves with an increase
    in the number of assimilation times, which aligns with the findings of Guo et
    al. (2019). This phenomenon occurred because the proportion of known meteorological
    data in the synthetic meteorological data increased with the number of assimilations,
    reducing the uncertainty caused by meteorological factors on crop growth and leading
    to more accurate predicted yields. The second aspect pertained to the remote sensing
    observations conducted during the summer maize filling period, characterized by
    more frequent occurrences of the four assimilations compared to the preceding
    three. This interval held paramount significance for the accumulation of grain
    material and the ultimate yield development in summer maize (Chen et al., 2023).
    During this phase, more than half of the organic matter synthesized by photosynthetic
    organs was directly channeled into storage organs. Subsequently, photosynthetic
    products were transported to the kernels, yielding improvements in kernel weight
    and resulting in increased yields (Zhang et al., 2022). At the same time, the
    leaf area of the summer maize population no longer changed significantly during
    this period, and the influence of meteorological factors on crop yield gradually
    diminished. As a result, following the fourth assimilation, the simulated LAI
    of the model exhibited a closer alignment with the actual crop growth LAI, leading
    to assimilated yield predictions that approached actual yields. Despite yielding
    the least coefficient of variation across the yield ensemble following five assimilation
    times under each treatment, the accuracy of yield prediction was lower compared
    to that observed after four assimilation times. This might be attributed to the
    fact that the period after the fifth assimilation was not the end of the simulation,
    and historical meteorological data was still used until the harvest. Due to interannual
    differences in meteorological data, the model''s simulations may deviate, leading
    to increased uncertainty in yield simulation and influencing agricultural decision-making
    (Chen and Tao, 2022). This also indicated that there may be limitations on the
    number of remote sensing assimilation times. To achieve more accurate yield predictions,
    further optimization of model structure and assimilation methods was required.
    Yield prediction results were accompanied by a certain probability due to the
    unknown nature of meteorological data, rather than a fixed value. However, we
    must also acknowledge that selecting historical meteorological data profoundly
    impacted crop model prediction results, and generating appropriate meteorological
    data was crucial for yield prediction accuracy. Meteorological data exhibited
    typical features in both time and space, leading to distinguishable climate conditions
    in different regions or the same region in different years. Using multi-year historical
    meteorological data as synthetic meteorological data for yield prediction, with
    years exhibiting large differences in annual patterns, can result in significant
    errors in yield prediction and uneven distribution of essential meteorological
    elements such as precipitation or sunshine hours during the summer corn growing
    period. To tackle this problem, some researchers have employed cluster analysis
    to select years with similar meteorological factors to the target year for meteorological
    data synthesis, resulting in improved yield prediction results (Chen et al., 2017).
    Nonetheless, known historical meteorological data was limited, and systematic
    meteorological observations began after 1953 in most locations, limiting the yield
    prediction results using this approach. 4.4. Prospect we employed an empirical
    approach to investigate the inversion of LAI from UAV remote sensing data. We
    constructed empirical LAI models based on empirical relationships between field-measured
    LAI observations and remotely sensed spectral vegetation indices. These observational
    LAI prediction models are significantly influenced by crop type. However, regional
    scales often encompass multiple crop species, making it challenging to adapt a
    single field-scale LAI-Vegetation Index (VI) relationship to diverse regions.
    To address this challenge, some researchers assimilated multiple variables (including
    crop phenology, vegetation temperature condition index, and solar radiation) by
    integrating them into the model (Manivasagam and Rozenstein, 2020). This increased
    the linkage between remotely sensed observations and mechanistic crop models,
    and corrected the model with the help of high-quality auxiliary information collected
    in situ (e.g., in situ LAI measurements). They used regression models to link
    remotely sensed data and field measurements to form a regional effectiveness model
    (Rozenstein et al., 2019). Furthermore, some researchers proposed using big data
    analysis to run a large number of model simulations simultaneously to account
    for a variety of scenarios. Lobell et al. (2015) proposed a scalable crop yield
    mapping (SCYM) algorithm that uses multiple crop model simulations to train a
    multiple regression model between yield and crop/weather variables. Through multiple
    simulations, SCYM takes into account various realistic combinations of weather
    conditions, soil types, and field operations (e.g., planting date, fertilizer
    application) for a given area. In this study, we combined a field crop model with
    UAV remote sensing technology and a sequential assimilation algorithm based on
    historical meteorological data to predict summer maize yields. However, acquiring
    crop yield information at the farmland scale presents challenges for sustainable
    agricultural management and national food security assessment. UAV remote sensing
    technology, though valuable, is constrained by limited coverage area, lack of
    regional-scale data availability, and high acquisition costs, impeding timely
    and accurate regional-scale yield data acquisition. To address this, upgrading
    crop yield prediction from the field scale to the regional scale can be achieved
    by adopting a regional division approach. This involves simulating regional division
    to divide and combine large areas into smaller regions with relatively consistent
    crop growth characteristics and environments. Researchers divided simulation zones
    based on soil properties, soil zoning maps, field measurements, and the spatial
    distribution of NDVI and yield data (Guo et al., 2018), using different models
    to simulate spatial crop yields. They found that simulation zoning can effectively
    address the spatialized use of crop growth models. We can join the Agricultural
    Model Intercomparison and Improvement Project (AgMIP; Rosenzweig et al., 2013)
    project for crop yield prediction after dividing the simulation zones. This involves
    comparing crop models at various scales accumulated in the AGMIP project and integrating
    related data and field-scale, high-precision remote sensing data acquired by UAVs.
    Selected crop models are calibrated, and the most suitable model is selected to
    simulate and predict crop yields in small regions based on assessment results.
    Ultimately, small-region yield data are integrated into large-region scales by
    determining the weights of the large region accounted for by small regions and
    using weighted averaging. This provides support for farmland management measures
    and optimized allocation of resources, as well as assessment of agricultural risks.
    5. Conclusions This study was based on unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) multispectral
    remote sensing data and the WOFOST model. UAV remote sensing-derived vegetation
    indices were used to invert the Leaf Area Index (LAI) of summer maize in the experimental
    area, and a high correlation was found between NDVI and LAI, with a good determination
    coefficient for the LAI-NDVI regression model. The measured values and predicted
    values obtained after validation showed a strong correlation. By calibrating the
    main parameters of the model using crop and soil data from the Northwest Agriculture
    and Forestry University Irrigation Experiment Station, the consistency index “d”
    for various validation indicators was greater than 0.9, and the normalized root
    mean square error “nRMSE” was less than 30 %, making the model suitable for simulating
    summer maize growth in the region. The ensemble Kalman filter algorithm was used
    to assimilate remote sensing data with the WOFOST model based on the differences
    in LAI under different treatments. Different LAI values had varying effects on
    the model''s final simulated yield, and the accuracy of yield simulation improved
    for all assimilation treatments, indicating that remote sensing data assimilation
    effectively corrected the model''s yield simulation results. The study also analyzed
    the influence of different assimilation frequencies and assimilation periods on
    yield simulation, revealing that the optimal assimilation frequency should be
    at least three times, and assimilating during the flowering to filling stage of
    summer maize resulted in better yield simulation results. Finally, the ensemble
    Kalman filter algorithm was used to assimilate current remote sensing observation
    data with 33 years of historical meteorological data from the Yangling Meteorological
    Station to predict crop yield. Under different treatments, the relative error
    between predicted and measured yield was less than 5 %. The yield prediction on
    September 6th showed higher accuracy compared to predictions from other dates,
    with N1 and N2 treatments having relative errors less than 1 %. As the prediction
    time progressed, the coefficient of variation of yield predictions gradually decreased,
    with the CK treatment on September 21st having the smallest coefficient of variation
    at 0.69. For further research on yield prediction, high-precision meteorological
    forecasts can be used to fill in unknown meteorological data, creating a three-part
    composite meteorological data, “measured data + short-term high-precision meteorological
    forecast + historical meteorological data,” to drive the crop model and improve
    the accuracy and timeliness of yield predictions. CRediT authorship contribution

  description: Surface soil moisture (SSM) information could have important applications
    in agricultural and regional water management. Remote sensing, particularly synthetic
    aperture radar (SAR), is an important technology for the estimation of spatial–temporal
    SSM over larger areas. Using Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 data, this research developed
    a general spatial–temporal constrained machine-learning-based method for surface
    soil moisture mapping over agricultural regions. Central to this method is the
    construction of spatial and temporal constraints and their implementation in machine-learning
    models. We first defined the spatial and temporal constraints for SSM estimation
    by investigating the spatial division of cultivated crop types and the temporal
    division of cumulative precipitation. Second, under the presumption that the SSM
    and associated variables are smoothly changing, we extracted the temporal difference
    variables from the multi-temporal remote sensing data. Finally, we incorporated
    two constraints as categorical features and temporal differences into a CatBoost-based
    model to improve surface soil moisture mapping. We verified the proposed model
    in a Spain study area with multi-temporal remote sensing observations. The experimental
    results after incorporating the spatial–temporal constraints demonstrate the efficacy
    of the proposed model for mapping surface soil moisture over agricultural regions,
    with significantly improved R2 = 0.7328, RMSE = 0.0451 vol, and MAE = 0.0351 vol
    This study also concluded that using multiple polarization in the machine-learning-based
    method could reliably and accurately estimate surface soil moisture.

    constraintsSentinel-1Sentinel-2Machine learning 1. Introduction Surface soil moisture
    (SSM) is a significant driver of water and energy exchanges at the land surface
    (El Hajj et al., 2019, Qiu et al., 2022, Wang, et al., 2022b). Spatially detailed
    and continuous SSM information is essential for many fields including agriculture,
    meteorology, and hydrology with the applications (Kornelsen and Coulibaly, 2013,
    Palmisano et al., 2020, Satalino et al., 2013) of crop growth monitoring, weather
    forecasting, runoff, and evapotranspiration, etc. In general, SSM typically presents
    substantial temporal and spatial heterogeneity even at small scales (Tockner and
    Stanford, 2002). Traditional data acquisition with a single-point and in-situ
    measurement technique is limited and time-consuming, and they are not feasible
    for accurate and continuous SSM monitoring over larger areas (Sekertekin et al.,
    2020). Remote sensing technology can rapidly and efficiently obtain ground information
    over large areas, which allows for systematically mapping SSM spatiotemporal dynamics
    on either regional or global scales (Mohanty et al., 2017, Wang et al., 2023).
    Consequently, numerous techniques for SSM estimation based on optical and radar
    remote sensing data have been presented in previous studies. In particular, microwave
    remote sensing has day-and-night and all-weather advantages and is sensitive to
    variations in soil moisture content on the surface, even in the presence of vegetation
    cover. In addition, in comparison to passive microwave sensors, synthetic aperture
    radar (SAR) (such as Sentinel-1 and Chinese Gaofen-3 sensors) has relatively higher
    spatial resolution and is increasingly used in high-resolution surface soil moisture
    mapping (Das et al., 2019, Peng and Loew, 2017). Accurate soil moisture information
    depends on target parameters, namely surface roughness, vegetation cover, dielectric
    constant and topography (Ulaby et al., 1978), and radar configurations such as
    frequency, polarization, and incidence angle. Considering the aforementioned parameters,
    numerous researchers have developed physical (Chen et al., 2003, Fung et al.,
    1992), empirical (Zribi and Dechambre, 2003), or semi-empirical models (Baghdadi
    et al., 2016, Dubois et al., 1995, Oh, 2004) for the estimation of SSM over bare
    soil or sparsely vegetated surfaces. Due to the multiple scattering effects between
    the canopy and the soil surface, the estimation of SSM for vegetated areas is
    more complicated. The physical model of Michigan microwave canopy scattering (MIMICS)
    (Ulaby et al., 1990) and the semi-empirical water cloud model (WCM) (Attema and
    Ulaby, 1978), especially the latter, are the most widely used scattering models
    for SSM estimation in vegetated areas from SAR observation. Furthermore, vegetation
    or canopy information required by these models, can be retrived from optical satellite
    (such as Landsat and Sentinel-2) images (Lievens and Verhoest, 2011, Prakash et
    al., 2011, Wang and Gao, 2023, Wang, et al., 2022b). These models have specific
    physical significance and certain statistical laws, which allow for excellent
    precision in previous studies (Kornelsen and Coulibaly, 2013). Nonetheless, radar
    signal is greatly affected by surface roughness and vegetation, whose influence
    is even greater than that of SM. Another significant difficulty in applying these
    models to estimate SSM is that it is challenging to mathematically simulate the
    complicated natural surface and accurately measure the associated variables, such
    as surface roughness parameters over large areas (Loew et al., 2006). Due to its
    capability to avoid complicated physical relationships and effectiveness in resolving
    nonlinear issues, the machine-learning method has recently gained popularity for
    soil moisture retrieval. Another advantage of machine learning is that the number
    of required parameters is not limited by the soil surface measures (Ali et al.,
    2015, Chen et al., 2021). Using machine-learning models, soil moisture has been
    effectively estimated across both bare ground and vegetated areas. Based on multi-band
    satellite data, (Zhang et al., 2015) estimated the soil moisture in bare cropland
    using the support vector regression (SVR). (Wang and Gao, 2023) developed two
    ensemble learning methods combined with the WCM to retrieve soil moisture over
    vegetated fields. Additionally, for SSM estimation in various geographical scenarios,
    the potential of different machine learning algorithms (such as artificial neural
    network, SVR, random forest regression, gradient boosting regression trees, etc.)
    was evaluated and compared (Adab et al., 2020, Chen et al., 2021, Pasolli et al.,
    2014, Wang et al., 2022a). In contrast to empirical, semi-empirical, and physically-based
    methods, these machine-learning methods presented sophisticated nonlinear fitting
    capabilities to estimate SSM, which also required more training samples to solve
    more undetermined parameters (Acharya et al., 2021, Ahmad et al., 2010, Araya
    et al., 2021, Dong et al., 2023). For instance, (Xu et al., 2019) found that machine-learning
    methods could only produce accurate soil moisture values when sufficient training
    data were available. Therefore, when applied to SSM estimation over large areas
    and extended periods, machine-learning methods confront a conundrum regarding
    training samples. One of the simplest methods to increase the number of available
    samples for machine-learning-based modeling is to expand the study area or extend
    the study period. This also increases spatial and temporal heterogeneity, which
    decreases the overall precision of SSM estimation. In contrast, machine-learning
    models developed for a localized, smaller area with limited training samples would
    overfit the study area and study period, resulting in poor spatiotemporal generalization
    for large-area applications. From a geographical perspective, the thematic map
    of cultivated crop types provides a comprehensive spatial delineation of soil,
    vegetation, and farming practices. In addition, from the standpoint of surface
    dynamics, the effects of precipitation on surface properties (such as surface
    roughness) and continuity of vegetation changes would serve as constraints for
    machine-learning-based SSM estimation. The question arises as to whether it is
    possible to incorporate spatial and temporal heterogeneity constraints into machine-learning
    methods to enhance the model''s performance and generalizability. Furthermore,
    there exist varying interpretations regarding the benefits of multi-polarization
    in traditional approaches. For instance, (Bao et al., 2018) found that, compared
    to the VH polarization, the VV polarization exhibited greater sensitivity to soil
    moisture and yielded more precise soil moisture estimation. While, (Pasolli et
    al., 2014) indicated that the VH polarization was more sensitive to soil moisture
    than the VV polarization. In addition, using multiple polarizations has been proposed
    to reduce the uncertainties in soil moisture retrieval (Santi et al., 2019). However,
    (Baghdadi et al., 2016) observed that the utilization of dual-polarization or
    full-polarization modes did not yield superior soil moisture estimation compared
    to the use of HH polarization alone. Therefore, we question the efficacy of multi-polarization
    in SSM mapping based on machine learning algorithms. This article aims to develop
    a general spatial–temporal constrained (STC) machine-learning-based method for
    surface soil moisture mapping over agricultural regions, in which Sentinel-1 SAR
    data and Sentinel-2 images are employed to measure surface scattering and vegetation
    information, respectively. Compared to previous approaches, this study combines
    three principal contributions. The first contribution is developing general spatial–temporal
    constraints to enhance the overall performance and generalization in SSM mapping.
    The second is incorporating the spatial–temporal constraints (as categorical features)
    into machine-learning-based SSM estimation. The third is the examination of polarization
    sensitivity for machine-learning-based SSM mapping. The proposed method is further
    discussed and validated by surface soil moisture mapping in a Spain study area
    with a multi-temporal dataset of Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 satellite data. 2.
    Study area and data collection 2.1. Study area To develop the machine-learning-based
    SSM estimation model under crop cover conditions, we conducted experiments on
    a study area located in the northwestern region of Spain, with central coordinates
    of 5°25ʹ and 41°15ʹN (as presented in Fig. 1). This study area is dominated by
    plateaus characterized by gentle slopes with elevations spanning from 700 m to
    900 m. The prevailing climate in the area is characterized as continental semiarid
    Mediterranean. The average air temperature ranges from 1 °C to 30 °C, while the
    average cumulative precipitation is estimated to be around 380 mm. The predominant
    land use is agriculture, as depicted in Fig. 1. The crops grown include cereals,
    maize, sugar beet, olive trees, vineyards, and other similar crops, which make
    it an ideal location to evaluate the efficacy of the proposed method. Furthermore,
    the study area is equipped with REMEDHUS (Castilla Leon, Spain) network (see Fig.
    1). This network has been specifically built for soil moisture monitoring missions
    (Dall''Amico et al., 2011). The hydrologic network comprising 19 stations that
    continuously measure surface soil moisture and temperature, is distributed across
    the study area. Download : Download high-res image (749KB) Download : Download

    use map. 2.2. Data and preprocessing To construct a general machine-learning-based
    model for SSM retrieval, multi-source data were gathered and subjected to preprocessing.
    These included Sentinel-1 (S1) data, Sentinel-2 (S2) images, satellite precipitation
    (SP) data, digital elevation model (DEM) data, cultivation crop type (CT) data,
    and in-situ surface soil moisture measure (IS) data. The backscatter coefficients
    of the VH and VV polarizations were retrieved using Sentinel-1 data. Sentinel-2
    images were used to obtain vegetation canopy properties. The spatial and temporal
    constraints were informed by the SP and CT data. And, the Shuttle Radar Topography
    Mission (SRTMGL1) Digital Elevation Model (DEM) with a spatial resolution of 30
    m was used to derive local slope and aspect angles. 1) In situ surface soil moisture.

    cm and store the readings at hourly intervals. The 5-cm SSM measurements are representative
    of a soil depth ranging from 1 cm to 9 cm, which aligns with the penetration depth
    of the C-band (5.405 GHz) SAR signal. Additionally, in-situ SSM measurements were
    performed within a 2-hour window with respect to the Sentinel-1 acquisition time.
    These measurements were regarded as the ground truth in SSM models. In order to
    ensure the accuracy and reliability of in-situ measurements, the acquired data
    have been examined for completeness, correctness, and consistency, based on their
    quality flags. The recorders that exhibited conspicuous omissions and anomalous
    values were excluded from the subsequent experiments. 2) Sentinel-1 data. The
    C-band backscatter observations are obtained by Sentinel-1 satellites, and this
    study employed the level-1 ground range detected (GRD) dual-polarization (including
    the VV and VH polarizations) products in the Interferometric Wide (IW) swath mode.
    The spatial resolution of the Sentinel-1 data is 20 m, and the temporal resolution
    is 6 days. A total of 26 Sentinel-1 GRD data with Path/Frame values of 154/456
    and 154/454 available in the temporal range of March 01–July 30, 2021, were obtained
    from the Copernicus Open Access Hub. To further enhance the accuracy of the observations,
    the downloaded GRD data were first subjected to preprocessing using the SNAP software,
    including (1) orbital correction, (2) thermal noise removal, (3) radiometric calibration,
    (4) speckle filtering using the refined Lee algorithm, (5) terrain correction
    (Range Doppler Terrain Correction), and (6) geocoding. For visualizing a large
    dynamic range, the radar backscattering coefficient was converted into decibels
    (dB). Then, the processed data was geometrically corrected with 10 ground control
    points (GCPs) in reference to the 10 m band of the Sentinel-2 image acquired on
    July 5, 2021, over the study area. An overall root means square error (RMSE) of
    less than one pixel was achieved. Finally, we obtained multi-temporal Sentinel-1
    data with VH and VV bands and a 20 m spatial resolution in the WGS 1984 Universal
    Transverse Mercator (UTM) coordinates. 3) Sentinel-2 images. Multi-spectral Sentinel-2
    images captured during the Sentinel-1 observation were utilized to mitigate the
    impact of vegetation on SSM estimation in agricultural regions. With a 5-day repeat
    cycle, the Sentinel-2 satellites (Drusch et al., 2012) provide images with 13
    spectral bands in the visible, near-infrared, and short-wave infrared parts of
    the electromagnetic spectrum. The resolution is 10 m, 20 m, or 60 m, depending
    on the spectral band. The Sentinel-2 Level-2A (bottom of atmosphere reflectance)
    product has been collected and then processed to derive vegetation indices. Sentinel-2
    images are not captured simultaneously with Sentinel-1 data. Further, this study
    found that only approximately 48 % of the Sentinel-2 images are available after
    masking out the cloud shadow, medium, and high probability clouds. Consequently,
    to provide vegetation data concurrently with Sentinel-1 data, we had to interpolate
    the Sentinel-2 vegetation estimates. For each analyzed pixel, to obtain the vegetation
    information at the data of Sentinel-1 acquisition, a linear interpolation was
    conducted, utilizing the vegetation values that corresponded to the Sentinel-2
    images captured before and after the Sentinel-1 acquisition date (Benninga et
    al., 2022). 4) Satellite precipitation data. The PERSIANN-CCS satellite precipitation
    daily product (Sadeghi et al., 2021), which has a spatial resolution of 4 km,
    was utilized to establish temporal constraints. The downloaded product was first
    spatially projected and resampled (using a bilinear interpolation algorithm) into
    Sentinel-2 pixel grids. Then, for a specific Sentinel-1 acquisition date, we calculated
    the cumulative precipitation during the repeat cycle (in the last 6 days) since
    the previous acquisition. Finally, the cumulative precipitation was then utilized
    as a dynamic variable for the subsequent SSM retrieval. 5) Cultivated crop type.
    In Spain, SIGPAC provides annually updated cultivated crop types for agricultural
    parcels (Sitokonstantinou et al., 2018). These agricultural parcels are classified
    into various categories such as garden lands, grasslands, farmlands, bare lands,
    and others. In this study, SSM estimation was restricted to areas covered by the
    main cultivated types (including vineyard, pasture, and crop), excluding water
    bodies, forests, urban and building areas, and classes with very-low representativeness.
    3. Methodology This study established general spatial and temporal constraints
    for enhancing machine-learning-based SSM mapping using Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2
    data over agricultural regions. The method consists of three primary stages (as
    shown in Fig. 2): (1) the preprocessing of multi-temporal data, (2) the formulation
    of spatial–temporal constraints and feature sets, and (3) the implementation a
    CatBoost-based model for SSM estimations. Firstly, multi-source data were preprocessed
    to produce various variables and features associated with SSM estimation. These
    features encompassed backscatter coefficients, vegetation indices, and terrain
    properties. Then, based on assumptions regarding spatial and temporal constraints,
    we further generated temporal and spatial categorical features, as well as temporal
    difference features, to establish a comprehensive feature set for SSM mapping.
    Finally, taking the in-situ SSM as ground truth, we developed a CatBoost-based
    estimation model for multi-temporal SSM mapping. Download : Download high-res

    soil moisture mapping over agricultural regions. 3.1. Model for SSM mapping 1)
    Variables and features. In radar scattering over vegetation regions, the total
    backscattering σ0 (in m2/m−2(−|-)) is composed of the following three contributions:
    where is the two-way vegetation transmissivity (=1–two-way attenuation). is the
    scattering from the soil surface, represents the scattering due to the vegetation
    canopy, and represents the interaction between the vegetation canopy and the soil
    underneath and accounts for multiple scattering effects. Generally, for vegetation
    regions, the vegetation-soil interactions can be neglected (Attema and Ulaby,
    1978). In the water cloud model (Attema and Ulaby, 1978), the vegetation is represented
    as a homogeneous horizontal cloud of identical water spheres, uniformly distributed
    throughout the space defined by the soil surface and the vegetation height. And
    the vegetation height is assumed to be directly proportional to the water content
    of vegetation volume. Moreover, the transmissivity of the canopy is related to
    the number of scatters, which can be described by the total amount of water in
    the canopy. Therefore, canopy water content is an important variable in SSM estimation
    radar backscattering over vegetated areas. Previous studies have suggested that
    the vegetation indices derived from satellite observation could be used for vegetation
    water content estimation (Cheng et al., 2008). The vegetation indices commonly
    used for vegetation water content estimation include NDVI (Prakash et al., 2011),
    EVI (Bai et al., 2015), NDWI (Jackson et al., 1999), etc. Additional analyses
    and comparisons on the efficacy of these vegetation indices can be found in studies
    by (Bao et al., 2018, Lievens and Verhoest, 2011, Rao et al., 2022, Wang, et al.,
    2022b). In this study, to achieve a more comprehensive representation of the vegetation
    canopy (water content), we employed 5 vegetation indices, including canopy water
    content (CWC), leaf area index (LAI), normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI),
    fraction of photosynthetically active radiation absorbed (FAPAR), and fraction
    of vegetation cover (FCOVER). More details can be found at Terrascope. Moreover,
    angles are significant variables in radar scattering. For instance, the incident
    direction and the local surface direction are employed in the correction of the
    Sentinel-1 backscatter. And in the water cloud model, the incident angle is also
    utilized to calculate vegetation scattering and transmissivity. Thus, in this
    study, the local incident angle of Sentinel-1 observations was extracted to determine
    the direction of radar observations. In addition, we derived the local slope and
    aspect from the DEM data, as the orientation of the observed surface. 2) Spatial
    constraints. Typically, it is assumed that the canopy water content is related
    to the stem volume, leaf area, and branch structure (Manninen et al., 2021). And,
    the domain scattering component of canopies may vary for different types of vegetation.
    For example, sugar beet is characterized by large leaves, randomly orientated,
    which is dominated by volume scattering, but wheat is dominated by surface scattering
    (Palmisano et al., 2020). There are, of course, numerous other variables associated
    with radar backscattering over vegetated areas that vary according to geography
    or farming type, such as soil texture, soil surface roughness, etc. Therefore,
    it is not rational to keep these variables constant for SSM retrieval over large
    regions. Moreover, it is widely acknowledged that acquiring precise measurements
    for these variables across extensive regions is a challenging task. Inspired by
    the vegetation type classification used in the water cloud model (Bindlish and
    Barros, 2001), we tried to divide the study area into distinct sub-areas by crop
    types, each of which was associated with a crop type. So, regions with the same
    crop types would share the same backscattering mechanism and parameters. Thus,
    these crop types were subsequently employed as spatial constraints in SSM estimation.
    Since the crop type was categorical variable and spatially varying, it was referred
    to as spatial categorical feature. To incorporate the spatial constraint into
    machine-learning-based models for SSM estimation, we first overlay the crop type
    map onto the pixel grids to determine their crop types. Then, the crop type was
    taken as a categorical feature and added into feature sets of pixel grids. Experiments
    were conducted in Section 4.2 to demonstrate the benefit of spatial constraints.
    3) Temporal constraints. In radar backscattering over agricultural areas, multi-temporal
    S2-based features can be employed to measure the dynamic process of the vegetation
    canopy. Surface soil properties are subject to temporal changes due to farming
    activities such as tillage and irrigation, as well as precipitation. Especially,
    precipitation events would change the surface roughness (Bullard et al., 2018).
    The previous machine-learning-based approaches were not suitable for this scenario,
    as they assumed that soil properties remained constant (Ali et al., 2015, Chen
    et al., 2021). Following a similar procedure to spatial constraints, we attempted
    to construct temporal constraints for machine-learning-based models, based on
    precipitation events. Firstly, the satellite precipitation daily data was overlaid
    onto pixel grids to extract the corresponding time-series precipitation volume.
    Then, the cumulative amount of precipitation was computed over a six-day imaging
    interval of Sentinel-1 satellites. The imaging date was deemed a temporal change
    point if its periodical cumulative precipitation surpassed a certain threshold.
    Next, multiple change points were identified, resulting in the division of the
    time series into several sub-series. These sub-series were sequentially assigned
    a categorical code ti (i = 1,…, n, with n representing the total number of sub-series).
    Finally, the categorical code was taken as a temporal variable (also referred
    to as temporal categorical feature) and added into feature sets of pixel grids.
    In this study, a threshold of 100 mm was employed for the sake of simplicity.
    It divided the study period into two sub-periods, with the division on June 5
    (Fig. 3-b). Download : Download high-res image (1MB) Download : Download full-size

    Fig. 3. Multi-temporal SSM mapping resulted from the proposed STC-CatBoost model.
    4) Temporal differences. The state of surface soil moisture (SSM) is the consequence
    of the preceding state and its environment variables. On the assumption that the
    state and variables are temporally continuous, incorporating the previous state
    into models will enhance their prediction performance, which is a valuable technique
    in process modeling and prediction (Liu and Liu, 2021, Sodhi et al., 2020). In
    addition, influenced by research on smoothness constraints (Lassance et al., 2021,
    Liu et al., 2022), this study would use the temporal differences of dynamic S1-
    and S2-based features to enhance the SSM estimation. For each observation of SSM,
    we first calculated the variable difference between the previous and the current
    observations and then incorporated these differences (as independent features)
    into the machine-learning-based model. In Subsection 4.2, the advantages were
    discussed. 5) CatBoost-based model. Gradient Boosting Decision Tree (GBDT) is
    a potent supervised learning technology that attempts to accurately predict a
    target variable by combining the estimates of a collection of simpler and weaker
    models. CatBoost is a widely-used and efficient implementation of the GBDT algorithm,
    originally introduced by researchers of Yandex (Prokhorenkova et al., 2018). Owing
    to its increased flexibility in usage and enhanced performance, CatBoost has been
    effectively implemented across various fields, such as time-series forecasting,
    wheat yield prediction (Uribeetxebarria et al., 2023), and soil moisture estimation
    (Yu et al., 2022). In comparison to other GBDT algorithms, CatBoost possesses
    certain advantages. The CatBoost algorithm employs ordered boosting to address
    the issues of gradient bias and estimation bias in previous GBDT-based algorithms.
    This approach effectively reduces the occurrence of overfitting and enhances the
    algorithm''s capacity for generalization. CatBoost is innovative for categorical
    features analysis, can handle both general numerical and categorical features
    (without encoding) simultaneously. Additionally, CatBoost can also handle missing
    values in the data without the need for imputation techniques. Because of the
    advantages of CatBoost and its rare application in soil moisture estimation, this
    study attempted to employ the CatBoost algorithm to model the relationship between
    SSM with its associated variables. Furthermore, we took the above spatial and
    temporal constraints as categorical features and directly fed them into the CatBoost
    algorithm, to construct a spatial–temporal constraint CatBoost (STC-CatBoost)
    model for SSM estimation. 3.2. Model training and prediction Table 1 presents
    a summary of the related variables and features used for STC-CatBoost SSM estimation.
    The samples used for model training and validation consist of in-situ observed
    soil moisture (SSM) and associated features. These features include not only traditional
    features (such as NDVI, slope, and VH) but also spatial categorical features (derived
    from crop type maps) and temporal categorical features (derived from precipitation
    data). Table 1. SSM dataset containing in-situ observation and related features.

    G Surface soil moisture In-situ observation A total of 396 observation samples
    were collected within the study area during the period of March 1 to July 30,
    2021. These samples were randomly split into the training set, validation set,
    and testing set, with a ratio of 6:2:2. In the training stage, the Grid Search
    technique with training and validation set was utilized to optimize the hyper-parameters
    of the CatBoost algorithm. Then, in the testing stage, the trained model was examined
    using the testing set, by the evaluation metrics. We would replicate each experiment
    10 times and calculate the mean and standard deviation of their metric scores.
    It was noted that the similar procedure with other machine-learning-based models
    (Prokhorenkova et al., 2018, Santi et al., 2019, Wang and Gao, 2023) was adopted
    for training and testing the proposed STC-CatBoost model. 3.3. Performance evaluation
    1) Baseline methods. To assess the benefits of the proposed spatial and temporal
    constraints for SSM mapping, we also construct a baseline method. It followed
    the same procedure, but employed only the features (A, B, C) listed in Table 1.
    2) Evaluation metrics. The Sentinel-1 SSM retrievals were evaluated against their
    in-situ references with the coefficient of determination (R2), the root mean square
    error (RMSE), and the mean absolute error (MAE), which are defined as follows:
    where is the measured SSM value, is the model-estimated SSM value, is the arithmetic
    mean of all the measured SSM values, and n is the number of samples. In general,
    a higher R2 value and lower RMSE and MAP values indicate a better model performance.
    4. Experiments and discussions The proposed CatBoost-based (STC-CatBoost) model
    for SSM mapping was evaluated and validated in the Spain study area with multi-temporal
    data. 4.1. Experiment results 1) Spatial-temporal SSM mapping. Using the proposed
    STC-CatBoost method, the time-series SSM maps for the study area were generated,
    as presented in Fig. 3. The maps exhibited significant spatial heterogeneity in
    surface soil moisture (Fig. 3-a). The surface soil moisture in the northern and
    central regions is comparatively higher due to increased groundwater recharge
    and greater availability of irrigation, particularly in the bed areas of rivers.
    While a decrease in soil moisture was observed in the southwestern and central
    highlands. Then, let’s focus on the local details in sub-regions A (Fig. 3-b)
    in the center of the study area. It was observed that the SMM varied depending
    on the type of crop. The pasture land has the highest surface soil moisture, followed
    by the croplands, while the vineyard has the lowest. A detailed examination of
    time-series SSM maps within Region A (as presented in Fig. 3-b) is warranted.
    In general, temporal changes in soil moisture have gone through five stages. During
    the period of March 13–25, reduced levels of SSM were attributed to insufficient
    precipitation. In April, there was less but relatively even precipitation, which
    maintained (or slightly increased) the level of surface moisture. Despite sporadic
    precipitation in May, the loss of SSM is due to the increasing temperatures and
    evapotranspiration. The two precipitations that occurred on June 5 and June 17
    alleviated the drought, and SSM progressively increased. Since then (June 29 to
    July 23), the area has experienced a progressive drought as a result of insufficient
    precipitation. The proposed method was quantitatively assessed by comparing the
    estimated SSM with the in-situ observation. The evaluation scores are presented
    in Table 2. In summary, the proposed method presented superior estimation performance,
    with R2 scores of 0.7328, RMSE scores of 0.0451, and MAE scores of 0.0351. Moreover,
    evaluation was performed across various crop types. The results indicated that
    the vineyard achieved the highest level of precision, followed by the pasture
    land, and the croplands performed the worst. One potential explanation is that
    the cropland contained more subtypes (such as irrigated and rainfed lands) and
    presented greater intraclass heterogeneity, in contrast to the vineyard and pasture
    lands. In addition, we contrasted the SSM estimation scores from the two sub-periods
    and found that the second sub-period achieved higher evaluation scores. Based
    on the analysis of precipitation patterns, it can be inferred that the first sub-period
    experienced more precipitation events, which caused changes in the properties
    of the soil surface. Table 2. Performance indices for SSM estimation using the
    proposed STC-CatBoost method. Whole area: scores for the whole study area and

    0.0342 0.0326 0.0325 2) Feature importance in SSM mapping. Based on the trained
    STC-Catboost SSM model, the importance of associated features (Prokhorenkova et
    al., 2018) for SSM estimation was calculated, as shown in Fig. 4. It was found
    that the VV and VH features held the highest importance in SSM mapping, with importance
    scores of 0.23 and 0.15, respectively. This is to be expected given that they
    provided the primary information for SAR-based SSM estimation, which is consistent
    with these physical and empirical models. Subsequently, it was observed that the
    LIA (local incident angle), crop type, slope, and aspect demonstrated importance
    levels exceeding 0.05. When analyzing these variables thoroughly, we found that
    the LIA, slope, and aspect were related to angles, indicating an understanding
    or modeling of the relative position or direction between the radar signal and
    surface in the SSM estimation. Unexpectedly, the crop type feature (as a categorical
    feature) achieved the fourth-highest importance score of 0.13, demonstrating the
    benefit of the proposed spatial constraints. The S2-based features presented relatively
    low importance scores, with values ranging between 0.01 and 0.04. This could be
    due to the use of multiple vegetation indices with a strong correlation, thereby
    dispersing and reducing the importance of a single S2-based vegetation feature
    (in fact, the total importance score of S2-based features was up to 0.12). Similar
    to the S2-based features, the importance of a single difference feature was lower,
    but their total importance score was 0.08. Download : Download high-res image

    SSM estimation. 4.2. Discussions 1) Spatial and temporal constraints. To evaluate
    the effectiveness of spatial and temporal constraints in the CatBoost-based model
    for SSM estimation, a series of four ablation experiments were conducted. These
    experiments included one that utilized both spatial and temporal constraints (S
    + T), one that solely employed the spatial constraints (S), one that solely employed
    the temporal constraints (T), and one that did not employ any constraints (as
    the baseline). The evaluation scores were presented in Table 3. Table 3. Performance
    improvement on SSM mapping using spatial and temporal constraints. Empty Cell
    S + T S T Baseline R2 0.7328±0.0084 0.6927±0.0188 0.6872±0.0213 0.6541±0.4197
    RMSE 0.0451±0.0007 0.0483±0.0015 0.0488±0.0017 0.0507±0.0034 MAE 0.0351±0.0006
    0.0380±0.0015 0.0377±0.0015 0.0380±0.0030 In general, both spatial and temporal
    constraints have been found to enhance the performance of surface soil moisture
    retrieval, as compared to the results in the baseline experiment. Especially,
    when utilizing both the spatial and temporal constraints in the CatBoost-based
    model, the S + T experiment achieved the best performance, with improvements of
    0.080 in the R2 score, 0.005 in the RMSE score, and 0.003 in the MAE score, respectively.
    In addition, we discovered that the spatial and temporal constraints also resulted
    in decreased standard deviations of evaluation scores, which can be regarded as
    uncertainties in SSM estimation. These were expected because, from the perspective
    of geospatial analysis, the STC-CatBoost method could construct more accurate
    local fittings (on every spatial and temporal division) to accomplish higher overall
    accuracy by introducing the spatial and temporal (heterogeneity) features. From
    the view of machine learning, spatial and temporal constraints provided more effective
    variables (with higher scores in feature importance, as discussed in Subsection
    4.1) for model fitting. We also noticed the S and T experiments achieved similar
    performance, in evaluation scores and their standard deviations. It was concluded
    that the incorporation of spatial and temporal constraints can lead to a significant
    improvement in accuracy and a reduction in uncertainty when estimating SSM. 2)
    Temporal differences. To examine the benefits of incorporating temporal differences
    of variables/features for SSM estimation, we carried out three comparative experiments,
    including an experiment (D0) that did not involve temporal differences of features,
    an experiment (D2) that solely incorporated differences of S2-based features,
    and an experiment (D1D2) that incorporated both differences from S1 and S2 data.
    Their performance accuracy was detailed in Table 4. Table 4. Performance scores
    using temporal differences. Empty Cell Without delta (D0) delta on S2 features
    (D2) delta on S1 & S2 features (D1D2) R2 0.6952±0.0188 0.7328±0.0084 0.6769±0.0204
    RMSE 0.0481±0.0015 0.0451±0.0007 0.0496±0.0016 MAE 0.0385±0.0014 0.0351±0.0006
    0.0389±0.0015 Comparing the D0 to the D2 experiments, we found that incorporating
    the differences of S2-based features significantly improved the R2 score by 0.040,
    the RMSE score by 0.003, and the MAE score by 0.003. We argued that, because vegetation
    growth and change are gradual, the S2-based difference features impose smoothness
    and continuity constraints on the parameter space and model mapping, resulting
    in better model fitting. While, further adding the S1-based difference features
    to the CatBoost-based model resulted in a significant reduction in accuracy, as
    measured by R2 score of 0.6769, RMSE score of 0.0496, and MAE score of 0.03. This
    performance was even worse than that of the D0 experiment. The possible reason
    was that the S1-based features have greater volatility, compared to the S2-based
    features. The inconsistency between the smoothness and continuity constraints
    and the actual properties of S1-based features led to local overfitting and poor
    performance. To test this hypothesis, the standard deviations of the S1-based
    and S2-based features (using delta_VV and delta_CWC, respectively) were calculated
    and contrasted. Firstly, pixel-wise observations with S1- and S2-based difference
    features were spatially and temporally randomly selected. Then, by dividing the
    standard deviation (eliminating their metric discrepancies) of VV and CWC, respectively,
    we were able to derive their normalized differences (std_delta_VV and std_delta_CWC,
    respectively). Finally, we draw the scatterplot between std_delta_VV (with an
    average value of 0.6108) and std_delta_CWC (with an average value of 1.3230) (as
    presented in Fig. 5). It was obvious that the VV feature presented a greater temporal
    variability, than the CWC features. Download : Download high-res image (87KB)

    3) Sentinel-1 polarization sensitivity for SM mapping. To evaluate the effectiveness
    of multi-polarization in the proposed STC-CatBoost model for SSM mapping, we conducted
    comparative experiments using the VH polarization, the VV polarization, and a
    combination of both VH and VV polarizations (VH + VV). Their performance accuracy
    was presented in Table 5. Table 5. Performance scores using different polarizations.
    Empty Cell VH VV VH + VV R2 0.7165±0.0254 0.7173±0.0186 0.7328±0.0084 RMSE 0.0464±0.0021
    0.0463±0.0015 0.0451±0.0007 MAE 0.0356±0.0025 0.0351±0.0015 0.0351±0.0006 In general,
    the combined use of the VH and VV polarizations achieved the greatest performance,
    compared to the VH and VV polarizations. This was expected since multi-polarization
    provided more efficient measures (with greater feature importance) on the surface
    soil moisture. The VH + VV polarizations also achieved the lowest standard deviation
    of evaluation scores, indicating higher credibility in the estimated surface soil
    moisture. This is consistent with Santi’s study (Santi et al., 2019). We also
    observed that the VH and VV polarization obtain nearly identical performance with
    very similar R2, RMSE, and MAE values. While the VV polarization produced a smaller
    standard deviation than the VH polarization. This suggested that VV-based SSM
    estimation is more reliable than VH-based, which was consistent with Bao’s studies
    (Bao et al., 2018). Thus, we could conclude that (1) the combined use of VH and
    VV polarizations is a better configuration for machine-learning-based SSM estimation.
    And, (2) the VV polarization could provide a more stable SSM estimation than the
    VH polarization. 5. Conclusion Surface Soil Moisture (SSM) is an essential variable
    in applications of agricultural and regional water management. Remote sensing,
    particularly Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR), is an important and widely used technology
    for the estimation of spatial–temporal SSM over larger areas. In this study, we
    developed a general spatial–temporal constrained machine-learning-based method
    for surface soil moisture mapping over agricultural regions, using multi-temporal
    Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 data. The key to this method is the construction of
    spatial and temporal constraints and their implementation in machine-learning-based
    models. The method was validated in the Spain study area with multi-temporal Sentinel-1
    data, Sentinel-2 images, and satellite precipitation data. The estimated SSM using
    spatial and temporal constraints, showing a more significant improvement compared
    to the existing (baseline) method, demonstrated the effectiveness of the proposed
    method in SSM mapping over agricultural regions. Therefore, we argued that the
    proposed STC-CatBoost model is effective and valuable for estimating SSM using
    remote sensing data. From further discussions on the effectiveness of the spatial
    and temporal constraints, the advantages of the temporal difference features,
    and the sensitivity of multiple polarizations, this study reaches the following
    conclusions: (1) both spatial and temporal constraints can effectively improve
    accuracy and reduce the uncertainty of SSM estimation; (2) the S2-based difference
    variables are effective to estimate SSM, while the S1-based differences are negative;
    (3) the combined use of multiple polarizations could enhance the reliability of
    SSM mapping. These conclusions will further guide the construction and application
    of machine-learning-based models for surface soil moisture mapping in future work.

  description: Surface Water Mapping (SWM) is essential for studying hydrological
    and ecological phenomena. SWM holds significant importance in water resource management,
    environmental conservation, and disaster preparation. Recently, rapid urbanization,
    overutilization, and environmental degradation have seriously impacted surface
    water bodies. Rapid advancement in remote sensing data and technologies has promoted
    the SWM to a new era. Timely and precise SWM is crucial for water resource preservation
    and planning. This paper critically reviews the extraction of surface water bodies
    from optical sensors using Spectral Indices (SI), Machine Learning (ML), Deep
    Learning (DL), and Spectral unmixing with a comprehensive overview of satellite
    data, study areas, methodologies, results, advantages, and disadvantages, especially
    over the last decade. The extensive review of SWM reveals that DL outperforms
    ML and SI. DL outperforms other methods because it incorporates crucial elements
    in network design, like skip connections, dilation convolution, attention mechanisms,
    and residual blocks. The spectral unmixing addresses the mixed pixel misclassification
    problem. Some SI, ML, and DL methods are implemented, and the results are discussed.
    Integrating the DL technique with spectral unmixing, fusing multisource data (SAR
    and optical) and integrating it with ancillary data (DEM) is the future direction
    for improved SWM.

    Recently, rapid urbanization, overutilization, and environmental degradation have

    crucial for water resource preservation and planning. This paper critically reviews
    the extraction of surface water bodies from optical sensors using Spectral Indices

    a precious and finite resource essential for maintaining ecosystems and biodiversity,
    supporting economics, and promoting global human development (Karpatne et al.
    2016). It serves various purposes in society, including drinking water supply,
    irrigation, industrial processes, hydropower generation, climate regulation, tourism,
    and other vital functions (Vörösmarty et al. 2010; Vorosmarty et al. 2000). Surface
    water bodies, encompassing lakes, ponds, rivers, reservoirs, wetlands, seas, and
    oceans, store water on Earth''s surface. Seas and oceans are distinct due to their
    high salinity compared to other freshwater bodies. The water in surface water
    bodies is dynamic over time due to natural and human-induced factors, reflecting
    its diverse roles in society. Natural factors influencing surface water bodies
    include precipitation, climate change, evaporation, floods, and drought. On the
    other hand, human-induced factors, such as deforestation, urban expansion, waste
    disposal, illegal water abstraction, excessive irrigation, and industrial practices,
    significantly affect these surface water bodies (Vorosmarty et al. 2000). The
    blue region indicates areas where land has transformed into water, whereas the
    green areas indicate regions where water has transformed into land from 1985–2015
    (Donchyts et al. 2016) (shown in Fig. 1). Fig. 1 Land and water dynamics through
    Heat map (Donchyts et al. 2016) Full size image Accurate water body extraction
    provides valuable insights into their extent and dynamics, which are crucial in
    effective water management. Traditionally, the water extent of surface water bodies
    was measured through direct field observations (Field Surveys with Global Positioning
    Systems (GPS) and hydrological measurements (Hydrological Gauges)). Although these
    techniques are accurate, their labor-intensive, time-consuming nature and spatial
    and temporal limitations have prompted the exploration of alternative technologies.
    After field surveying, aerial photography (images captured by cameras fixed in
    airplanes) was used for surface water body extraction. However, it has limited
    coverage, weather dependency, requires high costs and resources, and limited accessibility
    to remote areas. Remote Sensing (RS) technologies offer a transformative solution
    by visually representing the Earth''s surface. Technological advancements in satellite
    sensors (Kosari et al. 2020), encompassing optical (multispectral and hyperspectral
    (Ghaderizadeh et al. 2022)) and microwave (Sharifi et al. 2015) (Synthetic Aperture
    Radar (SAR)) enable the acquisition of detailed information about the Earth''s
    surface (Huang et al. 2018). The comprehensive coverage and frequent observation
    capabilities of satellite images make them invaluable for various applications
    such as agriculture monitoring (Zamani et al. 2022), forest biomass estimation
    (Sharifi and Amini, 2015; Sharifi et al. 2016), oil pollution detection (Mohammadi
    et al. 2021), and flood assessment (Tariq et al. 2022; Sharifi, 2021). The information
    about the optical and microwave sensors is explained next. The RS images are captured
    by two different sensors, namely, microwave and optical sensors. The microwave
    sensor uses microwave radiation (longer than visible light) to obtain the features
    of the Earth''s surface (Schumann and Moller, 2015). The optical sensor uses solar
    radiation to collect the features of the Earth''s surface. The optical sensor
    offers advantages over microwave sensors, such as higher spatial resolution, color
    and topographic information, easy calibration and validation, and cost-effectiveness.
    Despite having more advantages, the optical sensors provide images only during
    the daytime and are sensitive to atmospheric interference, such as clouds and
    haze. The selection of optical or Microwave sensors is contingent upon the specific
    objectives of the RS application and the natural characteristics of the study
    region. Combining the Digital Elevation Model (DEM) with satellite images also
    provides accurate water body extraction. With the massive amount of RS data, advanced
    processing technology is required to significantly enhance the efficiency and
    accuracy of water body extraction from RS datasets. The various techniques used
    for Surface Water Mapping (SWM) from the optical sensors are the primary focus
    of this article. A brief review of sensors used for surface water body extraction
    is covered in section \"Sensors used in Surface Water Body Extraction\". Section
    \"Surface Water Mapping Techniques\" provides a review of SWM using spectral indices,
    ML techniques, DL techniques, Transformation and optimization methods, and Spectral
    unmixing. The experimental results and discussions of a few spectral indices,
    ML, and DL techniques for SWM are provided in section \"Experiment Results and
    Discussions\". Section \"Summary and Challenges\" summarizes the SWM methods and
    challenges. Finally, the conclusions are drawn, and the direction of future research
    is identified in section \"Conclusion and Future scope\". Sensors used in Surface
    Water Body Extraction Spatial, temporal, spectral, and radiometric resolution
    are critical aspects of optical sensors influencing the quality of RS imagery
    for various applications. Spatial resolution refers to the level of detail captured
    by the individual pixels (measured in meters (m)). The temporal resolution reflects
    the revisit time of the same observational area (measured in days). Spectral resolution
    signifies a sensor''s capability to record the Earth''s surface across varying
    wavelengths (expressed in the number of bands). The radiometric resolution refers
    to the amount of information captured and represented by each pixel. Optical images
    are categorized into coarse (>200m), medium (5m to 200m), and high resolution
    (<5m) based on spatial resolution. Coarse Spatial Resolution Sensors The coarse
    spatial resolution sensors acquire images with lower levels of detail, where each
    pixel covers a large surface area on the earth, offering high temporal resolution
    and broad coverage. They are suitable for monitoring regional patterns and large-scale
    events such as oceans, floods, and the atmosphere. Examples include Advanced Very
    High Resolution Radiometer onboard National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration
    satellites (NOAA/AVHRR) (Jain et al. 2006), Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer
    (MODIS) (Feng et al. 2012), Suomi National Polar-orbiting Partnership - Visible
    Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (Suomi NPP-VIIRS) (Huang et al. 2016), MEdium
    Resolution Imaging Spectrometer (MERIS), and Sentinel-3 Ocean and Land Color Instrument
    (OLCI). The characteristics of coarse spatial resolution sensors are outlined
    in Table 1. The medium spatial and high spatial resolution sensors used for SWM
    are provided in Tables 2 and 3, respectively. Table 1 Characteristics of coarse
    spatial resolution sensors Full size table Table 2 Characteristics of medium spatial
    resolution sensors Full size table Table 3 Characteristics of high spatial resolution
    sensors Full size table Medium Spatial Resolution Sensors The medium-resolution
    sensor balances spatial detail and coverage area, suitable for regional Land Use
    Land Cover (LULC) mapping, environmental monitoring, disaster management, agriculture
    and crop monitoring, and water resource management. Examples include Land Satellite
    (Landsat) (Corbane et al. 2019), Systeme Probatoire d’Observation dela Tarre (SPOT)
    (Zhang and Kerle, 2008), Advanced Spaceborne Thermal Emission and Reflection Radiometer
    (ASTER) (Perez-Planells et al. 2017), Sentinel-2A/2B (Zheng et al. 2018), and
    Linear Imaging Spectral Sensor -III (LISS-III) (Mukherjee et al. 2010). High Spatial
    Resolution Sensors High-resolution sensors provide fine spatial detail for local-scale
    LULC mapping, infrastructure analysis, and change detection. However, limitations
    such as reduced spectral information, coverage area, shadow problem, high atmospheric
    interference, and high costs restrict their universal usage. Examples are Quickbird
    (Xu et al. 2004), IKONOS (Sidle et al. 2007), Rapideye (Klemenjak et al. 2012),
    WorldView-2 (Malinowski et al. 2015), GaoFen (GF-1/2) (Zhang et al. 2014), and
    ZiYuan (ZY-3) (Li et al. 2016a). The False Color Composite (FCC) of Landsat 8
    OLI, Sentinel-2, and LISS-III (Medium resolution multispectral images) are depicted
    in Fig. 2. These images were captured over the Vaigai dam in the Theni district
    of Tamil Nadu, southern India. In FCC images, vegetation appears red, water bodies
    are dark blue, and urban areas have gray or pinkish hues. Fig. 2 FCC of Medium
    Resolution Satellite images; (a) Landsat 8 OLI image captured on 7th February,

    Types The Earth''s surface comprises diverse land cover types, each with unique
    reflectance characteristics influenced by sunlight interaction. Figure 3 illustrates
    the spectral reflectance of different land cover types (Chen et al. 2022). Fig.
    3 Spectral reflectance of Landcover types (Chen et al. 2022) Full size image Vegetation,
    including forests and grasslands, exhibits strong absorption in blue and red wavelengths
    due to the presence of chlorophyll and less absorption (high reflectance) in green
    wavelength (Green peak). Near Infrared (NIR) and Short Wave Infra Red (SWIR) wavelengths
    experience less absorption (high reflectance) in vegetation. Soil reflectance
    increases as wavelength extends from visible to infrared regions, depending on
    soil type, moisture content, organic matter, surface roughness, and lighting conditions.
    The water absorbs more radiation in blue wavelength due to water molecules and
    dissolved substances. However, the water reflectance increases in green wavelength
    compared to blue wavelength. The water absorbs more radiation in red than blue
    and green wavelengths. However, the high turbidity water has higher reflectance
    in red wavelength than non-turbid water. The water absorbs more infrared wavelengths
    (NIR and SWIR), resulting in low reflectance. The reflectance of other artificial
    materials, such as constructions, bridges, roads, etc., depends on the materials
    involved in the construction process (Chen et al. 2022). RGB images are not helpful
    in mapping surface objects due to limited spectral information (red, green, and
    blue). RS uses multispectral or hyperspectral imagery to overcome these constraints.
    RS data recorded in many spectral bands provides more spectral information for
    each pixel, which enables a more precise differentiation of materials and surface
    properties. Multispectral images acquire images beyond the RGB spectrum, including
    near-infrared, red-edge, and shortwave infrared bands. Hyperspectral images collect
    data in many contiguous narrow spectral regions for even higher resolution. The
    RS images with high spectral, spatial, and temporal resolution accurately map
    the surface land cover types. Surface Water Mapping Techniques The SWM of RS images
    was broadly classified into Spectral Indices (SI), Machine Learning (ML), Deep
    Learning (DL), and Spectral unmixing. This paper extensively reviews surface water
    body extraction using the SI, ML, DL, and Spectral unmixing methods (Fig. 4).
    Fig. 4 Surface Water Mapping Methods Full size image Surface Water Mapping using
    Spectral Indices The RS images obtained from the satellite have several bands.
    Each band responds with different spectral reflectances for the various surface
    objects (artificial or natural). Spectral reflectance is used to discriminate
    the non-water and water regions. Numerous spectral indices formulated to delineate
    the water bodies from the RS images are discussed below, and a few are outlined
    in Table 4. Figure 5 depicts the evolution of spectral indices over time. Table
    4 SWM using spectral indices Full size table Fig. 5 Timeline diagram of development
    of major spectral indices Full size image The Normalized Difference Vegetation
    Index (NDVI) is frequently employed to measure vegetation greenness. The NDVI
    scale spans from -1 to 1, with negative NDVI values indicating the presence of
    water content (Tucker, 1979). The Tasseled cap wetness (TCW) index was developed
    to segment the water bodies using six bands of Landsat TM images. The surface
    reflectance of six bands is transformed to a new dimension with maximum variability
    for generating coefficients. The visible bands have higher coefficients than the
    Infrared bands due to the reflectance of water in those regions. A threshold of
    zero delineates non-water and water pixels (Crist and Cicone, 1984; Crist, 1985).
    Normalized Difference Water Index (NDWI) (McFeeters, 1996) is a spectral index
    formulated using NIR and green bands. The spectral bands green and NIR provides
    high and low spectral reflectance in the water regions, respectively. The water
    and other terrestrial features are denoted by positive and zero or negative values,
    respectively, on the NDWI. However, NDWI suffers from built-up noise. The built-up
    land shows the same reflectance pattern as water, resulting in positive values
    in NDWI. The Normalized Difference Moisture Index (NDMI) was formulated using
    NIR and SWIR bands of Landsat TM imagery to extract the vegetation liquid water
    content in vegetation. NDMI spans from -1 to 1, wherein high values correspond
    to water content (Wilson and Sader, 2002). The individual sum457 was used to delineate
    the wetland ditches (Al-Khudhairy et al. 2002). The Landsat band 4 is enough to
    determine the ditches surrounded by vegetation (grasslands). Adding bands 5 and
    7 to the index helped to detect ditches surrounded by bare soil (gravel tracks).
    This approach performs well for the ditch-carrying pixels comprised of water and
    homogeneous non-water features (vegetation or bare soil). It is worth noting that
    the pixels composed of water features and two or more non-water features, high
    spatial resolution images, will be the better choice. The combined density slicing
    and sub-pixel approach were used for accurate water body extraction in the Prairie
    Pothole Region (PPR). The integrated method provides good accuracy on large and
    small water bodies (Sethre et al. 2005). The flood mapping in the Koa catchment,
    Bihar, was carried out using the density slicing method, Tasseled Cap Transformation,
    and NDWI. The experimentation utilized Landsat TM and LISS-III imagery. NDWI performs
    better than density slicing (fails in mixed and high turbidity pixels) and Tasseled
    Cap Transformation (overestimates water area and fails to eliminate shadow) (Jain
    et al. 2005). To mitigate the issue of built-up noise during water extraction,
    a Modified Normalized Difference Water Index (MNDWI) was introduced (Xu, 2006).
    The average Middle Infrared (MIR) radiation value in built-up areas exceeds average
    green band values. So, MNDWI employs MIR rather than NIR to identify water regions.
    This adjustment enhances the differentiation between built-up land and water,
    leading to a more effective suppression of built-up land noise. The Principal
    Component Analysis (PCA) converts the original spectral bands into uncorrelated
    Principal Components (PC). SWM was performed by combining PCA and fuzzy c-means
    (FCM) clustering. Here, a variant of PCA is applied on the training field (a polygon
    of water and land) to generate output bands. The first two output bands obtain
    the four PCs (two for water and two for land). The FCM accepts these PCs and produces
    a segmentation map (Lira, 2006). The Water Index 2006 (WI2006) was formulated
    by the weighted natural logarithm of Top of Atmosphere (TOA) reflectance scaled
    linearly to Digital Number (DN) and the interaction terms. The logarithm transformation
    demonstrated superior performance compared to the original reflectance, possibly
    due to the exponential decrease in reflectance with wavelength in clear-deep water
    (Danaher and Collett, 2006). WI2006 shows better performance in detecting all
    water types. Water Index (WI) was formulated by combining the TCW (weighted transformation)
    and NDWI3 (normalization) to extract the shoreline changes on Landsat TM and ETM+
    Imagery (Ouma and Tateishi, 2006). The NDWI3 was formulated using Band 4 (NIR)
    and Band 5 (SWIR) of Landsat ETM+ bands. The NDWI3 performs better in extracting
    sharper shoreline estimation (river-lake confluence, complicated and irregular
    shoreline, and mountain-lake interface) than NDWI1, NDWI2, NDWI4, and NDWI5. TCW
    can provide better results in extracting narrow portions of lakes. The results
    obtained by WI were 22.33% higher than TCW and 43.19% higher than NDWI3. Integrating
    the Normalized Difference Pond Index (NDPI) with a conditional classifier identifies
    small ponds in the RS images. This method also identifies the vegetation cover
    within the ponds. In the same paper, the authors also proposed the Normalized
    Difference Turbidity Index (NDTI) to determine the turbid/turbid-free water within
    the ponds (Lacaux et al. 2007). Enhanced Water Index (EWI) and Geographic Information
    System (GIS) are combined to extract the semidry watercourse from the noise in
    semi-arid regions. EWI was computed using green, NIR, and SWIR Bands (Yan et al.
    2007). The water indices, namely sum457, ND5723, and ND571, were integrated (SNN)
    for SWM from Landsat images (Beeri and Phillips, 2007). Combining ND5723 and ND571
    with sum457 mitigates the impact of aerosols and other atmospheric disturbances.
    This method performs better in extracting water from objects with similar water
    spectral patterns. The CIWI (Combined Index for Water Body Identification) was
    developed using Vegetation Index (VI) and NIR MODIS data (Mo et al. 2007). CIWI
    discriminates water from other background noises, including vegetation cover,
    clouds, and built-up areas. CIWI monitored the surface dynamics of the Pinglong
    reservoir, Guangxi Province, China, from 2004 to 2005 using MODIS data. Using
    Landsat 5 TM data, (Cao et al. 2008) developed the Revised Normalized Difference
    Water Index (RNDWI) for SWM, utilizing the red and SWIR bands. RNDWI can extract
    narrow water bodies by eliminating the effects of dark shadow and mixed pixel
    problems. The precision of RNDWI was better than single-band thresholding and
    MNDWI. Additionally, the surface dynamics of water of the Miyun reservoir were
    analyzed from 1984-2005 using Landsat TM images. The results show that the water
    distribution of the reservoir was highest in 1996 and then started declining from
    1994 to 2004. In 2004, the reservoir water extent was one-third of the 1996 water
    extent. The NEW spectral index was proposed using band 1 and band 7 of Landsat
    TM imagery (Xiao and Zhu, 2010). The results indicate that this spectral index
    outperforms NDWI and MNDWI in urban areas. The Water Ratio Index (WRI) is a band
    ratio technique with visible bands in the numerator and Infrared bands in the
    denominator. The values greater than one in WRI represent water pixels (Shen and
    Li, 2010). NDWI-B was calculated using blue and NIR bands capable of extracting
    larger and smaller water bodies and wetland areas. Due to high spatial resolution
    and temporal resolution, the HJ satellite''s CCD images were used in (Wei et al.
    2011). In Lu et al. 2011, a novel water index was formulated by integrating the
    NDVI–NDWI, NIR, and SLOPE data for extracting water bodies from HJ-1A/B satellite
    images. The SLOPE data, derived from 90m spatial resolution DEM data produced
    by the Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM), effectively removes mountain shadows.
    Similarly, the NIR band diminishes the influence of artificial urban structures.
    This combined approach amplifies the distinction between water bodies and the
    surrounding landscapes. The NDVI–NDWI, and NIR were employed with Otsu thresholding
    to partition water bodies. The threshold of 10 was employed for SLOPE data to
    distinguish between shadows and water bodies. This strategy demonstrated improved
    performance compared to using the NDVI and NDWI indices in isolation, leading
    to enhanced water features. However, it does exhibit notable limitations, including
    an inclination to overestimate small water bodies and underestimate slender river
    channels. The Pixel-Based (PB) and Object-Based (OB) methods are used for water
    body extraction from RS images. The PB method extracts water bodies and types
    by the following approach: 1) green band (Threshold < 0.18) to extract clear water;
    2) NIR band < 0.2 & NDVI < 0.3 to extract green water; 3) SWIR < 0.15 to extract
    turbid water. The slopes < 20° was used to eliminate the mountain shadows. OB
    method uses bottom-up segmentation with scale parameter = 15, shape factor = 0.1,
    and compactness = 0.5 for water body extraction. The integration of PB and OB
    performs better than MNDWI, NDWI, and Maximum Likelihood Classifier (MLC) +NIR
    and provides better Producer Accuracy (PA). However, it overestimates the water
    (shadows, coal fields misclassified as water) (Sun et al. 2012). The New Water
    Index (NWI) was formulated by replacing the band blue with the band green and
    NIR with the sum of the reflectance of Infrared bands in NDWI. NWI provides better
    results in mountain regions (Feng, 2012). In Qiao et al. 2012, the adaptive water
    extraction based on NDWI on Landsat ETM+ imagery was developed. First, the preliminary
    water map was generated using NDWI/ RNDWI. The water pixels in the RNDWI have
    smaller values (less than zero) rather than larger values (more than zero) in
    NDWI. The modified peak and valley method selected the most fitting pixels, and
    the direction and Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR) information removes the shadow pixels
    present in fitting pixels. This step ensures that the fittest pixels are only
    pure water pixels. Afterward, seed pixels are selected from the fittest pixels,
    creating the local water area by region growing technique. Finally, each local
    area''s boundary pixels are identified and used as centers of template windows.
    Within each window, the background pixels were reconfirmed based on statistics
    (spectral mean and standard deviation of water and background pixels) and local
    area classification. This method performs better than segmentation by the valley
    between the two highest peaks, segmentation by a valley with the highest drop
    height, MLC, and Support Vector Machine (SVM) by the performance metrics OA (96.5%)
    and kappa (0.946). Automated Water Extraction Index (AWEI) was proposed for water
    body extraction from RS data (Landsat 5 TM data), mainly in dark shadow and low/high
    albedo surfaces. The AWEI can also classify edge pixels (mixed pixels) with high
    accuracy and a constant threshold. AWEI outperforms MNDWI and ML classifiers with
    a kappa coefficient (Feyisa et al. 2014). The three water indices, namely NDWI
    (NDWIo5,3), MNDWI (NDWIo6,3), and NDWIo7,3, were developed for SWM of the Yangtze
    River Basin (YRB) and the Huaihe River Basin, China, from Landsat 8 OLI Imagery
    (Du et al. 2014). Since the zero threshold includes some built-up areas as water
    bodies (Commission Error (CE)), these three water indices were combined with Otsu
    thresholding. The three NDWIs were analyzed in three different regions: Region
    1 (Dongpu Reservoir), Region 2 (Gorges Reservoir and the Yangtze River), and Region
    3 (Shahu Lake and Dong Lake). The experiment results show that MNDWI (NDWIo6,3)
    performs better in extracting water bodies (in all the regions) than the other
    water indices, NDWIo5,3 and NDWIo7,3. The findings also show a few misclassifications
    due to mixed-pixel problems and overestimation of small water features. The spectral
    unmixing technique can solve this misclassification problem. An Automated Method
    for Extracting Rivers and Lakes (AMERL) was developed by integrating water indices
    (MNDWI, NMDWI, AWEI_sh, AWEI_nsh) with image processing techniques (Jiang et al.
    2014). AMERL was developed to extract wide rivers, lakes, and narrow rivers of
    Hebei, Jiangxi, and Ningxia regions from Landsat imagery. The pure land and water
    pixels were segmented by thresholding. Nevertheless, the challenge lies in effectively
    applying thresholding to the mixed pixels at the edges of water bodies. To address
    this issue, image processing techniques were performed on a water indices map
    (output of water indices) to accurately detect water pixels at the edges. The
    procedure for extracting wide rivers and lakes differs from narrow river extraction.
    The wide rivers and lakes were extracted by applying a watershed segmentation
    algorithm on the gradient image of water indices. The gradient image was determined
    using the Sobel operator. The narrow river extraction was performed by linear
    feature enhancement (LFE), line tracking, and noise reduction. The LFE image highlights
    the linear spatial forms of water maps. Then, the line tracking applies thresholds
    to extract the river networks from LFE images. Finally, the noises, such as mountain
    shadows, roads, and small segments, were removed by applying thresholding based
    on the green band, SWIR band, and segment size. Since AMERL aims to improve mixed
    water pixel identification, they measure the edge performance using metrics such
    as edge OA, edge Commission Error, edge Omission Error (for wide rivers and lakes),
    correctness, completeness, and quality (for narrow rivers). The MNDWI and AWEI_sh
    perform better than NDWI and AWEI_nsh. Noises like roads intersecting with waterways
    and shadows are still challenging. In Maglione et al. 2014, NDVI and NDWI were
    used to delineate the shoreline in the Phlegrean area of the Campania Region,
    Italy, using WorldView-2 Imagery. The pansharpening technique was applied to transfer
    the spatial resolution of the panchromatic image to a multispectral image. Pan-sharpened
    images provide enhanced spectral and spatial resolution, improving geometric accuracy.
    The Correlation Coefficients (CC) and Erreur Relative Globale Adimensionnelle
    de Synthèse (ERGAS) are the metrics used to analyze the quality of pan-sharped
    results. Then, the NDVI and NDWI were applied to the pan-sharped images for shoreline
    extraction. The threshold values used to differentiate land and water were calculated
    using the Maximum likelihood method. The results reveal that the NDWI derived
    from pan-sharpened images yields superior outcomes than the NDVI derived from
    original and pan-sharpened images. The Index of Water Surfaces (IWS) was calculated
    using blue and SWIR bands of Landsat ETM images. IWS differentiates surface water
    from other surfaces such as chott, sebkha, and wadis (Hassani et al. 2015). The
    Index (I) is a new spectral index formulated by combining NDWI and proposed mNDWI.
    The MNDWI and mNDWI are distinct spectral indicators. While the MNDWI relies on
    Green and SWIR1 bands, the mNDWI utilizes Blue and NIR bands to detect water bodies.
    The Index (I) performs better in delineating shallow water bodies but suffers
    from spectral noise (Mishra and Prasad, 2015). In Yao et al. 2015, the Urban Water
    Extraction Method (UWEM) was developed that combines the new spectral index named
    High Resolution Water Index (HRWI) and the dark shadow prediction model. UWEM
    was designed to eliminate the misclassification caused by dark shadows. The HRWI
    was formulated using red, green, and NIR bands, whose coefficients were obtained
    by SVM. The SVM was trained to classify water and non-water classes except dark
    shadow cover types. The dark shadow prediction model was trained by SVM using
    the spectral contrast between inner and outer edge pixels in the green band, along
    with NDWI, as its input features. The dark shadow prediction model distinguishes
    small water bodies and dark shadows. After removing large water bodies from the
    NIR band (thresholded with 0.1), the inputs are fed to the dark shadow prediction
    model to separate dark shadows and small water bodies. The dark shadow mask was
    created and applied to the output of HRWI to remove dark shadows. The UWEM outperforms
    NDWI and NDWI with dark shadow detection (NDWIS) regarding kappa, CE, and Omission
    Error (OE). UWEM provides better extraction accuracy for different water types
    (water with turbidity and pollution). Using TOA data without atmospheric correction,
    water bodies filled with aquatic vegetation and small water bodies connected with
    dark shadows reduce the accuracy. The NDWI and Land Surface Water Index (LSWI)
    (Chandrasekar et al. 2010) have high CE due to the misclassification of other
    land cover objects as water, especially wetland vegetation. To suppress the noise
    due to vegetation, (Menarguez, 2015) developed the water body extraction rule
    using the existing water and VI. The two independent constraints, namely NDWI
    plus VI and LSWI plus VI, were developed by integrating each of the two water
    indices (NDWI and LSWI) with NDVI and Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI) (Huete et
    al. 2002). The pixels that satisfy the constraints were classified as water pixels.
    Combining the VI with water indices significantly reduces the misclassification
    due to vegetation noise, especially in wetland areas with lush vegetation. However,
    the misclassifications due to the built-up areas and shadows are not significantly
    reduced. In Zhai et al. 2015, the surface water body extraction results of water
    indices from Landsat 8 OLI and TM imagery were analyzed. The water indices such
    as NDWI, MNDWI, AWEI, and NDVI were used to extract the water bodies from these
    two sensors. Two distinct locations within Tianjin city were chosen as the designated
    study areas: Hexi district (region with abundant buildings, building shadows,
    and asphalt roads and bridges) and Nanyang Pier Village (village area dominated
    by vegetation, ponds, and rivers). The water body extraction results of Landsat
    8 OLI (OA=97.61%, kappa=0.68) are slightly better than Landsat TM data (OA= 97.10%,
    kappa=0.63) in the city area. Also, the MNDWI and AWEI perform better in discriminating
    shadow water from shadow and built-up areas than the other two water indices (NDVI
    and AWEI). The threshold stability is better in Landsat 8 OLI than in Landsat
    TM data. In Sharma et al. 2015, the Superfine Water Index (SWI) was created to
    globally identify water bodies by utilizing MODIS data. SWI was generated by substituting
    the green band present in NDWI with the Saturation component derived from the
    Hue-Saturation-Value (HSV) transformation of the red (R), green (G), and blue
    (B) bands of the MODIS data. The normalization difference between the saturation
    values and NIR makes the SWI range between -1 and 1. The SWI significantly differentiates
    surface water and other land cover elements. The random walker algorithm was employed
    on the SWI image to generate a water segmentation map aided by training data encompassing
    continental and coastal areas. The graph-based random walker approach segments
    images by considering each pixel as a node connected to its neighbors by edges
    weighted by similarity. This method needs seed pixels with labels. The likelihood
    of a random walker originating from any unlabeled pixel reaching a pre-labeled
    pixel can be influenced by a small number of initial seeds. By assigning each
    pixel to the label associated with the highest calculated probability, the process
    enhances the segmentation of the image. The SWI performs better in identifying
    narrow water bodies, extracting non-turbid and turbid water bodies covered by
    dense vegetation, and discriminating surface water bodies from dark soils, shadows,
    and volcanic eruptions. SWI outperforms MNDWI, AWEI, and NDWI by the performance
    metrics PA (86.93%), User Accuracy (UA) (98.57%), and Overall Accuracy (OA) (92.84%).
    The coastline dynamics of Hatiya Island, Bangladesh, from 1989-2010 were analyzed
    using Landsat Imagery (Ghosh et al. 2015). Coastal regions are susceptible to
    sea level rise and extreme climatic changes (cyclones, precipitation, and surface
    temperatures). The coastline dynamics can be analyzed through water body extraction
    along the coastal line, followed by the amount of erosion and accretion determination.
    The MNDWI, a water index, was utilized for coastline water body extraction and
    estimated the water extent for 1989, 2000, and 2010. The OA and kappa for water
    body extraction were more than 93% and 0.83, respectively. Substantial erosion
    occurred in the northern and western parts of the island, while sedimentation
    led to land gain (accretion) in the southern and eastern areas. The Water Index
    2015 (WI2015) was proposed employing the same training data and statistical analysis
    of WI2006, except for input (WI2015 uses surface reflectance as input). The linear
    discriminant analysis (LDA) was used to determine the intercepts and coefficients.
    WI2015 compared with AWEI, MNDWI, NDWI, TCW, and WI2006. The misclassification
    (OE) was observed in all the water indices due to the same spectral reflectance
    (green-brown), slender water bodies, and mixed pixels (Fisher et al. 2016). NDWI-DB
    was computed from dark blue (coastal aerosol) and SWIR bands from Landsat 8 OLI
    images. The NDWI-DB accurately extracts water bodies in urban and mountainous
    regions by eliminating dark plants, impervious surfaces, suspended sediments,
    ice, snow, bedrock, shadows, etc (Li et al. 2016b). The NDWI-DB performs better
    than MNDWI, NEW, and slightly lower than AWEI. The new water index was formulated
    by merging NDWI and MSI to accurately extract the water bodies by suppressing
    the shadow regions (Xie et al. 2016a). The new NDWIs were formulated using eight-band
    WorldView-2 Imagery rather than traditional NDWI (NDWI formulated using the high-reflective
    and low-reflective bands such as green and NIR, respectively. A total of 20 NDWIs
    were formulated using high-reflective bands (Coastal, Blue, Green, Yellow, and
    avg1) and low-reflective bands (Red-edge, NIR1, NIR2, and avg2). The avg1 and
    avg2 correspond to the average of high-reflective and low-reflective bands, respectively).
    Similarly, NDWIsum was computed by adding all the NDWIs. First, the optimal NDWI
    (NDWIoptimal) was identified from the 21 NDWIs using the performance metric (kappa
    coefficient). The experimental results show that the NDWIs calculated from NIR2-Coastal
    and NIR2-Green combinations achieve the highest kappa compared to others. Therefore,
    either NDWINIR2-Coastal or NDWINIR2-Green can be selected as NDWIoptimal. The
    water segmented map provided by the NDWIoptimal suffers from shadow noise (shadows
    misclassified as water). To suppress the shadow noise, the MSI was combined with
    NDWIoptimal. The NDWI-MSI outperforms other techniques such as NDWI, SVM, MLC,
    SVM-MSI, and MLC-MSI by the performance metrics (PA, UA, and Kappa). Even though
    the NDWI-MSI performs better in suppressing the shadow noise, the seasonal variation
    and biochemical properties of water bodies affect the performance of NDWI-MSI.
    In Du et al. 2016, the performance of the MNDWI water index with a pan-sharped
    SWIR band was analyzed to extract water bodies in Venice coastland, Italy using
    sentinel-2 Imagery. The spatial resolution of green, NIR, and SWIR bands of sentinel-2
    Imagery is 10m, 10m, and 20m, respectively. The NDWI10m was obtained using green
    and NIR bands. The MNDWI20m was obtained using an up-scaled green band (10m to
    20m) and a SWIR band. Similarly, MNDWI10m was obtained using the green band and
    downscaled SWIR band (20m to 10m). The downscaling or pan-sharpening of SWIR was
    determined using four methods, namely Intensity Hue Saturation (IHS), Principal
    Component Analysis (PCA), À Trous Wavelet Transform (ATWT), and High Pass Filter
    (HPF). Quality with No Reference (QNR) is the performance indicator that measures
    pan-sharpening quality. HPF produces better pan-sharpening (High QNR) results
    than others by retaining spatial and spectral information. Therefore, the MNDWI10m
    image produced by HPF has a higher Correlation Coefficient (CC) and lower Root
    Mean Square Error (RMSE). Four MNDWI images were determined using green and four
    SWIR10m bands (produced by four pansharpening techniques PCA, HIS, HPF, and ATWT),
    namely \\({MNDWI}_{10m}^{PCA}\\), \\({MNDWI}_{10m}^{IHS},\\kern0.5em {MNDWI}_{10m}^{HPF},
    and\\kern0.75em {MNDWI}_{10m}^{ATWT}\\). The \\({MNDWI}_{10m}^{ATWT}\\) performs
    better in extracting water bodies by suppressing built-up noise and vegetation
    noise. \\({MNDWI}_{10m}^{ATWT}\\) can extract accurate water bodies compared to
    NDWI10m, MNDWI20m, \\({MNDWI}_{10m}^{PCA}\\), \\({MNDWI}_{10m}^{IHS}, and\\kern0.5em
    {MNDWI}_{10m}^{HPF}\\) by the performance metrics, kappa (0.8962), OA (96.57%),
    CE (4.53%), and OE (10.77%). The new modified method of extracting river networks
    in the mountainous plateau regions (Part of Yarkant River, China) was developed
    using Landsat 8 OLI imagery (Gao et al. 2016). The study area has a lot of dense
    and fine tributaries and seasonal rivers, surrounded by mountainous and plateau
    regions. The new modified method combines the binary water maps of three methods
    (B1, B2, and B3). The k-means clustering and likelihood classification provide
    the binary image B1. The NDWI and TCW provide the binary images B2 and B3, respectively.
    The final water map is obtained using (B1 ∩ (B2 ∪ B3). This method could accurately
    extract fine and dense tributaries and artificial canals in the alluvial plain
    of the Yarkant River. However, terrain shadows showing similar spectral responses
    of water are not suppressed well. The modified approach achieves an OA of 94.18%,
    which is 3.64% higher than TCW and NDWI. The Enhanced Water Index (EWI) was formulated
    by integrating two principal components and mNDWI (Yang and Du, 2017). EWI exhibits
    superior effectiveness compared to the General Water Index (GWI), NWI, and MNDWI.
    Relying solely on the NIR band in NDWI and the SWIR band in MNDWI might result
    in omitting some water characteristics, including turbid water, minor water bodies,
    and pixels in shaded areas. The Weighted Normalized Difference Water Index (WNDWI)
    was formulated to extract water bodies utilizing NIR and SWIR bands. WNDWI compared
    with NDWI, MNDWI, and AWEI for zero threshold, Otsu threshold, and multiple threshold
    methods. The outcomes of the experiments demonstrate that WNDWI exhibits superior
    performance at zero thresholds compared to non-zero thresholds (Guo et al. 2017).
    In Zou et al. 2017, the constraint (MNDWI plus VI) using MNDWI (water index) and
    VI (EVI and NDVI) was developed to effectively suppress the vegetation and built-up
    noises for SWM. Due to superior performance in suppressing the built-up noise,
    MNDWI is favored over NDWI and is merged with a VI to mitigate the impact of vegetation-induced
    noise. Including EVI in the constraint aims to eliminate noise stemming from wetland
    vegetation. The pixels that satisfy the constraint are classified as water pixels.
    After successful water body extraction, the four indicators, such as year-long,
    maximum, seasonal, and average water maps, were determined to analyze the water
    extent throughout the year. Additionally, the variations of water extent with
    climatic variables (rainfall and temperature) were analyzed. The rainfall and
    temperature correlate positively and negatively with the water extent. MNDWI plus
    VI has more OE than CE. Because this method effectively suppresses noise from
    built-up areas and vegetation. However, misclassifying the water pixels as non-water
    in the boundary region is the primary reason for the high OE. MNDWI plus VI shows
    better results in the plateau region. The performance of nine water indices was
    analyzed independently on three different RS images for SWM (Zhou et al. 2017).
    The spectral indices such as TCW, MNDWI, NDWI, AWEI, SNN, LSWI, MNDWI plus VI,
    LSWI plus VI, and NDWI plus VI were used to extract surface water bodies on Sentinel-2,
    Landsat 8 OLI, and Landsat 7 ETM+ images. The performance metrics such as OA,
    Kappa, PA, and UA were used for evaluation. The results show that NDWI and NDWI
    plus VI methods have high OA (95.7%), kappa (0.915), and UA (94.3%) than other
    water indices on Landsat 8 OLI. Similarly, the TCW method records the lowest OA
    (88.7%), kappa (0.772), and UA (82.6%) than other water indices (built-up areas
    misclassified as water). Due to the Poyang Lake basin''s flat topography and warm
    climate, the input has pure water pixels without shadows and snow. The study reveals
    that NDWI performs better than integrated approaches. The performance of water
    indices was better in Sentinel-2 and Landsat 8 OLI images due to the following
    reasons: 1) High Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR); 2) Enhanced dynamic range that prevents
    band saturation in highly reflective objects; 3) Narrow spectral bands avoid the
    water absorption feature; 4) Improved calibration and 12- bit radiometric resolution.
    The performance of water indices was similar in sentinel-2 and Landsat 8 OLI images
    due to similar band wavelength and radiometric resolution. The efficacy of water
    indices was confined to the specified study area, namely the Poyang Lake basin.
    The modified optimization water index (MOWI) was formulated using all the spectral
    bands of Landsat 8 OLI imagery (Moradi et al. 2017). The coefficients of each
    band were calculated using Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO). MOWI provides good
    results in extracting water bodies under different environmental conditions (shadows
    of buildings, clouds, and mountains). Multi-Band Water Index (MBWI) was computed
    from the green, red, NIR, SWIR1, and SWIR2 spectral bands. MBWI accurately extracts
    water bodies by removing noises from dark built-up surfaces and mountainous shadows.
    Also, MBWI has the potential to identify the water bodies from different surface
    covers, turbidity, seasonal and climatic variations. MBWI performs better than
    AWEI, MNDWI, NDWI, TCW, and WI2006 (Wang et al. 2018a). Enhanced mNDWI (EMNDWI)
    extracts water features using band composites and decorrelation stretch. EMNDWI
    perform slightly better in identifying narrow river bodies and brown watercolor
    (eliminates the distractions by bushes, tree, and shadows) (Nugraha et al. 2018).
    The WI2018 was developed to extract water bodies using coastal aerosol, red, NIR,
    and SWIR1 bands of Landsat 8 OLI images. The coefficients and threshold are determined
    using Bayesian Optimization. The WI2018 provides better results than NDWI, MNDWI,
    and WI2015 (Raheem, 2018). In Yang et al. 2018, the urban SWM was developed based
    on a noise prediction strategy. The L2A Bottom of Atmosphere (BOA) data was obtained
    by pre-processing the L1C sentinel-2 imagery. The AWEI_sh and MNDWI were applied
    to BOA data for obtaining initial water maps. The difference between the two water
    maps generates the noise map. The noise map refers to non-water built-up areas
    such as shadows, dark objects, and extremely high albedo surfaces. The unsupervised
    Iterative Self Organizing Data Analysis Technique (ISODATA) classification technique
    classifies two types of noise ROI: low-albedo and extremely high-albedo noises.
    Then, Constrained energy minimization (CEM) was employed to determine the noise
    prediction map based on prior noise samples. The two noise maps were obtained
    by applying low-threshold (0.4) and high-threshold (1.2) for extremely high albedo
    and low albedo object areas, respectively. The final water segmentation map was
    obtained by subtracting these two noise maps from AWEI_sh. This method performs
    better than AWEI_sh and SVM in terms of performance metrics such as PA (92.65%),
    UA (94.79%), OA (99.13%), and Kappa (0.932). The two-step urban water index (TSUWI)
    was developed for SWM from high-resolution RS images (Wu et al. 2018). Extracting
    water bodies within urban regions posed difficulties owing to the presence of
    shadows and low albedo objects, which exhibit spectral reflectance similar to
    water. TSUWI was formulated using two subindexes: the Urban Water Index (UWI)
    and the Urban Shadow Index (USI). The UWI and USI were created by combining various
    spectral bands and band ratios. The coefficients of UWI and USI were determined
    using Linear SVM. In UWI, the linear SVM was trained to classify three classes
    (water, dark shadows, and other land cover types) using feature vectors such as
    red, green, and NIR bands. The UWI creates temporary segmented maps with three
    classes (water, light and dark shadows, and others). The USI was trained on temporary
    segmented maps using the feature vectors (NIR/G, G/R, and B/G) to distinguish
    water from light and dark shadows. Finally, TSUWI was formulated by combining
    UWI and USI. The TSUWI outperforms NDWI, HRWI, and SVM by the performance metrics
    kappa and total error (including CE and OE). The TSUWI accurately extracts urban
    water bodies in various water (chemical proportion, turbidity, depth) and environmental
    conditions. The atmospheric correction, radiometric calibration, Seasonal variations
    in the sun''s angle, and seasonal changes in water bodies affect the accuracy.
    The Multi-Spectral Water Index (MuWI) was constructed for SWM from Sentinel-2
    Imagery (Wang et al. 2018b). MuWI can produce 10-m water maps without a pan-sharpening
    technique. MuWI has two forms: Complete (MuWI-C) and Refined (MuWI-R). The MuWI
    was formulated using the Normalized Difference (ND) of sentinel-2 bands. Ex: ND
    (2,3) indicates the normalized difference between band 2 and band 3. The coefficients
    of MuWI were generated using SVM. The SVM was trained on 6 sentinel-2 bands (red,
    green, blue, NIR, SWIR1, and SWIR2) and 15 ND as input attributes and target labels
    (non-water and water). The MuWI-R is the refined version of MuWI-C, having highly
    weighted coefficients and includes ND computed from SWIR bands. MuWI is compared
    with traditional water indices such as NDWI, AWEI, and MNDWI by the performance
    metric, OA, CE, OE, and Kappa. MuWI-C performs better than MuWI-R. The result
    shows that MuWI performs better in extracting low-albedo surfaces (bridges, asphalt
    roads, built-up shadows, cloud shadows, and vegetation shadows) and high-albedo
    surfaces (sunlight contaminations) than other water indices. However, MuWI has
    some CE mainly due to building, vegetation shadows, and sunlight contamination.
    Several water indices were analyzed for SWM in the Nepal region from Landsat 8
    OLI images (Acharya et al. 2018). The area was encompassed by a single frame that
    spans diverse terrains, encompassing plains (at 60 meters elevation) to towering
    Himalayan peaks (reaching 8848 meters). This region features a wide array of surface
    water with different depths, turbidity levels, temperatures, and degrees of vegetation
    coverage. The different surface water bodies observed in the region are ice water
    with snow cover, narrow rivers in hilly and flat lands, urban ponds, and broad
    and shallow braided rivers. Initially, the water indices, namely NDWI, NDVI, MNDWI,
    and AWEI, were used to extract the water bodies. The standard thresholds may not
    accurately extract surface water bodies with more confusing environmental noises
    (forest, shadow, snow, and clouds). Therefore, optimal thresholds were determined
    using the trial-and-error method. The performance metrics such as PA, UA, OA,
    and kappa were used to evaluate the performance of water indices. Although many
    water indices perform better in flat and hilly regions, their performance was
    inadequate in the Himalayan terrain characterized by ice water and snow coverage.
    MNDWI and AWEI struggled to distinguish snow cover and shadows, while NDVI and
    NDWI exhibited better performance, primarily for pure water pixels. The combination
    of water indices NDWI with AWEI_sh with NDVI provides satisfactory results. Combining
    elevation data (DEM) and water indices improves the extraction accuracy. The Elevation
    with NDWI and NDVI (Elev_NDWnVI) provides better OA (96.38%) and kappa (0.8979)
    than other indices. NDVI and NDWI were applied to extract surface water above
    and below 665 m, respectively. In Landsat 8 imagery, the NIR band was employed
    for SWM due to its superior ability to differentiate between water and non-water
    features. The NIR with dynamic thresholding (obtained using a geoprocessing model)
    performs better than MNDWI, NDWI, and AWEI (Mondejar and Tongco, 2019). The same
    technique (MNDWI plus VI) was used for SWM and analyzed the surface dynamics of
    lakes (>1 km2) in the Mongolian Plateau (MP) from 1991 to 2017 on Landsat Imagery
    (Zhou et al. 2019). The lake area and number show decreasing trends from 1991
    to 2009. After that, it started increasing due to increased rainfall from 2009.
    The surface dynamics of lakes were significantly affected by natural and anthropogenic
    factors. The multiple index water detection rule (MIWDR) named AWEI plus VI was
    developed using AWEI and VI (EVI and NDWI) (Deng et al. 2019). The pre-processing
    procedure involved the utilization of the Fmask algorithm to eliminate clouds,
    cloud shadows, and ice/snow. Then, after finding the necessary indices, the MIWDR
    rule was applied to delineate the surface water bodies. Finally, the JRC Global
    surface water occurrence layer was employed to rectify misclassifications caused
    by hill shadows and other noises. The AWEI plus VI accurately extracts water bodies
    in urban environments by reducing noise from wetland vegetation, built-up areas,
    and building and mountain shadows. AWEI plus VI performs better in extracting
    water bodies at low-altitude regions than in high-altitude regions. By taking
    advantage of the Global Earth Engine (GEE) cloud platform, the large-scale and
    long-term SWM was analyzed from 1984-2018 in the YRB region. Additionally, the
    extent of seasonal and permanent water bodies was analyzed from 1984-2018. The
    Proposed Index (PI) was proposed by combining NDWI and mNDWI to minimize the influence
    of cloud shadows when identifying shallow water bodies (Jain et al. 2020). The
    four indices, namely MNDWI, NDWI, RNDWI, and AWEI_sh + MNDWI, were used to analyze
    the surface water dynamics of Miyun reservoir, Beijing, China, from 1979-2018
    on Landsat Images (Lai et al. 2020). The result shows that the AWEI_sh + MNDWI
    outperforms the other three water indices by eliminating misclassification due
    to shadows and built-up objects. The reservoir’s water extent area experienced
    four stages: the rising stage (1979-1997), the declining stage (1997-2004), the
    maintaining stage (2004-2015), and the sudden rising stage (2015-2018). The surface
    dynamics of the reservoir are mainly influenced by the precipitation and water
    consumption for economic development. Similar to (Zou et al. 2017; Deng et al.
    2019), (Chen et al. 2020a) developed the Arid Region Water Detection Rule (ARWDR)
    on water and vegetation index. In (Zou et al. 2017), due to spectral similarity,
    the actual water pixels showing a water index less than zero and a vegetation
    index greater than zero violated the water detection rule and misclassified the
    land pixels as water. Therefore, ARWDR adds the condition to the water index and
    vegetation index. ARWDR outperforms other spectral indices and water detection
    rule methods such as AWEI, EWI, MNDWI, RNDWI, WI_2015, SNN, AWEI plus VI, MNDWI
    plus VI, LSWI plus VI, and NDWI plus VI by the performance metric OA and kappa.
    ARWDR performs better than (Zou et al. 2017) in areas with sparse vegetation/no
    vegetation and bare ground. However, ARWDR also has CE and OE due to low albedo
    surfaces and mixed pixels. In addition, Tarim River Basin surface water dynamics
    (monthly, yearly, and seasonal variations) were also analyzed from 1992-2019.
    The results show that Tarim River Basin''s seasonal and permanent water bodies
    show an increasing trend from 1992-2019. The effects of rainfall, evaporation,
    and overexploitation influence the water distribution of surface water bodies.
    The framework to extract the surface river network in the upper Yellow River basin
    using sentinel-2 imagery and SRTM 90m DEM data (Li et al. 2020). The water indices,
    namely RNDWI, AWEI, and MNDWI, were used to extract the water bodies. Individually,
    MNDWI performs better in urban areas and sandy lands, AWEI extracts water bodies
    very well in regions dominated by vegetation and mountainous shadows, and RNDWI
    extracts the small rivers in hilly areas. Among the three water indices, RNDWI
    with Otsu thresholding performs better and is adopted to extract water bodies
    in all the sub-regions than the other two indices, MNDWI and AWEI. However, while
    extracting a larger river network, RNDWI suffers from salt and pepper noise. Therefore,
    the result of RNDWI was fused with MNDWI and AWEI to extract the water bodies
    accurately. The water-segmented map generated by the indices is transformed into
    vector features for denoising (removing the background noise such as clouds, snow,
    vegetation, and shadows) and connectivity processing. Following the post-processing
    phase, the segmented map was employed to estimate river widths, which were subsequently
    compared against global river widths and hydrological data obtained in situ. Statistical
    metrics, including R-square (R2), RMSE, and Mean Bias Error (MBE), were utilized
    to evaluate the accuracy of river width estimation. This technique effectively
    captured river widths exceeding 30 meters. The MNDWI with an adaptable threshold
    was used for SWM in Tianjin Binhai New Area on Landsat images (Guo et al. 2020a).
    MNDWI effectively reduces the built-up noises and shadows in the urban environment.
    Dynamic thresholding used local contextual information, effectively reducing false
    change information. The MNDWI-based adaptive dynamic threshold outperformed the
    other water extraction methods — MNDWI single-band threshold, ISODATA, and multi-band
    spectral relationship. The experiment results showed that the lake and river areas
    increased while seawater areas decreased. The correlation between the surface
    dynamics of water and impact variables showed that climatic (precipitation) and
    anthropogenic factors (human activity and economic development) positively influence
    the water environment. Land Surface Temperature (LST) Based Water Extraction Index
    (LBWEI) was formulated to accurately extract water bodies in cryospheric regions.
    LBWEI uses NDWI and LST values to segment water bodies. The LBWEI performs better
    in eliminating all the impediments caused by clouds, snow, ice, and mountain shadows
    compared to MNDWI, NDWI, NWI, NDMI, WRI, and AWEI_sh in all weather conditions
    (Khalid et al. 2021). Augmented Normalized Difference Water Index (ANDWI) employs
    visible (Red, Green, and Blue) and infrared (NIR, SWIR1, and SWIR2) bands to increase
    the contrast between non-water and water pixels (Rad et al. 2021). ANDWI performs
    better in all types of land surfaces, such as muddy water, urban areas, dark vegetation,
    hydrothermal water, snow and ice particles, mountainous shadow regions, and dust
    storms over the water regions. The ANDWI with Otsu thresholding provides better
    accuracy than other water indices such as NDWI, MNDWI, AWEI, and WI. Sentinel-2
    Water Index (SWI) was calculated using vegetation red edge and SWIR bands of Sentinel-2
    imagery. SWI has a high contrast value, which helps in identifying pure, turbid,
    and saltwater effectively. SWI combined with the Otsu algorithm improves the accuracy
    of extracting water bodies. SWI performs well in extracting larger and smaller
    water bodies in bare land and eliminating shadows in urban areas (Jiang et al.
    2021). The Proposed Water Index (PWI) was proposed to extract the water bodies
    in three regions: Florida, Shanghai, and New York. The PWI outperforms DeepLabV3
    models and other spectral indices in terms of F1-Score and Kappa (James et al.
    2021). In Ning and Lee, 2021, the water indices and mathematical morphological
    operation were combined to extract the river networks in Taiwan on Landsat 7 ETM+
    and Landsat 8 OLI Imagery. The water indices, namely MNDWI, NDWI, and AWEI, were
    used to extract the water bodies. Following the extraction of water bodies, a
    sequence of mathematical morphological processes was applied to retain the outlines
    of the river networks. Mathematical morphology considers parameters like size,
    shape, context, and other attributes to uphold the integrity of edge information.
    Mathematical morphology involves defining structural elements, applying dilatation
    and erosion, and opening and closing operations. The opening operation smooths
    the contours, disconnects small discontinuities, and eliminates thin protrusions.
    Like opening, closure smooths the contour. It narrows long, thin gaps, fills small
    holes, and contour line ruptures. The structural element size of four extracts
    river networks with fewer misclassifications. MNDWI and NDWI are best for braided
    rivers, and AWEI for meandering rivers. AWEI_nsh achieved the OA of 96.1% for
    the SE=4. The Improved Spectral Water Index (IWI) was formulated to extract muddy
    coastlines from Landsat 8 OLI imagery (Tang et al. 2022). The spectral reflectance
    of silty mudflats and sediment-water are similar, reducing accuracy. IWI is expressed
    by two high-reflectance bands (blue and green) and low-reflectance bands (SWIR1
    and SWIR2). The square ratio of these two band combinations amplifies the reflectance
    of sediment water. It reduces the reflectance of silty mudflats, which forms two
    groups (high and low-sediment water and other classes). The difference between
    these groups is approximately 0.5, which follows the bimodal distribution. The
    IWI with the Otsu Algorithm can accurately extract muddy coastlines from offshore.
    Although IWI extracts artificial offshore structures and silty mudflats with higher
    accuracy, it has some misclassification in the deep water. IWI can extract the
    offshore from the coastline with different tidal conditions. At low tide, IWI
    enhances the separability of silty mudflats from sediment water. Similarly, IWI
    enhances the separability of coastal vegetation from sediment water at high tide.
    IWI performs better than NDWI, MNDWI, RNDWI, EWI, and AWEI. In Liu et al. 2022,
    several Landsat water indices (MNDWI, AWEI, and WI2015) were analyzed on sentinel-2
    imagery to extract water bodies in Guangzhou city. In sentinel-2, the SWIR bands
    have 20 m spatial resolution and 10 m visible and NIR bands. Area-to-Point Regression
    Kriging (ATPRK), Gram–Schmidt (GS) Pan-Sharpening, and bilinear interpolation
    (BIL) approaches were used to downsample the 20m SWIR bands to 10m. After down-sampling,
    the water indices were determined to extract the water body images. Finally, the
    Marker-Controlled Watershed (MCW) algorithm performs segmentation in three steps:
    (i) Marking water and non-water using the threshold approach, (ii) generating
    gradient pictures using the Sobel operator, and (iii) segmenting water bodies
    using markers and gradient images. WI2015 + GS down-sampling has the best UA (94.48%),
    PA (89.10%), OA (96.79%), and kappa (0.897) among the nine combinations. WI2015
    + GS approach misclassifies building shadows as water and ignores small streams.
    In Choudhary and Ghosh, 2022, the water indices were combined with a double-window
    flexible pace search (DFPS) method for extracting surface water bodies of Kaylana
    Lake, India, using Landsat and Sentinel-2 Imagery. The water indices with zero
    threshold values have some misclassification of non-water areas as water. Otsu
    thresholding was adopted to reduce the misclassification. However, the major drawback
    of the Otsu method is that it assumes that the histogram of water maps (provided
    by water indices) is bimodal. Therefore, the DFPS method was used to determine
    the optimal threshold values to segment water bodies from background objects.
    The DFPS method uses four steps to determine the optimal threshold. 1) Identify
    the water area and set the inner and outer window with the difference of 2 pixels.
    2) The search range and pace are determined from the histogram of water indices.
    The difference between maximum and minimum histogram values from all inner window
    training samples obtains the search range pace is obtained by dividing the search
    range by the integer. The maximum histogram value and pace in the search range
    determine the potential threshold. 3) The success rate was calculated from each
    threshold value, and find the maximum and minimum success rates. 4) If the success
    rate difference is smaller than the error constant, the threshold with the highest
    success rate is optimal. The segmented water maps are obtained by applying an
    optimal threshold on six water indices: MNDWI, NDWI, NDVI, WRI, and AWEI. The
    NDWI with optimal threshold outperforms other water indices in all climatic conditions.
    Extracting water bodies from satellite images using the spectral indices method
    is a straightforward approach. However, the spectral indices method has significant
    challenges in determining the correct threshold for separating water from non-water
    pixels. Furthermore, the determination of the threshold value is contingent upon
    the image''s acquisition time and geographical location. Therefore, the researchers
    searched for a new approach to extract /identify/ segment the water bodies from
    the RS images. ML, a subsection of Artificial Intelligence (AI), was developed
    to create algorithms that can learn from the patterns observed from the input
    data (features). Surface Water Mapping using ML Techniques ML algorithms are categorized
    into three main groups: supervised learning, unsupervised learning, and reinforcement
    learning. The supervised ML model is trained using the features and their corresponding
    labels (ground truth) in contrast to unsupervised ML, which does not require training.
    Unsupervised ML works based on pixel similarity. ML techniques are stepped in
    for SWM applications. Figure 6 depicts the workflow of supervised and unsupervised
    ML for SWM. The SWM from the RS images was performed by: 1) Identifying and extracting
    the required features from the input RS images. 2) Train the ML model using the
    extracted features and class labels. 3) The same features were extracted from
    the input test image and fed to trained ML for pixel classification during testing.
    Some pre-processing steps, like feature scaling and removing redundant or highly
    correlated features by dimensionality reduction techniques, improve the ML model''s
    prediction accuracy. Several ML techniques used for water body extraction are
    discussed below and outlined in Table 5. Fig. 6 Workflow of supervised and unsupervised
    ML for SWM Full size image Table 5 SWM using ML Techniques Full size table The
    SVM classifier was trained using normalized values [0,1] of the spectral bands
    (four for Landsat MSS and six for Landsat TM) to create binary water masks. Contour
    tracing was performed on all surface objects to obtain contours with associated
    characteristics (perimeter and centroid). A piecewise linear polygonal technique
    generates polygons from contours. Finally, the shape similarity metric was used
    to evaluate the prediction, and the surface dynamics were analyzed (Li and Narayanan,
    2003). The Classification Tree Analysis (CTA) and Stochastic Gradient Boosting
    (SGB) decision-tree algorithms were used to distinguish wetlands and riparian
    areas in the Gallatin Valley of Southwestern Montana, USA, using Landsat ETM+
    Imagery (Baker et al. 2006). CTA creates a single decision tree using spectral
    bands, Tasselled Cap (TC) indexes (greenness, wetness, and brightness), DEM (elevation
    and slope data), and hydric soil data. The SGB algorithm creates an ensemble of
    Decision Trees (DT) and combines multiple DTs'' results to provide the final output.
    The CTA misclassifies wetlands into non-wetlands (high OE) and vice-versa in SGB
    (high CE). To avoid overfitting, the SGB trained with 29 DTs (reduced from 80)
    and CTA trained with 17 leaf nodes (reduced from 39). SGB utilized 19 of the 23
    variables, whereas CTA used 18. The result shows that the SGB outperforms CTA
    in identifying wetlands and riparian zones. The DT was trained using the three
    features such as 1) visible bands reflect more than infrared bands (B2 + B3) > (B4 + B5),
    2) The NIR band reflectance is less than 60 (B4 < 60), and 3) The NIR emits more
    radiation than SWIR in water regions (B4 > B5) & (B5 < B2). DT performs better
    than MLC but also underperforms in identifying small water bodies and mixed pixels
    (Fu et al. 2008). The ISODATA is an unsupervised ML algorithm that groups the
    pixels based on spectral similarity. This method was used for SWM from ASTER and
    Landsat imagery. The experiment results show that the ASTER with only three spectral
    bands (red, green, and reflected IR) can accurately extract clear, green, and
    muddy water. Moreover, this method extracts small water bodies at a satisfactory
    level. More spectral and high spatial resolution images are required to improve
    the accuracy (Sivanpillai and Miller, 2010). The ML algorithms DT, SVM, and MLC
    were analyzed for LULC mapping using Landsat TM and ETM+ Imagery (Otukei and Blaschke,
    2010). The original and derived bands were merged into a unified composite band
    and employed during training. The derived bands encompass three PCs, three TCs
    indices, NDVI, and a texture band (established by spectral variance). The C4.5
    data mining algorithm identifies suitable bands and establishes decision rules.
    The SVM and MLC were trained on appropriate bands (provided by the C4.5 algorithm)
    and significant bands (after removing less significant bands from appropriate
    bands). The filter (3 × 3) was applied to all ML algorithms to minimize the salt
    and pepper noise. The results show that DT (OA= 93.48% and kappa=0.93) performs
    better than SVM and MLC. SVM and MLC trained on significant bands perform similarly
    to those trained on appropriate bands without compromising accuracy. The Adaptive
    Boosting (AdaBoost) algorithm is the ensemble ML classifier, which constructs
    and combines several weak classifiers to create a robust classifier. In each iteration,
    the Adaboost classifier updates the weights of training samples (provides more
    importance (weights) to the samples misclassified in the previous iteration).
    The spectral reflectance of Landsat ETM+ (except Panchromatic), NDVI, NDWI, MNDWI,
    and WRI was used as the features for training the weak classifiers (Shen and Li,
    2010). The FCC images highlight the water features, and MLC was used to extract
    the water bodies. The shape index (k) was calculated using area and perimeter
    of the water pixels from the segmentation map. The value k < 0.044, k ≥ 0.2, and
    0.044 ≤ k < 0.2 was represented as river, dike-pond and other water bodies. The
    experiment results concluded that human factors (over-utilization) decreased the
    dike-pond area from 1999 to 2008 (Lian and Jianfei, 2011). The SVM classifier
    was developed using training datasets with less than 5000 samples for each of
    the six classes (water, plant, snow, clouds, soil, and ice). The Red, NIR, Blue,
    Green, SWIR2, and SWIR3 spectral bands were employed as input feature sets. The
    spectral bands defined with rules and constraints were used to produce the training
    dataset (Sun et al. 2014). The ML algorithms, namely SVM, Extreme Learning Machine
    (ELM), DT, RF, Tree Bagger (TB), Logistic Regression via Variable Splitting, and
    Augmented Lagrangian (LORSAL), were trained to extract the water bodies and water
    types (rivers, ponds, lakes, and canals). These ML models for water body extraction
    employed NDVI, NDMI, and Morphological Shadow Index (MSI) as features. The ML
    models (to classify different water types) were trained using density, shape index,
    area, homogeneity, and length-to-width ratio as features (Huang et al. 2015).
    In the perceptron model, the output is the weighted linear function of feature
    vectors. Three features, namely SWIR spectral reflectance, conditional reflectance
    between Green, NIR, and SWIR bands, and mNDWI, are extracted from the Landsat
    ETM data. The results are analyzed for different perceptron thresholds (1-3),
    SWIR thresholds (40-65), and size parameters (0-75). The perceptron threshold,
    SWIR threshold, and the size parameter of 2, 40, and 40, respectively, provided
    an accuracy of 96.91% in extracting water bodies. Also, it concluded that the
    perceptron thresholds of 1 and 3 result in overestimation and underestimation
    of water bodies, respectively (Mishra and Prasad, 2015). The J48 Decision Tree
    (JDT) was constructed to detect water and non-water bodies from Landsat 8 OLI
    images (Acharya et al. 2016). The JDT was trained using deep blue, green, NIR,
    and SWIR1 bands to classify multispectral images into water and land pixels. The
    JDT was compared with three water indices (density slicing, MNDWI, and NDWI) and
    two ML (MLC and SVM) techniques. The performance of JDT was similar to density
    slicing, MLC, and SVM. In contrast to using all reflectance bands as inputs in
    MLC and SVM, the JDT approach employed only four bands in a training process.
    The deep blue band has contributed more to water body extraction in addition to
    the NIR and SWIR bands. The use of black plastics in farmlands (for mulching potatoes
    and maize), shadows from bridge structures, and mixed pixels at water-land boundaries
    are misclassified as water. The Random Forest (RF) classifier was constructed
    to extract water bodies from Landsat imagery in the YRB region. The well-known
    cloud pixels (by cloud masking), water pixels (by NDWI), and vegetation pixels
    (by NDVI) were removed before training. Then, the RF classifier was trained to
    classify water from soil and shadow pixels. The original spectral bands and spectral
    indices were used as feature vectors. The major limitation is removing water pixels
    under clouds directly by the cloud masking technique (Wang et al. 2018c). The
    RF classifier was trained to classify the pixels into land or water using a set
    of attributes (features). The features such as NDWI, NDVI, MNDWI, NDMI, and HSV
    were extracted from the multispectral images. The cloud, terrain, ocean, and glacier
    masks were applied before extracting the attributes. The experimental analysis
    of surface dynamics concludes that decreasing water extent depends on surface
    temperature (Sui et al. 2018). The multi-feature water body extraction (MFWE)
    was developed based on spectral and spatial features for SWM using GF-1 RS imagery
    (Zhang et al. 2018). The Pixel Region Index (PRI) was calculated on the input
    image, reflecting the object''s local spatial feature (smoothness). Then, the
    pixels were classified into large and small PRI feature classes according to the
    PRI features. The NDWI was computed for each class, and the primary water mask
    was generated by applying the peak-valley technique to the NDWI histogram. Concurrently,
    the initial water map was created using the k-means (km) clustering algorithm.
    The predominant water body mask guides the plausible cluster types. If the water
    mask categorizes over 10% of pixels within a group as water, that cluster is deemed
    a potential water category. Ultimately, combining the primary water mask and the
    water-guided map yields the final water map. The SWM was performed by combing
    the features of Sentinel-1 (SAR images) and Sentinel-2 (optical images). The Sentinel-1
    image features such as VH, HV, and polarization ratios, and Sentinel-2 image features
    such as blue, green, red, Vegetation Red-edge, NIR, SWIR bands, Spectral indices
    (NDWI, NDMI, MNDWI, and WRI), and MNDWI (calculated on pan-sharped SWIR(Band11)),
    textural features (Grey level difference vector (GLDV) and Grey level co-occurrence
    matrix (GLCM)), and image transforms (PCs) were combined to train the ML algorithms
    (DT, RF, SVM, and KNN). The ML results were compared with T1 (NDWI with Otsu thresholding),
    T2 (VH derived from Refined Lee speckle filtering (RL)), T3 (MNDWI calculated
    from À Trous wavelet transform pan-sharpening), and (T1 & T2). SVM outperforms
    other methods; however, the combined T1 and T2 produced satisfactory results (Bangira
    et al. 2019). The Automatic Cost-effective Method for Land Cover Classification
    (ALCC) employs an unsupervised classification approach (k-means clustering) on
    a combined image constructed using the spectral indices and six spectral bands
    from Landsat 8 imagery. This technique differentiates water through a combination
    of MNDWI and spectral bands, high and low vegetation through NDVI and spectral
    bands, bare land through the Normalized Difference Bareness Index (NDBaI) and
    spectral bands, and built-up areas through the Normalized Difference Bare Land
    Index (NBLI) and spectral bands (Gašparović et al. 2019). In Acharya et al. 2019,
    the SWM was performed on Landsat 8 OLI images by considering six ML algorithms
    (Naïve Bayes (NB), RF, SVM, Gradient Boosted Machines (GBM), Recursive Partitioning
    and Regression Trees (RPART), and Neural Networks (NNET)). The ML algorithms were
    assessed using input combinations of OLI bands (LS8) and three secondary bands:
    slope, NDVI, and NDWI. Five distinct datasets were used to train the ML algorithms:
    LS8, LS8+Slope, LS8+NDVI, LS8+NDWI, and LS8+Slope+NDVI+NDWI. The Classification
    and Regression Training (CARET) tool in R 3.5.0 was employed for the training
    process. The findings indicated that all ML algorithms performed well in flatlands
    and hilly regions but faced challenges in the Himalayas due to snowy conditions
    and shadows. Among the algorithms, RF showed the best performance, followed by
    GBM, NNET, and SVM based on metrics like OA and Kappa. The NB and RPAT demonstrated
    lower performance compared to the others. The inclusion of slope and NDWI improved
    the performance, while NDVI had a diminishing effect. The RS images (sentinel-1
    and sentinel-2) was segmented by the set of rules (R1 : NDWI − B > 0.6; R2 : NDWI > 0.05; R3 : NDWI > 0.3; R4 : dB <  − 14)
    to generate level 0 discrete objects. Then, the RF classifier was trained with
    six features (NIR, slope, compactness ratio, radar backscatter image, NDWIgreen
    image, NDWIblue image) to classify the level 0 discrete objects into glacial and
    non-glacial lake objects (Wangchuk and Bolch, 2020). In the context of river mapping
    in Northwestern China, the SVM classifier was trained using six attributes: Red,
    Green, NIR, SWIR1, SWIR2 bands, and Height Above Nearest Drainage (HAND) calculated
    from the DEM. SVM demonstrated superior performance compared to NDWI and MNDWI
    based on metrics like OA and Kappa. The findings suggest that this approach eliminates
    hill shading concerns in mountainous areas (Liu et al. 2020). The Cyclone Global
    Navigation Satellite System (CYGNSS) is a group of eight satellites with a Global
    Navigation Satellite System Reflectometry (GNSS-R) sensor, and its data is used
    for RS applications. The variables such as kurtosis, maximum, variance, and corrected
    Signal-to-Noise (SNRc) were measured using a Surface Reflectance (SR) Delay-Doppler
    map (DDM). The Random Under Sampling Boosted (RUSBoost) algorithm uses these variables
    except SNRc to classify each grid as water or land. The results show that the
    RUSBoost classifier outperforms the inland water detection method in predicting
    water bodies (Ghasemigoudarzi et al. 2020). The surface water bodies can be extracted
    from the LISS-III using feature extraction and ML classification. The combined
    spectral and textural features such as MNDWI, NDWI, EWI, NDVI, and Gabor filters
    were extracted from LISS-III multispectral images. Then, the ML classifier NB,
    RF, SVM, and eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGB) was used to classify water or land
    pixels based on the features (Nagaraj and Kumar, 2021). Automatic Urban Water
    Mapping (AUWM) was proposed to map the urban water bodies in 10m spatial resolution.
    AUWM was developed using MNDWI, PanSharpening (PS) techniques, and a km clustering
    algorithm. Four different variants of inputs, such as MNDWI without/with PS (MNDWI,
    MNDWIps), MNDWI + spectral bands (red, green, blue, and NIR) without/with PS (MNDWI
    + bands, MNDWIps + bands), were generated and used in km clustering. The km clustering
    was performed for different classes (k=2 to 10) (Gašparović and Singh, 2022).
    The Pixel-Level Feature (PLF) extraction and ML classification were performed
    for SWM using LISS-III RS images. The PLF features such as MNDWI, NDWI, NDVI,
    EWI, NDTI, NDPI, WRI, band inequality, spectral inequality, and Gabor filters
    were extracted and applied to ML classifiers (KNN, DT, RF, SVM, and XGB) for surface
    water body extraction. The PLF+XGB outperforms DL models in terms of performance
    measures. Also, the change detection of two reservoirs was analyzed for four years
    (2016-2019) (Rajendiran and Kumar, 2022). Instead of extracting PLF maps manually
    from the multispectral images, the dedicated feature extraction network, Multi
    Scale Feature Extraction Network (MSFEN), was designed to extract the features
    automatically from the LISS-III images. These features were used by the ML classifiers
    (DT, RF, NB, SVM, and XGB) to extract surface water bodies. The experimental results
    show that MSFEN+SVM outperforms other ML and state-of-the-art DL models (Nagaraj
    and Kumar, 2022). The SWM of Lake Victoria on Landsat imagery was performed using
    feature extraction and pixel classification. The features such as NDWI, MNDWI,
    NDVI, AWEI, and Gabor filters were extracted and fed to the ML classifiers (DT,
    RF, NB, XGB, Light Gradient Boosting Machine (LightGBM), Categorical Boosting
    (CatBoost)) for SWM. The experiment results show that LightGBM outperforms other
    ML classifiers. Multiplying the segmentation map with the depth information (obtained
    through Bathymetry data) determines the volume of Lake Victoria (water capacity)
    (Nagaraj et al. 2023). The combined handcrafted features (Rajendiran and Kumar,
    2022) (both spectral and textural) and Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) features
    (Nagaraj and Kumar, 2022) were used to train the ML classifiers. During testing,
    the trained ML classifiers (NB, DT, RF, SVM, XGB, AdaBoost, LightGBM, and CatBoost)
    accept the combined features to classify water and non-water pixels. The combined
    features with the RF classifier perform better than others. The surface water
    dynamics of the Vaigai dam were analyzed from 2012-2019 using rainfall and water
    availability data provided by the Indian Meteorological Department (IMD) (Nagaraj
    and Kumar, 2023a). The papers Li and Narayanan, 2003; Baker et al. 2006; Fu et
    al. 2008; Sivanpillai and Miller, 2010; Otukei and Blaschke, 2010; Lian and Jianfei,
    2011; Sun et al. 2014; Huang et al. 2015; Acharya et al. 2016; Wang et al. 2018c;
    Sui et al. 2018; Zhang et al. 2018; Bangira et al. 2019; Gašparović et al. 2019;
    Acharya et al. 2019; Wangchuk and Bolch, 2020; Liu et al. 2020; Ghasemigoudarzi
    et al. 2020; Nagaraj and Kumar, 2021; Gašparović and Singh, 2022; Rajendiran and
    Kumar, 2022; Nagaraj and Kumar, 2022; Nagaraj et al. 2023; Nagaraj and Kumar,
    2023a explain the procedure of SWM from RS images using ML algorithms. The ML
    algorithms used for water body extraction have the advantage of less hyperparameter
    tuning, less feature interpretation, require less data and time, and do not necessitate
    high-end systems. However, manually extracting more water features from the RS
    images and selecting the optimal feature (accounts for better accuracy) is challenging.
    Therefore, researchers have explored DL models for water body extraction. Surface
    Water Mapping using DL Techniques The DL model is an end-to-end model (Deep Neural
    Network (DNN); here, Deep indicates the depth of the network, usually more than
    three) trained with the inputs and required outputs. The model automatically learns
    the necessary features during the training process. It is broadly classified into
    two types: 1) Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) used for image processing applications
    (Castelluccio et al. 2015) and Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN) used for time-series
    or forecasting applications (Nagaraj and Kumar, 2023b). The CNN was built using
    an input layer, convolutional layers, pooling layers, Fully Connected (FC) layers,
    and output layers (Castelluccio et al. 2015). The input layer accepts the input
    and feeds the next layer. The sequence of convolution and pooling layers extracts
    the required features from the inputs (images). The FC layer is a multi-layer
    perceptron layer that triggers specific neurons by accepting these features. Finally,
    the output layer produces the output based on the neurons triggered in the FC
    layers. Several DL models were designed by varying the number of convolutions,
    pooling, and FC layers for various applications. Several DNNs were designed for
    multiple applications, such as 1) handwritten recognition (LeNet) (LeCun et al.
    1998); 2) Image classification assigns a single label for an Image (AlexNet (Krizhevsky
    et al. 2012), VGGNet (Simonyan and Zisserman, 2014), GoogLeNet (Szegedy et al.
    2015), ResNet (He et al. 2016), DenseNet (Huang et al. 2017)); 3) Semantic segmentation
    (Fully Convolutional Neural Network (FCN) (Shelhamer et al. 2017), Unet (Ronneberger
    et al. 2015), DeconvNet (Noh et al. 2015), Pyramid Scene Parsing Network (PSPNet)
    (Zhao et al. 2017), SegNet (Badrinarayanan et al. 2017), DeepLab (Chen et al.
    2017)). The accuracy of these DNN models depends on tuning the parameters such
    as layer depth, activation function, loss function, optimizers, and many more
    used while training. These DNNs were modified and designed for various applications
    in the RS field, which accept RS images (multispectral/hyperspectral) rather than
    RGB images. In RS, the DNN was used for scene classification (Zhang et al. 2015),
    semantic segmentation (Shelhamer et al. 2017; Ronneberger et al. 2015; Noh et
    al. 2015; Zhao et al. 2017; Badrinarayanan et al. 2017; Chen et al. 2017), etc.
    The several DL techniques used for SWM are discussed below and outlined in Table
    6. Figure 7 depicts the general fundamental architectures used for SWM, and Fig.
    8 depicts the timeline diagram of the development of DL techniques for SWM. Table

    The DNN model was developed to classify the pixels into water, building, road,
    ground, and vegetation (Längkvist et al. 2016). The single or multi-CNN (training
    multiple CNNs in parallel with different contextual input sizes) was designed
    to extract the features from the images. The post-processing approach of smoothing
    (classification averaging) yields better results than without smoothing by removing
    salt-and-pepper noise. The RS images were segmented by the simple linear clustering
    (SLIC) method (which produces equal segments). After initial segmentation, the
    nearby segments having the same class with 70% classification certainty (information
    obtained from DNN) were merged to improve the segmentation results. The DNN with
    seven layers (input layer, two convolution layers, two max-pooling layers, FC
    layer, and output layer) was designed for water body extraction (Yu et al. 2017).
    The combined spatial and spectral features extracted from the CNN layers achieve
    higher accuracies than ANN and SVM. In the Hubei study area, CNN provides 97.32%
    accuracy in extracting the water bodies. They recommended that the higher the
    samples used in training, the better the accuracies. FCN (Shelhamer et al. 2017)
    is a DNN that modifies the CNN architecture by replacing FC layers with convolutional
    layers. This modification enables the FCN to accept the arbitrary size inputs
    for semantic segmentation application. The FCN encoder was designed by traditional
    CNN architectures (Nagaraj and Kumar, 2021; Gašparović and Singh, 2022; Rajendiran
    and Kumar, 2022; Nagaraj and Kumar, 2022; Nagaraj et al. 2023) used in image classification
    applications (a network without FC and output layer). Then, the deconvolution
    network was designed using upsampling or transpose convolution layers, which uses
    bilinear interpolation to restore the original spatial dimension. Combining low-
    and high-level information (coarse and fine information) using skip connections
    and upsampling leads to accurate results. The FCN8 was obtained by combining feature
    maps of pool 3, 2 × pool 4, and 4 × conv7, followed by 8 × upsampling. FCN8 performs
    better than FCN16 and FCN32 variants. The FCN was modified to accept multispectral
    images and used for water body extraction. The improved FCN was designed by replacing
    standard convolution with atrous convolution and adding Conditional Random Field
    (CRF) as a post-processing technique (Fu et al. 2017). The atrous convolution
    expands the receptive field without additional complexity, and CRF refines the
    boundary structures. The results were compared with Multi-Resolution SVM (MR-SVM),
    patch-based CNN, and FCN8. MR-SVM is a segmentation-classification approach that
    segments the pixels based on spectral reflectance. Due to high spectral similarity,
    incorrect image objects produced by segmentation lead to incorrect classification.
    In Patch-based CNN, independent processing of patches leads to a loss of contextual
    information about patches, which creates discontinuities at the patch boundaries.
    The improved FCN eliminates these disadvantages by handling feature extraction
    and classification end-to-end for the whole image. Unet (Ronneberger et al. 2015)
    was designed initially for bio-medical image segmentation, which has a contracting
    and expanding path. It is an end-to-end DNN architecture trained using input images
    and their corresponding output. The contracting path was designed using convolution
    and pooling layers to extract image features. The expanding path uses upsampling
    and convolutional layers to increase the output resolution. The skip connection
    transfers features from the encoder to the decoder for better localization. Like
    the contracting path, the expanding path also has convolutional layers, which
    transfer context information to high-resolution layers. Since Unet performs semantic
    segmentation, it can be easily used for RS applications (LULC Mapping). The Unet
    was modified to accept multispectral images and used for water body extraction.
    The multispectral U-Net was designed similarly to Unet architecture to perform
    semantic segmentation to classify buildings, structures, tracks, roads, trees,
    crops, waterways, standing water, and small and large vehicles. The ReLU activation
    was replaced by Exponential Linear Unit (ELU). The input image combines multispectral
    bands, panchromatic bands, and reflectance indices (canopy chlorophyll content
    index (CCCI) and NDWI) into a single tensor. This method performs better in extracting
    waterways than other classes (Iglovikov et al. 2017). The DeepWaterMap architecture
    was designed to extract water bodies from Landsat imagery (Isikdogan et al. 2017).
    DeepWaterMap has an encoder and decoder structure with skip connections. The architecture
    was designed with a convolution layer, pooling layer, transposed convolution,
    Batch Normalization, and softmax layer. The first skip connection fuses the fine
    feature maps from the encoder to the upsampled coarse feature maps in the decoder
    through concatenation followed by a convolution operation. The second skip connection
    reuses previous layers'' features, reducing the number of filters at each convolutional
    without negotiating accuracy. The architecture has ten stages with three convolutional
    blocks at each stage. Since the DeepWaterMap learns multi-scale features (shape,
    spectral, and textural), it can discriminate snow/ice, clouds, and shadows from
    water bodies. The authors used the global land cover facility (GLCF) inland water
    dataset as a ground truth reference. The DeepWaterMap performs better than MLP
    and MNDWI regarding recall, precision, CE, OE, and F1-score. DeepWaterMap extracts
    water bodies in all atmospheric conditions and complex terrain types. The self-adaptive
    pooling convolutional neural network (SAPCNN) was designed with an input layer,
    convolution layer, self-adaptive pooling (SAP) layers, FC layer, and output layer
    to extract water bodies from high-resolution RS images. The DNN was trained using
    the superpixels generated by an adaptive simple linear clustering (A-SLIC) algorithm
    (the improved version of SLIC with affinity propagation). Then, the trained SAPCNN
    can classify the superpixel into water or land pixels. The water body extraction
    results were compared with two traditional pooling layers CNNs (replacing the
    SAP layer in SAPCNN with max and average pooling layers). The traditional pooling
    layers CNNs provide blurred water boundaries, resulting in more misclassification
    around the water boundaries. Also, the proposed method outperforms SVM, NDWI,
    Deepwater map, and (Yu et al. 2017) in extracting water bodies with high accuracy
    (Chen et al. 2018). The DL framework was designed by integrating the Deep U-Net
    and post-processing techniques to extract accurate water bodies from RS images
    (Feng et al. 2018). Deep U-Net is the modification of Unet with Batch Normalization
    (BN) and ELU. The Deep U-Net produces segmented results with blurry boundaries.
    The post-processing technique CRF and Regional Restriction (RR) helps to remove
    the False Positives and mixed pixel misclassification problem. The CRF uses contextual
    information to refine the boundary structures, which leads to over-smoothing.
    Then, RR corrects each pixel''s prediction result by determining each super pixel''s
    average membership probabilities. The SLIC algorithm generates the superpixel.
    The Deep U-Net with post-processing techniques (CRF + RR) outperforms Deep U-Net,
    Deep U-Net + CRF, Chan–Vese (CV)- and Markov random field (MRF) technique, SegNet,
    and DeepWaterMap. The Multilayer perceptron (MLP) model was constructed for SWM
    using Landsat 8 OLI images (Jiang et al. 2018). The radiometric calibration and
    atmospheric correction were applied on Landsat 8 OLI images to get surface reflectance
    data. The MLP was designed with an input layer, four hidden layers (the first
    three layers have 30 neurons, and the fourth layer has 10 neurons), and an output
    layer. The MLP was trained using surface reflectance of seven bands and its corresponding
    labels (water or non-water). The performance of MLP was analyzed using OA and
    kappa metrics and compared with spectral indices and SVM methods. MLP performs
    better in extracting narrow rivers, lakes, ponds, turbid water, and seawater than
    spectral indices and SVM. The spectral indices and SVM fails to extract small
    water bodies. Also, the MLP shows promising effects in mitigating noise, such
    as buildings, clouds, and mountain shadows, during surface water body extraction.
    The DeepUNet was designed to perform sea-land segmentation using Google Earth
    (GE) images (Li et al. 2018). Like Unet, DeepUNet has a contracting and expansive
    path with five stages. In the encoder, each stage has two convolution layers concatenated
    with the ReLU activation function followed by one max pooling layer. A similar
    structure was followed in the decoder, and an upsampling layer was used instead
    of a max pooling layer. The skip connections were used in this DeepUNet to transfer
    features from encoder to decoder in each stage. Inspired by ResNet, the plus connection
    adds the input to the output of two convolution layers. The Plus connection allows
    the DeepUNet for fast convergence. The performance of DeepUNet was better than
    Unet and SegNet by the performance metrics, Land Precision (LP), Land Recall (LR),
    Overall Precision (OP), Overall Recall (OR), and F1-Score. DeepUNet can discriminate
    complex structures and small ships from water bodies (Li et al. 2018). The Restricted
    Receptive field deconvolution network (RRF DeconvNet) was designed for surface
    water body extraction from high-resolution satellite images (Miao et al. 2018).
    The RRF DeconvNet restricts the receptive field to capture the pixel-wise details
    in the segmentation task. The RRF DeconvNet is an encoder and decoder architecture
    designed with residual units. Each residual unit was constructed by a 3×3 convolution
    layer followed by a 1×1 convolution layer. The first two stages of the encoder
    were designed using residual units along with Strided convolution with the stride
    of 2. The remaining three stages were designed using residual units and the atrous
    convolution. The decoder was designed using residual units and deconvolution layers.
    In the decoder, encoder feature maps were collected via skip connections and concatenated
    to the upsampling feature maps to retain the local and global information. The
    final layer is the softmax activation layer, which provides the class probabilities
    of each pixel. Instead of the traditional loss function (which treats the pixels
    equally), it uses a novel loss function named the Edges Weighting Loss function,
    where every pixel is multiplied by the weight mask. Each pixel was the weighted
    contribution of all the edge pixels. This loss function greatly enhances segmentation
    boundary details. RRF DeconvNet outperforms FCN8 and DeconvNet in terms of OA.
    The fine-tuned ResNet-50 was developed for recognition of the reservoirs and natural
    lakes at the global level (Fang et al. 2019). A Global Reservoir and Lake Training
    (GRaLT) database was generated using Landsat 8 TOA and the HydroLAKES database
    to train the model. The model was trained with different band combination inputs
    such as all bands, band 543, band 654, band 8, pan 654 (Red, NIR, and SWIR1 fused
    using pan band), water contour (pixels with MNDWI > 0 set to one, remaining as
    zero). The results show that pan 654 achieves the best OA (91.45%) and precision
    (94.37%) compared to other state-of-the-art techniques (SVM, RF, gradient boosting
    (GB), bag-of-visual-words (BoVW), AlexNet, and VGG). The authors found that utilizing
    all bands as inputs does not improve the accuracy. The fusion feature multi-scale
    pooling method for SWM was developed using panchromatic images of SPOT-5 and GF-2
    images (Qi et al. 2019). Seven Chinese ports: Shanghai, Tianjin, Qingdao, Xiamen,
    Dalian, Shenzhen, and Haikou ports were selected as study areas. SWM from the
    panchromatic images is challenging due to different imaging conditions and complex
    environmental scenes because it has one level of gray information. Therefore,
    additional feature descriptors such as gray level, gradient, and entropy were
    considered to create the fusion feature map. Then, different pooling layers are
    applied to the fusion feature maps to enhance the difference between water and
    non-water areas. The Otsu algorithm created the series of binary masks from each
    pooling scale feature map. The minimized energy binary mask was found using the
    observation function from the series of binary masks. The Markov modeling integrated
    with the iteration condition model (ICM) accepts the initial label and feature
    field vectors and is processed iteratively to generate the final water body extraction.
    The initial label field generated by the fusion feature multi-scale pooling model
    performs better than K-means and selected auto encoding (SAE) label field initialization
    methods. The fusion feature multi-scale pooling method retains the edge and area
    integrity in the final water body extraction. The fusion feature multi-scale pooling
    method performs better than gray level (GL), local binary pattern (LBP), Maximum
    entropy (ME), hierarchical sea-land segmentation (HSS), and SegNet by the performance
    metrics such as OA (89%), precision (87%), recall (93%), kappa (83%), and edge
    detection ratios (84%). The FCN model was developed to extract water bodies on
    very high spatial resolution satellite images (Li et al. 2019a). The radiometrically
    corrected images are used to train the FCN model. The FCN model was designed using
    an encoder (similar to the VGG16 model) and decoder. The decoder has a sequence
    of upsampling layers (realized by transpose convolution) to return the label map
    similar to the original dimension of the input image. The performance of the FCN
    model was analyzed with four key parameters: input features (if1, if2, and if3),
    training data (td1, td2, and td3), transfer learning (tl1 and tl2), and data augmentation
    (da1 and da2). A total of 36 models were generated using the four critical parameters
    with different combinations. The results show that the FCN model trained with
    input feature-if2 (Green, Red, and NIR bands), training data td1 (patches covering
    water and shadows in a balanced manner), transfer learning-tl1 (with transfer
    learning), and data augmentation-da2 (with data augmentation- flipping and contrast
    enhancement) performs better than NDWI, SVM, and Sparsity Model. Although FCN
    shows a promising effect in discriminating the high building shadows from water
    bodies, it fails to extract the narrow rivers. The multiscale refinement network
    (MSR-Net) was designed to extract the water bodies in high-resolution satellite
    images (Duan and Hu, 2019). The MSR-Net was constructed using a backbone network,
    Erasing-Attention (EA), and classifier module. The instance-batch normalization
    network (IBN-Net) was selected as the backbone Network. The backbone network has
    five layers (layer-0 to 4) that extract the features from input images. The output
    of layer4 is fed to the classifier module to get coarse segmentation results (P0).
    The classifier consists of a deconvolution layer and a global convolution network,
    which provides a large receptive field for localization and classification. The
    EA module removes the information redundancy in each stage by focusing only on
    the unclassified areas in the previous prediction. For example, if the previous
    prediction identified the water bodies, then it is erased by the EA and focuses
    on unidentified detailed portions. EA module accepts the upsampled prediction
    map (\\({P}_i^u\\)) and Fi + 1 in stage i+1 as inputs, producing EA weight (Ai + 1)
    and refined feature map (\\({F}_{i+1}^{\\prime }\\)) as outputs. Then, the final
    prediction (Pi + 1) can be obtained by adding the upsampled prediction map (\\({P}_i^u\\))
    and classified output of the refined feature map (\\({F}_{i+1}^{\\prime }\\)).
    The EA weight, refined feature map, and prediction are taken from ((Duan and Hu,
    2019), Eq. (3), Eq. (4), and Eq. (5)) and it is expressed as. $${A}_{i+1}=\\mathit{\\max}\\left(0.5-\\sigma
    \\left({P}_i^u\\right),0\\right)\\ast 2$$ (1) $${F}_{i+1}^{\\prime }={A}_{i+1}.{F}_{i+1}$$
    (2) $${P}_{i+1}=C\\left({F}_{i+1}^{\\prime}\\right)+{P}_i^u$$ (3) At last, combining
    all the predictions (P0-P5) produces a final segmentation map. The MSR-Net provides
    sharper boundaries with more sufficient details and a higher degree of completeness
    on both linear rivers and planar water bodies. The MSR-Net outperforms other state-of-the-art
    models: Unet, SegNet, FCN8s, GCN, ExFuse, and DeepLabV3+. The new framework was
    developed for SWM in high spatial resolution GF-1 RS images (Li et al. 2019b).
    The framework includes a multi-scale image splitting technique, DeepLabV3+ optimization
    model, and CRF post-processing. First, the RS images were divided into three scales
    (128×128, 256×256, and 512×512). The image block (512× 512) has high contextual
    information about the background. Similarly, the image block (128×128) has fine
    details. This method enables the collection of different contextual information
    from the original images by upsampling the low-resolution images to high-resolution
    images (512×512) to create benchmark image blocks (multi-scale inputs). Then,
    the modified DeepLabv3+ model was trained by these multi-scale inputs. The DeepLabv3+
    model has an encoder, ASPP, and decoder. The encoder has five convolution stages
    with different bottleneck building blocks in each stage. The feature maps output
    of the first and second convolution stages were concatenated to retain the global
    information (low-level feature maps). The fifth convolution layer feature maps
    were passed to the ASPP module to extract multi-scale features. ASPP uses five
    convolutional layers with different dilation rates to extract the multi-scale
    features. Then, the multi-scale features were concatenated and sent to the decoder
    module. In the decoder, the multi-scale feature maps from ASPP were upsampled
    and concatenated with the low-level feature maps (from the encoder) to create
    new feature maps. Then, these feature maps were upsampled to three different sizes
    of the corresponding input image blocks. These three feature maps were mosaiced
    to the size of benchmark image blocks (512×512). The mosaiced feature maps were
    weighted and fused to create the coarse segmentation map. The coarse segmentation
    map was further refined by CRF post-processing to create a precise water map.
    The CRF post-processing provides a water segmentation map with sharp boundaries.
    The modified DeepLabV3+ model performs better in extracting water bodies under
    cloud shadows, surrounded by paddy fields, complex buildings, and shallow water
    beaches. The modified DeepLabV3+ outperforms NDWI, FCN, and traditional DeepLabV3+
    by the performance metrics, recall, PA, and IoU. The Automated Surface Water Extraction
    (ASWE) was developed based on the presence and background learning (PBL) for SWM
    using Sentinel-2 imagery and OpenStreetMap (OSM) data (Zhang et al. 2019). The
    OSM data layers pertaining to land use, natural features, and waterways include
    substantial water information. However, it has more false positives. The MNDWI
    determined from surface reflectance data was used to remove the false positives
    in the OSM data. Further, the mixed pixels in the mask were removed by the morphology
    erosion process. Finally, the homogenous water and background pixels were generated
    to train the Back Propagation Neural Network (BPNN) model. The BPNN was designed
    using input, two hidden layers (with nodes 10 and 6), and an output layer. The
    trained BPNN determined the observed presence probability (Pobs). Then, the water
    presence probability (Pw) was determined using Pobs and Probability transformation
    constant (c). The final segmentation result was obtained from the Pw using the
    optimal segmentation threshold (Ts). The Ts was obtained iteratively by determining
    the maximum modified F-Score (Fm) on the segmentation results. The performance
    of ASWE-PBL was evaluated with the performance metrics CE, OE, and Kappa and compared
    with MNDWI, AWEI, and RF methods. The result shows that ASWE-PBL outperforms other
    methods in all the performance measures. The ASWE-PBL performs better in extracting
    water from shadows and built-up areas. A novel DL framework was developed by combining
    FCN with an adversarial network and context module (Alhassan et al. 2020). The
    encoder section in FCN was designed using VGG, ResNet, and GoogLeNet, referred
    to as base networks (FCN-VGG, FCN-ResNet, FCN-GoogLeNet). Later, these variants
    were combined with adversarial network and context module to improve accuracy.
    The base network with an adversarial network mimics a Generative Adversarial Network
    (GAN). The FCN acts as a generator (produces prediction map), and the discriminator
    network discriminates ground truth as real and prediction maps as fake. This process
    makes the generator produce the prediction map closer to the ground truth. Next,
    the base networks are combined with the context module (designed with dilated
    convolution), improving the accuracy by extracting more contextual information.
    At last, the base networks were combined with adversarial and context module to
    improve the accuracy further. The FCN-ResNet+ Adversarial + context provides the
    OA= 90.46%. A new two-level framework called offline training and online prediction
    (OTOP) was developed using multiscale convolutional neural networks (MSCNN) and
    Global Earth Engine (GEE), respectively (Wang et al. 2020a). The MSCNN was designed
    with six feature extraction stages. Each stage was designed using three convolutional
    layers (to extract higher-level features) and one max pooling layer (to reduce
    the spatial dimension). The feature map from the last convolutional layer of each
    stage is fed to a single-feature convolution operation to reduce the feature map
    channels and upsampled to the original spatial dimension of the input. The six
    single feature maps were concatenated and processed by the softmax layer to provide
    water or land class probabilities. The MSCNN model was implemented, and trained
    parameters were uploaded on GEE. Since GEE has access to Landsat images, the urban
    water bodies were predicted online without downloading the data. MSCNN outperforms
    MNDWI and RF in extracting complex urban scenes such as building shadows and low-albedo
    surfaces in urban areas. However, this method fails to classify mixed pixels around
    the water bodies. Like Unet, SegNet (Badrinarayanan et al. 2017) has an encoder,
    decoder, and final classification layer. Since the SegNet encoder was designed
    using the first 13 layers of VGG16 architecture, it has a 13-layer decoder structure.
    The max pooling layers in the encoder reduce the spatial resolution of feature
    maps, thereby losing boundary details. Therefore, transferring the feature maps
    from the encoder to the decoder is necessary. However, it consumes more memory.
    The SegNet transfers max pooling indices from encoder to decoder, which eliminates
    the need for learning to upsample. In the decoder, each layer uses the max-pooling
    indices from the corresponding encoder layer to upsample the input feature maps
    into sparse feature maps. The sparse feature maps convolved with the convolution
    layer to produce dense feature maps. Finally, the classification layer uses the
    softmax function to provide class probabilities for each pixel. SegNet consumes
    less memory than Unet. The SegNet was modified to accept multispectral images
    and used for water body extraction. Separable Residual SegNet (SR-SegNet) (Weng
    et al. 2020) was designed for SWM from the RS images. Like SegNet, SR-SegNet has
    the encoder and decoder structure with some modifications. The SR-SegNetv1 was
    developed by applying the following modifications to the traditional SegNet: 1)
    The last five convolutional layers in the encoder were removed and performed 4
    × upsampling operation (reduces the number of trainable parameters). 2) The deep
    and shallow layers were added (fused) to retain the location information. 3) Modified
    Residual block (two successive 2 x2 convolution layers and one 1×1 convolution
    layer) was used in the encoder stage to eliminate the vanishing and exploding
    gradient problem. 4) The Depthwise Separable (DS) convolution is introduced to
    the convolution layer in the encoder (reduce the number and parameters and computation
    complexity). The SR-SegNetv2 uses dilated convolution in the modified residual
    block instead of standard convolution. The SR-SegNet extracts small water bodies
    (lakes) and narrow rivers well. The SR-SegNet outperforms FCN, SegNet, and DeconvNet.
    In Guo et al. 2020b, a multi-scale water extraction convolutional neural network
    (MWEN) was developed to detect water bodies from GF-1 RS images. The MWEN structure
    comprises three essential components: an encoder, a multi-scale feature extractor
    (MTFE), and a decoder. The encoder extracts the features from the input and generates
    the encoder feature maps (with output stride =16). The MTFE generates multi-scale
    features by simultaneously performing dilated convolution operations with different
    dilation rates (rate = 0, 2, 4, and 8) on the encoder feature maps. Then, these
    multi-scale features were concatenated and further processed by three convolutional
    layers. Finally, the decoder converts the MTFE feature maps into segmented images
    through the upsampling and convolution layers. The encoder and decoder have been
    configured with a depth of 4. The multi-scale features extracted from MTFE were
    useful in suppressing noise, such as building and mountain shadows, highways,
    dark lawns, and roofs. Since the MTFE feature maps were extracted using dilated
    convolutions, they can extract water bodies of various sizes, such as tiny rivers,
    open ponds, plateau lakes, and small puddles. The MWEN outperforms FCN, Unet,
    and DeepLab V3+ by the performance metrics OA, True water rate (TWR), false water
    rate (FWR), water IoU, and mIoU. The multi-scale lake water extraction network
    (MSLWENet) was developed to identify the small lakes from the Google Earth RS
    images (Wang et al. 2020b). MSLWENet was designed using the encoder, feature extraction
    module, and decoder. The encoder in the MSLWENet was designed using a modified
    ResNet-101 structure (3×3 DS convolution + BN + ReLU between two 1×1 conv + BN
    + ReLU, with 1×1 conv + downsample in the identity path). This structure extracts
    high-level features and feeds the feature maps to the feature extractor module.
    Like MWEN, the MSLWENet feature extraction module has four paths for extracting
    features at different scales. Each path has three stages of dilated convolution
    operation with skip connections for using reuse information from the previous
    layers. The reuse information is concatenated only after the first and second
    dilation convolution operations. The feature maps from the third stage of dilated
    convolution are concatenated with other path feature maps to produce multi-scale
    feature maps. These multi-scale feature maps help to extract small water bodies
    and suppress the noises due to shadows and snow. Finally, the multi-scale features
    are sent to the decoder for upsampling the feature maps into the original resolution
    of the input. Additionally, the features from the encoders are transferred to
    the decoder (through skip connections). These features are processed through convolutional
    layers, concatenation, and added to the decoder features before the final classification
    layer. These skip connection features from shallow (rich in spatial details) and
    deep layers (rich in semantic details) improve the water extraction accuracy.
    MSLWENet outperforms Unet, MWEN, PSPNet, and DeepLab V3+ by the performance metrics
    OA, Recall, mIoU, TWR, and FWR. The water body extraction neural network (WBE-NN)
    was designed for SWM from high-resolution RS images (Chen et al. 2020b). The WBE-NN
    comprises the Global Spatial-Spectral Convolution (GSSC) module, multiscale learning
    module, and boundary refinement module. The GSSC module uses 3D convolution followed
    by 3D max pooling operation to extract features from the input images. However,
    to reduce the computational cost, the 3D convolution is decomposed into 2D spatial
    convolution followed by 1D spectral convolution. Similarly, 3D max pooling is
    decomposed into 2D spatial and 1D spectral max pooling. Second, the multiscale
    learning module comprises upsampling, feature extractor, and feature fusion modules.
    In the upsampling module, the features from the GSSC module are upsampled and
    down-sampled to get three different-sized patches. These different-sized patches
    are processed separately by the feature extractor module through four stages of
    spatial-spectral convolution. The feature extractor extracts features at different
    scales (global and local features), and finally, three low-resolution maps are
    fused and upsampled to the original dimension. The boundary refinement module
    combines the direct path coarse maps and residual path (designed using two spectral-spatial
    convolutions of 3×3×4 and 1×1×4) fine maps through elementwise summation to retain
    the boundary information. WBE-NN accurately classifies cloud, mountain, and building
    shadows as water compared to NDWI and SVM. WBE-NN outperforms other DL models
    CNN+ superpixel, Unet, and Deep U-Net + CRF by the performance metrics OA, Kappa,
    and Boundary overall accuracy (BOA). However, WBE-NN slightly underperforms in
    identifying narrow rivers. The MLP was used to produce the surface water map of
    China for 2015 (SWMC-2015) using Landsat 8 OLI images (Jiang et al. 2020). The
    structure and the hyperparameters used to design and train the MLP were similar
    to the previous study (Jiang et al. 2018). The MLP was trained with TOA reflectance
    data and their corresponding class labels (water and land). The mixed pixels in
    river banks, coastal areas, and wetlands were not considered for training. The
    results were compared with the Global 3 arc-second Water Body Map (G3WBM) reference
    data. The OA and kappa of SWMC-2015 are 90% and 0.78. The reduction in accuracy
    is due to 1) misclassification of water pixels in wetlands and marshes area, 2)
    mixed pixels at the edges, and 3) coarse resolution of the sensor (Surface water
    smaller than the pixel resolution is unidentifiable). A multi-dimensional, densely
    connected CNN was designed to extract the water bodies in the Poyang Lake basin
    using GF-1 satellite images (Wang et al. 2020c). Since DenseNet was used as a
    feature extraction network, it is named DenseNet. Like DenseNet (Huang et al.
    2017), it has four stages of dense blocks designed with 1×1 and 3×3 convolution.
    The transition block lies between the dense blocks and contains 1×1 convolution
    followed by a 2×2 pooling layer. Like the encoder, the decoder has four stages,
    each stage designed with two 3×3 convolution followed by transpose convolution,
    which performs the upsampling operation. The skip connections were used in the
    model to combine each stage''s encoder features to the corresponding decoder feature
    maps by concatenation operation. The decoder gradually increases the spatial resolution
    of the feature maps, similar to the input spatial resolution. In addition to DenseNet121,
    DenseNet169, and DenseNet201, DenseNet79 and DenseNet63 were proposed by adjusting
    the number of dense blocks in the architecture. The DenseNet79 was designed using
    3, 6, 12, and 16 dense blocks in each stage. Similarly, DenseNet63 was designed
    using 3, 6, 12, and 8 dense blocks in each stage. Among the five architectures,
    DenseNet79 performs better than others by the performance metrics, recall (0.904),
    F1-Score (0.931), and mIoU (0.872). The DenseNet79 outperforms ResNet, VGG, SegNet,
    DeepLabV3+, and NDWI. The DenseNet accurately extracts small rivers and lakes
    and effectively separates small rivers in cities and bridges in river networks.
    The DenseNet performs better in discriminating mountain shadows, towns, and bare
    lands but fails in cloud shadows. A multi-scale context extractor network (MSCENet)was
    developed to extract water bodies from high-resolution satellite images (Kang
    et al. 2021). MSCENet architecture contains an encoder, context feature extractor,
    and decoder modules. The encoder block accepts the input images and performs convolution
    (3×3) with a stride of 2 and double convolution (3×3) with a stride of 1 to generate
    low-level feature maps. Then, the features are processed by three Res2net layers
    with the number of Res2net blocks as 3, 4, and 6, respectively. The Res2net block
    is the modified version of the bottleneck layer. After one convolution layer (1×1),
    the input feature maps split equally into N feature maps. The output feature map
    is taken from (Kang et al. 2021), Eq. (1)) and it is expressed as $${y}_n=\\left\\{\\begin{array}{c}{x}_n\\kern3em
    n=1\\\\ {}{k}_n\\left({x}_n\\right)\\kern1em \\textit{n}=2\\\\ {}{k}_n\\left({x}_n+{y}_{n-1}\\right)\\kern1em
    2<\\textit{n}\\le N\\end{array}\\right.\\ \\textrm{Where}\\ {x}_n,n\\in \\left\\{1,2,3.\\dots
    N\\right\\}$$ (4) Then, feature maps were processed by one more convolution (1×1)
    and concatenated with the input feature to produce the final encoder features.
    The encoder feature maps are applied to the context feature extractor module.
    The context feature extractor module contains Assorted dilated convolution (ADC)
    followed by Complex Multi-kernel pooling (CMP) modules. ADC uses dilated convolution
    to extract the global contextual information, and CMP uses a strip pooling unit
    to highlight the spatial features of water classes. CMP also extracts contextual
    information using various multi-kernel pooling layers of different sizes. The
    CMP concatenates features from multi-kernel pooling layers and strip pooling unit.
    The decoder uses upsampling (bilinear interpolation) and a Double convolution
    layer to recover segmented maps from feature maps. In addition, encoder feature
    maps are added in the decoder using skip connection to enhance feature robustness.
    MSCENet outperforms Unet, SegNet, PSPNet, MWEN, FCN8, DeepLab v3+, and DANet by
    the performance metrics OA, kappa, F1-score, and mIoU. MSCENet performs well in
    extracting water bodies of different sizes, shapes, distributions, and environmental
    conditions. The DeepLabv3 is an extended version of DeepLab2, which uses ResNet-101
    as the backbone to extract low and high-level features. The last two convolution
    block uses atrous convolution (i.e., dilated convolution) to extract global contextual
    information. The atrous convolution increases the field of view (receptive field).
    The Atrous spatial pyramid pooling (ASPP) module was introduced to enhance feature
    extraction at multiple scales. The ASPP module simultaneously applies a convolutional
    kernel with different dilation rates on the encoder feature maps. Then, the multiscale
    features are concatenated and processed by convolutional layers, followed by upsampling
    to produce the final segmentation map. DeepLabv3-ResNet-101 was used to extract
    the water bodies specifically for three study areas (Florida, New York, and Shanghai)
    (James et al. 2021). Initially, the model (DeepLabv3_global) was trained on the
    global dataset (33,311) to extract water bodies globally. Then, the trained model
    was independently retrained on the three datasets (Florida 2314, New York 1912,
    and Shanghai 2345) to extract water bodies for specific locations. The model trained
    for specific locations (DeepLabv3_Florida, DeepLabv3_New_York, DeepLabv3_Shanghai)
    performs better than the global (DeepLabv3_global). The Lightweight Multi-Scale
    Land Surface Water Extraction Network (LMSWENet) was developed using the encoder,
    feature extractor, bottleneck module, and decoder for SWM (Duan et al. 2021).
    The encoder and decoder have four stages. Each stage has two convolutional layers
    followed by Spatial and Channel Squeeze and Excitation (scSE) and Pooling layers.
    The convolutional layers extract high-level semantic information from the input
    images. The scSE block contains the Spatial Squeeze and Channel Excitation (cSE)
    (to give importance to the channel information) and the Channel Squeeze and Spatial
    Excitation (sSE) block (pays more attention to the spatial information). The scSE
    block provides more weightage to the relevant features (water) and ignores others
    (non-water features). Then, the pooling layers perform down sampling and provide
    higher activation for the features having more weightage. Like MWEN (Guo et al.
    2020b), the feature extractor receives the encoder features and processes them
    using four dilated convolutions with dilation rates of 0, 2, 4, and 8 to extract
    the spatial contextual information. The output features are fed to the bottleneck
    module to reduce the trainable parameters and data dimensions. Finally, the decoder
    upsamples the low-resolution feature maps into the original input dimension using
    the same structure adapted in the encoder. LMSWENet compared with DeeplabV3+,
    FCN, PSPNet, and UNet using the performance metrics OA, Recall, F1-score, error
    rate, mean precision, mIoU, and WIoU. The LMSWENet with other variants, \"LMSWENet
    without scSE\" and \"LMSWENet without dilated convolution\" was developed and
    compared. The \"LMSWENet without scSE\" fails to suppress noises from water floats
    and shadows. Similarly, \"LMSWENet without dilated convolution\" cannot extract
    small ponds and streams. LMSWENet faces challenges in extracting playgrounds,
    sports fields, small shadows in urban areas, water floats, and connecting parts
    in sub-urban areas. A Dense Local Feature Compression (DLFC) Network was designed
    to extract water bodies from multi-sensor RS images (Li et al. 2021). The DLFC
    is composed of an encoder and a decoder. The encoder has five stages designed
    with a dense block and transition layer combination (except the last stage; the
    last stage only has a dense block). Similarly, the decoder layer has five stages
    with dense block and transpose layer combinations. The dense block contains three
    layers with a growth rate = 32. The transition layer contains 1×1 convolution,
    a dropout layer (rate = 0.2), and 2×2 average pooling. The transpose layer contains
    a 3×3 convolution layer with ReLU activation. The local feature compression (LFC)
    module was introduced (designed using two convolution layers with kernel sizes
    of 7×7 and 5×5) to strengthen the high-level abstract features. LFC accepts high-level
    abstract features from each encoder stage through skip connections and produces
    LFC features. Each dense block in the decoder receives combined features from
    the previous layer and LFC features of the corresponding stage. Group Normalization
    (GN) is used rather than Batch Normalization (BN) to produce stable accuracy in
    various batch sizes. DLFC performs better in extracting water bodies in urban
    areas, where many low albedo objects have similar spectral reflectance. DLFC outperforms
    other water body extraction techniques such as NDWI, SVM, Unet, Deep U-Net, and
    DeepLabv3+ by performance metrics such as OA, F1-Score, and IoU. DLFC cannot extract
    slender water bodies (less than 2 pixels) and suffers from incomplete extraction
    of small water bodies. In (Yu et al. 2021), the water bodies were extracted from
    RS images using a self-attention capsule feature pyramid network (SA-CapsFPN).
    The SA-CapsFPN was designed using the encoder-decoder structure. The encoder module
    starts with two conventional convolutional layers, followed by capsule convolution
    and pooling layers. The capsule layer was designed using conventional convolution
    operations. The advantage of the capsule layer over conventional convolution is
    powerful feature extraction and representation capabilities. After the first two
    convolutional layers, the encoder has four stages of capsule blocks to extract
    different-level and scale feature maps. Each stage contains capsule convolutional
    and capsule max-pooling layers. Within each stage, the capsule convolutional layer
    maintains the exact spatial dimensions. The capsule max-pooling layers down-sample
    the feature maps by factor two. This step increases the capsule’s field of view.
    The deepest capsule layer has semantically strong feature representations. The
    dimension of the capsule layer was fixed to 16. The max-pooling operations reduce
    the localization details, and feature maps are partially damaged in the resultant
    low-resolution feature maps. A context augmentation and self-attention (CA-SA)
    module was introduced to address this issue. The CA-SA module is divided into
    CA and SA modules. The CA module was designed with four parallel paths operated
    on input feature maps. The four paths (first three paths: 3×3 dilated convolution
    with rate=1,2 and 3; fourth path: two 3×3 dilated convolution with rate = 3 and
    5) were used to extract contextual information. Then, a 1×1 dilated convolution
    is applied to smooth the feature maps, followed by concatenation and further applied
    1×1 dilated convolution to get output feature maps. The inclusion of the CA module
    identifies water bodies of different sizes. The output feature maps are fed to
    the SA module to highlight the relevant features and ignore others. The SA module
    has channel and attention descriptors. The FC layers with ReLU and sigmoid activations
    exploit channel-wise interdependencies. In the decoder, the feature maps are upsampled
    by the capsule deconvolution layer and concatenated with feature maps from the
    encoder (obtained through skip connections). The concatenated feature maps are
    processed by a 3×3 capsule convolution layer to module the channel number. Concatenating
    the upsampled low-resolution features (semantically more robust features coming
    from the deep layer) with high-resolution features (better localization information
    from the encoder features through skip connections) provides the high-resolution
    semantically strong feature maps. After four decoder stages, the water prediction
    map was obtained with the exact spatial resolution as the original input image.
    The SA-CapsFPN outperforms other DL models FCN, Deep Unet + CRF + RR, DeepLabv3+,
    RRF DeconvNet, and MSR-Net by the performance metrics precision, recall, and F1-score.
    SA-CapsFPN misclassifies shadows of high-rise objects (buildings, bridges, and
    trees) as water bodies. The lightweight MobileNetV2 architecture was designed
    to extract the complex water bodies from three different RS images (GF-2, World
    View-2, and Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV)) (Wang et al. 2021). After Geometric
    correction and radiometric calibration, the Mean shift segmentation was applied
    to cropped images to combine pixels with similar spectral and textural characteristics.
    Then, the cropped images were split into training, validation, and test datasets.
    MobileNetV2 architecture is an improved version of MobileNetV1, and it has an
    inverted residual block, linear bottleneck, and ReLU6 activation function. The
    inverted residual block has a skip connection, which transfers the shallow features
    to deep layers (solves the network degradation problem). Linear bottleneck replaces
    ReLU with Linear activation in the last layer of the bottleneck structure. ReLU6
    shows more robustness in the low-precision calculation. The performance of MobileNetV2
    was evaluated by four performance metrics (precision, recall, F1-score, and kappa)
    and compared with SVM, RF, and U-Net. MobileNetV3 has less computations, parameters,
    and training time than U-Net. MobileNetV2 effectively extracts complete boundary
    information of broken water bodies, slender rivers, and ditches. The MobileNetV2
    has some problems in the generalization test: salt and pepper noise, misclassification
    of artificial facilities near water bodies, and incomplete extraction of slender
    and broken water bodies. Similarly, MobileNetV2 has a problem with extracting
    small and mixed water bodies (eutrophic water bodies, irrigated farmland with
    crops, and vegetation around the water bodies). The MobileNetV2 model performs
    better when trained with low and high-spatial-resolution images. The multichannel
    water body detection network (MC-WBDN) was constructed using three novel components:
    a multichannel fusion module, an Enhanced Atrous Spatial Pyramid Pooling module
    (ESAPP), and Space-to-Depth (S2D)/Depth-to-Space (D2S) operations (Yuan et al.
    2021). The multichannel fusion module processes three input images, including
    the RGB channels, NIR channel, and SWIR channel, using convolution kernels and
    generates feature maps of the same size. Then, the feature maps were concatenated
    and served as input to our backbone encoder-decoder network, which is responsible
    for pixel-level labeling. The encoder was designed by the ResNet-34 model, which
    has four stages of feature extraction network. The ESAPP module further enhanced
    these feature maps of the encoder. The ESAPP has parallel convolution layers with
    different dilation rates for extracting rich contextual information. S2D and D2S
    operations can mitigate the issues associated with information loss resulting
    from upsampling and downsampling operations. The S2D transforms pixels from their
    original locations to channel dimensions. S2D preserves more local features, which
    are helpful in the decoder process. The S2D was treated as an intramodal augmentation
    to examine inputs with varying pixel shifts. D2S reverses the procedure. D2S,
    an alternative to transposed convolutions in upsampling, improves channel information
    exchange. While training, MC-WBDN combines a pixel-wise Binary Cross Entropy (BCE
    Loss) and region-based loss (Dice Loss) term to reduce errors and optimize regions''
    smoothness. MC-WBDN outperforms other conventional spectral indices (NDWI, NDMI,
    and MNDWI) and DL models (Unet, D-LinkNet, DeepLabV3+, sharp mask, and kemker)
    in terms of mIoU. Moreover, compared to other methods, MC-WBDN performs better
    in extracting water bodies in varying light and weather conditions. The W-Net,
    an end-to-end multi feature-based CNN model, was constructed for SWM using Landsat
    8 OLI images (Tambe et al. 2021). The W-Net has a contracting path and an expanding
    path. The contracting path was five stages, each designed using an Encoder Unit
    (EU) followed by an Inception Down Unit (IDU). Similarly, the expanding path has
    five stages, and each stage was designed using a Decoder Unit (DU) followed by
    an Inception Up unit (IUU). The Bottleneck Unit (BU) connects the fifth stage
    IDU to the first stage DU without changing spatial dimension. The EU unit contains
    two 3×3 convolutions (stride=1) followed by 2×2 max pooling. Similarly, the DU
    unit has upsampling (by factor 2) followed by transpose convolution. IDU was designed
    using the Inception module, which significantly increases computational efficiency
    by reducing the number of trainable parameters. The trainable parameters were
    further reduced by factorizing the symmetric convolution into asymmetric convolution.
    The 3×3 convolution was factorized into 1×3 convolution followed by 3×1 convolution.
    Similarly, the 5×5 convolution in the inception module was replaced by two 3×3
    convolution, followed by spatial factorization. BU has two 3×3 filter convolution
    layers followed by a first DU. The IUU is similar to IDU, replacing convolution
    with transpose convolution. The output of the expanding path was given as input
    to refinement modules—the contrast stretching for enhancement and Gaussian filtering
    followed by canny edge detection. The Gaussian filtering reduces the blurriness
    and improves the prediction quality. Whereas edge detection refines the continuity
    and discontinuity of boundary pixels of the water body. The W-Net outperforms
    other DL models, Unet, Deep Unet, Deepcrack, and DeepWMV2, by the performance
    metrics OA, precision, recall, F1-score, and mIoU. The W-net shows promising effects
    in extracting narrow river networks. The multiscale residual network (MSResNet)
    was constructed with self-supervised learning (SSL) for SWM (Dang and Li, 2021).
    The MSResNet has an encoder and decoder architecture with a bottleneck containing
    Multiscale Dilated Convolution (MSDC) and Multichannel Max Pooling (MKMP) Modules.
    The MSResNet uses ResNet34 as a feature extraction network. The skip connections
    in the architecture were replaced by residual blocks, which reduces the semantic
    gap and eliminates the vanishing and exploding problems. The high-level feature
    maps from the encoder were fed to the MSDC module, which enables the effective
    encoding of high-level semantic feature maps. Furthermore, it enables the collection
    of diverse contextual information from various levels. The MSDC was constructed
    by six parallel convolution layers with different dilation rates (rate = 1, 2,
    4, 8, and 16). The output of MSDC was fed to the MKMP module, which uses different
    pooling sizes (2, 3, 5, and 6) to extract global and local features. The MKMP
    outputs the feature maps of different sizes; later, it was applied to 1×1 convolution
    for dimensionality reduction, followed by upsampling and concatenation. The feature
    maps from MKMP enter the decoder section, which gradually recovers the segmentation
    map from the feature maps. The SSL technique was adopted during the training of
    MSResNet with total loss function was the combination of SSL loss and supervised
    learning loss. Based on previous knowledge of water bodies in optical images,
    four SSL strategies were considered: geometric transformation, noise disturbance,
    image resolution, and image context fusion learning. The MSResNet + SSL (geometric
    transformation) technique outperforms MSResNet without SSL and other state-of-the-art
    DL models LinkNet, HR-Net, DeepLabV3+, FCN, and MECNet by the performance metrics
    OA and mIoU. The MSResNet could effectively discern water bodies of varying sizes
    and shapes and helped to preserve water boundaries. In contrast to conventional
    CNN that only relies on global or local features for water body extraction, (Lu
    et al. 2022) developed a new framework called neighbor sampler that incorporates
    neighbor information. The neighbor sampler divided the input RS images into the
    number of neighbor images. The weakly supervised DL model named neighbor feature
    aggregation network (NFANet) was designed and trained initially by neighbor images
    and point labels. The full supervision model uses pixel labels, whereas the weak
    supervision model uses point labels as initial supervision. The NFANet has a feature
    aggregation and post-processing module that generates the pseudo labels. The pseudo-labels
    were put into the neighbor sampler to generate pseudo-label groups and retrain
    the NFANet using neighbor image groups and pseudo-label groups. By recursive training,
    the boundaries of water bodies were extracted smoothly without blurring. The NFANet
    outperforms other state-of-the-art weak supervision approaches by the performance
    metrics, IoU, and Dice coefficient. The NFANet performs slightly less than full
    supervision methods in extracting edge water pixels. However, the labeling cost
    is much less than the full supervision method. The NFANet suffers from misclassifying
    small water bodies as land and vice-versa. In some cases, the NFANet performs
    better than full supervision methods. The lightweight U-Net, BU-Net, was constructed
    for SWM from the RS images (An and Rui, 2022). The structure of BU-Net was similar
    to Unet but designed with bottleneck blocks instead of conventional convolution
    layers. The encoder was designed using bottleneck blocks and max pooling layers.
    Similarly, the decoder was designed using bottleneck block and upsampling layers.
    The bottleneck block was designed using the sequence of 1×1, 3×3, and 1×1 convolution
    layers. The skip connections were used to transfer features from the encoder and
    combine them in the decoder stage. The BU-Net outperforms other DL models, such
    as Unet, SegNet, ResNet, DenseNet, PSPNet, and NDWI, by the performance metrics
    OA, F1-Score, and IoU. The parameter benefit measure was formulated to reflect
    the benefits of using parameters in the model. The BU-Net performs better in extracting
    large continuous water bodies, discriminating boats and reefs in the water bodies.
    However, BU-Net misclassifies paddy fields, some residential and industrial lands
    as water bodies, and slender river networks were incompletely extracted. The Multi-scale
    Information Enhancement Network (MIE-Net) was constructed to accurately extract
    the lakes from the RS images (Zhong et al. 2022). The MIE-Net comprises the encoder,
    Two Way Channel Attention Mechanism (TWCAM), and decoder. The encoder was constructed
    by five Deep-Down Sampling Blocks (D-DSB). Each D-DSB block contains a Deep Dilation
    Residual Structure (DDRS) and pooling layer. The DDRS block was designed by local
    feature extraction and deep feature extraction modules. The local feature extraction
    module structure was similar to ASPP, which uses three parallel convolution layers
    with different dilation rates to extract the contextual information. The contextual
    information is valuable for extracting small water bodies. The deep feature extraction
    module contains two residual blocks (two 3×3 convolution + BN + ReLU) to extract
    deep features. Finally, the deep and local features were combined and sent to
    TWCAM. The TWCAM enhances and suppresses the water and noise features by adopting
    weight increase and denoise modules. After suppressing the noise, the denoised
    feature maps were fed into the weight increase module. In the weight increase
    module, the denoised feature maps fed into two channel attention mechanisms adopted
    by global average pooling and global max pooling to collect background and water
    texture features. The two FC layers with activation functions were used in each
    channel attention mechanism to enhance the water features by giving more weight.
    The final feature maps were obtained by concatenating the feature maps from the
    two-channel attention mechanism. The decoder was constructed by five Convolution-Up
    Sampling Blocks (C-USB). Instead of an upsampling operation, upsampling convolution
    was performed to avoid the loss of detailed information. The performance of MIE-Net
    outperforms other DL models Unet, DeepLabV3+, DP-Net, DCN-Net, LA-Net, and MAP-Net
    by the performance metrics mean pixel accuracy (mPA), mean target accuracy (mTA),
    and mIoU. The multiscale residual and SE-attention Network (MRSE-Net) was constructed
    to extract surface water bodies from the RS images (Zhang et al. 2022). As the
    name indicates, it comprises multiscale residual blocks and Squeeze and Excitation
    (SE) attention modules. MRSE-Net has an encoder, bottleneck layer, and decoder.
    The encoder has four stages, and each stage was designed using a multiscale residual
    module. The multiscale residual module structure was similar to the inception
    module; instead of employing 3×3, 5×5, and 7×7 convolution in parallel, it was
    decomposed into a series of three 3×3 convolutions along with residual connection
    using a 1×1 convolution. Two successive 3×3 and three 3×3 convolutional layers
    provide outputs similar to 5×5 and 7×7 operations, respectively. The multiscale
    residual module evaluates targets at multiple scales and extracts detailed high-level
    features. Instead of max pooling and upsampling, the strided convolution and D2S
    modules were used to downscale and upscale feature maps. The extraction accuracy
    was improved by incorporating improved skip connection and SE attention modules
    in the network. The SE-attention module uses a feature channel recalibration strategy
    to adjust the weights of each channel based on their contribution to the network.
    The network automatically obtains new weights for each feature channel based on
    learned global information to improve extraction accuracy. The SE attention uses
    global average pooling to compress the feature maps in the spatial dimension.
    Then, new weights were assigned to each channel (from 0 to 1) using two FC layers.
    Finally, multiplying the new weight value by the 2D matrix of the original feature
    map channel provides the final output. The bottleneck layer was designed using
    two residual modules, each containing three residual blocks for feature learning.
    The decoder features have undergone more processing layers, which have high-level
    semantic information than encoder features. Directly combining them using skip
    connections causes a semantic gap, which hinders network optimization. Two forms
    of improved skip connections were introduced to alleviate the semantic gap problem:
    multiscale residual skip connections and inception layer skip connections. The
    MRSE-Net outperforms other methods such as NDWI, MNDWI, MLP, Unet, DeepUNet, DeepwatermapV2,
    Deepwatermap-3, Deepcrack, and FCN8 by the performance metrics, precision, recall,
    and F1-score. MRSE-Net performs better in extracting large and small-scale water
    bodies (e.g., narrow rivers and lakes). Multihead attention mechanism guided ConvLSTM
    (MAGC-Net) was designed for pixel-level segmentation of ocean RS images (Pang
    and Gao, 2022). Three RS images were selected as study areas, including island,
    beach, and sea ice. Then, grayscale, texture, and HSV features were extracted
    and concatenated to feed two parallel convolution layers for further feature extraction.
    The Multihead attention module contains Global Average Pooling (GAP), Average
    Pooling (AP), and Maxpooling (MP) Attention modules. These three attention modules
    were applied to the feature vector of each pixel and assigned weight coefficients
    for each pixel. The combination of Multihead attention mechanisms provides fusion
    features that offer enhanced deep features for the ConvLSTM layers. The three
    parallel ConvLSTM layers facilitate the processing of deep features, resulting
    in the reduction of redundant features and the enhancement of feature fusion.
    The output features of three ConvLSTM layers were concatenated and fed to the
    Conv1D layer, followed by sigmoid activation, which was used for pixel prediction.
    The pyramid split attention Network (PSAGNet) was designed by integrating pyramid
    split attention and gated convolution modules (Fang et al. 2022). PSAGNet enhances
    the accuracy of small water body extraction in complicated RS situations. The
    gated convolution module effectively captures the morphological characteristics
    of small water bodies from the shallow feature map of the encoder. The pyramid
    split attention module enables the extraction and fusion of high-order features
    from multi-scale water bodies, hence offering significant feature encoding that
    enhances the accuracy of water body extraction. A unique loss function known as
    FE loss was introduced to mitigate the challenges posed by fuzzy boundaries and
    class imbalance within the dataset. The proposed method dramatically enhances
    the delineation of water bodies. The PSAGNet performs better in extracting small
    water bodies accurately. The Pyramid Scene Parsing Network (PSPNet) (Zhao et al.
    2017) was initially designed for semantic segmentation, especially for Scene parsing.
    Later, the PSPNet was used for RS applications for LULC mapping. The PSPNet was
    designed using the encoder and pyramid pooling module (PPM). The encoder is the
    typical CNN architecture (ResNet) that extracts high-level image features. The
    PPM extracts global contextual information by applying different pooling kernels
    on high-level feature maps. The levels and size of kernels vary based on the size
    of input feature maps. The 1×1, 2×2, 3×3, and 6×6 pooling kernels were used to
    extract global and sub-region contextual information. Then, we applied the convolution
    layer for channel dimension reduction. Later, the output of all the PPM feature
    maps was upsampled to the original input feature map dimension and concatenated.
    Finally, the output feature map was applied to the convolutional layer for pixel
    classification. The PSPNet was modified to accept multispectral images and used
    for water body extraction. The Improved PSPNet was designed to detect shorelines
    in difficult inland river conditions (Yin et al. 2023). The Improved PSPNet has
    two modifications from the original PSPNet. First, the inclusion of an attention
    module called Convolutional Block Attention Module (CBAM) in the first and last
    layer of the encoder (ResNet50). This approach assigns more importance (weights)
    to the region of interest (water bodies) than other classes. CBAM has a channel
    attention block followed by a spatial attention block. The channel attention block
    compresses the spatial dimension of the input feature to a single vector using
    pooling layers (max- and average pooling) followed by MLP. The features from the
    channel attention block were element-wise multiplied with the original input feature
    to feed the spatial attention block. Then, the spatial attention block determines
    the max-and average-pooling features, followed by concatenation and sigmoid. The
    spatial attention feature was multiplied with the channel attention feature to
    get refined feature maps. The spatial attention compresses the channels. Second,
    the atrous convolution module was added parallel to PPM to extract multiscale
    contextual information. The atrous convolution uses dilated convolution, which
    expands the receptive field without additional parameters. The encoder features
    (shallow), PPM, and atrous convolution features were concatenated and fed to the
    convolution layer for per-pixel classification. These two modifications improve
    the irregular water shoreline extraction and eliminate the misclassification errors
    due to walls and reflection areas. Improved PSPNet outperforms Unet, PSPNet, and
    DeepLabv3. The performance of various state-of-the-art FCN models was analyzed
    for water body extraction (Billson et al. 2023). FPN, DeepLabV3+, Swin-Unet, Unet,
    Unet++, Attention Unet, and R2U-Net were the FCN models considered for the analysis.
    The FCN models were evaluated on different loss functions and various input combinations.
    The R2U-Net performs better than other FCN models if trained by combining BCE
    and Jaccard Loss function. The BCE emphasizes pixel-wise loss, whereas Jaccard
    emphasizes region-based loss. Similarly, all the FCN models were trained with
    different input combinations (RGB, NIR, and multispectral). Unsurprisingly, FCN
    models trained on multispectral inputs produce better IoU than the FCN models
    trained on RGB and NIR inputs. The narrow rivers and small lakes were missed by
    the FCN models trained on RGB. Another major issue in the water extraction from
    RS images is that class imbalance. i.e., the region of interest (water pixels)
    was significantly less than non-water pixels. A novel pixel category Transplantation
    (PCT) was implemented to address the class imbalance issue by transferring the
    water features from the source tile to the destination tile. The augmented tile
    after applying PCT is considered from ((Billson et al. 2023), Eq. (9)) and it
    is represented by $$T_{PCT}=\\left(M\\;\\odot\\;T_{source}\\right)+\\left(\\widetilde
    M\\;\\odot\\;T_{destination}\\right)$$ (5) Where M is the water mask of the source
    tile representing 1 for water and 0 for non-water. ʘ is the elementwise multiplication.
    \\(\\overset{\\sim }{M}\\) is an inversion of M. Using PCT, the water feature
    from one tile can be transferred to another. Transferring the same water features
    has the risk of overfitting. Two methods can avoid overfitting: 1) random subsampling
    and 2) using small water features from multiple source tiles instead of transferring
    from a single tile. The R2U-Net, utilizing the combined loss function (BCE+ Jaccard),
    multispectral input, and PCT, performs better in extracting water bodies, especially
    narrow river networks running through mountainous and valley regions. The performance
    of three DL models, Unet, DeepLabV3+, and PSPNet, was analyzed for surface water
    body extraction on GF-2 RS images (Shi et al. 2023). A total of six DL models
    were constructed by varying the feature extraction network (backbone network)
    of the above three DL models. The Mobilenetv2_PSPNet, Resnet50_PSPNet, Mobilenetv2_DeepLabV3+,
    Xception_DeepLabV3+, Resnet50_Unet, and vgg16_Unet were the six DL models considered
    for water body extraction. Among the six DL models, vgg16_Unet (Unet with Vgg16
    as feature extraction network) performs better in extracting water bodies. It
    outperforms other DL models by the performance metrics, accuracy, precision, IoU,
    mIoU, Pixel Accuracy (PA), and mPA.Then, the performance of vgg16_Unet was further
    improved by introducing three different attention mechanisms (ECA-vgg16_UNet,
    MS-CAM-vgg16_UNet, CBAM-vgg16_Unet). The attention mechanism was applied to the
    concatenated feature maps (feature maps from upsampling + feature maps from encoder
    via skip connections) at each stage of the decoder section. The attention mechanism
    emphasizes the relevant objects (water) and ignores irrelevant parts (non-water).
    Among the three attention mechanisms, the CBAM combined with vgg16_Unet performs
    better in all the performance measures. The CBAM-Vgg16_Unet model was also evaluated
    on GF-1, GF-6, Hyperion/ EO1, and Landsat 8 OLI datasets. The Faster R-CNN combined
    with Region Proposal Network (RPN) was used to detect and localize the water bodies
    in RS images (Gharbia, 2023). The sentinel-2 and Landsat 8 OLI images captured
    over the Egypt region were selected as the study area. The RPN generates the candidate
    object region, and the Region of Interest (ROI) pooling layer extracts features
    from it. The extracted features were fed into FC layers to classify the objects.
    The performance of Faster R-CNN was compared with CNN by the performance metrics,
    OA, precision, recall, and F1-Score. The OA of faster R-CNN was 98.7% and 96.1%
    for sentinel-2 and Landsat 8 OLI datasets, respectively. The customized U-net
    (encoder and decoder architecture) was constructed with attention modules and
    residual blocks for SWM (Kadhim and Premaratne, 2023). The customized U-net has
    four stages, where each stage has strided convolution (for downsampling) followed
    by a residual block. The four stages of the encoder extract the multiscale features
    using residual blocks. The residual block comprises two 3×3 convolutions followed
    by BN and ReLU for feature extraction. The CBAM attention module was attached
    as the bottleneck layer, which accepts encoder feature maps to focus on relevant
    features (water features). Then, the feature maps were passed to the decoder section.
    Each stage in the decoder concatenates the feature maps from the encoder and feature
    maps from the previous layer. Transpose convolution with the stride of 2 was used
    for upsampling the feature maps. The combined features in each decoder stage were
    passed to the residual block for feature extraction. The features from each decoder
    stage were concatenated and fed to another CBAM attention module. The final classification
    layer accepts input from the CBAM module and uses the sigmoid activation function
    to provide the segmentation map. This customized U-net outperforms residual U-net,
    Unet, and MRSE-net by the performance metrics, precision, sensitivity, Dice-score,
    specificity, and accuracy. However, this model fails to extract narrow rivers
    and complex water boundaries. The multiscale successive attention fusion network
    (MSAFNet) was proposed that combines multi-level feature aggregation and attention
    mechanism to extract water bodies from RS images (Lyu et al. 2023). The MSAFNet
    progressively captures semantic information and spatial features at different
    scales. The MSAFNet contains a successive attention fusion module (SAFM) and Joint
    attention module (JAM) in the encoder and a feature fusion module (FFM) in the
    decoder. In the encoder, the ResNet50 was used to extract the multi-level features.
    The SAFM employs a single-level attention block (SAB) and multi-level fusion block
    (MFB) to provide attention to relevant feature maps. The SAB applies patch-wise
    average pooling to extract informative features from feature maps of different
    scales and fuse them. The global average pooling was applied on fused multi-level
    feature maps to obtain global attention. The JAM was constructed by a patch-based
    local attention block (PLAB) and position self-attention block (PSAB). The JAM
    was applied to high-level encoder features to enhance feature maps further and
    suppress the noises. The PLAB improves channel relevance of local features by
    concentrating on local contextual information, and PSAB extracts correlation between
    two pixels. Finally, the enhanced low-level and high-level features were aggregated
    by FFM. FFM alleviates the problem of misclassifying mixed pixels at the edges
    of water bodies. The MSAFNet outperforms other DL models UNet, PSPNet, DeepLabV3+,
    UNet++, U2-Net, Attention-UNet, FCN + CBAM, FCN + DA, FCN + SE, MSNANet, and LANet
    by the performance metrics, OA, Kappa, F1-Score, and mIoU. The MSAFNet accurately
    extracts small continuous water bodies and shows promising effects in mitigating
    noises such as building shadows, clouds, and glaciers. SWM using Transformation
    Techniques The LBV transformation was used to extract the water bodies from Landsat
    8 OLI images (Zhang et al. 2017). The general radiance level (L), the visible–infrared
    radiation balance (B), and the radiance variation vector between bands (V) were
    the three characteristics extracted by LBV transformation. L represents high or
    low pixel radiation, B represents relatively high or low radiation in visible-infrared
    bands, and V indicates radiance variance between bands. The bands with maximum
    information and minimum correlation were selected from the Landsat 8 OLI images.
    Among the seven bands (except panchromatic and cirrus bands), bands 3-6 (green,
    red, NIR, and SWIR) were selected using the band index method. The LBV transformation
    determines the L, B, and V bands from the surface reflectance of the four bands.
    The distribution of values in the L band was highly dispersed for the same land
    cover types because of different topography and environment. Therefore, using
    the L band was less reliable for water body extraction, and it was discarded from
    the analysis. From the B and V bands, it was clear that the values in the B band
    were significantly higher than the values in the V band for water pixels. Therefore,
    the simple condition states that if the pixels in the bands were higher than the
    V bands, it was classified as water pixels. The LBV transformation performs better
    than other popularly known water indices NDWI, MNDWI, and AWEI by the performance
    metrics PA, UA, OA, and kappa. The LBV transformation shows promising results
    in extracting water bodies under different water types, topographies, land cover
    types, and light environments. Also, the LBV method can discriminate shallow water
    and shadow pixels in RS images. The LBV transformation segments water and non-water
    pixels from RS images without relying on threshold, prior knowledge, and human
    expertise. However, turbid pixels were not extracted correctly by this method.
    The HSI transformation was used to extract the water bodies from sentinel-2 imagery
    (Bie et al. 2020). The three spectral indices, namely Normalized Difference Built-up
    Index (NDBI), NDVI, and MNDWI, were determined from the input images and used
    NDBI as R, NDVI as G, and MNDWI as B to obtain the False Color Composite (FCC)
    image, named land-veg-water image. Similarly, another FCC image (veg-water image)
    was obtained using Band-8 as R, NDVI as G, and Band-2 as B. The HSI color space
    represents achromatic properties compared to the RGB color space. Hue distinguishes
    feature categories, saturation reflects pixel richness, and intensity eliminates
    shadows. The two FCC (FCC1 and FCC2) images, namely, land-veg-water and veg-water
    images, were transformed into two HSI color spaces (HSI1 and HSI2) using the equation
    outlined in Table 7. The water bodies and building shadows were identified by
    applying a threshold on HSI1. Similarly, the paddy fields and mountain shadows
    were identified by applying a threshold on HSI2. The HSI technique outperforms
    other spectral indices, EWI and MNDWI, by the performance metrics PA, UA, OA,
    and kappa. The HSI transformation clearly identified paddy fields and eliminated
    the shadows. Also, the HSI reduced the misclassification of low-albedo roofs as
    water bodies. The HSI approach misclassified the small amount of building shadows
    as water bodies. The major drawback was threshold determination when it was applied
    to other regions. The SWM using transformation techniques are outlined in Table
    7. Table 7 SWM using Transformation Techniques Full size table SWM using Particle
    Swarm Optimization The new method called spectrum matching based on discrete particle
    swarm optimization (SMDPSO) was developed to extract the water bodies from Landsat
    8 OLI images (Jia et al. 2018). It is based on spectral properties like low reflectance
    and monotonicity. The framework of SMDPSO was divided into two phases. First,
    from the input images, the water probability map was determined. The water probability
    (Pw) is the difference between the standard water spectral curve and the spectral
    curves of the targets. It is the product of cosine and distance similarities.
    The higher the Pw indicates a greater probability of water. Then, the water probability
    map was divided into several tiles. The mean μ and standard deviation σ were determined
    using the pixels of each tile. Each tile was classified into different classes
    based on μ/σ values. The μ/σ > 20, 3< μ/σ ≤ 20, μ/σ < 3 and μ ≤ 0.25, and μ/σ
    < 3 and μ ≤ 0.25 was classified into homogeneous water or non-water, heterogeneous
    non-water, small tributaries, land-water interface, respectively. Each tile''s
    pixel is classified as water or non-water by maximizing the objective function
    resolved by DPSO. Finally, all the tiles were combined to form the final prediction
    map. SMDPSO effectively removes shallows and dark vegetation while preserving
    the natural distribution of small ponds, outperforming unsupervised and supervised
    approaches. Due to spectral similarity, SMDPSO is ineffective for aquatic cities,
    constructions, and land-water inundation areas. Additionally, SMDPSO struggles
    to differentiate shadows, ice, snow, and clouds without additional information,
    such as DEM. The SMDPSO outperforms ISODATA, K-Means, ML, NNC, and SVM by the
    performance metrics, OA (98.98%), Kappa (94.59%), CE (7.18%), and OE (0.695%).
    The SMDPSO has high CE (misclassification of infrastructure and mixed pixel as
    water) and OE due to misclassification of arid land as water. The SMDPSO with
    Linear Feature Enhancement (LFE) was used to extract the water bodies, especially
    small rivers and tributaries, from FengYun-3 images (Wei et al. 2020). The water
    probability image was determined from the input image by selecting the standard
    spectrum. Then, the water probability map was divided into 4x4 blocks, and DPSO
    processed each block to extract water bodies. The mean μ and standard deviation
    σ were calculated from the water probability map, and the blocks were roughly
    classified based on μ and σ. The block which satisfies the μ/σ > 20, μ/σ > 0.7,
    μ/σ > 0.3 were classified as the homogenous water or non-water class, mixed non-water,
    small tributaries. The Duda Road Operator (DRO) was introduced to enhance the
    linear features and extraction of small tributaries. The DRO evaluates the image
    pixel by pixel based on four operators in different directions. The maximum values
    determined on 3×3 and 5×5 pixels in different directions produce linear feature
    enhancement results. The SMDPSO outperforms other methods, single-band thresholding,
    spectral index method, DT, supervised and unsupervised classification, and SMDPSO
    by the performance metrics, OA (97.56%), Kappa (0.95), F1-score (96.99%), and
    mIoU (95.17%). The SMDPSO shows promising effects in discriminating vegetation,
    ice, and clouds from water bodies. Also, SMDPSO performs better in extracting
    small puddles, lakes, and tributaries. Surface Water Mapping using Spectral Unmixing
    The common problem in coarse or medium resolution RS images was the mixed pixel.
    Due to the spatial resolution, the single pixel may contain more than single land
    cover types. Example: 1) The edge pixels of the water bodies have two land cover
    types (land and water). 2) The urban RS images commonly include mixed pixels due
    to the spectrally different materials being near together in urban areas. The
    traditional pixel-based methods fail to analyze the spectral reflectance within
    a pixel, resulting in severe misclassification at land-water boundaries and urban
    areas. The spectral mixture analyses (SMA) address these spectral heterogeneity
    issues and provide an accurate segmentation map. The SMA or Spectral unmixing
    decomposes the spectral signature of the single pixel into fractional coverage
    of each class present within a pixel. The linear spectral mixture analysis (LSMA)
    shows a promising technique to extract sub-pixel information. In the LSMA approach,
    every pixel''s spectral reflectance is expressed through a linear combination
    of spectrally pure land cover elements referred to as endmembers. LSMA aims to
    break down a mixed pixel into the spectral profiles of end members and determine
    the proportionate presence of each end member within that pixel. The LSMA equation
    is taken from ((Ling et al. 2020), Eq. (2)) and it is represented by $${\\rho}_j=\\sum\\nolimits_{i=1}^N{f}_i\\times
    {\\rho}_{ij}+{\\varepsilon}_j$$ (6) where ρj represents the pixel reflectance
    of band j, N represents number of end members, ρij and fi represents the reflectance
    and fractional cover of ith endmember, and εj denotes the residual term. LSMA
    models the landscapes using an invariant collection of endmembers with constant
    spectrums for single land cover types, which are inappropriate for urban areas.
    In urban areas, the same material possesses different spectral curves (high within-class
    spectral variability). To address the above drawbacks of LSMA, Multiple Endmember
    Spectral Mixture Analysis (MESMA) was introduced. The MESMA allows the type and
    number of endmembers to vary for each pixel by considering the spectral and spatial
    variability of complex urban environments. The research exploring the spectral
    unmixing techniques for surface water body extraction is discussed below. The
    spectral unmixing (LSMA) technique was used for mapping coastal wetlands using
    LISS-III and Landsat TM images (Shanmugam et al. 2006). This paper compares LSMA
    with hard classification techniques such as MLC and ISODATA. The performance of
    MLC and ISODATA decreased when the number of classes increased. It was identified
    that the misclassification was due to spectral separability and limited instantaneous
    field of view (IFOV). The linear spectral unmixing technique was used to estimate
    the fractional abundance of endmembers within the pixel. The endmembers were selected
    directly from the image or scene instead of the spectral library, which significantly
    suffers from spatial and temporal variability in reflectance properties of land
    cover types. Due to limited spectral bands, three send members were selected using
    minimum noise fraction (MNF) transformation. The spectral endmembers (vegetation,
    soil, and moisture) were selected from scatter plot of MNF B1 and MNF B2. Then,
    linear spectral unmixing was used to determine the fraction maps of endmembers.
    In moisture fraction, moisture (water) has a higher value than vegetation and
    soil. The experimental result shows that the linear spectral unmixing technique
    outperforms other hard classification techniques. The Hierarchical MESMA was developed
    to map urban land cover types using Hyperspectral Mapper (HyMap) data captured
    over Bonn, Germany (Franke et al. 2009). MESMA, combined with the spatial constraints,
    was utilized to map land covers ranging from imperviousness to material discrimination.
    The Endmember Average RMS (EAR), Minimum Average Spectral Angle (MASA), and Count
    Based Endmember Selection (COB) were the techniques used to identify the most
    representative endmembers (high degree of spectral confusion with members outside
    the class) in each complexity level. These methods need knowledge of the spectral
    characteristics of each material to assign each spectrum to a particular class.
    First-level (impervious and pervious classes), second-level (Water, vegetation,
    built-up, and bare soil), third-level (River, lakes/basins, road, roof/building,
    trees, grass, and bare soil), and fourth-level (20 classes) were the four-levels
    considered in this study. After the optimal endmember selection, 2-, 3- or four
    endmember models were developed, and the single/combination of endmember models
    was used to determine the highest endmember fractions for assigning a land cover
    class. The highly accurate models at the lower level were used to constrain higher-level
    model selection, showing promising effects in extracting land cover types in urban
    environments. The combination of MESMA with a hierarchical framework achieved
    accuracies of 97.2%, 97.2%, 81.7%, and 75.9% for hierarchical levels 1 to 4, respectively.
    The NDVI and spectral unmixing (MF) technique (NDVI+MF) was combined to extract
    the isolated wetlands in Cuyahoga County, Ohio (Frohn et al. 2012). The NDVI was
    initially used to mask vegetation and impervious surfaces such as pavements, roads,
    parking lots, and buildings. The CE (i.e., false positives) were significantly
    reduced using NDVI before the spectral unmixing. The MF was the partial unmixing
    technique to determine the fractional proportion of specific/ target endmember
    (water) within a pixel (i.e., mixed pixel). The MF eliminated the determination
    of other endmembers of other land cover types unnecessarily. The knowledge of
    water spectra was enough to unmix the water from the mixed pixels. After spectral
    unmixing, the thresholding was used to segment the wetland areas from other background
    regions. The threshold value was determined from the mean and standard deviation.
    After classification, the isolated wetland map was post-processed to combine adjacent
    pixels based on four neighbors. The NDVI + MF shows better performance in extracting
    isolated wetlands with the performance metrics OA (92.79%), kappa (0.86), PA (87.9%),
    and UA (97.4%). However, the isolated wetlands less than 30m were not identified.
    A Locally Adaptive Unmixing (LAU) approach was developed to extract and monitor
    the lakes in semi-arid and arid regions of China using MODIS data (Ma et al. 2014).
    Since the histogram of the NIR band effectively discriminates the water and land
    pixels, it was used to extract the pure water pixels. The mixed pixels were surrounded
    by pure water pixels with the contributions of two classes or endmembers (water
    and land). After extracting pure water pixels, the morphological dilation operation
    was applied to pure water pixels, and the expanded pixels were identified as mixed
    pixels. The spectral unmixing includes two steps: 1) endmember selection and 2)
    spectral unmixing. The efficiency of unmixing depends on the selection of endmembers.
    The traditional unmixing technique determines endmembers through pixel purity
    assessment, which relies on spatial heterogeneity and spectral reflectance. Variables
    like water impurities and depth influence pure water pixels, while pure land pixels
    are affected by geographic location and terrain. In this method, the endmembers
    for mixed pixels (comprising both water and land) were determined by multiplying
    the reflectance of adjacent pixels using varying weights. The endmember reflectivity
    (water) was determined by multiplying the weights and reflectivity of neighboring
    water pixels in the window. Here 3×3 or 5x5 window was used to determine the endmembers.
    After selecting potential endmembers, linear unmixing was used to determine the
    fraction maps, followed by thresholding to produce water extraction. The LAU method
    outperforms the thresholding method in terms of error analysis. The surface area
    determined with the LAU method was closely correlated with reference data. The
    inundation and surface dynamics of wetlands were mapped using Landsat and LiDAR
    data (Huang et al. 2014). The surface reflectance (SR) data of 2005, 2009, and
    2010 images were normalized to 2007 SR data using dark object normalization. Then,
    the 2007 Landsat image and the corresponding Subpixel Inundation percentage (SIP)
    were modeled using correlation analysis, stepwise linear regression, and regression
    trees. A 1m SIP map obtained from 1m LiDAR data validated the predicted SIP maps.
    Additionally, the surface dynamics of wetlands were monitored by this technique,
    and a correlation between the water extent and drought conditions, and stream
    flow was analyzed. The MESMA with the RF ML technique was integrated for flood
    mapping over Yuyao City, China, using HJ-1B satellite images (Feng et al. 2015).
    The optimal endmember selection was performed after the atmospheric and geometric
    correction and radiometric calibration. A total of 35 optimal endmembers grouped
    into vegetation (10 endmembers), water (12), impervious surface (8), and bare
    soil (5) were determined by CoB, MASA, and EAR techniques. The SMA models were
    obtained by combining the all-possible combination of the endmembers. The shade
    endmember (0s in the bands) was also considered to determine the potential SMA
    models. The two- (35), three - (446), and four-endmember (2640) models were generated
    to account for all possible variations of endmembers. The water fraction maps
    provided by MESMA and other attributes such as reflectance bands, NDWI, DEM, Slope,
    and Aspect were used as feature sets for RF classification. The final flood prediction
    map was obtained by RF classification. The use of MESMA fractions improves classification
    accuracy by 2.5%. The experimental result shows that MESMA with RF outperforms
    MLC and NDWI by the performance metrics OA (94%) and kappa (0.88). The automatic
    subpixel water mapping method (ASWM) was developed for SWM using Landsat 8 OLI
    images for heterogeneous urban conditions (Xie et al. 2016b). First, the NDWI
    water index was obtained from the input image. Then, based on the slopes of the
    histogram''s bimodal distribution, the thresholds for water and land pixels were
    determined. The pixels between these two thresholds were selected as initial mixed
    pixels. The mixed pixel extraction was refined by applying post-processing techniques.
    The pixels that satisfy the conditions (were selected as potential mixed pixels.
    The water fraction map was obtained from the mixed pixels by two steps: 1) end
    member selection using the adjacent spatial information and 2) spectral unmixing
    procedure. The spectrum of the land endmember was computed by adaptively iterating
    the local window to identify the purest land pixel, whereas the spectrum of the
    water endmember was generated by averaging the water pixels in the local window.
    Next, the spectral unmixing technique (LSMA) determined the water fraction map
    based on the fractional abundance of endmembers within the pixel. The total and
    range of endmember abundances were limited to one and 0–1, respectively. The ASWM
    outperforms MNDWI, CEM, fully-constrained least squares (FCLS), and MESMA by the
    performance metrics PA (82.8%), UA (91.8%), Kappa (0.862), and systematic error
    (SE). In real-world scenarios, the technique used for endmember selection and
    linear unmixing affects the final results. The SMA technique was used to determine
    the surface water extent of wetlands and reconstruct the wetland hydrographs (temporal
    changes in surface area) in the semi-arid regions from 1984 to 2011 using Landsat
    data (Halabisky et al. 2016). Wetlands were typically shallow without floating
    vegetation. The four endmembers, such as water, sage steppe, salt, and wetland
    vegetation, were selected and constructed a four-endmember SMA model. The water
    and sage steppe were selected directly from the Landsat images. The spectra of
    water were selected in the deep portion of the river to ensure a reliable/ stable
    spectral signature. Since the salt and wetland vegetation were not apparent in
    every Landsat image, mean spectral signatures were used. The LSMA model was used
    to extract the fraction maps and determine the surface water area. The water fraction
    of each pixel was multiplied by the area of a single pixel (900 m2) to get the
    surface water area of a single pixel. The surface water area predicted from the
    Landsat images was validated with the reference data. The reference data was obtained
    by delineating the water surface in high-resolution aerial images. Additionally,
    the hydrographs of 750 wetlands were reconstructed. This method was tested only
    in semi-arid regions and worked well for small wetlands under 2 pixels (<1800
    m2). The possible sources of misclassification were the average spectral signatures
    for salt and wetland vegetation and the spectral mismatch of spectra in wetlands.
    The low albedo fraction (LAF) representing the High Albedo-Low Albedo-Vegetation
    (H-L-V) method was developed based on linear spectral unmixing for surface water
    body extraction in urban environments (Sun et al. 2017). The H-L-V three-endmember
    model was implemented to analyze the surface reflectance of input images. The
    three endmembers were selected using the combined effect of PCA transformation,
    image-based manual selection, and endmember optimization using cross-validation.
    The triangular topology was observed upon visualization of the scatter plot of
    the first two PCs, and the vertexes indicated the H-L-V endmembers. Next, the
    dark water pixels were selected as low-albedo endmembers in the image and cross-validated
    by a minimal brightness value. Similarly, the grass and pasture pixels were selected
    as vegetation endmembers in the image and cross-validated by maximum NDVI values.
    At last, building roofs, airport runways, and highway intersection pixels were
    selected as high-albedo endmembers. Then, the unconstrained least square approach
    was used to determine the LAF maps. Finally, the binary map was obtained by segmenting
    the LAF map using the optimum threshold (threshold=1). The per-pixel and sub-pixel
    accuracy was measured using kappa and estimation errors. The LAF method outperforms
    MNDWI and AWEI in extracting water bodies, especially in boundary regions. The
    new framework was developed to estimate the subpixel water fraction (SWF) using
    Landsat Imagery (DeVries et al. 2017). The Dynamic surface water extent model
    (DSWE) uses a set of decision rules that rely on fixed thresholds to categorize
    pixels into several classes, including high-confidence water pixels, moderate-confidence
    water pixels, partial water pixels, and non-water. All high-confidence, moderate-confidence,
    and partial water pixels were considered as open water with a SWF value of 1.
    Conversely, land pixels had a SWF of zero. The surface reflectance bands (Blue,
    Green, Red, NIR, SWIR1, and SWIR2) and spectral indices (NDWI, MNDWI, NDVI, Tasseled
    Cap Indices, TCW-TCG difference) were combined and aggregated to 150m spectral
    inputs. Similarly, the SWF was aggregated to 150m SWF. The RF model built with
    100 DTs was trained by these 150m spectral inputs and 150m SWFs. Then, the trained
    RF model was used to predict the 30m SWF by providing 30m spectral inputs. The
    water extent of a single pixel was determined by multiplying SWF with the area
    of a single Landsat pixel (0.09ha) and summed over an image to estimate the total
    water extent. The RMSE and normalized RMSE (nRMSE) were computed to analyze the
    performance. Comparing SWF with reference data, this method provides very low
    nRMSE ranging from 0.11 to 0.19. This approach effectively depicts water bodies,
    massive flooded areas, narrow canals, and canopy-covered water bodies. The subpixel
    surface water extraction (SSWE) method was developed to enhance the extraction
    of surface water bodies by subpixel analysis (Xiong et al. 2018). The preprocessing
    techniques, such as radiometric calibration and atmospheric correction, were applied
    to raw Landsat images. The SSWE extracts surface water bodies in three steps:
    1) The pure water pixels were extracted by the newly derived spectral index, All
    Band Water Index (ABWI). The ABWI computed the normalized difference between visible
    (Coastal, blue, green, and red) and infra-red bands (NIR, SWIr1, and SWIR2) of
    Landsat data. The ABWI outperforms NDWI in extracting pure water pixels by the
    performance metrics kappa (0.957) and Total Error (7.56%). 2) Extracting the mixed
    pixels using morphological dilation operation. 3) The MESMA technique effectively
    extracts various water endmembers and determines the proportions of water fractions
    within mixed water-land pixels. Due to water pixels'' high within-class spectral
    variability, the water endmembers were selected based on local spatial constraints.
    i.e., the nearest pure water pixels connected to mixed pixels were selected as
    endmembers. The SSWE outperforms ASWM and registers high extraction accuracy in
    optically complex aquatic environments. A novel method for reliable and timely
    reservoir water dynamics monitoring using sub-pixel size information from daily
    MODIS images was introduced in (Ling et al. 2020). The MNDWI determined on green
    and SWIR bands of Landsat images were used as reference data. Spectral unmixing
    (LSMA) was used to derive daily water fraction images from original MODIS imagery.
    Then, for each mixed MODIS pixel, linear regression was performed between the
    reservoir water areas and corresponding water fraction maps. The water fraction
    maps with values less than 20% and more than 80% were considered as saturated
    pixels and removed before regression. The water extent was estimated by using
    the regression coefficient of each MODIS pixel. The final water extent was obtained
    by averaging the predicted values. The results were further improved by using
    other spectral unmixing techniques or utilizing more spectral bands of MODIS images
    and ancillary data, such as DEM in the spectral unmixing model. The quality of
    reference maps was improved using better water mapping algorithms and post-processing
    techniques. The full spectral unmixing technique (LSMA) and partial spectral unmixing
    (Matched Filtering (MF)) were analyzed to estimate the inundation extent of small
    ponds in Arid regions (Jarchow et al. 2020). Here, the efficiency of LSMA and
    MF was compared based on accuracy, complexity, and time. LSMA unmixes the spectral
    signature of a mixed pixel into the linear proportion of endmembers with their
    fractional abundance covered within the pixel. In contrast, MF identified the
    target or specified endmember (water in case of water body extraction application)
    and approximately estimated the fractional abundance of the target endmember within
    the pixel. The time required to identify and determine all the significant endmembers
    was high compared to identifying one target endmember. The Spearman rank correlations
    (rs) was the metric used to analyze the efficiency of MF and LSMA. The experiment
    results show that the rs of MF and LSMA were better for ponds with an inundation
    area > 900m2. For the ponds with an inundation area <900m2, both MF and LSMA provide
    satisfactory results. The primary reasons for the misclassifications were the
    spectral mismatch between the endmember selection area (Patagonia Lake) and validation
    area (small stock ponds) due to chlorophyll concentration, shallow waterbodies
    with floating vegetation, suspended solids, and water depth. The partial unmixing
    technique (MF) was used to estimate the inundation of small water bodies using
    Landsat images (Sall et al. 2021). The Landsat images were pre-processed by radiometric
    calibration to convert DN values to TOA reflectance. After that, dark object subtraction
    was performed to remove the effects of atmospheric effects from the reflectance
    of dark objects. Then, spectral unmixing estimates the fractional abundance of
    endmembers present in a pixel. Here, MF was used as a spectral unmixing technique.
    Therefore, selecting the water endmember was enough to produce the fraction maps.
    The water endmember was selected in a nearby large water body (Parker Canyon Lake)
    to capture the best spectral characteristics. The water endmember was directly
    obtained from the image by taking the mean of 53 pure water pixels. After selecting
    the endmember, MF estimates the water abundance of a single pixel ranging from
    negative to ≥ 1. The negative values indicate no water and positive values indicate
    water coverage. A cell covered 100% by water was indicated by values ≥ 1.0. The
    surface water extent was obtained by multiplying the fraction map with the area
    of a single pixel (900 m2). The surface water area was validated by high-resolution
    worldview-2 and NAIP imagery. The 34-year surface water area was also analyzed
    with a three-month standardized precipitation index (SPI01) and different drought
    indices. A novel automated and hierarchical surface water fraction mapping (AHSWFM)
    framework was developed for SWM from sentinel-2 imagery (Wang et al. 2022). First,
    the sentinel-2 multispectral images were downscaled to 10m resolution using the
    principal component analysis pansharpening technique. Then, the NDWI determination
    followed by OTSU segmentation provides the 10m binary surface water map. The hierarchical
    structure of AHSWFM splits the pixels into pure water, pure land, and mixed pixels
    based on statistical values (mean and standard deviation) of binary surface water
    maps. It predicts their water fractions individually to prevent overestimating
    water fractions for pure land pixels and underestimating water fractions for pure
    water pixels. This step segregates the mixed pixels from pure land and water pixels.
    The mixed pixels were addressed by a self-trained model, which does not require
    prior information about the pixel. The self-trained model aggregates the 10m resolution
    multispectral and binary surface water map into coarse resolution multispectral
    image and binary water map. The coarse-resolution vectors of multispectral image
    and binary water map trained the RF model. Then, a self-trained RF model was applied
    to mixed pixels to obtain the mixed pixels'' water fraction maps. The final water
    fraction map was obtained by combining pure land and water pixel fraction maps
    and the water fraction map provided by the RF model. AHSWFM outperforms MF, LSMA,
    and MESMA in estimating surface water bodies. Considering other techniques for
    preparing binary water maps (instead of NDWI+ Otsu segmentation) eliminates the
    problem of built-up noise. Experiment Results and Discussions SWM is a challenging
    task that provides significant hurdles to researchers due to numerous environmental
    factors such as shadows, high/low albedo surfaces, and cloud covers. In addition
    to reviewing the papers on surface water body extraction, this paper provides
    the results of SI, ML, and DL techniques. However, it is complicated to compare
    the results of all the research papers discussed in this paper because of different
    study areas and datasets. But it is possible to compare a few SI, ML, and DL techniques
    to provide a comprehensive idea for the researchers working in this community.
    The qualitative and quantitative analysis of SL, ML, and DL techniques are discussed
    next. Water Body Extraction using Spectral Indices The Landsat 8 OLI data (shown
    in Fig. 2(a)) were cropped to the required dimension covering the Vaigai dam.
    The spectral bands of Landsat 8 OLI data are provided in Table 2. Several spectral
    indices were determined using spectral bands of Landsat images to produce the
    binary water mask. In the binary water mask, the yellow and purple region represents
    the water and non-water areas. The qualitative results of various spectral indices
    methods are shown in Fig. 9. Fig. 9 SWM using spectral indices Full size image
    Visually, the spectral indices such as EWI (Yan et al. 2007), NEW (Xiao and Zhu,
    2010), and I (Mishra and Prasad, 2015) have misclassifications (water bodies are
    misclassified into non-water bodies and vice-versa). Similarly, spectral indices
    such as HRWI (Yao et al. 2015), WI2015 (Fisher et al. 2016), WNDWI (Guo et al.
    2017), WI2018 (Raheem, 2018), PI (Jain et al. 2020), ANDWI (Rad et al. 2021),
    and IWI (Tang et al. 2022) perform better in water body extraction. Figure 10
    depicts the quantitative analysis of the spectral indices. Fig. 10 Quantitative
    analysis of spectral indices Full size image From Fig. 10, it is clear that WI2018
    (Raheem, 2018) outperforms other spectral indices by the performance metrics OA
    (0.998), F1-Score (0.984), and Kappa (0.984). Similarly, the I (Mishra and Prasad,
    2015) spectral index shows the least performance among other spectral indices.
    Water Body Extraction using ML Techniques The ML models are trained using the
    features extracted from the input multispectral images and their ground truth
    labels. During testing, the same features were extracted and given to the trained
    ML model for pixel classification. The spatial, spectral, and textural features
    can be extracted from the input multispectral images. The results of (Rajendiran
    and Kumar, 2022) and (Nagaraj et al. 2023) are discussed in this paper. In (Rajendiran
    and Kumar, 2022), the spectral and textural features are extracted from the LISS-III
    images and trained ML classifiers for pixel classification. Similarly, (Nagaraj
    et al. 2023) used Landsat images instead of LISS-III images. The type and number
    of features extracted from these two input RS images (LISS-III and Landsat 7 ETM+)
    vary due to the change in spectral resolution. i.e., the features extracted from
    the Landsat multispectral image cannot be extracted in LISS-III due to the limitation
    of the number of spectral bands. The number and type of features used for training
    the model control the pixel classification accuracy. The qualitative and quantitative
    analysis of (Rajendiran and Kumar, 2022) and (Nagaraj et al. 2023) are explained
    next. Figures. 11 and 12 depicts the qualitative analysis of ML techniques (Rajendiran
    and Kumar, 2022) and (Nagaraj et al. 2023). Fig. 11 SWM of Stanely reservoir using
    ML techniques (Rajendiran and Kumar, 2022) Full size image Fig. 12 SWM of Lake
    Victoria using ML techniques (Nagaraj et al. 2023) Full size image Figure 11(a)
    and (b) show the FCC and ground truth images of the Stanely reservoir. Figure
    11 (c-g) shows the KNN, DT, RF, SVM, and XGB predictions. Similarly, Fig. 12(a)
    and (b) show Lake Victoria''s multispectral and ground truth images. Figure 12(c-h)
    shows the GNB, DT, RF, XGB, LightGBM, and CatBoost predictions. While comparing
    the water predictions with the ground truth, there are misclassifications along
    the edges and around the water bodies. The details about the dataset, feature
    extraction, and ML techniques were provided in (Rajendiran and Kumar, 2022) and
    (Nagaraj et al. 2023). The quantitative analysis of ML techniques (Rajendiran
    and Kumar, 2022) and (Nagaraj et al. 2023) is provided in Fig. 13. Fig. 13 Quantitative
    analysis of ML techniques for SWM; (a) Quantitative results of (Rajendiran and
    Kumar, 2022); (b) Quantitative results of (Nagaraj et al. 2023) Full size image
    From Figs. 11 and 13(a), it is clear that the XGB outperforms other ML techniques
    for SWM. The PLF+XGB has Accuracy, Precision, Recall, and mIoU of 0.995, 0.977,
    0.990, and 0.969, respectively. The PLF+XGB shows an improvement of 1.53%, 14.26%,
    1.33%, and 15.77% in Accuracy, Precision, Recall, and mIoU, respectively, compared
    to KNN. Figures. 12 and 13(b) clearly show that the LightGBM outperforms other
    ML techniques. The PLF+LightGBM has an improvement of 5.17%, 4.81%, 6.36%, and
    10.85% in Accuracy, Precision, Recall, and mIoU, respectively, compared to DT.
    Water Body Extraction using DL Techniques The DL techniques use DNNs to extract
    the water bodies from RS images. The DNNs are trained end-to-end with the input
    multispectral/hyperspectral images and their corresponding ground truth images.
    The trained DNN accepts the input image during testing and produces an output
    binary water mask. The results of DNNs, namely FCN8 (Shelhamer et al. 2017), Unet
    (Ronneberger et al. 2015), PSPNet (Zhao et al. 2017), SegNet (Badrinarayanan et
    al. 2017), Deepwater map (Isikdogan et al. 2017), MSCNN (Wang et al. 2020a), SR-SegNet
    (Weng et al. 2020), MWEN (Guo et al. 2020b), MSLWENet (Wang et al. 2020b), and
    Improved PSPNet (Yin et al. 2023) are discussed in this paper. These DNNs are
    trained using the LISS-III multispectral images (Nagaraj and Kumar, 2022) for
    mapping large-scale water bodies. The qualitative and quantitative analyses of
    these DNNs are explained next. Figure 14 depicts the qualitative analysis of DNNs
    for water body extraction. Fig. 14 SWM using DNNs (Nagaraj and Kumar, 2022) Full
    size image Comparing the water predictions of DNNs (Fig. 14(c-l)) with ground
    truth (Fig. 14(b)) reveals severe misclassification along and around the water
    bodies. In terms of visual perception, the Unet and MSCNN predictions are better
    than other DNNs. Similarly, the SR-SegNet and FCN predictions record the lowest
    performance among other DNNs. Figure 15 depicts the quantitative analysis of DNNs
    for SWM. Fig. 15 Quantitative analysis of DNNs for SWM Full size image Figure
    15 shows that Unet performs better in all the performance measures followed by
    Deepwater map, MSCNN, and MWEN. Then, SR-SegNet provides the lowest performance
    among the DNNs. The Unet has accuracy, precision, recall, specificity, F1-Score,
    Kappa, FPR, FNR, MCC, and mIoU of 0.990, 0.981, 0.961, 0.990, 0.990, 0.963, 0.009,
    0.040, 0.963, and 0.942, respectively. The Unet shows an improvement of 3.23%,
    5.71%, 24.32%, 0.71%, 19.27%, 19.77%, 47.05%, 82.30%, 18.15%, and 26.27% in terms
    of accuracy, precision, recall, specificity, F1-Score, Kappa, FPR, FNR, MCC, and
    mIoU, respectively compared to SR-SegNet. By analyzing the water body extraction
    using SI, ML, and DL techniques, it is concluded that the DL techniques perform
    better than SI and ML methods in terms of performance measures. Summary and Challenges
    SWM is vital in comprehending and overseeing the planet''s water resources, environmental
    surveillance, and upholding diverse socio-economic undertakings. Given the limitations
    posed by conventional on-site measurements for mapping water resources, RS imagery
    has been employed for SWM. Several techniques were explored by the researchers
    for water body extraction. This paper extensively analyzed the SWM using four
    major techniques: single band thresholding, spectral indices, ML, DL, and spectral
    unmixing. Applying a threshold to a single band in the RS image is a direct approach
    for extracting water bodies. However, it has several limitations due to mixed
    pixels, variability in water characteristics, environmental conditions, the influence
    of confused objects (dark vegetation, shadows, low-albedo materials, and surfaces),
    and lack of contextual information. Spectral indices (Tucker, 1979; Crist and
    Cicone, 1984; Crist, 1985; McFeeters, 1996; Wilson and Sader, 2002; Al-Khudhairy

    with water utilize mathematical calculations on the spectral bands present in
    the input image to accentuate water-related characteristics. Subsequently, an
    appropriate thresholding method is utilized to generate a binary water mask. Spectral
    indices enhance the accuracy of mapping surface water by using multiple bands
    to amplify water-related attributes more effectively than single-band thresholding
    (Mondejar and Tongco, 2019). However, they also encounter challenges in identifying
    water pixels located near boundaries and in the presence of interference like
    shadows and low-reflectance materials. Additionally, establishing a suitable threshold
    is complicated due to the variability in spectral characteristics across diverse
    spatial areas. The results of existing spectral indices (qualitative and quantitative
    analysis) are explained in section \"Water Body Extraction using Spectral Indices\".
    The experimental results show that the HRWI (Yao et al. 2015), WI2015 (Fisher
    et al. 2016), WNDWI (Guo et al. 2017), WI2018 (Raheem, 2018), PI (Jain et al.
    2020), ANDWI (Rad et al. 2021), and IWI (Tang et al. 2022) perform better in water
    body extraction. From Fig. 10, the HRWI has a kappa of 0.943, which agrees with
    the HRWI (Yao et al. 2015) (Kappa = 0.95 provided in Table 4). From Fig. 10, the
    WI2015, WNDWI, and IWI have the OA of 99.8%, 99.7%, and 99.7%, respectively. From
    Fig. 10, the PI has F1-Score and Kappa of 0.968 and 0.967, respectively, which
    agrees with the PI (Jain et al. 2020) (F1-Score=0.96 and Kappa=0.92 provided in
    Table 4). The ANDWI provides OA, F1-Score, and Kappa of 0.998, 0.976, and 0.975,
    respectively, it is in good agreement with the ANDWI (Rad et al. 2021) (OA, F1-Score,
    and Kappa of 0.98, 0.98, and 0.96, respectively provided in Table 4). From Fig.
    10, the WI2018 has an OA, F1-Score, and kappa of 0.998, 0.984, and 0.984, better
    than all the spectral indices. The WI2018 shows an improvement of 0.41%, 7.07%,
    and 7.42% in OA, F1-Score, and Kappa, respectively, compared to I (Mishra and
    Prasad, 2015). SWM using ML techniques was broadly classified into supervised
    and unsupervised ML approaches. The unsupervised ML entails grouping the pixels
    based on spectral reflectance to represent water and various land cover categories.
    The supervised ML techniques (Li and Narayanan, 2003; Baker et al. 2006; Fu et
    al. 2008; Sivanpillai and Miller, 2010; Otukei and Blaschke, 2010; Lian and Jianfei,
    2011; Sun et al. 2014; Huang et al. 2015; Acharya et al. 2016; Wang et al. 2018c;
    Sui et al. 2018; Zhang et al. 2018; Bangira et al. 2019; Gašparović et al. 2019;
    Acharya et al. 2019; Wangchuk and Bolch, 2020; Liu et al. 2020; Ghasemigoudarzi
    et al. 2020; Nagaraj and Kumar, 2021; Gašparović and Singh, 2022; Rajendiran and
    Kumar, 2022; Nagaraj and Kumar, 2022; Nagaraj et al. 2023; Nagaraj and Kumar,
    2023a) train the model using features and ground truth labels. The spectral, textural,
    and morphological features are manually extracted from the input RS images. Supervised
    ML offers a better understanding of features, demands less training data and time,
    involves less hyperparameter adjustment, and reduces resource requirements. However,
    manually extracting features from the input RS image is arduous, and utilizing
    optimal features produces better accuracy in water mapping. In response to this
    challenge, some researchers utilized CNN for feature extraction and ML for pixel
    classification, leading to a notable enhancement in the accuracy of SWM. Some
    post-processing techniques were adopted to refine the predictions. Some researchers
    employed unsupervised ML algorithms for water mapping and supervised ML techniques
    to validate and enhance the results. The results of existing ML techniques for
    SWM (qualitative and quantitative analysis) are explained in section \"Water Body
    Extraction using ML Techniques\". In (Rajendiran and Kumar, 2022), the PLF+XGB
    outperforms other ML techniques and shows an improvement of 1.53%, 14.26%, 1.33%,
    and 15.77% in Accuracy, Precision, Recall, and mIoU, respectively, compared to
    KNN. Similarly, in (Nagaraj et al. 2023), the PLF+LightGBM outperforms other ML
    techniques and shows an improvement of 5.17%, 4.81%, 6.36%, and 10.85% in Accuracy,
    Precision, Recall, and mIoU, respectively, compared to DT. The DL techniques have
    demonstrated superiority over traditional ML approaches in SWM because they automatically
    learn intricate patterns and features from data. The DL is an end-to-end model
    that outperforms ML in the following aspects: hierarchical feature learning and
    the ability to extract contextual and non-linear relationships. Several variants
    of DL techniques were explored to enhance the accuracy of water body extraction.
    The FCN architecture with proper encoder and abrupt upsampling eliminates small
    water bodies and provides a patchy appearance at water boundaries. The encoder-decoder
    architectures with skip connection (Unet (Ronneberger et al. 2015), SegNet (Badrinarayanan
    et al. 2017), Deepwater map (Isikdogan et al. 2017), MSCNN (Wang et al. 2020a),
    SR-SegNet (Weng et al. 2020), MWEN (Guo et al. 2020b), MSLWENet (Wang et al. 2020b))
    improves the accuracy by accurately identifying small water bodies and water boundaries.
    Transferring features using skip connections provides better localization. Several
    improvements are introduced to mitigate the several issues in DL models. The residual
    and modified residual blocks (SR-SegNet (Weng et al. 2020), DLFC Net (Li et al.
    2021), MSResNet (Dang and Li, 2021), MIE-Net (Zhong et al. 2022), MRSE-Net (Zhang
    et al. 2022), and MSAFNet (Lyu et al. 2023)) were introduced to mitigate the issue
    of vanishing and exploding gradient. To address the computational complexity,
    depthwise separable convolutions (SR-SegNet (Weng et al. 2020)) were introduced
    to reduce the number of trainable parameters. The dilated convolutions (MWEN (Guo
    et al. 2020b), MSLWENet (Wang et al. 2020b)) were introduced to capture global
    and local features by increasing the receptive field without increasing computation
    complexity. The attention blocks (CBAM, scSE) were introduced in MSR-Net (Duan
    and Hu, 2019), SA-CapsFPN (Yu et al. 2021), MIE-Net (Zhong et al. 2022), MRSE-Net
    (Zhang et al. 2022), MAGC-Net (Pang and Gao, 2022), PSAGNet (Fang et al. 2022),
    Improved PSPNet (Yin et al. 2023), customized U-net (Kadhim and Premaratne, 2023),
    and MSAFNet (Lyu et al. 2023) provide importance to water features and ignores
    other landcover types. The ASPP module is introduced in PSPNet (Zhao et al. 2017),
    MC-WBDN (Yuan et al. 2021), MSResNet (Dang and Li, 2021), and Improved PSPNet
    (Yin et al. 2023) to capture multi-scale contextual information by adopting different
    pooling kernels. The post-processing module is introduced in (Fu et al. 2017),
    (Feng et al. 2018), (Li et al. 2019b), and (Lu et al. 2022) to refine the details
    of the coarse segmentation map provided by the DNNs. The results of existing DNNs
    (FCN8, Unet, PSPNet, SegNet, Deepwater map, MSCNN, SR-SegNet, MWEN, MSLWENet,
    and Improved PSPNet) for SWM (qualitative and quantitative analysis) are explained
    in section \"Water Body Extraction using DL Techniques\". The experiment results
    show that the Unet outperforms other DNNs for water body extraction. The Unet
    shows an improvement of 3.23%, 5.71%, 24.32%, 0.71%, 19.27%, 19.77%, 47.05%, 82.30%,
    18.15%, and 26.27% in terms of accuracy, precision, recall, specificity, F1-Score,
    Kappa, FPR, FNR, MCC, and mIoU, respectively compared to SR-SegNet. DL techniques
    provide higher accuracy than traditional ML and SI methods but require substantial
    labeled training data and significant computational resources. However, DL methods
    also face issues in extracting shadows and mixed pixels. This issue can be addressed
    using spectral unmixing. The spectral unmixing determines the abundance of endmember
    spectral signatures in a pixel (fraction map). Then, a suitable thresholding technique
    is applied to the fraction map to create the final binary water mask. Additionally,
    the water body extraction using RS images posed several challenges to the researchers.
    Some of them are listed below. Lack of labeled dataset: DL techniques require
    vast data for training to provide good accuracy. Obtaining data has become easier
    due to the increased availability of RS satellites. However, these data come without
    a reference or ground truth. The DL model trained with the ‘X’ location may not
    provide good results on the ‘Y’ location. Even though a plethora of data is available,
    it is unusable due to a lack of ground truth data. Hence, it necessitates data
    with ground truth on a regional basis to develop a better SWM model. Lack of freely
    available high-resolution images: The medium resolution sensor images like Landsat,
    Sentinel-2, and LISS-III are available publicly. The high-resolution images came
    with financial constraints, where the individual researchers could not afford
    to buy these datasets due to limited budgets. Extraction of smaller water regions:
    Numerous DL models were developed to map large-scale water bodies. However, accurately
    delineating small water bodies like ponds and narrow streams has been challenging,
    primarily due to their sizes falling below the pixel resolution of medium-resolution
    sensors. Despite some researchers exploring methods to extract these smaller water
    bodies, their success has been limited in achieving high levels of accuracy. Extraction
    of mixed pixels: Misclassification of mixed pixels in medium and small-scale water
    bodies provides inaccurate water extent estimation. The spectral unmixing technique
    has been explored and provides accurate subpixel mapping. Selecting endmember
    (pure spectral signatures) of land cover types is crucial in spectral unmixing.
    Although, some researchers selected the endmembers from the input RS images. However,
    it is scale-dependent (the mixture of land cover types within a pixel changes
    with scale). In practice, the spectral signature of water can vary across different
    spatial locations. Therefore, it is necessary to have spectral signatures on a
    regional basis for better subpixel SWM. Extraction of urban water bodies: The
    extraction of urban water bodies was challenging due to urban noises such as shadows,
    low-albedo roofs, and surfaces. This can be addressed by spectral unmixing. Integrating
    DL models with spectral unmixing provides better SWM. Addressing cloud obscuration:
    Optical images are hindered by a notable issue—cloud obscuration. Nearly all optical
    images exhibit cloud cover, with only a few being cloud-free. Techniques for cloud
    masking are employed to remove clouds, but this results in the loss of information
    below cloud-covered regions. Since Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) can penetrate
    clouds, fusing SAR data with optical data proves advantageous for SWM. Although
    researchers have explored combining optical and SAR data, challenges persist due
    to the heterogeneous nature of these datasets. Achieving pixel-level fusion of
    SAR and optical data is essential for improved surface mapping. Conclusion and
    Future Scope Spatio-temporal monitoring of surface water dynamics is vital for
    eco-hydrological studies and water resource management. This review focussed on
    four major approaches: Spectral Indices, Machine Learning, Deep Learning, and
    Spectral unmixing for water body extraction. Notably, each approach is extensively
    reviewed with satellite data, study area, methodology, results, hyperparameter,
    advantages, and disadvantages to provide valuable insights for upcoming researchers
    in the field of SWM. Based on the literature and experimental results, it is concluded
    that the use of spectral indices is the straightforward technique for SWM. However,
    it requires an appropriate threshold, and determining it poses a challenge. The
    thresholds of spectral indices methods should be fine-tuned to produce better
    results. The ML techniques require manual feature extraction from the input images,
    directly influencing the model''s performance. However, determining the optimal
    features from the input RS image remains challenging. The DNNs with additional
    key components, including skip connections, dilated convolution, attention mechanisms,
    and residual blocks, provide better segmentation accuracy. The DNNs perform better
    than spectral indices and ML techniques. However, all the methods have the problem
    of extracting mixed pixels. Finally, this review points out the ability of the
    spectral unmixing approach to address mixed pixel misclassification. The experimental
    results from state-of-the-art methods aid researchers in grasping the limitations
    of various approaches and guide them toward future research directions. Based
    on the review, the possible recommendations are outlined for future research.
    They include: SWM in the presence of clouds: The serious issue of optical sensors
    is cloud cover and vegetation obstruction, which make them less effective in accurately
    identifying water bodies beneath clouds and vegetation. Combining optical data
    with SAR data or fusion of features extracted from both datasets is a promising
    approach to enhance SWM. Explainable DL models: The DL models, particularly those
    with complex architectures, often require large datasets for effective training
    and better performance. However, this leads to overfitting. Therefore, it is necessary
    to determine the minimum quantity of data needed for training the DL models. Also,
    the call for interpreting patterns or features learned by DL models is significant.
    Need to address mixed pixel problem: After extracting the pure water and land
    pixels from the RS images by the simple technique, the spectral unmixing technique
    is applied for extracting trust-worthy water pixels from the mixed pixels. However,
    using simple techniques like spectral indices for creating coarse binary water
    maps provides misclassification due to built-up noise, shadows, and dark vegetation.
    Therefore, integrating the lightweight DL model and spectral unmixing as post-processing
    mitigates the challenges posed by the mixed pixels. The effective water body extraction
    by a precise model could be helpful in understanding surface water dynamics and
    effectively maintaining valuable water resources for future generations. Data

  description: 'Study region: The Mississippi Alluvial Plain (MAP) in the United States
    (US). Study focus: Understanding local-scale groundwater use, a critical component
    of the water budget, is necessary for implementing sustainable water management
    practices. The MAP is one of the most productive agricultural regions in the US
    and extracts more than 11 km3/year for irrigation activities. Consequently, groundwater-level
    declines in the MAP region pose a substantial challenge to water sustainability,
    and hence, we need reliable groundwater pumping monitoring solutions to manage
    this resource appropriately. New hydrological insights for the region: We incorporate
    remote sensing datasets and machine learning to improve an existing lookup table-based
    model of groundwater use previously developed by the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS).
    Here, we employ Distributed Random Forests, an ensemble machine learning algorithm
    to predict annual and monthly groundwater use (2014–2020) throughout this region
    at 1-km resolution, using pumping data from existing flowmeters in the Mississippi
    Delta. Our model compares favorably with the existing USGS model, with higher
    R2 (0.51 compared to 0.42 in the previous model), and lower root mean square error
    (RMSE) and mean absolute error (MAE)— 0.14 m and 0.09 m, respectively in our model,
    compared to 0.15 m and 0.1 m in the previous model. Therefore, this work advances
    our ability to predict groundwater use in regions with scarce or limited in-situ
    groundwater withdrawal data availability.'

    The Mississippi Alluvial Plain (MAP) in the United States (US). Study focus Understanding
    local-scale groundwater use, a critical component of the water budget, is necessary
    for implementing sustainable water management practices. The MAP is one of the
    most productive agricultural regions in the US and extracts more than 11 km3/year
    for irrigation activities. Consequently, groundwater-level declines in the MAP
    region pose a substantial challenge to water sustainability, and hence, we need
    reliable groundwater pumping monitoring solutions to manage this resource appropriately.
    New hydrological insights for the region We incorporate remote sensing datasets
    and machine learning to improve an existing lookup table-based model of groundwater
    use previously developed by the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS). Here, we employ
    Distributed Random Forests, an ensemble machine learning algorithm to predict
    annual and monthly groundwater use (2014–2020) throughout this region at 1-km
    resolution, using pumping data from existing flowmeters in the Mississippi Delta.
    Our model compares favorably with the existing USGS model, with higher R2 (0.51
    compared to 0.42 in the previous model), and lower root mean square error (RMSE)
    and mean absolute error (MAE)— 0.14 m and 0.09 m, respectively in our model, compared
    to 0.15 m and 0.1 m in the previous model. Therefore, this work advances our ability
    to predict groundwater use in regions with scarce or limited in-situ groundwater
    withdrawal data availability. Graphical Abstract Download : Download high-res

    1. Introduction Groundwater resources supply nearly half of the global drinking
    water and are a critical component of the water-food-energy nexus (Margat and
    van der Gun, 2013, Schneider et al., 2011, Smajgl et al., 2016). Due to population
    growth, dietary shifts, and climate change, the pressing demands for freshwater
    resources severely stress the groundwater reserves, which contribute to more than
    20% of global irrigation water (Wada et al., 2012). As a result, there has been
    a sharp increase in the negative impacts of groundwater overuse across the world,
    which include land subsidence (Galloway and Burbey, 2011, Hasan et al., 2023,
    Herrera-García et al., 2021, Naghibi et al., 2022, Smith and Li, 2021, Smith and
    Majumdar, 2020, Smith, 2023), aquifer depletion (Butler et al., 2018, Cao et al.,
    2013, Faunt et al., 2016, Rodell et al., 2009, Scanlon et al., 2012, Shekhar et
    al., 2020, Smith et al., 2017, Tiwari et al., 2009), and water contamination (Costall
    et al., 2020, Erban et al., 2013, Goebel et al., 2017, Gottschalk et al., 2020,
    Knierim et al., 2022, Levy et al., 2021, Smith et al., 2018). Thus, reliably quantifying
    the water budget is essential for implementing sustainable water management practices.
    However, groundwater withdrawals, a key component of any water budget, are not
    actively monitored in most places, including the United States (US), at scales
    suitable for such efforts (Foster et al., 2020). Therefore, robust and reliable
    approaches are needed to quantify groundwater use (Majumdar et al., 2020, Majumdar
    et al., 2022). The increased accessibility of remote sensing datasets and gridded
    hydrometeorological data has facilitated new possibilities for monitoring large-scale
    regions in various hydrologic applications (Ndehedehe, 2022). However, a substantial
    challenge arises from the differing spatial and temporal resolutions of these
    remote sensing products when integrating them for estimating water balance components
    (Tamayo-Mas et al., 2018). The direct estimation of groundwater use through a
    water balance approach necessitates knowledge of several critical variables, including
    surface water withdrawals, groundwater recharge, and inflow/outflow, which can
    often be intricate and, at times, unattainable. Moreover, traditional approaches
    that rely on physical models tend to become overly complex and computationally
    demanding, particularly when applied to large regions and when integrating various
    remote sensing products (Ahamed et al., 2022, Becker et al., 2019, Brookfield
    et al., 2023, Faunt, 2009). Numerous studies have explored the individual application
    of these remote sensing products to estimate groundwater storage fluxes. For instance,
    various investigations have used the Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE)-derived
    total water storage changes, subsequently estimating groundwater fluxes by subtracting
    contributions from snow water, surface water, and soil moisture (Famiglietti et
    al., 2011, Nie et al., 2018, Rodell, 2004, Rodell et al., 2007, Rodell et al.,
    2009). However, the utility of GRACE and its successor, GRACE Follow-On (GRACE-FO),
    is typically more suited for basin- or continental-scale assessments, because
    their coarse spatial resolution (∼400 km) poses limitations when applied to local-scale
    groundwater storage change estimations. Moreover, GRACE and GRACE-FO provide estimates
    of changes in storage rather than withdrawals, the variable of interest in this
    study. Additionally, there is a growing trend in employing remote sensing-derived
    land use datasets to estimate irrigated areas, although historically, these datasets
    were not directly linked to groundwater withdrawals (Brookfield et al., 2023,
    Deines et al., 2017, Deines et al., 2020, Ketchum et al., 2020, Xie et al., 2019,
    Xie et al., 2021). Furthermore, some studies (J. Chen et al., 2017; Khorrami et
    al., 2023; Naghibi et al., 2022; Peng et al., 2022; Reeves et al., 2011; Smith
    et al., 2023; Smith and Knight, 2019; Smith and Li, 2021; Smith and Majumdar,
    2020) have leveraged land subsidence estimates derived from spaceborne Interferometric
    Synthetic Aperture Radar (InSAR) techniques to estimate groundwater storage changes
    at high spatial resolutions (∼100 m). However, this approach is typically applicable
    to specific regions characterized by confined or semi-confined aquifers and highly
    compressible sediments (Hasan et al., 2023, Smith and Majumdar, 2020). It also
    provides estimates of storage change rather than withdrawals. Despite the existence
    of well-established research efforts in these domains, the combined utilization
    of these datasets to estimate groundwater fluxes remains relatively uncommon (Hasan
    et al., 2023, Majumdar et al., 2020, Majumdar et al., 2022, Smith and Majumdar,
    2020). Existing methods to estimate groundwater use typically include surveying
    and collating annual water use at the county scale (Dieter, Maupin et al., 2018),
    process-based models (ADWR, 2018, Ahamed et al., 2022, Brookfield et al., 2023,
    Cao et al., 2013, Dogrul et al., 2016, Dogrul et al., 2016, Faunt, 2009), and
    the recently developed data-driven approaches using machine learning (Majumdar
    et al., 2020, Majumdar et al., 2021, Majumdar et al., 2022). County-wide estimates
    provide a conterminous US (CONUS)-scale survey of water use but are not available
    at finer spatial or temporal resolutions. Processed-based models have been reasonably
    successful but are typically unable to make use of the multitude of remote sensing
    datasets available that may act as proxies for groundwater use. Another approach
    is to use lookup tables based on remote-sensing derived land use, modeled precipitation,
    and in-situ pumping datasets (Wilson, 2021). However, this approach does not account
    for the complex interactions between climate, land use, and soil type. Machine
    learning-based solutions are able to ingest a variety of diverse datasets, including
    remote sensing and model-derived datasets; they also can account for complex relationships
    between input datasets and have been shown to provide reliable estimates (Lamb
    et al., 2021, Majumdar et al., 2020, Majumdar et al., 2022, Wei et al., 2022).
    For data-driven or machine learning-based approaches, we need both high data quality
    and quantity (Majumdar et al., 2020, Majumdar et al., 2021, Majumdar et al., 2022).
    In previous studies that estimated withdrawals using a data-driven approach, groundwater
    withdrawals were measured over large spatial scales, enabling validation of withdrawal
    volumes over large regions. This resulted in gridded annual estimates of groundwater
    withdrawals over Kansas (Majumdar et al., 2020) and Arizona (Majumdar et al.,
    2022) at 5-km and 2-km spatial resolutions, respectively. However, most aquifers
    are not monitored this comprehensively but rather have some small fraction of
    wells monitored for withdrawals. Additionally, these regions have such limited
    monitoring of groundwater use that there is no validation of their water use estimates.
    When validation is performed, metrics are low relative to other groundwater model
    performance metrics (Wilson, 2021). As a result, making spatially continuous predictions
    in regions with sparse in-situ pumping measurements is challenging, requiring
    a thorough evaluation of model performance using cross-validation (Hastie et al.,
    2001). Moreover, for regions with sparse datasets, which is a typical scenario
    in the groundwater domain, we cannot validate the total groundwater use for each
    pixel as in Majumdar et al., 2020, Majumdar et al., 2021, Majumdar et al., 2022;
    instead, we must estimate and validate the model results at the point (flowmeter)
    or field scale. In this study, we incorporate remote sensing datasets and machine
    learning to improve an existing lookup table-based groundwater-use model previously
    developed by the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) (Wilson, 2021). More specifically,
    our integrated approach combining remote sensing and machine learning is aimed
    at producing improved estimates of annual and monthly groundwater use at 1-km
    spatial resolution. By leveraging machine learning, we can automatically relate
    water balance components (e.g., precipitation, evapotranspiration, soil moisture,
    and others) and in-situ groundwater use data, which was not possible before in
    the Mississippi Alluvial Plain (MAP). This is the first study to develop a groundwater
    use estimation model at the field scale by linking the point of use (flowmeter)
    to the application area (individual fields), which is then used to produce spatially
    continuous (1-km) groundwater use predictions from 2014–2020. Ultimately, this
    machine learning-based water-use model is one part of an ongoing USGS effort to
    build a hydrologic decision-support system specific to the MAP region. Thus, our
    approach addresses a critical gap in the hydrologic modeling of this region by
    introducing a robust machine learning-based method for groundwater use estimation.
    Our goal is to include datasets that potentially relate to groundwater use, such
    as remotely sensed evapotranspiration, model-based precipitation estimates, and
    air temperature. Machine learning provides a more robust method to predict groundwater
    use than traditional process-based models because these algorithms can handle
    the complex and often non-linear relationships between explanatory and response
    variables. Although the overall approach to predicting groundwater use is similar
    to our efforts in Kansas (Majumdar et al., 2020) and Arizona (Majumdar et al.,
    2022), modeling groundwater use in the MAP region is more complex because of limited
    metered data availability. Hence, we incorporated additional steps to pre-process
    the datasets, e.g., linking the flowmeters to the fields using K-Dimensional trees
    (Bentley, 1975, Rosenberg, 1985). We also used more predictors compared to the
    Kansas and Arizona studies because of the lack of training data and to better
    explain the scatter in the model predictions. Here, we employ Distributed Random
    Forests (DRF) (Breiman, 2001, Breiman et al., 1984, Ke et al., 2017), a distributed
    ensemble machine learning algorithm to predict annual groundwater use (2014–2020)
    across the Mississippi embayment (MISE), a large area overlapping the MAP region,
    using the following datasets as predictors: field centroids (latitude, longitude),
    SSEBop (Operational Simplified Surface Energy Balance) evapotranspiration (Senay
    et al., 2013), precipitation and air temperature from PRISM (Parameter-elevation
    Regressions on Elevation Slopes Model) (Daly et al., 2008), crop type from the
    USDA-NASS CDL (US Department of Agriculture- National Agricultural Statistics
    Service Cropland Data Layer) (Boryan et al., 2011), surface runoff and soil moisture
    change from TerraClimate (Abatzoglou et al., 2018), and Soil-Water Balance (SWB)
    hydrologic soil group (HSG) and irrigation (Westenbroek et al., 2018, Westenbroek
    et al., 2021). We rely on the annual groundwater use data provided by the Mississippi
    Department of Environmental Quality (MDEQ) (Wilson, 2021) to train and validate
    our model. The MDEQ collects these crop-specific data through the Delta Voluntary
    Metering Program (DVMP) and performs quality assurance and quality control (QA/QC)
    checks. Crop-specific weights derived from the USGS real-time flowmeter data are
    used to disaggregate these annual-scale predictions to monthly timesteps. We name
    our proposed method as the Aquaculture and Irrigation Water Use Model (AIWUM)
    2.0 in continuation with the previous iteration of this model called AIWUM 1.0,
    which is based on lookup tables developed by Wilson (2021). The remainder of this
    paper is divided into four sections, starting with the study area characteristics,
    data set descriptions, and workflow details (Section 2). Thereafter, we provide
    results and analysis (Section 3) and, finally, conclude with a discussion of our
    observations and their broader implications (4 Results and analysis, 5 Discussion).
    2. Study area, data, and methods 2.1. Study area The Mississippi Alluvial Plain
    (Fig. 1) is one of the most productive agricultural regions in the US (Wilson,
    2021). The USGS''s Groundwater Resources Program funded a comprehensive evaluation
    of groundwater availability in the MISE region by supporting the Mississippi Embayment
    Regional Aquifer Study (MERAS), in order to provide stakeholders with the necessary
    information to address groundwater availability concerns (Clark et al., 2011).
    Covering more than 200,000 km2, the MISE region spans across eight states and
    comprises ten primary hydrogeologic units. There are two primary regional aquifer
    systems within MISE (Fig. 1), which include the surficial aquifer system dominated
    by the Quaternary Mississippi River Valley alluvial aquifer (MRVA), and the MISE
    aquifer system that consists of deeper Tertiary aquifers and confining units (Knierim
    et al., 2020). Download : Download high-res image (388KB) Download : Download
    full-size image Fig. 1. Map of the study area highlighting the Mississippi Delta,
    alluvial plain boundaries, MRVA, and MISE (Painter and Westerman, 2018, Wilson,
    2021). MRVA is composed of alluvial deposits that are mostly Holocene in age,
    where deposits are made up of a range of materials that vary in size, from coarse
    gravel to clay, and they typically become finer in texture towards the surface,
    grading upwards to sand, silt, and clay. The lower part of the alluvial aquifer
    contains mostly coarse sand and gravel, whereas the upper part consists primarily
    of fine-grained sand, silt, and clay (Hosman, 1996, Hosman and Weiss, 1991). The
    middle Claiborne aquifer, which is the second largest contributor to groundwater
    production in the MISE area, primarily consists of thick beds of marine clay of
    the Cook Mountain Formation. These clay layers act as a lower confining unit restricting
    the vertical movement of groundwater between the upper and lower Claiborne aquifers
    within the MISE aquifer system. Hart et al. (2008) provide a detailed discussion
    of the geology and thickness of some of the important aquifers in this region.
    MRVA is the primary source of groundwater for aquaculture and irrigation activities
    (Alhassan et al., 2019, Kebede et al., 2014) in the MISE, with an estimated average
    groundwater pumping of more than 11 km3/year (Maupin and Barber, 2005). Groundwater
    extraction from the MRVA is over nine times greater than that from the middle
    Claiborne aquifer. The combined groundwater extraction from other aquifers accounts
    for only 4% of the total cumulative amount, whereas the middle Claiborne aquifer
    accounts for approximately 9% of the total (Clark et al., 2011). The heavy drivers
    of groundwater use are aquaculture and crops, which include rice, cotton, corn,
    and soybeans (Wilson, 2021). We selected this study area because the reported
    water level declines in the MAP region (Barlow & Clark, 2011) could potentially
    affect the sustainability of agricultural activities. Our research also aims at
    supporting the USGS’s ongoing water management initiative for developing a hydrologic
    decision-support system specific to this region (Wilson, 2021). Moreover, earlier
    studies have estimated groundwater withdrawals over data-rich regions in Kansas
    (Majumdar et al., 2020, Wei et al., 2022) and Arizona (Majumdar et al., 2021,
    Majumdar et al., 2022). Because only about 10% of the irrigation wells in our
    study area have flowmeters to measure the in-situ pumping, this region serves
    as a testbed to analyze the performance of machine learning approaches with limited
    training data. 2.2. Data Predictor variables for the machine-learning model include
    eight datasets representing land use, climate, and soils, effectively integrating
    both anthropogenic and climate drivers of groundwater use. Each of these datasets
    is related to groundwater use in different ways. For example, precipitation is
    the largest component of the water cycle and is typically inversely correlated
    with withdrawals as it reduces the irrigation requirements of crops (Whittemore
    et al., 2016). Similarly, the second largest water balance component, evapotranspiration
    (ET), is a proxy for consumptive groundwater use encompassing all the water in
    the system that cannot be reclaimed or reused, i.e., water consumed by crops and
    water that evaporates (Bos et al., 2009). In a given agricultural area, there
    are certain times of the year when precipitation may surpass ET, resulting in
    either recharge or runoff, with the latter being more probable when the terrain
    has a steep slope and the soil''s permeability is low. When the intensity of precipitation
    exceeds the saturated hydraulic conductivity of the surface soil, there is infiltration
    excess, i.e., the difference between the intensity of rainfall and the saturated
    hydraulic conductivity, leading to surface runoff. Conversely, if the saturated
    hydraulic conductivity exceeds the intensity of precipitation, surface runoff
    will not occur until the groundwater table rises to the surface of the soil. The
    saturated hydraulic conductivity is, in turn, dependent on soil moisture and soil
    type (Fetter, 2001). These components all relate to the soil water balance, which
    controls how much irrigation occurs, and are thus likely to be related to consumptive
    groundwater use. The SSEBop ET data (Senay et al., 2013) are derived by integrating
    model-assimilated weather fields and the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer
    (MODIS) land surface temperature product (Wan, 2008). SSEBop data are available
    over the CONUS from daily to seasonal time scales at 1-km spatial resolution.
    In addition, we incorporated the gridded PRISM precipitation and maximum temperature
    product (800-m spatial resolution) procured by the USGS (Wilson, 2021) from the
    PRISM group (Daly et al., 2008). The PRISM products are available at daily or
    monthly time steps across the CONUS and are computed using weighted spatial regression
    methods incorporating multiple physiographic entities such as topography and location
    (Daly et al., 2008). The monthly TerraClimate surface runoff and soil moisture
    datasets (Abatzoglou et al., 2018) are available globally at ∼4-km spatial resolution
    and are derived from high-resolution climatological normals and other coarser
    time-varying reanalysis products. As for the SWB products (Westenbroek et al.,
    2018, Westenbroek et al., 2021), we use the gridded HSG data soil groups A-D,
    with A having the highest infiltration rate and D having the lowest. We then convert
    these to average infiltration rates (based on Table 1). We also use the SWB irrigation
    data set, which is an estimate of the crop-water demand based on the Food and
    Agriculture Organization (FAO)− 56 (Allen et al., 1998) irrigation parameters
    and a soil-water balance model (maximum allowable depletion and irrigation method)
    (Westenbroek et al., 2021). Table 1. Hydrologic soil groups (HSGs) and their corresponding
    infiltration rates (Hawkins et al., 2008, Westenbroek et al., 2018). Here, we
    assume the average infiltration rates to be the mean of the intervals for B, C,
    and D HSGs. HSG Infiltration Rate (m/hr) Average Infiltration Rate (m/hr) A > 7.62E-3

    6.35E-4 Finally, we obtain the annual groundwater use data (2014–2020) from the
    MDEQ, which performs some quality control of the DVMP data (Wilson, 2021). The
    datasets used as predictors in our AIWUM 2.0 annual model are summarized in Table

    for estimating annual and monthly-scale crop-specific groundwater use. The random
    forest figure is obtained from the IU Digital Science Center (2013). QGIS (QGIS
    Project, 2021) is used for visualization and statistical analyses, and Python
    3.10 (Van Rossum and Drake, 2009) for implementing the entire workflow, respectively
    (Majumdar et al., 2024b). Here, the annual groundwater use is the target or response
    variable. 2.3. Uncertainties in the predictor datasets The remote sensing and
    modeled products used in our research have associated uncertainty. The CDL data
    over Mississippi (USDA-NASS, 2020b) for 2020 has an overall classification accuracy
    of 87.2% with a Kappa score of 0.81. The CDL classification metrics are similar
    for other parts of the MAP region, such as Arkansas (USDA-NASS, 2020a), and consistent
    for the other years (2014–2019). Like CDL, PRISM (Daly et al., 2008) is a widely
    used gridded hydrometeorological product (precipitation and temperature) for the
    CONUS region (Buban et al., 2020; M. Chen et al., 2020; Majumdar et al., 2020;
    Mourtzinis et al., 2017; Prat and Nelson, 2015; Stillman et al., 2016). The PRISM
    estimates tend to exhibit higher errors in mountainous regions (Henn et al., 2018)
    but have been found to be the most reliable hydrometeorological data set for the
    Upper Mississippi River basin, which includes some portions of the MAP region
    (parts of Missouri and Illinois) (M. Chen et al., 2020). Buban et al. (2020) performed
    a CONUS-wide comparison of the PRISM and the US Climate Reference Network (USCRN)
    precipitation datasets across all seasons from 2006–2018. There was a good agreement
    between the USCRN meteorological station data (114 stations across CONUS) and
    the PRISM data, wherein the maximum mean daily differences and the maximum absolute
    daily difference were less than 1 mm and ∼5 mm, respectively. Another study (Mourtzinis
    et al., 2017) showed that the PRISM precipitation estimates lie within 19% RMSE
    of the weather station data during the crop growing season in the US corn belt
    (midwestern US). Thus, the high-resolution (800 m) PRISM product is a good choice
    for incorporating precipitation and temperature predictors in our machine learning-based
    approach. For SSEBop, Chen et al. (2016) found that it performs satisfactorily
    in estimating evapotranspiration with an 0.86 calculated against eddy covariance
    measurements at 42 AmeriFlux tower sites from 2001–2007. Moreover, 0.92 and RMSE
    13 mm/month were observed over agricultural lands. In addition, relative errors
    of less than 20% were observed across multiple AmeriFlux towers. The TerraClimate
    data set (Abatzoglou et al., 2018) uses a one-dimensional Thornthwaite-Mather
    climatic water-balance model (WBM) (Dobrowski et al., 2013, Willmott et al., 1985)
    to simulate monthly water balance components, which include surface runoff and
    soil moisture, among others. To assess the water balance component of their WBM
    model, the authors compared the interannual variability (1958–2015) of the runoff
    estimates to streamflow from 587 pristine river basins available globally as part
    of the Global Runoff Data Centre (GRDC) Climate Sensitive Stations Dataset (BfG,
    2020). The WBM with a global median Pearson’s correlation coefficient of 0.8 was
    able to capture 70% of the interannual runoff variability of the mid-latitude
    basins within the US. In the SWB irrigation simulations, Westenbroek et al. (2021)
    assumed a fixed amount of cropland to be irrigated and observed that the short-term
    irrigation estimates from 2000–2017 were more reliable than the long-term estimates
    (1915–2011). Moreover, the sum of the average simulated irrigation amounts from
    May-September is about 0.36 m which is within the range of the reported crop water
    use. Although there are multiple sources of precipitation (Abatzoglou, 2013, Cannon
    et al., 2017, Thornton et al., 2021), evapotranspiration (Allen et al., 2011,
    Anderson et al., 2007, Fisher et al., 2020, Laipelt et al., 2021, Melton et al.,
    2021), soil moisture (Fang et al., 2022, Lakshmi and Bin, 2023, Reichle et al.,
    2022), and surface runoff (Rodell et al., 2004, Xia et al., 2012) datasets, we
    chose the predictor datasets (Table 2) because of their availability within the
    temporal domain of the model (2014–2020) and their sufficiently high spatial-resolution
    (< ∼4 km). For example, we could not use the downscaled (1 km) surface soil moisture
    product (Fang et al., 2022, Lakshmi and Bin, 2023) and the Landsat-derived field-scale
    (30 m) ET datasets (Laipelt et al., 2021, Melton et al., 2021, Senay et al., 2022)
    because these are available from 2015 and 2016 onward, respectively. As for the
    surface runoff data, the Global Land Data Assimilation System (GLDAS) (Rodell
    et al., 2004) is not suited for this study due to its coarse spatial resolution
    (∼27 km). Therefore, we selected the predictors (Table 2) primarily based on their
    spatial resolution, temporal availability, and relatively low uncertainties. We
    also successfully incorporated some of these predictors in our earlier studies
    (Majumdar et al., 2020, Majumdar et al., 2021, Majumdar et al., 2022, Smith and
    Majumdar, 2020). 3. Methods 3.1. Data acquisition and preprocessing This work
    incorporates an automated data pre-processing and machine learning pipeline using
    open-source programming languages, tools, and libraries. Here, we use Python 3
    (Van Rossum and Drake, 2009) as the primary programming language for implementing
    the workflow, and QGIS (QGIS Project, 2021) is used for visualization. The main
    Python libraries used in our workflow are LightGBM (Ke et al., 2017), Dask (Rocklin,
    2015), NumPy (Harris et al., 2020), SciPy (Virtanen et al., 2020), GDAL/OGR (GDAL/OGR
    contributors, 2021), scikit-learn (Buitinck et al., 2013, Pedregosa et al., 2011),
    Rasterio (Gillies, 2013), GeoPandas (GeoPandas developers, 2021), and Pandas (McKinney,
    2010). The Python API for the Google Earth Engine platform (Gorelick et al., 2017)
    is used to download the TerraClimate datasets. This study uses sparse point-scale
    measurements of annual groundwater pumping data from wells located in the Mississippi
    Delta, an 18,130 km2 intensively agricultural area in northwestern Mississippi,
    to make spatially continuous predictions of groundwater use across the MISE (Fig.
    1). Because these wells are often located outside the fields they water, we matched
    the well coordinates to the field centroids of the permitted boundary polygons
    (Wilson, 2021) using a fast and reliable K-Dimensional tree approach (Bentley,
    1975, Rosenberg, 1985) available through the scikit-learn API (Pedregosa et al.,
    2011). Then pixel values from the SSEBop, PRISM, and TerraClimate datasets are
    selected based on these latitudes and longitudes of the field centroids. We apply
    spatial and temporal statistical operations as outlined in Table 3 to produce
    annual predictor datasets on a common grid and consider the growing season (April-September)
    for performing this pre-processing task. Table 3. Operations performed on the
    predictor variables at each raster cell for each year (2014–2020). Variable Operation

    outlier removal using boxplot analysis Additionally, crop-specific outlier removal
    is performed for the annual groundwater use data using boxplot analysis (Hastie
    et al., 2001), where we remove 419 samples in total (∼4% of the total observations).
    More specifically, the water-use values for each crop (i.e., corn, cotton, rice,
    soybeans, and aquaculture) which lie beyond the upper limit, i.e., Q3 (third quartile)
    + 1.5 * IQR (interquartile range), are removed. Supplementary Figures 1 and 2
    show the boxplots of the original and outlier-removed datasets. A summary of the
    preprocessing operations performed on the individual datasets is shown in Table
    3. 3.2. Machine learning with distributed random forests Random Forests (Breiman,
    2001) is a widely used ensemble machine learning algorithm in the remote sensing
    domain (Belgiu and Drăguţ, 2016). Here, we used Distributed Random Forests or
    DRF available through the Light Gradient Boosting Machine (LightGBM) package (Ke
    et al., 2017), which allows more regularization capabilities and is substantially
    faster than the scikit-learn package (Pedregosa et al., 2011, scikit-learn developers,
    2021). The DRF model included the annual groundwater use as a response variable
    and latitude, longitude, crop type, precipitation, temperature, evapotranspiration,
    surface runoff, soil moisture, infiltration rate, and SWB irrigation as predictor
    variables (Table 2). The term ‘distributed’ refers to the distributed nature of
    the LightGBM framework supporting efficient computations on multiple machines
    (Ke et al., 2017). For model evaluation, we relied on error metrics such as the
    coefficient of determination ( ), root mean square error (RMSE), and mean absolute
    error (MAE) between observed and predicted annual groundwater use. DRF models
    were further explored via feature importances (computed using the total decrease
    in node variance averaged over all the trees) (Breiman et al., 1984, Majumdar
    et al., 2020) and partial dependence plots (Hastie et al., 2001). The model was
    trained with an 80%− 20% split of the outlier-removed data (9378 samples), wherein
    we randomly sampled 80% of data from each year as training (7499 samples) and
    the rest as test data (1879 samples). We compared the boxplots of annual groundwater
    use grouped by crop type (Supplementary Figure 3(a)) and year (Supplementary Figure
    3(b)), respectively, for the training and test data. Because the mean annual groundwater
    use is similar for training and test data, the year-based stratified splitting
    strategy does not have any underlying data distribution issues. A 5-fold cross-validation
    technique with three repeats or iterations for each fold (Hastie et al., 2001,
    Pedregosa et al., 2011) was then applied, which selects 20% of the training data
    as validation, i.e., a total of 15 model runs for a single set of hyperparameters.
    Several hyperparameters available in the LightGBM API (Ke et al., 2017, Microsoft
    Corporation, 2022) were tuned using a grid search strategy, such as the number
    of estimators, maximum tree depth, the maximum number of leaf nodes, bagging fraction
    (proportion of training samples chosen randomly without replacement), feature
    fraction (proportion of features chosen randomly for each iteration or tree),
    the minimum number of samples in each leaf node, and the smoothing and L2 regularization
    factors (Hastie et al., 2001). The model tuning is performed based on the validation
    set (20% of the training data) wherein the objective or loss function is to minimize
    the RMSE. Once the best model with the lowest RMSE based on cross validation is
    obtained, we evaluate it using the unseen test data to check the model’s generalizability
    within the Mississippi Delta. The hyperparameter tuning and cross-validation are
    performed in the Alpine (https://www.colorado.edu/rc/alpine) distributed high-performance
    computing environment using Dask (Rocklin, 2015) to substantially reduce the computation
    time. We also compared the performance of the DRF against different machine learning
    algorithms such as Gradient Boosting Decision Trees (GBDT) (Ke et al., 2017, Natekin
    and Knoll, 2013), RF (Breiman, 2001), Extremely Randomized Trees (ERT) (Geurts
    et al., 2006), Bagging Trees (BT) (Breiman, 1996), k-Nearest Neighbor (KNN) (Hastie
    et al., 2001), Support Vector Regressor (SVR) (Fan et al., 2008), and Multiple
    Linear Regression (MLR) (Hastie et al., 2001). We did not compare other sophisticated
    deep learning approaches (Goodfellow et al., 2016), such as Convolutional Neural
    Networks (CNNs) and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), primarily because of the limited
    in-situ groundwater use data and the reduced model interpretability. Moreover,
    ensemble decision tree models are known to outperform deep learning methods for
    tabular datasets (data organized in rows and columns) such as the one we use in
    this study (Grinsztajn et al., 2022). 3.3. Applying irrigation mask The annual
    Landsat-based Irrigation Dataset (LANID) (Xie et al., 2019, Xie et al., 2021,
    Martin et al., 2023, Brandt et al., 2021) available at 30-m spatial resolution
    (1997–2020) and the permitted field boundaries in the Mississippi Delta (Wilson,
    2021) are used in conjunction as an irrigation mask for the AIWUM 2.0 output rasters.
    In addition, the National Hydrography Dataset (NHD) (Simley, 2008, USGS, 2019)
    is used to correct for some of the misclassified CDL pixels (Wilson, 2021) showing
    aquaculture as open water bodies. The irrigation mask is required because the
    model predictions are not valid outside irrigated lands. This irrigation mask
    is applied in two ways— within the Mississippi Delta, we relied on both the permitted
    field boundary polygons and the NHD, whereas, outside the Delta, we only used
    the NHD. For both methods, the CDL datasets are resampled (mode, Table 2) to 100-m
    pixel resolution, which are then used as reference grids to create the permitted
    field boundary rasters (within the Mississippi Delta) and the NHD raster (throughout
    the entire study area) at the same resolution. Outside the Delta, the NHD raster
    (0: not water, 1: water) is used to correct the annual CDL data, wherein a CDL
    pixel is marked as an open water body only if the NHD pixel value is 1. Otherwise,
    it is considered aquaculture. Within the Delta, a CDL pixel is marked as open
    water body if the NHD pixel value is 1 and the pixel is not within a permitted
    field boundary, otherwise, it is marked as aquaculture. After this correction
    step, we apply the resampled LANID irrigation mask (100-m spatial resolution)
    to obtain the final CDL rasters, which are used by our model along with the other
    predictors (Table 2) for predicting annual water use (Section 3.2). 3.4. Systematic
    bias correction and uncertainty quantification Ensemble-tree machine learning
    regression models such as RF, GBDT, and others usually generate unbiased estimates
    where the sum of the errors (difference between observed and predicted values)
    is close to zero (Hastie et al., 2001). Nonetheless, these models may exhibit
    a different kind of bias where they tend to overestimate smaller values and underestimate
    larger ones, as pointed out by Zhang and Lu (2012). In this research, we investigate
    the need for performing such systematic bias correction. We compute the bias-corrected
    DRF (BCDRF) estimates using the simple linear regression-based point-scale approach,
    also known as regression of observed on estimated values (ROE) (Belitz and Stackelberg,
    2021, Song, 2015). The bias-corrected estimate ( is calculated by regressing the
    actual or observed annual groundwater use from the training data ( ) against the
    DRF-predicted annual groundwater use from the same training data ( , wherein,
    and are the response (dependent) and predictor (independent) variables, respectively.
    The slope ( and intercept ( ) are estimated using (1b), (1c), which are then used
    with Eq. (1a) to compute . For the test data, we use the same coefficients but
    replace with in Eq. (1a) to obtain . (1a) (1b) (1c) in Eq. (1c) represents the
    vector transpose operation. We compare the actual, predicted, and bias-corrected
    annual groundwater use values using empirical cumulative distribution (ECDF) plots
    (Wilke, 2019) and also perform residual analyses for the DRF annual groundwater
    use predictions. Additionally, we compute the coefficient of variation (standard
    deviation of DRF annual groundwater use predictions divided by the mean of these
    predicted values) to quantify the uncertainty in our model results. 3.5. Disaggregating
    annual estimates to monthly timesteps Following Wilson (2021)’s work on AIWUM
    1.0, the annual-scale groundwater-use estimates from AIWUM 2.0 were disaggregated
    into monthly timesteps. Wilson (2021) used monthly flowmeter data from the Yazoo
    Mississippi Delta Joint Water Management District (YMD), which are available from
    2002–2009, to calculate monthly weights (the fraction of total annual pumping
    that occurs in each month) for the five major crop types (corn, cotton, rice,
    soybeans, and aquaculture) found in the Mississippi Delta. We used the same approach,
    but used USGS real-time flowmeter data, a new dataset of 93 wells located in the
    MAP (Majumdar et al., 2024a) with real-time withdrawal monitoring available from
    2018 to 2020, to compute the monthly weights. The real-time network data undergo
    robust quality control measures from the USGS and are thus more suited for our
    study. The real-time water use data were averaged across the growing season (April-September)
    for corn, cotton, rice, and soybeans, whereas, for aquaculture we have year-round
    data availability. These are used to derive the normalized crop-specific weights
    (Fig. 3) which are subsequently multiplied by the annual pumping estimates from
    the DRF model for each crop to obtain the corresponding monthly groundwater use
    estimates (Section 3.3). Download : Download high-res image (240KB) Download :

    to monthly timesteps. These monthly weights are calculated across all the years
    from 2018–2020. 4. Results and analysis 4.1. Model estimates (Annual-Scale) The
    error metrics for the training, validation, and test data are compared in Table
    4. The training and validation metrics are averaged over the five folds, each
    with three repeats. We observe good generalizability of the model within the Mississippi
    Delta as all the RMSE in training, testing, and validation are similar. The error
    metrics are also similar when we change the random seed, implying that the strategies
    of random partitioning and random sampling (during bagging and feature selection)
    do not substantially skew the model results. The scatter plots in Fig. 4(a) and
    (b) also similarly show the model predictions for the training and test data.

    with other machine learning algorithms, as shown in Table 5, and we observe that
    it performs the best in terms of test RMSE, model overfitting, and generalizability.
    The hyperparameter tuning process for all these models is like before. To check
    the statistical significance of the RMSE metric, we ran model comparisons for
    1000 unique training and test splits and found that the p-values obtained from
    the Wilcoxon signed-rank test (non-parametric version of the paired t-test) (McDonald,
    2014) using the RMSE distributions (test data) are significantly smaller than
    our chosen 5% significance level (Supplementary Figure 4). Hence, our model selection
    criterion based on the RMSE metric is a statistically valid choice. Table 5. Comparison
    of multiple machine learning algorithms. The error metrics are rounded to three
    decimal places. Here, DRF and GBDT are distributed algorithms available through

    AIWUM 1.1 (Bristow and Wilson, 2023), which is an update to AIWUM 1.0 (Wilson,
    2021) based on the latest available datasets, and AIWUM 2.0 are shown in Fig.
    5(a) and Fig. 5(b), respectively. Download : Download high-res image (463KB) Download

    AIWUM 1.1 and (b) AIWUM 2.0 with (c) the total predicted groundwater use in each
    case. AIWUM 1.1 is the latest iteration of AIWUM 1.0, which predicts from 2014–2019
    compared to 2014–2017 for the original version (Wilson, 2021). Here, we extend
    the estimates from our machine learning-based approach throughout the entire MAP
    portion of the MISE region. Note that the in-situ pumping data used for model
    training and validation are only available in the Mississippi Delta region. In
    this work, water use is only predicted for aquaculture, rice, corn, cotton, and
    soybeans because these five crops are present in the MDEQ data. For any other
    crop, the AIWUM 2.0 model calculates the average predicted water use of corn,
    cotton, and soybeans to represent that crop type. The total water use predictions
    for AIWUM 2.0 and AIWUM 1.1 are shown in Fig. 5(c). 4.3. Disaggregated monthly-scale
    estimates The monthly average crop-specific water use obtained by disaggregating
    AIWUM 2.0 annual water use estimates using real-time flowmeter weights (Fig. 3)
    are shown in Fig. 6(a)-(e). Unlike the other crops, the majority of groundwater
    usage for aquaculture (or fish culture) occurs in April and May (Fig. 6(e)). Both
    rice (Fig. 6(d)) and aquaculture have high irrigation demands throughout the growing
    season, with cotton (Fig. 6(c)) exhibiting the lowest water use. The standard
    deviation error bars in Fig. 6 indicate the high variability in crop water-use
    estimates for rice and fish culture. Download : Download high-res image (250KB)

    estimates. The error bars are computed based on the monthly crop water use standard
    deviations. 4.4. Model interpretation After evaluating multiple models (Table
    5), we found that the DRF model has the best model performance and is most likely
    to perform the best for future scenarios as more in-situ pumping data become available.
    The top five important predictors based on the DRF feature importance (Supplementary
    Figure 5) are latitude (0.231), precipitation (0.132), longitude (0.11), surface
    runoff (0.107), and maximum air temperature (0.105). We note that feature importance
    metrics are biased towards continuous predictors, and binary predictors representing
    crop types are given low feature importance even though they have high value for
    the model, and model performance is reduced substantially if they are removed.
    For model interpretation, we relied on partial dependence plots (Fig. 7(a)-(n)),
    which enable us to understand model behavior and the expected heuristics. We find
    that groundwater use for irrigation varies substantially with the location (latitude
    and longitude) of the fields (Fig. 7(c)-(d)). Precipitation and temperature are
    critical drivers of irrigation groundwater use (Figs. 7(e) and 7(f)), and we observe
    the contrasting groundwater usage with increasing precipitation and temperature.
    However, unlike Majumdar et al. (2020), we did not observe much variation in groundwater
    use with changes in evapotranspiration (Fig. 7(g)). This could be attributed to
    the coarse resolution (1 km) of the SSEBop product, which exhibits low variability
    (∼66 mm standard deviation for the training data) at the field scale. This low
    variability could also be attributed to the high natural evapotranspiration rates
    of the sub-humid climatic conditions in our study area (Hanson, 1991). Similar
    to SSEBop, groundwater use varies little with respect to infiltration rate and
    SWB irrigation demand (Fig. 7(a) and (b)). We also find similar observations for
    soil moisture change and surface runoff, as shown in Figs. 7(h) and 7(i), which
    could be due to the coarse resolution of the TerraClimate product (∼4 km). In
    addition, groundwater use varies little with respect to the categorical ‘soybeans’
    and ‘corn’ predictors (Fig. 7(n) and (k)), whereas the other crops show a strong
    relationship with groundwater use (Fig. 7(j), (l), (m)). Crops with above-average
    water use (i.e., rice and aquaculture) have positive relationships, where crops
    with below-average water use (cotton) have negative relationships, and crops with
    average water use (corn and soybeans) have near negligible relationships. Download

    Partial dependence plots relating the AIWUM 2.0 predictors to groundwater use.
    However, the inter-feature collinearity might also affect these partial dependence
    plots as the features are not ideally uncorrelated (Altmann et al., 2020, Hastie
    et al., 2001). Despite these challenges, the combined use of the error metrics,
    feature importance, and partial dependence plots enable us to evaluate and interpret
    our model effectively. 5. Discussion A comparison of the error metrics for the
    AIWUM 1.0 and 2.0 models (Table 6) within the Mississippi Delta shows that our
    proposed remote sensing and machine learning-based method substantially outperforms
    the earlier lookup table-based approach. Supplementary Figures 7 (a)-(b) show
    the boxplot distributions of the AIWUM 1.0 and AIWUM 2.0 predictions over Boeuf,
    Cache, Grand Prairie, St Francis, and the Mississippi Delta— known as the generalized
    regions of the MAP (Supplementary Figure 6) as defined by the USGS (Ladd and Travers,
    2019, Painter and Westerman, 2018). We find that the median AIWUM 2.0 groundwater
    use predictions are higher for each region, and outliers are substantially lower
    than the AIWUM 1.0/1.1 predictions. Table 6. Comparison of AIWUM 1.0 and AIWUM
    2.0 (rounded to three decimal places). Model RMSE (m) MAE (m) AIWUM 1.0 0.446
    0.148 0.100 AIWUM 2.0 (test data) 0.512 0.139 0.092 Essentially, our machine learning-based
    approach learns the interrelationships among different predictors and groundwater
    use and provides reasonable estimates considering the sparsity of the in-situ
    annual groundwater use data. With the AIWUM 2.0 approach, we could provide both
    hindcasts and forecasts of groundwater withdrawals by replacing the current predictors
    with simulated future scenarios (Westenbroek et al., 2018, Westenbroek et al.,
    2021), whereas AIWUM 1.0 provides a look-up table based on average precipitation
    rates for each year that are produced after pumping has been reported, and thus
    can only be used for hindcasts. Moreover, as additional in-situ pumping data become
    available, our machine learning model is expected to generalize well (within the
    Mississippi Delta) because of the robust repeated k-fold cross-validation approach
    (Hastie et al., 2001). We also compare the AIWUM 1.1 (Fig. 5(a)) and AIWUM 2.0
    (Fig. 5(b)) rasters with the USGS county-level volumetric groundwater use estimates
    for 2015. The corresponding county-scale percentage difference maps are shown
    in Fig. 8(a) and 8 (b), respectively. Both the Wilcoxon signed-rank test and the
    paired t-test (McDonald, 2014) indicate that the observed relative differences
    in the groundwater use volumes for the AIWUM 1.1 and AIWUM 2.0 when compared with
    the USGS county-level data (Dieter, Linsey et al., 2018) are statistically significant,
    wherein the p-values are 1.16E-15 and 1.89E-08, respectively. Download : Download

    the county level using the county shapefile data from the U.S. Census Bureau (2019).
    MAP generalized regions are from Ladd and Travers (2019). From Supplementary Figure
    8, we find that the highest relative differences in Fig. 8(a)-(b) are typically
    observed in counties with lower groundwater use ratios, i.e., the ratio of total
    fresh groundwater use to the total freshwater use (combines both groundwater and
    surface water use). The large differences can also be attributed to the different
    approaches to map the irrigated areas, e.g., AIWUM 1.1 and AIWUM 2.0 rely on a
    combination of satellite-based irrigated area estimates (LANID), MDEQ-provided
    field permits in the Mississippi Delta, and the NHD dataset for obtaining the
    annual irrigation masks (Section 2.3.3). However, the irrigated areas for the
    USGS county-level data are estimated by integrating multi-source data (State and
    Federal crop reporting programs, irrigation districts, canal companies, USDA-NASS
    CDL, and SSEBop ET data), some of which are manually obtained (Dieter, Maupin
    et al., 2018). Moreover, the USGS county-level data represent the total fresh
    groundwater use across all sectors (irrigation, industry, municipal, recreational,
    livestock, and others), whereas we are only focused on estimating crop-specific
    groundwater use. Considering the 2015 USGS county-scale water use as additional
    validation data, the AIWUM 2.0 county-scale estimates have higher R2 (0.53), lower
    normalized RMSE (NRMSE = 68.65%), and slightly higher normalized MAE (NMAE = 24.4%)
    as compared to the AIWUM 1.1 county-scale estimates (R2 =0.51, NRMSE=69.76%, NMAE=23.95%).
    These metrics are computed across the entire spatial domain of our model consisting
    of 203 counties (some have partial overlaps and hence, are cropped in Fig. 8(a)
    and (b)). Here, the NRMSE and NMAE are obtained after dividing the RMSE and MAE
    by the standard deviation of the USGS county-scale water use. Thus, AIWUM 2.0
    is able to better capture the variance at the county level compared to AIWUM 1.1.
    5.1. Systematic bias correction From Supplementary Figures 9 (a)-(b), we do not
    find any clear trend in the plotted standardized residuals vs DRF-predicted annual
    groundwater use for the training and test data. Moreover, the standardized residual
    histogram plots in Supplementary Figures 9 (c)-(d) show that the mean of these
    residuals is close to zero and the distribution is approximately normal. Hence,
    our DRF model is unbiased, considering the mean residual. However, from the training
    and test data scatter plots in Fig. 4(a)-(b) and the ECDF curves in Supplementary
    Figures 10 (a)-(b), we find that there is some systematic bias which leads to
    overprediction and underprediction of smaller and larger annual groundwater use,
    respectively. This is observed in both the original (DRF) and bias-corrected (BCDRF)
    predictions, though BCDRF shows slight improvements. In this context, we observe
    that the BCDRF annual groundwater use values (bias correction using ROE, Section
    2.3.4) are not considerably different than the DRF ones for the training (Supplementary
    Figure 10 (a)) and test data (Supplementary Figure 10 (b)). The test data error
    metrics for DRF and BCDRF shown in Supplementary Table 1 also support this observation.
    5.2. Spatial generalizability Because the DRF model is trained and validated only
    within the Mississippi Delta, assessing the spatial generalizability outside this
    region is challenging without in-situ annual groundwater use data. Supplementary
    Figures 11–15 show the boxplots of SSEBop evapotranspiration, PRISM precipitation,
    PRISM maximum temperature, TerraClimate surface runoff, and TerraClimate soil
    moisture change, respectively (Table 2). The time series plots over these regions
    indicate substantial fluctuations in the mean of these predictors for each region,
    particularly in the case of maximum temperature and surface runoff. However, for
    each predictor, we find substantial overlaps in the regional distribution, i.e.,
    the boxplot distribution of the predictor variables within the Mississippi Delta
    (when grouped solely based on the regions) is similar to the other MAP regions.
    Therefore, our model should exhibit reasonable spatial generalizability outside
    the Mississippi Delta. 5.3. Model uncertainty We computed the coefficient of variation
    maps for the entire model domain (MISE) and observed that the mean coefficient
    of variation across all the years (2014–2020) ranges from 0.39 to 0.78 (Fig. 9).

    Fig. 9. Mean coefficient of variation map over the entire model domain (MISE)
    at 1 km spatial resolution. Because the coefficient of variation is essentially
    the ratio of the standard deviation of the predicted samples to the mean of these
    samples, it provides us with an uncertainty estimate of our model. We observe
    the spatially averaged median coefficient of variation to be similar for Boeuf,
    Delta, and St. Francis regions (∼0.6), whereas it is slightly lower (∼0.55) over
    Cache and Grand Prairie (Supplementary Figure 16). The similarity of the median
    coefficient of variation suggests similar uncertainty in our model predictions
    throughout these generalized regions. 5.4. Limitations A limiting factor in our
    approach is that we incorporate the categorical crop type variable (Table 2) as
    a predictor implying that if a particular crop is not present in the training
    data, then we cannot extend it to the larger MISE region, which grows a variety
    of crops. As of now, the average predicted water use of corn, cotton, and soybeans
    is used in such cases. Another limitation inherent to random forests is the ability
    to predict beyond the range of training observations (Breiman, 2001). However,
    even with the limited data in the Mississippi Delta, the DRF training and test
    error metrics (Table 5) are similar (e.g., training RMSE = 0.133 m vs. test RMSE
    = 0.139 m), showcasing that DRF is considerably better than other approaches in
    terms of model generalization capability. As is always the case for machine learning,
    model evaluation and selection based on hyperparameter tuning require substantial
    computational resources. Still, we anticipate that more in-situ groundwater use
    data are collected and employ predictor datasets with higher spatial resolutions,
    ensemble machine learning approaches like DRF will continue to deliver substantial
    improvements over traditional methods such as MLR and KNN (Majumdar et al., 2020,
    Majumdar et al., 2021, Majumdar et al., 2022). 6. Conclusions In this work, we
    developed a machine learning model (AIWUM 2.0) using distributed random forests
    to predict annual groundwater use across the MISE region (which also includes
    MAP) at 1-km spatial resolution from 2014–2020. We use 14 predictor variables
    (latitude, longitude, five crop types, precipitation, temperature, evapotranspiration,
    surface runoff, infiltration rate, and irrigation) to train the model. The results
    show that AIWUM 2.0 substantially outperforms previous models in terms of error
    metrics, with DRF showing the best model performance (in terms of generalizability)
    compared with other machine learning algorithms. Predictions of annual groundwater
    use from AIWUM 2.0 were then disaggregated using weights derived from real-time
    flowmeter data to estimate monthly crop-specific water use for five crop types.
    Although there is a data scarcity issue in this region, our method produces robust
    estimates of groundwater use that improve upon the state of the science (for any
    region) and existing methods for estimating groundwater use in the MISE region.
    Estimating groundwater pumping, especially at the scale of the individual field,
    as we do in this study, is extremely challenging. The improvement we provide over
    previously published water use estimates (Wilson, 2021) demonstrates both the
    complexity of this problem as well as the effectiveness of our methods. Thus,
    this work presents a path forward to make regional spatially continuous estimates
    of water use with limited data availability. Our approach was also able to better
    capture the variance of annual groundwater use at the county scale when compared
    to the AIWUM 1.0 predictions. Hypothesis testing confirmed that the differences
    in the AIWUM 1.0 and AIWUM 2.0 annual county-scale groundwater use predictions
    for the year 2015 are statistically significant, with p-values of 1.16E-15 and
    1.89E-08, respectively. Hence, the improved groundwater use datasets produced
    from this research can advance the ongoing USGS efforts to develop a hydrologic
    decision support system in the region. Using higher-resolution remote sensing
    datasets that are indicative of plant water use, such as the OpenET datasets (Melton
    et al., 2021; Volk et al., 2024), vegetation and plant water indices, downscaled
    soil moisture (Fang et al., 2022, Lakshmi and Bin, 2023), and other surface water
    proxies could enhance the identification of catfish ponds and estimation of relative
    contributions of surface water and groundwater for irrigation. Higher spatial
    resolution datasets are also expected to improve the model fit. Nevertheless,
    in this study, we can successfully improve the annual-scale groundwater use estimates
    and disaggregate them to monthly timesteps in the MISE region, which serves as
    an appropriate test site for assessing integrated remote sensing and machine learning-based
    approaches in data-scarce settings. CRediT authorship contribution statement Sayantan

    Agriculture consumes about 70–90% of the world’s water resources (Bian et al.,
    2019). The availability of water for crops and their resistance to shortages during
    growth affect the overall yield, quality, and profitability of field produce.
    With global climate change and the growing imbalance between water supply and
    demand, farmers are dealing with increasing shortages in agricultural water resources
    (García-Tejero et al., 2018). Therefore, it is important to develop tools to monitor
    crop water status on a large scale and at low cost (Khanal et al., 2017). Drip-irrigation
    systems were developed to increase water-use efficiency by directing the wetting
    front to the root zone; which can increase crop yield by 20–90% (Postel, 2001),
    use 30–50% less water than traditional surface-irrigation techniques and reach
    90–95% irrigation efficiency (World Bank, 2006). An additional step toward improving
    water-use efficiency is to bury the drip-irrigation line in the soil. Subsurface
    drip irrigation has been extensively investigated with many crops and has been
    shown to improve irrigation and nutrient management while maximizing yield and
    decreasing water consumption (Phene et al., 1987). However, due to improper maintenance
    or operation of the irrigation system (e.g., physical damage caused by vehicles
    and/or animals or use of low-quality water( (Dag et al., 2015a, 2015b, 2015c),
    malfunctions frequently occur, appearing as leaks or clogs in the irrigation lines.
    Leaks refer to water flow in excess of the designed drip discharge. Major incidents
    of leaks occur when the emitters or the laterals are broken and there is an uncontrolled
    flow of water to the soil. Less severe leaks would occur from malfunctioning emitters
    that emit significantly more water than the designed amount. Clogs refer to emitters
    that fail to provide the designed amount of water due to physical clogging of
    the emitting device. Severe clog incidents occur when the water flow is completely
    blocked, while less severe clogs would occur when there is a partial decrease
    in the designed discharge. These have both direct and indirect effects on within-field
    yield variability. Directly, water is lost by surface or subsurface flow to unwanted
    areas near the field or by infiltration into the groundwater; indirectly, they
    cause significant decreases in overall yield, and in the quality and profitability
    of field production (Ihuoma & Madramootoo, 2017). Therefore, frequent on-site
    monitoring of irrigation systems is an important task for farmers, but it is also
    tedious, costly, labor-intensive, and generally difficult to implement on a regular
    basis. Moreover, certain malfunctions in subsurface-irrigation systems may not
    be easily noticeable and can only be detected when the plant displays visible
    stress. Unfortunately, it is usually too late to prevent any harm to the plant’s
    growth and development. Water status in orchard crops can be estimated by physiological
    measurements, such as stem water potential (SWP), leaf water potential, and stomatal
    conductance (Ihuoma & Madramootoo, 2017). These effectively measure the water
    status but require measuring each plant separately. Furthermore, measuring a sample
    of plants from the entire field does not indicate the water status of the entire
    field (García-Tejero et al., 2018). To estimate the latter, many point measurements
    are required, resulting in high equipment and manpower costs due to the tedious
    work and intensive labor needed (Dag et al., 2015a, 2015b, 2015c; Ihuoma & Madramootoo,
    2017). Early detection of irrigation-pipe clogging or leaking in the field can
    enable targeting cleaning processes and avoiding the replacement of laterals (Dag
    et al., 2015a, 2015b, 2015c). More recent modern techniques to estimate water-stress
    levels (Zarco-Tejada et al., 2012) use the strong link between physiological measurements
    and water evaporation from the leaf through stomata, represented by temperature.
    One of the plant''s responses to water shortage is stomatal closing to control
    plant water loss (Fuchs & Stanghellini, 2018). Opening of the stomata results
    in an increase in transpiration rate. In this process, the water released from
    the leaf stomata consumes energy and reduces the leaf temperature (Han et al.,
    2016). Conversely, as stomata close under water deficit, leaf temperature rises.
    Thus, leaf or canopy temperature can be used as an indicator of stomatal closure
    and consequently, plant stress (Fuchs & Stanghellini, 2018; Jackson et al., 1981).
    Indicators derived from high-resolution airborne thermal imagery have accurately
    described the spatial heterogeneity of water status in orchards by targeting individual
    plant crowns (Bellvert et al., 2016; Gonzalez-Dugo et al., 2013), using both manned
    platforms and unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV) (Berni et al., 2009; Gonzalez-Dugo
    et al., 2012, 2013; Sepulcre-Cantó et al., 2006). Remote-sensing-derived indicators
    enable mapping water stress over large spaces, and studies have revealed that
    high-resolution airborne thermal imagery enables the assessment of discontinuous
    canopies because pure plant crowns can be targeted, thus eliminating background
    effects (Gonzalez-Dugo et al., 2013). There are many previous studies on remote
    sensing and machine learning for crop water stress (Virnodkar et al., 2020), however,
    to the best of our knowledge there are no papers in the peer reviewed literature
    for detecting malfunctions in the irrigation lines. A preliminary study within
    our group that was presented in a conference (Kalo et al., 2021) showed the feasibility
    of identifying irrigation malfunctions in drip systems by thermal images using
    machine learning for a case study of olive plants. Data from 100 ha of olive groves
    were collected using an airborne thermal camera. Results were 89.5% and 87.5%
    accurate in detecting leaks and clogs, respectively, using random forest (RF)
    algorithms (Kalo et al., 2021). Accurate predictions can be challenging, and the
    situation is further complicated when the classifier is required to distinguish
    between several classes to make predictions. Thus, numerous efforts have been
    made to improve the performance of classifiers (Silva-Palacios et al., 2017).
    Basic classification approaches (multiclass, binary) give poor results, producing
    a high rate of missed malfunctions (false-negative rate [FNR]) and a high false
    alarm rate (false-positive rate [FPR]). In multiclass classification, Silva-Palacios
    et al. (2017) showed that classification performance can be improved by decomposing
    the multiclass problem into a hierarchy of smaller or less complex intermediate
    classification problems (Silva-Palacios et al., 2017). There are no known studies
    on fully automated georeferenced detection of small-scale irrigation malfunctions
    in subsurface drip irrigation systems. The objective of this study was to develop
    an automated method to detect malfunctions in drip irrigation systems using thermal
    remote sensing in commercial orchards in semiarid areas. In this study, different
    approaches were developed and evaluated to improve classification and to distinguish
    between malfunctions. They were developed and evaluated on a case study of almond
    plant (Prunus dulcis) orchards and tested in a jojoba (Simmondsia chinensis) plantation.
    The specific objectives were to: (i) extract features for classification based
    on temperature and image-processing algorithms; (ii) develop a pipeline that classifies
    between plants under normal and malfunctioning conditions using classification
    models; (iii) evaluate the performance on different types of crops (almonds and
    jojoba). The study aimed to develop a system for detecting irrigation malfunctions.
    An effective system would be considered one that detects most of the malfunctions
    while minimizing false alarms. Materials and methods Plant material and field
    campaigns Three field campaigns were conducted, two in commercial almond plants
    orchards in two different geographical regions in July 2020, and another in a
    commercial jojoba plantation in July 2022 (Table 1). Based on the type of crop
    and their biological taxonomy, the nomenclature used throughout the paper will
    vary, referring to both almond and jojoba as plants. Table 1 Description of the
    fields tested in the field campaigns Full size table A manual scan for detecting
    malfunctions was performed at each site by scouting the almond and jojoba orchards.
    Plants in which evidence of excess water (increased growth, weed vegetation, increased
    soil moisture) or water shortage (signs of soil drought or plants exhibiting water-stress
    symptoms) was observed were marked with a marking tape with a unique ID number
    and their location was recorded using a real-time kinematic (RTK) GPS (Fig. 1a,
    b and c). These plants were labeled as suspected for leaks or clogs, respectively.
    The location of the malfunctions was geotagged using a handheld RTK GPS receiver
    (Spectra Precision SP60 receiver, Trimble, Westminster, CO, USA) (accuracy of
    1 cm) with GIS software (ArcPad, Esri, Redlands, CA, USA). All other plants were
    considered normal (no malfunction detected). SWP, a direct measurement of water
    status in the stem, was measured in the suspected plants with an ARIMAD-7000 pressure
    chamber (MRC Ltd., Holon, Israel). Table 2 details the distribution of the scouted
    plants in each location (dataset). Fig. 1 Thermal mosaics for each dataset with
    locations of irrigation system malfunctions: a Lavi—almonds, b Kedma—almonds c
    Sde David—jojoba d geographical location of the fields e geographical location
    of the country Full size image Table 2 Description of the labeled data for each
    location Full size table In Kedma and Lavi, SWP was measured on visually tagged
    plants, whereas in Sde David, SWP was measured on plants selected from the thermal
    image. In Kedma and Sde David, the SWP measurements were conducted on pre-wrapped,
    shaded leaves after an equilibration period of 2 h. In Lavi, SWP measurements
    were conducted on shaded leaves without pre-wrapping (a small branch was cut and
    immediately wrapped). In the jojoba orchard, following the image acquisition and
    the SWP measurements, eight plants were chosen from locations that were suspected
    for malfunctions (four labeled as leaks and four as clogs), and their irrigation
    pipes were unburied from the ground and were sent to the laboratory to test the
    drippers functionality. Thermal image acquisition Thermal images were acquired
    using a FLIR A655SC infrared camera (FLIR Systems, Melville, NY, USA) with a resolution
    of 640 × 480 pixels, sensitive in the spectral range of 7.5–13 μm, with an accuracy
    of ± 2 °C or ± 2% of the reading, and with a thermal sensitivity of < 0.05 °C
    @ + 30 °C/50 mK. The camera uses an uncooled microbolometer detector and is able
    to detect objects in a temperature range from − 20 to + 150 °C. The camera was
    equipped with a 13 mm focal length lens (field of view of 45o) and was mounted
    on a DJI Matrice 600 Pro UAV (Nanshan, Shenzhen, China). A single-board computer
    (Intel NUC, CPU i5) controlled the thermal camera and stored the image stream
    during the mission. The UAV flew at a height of 100 m above ground level (AGL)
    at a velocity of 5 m s−1. The acquisition path was planned with 80% overlap between
    neighboring legs and 80% overlap along the flight leg. The resulting ground spatial
    resolution was 0.13 m pixel-1 from the flight altitude AGL mentioned above. The
    images were acquired between 11:00 and 13:00 to ensure high solar radiation for
    plant photosynthesis and to avoid typical afternoon strong winds during the campaigns.
    Mosaics (Fig. 1) were created. ThermCam software (FLIR® Systems, Inc., Billerica,
    MA, USA) and Pix4D mapper software (Pix4D, Prilly, Switzerland) or Agisoft software
    package (Metashape professional 1.6.5). The thermal datasets were acquired along
    three years, and different orthomosaicing packages were available at each time.
    Six ground control points (GCP) were placed on the orchard edges and one GCP was
    placed inside the orchard. The GCPs consisted of 1 × 1 m “X” shaped objects, covered
    by aluminum, to be clearly seen in the thermal image (due to the low emissivity
    of aluminum). The coordinates of the GCP were measured using a real-time kinematic
    (RTK) GPS (Spectra Precision SP60 receiver) to increase the accuracy of the images’
    photogrammetric processing. In addition, meteorological data were measured during
    the air campaigns. A mobile meteorological station was placed in the field and
    recorded air temperature (°C), relative humidity, solar radiation (W m−2), wind
    speed (m s−1), and wind direction 2 m aboveground. The sampling rate was 0.1 Hz
    and 1-min averages were logged in a data-acquisition controller (CR10X, Campbell
    Scientific, Logan, UT, USA). Datasets The almond plants dataset (denoted as “combined”)
    was composed of data from the campaigns at the two locations (Lavi and Kedma)
    and included 434 records (73 clogs, 202 leaks, and 159 normal). The jojoba plants
    dataset included data from the campaign at Sde David with 870 records (349 clogs,
    163 leaks, and 358 normal). The records included thermographic measurements from
    thermal imaging of the plants, meteorological measurements collected simultaneously,
    and calculated features from the raw data. Image processing The image-processing
    phase (Fig. 2) included three main stages: pre-processing, image segmentation,
    and plant detection. The workflow was implemented in MATLAB© version R2020a (MathWorks
    Inc., Natick, MA, USA). Fig. 2 Flow diagram of the image processing process. It
    includes three steps: a Pre-processing, b Image segmentation and c Plant detection
    Full size image Pre-processing (Fig. 2a) included splitting the thermal image
    mosaic into plots, to generate a separate georeferenced image for each plot. For
    each plot, a separate image and TFW file were created. This was performed to enable
    to perform image processing on each plot separately since many image processing
    methods are not suitable for segmenting thermal images with multiple objects whose
    temperatures differ greatly. Then, a pixel conversion was performed: pixels with
    extreme values (compared to the air temperature—such as negative values) were
    set to zero, and pixels with values higher than 60 °C were set to the maximum
    value. Finally, two parameters were extracted using the bi-modal behavior of the
    histogram of the thermal image: the peak with the lower values corresponds to
    canopy and the peak with the higher values corresponds to soil. These parameters
    were later used as input for the image segmentation algorithms. In the image segmentation
    stage (Fig. 2b), the thermal image of each plot was segmented into two classes,
    vegetation, and soil, using three segmentation techniques: Otsu (Otsu, 1979),
    continuous max-flow and min-cut (Yuan et al., 2010), and full-width-half-max (Rud
    et al., 2015). The temperature histogram of the field was used to create the two
    classes. The Otsu’s automatic thresholding method (Otsu, 1979) was used to overcome
    the inconsistency of the remote sensed images. The spatially continuous max-flow
    and min-cut (CMF) framework was used to overcome the binary labelling problems
    (Yuan et al., 2010). The Full-Width Half-Maximum (FWHM) rule was used to distinguish
    the pixels with a high probability of being vegetation from pixels that were likely
    to be soil. Since FWHM is known as unsuitable for segmenting thermal images with
    multiple plants that differ greatly in their temperature, the rule was computed
    for each plot separately. A thermal image of the plot was used as input to all
    segmentation algorithms, and the CMF algorithm also used vegetation and soil class
    characteristics values which were determined by the two peaks of the Gaussian
    curve; the output was a binary mask of the thermal image. In the plant detection
    stage (Fig. 2c), plants were detected using different methods including morphological
    methods, the watershed algorithm, and a distance matrix (Image Segmentation, Image
    Processing Toolbox, MATLAB). Morphological methods included image opening, creation
    of an inverted mask, detection of regional minima in the distance matrix and modification
    of the image to preserve regional minima at non-zero pixels in a mask representing
    plant centroids. The watershed algorithm (Meyer, 1994) has been successfully applied
    to detect plant crowns in remote thermal images of palm plants (Cohen et al.,
    2012), almond plants (Camino et al., 2018) and mangrove plants in which a pre-processing
    using Otsu''s threshold method and morphological operations were also included
    (Biswas et al., 2020). Using the watershed method requires two critical steps
    for accurate identification of plant crowns: generating a binary grayscale image
    and delineating markers. The reason for using the watershed procedure to identify
    a canopy in thermal photographs is that canopy objects are colder than the ground
    around them and can be considered as depressions that fill up gradually until
    their threshold temperature is reached. The best result of the algorithm will
    be a single basin for each plant. Input to the watershed algorithm was the distance
    matrix of the initial mask, which contains the Euclidean distance between a pixel
    and its nearest nonzero pixel; the output was a final mask. Afterwards, the ‘bwconncomp’
    function (pixel connectivity set to 8) was used to find connected components in
    the final binary image (Region and Image Properties, Image Processing Toolbox,
    MATLAB). This function returns a variable (CC) containing the connected components
    found, which is used by the ‘regionprops’ function. The ‘regionprops’ function
    returns a table containing information about each object and its pixels which
    used to calculate the predictor variables of the model. Feature extraction In
    the image processing stage, a binary mask was automatically created for each plant.
    The mask consisted of zeros and ones. Pixels representing the plant''s pixels
    were assigned a value of one and all other pixels were assigned the value of zero.
    Features were extracted from the thermal ortho-mosaics. The values in the thermal
    image represent the absolute temperature of each pixel, as obtained from the camera.
    Using each plant''s binary mask, the plant''s pixels on the thermal image were
    selected and its characteristic features were calculated, e.g., the maximum temperature
    of the selected pixels was the ‘Max’ feature of the corresponding plant, the median
    temperature of the selected pixels was the ''Median'' feature of the plant, etc.
    Table 3 depicts the features extracted from each plant. Table 3 Features description
    Full size table In addition, average and median temperatures were calculated in
    four circular subregions of the plant: three ring-shaped regions were defined
    and one core region, as described in Fig. 3. Fig. 3 Thermal images of a plant
    after applying one of the created masks and four circular subregions of the plant:
    three ring-shaped regions were defined and one core region Full size image Meteorological
    data There were significant temperature variations due to the large areas covered
    during the imaging flight times. Using data from the UAV flight log and the meteorological
    station placed in the field, an algorithm was developed to extract the air temperature
    at a specific acquisition time. Based on the assumption that the image was acquired
    when the UAV was closest to the plant, the exact time for each plant was extracted
    from the flight log. Based on the acquisition time of each image, the corresponding
    air temperature for each plant was derived from the data provided from the meteorological
    station. In order to account for the prevailing environmental conditions on the
    effect of plant''s water status on its canopy temperature, all of the features
    were normalized by the air temperature at the time of image acquisition. Analysis
    and feature selection Outliers were defined as data points that were 1.5 times
    the IQR above the upper quartile and below the lower quartile (Q1−1.5 * IQR or
    Q3 + 1.5 * IQR). Data points that were defined as outliers in more than one feature
    were removed. Outliers were removed for each individual dataset, rather than from
    the combined dataset. The correlation between the features was examined by Pearson’s
    correlation coefficient, p. In addition, the partial correlation coefficient controlling
    the confounding variable was also examined (Frank, 2000) by partial and non-partial
    Spearman’s rank correlation coefficient. When features were highly correlated
    (p > 0.7), the ones with the lower correlation with the target variable were removed
    (Fig. 4). This is an iterative process that ends when all the remaining features
    are uncorrelated. Then, a feature-selection process was performed using recursive
    feature elimination with cross-validation. RF was used as an estimator and the
    Matthews correlation coefficient (MCC) score was used to optimize the results
    in all four confusion matrix categories. Cross-validation was conducted by repeated
    stratified K-fold tests when splits = 5 and repeats = 5 (Scikit-learn: Machine
    Learning in Python, Pedregosa et al., JMLR 12, pp. 2825–2830, 2011). Fig. 4 Flow
    diagram of the process of removing highly correlated features Full size image
    Model selection Due to imbalance in the number of malfunction and normal samples,
    as well as multicollinearity between the features, it was necessary to examine
    the algorithms'' suitability for this type of data. Accordingly, the following
    supervised learning algorithms were examined: SVM, RF, decision tree, naïve Bayes
    and logistic regression—L1 (LR). The classification algorithms were compared according
    to their ability to accurately predict output values (malfunctions) given new
    input data. The datasets were divided into training and test sets. The test sets
    were used only for the evaluation of the final model, as depicted in Table 4.
    The same training and test sets were used for all the models. The evaluation of
    the combined dataset involved assessing two different sizes of training sets:
    one comprising 70% of the dataset and the other consisting of 80% of the dataset.
    Table 4 Description of the splits for the training and test sets Full size table
    The best classifier model from the five algorithms described above was selected
    after automatic hyperparameter tuning was conducted using K-fold cross-validation
    (K = 5) with n = 5 repetitions of the training set. The hyperparameter values
    for each algorithm were automatically tuned using grid search implemented in Python.
    All features were given equal weight quality and learning rate to improve the
    models'' accuracy. Standardization was performed for the LR and SVM algorithms
    because it effectively handles outliers. As for the naive Bayes model, minmax
    normalization was applied because it provides a uniform scale for all the features
    (Dhaka et al., 2021). Normalization and standardization were conducted with a
    Python script. Classification models The following supervised learning approaches
    were examined for classification (Fig. 5): binary (malfunction, normal), multiclass
    (clog, leak, normal), and hierarchical (clog, leak, normal). In the multiclass
    approach a categorical variable with three labels was defined as the target variable,
    in addition a separate feature selection process was conducted when considering
    the target variable as ordinal (0-clog, 1- normal, 2-leak). Fig. 5 Schematic description
    of the examined classification approaches Full size image After examining the
    properties for each class it was noticed that there is an overlap in the values
    of the clog and normal classes. The hierarchical approach aims to address this
    overlap and solves two simpler scenarios by using two stages and is illustrated
    in Fig. 6. Fig. 6 Hierarchical classification approach flow diagram. TP true positive,
    FP false positive, TN true negative, FN false negative Full size image Stage 1
    (Classifier 1) Classification was performed between (clog) and (leak + normal),
    aimed to handle the overlap between the clog and normal classes in the almond
    datasets; therefore, the target variable labels were P for clog and N for normal
    and leak samples. After the prediction was made, leak samples that had been classified
    as P were considered as true positive (TP) as they had been identified as irrigation
    malfunctions. Normal samples that were classified as P were considered false positive
    (FP) (false alarm for malfunction) (Table 5). The samples which were classified
    as N (false negative [FN] + true negative [TN]) at this stage were sent to the
    second classification stage. Table 5 Confusion matrix of the first stage of the
    hierarchical classification model Full size table Stage 2 (Classifier 2) Classification
    was performed between [normal] and [leak], aimed to handle the overlap between
    normal and leak classes in the almond datasets; therefore, the target variable
    labels were P for leak and N for normal samples. However, there were some clog
    samples that were classified in the positive category and proceeded to stage 2.
    Training clog samples at stage 2 were handled and examined in three different
    ways. The first method was to label clog as leak—the positive class; the second
    was to label clog as normal—the negative class; and the last was to eliminate
    clog samples from the second stage of training. Performance measures The training
    set was used for feature selection, hyperparameter tuning and finally, model selection.
    Through cross-validation on the training set, training and validation sets were
    generated. The test set was used to evaluate the final model (algorithm + classification
    model); the final model was first trained on the training dataset (without cross-validation)
    and then evaluated on the test dataset. The class set contained three labels:
    leak and clog—which were considered irrigation malfunctions, and normal—which
    was considered a normal condition. Both cases of a leak classified as a clog or
    a clog classified as a leak were considered TP since it was regarded as a malfunction
    and was considered the least severe error. Given a classifier and an instance,
    the four possible outcomes were (Table 6): TP: there is an irrigation malfunction,
    and it is classified as a malfunction. FN: there is an irrigation malfunction,
    and it is classified as normal. TN: there is a normal condition, and it is classified
    as normal. FP: there is a normal condition, and it is classified as a malfunction.
    Table 6 Confusion matrix Full size table Table 6 presents the standard classification
    metrics that were used to evaluate the classification approaches. Results Ground
    truth In the almond datasets, measurement of SWP revealed an overlap between normal
    conditions and leak malfunctions, whereas the SWP range for clogs was quite different
    from them, with higher values. Most of the leaks were primarily caused by animals
    damaging the irrigation system due to the shallow depths at which the laterals
    were placed (0.1 m). In the jojoba plantation, the SWP for the clogged drippers
    was higher than that for the normal and leak conditions. Dripper clogging was
    caused by root penetration. Leaking in some drippers was caused by salt deposits
    on the diaphragm, which reduced its flexibility and caused an increase in flow
    (Fig. 7). Fig. 7 Images from the laboratory tests. a Drippers labeled as leaky.
    b Drippers labeled as clogged Full size image Removing outliers Application of
    the rules described in the ‘Materials and Methods’ section for outlier detection
    resulted in the removal of 26 outliers in the Lavi dataset, 15 in the Kedma dataset
    and 107 in the Sde David dataset. This yielded a total of 395 and 763 records
    for the almond and jojoba orchards, respectively (See Table 7). Table 7 Calculation
    formulas and explanation for classification metrics Full size table Removal of
    highly correlated variables Using the iterative process described in the ‘Materials
    and Methods’ section, features that were highly correlated (p > 0.8) were excluded.
    Table 8 presents the iterations of the feature removal process for each dataset
    individually ([Kedma & Lavi], [Kedma], [Lavi] and [Sde David]). The Spearman correlation
    coefficients of the examined feature with the target variable in each step is
    depicted. Shaded cells indicate higher coefficients compared to the removed feature.
    The following ten features were excluded: Mean, Max, MAD, kurtosis, Diff_mean_of_plot,
    Diff_median_of_row, Mean_first_ring, Mean_second_ring, Mean_third_ring, Mean_core.
    Table 8 Summary of the feature removal iterations and Spearman correlation coefficients
    with the target variable Full size table Feature selection The most significant
    variables found were ‘CWSI_minus_CWSI_of_row’, which were selected in 16 out of
    18 selection events, followed by ‘Min’ (minimum temperature) which was chosen
    in 15 out of 18 combinations. This result is in line with Spearman''s partial
    rank correlation, which showed that ‘CWSI_minus_CWSI_of_row’ was the highest-ranking
    positive correlation variable (p = 0.42) and that ‘Min’ was the highest-ranking
    negative correlation variable (p = − 0.51). The ''CWSI_minus_CWSI_of_row’ variable
    represents the difference between the CWSI of the plant and the mean CWSI of the
    entire row. This metric is a crucial indicator of localized water stress in the
    crop. When this variable consistently appears as a significant feature, it suggests
    that the deviation between plant-level and row-level water stress is a critical
    factor in understanding the overall crop performance. Higher positive correlations
    indicate that as ‘CWSI_minus_CWSI_of_row’ increases, crop stress tends to be more
    localized to individual plants, which can be valuable information for targeted
    malfunction. Conversely, ‘Min’ refers to the minimum temperature within the plant’s
    canopy, subtracted from the air temperature measured simultaneously. A consistently
    high negative correlation suggests that lower canopy temperatures, compared to
    the surrounding air temperature, have a pronounced impact on crop performance.
    This might indicate that extreme temperature variability within the plant canopy
    can lead to increased stress or growth anomalies in the crop. Mixed datasets consisting
    of Kedma and Lavi required more features for the model (on average 16 features)
    than a single dataset (on average 9 features). This could be because plants with
    equal water stress have different temperatures under various meteorological conditions,
    causing a larger unexplained variability. Particularly, the need for more features
    in mixed datasets implies that plants under the same level of water stress respond
    differently to temperature variations based on the specific meteorological conditions
    in their surroundings. The selected features for each algorithm are shown in Table
    9 including each feature''s rank after implementing recursive feature elimination
    using RF. Table 9 Results of feature selection for each combination of classification
    approaches and the rank for each feature Full size table Classification analysis
    The accuracy, MCC, FNR, FPR, and F1 score revealed that SVM and RF produce the
    best classification results among all examined models. As already noted, two options
    for feature selection were considered: the first used a categorical target variable,
    and the second, a variable of an ordinal type. The features selected based on
    the categorical type variable did not improve classification performance (Table
    9). Multiclass classification The results of the multiclass classification are
    shown in Table 10. Table 10 Results of the multiclass classification approach
    applied with different datasets Full size table Almond datasets Comparing single-site
    datasets, Lavi showed better performance than Kedma, with a MCC value of 0.52
    vs. 0.28. The reason for this difference may be that Lavi contained only two classes
    (Leak, Normal), whereas Kedma contained three classes (Leak, Clog, Normal), making
    it harder to classify the data. This difference can also be seen when comparing
    the results of the combined dataset (MCC of 0.28). The FNR (error type 1—missing
    a malfunction) achieved by the combined dataset was higher than that of Kedma.
    This could be because plants with similar water stress have different temperatures
    under different meteorological conditions, resulting in larger unexplained variability
    between samples from different sites. The Kedma and the Combined (with three classes)
    datasets, performed poorly in terms of FPR (error type 2)—50% for Kedma and 39%
    for the combined set. Lavi dataset yielded better results, with a FPR of 19%,
    because the problem was less complex. Jojoba datasets The best performance was
    achieved for the Sde David dataset, with a MCC value of 0.63. The better results
    may be attributed to two factors: firstly, Sde David had a larger number of records
    in the training set, and secondly, it exhibited larger differences in the canopy
    temperature values between the malfunction types. Sde David resulted with the
    lowest FPR of 10%. Binary classification The results of the binary classification
    are shown in Table 11. Table 11 Results of the binary classification approach
    by datasets Full size table Almond datasets When comparing single-site datasets,
    Lavi showed better performance than Kedma, with a MCC value of 0.4 compared to
    0.2. This difference may be related to the fact that the positive class of Kedma
    was created by joining two types of malfunctions which were quite different in
    their range of predictor values. This merge caused the FNR to increase from 21%
    (in the multiclass approach) to 24%, and the FPR to increase from 51 to 56% in
    the Kedma dataset. However, performance improved slightly for the combined dataset.
    MCC was increased from 0.28 to 0.29 and FNR decreased by 4%, but FPR increased
    by 3%. In comparison with the multiclass approach, the binary approach achieved
    relatively poor results across the almond dataset algorithms. Jojoba datasets
    Sde David contained three classes. The fact that the positive class was created
    by joining two types of malfunctions, which were quite different in their range
    of predictor values, resulted in relatively poor results compared to the multiclass
    approach—MCC of 0.61, and FNR of leak and clog of 8% and 20%, respectively. Hierarchical
    classification Basic classification methods (multiclass, binary) produced a high
    rate of missed malfunctions (FNR) and false alarms (FPR), with a FNR of 33% and
    a FPR of 40% in the combined dataset. This is in line with the ground truth which
    revealed a significant overlap between the normal class and the leak and clog
    classes. A hierarchical classification approach was used to overcome this limitation.
    The implementation of this approach could not be examined in the Lavi dataset
    since it had only two classes. Stage 1—classification between [clog] and [leak + normal]
    The results of the first classification stage of the hierarchical classification
    approach are presented in Table 12. The SVM model showed lower FPR in the almond
    and jojoba datasets: for Kedma, a FPR of 13.2% with MCC of 0.65, for the combined
    dataset, FPR of 3.6% with MCC of 0.76, and for Sde David, FPR of 4.1% with MCC
    of 0.58. Table 12 Results of the first stage of the hierarchical classification
    approach by datasets Full size table Stage 2—classification between leak and normal
    The results of this stage (Table 13) contain the results of both stages, as they
    include the predictions for the two stages. Table 13 The results of the hierarchical
    classification approach Full size table For the almond plants, when clogs were
    removed from the training of the classifier at stage 2, the MCC was improved by
    0.01 for the combined dataset and by 0.02–0.1 for the Kedma dataset. The Balanced_ACC
    increased by 5%. The FPR of leaks decreased by 3–7% for Kedma and remained the
    same for the combined dataset. This improvement can be attributed to the fact
    that when clogs were relabeled as leaks (positive), the value range of features
    in the positive class increases and approaches that of the negative class, leading
    to a greater FPR (false alarm) for leaks. When clogs were relabeled as normal,
    the FPR of leaks decreased by 16% for the SVM using Kedma and by ~ 2% for the
    RF. However, the FNR of leaks increased by 4–13%, which may be because leaks and
    clogs have similar behavior under severe water-stress conditions (a similarity
    is found in the SWP values of leaks and clogs); therefore, when clogs were labeled
    as normal, they caused leaks which have similar features to clogs being classified
    incorrectly. When the training dataset size was increased from 70 to 80%, the
    classification results of the RF improved, with MCC increased from 0.27 to 0.35
    and the Balanced_ACC from 63.7% to 68%. For the SVM model, the results did not
    significantly improve: MCC by 0.01 and Balanced_ACC by 1%. This corresponds to
    the literature stating that SVM performance is not compromised when trained on
    small datasets (Virnodkar et al., 2020). For the Sde David jojoba dataset, the
    best results were obtained when clogs were relabeled as leaks in terms of FNR,
    probably because leaks and clogs were more similar to each other than the normal
    class, and they did not overlap with the normal class. The results for this dataset
    were relatively poor in comparison to the other approaches. This is probably because
    the hierarchical model was developed according to the properties of the almond
    datasets, which were quite different from the properties of the jojoba dataset.
    For the Kedma and combined datasets, hierarchical classification using SVM produced
    the best results. For Lavi and Sde David, multiclass classification using SVM
    gave the best performance. Table 14 summarizes the results for the training phase.
    Table 14 Summary of the best results obtained for each dataset in the validation
    sets Full size table Classification performance on the test set Each dataset was
    examined on the same test set that had never been used during the process (Table
    15). The performance of models that were trained on data from a single source
    was quite poor compared to the combined dataset. This implied that training a
    model with a dataset from one site and applying the model to a dataset from a
    different site performs poorly. A model selected based on the Lavi dataset achieved
    a MCC of 0.52 through cross-validation, whereas a model trained using the Lavi
    dataset and tested on the Kedma dataset achieved a MCC of 0.08. This is probably
    due to the addition of the clog class, which did not appear in the training set.
    A model trained on the Kedma dataset achieved a MCC of 0.3 through cross-validation,
    whereas a model trained using the Kedma dataset and tested on the Lavi dataset
    achieved a MCC of 0.15. Table 15 Results of the selected models for the test set
    Full size table When comparing Tables 14 and 15, a generalization error is evident
    as the results decrease when testing the model on different datasets. One possible
    explanation for this is the significant differences in feature selection during
    the training phase for each dataset, which can make classification challenging.
    However, this issue does not seem to affect the combined dataset and the Sde David
    dataset. The combined dataset incorporates data from two distinct orchards across
    both phases, while the Sde David dataset contains plantations from the same region.
    Consequently, the plantations within these datasets exhibit similarities in their
    features, contributing to more consistent results. Discussion Over the past few
    decades, machine learning techniques have been progressively used in diverse applications
    of remote sensing. SVM and RF classifiers show potential for crop water stress
    determination using remote sensing data but have not been fully explored (Virnodkar
    et al., 2020). The objective of previous models for crop water stress determination
    was to determine the water status of field crops and orchards to divide the field
    into management zones and manage irrigation. No attempts were found to determine
    abnormal water status conditions that may result from malfunctions in the irrigation
    system. In this study we contribute with an automated method to detect malfunctions
    in drip-irrigation systems using thermal remote sensing in commercial orchards
    in semiarid areas and evaluate it. The processing methodologies were developed
    and evaluated on a case study of almond plants and tested on different combinations
    of training and testing datasets. In addition, the developed method was also evaluated
    on a different type of crop, a jojoba plantation. The performance of the developed
    models was evaluated by a k-fold cross validation. This training process produced
    stable results as it is demonstrated on four performance measures of a RF model
    in Fig. 8. The boxplots of the 5 repetitions are presented, where the stability
    of the training process can be observed (Fig. 8). Fig. 8 An example of the stability
    of the performance measures for a random forest model on the combined dataset
    Full size image Training the model on samples from one site (single-site dataset)
    and testing it on samples from another site resulted in poor classification results.
    However, using the combined dataset, which contained samples from both sites for
    training, led to significantly improved results. This discrepancy in performance
    can be attributed to the fact that during training, the model was exposed to examples
    from two different locations, allowing it to learn a wider range of features.
    It''s important to note that feature selection was performed during the training
    process only. Analysis of Table 9 revealed differences in the selected features
    for each dataset and model, which could have contributed to generalization errors
    when training on one dataset and testing on another. For example, when the model
    was trained using the binary approach on the Lavi dataset, only the ''Min'' feature
    was included as input. In contrast, when training on the Kedma dataset, a larger
    number of features were selected, indicating their potential to better predict
    the target variable in that specific dataset. Consequently, when the model trained
    on the Lavi dataset was tested on the Kedma dataset, suboptimal performance was
    observed. The above results indicate that machine learning models trained on small
    datasets may effectively detect malfunctions for samples from the same location
    and type. However, their performance might degrade when applied to fields in different
    locations and crops. The reason for this limited generalization could be attributed
    to subtle variations in environmental conditions that differ between locations.
    This is a common result in machine learning as indicated in other research (e.g.,
    Ying, 2019). To enhance generalization, it is recommended to acquire data from
    different locations and use this data in the training. RF was found to be the
    best classification algorithm. Compared to the SVM, it was not adversely affected
    by different dataset splits/sizes. The hierarchical classification model achieved
    better results than the multiclass or binary models, resulting in a reduced FPR
    while the FNR did not increase. The jojoba study was characterized by a large
    number of clog samples and less leak samples, but due to the partial overlap in
    the temperature range between these two classes, it was difficult to differentiate
    between them. However, there was a large difference between these classes and
    the normal class, which led to a low rate of missed malfunctions (FNR). In the
    campaign that was conducted on almond orchards, leaks caused hypoxia in the soil,
    restricting roots function and thereby inducing to the plants water stress. This
    resulted in thermal behavior similar to that of clogs where shortage of water
    induced also water stress. Therefore, classification between leaks and clogs in
    this crop type was a limitation for this study. The model that succeeded to best
    overcome this ambiguity was the hierarchical model, which yielded the best performance.
    Future research could focus on a different type of crop with similar characteristics
    to the jojoba plantations that produced better classification. In order to increase
    the amount of data learned by the model, future studies can consider using deep
    learning models based on the original individual images taken by the drone for
    classification tasks. Conclusions This study developed and evaluated an automated
    method for detecting malfunctions in drip-irrigation systems using thermal remote
    sensing in commercial orchards. The models remained stable and performed well
    when trained with combined datasets. Random Forest was the preferred algorithm,
    and the hierarchical classification model achieved better results for the almond
    datasets. Differentiating between clogs and leaks was challenging in the jojoba
    study. Future research can explore similar crop types and utilize deep learning
    models for improved classification. Data availability The datasets generated and

  description: Plant nitrogen (N) is one of the key factors for its growth and yield.
    Timely assessment of plant N at a spatio-temporal scale enables its precision
    management in the field scale with better N use efficiency. Airborne imaging spectroscopy
    is a potential technique for non-invasive near real-time rapid assessment of plant
    N on a field scale. The present study attempted to assess plant N in a wheat field
    with three different irrigation levels (I1–I3) along with five nitrogen treatments
    (N0–N4) using a UAV hyperspectral imager with a spectral range of 400 to 1000
    nm. A total of 61 vegetative indices were evaluated to find suitable indices for
    estimating plant N. A hybrid method of R-Square (R2) and Variable Importance Projection

    Explore all metrics Abstract Plant nitrogen (N) is one of the key factors for
    its growth and yield. Timely assessment of plant N at a spatio-temporal scale
    enables its precision management in the field scale with better N use efficiency.
    Airborne imaging spectroscopy is a potential technique for non-invasive near real-time
    rapid assessment of plant N on a field scale. The present study attempted to assess
    plant N in a wheat field with three different irrigation levels (I1–I3) along
    with five nitrogen treatments (N0–N4) using a UAV hyperspectral imager with a
    spectral range of 400 to 1000 nm. A total of 61 vegetative indices were evaluated
    to find suitable indices for estimating plant N. A hybrid method of R-Square (R2)
    and Variable Importance Projection (VIP) followed by Variance Inflation Factor
    was used to limit the best suitable N-sensitive 13 spectral indices. The selected
    indices were used as feature vectors in the Artificial Neural Network algorithm
    to model and generate a spatial map of plant N in the experimental wheat field.
    The model resulted in R2 values of 0.97, 0.84, and 0.86 for training, validation,
    and testing respectively for plant N assessment. Similar content being viewed

    High productivity with enhanced nutrient-use efficiency is one of the important
    desirable agronomic, economic, and environmental goals in crop husbandry (Haque,
    2006). In most crops, nitrogen (N) is the most limiting nutrient for crop production
    (Ågren et al., 2012), and its efficient use is important for economic and ecological
    sustainability (Mălinaş et al., 2022). Wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) is a high
    N-demanding crop, where insufficient application of it may result in reduced production,
    whereas excessive fertilization implies wasting resources and an increase in environmental
    pollution (Good & Beatty, 2011). Nitrogen fertilization of wheat can account for
    up to 30% of the total production cost and around 50–75% of the N applied to the
    field is not used by the plant and is lost by leaching into the soil (Baresel
    et al., 2008; Hirel et al., 2011). Therefore, nitrogen is a key element required
    for plant growth, and is one of the most important yield-limiting nutrients in
    crop production in all agroecological regions of the world (Guo et al., 2019;
    Zhu et al., 2007). Therefore, rapid and accurate detection of the wheat nitrogen
    status is of great significance for growth diagnosis and precision management
    to achieve higher yield and better quality while also minimizing adverse environmental
    impacts (Yang et al., 2019). At present, the implementation of remote sensing
    (RS) technology in precision agriculture provides new opportunities for the non-destructive
    real-time diagnosis of plant nitrogen status (Blekanov et al., 2023; Sahoo et
    al., 2015) and precision nitrogen management over a large area (Rabatel et al.,
    2017). Vegetation indices (VIs) derived from multiple spectral bands are now widely
    used in developing N monitoring models for various crops (Basyouni et al., 2015;
    Jiang et al., 2020; Ranjan et al., 2012; Xu et al., 2023). This technology contributed
    to the development of RS-based variable rate N recommendation approaches, which
    mainly use the remotely sensed crop growth information as the chief attribute
    of N fertilization (Späti et al., 2021). Many researchers have attempted to derive
    the crop biophysical and chemical parameters using (VIs) derived from field spectral
    measurements (Dehghan-Shoar et al., 2023), and sensors on satellites (Jamali et
    al., 2023) and unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) (Buthelezi et al., 2023). Even
    though satellite-based multispectral images are useful to aid N management, farmers
    are still reluctant to adopt RS technologies. Satellite images normally have lower
    spatial and temporal resolution and, in some areas, they can be distressed by
    cloud cover during the image acquisition (Hunt et al., 2005). UAVs have tremendous
    potential for high-resolution requirements for site-specific management of weed
    control (Anderegg et al., 2023; Esposito et al., 2021; Jurado-Expósito et al.,
    2021) and N recommendation (Jiang et al., 2023; Maresma et al., 2016). The advent
    of hyperspectral UAV sensors with narrow band widths made a breakthrough in crop
    monitoring by providing an accurate prediction of plant N levels and thereby N
    stress estimation. Leaf nitrogen content (LNC) of wheat was predicted by using
    first derivative normalized difference nitrogen index (FD-NDNI) and the first
    derivative ratio nitrogen vegetation index (FD-SRNI) with the help of random forest
    (RF) (Liang et al., 2018); the transformed chlorophyll absorption in the reflectance
    index/optimized soil-adjusted vegetation index (TCARI/OSAVI) on using partial
    least squares regression (PLSR) and modern machine learning (ML) methods, including
    artificial neural network (ANN), RF, and support vector machine (SVM) (Wang et
    al., 2021). Among the various non-parametric modeling algorithms, the RF approach
    performed best for estimating LNC in winter wheat using modified renormalized
    difference VI (RDVI) from UAV Multispectral Images (Zheng et al., 2018). Several
    other researchers also proposed UAV-based multispectral and hyperspectral VIs
    for LNC prediction in crops using different machine learning approaches (Fu et
    al., 2022; Jiale Jiang et al., 2019; Li et al., 2018; Liu et al., 2017; Osco et
    al., 2020; Xu et al., 2023; Zhang et al., 2022). On account of potential applications
    of UAV hyperspectral remote sensing in the field of agriculture and the importance
    of N management practices, the present study emphasizes the performance of various
    hyperspectral vegetation indices for wheat leaf N estimation. The study conducted
    involves an exhaustive comparative assessment of the VIs for wheat leaf N assessment
    and was performed in multiple stages, (1) UAV-based hyperspectral data collection
    and pre-processing (2) selection of the most significant indices for leaf nitrogen
    prediction and (3) prediction of leaf N through ANN using selected indices as
    input. Dataset Experimental site and field sampling An experiment was conducted
    on the Research Farm of ICAR-Indian Agricultural Research Institute, New Delhi
    with wheat crop (variety-HD 3059) during the rabi (winter) season 2021-22. The
    field is situated between 28°38′29.99″N to 28°38′26.58″N latitudes and 77°9′0.99″
    E to 77°9′5.09″E longitudes. The experiment was conducted in a split-plot design
    with three irrigation types as the main plot: I1-soil moisture sensor-based irrigation,
    I2-CWSI-based irrigation, and I3-conventional irrigation. Under each irrigation
    level, there were five levels of nitrogen application i.e., 0, 50, 100, 150, and
    200 kgha−1corresponding to N0 to N4, respectively as sub-plot treatment. As a
    basal dose, one-third of recommended N and full recommended phosphorus (P) and
    potassium (K) were applied as urea (46% N), diammonium phosphate (18% N and 46%
    P2O5), and muriate of potash (60% K2O), respectively. The remaining N was applied
    later in two equal split doses during the first and second irrigations. There
    were three replications R1, R2, and R3. The wheat crop was sown on 13th December
    2021 and was harvested on 15th April 2022. The size of the sub-plot and main plot
    were kept as 93.6 m2 (7.2 × 13 m) and 468 m2 (7.2 × 65 m), respectively. The location
    map of the study area and its experimental layout is presented in Fig. 1. The
    study area experiences a semi-arid climate with warm long summers lasting from
    April to August, monsoon in July-September, and mild winter in October. The soil
    is sandy loam (Typic Haplustepts) having a medium to angular blocky structure
    and non-calcareous texture. The soil is slightly alkaline with a mean pH of 8.0,
    mean electric conductivity of 0.25dSm−1 and organic carbon of 0.57%. The average
    nitrogen-phosphorous-potassium (NPK) content of the soil is estimated as 217.1,
    52.6, and 508.0 kgha−1, respectively. Fig. 1 Study area map showing the Geographic

    field layout Full size image Hyperspectral image acquisition using UAV The hyperspectral
    images of the wheat crop were captured using a hyperspectral camera (Nano Hyperspec
    of Headwall Photonics Inc., Bolton, MA, USA) mounted on a hexacopter (Fig. 2).
    The UAV data acquisition was conducted on 7th February 2022 during day time between
    11:00 hrs to 12:00 hrs on a sunny day within a wind speed of 2–3 ms−1, relative
    humidity ranging between 39–41%, and a temperature of 21 °C. The specifications
    of the imaging sensor used are summarized in Table 1. The flight path planning
    for the survey has been done using UgCS Mission planning software (UgCS, 2017)
    which allows the remote monitoring of the flying route, speed of the drone, height
    above the ground, and overlapping. Fig. 2 a Drone with hyperspectral camera facing
    nadir, b image data acquisition in wheat field Full size image Table 1 Major specifications
    of UAV hyperspectral sensor Full size table Methodology Preprocessing of hyperspectral
    image data The pre-processing of the acquired hyperspectral image data involved
    (1) conversion of digital numbers (DN) to radiance, (2) calculation of reflectance
    values, (3) image orthorectification (4) generation of ortho-mosaicked image for
    analysis (5) spectral smoothening and (6) crop area segmentation. Raw data conversion
    The acquired raw data was converted to radiance followed by reflectance using
    Headwall SpectralView software version 3.1.4 (Headwall Photonics, Bolton, MA,
    USA). The dark signal needs to be captured during image data acquisition due to
    varying sensor characteristics, such as sensor settings and orientation. To obtain
    an absolute radiometric value from the sensor it has to be calibrated since its
    signal is subject to influences other than the impinging light. The raw hyperspectral
    data cubes use the dark reference of the sensor captured pre-flight. The radiance
    dataset of individual scan lines was processed using the white reference generated
    using the reflectance data from pixels of calibration tarp placed in the field
    during flight. The positioning information from Global Navigation Satellite System
    (GNSS) receivers and Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) synchronized with data and
    the Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM) Digital Elevation Model was used for
    orthorectification (Santos-Rufo et al., 2020). The geo-rectified hyperspectral
    data cubes were stitched together and validated by overlaying with Google Earth
    imagery. The signal noise present in the calibrated image has been removed by
    applying a Savitzky–Golay (SG) smoothening filter with a second-order polynomial
    and the frame lengths of 5, available in image processing software ENVI 5.5 (L3
    Harris Geospatial, Boulder, CO, USA) (Ge et al., 2019). Crop area segmentation
    The wheat canopy from 45 subplots was extracted using a combined approach of thresholding
    of hyperspectral normalized difference vegetation index (hNDVI) (Rouse et al.,
    1974) and spectral angle mapper (SAM) binary masks (Rejith et al., 2020). The
    threshold for the hNDVI was selected from the histogram representing the frequency
    of vegetation index values corresponding to all 45 subplots of different N treatments.
    A threshold value was selected halfway between the vegetation peak and the neighbouring
    trough. The SAM classification was further carried out using the endmembers spectra
    computed manually by selecting the pixels of wheat, other vegetation features,
    and soil. The SAM measures the spectral angle between the endmember spectra and
    the image spectra in n-dimensional space. Lowering the angle suggests a closer
    match to reference spectra. The hNDVI mask was later multiplied with SAM binary
    mask to generate a primary mask image. Then the morphological erosion operator
    (3 × 3 matrix of ones) was applied to it to remove the mixed pixels from the canopy
    edges. Finally, this approach generates a complete mask that was used for concealing
    the wheat pixels from the neighbouring soil, shadow, and grass pixels in the hyperspectral
    image dataset. The flow chart showing the proposed methodology adopted for the
    present study is given in Fig. 3. Fig. 3 Flow chart showing the methodology adopted
    for the study Full size image Computation of vegetation indices After an exhaustive
    review of the literature, a total of 61 vegetation indices (Table 2) were selected
    for leaf N assessment using imaging spectroscopy (Adak et al., 2021; Chandel et
    al., 2019; Liang et al., 2018; Pradhan et al., 2013; Ranjan et al., 2012). It
    is evident from previous studies that, indices-based approaches combined with
    prediction techniques have yielded optimum results for N assessment. The NDVITs
    constructed by spectral and textural information of UAV multispectral imagery
    performed well in wheat leaf nitrogen concentration (LNC) monitoring (Fu et al.,
    2022). Vegetation indices such as NDRE or RERVI composed of near-infrared and
    red edge bands of UAV—multispectral scanner (UAV-MSS) data showed better results
    for estimating crop nitrogen status in rice plants (Li et al., 2018). Four representative
    vegetation indices such as the Visible Atmospherically Resistant Index (VARI),
    Red edge Chlorophyll Index (CIred−edge), Green band Chlorophyll Index (CIgreen),
    Modified Normalized Difference Vegetation Index with a blue band (mNDblue) were
    derived from the multi-angular UAV-MSS images for estimating LNC, plant nitrogen
    concentration (PNC), leaf nitrogen accumulation (LNA), and plant nitrogen accumulation
    (PNA) of wheat canopies (Lu et al., 2019). Table 2 List of spectral indices commonly
    used for the N estimation (Rλ= reflectance at λ wavelength) Full size table To
    compare the performance of different spectral indices for leaf N content at various
    N fertilizer treatments, twenty-five points were randomly selected within each
    subplot by excluding an inner buffer distance of 1m from the borders. This approach
    facilitates the exact measurements of crops and avoids the areas of bare soil
    without crops (Maresma et al., 2016). At last, the mean of the values extracted
    at each point within a subplot was used to determine the best vegetation index/es
    to predict LNC. Three sets of top-most leaf samples were collected from each plot
    for N determination and their mean was taken. The N concentration of leaf samples
    was estimated using the Micro-Kjeldahl method (Guebel et al., 1991; Ranjan et
    al., 2012). Selection of suitable indices Selection of optimal spectral bands
    through R2 The R2 value for all 61 derived indices was calculated for the growth
    stage under study. R2 value equal to or higher than 0.7 was considered as optimum
    for N assessment. In this approach, an index-by-index linear correlation matrix
    was computed to interpret redundant information. Further, Pearson correlation
    coefficient (R) values have been squared (R2) to remove inverse correlation. Selection
    of optimal spectral bands through PPR-VIP statistics Projection pursuit regression
    (PPR) is a multivariate statistical technique comprising of three-layered architecture
    with input, hidden, and output layers. Unlike the linear regression approach,
    which assumes a direct linear combination of the predictor variables accumulating
    the cost of inaccurate predictions; PPR is a non-parametric regression algorithm.
    The algorithm helps in finding the most suitable model for prediction problems.
    Projection ‘directions’ or ‘strengths’ between input and hidden neurons; hidden
    and output neurons and the activation function are calculated by minimizing the
    error using least square criteria. The mathematical formulation of the model is
    given by Eq. 1. $$L= \\sum _{i=1}^{q}{[{y}_{i}-\\sum _{k=1}^{m}{\\beta }_{ik}{f}_{k}{(\\alpha
    }_{k}^{T}x)]}^{2}$$ (1) where, \\({\\alpha }_{k}^{T}=[{\\alpha }_{k1},\\dots \\dots
    ,{\\alpha }_{kp}]\\) is the projection directions given by weights between the
    input and the hidden layers; \\({\\beta }_{k}=[{\\beta }_{1k},\\dots \\dots ,{\\beta
    }_{qk}]\\) is the projection directions given by weights between the hidden layers
    and the output layer; \\({f}_{k}\\) is the activation function; \\({y}_{i}\\)
    is the response variable which is modelled as a weighted linear combination ofthe
    activation function. PPR learns layer by layer and calculates the weights by least
    square estimation. Variable importance Projection (VIP) is a statistical technique
    for synthesizing the contribution of predictors and response variables. This measure
    is highly dependent on the accuracy and importance of the fitted model (here,
    PPR). It summarizes the contribution of a variable to the model. The indices with
    the highest VIP values (centers of the peaks observed) have been selected by keeping
    the threshold value as 0.5. The equation is given as: $$\\sqrt{n\\frac{\\sum _{j=1}^{a}{b}_{j}^{2}{t}_{j}^{T}{t}_{j}{\\left(\\frac{{w}_{kj}}{\\left|\\left|{w}_{j}\\right|\\right|}\\right)}^{2}}{\\sum
    _{j=1}^{a}{b}_{j}^{2}{t}_{j}^{T}{t}_{j}}}$$ (2) where \\(b\\) is the regression
    coefficient, \\({w}_{j}\\) is the weight vector, \\({t}_{j}\\) is the score vector
    for the \\({k}^{th}\\) element. Selection of optimal spectral bands through VIF
    statistics The Variance Inflation Factor (VIF) helps in measuring the multicollinearity
    in regression algorithms. It quantifies the inflation of variance of estimated
    coefficients. Inflation factors were calculated by regressing the predictor with
    every other predictor variable considered for the model followed by the computation
    of R-squared values. The VIF for the \\({i}^{th}\\) predictor is given by: $$VIF=
    \\frac{1}{1-{R}_{i}^{2}}$$ (3) where \\({R}_{i}^{2}\\) is the r-square value obtained.
    Artificial neural network (ANN) ANN mimics the functionality of a human brain
    where neurons work as the most fundamental unit to perform complex tasks. It is
    a three-layered architecture including input, hidden, and output layers, along
    with an activation function that ignites the most significant neuron as the output
    (Fig. 4). The fully connected structure is managed by weights from the input to
    the hidden layer followed by the hidden to the output layer (Fig. 5). ANN being
    a machine learning measure, can learn from the data and predict accordingly. The
    data traverses through the hidden layer which transforms the data into a usable
    form to generate the result, that is it helps in extracting useful information
    from raw data by generalizing the unknown facts. Fig. 4 Basic architecture of
    artificial neural network (ANN) Full size image Fig. 5 Single-layer perceptron
    Full size image For every input \\({x}_{i,}\\) the corresponding weight value
    \\({w}_{i}\\) is multiplied indicating the strength of the connection. The one
    with a higher influence on the output value is triggered. $$\\sum =\\left({x}_{1}\\times
    {w}_{1}\\right)+\\left({x}_{2}\\times {w}_{2}\\right)+\\dots \\left({x}_{n}\\times
    {w}_{n}\\right)$$ (4) where, \\(x=[{x}_{1},{x}_{2},{x}_{3}\\dots {x}_{n}]\\) and
    \\(w=[{w}_{1},{w}_{2},{w}_{3}\\dots {w}_{n}]\\) are the row vectors belonging
    to input and the weights respectively. Therefore, the dot product is given by:
    $$x \\cdot w = \\left( {x_{1} \\times w_{1} } \\right) + \\left( {x_{2} \\times
    w_{2} } \\right) + \\ldots \\left( {x_{n} \\times w_{n} } \\right)$$ (5) $$\\sum
    = x\\cdot w$$ (6) Bias acts as an offset for the activation function and produces
    the output value. $$z=x\\cdot w+b$$ (7) This intermediate value generated is passed
    to a non-linear activation function which governs the learning speed of the network.
    There exists a multitude of activation functions, depending upon the problem.
    One of the simplest ones is the sigmoid activation function, \\(\\hat{y}\\) gives
    the predicted value and \\(\\sigma\\) is the activation function, and it is computed
    as, $$\\hat{y}={\\upsigma }\\left(\\text{z}\\right)=\\frac{1}{1+{e}^{-z}}$$ (8)
    The training mechanism includes back-propagating the error by computing the gradient
    values with respect to the weight. The mean square error is calculated by the
    difference between the actual values (\\(y_{i}\\)) and the predicted values (\\({\\hat{y}}_{i}\\))
    of error, $${MSI}_{i}={({y}_{i}-{\\hat{y}}_{i})}^{2}$$ (9) The cumulative error
    for the entire training set is termed as loss function, which is calculated as,
    $$MSE= \\frac{1}{n}\\sum _{i=1}^{n}{({y}_{i}-{\\hat{y}}_{i})}^{2}$$ (10) Later,
    the weights can be optimized and hyper-parameters such as the minimum error, number
    of epochs, and learning rates can be fixed. A training: validation: testing ratio
    of 70:15:15 is used to measure the prediction accuracy of the ANN model. Results
    and discussions Variability in the measured leaf nitrogen concentration (LNC)
    The LNC is one of the major indicators used to describe the leaf nitrogen status
    in different crops. Figure 6a shows the variation in LNC at different levels of
    nitrogen and water stresses. Figures 6b, c are the maps showing the nitrogen stress
    levels and LNC. As an observation, for every irrigation level, the LNC shows an
    increasing trend with a decrease in nitrogen stress. The average value of LNC
    corresponding to N0 is 4.30% and for N4 treatment is 5.28%. The LNC ranges from
    4.19 to 5.12% in I1, 4.22 to 5.48% in I2, and 4.48 to 5.24% in I3 irrigation treatments.
    No significant change was observed with varying levels of irrigation. A similar
    trend is detected for the wheat plant in the case of LNC at different water and
    nitrogen stresses for the tillering stage (Ranjan et al., 2012). At the recommended
    value of 150 kgha−1 (N3), the LNC shows a maximum value of 4.90% in I1 and 4.69%
    in I2. When it comes to zero where no N application was done, the LNC varies between
    4.19% in I1 to 4.48% in I3. The variation in irrigation levels affects more on
    plant nitrogen accumulation (PNA) than LNC (Ranjan et al., 2012). The overall
    results of LNC indicate that the different N stress levels play an important role
    in the N status in the leaves of wheat plants. Fig. 6 a LNC variation at different
    levels of nitrogen and water stresses; b graded N levels; and c measured leaf
    nitrogen Full size image Optimal indices for leaf N prediction The pre-processed
    hyperspectral imagery of the wheat plots is shown in Fig. 7a. The wheat canopy
    area of the study site was successfully segmented using a combined approach of
    hNDVI threshold and SAM binary masks as expounded in the previous section. The
    crop area of 45 wheat plots is shown in Fig. 7b. These data were used for generating
    61 vegetation indices for analyzing the plant N status using LNC. Fig. 7 a UAV
    hyperspectral imagery of the experimental plot; b masked vegetation Full size
    image All the indices summarized in Table 2 are sensitive to plant N and hold
    significance for predicting the LNC using the feature importance score. A large
    number of vegetation indices were used to explore the potential of optimizing
    feature variables combined with machine learning models for predicting N content.
    The graph showing the feature importance scores for all 61 vegetation indices
    derived from R2 and VIP is shown in Fig. 8. The feature importance scores of R2
    and VIP help in ranking the 61 indices for selecting the best ones. The GMI1 performed
    the best with an R2 score of 0.81 while the NPQI performed the least with a R2
    score of 0.01. In the case of VIP, the best index is MSAVI with a performance
    score of 0.72 and the lowest performance was shown by BNI. Fig. 8 Variable importance
    ranking for vegetation indices derived from R2 and VIP Full size image The selection
    of important spectral variables for calculating VIF scores was done based on threshold
    criteria, R2 > 0.7, and VIP > 0.5. On applying these thresholds, 39 and 15 indices
    were generated from R2 and VIP respectively. Then the VIF technique was applied
    to these two sets of data for generating the optimal indices. The VIF generates
    15 and 13 indices each from these two sets, out of which 13 were found to be common
    and they were selected as the most suitable indices for N prediction. The GI and
    TVI were excluded from the final list of suitable indices since they were only
    obtained from the VIP calculation. The VIF score of the 13 suitable indices is
    shown in Fig. 9. Fig. 9 Graph showing the VIF scores obtained for selected indices
    Full size image Among the selected 61 indices, 13 indices showing the best correlation
    with measured leaf N are taken for Leaf N prediction. They are NDCI, GMI2, RI_half,
    PSSRa, SR_900, RI_1db, SR705, Ctr1, RI_3db, RVI3, GMI1, ZM, and MSAVI. The selected
    indices belong to Red-edge spectral region (0.7 and 0.8 µm) which is found sensitive
    toward LNC (Raj, 2021). The spectral regions 350–710 nm and 740–1100 nm are equivalently
    considered highly sensitive to LNC at different N stresses (Ranjan et al., 2012).
    In literature, the N deficiency in corn canopies was successfully derived by an
    increase in red reflectance and a decrease in NIR reflectance (Walburg et al.,
    1981). The red (671 nm), NIR (780 nm) and the spectral region between 550 and
    710 nm are relatively sensitive to plant N levels(Stone et al., 1996; Zhao et
    al., 2005). Since the visible bands are strong absorbents of chlorophyll especially
    in red and blue regions (Hansen & Schjoerring 2003; Pablo J. Zarco-Tejada et al.,
    2001), the optimal indices generated from the present study contain bands from
    visible and red-edge regions thus proving the ability to evaluate crop growth
    and N status. The vegetation indices developed by selecting spectral bands from
    visible regions show strong absorption by chlorophyll and hence it proved to be
    very useful in predicting the nitrogen status in plants (Ranjan et al., 2012).
    The indices such as Ctr1, GMI-1, GMI-2, NDCI, SR705, ZM and PSSRa are used for
    examining the Chlorophyll content in plants (Broge & Leblanc 2001; Gitelson &
    Merzlyak 1994). The RVI3 indicates the leaf nitrogen accumulation (Zhu et al.,
    2008). Further, MSAVI, RI-1dB, RI-3db, and RI-half are used for analyzing the
    vegetation sensitivity of plants. And finally, the indices such as SR_900 are
    used for measuring above-ground green biomass (Rouse et al., 1974). The N along
    with other macro-nutrients such as phosphorous (P) from soil are significant in
    the synthesis of chlorophyll during photosynthesis (Fredeen et al., 1990). So,
    N is one of the major constituents of chlorophyll which is closely associated
    with leaf color, crop yield, and growth (Fageria et al., 2010). Thus it is demonstrated
    that the optimal indices selected from the present study show a strong relationship
    with the leaf N content in plants. Figure 10 and 11 show the maps of optimal vegetation
    indices and Table 3 summarizes the characteristics by which the suitable indices
    are influenced. The maximum and minimum values corresponding to each index are
    specifically seen in plots with N4 and N0 treatments. The R2 score of these 13
    indices ranges from 0.66 to 0.81, which implies that their index values are best
    correlated with LNC. The highest VIF score was shown by both ZM and RI_half while
    the least score was shown by NDCI. Fig. 10 Vegetative Indices generated using

    characteristics Full size table Leaf nitrogen prediction ANN architecture with
    13 input, 10 hidden neurons, and an output node has been constructed to train
    the network for the prediction of N content. The training: validation: testing
    ratio is 70:15:15 with an R-square value of 0.97, 0.84, and 0.86 respectively.
    The regression plots shown in Fig. 12 illustrate the network output plotted versus
    the targets as open circles. The best linear fit is indicated by a dashed line
    and the solid line represents the perfect fit. Fig. 12 Regression plots for N
    prediction using ANN Full size image Further, the best validation performance
    is obtained at 0.067 mean square error (MSE) at 5 epochs. The result seems reasonable
    as the test set error and the validation set error have similar characteristics
    therefore any significant overfitting has not occurred [Refer to Fig. 13a]. The
    error histogram is plotted between the observed and predicted N values, after
    training the neural network, where the y-axis represents the number of samples
    in a particular bin, as shown in Fig. 13b. From Fig. 13c, the final value of the
    gradient coefficient at epoch number 11 is 0.0114 approximated with minimum error,
    also the gradient value keeps on decreasing with increasing the epoch. Fig. 13
    Performance evaluation using ANN for N prediction. a Best validation performance,
    b error histogram, c training set histogram Full size image The N-predicted map
    generated using the ANN is shown in Fig. 14. The predicted LNC ranges from 2.53
    to 6.51%. The current approach of N prediction significantly reduces the salt
    and pepper noise pertaining to the raw image. The noise is still observed in the
    overlapping regions due to the averaging of pixel values during ortho-mosaicking.
    Also, less salt and pepper noise and misclassification were reported for random
    forest (RF) (Wang et al., 2021) and deep convolutional neural network (CNN) classification
    (Zhong et al., 2020)of UAV data. This method presented is an alternate approach
    for the UAV-based imaging spectroscopy for predicting wheat leaf nitrogen using
    spectral modelling technique (Sahoo et al., 2023). Fig. 14 Leaf N prediction using
    ANN. a Measured LNC; b Predicted LNC Full size image Conclusion Leaf N assessment
    for the winter wheat crop concerning different nitrogen levels was successfully
    evaluated for the considered experimental field. A UAV-based hyperspectral push-broom
    scanner system seems to be capable of acquiring high-resolution spatial and spectral
    data for N studies in precision farming. However, the side overlap regions after
    mosaicking the scanlines is still an area of concern but later be tackled for
    the prediction of N values. The hyperspectral imagery of ultra-high spatial resolution
    was captured over the experimental wheat fields under varying irrigation and nitrogen
    treatments. After pre-processing and removal of spectral noises, the crop area
    is extracted for prediction of N values to avoid the intervening effect of other
    features such as impervious areas, soil, etc. Abrupt increase or decrease in reflectance
    values has been observed in the overlapping areas in multiple scan lines to generate
    the mosaiced image, which is decreased using ANN as a prediction model. About
    61 vegetative indices have been computed, out of which 13 most suitable indices
    were extracted using a combined approach of R-Square and VIP followed by the VIF
    technique. These optimal indices were used in the ANN model for the prediction
    of leaf N values for the entire field. The prediction model shows an R-square
    value of 0.97, 0.84, and 0.86 for training, validation, and testing respectively,
    suggesting high prediction accuracy. The generated N map seems to be similar to
    the ground-truth values of N produced for every plot making the proposed approach
    viable for the same. The approach seems to be fast, accurate, and suitable for
    N prediction, further, it may be upscaled for the farmer’s field level with the
    availability of field data. The generated spatial map may be used by a sprayer
    drone for site-specific nitrogen application to promote sustainability and economical
    use. A similar technique may be deployed for other crop-related parameters, such
    as chlorophyll and leaf area index (LAI), etc. as well. References Adak, S., Bandyopadhyay,

    in representing the temporal dynamics of irrigated area Plain Language Summary
    Understanding how much land is irrigated (Irrigated Area or IA) is crucial for
    accurate water use and crop modeling. Traditional IA maps are developed using
    data from the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) and remote sensing indices.
    Recent improvements, like machine learning, have enhanced IA mapping. However,
    the relative performances of these methods and their reliability in capturing
    long-term changes in irrigated areas remain unknown. This study collects government-censored
    county-level IA data from 2000 to 2021, which is subsequently used for evaluating
    commonly used IA data sets. Results show that data sets directly using FAO data
    can reasonability capture the spatial distribution of IA but may miss year-to-year
    changes. On the other hand, data sets relying only on vegetation data tend to
    overestimate irrigated areas in humid regions. The latest machine learning-based
    IA data sets are relatively more accurate but still contain significant uncertainties
    in IA trends. These biases are closely linked to agricultural suitability (calculated
    using precipitation and potential evapotranspiration), which may be useful for
    enhancing future IA mapping algorithms. 1 Introduction Irrigated agriculture contributes
    approximately 40% to global crop production, which is of paramount importance
    for global food security (Foley et al., 2011; Puy et al., 2021; Siebert et al.,
    2010) and alleviating regional poverty (Fischer et al., 2022; Hussain & Hanjra,
    2004). However, irrigation also accounts for more than 70% of global freshwater
    withdrawal, which significantly depletes local freshwater resources (McDermid
    et al., 2023; Wu et al., 2022). Therefore, from the perspectives of food security
    and water management, irrigation modeling is crucial for understanding regional
    sustainability—particularly under a changing climate (Devanand et al., 2019; Jha
    et al., 2022; Tian et al., 2023; Wada et al., 2013). In such modelling, irrigation
    is typically estimated as the additional freshwater required to support crop growth
    (Felfelani et al., 2018). For a given irrigated pixel, the temporal propagation
    of soil moisture is first estimated. Once soil moisture drops below a given threshold,
    irrigation is applied to remove crop water stresses (Leng et al., 2017). These
    approaches typically require an ancillary irrigated area (IA) map to indicate
    the locations being irrigated. Therefore, the reliability of ancillary IA maps
    determines the performance of large-scale irrigation modeling (Leng et al., 2017;
    Puy et al., 2021; Zaussinger et al., 2019). Global IA can be mapped using government
    censored data (GCD) (Siebert et al., 2013b), and GCD-based products are widely
    applied for large-scale irrigation modeling (Huang et al., 2018; Jha et al., 2022;
    Meier et al., 2018; Portmann et al., 2010; K. Zhang et al., 2022). Although GCD-based
    gridded IA data sets are usually reliable, collecting and processing GCD data
    are often prohibitively laborious. Therefore, IA data sets are typically based
    on GCD information from a particular year in the recent past and can become easily
    outdated (Ozdogan & Gutman, 2008). As a result, publicly available GCD maps may
    contain substantial uncertainties in regions with strong interannual IA variability.
    Global IA maps can also be produced using remotely sensed (RS) vegetation indices
    (Meier et al., 2018; Siddiqui et al., 2016). Such approaches assume that vegetation
    dynamics in the irrigated areas are significantly different from that of neighboring
    rainfed croplands (Xie & Lark, 2021). As such, RS vegetation indices (e.g., normalized
    difference vegetation index, or NDVI) are widely used to derive the spatial distribution
    of IA using unsupervised classification methods (Thenkabail et al., 2009). However,
    vegetation dynamics in the irrigated and rainfed fields can be very similar over
    humid areas, which may cause false positives in IA estimates (Ozdogan et al.,
    2010). In addition, the accuracy of IA classification based on RS vegetation indices
    is complicated by the uncertainties of the RS retrievals (Ozdogan et al., 2010).
    To mitigate these issues, supervised machine-learning approaches have been proposed
    (Ketchum et al., 2020). Based on verified data pairs, the nonlinear relationship
    between vegetation/climate variables and IA can be captured using supervised machine
    learning algorithms. Relative to the original unsupervised classification methods,
    supervised machine-learning-based IA classification is strongly constrained by
    observed IA data, which is theoretically advantageous. However, these approaches
    are sensitive to the quality of training data sets, the choice of input ancillary
    variables, and the machine learning algorithms themselves (Xie et al., 2021).
    Recently, new sampling algorithms have been developed to enhance the reliability
    of selected irrigation pixels, which significantly benefits the machine learning
    based IA mapping (Deines et al., 2019; Xie et al., 2019; Xie & Lark, 2021). As
    a result, IA maps derived from different categories of approaches are sensitive
    to different error sources and exhibit relatively high inter-product variability
    (Chen et al., 2018; Ozdogan & Gutman, 2008). Although IA data sets have been extensively
    evaluated in previous studies (Meier et al., 2018; Ozdogan et al., 2010), the
    relative performances of different IA mapping methods remain unknown. In particular,
    IA can exhibit significant temporal variabilities and trends, due to local agricultural
    policy changes. However, the reliability of different IA data sets in capturing
    the IA temporal variability is rarely explored. These concerns may undermine the
    reliability of long-term irrigation modeling and large-scale water/food sustainability
    analyses. In response, this study investigates the performances of the state-of-the-art
    IA data sets derived from GCD interpolation, unsupervised classification, and
    supervised machine learning approaches. Specifically, we collect 1861 county-level
    cross-validated GCD data from 2000 to 2021 to evaluate IA data sets derived from
    different categories of approaches. In addition to spatial IA distributions, we
    also focus on the reliability of different data sets in mapping IA temporal variability.
    Finally, we investigate the main sources of IA mapping biases, and explore potential
    methods for IA bias correction. 2 Data and Methods IA data sets derived from different
    categories of methods over the Chinese mainland are considered for comparison
    and evaluation (Table 1). In total, we consider six commonly used IA data sets,
    including the Global Map of Irrigated Area version 5.0 (GMIA), Global Irrigated
    Areas (GIA), Monthly Irrigated and Rainfed Crop Areas (MIRCA), International Water
    Management Institute (IWMI), Irrigated Croplands in China (ICC), and Irrigated

    definitions, statistics of “area equipped for irrigation\" are used for GCD-based
    IA. Finally, NDVI (MOD13A2 data set), precipitation (P) (Peng, 2020), potential
    evapotranspiration (PET) (Peng, 2022), aridity index (AI) (Yu, 2021), and Land
    Cover of China (Ran, 2013) data are also included to investigate differences between
    publicly available and GCD-based IA data sets. 2.1 The GCD-Based Reference IA
    Maps The GCD-based annual IA maps for the period 2000 to 2021 are used as a reference
    to evaluate the performance of other publicly available IA data sets. Our analysis
    is primarily based on the National Bureau of Statistics of China (NBS) data, which
    is available at the county level. We acknowledge that NBS-based GCD data may also
    contain uncertainties and biases. Therefore, IA maps from the other two additional
    sources are also used for comparison, including Rural Socioeconomic Investigation
    Department (RSID) and Ministry of Water Resources (MWR). Although RSID and MWR
    are only accessible at the province level, the intercomparison of NBS, RSID, and
    MWR provides the general reliability of the GCD-based IA. 2.2 The Large-Scale
    Gridded IA Data Sets Here, six commonly used data sets based on different categories
    of IA mapping methods are considered for comparison (see Table 1). To start, the
    commonly used Global Map of Irrigated Area version 5.0 (GMIA) product is considered
    (Siebert et al., 2013b). This data set is produced by interpolating FAO GCD data
    with land cover data sets and national unit boundaries. GMIA data is widely used
    for validating large-scale RS-based IA data products. The Global Irrigated Areas
    (GIA) product is an enhanced version of GMIA. Specifically, GIA enhances GMIA
    by further considering regional NDVI, agricultural suitability, and potential
    multiple cropping (Meier et al., 2018). Likewise, the Monthly Irrigated and Rainfed
    Crop Areas (MIRCA) are produced by including information on harvested crop area,
    cropland extent, and area equipped for irrigation from GMIA. However, relative
    to GIA, the key difference is that MIRCA constrains the total cultivating areas
    of all irrigated crops using GMIA (Portmann et al., 2010). In contrast to the
    abovementioned products, the International Water Management Institute (IWMI) data
    set uses unsupervised classification algorithms and NDVI time series to map IA
    (Siddiqui et al., 2016). Specifically, it assumes that irrigated and rainfed areas
    have contrasting vegetation temporal dynamics—as captured by NDVI—and applies
    this principle for IA mapping. Recently, the Irrigated Cropland in China (ICC)
    product was proposed by C. Zhang et al. (2022d). It is based on a synergistic
    mapping method using spatial information derived from vegetation indices of RS
    and the IA values of GCD. Finally, the Irrigated Cropland Maps across China (Irr_CN)
    data set is a machine learning (i.e., random forest algorithm) based IA data set
    (C. Zhang et al., 2022b). In contrast to other methods, this map introduces the
    supervised classification algorithms to develop a spatiotemporal continuous data
    set based on the pre-selected training samples form ICC, and the IA estimates
    are also constrained using vegetation indices and agricultural suitability data.
    As shown in Table 1, the spatial resolution of these IA data sets varies significantly.
    Therefore, all IA data sets are aggregated/resampled onto a common county-level
    map and converted into the percentage of irrigated area for each county. Note
    that such county-level comparisons may affect the performances of low-resolution
    data sets. Therefore, we also repeat our analysis by resampling all the IA data
    sets onto 25-km spatial grids, which yields qualitatively consistent findings
    with the county-level evaluations. 2.3 Evaluation Metrics To start, the biases
    of different IA data sets are evaluated as: (1) where IAi and Bi are the IA value
    and the associated biases of product i; IANBS is the irrigated area data from
    NBS. In addition to bias, the reliability of each data set in capturing the long-term
    county-level IA trend is also investigated based on linear regression. The IA
    trends are set to zero for data sets that only provide a single IA distribution
    map. Otherwise, IA trends are calculated using IA estimates for all available
    years. 3 Results 3.1 Cross Validation of GCD-Based IA Data As noted above, this
    study aims to quantify the effectiveness of large-scale IA products for capturing
    temporal and spatial IA variations. As mentioned above, only NBS provides county-level
    IA information, which is better suited for evaluating the grided IA data sets.
    However, NBS is not error free and hence, we evaluate the reliability of NBS using
    two other independent GCD data sets (see Section 2), which are available at provincial
    level. Such cross-validation is unavailable at county level due to data limitations.
    Nonetheless, it still can evaluate the overall provincial-level IA reliability
    produced by NBS GCD data. Figures 1a–1c presents the temporal correlation coefficient
    (CC) of the three GCD IA data sets, sampled during the period from 2000 to 2020.
    On average, the temporal correlation of NBS and RSID for different provinces is
    above 0.98 (−) (Figure 1b). Relative to the correlation between NBS versus RSID,
    the temporal correlation between NBS and MWR is slightly lower, which is particularly
    notable over Qinghai, Hebei, Liaoning, and Guangdong provinces—see the light-color
    shaded areas in Figure 1a. Interestingly, a similar correlation reduction is also
    found in the RSID and MWR comparisons (Figure 1c). This is because RSID abruptly
    increased IA in the year 2007, which is not supported by the other GCD data sets.
    Therefore, the (slight) discrepancy between NBS and RSID is likely attributable
    to IA errors in the RSID data. Figure 1 Open in figure viewer PowerPoint The temporal
    correlation between NBS, MWR, and RSID reported IA data—see parts (a) to (c),
    respectively. Sampled correlations are based on province-level IA data sampled
    between 2000 and 2020. In addition to the temporal consistency, Figure 2 further
    examines the spatial consistency of the NBS, RSID, and MWR reported IA for each
    province. The temporal mean of these three data sets is highly consistent, with
    a relative difference lower than 0.05%. Figure 2 Open in figure viewer PowerPoint
    Comparison of province-level NBS-, MWR-, and RSID-reported IA fractions. Each
    plotted symbol denotes the temporal mean IA for a particular province. As noted
    above, the three data sets are independently surveyed by different governmental
    departments. Although there may still be some modest level of IA error interdependence,
    the consistency of the GCD data sets confirms the general reliability of the reported
    IA values. Given that NBS is available at the county level, we mainly use this
    data set to evaluate the performance of the large-scale gridded IA maps. 3.2 Spatial
    Distributions of IA Figure 3 displays the spatial distribution of county-level
    IA in China based on NBS during the period from 2000 to 2021. The top and right
    panels of Figure 3 show the meridional and zonal means of IA variations. The results
    indicate that there are significant spatial variations in the distribution of
    IA across China. Approximately 37% of China''s IA is located in the North China
    Plain (NCP, 32ºN ∼ 40ºN, 114ºE ∼ 121ºE) (C. Zhang et al., 2022e). This is not
    surprising since the NCP is one of the food bowls of the country, and the precipitation
    water supply there is far less than the crop water demand (Fang et al., 2010).
    As a result, the NCP is also one of the global hot spots of irrigation and concerns
    surrounding possible freshwater depletion (Kang & Eltahir, 2018; Koch et al.,
    2020). Figure 3 Open in figure viewer PowerPoint The spatial distribution of NBS-based
    county-level temporal mean IA fractions sampled during the period from 2000 to
    2021 (a). The meridional and zonal mean IA fractions are shown in parts (b) and
    (c), respectively. In addition to the NCP, there are also scattered irrigation-intensive
    regions in the semiarid agricultural regions, for example, the middle of Inner
    Mongolia (40ºN ∼ 42ºN, 105ºE ∼ 115ºE) and parts of Xinjiang (38ºN ∼ 49ºN, 76ºE
    ∼ 92ºE). In these areas of southeast China, the percentage of IA is usually less
    than 15% per county—since the annual precipitation over these regions is typically
    high and irrigation is often unnecessary (Luo et al., 2022). Figure 4 presents
    the spatial distribution of IA fractions estimated by different gridded IA products.
    As expected, GMIA and ICC accurately reflect the spatial variations of IA, since
    they primarily rely on GCD. The bias of GMIA also highlights the influence of
    vegetation cover heterogeneity, such as the mixing of crops and vegetation, in
    regions like the Songnen Plain (45 ºN ∼48 ºN, 130 ºE ∼ 135 ºE) and the central
    part of China (33 ºN ∼34 ºN, 114 ºE ∼ 117 ºE) (Figure A1). In addition, GIA and
    MIRCA, both constrained by GMIA, exhibit contrasting spatial distributions of
    IA biases, as shown in Figures A1b and A1c, respectively. Figure 4 Open in figure
    viewer PowerPoint The spatial distribution of IA fractions estimated by (a) GMIA,
    (b) GIA, (c) MIRCA, (d) IWMI, (e) ICC, and (f) Irr_CN. The box plots in part (g)
    show the statistical distribution of IA fractions sampled across China. The horizontal
    blue lines and shadings are the spatial means and inter-quantile ranges of the
    NBS IA fractions, respectively. In contrast, products that are not strongly constrained
    by GCD generally overestimate IA (e.g., IWMI and Irr_CN). This bias can range
    from 3.45% to 10.55% relative to NBS-reported values (Figures A1d and A1f). These
    biases are particularly pronounced in humid regions of southeast China and areas
    with complex land covers in northeast China (Figures A1, 4 and A1d). This tendency
    is further confirmed by Figure 6, which shows that the bias of these IA data sets
    strongly increases with increased climate humidity. In addition, the heterogeneity
    of vegetation cover (e.g., a mixture of lichen, weeds, or crops in northeast China)
    also appears to be a key factor affecting the IA mapping accuracy (Dang et al.,
    2022; Meier et al., 2018). In addition, Figure 4g also shows the benefit of including
    GCD information. However, collecting and processing GCD data is prohibitively
    laborious. In addition, GCD data is not available at the pixel level. Therefore,
    algorithms that can optimally extend GCD data using remote sensing information
    are still required. Figure 5 Open in figure viewer PowerPoint The NDVI and precipitation
    climatology of irrigated (a) and (d), and non-irrigation (b) and (e) pixels. The
    top and bottom rows are sampled from the relatively arid north and humid south
    parts of China, respectively. The geolocations of the selected pixels are shown
    parts in (c) and (f), respectively. As demonstrated in a previous analysis, vegetation
    dynamics over irrigated and rainfed croplands can be highly similar over humid
    areas (Ozdogan et al., 2010), which is also confirmed in Figure 5. For instance,
    in the arid north part of China, the peak NDVI value is 1.3 times higher than
    that of non-irrigated croplands (Figures 6a–6c). In contrast, the growing season
    NDVI of the irrigated and no-irrigated areas are highly similar over the humid
    southern part of China (Figures 6d–6f, and Figure A2). Therefore, in these areas,
    it can be challenging to distinguish irrigated and non-irrigated areas using vegetation
    indices, which may lead to overestimated IA. Figure 6 Open in figure viewer PowerPoint
    The relative bias of IA as a function of the aridity index (calculated as the
    ratio of precipitation and potential evapotranspiration, which increases with
    climate humidity). The performance of the GMIA, GIA, MIRCA, IWMI, ICC, and Irr_CN
    data sets is shown in parts (a) to (f), respectively. The IA bias is shown as
    a function of the aridity index (AI) in Figure 6. It should be noted that vegetation
    density (or NDVI) generally increases with increased aridity index. Therefore,
    data sets that highly rely on vegetation dynamics tend to produce enhanced IA
    biases in humid regions, for example, IWMI and ICC (Figures 6d and 6e). 3.3 Temporal
    IA Trends in China In addition to the spatial variability, IA may also present
    strong temporal trends in response to local agricultural management policies and
    climate change. Figure 7 presents the county-level IA trends over the period 2000
    to 2021. Figure 7 Open in figure viewer PowerPoint The spatial distribution of
    NBS-based county-level IA trends during 2000–2021 (a). The meridional and zonal
    means of the NBS IA trends are shown on the top (b), and right (c) panels, respectively.
    China presents an overall increasing IA trend during the past two decades, as
    the meridional and zonal means of the IA trends are both positive (Figures 7b
    and 7c). The increasing IA trend is most evident over the Northeast Plain (40ºN
    ∼ 48ºN, 118ºE ∼ 128ºE) and southeast China (Figure 7). The strongly increased
    IA over the Northeast Plain is consistent with recently developed large-scale
    irrigation facilities within this region, as reported by the Heilongjiang Provincial
    Department of Water Resources. There are also scattered regions with temporally
    decreased IA (i.e., Beijing and Tianjin with a mean trend of −0.40%/yr). Figure
    8 shows the temporal IA trend of each product. The temporal IA trends of GMIA,
    GIA, and MIRCA products are assigned to be zero since they only provide a single
    year IA map. The number of maps used for IA trend calculation for the product
    is shown in Figure 8g. Figure 8 Open in figure viewer PowerPoint The spatial distribution
    of IA trends estimated by (a) GMIA, (b) GIA, (c) MIRCA, (d) IWMI, (e) ICC, and
    (f) Irr_CN. For each product, the IA trends are calculated based on all available
    annual IA maps from 2000 to 2021. The number of available IA estimates for each
    product during 2000–2021 is shown in (g). Although FAO-constrained products can
    reproduce the spatial distribution of IA (e.g., GMIA and GIA), they fail to capture
    the temporal IA trends (Figures 8a and 8b). On the other hand, remotely sensed
    and machine learning based data sets can provide IA temporal dynamics. However,
    these products generally predict much stronger temporal negative and positive
    IA trends than NBS-based IA. For instance, the mean IA trend predicted by the
    IWMI product is −0.07%/yr, which is lower than the NBS trend of 0.13%/yr. In addition,
    these products also fail to capture the spatial pattern of IA trends. For instance,
    while NBS data indicates an increase in IA in central China (e.g., Henan, Anhui,
    and Shanxi Provinces, Figure 7a) with a mean IA trend of 0.36%/yr, IWMI shows
    substantially reduced IA trends (−0.48%/yr) over a significant portion of central
    China. It is evident that even the latest machine-learning based Irr_CN data set
    cannot accurately capture the IA trends. This is likely because Irr_CN is trained
    using pixels that were constantly irrigated during 2000–2019. Hence, this training
    data set contains little IA temporal variability information, which may degrade
    the ability of Irr_CN to capture IA trends. Therefore, sampling algorithms that
    consider both the spatial and temporal variations of IA should be used for selecting
    training data in machine learning. Although a number of the examined gridded products
    can reasonably estimate the spatial distribution of IA (see Figure 8), they also
    contain substantial uncertainties with regard to IA temporal trends. This can
    negatively affect the reliability of large-scale irrigation modeling—particularly
    in cases where IA data are extrapolated from prior years. This possibility is
    first demonstrated in Figure 9 using the GMIA data set. Note that the county-level
    NBS IA data may contain spatial gaps for a particular year. Therefore, we directly
    investigate the IA error temporal variations using provincial averages. Figure
    9 Open in figure viewer PowerPoint The spatial distribution of province-level
    IA error of GMIA and Irr_CN as evaluated using NBS IA data. The error statistics
    sampled between 2005 and 2019 are shown in the left and right panels, respectively.
    As mentioned above, GMIA is derived using 2005 GCD-based (FAO) IA information,
    and its 2005 error is generally between −3.14% and 8.59%. We further calculate
    the GMIA error in 2019 to illustrate the impact of using outdated GCD data (Figure
    9b). Relative to 2005, Figure 9b shows that NBS are increased over 27 out of 34
    provinces. The enhanced IA fraction error is particularly noticeable over regions
    with strong IA trends, for example, Xinjiang and Northeastern China. On average,
    the spatial mean error of GMIA estimated IA fractions increased from 0.32% in
    2005 to −1.54% in 2019. Likewise, the error statistics of Irr_CN are also used
    for comparison. The error of Irr_CN in 2005 has a spatial average of 3.24%. As
    shown in Figure 9, Irr_CN significantly overestimates the absolute IA trends.
    Therefore, relative to 2005, the IA spatial distributions of IA errors in 2019
    are mitigated over the northern part of China. This is because the Irr_CN strong
    positive IA trend tends to compensate for its negative IA biases in 2005. However,
    the incorrect Irr_CN IA trends can also enhance its IA biases, which are noticeable
    over the southeast coast. Note that Irr_CN is trained using land pixels that have
    been consistently dominated by rainfed/irrigated agriculture (C. Zhang et al.,
    2022b). This may be less effective in capturing long-term IA statistics. As a
    result, the IA errors tend to increase with time. If not adequately corrected,
    such IA errors will also propagate into irrigation modeling. Figure 10 shows that
    the biases of Irr_CN are strongly correlated with AS. Therefore, based on Irr_CN,
    it is feasible to produce a bias-corrected IA data set via linear regression (Figure
    10a). The corrected Irr_CN data set has negligible errors in IA spatial distribution
    (Figure 10c) and more realistic IA temporal variations (Figures 10b and 10d).
    These results suggest that including AS may benefit future machine learning based
    IA mapping algorithms. Figure 10 Open in figure viewer PowerPoint The spatial
    distribution bias-corrected Irr_CN using AS (a) and the associated IA temporal
    trends (b). The error distributions of bias-corrected Irr_CN is shown in part
    (c). The temporal variations of IA (averaged across China) estimated by the original
    and bias-corrected Irr_CN and NBS data are shown in part (d). 4 Discussion and
    Conclusions Irrigation significantly affects regional hydrological processes and
    local climate via land-atmosphere coupling. However, irrigation modeling is a
    known challenge, and a key source of modeling error is the uncertainty of ancillary
    data describing irrigated area (IA). Global gridded IA maps have been developed
    mostly based on GCD and RS retrievals. However, their performances in terms of
    spatial distribution and temporal statistics remain unknown. Therefore, we evaluate
    the commonly used large-scale gridded IA data sets using the NBS-based data set
    that contains 1861 county-level government censored IA data during 2000–2021.
    We find that IA products constrained by vegetation indices information tend to
    exhibit unrealistic spatial distributions of IA in humid regions or areas with
    highly heterogeneous vegetation covers. This is likely due to the known problem
    that irrigated and rainfed fields lack adequate spatial contrast in vegetation
    dynamics over humid regions and areas with heterogeneous vegetation covers. Given
    that optical sensors may be affected by cloud cover, including radar information
    (e.g., Sentinel-1) may enhance the characterization of land surface conditions,
    which may in turn, improve IA mapping. As a result, data sets based on vegetation
    indices may overestimate IA in regions such as southeast China and northeast China.
    Current IA products also exhibit biases in long-term IA trends, which is likely
    due to reliance on a single outdated IA map or the use of constantly irrigated
    land pixels for algorithm training. These IA biases are tightly correlated with
    agricultural suitability (AS), and hence, AS can be used to develop bias-corrected
    IA data sets. The relative performances of the commonly used data sets suggest
    that including GCD appears necessary to capture the spatial distributions of IA.
    However, raw GCD is only available with temporal discontinuities at county/provincial
    levels and cannot be directly used for pixel-wise irrigation modeling. More importantly,
    updating GCD data is laborious, which involves manually collecting and processing
    thousands of governmental reports. In future work, generating training samples
    based on GCD data and including AS information through machine learning will enhance
    the accuracy of IA maping. Acknowledgments This work is funded by the National

    The Spatial Distribution of IA Errors The spatial distribution of IA errors are
    shown in Figure A1. The errors are typically locate at regions with dense vegetation
    cover, such as northeast China, middle China, and southeast China. For example,
    the Songneng Plain, which is rich in black, has a temperate monsoon climate with
    high temperatures and rainy summers, experiencing hot and rainy weather simultaneously.
    These climatic conditions will promote vegetation growth. Therefore, it will be
    challenging to distinguish between irrigated or rain-fed croplands in such regions
    due to the mixing of crops and vegetation. On the other hand, this result also
    demonstrates that we need better spatial contrast in regions with vegetation dynamics
    or additional information to reduce errors. Figure A1 Open in figure viewer PowerPoint

    level and averaged over the period 2000 to 2021. The auxiliary AS information,
    used for constraining IA biases, is shown in Figure A2. Figure A2 Open in figure

    period. Non-agricultural lands are shaded gray. Appendix B: The Impact of Spatial
    Resolution The previous analyses evaluate the performance of current gridded IA
    data sets. However, the spatial resolution of these data sets varies from 500
    m to 25 km, and the differences in IA observed in Figure 4 may be partly attributable
    to variations in spatial resolution. To investigate the potential impacts of such
    scale mismatches, we aggregate all the products, regardless of their native resolution,
    onto a fixed 25-km spatial grid (Figure B1). Generally, such coarsening of spatial
    resolution has the greatest effect over the southeastern portion of China—compare
    Figures B1, 4 and B1. This is because, if only scattered areas are irrigated within
    a coarse-resolution pixel, IA may be (statistically) near zero after spatial aggregation
    (Ozdogan et al., 2010). Nonetheless, the overall large-scale IA spatial distribution
    and the spatial mean are highly consistent with those shown in Figure 4, suggesting
    that spatial resolution is not a major issue. Figure B1 Open in figure viewer

  description: Artificial manipulation of lake water levels through practices like
    winter water-level drawdown (WD) is prevalent across many regions, but the spatiotemporal
    patterns are not well documented due to limited in situ monitoring. Multi-sensor
    satellite remote sensing provides an opportunity to map and analyze drawdown frequency
    and metrics (timing, magnitude, duration) at broad scales. This study developed
    a cloud computing framework to process time series of synthetic aperture radar
    (Sentinel 1-SAR) and optical sensor (Landsat 8, Sentinel 2) data to characterize
    WD in 166 lakes across Massachusetts, USA, during 2016–2021. Comparisons with
    in situ logger data showed that the Sentinel 1-derived surface water area captured
    relative water-level fluctuations indicative of WD. A machine learning approach
    classified lakes as WD versus non-WD based on seasonal water-level fluctuations
    derived from Sentinel 1-SAR data. The framework mapped WD lakes statewide, revealing
    prevalence throughout Massachusetts with interannual variability. Results showed
    WDs occurred in over 75% of lakes during the study period, with high interannual
    variability in the number of lakes conducting WD. Mean WD magnitude was highest
    in the wettest year (2018) but % lake area exposure did not show any association
    with precipitation and varied between 8% to 12% over the 5-year period. WD start
    date was later and duration was longer in wet years, indicating climate mediation
    of WD implementation driven by management decisions. The data and tools developed
    provide an objective information resource to evaluate ecological impacts and guide
    management of this prevalent but understudied phenomenon. Overall, the results
    and interactive web tool developed as part of this study provide new hydrologic
    intelligence to inform water management and policies related to WD practices.

    Figures Review Reports Versions Notes Abstract Artificial manipulation of lake
    water levels through practices like winter water-level drawdown (WD) is prevalent
    across many regions, but the spatiotemporal patterns are not well documented due
    to limited in situ monitoring. Multi-sensor satellite remote sensing provides
    an opportunity to map and analyze drawdown frequency and metrics (timing, magnitude,
    duration) at broad scales. This study developed a cloud computing framework to
    process time series of synthetic aperture radar (Sentinel 1-SAR) and optical sensor
    (Landsat 8, Sentinel 2) data to characterize WD in 166 lakes across Massachusetts,
    USA, during 2016–2021. Comparisons with in situ logger data showed that the Sentinel
    1-derived surface water area captured relative water-level fluctuations indicative
    of WD. A machine learning approach classified lakes as WD versus non-WD based
    on seasonal water-level fluctuations derived from Sentinel 1-SAR data. The framework
    mapped WD lakes statewide, revealing prevalence throughout Massachusetts with
    interannual variability. Results showed WDs occurred in over 75% of lakes during
    the study period, with high interannual variability in the number of lakes conducting
    WD. Mean WD magnitude was highest in the wettest year (2018) but % lake area exposure
    did not show any association with precipitation and varied between 8% to 12% over
    the 5-year period. WD start date was later and duration was longer in wet years,
    indicating climate mediation of WD implementation driven by management decisions.
    The data and tools developed provide an objective information resource to evaluate
    ecological impacts and guide management of this prevalent but understudied phenomenon.
    Overall, the results and interactive web tool developed as part of this study
    provide new hydrologic intelligence to inform water management and policies related
    to WD practices. Keywords: winter drawdown; lake management; remote sensing; Google
    Earth Engine; lake water area; lake water level 1. Introduction Lake water levels
    fluctuate because of natural climatic–hydrological forcings and artificial manipulation
    [1,2]. In natural lakes, water levels vary based on precipitation, evaporation,
    catchment size and characteristics, and outflow [3,4,5]. Water-level fluctuations
    in managed lakes primarily depend upon timing, magnitude, and rate of water withdrawal
    and refilling processes to meet water budget and human needs, although they are
    mediated by catchment and climate characteristics [6]. As such, short-term (i.e.,
    hourly, daily) and long-term (i.e., seasonal, inter-annual) variability in lake
    water levels may differ significantly between natural lakes and lakes with control
    structures [2,7]. Winter water-level drawdowns (WDs) are an example of artificial
    lake management practices that manipulate water levels. WDs are primarily used
    to reduce invasive macrophytes, provide flood storage, and protect shoreline infrastructure
    from ice damage [2,8,9]. The artificial manipulation of water levels, coupled
    with global climate change, can impact the littoral zone habitat, water quality,
    and overall ecological integrity of lakes [2,10]. While the ecological impacts
    are still debated, WDs provide an important tool for managers to maintain recreational
    access, protect shoreline infrastructure, and combat invasive macrophytes that
    can overwhelm shallow lake habitats [11]. In the northeast United States, WD is
    practiced not only as a matter of lake management but is integral to regional
    environmental stewardship and community well-being [2]. In this region, WDs usually
    start in early autumn when the water levels of lakes are lowered until they reach
    a target level prior to ice cover, and then, the refilling process starts in the
    spring after ice-out [2,11,12]. However, the timing, magnitude, and duration of
    WDs vary among lakes and across years [2], and quantifying such spatiotemporal
    variability in water levels using in situ data alone is impractical for lakes
    in a wide geographic region. A regional analysis of WDs can provide key insights
    into how lake managers are responding to multiple pressures, including climate
    change, invasive species, and shoreline development. Satellite remote sensing
    techniques provide near-real-time, cost-effective, and large-scale monitoring
    capability of water resources [13,14] that can overcome in situ data limitations.
    Satellite altimeters (e.g., Jason satellite series, Sentinel 3 altimeter, Icesat
    satellite series) have been used to derive water levels of lakes [15,16]. However,
    satellite altimeters do not cover all inland lakes (i.e., limited to large lakes)
    and have low revisit frequency (~1 month). Therefore, several studies have used
    either optical or synthetic aperture radar (SAR) data to study spatial variability
    in surface water area extent, which can be used as a surrogate for water level
    [13,17,18,19]. Optical sensors (e.g., Landsat-series satellites) provide long-term
    data archives (last three decades) every 16 days, but cloud-affected images create
    data gaps that may be problematic in continuous monitoring of surface water dynamics.
    Moreover, optical sensors can differentiate various surface water features (aquatic
    vegetation, ice cover, suspended sediments, algae bloom, etc.) using their spectral
    bands [20,21,22]. SAR sensors have the advantage of providing data in almost all
    weather using their longer wavelength (microwave) and facilitate gap-free continuous
    monitoring at their respective temporal resolutions [23,24]. Application of SAR
    data was limited in the past because of a lack of open-access data, time-intensive
    data processing, and the complexity involved in data interpretation by non-expert
    users [25,26,27]; however, recent advances have overcome these challenges. The
    recent advancement in cloud computing platforms such as Google Earth Engine (GEE)
    has enabled quick processing of satellite data without downloading and storing
    the data on local machines [27,28]. GEE is a web-based platform that hosts freely
    available satellite data and provides a JavaScript Application Programming Interface
    (API) as well as a Python API for accessing and processing satellite data on a
    global scale [27]. Global satellite data from the National Aeronautics and Space
    Administration (NASA) (Landsat series: Landsat 8, Landsat 9) and the European
    Union’s Copernicus program (Sentinel series: Sentinel 1, Sentinel 2) are promptly
    made available on the GEE platform within days of acquisition of new scenes. Leveraging
    the cloud storage and cloud computing powers of GEE allow for quick and routine
    monitoring of inland water bodies and, therefore, the mapping of WD lakes across
    a wide geographic region. The objective of this study was to develop a multi-sensor,
    cloud-based framework to characterize WD lakes. We used the computational power
    of the GEE platform to process and analyze the multi-sensor satellite data, including
    data from both optical sensors and SAR sensors. Satellite data were compared to
    in situ water-level data from 21 lakes in Massachusetts (MA), USA, from 2016–2021
    to assess the accuracy of satellite-based characterization of WD lakes among the
    three satellite sensors. The satellite data were used to characterize WD lakes
    > 0.3 km2 across the entire state, resulting in a statewide WD frequency map for
    166 lakes for five years (2016–2021). This study involved calculating various
    WD metrics, such as start date, duration, magnitude, and the area of lakebed exposed.
    We also evaluated WD metrics’ interannual variability in relation to precipitation
    patterns. The web-based tool along with its findings and results from this study
    could aid in decision-making processes regarding WD guidelines, aiming to mitigate
    potential negative impacts associated with WDs. 2. Methods 2.1. Study Area This
    study focused on lakes in Massachusetts, located in the northeastern United States
    (Figure 1). This region experiences a humid continental climate with warm, wet
    summers and cold, snowy winters [29]. Precipitation in the region is generally
    evenly distributed throughout the year except for the wet season, with an annual
    average rainfall of 1016–1270 mm [30]. River flows in the region are typically
    characterized by higher flows during leaf-off periods (~November through April)
    and spring snowmelt and lower flows during summer months [31,32]. Natural lakes
    in Massachusetts fill during the high spring flows and gradually decline during
    the drier summer–fall months as evapotranspiration exceeds precipitation inputs
    [33,34]. Most WD lakes implement drawdowns in the fall by releasing water downstream
    when river flows are lowest. Past research indicates that the timing of these
    drawdowns, which coincide with the region’s seasonal precipitation and temperature
    patterns, can significantly impact physical habitat structure and macrophytes
    in Massachusetts lakes [35]. Figure 1. Study area map showing lakes >0.3 km2 in
    Massachusetts where water-level fluctuations were evaluated. The lakes highlighted
    in orange colors are those with available in situ water-level data; blue dots
    are lakes with satellite data only. The overall methods including data collection,
    processing, and analysis steps involved to achieve the objectives of this study
    are shown in Figure 2. The detailed descriptions of each component are presented
    in the following subsections. Figure 2. Overall study framework including data
    and processing levels to characterize winter drawdown lakes in Massachusetts (MA).

    data; regular rectangles represent processing and analysis; and small circles

    Data Collection and Preprocessing This study utilized two optical sensors (Landsat
    8-Operational Land Imager (LS8-OLI) and Sentinel 2A/B-Multi Spectral Instrument
    (S2-MSI)) and one SAR sensor (Sentinel 1A/B-SAR (S1-SAR)) to generate surface
    water area data (Table 1). To avoid the data download process, we used an online
    image processing platform (Google Earth Engine, GEE) to process and analyze the
    data derived from all three satellite sensors. Table 1. Satellite data sources
    used in this study, with years of data availability, temporal resolution, and
    spatial resolution. Abbreviations: OLI = Operational Land Imager; MSI = MultiSpectral
    Instrument; SAR = synthetic aperture radar; GRD = Ground Range Detected. Top-of-atmosphere
    (TOA) reflectance (RTOA) level-1 data from both optical sensors (LS8-OLI and S2-MSI)
    were used as input for preprocessing within the GEE platform. For the S1-SAR sensor,
    C-band Ground Range Detected (GRD) raw data were already processed using the Sentinel
    1 toolbox to produce calibrated, ortho-corrected scenes before they were made
    available to users on the Google Earth Engine platform. The preprocessing steps
    for optical sensors included cloud masking (for LS8-OLI and S2-MSI), resampling
    pixels to a common spatial resolution (30 m). The preprocessing steps for S1-SAR
    included spatial resampling at 30 m and speckle filtering. Both S2-MSI and S1-SAR
    sensors have multiple spatial resolutions and, therefore, spatial resampling was
    required to have a consistent spatial resolution. We resampled S1-SAR and S2-MSI
    pixels at a 30 m spatial resolution to have consistent comparison with respect
    to the LS8-OLI sensor’s spatial resolution. Cloud masking was performed using
    quality assurance bands available in both optical sensors. The S1-SAR data available
    in GEE have two polarization modes, i.e., VV (vertical transmit/vertical receive)
    and VH (vertical transmit/horizontal receive). We used backscattering coefficients
    (dB) from only VV polarization mode because previous studies have found VV mode
    more suitable for surface water classification than VH mode [36]. SAR sensors
    like the Sentinel 1 emit microwave pulses and measure the intensity of backscattered
    energy returning to the sensor. The strength of the backscatter signal depends
    on surface properties like roughness, moisture content, and structure [37,38].
    For open water bodies like lakes, the smooth surface acts as a specular reflector
    that reflects most of the incident radar pulses away from the sensor, resulting
    in a very low backscatter and dark tone in SAR imagery [39]. In contrast, vegetation,
    urban areas, and bare land have higher surface roughness, leading to diffuse scattering
    of radar pulses in multiple directions, including back to the sensor [40], resulting
    in higher backscatter intensity and brighter tone compared to water. The raw S1-SAR
    data contain speckle noises which may result in misclassification of water area.
    To remove the speckle noises, a 100 m circular buffer was used within the GEE
    platform and pixels within that buffer were averaged. 2.3. Water Area Mask (Otsu
    Method) Following preprocessing, we used an automated surface water classification
    algorithm known as “Otsu” [41] to classify water and non-water regions. The Otsu
    algorithm is an unsupervised method that was originally developed to select a
    threshold for the reduction of a gray-scale image to a binary image containing
    two classes. The Otsu method is a complex, iterative process that selects an optimal
    threshold value separating two classes so that the between-class variance is maximized.
    To implement Otsu thresholding efficiently, we utilized JavaScript code developed
    by Zhou et al. [42] within the GEE platform. The code implements the Otsu method
    in a simplified and efficient way by using the following steps: (a) it converts
    the input image to a gray-scale image and calculates the histogram of pixel values;
    (b) it iterates over all possible threshold values and computes the between-class
    variance for each value; and (c) it selects the threshold value that maximizes
    the between-class variance and returns it as the optimal threshold. The code simplifies
    the original algorithm by avoiding the use of complex mathematical formulas and
    matrix operations. Instead, it leverages the built-in functions of the Google
    Earth Engine platform, such as ee.Image.reduceRegion and ee.Image.select, which
    are optimized for large-scale image processing. The Otsu code by Zhou et al. [42]
    was written for S1-SAR data and, thus, we modified the Otsu code for optical sensors
    (LS8-OLI and S2-MSI) using the short-wave infrared (SWIR) band as input image.
    In the SWIR band, water absorbs the incoming solar light strongly, and a bimodal
    histogram is observed. In addition, the SWIR band is also less affected by turbid
    water and atmospheric noise compared to the near-infrared (NIR) band used in initial
    studies for surface water area classification. We used the optimal threshold computed
    by the Otsu method in a conditional expression to classify water areas below that
    optimal threshold value. The surface water area was derived by counting the number
    of water pixels and multiplying that value to each pixel area (30 m × 30 m = 0.0009
    km2). 2.4. Time-Series Analysis and Accuracy Assessment To differentiate WD and
    non-drawdown lakes, we extracted surface water area time-series (2016–2021) data
    from both optical and SAR sensors. We selected 2016–2021 for data extraction because
    data from both optical and SAR sensors were available during this period, allowing
    us to compare the time-series results from all three sensors (LS8-OLI, S2-MSI,
    and S1-SAR). Using these three sensors, we compared the trend between satellite-derived
    surface water area and in situ water level. We used all the available common dates
    between satellite and in situ data to compare surface water area time series derived
    from satellite data and 24 h mean in situ water-level data for 21 MA lakes. To
    compare in situ water-level data with satellite-derived surface water area, bihourly
    water-level data were averaged for 24 h to obtain the mean daily water level.
    To assess accuracy, we first found the total number of matched dates between the
    available satellite images and in situ logger data during the study period for
    each of the 21 lakes. We then qualitatively examined the alignment in the patterns
    and trends between the satellite-derived surface water area time series and the
    in situ water-level time series. We looked for consistent increases and decreases
    that aligned between the two datasets, indicative of accurate capture of water-level
    fluctuations. We assessed accuracy of the satellite data by comparing the magnitude
    and spatiotemporal trend of surface water area to those of in situ relative water-level
    data. In situ water-level data were available from 18 WD lakes and 3 non-drawdown
    (ND) lakes in MA (Figure 2; [2]). Lakes varied in surface area (0.19–4.21 km2),
    mean depth (1.5–7.6 m), and maximum depth (3.0–25.7 m). The data were collected
    using pressure transducers (Onset HOBO U20L-01, Bourne, MA) bihourly for 3–4 years
    (2014–2018). More details on in situ water-level data can be found in Carmignani
    et al. [2]. We assessed how lake size, shape, and shoreline slope affected the
    surface water area trend when compared to in situ water-level time-series data.
    Some lakes were very narrow in shape (Hamilton), some with dendritic geometry
    (Wyman) and some with wide surface area (Stockbridge, Richmond, Wyola). For shoreline
    slope, we used digital bathymetry maps of lakes (Supplementary Materials Figure
    S1) to interpret the surface water area fluctuation observed in satellite maps.
    Surface water spatiotemporal maps were produced in the GEE platform for selective
    WD lakes before, during, and after winter drawdown. 2.5. Statewide Classification
    of WD Lakes Using the US Fish and Wildlife Service National Wetland shapefile
    of lakes, we extracted surface water area data from October 2014 to October 2021
    for all MA lakes >0.3 km2 (166 lakes) using S1-SAR data in the GEE platform. We
    empirically determined the 0.3 km2 threshold by evaluating the accuracy of the
    satellite-derived water area measurements against in situ water-level data for
    a subset of MA lakes ranging in size from 0.1 km2 to 15 km2. Other studies have
    also found that accuracy of satellite-based lake water area extraction decreases
    for smaller water bodies without specifying any size threshold [43,44,45]. While
    the 0.3 km2 cutoff was suitable for reliably monitoring water level fluctuations
    in our MA lake dataset, further accuracy assessments would be required to determine
    an appropriate minimum lake size threshold if applying this method in other geographic
    regions. After applying the 0.3 km2 cutoff, we exported the time-series surface
    water area data from the GEE platform in .csv format for further analysis. To
    differentiate WD lakes from ND lakes, Carmignani et al. [2] divided each annual
    cycle (April to March) of in situ water-level data into summer (April to September)
    and winter (October to March) periods. They found that WD lakes exhibited significantly
    lower water levels during the winter compared to summer, while ND lakes showed
    the opposite seasonal pattern. We implemented a similar seasonality-based classification
    idea in an automated way using a machine learning technique which takes time-series
    data as input to classify WD lakes. We used K-nearest neighbor (KNN) to classify
    the time series of WD and ND lakes. This method can handle large datasets and
    automates the WD lake characterization process. To implement this classification
    algorithm, we used a Python library package, tslearn (https://github.com/tslearn-team/tslearn,
    accessed on 1 December 2022). To implement the KNN classification model, continuous
    time-series data were required as input. Therefore, we used linear interpolation
    between the actual Sentinel 1 observation dates (~6 days) to generate daily surface
    water extent values for each lake. This allowed creation of a consistent time-step
    series across all lakes for model implementation. While interpolation introduces
    some uncertainty on days without true observations, we chose linear interpolation
    as a simple method to create a continuous dataset while minimizing assumption
    of non-linear changes between observations. Importantly, the ~6 days revisit frequency
    still captured the major seasonal fluctuations in water levels critical for distinguishing
    winter drawdown. We excluded outliers in the time-series data using a 95% confidence
    interval and standardized the data using a normalization method (min–max). To
    classify the lakes with in situ data, we used a 7-fold cross validation approach
    to maximize the data for model training. We used a stratified sampling approach
    based on the WD and ND classes of the lakes to ensure a balanced representation
    of both classes in the training and testing datasets. Out of 44 WD lake samples
    (10 lakes × 2 yrs = 20; 8 lakes × 3 yrs = 24), we used 30 samples for training
    and 14 samples for testing. Out of eight ND lake samples (2 lakes × 3 yrs = 6;
    1 lake × 2 yrs = 2), we used five samples for training and three samples for testing.
    Cross-validation was performed using the test dataset (WD = 14, ND = 3) in seven
    iterations. We divided the test dataset of 17 total lakes (WD = 14, ND = 3) into
    7 groups, each containing 3 lakes (2 WD and 1 ND lake). For each fold, the 3 lakes
    were held out for model testing while the remaining 14 lakes were used for model
    training. In each iteration, we used 49 samples for training and 3 samples for
    testing. We used different test samples in each of the seven iterations to cover
    all test samples. The accuracy results were then averaged across the seven folds.
    We also examined the effect of the time window on classification accuracy. Time
    windows included 12 months, 6 months (August to December), and 3 months (October
    to December). We followed the same procedure: three test samples at a time and
    averaging the accuracy across seven iterations for the time-window experiments.
    For satellite data classification, we selected 38 known lakes (WD = 24; ND = 14)
    with either WD history or no history of WD based on a survey result conducted
    by Carmignani et al. [2]. We used 5 years (April 2016–March 2021) of surface water
    area time-series data for training and testing the accuracy of the classification
    model. For training, we used a total of 140 samples (WD = 90 samples (18 lakes
    × 5 yrs); ND = 50 samples (10 lakes × 5 yrs)) and for testing, we used a total
    of 50 samples (WD = 30 samples (6 lakes × 5 yrs); ND = 20 samples (4 lakes × 5
    yrs)). We used a combination of lakes in both training and testing datasets to
    avoid any site-specific bias in the result. Similar to in situ analysis, we used
    12-month, 6-month, and 3-month time series during the classification. Once we
    finalized the best time window for satellite-based classification, we combined
    the accurately classified WD and ND lakes samples from both training and testing
    datasets to create a master training dataset for classifying all 166 lakes in
    MA. To our knowledge, this study represents the first application of machine learning
    techniques to satellite data for statewide mapping and classification of WD versus
    ND lakes. While past studies have focused on manual classification of individual
    or small groups of lakes, our method allowed efficient classification of drawdown
    status across 166 lakes in Massachusetts. 2.6. Statewide WD Lake Frequency (2016–2021)
    and Precipitation Data We created a statewide WD frequency map for 166 lakes using
    satellite-based classification data between 2016–2021. The multi-year statewide
    frequency mapping provides novel insights into the spatial patterns and prevalence
    of winter drawdown practices not feasible through analysis of individual lakes.
    The annual classification for each lake was performed by implementing the ML-based
    time-series algorithm based on the tslearn package [46]. This algorithm can capture
    the shape and similarity of time-series data, but it may not account for the seasonality
    and trend of the data. Therefore, we applied some post-processing steps to filter
    out the false-positive WD lakes using the seasonality and trend information. We
    calculated the slope of the water level between 1 October and 1 December for each
    year, which is the expected period of water-level decrease for WD lakes. If the
    slope was positive, indicating an increasing water level, we reclassified the
    lake as a ND lake. We also reclassified the lakes with WD starting dates beyond
    31 January as ND lakes, because winter drawdown operations usually end by the
    end of January. We performed these post-processing steps to improve the accuracy
    of classification of WD lakes. These post-processing steps were simple and easy
    to implement compared to complex preprocessing techniques such as deseasonalization
    and detrending the time-series data. In addition, WD lakes exhibit a distinct
    seasonal decline in water levels during fall–winter months, while ND lakes do
    not show this sharp downward trend. Removing the seasonal component through deseasonalization
    may eliminate this key differentiation in hydrologic regimes that the model uses
    for classification. Likewise, not detrending retains the directionality and magnitude
    of water-level changes that distinguish drawdown versus non-drawdown lakes. However,
    exploring preprocessing techniques as an option to potentially improve classification
    is an area for future refinement. To assess the effect of precipitation on WD
    frequency, precipitation data for MA were downloaded from NASA’s Giovanni web
    interface for 2016–2020. The GPM monthly precipitation product (GPM_3IMERGM_07)
    was downloaded for the entire state and then county-wide data were extracted using
    MA county shapefiles to exclude data from islands. We extracted both annual (12
    month) precipitation and precipitation data for September to December for each
    of the five years. 2.7. WD Metrics Calculation A unique aspect of this study was
    the development of methods to automatically calculate key WD metrics including
    timing, duration, magnitude, and lake area exposure using satellite-derived lake
    water levels. Automatic calculation of these metrics allowed efficient quantification
    of drawdown characteristics across many lakes and years. We calculated WD metrics
    for each of the five years for WD lakes using the MA time-series data (see, as
    an example, Supplementary Materials Figure S2). To determine WD metrics, we used
    1 September as the starting window to exclude any drawdown happening before this
    date. We used a criterion of a consistent decline in water level until it reached
    the lowest level to determine the start of WD. Within such a consistent decline,
    we derived the first date of such a consistent decline as the WD starting date.
    Then, to find out the relative WD magnitude, we first determined the reference
    pool level (RPL) for each year and the lowest magnitude during the WD phase. To
    determine the RPL, we used a time window of 1 week before and after the maximum
    value post-lowest water level and then computed the median value within that 14-day
    window (±1 week of maximum value). We subtracted the lowest water level from the
    RPL value to derive the relative WD magnitude for each lake and for each year.
    We considered the first time when the water level reached the RPL after WD as
    the end of WD. WD duration was calculated as the difference between the end of
    WD and the start of WD. Finally, we computed the percentage of lake area exposed
    (%LAE) during the WD phase as Equation (1). We created boxplots for each metric
    across five years to show the annual variability as well as the variability across
    WD lakes. Correlation analysis was also used to show relationships among metrics
    and variability within and across years. %LAE= 𝑊𝐴 (𝑅𝑃𝐿)−𝑊𝐴 (𝐿𝑜𝑤𝑒𝑠𝑡 𝑙𝑒𝑣𝑒𝑙) 𝑊𝐴 (𝑅𝑃𝐿)
    ×100 (1) where %LAE = percentage of lake area exposed at lowest water level, WA
    (RPL) = water area at reference pool level, and WA (Lowest level) = water area
    at the lowest winter water level. 3. Results 3.1. Surface Water Area (Optical
    vs. SAR) Comparisons between surface water area values derived from optical sensors
    (LS8-OLI and S2-MSI) and the S1-SAR sensor revealed the effects of sun glint,
    cloud cover, and ice cover. LS8-OLI was affected by heavy sun glint (a mirror-type
    reflection) [47], such that the derived water surface area was much lower, as
    seen on 12 June 2017 (Figure 3a,a’). In contrast, S2-MSI and S1-SAR were not affected
    by sun glint on that day, allowing for a complete surface water area to be captured
    (Figure 3b’,c’). Figure 3. Raw images (a–l) and corresponding surface water area
    maps (a’–l’) derived from three satellite sensors (Landsat 8-Operational Land
    Imager (OLI), Sentinel 2-MultiSpectral Instrument (MSI), and Sentinel 1-synthetic
    aperture radar (SAR)) for Lake Onota, Massachusetts. Dates were selected where
    environmental conditions presented potential issues: sun glint (a–c; 21 June 2017),
    clouds (d–f; 30 July 2017), cloud shadow (g–i; 14 December 2017), and ice (j–l;
    31 January 2018). Cloud cover partially affected the LS8-OLI scene (Figure 3d)
    and significantly affected the S2-MSI scene (Figure 3e) as shown on 30 July 2017,
    leading to inaccurate estimates of water area. In contrast, S1-SAR-derived surface
    water extent was not affected by clouds (Figure 3f’). Cloud shadow and ice cover
    were observed in LS8-OLI and S2-MSI scenes acquired on 14 December 2017 (Figure
    3g,h). The cloud-affected region in the LS8-OLI scene was misclassified as water
    (Figure 3g’) and ice cover significantly reduced the surface water area derived
    from both optical sensors (Figure 3g’,h’). In case of SAR imagery (Figure 3i),
    we observed that the ice-covered region appeared grey and water appeared dark;
    therefore, only the dark region was classified as water (Figure 3i’). Further,
    when the lake was completely covered by ice in 31 January 2018 scenes (both LS8-OLI
    and S2-MSI) (Figure 3j,k), water area values derived from optical sensors were
    very low (Figure 3j’,k’). However, for the same date, S1-SAR-derived water area
    was much higher than that derived by optical sensors and almost the entire lake
    had water except for the northern part (Figure 3l’). The time-series analysis
    revealed that cloud and ice problems limit the use of optical sensors to differentiate
    between WD and ND lakes (Figure 4). This was evident in the comparative time-series
    example of WD and ND lake surface water area derived from three sensors (Figure
    4). There was a data gap and implausible values (marked in red circles in Figure
    4a,b) in surface water area derived from optical sensors due to partial cloud
    cover and ice cover over the study area. In contrast, surface water areas derived
    from the S1-SAR sensor showed a clear and consistent trend (Figure 4). For a WD
    lake, the gradual reduction in surface water area was observed in late fall and
    it came back to normal before the summer (Figure 4a). For a ND lake, surface water
    area was observed to be lowest during summer and highest during the wet season
    as expected in case of a natural lake (Figure 4b). Figure 4. Surface water area
    time-series of Lake Otis, a winter drawdown (WD) lake (a), and Leverett Pond,
    a non-winter drawdown lake (ND) (b) in Massachusetts derived from three sensors,
    namely Sentinel 1-synthetic aperture radar (SAR), Landsat 8-Operational Land Imager
    (OLI), and Sentinel 2-MultiSpectral Instrument (MSI). Cloud cover and revisit
    frequency resulted in less frequent observations derived from optical sensors
    (Landsat 8OLI and Sentinel 2-MSI) than Sentinel 1-SAR. Red circles highlight outliers
    caused by ice and cloud cover. 3.2. Surface Water Area vs. In Situ Water Level
    S1-SAR-derived spatiotemporal maps corresponding to Lake Onota, a WD lake, showed
    consistent decline in water area during WD period (Figure 5a). The areas exposed
    due to WD were mainly the shallowest regions within the lake, as indicated when
    compared with a bathymetry map (Figure 5a). Comparative analysis of three sensors
    indicated the highest match-up data points with in situ water-level data were
    obtained using the S1-SAR sensor. This was in contrast to limited data from optical
    sensors due to cloud cover and the longer revisit frequency of LS8-OLI (16-days)
    (Figure 5b). Additionally, observing the recession and refill trend for WD lakes
    proved challenging with sparse observations from optical sensors. In addition,
    distinguishing lower water levels due to WD or due to partial cloud cover or ice
    cover was not easy in time-series data derived from optical sensors. In contrast,
    S1-SAR-derived time-series data clearly showed the recession and refill trend
    for WD lakes similar to those of in situ observations (Figure 5b). Based on these
    results and the aforementioned limitations of optical sensors, we did not include
    them in further analysis and only data and results from the S1-SAR sensor were
    analyzed. Figure 5. (a) Example of spatiotemporal variability in surface water
    area showing drawdown regions (dark regions compared to blue-colored water regions)
    matching with shallow regions (orange and red colors) in respective bathymetry
    maps for Lake Onota, Massachusetts (MA), and (b) comparison between water area
    derived from three sensors (red circle: Landsat 8-Operational Land Imager (OLI);
    blue square: Sentinel 1-synthetic aperture radar (SAR); and green triangle: Sentinel
    2-MultiSpectral Instrument (MSI)) and water level derived from in situ loggers
    (purple diamond) for Lake Onota. Relative water levels derived from in situ loggers
    for 21 MA lakes and surface water area derived from the S1-SAR sensor showed similar
    patterns in time series for several large- and medium-sized (Supplementary Materials
    Figure S3) lakes. For a few large lakes, satellite-derived data were not well
    aligned with in situ water-level data. We also observed a time lag between in
    situ water level and satellite-derived surface water area, whereby during fall
    drawdown, in situ water level declines precede satellite-derived water area declines.
    Conversely, during recession, we observed that satellite-derived surface water
    area returned to normal levels earlier than in situ water levels. The smallest
    lake size that showed similar water-level fluctuations as those of in situ data
    among WD lakes was Lake Greenwater (0.31 km2). The smallest ND lake which showed
    a similar pattern as that of in situ data was Leverett Pond (0.3 km2). Therefore,
    we decided to use this size threshold (0.3 km2) for extracting statewide lake
    data for characterizing WD lakes using S1-SAR data. 3.3. Classification of WD
    Lakes The in situ ML-based time-series classification results showed the highest
    overall accuracy for both training (99.49%) and testing (95.83%) datasets (Table
    2) when we used a 3-month time window (October to December), as opposed to 12-
    and 6-month time windows (Table 2). In addition, individual accuracy for both
    WD training (99.7%) and WD testing (100%) as well as ND training (98.21%) and
    ND testing (87.5%) was observed to be highest for a 3-month time window compared
    to 6-month and 12-month time windows (Table 2). These results suggest that the
    3 months from October to December are crucial for differentiating WD and ND lakes
    in MA. Table 2. Accuracy assessment of machine learning-based classification of
    winter drawdown (WD) and non-drawdown (ND) lakes using in situ data from 18 WD
    lakes and 3 ND lakes within MA. The ML-based time-series classification using
    satellite data showed the highest overall classification accuracy (83.57%) for
    the training dataset using a 3-month time window (October to December), compared
    to 6-month and 12-month windows (Table 3). However, overall accuracy for the testing
    dataset was observed to be highest (62%) using a 12-month time-window (Table 3).
    For individual lake types, the classification accuracy of the training dataset
    for both WD and ND was highest for the 3-month time window. However, for the test
    dataset, accuracy of WD classification was reduced when using a 3-month time window
    (76.66%) compared to a 12-month time window (86.67%). The accuracy for the ND
    test dataset was low for 12-month and 6-month time windows (25%) and accuracy
    slightly increased (35%) when using a 3-month time-window. Overall, there are
    more chances of false positives (ND lake classified as WD lake) compared to false
    negatives (WD lake classified as ND lake) using this ML-based classification (Table
    3). Table 3. Accuracy assessment of machine learning-based classification of winter
    drawdown (WD) and non-Drawdown (ND) lakes using satellite data for WD and ND lakes
    within Massachusetts. To improve the accuracy of the satellite-based classification
    implemented on the statewide dataset, we combined both training and testing data
    for both WD and ND lakes (WD: 120; ND: 70). However, we excluded some problematic
    lake data with random fluctuations (WD: n = 20; ND: n = 19) which resulted in
    a final training dataset of 151 samples (WD: n = 100; ND: n = 51; Total: n = 151).
    This new training dataset resulted in improved accuracy for both WD (98.0%) and
    ND (98.0%) classification using a 3-month (October to December) time window. 3.4.
    Statewide WD Classification WD is widely practiced throughout MA, with the most
    frequent drawdowns happening in the western and central parts of the state (Figure
    6a, Supplementary Materials Table S1). Out of 166 lakes, 51 are noted for conducting
    WD annually (≥4 years classified as WD) and 24 lakes conduct WD biennially. The
    total count of WD lakes in yearly classification across MA showed an alternative
    pattern, with a higher number of WD lakes in 2017 and 2019 compared to the other
    three years (Figure 6b). Over the same period, annual and fall precipitation was
    highest in 2018 and lowest in 2016 and 2020 (Figure 6b). Figure 6. (a) Winter
    drawdown (WD) frequency for 166 lakes across Massachusetts for five years (2016–2020);
    bubble size and color reflect the frequency. (b) Total number of WD lakes (blue
    bars) and total annual precipitation (orange bar) and total precipitation between
    September to December (green bar) for contiguous Massachusetts between 2016–2020.
    3.5. Winter Drawdown Metrics Boxplots revealed the interannual variability in
    WD metrics (Figure 7). The median WD start date was earliest in 2016 (6 October)
    and latest in 2018 (5 December), with the smallest variability (interquartile
    range (IQR) = 35 d; σ = ±31 d) in 2018, the wettest year of the 5-year period
    (Figure 6b; Table 4). Correspondingly, the longest WD duration was in 2016 (median
    = 205 d) and the shortest duration was in 2018 (median = 162 d; Figure 7b). In
    2018, both WD start date and duration had the narrowest interquartile range (WD
    start date IQR = 35 d; WD duration IQR = 47 d) compared to during the other 4
    years (Table 4). Figure 7. Boxplots reporting the minimum and maximum (whiskers),
    25th–75th%iles (boxes), medians (horizontal line and label), and outliers (circles)
    of winter drawdown (WD) metrics: (a) start date, (b) duration, (c) relative magnitude,
    and (d) % lake area exposed for five years (2016–2020). Start dates range from
    1 September to 1 February. Table 4. Summary of winter drawdown (WD) Metrics (WD
    start date, duration, magnitude, and % lake area exposed) over the 5 years (2016
    to 2020). Each year, the number of WD-classified lakes (n) are also included in
    respective years. IQR is inter-quartile range, %LAE is percentage of lake area
    exposed, and σ is standard deviation from mean value. The date format here is
    mm/dd/yyyy. We observed that the median WD magnitude increased between 2016 (0.08
    km2) and 2018 (0.11 km2). It should be noted that the median size of the 166 lakes
    under this study was 0.81 km2. The maximum WD magnitude (7.55 km2) and variability
    in WD magnitude among lakes were highest in 2018 (σ = ±1.13 km2) (Table 4), the
    year with the highest precipitation in the 5-year study period (2016–2020). Following
    the wet year of 2018, precipitation decreased in 2019. Correspondingly, we observed
    a decline in median WD magnitude that year (Figure 7c). In fact, 2019 had the
    lowest median WD magnitude (0.07 km2) as well as the lowest variability (IQR =
    0.09 km2; σ = ±0.12 km2) in WD magnitude among the studied lakes. However, when
    precipitation further decreased in 2020, we did not observe a continued decline
    in WD magnitude. Instead, median WD magnitude increased in 2020 despite the reduction
    in precipitation. The median percent area exposed ranged from 8.6% (2017) to 11.8%
    (2020), although there were high outliers each year (Figure 7d). As with WD magnitude,
    the lowest variability in lake area exposure occurred in 2019 (IQR = 7.99%; σ
    = ±7.60%) (Table 4). The median lake area exposure was also lowest in 2019 (9.29%),
    mirroring the median WD magnitude. Relative WD magnitude was positively correlated
    with % lake area exposed (Figure 8a). The weakest relationship (R2 = 0.45) occurred
    in 2020, the year with the lowest number of WD lakes, and the strongest relationship
    (R2 = 0.70) occurred in 2017, the year with the highest number of WD lakes. There
    was high cross-lake variability in both metrics, with the highest area exposed
    (>45%) in 2017 and 2018 (Figure 8a). Similarly, there was high cross-lake variability
    in WD start date and WD duration (Figure 8b). Figure 8. (a) Comparison between
    relative winter drawdown (WD) magnitude (Km2) and % lake area exposed for five

    study demonstrated the utility of freely available multi-sensor satellite data
    in the GEE platform for characterizing winter water-level drawdowns across lakes
    in Massachusetts. Among the three sensors compared, S1-SAR provided the most consistent
    and gap-free time-series data to differentiate drawdown and non-drawdown lakes
    compared to optical sensors which were prone to cloud cover and sun glint effects.
    The machine learning-based time-series analysis accurately classified drawdown
    and non-drawdown lakes using both in situ and S1-SAR data when a 3-month period
    (October–December) was used. Leveraging GEE and machine learning approaches, we
    were able to conduct a comprehensive analysis of statewide lakes (166 lakes >
    0.3 km2) and identified drawdown frequency and WD metrics over a 5-year period.
    Interannual variability in metrics suggested that WD is primarily a managed activity
    rather than driven by precipitation variability. The same approach can be extended
    to broader areas and regions to assess the impacts of WD on lake ecosystems and
    water resources. 4.1. Effectiveness of Sensors for Capturing Water Area and Water-Level
    Fluctuations We conducted a robust accuracy assessment of different satellite
    sensors for capturing water-level variations during the challenging winter season.
    Our analysis identified Sentinel 1-SAR as the most reliable for capturing winter
    water-level variations indicative of drawdown practices. Our results demonstrated
    some of the major advantages of SAR over optical sensors for mapping surface water
    extent under problematic conditions like cloud cover, sun glint, and ice cover.
    Optical sensors like Landsat and Sentinel 2 have been used widely for water body
    mapping [48,49] but are limited by an inability to penetrate cloud cover. Several
    studies have shown SAR provides consistent water extraction unaffected by clouds
    or sunlight angle [19,26]. Our analysis matched these past findings, with frequent
    cloud gaps and sun glint artifacts in the Landsat and Sentinel 2 time series.
    SAR has also been found to better characterize lakes during ice cover compared
    to optical data [50,51], though accuracy declines once the lake fully freezes
    over [52,53,54] and it results in overestimation of water area due to specular
    reflection from a smooth surface. A hybrid approach incorporating optical and
    SAR data could help address this limitation during winter. Overall, Sentinel 1
    provided consistent time-series data on surface water extent changes that served
    as a proxy for relative water-level fluctuations in lakes during fall drawdown
    and spring refill periods. The time-series analysis of surface water extent changes
    derived from S1-SAR aligned well with in situ logger data. The relationship between
    satellite-derived surface water area and relative in situ water-level fluctuations
    has been assessed in multiple past studies [43,55,56]. Strong correlations are
    typically found for lakes with gradual slope shorelines, low shoreline-to-surface-area
    ratios, and well-defined boundaries [43,57]. The small discrepancies between SAR-derived
    area and in situ water levels could be attributed to factors such as wind, shoreline
    slope, frozen lake surface, size and shape of the lake, in situ data logger deployment
    location, and drawdown magnitude [43,57,58]. Shoreline slope influences the extent
    of water-level change that is detectable through area change. For instance, Figure
    5b shows significantly lower areal change compared to the relative water-level
    fluctuation. Steeper slopes result in smaller areal changes relative to water
    level fluctuations. Moderate sloping shorelines are more suitable for detecting
    gradual water-level changes [58]. Additionally, frozen lake surfaces can mask
    the open water–ice boundary used to estimate area as water levels decline under
    ice. Busker et al. [43] observed lower accuracy for smaller waterbodies but mentioned
    that along with size, there are many other factors which may contribute to accuracy
    such as surrounding topography, surface waves, winter ice coverage, and shape
    of the water body. Keys and Scott [57] found that lakes with dendritic geometry
    resulted in poor results compared to lakes with well-defined boundaries. We also
    observed the effect of size, shape, and shoreline slope effect on accuracy when
    comparing satellite-derived results with in situ water-level measurements for
    21 lakes in MA. For example, lakes with smaller size (<0.3 km2) (Cranberry Meadow,
    Silver, Brookhaven) showed more random fluctuations in water area and did not
    align with in situ water level, whereas lakes with relatively larger size (Otis,
    Onota, Stockbridge, Goose, Garfield, Richmond, Ashmere) aligned well with in situ
    water-level fluctuations. For some moderately sized lakes (0.4 to 0.9 km2) with
    steeper bathymetry sloping (Buel, Watatic, Quacumquasit), water area did not show
    a similar trend compared to that observed in in situ water levels. In addition,
    the nature of the shoreline bathymetric gradient can also introduce lag between
    satellite-derived water area and in situ water levels. This is mainly because
    small water-level drops may not expose much area until a certain depth threshold
    is crossed. We observed a time lag between the satellite-derived surface water
    area recovery and the in situ water-level recovery in spring (e.g., Figure 5b).
    This time lag varies from lake to lake based on lake size, bathymetric profile,
    and shoreline slope of the lakes. The primary physical reason for such variable
    time lag could be the in situ sensor deployment location because in situ sensors
    provide measurements at a discrete point location, while satellite imagery provides
    water area variations for overall lakes. If water levels are increasing first
    in shallow, near-shore regions distant from the sensor, this could introduce a
    lag before the in situ gauge starts to record the rising water. Lakes with dendritic
    geometry (Wyman, Boon) and narrow shape (Hamilton) also showed poor alignment
    with in situ water levels. Though there exist the above factors which may affect
    the accuracy of satellite-derived water-level fluctuations, nonetheless, the S1-SAR
    observations provided indicative relative changes in lake water levels useful
    for assessing winter drawdown practices. 4.2. WD Frequency in MA Lakes Using the
    extracted water area time-series data, a machine learning approach was implemented
    to classify WD versus ND lakes based on their seasonal water-level fluctuation
    patterns. Using both in situ and satellite training data, the classification accuracy
    was highest when using just a 3-month (October–December) time window compared
    to longer 6- and 12-month periods. The 6-month and 12-month time window classifications
    could be affected by drawdown during summertime and may result in misclassification
    of ND lakes as WD lakes (false positive). The 3-month window (October–December)
    captures the active drawdown phase when water levels steadily decline in WD lakes
    in MA in contrast to ND lakes that show seasonal variability but not large directional
    changes during fall–winter months [2]. Potential uncertainty exists from the linear
    interpolation used to create daily water extent values between actual Sentinel
    1 observation dates. Future work could incorporate methods to estimate non-linear
    changes during intervals between satellite observation dates. A limitation of
    the machine learning model’s development was the imbalance between the number
    of WD and ND samples available for training and testing the classification. The
    disproportionate sample sizes between classes may have biased the accuracy results
    in favor of the majority WD class. While we used cross-validation approaches to
    account for the imbalance, it may have introduced some bias favoring the majority
    WD class. Increasing the ND sample size in future could improve accuracy, particularly
    the false-positive rate. However, the overall accuracy achieved even with imbalance
    classes demonstrates the potential of machine learning for automated WD classification
    using remote sensing time-series data. The statewide mapping indicated that drawdowns
    are widely practiced across MA. Over 75% of lakes >0.3 km2 had at least one WD
    during the five study years, indicating it is a common management practice. There
    was high interannual variability in the number of lakes conducting drawdowns each
    year, which cannot be explained by precipitation alone. These results concur with
    the findings of Carmignani et al. [2] who concluded that drawdowns are primarily
    based on management decisions rather than climate factors. Although our study
    did not survey lake managers, documented reasons for conducting drawdowns include
    aquatic plant control, fisheries management, infrastructure maintenance, and waterfront
    access [35]. Additional social surveys across private and public lake managers
    could provide further insights into motivations behind drawdown decisions each
    year. 4.3. Variability in WD Characteristics in MA Lakes The WD metrics provide
    new insights into the characteristics of this artificial hydrologic alteration
    across MA lakes. A few studies have analyzed drawdown trends for groups of lakes
    in particular regions [2,59]. Some drawdown studies have calculated similar water-level
    metrics using in situ data [1,2], but the remote sensing-derived measurements
    allow assessment at broader scales. Quantifying drawdown timing, magnitude, duration,
    and lake exposure area provides tangible metrics for evaluating ecological impacts
    and comparing across years and lakes [35]. Our analysis of WD metrics revealed
    high interannual variability in magnitude of drawdowns and lake area exposure.
    We observed an interesting relationship between precipitation, water-level drawdown
    magnitude, and lake area exposure in studied lakes over the 5-year study period.
    The positive association observed between precipitation and drawdown magnitude
    suggests that higher rainfall leads to greater water inputs and rising lake levels
    prior to drawdown, subsequently enabling larger drawdowns. This is evidenced by
    the highest precipitation, drawdown magnitudes, and among-lake variability in
    2018, followed by declines in 2019. However, the rebound in drawdown magnitude
    from 2019 to 2020 despite declining precipitation illustrates that other factors
    beyond rainfall also govern drawdown dynamics. Specifically, while precipitation
    governs water inputs, drawdown on lake water for irrigation, municipal use, and
    hydroelectric generation may drive drawdown magnitude. In contrast to drawdown
    magnitude, we did not see a significant relationship between precipitation and
    lake area exposure during drawdowns. Exposure remained relatively stable across
    all five years, with the lowest exposure again in 2019. This suggests area exposure
    may be controlled more by the morphology of lake basins and maximum drawdown depths,
    rather than by precipitation inputs. Furthermore, the lack of a relationship between
    precipitation and lake area exposure indicates that drawdown regulations successfully
    maintain a consistent exposed area, despite varying water levels. Overall, our
    findings highlight that both climate and human factors regulate lake water balances
    and interact to drive interannual variation in drawdown magnitude, underscoring
    the complexity of predicting lake responses to future environmental change. A
    priority for future research could be quantifying water consumption and evaluating
    how shifting human demand interacts with climate to control lake water levels
    and ecological impacts of drawdowns. Metrics like exposure area help translate
    the water-level changes to a habitat context. The exposure of up to 30% of lake
    areas for months at a time may have ecological impacts. Considerable interannual
    variability was also observed in drawdown start date and duration, which correlated
    with precipitation patterns. While managers ultimately decide when to lower water
    levels each year, total annual precipitation and specifically fall precipitation
    appeared to influence drawdown start date and duration. Median start date showed
    an increasing trend between 2016–2018 aligned with precipitation patterns. This
    suggests that wetter conditions could delay the onset of drawdowns. In contrast,
    duration declined with increasing precipitation, indicating earlier refilling
    of lakes in wetter years. This indicates that natural hydrologic conditions mediate
    aspects of drawdown implementation; however, these relationships need to be interpreted
    cautiously given the short five-year study period. As more satellite data become
    available, they can strengthen the analysis of relationships between climate,
    management practices, and drawdown characteristics. 4.4. Web Application Interface
    To facilitate broader access and use of the satellite-derived lake characterization
    technique outlined in this study, we developed an interactive web application
    leveraging the GEE platform [60]. This interface allows users to visualize and
    download the remotely sensed time series of lake water areas and corresponding
    water-level estimates for over 10,000 lakes across the northeast and upper Midwest
    United States. By leveraging cloud computing capabilities, the tool provides rapid
    access to consistently processed satellite imagery with just a few clicks. Users
    can zoom to a lake of interest, specify a date range, and immediately generate
    plots and download data. While currently limited to partner states, the application
    code could be adapted to monitor additional regions. Detailed documentation on
    the interface capabilities, underlying methodology, and potential limitations
    can be accessed at this link (https://tinyurl.com/yxnernxv, accessed on 1 December
    2023). Overall, this web-based decision support tool represents an innovative
    approach to openly share and apply the remote sensing-derived water-level data
    to address diverse freshwater science and management needs. 5. Conclusions This
    study demonstrated a scalable approach using open-access Sentinel 1-SAR data and
    cloud computing tools that could be applied across large regions to map and monitor
    water-level fluctuations in lakes [51]. The data and analysis framework developed
    for MA can serve as a template for assessing drawdown practices in other parts
    of the world, which is not feasible with in situ monitoring alone. The ability
    to detect WD carries many potential management applications, such as evaluating
    effects on near-shore habitats and relationships to lake water quality [2,35].
    The information on drawdown frequency and metrics can aid water managers and policy
    makers in setting guidelines for balancing the intended benefits of drawdowns
    for nuisance plant control and infrastructure protection versus the potential
    ecological impacts of these artificial water-level manipulations [9]. The interactive
    web interface developed through this project provides state agencies and other
    stakeholders with a user-friendly tool to visualize drawdown frequency and characteristics.
    Overall, this study produced new hydrologic intelligence to inform water resource
    management and policy decisions related to drawdown practices. Supplementary Materials

  description: 'Soil salinization is a global issue confronting humanity, imposing
    significant constraints on agricultural production in the irrigated regions along
    the southern bank of the Yellow River. This, in turn, leads to the degradation
    of the ecological environment and inadequate grain yields. Hence, it is essential
    to explore the magnitude and spatial patterns of soil salinization to promote
    efficient and sustainable agricultural development. This study carried out a two-year
    surface soil sampling experiment encompassing the periods before spring irrigation
    and the budding, flowering, and maturity stages of sunflower fields in the irrigated
    area along the southern bank of the Yellow River. It employed deep learning in
    conjunction with multispectral remote sensing conducted by UAV to estimate soil
    salinity levels in the sunflower fields. Following the identification of sensitive
    spectral variables through correlation analysis, we proceeded to model and compare
    the accuracy and stability of various models, including the deep learning Transformer
    model, traditional machine learning BP neural network (BPNN), random forest model
    (RF), and partial least squares regression model (PLSR). The findings indicate
    that the precision of soil salinity content (SSC) retrieval in saline–alkali land
    can be significantly enhanced by incorporating the RE band of UAV data. Four SSC
    inversion models were developed using the most suitable spectral variables, resulting
    in precise soil salinity inversion. The model order based on accuracy and stability
    was Transformer > BPNN > RF > PLSR. Notably, the Transformer model achieved a
    prediction accuracy exceeding 0.8 for both the training and test datasets, as
    indicated by R2 values. The precision order of the soil salinity inversion model
    in each period is as follows: before spring irrigation > budding period > maturity
    period > flowering stages. Additionally, the accuracy is higher in the bare soil
    stage compared to the crop cover stage. The Transformer model exhibited RMSE and
    R2 values of 2.41 g kg−1 and 0.84 on the test datasets, with the salt inversion
    results aligning closely with field-measured data. The results showed that the
    Transformer deep learning model integrated with RE band data significantly enhances

    is a global issue confronting humanity, imposing significant constraints on agricultural
    production in the irrigated regions along the southern bank of the Yellow River.
    This, in turn, leads to the degradation of the ecological environment and inadequate
    grain yields. Hence, it is essential to explore the magnitude and spatial patterns
    of soil salinization to promote efficient and sustainable agricultural development.
    This study carried out a two-year surface soil sampling experiment encompassing
    the periods before spring irrigation and the budding, flowering, and maturity
    stages of sunflower fields in the irrigated area along the southern bank of the
    Yellow River. It employed deep learning in conjunction with multispectral remote
    sensing conducted by UAV to estimate soil salinity levels in the sunflower fields.
    Following the identification of sensitive spectral variables through correlation
    analysis, we proceeded to model and compare the accuracy and stability of various
    models, including the deep learning Transformer model, traditional machine learning
    BP neural network (BPNN), random forest model (RF), and partial least squares
    regression model (PLSR). The findings indicate that the precision of soil salinity
    content (SSC) retrieval in saline–alkali land can be significantly enhanced by
    incorporating the RE band of UAV data. Four SSC inversion models were developed
    using the most suitable spectral variables, resulting in precise soil salinity
    inversion. The model order based on accuracy and stability was Transformer > BPNN
    > RF > PLSR. Notably, the Transformer model achieved a prediction accuracy exceeding
    0.8 for both the training and test datasets, as indicated by R2 values. The precision
    order of the soil salinity inversion model in each period is as follows: before
    spring irrigation > budding period > maturity period > flowering stages. Additionally,
    the accuracy is higher in the bare soil stage compared to the crop cover stage.
    The Transformer model exhibited RMSE and R2 values of 2.41 g kg−1 and 0.84 on
    the test datasets, with the salt inversion results aligning closely with field-measured
    data. The results showed that the Transformer deep learning model integrated with
    RE band data significantly enhances the precision and efficiency of soil salinity
    inversion within the irrigated regions along the south bank of the Yellow River.

    transformer 1. Introduction Soil salinization is a pivotal obstacle impeding the
    progress of the agricultural sector [1]. As per data, the worldwide extent of
    saline soil surged from 9.55 × 109 hm2 in 2005 to approximately 1.1 × 109 hm2
    [2]. In China, saline–alkali soil covers an area of approximately 3.69 × 107 hm2,
    constituting 5% of the nation’s total available land area. The irrigated region
    along the southern banks of the Yellow River, recognized as a major water consumer
    in China, experiences substantial secondary salinization due to extensive irrigation
    practices, favorable salt-accumulating topography, and a climate characterized
    by limited precipitation and high evaporation rates [3]. Henceforth, the paramount
    objective in managing saline–alkali land is to comprehend soil salinity’s spatial
    distribution and dynamic attributes efficiently. Nonetheless, the conventional
    method of monitoring soil salinity requires the chemical analysis of soil samples
    gathered at predetermined locations in the field. This process wastes time and
    demands substantial labor and needs to improve on issues related to the representativeness
    and timeliness of data points [4]. As research advances, an increasing number
    of scholars are advocating for the integration of remote sensing and farmland
    monitoring [5,6]. This approach offers a novel means of achieving extensive and
    swift detection of changes in farmland characteristics, leveraging the benefits
    of remote sensing, including its broad coverage, brief observation periods, substantial
    data volume, heightened efficiency, and cost-effectiveness [7]. Over the past
    few years, the widespread adoption of UAV remote sensing technology has significantly
    enhanced its role in innovative and precision agriculture, and its expanding scope
    and evolving capabilities have made it a key driver of future agricultural economic
    development [8,9]. Morcillo et al. [10] utilized high-resolution drone imagery
    for monitoring soil preservation and tracking vegetation growth postmining. Kariminejad
    et al. [11] monitored and assessed soil erosion in Iran’s Loess Plateau by integrating
    data from multiple satellites and UAVs. Nonetheless, in saline–alkali land where
    crops thrive, drones cannot directly capture the soil surface’s spectral reflectance.
    Scholars [12,13] use the RE band to enhance the vegetation index and develop a
    crop inversion model to address this issue. Zhang et al. [14] evaluated soil moisture
    content beneath the corn canopy using the RE band and quantified it with three
    machine learning algorithms: partial least squares regression (PLSR), K-nearest
    neighbor (KNN), and random forest regression (RFR). The results yielded an R2
    value of 0.78 and an rRMSE of 19.36%. Machine learning has emerged as the preferred
    method for scholars in quantifying various farmland monitoring indicators. Nevertheless,
    manual parameter adjustments can introduce errors that diminish prediction accuracy
    in machine learning. Deep learning, a novel approach in machine learning, offers
    the advantage of automatic learning based on the training objective function,
    thus mitigating the challenges associated with manual parameter adjustments [15].
    Presently, the predominant approach to soil salinity monitoring primarily involves
    the direct inversion of bare soil. In contrast, assessing soil salinity beneath
    vegetative cover remains a topic requiring more comprehensive exploration and
    discussion [16,17]. In this study, soil salinity data were gathered for sunflower
    fields before spring irrigation and during various crop cover periods within the
    irrigated area situated on the southern shores of the Yellow River. The UAV employed
    multispectral reflectance and spectral indices, including the RE band. Simultaneously,
    the Transformer model was introduced for soil salinity inversion within the experimental
    area. The Transformer model was assessed for accuracy and stability alongside
    traditional machine learning models, including the BP neural network (BPNN), random
    forest model (RF), and partial least squares regression model (PLSR). The best-performing
    model for soil salinity content (SSC) inversion was chosen, enabling the precise
    quantification of soil salinity levels in small areas. This research offers valuable
    insight into the UAV remote sensing monitoring of regional farmland salinization
    and provides essential data support for local saline soil management and utilization.
    2. Materials and Methods 2.1. Study Area As depicted in Figure 1, our study area
    encompasses the irrigated region on the Yellow River’s southern banks, encompassing
    Dalat City in Ordos City, Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region. The geographical coordinates
    for this area are 106°42′–110°27′ E and 37°35′–40°47′ N. This region experiences
    an average annual temperature range of 5.9 to 6.3 °C, a frost-free period lasting
    158 days, and an average annual precipitation ranging from 281.7 to 301.8 mm.
    Additionally, the average annual evaporation in this area falls within the range
    of 2161 to 2600 mm. On 21 July 2022, during surface soil sampling at 39 locations
    within the study area, soil samples were collected from layers measuring 20–40
    mm, 40–60 mm, 60–80 mm, and 80–100 mm. Various physical properties of the soil
    were assessed (Table 1). Utilizing the United States Department of Agriculture
    (USDA) classification system, the soil was categorized into three particle groups
    based on size: sand (2–0.02 mm), silt (0.02–0.002 mm), and clay (<0.002 mm). Additionally,
    12 texture names were assigned to construct a soil texture triangle. Analysis
    of the soil texture triangle diagram revealed that the prevailing soil type in
    this area is silt loam. Because of adverse climatic conditions and imprudent irrigation
    practices, secondary soil salinization has become a significant issue in this
    region, with approximately 3.78 × 104 hm2 of arable land affected. This situation
    substantially hampers the prospects of fostering robust and sustainable local
    agricultural practices. This research chose a 2.67 hm2 salinization site as the
    UAV data collection area within a test region characterized by level terrain and
    soft soil, with sunflowers as the indicator crop. Figure 1. Schematic diagram
    of the research area and sampling point map. Table 1. Soil physical properties.
    2.2. Test Data Acquisition and Processing 2.2.1. Gathering Field Data The study
    area, established in 2022 on a recently rehabilitated salinized wasteland, conducted
    experiments with sunflowers as the designated test crop. Employing the artificial
    spot planting method [18], the sunflowers were sown on distinct dates, namely,
    15 June 2022, and 3 June 2023, with subsequent harvests on 1 October 2022 and
    1 October 2023. The employed irrigation techniques involved Yellow River flood
    irrigation, with supplementary spring and autumn irrigation conducted before planting
    and after harvest. Notably, no irrigation was administered during the growth period.
    In this experiment, three growth stages of sunflowers were sampled: budding stage,
    emerging within 35 to 50 days after emergence; flowering stage, emerging within
    50 to 80 days after emergence; and maturity stage, emerging within 80 to 110 days
    after emergence. In light of the sunflower’s growth within the test area, soil
    samples were collected during sunny weather to complement the acquisition of multispectral
    remote sensing images by UAV. Over two consecutive years, 2022 and 2023, soil
    samples were gathered from sites suitable for drone photography in the following
    periods: 20 April 2022 (before spring irrigation), 21 July 2022 (budding stage),
    26 August 2022 (flowering stage), 20 September 2022 (maturity stage), 29 April
    2023 (before spring irrigation), 15 July 2023 (budding stage), 22 August 2023
    (flowering stage), and 27 September 2023 (maturity stage). The coordinates of
    these sampling points were documented using Ovey maps. Thirty-nine soil sampling
    points were established (Figure 1). To ensure accuracy, the collection procedure
    involved the removal of surface withered grass and garbage at the sampling point.
    A five-point sampling method was applied, centering around the sampling point,
    and consistently repeated four times, with each repetition approximately two steps
    away from the central point. Soil samples were obtained from each point at a 0–20
    cm depth using a soil sampling drill. Postcollection soil samples underwent a
    sequence of processes involving natural drying, grinding, and screening. A soil
    solution was then meticulously prepared with a specific soil–water mass ratio
    of 1:5. Following thorough mixing and settling, the soil solution’s electrical
    conductivity (EC, mS cm−1) was assessed using the DDSJ-308F conductivity meter,
    with 5 repetitions, and the average recorded value represented the soil’s conductivity
    at the respective sampling point. Ultimately, the SSC was computed using the empirical
    formula: SSC (g kg−1) = 3.609EC − 0.523. 2.2.2. UAV Data Acquisition The DJI Phantom
    4 Multispectral (P4 Multispectral) was employed to capture UAV multispectral images
    during field sampling period from 11:00 to 14:00 (Figure 2). The P4 Multispectral
    comprises six 1/29-inch (1 inch ≈ 2.54 cm) CMOS (complementary metal oxide semiconductor)
    image sensors. Among these sensors, one serves as a color sensor for capturing
    visible light (RGB) images, while the remaining 5 function as monochrome sensors
    dedicated to multispectral imaging. The following wavelengths were used: blue
    (450 nm), green (560 nm), red (650 nm), red edge (RE 730 nm) and near-infrared
    (NIR 840 nm), with a standard error of 16 nm. The TimeSync system was utilized
    to achieve microsecond-level synchronous data recording. The flight was conducted
    at an altitude of 50 m with a speed of 5 m s−1, capturing photos while hovering.
    The pixel resolution (GSD) was 2.65 cm, and the heading and side overlap degrees
    were set at 80%. The sensor’s flight path was preconfigured (Figure 3). Figure
    2. UAV data acquisition process. Figure 3. Route planning and waypoint map. The
    image, comprising five bands and captured through aerial photography, was imported
    into Pix4D Mapper 4.5.6 software, which is developed by the Swiss company Pix4D.
    The software automatically combines these bands to generate both a single-band
    image and an RGB orthophoto image of the UAV. Subsequently, ENVI Classic 5.3 software
    developed by EVIS Corporation of the United States, was employed for band synthesis
    and atmospheric correction of the UAV images. The GPS positioning data from the
    measured sampling points were then imported to obtain the corresponding spectral
    reflectance values for all five bands. 2.3. Optimization of Spectral Variables
    The spectral index is a rapid and noninvasive technique for quantifying the photochemical
    reflectance index, allowing for the assessment of the surface properties of the
    observed object [19]. The investigation into the spectral characteristics of saline
    soil serves as a crucial link in establishing the correlation between ground data
    and remote sensing data. Given the relatively large standard deviation within
    the band and the weak correlation between bands, obtaining band combinations through
    the free integration of spectral reflectance from different bands based on ground
    characteristics becomes essential. Introducing spectral indicators for the composite
    calculation of band reflectance is an effective measure for monitoring soil salinization.
    The introduction of spectral indices has significantly accelerated the growth
    of the agricultural sector. These indices have been extensively applied to assess
    various soil types, qualitatively monitor vegetation growth, and model ecological
    environments [20,21,22]. In this study, a set of representative spectral indices
    was chosen (Table 2) [23,24,25,26], including 9 salinity indices, the salinization
    remote sensing index (SRSI), brightness index (BI), intensity index (Int1), 4
    planting cover indices, and 12 red-edge spectral indices. Each spectral index’s
    respective formula was applied within ENVI 5.3 for band calculation. The coordinate
    position was determined, aligning the measured soil salt points with the spectral
    index. Subsequently, the spectral variable related to soil salt was enhanced through
    correlation analysis. Table 2. Spectral index calculation formula, where B, G,

    and Accuracy Evaluation 2.4.1. Model Construction UAV multispectral remote sensing
    was employed for soil data monitoring for two consecutive years. The soil spectral
    variables served as the model inputs, while SSC served as the model output. The
    training and test datasets were randomly partitioned. Because of the rasterization
    characteristics of the Transformer model, which aim to reduce the computational
    complexity and enhance prediction accuracy, this study opted for the Transformer
    to create the SSC inversion model. Additionally, the study utilized a PLSR, BPNN,
    and RF for training, prediction, and comparison purposes. The entire construction
    process was carried out using Python 3.8.2. The PLSR model is a regression modeling
    method that integrates the strengths of principal component analysis, linear regression
    analysis, and correlation analysis when handling multiple dependent and independent
    variables. It effectively solves problems that ordinary multiple regression models
    cannot address. The BPNN model is a multilayer feedforward network trained using
    the error backpropagation algorithm, comprising the input, hidden, and output
    layers. It is widely recognized as one of the most popular neural network models
    today. The RF model is a machine learning method introduced in 1998 that builds
    an ensemble of unrelated decision trees. It offers robustness to issues like multicollinearity,
    missing data, and imbalanced samples. As a result, RF is widely utilized as an
    effective algorithm in machine learning applications. The Transformer model developed
    by the Google team in 2017 achieved parallel information input. In contrast to
    recurrent neural networks (RNNs) that iteratively acquire information and convolutional
    neural networks (CNNs) limited to local data, the Transformer model directly accesses
    global information, enabling parallel processing that surpasses the speed of RNNs
    and enhances data analysis and processing efficiency. The Transformer architecture
    deviates from traditional CNNs and RNNs, adopting an Attention mechanism with
    encoding and decoding components and their interconnections. The encoding section
    comprises a set of encoders, while the decoding section mirrors this setup with
    an equal number of decoders corresponding to the encoders. The structural layout
    of the Transformer model is depicted in Figure 4. Figure 4. Transformer model
    structure. 2.4.2. Model Accuracy Evaluation The root mean square error (RMSE),
    coefficient of determination (R2), mean absolute error (MAE), mean relative error
    (MRE), and mean deviation error (MBE) were employed to assess and evaluate the
    model’s stability and predictive accuracy [27,28]. The loss function was utilized
    to quantify the extent of the model’s performance degradation [29]. The smaller
    the values of RMSE, MAE, MRE, and MBE, approaching zero, the estimation error
    decreases, and the precision improves. Similarly, the closer R2 is to 1, as the
    fit improves, the estimation accuracy sees a corresponding increase. The calculation
    formulas are as follows: 𝑅𝑀𝑆𝐸= ∑ 𝑛 𝑖 ( 𝑦 ̂ 𝑖 − 𝑦 𝑖 ) 2 𝑛 − − − − − − − − − − −
    − √ (1) 𝑅 2 =1− ∑ 𝑛 𝑖=1 ( 𝑦 ̂ 𝑖 − 𝑦 𝑖 ) 2 ∑ 𝑛 𝑖=1 ( 𝑦 𝑖 − 𝑦 ̄  𝑖 ) 2 (2) 𝑀𝐴𝐸=
    ∑ 𝑛 𝑖 | 𝑦 𝑖 − 𝑦 ̂ 𝑖 | 𝑛 (3) 𝑀𝑅𝐸= ∑ 𝑛 𝑖 | 𝑦 𝑖 − 𝑦 ̂ 𝑖 𝑦 𝑖 | 𝑛 (4) 𝑀𝐵𝐸= ∑ 𝑛 𝑖 (
    𝑦 𝑖 − 𝑦 ̂ 𝑖 ) 𝑛 (5) where 𝑦 𝑖 is the measured value; 𝑦 ̲ 𝑖 is the mean value of
    the measured value; 𝑦 ̂ 𝑖 is the model prediction value; and n is the number of
    samples. 3. Results 3.1. Soil Salinity Characteristics The surface soil salinity
    collected at various time intervals is categorized into the following grades:
    nonsaline soil (<3 g kg−1), light saline soil (3–5 g kg−1), moderately saline
    soil (5–7 g kg−1), heavy saline soil (7–12 g kg−1), and saline soil (>12 g kg−1);
    detailed statistical characteristics of the SSC can be found in Table 3. The study
    area exhibits a wide range of SSC, with the maximum ranging from 32.2 g kg−1 to
    14.3 g kg−1 and the median range falling between 15.8 g kg−1 and 7.4 g kg−1. Based
    on the classification criteria for soil salinization severity, the study area
    was categorized as saline soil in 2022. Following the implemented improvements,
    it will progressively transition into a heavy saline soil region by 2023, aligning
    closely with findings from field surveys. The coefficient of variation ranges
    from 0.325 to 0.492, indicating a high degree of dispersion and significant spatial
    variability in the measured soil data. A total of 313 salt data points were collected
    during eight sampling occasions, spanning from the Before spring irrigation period
    in 2022 to the Maturity stage in 2023, and these data were utilized in constructing
    the model. Table 3. Statistical analysis of SSC characteristics; Max, Min, Avg.,
    SD, Med., and CV represent the maximum, minimum, average, standard deviation,
    median, and coefficient of variation, respectively. 3.2. Correlation between Spectral
    Variables and SSC Pearson correlation analysis was performed between 33 spectral
    variables and the measured surface SSC. The outcomes are displayed in Figure 5
    and Figure 6. In Figure 5a, there is a significant correlation at the 0.01 level
    (p < 0.01) between single-band reflectance and SSC. The Pearson correlation coefficients
    (PCCs) for the SSC and spectral reflectance in the five bands are as follows:
    0.58, 0.49, 0.54, 0.50, and 0.47, respectively. Owing to the heightened energy
    levels in the blue band, it can stimulate electronic transition within iron oxide,
    eliciting a distinct optical response. Consequently, the blue band exhibited heightened
    sensitivity to soil salinity, influenced by the presence of iron oxide in the
    soil, and its reflectance demonstrates the strongest correlation with soil salinity.
    The reflectance of each spectral band over two years is illustrated in Figure
    5b,c. It is observed that the reflectance before spring irrigation surpasses that
    during the crop cover stages (including the budding, flowering, and maturity stages).
    The overall trend in reflectance remains relatively consistent across each period,
    suggesting that all spectral bands can capture the spectral attributes associated
    with soil salinity. Figure 5. (a) PCC between single-band reflectance and SSC,
    *** indicates a significant correlation at the 0.001 level; (b) reflectance of
    each spectral band of drone data in 2022; (c) reflectance of each spectral band
    of drone data in 2023. Figure 6. PCC between spectral index and SSC, *, *** indicates
    a significant correlation at the 0.05, 0.001 level. In Figure 6, it is evident
    that the spectral indices strongly associated with SSC include S5, SI, S4, SIreg,
    SI1*, and S6, with absolute correlation coefficients ranging from 0.54 to 0.62.
    Among the remaining spectral indicators, except for the negligible correlation
    between DVI and S2, the absolute correlation coefficients fall within the range
    of 0.38 to 0.54. The absolute value of the correlation coefficient for red-edge
    spectral indices, which includes the RE band, ranged from 0.50 to 0.55. This notably
    enhanced the correlation between UAV remote sensing images and the surface SSC
    in the demonstration area. In summary, the input variables for the model, which
    establish the quantitative relationship between UAV remote sensing images and
    SSC, were finalized as follows: S5, SI, S4, blue, SIreg, SI1*, red, and S6. 3.3.
    Construction and Simulation of SSC 3.3.1. Comparison of the Training Process of
    Each Model This study employed three machine learning techniques—RF, PLSR, and
    BPNN—and deep learning Transformer methods to develop soil salt inversion models.
    Each model utilized eight spectral variables with strong correlations as input
    features, and the SSC was generated through simulation transformation. Figure
    7 illustrates the line charts depicting the predictions of these four models.
    As depicted in Figure 7, all four models exhibited a specific capability in SSC
    inversion. Nevertheless, they tended to underestimate soil samples with a high
    salt content and overestimate the inversion of individual low-salinity soils,
    indicating a consistent trend of best-fitting most samples with moderate salinity.
    Notably, among these models, the Transformer model’s predicted values closely
    align with the measured values, showcasing the highest level of accuracy. Figure
    7. Line charts of the prediction models: (a) RF model; (b) PLSR model; (c) BPNN
    model; (d) Transformer model. 3.3.2. Precision Comparison of Each Model By comparing
    the precision evaluation metrics of each model during training (Table 4), it becomes
    evident that the Transformer model exhibited the highest prediction accuracy and
    maintained remarkable stability. The order of RMSE and MAE in the training and
    test datasets is as follows: Transformer < RF < BPNN < PLSR. While the MRE and
    MBE were at their lowest in both the training and test datasets for the Transformer
    model, the PLSR error was the highest. Interestingly, the MRE and MBE for the
    BP neural network model in the training set were smaller than those for the RF
    model, which contradicts the comparison results observed in the test set. The
    R2 value for the Transformer model in both the training and test datasets exceeded
    0.8, indicating a strong and positive correlation. Table 4. Evaluation index of
    each model. The R2 was chosen as the evaluation metric for the loss function,
    and the evolving state of the loss function during the training process of each
    model was visualized (Figure 8). The model’s stability degree was observed to
    be in the order of Transformer > BPNN > RF > PLSR. Among these models, the PLSR
    model exhibited significant fluctuations and the poorest convergence effect. The
    RF model demonstrated better convergence than the PLSR model but exhibited noticeable
    fluctuations. In contrast, the BPNN and the Transformer models exhibited faster
    convergence and reduced fluctuations. However, the Transformer model achieved
    a significantly superior fitting effect compared to the BPNN model. Figure 8.
    Loss changes of each model. 3.3.3. Evaluation of Soil Salinity Accuracy in Different
    Periods To investigate the impact of various sampling periods on the Transformer
    model’s prediction of SSC, the accuracy of SSC was assessed for eight different
    sampling periods. The Transformer model generated predicted values for the SSC
    during these periods. The evaluation involved utilizing the R2 metric to compare
    the model’s accuracy further. This analysis is visually represented in Figure
    9. Based on the scatter plots presented in Figure 9, it is evident that the model’s
    accuracy before the spring irrigations in 2022 and 2023 (R2 ranging from 0.826
    to 0.899) surpassed that during the budding, flowering, and maturity stages (R2
    ranging from 0.668 to 0.821). This suggests that the inversion effect of the bare
    soil stage on the SSC outperformed that of the crop cover stage. When comparing
    the model accuracy across the three crop coverage periods, it was observed that
    for both years, the order of the accuracy was budding stage > maturity stage >
    flowering stage. However, the crop coverage degree followed the opposite pattern,
    with the order being budding stage < maturity stage < flowering stage. This suggests
    an inverse relationship between crop coverage degree and model accuracy. In other
    words, as the crop coverage degree increased, the model’s prediction accuracy
    decreased. Figure 9. Scatterplot of the SSC accuracy for each period: (a) before

    4.1. RE Band of UAV Remote Sensing Utilized for Soil Salinity Inversion This study
    introduced the concept of the RE band. Building upon its strong correlation with
    the spectral attributes of vegetation canopies and its sensitivity to soil salinity
    [30], the spectral index was enhanced using the RE band to accomplish soil salinity
    inversion beneath vegetation cover. During the correlation analysis between single-band
    reflectance and SSC, it was observed that the absolute correlation coefficient
    of the red-edge spectral indices, including the RE band, ranged from 0.50 to 0.55.
    This finding offers robust evidence for enhancing the precision of uncrewed aerial
    vehicle remote sensing monitoring. The incorporation of RE bands has been shown
    to enhance the accuracy of soil salinity monitoring, as substantiated by research
    by numerous scholars. For instance, in multiple studies, Zhao et al. [31,32] utilized
    input variables, such as the RE band, to model under vegetation cover. They achieved
    R2 values of 0.75 and 0.71, respectively. This reaffirms that multispectral remote
    sensing of UAVs equipped with the red-edge band can accurately invert the soil
    salt content under vegetation cover. Cui et al. [33] integrated machine learning,
    deep learning, and UAV remote sensing to enhance the accuracy of predicting soil
    salinization during periods of vegetation cover. They employed various vegetation
    indices, such as NDVI, RVI, and ARVI, including the RE band, to enhance the soil
    salinity inversion rate under vegetation cover. Three models were developed for
    comparative analysis. Their findings indicate that the deep learning model using
    artificial neural networks (ANNs) yielded the most significant improvement in
    soil salinity inversion, achieving an R2 value of 0.79. 4.2. Comparison and Optimization
    of Soil Salinity Inversion Models Researchers typically employ a combination of
    UAV remote sensing and machine learning models to attain precise and efficient
    regional-scale soil salinity data acquisition. Mukhamediev et al. [34] utilized
    an optimized spectral index for soil salinity prediction, employing various machine
    learning algorithms, including XGBoost, LightGBM, RF, support vector machine,
    and ridge regression. Their findings indicated that the XGB regression model exhibited
    the most favorable performance, achieving coefficients of determination of up
    to 0.701. Muratov et al. [35] integrated four machine learning techniques—Gaussian
    mixture model (GMM), RF, support vector machine (SVM), and K-nearest neighbors
    (KNN)—with remote sensing technology in their study to enhance the precision of
    soil salinity monitoring. Wang et al. [36] employed Sentinel-1A synthetic aperture
    radar (SAR) imagery along with machine learning algorithms, including RFR, multiple
    linear regression (MLR), and support vector regression (SVR), for investigating
    variations in soil moisture and salinity. Their analysis revealed that the SVR
    model exhibited the highest level of accuracy (R2 = 0.77) and served as a crucial
    tool for generating precise and efficient soil–water distribution maps. Thus,
    this study integrated the PLSR, RF, and BPNN machine learning methods with UAV
    remote sensing images to investigate salinized soil in the test area. The findings
    reveal that the BPNN model exhibited the highest stability. As research deepens,
    scholars have gradually discovered that while machine learning methods exhibit
    robust learning and generalization capabilities, they are encumbered by complexities
    in model structure and calculation processes, a lack of unified criteria for internal
    function selection and parameter settings, and have challenges in comprehending
    internal operational mechanisms. Many scholars have proposed improvements to the
    inversion model to rectify these shortcomings and enhance the predictive precision
    and stability of soil salinity inversion models. Therefore, enhancing the inversion
    model has become imperative to rectify this deficiency and enhance soil salinity
    inversion models’ prediction accuracy and stability. Zhou et al. [37] enhanced
    the performance of support vector machines through three optimization techniques:
    gray wolf optimization, particle swarm optimization, and point difference evolution.
    They then integrated this optimized model with remote sensing technology to enhance
    the precision of soil salinity prediction in the Aibi Lake region. Lei et al.
    [38] conducted a comparative analysis involving distributed random forest (DRF),
    gradient boosting machine (GBM), and deep learning models to investigate the inversion
    of SSC in sunflower fields. Their findings revealed that the deep learning model
    attained the highest accuracy level, with R2 and normalized root mean square error
    (NRMSE) values of 0.61 and 0.28, respectively. Hence, this study introduces a
    deep learning Transformer model to address the limitations of machine learning
    when integrated with UAV remote sensing technology for soil salt inversion. Furthermore,
    the accuracy of the soil inversion was compared among the Transformer model, RF
    model, BPNN model, and PLSR model. The results reveal that the Transformer model
    exhibited the smallest RMSE, MAE, MRE, and MBE errors for the training and test
    datasets. Additionally, all determination coefficients, R2, exceeded 0.8, indicating
    the highest model accuracy and a remarkably stable prediction process. 4.3. Accuracy
    and Reasons of Soil Salinity Inversion Model in Different Growth Stages of Crops
    This study yielded positive outcomes in SSC inversion across various periods.
    Notably, the reflectance before spring irrigation surpasses that during the crop
    cover stages (budding stage, flowering stage, and maturity stage). This disparity
    can be attributed to the spring’s freezing and thawing cycle before irrigation,
    leading to intensified evaporation and subsequent accumulation of soil salts.
    Consequently, the degree of soil salinization escalates, enhancing spectral reflection
    [39]. The soil salinization in the study area gradually diminished because of
    various improvement measures, including sunflower planting during the budding,
    flowering, and maturity stages, along with irrigation, salt washing, and applying
    organic fertilizer [40]. Salt-tolerant crops like sunflowers play a vital role
    in salt absorption from the soil. Through root penetration, they promote soil
    aeration and drainage, leading to improvements in soil structure and a reduction
    in soil salinity. Irrigation salt washing involves completely dissolving soil
    salt into underground water and drainage through concealed pipes. This method
    aims to reduce the SSC and control groundwater levels. Applying organic fertilizer
    can enhance soil physical properties, boost soil aggregate formation, alleviate
    soil compaction, facilitate the migration and decomposition of soil salt, and
    mitigate salt-related issues in salinized soil. The inversion accuracy of the
    SSC during the bare soil period surpasses that during the crop cover period due
    to the absence of ice, snow, and crop cover on the surface [41]. Remote sensing
    images can more accurately depict surface information during the bare soil period.
    As the degree of crop cover increases, the model’s predictive accuracy diminishes.
    Because of the presence of crop cover, shadows can form on the surface, introducing
    a shadowing effect on optical signals and hindering their complete penetration.
    Specifically, dense crop cover, like sunflowers, can also lead to multiple scatterings
    of microwave signals, resulting in a more intricate signal reflection within vegetated
    regions. This complexity amplifies the challenge of precisely extracting the SSC.
    Nevertheless, it maintains a robust correlation (R2 > 0.668) and effectively mirrors
    the salinization status in line with field investigations. Nevertheless, constrained
    by experimental conditions, this study solely investigated soil salt dynamics
    during sunflower growth in the field. Further research is warranted to examine
    soil salt variations under alternative vegetation coverages. Additionally, there
    needs to be more clarity in sampling depth, data collection timing, and geographical
    settings within the study area, raising questions about the applicability of these
    findings to sunflower soil salt inversion in other regions. Validation through
    future work is imperative. 5. Conclusions Utilizing multispectral data from UAV,
    rapid and precise monitoring and inversion of soil salinization in cultivated
    areas, specifically focusing on a sunflower field within the irrigation zone along
    the southern banks of China’s Yellow River, were accomplished. This monitoring
    encompassed the periods before spring irrigation and various crop coverage stages.
    The soil salinity inversion models were created by integrating multispectral remote
    sensing data gathered by a UAV, a Transformer deep learning model, and three conventional
    machine learning techniques. The most effective SSC inversion model was selected
    based on an evaluation of both the accuracy and stability. The RE band can enhance
    the correlation (r > 0.5) between UAV remote-sensing images and soil salinity.
    The constructed transformer, RF, BPNN, and PLSR models all demonstrated favorable
    inversion outcomes. Among them, the Transformer model stood out, with the training
    and test sets’ R2 values exceeding 0.8, making it the most stable and accurate
    prediction model. Comparing the accuracy of the soil salinity at different periods,
    it Is observed that the inversion effectiveness of the SSC during the bare soil
    period surpassed that during the crop cover period. Furthermore, an inverse relationship
    existed between the extent of the crop cover and model accuracy. In summary, using
    the Transformer deep learning inversion model, in conjunction with the RE band
    within UAV multispectral data, enhanced the precision of field-scale soil salinity
    inversion and monitoring within the irrigated region on the southern shores of
    the Yellow River. This approach offers a scientifically sound management methodology
    for accurately predicting SSC in the future within the irrigated area of the southern
    shores of the Yellow River. Additionally, it serves as a valuable reference for
    utilizing UAV multispectral data. Author Contributions Methodology, Y.W.; Software,

  description: 'Almonds are becoming a central element in the gastronomic and food
    industry worldwide. Over the last few years, almond production has increased globally.
    Portugal has become the third most important producer in Europe, where this increasing
    trend is particularly evident. However, the susceptibility of almond trees to
    changing climatic conditions presents substantial risks, encompassing yield reduction
    and quality deterioration. Hence, yield forecasts become crucial for mitigating
    potential losses and aiding decisionmakers within the agri-food sector. Recent
    technological advancements and new data analysis techniques have led to the development
    of more suitable methods to model crop yields. Herein, an innovative approach
    to predict almond yields in the Trás-os-Montes region of Portugal was developed,
    by using machine learning regression models (i.e., the random forest regressor,
    XGBRegressor, gradient boosting regressor, bagging regressor, and AdaBoost regressor),
    coupled with remote sensing data obtained from different satellite platforms.
    Satellite data from both proprietary and free platforms at different spatial resolutions
    were used as features in the study (i.e., the GSMP: 11.13 km, Terra: 1 km, Landsat

    of features was analyzed and hyperparameter tuning was applied to enhance the
    prediction accuracy. Our results suggest that high-resolution data (PlanetScope)
    combined with irrigation information, vegetation indices, and climate data significantly

    Abstract Almonds are becoming a central element in the gastronomic and food industry
    worldwide. Over the last few years, almond production has increased globally.
    Portugal has become the third most important producer in Europe, where this increasing
    trend is particularly evident. However, the susceptibility of almond trees to
    changing climatic conditions presents substantial risks, encompassing yield reduction
    and quality deterioration. Hence, yield forecasts become crucial for mitigating
    potential losses and aiding decisionmakers within the agri-food sector. Recent
    technological advancements and new data analysis techniques have led to the development
    of more suitable methods to model crop yields. Herein, an innovative approach
    to predict almond yields in the Trás-os-Montes region of Portugal was developed,
    by using machine learning regression models (i.e., the random forest regressor,
    XGBRegressor, gradient boosting regressor, bagging regressor, and AdaBoost regressor),
    coupled with remote sensing data obtained from different satellite platforms.
    Satellite data from both proprietary and free platforms at different spatial resolutions
    were used as features in the study (i.e., the GSMP: 11.13 km, Terra: 1 km, Landsat
    8: 30 m, Sentinel-2: 10 m, and PlanetScope: 3 m). The best possible combination
    of features was analyzed and hyperparameter tuning was applied to enhance the
    prediction accuracy. Our results suggest that high-resolution data (PlanetScope)
    combined with irrigation information, vegetation indices, and climate data significantly
    improves almond yield prediction. The XGBRegressor model performed best when using
    PlanetScope data, reaching a coefficient of determination (R2) of 0.80. However,
    alternative options using freely available data with lower spatial resolution,
    such as GSMaP and Terra MODIS LST, also showed satisfactory performance (R2 =
    0.68). This study highlights the potential of integrating machine learning models
    and remote sensing data for accurate crop yield prediction, providing valuable
    insights for informed decision support in the almond sector, contributing to the
    resilience and sustainability of this crop in the face of evolving climate dynamics.
    Keywords: Prunus dulcis; machine learning; regression models; multispectral data;
    vegetation indices; remote sensing 1. Introduction The almond tree, Prunus dulcis
    (var. dulcis (Rosaceae)), is a globally important nut tree [1]. Originating from
    the Middle East and South Asia, almonds are extremely important for the human
    diet due to their high protein content, good fats, and essential micronutrients,
    including vitamin E and magnesium. Moreover, almond consumption provides diverse
    health benefits, from improving cholesterol levels and cardiovascular health,
    to potentially reducing cancer risks [2]. Almond production is very important
    for the economy in many regions of the world [3]. Almonds are mainly produced
    in the United States of America (1,858,010 tons), Australia (360,328 tons), and
    Spain (245,990 tons) [4]. Climate change poses significant risks to crop yields,
    due to changing weather patterns and more regular risky weather events, such as
    floods, droughts, and heat waves [5]. These events can have a negative impact
    on almond productivity and quality [6], compromising stock supplies and promoting
    price fluctuations. Given these circumstances, precise crop yield prediction has
    become indispensable, as it equips policymakers and market participants with essential
    tools to effectively mitigate these risks. Through the analysis of historical
    data and current agricultural conditions, it becomes possible to develop models
    for estimating seasonal yield forecasts and evaluating potential supply shortages
    or surpluses [7]. Furthermore, this information may assist governmental agencies
    in making informed decisions regarding trade policies, food aid, and agricultural
    investments [8]. Crop yield prediction is a difficult undertaking that requires
    integrating several factors, including weather, soil properties, pest and disease
    incidence, and management practices [9]. More precise modelling techniques for
    forecasting agricultural yield have recently been developed, due to developments
    in technology and data analysis. Simple statistical models (i.e., linear regressions)
    remain the most popular approach for predicting agricultural yield, providing
    helpful information for decisionmakers [10]. However, machine learning (ML) algorithms
    have become a promising approach, as they can increase prediction accuracy by
    finding patterns and relationships in the data [11]. Due to these facts, machine
    learning (ML) is currently one of the most important subfields of artificial intelligence
    (AI) [12]. Remote sensing (RS) is another promising field of research that may
    potentially benefit crop yield prediction. Advances in RS technologies have made
    it possible to monitor crop development and health in real time from aerial viewpoints,
    which has enhanced crop production forecasting. RS technologies provide detailed
    information on the crop conditions, including plant biomass, water content, and
    nutrient status, which can be utilized to make more precise predictions about
    future yields [13]. Numerous studies emphasize the significance of ML and RS in
    predicting crop yield. Klompenburg et al. [14] developed a systematic literature
    review to detect prevalent models, features, and evaluation parameters in crop
    yield prediction. The authors observed that linear regression (LR) and neural
    networks (NN) are frequently applied models, along with random forest (RF) and
    support vector machines (SVM). Moreover, rainfall, temperature, and soil type
    are the main features implemented, along with vegetation indices (VIs), such as
    the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) [15] and the enhanced vegetation
    index (EVI) [16]. Ali et al. [17] highlighted the application of various RS technologies
    alongside multi- and hyperspectral data, radar, and LiDAR data in crop monitoring
    and yield prediction. They identified the NDVI, the EVI, and the soil-adjusted
    vegetation index (SAVI) [18] as commonly used VIs. Similarly, Escolà et al. [19]
    evaluated the application of Sentinel-2 derived VIs, such as the NDVI, the wide
    dynamic range vegetation index (WDRVI), the green–red vegetation index (GRVI),
    and the green normalized difference vegetation index (GNDVI), for estimating barley
    production. Regarding almond yield prediction using RS data, two studies have
    emerged. Zhang et al. [20] applied ML models to satellite (Landsat 8) and aerial
    imagery to forecast almond yield from orchards in California. They achieved a
    coefficient of determination (R2) of 0.71 for early and mid-season predictions
    using stochastic gradient boosting (SGB). Tang et al. [21], also in the context
    of California, explored the use of deep learning (DL) methods, using unmanned
    aerial vehicle (UAV) data, and developed a convolutional neural network (CNN).
    Their model obtained an R2 of 0.96 and a low error of 6.6% for tree-level almond
    yield estimation, emphasizing the significant potential of DL for precise tree-level
    yield prediction. Although the abovementioned studies exhibit strong results in
    forecasting almond yield, they are tailored to California [20,21] and, as far
    as we know, there is a notable absence of research specifically dedicated to Portuguese
    almond yield forecasting. Despite the growing importance of almond cultivation
    in this country, this absence represents a critical gap in our understanding of
    the factors that influence almond yields in this region. The current research
    seeks to fill this research gap by developing a method for predicting almond yields
    in the TM region of Portugal, using ML regression models, and identifying the
    key factors that significantly influence almond yields. Furthermore, an improvement
    on previous studies may be the analysis of RS data from a diverse range of platforms,
    including freely available medium-resolution data and proprietary higher resolution
    data. This strategic combination may be used to investigate the effectiveness
    of medium-resolution RS platforms, compared to their higher resolution counterparts,
    for predicting almond yields. This information could potentially be used by sector
    stakeholders to enhance the decision-making process, enabling more informed and
    strategic choices for optimizing cultivation practices, resource allocation, and
    overall productivity. Considering the research gaps identified, the purpose of
    this study is 4-fold: (1) to use state-of-the-art ML regression models to accurately
    simulate the yield from several orchards in the TM region; (2) to integrate RS
    data from different platforms at different spatial resolutions, including from
    both open and proprietary platforms; (3) to identify the key features that significantly
    influence these predictions; and (4) to discuss potential applications of these
    findings in the sector. 2. Materials and Methods 2.1. Study Area In this study
    multiple almond orchards (AO) are included, from four distinct almond growers
    (AGs) within the TM region of northern Portugal. Regarding AO1, AO2, and AO3,
    these are located in the Torre de Moncorvo municipality. Regarding AO4, this is
    located between the Vila Flor and Alfândega da Fé municipalities (Figure 1a).
    These orchards present different characteristics, namely AO1 has 5.7 hectares
    with 1387 almond trees; AO2 has 2.9 hectares with 765 almond trees; AO3 has 3.0
    hectares with 756 almond trees; and AO4, the largest area, has 12.3 hectares with
    3198 almond trees. Figure 1. Overview of the location of the almond orchards,
    for each almond grower (AG) (a), and (b) the yield values, from 2017 to 2021,
    presented in kg/ha, for each AG. This region of TM is mountainous and presents
    warm and dry summers and moderately cold and wet winters [22]. These characteristics
    are typical of the Mediterranean climate, which makes the region suitable for
    almond cultivation. Considering the yield levels recorded from 2017 to 2021, AO4
    and AO3 had the highest productivity, averaging 1041 kg/ha and 785 kg/ha, respectively,
    while AO1 and AO2 had lower productivity with an average of 462 kg/ha and 372
    kg/ha, respectively, in the same period (Figure 1b). 2.2. Data Collection and
    Processing The data processing workflow consists of four sequential steps (Figure
    2). In the first step, the data acquired from various sources is collected, including
    the agronomic parameters, vegetation indices, and climate data (identified in
    the following subsections). The second step involves the integration of various
    features into a dataset comprising 171 features. The third step includes the application
    of ML regression models, which includes the feature selection process, the selection
    of ML regression models, and hyperparameter optimization. In the fourth step,
    the model evaluation is conducted. The details of the four-step approach are provided
    in the subsequent subsections. Figure 2. Data processing workflow stages: (1)
    data collection; (2) dataset creation; (3) application of machine learning (ML)
    models; and (4) model evaluation. 2.2.1. Agronomic Data The agronomic data contains
    several parameters collected from each site. In addition to yield data (the target
    feature), yearly irrigation information was also acquired from each grower, recorded
    as binary values (0 for no irrigation and 1 for irrigation). Irrigation is recognized
    as a vital factor that significantly influences the optimal growth and development
    of trees, consequently affecting crop productivity [23]. The availability and
    efficient distribution of water directly affects physiological processes, such
    as transpiration and nutrient uptake, which are critical for trees to reach their
    full yield potential. Moreover, appropriate irrigation practices can help alleviate
    the adverse effects of environmental stressors, such as droughts or heat waves,
    which are becoming increasingly prevalent due to climate change [24]. Furthermore,
    data regarding the average tree age (plantation date) were incorporated as a feature
    of the dataset. The age of almond trees is of paramount importance for productivity,
    as older trees tend to have more extensive root systems, established canopies,
    and enhanced nutrient storage, leading to increased almond production and increased
    overall orchard yield [20]. The data were pre-processed for each orchard separately
    to filter the outliers, based on distribution analysis. 2.2.2. Remote Sensing
    Data Several RS data from various platforms with different spatial resolutions
    were considered (Table 1). The Global Satellite Mapping of Precipitation (GSMaP)
    by the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency (JAXA) was used, which provides global
    precipitation data using a combination of sensors at ~11 km [25]. It was developed
    in Japan specifically for the GPM mission [26]. The Land Surface Temperature (LST)
    from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS), operated by the
    National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA), was obtained at a resolution
    of 1 km [27]. It should be noted that the thermal sensor in the MODIS only offers
    1 km resolution. Landsat 8, operated by NASA and the United States Geological
    Survey (USGS), offers multispectral data at a resolution of 30 m [28]. Land cover
    classification and analysis of vegetation are potential applications of these
    data. Sentinel-2 was developed by the European Space Agency (ESA) and provides
    multispectral imagery at a resolution of 10 m. This is the best resolution imagery
    available for free today [29]. PlanetScope, which is a proprietary data source,
    is formed of several small satellites (constellation), operated by Planet Labs
    Inc., designed for high-frequency global imaging of Earth. The satellites acquire
    imagery in the visible and near-infrared spectra and provide a spatial resolution
    of 3 m. The proprietary high-resolution data provided by PlanetScope enables detailed
    mapping and monitoring of various features, including urban areas, vegetation
    dynamics, and environmental changes [30]. Table 1. Remote sensing platform overview:
    sensors, bands, spatial resolutions, and revisiting time. Monthly composites from
    GSMaP, MODIS Terra LST, Landsat 8, and Sentinel-2 (from 2017 to 2021) were computed
    using the Google Earth Engine (GEE). The GEE is an online infrastructure that
    archives satellite imagery and geospatial data, offering powerful analytics tools,
    leveraging cloud-based infrastructure. These benefits make it an invaluable tool
    for exploring Earth’s dynamics and supporting fact-based decision making [31].
    On the other hand, PlanetScope’s monthly composites were acquired using the Planet
    Explorer platform, which is a fully automated, cloud-based imaging and analysis
    platform that grants users access to comprehensive, daily data from the PlanetScope
    and SkySat constellations. 2.2.3. Vegetation Indices Computation VIs were also
    included in the feature dataset, namely the enhanced vegetation index 2 (EVI2),
    the GRVI, the NDVI, and the SAVI (Table 2). The use of the EVI2 in crop yield
    prediction models is justified by its many advantages, and has been shown to achieve
    higher prediction accuracy compared to other VIs, such as the NDVI [32]. It also
    offers higher sensitivity, especially in areas with high biomass, and provides
    valuable information on crop conditions and yields [33,34]. Regarding the GRVI,
    it is often used as a phenological indicator, detecting changes in canopy vegetation
    [35]. Moreover, in a study by Sanches et al. [36], the GRVI showed a high correlation
    with sugarcane yields. Concerning the NDVI, it can be implemented to monitor crop
    growth, detect plant stress, and make decisions regarding irrigation, fertilization,
    pesticide application, and has also been employed in numerous studies to accurately
    predict crop yields [37,38]. The SAVI, in turn, is also a suitable VI for use
    in yield prediction models, since it attempts to minimize the effects of soil
    brightness using a correction factor [39]. It is similar to the NDVI, but accounts
    for variations in soils, making it useful in arid and semi-arid regions, where
    vegetation cover is low and soil brightness can significantly affect vegetation
    detection [40]. Furthermore, in a study by da Silva et al. [41], the SAVI had
    the highest correlation with soybean grain yield, possibly due to the use of the
    soil effect correction, demonstrating its ability to predict crop yields. Table

    G: green; L = 0.5; N: near infrared; R: red. As previously mentioned, three different
    platforms, each with varying spatial resolutions, were used to obtain the VIs
    (Section 2.2.2). The data from each platform were processed, and atmospheric corrections
    were implemented before it became available. The data for each orchard were obtained
    using the geospatial data abstraction library (GDAL) in Python to calculate the
    mean value for each grower. Figure 3 illustrates the above-described procedure,
    by displaying an example of the NDVI computed for the three VI platforms, in March
    2019. Figure 3a–c depicts the NDVI images, with the spatial resolution associated
    with each platform. They were then subjected to a mean calculation, yielding a
    singular value that was then used in the creation of the final dataset. These
    three VI datasets were produced to compare the performance of the Landsat 8, Sentinel-2,
    and PlanetScope data. Figure 3. Example of the procedure for creating the dataset.
    The values correspond to the mean NDVI calculated for (a) Landsat 8, (b) Sentinel-2,
    and (c) PlanetScope (e.g., March 2019), corresponding to almond grower 3. 2.3.
    Dataset Creation The final dataset is created using three different groups: climate
    data, VIs, and agronomic data. As mentioned in Section 2.2.3, the three datasets
    were used in parallel with the VIs customized according to the RS platform (Landsat
    8, Sentinel-2, and PlanetScope) to compare the performance of each. This information,
    extracted for each orchard, was then used as potential inputs into the ML regression
    models. Each of the datasets contained 171 features, corresponding to the average
    tree age, irrigation, monthly mean daytime temperature (2017–2021), monthly mean
    nighttime temperature (2017–2021), monthly accumulated precipitation (2017–2021),
    monthly EVI2 (2017–2021), monthly GRVI (2017–2021), monthly NDVI (2017–2021),
    and monthly SAVI (2017–2021). To consider the potential effect of alternate bearing
    (biannual cyclic production patterns), features from the previous year were also
    included to assess their potential impact on the following year’s production.
    In addition to features, the datasets also included the yield (mean kg per ha)
    as a target. 2.4. Application of Machine Learning Regression Models The application
    of ML regression models followed a three-step process: feature selection, model
    implementation, and hyperparameter tuning (detailed in the following subsections).
    In the feature selection phase, relevant features were carefully chosen to enhance
    the model’s accuracy and performance. Subsequently, the regression models were
    implemented using a cross-validation methodology, establishing a connection between
    the input features and the target feature. The final step involved optimizing
    the hyperparameters to fine tune the models to improve the predictive accuracy
    and generalization capability. 2.4.1. Feature Selection Process Feature selection
    plays a key role in the ML pipeline. Selecting the most suitable features improves
    the model’s performance, reduces computational efforts, and assists in the interpretation
    of the results. By selecting the most relevant features, more accurate, efficient,
    and interpretable models can be achieved, facilitating better decision making
    and a better understanding of the underlying data patterns. Herein, for the selection
    of the best possible features, the bestFeatures script [43] was used. This is
    a tool for identifying the best possible combination of features for fitting a
    ML model. This method uses cross-validation (CV) to evaluate different feature
    subsets and their corresponding performance scores (R2). The CV method partitions
    the dataset into training and testing subsets, multiple times (folds). For each
    fold, part of the dataset (testing) is always unseen by the algorithm. It then
    computes the cross-validated score for each combination of features and tracks
    the maximum score achieved, effectively controlling the problem of overfitting.
    The method also ensures a low level of correlation related to the features. The
    output of the method includes the R2 score and error metrics, corresponding to
    the best feature combination. For the current analysis, this method was used considering
    a 5-fold CV, and a combination of 1 to 8 features, determined by the script’s
    best performing approach. The analysis was performed separately for each dataset
    (agronomic features, climate features, and VIs, from the three different platforms),
    as well as for mixed datasets (e.g., climate features + VIs), depending on the
    vegetation data acquisition platform. Table 3 lists the selected features, according
    to the type of features considered. Table 3. Selected features using bestFeatures
    script, categorized by feature type. CD: climate data; DT: daytime temperature;
    Irrig.: irrigation; L8: Landsat 8; LY: last year; NT: nighttime temperature; PS:
    PlanetScope; S2: Sentinel-2; VI: vegetation indice. 2.4.2. Machine Learning Regression
    Model Selection Several ML regression models were applied to predict almond yield.
    Among these models, the random forest regressor (RFR) stands out as a prominent
    option due to its effectiveness in supervised learning [44], and it is used in
    many fields of study. The RFR algorithm generates an ensemble of decision trees,
    collectively called an RF. Each decision tree independently learns patterns and
    relationships within the data, contributing equally to the final prediction, improving
    the performance and efficacy of the model and dealing with potential overfitting
    problems [44]. The XGBRegressor (XGBR) was also implemented in this study and
    is a supervised learning algorithm that belongs to the gradient boosting family.
    It employs a boosting technique that sequentially improves decision trees, to
    create a powerful ensemble model [45]. XGBR optimizes the training objective through
    gradient descent, allowing it to effectively identify complex patterns and dependencies
    in the data. The model has shown remarkable performance in several areas, making
    it a valuable tool for almond yield prediction [45]. Regarding the gradient boosting
    regressor (GBR) algorithm, it is also a gradient boosting-based regression model.
    It iteratively builds an ensemble of decision trees, with each successive tree
    better than the previous ones, creating a strong predictive model. The GBR model
    is widely used in predictive analytics and has demonstrated its efficiency and
    potential for predicting almond yield [46]. The bagging regressor (BR) algorithm,
    on the other hand, uses a bagging technique similar to the RFR model. It generates
    an ensemble of decision trees by resampling the training data and fitting each
    sample to a separate tree, which are combined to form the final output. Its ability
    to handle high-dimensional data and complex relationships makes it a suitable
    candidate for almond yield prediction [47]. Lastly, the AdaBoost regressor (ABR)
    algorithm is a boosting-based regression model that iteratively adjusts the weights
    assigned to the training instances, placing more emphasis on the samples that
    are difficult to predict accurately. ABR is known for its adaptability to different
    data types and its ability to handle noisy or incomplete datasets [48]. The ML
    regression models were implemented using the Python library Scikit-learn [49].
    2.4.3. Hyperparameter Tuning Following the selection of the best feature combination,
    the ML models were applied using hyperparameter tuning. This method may significantly
    improve the performance of ML regression models [50] by adjusting each model’s
    internal parameters, such as the learning rate and tree depth. In this study,
    a systematic approach for hyperparameter tuning was employed, utilizing the GridSearchCV
    method with a 5-fold CV. Again, 5-fold cross-validation further ensures robustness
    by splitting the dataset into five subdivisions, using four for training and one
    for validation in a rotating fashion. This iterative process allows the model
    to be trained and validated multiple times, always withholding the testing data
    from the algorithm, providing a robust assessment of its performance across various
    hyperparameter settings. The method examines several hypotheses and identifies
    the optimal hyperparameters, based on the performance of the models, considering
    the R2 results. This approach aims to maximize the predictive accuracy of the
    ML regression models. The specific hyperparameters applied in the implementation
    of the regression models are identified in Table 4. Table 4. Main hyperparameters
    considered during regression models implementation. Tested hyperparameter values:
    n_estimators (NE): 100, 200, 300; max_depth (MD): 3, 5, 7, 9, 1; max_samples (MS):
    0.5, 0.75, 1.0; learning_rate (LR): 0.1, 1.0, 10. CD: climate data; Irrig.: irrigation;
    L8: Landsat 8; PS: PlanetScope; S2: Sentinel-2; VI: vegetation indice. 2.5. Model
    Evaluation Several well-known metrics to evaluate regression model performance
    were used, including the coefficient of determination (R2), the root mean square
    error (RMSE), and the mean absolute error (MAE). R2 measures the percentage of
    variance in the dependent variable that can be described by the independent variables
    in a regression model [51]. The RMSE accounts for positive and negative deviations
    between predicted and observed values. Regarding the MAE, it is calculated as
    the average of the absolute differences between the predicted and observed values
    of the dependent variable. The average magnitude of errors performed by the model
    is measured in the units of the same order as that of the dependent variable and
    denoted as the MAE. While the RMSE takes the squared differences into account,
    the MAE does not which makes it robust in regard to outliers and insensitive to
    extreme errors. By considering the mean absolute difference between the observed
    and simulated values, the MAE provides the overall accuracy of the model, regardless
    of the direction of the errors [52]. 3. Results 3.1. Comparative Analysis of Regression
    Models for Almond Yield Prediction This study intends to investigate and compare
    the performance of several ML regression models in predicting almond tree yield,
    based on different features extracted from RS platforms and different agronomic
    parameters. The features considered were irrigation, temperature, precipitation,
    and VIs. The regression models evaluated included the RFR, XGBR, GBR, BR, and
    ABR models. Figure 4 shows the performance of the regression models, using different
    types of features, considering the VIs computed by PlanetScope (Figure 4a), Sentinel-2
    (Figure 4b), and Landsat 8 (Figure 4c). When focusing on the irrigation feature
    alone, none of the models demonstrated exceptional performance as a standalone
    feature across all three platforms. The R2 scores for all the models ranged from
    0.32 to 0.38, suggesting limited predictive capabilities. When considering only
    the climatic features, the GBR model and BR model consistently exhibited higher
    performance, with R2 scores of around 0.40. For the VIs only, the ABR model outperformed
    the others, using PlanetScope data (R2 = 0.59). On the other hand, considering
    the VIs calculated using Sentinel-2 data, the BR model performed better (R2 =
    0.49). For the VIs from Landsat 8, the best performance was achieved by the RFR
    model (R2 = 0.61). When combining features, particularly irrigation and climate
    data, the RFR model consistently demonstrated strong performance across all three
    platforms (R2 = 0.68), indicating its superior predictive capabilities for this
    feature combination. Considering the combination of irrigation and VIs, the XGBR
    model obtained the best performance using PlanetScope (R2 = 0.76) and Sentinel-2
    (R2 = 0.66) data. In contrast, the GBR model produced the best result (R2 = 0.73)
    when the Landsat 8 data were used. Combining the climate data and VIs, the ABR
    model performed well using PlanetScope data (R2 = 0.61). On the other hand, the
    XGBR model performed better using the Sentinel-2 (R2 = 0.62) and Landsat 8 data
    (R2 = 0.69). Finally, considering all three groups of features combined (irrigation,
    climate data, and VIs), the XGBR model showed the best performance using PlanetScope
    data (R2 = 0.80), while the RFR model showed the best performance using Sentinel-2
    data (R2 = 0.67) and the ABR model using Landsat 8 data (R2 = 0.72). The results
    presented showed that the XGBR and RFR models proved to be the most appropriate
    models for predicting the target feature using the PlanetScope data across different
    feature combinations. However, when using Landsat 8 data, the ABR model also provided
    remarkable results. Figure 4. Regression model performance based on feature type
    and remote sensing platform, using the coefficient of determination (R2). In (a)
    vegetation indices were computed using PlanetScope data; in (b) vegetation indices
    were computed using Sentinel-2 data; and in (c) vegetation indices were computed
    using Landsat 8 data. The performance of several regression models was also evaluated
    based on MAE and RMSE metrics, considering the different combinations of feature
    types (Table 5). Notably, the best combination of features that yielded optimal
    results varied across the models. When focusing on the irrigation feature, all
    the models (RFR, XGBR, GBR, BR, and ABR) achieved similar performance, with MAE
    values ranging from 158 to 161 kg/ha and RMSE values ranging from 206 to 212 kg/ha.
    For the climate data features, the XGBR (MAE = 210 kg/ha; RMSE = 255 kg/ha) and
    BR (MAE = 184 kg/ha; RMSE = 238 kg/ha) models exhibited slightly higher values
    compared to the other models. Among the VIs, when the PlanetScope data were used,
    the best performance was achieved with the ABR model (MAE = 143 kg/ha; RMSE =
    186 kg/ha). For the Sentinel-2 data, the lowest MAE (165 kg/ha) was obtained with
    the BR model and the lowest RMSE (214 kg/ha) was obtained with the RFR model.
    Considering the VIs from Landsat 8, the lowest MAE (133 kg/ha) was obtained with
    the GBR model and the lowest RMSE (189 kg/ha) with the RFR model. Combining irrigation
    with climate data generally improved the model’s performance, compared to using
    either feature individually, resulting in lower MAE and RMSE values, ranging from
    116 to 137 kg/ha and 158 to 177 kg/ha, respectively. Similarly, incorporating
    all feature types tended to improve the model’s predictive performance, especially
    when using irrigation, climate data, and VIs from PlanetScope, which achieved
    the best performance with the XGBR model (MAE: 95 kg/ha; RMSE: 119 kg/ha). Table

    to Almond Yield Prediction Considering the information from the previous subsection,
    optimal performance was achieved with the XGBR model using the irrigation feature,
    climate data (specifically, the daytime temperature in March), and VIs (the NDVI
    in January and the SAVI in May) calculated using PlanetScope data. This subsection
    is intended to present the features that were important to almond yield prediction.
    Figure 5a shows that in the almond orchards where irrigation was applied (AG3
    and AG4), higher yield values were recorded, about 913 kg/ha, while in the almond
    orchards where irrigation was not applied (AG1 and AG2), lower yield values were
    recorded, about 417 kg/ha. Comparing the NDVI in January and the yield (Figure
    5b), it is possible to observe higher NDVI values related to a higher yield, although
    it is not a clear linear relationship. In the almond orchards of AG4 (Figure 1b),
    higher NDVI values were recorded in January from 2019 to 2021, which may have
    made a positive contribution to achieving higher production values compared to
    other growers. Similarly, regarding the SAVI in May (Figure 5c), it does not seem
    to be linearly associated with the yield, highlighting the importance of ML models,
    as non-linear patterns can be identified by these models. On the other hand, regarding
    the daytime temperature in March (Figure 5d), it is evident that lower values
    were associated with lower yield values. The lowest daytime temperature value
    in March (12.2 °C) was recorded in 2018 in the almond orchards of AG2, which coincided
    with the lowest yield value (82 kg/ha) compared to the other growers (Figure 1b).
    As for the highest values recorded for the daytime temperature in March, the maximum
    value reached was 22.5 °C in 2019 by AG4, who obtained higher yield values (1203
    kg/ha). Figure 5. Correlation charts on the yield with: (a) irrigation; (b) NDVI
    in January; (c) SAVI in May; and (d) daytime temperature in March, Celsius degrees
    (°C). 4. Discussion The present study aimed to develop ML models to simulate almond
    yields in the TM region, applying open and proprietary RS data. The comparison
    was made among various free RS platforms (MODIS Terra LST, GSMaP, Landsat 8, and
    Sentinel-2) and a paid one (PlanetScope). Several ML regression models (RFR, XGBR,
    GBR, BR, ABR) were applied, and the optimum feature combination was selected to
    achieve the best performance. The combination of irrigation data, daytime temperature
    in March, the NDVI in January, and the SAVI in May (from the PlanetScope platform)
    showed the best performance (R2 = 0.80), using the XGBR model. Indeed, the use
    of VIs with a higher resolution (3 m) from the PlanetScope data had a positive
    influence on the almond yield prediction, as the results obtained with Sentinel-2
    (R2 = 0.67—RFR) and Landsat 8 (R2 = 0.72—ABR) data were lower. However, it is
    worth noting that free data with lower resolution could also be a viable alternative
    to PlanetScope, particularly RS platforms providing climatic data, such as MODIS
    Terra LST and GSMaP, achieving an R2 of 0.68 when using the RFR model with irrigation
    and climate data. Regarding the XGBR model, it was observed that the best results
    were reached when using three groups of features (irrigation, climate data, and
    VIs) (R2 = 0.80). On the other hand, the XGBR model obtained inferior performance
    when using only irrigation information (R2: 0.32), only climate data (R2: 0.19),
    or only VIs (PlanetScope—R2 = 0.44). In this case, the RFR model achieved a higher
    level of performance than the XGBR model. This situation might be due to the XGBR
    model being more capable of handling complex relationships between features [45],
    while the RFR model is known to perform better with simpler features. Considering
    other studies related to almond yield prediction, Zhang et al. tested several
    ML models, obtaining the best performance with the SGB model, with an R2 of 0.71,
    which is also a boosting model [20]. Considering the most important features,
    irrigation and daytime temperature in March stood out, highlighting the role of
    water availability and suitable temperatures for almond yields [53]. In fact,
    AG3 and AG4 show higher yield values, due to the available irrigation. Furthermore,
    March is considered a crucial period for almond trees, as flowering occurs at
    this stage [54]. Almond trees are highly sensitive to climatic conditions during
    the flowering period, and adequate temperatures are essential for successful pollination
    and fruit development. According to Tamimi [54], the ideal temperature for almond
    tree flowering during the day is between 15 °C and 30 °C, and temperatures outside
    this range can lead to problems, resulting in reduced fruit production. In effect,
    daytime temperatures in March in the agricultural fields of AG2 were recorded,
    with a minimum temperature of 12.2 °C recorded in 2018, which is below the considered
    ideal temperature for almond flowering, which can explain the low production in
    that year (Supplementary Figure S1). On the other hand, in the agricultural fields
    of AG4, a maximum temperature of 22.5 °C was recorded in 2019, falling within
    the range of ideal temperatures for flowering, resulting in increased production
    that year. Similar studies have also highlighted temperature-related features.
    Zhang et al. [20] emphasized the importance of the feature “long-term mean maximum
    April-June temperature” in predicting almond production. According to the authors,
    this factor significantly affects the blooming period of almond trees. Almonds
    are sensitive to temperature fluctuations during this critical stage, and optimal
    temperatures promote successful pollination and higher yield. However, exceeding
    the temperature threshold can negatively impact pollination and reduce fruit set,
    leading to lower almond yield. Therefore, monitoring and considering the long-term
    mean maximum April-June temperature is essential for accurately predicting almond
    yield. Other studies, such as the study by Tombesi et al. [55], have also considered
    that warm springs accelerate fruit development. The intricate relationships unveiled
    throughout this analysis underscore the necessity of employing sophisticated ML
    models for understanding the dynamics influencing almond production. The interdependence
    of variables like irrigation, climate indicators, and vegetation indices highlights
    the need for advanced analytical tools, and the application of sophisticated machine
    learning (ML) models becomes imperative. Unlike simpler models, such as linear
    regression, which assume linear relationships between the variables, the complexities
    of almond production necessitate more sophisticated approaches. The utilization
    of advanced ML models, like the XGBR model applied in this study, allows for the
    exploration of intricate, non-linear relationships among various contributing
    factors. In the realm of almond production, where variables often exhibit non-linear
    dependencies, these models excel in discerning patterns that may elude simpler
    methodologies. Some limitations must be acknowledged. Optimal results were achieved
    through the utilization of a proprietary/paid platform, potentially limiting accessibility
    for certain users. Furthermore, the lower resolution of data provided by open
    platforms may impede the identification of smaller orchard areas. Nevertheless,
    our study underscores the viability of utilizing freely available remote sensing
    data. While the data were sourced from multiple farmers, expanding the dataset
    could enhance the robustness of our findings. Despite the abovementioned limitations,
    the current study methodology holds promise for adaptation and implementation
    in various agricultural settings worldwide. Another important point is the careful
    analysis of features to increase the overall performance of the ML regression
    models. In this way, this study not only allows for the prediction of almond yields,
    but also enables the identification of the key factors that significantly influence
    these predictions. Furthermore, the models developed allow the implementation
    of early prediction of seasonal almond yields, with the potential integration
    of climate data and extreme weather events. The comparison between open and proprietary
    RS data shows that these models can be implemented using these two types of datasets.
    As such, these results provide valuable insights for farmers and other sector
    stakeholders, in the decision-making process, which can enhance the sustainability
    of the almond sector in Portugal. 5. Conclusions This study investigates the potential
    of RS data and ML models for predicting almond yield. Various RS platforms were
    evaluated, including both freely available platforms, including MODIS Terra LST,
    GSMaP, Landsat 8, and Sentinel-2, as well as a paid platform, PlanetScope. In
    addition, the performance of several ML regressors, including RFR, XGBR, GBR,
    BR, and ABR, were evaluated. The inclusion of high-resolution VIs from the PlanetScope
    platform significantly increased the accuracy of almond yield prediction. The
    XGBR model trained with a feature set comprising irrigation data, the daily temperature
    in March, the NDVI in January, and the SAVI in May from the PlanetScope platform
    showed the highest predictive performance, achieving an R2 value of 0.80. This
    indicates that the model could effectively explain 80% of the variation in the
    almond yield. However, freely available RS platforms, such as MODIS Terra LST
    and GSMaP, can also serve as viable alternatives to PlanetScope data. Despite
    the lower spatial resolution, the data from these platforms demonstrated that
    it still provides valuable insights for predicting almond yield. It is worth noting,
    however, that the choice of ML model was found to be a critical factor in the
    prediction accuracy. While the XGBR model consistently outperformed the other
    models, it proved more prone to noise and outliers when only one or two types
    of features were used. Therefore, the selection of the most suitable ML algorithm
    should be based on the dataset and features to be considered. Irrigation and the
    daytime temperature in March were among the most important features for predicting
    almond yield, highlighting the pivotal role of water and temperature in crop growth
    and development. Future research may be aimed at the continuous improvement of
    the dataset implemented in this study, by increasing the number of almond orchards
    by considering broader geographical areas and including established climatic and
    temporal relationships with the yield in the evaluated orchards. This will improve
    the generalization ability of the models. It would also be useful to consider
    very-high resolution UAV multispectral data to provide tree-level almond yield.

  description: The accurate prediction of cropland evapotranspiration (ET) is of utmost
    importance for effective irrigation and optimal water resource management. To
    evaluate the feasibility and accuracy of ET estimation in various climatic conditions
    using machine learning models, three-, six-, and nine-factor combinations (V3,
    V6, and V9) were examined based on the data obtained from global cropland eddy
    flux sites and Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) remote sensing
    data. Four machine learning models, random forest (RF), support vector machine
    (SVM), extreme gradient boosting (XGB), and backpropagation neural network (BP),
    were used for this purpose. The input factors included daily mean air temperature
    (Ta), net radiation (Rn), soil heat flux (G), evaporative fraction (EF), leaf
    area index (LAI), photosynthetic photon flux density (PPFD), vapor pressure deficit
    (VPD), wind speed (U), and atmospheric pressure (P). The four machine learning
    models exhibited significant simulation accuracy across various climate zones,
    reflected by their global performance indicator (GPI) values ranging from −3.504
    to 0.670 for RF, −3.522 to 1.616 for SVM, −3.704 to 0.972 for XGB, and −3.654
    to 1.831 for BP. The choice of suitable models and the different input factors
    varied across different climatic regions. Specifically, in the temperate–continental
    zone (TCCZ), subtropical–Mediterranean zone (SMCZ), and temperate zone (TCZ),
    the models of BPC-V9, SVMS-V6, and SVMT-V6 demonstrated the highest simulation
    accuracy, with average RMSE values of 0.259, 0.373, and 0.333 mm d−1, average
    MAE values of 0.177, 0.263, and 0.248 mm d−1, average R2 values of 0.949, 0.819,
    and 0.917, and average NSE values of 0.926, 0.778, and 0.899, respectively. In
    climate zones with a lower average LAI (TCCZ), there was a strong correlation
    between LAI and ET, making LAI more crucial for ET predictions. Conversely, in
    climate zones with a higher average LAI (TCZ, SMCZ), the significance of the LAI
    for ET prediction was reduced. This study recognizes the impact of climate zones
    on ET simulations and highlights the necessity for region-specific considerations
    when selecting machine learning models and input factor combinations.

    a critical role in the terrestrial water cycle, accounting for approximately 60%
    of global precipitation consumption. ET encompasses the process of water vapor
    transitioning from the Earth’s surface to the atmosphere, which includes evaporation
    from soil or water bodies, transpiration from vegetation, and evaporation of rainfall
    intercepted by vegetated surfaces [1]. Crop transpiration is intricately related
    to physiological activities such as crop growth and the formation of photosynthetic
    products. Simultaneously, evaporation assists in dissipating the heat generated
    by the increase in near-surface temperature caused by radiation, thereby maintaining
    an optimal growth environment within the crop system [2]. Generally, more than
    90% of the agricultural water is consumed through ET globally [3]. Accurate estimation
    of ET is beneficial for real-time monitoring of crop water use status, offering
    a basis for determining irrigation schedules, enhancing water use efficiency,
    and even predicting yields within agricultural fields [4,5]. Numerous methodologies
    have emerged to estimate terrestrial ET across various spatial scales, including
    hydrological modeling [6], empirical approaches [7], remote sensing inversion
    [8], and data-driven models. The hydrological method, which relies on the water
    balance principle for basin or sub-basin ET calculations, encounters challenges
    owing to uncertainties in the input and output data, model structure, initial
    conditions, and parameter settings, impacting simulation precision [9]. Empirical,
    semi-empirical, and physical–mathematical formulations based on meteorological
    data offer alternatives, with selection contingent on data availability, resulting
    in varied simulation accuracies across geographical locations [10]. Remote sensing
    for estimating ET presents distinct advantages in terms of accuracy and spatial
    resolution [11]; however, its limitation lies in the inability to provide continuous
    temporal values, which might not meet the temporal demands for irrigation and
    water resource management. Recently, data-driven models have been widely used
    for estimating ET owing to their remarkable capability of identifying intricate
    relationships. Machine learning (ML) techniques, which are characterized by their
    ability to handle complex relationships without prior knowledge or assumptions,
    have proven to be highly effective. Among them, the random forest (RF) algorithm
    has gained significant popularity in agricultural applications, such as land cover
    classification [12], water resources management [13], and crop yield prediction
    [14]. Its extensive applicability can be attributed to its exceptional accuracy
    in both classification and regression tasks, with minimal parameter dependencies,
    efficient processing capabilities, and the ability to handle overfitting problems
    [15]. In contrast, the support vector machine (SVM) model possesses a globally
    optimal solution and exhibits remarkable training efficiency. These qualities
    endow the SVM with enhanced robustness, efficiency, and reliability [16]. The
    SVM focuses on establishing functional relationships between ET and explanatory
    variables without explicitly considering the underlying biophysical mechanisms
    [17], making it particularly suitable for short-term ET prediction. For example,
    Liu, et al. [18] achieved a remarkable explanatory power of 71–85% for global
    ET changes by utilizing only five indicators (average daily temperature, relative
    humidity, wind speed, solar radiation, and NDVI) as input variables for SVM. XGB
    is an emerging machine learning algorithm that offers versatility and scalability
    for modeling small- to medium-sized datasets, making it a popular choice for crop
    yield predictions because of its flexibility and adaptability [19]. BP is centered
    around its application in training and testing using input variables, such as
    temperature, sunshine hours, and wind speed [20]. Its extensive applicability
    surpasses that of traditional neural networks, as demonstrated in a study by Kumar,
    et al. [21], in which the BP model outperformed the traditional method in accurately
    predicting crop ET. Given the widespread application and promising prospects of
    these four machine learning algorithms for predicting cropland ET, a comprehensive
    comparative analysis is essential to assess their strengths, weaknesses, and universality
    across different input factor combinations and climatic conditions. Obtaining
    parameters for the underlying surface of general croplands is challenging, and
    the availability of reliable meteorological data is often limited. Consequently,
    researchers have consistently aimed to increase the accuracy of ET predictions
    using a reduced number of variables. Previous studies have revealed that the dominant
    factors driving ET vary across different climatic regions, leading to differences
    in the ET simulation accuracy under various combinations of input factors. Pagano,
    et al. [22] compared the performance of multi-layer perceptron (MLP) and random
    forest (RF) in predicting daily ET in a citrus orchard typical of the Mediterranean
    ecosystem, highlighting the substantial influence of soil water content (SWC)
    and solar radiation (Rs) on ET prediction. Remarkably, even with a reduction in
    the number of input features to just four and a judicious selection of feature
    combinations, the machine learning models still achieved high accuracy in predicting
    ET. Chen, et al. [23] utilized the fuzzy rough set algorithm (BSFL-FRSA) to discern
    both individual and multifactorial determinants of ET in evergreen needleleaf
    forests across three distinct climate zones in North America: the Mediterranean,
    warm summer continental, and subarctic regions. The study revealed the predominant
    factors driving ET and the most crucial combinations of multiple factors. Agricultural
    ecosystems are predominantly found in the boreal, temperate, subtropical–Mediterranean,
    and temperate–continental climatic regions [24]. Hence, investigating the primary
    factors contributing to ET prediction within these climate zones and selecting
    optimal combinations of input factors can offer valuable insights and facilitate
    accurate ET assessments. The objectives of this study were to (1) identify the
    important input factors deriving daily crop ET in different climatic regions;
    (2) explore the applicability of four machine learning models, RF, SVM, XGB, and
    BP, in predicting daily crop ET; and (3) evaluate the accuracy of these models
    using specific combinations of three, six, and nine input factors and recommend
    an optimal model for each climatic region. This study provides a convenient method
    to accurately simulate ET in farmlands across diverse climatic zones. 2. Materials
    and Methods 2.1. Description of the Flux Sites In this study, 15 eddy covariance
    (EC) cropland flux towers located in three different climate zones were carefully
    selected. These sites included representative stations from the temperate–continental
    climate zone (TCCZ), featuring US-ARM, US-CRT, US-Ne1, US-Ne2, and US-Ne3. The
    subtropical–Mediterranean climate zone (SMCZ) included representative stations
    IT-BCi, IT-CA2, US-TW2, US-TW3, and US-TW, whereas the temperate climate zone
    (TCZ) comprised representative stations BE-Lon, CH-Oe2, DE-Geb, DE-Kli, and FR-Gri.
    Detailed information for each site is presented in Table 1. Table 1. Site characteristics
    used in this study. 2.2. Flux and Auxiliary This study was based on the analysis
    of daily EC flux and meteorological information extracted from the FLUXNET Tier
    2 dataset (http://fluxnet.fluxdata.org, accessed on 10 November 2023), which includes
    variables such as Rn (W m−2), Ta (°C), soil temperature (Ts, °C), VPD (hPa), sensible
    heat flux (H, W m−2), and latent heat flux (LE, W m−2). According to Allen, et
    al. [25], daily ET was derived from LE using the latent heat of vaporization as
    a function of Ta by 𝐸𝑇= 𝐿𝐸 2.501−(2.361× 10 −3 )× 𝑇 𝑎 . The soil water content
    (SWC) was measured at various depths at diverse sites, potentially failing to
    adequately represent the wetness or dryness of the soil, as soil properties vary
    across different sites. Here, we utilized the evaporative fraction (EF) to represent
    the degree of ground dryness and wetness [26,27] because an increase in energy
    allocation to evaporating water implies a greater potential water supply from
    the soil. The evaporative fraction (EF) is calculated as follows: 𝐸𝐹= 𝐿𝐸 𝐿𝐸+𝐻
    (1) where LE is the latent heat flux and H is the sensible heat flux. The primary
    source of data for capturing crop phenology information is the leaf area index
    (LAI). In our study, LAI data were acquired from the MODIS remote sensing product
    MODIS 15A2H (https://lpdaac.usgs.gov/products/mod15a2hv006/, accessed on 15 October
    2023) with an 8-day interval and 500 × 500 m spatial resolution. The original
    LAI data were preprocessed using the TIMESAT software (version 3.3) to attenuate
    peak values and eliminate transient, unrealistic fluctuations due to factors such
    as cloud interference or the presence of snow and ice on the ground [28]. Any
    gaps in the LAI values were filled using linear interpolation based on available
    nearby data points over time. Subsequently, cubic spline interpolation was applied
    to interpolate the 8-day LAI data, generating daily data that aligned with the
    requirements of our modeling inputs. This approach minimized data redundancy and
    ensured a consistent and high-quality dataset for our research. The statistical
    parameters of the environmental variables from the flux tower and LAI data across
    the different climatic regions are presented in Table 2. Observations illustrate
    that the mean Ta varied from 11.43 °C in TCCZ to 16.19 °C in SMCZ; the mean Rn
    ranged from 86.37 W m−2 in TCZ to 113.87 W m−2 in SMCZ; the mean ET fluctuated
    between 1.62 mm d−1 in TCZ and 2.32 mm d−1 in SMCZ; the mean LAI changed from
    0.54 m2/m2 in TCCZ to 1.91 m2/m2 in TCZ. Additional statistical characteristics
    of each variable are comprehensively provided. Table 2. Statistical parameters
    of flux tower measured environmental variables and remote sensing data during
    the entire study period at the four sites. 2.3. Machine Learning Models 2.3.1.
    Random Forest (RF) A flowchart of the implementation of the applied machine learning
    models is shown in Figure 1. Figure 2 shows a flowchart of the four machine learning
    algorithms. RF is a supervised ensemble learning algorithm that was initially
    proposed by [29]. Its primary objective is to generate accurate predictions without
    overfitting the data. The RF operates as a combination of tree predictors, with
    each tree depending on the values of the random vectors sampled independently
    and from the same distribution for all trees within the forest [13]. Previous
    studies have shown that RF outperforms conventional approaches in estimating Eto,
    achieving a significant reduction in the obtained error by approximately half
    [30]. After training, predictions for the unseen samples 𝑥 can be made by averaging
    the predictions from all individual regression trees on 𝑥 , as follows: 𝑓 ̂  =
    1 𝐵 ∑ 𝐵 𝑏=1 𝑓 𝑏 (𝑥) (2) where 𝐵 is the number of trees, 𝑓 𝑏 is the function obtained
    from training the b-th tree, and 𝑓 ̂  is the final prediction value. Figure 1.

    Machine (SVM) The SVM is recognized as a classical data-driven technique known
    for its robust ability to handle complex non-linear relationships between input
    and output variables [31]. Owing to its strong capacity to solve intricate nonlinear
    problems, the SVM has been widely applied to simulate both ET0 [32,33] and ET
    [34,35]. Additionally, research suggests that using the radial basis function
    (RBF) to transform the feature space yields highly accurate estimation results
    [36]. Consequently, in this study, an SVM model based on the RBF function was
    used to predict the ET. The approximated function is expressed as follows: 𝑦=
    𝑤 𝑇 𝑥+𝑏,  𝑥,𝑤∈ 𝑅 𝑀 (3) where 𝑀 is the dimension of 𝑥 , 𝑤 is the weight vector,
    and 𝑏 is a bias term. To determine the optimum 𝑤 and 𝑏 , the target of the optimization
    problem can be expressed as follows: 𝑚𝑖𝑛 𝑤,𝑏 = 1 2 𝑤 𝑤 𝑇 − − − − √ (4) where 𝑤
    denotes the normal vector of the hyperplane. 2.3.3. Extreme Gradient Boosting
    (XGB) The XGB model is an enhanced version of the gradient boosting machines (GBMs)
    proposed by [37]. Originating from the concept of “boosting”, the XGB model combines
    predictions from a series of “weak” learners to create a “strong” learner using
    an additive training process [38]. Recent studies have indicated that the XGB
    model is a promising alternative method for estimating the daily ET0 [39]. However,
    the specific performance of the direct application of XGB for simulating ET remains
    unclear. The general function for prediction at step t is as follows: 𝑓 𝑡 𝑖 =
    ∑ 𝑡 𝑘=1 𝑓 𝑘 ( 𝑥 𝑖 )= 𝑓 (𝑡−1) 𝑖 + 𝑓 𝑡 ( 𝑥 𝑖 ) (5) where 𝑥 𝑖 is the input variable,
    and 𝑓 𝑡 ( 𝑥 𝑖 ) and 𝑓 𝑡 𝑖 are the learner and predictions at step 𝑡 , respectively.
    2.3.4. Backpropagation Neural Network (BP) An artificial neural network (ANN)
    is a well-established supervised learning method known for its exceptional capability
    to extract nonlinear features from gathered data, making it a widely used modeling
    tool [40]. As a result, ANNs have found extensive applications in estimating ET0
    [41,42]. Backpropagation, a gradient descent method, is commonly used among various
    algorithms proposed for training the ANN method. Backpropagation involves calculating
    the gradient of the error with respect to the weights for a given input by propagating
    the error backward from the output layer to the hidden layer and then to the input
    layer [43]. The backpropagation algorithm was adopted in this study, and a flowchart
    of the backpropagation algorithm is illustrated in Figure 2. During the error
    backpropagation process, the weights and biases are modified at each iteration
    by minimizing an error metric that quantifies the disparity between the produced
    output and the desired output, which can be expressed as follows: 𝑊 𝑛+1 = 𝑊 𝑛
    +Δ𝑊 (6) where 𝑊 𝑛+1 and 𝑊 𝑛 represent the weight matrix during iterations 𝑛 and
    𝑛+1 , respectively, in the iterative training process. Δ𝑊 denotes the adjusting
    weight matrix responsible for controlling the convergence rate and the computational
    complexity. The error minimization process was repeated until a satisfactory convergence
    criterion was obtained: 𝐸= ∑ 𝑃 ( 𝑦 𝑖 − 𝑡 𝑖 ) 2 (7) where 𝑦 𝑖 is the final output
    of the ANN model, and 𝑡 𝑖 is the measured output. 2.3.5. Model Development This
    study develops four machine learning models (RF, SVM, XGB, and BP) to simulate
    and predict daily cropland ET using daily EC flux and meteorological information.
    By inputting different variable combinations, the models’ predictive potentials
    are explored and variable combinations are compared. The dataset was split into
    training and testing sets. At each flux tower site, 80% of the time series data
    was used for model training, and the remaining 20% for testing, allowing for an
    investigation into the predictive performance of machine learning models at specific
    sites and, further, within specific climatic regions. All machine learning model
    development and statistical computations were conducted using R version 4.0.5
    [44]. Four machine learning models utilized in this study, along with their corresponding
    hyperparameters, can be found in the Supplementary Materials. 2.4. Evaluating
    Indicators The root mean square error (RMSE) and mean absolute error (MAE) were
    used to check the accuracy of the models, whereas the determination coefficient
    (R2) and the Nash–Sutcliffe efficiency coefficient (NSE) are measurements of generalizability
    when comparing the performances of the four machine learning models under different
    input combinations [45,46,47]. 𝑅𝑀𝑆𝐸= ∑ 𝑛 𝑖=1 ( 𝑥 𝑖 − 𝑦 𝑖 ) 2 𝑛 − − − − − − − −

    value of ET, 𝑦 𝑖   is the measured value of ET, 𝑥 ̲ 𝑖 and 𝑦 ̲ 𝑖 are the corresponding
    average values of 𝑥 𝑖  and  𝑦 𝑖 , subscript 𝑖 refers to the number of datasets,
    𝑛 is the length of the dataset. Larger R2 and NSE values, along with smaller RMSE
    and MAE values, signify a better fit in the context of modeling. In addition,
    a global performance indicator (GPI), which normalizes the four different metrics
    as one, was used to comprehensively evaluate the model performance [48,49]. 𝐺𝑃
    𝐼 𝑖 = ∑ 4 𝑗=1 𝑎 𝑗 ( 𝑔 𝑗 − 𝑦 𝑖𝑗 ) (12) where 𝑎 𝑗 is a coefficient (1 for RMSE and
    MAE and −1 for R2 and NSE), 𝑔 𝑗 represents the median of the scaled values of
    statistical indicator 𝑗 , and 𝑦 𝑖𝑗 represents the scaled value of statistical
    indicator 𝑗 for model 𝑖 . A higher GPI value implies superior model performance.
    3. Results 3.1. The Overall Performance of Four Machine Learning Models in Simulating
    ET In certain regions, simultaneously obtaining a complete set of input data for
    ET simulations is a challenge. To reduce the number of input variables while ensuring
    the accuracy of the ET simulation, we selected variables that demonstrated stronger
    correlations with ET for both three-factor and six-factor input combinations.
    The initial correlation coefficients were computed independently using the input
    factor data from various climate stations and subsequently merging the data from
    all stations to produce the overall correlation coefficients, as shown in Table
    3. The outcomes of this comprehensive data integration revealed Rn, PPFD, and
    EF to be strongly correlated with ET, thus forming a three-factor input combination.
    Additionally, Ta, LAI, and VPD were strongly correlated with ET, extending this
    input combination to six factors. Using all available input data enabled the creation
    of a nine-factor input combination, as detailed in Table 4. Table 3. Pearson correlation
    coefficients between input factors and evapotranspiration (ET). Table 4. Three-factor
    combinations were obtained from the correlation analysis of ET using data from
    all sites, along with their combination with the RF, SVM, XGB, and BP models.
    The simulation performances of the four models at different represented sites
    across various climate zones are illustrated in Figure 3. The sites were chosen
    based on the availability of the highest volume of valid data within the respective
    climate zone. The consistent results between the simulated and actual ET demonstrated
    their capacity to simulate ET with three different input factor combinations.
    Figure 4 presents the simulation results of ET using the RF, SVM, XGB, and BP
    models with three-factor input combinations (V3, V6, and V9). For the RF-V3, SVM-V3,
    XGB-V3, and BP-V3 models, the average RMSE values were 0.738, 0.774, 0.780, and
    0.892 mm d−1, respectively. The average MAE values were 0.547, 0.573, 0.576, and
    0.627 mm d−1, respectively. Correspondingly, the average R2 values were 0.618,
    0.622, 0.597, and 0.570, whereas the average NSE values were 0.378, 0.256, 0.272,
    and −0.161, respectively. According to the results presented in Table 5, RF-V3
    exhibited a higher prediction accuracy for ET than the other models, with a GPI
    value of −2.376. The same pattern of results emerged with the six- and nine-factor
    input combinations, in which the GPI values for SVM-V6 and SVM-V9 were 0.548 and
    0.561, respectively, demonstrating their superior accuracy in simulating ET among
    the six- and nine-factor input combinations. Figure 3. Relationship between simulated
    evapotranspiration using four machine learning models with three input combinations

    using different input combinations. The overall simulation results for ET across
    various sites under three different input combinations are presented in Table
    6. Considering all input factor combinations, the average RMSE values for the
    RF, SVM, XGB, and BP models were 0.527, 0.488, 0.545, and 0.551 mm d−1, respectively.
    The average MAE values were 0.388, 0.356, 0.396, and 0.390 mm/d, respectively.
    Concurrently, the average R2 values were 0.771, 0.804, 0.749, and 0.768, whereas
    the average NSE values were 0.633, 0.659, 0.588, and 0.491, respectively. Consequently,
    the SVM model outperformed the other models in terms of the overall ET simulation
    across all climate zones. Table 6. Three combinations were obtained from the correlation
    analysis of ET using data from all sites, along with their combination with the
    model for simulating ET. 3.2. Performance of Four Machine Learning Models in Simulating
    ET in Different Climatic Regions Table 3 presents the results of the correlation
    analysis of ET using data collected from stations in three distinct climate zones.
    Using the same variable grouping described in Section 3.1, three input factor
    combinations for these climate zones were derived, and four machine learning models
    were used to simulate ET in the TCCZ, SMCZ, and TCZ climate zones, as shown in
    Table 7. Across specific input factor combinations in each climate zone, the SVM
    model consistently demonstrated superior accuracy in the ET simulation, with average
    RMSE values of 0.312, 0.387, and 0.460 mm d−1 for TCCZ, SMCZ, and TCZ, respectively.
    The average MAE values were 0.218, 0.275, and 0.332 mm d−1, respectively. The
    average R2 values were 0.926, 0.824, and 0.833, and the average NSE values were
    0.905, 0.774, and 0.783, respectively (Table 8). Table 7. Three combinations obtained
    from the correlation analysis of ET using data from sites within each climate
    zone, along with their combination with RF, SVM, XGB, and BP models. Table 8.
    Statistical parameters between simulated evapotranspiration by machine learning
    models using different input combinations and actual measurements in different
    climate zones. (The subscript (C, S, T) in each model indicates the temperate–continental,
    subtropical–Mediterranean, and temperate climate zones, respectively.) Based on
    the statistical parameters listed in Table 8, the optimal models were identified
    as SVMC-V3, BPC-V6, and BPC-V9 for three-, six-, and nine-factor combinations
    in the TCCZ (Table 9), respectively. In contrast, in the SMCZ (TCZ) climate zone,
    the optimal models were determined to be SVMS-V3 (SVMT-V3), SVMS-V6 (SVMT-V6),
    and SVMS-V9 (SVMT-V9) for three-, six-, and nine-factor combinations (Table 9),
    respectively. In summary, the BP model demonstrated superior ET simulation with
    six- and nine-factor input combinations in the TCCZ climate zone. In all other
    cases, the SVM model consistently delivered higher accuracy (Figure 5). Figure

    with the SVM model in three distinct climate zones. Table 9. The GPI values of
    the four machine learning models for evapotranspiration simulation using different
    input combinations across different climate zones. 3.3. Runtime Analysis of Four
    Machine Learning Models in ET Simulation In addition to seeking higher accuracy,
    the computational runtime of machine learning models is also a crucial consideration
    in ET simulations. As shown in Figure 6, the runtime for the RF, SVM, XGB, and
    BP models ranged from 6.77 to 12.83 s, 1.24 to 1.85 s, 0.37 to 0.46 s, and 4.33
    to 7.07 s using data merged from all stations, respectively. Using data exclusively
    from stations within distinct climate zones, the runtime for the RF, SVM, XGB,
    and BP models spans from 7.45 to 12.96 s, 1.72 to 2.46 s, 1.60 to 1.87 s, and
    3.92 to 6.70 s, respectively. The differentiation of climate zones for the input
    factor combinations had a negligible impact on the runtime performance of the
    models. It is noteworthy that, among the four models, both the RF and XGB models
    showed an increasing trend in runtime with an increase in the number of input
    factors. This trend was particularly pronounced in the RF model. Conversely, the
    SVM and BP models exhibited a fluctuating trend in the runtime as the number of
    input factors increased. In the comprehensive assessment of all models and their
    respective input factor combinations, RF*-V9 boasts the longest runtime at 12.96
    s, whereas XGB-V3 displayed the shortest runtime at 0.37 s. Figure 6. Single-run
    time for training and simulation with all site data under various input factor
    combinations. The divisions of input factor combinations were conducted for correlation
    analysis on evapotranspiration utilizing two distinct datasets: all site data
    (represented by RF, SVM, XGB, and BP) and site data located in different climatic
    zones (represented by RF*, SVM*, XGB*, and BP*). For clarity, RF* is defined as
    the sum of RFC, RFS, and RFT, with this naming convention uniformly applicable
    to the other models. 4. Discussion 4.1. Importance of Input Factors for Simulating
    Evapotranspiration Based on a correlation analysis of various input variables
    with ET, Rn was identified as the most crucial input factor for simulating ET.
    Subsequently, photosynthetic photon flux density (PPFD) has emerged as the next
    significant factor, both of which are intricately related to energy absorption.
    The energy required for water vapor evaporation is derived from the radiation,
    thus establishing Rn as a pivotal driver of ET, especially in non-moisture-restricted
    areas [50]. In addition, numerous studies have proved that variations in light
    intensity can affect plant photosynthesis, leaf area morphology, and radiation
    absorption. Light also directly affects the stomatal opening, which is an important
    channel for water vapor diffusion [51]. In addition to the energy term, our study
    found that LAI played an important role in ET simulation, and there was a stronger
    correlation between LAI and ET in the TCCZ than that in the TCZ or SMCZ, ranking
    at the top (Table 4). The LAI influences the ground energy reception by affecting
    the sensible heat flux and radiation. This impact is particularly pronounced when
    the LAI is low and diminishes as the LAI surpasses a certain threshold. Current
    studies have found that the relationships between environmental factors and ET
    were mediated by leaf area [52], and the regulatory effect on ET was significantly
    different before and after an LAI close to 1 (1.2~1.5 m2 m−2). When the canopy
    cover is full, the increase in canopy cover is not apparently equal to the increase
    in LAI; therefore, the intercepted energy does not increase significantly. Therefore,
    beyond this threshold, changes in LAI have a diminishing effect on ET [53]. However,
    in TCZ and TCCZ, the correlation was relatively weaker. By comparing the average
    LAI values for different climatic zones, as displayed in Table 2, it was found
    that the LAI in the TCZ was greater than that in the SMCZ and TCCZ, further confirming
    the mechanism of the impact of LAI on ET. As an important component of the water
    cycle, ET involves numerous complex energy exchanges. In particular, evaporation
    is the movement of water into the air and can readily lead to changes in the air
    temperature. Conversely, variations in the daily average temperature of agricultural
    fields can reflect the intensity and rate of energy exchange in the atmosphere.
    Thus, the daily mean air temperature (Ta) also demonstrates a strong correlation
    with ET [54]. Although EF was considered a crucial factor for quantifying surface
    water deficits and the water cycle, and the estimation of ET based on a specific
    daytime EF is considered a favorable method [27,55], EF did not demonstrate the
    same universally strong correlation across all climatic regions as Rn and PPFD
    in the present study. Further investigation of previous research has revealed
    that EF demonstrates higher sensitivity to land surface moisture conditions in
    arid regions, whereas it is less sensitive in relatively humid areas [56]. On
    one hand, this was probably due to the generally humid climate in agricultural
    areas; on the other hand, it may be influenced by irrigation practices in agricultural
    areas, which can affect the land surface moisture conditions at flux measurement
    sites. Therefore, when considering the number of required input factors, these
    relatively more important factors should be prioritized. 4.2. Optimal Input Factor
    Combinations and Machine Learning Models for Simulating Evapotranspiration The
    four machine learning models used in this study demonstrated relatively good simulation
    accuracy. After obtaining the input factor combinations from the correlation analysis
    of ET using data from sites within each respective climate zone, the simulation
    accuracy of the three- and six-factor combinations of each model was significantly
    improved, indicating that it is meaningful to consider the differences and impacts
    of climate zones when simulating cropland daily ET. Given the high simulation
    accuracy across all the models, each model had suitable scenarios and characteristics.
    RF models often achieve better simulation accuracy than other models when trained
    with fewer input variables. However, they also had the longest execution times
    among the four models [57]. When conducting ET simulations with fewer input variables
    and when the importance of the time cost is low or not considered, the RF model
    can be prioritized. The SVM consistently demonstrated better modeling performance
    for ET than the other three models across most combinations of input variables
    and various climate zones. In the comparison without distinguishing climate zones
    and input factor combinations, SVM-V6 and SVM-V9 were the optimal six-factor and
    nine-factor input combination models. In the comparison where input factor combinations
    were divided by climate zones, overall, the combined performance of SVM models
    with three different input factor combinations (SVM*-V3 and SVM*-V6) was the best.
    Additionally, SVM models exhibited faster single-model runtimes (significantly
    lower than those of the RF and BP models). The XGB model has a notable advantage
    in terms of computational time and efficiency over other models [37], which makes
    it more suitable for addressing real-time prediction problems, even though the
    simulation accuracy of the XGB model for ET is not particularly outstanding among
    these machine learning models. However, the simulation accuracy of the BP model
    is unstable across different climatic regions, and its generalization ability
    is relatively average [58], particularly when dealing with very limited or extremely
    large datasets, and the performance of the BP model is not as strong as that of
    other models. In some cases, the backpropagation algorithm may become stuck at
    a local optimum [59]. Additionally, the BP model had a relatively long single-model
    runtime (only slightly faster than that of the RF model). However, when the dataset
    size is moderate, the BP model may achieve high accuracy. Therefore, to attain
    excellent simulation accuracy with the BP model, a substantial amount of data
    is required to pre-determine the optimal local input variables for each site,
    which may require a significant amount of time and effort. Considering the simulation
    accuracy of the model and the runtime under various conditions, this study suggests
    that the SVM model is the preferred choice for simulating daily cropland ET. Considering
    three different combinations of input factors, we observed differences in the
    adaptability of input factor combinations across climatic zones. By comparing
    the performance of machine learning models using the three-factor combination
    (V3) in different climatic zones, three out of four of the models exhibited better
    performance in the SMCZ. Similar results were also observed with the nine-factor
    combination (V9), which showed better performance in the TCCZ (Table 9). Additionally,
    the four machine learning models generally performed well in both V6 and V9 input
    factor combinations. This indicates that the predictive accuracy of the models
    improved with the increase in input factors. However, the simulation accuracy
    of the V9 input factor combination did not show significant superiority over that
    of the V6 input factor combination, and at some sites, it performed worse for
    certain site data. Therefore, considering that the V9 input factor combination
    requires 50% more input factors than the V6 input factor combination while achieving
    similar simulation accuracy, this study suggests that V6 is the most economical
    input factor combination for situations with limited meteorological data. 4.3.
    Uncertainties Estimating uncertainty for EC data is challenging, and the presence
    of missing data in the dataset can lead to discontinuities in the data time series,
    potentially increasing the difficulty of accurately predicting ET using machine
    learning models. Considering the complexity of relationships between variables,
    future research may explore the application of some deep learning models for agricultural
    evapotranspiration prediction. Additionally, interpolating MODIS LAI from 8-day
    periods to daily using cubic spline interpolation may introduce uncertainty into
    the models. However, the daily scale LAI interpolated from 8-day data may be beneficial
    to improve the simulation accuracy of the machine learning used in this study.
    The daily scale LAI is consistent with the input meteorological data on the time
    scale, and it can better quantify the impact of vegetation change on ET, especially
    in the period when the vegetation changed dramatically (generally the rapid development
    stage of crops). Directly conducting correlation analysis on the original time
    series dataset can result in non-independent impacts of input variables on ET
    (ideally, analyzing the impact of a certain variable should ensure that other
    variables remain constant, which is not achievable in reality). This can lead
    to larger underestimations of variables (such as U and P) ranked lower in correlation
    analysis, and the uncertainty in flux tower measurement data may exacerbate this
    underestimation. However, its impact on our selection of three-factor and six-factor
    input variables (V3 and V6) is minimal. As far as the representativeness of the
    EC sites selected in this study, we have to admit that not all EC flux sites in
    different climate zones could be included due to limitations of accessibility
    and openness of data. In the future, extending field ET predictions to flux tower
    sites in other climatic zones beyond those mentioned in this study (e.g., the
    Boreal climatic zone) could be considered. Due to the limited representation of
    site numbers in this study, not all relevant climatic zones were investigated,
    although most flux tower station data located in agricultural areas were included.
    5. Conclusions This study used meteorological and remote sensing data from diverse
    agricultural sites in distinct climatic regions to simulate ET using four machine
    learning models with three different input combinations. The key findings are
    summarized as follows: (1) Rn, PPFD, LAI, EF, and Ta emerged as pivotal factors
    influencing daily ET in agricultural areas, and they all exhibited a relatively
    strong correlation with ET across various climate zones; (2) all four machine
    learning models yielded satisfactory simulation performance, with the SVM model
    demonstrating the best simulation performance, particularly when considering the
    influence of climate zones on ET simulation; (3) the predictive ET accuracy of
    three-factor combinations (V3) was improved with the inclusion of more input factors.
    However, considering both predictive accuracy and input factor efficiency, the
    V6 input factor combination is recommended as the preferred choice; (4) in climate
    zones with a lower average LAI, LAI was more crucial for ET predictions than in
    climate zones with a higher average LAI (TCZ, SMCZ), highlighting the need for
    region-specific considerations when selecting machine learning models and input
    factor combinations. Supplementary Materials The following supporting information

    accurately estimates IWU and incorporates theory-guided module to reveal implicit
    irrigation signal 1 Introduction Irrigation is a critical agricultural practice
    essential for crop growth and enhancing grain production. It also accounts for
    over 70% of the world''s freshwater withdrawal (Siebert et al., 2015). In China,
    irrigated croplands constitute approximately 50% of the total cropland area but
    contribute significantly, contributing to about 75% of the nation''s total grain
    output (C. Zhang et al., 2022). This highlights the substantial impact of irrigation
    on China''s agricultural landscape and places considerable demands on its limited
    freshwater resources (Kang et al., 2017; Sun et al., 2015). Recent studies suggest
    that unsustainable water use, where water consumption exceeds local renewable
    capacity, has accounted for 66% of China''s irrigation water use (IWU) (Rosa et
    al., 2019). Moreover, as irrigation involves direct human intervention in the
    natural water cycle, adopting unsound irrigation practices can detrimentally affect
    the regional ecological environment. These practices can lead to adverse consequences
    such as groundwater depletion and land salinization (W. Liu et al., 2022; J. Wu
    et al., 2013). Therefore, accurate IWU estimation is pivotal not only for sustainable
    water resources management and food security but also for assessing the profound
    environmental impact associated with human irrigation practices (Fisher et al.,
    2017). The conventional approach of obtaining IWU relies heavily on statistics
    provided by irrigation district management departments, which demand considerable
    manpower and material resources due to the diversity of irrigation schemes, infrastructure,
    and crop types across regions (X. Li et al., 2020). Recent advancements in satellite
    sensors have facilitated the use of remote sensing technology to obtain irrigation-related
    variables such as evapotranspiration (ET) and precipitation, offering a potential
    avenue for large-scale IWU estimation (AghaKouchak et al., 2015; Y. Chen et al.,
    2019). Various approaches have emerged to estimate IWU. Brocca et al. (2013) proposed
    the SM2RAIN algorithm, which calculates the total water entering irrigated farmland
    based on the water balance equation and then estimates IWU by subtracting local
    precipitation. However, reliance on rainfall data presents reliability challenges
    at a large scale. S. V. Kumar et al. (2015) and Zaussinger et al. (2019) integrated
    microwave soil moisture (SM) products and modeled SM products without an explicit
    irrigation scheme to capture irrigation signals through product residuals. Yet,
    limitations such as coarse resolution and data gaps in SM products constrain the
    effectiveness of this method. Moreover, these theory-based methods often rely
    on energy balance models or water balance models to quantitatively describe the
    complex relationships between IWU and related variables, leading to significant
    uncertainty in IWU estimation. Recent researcher has proposed methods to mitigate
    uncertainty by integrating multisource products (K. Zhang et al., 2022; Zohaib
    & Choi, 2020), but these theory-based methods remain constrained by model limitations
    and data gaps. Machine learning (ML) stands as a promising avenue for IWU estimation,
    offering an alternative to theory-based methods by leveraging historical data
    to discern underlying patterns and rules, rather than explicitly modeling physical
    relationships between variables (Reichstein et al., 2019). The application potential
    of ML in hydrology and agriculture has been extensively explored. For example,
    as early as 1995, the effectiveness of Artificial Neural Network (ANN) in simulating
    rainfall-runoff processes was demonstrated (Hsu et al., 1995). Similarly, other
    ML methods such as Random Forest (RF) have been utilized in hydrology and agriculture
    to predict various factors such as yield, fertilizer requirements, and pesticide
    usage (Everingham et al., 2016; Sherafatpour et al., 2019). Despite these advancements,
    there has been limited exploration of ML''s potential for IWU estimation. One
    challenge is selecting the most suitable ML model, given the multitude of models
    developed over decades, each with specific advantages. One potential solution
    is integrating results from different ML approaches. For instance, Fleming et
    al. (2021) employed multi-model averaging to integrate water supply forecasts
    in the western US from six different supervised learning algorithms, demonstrating
    the benefits of multi-model ensemble techniques. In addition to multi-model averaging,
    Bayesian approaches are increasingly recognized for their ability to harmonize
    information from observations and diverse outcomes generated by various ML models
    (Zounemat-Kermani et al., 2021). Within the Bayesian framework, this amalgamation
    produces a probability distribution of ensemble members, offering a perspective
    for multi-model ensemble. Furthermore, the aforementioned theory-based IWU estimating
    approaches provide several theory-guided knowledges that reflect irrigation information.
    While ML is primarily data-driven, incorporating these theory-guided knowledges
    into ML models may enhance their effectiveness (Karpatne et al., 2017). On the
    other hand, high-quality data sets with high spatiotemporal resolution are required
    for all existing methods. However, current remote sensing products could not fully
    meet these requirements due to factors such as satellite orbit and sensor performance
    (Dorigo et al., 2010). Prevalent surface soil moisture (SSM) products such as
    Soil Moisture Active Passive (SMAP) and ESA CCI suffer from coarse spatial resolution
    and data gaps, leading to considerable uncertainty in IWU estimation (Y. Y. Liu
    et al., 2012). Consequently, there is a pressing need to explore effective data
    filling methods to enhance the usability of these SSM products (K. Liu et al.,
    2023). Similarly, data sets associated with ET models, such as MODIS (Moderate
    Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer), pose their own challenges. Data gaps and
    the temporal synthesis of provided data at 8-day intervals present substantial
    obstacles for methods reliant on daily data (Cammalleri et al., 2013). To address
    these constraints, there is growing recognition of the value of process-based
    ET models. Models like the Priestley-Taylor Jet Propulsion Laboratory and Penman-Monteith-Leuning
    (PML) offer the capability to quantify intricate spatiotemporal dynamics of thermal
    and water processes (Yao et al., 2013). However, it is essential to note that
    thermal-based ET models, notably Surface Energy Balance System and surface energy
    balance algorithm for land (SEBAL), demonstrate remarkable accuracy in irrigation
    croplands (Ma et al., 2012). Their sensitivity to changes in surface temperature
    and SM makes them suitable for regions where irrigation significantly alters the
    surface energy balance (Knipper et al., 2018). Within irrigated croplands, these
    models excel in capturing the precise impact of irrigation practices on ET, surpassing
    the capabilities of some conventional methods. Given these considerations, addressing
    the demand for higher-quality data sets related to irrigation variables emerges
    as a matter of utmost urgency. In this study, we propose a hybrid framework that
    integrates data-driven models with theory-guided strategies to calculate China''s
    IWU for three staple cereal crops. Leveraging high-resolution time series remote
    sensing data, our framework drives a range of ML methods, augmented by the integration
    of Bayesian mechanism. The main objectives of our study are threefold: (a) to
    generate high resolution time series of ET and SSM using remote sensing data sets;
    (b) to assess the effectiveness of theory-guided data-driven models in estimating
    IWU across different crops in China; and (c) to evaluate the uncertainty associated
    with the proposed model. 2 Study Region and Study Design 2.1 Study Region Our
    study focuses on the Chinese mainland, a vast region comprising 31 provinces,
    characterized by complex crop planting structures and cropping intensity (Piao
    et al., 2010). The staple cereal crops cultivated in this region are wheat, rice,
    and maize, collectively contributing to over 90% of the total grain output (Luo
    et al., 2020). Figure 1a illustrates the geographic distribution of these crops.
    Rice cultivation is predominant in the humid regions of South and Central China,
    with some cultivation also observed in Northeast China. In contrast, wheat and
    maize are primarily grown in the relatively arid regions of North China. Additionally,
    a substantial portion of croplands in these regions practices multi-cropped, such
    as maize-wheat rotation, which is prevalent in the North China Plain. Figure 1b
    presents the proportions of reported IWU for three cereal crops across provinces.
    Figure 1 Open in figure viewer PowerPoint Study region. (a) Distribution of 12
    stations along with the cultivation regions of three cereal crops. The dark blue
    region represents areas where maize and wheat rotation are prevalent. (b) Proportion
    of irrigation water use for the three cereal crops in each province. (c) Distribution
    of the Aridity index across the study region. To evaluate the performance of the
    proposed method across diverse climatic regions, we categorized the study area
    into four sub-regions based on the Aridity index (Figure 1c). These sub-regions,
    delineated using natural breaks (Jenks), comprise the Arid region (AI < 0.22),
    Semi-Arid region (0.22 < AI < 0.53), Semi-Humid region (0.53 < AI < 0.96), and
    Humid region (AI > 0.96). 2.2 Study Design The proposed hybrid framework for estimating
    IWU comprises three main components (Figure 2): theory-based processes implementation,
    data-driven models establishment and integration, and performance analysis. Figure
    2 Open in figure viewer PowerPoint Flowchart of the proposed framework. The primary
    objective of estimating IWU using ML is feature selection. IWU is defined by the
    generalized water balance formula as the residual between ET, drainage (D), soil
    water storage dynamic (dSM), and precipitation (P) for each time step (t) (Y.
    Chen et al., 2019; C. Zhang & Long, 2021): (1) Applying theory-guided strategies
    to these variables could yield features that better capture irrigation signals.
    Part 1 of our framework employs two theory-guided strategies to enhance irrigation
    information within SM data: converting the original SM data into its logarithmic
    form (details in Section 12) and extracting SM residuals (details in Section 13).
    The outputs of Part 1 are three theory-guided features related to SM: lnSSM, lnRZSM,
    and soil moisture residuals (ResSM). These features, along with precipitation
    and ET, constitute all the features utilized in this study. Subsequently, Part
    2 of our framework utilizes these features and reported IWU to drive five ML models
    and generate corresponding IWU estimations (details in Section 14). Furthermore,
    the Bayesian three-cornered hat (BTCH) approach is applied to integrate the IWU
    estimations generated by the five ML models (details in Section 15). Part 3 of
    our framework primarily focuses on performance analysis. To verify the applicability
    of our proposed framework, we estimated the IWU at field stations based on the
    same process, but replacing satellite data with field measurements. The uncertainty
    analysis includes multiple error sources potentially affecting model performance,
    such as the quality of remote sensing products and the number of training samples.
    To evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed theory-guided strategies, we designed
    an ablation experiment to observe model performance without these strategies.
    We also compared the results between our work and two previous theory-based IWU
    estimating studies. 3 Materials and Methods 3.1 Data Set A variety of remote sensing-derived
    products were collected to establish and evaluate national IWU, including precipitation,
    ET, and SM. A distribution and phenology data set were used to filter these remote
    sensing products temporally and spatially. Among these gridded data sets, SM was
    initially processed as the average value during the annual phenological period,
    while precipitation and ET were treated as cumulative values. After temporal filtering,
    these parameters were spatially accumulated to match the distribution of the three
    cereal crops. Field measurements from stations were collected to validate the
    accuracy of these products. Multiple sources of products were introduced to assess
    the potential uncertainty associated with satellite-derived products on a large
    scale. Detailed information regarding these data sets can be found in Table 1.

    Ministry of Water Resources Annual City level 3.1.1 Precipitation We used the
    Global Precipitation Measurement (GPM) data set during 2003–2013 as a crucial
    element in our model. The accuracy and applicability of the GPM data set in hydrological
    field have been extensively verified (Tan & Duan, 2017). This half-hourly 0.1°
    × 0.1° data set, generated using the Integrated Multi-satellite Retrievals for
    GPM (IMERG) algorithm, combines precipitation estimates from satellite retrieval
    and ground precipitation gauge data (Hou et al., 2014). To evaluate the potential
    impact of product uncertainty on our model, we incorporated two additional precipitation
    data sets, that is, the Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM) and the new
    fifth-generation atmospheric reanalysis of ECMWF (ERA5). The TRMM data set, a
    predecessor of GPM, employs sensors similar to those on the GPM satellite, including
    the Microwave Imager and Precipitation Radar. Provided at a 3-hourly temporal
    resolution and a spatial resolution of 0.25°, this data set integrates data from
    TRMM satellite instruments and external sources, such as Defense Meteorological
    Satellite Program (DMSP), using the TRMM Multi-satellite Precipitation Analysis
    (TMPA) algorithm (Pombo and de Oliveira, 2015; Wolff et al., 2007). ERA5, released
    by the Copernicus Climate Change Service, is the latest reanalysis product with
    higher spatial-temporal resolution (0.1° and hourly) (Jiang et al., 2021). 3.1.2
    Evapotranspiration Accurate estimation of ET is crucial for efficient agricultural
    water management, yet current algorithms face challenges at a continental scale,
    especially across diverse climatic conditions. To address this, we used various
    satellite observations to produce a 1-km daily ET data set using the SEBAL. The
    SEBAL model has shown exceptional accuracy and adaptability, requiring minimal
    ground-based data (Tang et al., 2013). In irrigated croplands, where water application
    alters the surface energy balance, temperature and moisture variations are pronounced.
    SEBAL effectively captures these variations by considering key energy components
    such as incoming solar radiation, outgoing longwave radiation, sensible heat flux,
    and latent heat flux, crucial for ET estimation. Details on generating the daily
    ET data set with SEBAL on the Google Earth Engine platform can be found in Laipelt
    et al. (2021). This study used MODIS data (i.e., surface albedo, surface temperature,
    and Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI)) and meteorological data from
    the ERA5 as model driving input. Land surface temperature (LST) is a crucial parameter
    for ET calculation in the SEBAL model; nevertheless, it is generally constrained
    by missing or unreliable pixels. To address this, we applied a spatiotemporal
    regression strategy to gap-fill missing values in MODIS daily data, according
    to the studies of K. Liu et al. (2022). Specifically, we employed a RF model to
    capture the nonlinear relationship between LST and explanatory variables (i.e.,
    NDVI, elevation, slope, aspect and land surface emissivity) and used geographically
    weighted regression to calibrate the residuals derived from the RF model. We obtained
    two additional ET products for verification and uncertainty analysis. The first
    is MODIS ET, which utilizes a vegetation index model to estimate ET using metrics
    such as leaf area index (LAI) and meteorological inputs including vapor pressure
    deficit (Mu et al., 2011). This product provides a global 1 km ET data set with
    an 8-day temporal resolution. The second product, PML-V2 (Penman-Monteith-Leuning,
    Version 2), developed by Y. Zhang et al. (2019), integrates a coupled diagnostic
    biophysical model with the Penman-Monteith equation. It offers a spatial resolution
    of 500 m and an 8-day temporal resolution, accessible via the Google Earth Engine
    platform. 3.1.3 Soil Moisture Satellite-derived SSM products are often hindered
    by missing observations and coarse spatial resolution (Kovačević et al., 2020;
    Peng et al., 2023). To address these issues, we generated a time series of daily
    SSM with full spatial coverage at a spatial resolution of 1-km. Initially, we
    utilized a proven gap-filling method, as employed in previous studies (K. Liu
    et al., 2023), to fill missing data within the 25-km ESA CCI SSM product using
    satellite observations and a ML algorithm. Subsequently, we downscaled the gap-filled
    SSM data from 25- to 1-km resolution using the RF algorithm, integrating remote
    sensing data sets, digital terrain characteristics, and climatic variables, as
    described by H. Zhang et al. (2022). Given that irrigation modules are typically
    absent in reanalysis products, we obtained SM products from the ERA5 data set
    to identify irrigation information. The ERA5 SM product comprises three layers
    (0–7, 7–28, and 28–100 cm), with the first layer considered as SSM and the root
    zone soil moisture (RZSM) calculated as a weighted average across all three layers.
    3.1.4 Distribution and Phenology of Three Cereal Crops The study utilized phenological
    data from ChinaCropPhen1km, a data set developed by Luo et al. (2020), providing
    precise phenological information for rice, maize, and wheat in China. Covering
    the period from 2000 to 2015, this data set offers a 1 km gridded resolution.
    It integrates Global Land Surface Satellite LAI products with the Optimal Filter-based
    Phenology detection approach. The data set includes detailed pixel-level information
    on key phenological dates, such as heading, intermediate, and maturity dates,
    expressed in terms of the day of the year. 3.1.5 Reported Irrigation Water Use
    and Irrigated Area The city-level reported IWU and the irrigated area during 2003–2013
    were sourced from the Chinese Ministry of Water Resources (Zhou et al., 2020).
    This data set includes annual records of IWU and irrigated area for 341 cities,
    categorized into various crops, including rice, maize, wheat, vegetables, and
    fruits. The spatial distribution of the average value and trend of reported IWU
    for three cereal crops during 2003–2013 can be found in Figure S1 in Supporting
    Information S1. While this data set is considered reliable for reflecting actual
    IWU and irrigated area, it is derived through statistical methods and may not
    perfectly align with actual water amounts due to losses during transmission (K.
    Zhang et al., 2022). In our modeling approach, we did not directly use reported
    irrigated area as an input variable. Instead, we relied on ChinaCropPhen1km data
    for spatial parameter accumulation due to its practical advantages, such as accessibility
    and real-time availability. The reported irrigated area primarily served to evaluate
    the accuracy of ChinaCropPhen1km rather than actively influencing our modeling
    process. 3.1.6 Data Set for Verifying at Field Stations Field measurements were
    primarily obtained from two sources, that is, eight stations from the global network
    of eddy covariance sites (FLUXNET) and 34 stations from the Chinese Ecosystem
    Research Network (CERN). The geographical distribution of these stations is depicted
    in Figure S2 in Supporting Information S1. FLUXNET operates a global network of
    flux towers that utilize the eddy covariance method to measure energy flux components,
    including latent and sensible heat (Wilson et al., 2002). We collected half-hourly
    measurements of latent heat flux from eight FLUXNET stations and converted them
    into estimates of ET using the energy balance principle. CERN, established to
    monitor China''s ecological conditions, comprises ecological stations across various
    ecosystems, such as forests, croplands, and grasslands (Wang et al., 2016). From
    34 CERN stations, we obtained SM field measurements, with a measurement frequency
    ranging from 4 to 10 days. These measurements were acquired using the neutron
    probe method, a non-invasive technique known for its convenience, precision, and
    minimal impact on soil structure. Typically, measurements cover multiple soil
    depths, from 10 cm to approximately 200 cm. SSM was derived from measurements
    at the 10 cm depth, while RZSM was calculated as the weighted average of depths
    ranging from 10 to 100 cm. To assess the performance of the hybrid model, we selected
    12 cropland stations within CERN, providing a broader range of field measurements
    beyond SM. These measurements include irrigation water intensity (unit: mm), ET,
    and SM from 2008 to 2014. Precipitation data for these stations were obtained
    from nearby meteorological stations. Further details of these 12 cropland stations
    are provided in Table 2. Table 2. Description of the Cropland Field Stations Site

    Drainage, crucial for calculating IWU, depends on the interplay between saturated
    hydraulic conductivity and soil pore size distribution. The natural logarithm
    transformation of SM content is a well-established technique in hydrological studies,
    simplifying the complex relationship between SM and saturated hydraulic conductivity,
    as described by the Mualem-Van Genuchten equation (Text S1 in Supporting Information
    S1). By utilizing the natural logarithm of SM, we linearized the connection between
    SM and hydraulic conductivity, facilitating the modeling of drainage processes
    in soils with varied pore size distributions. This approach aligns with previous
    research, such as Zhao et al. (2010), which identified a significant logarithmic
    correlation between SM and the soil evaporation transfer coefficient. Additionally,
    literature on eco-hydrologic dynamics supports our approach by highlighting the
    non-linear relationship between plant root water uptake intensity and SM, consistent
    with macroscopic root water uptake models (R. Kumar et al., 2013; Shankar et al.,
    2012). In practical application, we substituted the original data set with logarithmic
    representations of surface soil moisture (lnSSM) and root zone soil moisture (lnRZSM).
    lnSSM was derived from satellite data, while lnRZSM was computed from the ERA5
    product, chosen for its superior performance in capturing root zone conditions.
    To validate the robustness of this transformation, we conducted an evaluation
    using 7 years of field measurements (2008–2014) from 12 cropland stations. As
    depicted in Figure 3, the logarithmic forms of SM and IWU reveal a discernible
    relationship at these field stations. This empirical observation emphasizes that
    an increase in soil water content moderates the interaction between IWU and SM,
    particularly in complex soil environments. Figure 3 Open in figure viewer PowerPoint
    Relationship between irrigation water use and the natural logarithm form of (a)
    surface soil moisture and (b) root zone soil moisture at field stations. The blue
    line with shading represents the regression line and prediction interval, while
    the cyan shading indicates the confidence interval. 3.3 Extraction of Soil Moisture
    Residual Caused by Irrigation This study introduces a strategy to infer irrigation
    activities by leveraging a robust metric—the bias between satellite-observed and
    modeled SM. This bias, stemming from seasonal hydrological variations during dry
    periods, provides valuable insights into detecting irrigation practices (Zohaib
    & Choi, 2020). First, we exploited the sensitivity of satellite sensors to large-scale
    irrigation, enabling the detection of variations in topsoil moisture and identification
    of irrigation events (Lawston et al., 2017; X. Zhang et al., 2018). Second, we
    addressed a significant gap in traditional global land surface models, such as
    the Global Land Data Assimilation System (Rodell et al., 2004) and Modern-Era
    Retrospective analysis (Woollen et al., 2011), which often neglect the incorporation
    of irrigation as a hydrological process. We combined a satellite-derived SM data
    set with the ERA5 SM product to extract ResSM associated with irrigation practices.
    Daily precipitation data was used to determine irrigation periods. We ranked daily
    precipitation values greater than zero each year in ascending order and identified
    an appropriate percentile in this ranked data set to delineate the irrigation
    period (i.e., rain-free period), when irrigation events may occur. Periods below
    this threshold were classified as non-irrigation periods. To validate the use
    of precipitation in determining irrigation periods and selecting an appropriate
    threshold, we collected daily precipitation data for 12 cropland CERN stations,
    along with precise records of irrigation dates. If daily precipitation on the
    irrigation day fell below the selected threshold, it indicated that the designated
    irrigation period covered an irrigation event. The choice of threshold value significantly
    affects the coverage of irrigation events within the designated period. Higher
    thresholds encompass more irrigation events but also extend the temporal duration
    of the irrigation period. In this study, we opted for a threshold ranked at the
    twentieth percentile, striking a balance between covering a substantial portion
    of irrigation events (over 80%) and minimizing the rate of increase in irrigation
    event coverage as thresholds rise (Figures S3 in Supporting Information S1). ResSM
    could be theoretically obtained by integrating the difference between the observed
    data set and the ERA5 product during the irrigation period: (2) where N represents
    the number of days within the irrigation period. signifies the observed SM product,
    which may originate from in-situ data or satellite-derived product. denotes the
    ERA5-based SM product after calibration. Considering the systematic discrepancies
    between these two data sources, we conducted a calibration process, leveraging
    the non-irrigation period for alignment. (3) (4) where represents the original
    ERA5 SSM product during the non-irrigation period, while and denote the observed
    SSM products for the non-irrigation and irrigation periods, respectively. The
    parameters Bias and y were determined through the least squares method. 3.4 Establishment
    of Machine Learning Model In this study, we utilized five distinct parameters
    as features to drive a ML model. These parameters, that is, precipitation, ET,
    lnSSM, lnRZSM, and ResSM, play essential roles in shaping irrigation dynamics
    from both natural and human perspectives (X. Zhang et al., 2022). Precipitation
    and ET act as indicators of natural water replenishment and dissipation within
    croplands. Meanwhile, lnSSM and lnRZSM provide critical information about soil
    water storage, vital for understanding moisture availability for crops. Particularly,
    ResSM quantitatively reflects the intensity of human irrigation activities (Zaussinger
    et al., 2019). To utilize these features effectively, we employed a suite of five
    ML models, each with unique strengths: RF, Multiple Linear Regression (MLR), Support
    Vector Machines (SVM), Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGB), and ANN. RF and XGB, developed
    by Breiman (2001) and T. Chen and Guestrin (2016) respectively, are ensemble learning
    algorithms that use bagging and boosting strategies to mitigate data anomalies.
    SVM, a powerful algorithm, is employed for regression tasks by identifying hyperplanes
    that minimize prediction error while maximizing the distance between support vectors
    and hyperplanes (Smola & Schölkopf, 2004). MLR establishes a straightforward linear
    regression function between the target label and multiple input features, making
    it easy to implement. ANN consists of interconnected neurons with continuously
    updated weights, facilitated by a backpropagation algorithm. While ANN excels
    in handling complex nonlinear relationships, it is often criticized for its reduced
    interpretability (Elnashar et al., 2020). A more detailed description of these
    five models can be found in Text S2 in Supporting Information S1. We first estimated
    the IWU at field stations to verify the applicability of ML approaches. We iteratively
    selected one year''s field measurements from 2008 to 2014 as the test set, while
    using the remaining data as the training set (the flowchart can be found in Figure
    S4 in Supporting Information S1). Cross-validation was then conducted to optimize
    hyperparameters, with details provided in Table S1 in Supporting Information S1.
    The performance of our framework was assessed across multiple years. We then extended
    the ML approaches to estimate IWU for three staple cereal crops at a national
    scale, focusing on city-level granularity. Similarly, we alternated one year''s
    data from 2003 to 2013 as the test set, using the remainder as the training set.
    3.5 Ensemble Based on Bayesian Three-Cornered Hat (BTCH) Method We employed a
    BTCH approach to construct an ensemble of IWU predictions by combing outputs from
    the five ML methods mentioned earlier. This method is recognized for its robustness
    in integrating diverse models seamlessly without requiring any prior assumptions
    (He et al., 2020). Unlike certain integration methods that rely on measured data,
    such as Bayesian model averaging, BTCH stands out for its simplicity. It operates
    solely based on the similarity between predicted sequences from different models,
    making it a straightforward and effective approach. Moreover, BTCH ensures that
    ensemble predictions leverage the strengths of individual models while mitigating
    their respective limitations, optimizing overall predictive performance. The BTCH
    method consists of two main components: the classic TCH segment for assessing
    model uncertainty and the Bayesian segment for weighing each model''s contribution.
    More detailed information about TCH and BTCH can be found in Text S3 in Supporting
    Information S1. 3.6 Analysis Metrics The evaluation metrics used in this study
    include root mean square error (RMSE), mean absolute error (MAE), correlation
    coefficient (R), coefficient of determination (R2) and a modified version of Kling-Gupta
    Efficiency (KGE″) (Clark et al., 2021). Mathematical formulas for these metrics
    are detailed in Text S4 in Supporting Information S1. Additionally, we conducted
    permutation-based importance analysis to discern the impacts of various parameters
    on our model. This procedure involves selecting a feature, randomly reordering
    its values within the data set, recalculating predictions, and evaluating the
    difference between the new and previous results. Substantial differences indicate
    higher importance scores for the feature, while minor differences indicate lower
    importance. 4 Results 4.1 Accuracy of Daily ET and SSM Data Set We generated high-quality
    data sets of ET and SSM during 2003–2013 using multiple remote sensing data sets,
    ML techniques, and process models. The spatial distribution and accuracy of these
    data sets are depicted in Figure 4. Both ET and SSM data sets exhibit a consistent
    geographical pattern, with values gradually decreasing from southeast to northwest.
    Furthermore, these data sets provide extensive spatial coverage, particularly
    in the sparsely vegetated northwest inland regions, surpassing that of existing
    mainstream products like MODIS ET and ESA CCI SSM (K. Liu et al., 2023; Xu et
    al., 2019). Figure 4 Open in figure viewer PowerPoint Evaluation of daily evapotranspiration
    (ET) and surface soil moisture (SSM) data sets. (a) Spatial distribution of average
    ET and SSM products during 2003–2013. (b) Accuracy metrics evaluated with field
    observations. Figure 4b illustrates that the R values of our daily ET and SSM
    data sets are 0.537 and 0.664, respectively. Specifically, the daily ET product
    perform better in semi-humid and humid regions compared to semi-arid and arid
    regions. It effectively prevents overestimation in arid regions due to reduced
    sensitivity to meteorological inputs and utilization of surface thermal characteristics
    (Laipelt et al., 2021; K. Liu et al., 2022). Compared to ESA CCI SSM, our reconstructed
    product not only demonstrates enhanced accuracy but also offers better spatial
    resolution and coverage (K. Liu et al., 2023). Verification results show that
    the arid region achieves the highest accuracy, characterized by maximum R and
    minimum RMSE and MAE, followed by semi-humid and humid regions, with the semi-arid
    region ranking last. Overall, considering the inherent spatial heterogeneity of
    field measurements, the accuracy of these two daily products remains at an acceptable
    level. 4.2 Evaluation of IWU at Field Stations Verifying the proposed method at
    field stations before scaling it up is essential since field measurements provide
    actual data. As shown in Figure 5a, among the five selected explanatory factors,
    ET exhibits the highest importance across all five ML models, emphasizing its
    critical role in the hydrological cycle (X. Wu et al., 2015). The importance of
    the other explanatory factors varies among the models. For example, while precipitation
    holds the second-highest importance in the SVM model, it is less crucial in the
    MLR model. Such variations are expected due to the distinct structures of ML models,
    leading them to select features using different strategies (Meng et al., 2022).

    at field stations. (a) Permutation-based importance of explanatory factors. The
    error line represents the standard deviation of 2008–2014. (b) Scatter plots of
    reported irrigation water use (IWU) and predicted IWU in each year. The number
    after the “±” represents the standard deviation of 2008–2014. Figure 5b exhibits
    the specific estimation precision of the five ML models and the BTCH integration
    models. Multi-year metrics reveal that BTCH shows the most satisfactory performance,
    with the highest R2 and KGE″, as well as the lowest RMSE and MAE among all models.
    Among the remaining models, RF, SVM, and ANN all exhibit acceptable accuracy,
    while XGB and MLR show relatively lower performances. Collectively, these results
    highlight the feasibility of estimating IWU using the proposed method, especially
    considering the modeling challenges posed by the spatial heterogeneity of field
    stations. 4.3 Evaluation of IWU at the City Level Figure 6 displays the importance
    of explanatory factors at the city level by extending the proposed method to the
    national scale. Similar to the models at field stations, the emphasis on various
    explanatory factors varies inconsistently among different ML models. The importance
    of lnSSM and lnRZSM at the national scale has increased compared to field stations,
    while the significance of ET shows the opposite trend, particularly in the MLR
    model. This shift may be attributed to the broader spatial impact of soil water
    storage dynamics. Regarding different crops, the distribution of permutation-based
    importance remains consistent between rice, wheat, and maize within the same model.
    For example, in the XGB model, all three cereal crops assign the highest importance
    to lnSSM (0.4, 0.39, and 0.39, respectively), while paying less attention to lnRZSM
    (0.09, 0.12, and 0.1, respectively). Figure 6 Open in figure viewer PowerPoint
    Permutation-based importance of explanatory factors at the city level. The error
    line represents the standard deviation of 2003–2013. Figure 7 displays the spatial
    distribution of predicted IWU at the city level. Geographically, the spatial patterns
    of estimates from each model remain largely consistent on a national scale. High
    IWU estimates for rice are clustered in the Lower-and-Middle reaches of the Yangtze
    River and the eastern coastal areas, while high IWU estimates for wheat and maize
    are concentrated in the North China Plain. However, the estimates of different
    models still show some discrepancies at a local level. Figure 7 Open in figure
    viewer PowerPoint Spatial patterns of average irrigation water use estimates in
    2003–2013 using different models. (a) Rice, (b) wheat, and (c) maize. Figure 8
    compares the predicted IWU from each model with the reported IWU for the three
    cereal crops. Rice exhibits the highest estimation accuracy, with R2 ranging from
    0.78 to 0.83 across the six models (average of 2003–2013), followed by wheat (0.68–0.76)
    and maize (0.53–0.64). Consistently, the KGE″ also indicates decreasing accuracy
    in the order of rice, wheat, and maize. Despite rice''s higher RMSE and MAE compared
    to the other crops, its estimation is considered the most reliable due to the
    higher irrigation needs for rice cultivation (Yin et al., 2022). Among the models,
    the BTCH method consistently yields the most robust results, with metrics ranking
    highest among the six models and exhibiting stable interannual errors. For instance,
    in rice, BTCH achieves the lowest RMSE, the second lowest MAE, the highest R2
    and a moderate KGE″. While the RF model also performs well in rice, it shows larger
    interannual errors than BTCH. These results highlight the excellent integration
    capability of the BTCH method. However, the performance of other ML models varies
    across different crops. The MLR model performs best in maize but ranks second
    to BTCH in rice and wheat. The SVM model performs well in rice but poorly in maize.
    Combining Figure 7, these results manifest the feasibility of using ML method
    for large-scale IWU estimation. Our study also shows the feasibility of using
    ML model varies with the environmental context. Nevertheless, the BTCH method
    effectively integrate these models to achieve more robust estimations (Shangguan
    et al., 2023). Additionally, we compared BTCH with an equal weighting approach
    (Table S2 in Supporting Information S1), affirming that BTCH delivers superior
    performance. The weights assigned by BTCH to various models (Table S3 in Supporting
    Information S1) tend to favor more accurate models, reducing systematic errors
    and resulting in higher weights. However, random errors also affect simulation
    results, leading to weights that may not perfectly correlate with model accuracy.

    The box-plots represent the interquartile range (box), mean and median (diamond
    and line within the box) of 2003–2013. Figure 9 illustrates model accuracy across
    various climatic regions, revealing differences in reported IWU averages for the
    three cereal crops based on aridity levels. Rice exhibits higher IWU requirements
    in humid regions compared to arid ones, resulting in elevated RMSE and MAE values
    for rice estimation in humid areas. However, there is no significant variance
    in the R2 and KGE″ values for rice across different climatic regions, suggesting
    minimal impact of aridity levels on the model''s performance in estimating rice
    IWU. Conversely, wheat and maize consistently demonstrate reduced RMSE, MAE, and
    average reported IWU with increasing humidity levels. Higher R2 and KGE″ for wheat
    are observed in semi-arid and semi-humid regions, with similar trends observed
    for maize. Figure 9 Open in figure viewer PowerPoint Metrics of Bayesian three-cornered
    hat with respect to dryness level. The bar and error line respectively represent
    the average and standard deviation of 2003–2013. Collectively, these IWU estimation
    biases result from a combination of climate-related fluctuations, crop-specific
    attribute, and the suitability of remote sensing products across different regions.
    Wheat and maize are sensitive to the local climate conditions, significantly affecting
    the accuracy of our estimation approach. In contrast, rice, thriving in humid
    conditions, maintains consistent performance across diverse climatic regions.
    This consistency may stem from the unique requirements of rice cultivation. Rice
    farmers often employ measures to preserve a humid planting environment, even in
    arid regions, through natural or artificial irrigation. As a result, while rice
    cultivation spans various climatic zones, the climate variations at the individual
    farm level may be less pronounced. Moreover, the quality of remote sensing products
    varies across climate regions, influencing IWU estimation accuracy. Our method
    tends to perform less effectively for wheat and maize in arid regions, largely
    due to the limited accuracy of ET products in such environments. Rice consistently
    outperforms wheat and maize, demonstrating greater drought resistance compared
    to wheat. Wheat performs well in semi-arid and semi-humid regions, with similar
    performance observed for maize. Variable importance analysis across different
    climate scenarios further supports these conclusions (Figure S5 in Supporting
    Information S1). We analyzed the total national IWU using both reported data and
    predicted data (after BTCH aggregation) from 2003 to 2013, as shown in Figure
    S6 in Supporting Information S1. Among the three cereal crops, the total reported
    IWU for rice and maize demonstrates a noticeable upward trend, with only a few
    years showing decreased IWU. Conversely, the total reported IWU for wheat displays
    a fluctuating pattern with a slight overall upward trend, though statistically
    insignificant. The predicted results mirror these overall trends, indicating the
    capability of the proposed framework to capture the interannual variability of
    IWU. 4.4 Model Uncertainty Analysis Both ET and precipitation are crucial factors
    in estimating IWU (K. Liu et al., 2019). To assess the impact of different products
    on model performance, we replaced the original input parameters at each time step
    with various alternatives, including MODIS ET, PML ET, ERA precipitation, and
    TRMM precipitation. The spatial patterns of these products can be found in Figures
    S7 and S8 in Supporting Information S1. Additionally, the spatial patterns of
    average IWU estimates (derived from BTCH) for the years 2003–2013 using different
    ET and precipitation products are presented in Figure S9 in Supporting Information
    S1. Figure 10 illustrates the effects of substituting different products on model
    performance, revealing noticeable changes, particularly across different crops.
    When replacing the original ET input (SEBAL ET) with MODIS ET or PML ET, a decline
    in model performance is observed for rice and maize. Conversely, both ET products
    decrease RMSE while increasing R2 in wheat. However, the mean relative change
    is negligible, with values below 3% for RMSE and less than 1% for R2 and KGE″,
    indicating that substituting the ET products may not substantially affect IWU
    estimation in wheat. Figure 10 Open in figure viewer PowerPoint Changes in model
    performance (Bayesian three-cornered hat) due to different evapotranspiration
    (ET) or precipitation products, compared to using SEBAL ET and Global Precipitation
    Measurement precipitation products. The box-plots represent the interquartile
    range (box), mean and median (diamond and line within the box) of 2003–2013. Comparing
    the original precipitation products (i.e., GPM) to TRMM precipitation, TRMM appears
    more suitable for estimating IWU in maize. This is evidenced by decreased RMSE
    and MAE, as well as increased R2 and KGE″. Both precipitation products show similar
    relative changes in rice, but deteriorated metrics suggest that the GPM precipitation
    product is more suitable for rice IWU estimation compared to ERA and TRMM. However,
    replacing the precipitation product does not obviously improve or worsen the model''s
    performance in the case of wheat, as the relative changes between the two precipitation
    products are ambiguous. In general, our initial ET product proves more conducive
    to model performance compared to MODIS ET and PML ET. While the uncertainty in
    precipitation products affects model accuracy, none of the individual products
    demonstrate a clear advantage over the others. Moreover, substituting ET and precipitation
    products does not fundamentally alter model performance (mean relative change
    <5%), highlighting the robustness of our proposed method. We further examined
    the impact of these products on model performance across different climatic regions
    (Figures S10 and S11 in Supporting Information S1). Changes in model performance
    remain within a stable range (<10%). However, there are specific scenarios with
    significant fluctuations that require attention, such as the choice of ET products
    when modeling wheat IWU in humid regions and the selection of precipitation products
    when modeling maize IWU in arid regions. Our study also reveals an interesting
    aspect of ML model performance: an asymmetry in its predictive capabilities. Specifically,
    the ML model excels in accurately capturing intermediate IWU values but tends
    to underestimate high values within the IWU range. This observation suggests that
    while the model effectively captures the dominant factors contributing to IWU,
    it may overlook subtle signals crucial for representing extreme IWU values, particularly
    those that are exceptionally high. There is no discernible pattern in the residuals
    of different ML models (Figures S12 and S13 in Supporting Information S1). However,
    all models exhibit a common pattern where overestimation or underestimation is
    most pronounced in the high reference IWU range with sparse samples. Such asymmetrical
    performance appears to be a common characteristic shared among various ML models.
    This phenomenon can be attributed, at least in part, to the limited availability
    of data pertaining to extreme regimes. The scarcity of data points in the high
    IWU range may hinder the ML model''s ability to adequately learn and generalize
    patterns associated with extreme values. The number of samples may also affect
    the performance of ML models and Bayesian methods. To clarify this issue, we varied
    the numbers of samples used to train ML model or generate BTCH weights. The results
    (Tables S4 and S5 in Supporting Information S1) indicate that the number of samples
    (IWU simulations provided by different ML models) does not significantly affect
    the integration capability of the BTCH method. However, overall model performance
    tends to decrease as the number of samples (reference IWU and related factors)
    decreases. This decrease in performance may stem from the challenge posed by small
    sample sizes, which can hinder the ML model from capturing complex patterns in
    the data, leading to inadequate fitting (K. Chen et al., 2020). 5 Discussions
    This study introduced two processes to enhance the detection of irrigation-related
    information. First, we addressed the potential nonlinear relationship between
    SM and IWU by transforming the original remote sensing SM product into its logarithmic
    form. Second, we developed a robust parameter called ResSM, intended to capture
    differences between satellite-based and reanalysis-based SM products in detecting
    irrigation events, particularly during rain-free periods. A similar study is discussed
    in S. V. Kumar et al. (2015), which validated the capability of remote sensing
    data sets to identify irrigation signals through a Kolmogorov-Smirnov test, comparing
    remote sensing SM with model-generated SM. While traditional approaches typically
    employed the extracted information as a parameter in water balance equations (Zohaib
    & Choi, 2020), our strategy involved incorporating ResSM as a feature to drive
    the ML model. To assess the effectiveness of these theory-guided mechanisms, we
    compared the model''s performance under different scenarios: one where the original
    SM was used instead of the natural logarithmic-transformed SM, and another where
    ResSM was excluded from the model. These scenarios were compared to the initial
    model that incorporates both mechanisms. As demonstrated in Figure 11, omitting
    these two physics-based processes generally results in increased RMSE and MAE
    for all three cereal crops, accompanied by decreased R2 and KGE″. This change
    is particularly pronounced in the case of maize but less conspicuous in rice and
    wheat. The discrepancy can be attributed to rice and wheat already achieving relatively
    satisfactory metrics compared to maize, making significant improvements more challenging.
    Our results indicate that these theory-guided strategies enhance the model''s
    performance. Converting the original SM into its logarithmic form led to a 1%
    and 4% improvement in KGE″ for rice and maize, respectively. However, for wheat,
    there was a 0.1% decrease in KGE″, primarily observed in arid regions, suggesting
    that the logarithmic transformation may be less suitable for such areas. Additionally,
    including ResSM resulted in a 0.4%, 0.7%, and 2% increase in KGE″ for rice, wheat,
    and maize, respectively. It''s worth noting that we employed a simple linear model
    to correct the systematic deviation between satellite and reanalysis products.
    Future research could explore advanced correction methods and utilize typical
    reanalysis data sets such as the China Meteorological Administration Land Data
    Assimilation System (CLDAS) to enhance the accuracy of ResSM data extraction.
    The reliability of our IWU estimation is substantiated by comparing our results
    with those of two earlier studies (Y. Chen et al., 2019; K. Zhang et al., 2022)
    (Figure S14 in Supporting Information S1). This comparison reveals a general consistency
    between our study and prior research. Notably, regions characterized by high IWU,
    such as Xinjiang, Henan, Shandong, and Jiangsu, consistently emerge as areas with
    high irrigation intensity. Figure 11 Open in figure viewer PowerPoint Mean relative
    change in Bayesian three-cornered hat metrics when excluding the soil moisture
    residuals feature or replacing lnSM with original soil moisture, in comparison
    to the initial model incorporating physical mechanisms. Previous studies (C. Zhang
    & Long, 2021; K. Zhang et al., 2022; Zohaib & Choi, 2020) focusing on IWU estimation
    often treated all crops as a single category due to challenges in discerning irrigation
    signals among different crops based on hydrological mechanisms. The irrigation
    area data used in these studies might not adequately distinguish between various
    types of croplands. To overcome these limitations, our research focuses on estimating
    IWU for three staple cereal crops in China, leveraging phenological information
    to extract parameters with higher precision. However, while ChinaCropPhen1km data
    set excels in monitoring phenological event, its capacity to differentiate the
    spatial distribution of crops is somewhat limited (Luo et al., 2020). To gauge
    the potential uncertainty associated with the ChinaCropPhen1km data set, we analyzed
    the cultivated area in each city as determined by the data set and compared it
    to the reported irrigated area provided by the Chinese Ministry of Water Resources.
    Figure 12 illustrates the results, revealing a strong linear relationship between
    the cultivated area calculated by ChinaCropPhen1km and the reported irrigated
    area, with a r of 0.82, 0.88, and 0.77 for rice, wheat, and maize, respectively.
    However, the cultivated area calculated by ChinaCropPhen1km generally exceeded
    the reported irrigated area, possibly due to the inclusion of rain-fed cropland
    in the data set. Since ML methods often employ standardized preprocessing of parameters,
    the impact of this overestimation of irrigated area may be mitigated. These findings
    suggest that the ChinaCropPhen1km data set performs reasonably well overall and
    enables crop-specific IWU estimation. Figure 12 Open in figure viewer PowerPoint
    Comparison between reported irrigated area and cultivated area calculated from
    ChinaCropPhen1km, with the black line representing the linear regression fitting.
    Our study aims to estimate IWU using ML methods, emphasizing its viability across
    different crops and on a large scale. Unlike traditional hydrological approaches
    reliant on complex physical relationships, ML methods offer improved robustness
    and transferability by avoiding the need for such elusive connections. Among the
    ML methods we investigated, the BTCH integration method emerges as particularly
    promising, demonstrating its potential within model ensembles. In addition to
    its integration capabilities, the BTCH method excels in harmonizing data from
    multiple remote sensing products, thereby reducing uncertainty (J. Liu et al.,
    2021; Shangguan et al., 2023). Given the uncertainty associated with multisource
    precipitation and ET products in our study, employing the BTCH method to synthesize
    these data sources could further enhance the accuracy of our model. Due to the
    limitations of the available reported IWU data at the city level, seamlessly extending
    our proposed method to the pixel level may pose challenges. Future efforts will
    concentrate on bridging this gap by integrating ML models with traditional hydrological
    methods, aiming to extend ML approaches to a finer pixel level. Additionally,
    with the rapid advancements in deep learning networks, exploring the application
    of more sophisticated models like the Long Short-Term Memory model could prove
    valuable, given its promising performance in simulating time series data (Cao
    et al., 2021; Guo et al., 2016). 6 Summary and Conclusions This study presents
    a hybrid framework for estimating the IWU of three staple cereal crops in China.
    Using ML techniques, we generated a high-quality time series data set for daily
    ET and SSM. Subsequently, we transformed the original SM into its logarithmic
    terms and extracted a novel irrigation-related parameter based on differences
    in detecting irrigation events between remote sensing SM products and reanalysis
    SM products. By coupling theory-guided strategies with ML techniques, the proposed
    framework accurately estimated IWU at both station-specific and national scales,
    with the BTCH method proving to be the most robust among the six models explored,
    demonstrating exceptional ensemble ability. Incorporating two physics-based processes
    effectively highlighted implicit irrigation information within SM data, enhancing
    overall model performance. These findings underscore the potential of the proposed
    framework for estimating IWU for staple cereal crops in China. The performance
    of our hybrid framework varied with regional dryness levels. We observed higher
    accuracy in estimating IWU for wheat and maize in semi-arid and semi-humid regions,
    while rice IWU estimation remained insensitive to humidity variations. In other
    words, wheat and maize showed greater sensitivity to dry conditions compared to
    rice, posing challenges in applying the framework in northern arid regions where
    wheat and maize dominate crop production. Additionally, we found that model accuracy
    was impacted by uncertainty in ET and precipitation products. Our daily SEBAL
    ET product demonstrated better applicability compared to MODIS and PML ET products.
    However, the effect of multisource precipitation products varied across different
    crops. These uncertainties did not compromise the model''s accuracy fundamentally,
    with the mean relative change consistently less than 5%. Overall, our hybrid framework
    for estimating IWU holds promise in addressing food security and promoting socio-economic
    stability, especially amidst mounting population growth and increasing food demand.
    Given prevailing water scarcity issues in China, such as groundwater depletion
    in the North China Plain due to prolonged overexploitation (Bai et al., 2022),
    our study offers valuable insights for effective water resource management. Furthermore,
    the proposed strategies hold potential for broader application beyond China''s
    borders, with future endeavors focusing on enhancing the framework and exploring
    its applicability on a global scale. Acknowledgments This study was supported

    With increasing demands for precise water resource management, there is a growing
    need for advanced techniques in mapping water bodies. The currently deployed satellites
    provide complementary data that are either of high spatial or high temporal resolutions.
    As a result, there is a clear trade-off between space and time when considering
    a single data source. For the efficient monitoring of multiple environmental resources,
    various Earth science applications need data at high spatial and temporal resolutions.
    To address this need, many data fusion methods have been described in the literature,
    that rely on combining data snapshots from multiple sources. Traditional methods
    face limitations due to sensitivity to atmospheric disturbances and other environmental
    factors, resulting in noise, outliers, and missing data. This paper introduces
    Hydrological Generative Adversarial Network (Hydro-GAN), a novel machine learning-based
    method that utilizes modified GANs to enhance boundary accuracy when mapping low-resolution
    MODIS data to high-resolution Landsat-8 images. We propose a new non-saturating
    loss function for the Hydro-GAN generator, which maximizes the log of discriminator
    probabilities to promote stable updates and aid convergence. By focusing on reducing
    squared differences between real and synthetic images, our approach enhances training
    stability and overall performance. We specifically focus on mapping water bodies
    using MODIS and Landsat-8 imagery due to their relevance in water resource management
    tasks. Our experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of Hydro-GAN in
    generating high-resolution water body maps, outperforming traditional methods
    in terms of boundary accuracy and overall quality. Key Points Remote sensing data

    Summary This study addresses the imperative challenges of water resource management,
    including coastal zone oversight, detecting sea border shifts due to rising waters,
    and erosion tracking. Satellite data currently offers a choice between high spatial
    detail with infrequent updates or lower spatial detail with more frequent updates,
    presenting a trade-off between data precision and frequency. To efficiently monitor
    environmental resources like water bodies, we require data with both high spatial
    detail and frequent updates. To meet this need, we introduce the Hydrological
    Generative Adversarial Network, a novel machine learning tool that enhances data
    clarity, particularly in outlining water bodies. In testing, we employed images
    from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer satellite, providing less
    detailed images, and the Land Remote-Sensing Satellite, offering highly detailed
    imagery. In essence, this study enhances water resource management by effectively
    combining data from multiple sources, even in adverse conditions, potentially
    advancing environmental protection and management efforts. 1 Introduction Water
    bodies monitoring is essential to guide evidence-based decision making which is
    necessary for hydrological and ecological sustainability (Njue et al., 2019).
    Surface water is an irreplaceable resource for ecological systems, human uses,
    industrial uses, hydro-power generation, social development, and recreation. Reliable
    information about the dynamic changes of open surface water (e.g., lakes, reservoirs,
    and rivers) is critically important for various scientific disciplines, such as
    flood prediction, coastal zone management, coast erosion, agricultural sustainability,
    watershed analysis, climate models, and the assessment of present and future water
    resources (Sarp & Ozcelik, 2017). Previous studies have suggested that lakes and
    reservoirs are good sentinels of global climate change because they are sensitive
    to environmental changes (Adrian et al., 2009). Recent advancement in satellite
    based-remote sensing information with different spatial, spectral, radiometric,
    and temporal resolutions has given new dimensions to the water bodies studies
    (Ismail et al., 2021). Following the increase in the availability of satellite
    images, and image processing techniques, numerous research studies have attempted
    to extract and delineate water bodies from these images (Ouma & Tateishi, 2006).
    These technological and methodological advancements, shift the analysis of surface
    water bodies from regional-scale to global scale for a better understanding of
    the Earth''s natural processes. Earth observation data is acquired through a large
    number of satellites that have unique spatiotemporal resolutions making them complementary
    data sources (Amato et al., 2020). In the 50 years since the first satellite launch,
    remote sensing satellites have evolved from producing low-resolution images to
    daily data acquisition exceeding 10 terabytes (Campbell & Wynne, 2011). This transformation
    is driven by Earth observation science, with over 150 observation satellites in
    orbit, equipped with sensors operating at various spatial and temporal resolutions
    (Fu et al., 2020). Due to the differences in sensor designs, there is often a
    trade-off in different spatiotemporal data resolutions across the remote sensing
    spectrum (Khandelwal, Karpatne, & Kumar, 2017). Figure 1 illustrates the spatiotemporal
    resolution of four active satellites which shows the aforementioned space and
    time trade-off. It can be noted that the highest spatial resolution satellite
    is compromising time resolution and vice versa. MODIS satellite data, obtained
    from both TERRA and AQUA instruments, observes the entire Earth''s surface every
    1–2 days. While the temporal resolution of individual MODIS observations is 8
    days, due to the combined coverage from both TERRA and AQUA satellites, data from
    the same location on Earth is acquired approximately every 8 days. On the other
    hand, Operational Land Imager (OLI) and Thermal Infrared Sensor (TIRS) sensors
    onboard the Landsat satellite capture the earth''s surface every 16 days but at
    a high spatial resolution (HSR) of 30 m (refer Figure 1). In other words, We utilize
    MODIS data, which is available in various spatial resolutions, including 250 m,
    500 m, and 1 km. For our study, we specifically employ MODIS data at a spatial
    resolution of 500 m. Additionally, Landsat data, captured by OLI with a spatial
    resolution of 30 m, is used in our research. TIRS on Landsat has a spatial resolution
    of 100 m. Given the limitation of individual sensors at either delivering HSR
    or high temporal cadence, it is essential to create interpolation techniques that
    can transmit information across spatiotemporal scales (Khandelwal, Karpatne, &
    Kumar, 2017). The knowledge transfer has the ability to equip the science communities
    with synthetic data sets that approximate real data on the go. For the case of
    water bodies interpolation, one of the desirable properties of the method is to
    achieve interpolated water bodies that are similar to the ground truth data in
    both shape and area. Figure 1 Open in figure viewer PowerPoint Spatial and temporal
    resolutions of earth''s different satellites. High spatiotemporal resolution data
    will allow timely monitoring of the surface water and dynamics which are crucial
    elements for policy and decision-makers in hydrology and geomorphology (Maiti
    & Bhattacharya, 2009). Furthermore, interpolated data will facilitate the integration
    of remote sensing data with Geographic Information Systems for automatic or semiautomatic
    water body extraction and mapping (Sarp & Ozcelik, 2017). In the light of the
    aforementioned need for a flexible spatiotemporal resolution domain, in this paper,
    we propose a method that aims to learn a mapping between low spatial resolution
    (LSR) image instances and HSR image instances of water bodies and reservoirs collected
    across a period of 7 years from MODIS and Landsat satellites. The proposed mapping
    can be utilized to generate HSR data at times when only LSR data is available.
    Our contributions are as follows: We designed an image processing pipeline that
    uses computer vision tools to extract target water bodies'' polygon boundaries
    from satellite imagery. We developed a new Generative Adversarial Network (GAN)
    for mapping the data between any LSR-HSR satellite pair. We made our source code
    and data open-source in a project website (https://sites.google.com/view/hydro-ml/)
    that meets the principles of Findability, Accessibility, Interoperability, and
    Reusability (FAIR) (Wilkinson et al., 2016). Our contribution can help in extracting
    the precise shape and area of a water body which can further be used to measure
    the expansion or shrinking of a water body over a period of time. This can be
    crucial as water body extraction is an important task in different disciplines,
    such as lake coastal zone management, coastline change, and erosion monitoring,
    flood prediction, climate and environmental change, and evaluation of water resources
    (Haghnazar et al., 2024; Hosseinzadeh et al., 2023, 2024; Jiang et al., 2018).
    Timely monitoring of surface water and delivering data on the dynamics of surface
    water are also essential for policy and decision-making processes (Sarp & Ozcelik,
    2017). It can also help in detecting the changes in urban water bodies that make
    a huge difference to human lives and may cause disasters, such as surface subsidence,
    urban inland inundation, and health problems (Y. Chen et al., 2018). The rest
    of the paper is organized as follows: in Section 1 we review the related works;
    in Section 6 we define the architecture of our proposed GAN-based method and its
    different variants; in Section 24 we discuss the results and evaluation of our
    experiments. We introduce a case study on Lake Thathar in Section 29. Finally,
    Section 30 concludes the paper and shows potential directions for future works.
    1.1 Background on LSR-HSR Image Mapping Early efforts to learn surface water mapping
    between LSR and HSR images include supervised learning methods of remote sensing
    images (Khandelwal, Karpatne, & Kumar, 2017). Factors such as noise, outliers,
    and enormous volumes of missing data (due to clouds and sensor failures) can impact
    the accuracy of the aforementioned classification systems. To overcome the latter
    limitations, a new approach has emerged called the Ordering Based Information
    Transfer Across Space and time (ORBIT) (Khandelwal, Karpatne, & Kumar, 2017).
    The fundamental idea behind ORBIT is to take advantage of the natural ordering
    of instances that results from the elevation structure and temporal context. Specifically,
    if an area is filled with water, it is interpreted that due to the gravity all
    the regions in the basin with lower elevation than the current area are also occupied
    by water (Pekel et al., 2016). One key assumption in this approach is that a water
    body always expands and contracts smoothly (with the exception of floods and other
    natural phenomena) which suggests that the surface area of the water body at close
    time steps are highly similar (Khandelwal, Karpatne, Marlier, et al., 2017). To
    put it another way, the water surface extents of dates close together are likely
    to be highly similar. Hence, ORBIT can map data from LSR to HSR data only at time
    steps when noiseless LSR data is available (Khandelwal, Karpatne, & Kumar, 2017).
    1.2 Background on Planform Change Use Case For the use case of channel planform
    change analysis in river bodies, the change of a water body channel is due to
    natural or human-made fluctuations in the streamflow or sediment supply (Leonard
    et al., 2020). It has been found that although recurrent images from remote sensing
    satellites have been widely used to measure the channel change, these measurements
    are only significant if the measure of the change is more than the uncertainty
    threshold (Leonard et al., 2020). To address this challenge, a generalized method
    was introduced by Christina M. et al. for quantifying the uncertainty associated
    with measurements of channel change from remote sensing images based on spatially
    varying estimates of uncertainty called the spatially distributed probabilistic
    (SDP) method (Leonard et al., 2020). The SDP approach leverages image co-registration
    error, interpretation uncertainty, and digitization uncertainty for quantifying
    uncertainty. It has been established that SDP can be used to calculate uncertainty
    at specific locations of linear channel adjustment or polygons of erosion and
    deposition, while also estimating the central tendency of the net planform change.
    1.3 Background on Data Pre-Processing Prior to building the LSR to HSR data mapping,
    it is necessary to build a data pipeline that prepares the LSR-HSR corresponding
    data pairs. For this purpose, if the scope of the study is limited to a few water
    bodies, it is common to use data maps that extract the apriori known polygons
    (Frazier & Page, 2000; Muster et al., 2013). Image processing techniques have
    also been used recently for automatically extracting the water bodies'' outlines
    from satellite data without any apriori map knowledge (Rokni et al., 2014). Single-band
    methods are automated polygon extraction approaches that utilize a selected threshold
    value to extract water bodies'' boundaries. Similarly, multi-band methods combine
    different reflective bands for improved surface water extraction (Rokni et al.,
    2014). The weakness of using a pixel threshold is that it is prone to errors caused
    by the mixing of water pixels with those of different cover types. A more sophisticated
    approach for automated polygon extraction is to employ image segmentation. The
    latter technique is relatively more accurate compared with single-band methods
    (Rokni et al., 2014). 1.4 Background on Generative Networks GAN models have been
    used in a variety of applications, including image synthesis, semantic image editing,
    style transfer, and classification (Goodfellow et al., 2014). These networks not
    only learn the mapping from an input image to an output image but also learn a
    loss function to train this mapping. This makes it possible to apply the same
    generic approach to problems that traditionally would require very different loss
    formulations (Isola et al., 2016). Regular GANs hypothesize the discriminator
    as a classifier with the sigmoid cross-entropy loss function (Mao et al., 2016).
    In this paper, we develop a machine learning-empowered synthetic satellite that
    is capable of spatiotemporal interpolation across a pair of real satellites. Our
    approach is built on the GAN model that we used to accurately represent water
    bodies'' shapes and generate realistic synthetic HSR image instances at times
    when no measurements are available. Our proposed model pertains to the unsupervised
    learning paradigm that is capable of learning deep representations without extensively
    labeled training data. The novelty of our approach consists of deriving back-propagation
    signals through a competitive training process involving a pair of competing networks.
    Our GAN architecture utilizes a generator model and a discriminator model, where
    the first model is used to generate new synthetic images, and the second model
    is used to classify the data as either real or synthetic. The two competing models
    are trained concurrently in an adversarial process, where the role of the generator
    is to mislead the discriminator, on the other hand, the discriminator tries to
    detect the generated images (Goodfellow et al., 2014). 2 Methodology and Data
    Sources An ideal LSR-HSR image mapping method produces images that accurately
    describe the shape of the water bodies'' boundaries. For this purpose, we develop
    a machine-learning model (i.e., a GAN model) that is specifically equipped to
    focus on the shape and areal accuracy of the water bodies'' interpolated polygons.
    To better represent the polygon ground truth shapes, we use an optimization algorithm
    that minimizes the loss with respect to the polygon shapes. Our model is trained
    on historical image data captured from both Landsat and MODIS satellites that
    are HSR and LSR respectively (L. Yu et al., 2018). In this section, we will discuss
    the data preprocessing pipeline and the proposed model. 2.1 Water Bodies Data
    Sources Our data set is collected from MODIS and Landsat Earth Observation satellites.
    Figure 2 shows a sample of LSR water bodies captured onboard MODIS and their corresponding
    HSR captured by the Landsat satellite. MODIS is a key instrument aboard the Terra
    and Aqua satellites. While Terra''s orbit around the Earth is timed so that it
    passes from north to south across the equator in the morning, Aqua passes south
    to north over the equator in the afternoon (Justice et al., 2002). Terra MODIS
    and Aqua MODIS are viewing the entire Earth''s surface every 1–2 days, acquiring
    data in 36 spectral bands, or groups of wavelengths (Barnes et al., 2003). We
    used Terra MODIS with bands 1-2-1 and 7-2-1 to obtain 256 by 256 pixel size images,
    as the bands allow the separation between the water bodies and land surfaces (refer
    Figure 2a). The data collected from the MODIS sensors are merged at a temporal
    resolution of 8 days and a spatial resolution of 500 m. It is important to note
    that although the temporal resolution of MODIS is 1 day, the satellite acquires
    data from the same location on Earth approximately every 8 days. This is known
    as the 8-day repeating cycle (i.e., MODIS 8-day composite) (Y. Chen et al., 2013).
    Landsat 8 consists of two data collection instruments called OLI and TRIS. The
    two sensors collect data at a temporal resolution of 16 days. OLI provides a spatial
    resolution of 30 m, capturing visible and near-infrared bands, while TIRS has
    a spatial resolution of 100 m, focusing on thermal infrared bands (Verpoorter
    et al., 2012). We used bands 7-4-3 and 1-5-7 to obtain the images of water bodies
    (refer Figure 2b). Likewise, we used 256 by 256 pixel size images for Landsat.
    The multi-band method takes advantage of reflective differences of each involved
    band and extracts water based on the analysis of signature differences between
    water and others (Qiao et al., 2012). Our data set contains 20 reservoirs, across
    7 years from 2015 to 2021. We have a total of 6,720 images of MODIS sensors and
    3,360 images of Landsat 8 satellite. In our study, we utilized satellite data
    products from both MODIS and Landsat. For MODIS, we employed Level 1B products,
    which include radiometrically calibrated and geolocated data. These Level 1B products
    undergo geometric correction, making them suitable for our mapping purposes. Regarding
    Landsat, we utilized Level 1T products, which are terrain-corrected and georeferenced.
    We have outlined more details on the water bodies used in this study in the Appendix
    section. Following the FAIR guiding principles, we have made our data sets publicly
    accessible on the project website. Figure 2 Open in figure viewer PowerPoint Images
    from MODIS and Landsat satellites of (1) Kariba reservoir (Zambia), (2) Lake Thathar
    (Iraq), (3) Lake Argyle (Australia), and (4) Lake Nasser (Egypt). 2.2 Data Pre-Processing
    Prior to the HSR-LSR mapping process, we curated our image data sets to obtain
    cleaned machine-learning ready data. We applied computer vision methods to extract
    the shapes of the water bodies'' polygons. The image processing step involves
    extracting useful metadata from the image. In this case, the metadata is the shape
    of the water bodies'' polygons. Our data curation is a four-step process that
    is shown in Figure 3 and described in Algorithm 1. The steps are (a) convert the
    input images to Hue Saturation and Value (HSV) format (lines 3–4), (b) binarize
    the image into a black-and-white format (lines 5–8), (c) denoise the image using
    morphological operations (lines 9–11), and (d) apply an image mask to extract
    the water body polygons. Figure 3 Open in figure viewer PowerPoint Data pre-processing
    pipeline. While existing methods on segmentation-based methods for water bodies
    extraction are powerful techniques for water bodies image analysis tasks, but
    have a limited capacity to capture fine-grained details and nuances in water bodies,
    especially in cases where the polygon boundaries are not well-defined (Verma et
    al., 2021; Xia et al., 2020). Therefore, our proposed data pre-processing pipeline
    (i.e., binarization and morphological operations) offers a better approach to
    accurate boundary extraction. Binarizing the image and applying morphological
    operators are essential steps in image processing for accurate water body detection
    and shape extraction. On one hand, the binarization process simplifies the image
    by converting it into a binary format, where pixels are categorized as either
    foreground (object of interest) or background. On the other hand, morphological
    operations, such as erosion, dilation, opening, and closing, are valuable for
    enhancing and refining the edges of objects in the binary image. These operations
    can fill gaps, connect broken lines, and smoothen object boundaries. The first
    step involved converting the colored image in Red Green Blue (RGB) into HSV color
    space image. This step is crucial as the HSV color space is the most efficient
    image format for color-based image segmentation (T.-W. Chen et al., 2008). The
    HSV color conversion also enables the normalization of colors across images captured
    from satellites that have water bodies of different colors relative to their surroundings.
    The HSV color space consists of three matrices, hue, saturation, and value whose
    ranges are (0–179), (0–255), and (0–255) respectively (Loesdau et al., 2014).
    While the hue represents the color, saturation measures the amount to which the
    given color (hue) is mixed with white. The value matrix represents the amount
    to which the given color (hue) is mixed with black. Algorithm 1. Data Pre-Processing

    polygonMask(:, :, 1) ← 255 − newImage polygonMask(:, :, 2) ← 255 − newImage extracted
    ← append(polygonMask) end for return extracted The second step of the data pipeline
    involves binarizing the converted grayscale input images by converting them to
    black and white pixels. The latter step reduces the domain of colors contained
    in the image from 256 shades of gray to a binary set (black or white). To achieve
    the binarization, we first perform a hyperparameter search for a water body-color
    pixel threshold value based on the distribution of grayscale pixels in the image.
    We then establish that the pixel is converted to white (value of zero) if the
    grayscale value of the pixels is greater than the threshold. Similarly, if the
    grayscale value of the pixel is lower than the threshold, then it is converted
    into black (value of one). Both MODIS and Landsat images follow an identical pre-processing,
    which involves converting their original RGB format into grayscale and subsequently
    into a binarized image. The third data processing step consists of removing the
    outliers and noise patches around the water body by applying morphological operations
    to the binary images. The morphological operations rely on the relative ordering
    of the pixel values with respect to their values in order to infer outliers (Comer
    & Delp, 1999). In this operation, we probe an image with a small shape or template
    called a structuring element. The structuring element is positioned at all of
    the possible locations in the image and it is compared with the corresponding
    pixel neighborhood. We employed two groups of morphological operations. On one
    hand, the first operation group tests whether the structuring element touches
    or intersects the neighborhood, which is governed by the θerosion parameter in
    Algorithm 1. On the other hand, the second operation group test whether the structuring
    element fits well within the neighborhood, which is governed by the θdilation
    parameter in Algorithm 1. This is known as morphological opening, and it removes
    small objects (noise) from an image while preserving the shape and size of larger
    objects in the image. Figure 4 shows an example of a morphological opening that
    removes the noisy patches from the original image (Said et al., 2016). The resulting
    binary image contains a non-zero value only if the structuring element morphological
    tests are successful at a location in the input image. Finally, the last step
    consists of applying a color mask to the binary image that extracts the shape
    of the water body in the form of a polygon. Figure 5 illustrates the entire data
    pipeline steps using two MODIS LSR images (previously shown in Figure 2a). Figure

    Kariba reservoir (Zambia) and Lake Argyle (Australia) MODIS images that are transformed

    extraction. 2.3 Hydrological Generative Adversarial Network (Hydro-GAN) Our proposed
    Hydrological Generative Adversarial Network (Hydro-GAN) is an image-to-image translation
    model that transforms imagery from the LSR domain to the HSR domain by learning
    the non-linear mapping between the two. The data product will directly enrich
    the current HSR data sets at times when only LSR data are available. We used GAN
    frameworks as the backbone of our proposed model. Our motive for utilizing GAN
    is their ability to generate crispy sharp images (C. Li et al., 2017). These networks
    provide a way to learn deep representations without requiring any extensively
    annotated training data. GAN models are able to learn the representations by deriving
    back-propagation signals through a competitive process involving a pair of networks
    (Martinez & Heiner, 2020). Hydro-GAN is an unsupervised learning model that automatically
    learns the regularities and patterns in the input data and tries to mimic the
    same patterns when generating synthetic samples. The success of Hydro-GAN is determined
    by the output plausibility in comparison with the original data set. Hydro-GAN
    is composed of two sub-models Hydro-GEN and Hydro-DIS. The first sub-model is
    the generator model which is trained to generate new synthetic images. The second
    sub-model is the discriminator model that tries to classify the generated water
    body image as either are real (from the HSR domain) or synthetic (i.e., created
    by the Hydro-GEN sub-model). While Hydro-DIS learns to optimize its loss function,
    Hydro-GEN learns to fool the Hydro-DIS discriminator model. As such, the two Hydro-GAN
    sub-models are trained simultaneously in an adversarial process where the generator
    seeks to better fool the discriminator and the discriminator seeks to better identify
    the synthetic generated water bodies images. Hydro-GEN learns a mapping from a
    random input x in latent space to an output y that matches the data distribution
    of the HSR Landsat images: G : x → y (Goodfellow et al., 2014). Hydro-GEN utilizes
    a conditional generative adversarial network (cGAN), where the output y is conditioned
    on some input z, resulting in a mapping: G : (x, z) → y (Goodfellow et al., 2014).
    The generator is trained via adversarial loss, and an additional soft Dynamic
    Time Warping (DTW) loss term, calculated between the synthetic image and the ground
    truth water body images. This added loss motivates the generator to develop accurate
    water body shapes that match the shape signatures of the original water bodies.
    In this context, randomness refers to the incorporation of unpredictable and stochastic
    input values, drawn from probability distributions, to introduce variability and
    produce diverse and data-matching outputs. Equation 1 defines the objective function
    that a traditional GAN network is optimizing for. (1) In Equation 1 D(z, y) refers
    to the probability that a sample image y pertains to the real data set given the
    condition z. E is the expected value over all the real image data instances. G(x,
    z) refers to the synthetic image samples conditioned on z. D(z, G(x, z)) is the
    discriminator''s estimate of the probability that a synthetic instance is real.
    The discriminator D attempts to maximize the function, on the other hand, the
    generator G attempts to do the opposite. The generator can''t directly affect
    the log(D(x)) term in the function, so, for the generator, minimizing the loss
    is equivalent to minimizing log(1 − D(G(z))). 2.3.1 Hydrological Generator (Hydro-GEN)
    Model Our proposed Hydro-GEN sub-model is an encoder-decoder model that uses a
    U-Net design (Ronneberger et al., 2015). The model takes a source water body pre-processed
    LSR image and generates a target HSR image. The model accomplishes this by first
    down-sampling the input image to the final layer, then up-sampling this layer''s
    data back to the dimensions of the output image (Ronneberger et al., 2015). The
    most prominent patterns from the input LSR image are learned to be retained and
    encoded in the bottleneck layer prior to constructing the output HSR image representation.
    The U-Net architecture contains skip-connections that connect the corresponding
    sampling layers. The skip connections are used to pass the low-level data of the
    HSR image through the bottleneck layer. The generator model consists of standardized
    blocks of convolution layers, with batch normalization, dropout, and activation
    applied to it. Figure 6 shows the skip connections used by the U-Net network (Goodfellow
    et al., 2014). While both U-Net and Hydro-GEN models share the same foundational
    structure involving an encoder-decoder design, Hydro-GEN focuses on generating
    high-resolution water body images from low-resolution inputs, making it particularly
    suited for remote sensing applications. Hydro-GEN incorporates unique loss functions,
    including adversarial, L1, and DTW losses, to address the challenges specific
    to water body image enhancement. Figure 6 Open in figure viewer PowerPoint Architecture
    of Hydro-GEN and Hydro-DIS sub-models of the Hydro-GAN applied on Lake Mead (part
    of the Colorado River). The Hydro-GEN model is trained via the Hydro-DIS model.
    The weighting of the Hydro-GEN model is updated to reflect the discriminator loss
    when predicting synthetic images as either real or generated (known as the adversarial
    loss). Hydro-GEN is penalized when generating synthetic samples that are easily
    distinguishable by Hydro-DIS from the real training data distribution. The Hydro-GEN
    weighting is also updated to minimize the L1 between the synthetic images and
    the original ground truth image, which represents the mean absolute error between
    these images. The final objective function is made of a weighted sum of the combination
    of these losses. The weights range between 1 and 100 in favor of the adversarial
    loss and vice versa. We used weighting between the two losses to find an optimal
    balance between adversarial and L1 losses that can maximize the synthetic image
    plausibility. A detailed summary of our Hydro-GEN model''s architecture in Appendix
    32. 2.3.2 Hydrological Discriminator (Hydro-DIS) Model The Hydro-DIS model is
    a deep convolutional neural network model that performs image classification based
    on some conditions (Tran et al., 2017). Hydro-DIS takes both the LSR source image
    and the target HSR image pairs as input and classifies the target image as real
    of synthetic. The Hydro-DIS model is designed using the Effective Receptive Field,
    which are the regions that contain input pixels with a non-negligible impact (Luo
    et al., 2017). ERFs provide a one-to-many mapping between the pixels in the LSR
    input image and the pixels in the HSR target image. The chance that a region in
    the input image is real is determined by each value of the model activation map.
    The average of these values is used to generate an overall classification score
    for the input images. The architecture of our Hydro-DIS model is shown in Figure
    6. A detailed summary of our Hydro-DIS model''s architecture in Appendix 33. 2.3.3
    Hydro-GAN Training Challenges There are several challenges that perturb the training
    process of the Hydro-GAN model. One of the major issues is that the original minimax
    loss function can cause the Hydro-GAN to get stuck in a local minimum at the early
    stages of training when the Hydro-DIS discriminator''s job is relatively easier
    than Hydro-GEN generator (Dwivedi, 2022). Ideally, Hydro-GAN should learn patterns
    represented in different water bodies'' locations and avoid building expertise
    only in a subset of the training data distribution (Hui, 2018). The second challenge
    is the gradient vanishing problem that might occur if the Hydro-DIS discriminator
    performs significantly better than the generator (Dwivedi, 2022). 2.3.4 Hydro-GAN
    Loss Functions To overcome the two aforementioned challenges, we propose to explore
    a new loss function. First, we modify the traditional GAN model defined in Equation
    1 to be non-saturating. To achieve non-saturation, we use a variation of the standard
    loss function where instead of minimizing the log(1 − D(G(z))) in Equation 1,
    the generator maximizes the log of the discriminator probabilities that is, −log(D(G(z))).
    This change is inspired by depicting the problem from a different outlook, where
    the generator is trained to maximize the likelihood of images being real, instead
    of minimizing the likelihood of an image being synthetic. This avoids generator
    saturation through a more stable weight update mechanism (Dwivedi, 2022). The
    second loss adjustment that we propose is to use a least-squares loss, where the
    Hydro-DIS is trained to effectively reduce the sum of the squared difference between
    generated and original values for real and synthetic images as defined in Equation
    2. Similarly, the generator seeks to minimize the sum of the squared difference
    between predicted and expected values as though the generated images were real
    as defined in Equation 3. One advantage of using least-squares loss is that it
    produces a significant adjustment to the model in case of large errors, which
    helps in preventing the vanishing gradient (Mao et al., 2016). (2) (3) Along with
    using non-saturating and least-squares losses, we also propose a new DTW loss
    term that assesses the generator''s accuracy in producing accurate boundary shapes.
    DTW algorithm is an elastic distance measure that has demonstrated good performance
    with sequence-based data, and in particular, time-series data (Muller, 2007).
    Our motivation for adding a DTW loss is that it emphasizes the polygon shape accuracy
    which equips the generator to better fool the discriminator. Our new generator
    loss, defined in Equation 4, is now a weighted sum of the cross-entropy adversarial
    loss , the L1 loss , and the DTW loss . (4) where is the adversarial loss is the
    probabilistic loss which is also used in the discriminator. loss is the mean absolute
    error in the synthetic and the original images. loss is our proposed loss which
    minimizes the difference between the Euclidean distance of generated and expected
    polygons from their respective centroids to the boundary coordinates. We hypothesize
    that the traditional adversarial and L1 losses contributions are different than
    the DTW loss given that they optimize the Hydro-GEN and Hydro-DIS losses and the
    shape accuracy loss respectively. Therefore we weighted the loss terms using a
    β parameter than can be used to balance the terms. (5) We evaluated the synthetic
    polygon accuracy using the Fréchet Inception Distance (FID), which is a measure
    for evaluating generative models (Y. Yu et al., 2021). The FID metric is defined
    as the squared Wasserstein metric between two multidimensional Gaussian distributions
    of the real and synthetic data. FID uses the Inceptionv3 model to show the similarity
    between two groups of images by using the computer vision features of the images
    (Szegedy et al., 2015). The FID is defined in Equation 6. (6) where is the distribution
    of the neural network features of the images generated by the GAN model and is
    the distribution of the same neural network features of the real images used to
    train the GAN model. tr() represents the trace of a matrix. The trace of a square
    matrix is the sum of its diagonal elements. μ is the mean vector of the neural
    network features obtained from the images generated by the GAN model and σ is
    the covariance matrix of the neural network features obtained from the images
    generated by the GAN model. A low FID score indicates that the two groups of images
    are similar, while a higher score suggests that the images have dissimilar characteristics.
    2.4 Experimental Methodology An ideal LSR to HSR mapping should produce a water
    body polygon that is similar in area, shape, and distance with respect to the
    original HSR polygon. To achieve this purpose, we evaluate the generated polygons
    against the ground truth polygons by using three criteria: areal, shape, and distance
    accuracy. Jaccard and Cosine measurements were chosen for assessing the areal
    precision. For evaluating the shape and distance measures, the DTW similarity
    metric was utilized. Each metric will be described in detail in the subsections
    that follow, along with its utility and drawbacks. 2.4.1 Areal Accuracy Measures
    Areal accuracy assesses the correctness of the area-generated water bodies when
    compared to the area of the HSR ground truth. Prior to generating the area of
    the water bodies'' polygons, we first used the contour detection tool in OpenCV
    that detects the boundary of the polygons. The polygon contours are considered
    as the curve joining all the continuous points (along the boundary), having the
    same color or intensity. The process of creating the polygon contour/boundary
    based on an input image is shown in the Figure 7b. The area similarity is computed
    using the Jaccard and Cosine similarity indices based on the extracted polygon
    boundaries. Figure 7 Open in figure viewer PowerPoint An input (a) water body
    image (Qapshaghay Bogeni Reservoir) used to extract the (b) water body polygon
    and (c) the shape signature based on the centroid distances. 2.4.2 Jaccard Similarity
    Index The Jaccard similarity index is a metric that compares the area of two polygons
    in Euclidean space by quantifying the ratio of the shared area (intersection)
    between the two polygons with respect to their combined areas (Union): (7) This
    similarity metric follows the property of scale invariance, as it evaluates the
    size of the common area in relation to the combined area of the two polygons (Boubrahimi,
    Aydin, Kempton, & Angryk, 2016; Boubrahimi et al., 2018). 2.4.3 Cosine Similarity
    Index The Cosine similarity index is a metric that compares the area of two polygons
    in Euclidean space by quantifying the ratio of the shared area (intersection)
    between the two polygons with respect to the square root of the product of the
    two areas (Boubrahimi, Aydin, Kempton, Mahajan, & Angryk, 2016; Boubrahimi et
    al., 2018). (8) The areal similarity metrics range between zero and one hundred
    and the higher the metric values the better the areal match of the real (Preal)
    and generated polygons. Algorithm 2. Shape Signature Derivation Input: The polygon

    cy], [point[0], point[1]]) ⊳ Calculating distance from centroid dist ← append(distance)
    end for return (dist) 2.4.4 Shape and Distance Measure To measure the shape and
    distance accuracy of the ground truth and generated polygons, we created a shape
    signature of the polygons. A shape signature is a sequence of time-ordered distance
    values between the polygon coordinates and a reference point in the plane. In
    this work, we consider the centroid of the polygon as the reference point. We
    retrieved the centroids of the water body polygons and created a time series of
    distances by using the Euclidean distance measure between the extracted centroid
    and the contour point coordinates (edge coordinates) in a clockwise manner. This
    time series was used to create the polygon shape signatures. Algorithm 2 describes
    the shape signature derivation algorithm. Figure 7c shows an example of the distance
    between the polygon centroid and its point coordinates. Finally, DTW was applied
    to compare the shape signatures of the generated and the real polygons. 2.4.5
    Dynamic Time Warping Metric DTW method is defined in Algorithm 3 (Giorgino, 2009).
    The two input shape signatures are organized in the form of a n × m matrix by
    using DTW algorithm where n and m are the lengths of the inputs. The lower left
    corner of the matrix is treated as the starting point for the matrix. The value
    of every cell in the matrix is calculated by measuring the distance between relative
    elements of the two input time series. As we move from the lower-left corner to
    the top-right corner of the matrix, we calculate the accumulated distance. The
    path that gives the minimum accumulated distance is considered as the ideal alignment
    between the two input time series. This path is referred to as the warping path
    and the total accumulated distance on this path is known as the warping distance.
    In an ideal situation, the input time series are identical and the warping path
    comes out to be a straight line from the lower-left corner to the top-right corner
    of the matrix, which results in a zero warping distance. Algorithm 3. Algorithm

    while cost_mat = updateCostMatrix(cost_mat) return path, cost_mat The mathematical
    form of DTW algorithm as accepted in the literature is shown in Equation 9. N
    and M are the lengths of the input time series x and y. Initially the D matrix
    is initialized to D0,0 = 0 and Di,j = ∞. The square of the differences between
    yj and xi is generally used as the cost function g in Equation 9. (9) In addition
    to using DTW as a loss term, we used DTW as a dissimilarity measure by calculating
    the optimal matching between the two shape signatures. We used DTW to match the
    points of the polygon by aligning their centroid shape signatures. The DTW algorithm
    generates a warping distance between the two input time series, which indicates
    the discrepancy between the two shapes. The greater the warping distance, the
    greater the difference between the two polygon shape signatures. Table 1 shows
    the summary of the areal and shape evaluation metrics that were used in this paper,
    along with their advantages and drawbacks. Table 1. Summary of Areal and Shape

    poorly with polygons that are very large or small [0, 100] Cosine similarity Effective

    shapes that have highly different areas [0, 100] DTW Effective for shape similarity

    and requires shape alignment [0, ∞] 2.5 Data Set Preparation Prior to training
    Hydro-GAN, we created image data pairs that map each curated MODIS image and its
    corresponding curated Landsat image that was captured during the same day. The
    data set was split into a training set and a testing set. We reserved 90% of the
    image data pairs from each reservoir for the training, and the remaining 10% image
    data pairs were used for testing. Namely, 672 out of 6,720 MODIS satellite images
    and 336 out of 3,360 Landsat-8 images were included in the test set. 3 Results
    and Discussion 3.1 Hydro-GAN Hyper-Parameter Search To identify the optimal weights
    that produce the highest polygon accuracy based on FID, we performed a grid search
    of the weight parameters, defined in Equation 5. We trained our proposed hydro-GAN
    model on different weight ratios. Figure 8 shows a heatmap that summarizes the
    FID scores obtained by each model when trained on different β weights, ranging
    from 1 to 100 for balancing the , and losses. Figure 8 Open in figure viewer PowerPoint
    Fréchet Inception Distance (FID) metric of Hydro-GAN generated polygons with β
    values ranging from 0 to 100. The lower the FID value, the better (i.e., the generated
    and target polygons are similar). The result in Figure 8 reveals that when more
    weight is assigned to the DTW loss, the Hydro-GAN model generates images that
    are more similar to the target images. This is reflected by the low FID scores
    that are approximating a value of zero. Specifically, the lowest FID scores (of
    0.2) were obtained in the top right corner, where β ∈ [90 − 100], which indicates
    that the generated images are significantly similar to the ground truth. Following
    the same line of thought, when the β weight is small, the FID scores are high
    which signifies that the Hydro-GAN loss is overpowered by the adversarial and
    L1 losses (refer to the bottom left corner of Figure 8). Selecting an equal weight
    (β = 50) for the adversarial and distance losses does not achieve optimality.
    From the aforementioned observations, we trained our Hydro-GAN model using the
    β value of 100. 3.2 Hydro-GAN Training Result After identifying the optimal weight
    ratios from Figure 8, we evaluate our proposed Hydro-GAN model based on the generated
    HSR images from the LSR MODIS image inputs. We compare the HSR-generated output
    with the original HSR Landsat ground truth images. Figure 9 shows the evolution
    of the input LSR image after being fed to the Hydro-GAN model in comparison with
    the ground truth HSR image captured by Landsat. Figure 9a shows an input LSR MODIS
    image fed to the Hydro-GAN model and a temporary results that were learned after
    30 epochs (Figure 9b) and after 100 epochs (Figure 9c). The results indicate that
    the model learning curve is improving when comparing the shape and area of the
    generated polygons after 30 and 100 epochs. After 100 iterations, the generated
    water body polygon morphology is similar to the polygon contained in the ground
    truth HSR Landsat image as shown in Figure 9d. After training our Hydro-GAN model
    for 100 epochs, we measured the accuracy of the model by conducting a quantitative
    analysis of the test set images based on three evaluation criteria: areal, shape,
    and distance accuracy as discussed in Section 14. Figure 9 Open in figure viewer
    PowerPoint (a) Example input MODIS image from Qapshaghay Bogeni Reservoir (Kazakhstan)
    fed to Hydro-GAN and transformed into (b) an high spatial resolution after 30
    training epochs (2) and (c) 100 training epochs compared to the (d) ground truth
    Landsat image. 3.2.1 Areal Accuracy Result To measure the areal accuracy between
    the generated polygons (from the Hydro-GAN model using the test data set) and
    the ground truth HSR Landsat polygons, we used the Jaccard and Cosine similarity
    percentages as illustrated in Figure 10. The figure shows the histogram plot of
    Jaccard and Cosine similarity metrics when assessed on the entire testing data
    of LSR-HSR image pairs. The results of the Jaccard distribution indicate a good
    agreement between the generated and the original Landsat polygons with a high
    similarity percentage, ranging approximately between 86% and 95%. A similar result
    was also obtained from the Cosine histogram distribution where the values span
    approximately from 87% to 97%. This indicates that there is a strong correlation
    between Jaccard and Cosine metrics and implies that the Hydro-GAN model is performing
    well, resulting in highly accurate synthetic HSR polygons. Although the two metrics
    are different, as outlined in Table 1, one explanation for this correlation is
    that the numerators of both the areal metrics are the same (i.e., area of intersection
    of the two polygons), as demonstrated in Equations 7 and 8. Figure 10 Open in
    figure viewer PowerPoint Distribution of area similarity measured on the test
    set images by plotting histogram of Jaccard and Cosine similarity percentage between
    real and generated polygons in the test set images. 3.2.2 Shape and Distance Accuracy
    Result To measure the shape accuracy between the actual and the generated polygons
    from the test set, the polygons were converted into their respective shape signatures
    by calculating the Euclidean distance from the centroid to the coordinates of
    the points on the edges of the polygon and converting these distances into a time
    series. The result of which was used to plot a similarity graph as shown in Figure
    11a. As shown in the Figure 11a, the result indicates that when there is a dip
    in the shape signature of the ground truth polygon around 300 and 700 indices,
    there is a similar dip in the shape signature of the generated polygon as well.
    The same observation can also be made about the rise in the shape signature of
    the polygons being compared around indices 0, 400, and 1,000. It can also be seen
    that the shape signatures of the generated and the ground truth polygon are nearly
    overlapping. This indicates that our Hydro-GAN model is producing HSR images that
    are highly accurate in shape signature with respect to the reference Landsat images.
    Figure 11 Open in figure viewer PowerPoint Dynamic time warping measure applied
    by (a) aligning two polygons shape signatures (Ground truth in blue and generated
    in black) and (b) computing their warping distance by finding the optimal path
    along the warping matrix diagonal. Query Index refers to the index of the shape
    signature in the generated polygon, while Reference Index refers to the index
    of the shape signature in the ground truth (reference) polygon. To measure the
    distance accuracy, we used DTW to measure the extent of alignment between the
    actual and the generated polygon shape signatures. This process was repeated for
    all the images in the test set. To illustrate the result we chose a random LSR
    image from the test set to generate an HSR Landsat image. The generated image
    was then compared with the ground truth HSR image and the DTW was applied to their
    respective polygons. The result can be seen in Figure 11b which shows the DTW
    alignment and warping matrix that were produced when comparing the two polygons.
    The graph in Figure 11b shows that the warping path (denoted by the blue line
    from the lower-left to the top-right corner) between the generated and actual
    polygons is approximating a diagonal line (which is the ideal case). This implies
    that the HSR images produced from our Hydro-GAN model are highly accurate in the
    distance metric as well. We evaluate the distance metric of the entire test set
    by calculating the normalized alignment cost of the DTW matrix between all the
    generated and actual polygons. A normalized alignment cost of 1 is considered
    the ideal case. The result of this evaluation is reported in Figure 12, which
    shows that the distribution of the normalized alignment cost for the test set
    images ranges between 1.13 and 1.51, and the average alignment cost is 1.31 which
    are all close to the ideal value of 1. This indicates that our Hydro-GAN model
    is producing HSR images that have lower DTW distances when compared with the actual
    ground truth. Figure 12 Open in figure viewer PowerPoint The normalized alignment
    cost for dynamic time warping matrix in test set images. To better understand
    how the three areal and distance measures are correlated with each other, we present
    their correlation matrix which is shown in Figure 13. We note that the Jaccard
    and Cosine metrics have a strong positive correlation (0.96) which reveals that
    when there is an increase in the values of Jaccard similarity, the Cosine similarity
    also increases. This is due to the common numerator shared between Jaccard and
    Cosine. It can also be inferred from Figure 13 that the DTW alignment cost generates
    a moderate strength negative correlation with the Jaccard and Cosine similarities
    (around −0.50). This result indicates that in the cases when the Hydro-GAN model
    produces highly accurate areas, the exact shapes of the polygons are not highly
    accurate. Similarly, when Hydro-GAN produces highly underestimated (or overestimated)
    areas, the water body shape is relatively more accurate. The finding of this experiment
    is important for fine-tuning the model depending on the hydrology research needs.
    For example, if the purpose of generating HSR images is to study the sedimentation
    phenomena that require a precise polygon boundary, then Hydro-GAN can be tuned
    for optimizing and losses. In case the research needs to study the water volume
    change, then introducing a new areal loss Larea could be useful. Figure 13 Open
    in figure viewer PowerPoint Correlation matrix of Jaccard, Cosine and dynamic
    time warping similarity measures used for area, shape and distance accuracy evaluation,
    when measured between generated and original high spatial resolution test set
    images. In recent years, various state-of-the-art image-to-image translation models
    have been developed to address the challenges of transforming images from one
    domain to another while preserving their essential features (X. Li et al., 2021).
    Here, we briefly introduce three prominent models. SPA-GAN, or Spatial Attention
    GAN, is a model designed to enhance image-to-image translation by incorporating
    spatial attention mechanisms (Emami et al., 2020). It focuses on selectively attending
    to specific regions of the input image during the translation process, allowing
    for more precise and context-aware transformations. Cycle-GAN, on the other hand,
    is known for its ability to perform unpaired image translation. It introduces
    a cycle consistency loss to ensure that the translation from one domain to another
    and back results in the original input, enforcing a cycle-consistent mapping between
    domains without the need for paired data during training (Zhu et al., 2017). Pix2Pix
    is a conditional GAN that excels in paired image-to-image translation tasks (Isola
    et al., 2017). It learns a mapping from input to output images by training on
    aligned pairs, making it particularly effective for tasks where there is a clear
    correspondence between the input and output images. In our experimental comparison,
    we evaluated these models alongside your proposed Hydro-GAN using the Jaccard
    Index. The Jaccard Index measures the similarity between two sets by dividing
    the size of their intersection by the size of their union. As shown in Figure
    14, the results indicate that Hydro-GAN outperformed the other models with a Jaccard
    Index of 0.98, showcasing its effectiveness in image-to-image translation. This
    comparison provides a comprehensive assessment of Hydro-GAN''s performance relative
    to existing state-of-the-art models, contributing to a thorough validation of
    the proposed approach. Figure 14 Open in figure viewer PowerPoint Performance
    of the state-of-the-art models. 4 Case Study: Lake Tharthar''s In this case study,
    we evaluated our proposed Hydro-GAN model on Lake Tharthar''s shrinking and expansion
    behaviors. Lake Tharthar''s is a focal point for hydrological research and water
    resource management in Iraq (Kornijów et al., 2001). Covering an area of approximately
    2,100 square kilometers (810 square miles) at its maximum extent, it is one of
    the largest lakes in the country. Its seasonal dynamics, ecological significance,
    and role in sustaining water supply make it a critical area of study for hydrologists
    and environmental scientists aiming to address water-related challenges in the
    region. Our study area consists of Lake Tharthar''s polygon area across a period
    of 7 years, from 2015 to 2021. We compared the area of the lake water body from
    three different image sources. First, the original area of the water body was
    calculated from the original HSR Landsat images. Second, the area of the water
    body was extracted from the generated Landsat images (using our Hydro-GAN model).
    Third, the area of the water body was calculated using the LSR MODIS satellite
    images. The three polygon areas were compared with each other as plotted in Figure
    15. The blue bar plot in Figure 15 indicates that Lake Tharthar''s (one of the
    reservoirs from the data set) first shrinks in surface area from 2015 to 2020
    with a little increase in the year 2018, then shrinks again until 2020. The area
    of the water body again increases in the year 2021. The shrinking of the water
    body can be due to numerous hydrological as well as human factors, such as sedimentation
    as well as an increase in freshwater consumption (Mahajan & Martinez, 2021). Figure
    15 Open in figure viewer PowerPoint (a–g) Snapshot of Lake Tharthar''s water body
    for each year from 2015 to 2021, providing a visual record of changes over time.
    The bar plots compare area variation of Lake Tharthar''s between generated and
    actual polygons across 7 years from 2015 to 2021. The increase in the area of
    the water body in 2021 can be seen in Figure 15g where a small portion of the
    surface boundary has increased on the top left corner and bottom compared to 2020.
    It can also be noticed that the images produced by our Hydro-GAN model also follow
    the same pattern of change in the real ground-truth area of a water body across
    the 7 years (shown in the green bar plot). This result indicates that our Hydro-GAN
    model is predicting the shrinking or expansion of the surface area of a water
    body accurately. Another important observation that can be noted from Figure 15
    is that the area calculated from the LSR MODIS images (i.e., our competing baseline),
    shown in the red bar plot, fails to follow the same pattern of change in the water
    body accurately. We note that the LSR MODIS extracted area sometimes overestimates
    the actual area as reported in the years 2017, 2018, 2019, and 2020. Similarly,
    the LSR MODIS extracted area shows an under-estimation for the years 2015, 2016,
    and 2021. Our converted LSR to HSR extracted areas, shown in the blue bar plot
    of Figure 15, are more realistic area estimations that produce significantly lower
    errors than LSR MODIS. This result shows that our proposed LSR to HSR conversion
    using Hydro-GAN improved the prediction of the area of the Lake Tharthar''s water
    body. In addition, we note that our model produces generally a slight under-estimation
    of the area. Following our suggestion in Section 26, using an areal loss can correct
    the under-estimation. 5 Conclusion and Future Work In this paper, we propose Hydro-GAN
    a deep learning-based generative method that uses a cGAN for mapping the remote
    sensing information available at low resolution (MODIS satellite) to high resolution
    (Landsat satellite). In particular, we have used the case study of water bodies
    and reservoirs. Our proposed method uses a weighted DTW loss function along with
    the adversarial and L1 loss, to generate the HSR-LSR mapping. The results were
    evaluated using areal, shape, and distance similarity measures. The evaluation
    shows that our weighted Hydro-GAN model improved the accuracy of the generated
    water bodies polygons compared to state-of-the-art GAN models. Since the availability
    of accurate data on water bodies'' boundaries at high spatial and temporal resolution
    is important for assessing the role it plays in multiple hydrological research
    tasks, our work can provide complementary data sets for hydrological studies.
    Hydro-GAN can generate high-resolution data at historical time steps when such
    data is unavailable which can be used in areas where a large amount of historical
    data is required for forecasting purposes. As future work, we aim to further improve
    our mapping by making enhancements to our computer vision algorithm (which extracts
    the polygon boundary), so that it can extract the polygon even when the images
    obtained from the remote sensing satellites contain noise like clouds or other
    distortions. We also aim to extend the domain of our method beyond water bodies,
    like forests and vegetation. Finally, we plan to make our model generic, so that
    it can be used to map the images from any remote sensing satellite to another,
    which can include Sentinel and Hyperion satellites as well. Acknowledgments This

    Figures Versions Notes Abstract Evapotranspiration (ET) represents a significant
    component of the global water flux cycle, yet nocturnal evapotranspiration (ETn)
    is often neglected, leading to underestimation of global evapotranspiration. As
    for cropland, accurate modeling of ETn is essential for rational water management
    and is important for sustainable agriculture development. We used random forest
    (RF) to simulate ETn at 16 globally distributed cropland eddy covariance flux
    sites along with remote sensing and meteorological factors. The recursive feature
    elimination method was used to remove unimportant variables. We also simulated
    the ETn of C3 and C4 crops separately. The trained RF resulted in a determination
    coefficient (R2) (root mean square error (RMSE)) of 0.82 (7.30 W m−2) on the testing
    dataset. C3 and C4 crops on the testing dataset resulted in an R2 (RMSE) of 0.86
    (5.59 W m−2) and 0.55 (4.86 W m−2) for the two types of crops. We also showed
    that net radiation is the dominant factor in regulating ETn, followed by 2 m horizontal
    wind speed and vapor pressure deficit (VPD), and these three meteorological factors
    showed a significant positive correlation with ETn. This research demonstrates
    that RF can simulate ETn from crops economically and accurately, providing a methodological
    basis for improving global ETn simulations. Keywords: nocturnal evapotranspiration;

    1. Introduction Evapotranspiration (ET) is an indispensable part of the global
    hydrological cycle, which has an impact on regional soil and climate [1,2]. Agroecosystems
    play an essential part in terrestrial ecosystems, and it is estimated that about
    90% of the water resources consumed by agroecosystems are in the form of ET. High-accuracy
    modeling of ET is essential for determining irrigation demand, formulating irrigation
    strategies, and developing agricultural water management. However, in current
    estimates and simulations of terrestrial water loss, daytime evapotranspiration
    is considered to be dominant, while nocturnal evapotranspiration (ETn) is generally
    not addressed [3]. Particularly at the leaf level, the traditional consideration
    that leaf stomata close at night, combined with the low evaporative demand of
    plants at night, leads to the widespread belief that plant water vapor fluxes
    at night are negligible [4]. Nevertheless, the incomplete closing of the stomata
    combined with the subsequent prevalence of nocturnal transpiration at the leaf
    and crop scales is also increasingly evidenced [5,6]. Existing studies indicate
    that 6.3% to 9.1% of ET typically occurs at night in terrestrial ecosystems [2,7],
    and the proportion can be as high as 25% to 30% in dry ecosystems [8,9]. In cropland
    ecosystems, nighttime evapotranspiration of different crops also accounts for
    a portion of the evapotranspiration, e.g., tomatoes, beans, and cotton can evaporate
    between 3% and 23% at night [3,5,10]. In summary, ETn contributes to the quantification
    of evapotranspiration, and ignoring ETn will lead to an underestimation of total
    ecosystem evapotranspiration. For cropland, accurate simulation of ETn can help
    with developing more effective irrigation schemes for irrigated fields and provide
    a scientific basis for irrigation. Currently, studies on the factors influencing
    ETn and its mechanisms are not sufficiently advanced. The key drivers of nocturnal
    evapotranspiration may be somewhat different from daytime evapotranspiration [11],
    and there are differences in the ranking of the importance of environmental factors
    of evapotranspiration revealed by studies conducted in different study areas,
    making it difficult for existing methods to accurately model ETn. Zeppel et al.
    [12] overviewed the roles of various factors on nighttime plant water loss, which
    provided a theoretical reference for the later studies on the influencing factors
    of ETn. Meanwhile, the study proposed that the nocturnal water loss varies greatly
    between different plant types and functional groups. Tolk et al. [3] suggested
    that environmental variables such as wind speed (WS), temperature, humidity, and
    crop ETn have some correlation. Padrón et al. [2] performed a characterization
    of global nocturnal water loss and found that higher air temperature, VPD, WS,
    and soil moisture were more likely to lead to higher nocturnal water loss. Groh
    et al. [13] obtained a similar conclusion in the estimation of ETn from two different
    grassland ecosystems in Germany. Qiwen Liao et al. [14] found, in a study of ETn
    on the Tibetan Plateau, that ETn is mainly driven by temperature differences and
    WS at low-altitude regions. These studies have shown the complex influence of
    environmental factors on ETn from agricultural fields as well as other ecosystems,
    which are difficult to describe using a single physical definition. For the last
    few years, the rapid development of machine learning algorithms and neural network
    technologies and the trend of cross-fertilization of disciplines have also facilitated
    the introduction of these methodological models into other fields. Nowadays, machine
    learning models have been applied to the simulation of evapotranspiration in crops,
    plains, and watersheds [15,16,17,18,19], and the established models for estimating
    ET have achieved a more satisfactory accuracy. In 2019 Zhao et al. presented a
    machine learning model based on physical constraints to simulate ET on a global
    scale, and the model can also be applied to extreme weather conditions [20]. In
    2021, Yan Liu et al. [21,22] improved the accuracy of the Penman–Monteith equation
    using artificial neural networks (ANNs) as well as remote sensing vegetation indexes,
    and also achieved high accuracy in simulating ET from cropland using six machine
    learning algorithms. Meanwhile, Jang et al. [19] pointed out that ANNs can perform
    local optimization of potential evapotranspiration in the Korean Peninsula more
    accurately than the MODIS data model. Yue Jia et al. [23] concluded that the optimized
    extreme learning machine (ELM) model has higher simulation accuracy than traditional
    empirical models (e.g., the Priestley–Taylor model) in the estimation of ET of
    spring maize in China. In 2021, Zhang et al. [24] discovered that using RF algorithms
    in combination with MODIS and flux station data can generate relatively reliable
    ground-based ET datasets. Meanwhile, additional studies [25,26] also demonstrated
    that RF can simulate ET more efficiently than other machine learning models. In
    conclusion, artificial intelligence models have the advantages of high efficiency,
    accuracy, and generalization. Therefore, in the context that the driving mechanism
    of ETn is still unclear, machine learning methods are available for simulating
    the complicated non-linear relationship between influencing factors and ETn, and
    modeling ETn at the cropland scale. This study is dedicated to the development
    of a methodology that could accurately simulate ETn in cropland, contributing
    to agricultural water management and sustainable development, and could provide
    a theoretical basis for future ETn simulation studies on a global scale using
    machine models. Consequently, this study used machine learning algorithms to simulate
    ETn at 16 globally distributed cropland eddy covariance flux sites and analyzed
    the factors affecting ETn. The objectives of this study consist of the following
    two main points: (a) to establish a random forest (RF)-based model to simulate
    the ETn of cropland at the global scale hoping to provide a feasible solution
    for ETn simulation of cropland; (b) to analyze the degree of effect of different
    environmental drivers on ETn by using several feature assessment methods. 2. Materials
    and Methods 2.1. Materials 2.1.1. Eddy Covariance Flux Site Data The meteorological
    data used in this study were mainly derived from 16 cropland vortex-related sites
    (CRO, Croplands) in FLUXNET2015, with an interannual span of 2001–2014. In this
    study, latent heat flux data (LE_F_MDS) at hourly scales (both hourly and half-hourly
    scales) and atmospheric temperature (TA), wind speed (WS), precipitation (P),
    vapor pressure deficit (VPD), carbon dioxide (CO2), net radiation (Ra), relative
    humidity (RH), soil heat flux (G) data at the same time scales were used. For
    data preprocessing, data with incident shortwave radiation (SW_IN) values below
    5.0 W· m −2 were selected because the study was on nighttime evaporation. In the
    second step, FLUXNET2015 latent heat flux missing values were null-filled by the
    edge distribution sampling method (MDS), so the observed or high-quality null-filled
    data with an LE_F_MDS_QC field of 0 or 1 could be used as valid verification data
    for this experiment [27], and further outlier identification and rejection was
    conducted on the basis of the original data. In the third step, the response of
    plant evapotranspiration to precipitation had a lag, so the sum of precipitation
    for the first 8 days was taken for precipitation (P) [28]. In the fourth step,
    the energy closure factor (Ra) was calculated as (LE + H)/(Rn − G), where LE is
    the latent heat flux, H is the sensible heat flux, and G is the soil heat flux.
    Since several studies have shown the prevalence of energy non-closure at flux
    sites using the eddy correlation technique [29,30,31], for samples with Ra values
    outside the range of 0.85 to 1.15, we used the sum of LE, H, and G instead of
    Rn to retain more valid data. In the fifth step, in order to eliminate potential
    differences in tower height on wind speed measurements, we calculated the 2 m
    horizontal wind speed (WS2m) with the follow equation [32]: WS 2m = WS∗4.87 ln(67.8∗zw−5.42)
    (1) where WS is wind speed, zw is the tower height. In the sixth step, it has
    been mentioned that the opening and closing of plant stomata varies with the sun
    [33], so in this study, we calculate the hour angle at sunset (ωset) of the day
    from the local latitude and date, which is calculated as follows [34]: ω set =arccos(−tanφ
    tanδ) (2) δ=23.5 sin( DoY+284 365 2π)× π 180 (3) where φ is local latitude, DoY
    is the Julian day. In the seventh step, to eliminate the effect of extreme values
    on the experiment, we used data with LE fall within the 5th and 95th percentile
    of all LE samples. Ultimately, the data from the 16 flux sites employed in this
    study, which are distributed globally, are shown in Figure 1. For detailed information
    on these 16 cropland sites, refer to Table 1. Figure 1. Global distribution of
    the 16 cropland sites. Table 1. Detailed information of the 16 cropland sites.
    2.1.2. Remote Sensing Data Four MODIS data products were used in this study, including
    MOD13Q1, MYD13Q1, MOD21A1N, and MOD21A1D. MOD13Q1 and MYD13Q1 are the 250 m vegetation
    index products synthesized by Terra and Aqua satellites 16 d, respectively. We
    extract the normalized vegetation index (NDVI) and the enhanced vegetation index
    (EVI) from these two products to reflect surface vegetation information. MOD21A1N
    and MOD21A1D are 1 km and daily synthetic products, providing the nighttime and
    daytime surface temperature (LST), respectively. All MODIS data were retrieved
    from the Application for Extracting and Exploring Analysis Ready Samples tool
    on the NASA website (AρρEEARS (nasa.gov, accessed on 16 May 2022)). We took the
    16-day scale data, spliced them into an 8-day scale, and then used linear interpolation
    to populate the daily scale data into hourly scales, i.e., if the data at the
    two endpoints (t1, a), (t2, b), are known, the value (c) located at t in the interval
    [t1, t2] can be computed as: c=a+(t−t1) b−a t2−t1 (4) Finally, the experimental
    dataset was obtained by extracting the available data from the processed MODIS
    data through the time series of the flux dataset. Meanwhile, considering the physical
    properties of evapotranspiration, we also added the temperature difference between
    the atmosphere and the surface (∆TAS), which was obtained by subtracting LST from
    TA. The variables derived from these products are shown in Table 2. Table 2. The
    table of variables used in this study. 2.2. Methods Figure 2 shows the technical
    flowchart of this study. First, after obtaining the original data of 16 cropland
    sites around the world, we performed data preprocessing operations to obtain the
    data required for the experiment. In the second step, we used RF combined with
    the recursive feature elimination method (RFE) to construct the best machine learning
    model to simulate ETn, and then simulated ETn of C3, C4 crops. In the third step,
    we used the random forest method, and the Shapley additive explanation method
    to analyze the importance of factors affecting ETn. Figure 2. Flow chart of this
    study. TA is air temperature, VPD is vapor pressure deficit, P is precipitation,
    WS is wind speed, WS2m is 2 m horizontal wind speed, CO2 is carbon dioxide, RH
    is relative humidity, Rn is net radiation, G is soil heat flux, NDVI is normalized
    difference vegetation index, EVI is enhanced vegetation index, LST is land surface
    temperature, LST_Differ is diurnal temperature difference at the land surface,
    and ∆TAS is the temperature difference between the atmosphere and the surface.
    RF is random forest, RFE is recursive feature elimination, SHAP is the Shapley
    additive explanation method and ETn is the nocturnal evapotranspiration. Rectangles
    are data, rounded rectangles are processes, and ellipses are models or methods.
    2.2.1. Random Forest Random forest (RF), proposed by Breiman [48] in 2001, is
    an integrated decision tree based algorithm. When RF is used as a regression,
    the basic theory is to generate multiple decision trees by randomly selecting
    samples with put-back, and then average the decision results of multiple trees
    as the final output to make the decision tree generalization error converge to
    obtain better prediction results. One of the important features of RF is the random
    extraction of feature variables to avoid a strong correlation between feature
    variables and results. Therefore, RF has the advantage of being able to evaluate
    the importance of features and handle high-dimensional feature data. The dataset
    used in this study was randomly divided into 60% training sets, 20% validation
    sets, and 20% test sets based on years. For example, if a site had 10 years of
    data, then six years of data were randomly selected as the training set, two years
    as the validation set, and the remaining two years as the test set. And if a site
    had only one year of valid data, the data from that site were used as the training
    set. This division method avoids both the poor model generalization performance
    due to completely random division and the time dependence arising from sequential
    division. Finally, 131,670 datasets and 62,743 datasets were used for the training
    set and validation set, respectively and 46,923 datasets were used for testing.
    The division of the training and test sets is shown in Table 3. Table 3. Segmentation
    results for the training dataset and the test dataset *. RF has two important
    parameters: the maximum depth of the trees (max_depth) and the number of decision
    trees (n_estimators). We set the max_depth parameter in the range of 1 to 25 and
    n_estimators in the interval of [100, 800] and tuned the parameters using the
    random search combined with the grid search method. After tuning, we found that
    n_estimators = 356 and max_depth = 10 was the RF model structure. To mitigate
    the risk of potential overfitting, we visualized the variation in model accuracy
    with parameters, as depicted in Figure 3. Figure 3a delineates the variation in
    R2 concerning the max_depth parameter for both the training and validation sets,
    with n_estimators fixed at 356. As max_depth increases, the R2 of both sets experiences
    a moderate increment; however, the R2 of the validation set ceases to ascend when
    max_depth reaches 11. Notably, the discrepancy between the training and validation
    set R2 is minimized when max_depth equals 9, thus identifying 9 as the optimal
    max_depth parameter. Figure 3b illustrates the R2 graph of the training and validation
    sets concerning n_estimators with max_depth set to 9. While the overall trend
    appears relatively stable, the R2 of the validation set peaks when n_estimators
    = 350, with the smallest difference observed between the R2 values of the training
    and validation sets. Consequently, following parameter tuning, we designate the
    configuration with n_estimators = 356 and max_depth = 9 as the optimal structure
    for the random forest model. Figure 3. Variation in training and validation set
    R2 values with parameters. (a) max_depth ranges from 0 to 25; (b) n_estimator
    ranges from 50 to 800. 2.2.2. Recursive Feature Elimination In machine learning,
    when dealing with high-dimensional datasets, the problem of dimensionality catastrophe
    may be encountered, which reduces the generalization ability of the model and
    leads to overfitting problems [49]. Recursive feature elimination (RFE) is a commonly
    used method and tool in feature engineering, and has important applications in
    remote sensing, bioinformatics, power analysis, etc. [50,51,52,53]. The principle
    of the RFE algorithm is to repeatedly construct the model and train it, select
    the feature with the smallest or largest weight after each round of training,
    eliminate this feature, and then repeat the process until all the features are
    traversed, and ultimately arrive at the best feature subset [49]. Using the RFE
    method may result in reduced model accuracy, in order to avoid overfitting, yet
    the cost is relatively small and the performance degradation is insignificant.
    We used three different combinations of variables to explore the impact of different
    input variables on model accuracy: the first with hour angle at sunset and meteorological
    data; the second with hour angle at sunset, meteorological data, and vegetation
    index data; the third with a combination of input variables obtained by recursive
    feature elimination. Table 4 shows the different combinations of inputs. Table
    4. The different input combinations of the RF algorithm *. 2.2.3. Correlation
    Coefficient Method The Pearson correlation coefficient method uses the Pearson
    correlation coefficient (R) as the evaluation criterion, which can be used to
    show the degree of correlation between the dependent variable and the independent
    variable. The value is between [−1, 1], with the absolute value closer to 1 indicating
    a higher correlation, and the absolute value closer to 0 indicating a lower correlation
    [54]. In this study, we analyzed multiple environmental drivers of ETn using the
    Pearson correlation coefficient method. 2.2.4. Shapley Additive Explanation Method
    The Shapley additive explanations (SHAP) method, which measures the contribution
    of features to the final output by the Shapley value of each feature, is an additive
    attribution algorithm based on game theory that can be used to interpret machine
    learning models [55]. Its positive and negative direction, as well as the magnitude
    of its absolute value, represent the positive and negative effect of the feature
    on the simulated values as well as the magnitude of its contribution. In other
    words, when the SHAP plot shows a higher |SHAP| mean, it indicates that the feature
    has the greatest impact on the target simulated values. The contribution of each
    feature can be quantified and visualized intuitively using the SHAP method. 2.3.
    Model Evaluation Three model performance assessment metrics were employed in this
    study: coefficient of determination (R2), root mean square error (RMSE), and mean
    absolute error (MAE). The three evaluation indicators are calculated as: R 2 =
    ∑ n i=1 [( y i − y      i )( x i − x     i )] 2 ∑ n i−1 ( y i − y  
       i ) 2 ∑ n i−1 ( x i − x     i ) 2 (5) RMSE= 1 n ∑ i=1 n ( y i −x i )
    2 − − − − − − − − − − − − −  ⎷   (6) MAE= 1 n ∑ i=1 n | y i − x i | (7) where
    n is the sample size, x i is the observed value, x     i is the mean of the
    observations, y i is the simulated value, and y      i is the mean of the
    simulated values. R2 assesses the degree of conformity between simulated and actual
    values in the regression model. An R2 value that is closer to 1 represents higher
    simulation accuracy. RMSE and MAE are used to capture the error between the model
    prediction data and the raw data. The smaller these two metrics are, the more
    accurate the model simulation is [56]. 3. Results 3.1. Comparison of RF Model
    with Different Input Variables ETn was modeled and simulated for 16 stations of
    cropland type using the random forest algorithm, with input variables consisting
    of three combinations of meteorological data and vegetation index data. As shown
    in Figure 4, using various combinations of input variables resulted in different
    accuracies of the model. Using only meteorological factors as model input variables
    yielded relatively low simulation accuracies. The R2 value was 0.8 for both the
    training and validation sets, while the RMSE (MAE) for the two datasets were 6.73
    W m−2 (4.32 W m−2) and 8.98 W m−2 (5.29 W m−2), respectively. For the test set,
    the R2 was 0.78, the RMSE was 7.79 W m−2, and the MAE was 4.66 W m−2. In contrast,
    by adding the vegetation index as a combination of model input variables, the
    model simulation was significantly improved, with the R2 of the training set raised
    to 0.82, and the R2 of the validation set also raised to 0.83. The R2 of the test
    set was raised from 0.78 to 0.82, the RMSE was 7.36 W m−2, and the MAE was 4.39
    W m−2. All three evaluation metrics exhibited a certain enhancement. Figure 4.

    (a). (a1–a3) and using input variables combination (b). (b1–b3). The solid gray
    line is the fitted line, and the black dashed line is the 1:1 line. It is evident
    that RF can capture the complicated non-linear relationship from environmental
    factors to ETn very well and can achieve high simulation accuracy. In conclusion,
    RF can be selected as an effective model for further analysis of ETn in cropland.
    We further used the RFE method to filter the variables to obtain the input combination
    c to model the ETn, the variables selected were ωset, TA, VPD, P, WS, WS2m, RH,
    LST, Rn, G, EVI, and NDVI. Figure 5 shows the simulation effect of this combination
    of variable inputs. The overall impact of the model exhibits minor variations
    when compared to combination b. Although R2 remains unchanged, there is a noticeable
    reduction in errors: the RMSE for the validation set decreases from 8.34 W m−2
    to 8.29 W m−2, and the MAE decreases from 4.99 W m−2 to 4.96 W m−2. Furthermore,
    there is a reduction of 0.06 W m−2 in RMSE and 0.03 W m−2 in MAE for the test
    set. It is evident that this feature selection method proves effective, and the
    chosen feature combination contributes to enhancing the accuracy of the model
    simulation. Detailed information on the simulation results for these three combinations
    of input variables can be found in Appendix A (Table A1). Figure 5. Performance
    of the RF model when simulating ETn using variables obtained by the RFE method.
    3.2. Simulation of C3 and C4 Crops by the RF Model C3 and C4 crops in the water–carbon
    coupling process have different physiological characteristics [57]. To further
    deepen the study of ETn from cropland, we modeled C3 and C4 crops individually
    and also validated them on a daily scale. The model input variables were obtained
    by recursive feature elimination and included ωset, TA, VPD, P, WS, WS2m, RH,
    LST, Rn, G, EVI, and NDVI. Parameter optimization was carried out on the RF model
    to obtain the optimum model parameters for the C3 crop (n_estimators = 369 and
    max_depth = 7) and for the C4 crop (n_estimators = 285 and max_depth = 7). The
    model simulation results are shown in Figure 6. The maximum simulated ETn value
    for C3 crops has a maximum value of 120 W m−2, while the maximum value for C4
    crops is 40 W m−2. It was clear that the ETn values of C3 plants were generally
    greater than those of C4 crops, which was related to the species type of C3 crops.
    In addition to typical crops such as soybean and wheat, C3 crops also include
    crops such as rice. Some C3 sites contained rice paddies within them, and the
    ETn of the paddies was greater than that of the drylands. Figure 6. Performance
    of the RF model when simulating ETn on C3 and C4 crops. The ETn simulation for
    the C3 crop had a value of 0.86 for R2 on the test set, and values of 5.59 and
    3.59 for RMSE and MAE, respectively. The simulation results for C4 crop showed
    R2, RMSE, and MAE metrics of 0.55, 4.86 W m−2, and 3.2 W m−2, respectively. It
    can be seen that although RF can effectively simulate the ETn of C3 and C4, there
    were some differences in their simulation effects. We discuss possible reasons
    for this in Section 4.1. 3.3. Characteristics Analysis 3.3.1. Random Forest Characterization
    To further analyze the factors affecting ETn, we analyzed the degree of influence
    of features using two methods. Features included ωset, TA, VPD, P, WS, WS2m, CO2,
    RH, LST, LST_Differ, ∆T_AS, Rn, G, EVI, and NDVI. The importance of the influence
    of each factor on ETn was analyzed using the random forest algorithm instead of
    the traditional mathematical and statistical methods. The results are shown in
    Figure 7 and Table 5, where the relative importance is the algorithm’s self-generated
    importance score for the corresponding factor, while the ranking is the ranking
    obtained from the associated importance score. The findings reveal that, in the
    simulation of ETn across the 16 sites, Rn and WS2m emerge with notably high importance,
    securing relative importance scores of 0.26 and 0.12, respectively, occupying
    the first and second positions. VPD and WS claim the third and fourth positions,
    while NDVI holds the fifth position. Notably, temperature difference between the
    surface and the atmosphere is ranked in the last position. The importance scores
    of the other variables are very close to each other and lie in the middle part.
    Figure 7. Characteristics analysis conducted using the random forest and SHAP
    methods. (a) Relative importance of ETn with each environmental factor obtained
    by the random forest algorithm; (b) the value of mean (|SHAP value|) of each environmental
    factor obtained by the SHAP algorithm. Table 5. Feature correlations and composite
    rankings obtained by random forest and the SHAP method. 3.3.2. The SHAP for Characterization
    We also analyzed the influences using the SHAP method, reflecting the magnitude
    of the contribution of each influence on the simulation results through the value
    of mean (|SHAP value|), and visualized the results in the form of bar charts (Figure
    7). Although there are some differences with the results of the characterization
    of the random forest, the overall results are somewhat similar. WS2m and Rn show
    higher values, with values of 1.92 and 1.8 for WS2m and Rn, respectively. NDVI,
    WS, and VPD have similar performances, while at the same time ∆TAS is similarly
    in last place. Interestingly, WS2m, which is also a correlate of wind speed, manifests
    a greater significance than WS. The reasons for this disparity will be explored
    in Section 4.5. Since different methods presented some differences in the analysis
    of ETn influencing factors, we combined the three methods calculated the mean
    values, and ranked the ranking of the obtained influencing factors (Table 5).
    Overall, Rn, WS2m, and VPD are the most important influencing factors. However,
    the G, LST_Differ, and ∆TAS showed a low ranking in both experiments. Vegetation
    index data (EVI and NDVI) showed moderate but more important rankings. 4. Discussion
    4.1. Possible Reasons for Differences in RF Modeling of C3, C4 Crops Although
    the RF simulations for both C3 crops and C4 crops presented the desired accuracy,
    there were some differences in the simulation results between the two. This was
    primarily due to differences in the volume of data and the number of sites. Of
    the 16 flux sites, 14 flux sites belonged to the C3 crop with a total of 216,497
    datasets, while 9 sites belonged to the C4 crop with a total of 162,405 datasets.
    The difference in the amount of data makes it difficult to ensure high simulation
    accuracy and generalization ability. Due to the structural differences between
    C3 and C4 crops, their responses to different environmental factors (CO2, radiation,
    temperature, precipitation, etc.) may differ to some extent [58,59,60]. Therefore,
    from the perspective of model building, in the futuristic simulation of ETn in
    cropland, corresponding parameterization schemes should be established for different
    crop types to effectively reduce the uncertainty of simulation results. 4.2. Differences
    in Simulation Effectiveness of Random Forest Models between Sites We validated
    11 sites on the test set on the daily scale, and the results are shown in Table
    6. It can be seen that there are significant differences in the model simulation
    performance between different eddy covariance sites, with DE-Geb, DE-Kil, and
    FI-Jok having the relatively lowest R2 values of around 0.06, followed by BE-Lon
    and US-CRT with an R2 of around 0.3. US-Twt has the largest R2 (R2 = 0.82) and
    the worst RMSE and MAE performance (RMSE = 11.19 W m−2, MAE = 8.12 W m−2). The
    other four sites had similar accuracies, with similar R2 (0.6 ± 0.04) and RMSE
    values (4.0 ± 0.3). Table 6. Model simulation effects on the test set across different
    sites. We conducted an in-depth analysis of the input data to elucidate the factors
    contributing to the observed disparities, and the data distribution is shown in
    Figure 8. Notably, with the exception of a few outliers, each site in the test
    set exhibits a substantial variation in both data distribution and volume. The
    LE data of the sites with the lowest R2 are in a very narrow interval, basically
    distributed around 0 W m−2, and thus have a low RMSE. While the sites with higher
    R2 can reach a maximum value of around 40 W m−2 and have a larger amount of data.
    Noteworthy is the observation that, among these sites, US-CRT has the least amount
    of data, consequently presenting a lower R2. For the US-Twt site, the data have
    a wider distribution ([−0.6, 116] in the 95% confidence interval) and overall
    large values ([12, 56] in the quadratic range). Figure 8. Violin plots of the
    data distribution for each site in the test set. The grey boxes represent the
    interquartile range, the black lines represent the range of values with 95% confidence
    intervals, and the white dots represent the median, with the wider portion indicating
    that there are relatively more data points for that value. 4.3. Impact of Different
    Spatial Resolution Data on the Model To explore the impact of diverse spatial
    resolutions on the model’s performance, we utilized NDVI and EVI data at a 500
    m spatial scale sourced from MODIS’s MOD13A1 and MYD13A1 products, which provide
    vegetation index data at the five hundred meter scale. We used the same training,
    validation, and test sets, with input variables being combinations of variables
    obtained by recursive feature elimination and substituted the original 250 m scale
    EVI and NDVI data with their counterparts at a 500 m scale. Modeling simulations
    were conducted using the RF model, and the simulation result are shown in Figure
    9. Figure 9. Performance of the RF model when simulating ETn on a 500 m spatial
    resolution data product. The analysis reveals a reduction in the R2 value of the
    validation set, declining from 0.83 to 0.74, and an enhancement in the RMSE (MAE)
    metrics, changing from 8.29 W m−2 (4.96 W m−2) to 9.67 W m−2 (5.47 W m−2). The
    test set also exhibits some degradation in accuracy, with R2 decreasing from 0.82
    to 0.77, while RMSE and MAE also improving somewhat. These findings indicate a
    substantial decline in simulation accuracy when employing the 500 m data product.
    Higher spatial resolution MODIS data products have lower error with ground truth
    observations, as well as higher accuracy in reflecting localized vegetation change
    [61,62], and are more conducive to matching with site-scale flux data. Consequently,
    the model achieved a relatively optimal simulation accuracy using 250 m resolution
    vegetation index data. 4.4. Differences in ETn Simulation by Different Machine
    Learning Algorithms To explore whether there are significant differences in the
    simulation of ETn in farmland by different machine models, we used three different
    types of machine learning algorithm models to conduct comparative experiments.
    XGBoost [63] is a type of algorithm belonging to the gradient boosting algorithm,
    which improves the performance by integrating multiple decision trees. KNN [64]
    is a basic supervised learning algorithm, which is based on the neighborhood’s
    voting mechanism through the measure of the distance between the instances for
    regression prediction. ANN [65] is a multilayer neural network based on which
    modelling of nonlinear relationships, achieved through connections between neurons.
    To ensure the consistency of the experiments, we used the same training, validation,
    and test sets as RF, and the input variables were derived from the combinations
    obtained through the RF recursive feature elimination method (combination c.).
    Figure 10 presents the simulation results of four distinct machine learning models.
    Notably, there are minor variations in the accuracy of these models, with ANN
    and RF achieving more similar simulation accuracies: ANN has an R2 of 0.82, an
    RMSE of 6.71, and an MAE of 4.15. XGBoost attains an R2 of 0.8, and its RMSE and
    MAE closely align with those of RF, with values of 7.01 and 4.35, respectively.
    In contrast, KNN exhibits lower model simulation accuracy, with an R2 of 0.79.
    The RMSE (MAE) for KNN is 7.49 (4.39). It is apparent that there are slight simulation
    accuracy differences among various machine learning models for farmland ETn. Nevertheless,
    these differences fall within acceptable limits and do not significantly impact
    the overall results. We applied the recursive feature selection method to perform
    feature selection on three machine learning models separately, and the results
    revealed no significant improvement in model accuracy (Table A2, Appendix B).
    Therefore, the differences in model performance may arise from both structural
    disparities in the machine learning models themselves, along with the fine-tuning
    of hyperparameters. The performance of the three models on the training and validation
    datasets can be found in Figure A1, Appendix B. Figure 10. Performance of RF,
    XGBoost, KNN, and ANN in simulating ETn on the test set. 4.5. Differences in Random
    Forest Feature Importance Assessment and SHAP Interpretation Random forest feature
    importance assessment is achieved by calculating the impact of features when the
    decision tree splits nodes. This approach provides a relative ranking of features,
    showing which features are more important for overall model performance. However,
    it may ignore the interactions between features and some bias may exist in the
    case of highly correlated features [66]. In contrast, the SHAP method employs
    Shapley values based on game theory, calculates the specific contribution of each
    feature for each sample, and takes into account the interactions between features
    [67]. However, its computational resource requirements are higher, especially
    when dealing with a high-dimensional feature space. Taken together, the introduction
    of SHAP can enhance the interpretability of the model. Combining the feature importance
    from random forest, we can obtain a more comprehensive decision reference for
    feature analysis. 4.6. Response of ETn to Rn, WS2m, and VPD Through characteristics
    analysis, we found that Rn, WS2m, and VPD were the most important factors affecting
    ETn. Here, we analyzed the relationship between the three meteorological factors
    and ETn on a daily scale by grouping the test set data in terms of station and
    data. The results are shown in Figure 11. Figure 11. Scatter plot of the ETn modeled
    by RF with Rn, WS2m, and VPD on the test dataset. The orange lines show the fitted
    linear regressions. Rn is the main source of energy exchanged turbulently between
    crops and soil [68], reflecting the energy difference between the absorption of
    solar radiation by the surface and the emission of radiation to the atmosphere
    and space. As a central element of the surface energy balance, Rn has a direct
    impact on the temperature distribution and energy allocation at the surface. In
    both soil and plant evapotranspiration, the distribution of water and heat in
    the system is affected by the energy provided by radiation, which in turn affects
    ET changes [69]. Simultaneously, Guo et al. [70] found that on a seasonal scale,
    nighttime water loss in maize is mainly influenced by site bulk surface conductance
    and Rn. Nonetheless, Rn has often been neglected in established studies on the
    analysis of ETn’s influencing factors. We visualized the correlation between ETn
    and Rn and found that there was a sufficient positive correlation between ETn
    and Rn, and it increased with the increase of Rn (R = 0.396, p-value < 0.01).
    Both previous studies and the experimental results of this experiment showed that
    there was a close correlation between wind speed and evapotranspiration [12],
    so a discussion of the relationship between WS and ETn was necessary. Wind velocity
    is a means to promote soil moisture evaporation and plant evapotranspiration through
    air movement. Therefore, theoretically, the higher WS, the greater ET [71]. In
    general, surface wind speeds tend to be slower and exhibit an ascending trend
    with increasing height [32]. In other words, variations exist in the wind speeds
    recorded by flux stations at different elevations. Therefore, the consideration
    of 2 m standard wind speeds, in contrast to the raw wind speed (WS), accounts
    for the influence of tower height and underscores a significant level of importance
    and relevance. Our analysis of ETn and WS in cropland revealed, in general agreement
    with previous studies, that there was a certain degree of increase in ETn as WS
    increased. Previous studies have shown that VPD is the major factor driving nighttime
    water loss in plants [72]. Damian Cirelli et al.’s study of nocturnal stomatal
    conductivity in poplar trees showed a significant negative correlation between
    nocturnal stomatal conductivity and VPD [73], as did similar findings from other
    studies [8,74]. However, Siddiq and colleagues’ study of forests showed that if
    climate change causes an increase in nocturnal VPD, forests will consume more
    water through ETn [75]. Our study found that VPD showed a week positive correlation
    with ETn (R = 0.277) and passed the significance test (p-value < 0.01). However,
    at VPD to about 10 hpa, ETn did not show a significant elevation with increasing
    VPD, and similar VPD threshold effects were observed in other studies [76,77,78].
    The sites in the test set are categorized into four climate types according to
    the Köppen–Geiger climate classification. Specifically, BE-Lon, DE-Geb, DE-Kli,
    FR-Gri, and US-ARM fall under the temperate oceanic climate (Cfb). US-Twt is characterized
    by a Mediterranean hot-summer climate (Csa), while US-CRT, US-Ne1, US-Ne2, and
    US-Ne3 exhibit a hot-summer humid continental climate (Dfa). FI-Jok is a warm-summer
    humid continental climate (Dfb). We visualized the response of ETn to the three
    meteorological factors under each of the four climate types (Figure 12). Figure
    12. Scatter plot of the ETn modeled by RF with Rn, WS2m, and VPD under different
    climatic conditions on the test dataset. (a1–a4) is the relationship of net radiation
    to ETn; (b1–b4) is the relationship of WS2m to ETn; and (c1–c4) is the relationship
    of VPD to ETn. Cfb is a temperate oceanic climate; Csa is a Mediterranean hot-summer
    climate; Dfa is a hot-summer humid continental climate; Dfb is a warm-summer humid
    continental climate. For net radiation, there is also a trend of positive correlation
    on individual climate types, Csa and Dfb climates in particular show more significant
    positive correlations. Conversely, the Dfa climate displays a weak negative correlation,
    albeit not a statistically significant one. This may be due to the fact that temperate
    continental humid climate receives less solar radiation at the surface in winter,
    and the Rn is usually negative, resulting in lower surface temperatures, which
    reduces the amount of water available for evapotranspiration by condensation of
    water in the soil, while Dfa tends to be drier [79], and the rate of ET of water
    is slower, so that it may show a certain inhibition. Notably, Sullivan et.al [80]
    suggest that, compared to energy limitations (Rn), North American evapotranspiration
    is more sensitive to temperature and VPD. The effect of WS on ETn shows a significant
    positive correlation in the Cfb, Csa, and Dfa climate types. However, in the Dfb
    climate type, the result shows a relatively weak correlation and the relationship
    is not statistically significant due to other potential factors such as small
    sample size or wind speed itself having a weak effect on ETn. VPD, on the other
    hand, showed an overall positive correlation, and a more significant positive
    correlation under the Csa and Dfa climates, while the Cfb climate, which is characterized
    by four wet and mild seasons, makes VPD have less influence on evapotranspiration.
    In summary, despite the differences in the main influencing factors under different
    climate types, which are mainly related to the differences in each climate type,
    in general Rn, WS, and VPD show a close correlation with ETn. 4.7. Impact of Data
    on Model Simulation Accuracy The data employed for this research mainly include
    eddy covariance flux site data and MODIS data, although the original data were
    screened and quality controlled during the experimental process, the final experimental
    data still have some impact on the model simulation effect. First, significant
    results are currently available for estimating global evapotranspiration using
    the vorticity covariance method; however, the effects of weak turbulence at night
    have resulted in nighttime measurements at FLUXNET sites being generally unreliable,
    with up to more than 50% of flux site data lacking [81]. However, nocturnal turbulent
    motions are limited in computational simulations by buoyancy stratification, and
    to accurately simulate such turbulence, models with high mesh resolution need
    to be used, which imposes a demand for huge computational resources, an inherent
    limitation of the data [82]. And accurate measurement of EC latent heat fluxes
    at flux sites may be more difficult due to reduced ground–atmosphere coupling
    [2]. Although flux sites located in cropland are less economical to maintain than
    flux sites in other vegetation types, the sensors themselves are subject to a
    certain amount of error, which can lead to common problems such as extreme noise
    in the data and have an impact on the accuracy of model simulations. Secondly,
    the data we employed in this study were stitched from two types of data (flux
    site data and remote sensing data). Differences in surface resolution may generate
    some errors in the stitching. Moreover, the extent and direction of the data available
    from the flux site for the area represented varies greatly over time from site
    to site [83,84]. This could lead to errors in the measurement of climate conditions,
    vegetation indexes, etc., at the site when using FLUXNET data and MODIS data,
    which do not match each other better. It has been noted that finer species mapping
    is needed to explore data matching quantitatively [85], and this needs to be followed
    up with more in-depth studies. 4.8. Future Research Directions How to develop
    a more generalized model to effectively simulate ETn is the main direction of
    our future research. We consider here two main aspects to optimize the model.
    On the one hand, we will augment the experimental sample by obtaining more valid
    crop field observations. Given the inherent limitations of data products in terms
    of temporal and spatial resolution, exploring data fusion methods and using multi-source
    remote sensing data could contribute to improving the spatiotemporal coverage
    of ETn [86,87,88,89]. On the other hand, hybrid models based on a biophysical
    framework can be developed. Although pure machine learning models can fully utilize
    the data, they lack certain physical constraints and interpretability. It has
    been shown that the simulation accuracy can be improved by constructing a hybrid
    model by combining a biophysical framework with a machine learning model [20].
    Especially in the case of limited samples, compared with the traditional pure
    machine learning method, simulating the intermediate parameters in the biophysical
    process through the machine learning model can effectively reduce the model complexity
    and thus improve the generalization and stability of the model [90]. 5. Conclusions
    Accurate simulation of nocturnal evapotranspiration from croplands is significant
    for agricultural water-saving irrigation and food security. In this study, the
    ETn of 16 cropland flux sites was simulated using random forest combined with
    a recursive feature elimination algorithm, and the dominant drivers of ETn were
    analyzed using multiple feature analysis approaches. After analyzing and discussing
    the results, we can draw the following conclusions: RF proves to be an effective
    tool for simulating ETn in cropland using a combination of hour angle at sunset,
    meteorological, and vegetation index data as inputs (R2 = 0.82, RMSE = 7.36 W
    m−2, and MAE = 4.39 W m−2 for testing dataset); The selected features (ωset, TA,
    VPD, P, WS, WS2m, RH, LST, Rn, G, EVI, and NDVI) through recursive feature elimination
    (RFE) contribute to improve model simulations (R2 = 0.82, RMSE = 7.30 W m−2, and
    MAE = 4.36 W m−2 for testing dataset); Although the accuracy of RF simulation
    for C3 and C4 crops had some differences, the overall simulation accuracy remained
    within an acceptable range; Among the various drivers of ETn, Rn emerged as the
    primary influencing factor, followed by WS2m, and VPD; the relationship between
    Rn, WS2m, VPD and ETn showed a positive correlation and they all passed the significance
    test (p-value < 0.01). Overall, the methodology proposed in this study performed
    well in accurately modeling cropland ETn and provided for an in-depth analysis
    of the relevant impact factors. In the future, we will strive to accurately simulate
    ETn on a global scale by using more advanced data products and adopting more effective
    modeling methods. Author Contributions Conceptualization, Y.B. and J.H.; methodology,

  description: Water clarity serves as both an indicator and a regulator of biological
    function in aquatic systems. Large-scale, consistent water clarity monitoring
    is needed for informed decision-making. Inland freshwater ponds and lakes across
    Cape Cod, a 100-km peninsula in Massachusetts, are of particular interest for
    water clarity monitoring. Secchi disk depth (SDD), a common measure of water clarity,
    has been measured intermittently for over 200 Cape Cod ponds since 2001. Field-measured
    SDD data were used to estimate SDD from satellite data, leveraging the NASA/USGS
    Landsat Program and Copernicus Sentinel-2 mission, spanning 1984 to 2022. Random
    forest machine learning models were generated to estimate SDD from satellite reflectance
    data and maximum pond depth. Spearman rank correlations (rs) were “strong” for
    Landsat 5 and 7 (rs = 0.78 and 0.79), and “very strong” for Landsat 8, 9, and
    Sentinel-2 (rs = 0.83, 0.86, and 0.80). Mean absolute error also indicated strong
    predictive capacity, ranging from 0.65 to 1.05 m, while average bias ranged from
    −0.20 to 0.06 m. Long- and recent short-term changes in satellite-estimated SDD
    were assessed for 193 ponds, selected based on surface area and the availability
    of maximum pond depth data. Long-term changes between 1984 and 2022 established
    a retrospective baseline using the Mann-Kendall test for trend and Theil-Sen slope.
    Generally, long-term water clarity improved across the Cape; 149 ponds indicated
    increasing water clarity, and 8 indicated deteriorating water clarity. Recent
    short-term changes between 2021 and 2022 identified ponds that may benefit from
    targeted management efforts using the Mann-Whitney U test. Between 2021 and 2022,
    96 ponds indicated deteriorations in water clarity, and no ponds improved in water
    clarity. While the 193 ponds analyzed here constitute only one quarter of Cape
    Cod ponds, they represent 85% of its freshwater surface area, providing the most
    spatially and temporally comprehensive assessment of Cape Cod ponds to date. Efforts
    are focused on Cape Cod, but can be applied to other areas given the availability
    of local field data. This study defines a framework for monitoring and assessing
    change in satellite-estimated SDD, which is important for both local and regional
    management and resource prioritization.

    clarityLandsatSentinel-2 1. Introduction Water clarity serves as both an indicator
    and a regulator of biological and ecological function in aquatic systems. As an
    indicator, water clarity is highly related to trophic state, nutrient concentration,
    and algal biomass (Carlson, 1977; Wagner et al., 2017). As a regulator, water
    clarity impacts the health of aquatic vegetation (Orth et al., 2010) and fish
    populations (Lester et al., 2004). Water clarity also has important economic implications,
    as poor water clarity can reduce property values (Clapper and Caudill, 2014) and
    affect tourism (Keeler et al., 2012). Secchi disk depth (SDD) is a widely used
    measure of water clarity (Boyce et al., 2012). A Secchi disk is a black and white
    disk 30 cm in diameter that is lowered into the water column; the depth at which
    the disk is no longer visible to the observer is recorded as the SDD (Cialdi,
    1866). Changes in water clarity are of particular interest across Cape Cod, a
    100-km peninsula located off the coast of Massachusetts in the northeast United
    States. Cape Cod depends on reliable water quality to support its seasonal, tourism-based
    economy (Perry et al., 2020), and is highly susceptible to water quality stressors
    (CCC, 2021). There are 883 lakes and ponds across Cape Cod—defined as fresh, static,
    and permanent inland waterbodies larger than 10,000 ft2 (or approximately 929
    m2)—hereafter collectively referred to as ponds (CCC, 2021). Ponds across the
    Cape provide habitat, contribute to estuarine and marine systems, offer recreational
    opportunities, and support 230,000 year-round residents and nearly 500,000 seasonal
    visitors each year (CCC, 2019, CCC, 2021; U.S. Census Bureau, 2019). Cape Cod''s
    ponds are also used to infer the condition of the region''s aquifer (CCC, 2021;
    Oldale, 1976); the Cape''s drinking water is entirely dependent on groundwater
    from the Cape Cod Aquifer, but groundwater sampling across Cape Cod is limited
    as no programs exist to regularly monitor the quality of groundwater on a regional
    basis. Since most ponds across the Cape are directly connected to the groundwater,
    water quality measured across ponds and across time is used to provide insight
    regarding the general condition of the Aquifer. Across Cape Cod, multiple policies
    are in place to manage inland water quality, including several sections of the
    Clean Water Act. Sections 205(j) and 303(e) require states to establish methods
    for compiling and analyzing water quality data. Section 303(d) requires states
    to evaluate all available water quality-related data to develop an Integrated
    Waters List, which identifies waters that do not meet established water quality
    standards. In 2015, the United States Environmental Protection Agency approved
    the Cape Cod Commission''s updated Section 208 Plan, the Area Wide Water Quality
    Management Plan, which is a watershed-based approach to restore embayment water
    quality on Cape Cod. The plan recommends strategies, regulatory reforms, and includes
    a focus on freshwater ponds and lakes. Yet, current and proposed field monitoring
    across Cape Cod only represents a small percentage of ponds, which may not be
    representative or transferrable (CCC, 2021). Only about 10% of ponds had sufficient
    data to assess water quality in 2021, where at least three years of data from
    2016 onward were required for assessment, noting that the lack of sufficient data
    reflects a serious deficiency in public sector monitoring of freshwater ponds
    (APCC, 2021). Only 80 ponds across Cape Cod were included in the 2022 Massachusetts’
    Integrated Waters List, with 29 of these 80 ponds falling under the category of
    “uses not assessed” due to a lack of data (MassDEP, 2023). Field assessments across
    the Cape are typically concentrated in developed, easily accessible areas, with
    many systems rarely or never monitored (McCullough et al., 2012). Moreover, field
    monitoring can be inconsistent. There are 30 known pond monitoring programs across
    the Cape (CCC, 2021). This leads to inconsistencies in parameters measured and
    methods used; therefore, standardized, large-scale methods are needed. Satellite
    remote sensing has been established as an effective tool for monitoring water
    clarity (Lang et al., 2023; Page et al., 2019; Ren et al., 2018; Song et al.,
    2022), including for waters off the coast of Cape Cod (Hu et al., 2013; Luis et
    al., 2019). Satellite sensors offer frequent data collection and provide a standardized,
    repeatable product across locations and time. The 2021 Cape Cod Pond and Lake
    Atlas listed remote sensing as a potential tool for improving spatial and temporal
    coverage of water clarity estimates and for reducing costs associated with regional
    monitoring (CCC, 2021). Another unique advantage of satellite observations is
    the ability to perform retrospective analyses. Image archives for several Earth-observing
    satellites date back decades and are available to monitor past changes in water
    clarity across the Cape. In this study, satellite data is suggested as a complementary
    tool for managing water quality across Cape Cod ponds, providing data useable
    for assessing large-scale change, prioritizing resources, and understanding drivers
    of water clarity. Here, a multi-sensor satellite approach was used to assess water
    clarity for 193 ponds. The ponds analyzed in this study were selected based on
    a minimum surface area threshold of 1 ha and the availability of maximum pond
    depth data. While these ponds constitute only about one quarter of the 883 ponds
    across the Cape, they represent over 85% of its freshwater surface area, providing
    the most spatially comprehensive assessment of Cape Cod ponds to date. This study
    advances satellite monitoring of water clarity across Cape Cod to Application
    Readiness Level (ARL) 6 as defined by the National Aeronautics and Space Administration
    (NASA) Applied Sciences Program, and demonstrates a framework to advance efforts
    to ARL 7. ARL 6 is reached upon demonstration in a relevant environment, and ARL
    7 is reached upon use of an application prototype in a partner''s decision making
    (NASA, 2015). Additionally, this study regularly engaged partners across Cape
    Cod who intend to use methods presented here as a complementary tool for monitoring
    and managing inland water quality. Collaborating with local partners is particularly
    important in regional management contexts (Kearney et al., 2007; Perry et al.,
    2020). The following research objectives are addressed. 1. Use satellite imagery
    to estimate SDD by analyzing its relationship with field-measured SDD collected
    across 154 Cape Cod ponds. 2. Quantify long-term changes in SDD spanning 1984
    to 2022 for 193 Cape Cod ponds to establish a retrospective baseline of water
    clarity across the Cape. 3. Assess recent short-term changes in SDD between 2021
    and 2022 for 193 Cape Cod ponds as a tool for identifying ponds that may benefit
    from additional field monitoring. 2. Materials and methods 2.1. Study area Cape
    Cod is a peninsula off the southeast coast of Massachusetts. A narrow canal, the
    Cape Cod Canal, separates it from the mainland. It is bordered to the south by
    Nantucket Sound, to the east by the Atlantic Ocean, and to the north by Cape Cod
    Bay (Fig. 1). Cape Cod can be separated into four regions: the Upper Cape, Mid
    Cape, Lower Cape, and Outer Cape. Most development on the Cape extends from the
    Upper to Lower Cape, while over half of the Outer Cape is federally designated
    land as part of Cape Cod National Seashore (CCC, 2019). Cape Cod''s ponds are
    largely the result of glacial movement that left depressions in the land mass
    which filled with groundwater following the retreat of the last continental ice
    sheet approximately 25,000 years ago (Fisher, 1987). Due to their glacial formation,
    many of Cape Cod''s 883 ponds are hydrologically isolated from other surface water,
    with most lacking outflows and inflows and instead rely on rainfall and groundwater
    for recharge. Cape Cod ponds also discharge to groundwater on the downgradient
    side, and, therefore, their water level fluctuates along with groundwater levels.
    Cape Cod ponds range in size from less than an acre to 735 acres, covering nearly
    4% of the Cape''s surface area. Download : Download high-res image (485KB) Download

    analyzed in the current study (black), those analyzed that corresponded to field-measured
    Secchi disk depth (SDD; blue), and those analyzed without field-measured SDD (yellow).
    Ponds not analyzed were excluded either because they were less than 1 ha in surface
    area or because maximum pond depth data was not available. (For interpretation
    of the references to colour in this figure legend, the reader is referred to the
    Web version of this article.) 2.2. Field data Field-measured SDD were compiled
    by the Cape Cod Commission for the years 2001 through 2022, representing observations
    collected intermittently across 217 ponds (Fig. S1). This dataset represents an
    amalgamation of data collection efforts primarily coordinated through volunteer
    programs, including many town- and pond-specific programs, the Pond and Lake Stewardship
    (PALS) program, the Association to Preserve Cape Cod (APCC), and unpublished data
    from Cape Cod National Seashore (S.E. Fox unpublished data, National Park Service).
    Collection times were not readily available for all measurements, but most regional
    monitoring programs suggest observations be collected between 7 a.m. and 3 p.m.
    local time. A single SDD measurement is obtained by repeating the following steps
    three times and averaging the results: (1) A Secchi disk is lowered into the water
    and the depth at which the disk is no longer visible to the observer is recorded.
    (2) The Secchi disk is then raised and the depth at which the disk becomes visible
    again to the observer is recorded. (3) The depth at which the Secchi disk disappears
    and the depth at which it reappears are averaged. Pond depth has been found to
    improve satellite-estimated SDD (McCullough et al., 2012), and as described in
    Section 3.1, the addition of maximum pond depth as a predictor variable significantly
    improved satellite-estimated SDD across Cape Cod. Maximum pond depth was available
    for only a subset of ponds across the Cape (CCC, 2003), typically collected either
    using a sonar depth finder or by lowering a Secchi disk to the bottom of the pond.
    The Cape Cod Commission provided a dataset with maximum pond depth data for 181
    of the 883 ponds across the Cape. Maximum pond depth was obtained for 12 additional
    ponds from Portnoy et al. (2001), the Cape Cod Bay nautical chart, the 2003 Cape
    Cod Pond and Lake Atlas (CCC, 2003), and unpublished data from the Cape Cod Commission
    and the Orleans Pond Coalition. A subset of the Cape''s 883 ponds was used for
    model development and for assessing long- and recent short-term change (Fig. 2).
    First, ponds at least 1 ha (equivalent to 10,000 m2) in surface area were retained.
    This spatial requirement was dictated by the spatial resolution of the satellite
    sensors used in this study (see Section 2.3), and follows similar methods presented
    in Song et al. (2022). Applying a surface area threshold of 1 ha resulted in 364
    ponds for analysis. Next, only ponds that contained a measurement for the ponds''
    maximum depth were considered, resulting in 193 ponds assessed for both long-
    and recent short-term trends (Section 2.5); these 193 ponds correspond to the
    blue and yellow polygons in Fig. 1. While the 193 ponds analyzed here constitute
    only 22% of the 883 ponds across the Cape, they represent over 85% of its freshwater
    surface area. Of these 193 ponds, 154 contained coincident field-measured SDD
    and were used for random forest machine learning model development (Section 2.4);

    indicating the number of ponds included in each step of pond selection. The 193
    ponds at least 1 ha in size and containing data for maximum pond depth were assessed
    for long- and recent short-term change. Among them, the 154 ponds additionally
    containing field-measured Secchi disk depth (SDD) were used for random forest
    machine learning model development. 2.3. Satellite data Satellite imagery was
    acquired from both the joint NASA and United States Geological Survey (USGS) Landsat
    Program and the European Space Agency Copernicus Sentinel-2 mission. Leveraging
    multiple satellites reduces satellite revisit times for a particular location
    and increases data product accuracy (Masek et al., 2018). The Landsat Program
    is a series of Earth-observing satellites, which includes the Landsat 5 Thematic
    Mapper (TM), Landsat 7 Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus (ETM+), Landsat 8 Operational
    Land Imager (OLI), and Landsat 9 Operational Land Imager 2 (OLI-2). Sentinel-2
    data were obtained from the Sentinel-2A and -2B MultiSpectral Instruments (MSI),
    two functionally similar sensors that are hereafter collectively referred to as
    Sentinel-2. Each of these satellites covers a different time period spanning 1984
    to present, and Landsat 8, Landsat 9, and Sentinel-2 are still operational (Fig.
    3). This study is not intended to intercompare satellite performance; instead,
    the inclusion of these five satellite platforms is intended to build the most
    temporally comprehensive assessment possible, with overlapping satellite lifespans
    over the past 39 years offering a longer time period for change assessments and
    more frequent image acquisition (Fig. S1). Download : Download high-res image

    including Sentinel-2A (June 23, 2015 to present) and Sentinel-2B (March 7, 2017

    coverage by approximately 22% after May 31, 2003 (Storey et al., 2005). Sentinel-2
    offers higher spatial, temporal, and spectral resolutions compared to the Landsat
    satellites (Table S1). Sentinel-2 collects data in 13 spectral bands in the visible
    through shortwave infrared portions of the electromagnetic spectrum at spatial
    resolutions ranging from 10 to 60 m, offering a revisit frequency of 10 days at
    the Equator prior to the launch of Sentinel-2B and 5 days thereafter. Landsat
    5 and Landsat 7 collected data in 6 visible through shortwave infrared spectral
    bands while Landsat 8 and Landsat 9 collect data in 7 spectral bands, all at a
    spatial resolution of 30 m and with a revisit frequency of 16 days at the Equator.
    Given the relatively high latitude of Cape Cod and its location within multiple,
    overlapping satellite footprints, multiple observations per month were generally
    available (Fig. S2). Level 1, top-of-atmosphere reflectance measurements were
    retrieved for Landsat (Loveland and Dwyer, 2012) and Sentinel-2 (Aschbacher and
    Milagro-Pérez, 2012) using Google Earth Engine (GEE), a cloud-based geospatial
    processing platform that provides high-performance computing resources to directly
    process large geospatial datasets without the need to download data (Gorelick
    et al., 2017). Satellite images in GEE are pre-processed to facilitate fast and
    efficient access, including direct interpolation of the satellite imagery to the
    desired projection and resolution. Top-of-atmosphere reflectances were extracted
    through GEE and processed separately for each of the five satellite platforms
    (Table S1). Satellite pixels whose centers fell within a 10 m buffer of the shoreline
    were removed to reduce the possibility of erroneous values due to land adjacency
    effects. Satellite pixels impacted by cloud interference were identified using
    the C Function of Mask algorithm (Zhu et al., 2015); for Landsat data, pixels
    flagged as “cloud,” “dilated cloud,” “cirrus cloud,” and “cloud shadow” were removed.
    For Sentinel-2, pixels flagged as \"opaque cloud\" and “cirrus cloud” were removed.
    Only satellite observations collected during the monitoring season were considered,
    where the monitoring season was defined as 1 April through 31 October of each
    year, as this is the time period during which most field-measured SDD were collected.
    To analyze the relationship between satellite-estimated and field-measured SDD,
    satellite data were extracted within a 10-m buffer of location information provided
    with each field measurement at 154 ponds where field-measured SDD was available.
    If for a given location a 10-m buffer corresponded to multiple satellite pixels,
    reflectance values were averaged across satellite pixels for each spectral band.
    To assess long- and recent short-term changes in satellite-estimated SDD, satellite
    data were extracted within a 10-m buffer of the central point within the pond,
    defined as the point with the maximum distance from shore, at 193 ponds. Again,
    if this 10-m buffer corresponded to multiple satellite pixels, reflectance values
    were averaged. To limit the inclusion of floating vegetation in satellite-predicted
    SDD estimates, the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), a commonly used
    measure of vegetation health, was computed (Rouse et al., 1974). SDD estimates
    corresponding to an NDVI greater than 0.3 were discarded following Kleinschroth
    et al. (2021). 2.4. Predicting SDD using satellite data To generate satellite-predicted
    SDD, a random forest machine learning model was used. While several studies have
    defined algorithms for predicting SDD from both Landsat and Sentinel-2 data (Lang
    et al., 2023; Page et al., 2019; Ren et al., 2018; Song et al., 2022), performance
    for Cape Cod ponds was poor. A random forest is an ensemble machine learning method
    that consists of a collection of regression trees that use a random subset of
    data to estimate the response variable given several predictor variables (Breiman,
    2001). Random forest machine learning methods have frequently been applied to
    remote sensing data as they provide a good balance between processing time and
    model performance, and are relatively insensitive to predictor collinearity (Belgiu
    and Drăguţ, 2016). Two different random forest machine learning models were generated
    for each satellite sensor to assess the effect of maximum pond depth on satellite
    predictions of SDD. One random forest considered maximum pond depth and spectral
    information while the other random forest considered exclusively spectral information.
    For Sentinel-2, only the spectral bands with relatively high (10 and 20 m) spatial
    resolution were used, while spectral bands with spatial resolutions of 60 m were
    excluded (see Table S1). Each random forest was generated by creating 500 regression
    trees and used a random subset of 70% of the data for model training while the
    remaining 30% of the data was used for model testing; the number of coincident
    observations used for model training and testing can be found in Table S2. Satellite-predicted
    SDDs that were greater than field-measured maximum pond depth were set to the
    maximum pond depth in an effort to reduce inaccurate measurements due to bottom
    reflectance. Random forest machine learning development was performed in R Version
    4.3.0 (R Core Team, 2023), using the randomForest package (Liaw and Wiener, 2002).
    To statistically assess agreement between field-measured and satellite-predicted
    SDD, the non-parametric Spearman rank correlation, mean absolute error (MAE),
    and average bias were used. The Spearman rank correlation (rs) measures the strength
    and direction of the monotonic association between two ranked variables (Spearman,
    1987), and was interpreted following Prion and Haerling (2014), where |rs| < 0.2
    indicates a negligible association between datasets, 0.2 ≤ |rs| < 0.4 a weak association,
    0.4 ≤ |rs| < 0.6 a moderate association, 0.6 ≤ |rs| < 0.8 a strong association,
    and |rs| ≥ 0.8 a very strong association. Temporal offsets between satellite image
    acquisition and field data collection of 1 to 5 days were tested. Across all five
    satellite platforms, the day offset whose rs had the highest weighted average,
    which considers both the strength of the correlation and the sample size, was
    selected. MAE and bias were computed to summarize algorithm performance following
    recommendations in Seegers et al. (2018) for aquatic remote sensing. MAE is the
    average of the absolute value of the differences between field-measured and satellite-predicted
    SDDs, in m, where a value of zero indicates perfect agreement between datasets.
    Bias is the average of the difference between field-measured and satellite-predicted
    SDDs, and indicates the average depth, in m, that satellite estimates tended to
    under- or over-predict SDD compared to field measurements. MAE and bias were computed
    using the Metrics package (Hamner and Frasco, 2018) in R Version 4.3.0 (R Core
    Team, 2023). 2.5. Assessing long- and recent short-term changes 2.5.1. Assessing
    long-term changes Long-term, interannual changes were assessed for 193 ponds to
    determine if water clarity increased or decreased over the observational period
    of satellite imagery. First, predicted SDD from each satellite sensor was cross-compared
    for overlapping time periods (Fig. 2) to determine which sensors, if any, could
    be analyzed collectively as a single timeseries. Combining satellite observations
    allows for a longer timeseries to be considered in trend assessments; Coffer et
    al. (2021) found that a minimum of 10 years of observations are needed for long-term
    trends in water quality data to exceed variability in the data. Satellite-predicted
    SDDs from each sensor were averaged for each month during the monitoring season,
    and corresponding average monthly SDDs were compared. Agreement between satellite-predicted
    SDD across sensors was again assessed using rs, MAE, and bias. Results indicated
    that all satellite sensors could be analyzed as a single timeseries, spanning
    1984 to 2022 (see Section 3.3). Thus, satellite-predicted SDDs were combined for
    all sensors, averaged for each monitoring season, and a trend assessment was performed.
    The nonparametric Mann-Kendall test for trend was used to indicate whether a monotonic
    trend was present in the data (Kendall, 1955; Mann, 1945), and the Theil-Sen slope
    was used to determine the magnitude of the trend (Sen, 1968; Theil, 1992). This
    robust trend assessment allows missing data in the timeseries, makes no assumptions
    regarding data distribution, and is insensitive to outliers. Long-term trends
    were assessed according to the resulting p-value at a significance level of α
    = 0.10, following the recommendation by Wang et al. (2020) for Mann-Kendall tests
    of water quality data. The Mann-Kendall test for trend was performed in R Version
    4.3.0 (R Core Team, 2023), using the rkt package (Marchetto, 2021). To put observed
    long-term changes in satellite-predicted SDD into the context of coincident climate
    conditions, long-term weather observations were obtained. Average annual air temperature
    and cumulative annual precipitation were retrieved from the Parameter-elevation
    Regressions on Independent Slopes Model (PRISM) produced by the PRISM Climate
    Group at Oregon State University (Daly et al., 2008, 2015) and stored as GEE product
    “OREGONSTATE/PRISM/AN81m.” Average annual air temperature was computed by averaging
    corresponding monthly average air temperatures, and cumulative annual precipitation
    was computed by summing monthly total precipitation, including rain and melted
    snow. Weather data were extracted from GEE at the central point of each pond spanning
    1984 to 2022, and were aggregated across all 193 ponds to generate a single air
    temperature and precipitation value per year. The Mann-Kendall test for trend
    and associated Theil-Sen Slope were used to assess long-term changes in these
    timeseries at a significance level of α = 0.10. 2.5.2. Assessing recent short-term
    changes Recent short-term changes were assessed for 193 ponds to determine if
    water clarity for the current year was statistically different from water clarity
    for the previous year. This framework can be used by stakeholders to assess recent
    changes in water clarity, which can be useful for resource prioritization. The
    most recent monitoring season, 2022, was assessed against the previous 2021 monitoring
    season by combining observations from two satellites, Landsat 8 and Sentinel-2,
    as their data archives included full-year timeseries for 2021 and 2022. The nonparametric
    Mann-Whitney U test was used to assess if satellite-predicted SDDs during the
    2021 and 2022 monitoring seasons were generated from the same population (Mann
    and Whitney, 1947; Wilcoxon, 1992). Only ponds with at least 5 observations per
    monitoring season were considered, following minimum sample size recommendations
    from Mundry and Fischer (1998). Additionally, ponds whose satellite-estimated
    SDDs contained duplicate values for at least half of all estimates were not considered,
    as their low variance may bias statistical comparisons in rank-based analyses
    (Divine et al., 2018). Differences were assessed according to the resulting p-value
    at a significance level of α = 0.05. 3. Results 3.1. Association between satellite-predicted
    and field-measured SDD Satellite imagery was well-suited for predicting SDD across
    Cape Cod ponds, with rs ranging from 0.78 to 0.86 for a temporal offset of up
    to 4 days between field data collection and satellite imagery acquisition, indicating
    \"strong\" and \"very strong\" associations between datasets (Fig. 4, Table 1).
    Corresponding rs was strongest for Landsat 9 (rs = 0.86, n = 42) and weakest for
    Landsat 5 (rs = 0.78, n = 165), and the weighted average rs for all satellites
    was 0.80 (n = 778). MAE and bias also indicated strong agreement between field-measured
    and satellite-estimated SDD, with the lowest MAE of 0.65 m corresponding to SDD
    estimated from Landsat 9 and the highest MAE of 1.05 m corresponding to SDD estimated
    from Sentinel-2. These MAE values indicate that differences between field-measured
    and satellite-estimated SDD were typically within 1 m. Bias suggested that nearly
    all satellite platforms slightly underestimated SDD compared to field measurements
    as indicated by negative bias values for all satellites except Landsat 7, ranging
    from −0.2 to 0.06 m. For Landsat 5, 7, and 8, satellite-predicted SDD was more
    closely related to field measurements for SDDs between approximately 1.5 and 7.5
    m; at SDDs shallower than 1.5 m, satellite estimates generally overestimated SDD
    compared to field measurements, while at SDDs deeper than 7.5 m, satellite estimates
    generally underestimated SDD. Underestimation at depths greater than 7.5 m was
    less pronounced in Landsat 9 and Sentinel-2, which both indicated relatively consistent
    agreement at all field-measured SDDs deeper than 1.5 m. Download : Download high-res

    are shown in Table S3. Agreement statistics include Spearman rank correlation
    (rs), mean absolute error (MAE) in m, and mean bias in m. Satellite-predicted
    SDD was generated using random forest machine learning models that considered
    both spectral information and maximum pond depth as predictor variables; n indicates
    the sample size of coincident satellite and field measurements used for model
    testing. Offset Satellite n rs Associationa MAE Bias 4 days Landsat 5 165 0.78
    Strong 0.99 −0.11 Landsat 7 263 0.79 Strong 1.04 0.06 Landsat 8 139 0.83 Very
    strong 0.89 −0.10 Landsat 9 42 0.86 Very strong 0.65 −0.20 Sentinel-2 169 0.80
    Very strong 1.05 −0.02 Weighted average 778 0.80 Very strong 0.98 −0.04 a Spearman
    rank correlation was interpreted following Prion and Haerling (2014). Generally,
    the offset between field data collection and satellite overpass had minimal effect
    on random forest machine learning model performance. The weighted average rs for
    offsets up to between 1 to 3 and 5 days ranged between 0.77 and 0.78, indicative
    of a \"strong\" association between datasets, while weighted average MAE ranged
    from 1.02 to 1.14 m and weighted average bias ranged from 0.04 to 0.14 m (Table
    S3). A temporal offset of up to 4 days yielded the strongest weighted average
    rs and thus was used for model training and testing; however, similarly strong
    agreement for temporal offsets of up to between 1 to 3 and 5 days suggest that
    the offset between satellite image acquisition and field data collection is of
    minimal importance for obtaining representative satellite-based estimates. Across
    offsets of up to between 1 to 3 and 5 days, Landsat 9 continued to demonstrate
    the strongest agreement, with rs ranging from 0.83 (n = 37) for an offset of up
    to 3 days to 0.91 for offsets of up to 2 and 5 days (n = 25 and 45, respectively).
    Similarly, MAE ranged from 0.54 m with a bias of −0.15 m (n = 45) for an offset
    of up to 5 days to 0.66 m with a bias of −0.12 m (n = 25) for an offset of up
    to 2 days. While temporal offset was not particularly important for random forest
    machine learning model performance, the inclusion of maximum pond depth as a predictor
    variable strongly impacted model performance (Table S4), consistent with findings
    from McCullough et al. (2012). When maximum pond depth was not included, the weighted
    average rs for offsets of up to between 1 to 5 days ranged from 0.63 for offsets
    of up to 2 and 5 days (n = 464 and 860, respectively) to 0.68 (n = 216) for an
    offset of 1 day. Similarly, both MAE and bias increased when maximum pond depth
    was not included as a predictor variable, with weighted average MAE ranging from
    1.22 m with a bias of 0.09 m (n = 778) for an offset of up to 4 days to 1.37 m
    with a bias of 0.23 m (n = 216) for an offset of up to 1 day. While these rs values
    are still considered “strong” associations according to Prion and Haerling (2014),
    they are considerably lower than equivalent rs when maximum pond depth was included
    as a predictor variable, and both MAE and bias also showed notable increases when
    only spectral information was considered. 3.2. SDD across Cape Cod ponds Satellite-estimated
    SDD was summarized across Cape Cod regions for each of the 193 ponds analyzed
    and for the 2022 monitoring season, varying from a median of 0.61 m at Israel
    Pond in the town of Barnstable located in the Mid Cape to 6.0 m at Round Pond
    (East) in the town of Truro located in the Outer Cape (Fig. 5, Table S5). Distributions
    of satellite-predicted SDD across Cape Cod''s four regions were relatively similar,
    although the median satellite-predicted SDD in the Upper Cape region was about
    1 m deeper than the Mid, Lower, and Outer Cape regions (Fig. 5a). Median satellite-predicted
    SDDs for the Mid, Lower, and Outer Cape regions were all categorized as “suitable,”
    following Smith and Davies-Colley (1992) who defined categories of perceived aquatic
    suitability-for-use for recreational activities (Table S6). Median satellite-predicted
    SDD for the Upper Cape region was categorized as “eminently suitable.” Across
    Cape Cod towns, median satellite-predicted SDDs for the 2022 monitoring season
    were more variable (Fig. 5b). The town of Truro, located in the Outer Cape, had
    a median satellite-predicted SDD of nearly 6 m with most of the distribution falling
    within the “eminently suitable” category. Conversely, the town of Provincetown,
    which lies just to the north of Truro also in the Outer Cape, had the lowest median
    satellite-predicted SDD for the 2022 monitoring season and fell within the “unsuitable”
    category. All other towns had a median within either the “suitable” or “eminently
    suitable” categories. Download : Download high-res image (341KB) Download : Download

    in Smith and Davies-Colley (1992) and represent perceived suitability-for-use
    for recreational activities (see Table S6). Note, the y-axes are reversed such
    that the pond water surface is at the top of the figure. 3.3. Long-term changes
    in SDD For each of the five satellites considered in this study, cross comparisons
    for average monthly SDD during overlapping satellite time periods demonstrated
    “very strong” associations, indicating that all satellites could be analyzed collectively
    as a single timeseries (Table 2, Fig. S3). Overlapping average monthly observations
    collected from Landsat 7 and Landsat 8 and from Landsat 8 and Sentinel-2 had the
    highest rs (0.91; n = 5685 and 4766, respectively). Overlapping average monthly
    observations collected from Landsat 5 and Landsat 7 had the lowest MAE (0.44 m;
    n = 6913), while those collected from Landsat 8 and Sentinel-2 had the strongest
    bias (−0.04 m, n = 4766). The cross comparison between Landsat 9 and Sentinel-2
    had the lowest rs (0.85; n = 784) and highest MAE (0.56 m), with Landsat 9 predicting
    lower SDDs than Sentinel-2 (bias = −0.13 m). For all satellite cross comparisons,
    disagreement was higher at deeper satellite-predicted SDDs. Given “very strong”
    associations for all cross comparisons, satellite-predicted SDD from all five
    platforms was combined to form a single 39-year timeseries, spanning 1984 to 2022,
    which was used to assess long-term changes in SDD. Table 2. Agreement statistics
    for a cross comparison of average monthly Secchi disk depth (SDD) during overlapping
    satellite time periods (see also Fig. S3). Agreement statistics include Spearman

    correlation was interpreted following Prion and Haerling (2014). Statistically
    significant changes in satellite-estimated SDD from 1984 to 2022 were observed
    in 81% of ponds (157 of 193; Fig. 6, Table S7). 149 of these ponds increased in
    satellite-estimated SDD, indicating improving water clarity conditions, while
    8 ponds decreased in satellite-estimated SDD, indicating deteriorating water clarity.
    Of the 8 ponds with deteriorating long-term water clarity, 7 were located in the
    Mid Cape. For ponds with deteriorating long-term water clarity, percent change
    across the 39-year timeseries ranged from 6 to 16%. Ponds with improving long-term
    water clarity were more spatially distributed across the Cape, and percent change
    ranged from 1 to 67%. Fig. 6 shows a single timeseries for a pond with improving
    long-term water clarity conditions and a single timeseries for a pond with deteriorating
    long-term water clarity conditions. Satellite-estimated SDD for Long Pond in Wellfleet,
    located in the Outer Cape, increased by 43% over the 39-year timeseries from a
    depth of about 4 m in 1984 to a depth of nearly 6 m in 2022 (n = 39, |tau| = 0.57,
    p-value <0.001; Fig. 6b). Conversely, satellite-estimated SDD for Long Pond in
    Barnstable (village of Marstons Mills), located in the Mid Cape, decreased by
    9% over the 39-year timeseries from a depth of nearly 3.5 m in 1984 to just over
    3 m in 2022 (n = 39, |tau| = 0.21, p-value = 0.06; Fig. 6c). Download : Download

    surface is at the top of the figure, meaning increasing SDD is shown as a downward
    trend and decreasing SDD is shown as an upward trend. Concurrent long-term weather
    observations indicated warmer and wetter conditions across 193 Cape Cod ponds
    from 1984 to 2022, as satellite-estimated SDD largely improved across these ponds
    (Fig. S4). Following global increases in both air temperature and precipitation,
    Cape Cod''s average annual air temperature increased over 1 °C across the four
    decades of data assessed (n = 39, |tau| = 0.40, p-value <0.001; Fig. S4a). Similarly,
    cumulative annual precipitation increased from 1984 to 2022 from approximately
    1100 mm of precipitation in 1984 to 1300 mm in 2022 (n = 39, |tau| = 0.26, p-value
    = 0.022; Fig. S4b). 3.4. Recent short-term changes in SDD Of the 193 ponds considered,
    44 were not assessed for differences in satellite-estimated SDD from 2021 to 2022
    due to insufficient variability to confidently assess recent short-term change
    (Divine et al., 2018). Of the remaining 149 ponds, 96 indicated a statistically
    significant difference in satellite-estimated SDD from 2021 to 2022 (Table S8).
    Each of these ponds had a lower median satellite-estimated SDD in 2022 than in
    2021, indicating deteriorating water clarity conditions. No ponds showed a short-term
    improvement in water clarity from 2021 to 2022, while 53 ponds had no statistically
    significant change in satellite-estimated SDD. Featured in Fig. 7 are Shawme Pond,
    Mashpee-Wakeby Pond, and Lower Mill Pond. Download : Download high-res image (305KB)

    water surface is at the top of the figure; n indicates the number of satellite
    images included in the distribution. Shawme Pond, located in the Upper Cape, has
    seen an increase in algal blooms over the past decade according to the Town of
    Sandwich Board of Health, with algae growth in 2022 being particularly extensive
    (Devaney, 2022). The Mann-Whitney U test indicated that satellite-estimated SDD
    was substantially lower in 2022 than in 2021, indicating a deterioration in year-over-year
    water clarity (Fig. 7a; U = 913, N = 72, p-value = 0.002). In 2021, satellite-estimated
    SDD had a median of 2.76 m compared to a median of 2.33 in 2022. Mashpee-Wakeby
    Pond, also located in the Upper Cape, has seen significant degradation according
    to the Mashpee-Wakeby Pond Alliance, and the Mashpee Board of Health has issued
    several advisories for cyanobacterial blooms in recent years. Results of the Mann-Whitney
    U test support these observations, with substantially lower satellite-estimated
    SDD in 2022 compared to 2021 (Fig. 7b; U = 756, N = 69, p-value = 0.026). In 2021,
    satellite-estimated SDD had a median of 4.60 m, indicating clearer waters than
    the median of 4.29 m estimated for 2022. The Town of Brewster in the Lower Cape
    has seen a degradation in freshwater ponds according to the Brewster Ponds Coalition,
    with cyanobacterial blooms noted at several ponds, including Lower Mill Pond (Walsh,
    2022). The Mann-Whitney U test again indicated that satellite-estimated SDD was
    substantially lower in 2022 compared to 2021 (Fig. 7c; U = 2031, N = 109, p-value
    = < 0.001). In 2021, median satellite-estimated SDD was 2.35 m, while in 2022,
    median satellite-estimated SDD was 2.02 m. 4. Discussion Recent literature has
    suggested that water quality across Cape Cod has worsened (Devaney, 2022; Fraser,
    2022; Walsh, 2022), and both Flavelle (2023) and Howes et al. (2022) noted deteriorating
    water quality in nearby coastal embayments. The APCC''s 2022 State of the Waters
    report found that 90% of coastal embayments received an unacceptable water quality
    grade, an increase from 87% in 2021, 79% in 2020, and 68% in 2019, where APCC
    water quality grades consider several parameters in addition to water clarity
    (Gottlieb et al., 2023). Yet few datasets are available for assessing large-scale
    change for inland, freshwater systems. This study established a framework for
    assessing water clarity for nearly 200 Cape Cod ponds, representing 85% of the
    Cape''s freshwater surface area, and provided the most comprehensive statistical
    assessment to date of long- and recent short-term change. Identifying ponds with
    changing water clarity allows for efficient resource prioritization and provides
    a complement to improve spatial and temporal coverage offered through traditional
    field-based monitoring. Satellite imagery from both the Landsat Program and the
    Sentinel-2 mission were well-suited for characterizing SDD across Cape Cod. Corresponding
    rs between satellite-estimated SDD and field-measured SDD were either \"strong\"
    or “very strong” for each satellite platform, and both MAE and bias indicated
    favorable agreement. Many studies have defined algorithms to predict SDD from
    satellite imagery, including from Landsat and Sentinel-2, and the random forest
    machine learning model defined here provided similar predictive capacity. Keith
    et al. (2023) used Landsat 8 data to measure water clarity for nearly 300 locations
    across the United States, achieving a MAE of 0.92 m, and Page et al. (2019) leveraged
    both Landsat 8 and Sentinel-2 to predict SDD for lakes in Minnesota, yielding
    MAE between 0.25 and 0.67 m. Yet neither of these studies, nor any previously
    published algorithms, focus on the inland waters of Cape Cod. SDD algorithms tend
    to be highly regional as large-scale relationships are complicated by the nonlinear
    response of SDD to optical properties and both physical and chemical processes
    of different waters (Zhang et al., 2022a). The random forest machine learning
    model defined here represents the first algorithm specifically defined for inland
    Cape Cod waters, which are unique in their limnology given their glacial formation
    and relative isolation from other inland systems. Using data from Landsat 5, 7,
    and 8, satellite data underpredicted SDD compared to field measurements at deeper
    field-measured SDD and slightly overpredicted SDD at shallower field-measured
    SDD. Thus, satellite imagery from these platforms should be interpreted with caution
    at SDDs deeper than approximately 7.5 m or shallower than approximately 1.5 m,
    and tracking improving or declining long- and recent short-term change at these
    depths can be challenging. While overestimation in satellite-predicted SDD at
    depths shallower than 1.5 m were consistent across satellite platforms, underestimation
    at depths deeper than 7.5 m primarily occurred for satellite observations from
    Landsat 5, 7, and 8, ranging from 1984 to present, and not for SDDs estimated
    from Landsat 9, ranging from 2021 to present, or Sentinel-2, ranging from 2015
    to present. Maximum pond depth was an important predictor variable in estimating
    SDD from satellite imagery, consistent with results presented in McCullough et
    al. (2012), but this limited the number of ponds available for analysis. Using
    data from either the Landsat Program or the Sentinel-2 mission, approximately
    half of the 883 ponds across the Cape can be monitored routinely. However, incomplete
    maximum pond depth data resulted in satellite-estimated SDD only being generated
    for 193 of these ponds (CCC, 2003). Additionally, only static maximum pond depth
    measurements were considered in this study, but maximum pond depth can fluctuate
    over time with water level and changes in pond bathymetry. While maximum pond
    depth was an important predictor variable, its inclusion can also stabilize resulting
    satellite-estimated SDDs over time since its value remains constant over an otherwise
    variable timeseries. The collection of additional maximum pond depth data across
    both space and time should be a primary focus of future field efforts, which would
    increase satellite data coverage for ponds across Cape Cod. The temporal offset
    (i.e., the number of days) between satellite image acquisition and field data
    collection had little impact on random forest machine learning model performance.
    This suggests that, generally, SDD across Cape Cod did not change drastically
    over sub-weekly time periods. Rather than coordinating field data collection for
    the same day of satellite overpass, management applications should instead focus
    on targeting ideal collection conditions. Dodds and Whiles (2010) noted that Secchi
    disks provide the most consistent measurements in calm, sunny, midday conditions.
    Allowing for a broader temporal offset between field data collection and satellite
    image acquisition also increases the number of observations available for both
    model development and agreement assessments. Across Cape Cod ponds, median satellite-estimated
    SDD for 2022 ranged from 0.61 to 6.00 m. These results are well within the published
    range for the Cape. In Ahrens and Siver (2000) and Siver (2001), SDD was measured
    for 60 Cape Cod ponds from 1996 to 1998. Ponds averaged a SDD of 4.4 m, ranging
    from 0.3 to 9.4 m. Wagner et al. (2017) monitored 10 ponds across Cape Cod, finding
    summer SDD ranged from 0.5 to 7.8 m over the study period. Within the Cape Cod
    National Seashore, Smith et al. (2018a) noted SDDs ranging from 1.5 to 7.5 m across
    its 15 ponds. Here, satellite data suggested that ponds generally fell within
    the “suitable” or “eminently suitable” categories as defined in Smith and Davies-Colley
    (1992). The sole exception was the town of Provincetown, located in the Outer
    Cape. Median SDD for ponds across Provincetown for 2022 was 0.91 m, corresponding
    to the “unsuitable” category and consistent with results presented in Ahrens and
    Siver (2000) and Siver (2001). Provincetown ponds are notably different from other
    ponds across the Cape, unique in both their formation and characteristics. While
    most Cape Cod ponds are glacially formed, Provincetown ponds were formed after
    the stabilization of sand dunes when depressions within interdunal swales intersected
    groundwater (Giese et al., 2015; Oldale, 1976). These ponds are young for Cape
    Cod and are generally shallow, highly acidic, and nutrient-rich (CCC, 2021). Shallow
    SDDs may be a natural product of the ponds formation and characteristics, rather
    than the result of water quality stressors, but additional data is needed to differentiate
    drivers of SDD in these ponds. A multi-decade assessment of water clarity suggested
    conditions are generally improving across relatively large ponds greater than
    1 ha in surface area, with 77% of the 193 ponds analyzed increasing in satellite-estimated
    SDD from 1984 to 2022. Changes in satellite-estimated SDD were accompanied by
    decadal increases in air temperatures and cumulative precipitation. Smith et al.
    (2018a) assessed trends in field-measured SDD for the month of August across ponds
    in Cape Cod National Seashore, finding SDD either did not change or increased
    from 1996 to 2016. Through a similar analysis, Smith et al. (2018b) also found
    significant increases in the depths of 25% and 50% light transmission, which represent
    additional measures of water clarity, from 1999 to 2014 for nine ponds in Cape
    Cod National Seashore. Across the nation, Topp et al. (2021) found that water
    clarity has improved for United States'' inland waters since 1984, including for
    the Northern Appalachians region where Cape Cod is located. And while many ponds
    in this study have improved in water clarity over the past 40 years, none demonstrated
    recent short-term improvements in water clarity from 2021 to 2022. Both long-
    and recent short-term change assessments offer unique perspectives for water quality
    management. Long-term change assessments provide baseline information and offer
    a range of historic water clarity conditions. Short-term change assessments benefit
    efficient resource prioritization; for example, ponds with deteriorating year-over-year
    water clarity may be a focus for additional field measurements the following monitoring
    season. While long- and recent short-term change assessments presented here provide
    valuable information for Cape Cod, trend analyses in general should be interpreted
    with caution as they provide an incomplete evaluation of water quality conditions.
    For example, the Mann-Kendall test for trend, used here to assess long-term change,
    is designed to detect monotonic changes, meaning variables increased or decreased
    over the entire time period. If satellite-estimated SDD increased then decreased
    over time, or vice versa, it will not be captured as a statistically significant
    change. Additionally, long-term improvements in water clarity do not necessarily
    mean that water clarity conditions are favorable. Coffer et al. (2021) found significant
    reductions in satellite-estimated cyanobacterial abundance at Grand Lake, Ohio,
    but cyanobacterial blooms were still a consistent occurrence over the time period,
    and waters remain impaired (Jacquemin et al., 2023). Moreover, improving water
    clarity does not directly indicate improving water quality as some factors can
    have contrasting effects on water clarity and quality; for example, the species
    composition of submerged macrophytes can positively impact water clarity without
    improving its quality (Liu et al., 2020). Analyzing drivers of water clarity was
    beyond the scope of this study, but has been reported elsewhere. Smith et al.
    (2018a) assessed the relationship between SDD and water quality constituents,
    physical pond features, shoreline housing densities, and wildlife occurrence for
    ponds in Cape Cod National Seashore. Only deep-water nutrient concentrations were
    related to SDD, where higher concentrations of total nitrogen and phosphorus led
    to lower SDD. Cape Cod''s freshwater ponds and coastal estuaries are under stress
    from excess nutrients (WWW Document), and towns are responsible for managing nutrient
    inputs under Section 208 of the Clean Water Act. Many towns have a Comprehensive
    Wastewater Management Plan or other local nutrient management plans to address
    environmental impacts from septic systems and other nutrient sources, though the
    progress of those plans varies widely. Septic systems, stormwater runoff, and
    fertilizer are all sources of nitrogen and phosphorus loading to ponds, and while
    septic systems are the dominant source of nitrogen to fresh and coastal waters,
    the relative contribution of each source to phosphorus loading is less clear due
    to the lower mobility of phosphorus through soil. Detailed analyses focused on
    elucidating driving factors of water clarity are a focus of ongoing research efforts
    and will be presented in subsequent studies. Specifically, more comprehensive
    estimates of water clarity, such as those estimated via satellite imagery, may
    be combined with other geospatial data to better understand the connection between
    landscape features indicative of different phosphorus sources and corresponding
    water quality. Consistent, large-scale estimates of SDD, such as those from satellite
    data, can be leveraged for understanding additional components of water quality
    across the Cape. The widely-used Carlson Trophic State Index can be calculated
    from some combination of SDD, chlorophyll-a, total phosphorus, or total nitrogen
    (Carlson, 1977). This index has been used by APCC to grade ponds across Cape Cod
    (Gottlieb et al., 2023). While satellite imagery is unable to detect nutrients,
    this study demonstrated that it can be used to estimate SDD across Cape Cod ponds,
    and studies have shown the ability to estimate chlorophyll-a concentration with
    both Landsat (Cao et al., 2020; Duan et al., 2008; Keith et al., 2023) and Sentinel-2
    (Pahlevan et al., 2020; Woo Kim et al., 2022). Thus, satellite imagery may be
    used to complement field-based efforts for applying the Carlson Trophic State
    Index across broader scales than is currently feasible through field data alone.
    This study offers the most temporally and spatially comprehensive management framework
    to date for monitoring water clarity across Cape Cod, but there are several limitations
    to consider. Only 193 ponds were analyzed, and conclusions are not fully representative
    of past or current conditions across the Cape. This assessment represented conditions
    at the center of each pond, but nearshore areas are where recreational use primarily
    occurs and where wind-driven algal blooms tend to accumulate (Gons et al., 2005).
    Only the monitoring season was considered, as this period represents when most
    field data were collected, but assessing water quality data for the entire year
    would provide a more holistic understanding of pond health for management prioritization.
    Additionally, both field and satellite data are not without error. Trees et al.
    (1985) found that error in field-based chlorophyll-a measurements can range from
    30 to 60%, and field-measured SDD differs based on the time of day, angle of the
    sun, and weather conditions (Dodds and Whiles, 2010). SDD performs well in clear
    waters, but its magnitude tends to diminish in more turbid conditions (Zheng and
    DiGiacomo, 2022). Satellite data coverage is limited by clouds, Sun glint, snow,
    and ice cover, and are impacted by adjacency effects from neighboring land (Schaeffer
    et al., 2012). Here, a buffer of 10 m from the shoreline was removed before further
    analysis, but previous studies have indicated that adjacency effects can impact
    distances equivalent to up to four satellite pixels (Hestir et al., 2015), or
    up to 3 km offshore (H. Zhang et al., 2022). 5. Conclusions This study defined
    a framework for assessing long- and recent short-term changes in SDD across Cape
    Cod, important for both local and regional management and efficient resource prioritization.
    While this study focused solely on Cape Cod, the same methods can be applied to
    other areas given the availability of local field data. This study advances satellite
    monitoring of water clarity across Cape Cod to NASA''s ARL 6, which is reached
    upon “demonstration in relevant environment,” and provides guidance for achieving
    ARL 7, reached upon the “use of application prototype in partner''s decision making.”
    NASA has also defined a “research to operations” and “operations to research”
    (R2O–O2R) framework (Cooley et al., 2022). R2O occurs when knowledge and technology
    are transferred between researchers and those that manage natural systems, while
    O2R occurs when decision-makers motivate and inform research efforts. The R2O–O2R
    framework consists of six iterative, linked processes. To date, this research
    has addressed the first four of these processes through iterative engagement and
    feedback from partners across Cape Cod: (1) Understand operational needs, (2)
    Build relationships and institutional buy-in, (3) Demonstrate technical feasibility,
    and (4) Identify resources available for transition. The remaining two processes,
    (5) Integrate into an operational system and (6) Sustained use in an operational
    system, are a primary focus of ongoing efforts. Similarly, the National Oceanic
    and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) has defined nine readiness levels (RL) designed
    to assess the maturity of research and development projects for transition to
    operation. NOAA''s RLs are grouped into Research (RL 1–2), Development (RL 3–5),
    Demonstration (RL 6–8), and Deployment (RL 9). To date, this research has achieved
    RL 6, “demonstrated prototype in a relevant environment.” RL 7, “demonstrated
    prototype in an operational environment,” is currently being implemented, and
    RLs 8 and 9 are a focus of future efforts. All processing scripts accompanying

  description: Lake thermal dynamics have been considerably impacted by climate change,
    with potential adverse effects on aquatic ecosystems. To better understand the
    potential impacts of future climate change on lake thermal dynamics and related
    processes, the use of mathematical models is essential. In this study, we provide
    a comprehensive review of lake water temperature modeling. We begin by discussing
    the physical concepts that regulate thermal dynamics in lakes, which serve as
    a primer for the description of process-based models. We then provide an overview
    of different sources of observational water temperature data, including in situ
    monitoring and satellite Earth observations, used in the field of lake water temperature
    modeling. We classify and review the various lake water temperature models available,
    and then discuss model performance, including commonly used performance metrics
    and optimization methods. Finally, we analyze emerging modeling approaches, including
    forecasting, digital twins, combining process-based modeling with deep learning,
    evaluating structural model differences through ensemble modeling, adapted water
    management, and coupling of climate and lake models. This review is aimed at a
    diverse group of professionals working in the fields of limnology and hydrology,
    including ecologists, biologists, physicists, engineers, and remote sensing researchers
    from the private and public sectors who are interested in understanding lake water
    temperature modeling and its potential applications.

    are a major component of the hydrosphere which are able to accumulate and transfer
    energy and matter to and from other spheres of the environment. Lakes, especially
    the largest ones, have higher thermal inertia and longer residence times than
    those of other inland water bodies such as rivers and lagoons, and thus they act
    as buffers in the inland waters transport network. As such, they play an important
    role in the global water cycle and in regulating biodiversity, the availability
    and quality of water resources, and the provision of ecosystem services. In many
    regions of the world, lakes are of key significance in purely environmental terms,
    and also through their relevance for human life and socioeconomic activities.
    Human activities contribute to the ongoing alteration of the quality of inland
    water bodies. For example, over-exploitation of water resources causes the progressive,
    and sometimes abrupt, shrinking of lakes. This is an emergent issue especially
    in drylands (Klein et al., 2014; H. Liu et al., 2019) that leads to, for example,
    the disappearing of the Aral Sea. A decrease in lake water storage across the
    globe is also an effect of climate change (E. A. Webb & Liljedahl, 2023; F. Yao
    et al., 2023; G. Zhao et al., 2022), which has motivated a growing need for models
    that predict lake water levels (Ozdemir et al., 2023). Recent studies have suggested
    a rapid and abrupt change in water temperature, ice cover, water quality, and
    hydrobiological conditions in lakes worldwide, with clear regime shifts observed
    in some cases (North et al., 2013; Tan et al., 2018; Van Cleave et al., 2014;
    W. Wang et al., 2023; Woolway, Kraemer, et al., 2020), driven by climate change.
    Specifically, changes in meteorological conditions (e.g., air temperature) are
    the most closely associated with those observed in lakes. Based on lake model
    projections, the anticipated evolution of climate change under various Representative
    Concentration Pathways (RCPs) suggests that the current trajectory will persist
    in the coming decades. This is true when considering the most optimistic future
    emission scenarios (e.g., RCP2.6), and it can be even worse under moderate to
    severe future emission scenarios (e.g., RCP4.5 and RCP8.5) (Golub et al., 2022;
    Kraemer et al., 2021; Maberly et al., 2020; Merz et al., 2023; Piccolroaz, Zhu,
    et al., 2021; Woolway, 2023; Woolway, Jennings, et al., 2021). Shifts in lake
    thermal regimes can have extensive and potentially profound impacts on lake ecosystems.
    Shorter winters (e.g., ice cover) and an earlier onset and strengthening of summer
    stratification are projected to occur this century (see e.g., Anderson et al.,
    2021; Fenocchi et al., 2018; Mullin et al., 2020; Piccolroaz, Zhu, et al., 2021;
    Shatwell et al., 2019; Woolway, Sharma, et al., 2021; Xue et al., 2022). These
    are expected to be accompanied by a reduction of lake turnovers and eventual mixing
    regime shifts (Shatwell et al., 2019; Woolway & Merchant, 2019; Wood et al., 2023),
    which can generate complex physical, chemical, and biological feedback mechanisms
    and modify the lake ecosystem functioning (Mesman et al., 2021). Deep mixing in
    lakes is crucial for redistributing nutrients throughout the water column, maintaining
    oxygen levels in deep layers and preventing a deoxygenation of bottom waters which
    pose a threat to aquatic fauna and can facilitate the release of phosphorus from
    lake sediments (Hupfer & Lewandowski, 2008). The progressive warming, depletion
    of dissolved oxygen, and increase of nutrient concentrations in deep layers have
    already been observed in numerous lakes worldwide. In many cases, these factors
    occur simultaneously, posing significant challenges to lake ecosystems (see e.g.,
    Jane et al., 2023; Kong et al., 2023; North et al., 2014; Rempfer et al., 2010;
    Straile et al., 2003) and highlighting the importance of conducting further research
    in the field of lake thermal dynamics and regimes. Water temperature is one of
    the most commonly used indicators to assess the impact of climate change on the
    physical and ecological functioning of lakes. Indeed, water temperature is one
    of the most widely monitored physical characteristic of lakes. Most lake temperature
    records start during the second half of the 20th century or in the 21st century,
    although for some lakes regular measurements of water temperatures are available
    for even a longer period (see e.g., some Austrian lakes, Dokulil et al., 2006;
    Livingstone & Dokulil, 2001; some lakes in the English Lake District, Feuchtmayr
    et al., 2012; Lake Peipsi in Estonia/Russia, Kangur et al., 2020, 2021; Lake Mendota
    in the USA Robertson, 2016; see also Pilla et al., 2021). The relatively large
    availability of lake water temperature observations is due to both (a) the relative
    ease and affordability of acquiring this type of measurement and (b) the central
    role of water temperature in controlling most of the physical and bio-chemical
    processes in a lake (Mollema & Antonellini, 2016; Woolway, Kraemer, et al., 2020).
    It is sufficient to cite that water temperature is at the basis of the classification
    of lakes'' mixing regimes starting from the seminal contribution by Hutchinson
    and Löffler (1956) and its revised version by (W. M. Lewis, 1983) until more recent
    classifications (Kirillin & Shatwell, 2016; Yang et al., 2021). As such, water
    temperature is increasingly used as one of the main indicators to quantify and
    communicate the impact of climate change on inland water bodies. Technological
    advancements have made temperature monitoring more efficient and accurate through
    (a) increasing availability of remote sensing data starting from the 1980s and
    their use for lakes (Carrea, Crétaux, et al., 2022; Layden et al., 2015; Merchant
    & MacCallum, 2018; Schneider & Hook, 2010; Schneider et al., 2019), with improving
    sensors (higher stability, better traceability chain (Smith et al., 2021), and
    finer spatial/temporal resolution) and refined retrieval techniques tracking uncertainties
    from the thermal noise of the instrument to the uncertainty in the retrieval (Carrea,
    Crétaux, et al., 2023), (b) easier access to low-cost sensors that promoted the
    building of self-made systems for in situ monitoring (Demetillo et al., 2019;
    Marcé et al., 2016), and (c) general improvement of the sensors'' performance
    and accuracy (Sommer et al., 2013; Van Haren et al., 2001). Parallel to this,
    new types of instruments have been produced and are increasingly used as for example,
    turbulence microprofilers (Piccolroaz, Fernández-Castro, et al., 2021; Sepúlveda
    Steiner et al., 2021), autonomous profilers (Rainville & Pinkel, 2001; Ward et
    al., 2014), underwater gliders (Austin, 2013; Sepúlveda Steiner et al., 2023)
    and fiber-optics (Duraibabu et al., 2017; Selker et al., 2006), thus allowing
    a larger spectrum of possible monitoring applications. Accordingly, lake water
    temperature data are of different types, in terms of measurement technique (in
    situ sampling vs. remote sensing), temporal resolution (periodic or spot samplings
    data vs. continuous data) and spatial coverage (point data vs. maps passing through
    profiles and transects). Exploring the dynamics of water temperature is highly
    beneficial for understanding past and current states of lakes and forecasting
    the possible trajectories lakes may take in the future. Mathematical models play
    a crucial and powerful role in projecting the impact of climate change on future
    lake mixing and thermal dynamics. Thanks to the increasing availability of data
    and progress in computational technology, the limnological community contributed
    to the development and application of a number of water temperature models. Figure
    1a reports the number of scientific publications from 1960 to 2022 containing
    the term “lake*” (L) and those containing also the terms “model*” or “simulation”
    (L + M) in title, abstract and keywords (* being a truncation wildcard operator;
    right y-axis). Among the latter group we identified those also containing the
    terms “temperature” (L + M + T, bars in the left y-axis) and “climate change”
    or “climatic change” (L + M + T + CC, inner bars in the left y-axis). The scientific
    production was limited before the 1960s, after which it underwent an exponential
    trend with a marked increase after mid of 2000s. The fraction of lake studies
    (L) containing the search words “model*” or “simulation” (L + M) shows a clear
    boost in the early 1970s, consistent with the introduction of the personal computer
    and the progress in high-performance scientific computing, followed by a steady
    increase (Figure 1b). In 2022 about one third of L studies included the terms
    “model*” or “simulation”. A similar trend has been observed in the closely related
    field of integrated water resource assessment and modeling, as reported by Zare
    et al. (2017). The fraction of L + M studies containing the search word “temperature”
    (L + M + T) was constantly around 15% (Figure 1c), with a small decline down to
    ∼10% around 1980s followed by a steady increase up to 20% in the last decade.
    The publications that also contain the search terms “climate change” or “climatic
    change” (L + M + T + CC) first appeared in 1987 and become more widespread after
    the 1990s, consistent with the timeline of climate change mitigation and adaptation
    summits (Figure 1a). Since then, the percentage of these studies relative to the
    lake temperature modeling studies (L + M + T) has been steadily increased up to
    more than 20% in recent years (Figure 1d). Figure 1 Open in figure viewer PowerPoint
    (a) Number of articles published per year from 1960 to 2022 containing the term
    “lake*” (L) or the terms “lake*” (L) and “model*” or “simulation” (M) in title,
    abstract and keywords, with a specific focus on those also containing the terms
    “temperature” (T) and “climate change” or “climatic change” (CC). The milestones
    in climate change mitigation and adaptation summits are also reported, including
    the establishment of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), the
    United Nations (UN) Earth Summit, and various climate protocols and agreements.
    The percentages of articles dealing with modeling (L + M) relative to all lake
    studies (L), modeling lake temperature (L + M + T) relative to all lake modeling
    studies (L + M), and lake temperature modeling and climate change (L + M + T +
    CC) relative to all the lake temperature modeling studies (L + M + T) is also
    reported in subplots (b), (c), and (d). Source: Scopus, 19 April 2023. The available
    modeling studies span a wide range of applications (see e.g., T. Jia et al. (2022)
    for a recent review) from the hindcast of historical lake water temperature conditions
    (Hegerl et al., 2018; Piccolroaz et al., 2020) to the forecast of lake water temperature
    over seasonal (Mercado-Bettín et al., 2021) to climatological time scales (Golub
    et al., 2022). Indeed, depending on the type of model, water temperature simulations
    can cover different extents (local vs. global lakes), refer to different temporal
    scales (from daily to climatological time scales) and account for various spatial
    dimensions (from zero-dimensional lake surface water temperature (LSWT) models
    to fully three-dimensional hydro-thermodynamic models). In this contribution,
    we review lake water temperature models, and summarize their advantages and limitations
    and the data sources required to drive them. Here, we distinguish between (a)
    models used to predict LSWT, which is increasingly used as an indicator of global
    warming, and (b) models to reproduce the vertical distribution of lake water temperature
    that describe vertical stratification and mixing, with a particular focus on one-dimensional
    (1D) models. In Section 2, we discuss the physics regulating thermal dynamics
    in lakes as a primer for the description of physical or process-based models.
    In Section 3, we provide an overview of the different sources of observational
    water temperature data used in the field of lake water temperature modeling. The
    classification and a detailed review of the water temperature models available
    in the literature is provided in Section 6. Model performance and optimization
    methods are discussed in Section 18, whereas emerging modeling approaches are
    examined in Section 21. Finally, the main conclusions are drawn in Section 28.
    2 Heat Budget and Thermodynamics of Lakes Any change in lake water temperature
    is determined by the imbalance in heat gains and losses of the lake, that is,
    by the net heat flux passing through the boundaries between the lake and the surrounding
    environment. The direction and magnitude of the net heat flux change over multiple
    time scales: from daily (day-night cycles), to seasonal (depending on the climatic
    conditions), and climatological (due to long-term trends). Most of the heat fluxes
    occur at the lake surface, between the lake and the overlying atmosphere, and
    are linked with natural processes. However, heat exchanges can also occur below
    the surface (e.g., thermal vents, groundwater-lake interactions) and may be due
    to anthropogenic activities (e.g., sewage inflows, selective withdrawals; see
    Figure 2). The net heat flux passing across the lake boundaries (Hnet, W/m2) can
    be summarized as: (1) that is the combination of net short-wave solar radiation
    (Hs,net), net long-wave radiation emitted from the sky (Ha,net) and from the water
    surface (Hw), sensible (Hc) and latent (He) heat fluxes, and advectived fluxes
    due to precipitation (Hp) and inflows/outflows (Hi/o). The first two terms in
    the equation account for the short-wave and long-wave reflectivities (albedoes)
    of the water, denoted by rs and ra in Figure 2. Specifically, Hs,net and Ha,net
    are calculated as (1 − rs)Hs and (1 − ra)Ha, respectively, where Hs and Ha are
    the incident radiations. We note that in the case of ice-covered lakes, the ice
    acts as insulation between the lake water and the atmosphere and influences surface
    albedo, hence it impacts the thermal dynamics of the lakes (for a more in-depth
    physical review, please refer to Kirillin et al. (2012)). Hereafter, all heat
    flux components (expressed in W/m2) are defined as positive when entering the
    lake (warming). The first three terms are referred to as radiative fluxes, the
    terms He and Hc as turbulent fluxes which depend on wind speed, air-water temperature
    difference, near surface humidity and atmospheric stability, and the last two
    terms as advective fluxes. All the radiative and turbulent fluxes are boundary
    fluxes acting at the water surface, while short-wave radiation penetrates and
    is attenuated through the water column thus acting as a volumetric source of heat
    (Bouffard & Wüest, 2019). We notice that it is a common practice to calculate
    all the heat flux terms in Equation 1 by dividing by the surface area of the lake
    A0, as it is there where most of the heat exchanges occur (Imboden & Wüest, 1995).
    This applies also to the advective heat exchanged with inflows and outflows, which
    can be written as: (2) where ρ is the density of water, cp its heat capacity,
    Qi/o is the inflows/outflows discharge and Ti/o its temperature. Equation 2 provides
    the module of Hi/o, its sign being positive for inflows and negative for outflows.
    The water temperature of outflows can be taken equal to the LSWT for surface outlets,
    and equal to lake water temperature at a given depth for withdrawals or groundwater
    seepage. Groundwater recharge is generally computed assuming that Ti is equal
    to the mean annual air temperature (Winter et al., 2003). We note that if the
    effect of inflows and outflows is included in the heat budget, the volume balance
    of the lake must be solved as well, unless it is reasonable to assume that the
    inflows balance the outflows (i.e., Qi = Qo = Q) and the lake does not undergo
    volume changes. In this case, Equation 2 can be used to evaluate the net inflows/outflows
    heat flux as follows: . In many practical applications, advective heat fluxes
    associated with inflows/outflows are neglected (Fukushima et al., 2022; Rahaghi
    et al., 2018), which can be a reasonable assumption for some but, clearly, not
    all large lakes (Raman Vinna et al., 2018), but not for small lakes with short
    residence times primarily controlled by riverine and groundwater exchanges (Carmack,
    1979). This is true also for the heat flux associated with precipitation (Hp),
    although in some cases it can be relevant (Rooney et al., 2018) depending on the
    rainfall intensity and temperature difference between the rain and lake. The term
    Hp is normally quantified by assuming the precipitation temperature to be equivalent
    to the wet bulb temperature at the time precipitation occurred (Sturrock et al.,
    1992). Finally, we note that the sensible heat flux (Hc) term also includes the
    heat flux exchanged by conduction at the water-sediment interface. Although this
    term is generally small due to the low thermal diffusivity of the lake sediments,
    it is important for many lakes, especially for shallow lakes (de la Fuente & Meruane,
    2017), where the ratio of sediment interface-to-lake volume is larger, and in
    ice-covered lakes, where also the heat fluxes across the lake surface are limited
    thus resulting in one of the main drivers for under-ice circulation and mixing
    (Kirillin et al., 2012). On average, the heat transfer is from lake water to bottom
    sediments in summer and from bottom sediments to lake water in winter, thus adding
    significant thermal inertia to the water column (Fang & Stefan, 1996). However,
    this heat exchange is very dynamic and changes direction frequently, particularly
    in transparent shallow lakes and littoral areas where sediments are heated by
    solar radiation directly. In lakes with volcanic or tectonic origins, the water-sediment
    flux is primarily governed by the geothermal heat flux, which can be especially
    relevant (Boehrer et al., 2013; Wood et al., 2023). We refer the interested reader
    to (Schmid & Read, 2022) for a recent overview of the heat budget of lakes, which
    provides a quantitative comparison among the different heat flux components for
    a temperate and a tropical lake (the radiative fluxes being the dominant terms,
    see also Imboden and Wüest (1995)) and contains some selected references to case
    studies that may be of interest to deepen some aspects of the topic. Figure 2
    Open in figure viewer PowerPoint Schematic of the main heat flux components contributing
    to the heat balance of a lake. The subdivision of the lake volume into epilimnion,
    metalimnion and hypolimnion is also shown, assuming an hypothetical temperature
    profile and corresponding Brunt-Väisälä frequency profile. The lake in the schematic
    is inspired by Crater Lake and its Wizard Island (Oregon, USA). The heat flux
    components listed in Equation 1 can be measured directly or calculated using equations
    derived from well-known principles of physics (e.g., the Stefan-Boltzman law for
    the long-wave heat fluxes), fundamental trigonometric principles of astronomy
    (e.g., to calculate extraterrestrial short-wave radiation under clear sky conditions
    and flat topography), or extensively validated empirical relationships (e.g.,
    the Dalton''s law for the evaporative heat flux). Detailed reviews of the most
    established literature parameterizations used to quantify the surface heat fluxes
    can be found in Henderson-Sellers (1986) and J. L. Martin and McCutcheon (1999),
    among others, and a script for calculating the surface energy fluxes according
    to these and other methodologies has been provided by Woolway et al. (2015). Additionally,
    many lake models are published with large sections and appendices describing the
    details of the heat flux equations and the decision trees for their implementation
    (Cole & Wells, 2006; Goudsmit et al., 2002; Hamrick, 1992; Hipsey et al., 2019;
    Piccolroaz et al., 2013). Here, we provide only the key equations that are needed
    for the comprehension of the modeling sections. Following Edinger et al. (1968),
    we refer to the sum of Hs,net and Ha,net as the absorbed radiation, which is independent
    of the surface water temperature Ts, and that can be measured or computed from
    meteorological observations (see e.g., Henderson-Sellers, 1986). All the other
    terms depend in different ways on Ts, air temperature, water vapor pressure, wind
    speed, and other variables as explained below. The emitted long-wave radiation
    Hw is described by the Stefan-Boltzman''s law: (3) where Ts is the surface water
    temperature in °C, T0 = 273.15, ϵw is the emissivity of water (i.e., about 0.97),
    and σ is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant (i.e., 5.67 × 10−8 W m−2 K−4). The minus
    sign indicates that the heat flux is from the lake to the atmosphere. This equation
    can be simplified by taking the Taylor expansion of the above equation around
    the origin and truncating it at the second-order term since Ts ≪ T0, to give:
    (4) The rate of heat loss by evaporation He can be expressed as a simple bulk
    formula: (5) where L is the latent heat of evaporation, the f(W) is a transfer
    function that can be chosen from a wide range of empirical relationships essentially
    depending on the wind speed W, and is the difference between the saturated vapor
    pressure at the surface water temperature and the actual vapor pressure at the
    temperature of the air. Often, this equation is simplified by approximating the
    relationship between the saturation vapor pressure of water and the water temperature
    by a linear function of the form: (6) where Td represents the dew point temperature
    (i.e., the temperature the air needs to be cooled, at constant pressure and constant
    water vapor content, to become saturated with water vapor), and the slope δ of
    the linear approximation can be quantified using observed values of Ts and Td
    and reading values of es and ea from a curve of vapor pressure versus temperature.
    Introducing the Bowen ratio as the ratio between sensible and latent heat fluxes
    where ξ is the psychrometric constant which depends on atmospheric pressure and
    temperature, the heat flux by conduction is given by: (7) By substituting Equations
    3-7 into Equation 1 and neglecting the effects of precipitation, inflows/outflows,
    and water-sediment exchanges, the net heat exchange can be expressed as: (8) This
    is an approximate estimate of Hnet. To obtain the precise quantification of the
    heat fluxes contributing to Hnet, specific coefficients and correction functions
    should be taken into account. For example, atmospheric stability should be considered
    in the estimation of the turbulent fluxes. Ideally, these coefficients and correction
    functions are known, but in practice, they are often case-study-dependent and
    need to be determined through calibration (Rahaghi et al., 2018). One way to do
    this is by writing the heat balance of the lake, which equates the change in time
    of the total heat content of the lake (HC) with the net heat flux exchanged with
    the surrounding environment: (9) where t is time and z is the vertical coordinate,
    T is the water temperature of the lake, V its volume and A0 its surface area.
    If water temperature profiles are available in space and time, Equation 9 can
    be used to tune the calibration parameters included in the different components
    of Hnet (Fukushima et al., 2022; Rahaghi et al., 2018). The same heat balance
    can be used to quantify unknown heat flux components (Sturrock et al., 1992; Winter
    et al., 2003), by relying on measured water temperature profiles to calculate
    HC and on measurements or estimations (using equations with predefined or best
    guess parameters'' values) of the other heat fluxes. When the net heat flux Hnet
    is known, Equation 9 can be used to evaluate the change in time of the HC of the
    lake. Taking V equal to the total volume of the lake, this provides the change
    in time of the average water temperature of the lake Tlake. Likewise, considering
    V equal to the volume of surface well-mixed layer Vs, it is possible to calculate
    the change in time of the average water temperature within this layer, reasonably
    assuming that during the stratified period vertical transfer of heat below the
    thermocline is inhibited (see e.g., Toffolon et al., 2022). In this case, if we
    assume that the heat gain/loss associated to the temporal variation of the volume
    of the surface well-mixed layer is of minor importance, then the volume term can
    be extracted from the time derivative and the change in time of water temperature
    in this layer (Ts) can be expressed as: (10) where Ds = Vs/A0 is the average depth
    of the surface well-mixed layer. This is the reference equation at the basis of
    physically-based zero-dimensional (0D) or half-dimensional (0.5D) lake temperature
    models (see Sections 6 and 14). The spatial variability of water temperature is
    shaped by the transport and mixing processes taking place within the lake, which
    are primarily determined by the fluxes of mechanical energy and by lake morphology.
    Spatial and temporal changes in water temperature are described by the advection-diffusion
    equation for temperature T that, using Einstein summation notation where repeated
    indices imply the summation over all the values of the index (j = 1, 2, 3), reads:
    (11) where ST is a source or sink term for heat production or consumption, uj
    is the jth component of the velocity along the xj direction, D is the molecular
    diffusivity of temperature, and the second term on the left-hand side represents
    the advective term. As all natural water bodies, lakes are turbulent environments,
    where the fine-scale structures of the flow embedded in the advective term of
    Equation 11 generates turbulent mixing that is usually much faster than molecular
    diffusion (Fisher et al., 1979; Imboden & Wüest, 1995). Accounting for turbulence
    explicitly would require solving the equations expressing conservation of mass
    and conservation of momentum (i.e., the Navier-Stokes equation) and the advection-diffusion
    equation on fine computational grids and using small time steps (Direct Numerical
    Simulation—DNS), to an extent that is normally prohibitive for environmental applications.
    A classical way to account for turbulent fluxes in a computationally affordable
    way is through Reynolds'' decomposition, which consists in simplifying the governing
    equations by statistically splitting variables such as velocity and temperature
    into a temporal mean component (representative of the mean, large scale advection
    and denoted with an overbar) and a fluctuating term about the mean component (accounting
    for small-scale turbulent fluctuations and denoted with a prime ′). For the generic
    variable f, the Reynolds'' decomposition reads: . By substituting each variable
    in Equation 11 by the sum of the mean and perturbation components and by taking
    the time-average of the resulting equation (we refer to classical fluid mechanics
    books such as e.g., Kundu & Cohen, 2012 for the details), the advection-diffusion
    equation for temperature can be rewritten into: (12) in which the rules and have
    been used. This is the advection-diffusion equation valid for the mean flow and
    accounting for transport of water temperature due to turbulent mixing through
    the non-linear term . The unknown higher-order correlations between fluctuating
    velocity and temperature introduced by this term can be approximated using lower-order
    closure schemes. The simplest approach is the use of a first-order local closure
    scheme according to the so-called eddy formulation where the turbulent flux of
    temperature is modeled as being proportional to the local gradient of the mean
    temperature through a positive coefficient called eddy diffusion of temperature:
    (13) From this it follows that the turbulent fluxes of temperature, as well as
    of any other scalar property, flows down the local gradient of the mean temperature,
    analogous to molecular transport (see Fick''s first law). Since the eddy diffusivity
    is typically much larger than its molecular counterpart, the eddy formulation
    allows to transform Equation 12 by neglecting molecular diffusion (but assuming
    it as the lower bound of , that is ) into: (14) To solve this equation, the associated
    flow field is required to quantify the advective heat exchanges and determine
    the eddy diffusivity of temperature. This can be done by solving the three- or
    two-dimensional (3D or 2D) conservation of mass and momentum equations or, in
    many practical applications, through reducing the problem to a 1D diffusion equation
    along the vertical direction, neglecting advective fluxes and introducing empirical
    algebraic models to describe eddy diffusivity and vertical mixing (see Sections
    15 and 16, respectively). 3 Water Temperature Monitoring Approaches Water temperature
    is one of the most widely monitored characteristic of lakes. Typically water temperature
    is routinely measured by various governmental agencies, universities and companies
    in thousands of lakes around the world. Water temperature records, however, are
    different in terms of type of collected data and the instruments used to collect
    them. As a first level classification, we can distinguish between in situ monitoring
    and remote sensing and then between manual and automatic measurements. Depending
    on the considered monitoring methodology, the spatial, temporal, and temperature
    resolutions can be different and, in general, can span different orders of magnitudes.
    Furthermore, the spatial and temporal coverage generally differ significantly.
    In this section, we present the main monitoring methodologies (Figure 3). Figure
    3 Open in figure viewer PowerPoint Overview of the main methodologies used to
    collect water temperature data in a lake. 3.1 In Situ Monitoring Systematic records
    of water temperature began in the 20th century (see e.g., Kangur et al., 2021;
    Livingstone & Dokulil, 2001). Historically these measurements were collected manually
    using mercury thermometers directly immersed (a) in the lake surface water to
    measure LSWT or (b) in water samples collected at depth and brought up to the
    boat deck (e.g., Hampton et al., 2008) or using reversing thermometers integrated
    in sampling bottles (e.g., Leoni et al., 2019) when collecting water temperature
    profiles. Historical LSWT records were often collected relatively close to the
    shore (e.g., Gerten & Adrian, 2000; McCormick & Fahnenstiel, 1999) and sometimes
    in river outlets just downstream of a lake (e.g., Austin & Colman, 2007), while
    full water temperature profiles were typically taken in the deepest point of a
    lake (e.g., Rimet et al., 2020; Salmaso et al., 2014). In order to ensure continuity
    and homogeneity of observations, the historical monitoring points have been typically
    kept unchanged throughout time. According to the global data sets and relative
    methodological details published by Sharma et al. (2015) for LSWT and Pilla et
    al. (2021) for water temperature profiles, manual sampling was typically scheduled
    in the morning and in the early afternoon, with a time frequency that ranged from
    daily to monthly with sporadic cases in which water temperature was sampled twice
    daily, in the morning and in the evening (Noges & Noges, 2014). Due to technological
    and automation advancements, mercury thermometers have been progressively replaced
    by digital thermometers and/or multi-parametric probes, and manual sampling replaced
    by automatic sampling using buoys equipped with surface sensors (e.g., Austin
    & Colman, 2007) or moored stations equipped with thermistor chains providing water
    temperature measurements at discrete depths (Tiberti et al., 2021; Valerio et
    al., 2012). In some cases, these moored stations are real floating laboratories,
    providing space for laboratory equipment and personnel (see Wüest et al., 2021
    that details the LéXPLORE platform on Lake Geneva and a list of other lake platforms).
    The introduction of a new generation of temperature sensors in place of mercury
    thermometers significantly improved the resolution of the measurements (from O(0.1)
    K Niedrist et al., 2018) to O(0.1) mK (Van Haren et al., 2005)) and the automation
    of the monitoring stations increased the sampling frequency. In this case, more
    than reporting on the wide spectrum of possible sampling frequencies that are
    available nowadays (up to 1,024 Hz for microstructure purposes, see e.g., Kolås
    et al. (2022), but the choice is dependent on the compromise between desired resolution
    of the final data set and available storage capacity), it is probably more relevant
    commenting on the advantages introduced by automated stations in terms of limiting
    the well-recognized influence of weather conditions on the availability/quality
    of the final measurements. On the one hand manual measurements suffer from the
    so-called “fair weather bias,” where manual sampling is avoided or impossible
    in bad weather conditions, and on the other hand the quality and accuracy of these
    measurements, when their acquisition is logistically possible, are affected by
    the weather conditions (Rand et al., 2022). However, it should be noted that the
    availability of continuous, automatic in situ monitoring can be affected by the
    presence of harsh weather/climate conditions: a clear example is the removal of
    surface buoys from the Laurentian Great Lakes when they freeze in winter to avoid
    risk of damage by ice (e.g., Van Cleave et al., 2014). Automatic monitoring also
    allowed for installing networks of sensors within a lake (e.g., Hart & Martinez,
    2006; Meinson et al., 2016) or in different lakes of a region (e.g., Vitale et
    al., 2018), generating spatially distributed in situ data to an extent that was
    improbable using manual sampling alone. However, it should be recognized that
    earlier examples of distributed monitoring based on manual sampling are available
    even for large lakes (see e.g., Izmest''eva et al., 2016 for a network of 79 stations
    sampled ca. annually from 1977 to 2003 in Lake Baikal, Russia). Despite the advent
    of automatic measurements, manual monitoring has not been disappearing and, in
    many cases, it is still the only source of observations. Manual monitoring is
    routinely performed with CTD or multiparametric probes for research and quality
    control purposes. Besides routine measurements, typical manual monitoring activities
    include the acquisition of high frequency temperature microstructure profiles
    for turbulence analysis (e.g., Macintyre et al., 2021), which can also be used
    for investigating specific physical (e.g., Piccolroaz et al., 2019) and biological
    processes (e.g., Sepúlveda Steiner et al., 2019). It should be noted that in recent
    years there were attempts to alleviate the operational burden associated with
    taking this type of measurements, through the development of automatic microstructure
    profilers either (a) propelled by the action of waves and moving vertically along
    a wire (Pinkel et al., 2011) or (b) propelled by internal-battery-powered thrusters
    and free to drift (see e.g., the Argo float program, Roemmich & Owens, 2000 or
    the ASIP—Air-Sea Interaction Profiler, Ward et al., 2014) that have been used
    in the ocean. Buoyancy-driven Autonomous Underwater Vehicles (AUVs; also called
    gliders) were also traditionally developed for application in the oceans, but
    their limnological applications are increasing, particularly in large lakes as
    such as Lake Superior (Austin, 2012, 2013), Lake Tahoe (McInerney et al., 2019),
    and Lake Geneva (Sepúlveda Steiner et al., 2023). Gliders allow for repeated observations
    covering long distances over periods from days to weeks. These instruments are
    typically operated in “yo-yo” mode, conducting depth/distance transects with a
    time and spatial resolution that are difficult to attain using other manual or
    automatic monitoring techniques. In this respect, the use of gliders is particularly
    promising for the understanding of temperature related processes such as internal
    waves and deep intrusions, thus being particularly useful for the validation of
    2D and 3D lake models. Among the emerging techniques for spatially distributed
    monitoring, we refer to the use of autonomously operating vessels to measure near
    surface water temperatures, and drones and balloons (Uncrewed Aerial Vehicles—UAVs)
    equipped with infrared camera for the observation of lake surface thermography
    (Irani Rahaghi et al., 2019). In the latter case, high resolution maps (∼1 m)
    can be acquired, thus allowing to appreciate LSWT patterns at sub-pixel satellite
    scale (see the next section and Table 1). Table 1. Infrared Sensors and Satellite

    for thermal infrared. 3.2 Satellite Observation of LSWT Records of LSWT based
    on in situ measurements are not always easily accessible, and global-scale in
    situ LSWT observations are rare. This is particularly the case for tropical lakes,
    where compared with temperate and arctic regions, long-term, in situ LSWT data
    sets are scarce. Furthermore, the available in situ data do not provide comprehensive
    coverage of entire lake surface and are limited to point measurements. Additionally,
    there is significant variation in the temporal coverage of data across different
    lakes, making it challenging to conduct global or regional studies with a high
    degree of certainty. In contrast, satellite observations have provided a global
    archive of LSWT in recent decades, oftentimes with several passes per day, with
    progressively higher spatial and temporal resolution in recent years. This invaluable
    data source, which can rectify the latitude bias of in situ LSWT monitoring, allows
    for near-daily observations of LSWT over the full lake, across many lakes worldwide
    consistently for the same period of time, depending, of course, on the availability
    of cloud-free pixels. Indeed, satellite Earth Observation data are critical for
    studying climate change impacts on lakes worldwide by routinely measuring LSWT
    from space. Satellite Earth observations have largely contributed to the availability
    of global lake observations in recent decades (Carrea, Crétaux, et al., 2023;
    MacCallum & Merchant, 2012; Schneider & Hook, 2010), and can be considered a key
    tool for assessing climate change impacts in lakes worldwide. LSWT is defined
    as an Essential Climate Variable (ECV) by the Global Climate Observing System
    (GCOS) (GCOS-244, 2022). To be considered an ECV, a variable must meet three primary
    criteria: (a) that the variable in question is critical for characterizing the
    climate system and its changes; (b) observing and deriving the variable on a global
    scale is technically feasible using proven and scientifically sound methods; and
    (c) generating and archiving data on the variable is affordable, mainly relying
    on coordinated observing systems using proven technology. LSWT meets these criteria,
    largely owing to recent developments in satellite technology and processing methods,
    which have made the characterization of LSWT from space more comprehensive and
    quantitatively robust, overcoming the lack of a standardization of observations
    that characterizes long-term ground-based observational data. Though satellite
    observations have greatly expanded our ability to monitor lake temperature across
    the globe, it is not without challenges. Efforts investigating lake responses
    to climatic variations need to be grounded in a sustainable and systematic way.
    Lake water temperature is measured from satellite by an instrument called a radiometer,
    but not directly. The quantity measured by the radiometer is the radiant flux
    (energy emitted per unit time) emitted by the surface of the lake water per unit
    solid angle and unit projected area. This quantity is called radiance and the
    temperature is then inferred through mathematical inversion (Rodgers, 2000). To
    retrieve LSWT, radiances are measured for frequency bands in the infrared (but
    also microwave) region of the electromagnetic spectrum. In these frequency bands,
    the atmosphere is almost transparent and when no clouds are present, the radiances
    measured by the satellite are related to the energy emitted by the surface water
    and ultimately to the temperature of the water. Using an infrared radiometer operating
    at wavelengths across 3.7–12 μm, the water temperature is sensed at a depth of
    10–20 μm, depending on the local energy flux through the surface of the water.
    This depth is within the so-called “skin layer.” This skin layer is the molecular
    boundary between a turbulent water surface and a turbulent atmosphere. Below the
    skin layer, water temperatures then transition to what is commonly referred to
    as the “bulk” temperature. This bulk layer temperature is comparable to that measured
    conventionally using floating thermometers or instruments mounted on in situ monitoring
    stations. The bulk temperature is consistently warmer than the skin temperature,
    typically by a few tenths of a degree, but the difference between the two can
    also be much higher (Hondzo et al., 2022; Hook et al., 2003; Wilson et al., 2013).
    This temperature difference between the skin and bulk temperature is commonly
    known as the cool skin effect (Fairall et al., 1996; Minnett et al., 2011), the
    magnitude of which is influenced by the air-water surface heat fluxes (Hondzo
    et al., 2022; Wilson et al., 2013). The cool skin effect also varies considerably
    at diurnal timescales (Hook et al., 2003). In brief, nighttime skin temperature
    retrievals are considered to provide better accuracy than daytime data when compared
    with bulk temperatures due to, among other things, the absence of solar heating
    (Hook et al., 2003). At depths of a meter or more below the lake surface a bulk
    temperature measurement can differ from the skin layer by a few degrees Celsius,
    depending on the depth and variability of the diurnal mixed layer (Imberger, 1985).
    Although the cool skin effect in lakes leads to oftentimes noticeable differences
    between bulk temperatures and those measured from satellite Earth observations,
    skin surface temperatures are nonetheless tightly coupled to temporal variations
    in bulk lake surface temperature, particularly over long timescales. In turn,
    these global observations have been used extensively to observe climate change
    signals in lakes. For several decades, satellite Earth observation have provided
    continuous data for observing spatial and temporal variations of LSWT worldwide
    (see Table 1 and T. Jia et al., 2022 for a recent review). Most studies have been
    based on moderate spatial resolution high radiometric quality meteorological sensors,
    with a pixel size of approximately 1 km, including MODerate resolution Imaging
    Spectroradiometer (MODIS), Along Track Scanning Radiometer (ATSR), and Sea and
    Land Surface Temperature Radiometer (SLSTR), at up to daily time scales (Carrea,
    Crétaux, et al., 2023; MacCallum & Merchant, 2012; Reinart & Reinhold, 2008; Schneider
    et al., 2009). These have been heavily relied upon to estimate LSWT in recent
    years, as well as to investigate lake responses to climate change. However, their
    application to small sized lakes is limited due to their relatively moderate spatial
    resolution, resulting in most global scale studies being restricted to the largest
    lakes of the world (Carrea, Crétaux, et al., 2023; MacCallum & Merchant, 2012;
    Schneider & Hook, 2010). In contrast, Landsat satellites could provide useful
    information of LSWT for both large and small lakes worldwide. The strength of
    Landsat includes its high spatial and radiometric resolution, and long-term continuous
    record. However, the 16-day revisit time, which can be longer due to cloud cover,
    limits the applicability of Landsat for tracking sub-seasonal patterns in surface
    water temperature. This can be particularly problematic for some parts of the
    world where cloud cover is common (see Figure 4 and relative discussion below),
    thus limiting the reliability of estimated changes in LSWT. Furthermore, Landsat
    offers two infrared channels only from Landsat 8 onwards in the series, which
    do observe at 100 m resolution. However, currently no mature LSWT method or product
    of the accuracy required by users for climate related purposes (of order 0.5 K
    or better; GCOS-245, 2022; Schaeffer et al., 2018) is available for Landsat data.
    Future developments are aiming to improve high resolution LSWT retrievals. Figure
    4 Open in figure viewer PowerPoint (a) Number of days when a lake surface water
    temperature (LSWT) observation at the lake center (as defined in Carrea et al.
    (2015)) is present in the timeseries over the 1995–2022 period in the European
    Space Agency-Climate Change Initiative Lakes LSWT data set v2.0.2 (Carrea, Crétaux,
    et al., 2022) extended for the European Union Copernicus Climate Change Service
    (Carrea et al., 2020). Note that the number of days in the period 1995–2022 with
    satellite coverage over the 2024 lakes is 9,757. Observations associated to quality
    level 1 (bad data) have been discarded as they should never be used. (b) Fraction
    of daytime LSWT of quality levels 4 and 5 in relation to the total number of available
    observations (quality levels ≥2) shown in subplot (a). LSWTs of quality levels
    4 and 5 are the only ones which should be safely used. (c) LSWT trend for 1976
    lakes calculated over the 1995–2022 period. Note that to avoid overlapping in
    high density areas, the dot has been plotted at the latitude of the lake center
    but the longitude has been shifted. Some of the first studies investigating the
    impact of climate change on global LSWT via satellite Earth observation focused
    on a central within-lake region (Schneider & Hook, 2010). This central region,
    often defined relative to a maximum distance from land and based on 3 × 3 arrays
    of ∼1 km2, was chosen to provide a balance between sampling a relatively large
    surface area and conservatively avoiding any potential bias by including shoreline
    pixels, which would result in contamination of the LSWT retrieval. Subsequent
    studies that were able to investigate spatially resolved LSWT, and provide pixel-based
    information, calculated both average LSWT (i.e., averages across all pixels within
    a water body) (MacCallum & Merchant, 2012; Woolway & Merchant, 2017) and within-lake
    thermal patterns, as well as their responses to climate change (Calamita et al.,
    2021; Mason et al., 2016; Woolway & Merchant, 2018; Zhong et al., 2016). Specifically,
    studies that have investigated spatially resolved observations of LSWT demonstrated
    considerable within-lake warming patterns, with warming rates often differing
    at sub-basin scales (Kraemer et al., 2015; Mason et al., 2016; Zhong et al., 2016).
    The Laurentian Great Lakes, for example, show clear intra-lake warming patterns,
    often associated with shortening winter ice cover as well as other geophysical
    factors, such as bathymetry (Calamita et al., 2021; Mason et al., 2016; Toffolon
    et al., 2020; Zhong et al., 2016). In particular, higher summer warming rates
    have been reported over the deepest parts of the Laurentian Great Lakes. Similar
    responses have also been reported in other lakes throughout the Northern Hemisphere
    (Woolway & Merchant, 2018). Such analyses of spatially resolved LSWTs have been
    pivotal in improving our understanding of within-lake thermal responses to climate
    change and the underlying mechanisms. LSWT from satellite and measured on-site
    are used in climate reports, such as the State of the Climate Report released
    every year by the Bulletin of the American Society (see for example Carrea, Merchant,
    et al., 2023), where the lake-average warm-season temperature anomalies of the
    year are reported in the context of the anomalies across the full extension in
    time of the satellite data record. Satellites provide consistent data in space
    and time, which allow us to understand where water bodies are more drastically
    impacted by global climate change. The latest published version of LSWT data set
    (Carrea et al., 2020; Carrea, Crétaux, et al., 2022; Carrea, Crétaux, et al.,
    2023; Carrea, Merchant, et al., 2023) from satellites is currently provided for
    a period of 25 years (with harmonisation across different instruments), with regular
    updates aiming to increase the temporal coverage of the record, and with future
    releases that will include improvements of the data set/coverage. The LSWTs of
    2,024 lakes (selected within the European Space Agency-ESA Climate Change Initiative-CCI
    project, Carrea, Merchant, & Simis, 2022) are available at a spatial resolution
    of about 1 km, on regular grid, with an estimation of the uncertainty and a confidence
    level (quality level), and they are validated against in situ data. The LSWT data
    set has been created utilising only daytime imagery as it was coupled with a threshold-based
    water detection algorithm that does not rely on a solid prior to classify water/non-water
    pixels. The time resolution and spatial coverage of satellite data depends, among
    other factors, on the cloud/ice cover, since radiances that are affected by clouds/ice
    differ from clear-sky radiances (Merchant et al., 2019). Figure 4a illustrates
    the total number of available observations at the lake centre (Carrea et al.,
    2015), which exclude LSWT measurements at a quality level equal to 1 and days
    without LSWT values due to various factors such as cloud cover, ice cover, polar
    night, among others. We note that we excluded quality level 1 (bad data) from
    the count as they should never be used (Carrea, Crétaux, et al., 2023). The tropical
    area is known to be affected by clouds, as confirmed by the figure, which clearly
    shows that data availability for lakes located at equatorial latitudes is lower
    in comparison to other regions. A low number of days with observations is appreciable
    also in the Arctics, which is primarily attributed to polar nights, which restrict
    LSWT daytime observations, and ice cover. Likewise, the frequency of observations
    decreases towards higher latitudes and in the Tibetan Plateau due to ice cover,
    while in Australia because the selected lakes are very likely experiencing drying
    out conditions. Figure 4b shows the fraction of LSWT with good/best quality levels,
    specifically quality levels 4 and 5, recommended for climate applications, for
    each lake with respect to the total number of available observations reported
    in Figure 4a. The map clearly indicates that the tropics have the lowest fraction
    of observations of good quality, primarily due to factors such as thin clouds
    and high density of low water vapor, which make the retrieval of LSWT more complex.
    Despite the inherent data gaps in satellite observations, they remain highly valuable
    for describing where climate change is currently impacting water bodies most substantially.
    This is primarily due to the consistent global coverage provided by a limited
    number of instruments, whose characteristics are well-known and closely monitored
    during their orbital operation. Figure 4c shows LSWT trends computed from 1995
    to 2022 of the lake-average warm-season LSWT anomalies. The warm season is defined
    as July-August-September for the northern hemisphere, January-February-March for
    the southern hemisphere and the whole year for the tropics (region between the
    ±23.5 parallels). Only the acceptable/best quality levels LSWT data have been
    used to compute the trends for 1978 lakes (out of the ESA CCI 2024 for which a
    sufficient number of observations was available). From Figure 4c it can be clearly
    seen that lakes in southern and eastern Europe, in the Middle East, eastern China,
    and in some regions in the Arctics are warming faster than the lakes in the other
    regions. Overall, the majority of lakes, approximately 85%, exhibit a warming
    trend. However, there are a few regions, particularly in the southern hemisphere
    and in Central Asia, where this warming pattern is less prevalent. Satellite Earth
    observation data are also often used to validate LSWT simulations in climate change
    assessments. For example, satellite-derived LSWTs have been used to validate lake
    models, which were then applied in the analysis of seasonal cycles (Maberly et
    al., 2020), the onset of summer stratification and overturning behavior (Fichot
    et al., 2019; Woolway, Jennings, et al., 2021), and climate-induced alterations
    in lake mixing regimes (Woolway & Merchant, 2019). However, it''s important to
    note that if the error in satellite-derived surface temperatures (e.g., Schaeffer
    et al., 2018) is greater than the predictive error from models, then satellite
    Earth observations are less useful for validating simulations (e.g., Willard,
    Read, et al., 2022). 4 Classification of Lake Temperature Models For many decades,
    two major types of models have been used to simulate lake temperatures: statistical
    models based on regressions, and deterministic models. More recently, two other
    groups of models have been developed, namely machine learning (ML) models, and
    hybrid models that combine statistical or ML approaches with process-based approaches.
    These different models can be represented on a two-dimensional plane, where one
    axis measures the amount of data needed to run a model and the other measures
    the scientific knowledge required to represent the underlying processes (see Figure
    5, modified from Karpatne et al. (2017)). The combination of statistical and ML
    models belongs to the realm of data-driven models, which directly distill critical
    information from data sets to elucidate system behavior and relationships among
    variables. Conversely, deterministic models require the formulation of first principles
    and relationships among variables, according to empirically or theoretically derived
    laws. When scientific knowledge is limited, deterministic models may require simplifying
    assumptions that can reduce their performance and make it difficult to interpret
    the results. Similarly, when data are scarce, data science models may struggle
    to learn as well as extrapolate from the data, and identify relationships among
    variables. In this regard, hybrid models combine the available sources of information,
    leveraging available data while being grounded on the underlying scientific knowledge
    (Karpatne et al., 2017). Figure 5 Open in figure viewer PowerPoint Classification
    of lake temperature models based on model type and scientific knowledge versus
    data information requirements (adapted from Karpatne et al. (2017)). Statistical
    models have the advantages of being simple and generally requiring little data
    for their use. These models provide mathematical relationships between forcing
    variables and the target variable (water temperature), without inferring the mechanistic
    connections among them. For this reason, their performance is highly dependent
    on the case study and quality of data at hand, and their use may be questionable
    when applied with input variables going beyond the limits used for model calibration,
    as for example, in climate changes studies (Piccolroaz et al., 2018) or when extreme
    events are of interest (Jankowski et al., 2006; Shinohara et al., 2023). These
    models require little or no scientific knowledge about the simulated processes,
    making them accessible to a wider range of users. The boundary between statistical
    models and ML is a topic of current debate (see e.g., Bzdok, 2017; Bzdok et al.,
    2018; Wikle & Zammit-Mangion, 2023), and one may consider the two types of models
    belonging to the same macro-group. The main difference between classical statistics
    and ML methods can be found in the degree of automation (which is lower for statistical
    models), complexity, and in the number of assumptions that are needed to solve
    a problem (which is higher for statistical models). Deep learning methods are
    generally regarded as a subset of ML, and have been combined with both statistical
    models (Shlezinger et al., 2023; Wikle & Zammit-Mangion, 2023) and physical models
    (Read et al., 2019; Reichstein et al., 2019; Y. Zhu et al., 2023). Deep learning
    models have limited assumptions on the data and processes that are to be modeled,
    and can use a large amount of information. However, they cannot be treated as
    a panacea for solving any task, as they can learn spurious relationships and make
    bad predictions outside of observed conditions, can demand a lot of computational
    resources (Menghani, 2023), and can sometimes be less accurate than process-based
    or simpler statistical models (Gamage & Samarabandu, 2020; Korbmacher & Todeaux,
    2022; Rajula et al., 2020; H. Zhao et al., 2022). Deterministic models, also referred
    to as mechanistic, process-based or theory-based models (see e.g., Soares and
    do Carmo Calijuri, 2021) simulate the fundamental processes relevant for lake
    water temperature, including the accurate quantification of the different energy
    fluxes involved. The development of these conceptual models requires an understanding
    of the fundamental processes involved and the ability to represent them mathematically.
    Depending on the complexity of the processes involved, these models may require
    a significant amount of diverse data for their proper functioning, which may not
    always be available with sufficient spatial and temporal coverage. Hybrid models
    are somewhat in between process-based and statistical models (in its wider sense,
    including classical statistics, statistical learning, data-driven optimization,
    up to deep learning). These models combine first principle-based models with data-driven
    models into a joint architecture (Kurz et al., 2022) and aim at preserving some
    of the physical realism of process-based models, while allowing for the flexibility,
    simplicity, and performance of data-driven models. Hybrid models do not necessarily
    use more knowledge or data, but combine the benefits of process-based and statistical
    models, placing them at a level equal to or below the highest data and knowledge
    use scenarios (Figure 5). Models can also be classified according to the number
    of spatial dimensions that they can solve, ranging from zero-dimensional (0D)
    to three-dimensional (3D) models (see Figure 6). The choice of the best model
    to use depends upon the processes that are investigated and the morphological
    characteristics of the lake at hand and is often constrained by the type and quality
    of available data. In this respect, we refer the interested reader to the study
    by Ishikawa et al. (2022) for a detailed comparison among models with different
    dimensions (from 1D to 3D) in relation to their ability in simulating, among others,
    thermal stratification in a medium-sized drinking-water reservoir. Here, we provide
    a description of each category of model along with references to the most relevant
    literature on the topic, with a particular focus on 0D and 1D models passing through
    0.5D models. Figure 6 Open in figure viewer PowerPoint Classification of lake
    temperature models according to the number of spatial dimensions solved. 4.1 0D
    Models 0D models (also termed bulk models) are used for modeling either LSWT or
    the vertically homogeneous water temperature of a lake assuming complete mixing
    throughout the water column (e.g., in shallow lakes). Depending on the spatial
    representativeness of the data used for model calibration, 0D models can be used
    to model spatially-averaged or local lake water temperature. In all cases, this
    category of models does not consider any spatial variability in either horizontal
    or vertical direction. These models generally belong to the category of statistical
    models (e.g., Sharma et al., 2008; Willard, Read, et al., 2022), although there
    are examples of hybrid 0D models (e.g., Bilello, 1964; Kettle et al., 2004). Furthermore,
    since such models are typically designed for the purpose of predicting LSWT, according
    to the notation already introduced in Equation 10, in the following we will denote
    water temperature as Ts. This can be interpreted as the temperature of the surface
    well-mixed layer (i.e., the epilimnion, see Figure 2) normally measured from ships,
    buoys, or moored stations at depths ranging from centimeters to a couple of meters
    below the lake surface (bulk temperature) or as the temperature of the thin surface
    layer on the order of 10 μm generally measured by infrared radiometers (skin temperature;
    see Section 4). 4.1.1 Climatological Models An example of 0D statistical models
    are sinusoidal models fitted to observed data, which are able to capture LSWT
    seasonality and the timing of maximum and minimum temperatures, but limited to
    the climatological mean only, thus neglecting any inter-annual variability. These
    models can be first-order models based on a sine-cosine pair with annual periodicity
    (Flaim et al., 2016) or higher-order models with additional sine-cosine pairs
    characterized by sub-annual periodicity (Minns et al., 2018): (15) where β denotes
    a generic model parameter both here and throughout the rest of the text, DOY refers
    to the day of the year, and n is the number of sine-cosine pairs. Likewise, certain
    authors proposed models founded on the complementary error function erfc (Hutorowicz,
    2020), which take the form: (16) However, one may prefer to consider the climatological
    year obtained by averaging the temperature for each DOY as a better, first-approximation
    model of the water temperature seasonality. Expanding upon these basic models,
    a more sophisticated, yet still simple, statistical 0D model is the three part,
    trapezoidal-like model proposed by Trumpickas et al. (2009) consisting of linear
    warming through the spring, a plateau in mid-summer, and linear cooling in fall.
    Besides being lake-specific, the model parameters are year-specific, allowing
    to determine the relationships between model parameters and climate variables
    (e.g., air temperature). These relationships can be used to draw preliminary climate-change-related
    considerations in the context of expected climate scenarios. 4.1.2 Regression
    Models Moving toward more advanced statistical 0D models, we can refer to statistical
    models that utilize multivariate regressions to establish the correlation between
    water temperature and one or more predictors. These models allow for a deeper
    understanding of the seasonality and inter-annual variability of water temperature.
    A generic multivariate regression model can be represented as: (17) where x1,
    x2, …, xN are the independent variables (the predictors), β0, β1, β2, …, βN are
    the regression coefficients, and ϵ is the error term. Previous studies found that
    water temperature can be effectively explained by utilizing a combination of different
    predictors. The most commonly used predictors include meteorological variables
    like air temperature, dew point temperature, solar radiation, wind speed, wind
    direction and precipitation (Hondzo & Stefan, 1993). Geographical information
    such as latitude, longitude and elevation are additional factors that have been
    considered, particularly when the objective is to set-up a multi-lake modeling
    framework specifically tailored to a specific region (e.g., Bachmann et al., 2019;
    Livingstone et al., 1999; Sabás et al., 2021). Lake morphological variables such
    as lake area, volume, depth, and shape have been shown to be important factors
    affecting water temperature dynamics (e.g., Calamita et al., 2021; Edmundson &
    Mazumder, 2002; Kettle et al., 2004; Toffolon et al., 2014; Woolway et al., 2016),
    and as such have been considered as relevant predictors in several statistical
    models (Edmundson & Mazumder, 2002; Sharma et al., 2008; Shuter et al., 1983;
    Snucins & Gunn, 2000). In accordance with the climate-morphometry-typology hierarchical
    framework, as proposed by Edmundson and Mazumder (2002) to describe the thermal
    properties of Alaskan lakes, another significant set of predictors pertains to
    water quality and chemistry (Rose et al., 2016). These may include parameters
    such as Secchi depth (a measure of water clarity, introduced by Italian priest
    and scientist Pietro Angelo Secchi in the mid-19th century, determined by lowering
    a standard disk into the water until it is no longer visible, then measuring the
    depth at which it disappears), turbidity, water color, and dissolved organic carbon,
    which are examples of parameters frequently employed as predictors in previous
    studies (e.g., Minns et al., 2018; Snucins & Gunn, 2000). A generic multivariate
    regression model can either be linear, where all predictors are assumed to have
    a linear relationship with the response variable, or non-linear, allowing for
    more complex relationships between predictors and the response variable. In some
    cases, quadratic or higher order terms, logarithmic or exponential functions,
    or other transformations of the predictors may also be included in the model (e.g.,
    Minns et al., 2018; Sharma et al., 2008). Many studies, from regional (e.g., Livingstone
    & Lotter, 1998; Woolway, Jennings, & Carrea, 2020) to worldwide (e.g., Schmid
    et al., 2014; S. Wang et al., 2021; Winslow et al., 2018) applications, have consistently
    demonstrated a significant relationship between air and water temperatures. This
    has motivated the development of numerous simple linear regression models that
    utilize air temperature alone to predict water temperature values on a daily (e.g.,
    Bachmann et al., 2019; Matuszek & Shuter, 1996), monthly (e.g., McCombie, 1959),
    and annual (e.g., Shuter et al., 1983) basis, or to predict peak summer temperatures
    (Minns et al., 2018; Sharma et al., 2007). In deep lakes characterized by clear
    hysteresis cycles between air and water temperatures, the impact of the lake''s
    thermal inertia is addressed indirectly by estimating separate seasonal regressions
    of air-water temperature relationships for each branch of the hysteresis loop
    (M. S. Webb, 1974). Alternatively, linear regressions can be used to estimate
    monthly means of surface water temperature from monthly means of measured air
    temperature data (Lathrop et al., 2019; McCombie, 1959). In some cases, linear
    regressions are substituted by non-linear functions such as the logistic function
    that is given by: (18) where Ta is air temperature. This model has been widely
    applied in studies on stream water temperature forecasting (Mohseni & Stefan,
    1999; Piccolroaz et al., 2016; S. Zhu et al., 2018), but has also been applied
    to LSWT forecasting, (Roberts et al., 2017; S. Zhu, Ptak, Choiński, & Wu, 2020;
    S. Zhu, Ptak, Yaseen, et al., 2020). While the logistic model generally offers
    better performance compared to linear regression models for extreme upper and
    lower values, its applicability is reasonably restricted to the case of shallow
    lakes that, similar to rivers, exhibit a small thermal inertia and thus weak (or
    absent) hysteresis cycles between air and water temperatures. 4.1.3 Autoregressive
    Models In some cases, particularly when thermal inertia is high and water temperature
    reacts to air temperature changes with a damped and delayed response, autoregressive
    models that account for the previous predicted values have been used (e.g., Håkanson,
    1996; Kettle et al., 2004; Ottosson & Abrahamsson, 1998; Prats & Danis, 2019).
    For example, to estimate the hypolimnion temperature, Prats and Danis (2019) used
    an autoregressive model based on an exponential smoothing function of the epilimnion
    temperature, which in turn was modeled through an exponential smoothing function
    of air temperature based on the model proposed by Kettle et al. (2004) that is
    presented below (see Hybrid models). In this context, it is worth noting that
    second-order Markov models have been successfully employed for modeling river
    water temperature (Caissie et al., 2001; Cluis, 1972). Although such systems exhibit
    lower thermal inertia than lakes, there is potential for these models to be applicable
    in lake systems. In this type of model, water temperature is represented as the
    sum of two terms. In parallel with the Reynolds notation introduced earlier, these
    two terms can be understood as the mean annual component, denoted as , and a residual
    (or fluctuating) component, denoted as , such that . The mean annual component
    is described by a sinusoidal model of the type shown in Equation 15. The residual
    component is obtained by subtracting the actual water temperatures from the annual
    component, and this series are subsequently used to calibrate a stochastic second-order
    Markov model of the type: (19) where is the residual of air temperature with respect
    to its corresponding annual component evaluated according to a sinusoidal model
    as done for water temperature, and denotes a generic model parameter. More specifically,
    and are related to the autocorrelation coefficients for a lag of Δt and 2Δt, respectively
    (Caissie et al., 2001; Cluis, 1972), where Δt is generally assumed equal to one
    day. 4.1.4 Bayesian Models Bayesian regression models extend standard regression
    models and use Bayes'' theorem to infer the probability distribution of the parameters.
    The posterior distribution is obtained by combining the prior distribution, which
    represents our prior beliefs about the parameters, and the likelihood of the data,
    which represents the probability of obtaining the observed data given the parameter
    values. This approach allows for modeling uncertainty in the parameters and provides
    a probabilistic framework for making predictions. More specifically, the prior
    distribution represents our initial beliefs or guesses about the probability distribution
    of the model parameters before observing any data. The posterior distribution,
    in contrast, incorporates both the prior distribution and the likelihood of the
    data, resulting in an updated probability distribution of the model parameters
    that accounts for both the prior information and the information contained in
    the observed data. In general, probability distributions are built using Monte
    Carlo simulations. Bayesian modeling allows for a hierarchical approach that can
    be applied to analyze complex data structures. This approach is based on a sequential
    procedure with more than one model structure in the hierarchy, allowing for estimation
    of the parameters and prior distributions for each level using the observed data.
    In this way, each model structure builds upon the previous model''s results, incorporating
    informative priors that leverage additional sources of information and enable
    the use of past knowledge in the analysis. As an example, Christianson et al.
    (2019) implemented a sequential procedure with three models in hierarchy to predict
    sub-daily LSWT of high altitude lakes of the Southern Rocky Mountains (U.S.A).
    The first-level model described daily and seasonal variation in LSWT by combining
    sine and cosine functions and a linear term dependent on lake surface area. Here,
    vague priors were employed initially, assuming normal distributions, while in
    subsequent steps the means and covariance results from the previous model were
    utilized for all previously introduced parameters. In the second-level model,
    the effect of elevation was added to account for the wide range of variability
    of the studied lakes. Finally, the third-level model has been built on the second
    one by adding a term dependent on the year and considering an unknown sampling
    time, yielding to the full equation written below: (20) where A0 is lake surface
    area, Elev is the lake elevation, and Year is the year of observation. In this
    case, not only did the complexity of the model increase moving through the hierarchy,
    but the authors also used different data sets with increasingly larger but more
    sparse (i.e., less densely sampled in time and space) observations at each level.
    4.1.5 Machine Learning ML models are now a popular tool for water quality modeling
    (Appling et al., 2022). Studies that used ML for lake temperature modeling can
    be divided into two groups: shallow and deep ML models. The shallow ML models
    used in the literature include artificial neural networks (Di Nunno et al., 2023;
    Heddam et al., 2020; W. C. Liu & Chen, 2012; Saber et al., 2020; S. Zhu, Ptak,
    Yaseen, et al., 2020; S. Zhu et al., 2023), support vector regression (Quan et
    al., 2020), adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system (Yousefi & Toffolon, 2022),
    and decision trees (Heddam et al., 2020; Yousefi & Toffolon, 2022). Most deep
    ML models use recurrent neural networks, for example, long short-term memory (LSTM)
    models (X. Jia et al., 2021; Read et al., 2019; L. Wang et al., 2022; Willard,
    Read, et al., 2022; Yousefi & Toffolon, 2022) to replicate the memory of the thermal
    system. The majority of studies using ML for lake temperature prediction have
    focused on surface predictions (e.g., Di Nunno et al., 2023; Hao et al., 2023;
    Heddam et al., 2020; Quan et al., 2020; Saber et al., 2020; Sharma et al., 2008;
    Yousefi & Toffolon, 2022; Willard, Read, et al., 2022; S. Zhu, Ptak, Yaseen, et
    al., 2020; S. Zhu et al., 2023), but some have also simulated depth-resolved lake
    water temperatures (e.g., Read et al., 2019; Willard et al., 2021). Among these
    studies, Yousefi and Toffolon (2022) compared nine ML models including both shallow
    and deep models for the forecasting of LSWT and evaluated the best input predictors.
    The results showed that none of the nine ML models performed significantly better,
    and that the best input predictors are air temperature and day of the year. The
    analysis also showed that including the air temperature from previous days as
    inputs in the ML models improved prediction performance, as this helped to retain
    the historical context of the forcing conditions. ML has the potential to improve
    modeling of lake water temperature at broad spatial scales through several mechanisms.
    ML models can leverage information across thousands of lakes to improve predictions.
    Willard, Read, et al. (2022) used LSTM-based deep learning to estimate LSWT for
    185,549 lakes in the conterminous United States, and the results showed that a
    global deep learning model substantially improves predictive accuracy compared
    to a prior empirical model and a debiased process-based approach. For temperature
    profiles, Willard et al. (2021) proposed a meta-transfer learning method, which
    predicts transfer performance from candidate source models to unmonitored target
    lakes using lake attributes. This work showed that information from lakes that
    are similar (e.g., similarity in maximum depth) can be successfully transferred
    between well- and unmonitored systems, and that hybrid deep learning and process-based
    models (described in the next paragraph) transferred better than process-based
    models. An additional challenge for broad scale modeling is that process-based
    models often require information about lake characteristics (e.g., bathymetry,
    water clarity) for parameterization that are not known for most lakes. ML techniques
    are flexible where you can exclude certain parameters that are not available at
    large extents. For example, Willard, Read, et al. (2022) did not use depth or
    water clarity despite the known importance in predicting temperature across lakes.
    In fact, ML methods can be used to learn about the lake characteristics themselves
    from the observational temperature data set. For example, LSTM and inversion techniques
    have been combined to build models that can predict both dynamic lake temperatures
    and infer static features of lakes that are important for making temperature predictions
    across lakes (e.g., lake depths; Tayal et al., 2022). 4.1.6 Hybrid Models Hybrid
    0D models generally rely on the fundamental zero-dimensional heat budget Equation
    9. As shown in Equation 10 and the corresponding text, applying this heat balance
    to the well-mixed layer yields the time evolution of the water temperature averaged
    over the corresponding volume. A simplified way to account for the right-hand-side
    of the equation is through assuming that the heat flux is predominantly controlled
    by the sensible heat exchange, so that: (21) where Ta is air temperature, and
    η is a heat exchange coefficient having dimension of inverse time. This simple
    model was first proposed by Rodhe (1952) and has been applied to the Baltic Sea
    to predict the timing of ice formation, which was simply computed as the time
    when the water temperature Ts drops below 0°C. Since then, the same model has
    been used in numerous other locations, as for example, Canadian rivers, lakes,
    and bays (Bilello, 1964), Lake Mendota in USA (Robertson et al., 1992), as well
    as lakes in Greenland (Kettle et al., 2004) and other regions. In this model η
    is constant, therefore the effects of seasonality on the heat exchange coefficient
    and of stratification (i.e., varying volume in Equation 10) are neglected. Equation
    21 can be solved numerically or, as done in the aforementioned works, integrated
    over time, rearranged and solved iteratively (see Rodhe (1952) and Bilello (1964)
    for the mathematical treatment) to obtain: (22) where Δt is the integration time
    interval, normally assumed equal to one day. This equation suggests that if Ta
    is constant in time, the temperature in the surface well-mixed layer Ts tends
    to approach it exponentially. Following Kettle et al. (2004), this equation can
    be rewritten assuming that water temperature is related to air temperature through
    a smoothing function f, such that Ts(t) = f(Ta(t)), yielding to: (23) where is
    a smoothing parameter that has the effect of reducing the variance of air temperature
    and introducing a time delay in the thermal response of the lake. In this way,
    the model includes an autoregression component thus accounting for the thermal
    inertia of the lake. To enhance the model''s applicability to lakes where factors
    beyond the temperature difference between air and water may influence the system,
    an extended version incorporates theoretical short-wave solar radiation Hs as
    an additional component (Kettle et al., 2004): (24) where the term Hs can refer
    to the theoretical clear-sky radiation (see e.g., Annear & Wells, 2007 for an
    overview of models to calculate it), as proposed by the authors, be represented
    as a sinusoidal fit to average daily solar radiation data (Prats & Danis, 2019),
    or be assigned directly based on measured data. The model parameters in Equation
    24 and the smoothing parameter α are specific to each lake and should be calibrated
    by fitting the model to the corresponding observational data. In the study by
    Kettle et al. (2004), scaling relationships were discovered between these model
    parameters and lake area and maximum depth, which led to the creation of a regional
    model for predicting summer LSWT in lakes located in southwest Greenland. 4.1.7
    Equilibrium Temperature Models Edinger et al. (1968) introduced the concept of
    equilibrium temperature Teq, defined as the surface water temperature at which
    the net heat flux Hnet exchanged at the lake''s surface would be zero. The equilibrium
    temperature can be therefore calculated from Equation 1 by setting Hnet to zero,
    substituting Ts with Teq in the heat fluxes terms depending on LSWT, and solving
    for Teq. Before doing so, let us obtain the equation for Hnet by subtracting Equation
    8 in the case when Hnet = 0 and Ts = Teq, from the case when Hnet ≠ 0. This yields:
    (25) where we assumed that since the difference between Teq and Ts is generally
    small for averaging periods larger than daily, it is reasonable to assume δeq
    = δs = δ. This equation can be linearized by neglecting the second term on the
    right-hand-side, usually contributing by less than 10% of the total Hnet (Edinger
    et al., 1968; Eggers & Tetzlaff, 1978), to give: (26) where the heat exchange
    coefficient Keq in this equation is defined by the terms within the square brackets.
    With this definition of Keq, the equilibrium temperature can be computed from
    Equation 8 with Hnet = 0, by setting Ts = Teq and δeq = δ, and neglecting higher
    order terms: (27) In addition, by substituting Equation 26 into Equation 10 for
    the time evolution of Ts in the well-mixed surface layer, one obtains: (28) We
    note that this equation is formally equivalent to Equation 21 and that has the
    same meaning as the coefficient η in that equation. Hence from a mathematical
    point of view the solutions provided in Equation 22 holds true also in this case,
    once Ta and η have been replaced by Teq and ηeq, respectively. However, these
    two equations differ substantially in their physical interpretation, since in
    the latter the heat exchange between a water body and the atmosphere is proportional
    to the difference between LSWT and the equilibrium temperature, rather than the
    difference between LSWT and the air temperature. We note that the equilibrium
    temperature would be the same as the air temperature only if heat were exchanged
    solely through conduction and convection (Hnet = Hc). However, this is usually
    not the case although it is the assumption underlying the model proposed by Rodhe
    (1952), as shown above. LSWT models based on the concept of the equilibrium temperature
    are grounded in the fundamental physical principles that control the lake''s thermodynamics.
    Indeed, solving the system of Equations 27 and 28 corresponds to solving the heat
    budget of a lake, which can be done numerically by considering either constant
    or variable ηeq and Ds through time. However, in some previous applications, the
    problem has been simplified by solving Equation 28 using a sinusoidal function
    to describe Teq, obtained by fitting the values from Equation 27 using a sinusoidal
    regression (which has been proven to explain most of the variance of Teq; Livingstone
    & Imboden, 1989). This approach allowed for gaining insight on the effects of
    meteorological factors on water temperatures (Edinger et al., 1968; Livingstone
    & Imboden, 1989), and for quantifying the average and the amplitude of sub-daily
    LSWT in the form of a simple sine wave (Eggers & Tetzlaff, 1978). In some other
    applications, Teq computed according to Equation 27 or considering other assumptions
    to simplify the heat flux terms has been used as a proxy for LSWT to investigate
    the thermal sensitivity of lakes to changes in meteorological forcing variables
    (Schmid et al., 2014). 4.2 0.5D Models 0.5D models (also termed box models, according
    to the wide literature in ocean science; see e.g., Welander, 1982) are intermediate
    between 0D and 1D models, in that they model water temperature within a time-varying
    upper well-mixed layer, thus allowing for including the effect of stratification
    and vertical mixing. This type of models can be coupled with one underlying layer
    considering it decoupled from the upper well-mixed layer (as e.g., in air2water,
    Piccolroaz et al., 2013) or coupled through simple temperature-depth parameterizations
    (as e.g., in FLake, Mironov et al., 2010). Similar to 0D models, depending on
    the spatial representativeness of the data used for model calibration, 0.5D models
    can be used to model spatially-averaged or local lake water temperature. The air2water
    model is an example of a 0.5D hybrid model for LSWT prediction that combines the
    simplicity and parsimony of statistical models with the high performance of more
    complex deterministic models, thanks to its physically based derivation (Piccolroaz,
    2016; Piccolroaz et al., 2013; Toffolon et al., 2014). The model solves the volume-integrated,
    zero-dimensional heat equation applied to the well-mixed surface volume of the
    lake as described in Equation 10. In this case, the net heat flux Hnet is mathematically
    simplified through linearization using Taylor expansion and with air temperature
    serving as a proxy for the integrated effects of relevant processes and fluxes.
    The result is a simple ordinary differential equation that depends on air temperature,
    LSWT, and model parameters summarizing the main climatic and thermophysical properties
    of the lake. This equation is not fundamentally different from Equation 28 and
    reads: (29) where a1, …, a6 are model parameters and δ = Vs/Vlake = Ds/Dmean is
    the dimensionless depth (or volume) of the well-mixed surface layer relative to
    the lake mean depth Dmean (total volume Vlake). The inclusion of δ provides a
    significant advantage for air2water over purely regressive models. In fact δ is
    described by a time-dependent function that explicitly accounts for the significant
    role of vertical stratification on lake thermal dynamics: (30) where Th is the
    temperature of the hypolimnion (i.e., the deep layer, see Figure 2), which can
    be assumed equal to the minimum (maximum) surface temperature registered during
    the year for warm (cold) monomictic lakes that mix once per year, or equal to
    the temperature of maximum density (temperature of maximum density varies with
    salt content and is approx. 4°C in freshwater lakes at the atmospheric pressure)
    for the case of dimictic lakes that circulate twice a year. Although the definition
    of δ as implemented in the air2water model is empirical, the comparison between
    simulated and observed values of δ for Lakes Constance and Superior showed good
    agreement (Piccolroaz et al., 2015; Toffolon et al., 2014). Furthermore, a recent
    analysis by Toffolon et al. (2022) using a 1D physically-based model confirmed
    that δ decreases exponentially over time. However, the study suggests that a potential
    improvement could be achieved by considering different exponential decay parameters
    for the warming and cooling periods. Similarly, it has been suggested that at
    least for some lakes the model may better follow observations when Th is considered
    to be another model parameter to be calibrated, instead of being fixed as described
    above (Piotrowski et al., 2022). In addition to distinguishing air2water from
    standard regression models, the inclusion of a time-varying δ also allows this
    model to be classified as 0.5D, because it simulates the temporal evolution of
    the epilimnion. Besides the 8-parameter full model, alternative versions of the
    model also exist: one with 6 parameters, where δ equals 1 during inverse stratification
    (i.e., when Ts < Th), and another with 4 parameters where the sinusoidal term
    in Equation 29 is neglected. The first simplification was reasonable in a wide
    range of cases (Piccolroaz et al., 2013), and implies a mild effect of reverse
    stratification (i.e., parameter a7) and the possible insulating effect of ice
    cover (see the fictitious increase of delta through the term depending on parameter
    a8) on the resulting LSWT dynamics. The second simplification is particularly
    reasonable, especially when the air temperature and LSWT cycles are almost sinusoidal,
    in which case the third sinusoidal term would be redundant: the sum of sinusoidal
    functions with the same frequency but different amplitude and phase yields another
    sinusoid with different amplitude and phase but the same frequency. FLake (Freshwater
    Lake model) is another example of a widely used 0.5D lake model capable of predicting
    the vertical temperature structure and mixing conditions in lakes of various depths
    on a time scale from a few hours to many years (Mironov, 2008; Mironov et al.,
    2010). The model is based on two dynamic layers: an upper mixed layer and a thermocline
    layer in which the water temperature is parameterized using the concept of self-similarity
    of the temperature-depth curve, meaning that the characteristic shape of the temperature
    profile is conserved irrespective of the depth of this layer. The model is written
    in terms of potential water temperature Θ that is the temperature a parcel of
    water would have if it were moved adiabatically (i.e., without exchange of heat)
    to a reference pressure, normally at the surface (see e.g., Imboden & Wüest, 1995).
    According to the two-layer parameterization of FLake, the time evolution of the
    potential water temperature profile is given by: (31) where Θ = Θ(z, t), z is
    the vertical coordinate, Θs(t) and Θb(t) are the potential water temperatures
    in the surface well-mixed layer of depth Ds and at the very bottom (i.e., z =
    Dlake), and ϕ(ζ) is the dimensionless “universal” shape function describing the
    self-similar temperature profile in the thermocline. The shape function used in
    the FLake model is a fourth order polynomial in the dimensionless depth and depends
    on a shape coefficient C varying in time to account for the effect of mixed-layer
    deepening, stationary state, or retreat (Mironov, 2008). The same self-similarity
    theory is used to describe the temperature profile of the lake ice, snow, and
    active upper layer of bottom sediments. While this approach relies on “verifiable
    empiricism,” it still incorporates much of the essential physics, thus offering
    a good compromise between physical realism and computational economy (Mironov
    et al., 2010). However, because FLake does not allow for the hypolimnion layer
    below the thermocline, a virtual bottom at 40–60 m is used in simulations, instead
    of the real lake depth (Martynov et al., 2010). In FLake the upper layer is assumed
    to be well mixed and vertically uniform. The depth of this layer (Ds) is dynamically
    parameterized through an entrainment equation for the depth of a convectively
    mixed layer and a relaxation-type equation for the depth of a wind-mixed layer
    in stable and neutral stratification, as well as accounting for volumetric solar
    radiation absorption. The set of equations used in this parameterization along
    with all details for their comprehension can be found in Mironov (2008) and in
    the Appendix of Mironov et al. (2010). We refer interested readers to those previous
    studies for a detailed explanation. Although the FLake model is commonly referred
    to as a bulk model, it is classified as a box model in the classification scheme
    used in this review because the model solves for the time-dependent depth of the
    well-mixed layer. FLake has been implemented within the weather prediction model
    COSMO (Mironov et al., 2010) and coupled in one-way (Gula & Peltier, 2012) and
    two-way (Mallard et al., 2014) model configurations to the Weather Research and
    Forecasting (WRF) model, which demonstrated a good performance with respect to
    the lake surface temperature and to the freeze-up of lakes and the ice break-up.
    The interested reader can refer to the FLake model website (http://www.flake.igb-berlin.de/)
    for downloading the code and for the relevant documentation. 4.3 1D Models 1D
    models (also termed column models) allow the simulation of water temperature vertical
    profiles. 1D models can be applied either at the deepest point of a lake considering
    its hypsometric curve (variable area over depth) or, particularly when the detailed
    bathymetry is not available, on shape assumptions, for example, assuming an equivalent
    cylinder in which lakes have constant area equal to the surface area and depth
    equal to the lake''s mean depth, or a simplified cone if only surface area and
    depth are known. 1D models can be used as lake-averaged or single station models
    depending on the observations used for model calibration (i.e., horizontally averaged
    vs. local). The first case is more appropriate for small and deep lakes where
    lateral variability is less important than the vertical one. In either case, this
    should be explicitly clarified when presenting the results to avoid misinterpretations
    (Henderson-Sellers, 1984). 1D lake models are based on the assumption that mixing
    processes happen rapidly on the horizontal axis, making horizontal density gradients
    negligible. This allows the focus on the vertical axis of the water column for
    transport and mixing processes. Various criteria for the validity of the 1D assumption
    have been proposed. Generally, the 1D assumption requires a mostly stably stratified
    water column which can be validated by calculating the dimensionless Wedderburn
    number or Lake Number (Imberger & Patterson, 1989; Patterson et al., 1984). The
    Lake Number (LN) quantifies the dynamic stability of the water column and is defined
    as the ratio of the momentum of stabilizing forces (resulting from stratification)
    to the momentum of the destabilizing forces due to wind. Long periods characterized
    by LN ≫ 1 can be used as a preliminary basic validation of the 1D model assumption
    (Bruce et al., 2018) (32) where St is the Schmidt stability, β is the angle of
    the metalimnion surface to the lake bottom (that can be approximated as , where
    Dm is the depth of the thermocline and A0 is the lake surface area), u∗ is the
    wind friction velocity, and zv is the center of volume depth. While we refer to
    classical limnological textbooks for the details on the definitions of St and
    zv, we specify that the wind shear velocity u∗ can be quantified as: (33) where
    ρa and ρ are air and water density (in the latter case, the density of the surface
    water), CD is the drag coefficient for momentum, and is wind velocity measured
    at 10 m above the lake surface. Generally, the use of 1D lake models in reservoirs
    is not a common practice, especially when the geometry is intricate and marked
    by a dendritic pattern (see also Section 16). Further, the 1D assumption is generally
    valid for lakes that are not affected by the effects of Earth''s rotation on the
    internal flow field, although there are several examples of 1D lake models applied
    to large lakes (see e.g., Fenocchi et al., 2019; Gaudard et al., 2019; Goyette
    & Perroud, 2012; Piccolroaz & Toffolon, 2013; Wood et al., 2023). This can be
    verified by calculating the Rossby radius and is mostly valid for small and medium-sized
    water bodies. It should be noted that turbulence-based 1D models (see below for
    the definition), as for example, Simstrat (Goudsmit et al., 2002) and LAKE 2.0
    (Stepanenko et al., 2016) account for the effects of the Coriolis force in their
    hydrodynamic calculations and can generally be used for lakes regardless of size.
    The key equation at the basis of 1D lake models is the vertical water temperature
    transport equation. This equation can be formulated starting from Equation 14
    by focusing only on vertical processes and neglecting the vertical advection term
    to give: (34) where is the vertical eddy diffusivity (that, we recall, has a lower
    bound determined by the value of molecular diffusivity D). In this equation we
    replaced j = 3 with z, z being the depth hence defined as positive downwards,
    and omitted the overbar that denotes averaging. This equation can be rewritten
    making explicit the dominant heat source/sink terms and accounting for the lake''s
    hypsography: (35) where I(z, t) represents the internal heat generation due to
    penetrative solar radiation, Hsed(z, t) is the heat flux at the water-sediment
    interface (defined to be positive if heat flows from the sediments into the water),
    ST denotes other sink/source terms, and A(z) is the lake area. The penetrative
    solar radiation I is governed by the water clarity and, in general, is described
    through an exponential approximation of the Beer-Lambert attenuation law as follows:
    (36) where I0 = Hs,net is the available solar radiation at the lake surface and
    kd is the light extinction coefficient. It should be noted that, in general, the
    light extinction coefficient is not constant and varies as a function of the wavelength
    across the light spectrum (Bouffard et al., 2019). However, for simplicity, a
    monochromatic source is often assumed, and a constant value of kd is frequently
    empirically estimated as a function of the Secchi depth (Subin et al., 2012).
    In general, kd is on the order of 1 m−1 for turbid lakes and 0.1 m−1 for clear
    lakes (Bouffard & Wüest, 2019). In some cases, a fraction βs of the available
    solar radiation associated with wavelengths in the red end of the solar spectrum
    (wavelengths >700 nm), is allowed to be absorbed within the surface layer za.
    In such cases, Equation 36 is adjusted by defining and applying it for depths
    z ≥ za, with the component of I0 absorbed within the uppermost za layer being
    accounted for within the source term per unit volume ST. The fraction βs accounts
    for approximately 40%–50% of the total energy, which is absorbed within a surface
    layer za ∼ 0.6 m (Henderson-Sellers, 1986). We note that in shallow/clear lakes
    the portion of penetrating solar radiation reaching the bottom is absorbed in
    the top layer of sediments, although it can be partially reflected back and either
    absorbed in the layers above or released to the atmosphere, increasing the lake
    albedo (Subin et al., 2012). In order to solve Equation 35 an upper, surface boundary
    condition of the Neumann type is generally assumed with the form of: (37) where
    Hnet is the net heat flux exchange (positive when directed from the atmosphere
    toward the lake) between atmosphere and water column given by Equation 8, where
    the effects of precipitation, inflows/outflows, and water-sediment exchanges were
    excluded. The net shortwave radiation Hs,net is removed from the right-hand-side
    because, as noted above, it is already included in Equation 35 as a separate production
    term. Similarly, the contributions of precipitation, inflow/outflows, and water-sediment
    exchanges are regarded as additional source/sink terms in Equation 35. The right-hand
    side of Equation 37 includes only long-wave and non-radiative fluxes exchanged
    at the lake-atmosphere interface, which are absorbed within the uppermost 1–2
    mm of the water column (Henderson-Sellers, 1986). This thickness is smaller than
    the depth of surface layers typically considered in lake models, thus justifying
    its application as a Neumann-type boundary condition. The bottom boundary condition,
    is already introduced in Equation 35 as the term , which accounts for the water-sediment
    heat flux through approximating the water-sediment interface areas by the difference
    in horizontal areas between two consecutive depths according to the bathymetry
    of the lake (Goudsmit et al., 2002; Saloranta & Andersen, 2007). In general, this
    heat flux varies with depth and can be assigned if it is known, particularly when
    it is predominantly influenced by the upward geothermal flux (Gaudard et al.,
    2019; Piccolroaz & Toffolon, 2013), or modeled by taking into account sediment
    layers through the following heat conduction equation: (38) where λsed is the
    thermal conductivity, Tsed the temperature, and zsed the depth of the sediments
    (see e.g., the MyLake model in Saloranta and Andersen (2007)). We recall that
    the water-sediment heat flux Hsed is defined as positive when directed toward
    the water column. The effect of Hsed is often neglected (adiabatic boundary conditions
    at the sides), but it should always be considered in long-term climatic simulations
    (de la Fuente & Meruane, 2017). Ice and snow dynamics, and their impact on vertical
    heat fluxes, are mostly handled in a separate algorithm for 1D water temperature
    models. Here, more detailed descriptions of different algorithms can be found
    in H. Yao et al. (2014) and U. G. Kobler and Schmid (2019). Water temperature
    models differ in their ability to simulate a set of multiple variables, for example,
    black ice (congelation ice), white ice (snow ice) and/or snow thickness, the respective
    effects on atmosphere-water exchanges, and if ice growth can happen on top or
    below the ice-water interface. As the plethora of different ice algorithms makes
    a comprehensive description challenging, we will briefly describe the popular
    ice and snow algorithm of the MyLake model (Saloranta & Andersen, 2007) in this
    paragraph, which is also incorporated into Simstrat (Goudsmit et al., 2002) and
    GOTM (Burchard et al., 1999), which will be presented regarding their water temperature
    modeling approach in more details below. The MyLake ice and snow algorithm considers
    the dynamics of black ice, white ice as well as snow. Here, ice thickness changes
    when air temperature is below the freezing point and is quantified using Stefan''s
    law: (39) where hice is ice thickness, λice is thermal conductivity of ice, ρice
    is ice density, Lf is latent heat of freezing, Tf is water temperature at the
    freezing point (Tf = 0°C), and Tice is the temperature of the ice surface (Leppäranta,
    1993). Snow thickness is a function of precipitation, and white ice forms whenever
    the weight of snow exceeds the buoyancy capacity of the ice layer. Ice cover causes
    the surface layer to stay at constant freezing point temperatures, and heat diffusing
    into this layer is used for melting. Ice and snow thickness further affect the
    albedo regarding incoming short-wave radiation. Two prominent formulations for
    1D water temperature modeling have been established (Ford & Stefan, 1980; Perroud
    et al., 2009) based on how they simulate vertical transport. Both types of 1D
    models apply the 1D water temperature transport Equation 35 but individual models
    differ regarding their turbulent closure schemes which eventually results in different
    formulations for deriving the eddy diffusion coefficient . The first type estimates
    eddy diffusivity coefficients based on empirical or physically-based relationships.
    These models include integral energy models (also called mixed-layer models) as
    well as eddy-diffusion models. The other type are turbulence-based models that
    use additional equations to quantify turbulent transport of turbulent kinetic
    energy (TKE, k) and of its rate of dissipation (ɛ) (Rodi, 1984). In most cases,
    integral energy models apply the TKE by wind shear directly to calculate the mixed
    layer depth without focus on vertical transport of TKE (Ford & Stefan, 1980).
    The transport below the mixed layer depth is modeled solving Equation 35 with
    estimated using empirical relationships, mostly based on parameterizations related
    to the gradient Richardson number defined as the ratio between local gradients
    of buoyancy (stabilizing) and shear (causing turbulent mixing): (40) where u is
    the horizontal velocity, N is the Brunt-Väisälä or buoyancy frequency , and S
    represents local shear (note that the vertical coordinate z is defined as positive
    downwards). In a simple form, the eddy diffusivity can be related to buoyancy
    effects as: (41) where is the diffusivity at neutral stratification (Ri = 0),
    b and c are empirical coefficients that vary across a wide range according to
    the several relationships available in the literature (Henderson-Sellers, 1982;
    Munk & Anderson, 1948; Pacanowski & Philander, 1981). An example is the approach
    following Henderson-Sellers (1985), in which turbulent diffusivity is also parameterized
    based on the gradient Richardson number, see Equation 40, and is used to quantify
    vertical mixing over the full vertical axis (e.g., in the so-called Hostetler-type
    models, after Hostetler and Bartlein (1990)). This turbulent diffusivity model
    does not estimate a mixed layer depth from the external available kinetic energy
    and can be classified as eddy-diffusion model. It differs from turbulence-based
    models as it does not use additional calculations to account for turbulent energy
    production and dissipation. Therefore, methodologically and technically, models
    sensu Henderson-Sellers (1985) are closer to integral energy models than turbulence-based
    models. On the other hand, turbulence-based models quantify directly the production,
    transport and dissipation of TKE along the entire water column and have thereby
    a mechanistic basis for analyzing vertical turbulent transport and shear. Two-equation
    turbulence models like the k − ɛ model or the Mellor-Yamada model relate the TKE,
    k, to its dissipation rate, ɛ, using a characteristic length scale (42) and thereby
    introducing two additional equations for calculating the 1D water temperature
    transport (Burchard & Baumert, 1995; Burchard et al., 1998; Rodi, 1987). Several
    1D lake models have been proposed by the scientific community, including widely
    used modeling software such as Advanced Lake Biogeochemistry Model (ALBM, Tan
    et al., 2015), DYnamic REservoir Simulation Model (DYRESM, Imberger & Patterson,
    1981; Yeates & Imberger, 2003), General Lake Model (GLM, Hipsey et al., 2019),
    General Ocean Turbulence Model (GOTM, Burchard et al., 1999), the Hostetler model
    (Hostetler & Bartlein, 1990), LAKE 2.0 (Stepanenko et al., 2016), Multi-year Lake
    simulation model (MyLake, Saloranta & Andersen, 2007), Simstrat (Gaudard et al.,
    2017; Goudsmit et al., 2002), CLM4-LISSS (Subin et al., 2012), LAKEoneD (K. Jöhnk
    & Umlauf, 2001; K. D. Jöhnk et al., 2008), MINLAKE96 (Fang & Stefan, 1996), Weather
    Research and Forecasting-Lake (WRF-Lake, Gu et al., 2015), and customized lake
    models developed for investigating specific lakes conditions, for example, deep
    ventilation due to thermobaric instability (Piccolroaz & Toffolon, 2013), temperature
    patterns in turbid lakes (Fukushima et al., 2022). All these 1D modeling tools,
    see also F. Wang et al. (2019) for a similar list, provide lake-averaged projections.
    GLM, MyLake, and MINLAKE96 are examples of integral energy models in which the
    depth of the mixed layer is determined, and then the available external kinetic
    energy is compared to the internal potential energy of the water column to entrain
    denser water into the mixed layer (although specific formulations of the integral
    energy comparison vary, see i.e., Ford and Stefan (1980)). Integral energy models
    assume that the mixed surface layer is a perfectly mixed slab with constant temperature
    over depth and are based on early works of bulk mixed layer depth assumptions
    by for example, Kraus and Turner (1967). Generally, the external amount of TKE
    in such models mostly represents the external wind shear stress, but can also
    include convective overturn, shear production between layers and Kelvin-Helmholtz
    billowing (see Hipsey et al. (2019) for such an implementation). For surface layer
    mixing to occur, the TKE budget must be higher than the potential energy in the
    water column which is needed to lift up denser water from below the mixed layer
    and into the newly formed mixed layer, as well as in some formulations to account
    for the energy consumption by previously mentioned Kelvin-Helmholtz billowing.
    In other words, the lake is divided into a series of layers that are successively
    mixed downward until the available TKE is no longer sufficient to mix the next
    deeper layer. As an example for an integral energy scheme, we highlight here the
    approach sensu Herb and Stefan (2004) (neglecting the effects of the macrophyte
    vegetation reducing wind mixing) which is based on MINLAKE96. The external kinetic
    energy per unit area KE is parameterized based on surface wind velocity as: (43)
    where τ is surface turbulent shear stress, is surface shear velocity, and Δt is
    the model time step. Potential energy PE at layer i (with the reference at the
    surface) is: (44) where zi is the mean depth of the ith layer, zcm is the center
    of mass of the mixed layer, and Δρ is the density change from the mixed layer
    to the layer i + 1 (Herb & Stefan, 2004). At each model time step, the depth of
    the mixed layer is iteratively calculated until the condition PEi+1 > KE is met.
    All these models apply an empirical parameterization of the eddy diffusivity,
    , related to buoyancy effects and therefore to the Brunt-Väisälä frequency to
    model mixing below the mixed layer, hence in the thermocline: (45) (46) GLM uses
    the Weinstock derivation which relates the eddy diffusivity to water column stability
    and rate of turbulent dissipation, in which CHYP is a constant coefficient for
    the mixing efficiency, ɛTKE is a simplified approximation of turbulent dissipation
    rate based on the dissipation by inflows and wind, kTKE is the turbulence energy
    containing wavenumber, and u∗ is the wind shear velocity (Weinstock, 1981). We
    note that in GLM, kTKE is empirically parameterized based on lake morphometry
    and stratification (Hipsey et al., 2019). MyLake and MINLAKE96 relate the eddy
    diffusivity to an empirically measured relationship of diffusivity values to the
    buoyancy frequency, where ak is a parameterization of the lake surface area (Hondzo
    & Stefan, 1993). WRF-Lake, ALBM, and the Hostetler model are examples of models
    based on the previously mentioned formulation after Henderson-Sellers (1985) which
    can be considered as eddy-diffusion-based models. The depth of the surface mixed
    layer is not calculated directly from external KE but solved for solely through
    turbulent diffusion, in which the eddy diffusivity coefficient is related to the
    gradient Richardson number, and employing a mixing scheme to adjust water temperature
    instabilities by mixing instantaneously and recursively adjacent water layers
    until the temperature difference is less than a small specified-value: (47) where
    κ is the von Karman''s constant, σt,0 is the neutral value of the turbulent Prandtl
    number (normally assumed equal to 1 according to the Reynolds analogy), and k∗
    is a latitudinally dependent parameter of the Ekman profile (see also Hostetler
    and Bartlein (1990)). k∗ can be quantified as: (48) where ϕ is the latitude of
    the lake, and U2 is wind speed 2 m above the water surface. The turbulent Prandtl
    number is defined as: (49) where νz is the kinematic eddy viscosity along the
    z direction. Simstrat, LAKE 2.0, LAKEoneD, and GOTM are examples for turbulence-based
    models that apply the k − ɛ two-equation turbulence model to quantify production,
    transport and dissipation rates of TKE. These type of models add two more equations
    of the general form: (50) (51) in which k and ɛ are related to the turbulent diffusivities
    of TKE and TKE dissipation ( and , respectively), the TKE production due to shear
    (P), and the production and dissipation of TKE related to buoyancy (B) (Goudsmit
    et al., 2002; Rodi, 1984). The empirical constants cɛ,1, cɛ,2, and cɛ,3 are fitted
    using field or experimental data. The eddy viscosity can be calculated as , where
    cμ is an empirical coefficient based on flow experiments (Rodi, 1984). In the
    standard k − ɛ model, the eddy diffusivity coefficient is related to the turbulence
    kinetic energy k and dissipation rate ɛ through the turbulent Prandtl number σt,
    which was introduced earlier: . Similarly, and , where σk and σɛ are model constants
    (Goudsmit et al., 2002). According to the Reynolds analogy, the turbulent Prandtl
    number σt is typically assumed to be equal to in neutrally stratified environments.
    On the other hand, in stable stratification environments, it may be a calibration
    parameter (Boegman et al., 2001) or a function of the Richardson number (Venayagamoorthy
    & Stretch, 2010). These four highlighted 1D turbulence-based models all apply
    a fixed numerical grid with the grid layers having a constant thickness over the
    course of a simulation. Turbulence-based models may also include the horizontal
    velocity components over the vertical axis through which they account for the
    effects of the Coriolis force on the vertical flow field. Because turbulence-based
    models have a mechanistic representation of momentum as well as production and
    dissipation of TKE, they can be used to directly compare model projections with
    measured quantities of TKE and shear stress. This enables them to have a greater
    generality than integral energy models which rely on specific assumptions about
    how external TKE affects the heat budget inside the water column. Due to their
    low computational costs and the availability of long-term monitoring data typically
    measured at a lake''s deepest site, vertical 1D water temperature models are prominently
    used for lake modeling. Their main applications are regarding physical limnological
    investigations, for example, projecting changes in lake mixing and stratification,
    quantifying vertical heat transport, guiding lake and reservoir management, and
    investigating the thermal habitat of different species. A typical application
    is to use 1D lake models in projecting climate change effects on lake systems
    (e.g., Ayala et al., 2020; Fenocchi et al., 2018; U. G. Kobler & Schmid, 2019;
    Magee & Wu, 2017; Moras et al., 2019; Piccolroaz & Toffolon, 2018; Robertson &
    Ragotzkie, 1990; Woolway, Jennings, et al., 2021; Wood et al., 2023), as, due
    to low computational costs, they can project long-term effects in a low time frame.
    Their application for climate change projections is especially advisable as 1D
    lake models can sufficiently replicate the dynamics of lake systems regarding
    stratification, ice formation and mixing compared with higher dimensional models
    (Ishikawa et al., 2022), and upscaling is technically feasible due to low computational
    demands. 1D lake models are also frequently used to evaluate the effect of meteorological
    extreme events on in-lake mixing and heat transport (e.g., Bueche et al., 2017;
    Mesman et al., 2021; Perga et al., 2018; Shinohara et al., 2023). Further, 1D
    lake models are frequently used for quantifying heat and mass transport in water
    bodies and therefore to infer and adapt water management (e.g., Barbosa et al.,
    2021; Ladwig et al., 2018; Mi et al., 2018; Olsson, 2022; Soares et al., 2019;
    Weber et al., 2017). Also, important ecological information like the thermal habitat
    or the solubility of gases can be inferred from the vertical distribution of water
    temperature (e.g., Butcher et al., 2015; Magee et al., 2019). 1D water temperature
    models can be easily coupled, or in some cases are already internally coupled,
    to aquatic ecosystem models (AEM3Ds) to project changes in water quality and ecosystem
    dynamics (e.g., Andersen et al., 2022; Kong et al., 2023; Ladwig, Hanson, et al.,
    2021; Salk et al., 2022). In most cases, there is a one-way coupling between the
    thermodynamics and the AEM3D, in which the projected vertical diffusivity coefficient
    is used to infer the transport of water quality variables. Two-way couplings exist,
    notably when the light attenuation by dissolved and particulate matter is projected
    from the water quality model and fed-back to the thermodynamic model for calculating
    the internal heat generation. 4.4 2D and 3D Models 2D models are used to simulate
    lake transects (length-depth), typically, but not necessarily, lying along the
    longitudinal and lateral directions of a curvilinear coordinates system. This
    type of model is particularly suitable for application in fjord lakes, deep-valley
    reservoirs, and elongated lakes in general (e.g., Kim & Choi, 2021; Lindenschmidt
    et al., 2019; Mi et al., 2020; Ulloa et al., 2022). Besides temperature and other
    scalars, 2D models normally solve also the bi-dimensional flow field. One of the
    most widely used 2D models is the CE-QUAL-W2 model, which is a longitudinal/vertical
    hydrodynamic and water quality model developed and maintained by US Army Corps
    of Engineers and Portland State University (Cole & Wells, 2006). The model is
    laterally averaged, assuming that lateral variations in velocities, temperatures,
    and constituents are negligible. For this reason, it is best suited for relatively
    long and narrow water bodies characterized by longitudinal and vertical water
    quality gradients. The CE-QUAL-W2 model uses fixed computation grids with a static
    bathymetric surface onto which longitudinal segments and vertical layers are mapped,
    and the hydrodynamic and water temperature computations are performed at the intersections
    of these segments and layers. The model user can choose among several different
    turbulence closure schemes, ranging from Richardson number based parameterizations
    to the k − ɛ model, the latter being the turbulence closure recommended by the
    developers. These models quantify the eddy vertical viscosity νz, which is then
    used to calculate the vertical thermal eddy diffusivity assuming a default constant
    value of the turbulent Prandtl number σt = 7. The value of σt = 7 is commonly
    accepted for laminar flows in freshwater. However, previous sensitivity analyses
    of the CE-QUAL-W2 model have shown that optimal values for this parameter are
    smaller, as expected in turbulent flows where the parameter approaches unity (Boegman
    et al., 2001). The model also requires the definition of a horizontal diffusion
    coefficient, which, according to the approach proposed by Okubo (1971), is linearly
    proportional to the lateral grid spacing through a coefficient. 3D models are
    utilized to reconstruct the full thermo-hydrodynamics of a lake. These models
    are commonly used in large water bodies or when a detailed simulation of specific
    processes is required. Like 2D models, 3D models simulate not only temperature
    and other scalar values but also the flow field, resulting in the most physically
    realistic and complete simulation of the processes occurring in a water body.
    Parallel to a better representation of the processes, also the complexity, computational
    cost, and data requirements increase compared to simpler models. Several 3D models
    are used to simulate the thermodynamics of lakes, many of which are also used
    in the oceanography community. Delft3D, an open-source integrated modeling suite
    (Deltares, 2023), is an example widely used by limnologists. It simulates two-dimensional
    flow (in either the horizontal or vertical plane) and three-dimensional flow (through
    the Delft3D-FLOW module), as well as sediment transport, morphology, waves, water
    quality, and ecology through other specific modules of the modeling suite. This
    model has been successfully applied in several physical and ecological lake studies
    (e.g., Amadori et al., 2021; Guo et al., 2023b; Schwindt et al., 2023; Soulignac
    et al., 2019) and is at the basis of an online platform providing lake observations
    and three-dimensional numerical simulations in near real-time with short-term
    forecasts and data assimilation (Baracchini, Wüest, & Bouffard, 2020). Another
    example is MITgcm (Massachusetts Institute of Technology General Circulation Model,
    Adcroft et al., 1997), whose hydrodynamic kernel is used to drive both atmospheric
    and oceanic models and that includes physical and biogeochemical parameterizations
    of key atmospheric and oceanic processes. This model has been recently applied
    also to lake modeling (e.g., Safin et al., 2022). The ELCOM model (Estuary and
    Lake COmputer Model, Hodges et al., 2000), adapted from the TRIM model (Casulli
    & Cheng, 1992) with the inclusion, among the other modifications, of a mixed-layer
    turbulence closure, is another well-known 3D hydrodynamics model that has been
    widely applied for simulating processes in lakes and reservoirs. ELCOM is often
    coupled with the biogeochemical model Computational Aquatic Ecosystem DYnamics
    Model (CAEDYM, Hamilton & Schladow, 1997), the coupled model being known as (AEM3D)
    and being used for water quality analyses including water temperature and stratification
    forecasting (Lin et al., 2022). Finally, among many others here we mention Environmental
    Fluid Dynamics Code (EFDC, Hamrick, 1992) that can be used to simulate aquatic
    systems in 1D, 2D, and 3D and has been applied to simulate thermal structures
    and dynamics in many lakes worldwide (e.g., Arifin et al., 2016; Hui et al., 2018;
    Khazaei et al., 2023; Y. Li et al., 2010). Compared with the above discussed 1D
    and 2D models, 3D models are closer to reality as they can model the thermal dynamics
    in the longitudinal, lateral, and vertical directions. However, they need more
    computational efforts due to their higher complexity and, in principle, require
    spatially distributed forcing variables to impose the boundary conditions and
    spatially distributed observations for their validation. In fact, the proper assessment
    of any 3D lake model would require a comparison of simulated and observed velocity
    fields at several locations. However, even 3D models may produce unrealistic scenarios,
    especially when the calibration of their parameters was improperly or unsuccessfully
    conducted (Schwindt et al., 2023). Moreover, available measurements are often
    limited to water temperature profiles and velocity measurements are generally
    scarce or absent, thus limiting the application of 3D models. In some cases, however,
    in absence of velocity measurement a consistent reproduction of the 3D lake dynamics
    may be tempted, by distilling information across diverse spatial and temporal
    scales from a heterogeneous set of water temperature data alone (Amadori et al.,
    2021). In absence of sufficient information or computational power required to
    run a 3D model, lower dimensionality models can be used to obtain quasi-3D simulations
    (see Figure 6). For example, the CE-QUAL-W2 model can be applied in a quasi-3D
    manner by discretizing the computational domain into different branches. This
    approach is particularly useful when modeling dendritic lakes, which is typical
    of reservoirs with several side arms (Cole & Wells, 2006). Likewise, there are
    examples of 1D models applied in a spatially distributed domain thus obtaining
    a so-called multi-column lake model, which can be assumed as a quasi-3D representation
    of a lake (e.g., Gaillard et al., 2022; Martynov et al., 2010; Subin et al., 2012;
    Sugiyama et al., 2018). This approach does not allow for the simulation of the
    lake''s hydrodynamics and hence of horizontal heat advection but has been proven
    to be a good (and more economic) alternative to full 3D models to simulate the
    horizontal and vertical spatial thermal patterns of large lakes over seasonal
    time scales (Gaillard et al., 2022). Also 0D and 0.5D models can be applied in
    a distributed framework to obtain 2D and 2.5D representation of a lake, respectively,
    in terms of horizontal spatial patterns of LSWT, in the second case including
    the estimate of the well-mixed layer depth (see e.g., Calamita et al., 2021).
    5 Model Performance 5.1 Performance Metrics To evaluate the performance of environmental
    models, including water temperature models, a large number of performance metrics
    has been proposed in the literature. The most used performance metrics span from
    standard residual criteria, to correlation and model efficiency measures, and
    are summarized in Table 2. For other common performance metrics we refer the interested
    reader to previous reviews specifically focused on presenting these metrics with
    their strengths and weaknesses (Bennett et al., 2013; Moriasi et al., 2007). Likewise,
    we refer to the work by Hipsey et al. (2020) for a comprehensive list of performance
    metrics specifically tailored to the case of aquatic ecosystem modeling, which
    includes a section dedicated to physical models of aquatic systems. In that study,
    the authors proposed a four levels framework for model validation, combining:
    conceptual accuracy (Level 0), state accuracy (Level 1), process accuracy (Level
    2), and accuracy in capturing system behavior (Level 3). The conceptual validation
    of a model is a needed prerequisite (Level 0) that is implicitly ensured when
    developing a new model, but often taken for granted when applying an existing
    model. Process validation (Level 2) and system validation (Level 3) are seldom
    undertaken (Hipsey et al., 2020) as they require richer available data sets than
    are generally available; the comparison of simulated state variables with observations
    (Level 1) is the predominant approach available in the literature (Hipsey et al.,
    2020). Examples of higher validation levels may include model performance metrics
    to assess the simulated heat fluxes and turbulent mixing intensity within the
    water column against for example, turbulence measurements (Level 2) or the simulated
    water age and eddy structures against estimates from geochemical tracers and thermal
    satellite images, respectively (Level 3). These higher levels of model validation
    are restricted to 1D/2D models (Level 2) and 3D models (Level 3). Table 2. List
    of the Most Used Performance Metrics (See e.g., Bennett et al., 2013; Hipsey et
    al., 2020 for Additional Metrics and Further Details) Name Formula Notes Mean
    Error (ME) or Bias Calculates if the model over/underestimates observations. Values
    close to zero does not necessarily indicate low error due to cancellation Mean
    Absolute Error (MAE) Similar to ME except absolute values are used instead. It
    is not affected by cancellation Mean Square Error (MSE) Similar to ME but in data
    units squared. It is not affected by cancellation and squaring the data penalizes
    more higher error values Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) The squared root of MSE.
    It facilitates interpretation since it is in the same data units. Often referred
    to as Root Mean Square Deviation (RMSD) Absolute Maximum Error (AME) Indicates
    the largest error Mean Relative Mean Error or Bias (MRME) Relative equivalent
    of ME. This metric increases the weighting of errors related to low measurement
    values. The same normalization approach is commonly applied to MAE. ϵ is a small
    value to avoid division by 0 when Oi = 0 Normalized Mean Error or Bias (NME) Normalized
    equivalent of ME. Normalization can be obtained also dividing by the standard
    deviation or range of variability of observations. The same normalization approach
    can be applied to MAE, MSE and RMSE Correlation Coefficient (Corr or r) Pearson
    correlation coefficient, which measures the linear correlation of the observed
    and modeled values. The squared of the Pearson correlation coefficient is called
    coefficient of determination (r2) and estimates the fraction of the variance in
    O that is explained by M in a simple linear regression Nash Sutcliffe Efficiency
    (NSE) A normalized statistic that evaluates the relative magnitude of the residual
    variance compared to the observed data variance (Nash & Sutcliffe, 1970). NSE
    = 1 indicates perfect fitting while NSE = 0 indicates that the model performs
    as accurate as the mean of the observed data. NSE <0.5 is associated to unsatisfactory
    performance (Moriasi et al., 2007). When is substituted with the climatological
    year, we refer to the modified version NSE*, which is especially useful in the
    presence of significant seasonal patterns Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) A
    metric that weights the RMSE based on the N number of observations used in calibration
    and k number of model parameters. AIC is aimed at finding the most parsimonious
    model and preventing over-fitting (Akaike, 1974) Bayesian Information Criterion
    (BIC) Similar to AIC (Schwarz, 1978) Note. The terms Mi and Oi indicate simulated
    and observed values, respectively; i = 1, …, N indicates time index and N is the
    total number of observations; the bar symbol ( and ) refers to the time average
    of the time series. Level 1 validation is generally undertaken by direct comparison
    of time-series of water temperature. The vast majority of cases use point measurements
    or vertical profiles, but more recently, LSWT derived from satellites have been
    used to evaluate the horizontal performance of 3D models (e.g., Amadori et al.,
    2021; Baracchini, Chu, et al., 2020; Mao & Xia, 2020) and 2D multi-box models
    (Calamita et al., 2021). In some cases, the limitations of using point measurements
    with low spatial representativeness can be alleviated by distilling the information
    across multiple temporal scales (typically from hourly to seasonally, depending
    on the frequency and duration of the time series) using wavelet analysis or other
    signal decomposition strategies and comparing the power spectra resulting from
    observations and simulations (e.g., Amadori et al., 2021; Kara et al., 2012).
    Likewise, the informativeness of vertical temperature profiles can be used beyond
    direct comparison of predicted and observed values by comparing derived indices
    of thermal stratification intensity such as the Schmidt stability (e.g., Bruce
    et al., 2018) or the Lake Number, or indicators of stratification phenology such
    as the mixed layer and thermocline depths (e.g., Bayer et al., 2013; Bruce et
    al., 2018), stratification onset and break-up (e.g., Woolway, Sharma, et al.,
    2021), or ice cover duration (e.g., Piccolroaz, Zhu, et al., 2021). This approach
    partially accomplishes a Level 2 model validation. When assessing model performance
    using observed temperature profiles, we recommend evaluating depth-specific or
    layer-specific metrics in addition to the metrics calculated for the entire profile,
    which is the common standard. To properly interpret the model errors relative
    to the depth-specific variance of observations, we also suggest using normalized
    model efficiency performance criteria such as NSE (see Table 2 for the definition
    of all performance metrics). For instance, the same residual error in the epilimnion,
    which is typically characterized by larger observational variance, or in the hypolimnion,
    which is typically associated with much smaller variance, does not have the same
    meaning and if not normalized it may lead to incorrect conclusions (Amadori et
    al., 2021; Feldbauer et al., 2022; Wood et al., 2023). The usefulness of evaluating
    depth-specific metrics clearly emerges from Figure 7 (that will be discussed in
    more detail in Section 24), where for the 1D lake model GLM has a similar RMSE
    in the epilimnion or in the hypolimnion (around 0.75–0.80°C at 5 and below 20
    m depth) is associated to different NSE values (around 0.97 and <0.93, respectively).
    We note that for metrics such as ME, MAE, MSE, and MRME the overall values obtained
    considering all the available data correspond to taking the average of the depth-specific
    metrics, if the sample sizes at different depths are the same. When assessing
    the performance of a model in simulating time series with prominent seasonal patterns,
    such as LSWT, it may be preferable to use NSE* instead of NSE (see Table 2) to
    better understand how well the model captures dynamics that are not part of the
    seasonal component (Piccolroaz et al., 2016; Schaefli & Gupta, 2007). In this
    case, it is worth noting that NSE* = 1 indicates perfect model fitting, just like
    NSE. However, NSE* = 0 implies that the model performs as well as assuming the
    mean year of measurements, which is different from NSE = 0 that indicates the
    model performs as well as assuming the mean observed value. Figure 7 Open in figure
    viewer PowerPoint Depth-specific distribution of some key performance metrics
    for the 1D models the General Lake Model, General Ocean Turbulence Model, and
    Simstrat, obtained over a 2-year period in Lake Feeagh (Ireland) utilizing the
    R package LakeEnsemblR. The values of the same metrics evaluated using all the
    available data are also shown (vertical lines). Please refer to Table 2 for a
    detailed explanation of the metrics used. Particularly when evaluating the performance
    of 0D and 0.5D statistical or hybrid models, it is recommended to use information
    theory and the corresponding scores to rank models based on a trade-off between
    goodness of fit and model parsimony (i.e., number of model parameters, see Table
    2). The main examples of these scores are the Akaike Information Criterion (AIC,
    Akaike, 1974) and the Bayesian Information Criteria (BIC, Schwarz, 1978). These
    information criteria have been successfully adopted in several studies (e.g.,
    Piotrowski et al., 2021; Toffolon et al., 2022; Woolway, Sharma, et al., 2021).
    However, we note that the choice of the performance metric may not be sufficient
    to evaluate the reliability of a model to predict the investigated processes.
    It must be coupled with appropriate calibration procedures that are appropriate
    for the model and for the physical processes that are approximated by the model
    (Triana et al., 2019), as is further discussed in the next section. The degree
    to which a model is validated depends on the choice of the number and type of
    performance metrics to be adopted. This choice is often guided by the background
    and experience of the modeler and is not immune from a general desire to report
    favorably on the performance of the model (Hipsey et al., 2020). This subjectivity
    and possible bias in model validation could be overcome by the adoption of assessment
    standards based on universally accepted performance criteria, which however is
    still lacking but is highly desired to facilitate inter-comparison of different
    model approaches. An unspoken rule that seems to be tacitly accepted by modelers
    is the combined use of multiple performance metrics. In fact, each performance
    metric generally measures only specific aspects of a model''s performance thus
    single performance criterion may lead to counterproductive or biased results such
    as favoring models that do not reproduce important features of a system (Bennett
    et al., 2013). 5.2 Calibration/Optimization Methods The majority of computational
    models in different fields of science have some parameters that need to be calibrated/optimized,
    hereafter referred to as optimized, often by fitting them to empirical-based data.
    There are, however, contradictory conceptual, or ideological, approaches to optimization.
    According to some researchers, optimization is merely a technique to make the
    model empirically adequate, even if it does not necessarily make it reliable for
    making predictions of any kind (Oreskes et al., 1994). Although such an approach
    may seem ideologically tempting at first, it is empirical confirmation that allows
    scientists to trust any theory or model. For example, the lack of empirical confirmation
    makes some fundamental issues, like the theoretical discussion on the existence
    of multiverse (Ellis, 2008) or on the real existence of pure mathematical objects
    (Abbott, 2013) at best on the edge of science. Although optimization of models
    can limit the validity of the research that is made using such models, fitting
    some model parameters to empirical data is often unavoidable and makes a process-driven
    model a semi-empirical model (Gupta et al., 2006). However, existing literature
    provides evidence that enhancing the realism of a model can, in some cases, diminish
    the necessity for extensive model calibration (e.g., Gharari et al., 2014; Guinot
    & Gourbesville, 2003). There are generally four main ways to perform optimization
    of water temperature models. Some prefer manual calibration, in which user modifies
    the values of parameters based on expert knowledge. Although this approach is
    still sometimes recommended (Yu et al., 2022), it can be highly inefficient in
    terms of both time needed and effects obtained. Nonetheless, manual calibration
    is frequently used for computationally demanding, 2D (Diogo et al., 2008; Ishikawa
    et al., 2022; Zouabi-Aloui et al., 2015) and 3D (Castelletti et al., 2010; Hodges
    & Dallimore, 2001; Hui et al., 2018; B. Martin et al., 2013; Missaghi & Hondzo,
    2010; Preston et al., 2014; Soulignac et al., 2017) thermo-hydrodynamic lake or
    reservoir models. The other approach is using gradient, or second-order derivative-based
    algorithms (Battiti, 1992; Levenberg, 1944), which are often fast and accurate
    in finding the local optimum. However, such algorithms generally converge to the
    closest local solution and require the model to be differentiable; both issues
    pose important limitations for lake water temperature models. The examples of
    application of such algorithms include mainly ML tools (Saber et al., 2020; S.
    Zhu, Ptak, Yaseen, et al., 2020). The third group of methods is composed of so-called
    metaheuristic optimization algorithms (Del Ser et al., 2019), which are optimization
    algorithms inspired by natural or artificial systems to fine-tune model parameters
    and achieve an optimal fit to observed data, and can be applied for calibration
    of almost any kind of lake water temperature models (e.g., Afshar et al., 2011;
    Piccolroaz et al., 2013; Piotrowski et al., 2022; Shabani et al., 2021; Xia et
    al., 2021; Yousefi & Toffolon, 2022; S. Zhu et al., 2021). The use of metaheuristic
    algorithms in calibrating environmental models is encouraged in Maier et al. (2019).
    Finally, Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithms (Andrieu et al., 2010; Braak,
    2006; Vrugt et al., 2013) that iteratively generate samples of parameter values
    from a probability distribution, are mainly used for calibration of 3D models
    (e.g., Hipsey et al., 2019; Safin et al., 2022). Some early LSWT modeling studies
    claim that water temperature models may not need calibration to each specific
    lake, as their parameters are relatively easily generalized to different water
    bodies (Hondzo & Stefan, 1993). For example, generalizations may be made based
    on links between model parameters, location and bathymetry of the lake (Fang &
    Stefan, 2009). However, studies on large numbers of lakes have shown that the
    lack of lake-specific calibration decreases the performance of water temperature
    model simulations (Read et al., 2014). Recently, lake-specific features were used
    to transfer trained process-guided deep learning models of water temperature from
    observed to unobserved systems via a meta-model (Willard et al., 2021). This work
    highlights the flexibility of deep learning to leverage information across lakes,
    but also confirms the importance of lake features in the prediction of lake water
    temperature at broad scales. Currently, most lake water temperature models are
    being calibrated for each specific case. In our opinion, model calibration methods
    should be explicitly described, as previous studies showed that the choice of
    calibration method may be a crucial factor affecting the performance of lake water
    temperature modeling (Piotrowski et al., 2023; S. Zhu et al., 2021). The choice
    of the calibration method should always depend on the model and user requirements
    (Maier et al., 2019; Osaba et al., 2021; Weise et al., 2012). If the objective
    function is differentiable and the problem is unimodal (or have a few local optima
    with solutions of similar quality), gradient-based methods are a good choice.
    If the problem is not differentiable, but low-dimensional and its fitness landscape
    have a simple shape, one may try manual calibration. If the problem may have many
    local minima of diverse quality, metaheuristics or MCMC algorithms should be used.
    Specifically, when one wants to address the problem of parameter uncertainty,
    MCMC are often the best options. When a single solution is to be found for a highly-dimensional
    model, metaheuristics are the advisable tools. Other factors that should be taken
    into account include computational complexity (computationally demanding models
    may require gradient-based methods or surrogate-based heuristics Jin (2011), see
    also Xia et al. (2021) for a case focused on limnology) and the number of objectives
    (if one wants to fit the model to more than one criteria, multi-objective algorithms
    are needed). There are also some technical points that are often neglected, but
    may highly affect the final outcome of the calibration procedure. First, one has
    to repeat calibration of the model a number of times because most calibration
    algorithms are stochastic in the sense that they include some randomness in their
    operators. As a result, two different simulations may produce two different results,
    hence a number of simulations is needed to summarize the quality of solutions.
    Additionally, even if the calibration procedure is purely deterministic, if the
    model is not unimodal (hence have more than a single optimum), the solution finally
    found may depend on the location of the initial solutions. Again, multiple simulations
    from different initial solutions is needed. After performing a number of simulations,
    some statistics on the quality of solutions should be reported. The importance
    of repeated simulations has been pointed out in the optimization literature (Vecek
    et al., 2017), but also in limnological research (Yousefi & Toffolon, 2022). The
    second important technical point that needs to be addressed in calibration is
    the careful choice of the algorithm''s control parameters. It is often overlooked
    that nearly every calibration algorithm has its own set of control parameters,
    and some of these parameters can significantly affect performance. The simplest
    example is population size in evolutionary algorithms (Eiben et al., 1999; Piotrowski
    et al., 2020), but various kinds of control parameters exist in almost any optimization
    algorithm, including MCMC, metaheuristics, and gradient-based techniques. Before
    running an algorithm one should decide whether to use the “classical” (e.g., suggested
    by the authors of the particular procedure) control parameters, or perform pre-tuning
    (C. Huang et al., 2020). Pre-tuning is advisable for a novel application of particular
    optimizer, but as tuning is computationally demanding, in most cases authors prefer
    to rely on the suggested control parameters. However, this may lead to sub-optimal
    performance of the method if the recommendations were produced using a different
    use-case. The third technical issue to consider when calibrating lake temperature
    models relates to the stopping criteria that are to be used for the algorithm.
    In the case of gradient-based methods, these are rather simple to set, but for
    metaheuristics or MCMC methods the choice of stopping conditions is more subjective
    and may highly affect the results (e.g., Even-Dar et al., 2006; Piotrowski et
    al., 2017; Sergeyev et al., 2018). Modelers should ensure the computational time
    allowed for the optimizer would be sufficient to find solutions of appropriate
    quality, otherwise the performance of the calibrated model may be affected. Finally,
    it should be remembered that developing the universally “best” calibration method
    is impossible (Wolpert & MacReady, 1997), and that the performance of various
    algorithms may highly differ for the specific problem. For a more general guide
    on the application of optimization algorithms, we refer the interested readers
    to Handberg and Campante (2011), Weise et al. (2012), Shahriari et al. (2016),
    Maier et al. (2019), Osaba et al. (2021), and Ma et al. (2023) for more details.
    6 Emerging Modeling Approaches and Future Directions 6.1 Forecasting Forecasting
    of water quality and ecological variables is needed for projecting future changes,
    validating our modeling tools and informing water management (Dietze et al., 2018).
    There has been a recent focus on either near-term or seasonal forecasts of water
    temperature. Thomas et al. (2020) developed the real-time iterative water temperature
    forecasting system Forecasting Lake and Reservoir Dynamics (FLARE) which consists
    of a data assimilation procedure and an ensemble-based forecasting algorithm to
    create 16-day forecasts of water temperature (using GLM) with uncertainty. A near-term
    forecasting study on six lakes across the United States revealed that the accuracy
    of water temperature forecasts depended on lake depth as well as water clarity
    (Thomas et al., 2020). Recently, the National Ecological Observatory Network (NEON)
    Ecological Forecasting Challenge created an open-data framework to advance theory
    in ecology by near-term forecasting of ecological variables, including water temperature
    (Thomas et al., 2022). There are also examples of near-term forecasting applications
    including data assimilation that use 3D hydrodynamics models in large lakes, that
    is, Lake Geneva (Baracchini, Wüest, & Bouffard, 2020) or Lake Erie (Lin et al.,
    2022). In both cases, the simulations results are published on user-friendly data
    visualization web-platform open the public and are expected to support governmental
    agencies in charge of the water resources management and policy making (see http://meteolakes.ch
    and https://coastlines.engineering.queensu.ca/). For seasonal forecasts, Mercado-Bettín
    et al. (2021) used GLM and GOTM for two lake systems to explore how temperature
    forecasts vary across different hydrologic models and climate input data. Clayer
    et al. (2023) further coupled these lake models with hydrological models forced
    with seasonal meteorological forecast ensembles to provide probabilistic predictions
    of seasonal anomalies in lake water temperature and ice-off. The concept of using
    forecasting to improve modeling theory can be an opportunity in water temperature
    modeling to improve existing algorithms and compare alternative model concepts
    (A. S. Lewis et al., 2022; Carey et al., 2022). 6.2 Digital Twins A digital twin
    is a virtual representation of a physical “real” lake. The concept of a digital
    twin is commonly applied in other fields like water resource management and hydrology
    (e.g., Henriksen et al., 2023; Ramos et al., 2023; Rigon et al., 2022), but has
    not been extensively applied to lakes. As part of the Digital Earth (X. Li et
    al., 2023), the digital twin of lakes has the potential to be a strategic resource
    for decision-making, enabling timely interventions that can yield improved results.
    For instance, it can assist in assessing the impact of climate change on lake
    thermal dynamics and identifying feasible mitigation measures. To develop a digital
    twin for the study of lake thermal dynamics, four foundational elements are needed:
    (a) the physical twin, namely the lake itself, (b) data sets, which includes all
    available observations, (c) the digital twin, which includes one or more lake
    models with access to the data sets and modeling results to support well-timed
    decision-making; and (d) incorporation of decision-support tools, which include
    visualization capabilities and customizable digital interfaces. With the development
    of the digital twin of lakes, we can further answer “what if” questions, for example,
    what if the lake experiences extreme events (e.g., heatwaves) or human-induced
    alterations (e.g., selective withdrawals)? How will this impact the lake thermal
    dynamics (e.g., stratification and mixing) and water quality? What can be done
    to mitigate the negative impacts? Engaging in the creation of digital twin models
    for lakes represents a strategic and pioneering approach with promising prospects
    for scientific advancement. 6.3 Combining Process-Based Modeling With Deep Learning
    ML models are more flexible compared to process-based models as they do not require
    the mathematical structure that represents physical processes. Though ML models
    have proven their efficiency and accuracy in lake water temperature modeling (see
    the literature cited in Section 6), they lack clear physical meaning, which can
    lead to poor performance when predicting in out-of-bounds conditions such as future
    climate scenarios or in the large majority of lakes that are rarely or never monitored.
    To overcome this issue, coupling ML models (e.g., deep learning) with theory (physical
    laws) in various model architectures and methods have been proposed (Willard,
    Read, et al., 2022). For example, Read et al. (2019) proposed a hybrid modeling
    framework for the prediction of lake water temperature profiles. Three aspects
    of knowledge or theory were included in this modeling framework: temporal awareness
    in the form of an LSTM, enforcement of physical laws through model penalties when
    predictions violated conservation of energy, and pretraining with simulated water
    temperature from a process-based model. These methods have been shown to outperform
    process-based models and pure deep learning methods (Read et al., 2019; X. Jia
    et al., 2021). These and other hybrid models have led to the emergence of a new
    modeling approach often referred to as Knowledge-Guided Machine Learning (KGML),
    in which deep learning neural networks and physics-based models are combined to
    leverage their complementary strengths and improve the modeling of physical processes
    (Appling et al., 2022; Chen et al., 2023; X. Jia et al., 2019; Willard, Jia, et
    al., 2022). Furthermore, ML has the potential to assist in calibrating process-driven
    models and identifying the aspects or algorithms that may be lacking in these
    models. 6.4 Evaluating Structural Model Differences Through Ensemble Modeling
    Water temperature modeling studies routinely compare the predictions and performance
    of different models (e.g., Heddam et al., 2020; Sharma et al., 2008; Yousefi &
    Toffolon, 2022; S. Zhu, Ptak, Yaseen, et al., 2020). For example, Yousefi and
    Toffolon (2022) compared nine ML models including both shallow and deep ones for
    the forecasting of LSWT, and the results showed that none of the nine ML models
    clearly prevails. In a recent study, Di Nunno et al. (2023) demonstrated that
    ensemble models, created by stacking multiple ML algorithms, can enhance the predictive
    performance of individual ML algorithms when forecasting LSWT. Likewise, Almeida
    et al. (2022) compared the prediction capabilities of FLake and the Hostetler
    models in reproducing LSWT against a ML algorithm in 24 reservoirs where temperature
    dynamics are substantially affected by inflows/outflows. They found that ML models
    may outperform process-based physical models in terms of both accuracy and computational
    cost when long-term observations were available. However, because these inter-comparisons
    were conducted on a limited number of lakes/reservoirs, they could not claim which
    modeling approach was the best. This is particularly true considering that, generally
    speaking, the choice of the best model depends on the specific process at hand
    and results from a compromise between model performance, data requirements, and
    computational cost. Furthermore, the performance of any model relies on the user''s
    knowledge of the model and ability to calibrate or train it. However, it is challenging
    for scientists to be experts in the implementation of every model. Therefore,
    it is advisable to approach model comparison studies with caution in this regard.
    Ensemble modeling is the state-of-the-art technique to conduct structural model
    comparison studies of 1D process-based models and evaluate the uncertainty around
    future projections. An early ensemble modeling initiative was the LakeMIP project
    which was initiated in 2008. During the first phase, several 1D models were compared,
    including a completely mixed model, FLake, Hostetler, CLM4-LISSS, MINLAKE96, LAKE,
    Simstrat, and LAKEoneD. The models were evaluated by using data from a shallow,
    turbid lake in Germany. The results showed that all eight models generally captured
    diurnal and seasonal variability of LSWT reasonably well. However, some models
    were not able to realistically reproduce temperature stratification in summer
    (Stepanenko et al., 2013). Further, Stepanenko et al. (2014) compared five of
    the eight models (FLake, CLM4-LISSS, LAKE, LAKEoneD, and Simstrat) in a small
    boreal lake and Thiery et al. (2014) compared seven of the eight models in a large,
    deep tropical lake. These ensemble modeling studies improved the ability to project
    future water temperature and thermal structure of lakes at global or regional
    scales, while further improvement is still needed to better serve the community
    regarding the impact of climate change on lake ecosystems (e.g., water quality,
    lake biogeochemistry). An emerging issue of ensemble modeling is that the computational
    implementation is quite challenging and time-consuming in case of setting up and
    running multiple lake models as emphasized in Soares and do Carmo Calijuri (2021),
    which might need better cooperation within the scientific community. To facilitate
    and ease the use of ensemble modeling, and to create a common framework for ensemble
    modeling of 1D process-based lake models, the R package LakeEnsemblR was developed
    by Moore et al. (2021). Users of LakeEnsemblR can run ensembles of 1D lake models
    (FLake, GLM, GOTM, Simstrat, MyLake) from the same input data, and the results
    are compiled in a single output file (Moore et al., 2021). Example ensemble studies
    include the evaluation of a lake''s physical properties (Lake Kinneret, Israel)
    using an ensemble of 1D hydrodynamic lake models (Gal et al., 2020); an ensemble
    of vertical 1D hydrodynamic lake models used to calculate water temperature, stratification,
    and ice cover for the reservoir Lichtenberg in Germany (Feldbauer et al., 2022);
    and the impact of increased winter salt loads on spring overturn and summer stratification
    evaluated using an ensemble approach (Ladwig, Rock, & Dugan, 2021). As an example,
    we used LakeEnsemblR to simulate the thermal structure of Lough Feeagh (Ireland)
    over a period of 2 years. The lake has a surface area of 3.9 km2, a surface elevation
    of 11 m, a mean depth of 14 m, and a maximum depth of 46 m. The results are shown
    in Figure 7 for the three 1D lake models GLM, GOTM, and Simstrat, and refer to
    the calibration period running all models on an hourly time step. Figure 7 illustrates
    the distribution of various performance metrics throughout the water column, showcasing
    the evaluation of each metric at specific depths. We also calculated the same
    metrics across all depths (red lines in Figure 7) to emphasize the importance
    of considering depth-specific metrics to better understand the strengths and weaknesses
    of each model (see Section 18 and Table 2 for a detailed explanation of each metric).
    Overall, both methods of calculating performance metrics lead to similar conclusions
    for this lake: (a) Simstrat outperforms GLM and GOTM, (b) GLM exhibits lower overall
    performance with the highest error at the depth of the metalimnion but also overall
    smaller performance differences between the epilimnion and hypolimnion, (c) Simstrat
    and GOTM clearly demonstrate a decline in performance in the hypolimnion compared
    to the epilimnion. Generally, model performance degrades the further a grid cell
    is located away from the surface boundary conditions. Especially integral energy
    models (i.e., GLM) have shortcomings replicating heat transport at the location
    of the highest density gradient, hence the metalimnion. In this example, turbulence-based
    models (i.e., GOTM and Simstrat) performed better at the metalimnion, but their
    performance deteriorated in the hypolimnion. A framework for ensemble modeling
    of climate change impacts on lakes worldwide has been established through the
    lake sector initiative in the Inter-Sectoral Impact Model Intercomparison Project
    (ISIMIP, Golub et al., 2022). The framework included 11 lake models and observed
    data for lakes worldwide, which permits lake thermal studies at a global scale.
    The ISIMIP results highlighted the potential impacts of future climate change,
    such as increased summer stratification periods (Woolway, Sharma, et al., 2021),
    a global future increase in methane production (Jansen et al., 2022), a decrease
    of winter ice thickness in lakes in the Northern hemisphere (Grant et al., 2021),
    increased future intensity of heatwaves acting on the lake surface (S. Wang et
    al., 2021), and the magnitude of global heat uptake in inland waters (Vanderkelen
    et al., 2020). Multi-lake-model simulations are increasingly used to obtain robust
    assessments of freshwater ecosystem responses to climate change. A key challenge
    for understanding historic and future change in the thermal structure of lakes
    is to quantify the contribution of natural versus human-induced external forcing.
    With large ensemble simulations (i.e., a set of projections starting from different
    initial conditions but produced with a single model and identical external forcing),
    the human-induced and naturally varying variations in lake temperature can be
    quantified (Deser et al., 2020). Most notably, using large ensembles, one can
    investigate the anthropogenic and natural variability components of lake temperature
    changes, enabling (a) identification of the anthropogenic signal itself and (b)
    a timescale over which such changes will emerge over natural variability (Woolway
    et al., 2022). Recent studies have highlighted the benefit of using large ensemble
    simulations to investigate lake ice responses to natural and anthropogenic drivers
    (L. Huang et al., 2022), but future studies could also consider evaluating lake
    temperature responses to climate change within a large ensemble. 6.5 Adaptive
    Water Management In reservoirs, the transport of mass, dissolved or suspended
    compounds, and overall energy is affected by the presence of a dam. Upstream-downstream
    transfers of water mass and properties, including water temperature, is often
    complex to quantify and to model due to the existence of withdrawals, diversions
    and inflows. Selective withdrawals, for example, are structures allowing the release
    of water from different depths in the reservoirs and are used to meet downstream
    water temperature and, more generally, water quality targets and mitigate undesirably
    warm or undesirably cool peak events (i.e., thermopeaking). A common way to operate
    a selective withdrawal system is by releasing warmer water from a shallower depth
    to mitigate the impact of cold and abrupt peak flow during the period of hydropower
    generation in summer compared to the case of a fixed hypolimnetic withdrawal,
    which is the most common situation (Kim & Choi, 2021). Another more sophisticated
    alternative is to modulate the use of the different withdrawals distributed along
    the water column during the year, which can relieve the impact of climate warming
    on downstream river water temperatures in summer and the consequent decline of
    cold water species'' habitats but at the cost of warmer stream temperatures in
    winter (Rheinheimer et al., 2015). In any case, a proper design of a selective
    withdrawal system requires knowledge of depth-specific thermal dynamics of the
    reservoir, which can be obtained with one of the modeling tools discussed above
    (in many previous studies the 2D lake model CE-QUAL-W2 has been used). The modeling
    of selective withdrawal not only allows to optimize its operation to meet the
    downstream temperature targets but provides a quantification of the impact of
    these operations on stratification, mixing, and water flow in the reservoir, which
    have obvious implications for its ecology and environment. Some research suggests
    that a deep withdrawal decreases the strength of summer stratification, thus improving
    oxygen availability and reducing the accumulation of nutrients in the hypolimnion
    (Duka et al., 2021; U. Kobler et al., 2018) (note that e.g., Weber et al., 2017
    highlighted how withdrawal from the epilimnion on the other hand strengthened
    thermal stratification and decreased hypolimnetic oxygen availability). However,
    complexities of the reservoir regulation scenarios make this finding difficult
    to generalize. The different types of control structures (e.g., stoplog gate,
    temperature-control curtain; He et al., 2023), and the peculiarities of each hydropower
    network, are often complicated by the presence of a cascade of reservoirs (H.
    Wang et al., 2023) or pumped-storage plants (U. Kobler et al., 2018). The release
    of water from a reservoir (e.g., for power generation, dam spills) can cause the
    displacement of fish from the reservoir, a process known as fish entrainment.
    Fish entrainment can directly result in injury or death of individuals, as well
    as reduce the abundance of upstream populations and increase the abundance of
    downstream populations (Coutant & Whitney, 2000). The seasonal temperature stratification
    and fish habit use of the reservoir result in different entrainment vulnerability
    for fish species. Recommendations were provided for the reservoir operators to
    maximize operations while mitigating and compensating for fish entrainment. In
    this respect, lake modeling is a valuable tool to support the design and operation
    of reservoirs characterized by selective withdrawals and pumped-storage plants,
    which could be considered when carrying out environmental impact assessments for
    an effective management of the water resources. 6.6 Coupling of Climate and Lake
    Models To investigate the impact of climate change on the thermal dynamics of
    lakes, it is essential to couple climate and lake models, which can be achieved
    through one-way or two-way coupling. In one-way coupling, time series of climate
    variables that are relevant for lake thermal dynamics, such as air temperature,
    are extracted and used as inputs for the lake model to simulate future lake thermal
    conditions (see e.g., Fang & Stefan, 1996; Gula & Peltier, 2012; Mi et al., 2020;
    Sterckx et al., 2023). In one-way coupling, downscaled meteorological forcing
    from global circulation or regional climate models is often required, which can
    be obtained using various methods available in the literature, such as the change
    factor method (Piccolroaz, Zhu, et al., 2021), empirical-statistical approaches
    (Gutiérrez et al., 2019), and deep learning methods (Baño Medina et al., 2022).
    Our ability to understand future lake conditions has improved as climate modeling
    and downscaling techniques have improved in recent decades (Alizadeh, 2022). However,
    large uncertainty remains in some future climate features (e.g., precipitation)
    that will impact lake thermodynamics (Alizadeh, 2022; Lopez-Cantu et al., 2020).
    Further, it is important to recognize that while connecting lake temperature models
    to climate projections can help us understand future lake conditions, both data-driven
    and process-based models can perform poorly when trying to predict in previously
    unseen conditions (e.g., Sungmin et al., 2020). One advantage of data-driven models
    is their flexibility to incorporate and learn from a wider range of data that
    might help inform the model on how lakes might respond to future change (e.g.,
    data from multiple lakes across latitudes that might represent future conditions).
    Carefully considering evaluation criteria and model setup is critical for predicting
    responses to climate change (Madsen et al., 2014). While one-way coupling is the
    simplest and most widely used approach, it only considers the impact of climate
    change on lake thermal dynamics and does not account for feedbacks from lakes
    to the atmosphere. As a result, important interactions between the two systems
    may not be captured. Two-way coupling solves this issue by fully integrating the
    climate and lake models, enabling the feedback impact of lake thermal processes
    on regional climate to be considered (Guo et al., 2022; Mallard et al., 2014).
    A typical example of two-way coupling is given by the models sensu Henderson-Sellers
    (1985), and other examples have been implemented in the Community Land surface
    Model (CLM-Lake) (Oleson et al., 2013), Common Land Model (CoLM-Lake) (Dai et
    al., 2018), Community Earth System Model (CESM-LISS) (Lawrence et al., 2019; Subin
    et al., 2012), and the Weather Research and Forecast model (WRF-Lake) (Gu et al.,
    2015). Two way coupling has been widely used to study lake/reservoir thermal dynamics,
    lake ice coverage, lake–atmosphere interactions, and climate change effects on
    lakes (see e.g., Guo et al., 2022, 2023a; Gu et al., 2015; F. Wang et al., 2019;
    Wu et al., 2020; X. Wang et al., 2023; Xiao et al., 2016). Another example is
    the FLake model, which has been coupled in one-way with ERA40 reanalysis data
    (Martynov et al., 2010) and WRF (Gula & Peltier, 2012), and incorporated as a
    lake parameterization scheme into the Consortium for Small-scale Modeling—COSMO
    model (Mironov et al., 2010) and coupled in two-way model configurations with
    WRF (Mallard et al., 2014). FLake and Hostetler models have been successfully
    coupled with the Canadian Regional Climate Model—CRCM5, demonstrating that considering
    lakes in simulated climate can have a significant impact, as shown by comparing
    multi-decadal simulations with and without lakes. The models have performed well
    in simulating temperate subgrid lakes and large shallow lakes, especially for
    FLake (Martynov et al., 2012). However, the performance of both 1D lake models
    in large deep lakes has been relatively poor due to the lack of representation
    of 3D processes such as upwelling and downwelling, horizontal circulation, and
    thermal bar formation. In this regard, efforts have been made in the last decades
    to fully couple 3D lake models with climate models for regional studies, especially
    because large and deep lakes exhibit substantial seasonal lags in temperature
    and fluxes compared to other landscapes (León et al., 2007). Multi-column 1D lake
    models for example, based on Hostetler (Notaro et al., 2013) and Simstrat (Gaillard
    et al., 2022), have been proposed as computationally-efficient alternatives to
    full 3D lake models. Multi-column models consider 1D flat-bottom columns distributed
    spatially across a 2D domain and neglect horizontal heat and mass transport, thus
    achieving a first level spatially-resolved representation of 3D thermal dynamics.
    However, recent studies in the Great Lakes region have overcome these limitations
    by proposing a two-way coupled 3D lake-ice–climate modeling system called the
    Great Lakes-Atmosphere Regional Model, which significantly outperformed previous
    coupled 1D simulations (Xue et al., 2017). This system has also been used to provide
    high-resolution ensemble projections of climate change, highlighting its potential
    for regional climate studies (Xue et al., 2022). 7 Conclusions This review offers
    a valuable resource for scientists working in limnology and hydrology who seek
    to understand lake water temperature modeling and its potential applications.
    It provides an overview of the subject matter and highlights important considerations
    for future research and application, making it useful for both seasoned modelers
    and those new to the field. The review covered the physics governing thermal dynamics
    in lakes, different sources of observational water temperature data, available
    lake water temperature models, model performance evaluation, and emerging modeling
    approaches. Based on our analysis we identified some key areas that future efforts
    could prioritize, including improving forecasting capabilities also through the
    development of digital twins of lakes, evaluating lake water temperature responses
    to climate change using large ensemble models and advancing toward two-way coupling

  description: Remote sensing (RS) offers great possibilities to acquire data for
    early determination of crop performance, which is essential for water and nitrogen
    (N) management. The objective of this study was to assess the nutritional and
    water status of different wheat genotypes (Triticum aestivum L.) by means of vegetation
    indices (VIs) derived from ground-level hyperspectral measurements, plant traits
    retrieved by coupling a radiative transfer (RT) model with a 3-layer neural network,
    and thermal data. To this end, two field experiments were conducted in central
    Spain during 2018–2021, using two wheat genotypes (Cellule and Nogal) under three
    N and two irrigation doses. Pigment and polyphenolic compound measurements were
    carried out with a Dualex® device, canopy reflectance (400–900 nm) was measured
    with a handheld spectroradiometer, and thermal indicators were assessed using
    a thermal camera at different wheat growth stages. The nitrogen nutrition index
    (NNI) at flowering and the grain yield (GY) and grain N concentration (GNC) at
    harvest were determined. The spectral reflectance measurements were used to calculate
    VIs, and the PROSAIL-PRO radiative transfer model was used to retrieve chlorophyll
    (Chl) content and leaf area index (LAI). In addition, the water deficit index
    (WDI) and canopy–air temperature difference (Tc-Ta) were used to assess the water
    status of wheat. Our results show that predicted Chl and VIs built with red-edge
    bands obtained the best agreement with NNI (R2 ≥ 0.60 at flowering in Cellule
    and R2 = 0.60 at medium milk in Nogal) and GNC (R2 ≥ 0.45 and 0.38 in Cellule
    and Nogal respectively). The GY was best assessed with VIs combining near infrared
    (NIR) / visible bands and NIR / red-edge bands (R2 ≥ 0.74 and RMSE ≤ 903 kg ha-1
    at watery ripe in Cellule; R2 ≥ 0.56 and RMSE ≤ 791 kg ha-1 at the end of stem
    elongation in Nogal) than by the predicted plant traits. The best differentiation
    between genotype performance was achieved by predicted Chl and LAI retrieved through
    PROSAIL-PRO and the canopy Chl content index, showing that the Cellule genotype
    had a stronger response than Nogal to N application. Similarly, the WDI and Tc-Ta
    proved that the more drought-resistant genotype (Cellule) suffered lower water
    stress than Nogal. This study highlights that the combination of optical and thermal
    data improved the assessment of the agronomic parameters studied (R2 increased
    by 23 % and RMSE decreased by 8 %), suggesting its potential for conducting irrigation
    and N fertilization management.

    indicesHyperspectral sensors 1. Introduction Nitrogen (N) and water are the most
    important limiting factors in agricultural production around the world (Mueller
    et al., 2012). However, the increase of these resources in agriculture in the
    last decades lead to an increase in environmental and economic costs (Lassaletta
    et al., 2014). Because of the pollutant effect of N mineral fertilizers (Galloway
    et al., 2008) and because of water scarcity in Mediterranean areas due to climate
    change (Olesen et al., 2007), genotypes that maximize the efficiency of N and
    water use are being explored. Several crop management strategies and technologies
    have been suggested to improve N fertilizer application and water use (Arregui
    and Quemada, 2008, Pancorbo et al., 2021). Among these technologies, ground-level
    sensors, remote sensing, and radiative transfer models (RTMs) have shown potential
    for assessing crop N status (Camino et al., 2018, Fu et al., 2021), while thermal
    sensors show promise in estimating crop water requirements (Panigada et al., 2014;
    García-Tejero et al., 2018). Nevertheless, specific approaches remain necessary
    for optimizing the use of optical and thermal sensors to determine the different
    performances between genotypes, allowing N and water applications to be adjusted
    according to the individual genotype demand. Different sensors can estimate the
    N status of crops based on the optical properties of the crop at certain wavelengths
    (Mistele and Schmidhalter, 2008). For instance, hand-held sensors such as leaf-clip
    chlorophyll (Chl) meters allow removing external noise to provide accurate estimation
    of leaf Chl and N concentration in wheat (Lemaire et al., 2008). They have also
    demonstrated to be good estimators of crop N status such as the nitrogen nutritional
    index (NNI) (Ravier et al., 2017). However, Chl readings can be affected by different
    stress conditions (drought, salinity, nutritional deficiency), limiting their
    accuracy in detecting the N status of crops (Fox and Walthall, 2008). Because
    of this, simultaneous measurements of polyphenolic compounds (Phen) that are produced
    by the crop under stress conditions are used to improve the estimation of N status
    (Tremblay et al., 2012). However, these leaf-clip instruments have limitations
    for large-scale application, since their measurements are time-consuming. One
    potential solution is the use of remote sensing technologies to collect reflectance
    at the canopy level. Light reflected in the visible region is directly related
    to Chl pigments in the leaf tissues, and near-infrared (NIR) reflectance is influenced
    by internal leaf structure (Haboudane et al., 2002). Therefore, reflectance is
    often used to calculate vegetation indices (VIs) that employ mainly bands located
    in the visible and near-infrared (VNIR) region to estimate crop N status (Daughtry
    et al., 2000). Several studies have used hyperspectral VIs for cereal crop N management
    and for assessing grain yield (GY) and grain N concentration (GNC) (Fitzgerald
    et al., 2010, Gabriel et al., 2017). Nevertheless, these VIs have some disadvantages
    because they require appropriate modeling to mitigate the shadow and structural
    effects on canopy reflectance (Zarco-Tejada et al., 2005). Moreover, the Chl distribution
    in leaves changes with plant structure and age (Li et al., 2013), which can be
    a source of discrepancy between leaf-clip and remote sensing sensors. To overcome
    these limitations, RTM inversions improve transferability and robustness when
    compared to the VIs calculated by remote sensing (Jacquemoud et al., 2009, Li
    et al., 2018). The use of RTMs plays a crucial role in bridging the gap between
    observations of canopy reflectance and the underlying leaf-level biochemical and
    biophysical properties. They offer a powerful means to explicitly represent how
    electromagnetic radiation interacts with the complex structures of vegetation,
    shedding light on critical aspects of plant health and structure (Féret et al.,
    2021). In agricultural and remote sensing studies, the PROSAIL-PRO model is widely
    chosen for its ability to capture the complexities of crop canopies (Berger et
    al., 2018), providing researchers with valuable insights into crop health and
    growth. The PROSAIL-PRO model couples the PROSPECT-PRO leaf optical properties
    and the SAILH canopy bidirectional models to retrieve biochemical and biophysical
    parameters simultaneously (Jacquemoud et al., 2009). In this context, several
    authors found that Chl (Botha et al., 2010, Camino et al., 2018, Raya-Sereno et
    al., 2022) and leaf area index (LAI) (Li et al., 2018) predicted by PROSAIL-PRO
    were reliable plant indicators to estimate wheat N status. To establish consistent
    methodologies for wheat crop analysis across various trials and phenological stages,
    the integration of biophysical models with spectral measurements is crucial. In
    wheat crop studies, especially when estimating leaf-level biochemical and biophysical
    parameters, an inversion approach combines traditional cost function-based methods
    and hybrid machine learning (ML) techniques to derive biochemical compounds and
    structural properties. These modeling techniques entail resampling reflectance
    simulations to match optical sensor or field measurements, using plant traits
    as input variables, as demonstrated in prior studies (Combal et al., 2002, Camino
    et al., 2018). The traditional approach, relying on cost functions like Root Mean
    Square Error (RMSE) to estimate crop parameters by comparing observed and simulated
    reflectance bands, presents significant implementation challenges. These challenges
    stem from the intricacies of the model itself (Ding et al., 2016) and well-documented
    issues associated with ill-posed inverse problems (Combal et al., 2002). However,
    we can overcome these limitations by employing RTM hybrid inversions (Upreti et
    al., 2019, Verrelst et al., 2019, Chaabouni et al., 2021). These ML inversion
    methods, including support vector regression, artificial neural networks (ANN),
    and random forest regression, play a pivotal role in unraveling the complex relationship
    between spectral measurements and vegetation''s intrinsic characteristics through
    simulation. These ML approaches facilitate the development of transferable methodologies
    for wheat crop analysis, mitigating the issues initially pointed out by Combal
    et al. (2002) and circumventing the unintended blending of plant traits not found
    in the target crops. In this regard, the RTM hybrid inversion has proved more
    accurate in biophysical parameter estimation (Verger et al., 2011, Liang et al.,
    2016) and has better computational efficiency (Yang et al., 2016) than other retrieval
    strategies, offering the opportunity to improve N management and to determine
    the performance of different genotypes. On the other hand, thermal imaging is
    a powerful strategy for measuring plant water stress, including spatial temperature
    patterns linked with transpiration at the canopy level (Berni et al., 2009). Canopy
    temperature is directly associated with the transpiration of plants, well-watered
    crops maintain a lower canopy temperature whereas limited transpiration due to
    water scarcity results in higher temperature (Tilling et al., 2007). The normalized
    difference between canopy and air temperature is used to detect plant water status
    (Jackson et al., 1981), however, under partially vegetated conditions it is not
    possible to assess the water status. To overcome this limitation, Moran et al.
    (1994) developed the water deficit index (WDI) based on both, the canopy-air temperature
    difference and a proxy of the real vegetation cover such as NDVI. Furthermore,
    Sadras (2004) showed that biomass production is determined by both N and water
    availability, defined as co-limitation. This indicates that the response of genotypes
    to water and N is greater than their response to each factor separately and implies
    that strategies for maximizing crop production should ensure that both resources
    are equally available. The N–water co-limitation is a known difficulty since it
    is proven that water stress reduces the ability to assess crop N status through
    VIs (Cossani and Sadras, 2018). Nevertheless, some research found that the planar-domain
    VI canopy chlorophyll content index (CCCI) reduced the soil background noise and
    therefore was the best indicator of crop N status with minimal water effects (Fitzgerald
    et al., 2006, Bronson et al., 2017, Pancorbo et al., 2021). Moreover, Gonzalez-Dugo
    et al. (2012) showed that soil N transport and root N uptake are limited by water.
    In this sense, the assessment of N uptake and water stress dynamics in genotypes
    with different stress tolerance is crucial for understanding the genotype × environment
    interaction. Therefore, from the plant`s physiological perspective, combining
    thermal and optical images could be used to support N and water management simultaneously.
    The main goal of this work was to evaluate the potential of ground-level sensors
    and remote sensing tools to disentangle the nutritional and water status in wheat
    genotypes with different drought tolerance. To this end, we assess the ability
    of the leaf-clip Dualex® sensor and thermal sensors, hyperspectral VIs obtained
    by a spectroradiometer, and plant traits retrieved by RTM hybrid inversion to:
    (i) track NNI, GY and GNC, and water status, (ii) distinguish different genotype
    response, and (iii) determine whether the combination of the studied plant traits
    and the optical and thermal indicators improves overall accuracy in NNI, GY, and
    GNC assessment and the ability to disentangle N and water stress. 2. Materials
    and methods 2.1. Field experimental design The data were collected during 2020
    and 2021 in two field experiments located in La Canaleja research station (Madrid,
    Spain). The soil at the field site is classified as Calcic Cambisol (World Reference
    Base for Soil Resources, 2014) and the regional climate as Mediterranean with
    dry summers (Köppen, 2007). The first experiment (Exp 1) was conducted from 2018
    to 2020, and the second (Exp 2) from 2019 to 2021, and both follow a common design
    to study crop N and water status under different N and irrigation doses. The experimental
    design includes pea (Pisum sativum L.) and barley (Hordeum vulgare L.) as precedent
    crops which were randomly assigned in 16 plots (20 × 12.5 m each plot). At the
    end of May in both experimental years or seasons, the residues from precedent
    crops were buried into the soil. At the beginning of November, the experiment
    was sown (160 kg ha-1 seed rate) with four bread wheat (Triticum aestivum L.)
    genotypes on the same plots as the precedent barley and pea to create a split-plot
    design with four replications and 192 plots (2.8 × 4.2 m). In both seasons, three
    N fertilization treatments were established on the wheat plots at the end of January,
    and half of the plots were irrigated and the other half was kept in rainfed conditions
    in March to create two water availability scenarios. Borders were incorporated
    between irrigated treatments and precedent crops (Fig. 1). In this study, the
    sensor data were collected in two genotypes, Cellule and Nogal, which were selected
    based on their different root system characteristics and water stress tolerance
    (Touzy et al., 2019). This section provides a description of the field experiments

    experiment with selected genotypes (1 and 4) marked in red, two different precedent
    crops (Barley and Pea), three different N levels (N0, N1, and N2), and two water
    levels (Irrigated and Rainfed) in 2020 and 2021 (b). Numbers represent the different
    genotypes (1 = Cellule and 4 = Nogal). Calcium ammonium nitrate fertilizer (27
    % N) was applied to establish the three N levels by broadcasting fertilizer to
    the plots at tillering (GS22) and at the beginning of stem elongation (GS32).
    Throughout the article wheat growth stages (GS) follow a digital scale (Meier,
    1997). The treatments established in each wheat subplot were (Fig. 1): N0 that
    received 0 kg N ha-1, N1 (reduced rate of 75 kg N ha-1 (after barley) or 25 kg N
    ha-1 (after pea)) and N2 (recommend rate of 125 kg N ha-1 (after barley) or 75 kg N
    ha-1 (after pea)). To determine the effect of water availability, irrigation was
    provided by a mobile cannon sprinkler system in half of the plots in both experimental
    seasons. Exp 1 was irrigated with 15 mm of water (12/03/2020) and 30 mm (18/05/2020
    and 25/05/2020), whereas Exp 2 received seven irrigation events with 10 mm for
    each one (16/03/2021, 30/03/2021, 07/04/2021, 17/05/2021, 18/05/2021, 24/05/2021
    and 31/05/2021). Total water supply was 449 mm during Exp 1 and 399 mm during
    Exp 2 for the wheat crop. More details on the experiment management can be found
    in Raya-Sereno et al. (2023) and in Supplementary S1. 2.2. In situ data acquisition
    2.2.1. Agronomic data The agronomic variables GY and GNC were analyzed in our
    study because they determine crop productivity and quality. Moreover, the NNI
    calculation is crucial for agronomic management, as several studies have shown
    that it is the best indicator to determine the crop N status, therefore its estimation
    with remote sensing will allow us to implement proper nutrient management. To
    determine these variables, wheat plants were hand-harvested (0.25 × 0.25 m) at
    flowering (GS65) in N0 and N1-barley and N2-pea plots. A subsample of the spikes
    and the rest of aboveground biomass was dried in an oven (48 h at 65 °C), weighed
    and ground for subsequent analysis. At harvest, the wheat GY was recorded with
    an experimental combine that harvested the central strip (4.2 m2) of each plot.
    A grain subsample from each plot was taken for laboratory analysis, dried in an
    oven (48 h at 65 °C), weighed and ground. The grain subsamples were used to determine
    the GNC of each plot analyzing them with the Dumas combustion method (LECO FP-428
    analyzer, St. Joseph, MI, USA). The biomass and grain subsamples were taken randomly
    considering the representativeness of each plot. Nitrogen concentration ( %N)
    was determined in a subsample of the wheat spikes and the rest of the biomass
    by the Dumas method. The NNI was calculated as the ratio between the current %N
    of aerial biomass and the critical wheat N concentration ( %Nc) that enables maximum
    growth for a given biomass (Justes et al., 1994). The %Nc was obtained from Pancorbo
    et al. (2021). 2.2.2. Pigments and leaf area index Readings with the Dualex® Scientific
    (Force-A, Orsay, France) sensor were performed at the beginning of stem elongation
    (GS32), end of stem elongation (GS39), and flowering (GS65) in both experiments.
    Six measurements were taken in the central area of each plot on all sampling dates,
    and their average was considered the representative value for the analyses. Dualex®
    readings were collected at the uppermost fully developed leaf, on the upper leaf
    side and avoiding midribs. The Dualex® is a leaf-clip sensor that measures Chl
    content as the difference between the light transmitted at the far-red (710 nm)
    and the infrared wavelength (850 nm) (Tremblay et al., 2012). Furthermore, the
    leaf epidermal anthocyanin (Anth) and flavonoid (Flav) content can be measured
    with this sensor, which are based on the effect of Chl fluorescence. Chlorophyll
    fluorescence is generated by a reference red LED and by a specific light (green
    for Anth and UV for Flav). The ratio of Chl fluorescence emitted under red and
    green excitation presents a proxy of Anth, and under red and UV it presents a
    proxy of Flav content per unit of leaf area. The ratio between Chl and Flav is
    used to calculate the nitrogen balance index (NBI), which assesses the N status
    of crops (Cartelat et al., 2005). Finally, the leaf area index (LAI) was determined
    using a portable AccuPAR Ceptometer Model LP-80 (Meter Group, Inc., USA) at flowering
    (GS65). Six measurements were taken in the middle of each plot between 11:00 and
    12:00 GMT to eliminate the effect of solar elevation on light interception and
    under clear-sky conditions. The direct incident photosynthetically active radiation
    (PAR; 400–700 nm) was measured non-destructively above and below the plant canopy
    with this device to estimate LAI using leaf angle distribution parameter ꭓ and
    gap-fraction analysis (Ramírez et al., 2012). 2.2.3. Hyperspectral optical data
    Canopy reflectance measurements were collected with a portable HR-512i® spectroradiometer
    (Spectra Vista Corporation, Poughkeepsie, NY, USA) over wheat under clear-sky
    conditions at different wheat growth stages: beginning of stem elongation (GS32),
    end of stem elongation (GS39), full flowering (GS65), watery ripe (GS71), and
    medium milk (GS75). These growth stages were selected as the maximum N uptake
    by wheat occurs during the stem elongation (GS30–39) (López-Bellido et al., 2006).
    Thereafter, this N is mobilized during flowering (GS60–69) and will determine
    the number of grains per unit area during grain filling (GS71–79) (Jeuffroy and
    Bouchard, 1999). The canopy reflectance was taken at 1 m over the top of canopy
    surface at nadir orientation, and six spectra were measured in the central area
    for each plot. Their average was utilized to determine reflectance spectra per
    plot. The fiber optics provided a 25° field of view (FOV), and the reflectance
    measurements were acquired with a spectral resolution of 3.2 nm full-width at
    half-maximum. All spectra were resampled to 1 nm over the 340- to 1075-nm wavelength,
    resulting in an effective range of 400–900 nm due to noise levels at both ends
    of the spectrum. The dark current was recorded and subtracted before each canopy
    reflectance measurement. Readings were standardized and optimized after every
    25–30 min using a calibrated 99 % reflective Spectralon reference panel (25 ×
    25 cm) (Spectralon, Labspehere Inc., North Sutton, NH, USA). The hyperspectral
    vegetation indices (VIs) were calculated with the average reflectance spectra
    acquired for each experimental plot. Different VIs were calculated with regard
    to: (i) crop canopy structure and (ii) Chl (Table 1). Usually, VIs associated
    with crop structure are those most sensitive to canopy structural variations,
    including leaf area index (LAI), canopy type, plant physiognomy and canopy architecture
    (Gamon et al., 1995), and they are usually based on the ratio between NIR and
    visible bands. Whereas VIs related to Chl content are focused on visible and red-edge
    bands. The strong absorption caused by photosynthetic pigments decreases the intensity
    of reflectance in the visible region. It has been shown that Chl content and reflectance
    measured in the red and green spectral regions have a high linear relationship
    (Gitelson et al., 2003). This occurs because Chl a and b pigments strongly absorb
    in the blue (400–500 nm) and red (600–700 nm) spectra regions, while the reflectance
    in the green (500–600 nm) wavelengths is higher. The red-edge region (700–780 nm)
    in healthy vegetation shows a rapid change in leaf reflectance caused by the strong
    absorption of pigments in the red and scattering in the NIR. Therefore, the reflectance
    in the region has been shown to be sensitive to crop Chl. Additionally, the canopy
    Chl content index (CCCI) was calculated to overcome some of the limitations (shadow
    and soil background effects) attributed to structural indices (Li et al., 2012).

    canopy temperature was measured using an FLIR SC305® thermal camera (FLIR Systems,
    Wilsonville, OR, USA) at GS65, GS71, and GS75, when maximum evapotranspiration
    differences between irrigated and rainfed plots were expected. The thermal camera
    has a resolution of 320 × 240-pixel, 25° × 18.8° FOV, 18 nm focal length, an accuracy
    of ± 2 °C and thermal sensitivity of < 0.05 °C at 30 °C. The camera was installed
    on a pole, and an individual, nadir-oriented image was captured in the center
    of each plot. Moreover, at the borders of the experiment, the dry and wet bare
    soil temperature was measured. Measurements were taken 1.8 m above the canopy
    surface. The average of the central area (circle of 1 m diameter that corresponded
    to ≈ 10,200 pixels) was used to determine the surface temperatures of each plot.
    Additionally, a hygrometer placed next to the thermal camera monitored the air
    temperature and relative humidity. Capture and image analyses were carried out
    with the ThermaCAM Researcher Professional 2.1 software. Thermal measurements
    were employed for the calculation of the difference between canopy and air temperature
    (Tc-Ta) (Jackson et al., 1981) and the WDI (Moran et al., 1994) to determine the
    water status. For each sampling date, the WDI was calculated with a two-dimensional
    space defined by plotting on the x-axis the Tc-Ta and on the y-axis the NDVI (i.e.,
    a VI related to the vegetation cover) to mitigate the influence of soil background
    in temperature and crop water status estimation. In this two-dimensional space,
    the vegetation index temperature (VIT) trapezoid was established by plotting four
    vertices that correspond to: (i) well-watered full-cover vegetation, (ii) water-stressed
    full-cover vegetation, (iii) wet bare soil, and (iv) dry bare soil. To define
    the full canopy cover vertices (i and ii), the baselines suggested by Idso et
    al. (1981) for post-heading winter wheat and the maximum NDVI obtained in all
    spectral measurements were used. To define the wet and dry bare soil vertices
    (iii and iv), the soil average temperature obtained with the thermal camera together
    with the minimum NDVI extracted from the bare soil portion located on the experiment
    edge were used. The minimum water stress line corresponds to the connection between
    well-watered full-cover vegetation (i) and wet bare soil (iii), and the maximum
    water stress line between water-stressed full-cover vegetation (ii) and dry bare
    soil (iv). Finally, the WDI was calculated by dividing the distance to the maximum
    and minimum water stress lines (Moran et al., 1994). 2.3. Combination of optical
    and thermal data Optical VIs and thermal indicators were combined based on the
    new methodology shown in Fig. 2, which allows the data to be split into four populations.
    For this, the thermal indicators (WDI or Tc-Ta) were plotted on the y-axis and
    different VIs on the x-axis. The WDI threshold was determined with the empirical
    approach defined by Clarke (1997), who split the data into three zones depending
    on water stress. In this approach a two-dimensional trapezoid was defined by plotting
    percent cover in y-axis and Tc-Ta in x-axis. Four vertices were established corresponded
    to: (i) the minimum temperature expected for a well-watered crop canopy, (ii)
    maximum, non-transpiring canopy temperature, (iii) minimum (wet) soil temperature,
    and (iv) maximum (dry) soil temperature. The connection between the vertices (i)
    and (iv) split the trapezoid in a diagonal indicating that values falling on this
    line are plants that transpire freely but no evaporation is occurring from the
    soil surface. Any value falling to the right of this diagonal indicates that the
    canopy temperature must be greater than the minimum and the crop must therefore
    be experiencing some degree of water deficiency. The other diagonal of interest
    run from (i) to the bottom line at Tc-Ta = 0. When soil evaporates at a rate lower
    than its potential, its surface temperature tends to be higher than the surrounding
    air temperature. Any data point falling to the left of this reference line indicates
    a soil surface wet. Assuming that the exposed soil part of a mixed surface will
    dry out before the root zone, the trapezoid can be divided into three zones: zone
    I (wet soil surface and maximum transpiration), zone II (dry soil surface but
    still no reduction in transpiration), and zone III (dry soil surface and some
    degree of plant water deficiency). Download : Download high-res image (44KB) Download

    (vegetation index) indicators. In our study, zone I and zone II were considered
    as no water stress, whereas zone III was considered as water stress. On the other
    hand, the Tc-Ta threshold was fixed considering water stress when Tc-Ta > 0 °C
    and no water stress when Tc-Ta < 0 °C. Finally, to establish the x-axis threshold,
    the average VI value for the optimal N treatment (N2: 125 kg N ha-1 after barley
    precedent crop) was used. The number of plots used for establishing the x-axis
    was 32, corresponding to 2 genotypes × 2 water levels × 4 replications × 2 seasons.
    N2-barley treatment was selected as the optimal N treatment because it received
    N fertilizer that was known to be available for the crop at the time of the measurements.
    This methodology enables clustering of the data in four quadrants (Fig. 2): quadrant
    I represents high nutritional and water stress; quadrant II, low nutritional stress
    and high-water stress; quadrant III, low nutritional and water stress; and quadrant
    IV, high nutritional stress and low water stress. 2.4. Estimation of plant traits
    using an RTM hybrid inversion An RTM hybrid ML inversion was used to estimate
    leaf Chl and LAI using reflectance simulations derived from the coupled PROSAIL-PRO
    model. These variables were selected because they can be estimated correctly with
    our spectral region (400–900 nm). The PROSAIL-PRO model integrates the PROSPECT-PRO
    leaf reflectance model (Féret et al., 2021) and the 4SAIL turbid medium canopy
    RTM (Verhoef and Bach, 2007). The PROSAIL-PRO model operates in a forward mode
    to simulate the reflectance of wheat canopies. This simulation is based on the
    input of biochemical compound and structural parameters, along with the specific
    viewer angles between our optical measurements and the position of the sun observed
    during the field camping described in Table 2. The PROSAIL-PRO model essentially
    serves as a tool for generating simulated reflectance values, allowing us to understand
    how wheat canopies interact with light under different conditions and configurations.
    These simulations play a vital role as training data, contributing to derive more
    accurate and refined biochemical compounds and structural parameters. By leveraging
    this training data, we enhance our ability to precisely characterize and model
    the behavior of wheat canopies in response to varying environmental and observational
    conditions. Table 2. Main input parameters and their ranges used in the PROSAIL-PRO

    Reflectance soil 0.30–1 [-] [-] This study The PROSPECT-PRO version is capable
    of separating N-based constituents from the carbon-based constituents. The 4SAIL
    model (Suits, 1971) estimates the bidirectional reflectance of a canopy. To derive
    leaf chlorophyll and LAI, we leverage the simulated reflectance and optical indices
    as input features within a 3-layer ANN regressor model. The model is structured
    as a neural network, comprising an input layer, a hidden layer, and an output
    layer interconnected through neuron-like units. The number of neurons in the hidden
    layer was 128, and the same value was selected for the samples used in each iteration
    of training (batch size). The maximum number of training iterations (epochs) was
    defined as 200, and a dropout of 0.1 was established to prevent overfitting. Additionally,
    we chose the Adam optimization algorithm to update the weights during training.
    For the other tuning parameters, we utilized the default values established in
    the model. These parameters are strategically fine-tuned to optimize the model''s
    performance in accurately estimating Chl and LAI values from the input data. The
    RTM hybrid inversion was fed using simulated canopy reflectance spectra in the
    400–900 nm range which are the spectral region covered by the hyperspectral sensor
    used in the field campaign. For this, a look-up table (LUT) of 200,000 simulations
    was generated (Table 2), where inputs ranges were constrained according to field
    measurements (i.e., Dualex® readings and LP-80 Ceptometer®) and to previous wheat
    studies found in the literature (Berger et al., 2018, Danner et al., 2021, Camino
    et al., 2022, Raya-Sereno et al., 2022). In the LUT, we randomly varied all parameters
    using a uniform distribution, except Chl, for which a Gaussian distribution was
    preferred based on field data. Additionally, to avoid unrealistic trait combinations
    and alleviate ill-posed issues (Combal et al., 2002), we incorporated assumptions
    of correlations between specific traits, such as Chl and carotenoids. In this
    study, all reflectance spectra simulated were convoluted to the bandwidth of the
    HR-512i® spectroradiometer. The spectral region between 400- to 800-nm was used
    to assess the Chl, whereas the 400- to 900-nm to estimate LAI. In the ML approach,
    specific bands (410, 525, 550, 650, 671, 710, 851) were chosen based on the bands
    used for monitoring Chl with the leaf-clip sensor Dualex (at 710 and 850 nm),
    as well as the outcomes derived from a sensitivity analysis of PROSAIL-PRO in
    the VNIR region with respect to Chl and LAI (Berger et al., 2018). For implementing
    the RTM hybrid inversion, the resampled simulated spectra were split into two
    groups that included a training sample with 80 % of simulations and a remaining
    for the testing. As a second step, a spectral scaling was applied on the simulated
    reflectance. The spectral scaling was implemented to provide a more stable and
    faster convergence during the learning process, improve the quality and reliability
    of results, enhance model performance, and ensure that the study''s findings are
    applicable to a broader range of scenarios. To this end, we used the: (i) standardization
    scaling, (ii) min–max scaling, and (iii) a robust scaling based on the interquartile
    range (IQR) transformations. As the next step, values were normalized to the 0–1
    range by performing a feature scaling on the dependent variable, to ensure that
    the predictions and measurements range was similar between them. To guarantee
    the robustness, improve the realism, and generalization capability of the ML model
    we added a spectral Gaussian noise in the simulated reflectance. The spectral
    transformation was performed with the “hsdar” R package (Lehnert et al., 2020),
    and the RTM hybrid inversion was implemented with the “keras” python library (Chollet,
    2015). Then, the training partition for the dataset was used for 10-fold cross-validation
    to select the best parameters and to avoid overfitting. In each iteration, the
    stepwise variance inflation factors (VIF) were used to identify collinearity among
    bands and VIs and remove the least significant ones. The variables with a VIF
    threshold ≤ 10 were kept for the model (Hair et al., 1995). Lastly, the ML model
    was retrained with the remaining bands together with the NDVI, OSAVI, NG, DCNI,
    and NDRE indices. The performance of the ML method for retrieving individual plant
    traits was evaluated by calculating the root mean square error (RMSE), the mean
    bias error (MBE), the mean absolute percentage error (MAPE), the mean absolute
    error (MAE), the mean squared error (MSE), and the coefficient of determination
    (R2) against the test set (Supplementary S2 and S3). For each plant trait, the
    best results were those based on these performance metrics in the validation step.
    The ML approach was applied in Python (version 3.10; Python Software Foundation,
    2021). 2.5. Estimation of agronomic variables To assess the potential of Chl and
    LAI retrieved by RTM hybrid inversion, ground-level measurements and VIs, the
    R2 and RMSE were used to study the relationship between the remote sensing readings
    and the NNI, GY, and GNC agronomic variables. Since most of the N in crops is
    stored in the green leaves during the growing season, both Chl and LAI are very
    sensitive indicators of changes in crop N requirements (Wood et al., 2003). Moreover,
    plant N is mobilized during flowering and subsequently translocated to the grain,
    therefore these variables also enable the assessment of the final GNC (Kichey
    et al., 2007). To assess the accuracy of the VIs and plant traits estimated by
    the RTM hybrid inversion in predicting NNI, GY, and GNC, the Cate–Nelson statistical
    procedure was implemented (Cate and Nelson, 1971) due to its simplicity, versatility
    and interpretability. c For this, normalized readings were calculated as the plot
    average value divided by the optimal N treatment average value (N2: 125 kg N ha-1
    after barley precedent crop) to determine the percentage of error in the prediction.
    The number of plots used for establishing the x-axis was 32, corresponding to
    2 genotypes × 2 water levels × 4 replications × 2 seasons. N2-barley treatment
    was selected as optimal N treatment because it received N fertilizer that was
    known to be available for the crop at the time of the measurements. In the Cate–Nelson
    procedure, horizontal values (NNI, GY, or GNC) and vertical (VIs or plant traits
    retrieved by the RTM hybrid inversion) critical levels divided the data into two
    groups that include N-deficient treatments (lower left quadrant and N-sufficient
    treatments (upper right quadrant). Moreover, the upper left quadrant and the lower
    right quadrant are considered outliers. The accuracy of VIs or plant traits retrieved
    by the RTM hybrid inversion is described as a percentage of outliers from the
    total number of points. Subsequently, the Cate–Nelson procedure was modified to
    fix the horizontal critical level for agronomic variables to be 1, and the vertical
    line was displaced to keep the smaller number of outliers. Finally, plant traits
    estimated by RTM hybrid inversion and VIs were combined with water status data
    using a multiple linear regression model to build new indices for NNI, GY, and
    GNC assessment. Version 4.1.1. of R software was used to perform the statistical
    analyses (R core Team, 2021). 3. Results 3.1. Estimation of traits and agronomic
    variables Among parameters retrieved by the RTM hybrid inversion, when all growth
    stages were analyzed together, the predicted Chl was significantly correlated
    with Chl measured with Dualex® (Chl-D), with a better relationship obtained for
    Cellule (R2 = 0.65) than Nogal (R2 = 0.58) (Fig. 3a). This discrepancy between
    measured and predicted Chl may be due to the fact that Chl measured was taken
    on the uppermost fully developed leaf, whereas PROSAIL-PRO model uses leaf and
    canopy parameters. The relationship between predicted LAI and measured LAI was
    significant; however, the explained variability was lower than for Chl (Fig. 3b).
    Therefore, the VIs calculated from the spectra, together with thermal indicators,
    parameters predicted by the RTM hybrid inversion, and ground-level sensor measurements,
    also showed different performances in assessing agronomic variables. Download

    hybrid inversion (predicted Chl) and measured with Dualex® (Chl-D) at the beginning

    predicted by the RTM hybrid inversion (predicted LAI) and measured with Ceptometer®
    (measured LAI) at flowering (b) in Cellule and Nogal genotypes. For the NNI, the
    best relationships were obtained for predicted Chl and the Chl-related indices
    at the early growth stages (GS32 and GS39). At more advanced growth stages (GS65,
    GS71 and GS75) the best assessment was obtained by the Chl-related indices (NDRE,
    DCNI and CCCI) and structural indices (OSAVI and NG). Moreover, a stronger relationship
    was obtained for predicted Chl with NNI than for Chl measured with Dualex® (Table
    3, Supplementary S4). For the Cellule genotype, the CCCI was the VI that obtained
    the highest correlation at GS39 (R² = 0.50 and RMSE = 0.22) along with DCNI at
    GS65 (R² = 0.68 and RMSE = 0.16) and NDRE at GS71 (R² = 0.55 and RMSE = 0.21).
    For the Nogal genotype, the CCCI and DCNI indices at GS32 (R² ≥ 0.49 and RMSE
    = 0.25) showed the best correlation, whereas at GS75 the NDRE, OSAVI and NG achieved
    the best performance (R² = 0.60 and RMSE = 0.25) (Table 3, Supplementary S4).

    pigment achieved a better relationship than the measured Chl-D for predicting
    GY (Table 3, Supplementary S4). At the GS32, the strongest relationship with GY
    was obtained by the CCCI, whereas the structural indices increased their relationships
    as the growth stages advanced. In the Cellule genotype, the best correlation was
    obtained by the structural indices NDVI and OSAVI at GS71 (R2 ≥ 0.74 and RMSE
    ≤ 903 kg ha-1). For the Nogal genotype, the same indices (NDVI and OSAVI) showed
    the best relationship at GS39 (R2 ≥ 0.56 and RMSE ≤ 791 kg ha-1). Lastly, the
    overall performance of Dualex® measurements, plant traits retrieved by RTM hybrid
    inversion, and VIs for GNC assessment was worse than for NNI and GY, with great
    variability between growth stages and genotypes. At the early growth stages, the
    predicted Chl along with the Dualex® measurements (Chl-D and NBI-D) obtained a
    better relationship with GNC than the rest of the VIs. However, the best relationship
    was achieved by the CCCI in both genotypes at GS65 and GS71 (R2 = 0.54 and RMSE
    = 0.17 in Cellule and R2 ≥ 0.42 and RMSE ≤ 0.22 %N in Nogal), whereas the rest
    of the VIs, Dualex® measurements, parameters predicted by the RTM hybrid inversion,
    and thermal indicators showed weaker relationships at advanced growth stages after
    flowering (Table 3, Supplementary S4). Hence, although there were some differences
    in the correlations achieved with the different indicators (observed and predicted
    traits, optical VIs and optical-thermal indices) between the two genotypes studied,
    the results emphasize that predicted Chl and the planar domain index CCCI together
    with VIs that link NIR-red edge or NIR-red achieves a better correlation than
    the rest of the VIs in assessing NNI, GY, and GNC. Due to the differences observed
    in Cellule and Nogal genotypes, the Cate–Nelson methodology that normalized data
    allowed us to join the two genotypes and experiments in order to achieve the critical
    values that guarantee a minimum number of errors in the prediction. For NNI, flowering
    was the growth stage where the percentage of error was smaller for most of the
    parameters and indices studied. Between them, the predicted Chl by the RTM hybrid
    inversion, CCCI, and DCNI obtained the lowest error (≤ 23 %) and reduced the value
    achieved by Chl measured with Dualex® (24 %) (Fig. 4a). Conversely, for GY the
    best growth stages were between GS39 and GS71, with the structural indices (NDVI,
    OSAVI, and NG) together with those of Chl (NDRE and R750/R710) achieving the lowest
    errors at GS71 (≤ 19 %) (Fig. 4b). Moreover, all parameters and indices analyzed
    in this study showed a lower percentage of error than the best result obtained
    with Chl-D (32 %), even at growth stages where the percentage of error was high.
    Finally, for GNC the best results were attained by DCNI at GS39 (17 %), followed
    by CCCI at flowering (18 %) and by predicted Chl at GS39 and GS65 (19 %). Nevertheless,
    in this case, no parameter or index was able to reduce the error reached by Chl
    from Dualex® (17 %) (Fig. 4c). Download : Download high-res image (301KB) Download

    at the beginning of stem elongation (GS32), end of stem elongation (GS39), flowering
    (GS65), watery ripe (GS71), and medium milk (GS75) for all genotypes in both experiments.
    The dotted black line indicates the percentage of error obtained by measured chlorophyll
    at flowering. Overall, these results agreed with the linear relationships observed
    in agronomic variables (Table 3). Predicted Chl, CCCI, and DCNI yielded the lowest
    percentage of error and the highest R2 value in the assessment of NNI and GNC,
    whereas structural indices achieved the lowest percentage of error in the GY assessment.
    Additionally, the thermal indicators obtained a high percentage of error in all
    growth stages studied. 3.2. Differentiation of genotypes response Differences
    in reflectance spectra between genotypes were observed from the beginning of stem
    elongation to medium milk in irrigated and rainfed plots (Fig. 5; Supplementary
    S5 and S6). Moreover, the drought response of both genotypes under the two water
    levels was clearly distinguished by the VIT, showing the highest differentiation
    at watery ripe stage (Fig. 6). Download : Download high-res image (149KB) Download

    plotted in the two-dimensional space formed by the normalized vegetation index
    (NDVI) and the canopy–air temperature difference (Tc-Ta). Colored circles are
    the mean value of each plot. The analysis of both experiments together also allowed
    a solid differentiation of genotype performance to be obtained (Fig. 7 and Supplementary
    S7 and S8). At the beginning of stem elongation, when the different water levels
    were not yet established, the best distinction was detected by predicted LAI,
    with Cellule achieving a higher performance than Nogal in all treatments analyzed
    except in Barley-N0 (Fig. 7d). At the end of stem elongation, the detection of
    treatments improved in the predicted Chl and LAI together with Chl-related VIs.
    In general, in irrigated conditions, the genotype Cellule showed a greater response
    than Nogal in all treatments, except in Barley-N0 where Nogal achieved the highest
    value (Fig. 7n, t and Supplementary S8 q, t and w). A similar performance was
    established in rainfed conditions, with Nogal obtaining the lowest value in all
    cases. However, the readings from the ground-level sensors together with the structural
    indices NDVI and OSAVI showed the worst detection of treatments, probably due
    to the saturation effect (Supplementary S7). At flowering, the differences decreased
    and it was only possible to distinguish between treatments with predicted Chl
    (Fig. 7c and o), and with CCCI and DCNI (Fig. 7i and u; Supplementary S7r) showing
    the same performance as that observed at GS39. Download : Download high-res image

    or 75 kg N ha-1 in wheat sown over precedent barley or pea treatment. Letters

    NA: data not available. At GS32 all plots were considered rainfed, as irrigation
    started at GS39. Similarly, the thermal indicators also showed different genotype
    performances at the various growth stages studied. At flowering, only Tc-Ta differentiated
    genotypes in pea precedent treatments (Supplementary S7y), with Cellule in irrigated
    conditions obtaining the lowest value and Nogal in rainfed conditions, the highest.
    At watery ripe and medium milk, the rainfed level obtained higher WDI and Tc-Ta
    than the irrigated level. In both growth stages, when the differentiation was
    possible, the genotype Nogal showed higher water stress than Cellule (Fig. 7k
    and l; Supplementary S7z and S8aa). Overall, these results were consistent with
    the predicted parameters and VIs, indicating that the genotype Cellule showed
    a higher ability to take up N and water than Nogal. 3.3. Improved assessment of
    agronomic variables by combining optical and thermal data The hyperspectral VIs
    and thermal indicators (WDI or Tc-Ta) were combined using a multiple linear regression
    model to implement new indicators for NNI, GY, and GNC prediction. The assessment
    capacity was improved when the agronomic variables were estimated based on the
    VIs and WDI or Tc-Ta combination rather than with the VIs alone, as the R2 increased
    (average of 20 % for NNI, 29 % for GY and 19 % for GNC) and the RMSE decreased
    (average of 7 % for NNI, 10 % for GY and 8 % for GNC) (Table 4 and Supplementary
    S9). Moreover, the best assessment was achieved by similar VIs observed in simple
    relationships (Table 3 and Supplementary S4). Table 4. Coefficient of determination

    0.52 0.34 0.39 0.26 0.24 0.46 0.44 0.55 0.55 0.34 0.46 For NNI, a slight improvement
    was achieved by the combination of Tc-Ta with DCNI (R2 = 0.69 and RMSE = 0.15)
    compared with DCNI alone (R² = 0.68 and RMSE = 0.16) in Cellule at GS65, whereas
    a similar response was found by thermal indicators combined with structural indices
    (NDVI, OSAVI, and NG) and NDRE (R2 ≥ 0.60 and RMSE ≤ 0.25) compared with simple
    indices (R2 = 0.60 and RMSE = 0.25) in Nogal at GS75 (Table 3, Table 4 and Supplementary
    S4 and S9). By contrast, the improvement for GY prediction was greater than for
    NNI. Like the results presented in Table 3, the structural indices NDVI and OSAVI
    combined with thermal indicators yielded the best results in both genotypes. In
    Cellule, these indices combined with WDI attained a value of R2 ≥ 0.78 and RMSE
    ≤ 795 kg ha-1 at GS71 stage, while the results obtained by indices alone were
    lower (R2 ≥ 0.74 and RMSE ≤ 903 kg ha-1). Similar results were found in Nogal
    at GS65, with the combined indices showing a value of R2 ≥ 0.57 and RMSE ≤ 830 kg ha-1
    versus R2 ≥ 0.42 and RMSE ≤ 960 kg ha-1 for the indices alone (Table 3, Table
    4 and Supplementary S4 and S9). For GNC assessment, the CCCI combined with thermal
    indicators obtained the best relationships in both genotypes in all growth stages,
    except in Nogal at GS75, where DCNI stood out. In Cellule, CCCI combined with
    thermal data achieved the maximum value at GS71 and GS75 (i.e., R2 ≥ 0.60 and
    RMSE = 0.16 %N, whereas CCCI alone obtained the best results at GS65 and GS71
    (R2 = 0.54 and RMSE = 0.17 %N). Conversely, the improvement in Nogal was lower
    than in Cellule, with the best relationships reached by thermal indicators combined
    with CCCI at GS71 (i.e., R2 = 0.55 and RMSE = 0.19 %N compared to R2 = 0.53 and
    RMSE = 0.22 %N obtained by CCCI alone) (Table 3, Table 4 and Supplementary S4
    and S9). Finally, a more complex linear regression model that included the predicted
    Chl + predicted LAI + VIs + thermal information was implemented at GS65 (Fig.
    8; Supplementary S10). In most cases, the assessment of agronomic variables improved
    by introducing plant traits predicted by the RTM hybrid inversion (Supplementary
    S10) compared with optical and thermal data (Table 4). Although the coefficients
    of determination were higher in the genotype Cellule (R2 ≥ 0.66 for NNI; R2 ≥
    0.67 for GY and R2 ≥ 0.49 for GNC), the genotype Nogal achieved greater improvements
    than Cellule. For NNI and GNC in Nogal, the best assessment was obtained by predicted
    Chl + predicted LAI + CCCI + WDI (R2 = 0.54) compared to CCCI + WDI data (R2 =
    0.45 and 0.46 for NNI and GNC respectively) (Fig. 8a and b). However, for GY prediction,
    the improvement was lower than for NNI and GNC, obtaining predicted Chl + predicted
    LAI + CCCI + WDI a R2 = 0.58 (Fig. 8c) and predicted Chl + predicted LAI + OSAVI
    + WDI the best result (R2 = 0.60 and RMSE = 840 kg ha-1) (Supplementary S10).

    (b, e) watery ripe (GS71), and (c, f) medium milk (GS75) for all genotypes in
    both experiments. W1 is rainfed and W2 is irrigated treatments. N0 received 0 kg N
    ha-1 as fertilizer; N1, 75 or 25 kg N ha-1; and N2, 125 or 75 kg N ha-1 in wheat
    sown over precedent barley or pea treatment. Black lines represent the threshold
    limits established at different growth stages to split the data into four quadrants:
    I represents high nutritional and water stress; II, low nutritional stress and
    high water stress; III, low nutritional and water stress; and IV, high nutritional
    stress and low water stress. CCCI stands for canopy chlorophyll content index,
    WDI for water deficit index and Tc-Ta for canopy–air temperature difference. A
    different performance was found when WDI or Tc-Ta was used on the y-axis. When
    WDI was considered as a predictor of water stress, a better distinction between
    rainfed and irrigated plots was found than when using Tc-Ta. At GS65, the lowest
    water stress between all growth stages studied was observed, since most of the
    values were in quadrants III and IV. However, other values that correspond to
    rainfed plots were detected in quadrant I, indicating their high water and nutritional
    stress (Fig. 9a). At GS71 and GS75, the differences between rainfed and irrigated
    plots were strong, showing that most of the rainfed plots suffered water stress
    (quadrant I and II), whereas the irrigated plots did not (quadrant III and IV)
    (Fig. 9b and c). Nutritional stress was also detected in all growth stages, with
    the values in quadrants II and III showing no nutritional stress and in quadrants
    I and IV showing nutritional stress. The relationship between NNI and CCCI at
    GS65 (Supplementary S110) confirms that in 79 % of the observations the crop nutritional
    status was assessed accurately, whereas in 7 % of the plots the nutritional status
    was overestimated. A similar performance was shown by the predicted Chl (Supplementary
    S110b), whereas the predicted LAI evaluated 73 % of the observations correctly
    (Supplementary S110c). Overestimation occurred mainly in irrigated plots, where
    the higher reflectance in the NIR may boost the CCCI. Underestimation of the crop
    nutritional status (i.e., CCCI below threshold but NNI > 1) occurred in both,
    irrigated and non-irrigated, but tended to be more relevant when the wheat suffered
    water stress. Lastly, when Tc-Ta was considered as a predictor of water stress,
    there was a linear trend with CCCI, making it difficult to differentiate between
    irrigated and rainfed plots (Fig. 9). Additionally, the detection of nutritional
    stress follows a similar pattern to that with WDI, showing some non-fertilized
    (N0) plots in quadrants II and III (low nutritional stress) and some fertilized
    plots (N1 and N2) in quadrants I and IV (high nutritional stress) (Fig. 9e and
    f). Overall, these results demonstrated that water stress was clearly detected
    when using WDI, whereas nutritional stress was distinguished when using WDI or
    Tc-Ta. 4. Discussion Maintaining a good nutritional and water status of wheat
    is essential to ensure high yields and adequate protein values for quality wheat
    grain (Quemada and Gabriel, 2016). However, the difficulty to detect simultaneously
    the N and water crop status, along with the diversity of environmental conditions,
    had led to search for a robust strategy capable of managing wheat under different
    interactions and locations. The ability of remote sensing to predict agronomic
    variables and detect different responses between genotypes is relevant since it
    can provide crop N and water status. However, most studies have traditionally
    based on the application of optical or thermal indices, while only a few studies
    have investigated the combinations of both (Quemada et al., 2014, Pancorbo et
    al., 2021) or with RTM (Longmire et al., 2022) to improve the prediction. 4.1.
    Estimation of agronomic variables In this work, we compared two genotypes with
    distinct root systems (Touzy et al., 2019) under different management approaches
    that include various precedent crops, N fertilizer treatments, and water availability.
    Despite the interactions related with the combinations of the multiple factors,
    a better evaluation of the GY was achieved by the planar domain index CCCI at
    the beginning of stem elongation, whereas at most advanced growth stages the structural
    VIs (NDVI and OSAVI) showed the best correlations in both genotypes. These results
    agree with most of the literature, demonstrating that when differences in canopy
    cover and soil background are present, the CCCI performs better than structural
    indices (Fitzgerald et al., 2010, Cammarano et al., 2014). However, although rainfed
    and irrigated levels were established in the current study, a similar ground cover
    was observed in all plots at advanced growth stages, probably because both experimental
    years had a very rainy spring. For this, the structural indices obtained better
    performance than CCCI as predictors of GY between the end of stem elongation and
    watery ripe, which were consistent in Cellule and Nogal genotypes. The best NNI
    and GNC assessment was achieved with Chl retrieved by the RTM hybrid inversion,
    along with CCCI and VIs that include red-edge region in both genotypes. In general,
    this parameter and VIs followed the same trend of high correlations with NNI even
    at early growth stages (GS32 and GS39) when corrective fertilizer actions can
    be conducted (Arregui et al., 2006). Similarly, previous research found that CCCI
    is the best VI for crop N status prediction in wheat (Fitzgerald et al., 2010,
    Li et al., 2012, Pancorbo et al., 2021), followed by VIs with red-edge bands (Chen
    et al., 2010, Prey and Schmidhalter, 2019, Raya-Sereno et al., 2021). Furthermore,
    our study also demonstrated that Chl predicted with RTM hybrid inversion had a
    stronger relationship with crop N status than field measurements performed with
    Dualex®, emphasizing the RTM potential and Chl as the best consistent pigment
    for assessing N (Herrmann et al., 2010, Tremblay et al., 2010). By contrast, the
    GNC assessment was the most erratic among agronomic variable predictions, obtaining
    lower correlations than NNI and GY in all cases. Some authors reported that the
    GNC predictability from Chl meters improved when the readings were taken in post-anthesis,
    probably due to the flag-leaf providing N more directly to the spike during the
    grain-filling period (López-Bellido et al., 2004, Le Bail et al., 2005). However,
    the limitations of predicting GNC can be explained because GNC is determined not
    only by the crop-absorbed N before flowering but also by the translocation during
    the grain-filling period (Borghi et al., 1997). The climate conditions during
    grain filling can vary greatly from year to year, particularly in a Mediterranean
    climate, and the water stress and thermic stress determine the GNC rather than
    the accumulated N in the aerial biomass (Savin et al., 2019). In line with this,
    Li-Hong et al. (2007) showed that grain protein content could not be reliably
    assessed by optical VIs because they could not predict N translocation into the
    grain. Moreover, the weak relationship obtained by the RTM hybrid inversion predicted
    parameters and VIs could be also explained by the spectral limitations of the
    equipment. In this study we only used the VNIR spectral region, whereas including
    the short-wave infrared region (SWIR) has been shown to be more accurate in GNC
    prediction since it involves N absorption features (Curran, 1989). In agreement
    with this statement, Camino et al. (2018) found that combining NIR (850 nm) and
    SWIR (1510 nm) bands in a VI obtained the best prediction of N concentration,
    whereas VIs focused on VNIR showed the weakest relationship. Similarly, Féret
    et al. (2021) identified that the spectral regions from 2100 nm to 2174–2250 nm
    in the PROSPECT-PRO RTM model were optimal for protein retrieval. The quantification
    of error in the predictions is important when deciding which analysis method needs
    to be applied (Arregui et al., 2006). Along these lines, the Cate–Nelson statistic
    methodology enabled a better differentiation between N-sufficient and N-deficient
    treatments than the R2 for GY and NNI. A novel finding in our study highlights
    that the percentage of error was lower in all predicted parameters and VIs than
    in Dualex® (32 %) for GY prediction during all growth stages. Additionally, this
    statement also applies to the predicted Chl and CCCI (22 %) and DCNI (23 %) for
    NNI assessment at flowering, compared with 24 % reached by Dualex®. Although these
    percentages of error are not adequate for field application (Quemada et al., 2014),
    these results emphasize that remote sensing technology can be more accurate than
    leaf-clip sensors for GY and NNI assessment. On the contrary, for GNC assessment,
    all of the predicted parameters and VIs analyzed showed a worse performance than
    Dualex®. A possible explanation for this is that the leaf-clip sensor Dualex®
    measured transmittance directly on the leaf, whereas the rest of the measurements
    were indirectly calculated based on canopy reflectance. In this sense, the canopy
    reflectance can be more affected by external factors such as soil background and
    shadows, whereas Dualex® overcomes these limitations (Muñoz-Huerta et al., 2013).
    Moreover, several research has revealed that, at the leaf level, there is a strong
    connection between photosynthetic capacity and N content (Jacquemoud et al., 2009).
    By contrast, at the canopy scale, reflectance patterns represent the integrated
    effects of leaf water content, biochemical constituents, and various components
    of the plant structure (Roberts et al., 2004). 4.2. Distinguish different genotype
    response On the other hand, the determination of different behaviors between genotypes
    was improved using parameters predicted by the RTM hybrid inversion, together
    with Chl-related VIs and thermal indicators, compared with Dualex®. At GS32 and
    GS65, the determination of genotype performance by VIs was poorer than at GS39.
    At the early stage, the reason behind this limitation could be that soil reflectance
    dominates remotely sensed observations (Haboudane et al., 2002), whereas at the
    flowering stage it could be due to the loss of sensitivity related to the saturation
    of reflectance at high canopy cover (Cammarano et al., 2014). Moreover, several
    studies have demonstrated the limitations of VIs (Zarco-Tejada et al., 2005) since
    these optical indicators are based on occasional crop observations at certain
    growth stages. These observations also depend on the specific atmospheric conditions
    at the time of the sensor measurements. However, LAI predicted by RTM hybrid inversion
    was the best-performing trait at the beginning of stem elongation, and the same
    applies to predicted Chl at flowering. Having said that, this study demonstrates
    that parameters retrieved by RTM hybrid inversion are needed for better genotypes
    differentiation due to the most robust quantification of the parameters compared
    to hyperspectral indices. Moreover, the ANN approach also offers advantages in
    our study due to its ability to handle any linear or non-linear relationship between
    input and output variables (May et al., 2011), allowing to simulate numerous spectra
    under different physiological crop conditions. This fact significantly improves
    the transferability of our model, which once calibrated and trained correctly
    could be potentially applied to different genotypes, growth stages and scenarios,
    overcoming the constraints found in VIs. Additionally, when differentiation between
    genotypes was possible, Cellule obtained a higher response than Nogal in rainfed
    and irrigated conditions. Moreover, the performance of thermal indicators (WDI
    and Tc-Ta) also showed that Cellule had higher tolerance to water stress. Therefore,
    Cellule showed a higher capacity for water and nutrient extraction, which was
    reflected in the genotype performance determination and is in accordance with
    the agronomic results found in Raya-Sereno et al. (2023), highlighting its better
    adaptability to stress conditions. 4.3. Combination of optical and thermal indicators
    to improve estimation of agronomic variables It is important to underline that
    N and water are linked in multiple ways and that sensor readings may be affected
    by N and water stress concurrently (Quemada and Gabriel, 2016). In our study,
    multiple linear combinations between optical and thermal data improved the assessment
    of NNI, GY, and GNC in the growth stages between flowering and medium milk. Similarly,
    when optical and thermal data were jointly implemented, Quemada et al. (2014)
    provided better GY prediction in maize and Pancorbo et al. (2021) better NNI prediction
    in wheat. Likewise, Longmire et al. (2022) found a value of R2 = 0.80 for the
    prediction of grain protein content in bread wheat when physiological, structural,
    and thermal data were included in ML models. However, although the combination
    of both sensors has successfully been used to improve the assessment of agronomic
    variables, the simultaneous management of N fertilization and irrigation still
    remains a challenge. Therefore, in this study a new methodology based on split
    quadrants was proposed. In this context, it is important to preserve high soil
    water content during two sensitive growth stages for providing greater GY: stem
    elongation and milky filling stages (Liao et al., 2008). With our methodology,
    clear differences between rainfed and irrigated plots were observed after anthesis,
    which would allow irrigation to be adjusted during grain filling. Additionally,
    better detection was achieved when we used WDI than Tc-Ta, confirming the potential
    of combining optical and thermal measurements to mitigate the soil background
    effect (Moran et al., 1994). Nutritional stress detection was also demonstrated
    with this methodology, although some uncertainty probably associated with the
    crop water status remained an issue. Thus, this research confirms that combining
    optical and thermal data from remote sensing technology contributes to N fertilization
    and irrigation adjustment after wheat flowering, but more research with different
    environmental conditions and at earlier growth stages is needed to test its applicability.
    5. Conclusions Optical and thermal remote sensors provide useful information for
    identifying wheat N and water status. Chlorophyll content predicted by the RTM
    hybrid inversion, together with the planar domain index CCCI and VIs that include
    red-edge bands, showed the best results in assessing NNI (R2 ≥ 0.60 at GS65 in
    Cellule and at GS75 in Nogal) and GNC (R2 ≥ 0.54 at GS65 in Cellule and R2 ≥ 0.53
    at GS71 in Nogal), whereas the structural indices (NDVI and OSAVI) showed the
    best results for assessing GY in both genotypes (R2 ≥ 0.74 at GS71 in Cellule
    and R2 ≥ 0.56 at GS39 in Nogal). Additionally, these parameters and VIs proved
    to yield the lowest percentage of error in the prediction (≤ 23 % for NNI, ≤ 19
    % for GY and GNC) and were able to establish different performances between genotypes,
    offering the possibility to adjust N fertilization to crop demand. When the distinction
    was possible, the Cellule genotype showed a higher response than Nogal, indicating
    its great ability to take up N. Moreover, the thermal indicators also detected
    that Cellule suffered lower water stress than Nogal under rainfed and irrigated
    conditions, indicating that Cellule has better adaptation to climate change conditions.
    Our results also indicated that retrieved plant traits along with optical and
    thermal combinations improve the assessment of NNI, GY, and GNC in all growth
    stages studied, as the R2 increased by an average of 23 % and the RMSE decreased
    by and average of 8 %. Additionally, the new split-quadrant methodology that combines
    WDI with CCCI allowed us to distinguish between rainfed and irrigated plots at
    watery ripe and medium milk stages and to assess the nutritional stress from flowering
    to medium milk stage. Additionally, WDI was a better water stress indicator than
    Tc-Ta. Therefore, the optical and thermal remote sensing combination showed great
    potential to improve the assessment of agronomic variables and to adjust N and
    irrigation simultaneously. However, more research with different genotypes and
    contrasting environmental conditions is needed to demonstrate its robustness.

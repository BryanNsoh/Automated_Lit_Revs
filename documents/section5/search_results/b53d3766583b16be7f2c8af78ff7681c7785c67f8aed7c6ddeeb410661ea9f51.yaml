  description: Water is the most valuable natural resource on earth that plays a critical
    role in the socio-economic development of humans worldwide. Water is used for
    various purposes, including, but not limited to, drinking, recreation, irrigation,
    and hydropower production. The expected population growth at a global scale, coupled
    with the predicted climate change-induced impacts, warrants the need for proactive
    and effective management of water resources. Over the recent decades, machine
    learning tools have been widely applied to various water resources management-related
    fields and have often shown promising results. Despite the publication of several
    review articles on machine learning applications in water-related fields, this
    review paper presents for the first time a comprehensive review of machine learning
    techniques applied to water resources management, focusing on the most recent
    achievements. The study examines the potential for advanced machine learning techniques
    to improve decision support systems in the various sectors within the realm of
    water resources management, which includes groundwater management, streamflow
    forecasting, water distribution systems, water quality and wastewater treatment,
    water demand and consumption, hydropower and marine energy, water drainage systems,
    and flood management and defence. This study provides an overview of the state-of-the-art
    machine learning approaches to the water industry and how they can be used to
    ensure water supply sustainability, quality, and flood and drought mitigation.
    This review covers the most recent related studies to provide the most recent
    snapshot of machine learning applications in the water industry. Overall, LSTM
    networks have been proven to exhibit reliable performance, often outperforming
    ANN models, traditional machine learning models, and established physics-based
    models. Hybrid ML techniques have exhibited great forecasting accuracy across
    all water-related fields, often showing superior computational power over traditional
    ANNs architectures. In addition to purely data-driven models, physical-based hybrid
    models have also been developed to improve prediction performance. These efforts
    further demonstrate that Machine learning can be a powerful practical tool for
    water resources management. It provides insights, predictions, and optimisation
    capabilities to help enhance sustainable water use and management and improve
    socio-economic development, healthy ecosystems and human existence.

    is the most essential natural resource for human life that is used in various
    ways, which are keys for human socio-economic development. Water is used for drinking,
    bathing, recreational activities, agriculture, hydropower production, and more.
    Although water covers around 71% of the earth''s surface, only about 2.5% is freshwater
    (USGS, 2019). Therefore, appropriate water resources management is crucial to
    a well-developed society. As a complex system of nature, aquifers are constantly
    changing. Hence, our accessibility to freshwater is continually changing, too.
    In its water scarcity report (United Nations Water, 2020), the United Nations
    estimates that by 2025, 1.8 billion people will be living in water-scarce areas,
    highlighting the urgent need for innovative solutions within the water sector.
    Engineers and decision-makers constantly look for promising methods to address
    climate change and its consequential impacts. As temperatures rise rapidly, more
    extreme weather is observed. One of the most concerning consequences is flooding,
    with over one billion people worldwide predicted to live in cities with a risk
    of catastrophic flood levels due to climate change (Rentschler and Salhab, 2020).
    A natural disaster, such as a devastating level of flooding, can cost lives, property,
    crop destruction and much more. The damaging effects of flooding can have a long-lasting
    impact on the affected area, which can be challenging to recover from. On a global
    scale, the exploitation and consumption of water resources often need to be better
    managed. An important aspect of water resources management is providing solutions
    for optimal resource use, ensuring overexploitation does not occur, and equipping
    water resources managers with the appropriate decision-support tools to plan for
    potential shortages of effective management. Conventionally, physical models have
    assisted decision-makers in enabling a sustainable and optimal use of water resources.
    However, the relationships between hydrological, meteorological and water table
    levels are well known to be very complex. Additionally, these models require a
    larger number of data, and such data tend to be very expensive and/or scarce,
    particularly in developing countries. In recent years, Machine Learning (ML) has
    demonstrated its high efficiency and practicability for water resources management
    compared to traditional models due to its capability to handle different sources
    simultaneously and its lower cost and time requirements. ML has been applied to
    water resources management in various ways to improve the monitoring, prediction,
    and sustainable use of water resources. ML models are often trained on historical
    hydrological data for forecasting. The main hydrological data commonly used as
    input features include discharge, rainfall, water table level, temperature, evapotranspiration,
    land use, and pumping rates. Preference has recently been given to data-driven
    models over physically based or conceptual forecasting models, which have the
    potential to unravel the non-linear input-output relationship and produce reliable
    predictions of physical systems, even without prior knowledge of the underlying
    physical relationships and the catchment information. There are numerous examples
    of how ML can be applied to water resources management. For example, ML can analyse
    historical usage data in a water distribution system, provide optimum water allocation,
    predict future demand, and help detect system leaks (e.g. Shahra et al., 2019).
    With the availability of historical data on groundwater levels, ML has been widely
    used for future predictions of water level dynamics, which helps in the management
    of groundwater reservoirs (e.g. Pathak et al., 2021; Ghosh et al., 2022; Kochhar
    et al., 2021; Teimoori et al., 2023). ML can also be used for streamflow forecasting
    (e.g. Cheng et al., 2020; Mehedi et al., 2022; Dehghani et al., 2023; Akbarian
    et al., 2023). There is increasing pressure on irrigation water demand for agriculture
    use, which is expected to double by 2050 (The Food and Agriculture Organization
    of the United Nations, 2017), with only limited resources. ML has been extensively
    used to narrow this gap and to develop smart irrigation practices (e.g. Chen et
    al., 2021; He et al., 2022). Another example where ML has proved successful is
    the water quality prediction. This has been crucial given that water pollution
    has worsened significantly in most rivers in Africa, Asia, and Latin America (United
    Nations Environment Programme, 2016). This has prompted many studies focusing
    on the applications of ML to estimate and predict water quality (Zhou, 2020).
    This study presents an overview of the recent water resources-related studies
    that implemented ML algorithms, with the main aim being to answer the following
    research question: which ML algorithms have been used in water resource management
    in recent years, and what were the most effective approaches adopted for forecasting
    application? This provides the most up-to-date and relevant information pertaining
    to the application of ML to the water sector, thereby highlighting its relevance
    and potential in practical application. Most of the research studies covered in
    this review extend from the time we initiated it until October 2023. Nomenclature

    Machine Learning (ML) techniques have found significant applications in water
    resource management for prediction purposes, ranging from pure forecasting to
    estimating certain parameters of optimisation models (see Table 1). Statistical
    models provide mathematical representations of observed data, which are used for
    prediction purposes. They are generally based on variants of regression models,
    which include simple linear regression, multiple linear regression, generalized
    linear models, nonlinear regression, and autoregressive integrated moving average
    models (ARIMA) (Bovas and Johannes, 1983; Agresti, 2011; Agresti and Franklin,
    2011), regularized regression models - such as Ridge regression (Hoerl and Kennard,
    1970), Least Absolute Shrinking and Selection Operator (LASSO) (Tibshirani, 1996),
    as well as logistic regression models (Agresti, 2011). The latter are used for
    classification. Table 1. Summary of statistical and machine learning models as

    ML can be cast as either (i) supervised learning, (ii) unsupervised learning,
    (iii) semi-supervised learning or (iv) reinforcement learning. 2.1. Supervised
    learning Supervised learning techniques are used to devise a functional mapping
    between input variables and output variable(s) which have proven to be efficient
    for prediction tasks. Depending on the type of the dependent variable(s), a supervised
    learning technique is categorised as either a classification model (for a nominal
    dependent variable) or a regression model (for a continuous dependent variable).
    Therefore, statistical models can be viewed as supervised learning techniques.
    Classification models for ML include Decision Trees classifiers (Breiman et al.,
    1984; Quinlan, 1986), Support Vector Machines (SVM) classifiers (Cortes and Vapnik,
    1995; Steinwart and Christmann, 2008), Naïve Bayes classifiers (Domingos and Pazzani,
    1997), Adaptive Boosting (AdaBoost) classifiers (Freund and Schapire, 1995), Gradient
    Boosted Trees classifiers (Friedman, 2001; Hastie et al., 2009), Extreme Gradient
    Boosting (XGBoost) classifiers (Chen and Guestrin, 2016), Random Forest classifiers
    (Breiman, 2001), Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) (Friedman, 1989). Regression
    models include the regression variants of the aforementioned classifiers, namely
    Decision Trees regressors (Breiman et al., 1984), Support Vector regressors (SVR)
    (Drucker et al., 1997), Naïve Bayes regressors (Frank et al., 2000), AdaBoost
    regressors (Freund and Schapire, 1995), Gradient Boosted Trees regressors (Friedman,
    2001; Hastie et al., 2009), XGBoost regressors (Chen and Guestrin, 2016), Random
    Forest regressors (Breiman, 2001), as well as K-Nearest Neighbour (KNN) regressors
    (Cover and Hart, 1967). Deep learning (Le Cun et al., 2015; Schmidhuber, 2015)
    is a class of supervised learning suitable for both classification and regression
    tasks, which includes classical Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) (Amari, 1972;
    Hopfield, 1982), Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) (Le Cun et al., 1990), Recurrent
    Neural Networks (RNN) (Hopfield, 1982), Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN)
    (Goodfellow et al., 2014), Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) (Cho et al., 2014), Long
    Short-Term Memory (LSTM) (Hochreiter and Schmidhuber, 1997), Deep Belief Networks
    (DBN) (Hinton, 2009), Deep Convolutional Generative Adversarial Networks (DCGAN)
    (Radford et al., 2015). 2.2. Unsupervised learning Unsupervised learning techniques
    are used to discover patterns or relationships within unlabelled data. These machine
    learning techniques can be classified as either: - feature extraction techniques,
    including Hierarchical and Partitional Clustering (e.g., K-means and k-medoid)
    (MacQueen, 1967; Hartigan and Wong, 1979; Kaufman and Rousseeuw, 1990), Gaussian
    Mixture Model (GMM)-based Clustering (Maugis et al., 2009), Principal Component
    Analysis (PCA) (Jolliffe, 2002), Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection
    (UMAP) (Ghojogh et al., 2021), Isomap Embedding (Tenenbaum et al., 2000), Non-negative
    Matrix Factorization (NMF) (Lee and Seung, 2001), Association Rules (e.g. Apriori
    algorithm, (Agrawal and Srikant, 1994)), or - feature selection techniques, which
    revolve around Filter Methods based on mutual information (Pudjihartono et al.,
    2022). Variants of Deep learning (Le Cun et al., 2015) models used for unsupervised
    learning are Auto-Encoders (Kramer, 1991), which include Sparse Auto-Encoder (SAE)
    (Frey and Makhzani, 2013), Denoising Auto-Encoder (DAE) (Vincent and Larochelle,
    2010), Variational Auto-Encoder (VAE) (Welling and Kingma, 2019) and Restricted
    Boltzman Machines (RBM) (Sherrington and Kirkpatrick, 1975), and Deep Boltzman
    Machines (DBM) (Salakhutdinov and Hinton, 2009). 2.3. Semi-supervised learning
    Semi-supervised learning (Chapelle et al., 2006; van Engelen and Hoos, 2020) combines
    both supervising and unsupervised learning framework, namely when the data available
    consist of both unlabelled and labelled data, with the sample of unlabelled data
    generally outweighing the one for labelled data. Semi-supervised learning techniques
    include Label Spreading (Zhu and Goldberg, 2009), Label Propagation (Zhu and Ghahramani,
    2002), and Self-Training classifier (Triguero et al., 2015). 2.4. Reinforcement
    Learning Reinforcement Learning (RL) (Kaelbling et al., 1996) is a framework based
    on an agent''s behaviour with a defined environment where some feedback from previous
    actions are used to adjust optimally the subsequent actions. RL techniques include
    Q-Learning (Watkins, 1992), Markov Decision Process (MDP) (Wrobel, 1984), State-Action-Reward-State-Action
    (SARSA) (Rummery and Niranjan, 1994), Proximal Policy Optimisation (PPO) (Schulman,
    2017), and Policy Gradient (PG) (Sutton et al., 2000). Sometimes, different ML
    techniques and statistical models are combined to improve the predictive accuracy.
    Such hybrid approaches include the combination of RL with Deep Learning (e.g.,
    Deep Reinforcement Learning, Deep Q-Learning) (Mnih et al., 2015), and the combination
    of ANNs with ARIMA (Zhang, 2003). This study aims to provide a comprehensive overview
    of the applications of machine learning in water resources management related
    fields, including groundwater management, water distribution systems, water quality
    and wastewater treatment, water demand and consumption, hydropower and marine
    energy, irrigation and agriculture, water drainage systems, and flood management
    and defence. The following sections provide an overview of the recent water resource-related
    research studies where ML algorithms were implemented (Fig. 1). Download : Download

    water resource management related applications covered in this review. 3. Review
    methodology This review involved establishing a systematic literature search on
    the water industry. ScienceDirect and Scopus were mainly used as the database.
    The search also mainly focused on journal articles. Two sets of keywords were
    used, where one set included the machine learning elements, and the other set
    included elements related to the water industry. Those relating to the former
    included keywords such as ‘machine learning’, ‘deep learning’, ‘neural networks’,
    ‘LSTM’, ‘long short-term memory’, ‘random forest’, ‘genetic algorithm’, ‘support
    vector machine’, ‘extreme learning machine’, and ‘extreme gradient boosting’.
    Those relating to the latter included keywords such as ‘groundwater’, ‘water distribution
    systems’, ‘water quality’, ‘wastewater treatment’, ‘water demand’, ‘water consumption’,
    ‘hydropower’, ‘marine energy’, ‘irrigation’, ‘agriculture’, ‘river basin management’,
    ‘water drainage systems’, ‘flood management’, and ‘water retaining structure’.
    The searches were limited to mainly include journal publications. While the search
    mainly focused on the articles published in the past ten years, some older articles
    were cited. 4. Groundwater management Groundwater resources are large natural
    reservoir located within the ground. Arid areas often rely on groundwater resources
    for water supply, irrigation and industrial activities. (Pathak et al., 2021;
    Ghosh et al., 2022). Half of drinking water is supplied by groundwater, and irrigation
    accounts for nearly 43% (Rajeevan and Mishra, 2020). However, natural and human
    factors have put groundwater resources under tremendous pressure. The main detrimental
    factors impacting groundwater quantity and quality include climate change, population
    growth, and agricultural demands. Most groundwater-related studies where ML was
    applied focus on groundwater level (GWL) forecasting. Understanding groundwater
    flow dynamics is essential to assess the potential availability and scarcity of
    water. Hence, a sustainable management of the available groundwater resources
    in arid and semi-arid regions is contingent of an accurate and reliable prediction
    of GWL, which directly reflects groundwater availability and provides relevant
    cues on its hydrodynamics. However, characterising groundwater dynamics is a difficult
    task since the occurrence and availability present spatial and temporal variations,
    which depend on several factors, including, but not limited to, slope, geology,
    rainfall, and soil type. A large number of studies have demonstrated the usefulness
    of data-driven models for GWL application, especially in data-scarce context and/or
    complex aquifer systems. Conventional approaches applied to GWL have often involved
    the use of multivariate linear regression models (MLR), autoregressive integrated
    moving average (ARIMA) model, and seasonal autoregressive moving average (SARIMA)
    (e.g., Rahaman et al., 2019), which are generally considered as linear fitting
    models. Future predictions could be derived using the SARIMA model along with
    the input and output of groundwater data (Kochhar et al., 2021). Teimoori et al.
    (2023) demonstrated that K-means clustering and relevance vector machine (RVM)
    could identify the optimal number and locations of monitoring wells and thus help
    design efficient groundwater level monitoring networks. Traditional ML models
    have also yielded acceptable GWL prediction performance. Rohde et al. (2021) use
    the ensemble-based Random Forest model and satellite-based remote sensing for
    long-term GWL prediction in California, USA. GWL was forecasted within all groundwater-dependent
    ecosystems across the state. They demonstrated that their results could be used
    to help groundwater data gaps filling and improve sustainable groundwater management
    policy in California even in the absence of groundwater monitoring well data.
    Liu et al. (2022) also implemented Random Forest and found it very effective in
    predicting GWL in the lower Tarim River. They demonstrated that RF was superior
    to other models in one-step-ahead predictions of groundwater depth in the space-time
    domain. Sharafati et al. (2020) assessed the performance pattern of the Gradient
    Boosting Regression (GBR) model to predict the monthly GWL with short- and long-lead
    times over the Rafsanjan aquifer. This study demonstrated the performance of GBR
    in predicting GWL. Regions with higher water depth and abstraction rates yielded
    better prediction performance. Hikouei et al. (2023) found that XGBoost exhibited
    good performance, reduced prediction uncertainties, and could capture true features
    of GWL in areas near canals. Their results showed that peat surface elevation
    was the most important parameter amongst other parameters tested, including precipitation,
    distance from the canal, and evapotranspiration. Several studies have shown that
    standalone deep learning models are more performant than traditional ML models
    but are still subjected to data characteristics that can affect their performance.
    The most common ML implementation is the use of artificial neural networks, which
    have been used to predict the dynamics of GWL in numerous studies. Ahmadi et al.
    (2022) showed that feed-forward ANN was very effective in groundwater characteristics
    quantitatively with good accuracy. Taormina et al. (2012) compared the ability
    of feed-forward neural network (FFANN) in forecasting GWL to regression and statistical
    models. Mohanty et al. (2015) also employed neural networks to predict GWL and
    found positive results. Another common application of ML in GWL forecasting is
    using deep learning models such as the LSTM, Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) and the
    Recurrent Neural Network (RNN). Cai et al. (2021) evidenced the superiority of
    the GRU model in regions with higher precipitation, higher average temperatures,
    lower snowfall fraction, more extreme climate events, and more frequent baseflow
    interactions. Regarding input features for the model, precipitation and streamflow
    data were found to be the most influential ones for groundwater level forecasting.
    Gharehbaghi et al. (2022) also examined the performance of the GRU model in Northwest
    Iran. They used three different layer structures of GRU-based neural network models
    via the seq2seq module, a modern deep learning scheme. Their proposed models could
    predict groundwater level fluctuations in arid/semi-arid regions. Wu et al. (2023)
    showed that the GRU model outperformed SVM, LSTM and MLP models at most groundwater
    monitoring stations. Recently, Pham et al. (2022) investigated the performance
    of seven machine learning models, namely random tree (RT), random forest (RF),
    decision stump, support vector machine (SVM), locally weighted linear regression
    (LWLR), as well as reduced error pruning tree (REP Tree), for the prediction of
    groundwater levels in a drought-prone area. This study found that the Bagging-RT
    and Bagging-RF models outperformed other models. Yin et al. (2021) compared the
    performance of machine learning and physical models in forecasting groundwater
    dynamics. The physically-based models included W3 and CLSM models, while the data-driven
    models were based on ANN, RF and LSTM models, respectively. The predicted GWLs
    from the LSTM model significantly perform better than those of RF and ANN models
    during validation and prediction periods. They quantified the importance of GRACE
    observations in data-driven models and found noticeable improvements in the performance
    metrics considered. Liu et al. (2022) found that when compared to Support Vector
    Machine, Generalized Regression Neural Network, Decision Tree, Convolutional Neural
    Network, Long Short-Term Memory and Gated Recurrent Network, Random Forest performed
    the best in predicting groundwater levels. They showed that RF was superior to
    other models in one-step-ahead predictions of groundwater depth in the space-time
    domain. Mahammad et al. (2023) compared six ML models, including Linear regression,
    Decision tree regressor, Support vector regressor, Random Forest regressor, K-nearest
    neighbours regressor, and Extreme gradient boost regressor. They showed that the
    XGB regressor was the most reliable model for future prediction, while the Decision
    Tree proved to be the least efficient technique for portraying the GWL dynamics.
    They demonstrated that changes in GWL over space and time were strongly linked
    to changes in rainfall and population in the study area. Shakya et al. (2022)
    compared the Support Vector Regression (SVR) model, Multivariate Linear Regression
    (MLR) model, Decision Tree Regression (DTR) model, Random Forest Regression (RFR)
    model, Multivariate Polynomial Regression (MPR) model, and two deep learning algorithms,
    namely ANN model and ANFIS in the task of predicting GWL in an arid area in India.
    They demonstrated that the MPR model was excellent for GWL forecasting and found
    that the groundwater table was highly correlated with evapotranspiration. Sun
    et al. (2022) employed three common data-driven models for GWL forecasting applications,
    which included a back-propagation artificial neural network (BP-ANN), ARIMA, and
    LSTM. The prediction accuracy of the models was tested by deploying them in five
    zones in a Northern Plain in China, which exhibited various hydrogeological properties.
    Amongst the three models, the LSTM model exhibited the best performance. Mohapatra
    et al. (2021) compared the performance of ANFIS, DNN, and SVM to assess their
    capability to predict seasonal GWL in different agroecological Zones of India.
    They found that the DNN model was the most efficient in predicting seasonal GWL
    in most of these agroecological zones and would, therefore, be a reliable forecasting
    tool for seasonal groundwater levels in different agroecological zones of India.
    Wunsch et al. (2022) investigated the impact of climate change on groundwater
    resources in Germany using CNN. Declining trends of GWL could be observed in most
    of the sites as well as spatial patterns of stronger decreases, especially in
    the northern and eastern parts of the country. They also observed increased variability
    of low GWL, which extended over long periods during the annual cycle towards the
    end of the century. Bai and Tahmasebi (2023) compared the performance of a graph
    neural network (GNN) to two baseline models - LSTM and GRU - for GWL forecasting.
    They demonstrated that the GNN model outperformed the other models regarding all
    the performance metrics considered. Also, they demonstrated that their model could
    still learn spatial dependencies from the data even when these were completely
    unknown while still obtaining similar performance. Their model also exhibited
    a high efficiency since it could simultaneously model GWL change for all monitoring
    wells in the system. In addition to standalone ML models, recent studies have
    also examined the performance of hybrid-based models, which combine various ML
    methods to improve forecasting performance. Rahman et al. (2020) used ML models
    coupled with wavelet transforms and showed that wavelet-based hybrid models such
    as WT-XGB and WT-RF were more accurate than standalone models (non-wavelet-based),
    which included Extreme Gradient Boosting, Random Forests, and Support Vector Regression
    models. They also demonstrated that the coupling of WT further improved the performance
    for all ML approaches, and the improvement was more significant for a longer forecasting
    horizon (3 months). Wei et al. (2023) used ANN models combined with wavelet transform
    (WT) and phase space reconstruction (PSR) and found that the performance of the
    WT-PSR-ANN model was better than that of the WT-ANN model and substantially better
    than the standalone models in GWL forecasting. They also found that the type of
    mother wavelet affected the accuracy of the WT-hybrid models, which was more apparent
    for the WT-ANN models than for the WT-PSR-ANN model. Azizpour et al. (2021) proposed
    hybrid models to predict the monthly GWL in Kermanshah, Iran. The hybrid models
    comprised a differential evolutionary algorithm to optimise the ELM and a WT to
    decompose the input parameters into different time series. Their study suggested
    that their hybrid meta-heuristic ML could effectively predict the available water
    quantity in the investigated study area. Yadav et al. (2020) demonstrated that
    the hybrid models (HANN and HSVM) perform better than the original models (ANN
    and SVM) while predicting groundwater level fluctuations. They found that prediction
    accuracy decreased with increasing forecasting horizons for original and hybrid
    models. They evidenced that groundwater decline was much higher in peri-urban
    areas. Van Thieu et al. (2023) proposed a novel hybrid ML model combining Augmented
    Artificial Ecosystem Optimisation (AAEO) algorithm with a traditional MLP network
    and showed that AAEO-MLP exhibited the highest performance and stability with
    reasonable convergence. They evidenced that the AAEO was a promising approach
    for optimising ML models (e.g. MLP) and should, therefore, be explored for other
    hydrological forecasting applications (e.g., streamflow, rainfall) to further
    examine its performance over commonly known methods. Other than all purely data-driven
    hybrid models, physical-based hybrid models combine ML models and physics-based
    models to improve forecasting performance. Su et al. (2020) used deep learning
    algorithms combined with a range of complex numerical models and large-scale Internet
    of Things (IoTs) to measure groundwater levels with acceptable performance. Kayhomayoon
    et al. (2022) proposed a new hybrid model that combines MODFLOW simulation, clustering,
    and optimisation tools for GWL prediction. Specifically, they simulated GWL using
    the MODFLOW, clustered the study aquifer into different clusters using the k-mean
    method, and predicted regional GWL using ANN and ANFIS methods that were optimised
    by the Harris Hawks Optimisation (HHO), Whale Optimisation Algorithm (WOA), and
    Particle Swarm Optimisation (PSO). They evidenced that the most important variables
    for groundwater levels in different clusters included GWL in the previous month
    (produced by MODFLOW), groundwater withdrawal, precipitation, temperature, and
    evaporation. Patra et al. (2023) compared Global-LSTM, and Local-LSTM to examine
    the relevance of groundwater sequential forecasting. Their study showed that the
    Global (MS) model was the least performant model in forecasting applications and
    that LSTM was reliable in GWL forecasting. They demonstrated that the local LSTM
    models from the mid-fan area exhibited the best choice for regional groundwater
    forecasting. Groundwater is also sensitive to pollution from various sources which
    is related to GWL decline, particularly in coastal areas, where the associated
    GWL decrease caused by excessive groundwater pumping leads to seawater intrusion,
    pollution and groundwater quality degradation. Nitrate contamination has also
    become a serious threat to coastal groundwater worldwide. Hence, the application
    of ML on groundwater contamination, although outside the scope of this review
    study, warrants further investigation. 5. Surface water management 5.1. Streamflow
    forecasting Machine learning has widely been applied to river basins, specifically
    for short-, mid- or long-term river flow forecasting, which is a pivotal task
    for optimal water resource management during the era of rapid climate change.
    The rapid evolution of hydrological variables, e.g., precipitation, substantially
    impacts the temporal evolution of river flow distribution in recent days, thereby
    rendering prediction challenges even more complex. The high uncertainty associated
    with basin characteristics, hydrological processes, and climatic factors affecting
    river flows makes streamflow prediction challenging. LSTM Networks have gained
    increasing attention in streamflow forecast, given its strong learning ability
    for time series data and ability to process sequential time-series data. Numerous
    studies have demonstrated the superiority of LSTM in streamflow forecasting over
    some traditional physics-based models, including the SAC-SMA model for runoff
    predictions (Kratzert et al., 2018) or the CaMa Flood calibrated model for streamflow
    and climate data forecasting (Damavandi et al., 2019). LSTM networks have recently
    yielded the most promising results in the realm of river streamflow forecasting
    (Wegayehu and Muluneh, 2022). Xu et al. (2020a, 2020b) assessed the performance
    of LSTM networks for 10 days average flow predictions and the daily flow predictions
    at Hun River and Upper Yangtze River basins, respectively. The impacts of network
    structures and parameters, such as the batch size and the number of LSTM cells,
    impacted the learning efficiency and predictive accuracy. Overall, LSTM was proven
    to yield good forecasting capabilities compared to traditional hydrological and
    data-driven models tested, which included the SWAT, Xinanjiang model (XAJ), multiple
    linear regression model (MLR) and back-propagation neural networks (BP). The predictive
    performance of LSTM models has also been compared to a wide range of machine learning
    models. Cheng et al. (2020) examined and compared the performance of ANN and LSTM
    in long lead-time forecasting in the Nan River Basin and Ping River Basin. Their
    ANN and LSTM models were shown to yield reliable daily forecasts up to 20 days
    lead time, albeit the LSTM model outperformed the ANN model when the forecasting
    horizon was increased. Mehedi et al. (2022) used the LSTM neural network to forecast
    river discharge and demonstrated its higher performance than other neural network
    regression models, including for longer lead periods. Dehghani et al. (2023) compared
    LSTM, CNN, and Convolutional Long Short-Term Memory (ConvLSTM), in hourly streamflow
    prediction in two rivers in Malaysia, namely the Kelantan and Muda River basins.
    They showed all three deep learning methods performed with high accuracy in predicting
    streamflow, but LSTM outperformed CNN and ConvLSTM in small basins with well-spatial
    distributed rainfall stations, while it underperformed them in moderate to high
    streamflow and large river basin. Le et al. (2021) examined and compared the performance
    of six supervised machine learning models in forecasting streamflow in the Red
    River basin in Vietnam. These included a CNN, a feed-forward neural network (FFNN),
    and four LSTM-based models. They also compared two standard models, LSTM and GRU,
    which comprised a single hidden layer, to two more complex algorithms: the stacked
    LSTM (Stacked LSTM) and the Bidirectional LSTM (BiLSTM). They showed that their
    four LSTM-based models performed better and were more stable than the FFNN and
    CNN models. They also evidenced that the complexity of the Stacked LSTM and BiLSTM
    models did not substantially improve the prediction accuracy compared to the two
    standard and simple models comprising a single layer (LSTM and GRU). Akbarian
    et al. (2023) examined the ability of the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather
    Forecasts (ECMWF) ensembles in runoff forecast application, with one-to three-months
    lead time in Iran. Five ML models were also used for the runoff prediction, including
    RF, ANN, XGBoost, SVR, and MLR, while results were compared to observations. Results
    showed that the ANN exhibited the best fit, followed by XGBoost and RF models,
    while SVR and MLR models yielded lower performance. ANN and XGBoost outperformed
    the other models for longer lead times, but the performance decreased with an
    increase in forecasting horizon. Ilhan (2023) explored a variety of ML algorithms
    in the estimations of one-ahead instantaneous measurement of streamflow rate in
    the Ergene River, including LSTM neural network, ANFIS with fuzzy c-means (FCM),
    ANFIS with subtractive clustering (SC), and the ANFIS with grid partition (GP).
    All four algorithms could successfully perform in the task of streamflow prediction.
    To further improve streamflow forecasting accuracy and model efficiency, a variety
    of traditional ML models that belong to the supervised category have also been
    either used directly or combined to develop hybrid models (Granata et al., 2022;
    Wang et al., 2023; Akbarian et al., 2023). Granata et al. (2022) proposed a novel
    ensemble model composed of RF and MLP algorithms and compared its forecasting
    capability to a deep learning model based on bidirectional LSTM networks. The
    results show that the two models showed comparable performance, but the forecast
    horizon strongly affected the predictive accuracy. Wang et al. (2023) developed
    a hybrid decomposition-based multi-model and multi-parameter (DMP) ensemble streamflow
    forecast method. Their novel ensemble forecast method extracted the characteristic
    periodic term and trend term of hydrological series, improved streamflow forecasting
    accuracy, reduced ensemble uncertainty and expanded the ensemble size. Hybrid
    models combining numerical models and ML models have also been tested to improve
    streamflow forecasting accuracy, especially for longer forecasting horizons. Hunt
    et al. (2022) tested LSTM for streamflow forecasting purposes for up to 10 days
    lead time at ten hydrological stations in the western US. The catchment-mean meteorological
    and hydrological variables from the ERA5 and Global Flood Awareness System (GloFAS)–ERA5
    reanalyses were used to train the LSTM model, as well as historical streamflow
    data. They showed for the first time that their LSTM model could be used in a
    hybrid system to create a medium-range streamflow forecast outperforming established
    physics-based models. Chu et al. (2023) assessed the ability of novel integrated
    streamflow modelling method combined with the DC-LSTM model with the DC-B-LSTM
    model in improving the forecasting performance. Both the DC-LSTM and DC-B-LSTM
    models were shown to outperform the standalone LSTM models for all river basins
    considered. Li et al. (2022) examined a hybrid model composed of a convolutional
    neural network and long short-term memory network (CNN-LSTM) and evidenced its
    superiority over the Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) model, especially in
    wet seasons, due to its nonlinear learning ability. 5.2. Water demand, allocation,
    and irrigation 5.2.1. Water demand and consumption Potable water can be inaccessible
    for many reasons, including inadequate water infrastructures, climate-based issues
    such as drought, and overexploitation of freshwater resources. Researchers have
    recently attempted to apply ML in drought forecasting, including Wang et al. (2022),
    who assessed the feasibility of using extreme learning machines (ELMs) to forecast
    hydrological droughts. They deployed support vector machine models and ELMs with
    approximately 144 different models, and they confirmed that ELMs could forecast
    the standardised hydrological drought index with high precision. Their study also
    demonstrated that self-adaptive differential evolution ELM could outperform all
    other tested models and that the wavelet hybrid positively impacted the model''s
    performance, yielding less error in their predictions. Global water scarcity presents
    an extraordinary challenge, so the United Nations prioritise it among its 17 sustainable
    development goals for 2030. Many regions are coming dangerously close to enclosing
    the gap between water demand and its sustainable limit. United Nations Water (2020)
    estimated that the water demand rate is more than twice the population growth
    rate within the last century. Arid areas are facing the worst of the water crisis.
    Therefore, monitoring water demand is of considerable significance for decision-makers.
    Water resources can be more efficiently managed if demand is accurately forecasted.
    This will help resolve the overexploitation of precious and limited water resources.
    Forecasting water demand is a challenging problem. As such, it has been approached
    in various ways, ranging from linear methods (Zhou et al., 2000; Alhumoud, 2008)
    to nonlinear regression models (Nasseri et al., 2011; Bennett et al., 2013). However,
    modelling water demand could be quite complex, and not all input variables have
    linearity between them. Due to the complexities of the water demand data, Romano
    and Kapelan (2014) explored the use of deep learning for forecasting and management
    of smart water distribution using real-life data from a water distribution network
    within the United Kingdom. Perea et al. (2019) applied deep learning to a previous
    study by Romano and Kapelan (2014) to improve the performance of existing short-term
    water forecasting models in Southern Spain. Banadkooki et al. (2022) attempt to
    resolve conflicts related to water resources in arid basins through the exploration
    of intelligent algorithms: genetic algorithms (GA) and non-dominated sorting genetic
    algorithm (NSGA-II). The study considered environmental parameters and the integrated
    water management indices to determine optimal water management scenarios. The
    study performed a variety of trade-offs to balance economic benefit and demand
    management. The results showed that less water was allocated to industries with
    high water demand to conserve aquifers and meet water demands. The real-life application
    of smart metering has become more apparent in recent years. Monitoring demand
    is vital for the adequate management of resources across all service sectors.
    Recently, neural networks have been more commonly implemented to address water
    demand prediction issues. While the water industry has not explored the use of
    deep learning for smart metering as extensively as in the energy sector (Kavousian
    et al., 2013). Pesantez et al. (2020) attempted to address this gap using artificial
    neural networks and cluster analysis to forecast the water demand at the customer
    level. They used smart metered data on water consumption, with no differentiation
    between the type of user, whether residential or non-residential. The study found
    that support vector regression underperformed compared to random forest and artificial
    neural network models despite applying optimisation methods supported by previous
    works (Herrera et al., 2010; Mouatadid and Adamowski, 2017; Antunes et al., 2018).
    As inferred previously by Herrera et al. in (2010), the random forest technique
    was found to be either on par with or slightly outperformed the artificial neural
    network model. Salloom et al. (2021) explored the use of GRU on historic water
    demand data and implemented k-means, an unsupervised classification method, to
    enhance prediction accuracy whilst also reducing the parameters fed into the model.
    The model was found to significantly reduce the complexity required (six times
    what was archived in the most current literature at the time of the study) while
    maintaining the predictive accuracy rate. Salloom et al. (2022) used a proportional-integral-derivative
    (PID) control approach to boost the performance and efficiency of neural network
    models for water demand prediction. The PID''s prediction error experienced the
    same level of reduction as other techniques in the study; however, the efficiency
    of error reduction showed superior performance compared to other techniques. This
    was evident by the negligible effects on the number of variables via the PID approach.
    Wang et al. (2022) explored the use of principal component analysis (PCA) and
    backpropagation (BP) neural network in water resource demand prediction in Taiyuan,
    China, a city subject to severe water shortages. Compared with other models (namely
    PCA-ANN, ARIMA, NARX, Grey-Markov, serial regression, and LSTM), the PCA-BP model
    outperformed them by making highly complex variables easier to compute. The model
    achieved this by reducing the dimensionality of the variables and transforming
    them into uncorrelated composite data. However, their model was limited by limited
    data collection, affecting its accuracy. In addition, although the model''s computation
    accuracy was sufficient to meet the threshold, there was still room for further
    development. 5.2.2. Water allocation and irrigation Water plays a vital role in
    irrigation and agriculture all over the world. The Food and Agriculture Organization
    of the United Nations (2017), FAO, states that 70% of freshwater withdrawn globally
    is supplied to agriculture to sustain the ever-growing human population. Future
    projections on the water demand for irrigated food production will double by 2050,
    increasing pressure on the already limited freshwater supplies. The FAO also anticipated
    an increase in water withdrawal by agriculture by 2050; however, this increase
    is only by 10%. This small increase is attributed to improved management and practices
    for irrigation. Therefore, efficient water use within the irrigation and agricultural
    sectors is crucial to lessen the strain on water demand worldwide. Evapotranspiration
    is an important aspect of irrigation and agriculture, which is split into two
    components: evaporation and transpiration. Evaporation refers to the water evaporated
    over a specific area, whereas transpiration refers to the water lost through the
    stomata of the vegetation. As these natural processes occur simultaneously, they
    are difficult to disentangle. Accurate estimation of the evapotranspiration rate
    is a vital parameter for farmers and agricultural engineers, as it helps reduce
    crop water demand. Traditional methods to address these issues include the Penman-Monteith
    equation, which Baille et al. (1994) used as a simplified method for the rate
    of evapotranspiration prediction. Other approaches found success using scintillometer
    and meteorological measurements applied to the FAO-PM56 model, as used by Poisson
    et al. (2017) study. However, the authors showed that the FAO-PM56 model had more
    significant uncertainties when minor variations were applied and fewer input variables
    were used. Deep learning techniques have been extensively used to model and forecast
    evapotranspiration within the agricultural sector. Feedforward backpropagation
    ANN outperformed multi-linear regression models (MLR) for predicting wind drift
    and evaporation losses of sprinkler irrigation systems (Al-Ghobari et al., 2018).
    Various studies found that convolutional neural networks (or CNN-hybrids) were
    more accurate than other nonlinear regression models, such as random forest or
    extreme gradient boosting, for evapotranspiration forecasting (Ferreira and da
    Cunha, 2020a, 2020b; Lucas et al., 2020). Elbeltagi et al. (2020) opted for a
    more modern approach to the problem by modelling long-term evapotranspiration
    dynamics using deep learning algorithms in major wheat-producing sites in Egypt.
    They applied deep neural networks using real-life data collected from remote sensors,
    which included the monthly maximum temperature, the monthly minimum temperature,
    and the monthly solar radiation. The model parameters were intentionally chosen
    to give the lowest root mean squared error, following a similar procedure presented
    by Maroufpoor et al. (2019a,b). He et al. (2022) successfully demonstrated the
    use of biological heuristic algorithms integrated with an extreme learning machine
    (ELM) to accurately determine the daily evapotranspiration (ETo) in the Hetao
    irrigation district of China. In the hybrid ELMs, the optimisers include grey
    wolf optimiser (GWO), moth-flame optimisation (MFO), particle swarm optimisation
    (PSO), and whale optimisation algorithm (WOA). The GWO was highlighted as the
    strongest performer of the four algorithms, obtaining the highest accuracy (R2
    = 0.945–0.955), specifically using mass transfer (Tmax, Tmin, RH, u2) combination
    as opposed to temperature or radiation. GWO is characterised by the avoidance
    of local optimisation when dealing with nonlinear and multivariate functions.
    Water resources can often become contaminated by agricultural runoff. Improper
    agricultural practices lead to elevated levels of faecal coliforms and other pollutants,
    thus negatively impacting the water quality of the surrounding area. Bilali and
    Taleb (2020) found that artificial neural networks and other machine learning
    models, such as random forest, multi-linear regression and decision tree, are
    highly accurate at predicting irrigation water quality parameters, such as the
    sodium absorption ratio and the TDS dissolved in the water surface. The study
    found that the ANNs outperformed k-nearest neighbours and support vector regression
    models. H. Chen et al. (2020) found that the CNNs architecture could be developed
    and integrated with decision tree algorithms to aid in smart feature extraction
    and to establish intelligent spectroscopic modelling of agricultural water pollution.
    Furthermore, ANNs have been used to forecast infiltration water volume under furrow
    irrigation (Mattar et al., 2015), to forecast irrigation flow (Mouatadid et al.,
    2019), and to forecast estimates for drip irrigation systems (Karimi et al., 2020).
    However, Mouatadid et al. (2019) highlighted that LSTM models were able to outperform
    the other models used in their study, which included an ANNs model, least squares
    support vector regression (LSSVR), multi-linear regression (MLR) and extreme learning
    machine (ELM). The LSTM was coupled with a maximal overlap discrete wavelet transform
    analysis and bootstrap technique. The wavelet-bootstrap-ANN and wavelet-LSTM,
    both with three hidden layers, displayed the most accurate forecasting capability
    compared to the other models used in the study. Chen et al. (2021) explored reinforcement
    learning, a deep Q-learning network (DQN), to develop smart irrigation practices
    focusing on conserving irrigation water and time without losing paddy rice yield.
    DQN combines the perception ability of deep learning with decision-making ability.
    The study found that the DQN strategy could conserve 23 mm of irrigation water
    compared to conventional irrigation decisions. Drainage water was also reduced
    by 21 mm without a reduction in yield. Alibabaei et al.’s (2022) case study in
    Portugal utilised a deep reinforcement learning model to optimise irrigation requirements
    on the site. The model would serve as a smart irrigation scheduling system that
    would aid farmers in water quantity and the irrigation frequency required for
    the site. The model post-training would not require expertise to operate and,
    thus, would be a valuable system for farmers to use after the completion of the
    study. The model would also adjust the irrigation requirements based on climate
    change, as climate data is used in the model. The study considered ANN, LSTM,
    and CNN. However, the LSTM was found to be better at predicting the Q-table than
    the other models. The trained model decreased the water requirement by 20–30%
    and increased productivity by 11% compared to the fixed method. Gorgij et al.
    (2023) demonstrated the predictive potential of LSTM for spatiotemporal forecasting
    of the quality of groundwater used for irrigation. Sodium Adsorption Ratio (SAR)
    was highlighted as a crucial criterion for the study. An 18-year SAR dataset based
    in northwest Iran was supplied to the model to forecast the irrigation water quality
    for the subsequent year. They found that the LSTM marked against the performance
    indicator RBIAS showed underestimation by the model. However, when assessed against
    the performance indicator GA (generalisation ability), the LSTM model exhibited
    more acceptable performance. The allocation of water sourced from the Transboundary
    River generally involves many stakeholders in different countries that share the
    water resource. Water scarcity and the often-conflicting use of water resources
    ultimately increase tensions between riparian countries. Tension can be eased
    by the efficient management and allocation of transboundary water resources, which
    warrants the need for advanced techniques to enable the proactive and efficient
    planning of available water for human well-being and environmental sustainability.
    As an attempt to apply ML techniques for water allocation in a transboundary context,
    Yan et al. (2019) comprehensively evaluated the water resources of China''s transboundary
    river basins at the basin and country levels. They assessed the performance of
    several ML algorithms, including random forest, gradient boosting, and stacking
    in the task of forecasting runoff. Their study provided valuable information on
    long-term averaged surface water resources by country and basin in China''s transboundary
    river basins and high-resolution runoff coefficient and runoff maps of all the
    riparian countries, thereby providing valuable spatially distributed runoff information.
    Their study also demonstrated the satisfactory implementation of ML models for
    water resources assessment and their superiority over traditional linear models
    and two popular runoff data products (the UNH/GRDC Global Composite Runoff Fields
    and the Global Streamflow Characteristics Dataset) from a predictive accuracy
    standpoint. 6. Hydropower management, marine energy and reservoir operation 6.1.
    Hydropower management and marine energy Statistics from Our World in Data (2020)
    showed that in 2019, global fossil fuel consumption totalled 136,761 TW-hours,
    reaching a new record and continuing the increasing trend observed in the past
    years. Fossil fuels were classified into three categories: gas, coal and oil.
    The data showed that most consumption was attributed to oil (53,620 TW-hours),
    while the least consumed fossil fuel was gas (39,292 TW-hours). This leaves global
    coal consumption at 43,849 TW-hours. Global efforts to struggle against climate
    change have been increasingly witnessed over recent years by shifting towards
    clean and renewable energy. According to the International Hydropower Association
    (2020), the 2020 Hydropower Status report showed that global clean electricity
    generation through hydropower achieved a new record of 4306 TW-hours. This record
    was acknowledged as the “single greatest contribution from a renewable energy
    source in history”. However, this record can only account for a small portion
    of the global fossil fuel consumption in 2019, approximately 3%. Therefore, it
    is essential to maximise the full potential of hydropower and marine energy by
    exploring new methodologies to solve current problems and increase the energy
    efficiency provided, particularly in some parts of the developing world where
    the load on the system is increasing, but hydro-turbines struggle to match the
    demand. The application of ML in hydropower management and marine energy has recently
    met some level of success. Hammid et al. (2018) explored the use of artificial
    neural networks on a small hydropower plant using a Kaplan turbine at the Himreen
    Lake dam in Diyala, Iraq, to enhance the accuracy of forecasting the energy produced.
    Wang et al. (2020) developed a novel integrated approach using traditional and
    more modern methodologies for the production capacity prediction of a hydropower
    station to enhance energy efficiency. A previous study by Zhang et al. (2017)
    found that a backpropagation neural network model, although powerful in terms
    of performance, took a relatively long time to train on the input data. Although
    a radial basis function neural network model could outperform the backpropagation
    neural network (Li et al., 2018), they were both prone to the risk of local minimum
    convergence. To avoid this challenge, Wang et al. (2020) opted for using a simple
    single hidden layer feedforward neural network, defined as an extreme learning
    machine (ELM). The corresponding model showed a generalisable performance with
    a relatively quick training time. Technological advances have made it possible
    to predict energy that can be gained from ocean waves. This type of renewable
    energy carries a higher power density than other renewable resources, such as
    solar or wind energy. Accurate predictions can enhance energy efficiency to reach
    the full extent of potential wave energy, ultimately helping the shift from fossil
    fuels. An early comparative study by Reikard (2009) supported a time-varying parameter
    approach, attributing the weakness of the neural network model to inadequate architecture
    and optimisation for that dataset. Hybrid models have been found to have the potential
    to achieve accurate predictions. Real-life application of wave energy control
    is difficult as it depends on accurate predictions of future waves. Li et al.
    (2018) explored the use of deep learning, namely ANNs, and showed that the model
    was able to provide accurate predictions, which substantially increased the average
    energy absorption from 60% to 80%. However, the control efficiency could still
    be further developed and improved as it was slightly lower than the optimal level.
    Avila et al. (2020) showed that using ANNs and fuzzy interference systems (FIS)
    proved to be effective tools to accurately predict wave power at any point in
    deep oceanic waters, even with a small dataset of a few months collected from
    buoys in the Micronesian region. Recently, Giles et al. (2021) explored the issue
    caused by sun glint for high-resolution red-green-blue (RGB) imagery collected
    by drones over shallow marine environments. An artificial neural network model
    was developed to automatically detect and classify the sun glint in high-resolution
    aerial imagery. The model was supplied with a highly imbalanced dataset, with
    the pixels of sun glint accounting for only 1.19% of the training dataset. Despite
    this, 99.18% of overall predictions were correct. It was also shown that large
    hydropower plants could have high environmental impacts. Bortoluzzi et al. (2022)
    used Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA) and an artificial neural network to accurately
    predict the local impact of such projects. While the DEA allowed the environmental
    impacts to be ranked, the ANN allowed the assessment of the size of the local
    environmental impact. In other words, they created a hybrid DEA-ANN decision-making
    approach, which enables a more informed evaluation of hydroelectric generation
    projects. The GRU-LSTM hybrid model of Ma et al. (2023) successfully predicted
    water levels in cascade hydropower stations at different time scales. Such information
    is vital for irrigation and flood control. Authors note prediction errors associated
    with downstream tributary backwater jacking could be significantly reduced by
    adding downstream tributary flow as an additional parameter in the dataset. The
    LSTM parameters implemented the Archimedes optimisation algorithm. The output
    results of the GRU and LSTM were weighted. This resulted in increased accuracy
    of the water levels predicted. The authors highlight the use of a semisoft threshold
    function to improve the model in various ways, such as eliminating the noise of
    the original hydrological dataset. 6.2. Reservoir operation Reservoirs provide
    a plethora of services, including the provision of freshwater supply. On the other
    hand, groundwater level fluctuation is subject to factors such as changes in precipitation
    during different seasons. National Thailand (2019) pointed out that the Vajiralongkorn
    Dam in Kanchanaburi was at 51% capacity with 4500 million cubic metres of water,
    down from 70% the same time the previous year, highlighting the harsh reality
    of dams drying up due to climate change. Given this fact, decision-makers are
    under more pressure to be aware of potential shortages in the future. Therefore,
    accuracy in predicting the water balance of a reservoir is crucial. Artificial
    neural networks (ANN) have been applied by Hadiyan et al. (2020) to accurately
    forecast the Sefidroud Dam reservoir inflow. Their study compared different types
    of static and dynamic ANNs, which included static feedforward neural networks
    (FFNN), nonlinear autoregressive (NAR) neural networks, and nonlinear autoregressive
    neural networks with exogenous inputs (NARX). The models were trained using two
    input variables, namely, the monthly inflow discharge and the precipitation data.
    The architectures were optimised by adjusting the number of neurons within the
    hidden layers. They found that the dynamic NAR model outperformed the other two
    models and could predict high inflows while achieving the lowest RMSE values.
    They evidenced that the most optimum number of time delays was 12 for the input
    variable as the model could perform computation more accurately. They also attempted
    to use dynamic artificial neural networks instead of static ones for forecasting
    discharge inflows. Recurrent neural networks have also been used to forecast water
    levels to improve water resource management, and long short-term memory (LSTM)
    models have proved to be efficient for this purpose, achieving an accuracy of
    97.05% (Ren et al., 2020). Amongst the main hydrological processes impacting the
    sustainable planning and management of river, dam operation and reservoir capacity
    is suspended sediment load (SSL). AlDahoul et al. (2022) successfully demonstrated
    the application of ML models to accurately classify suspended sediment load SSL
    using the data from the Johor River in Malaysia. The analysed models include extreme
    gradient boosting (XGB), random forest, support vector machine, multi-layer perceptron,
    and k-nearest neighbours. The XGB model exhibited superior classification performance
    over the other ML techniques. The model used several parameters, such as environmental
    factors influencing the SSL pattern, while using two different time scales. Nonetheless,
    they demonstrated that most of the ML models achieved acceptable classification
    results. 7. Water distribution and drainage systems 7.1. Water distribution systems
    As water demands increase and freshwater availability decreases, water resource
    mapping (WRM) becomes a key aspect of water resource management. Water resource
    managers need to know where the next set of potential resources are to use them
    in their plans for the future. Therefore, accurate predictions are imperative
    to ensure the availability of freshwater supply is over- or underestimated during
    the planning. Due to inadequate information, traditional approaches for WRM, such
    as water spectral indices (WSI), reach an impasse with high-resolution multispectral
    images. This can be problematic for more complex areas. To provide an alternative
    approach to mediate the issue, K. Chen et al. (2020) deployed a water body extraction
    neural network (WBE-NN) model for a more accurate surface water resource mapping.
    This approach outperformed previous methods (e.g., Feng et al., 2018; Nandi et
    al., 2017) with reduced processing time and a reduction of underestimated water
    areas. Water distribution networks (WND) are crucial infrastructure systems that
    provide potable water to the public. However, according to Interreg Central Europe
    (2020), up to 50% of water is lost in some parts of Europe, with an average of
    26% due to various structural problems, including poor water pressure management,
    deteriorated infrastructure, and leakages. For instance, the Consumer Council
    for Water (2017) stated that England and Wales collectively have a water leakage
    loss of 3.1 billion litres daily. Many traditional approaches have been undertaken
    to resolve water leakage issues; however, these methodologies are limited as they
    need to consider the complex and nonlinear deterioration of the infrastructures
    over time. To resolve the issue of leakage detection, Arsene et al. (2012) explored
    the use of deep learning combined with graph theory. Water distribution systems
    require adequate pressure management to sustain many operational aspects, which
    include demand control, maintenance, water leakage and failure management, cost
    reductions, and energy efficiency. Non-revenue water is largely attributed to
    water that is lost through leakage within the distribution network, thus resulting
    in substantial amounts of water loss through leakage. This increases operational
    costs, impacting the economic value of water companies. Traditional approaches
    for pressure monitoring often leave high uncertainties about pressure values at
    the nodal points that do not have sensors on them. Ridolfi et al. (2014) used
    artificial neural networks with a combination of the entropy-based methodology,
    which was outlined as shifting towards conditions of the highest order. The study
    found that optimal sensor placement on nodes could be achieved by finding the
    best trade-off between sampling design and model accuracy. Other studies show
    the successful use of neural networks for leakage or contamination detection within
    a water distribution system. Rutkowski and Prokopiuk (2018) used learning vector
    quantisation (LVQ) neural networks to pinpoint contamination locations within
    a water distribution system in Poland, whereas Zhou et al. (2019) used a convolutional
    neural network as part of a novel burst location identification framework. Hu
    et al. (2021) proposed a novel approach to leakage detection within a water distribution
    system using multiscale fully convolutional networks integrated with spatial clustering
    of applications with noise. This approach outperformed k-nearest neighbour (KNN),
    support vector machine (SVM) and naive bayes classifier (NBC) by 28%, 78%, and
    72%, respectively. Water resource carrying capacity (WRCC) is an essential aspect
    of urban planning, which aims to balance out the amount of water demand concerning
    the available water resources within an urbanised area. Analysis of the WRCC of
    a city helps prevent the exploitation and degradation of the water resources and
    environment while ensuring a sustainable standard of living for the people. However,
    addressing this issue depends on multiple input variables, which become far too
    complex and reduce the accuracy of the predictions. Yu et al. (2020) proposed
    two simple types of feedforward neural networks (FNN) based on the normalisation
    value (NV) and error correction to address these issues. Almheiri et al. (2021)
    outlined the superior performance of deep learning compared to other machine learning
    methodologies, e.g., survival random forest (SRF). However, since the amount of
    data available controls DL approach, it is therefore limited as pipe failure data
    are not widely scarce. They developed a hybrid model using an ANN-based method
    and integrated an ML process to predict the hazard ratio of water pipes. The performance
    of ML approaches (e.g., SRF) decreased as the training shots decreased, whereas
    the stability of the hybrid model remained constant despite the decrease in the
    training shots. The authors suggested the two learning phases allow the hybrid
    to effectively generalise, while one phase was used in the baseline approaches.
    Garðarsson et al. (2022) successfully demonstrated strong performance of Graph
    Neural Networks (GNNs) to predict pressure values in water distribution networks
    in order to detect leakage and localisation. Results were evaluated by the benchmark
    set in the Battle of the Leakage Detection and Isolation Methods challenge (Vrachimis
    et al., 2020). The authors noted that the model was limited by false positives;
    however, the GNN model could obtain the highest economic score among the contestants,
    suggesting the model was still considered a viable approach to leakage detection.
    More recently, Yu et al. (2023) implemented ML methods with piezoelectric accelerometers
    installed within real-life pipe networks across several cities in China that classified
    vibration signals in order to detect leakages within the systems. They demonstrated
    that a pre-trained compact CNN with 18 deep learnable layers with the ability
    to classify images into 1000 classes, namely SqueezeNet, performed the best and
    showed a 95.15% in leak-detection accuracy compared to the other ML approaches,
    which included SVM, DTR and KNN. They also demonstrated that larger dataset enabled
    SqueezeNet to achieve more accurate results. 7.2. Water drainage system The advent
    of advanced sewage and drainage systems can be traced back to the Indus Valley
    Civilisation around 3000 BC. This historical infrastructure spanned 91 cm across
    and 1.5 m in depth as a watertight sanitary drainage system (Harappa, 2020). Nowadays,
    natural processes required for drainage systems, namely the infiltration, which
    enables water to move into the ground easily, is hindered and reduced in urbanised
    areas. Therefore, increased stormwater can easily overwhelm surface water drainage
    systems of urbanised areas. Pollutants and contaminants within the system can
    potentially be released and have serious consequences on public health, as well
    as the health of any surrounding organisms. Concerns over climate change and future
    projections of heavier rainfall can present a challenge to decision-makers and
    drainage engineers. If drainage systems cannot function properly, urban flooding
    is inevitable and may eventually lead to various issues for both the public and
    the environment. An important aspect when designing drainage systems is understanding
    the rainfall-runoff relationship for any given catchment. Gong et al. (1996) and
    Loke et al. (1997) have attempted to address this issue using ANNs models as a
    predictive tool for urban stormwater drainage. Loke et al. (1997) were able to
    show that neural networks had a high fault tolerance, good generalisation, and
    a high ability to learn. However, limitations of the models included the need
    for substantial amounts of data for more accurate predictions, little transparency,
    and relatively long training times. Pektaşa and Cigizoglu (2013) highlighted the
    inadequate performances of ANNs, univariate autoregressive integrated moving average
    (ARIMA), and multivariate autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMAX) models
    for time series predictions for direct runoff coefficients within large drainage
    basins. They proposed a hybrid ANN-ARIMA model and found that it could be generalized
    to enhance the computational power of the neural networks and offer for more accurate
    time-series predictions. On the other hand, ANNs have also been explored to alleviate
    issues pertaining to stormwater and optimisation of the drainage system (Hsu et
    al., 2013; Rjelly et al., 2018; Mullapudi et al., 2020). An early study by Tran
    et al. (2007) outlined the use of neural network modelling with CCTV data to identify
    the deterioration of stormwater pipes made from concrete. The architecture used
    backpropagation weight estimation and was compared to a Monte Carlo simulation
    using Bayesian weight estimation. Although the neural network model outperformed
    the Monte Carlo simulation, the model struggled to accurately process irrelevant
    features, namely redundant factors such as ''soil type'' and ''buried depth''.
    More recently, Li et al. (2019) used backpropagation neural networks (BPNN) as
    a monitoring tool to assess the performance of stormwater green infrastructure
    practices. The model was successfully able to reduce peak flow rate averages of
    61% per storm event and reduce the flow volume by 33% per storm event. Truong
    et al. (2021) input a 21-year dataset of water levels into a gradient tree boosting
    (GTB) model to forecast the water levels in the culverts within irrigation and
    drainage systems. The GTB consistently outperformed eight other machine learning
    methods. Over 91% of predicted and observed values had an error rate below 10%.
    The comparative common machine learning techniques such as DTR, DL, Adaboost,
    SVM, XGBoost, RF, and LightGBM. The resultant predictions could aid in forming
    a strategic approach considering water resources reallocation, affordable pumping
    technologies, or water rotation in times of low water levels. Zhang et al. (2022)
    utilised deep reinforcement learning (DRL), specifically a Duelling Double Deep
    Qu-learning (D3QN) strategy, to evaluate the uncertainty of control within drainage
    systems. DRL-based real-time control showed reduced statistical dispersion by
    15.48–81.93% compared to the conventional rule-based control strategy, thus demonstrating
    an advantage over the rule-based strategy. The reduction in statistical dispersion
    specifically pertained to random and system uncertainties in monitoring water
    level signals within an urban drainage system. 8. Water quality monitoring Water
    quality is an absolute necessity for public health and safety. However, since
    the 1990s, water pollution has worsened in most rivers in Africa, Latin America
    and Asia (United Nations Environment Programme, 2016). The global population has
    only increased and intensified the global demand for potable water, thus putting
    enormous pressure on water treatment plants. Extensively urbanised cities such
    as London, Hong Kong and New York experience high levels of stormwater runoff.
    Much of the effluents carry various types of pollutants, which lower the drinking
    water quality, in some cases making the water dangerous for marine life. Therefore,
    water treatment engineers faced various challenging issues requiring advanced
    and innovative solutions. For instance, estuaries face various environmental issues,
    including toxic chemicals, water flow changes, and habitat loss. According to
    the National Biodiversity Network (2019), physical changes impact a third of the
    water ecology in the United Kingdom, thus hindering the natural functions of the
    estuaries. Many estuaries undergo large-scale conversions into urbanised areas,
    agricultural areas, and shipping ports. Therefore, human interference imposes
    a great burden on the natural environment, and a substantial number of estuarine
    habitats are lost, forcing more competitive survival pressures on the species
    inhabiting those areas. Other environmental issues include toxins within the water
    supply, such as Cyanobacteria, also known as blue-green algae. Human interference
    can haphazardly provide optimum conditions for Cyanobacteria to bloom. This includes
    degradation of the surrounding water quality caused by the release of fertiliser-polluted
    runoff from farms, eutrophication of waterways and septic tank overflows. These
    environments allow Cyanobacteria to thrive and multiply above a safe level for
    humans, animals, and plants. Various studies have been conducted using deep learning
    for estimations and predictions regarding water quality, including Zhou (2020),
    who used transfer-based LSTMs, and Yu and Qu (2020), who used radial basis function
    neural networks. Zhang and Hu (2020) used difference-gated neural networks, and
    Y. Chen et al. (2020) used deep cascade forests. Jouanneau et al. (2014) found
    that monitoring Biochemical Oxygen Demand (BOD), a key water quality indicator,
    required more time and effort to detect. Ma et al. (2020) addressed this issue
    by developing a deep matrix factorization (DMF) combined with deep neural networks
    (DNN) in a New York City (United States) harbour. The proposed model showed strong
    computational power, superior to other machine learning algorithms such as gradient-boosted
    decision trees, random forest, and support vector regression. Traditional linear
    methods, such as Ridge, LR, and LASSO, were also used as a benchmark but underperformed
    compared to the machine learning methods. The history of modern-day water supply
    infrastructures can be traced back to the 1600s in Medieval London (Water History,
    2020). Newhart et al. (2019) found that water treatment plants are excellent subjects
    for neural network studies due to the large quantity of historical data that is
    usually available and easily accessible. Several studies have shown that ANNs
    outperform other machine learning algorithms for investigating the operations
    of the water treatment plant (Guo et al., 2015; Ghaedi and Vafaei, 2017; Najafzadeh
    and Zeinolabedini, 2019). These operations ranged from predictions for membrane
    fouling in the filtration systems of a water treatment system to predictions for
    real-time coagulant dosage (Dharman et al., 2012; Kim and Parnichkun, 2017; Bagheri
    et al., 2019). Alternatively, Zhang et al. (2019a, 2019b) used ANN with genetic
    algorithms to predict the performance of drinking water treatment plants under
    varying pressures and stresses to effectively manage the water treatment plant.
    Wastewater treatment is imperative to ensure the health and safety of the public
    and the surrounding environment. In 2015, the United Nations International Children''s
    Emergency Fund (UNICEF) estimated that 1.8 billion people have no other water
    source except water contaminated by faecal matter. Therefore, a significant part
    of the world''s population is highly exposed to various water-related diseases,
    including polio, cholera and typhoid. The United Nations Educational, Scientific
    and Cultural Organization (2017) reported that 80% of inadequately treated wastewater
    is released into the environment worldwide. The pollutants in this water can severely
    impact human health and the surrounding ecosystem, such as decaying organic matter,
    reducing oxygen availability, and essentially killing the aquatic inhabitants.
    Proper management of wastewater treatment is pivotal before effluent can be safely
    discharged back into the environment. Ráduly et al. (2007) used ANNs to evaluate
    the performance of wastewater treatment plants, while Shi and Xu (2018) proposed
    a model based on a stacked denoising auto-encoders deep learning network to predict
    biofilm system''s performance under various wastewater treatment plant operations.
    Zhang et al. (2018) used LSTMs to forecast flow to optimise inter-catchment wastewater
    transfer and reduce overflow, and Niu et al. (2020) used genetic algorithms integrated
    into deep belief networks to accurately predict effluent quality and improve process
    monitoring. Bhagat et al. (2020) provided a critical analysis of the development
    of artificial intelligence for modelling the removal of heavy metals within wastewater.
    The approaches investigated included ensemble models, various metaheuristics,
    different ANN models, and unsupervised methods. Recently, Sang-Soo et al. (2020)
    used CNN and LSTM combined with a deep learning approach to predict the water
    level and water quality in the Nakdong river basin. The study highlighted the
    proposed model''s performance and ability to capture the temporal variations of
    the pollutants in the Nakdong River basin. Zhu et al. (2022) successfully used
    enhanced feed-forward neural networks to predict biochemical oxygen demand (BOD)
    and ammonia nitrogen (NH3–N) water quality indicators within wastewater treatment
    plants. The highly accurate model obtained a mean error of less than 10% with
    an R2 of 90%, thus improving on the previous feed-forward neural network with
    the least square support vector machine (FFNN-LSSVM) model. However, the authors
    suggested that the data obtained from real-time monitoring should be used to inform
    future research and improve the model performance. Yang et al. (2023) demonstrated
    the sufficient accuracy of LSTM network in the task of forecasting the effluent
    quality of a constructed wetland. Their model could outperform other predictive
    ML methods including multiple linear regression, backpropagation neural network
    (BPNN), and a GA-BPNN-hybrid neural network (genetic algorithm as an optimisation
    method integrated into a BPNN model) to resolve local minima issues. They showed
    that their data exhibited significant effluent population fluctuations. A moving
    average method was applied to smooth the data, improving the accuracy of the traditional
    and hybrid neural networks. Ibrahim et al. (2023) outlined using ANNs to successfully
    predict the water quality index (WQI). The authors used principal component analysis
    (PCA) to identify the sources of pollution within the Terengganu River and reflect
    the general conditions. They applied three ANN models with differing input layers
    to predict the water quality index (WQI) of the river. The best-performing ANN
    was found to be the one that used the raw data as the input layer, as opposed
    to principal component factor scores (obtained from the previously conducted PCA).
    9. Flood management and water-retaining structures 9.1. Flood prediction Flooding
    poses a serious risk to many people worldwide, with many regions of the earth
    impacted by this natural disaster. Flooding is caused by a wide range of factors,
    including (i) heavy, prolonged rainfall events, which are more likely to rise
    in the future as a consequence of climate change, (ii) urbanisation., which substantially
    increases the surface water runoff and impedes the rate of infiltration, or (iii)
    infrastructure failure such as overtopping of dams. The impacts of flooding can
    have a substantial economic burden, particularly in the developing world. Some
    studies (e.g., Ward et al., in 2017; Peduzzi in 2017; Alfieri et al., 2018) anticipate
    the global economic impact of flooding to cost approximately $1 trillion by 2050.
    Other impacts include mass migration, socio-psychological implications, loss of
    livelihood and property and, in more severe cases, loss of life. According to
    a report presented by the United Nations (2015), 2.3 billion people were affected
    by flooding, with a significantly high death toll of 157,000 people between 1995
    and 2015. Future flooding events have been predicted to become more frequent and
    more intense than they have been in the past. Therefore, to sufficiently mitigate
    and manage the consequences of flooding, exploring innovative solutions and technologies
    that enhance the accuracy of predicting flood occurrences is imperative. Conventional
    methodologies include prediction using flood inundation models (Salvadore et al.,
    2015; Gires et al., 2015; Teng et al., 2017). However, these models can only simulate
    results based on distinct types of flooding, and complete real dynamic processes
    are omitted, resulting in the decayed accuracy of the projections. Fenech et al.
    (2019) attempt to follow a similar methodology but include dynamic processes.
    They aimed to improve this model by using a model that divides the irregular urban
    area into various grid cells. The proposed model considered the characteristics
    of the urban environment, including urban drainage systems and impermeable surfaces.
    To evaluate the model, the authors attempted to reproduce the flood in Lafayette
    Parish in Louisiana in 2016. Results showed that due to coarse resolutions, simulations
    could not reproduce the flood regions of the 2016 Lafayette Parish flooding. However,
    spatial patterns were observed after the model resolution was refined. Fang et
    al. (2019) introduced deep learning for flood prediction and proposed an integrated
    LSTM and reduced-order-model (ROM) framework to perform time series prediction
    and prescriptive analysis on flooding. Their study found that the LSTM-ROM model
    outperformed the full model and maintained its accuracy in predicting flooding.
    However, they found that when lead time is extended, the predictive accuracy decreases.
    Bui et al. (2020) introduced a novel approach using deep learning neural networks
    to aid in forecasting the likelihood of flash floods. This type of ANNs architecture
    was selected due to its ability to represent and process highly complex input
    data and to produce highly accurate projections despite the non-linearity of the
    given data (Lewis, 2016). Their study was specifically designed to address the
    challenges in regions susceptible to a high frequency of tropical storms. Therefore,
    the model was based on real-life data collected in the northwest mountainous region
    of Vietnam. The geographic information system (GIS) input dataset included the
    slope, lithology, rainfall, soil type, elevation, steam density, curvature, and
    normalised difference vegetation index (NDVI). All nine factors influenced the
    susceptibility of flash flooding within the area. The influencing factors were
    selected based on the information gain ratio method proposed by Quinlan (1986)
    and Dai and Xu (2013), thus eliminating the need for data collection on unnecessary
    factors. Hosseiny''s (2021) study utilised U-net, an advanced CNN, to predict
    river flood depth and extent. The results surmised an improved accuracy in predicting
    the maximum flood depth by 29%. Löwe et al.’s (2021) research also successfully
    implemented advanced convolutional neural networks, U-Net, to predict urban pluvial
    flood water depth. It was found that deeper networks improved the prediction until
    reaching a limit of around 28 million trainable parameters. It was noted that
    too many datasets led to overfitting and increased prediction errors. The dataset
    that led to the model performing the best included a combination of terrain aspect,
    curvature, depth of depressions, flow accumulation and imperviousness. Ahmed et
    al. (2021) found exponential Gaussian process regression (GPR) accurately predicted
    the daily water levels in a river subject to annual flash flooding in Malaysia
    based on data collected from 1990 to 2019. The GPR model outperformed several
    other machine learning models such as linear regression (LR), interaction regression
    (IR), robust regression (RR), stepwise regression (SR), support vector regression,
    boosted trees ensemble regression (BOOSTER), bagged trees ensemble regression
    (BAGER), XGBoost, and tree regression (TR). The GPR was further used to predict
    water levels based on 10-day minimum and maximum water levels and could forecast
    the extremes of the water levels. The authors of the study denote the study was
    limited by data availability. Ramayanti et al. (2022) explored the generation
    of flood susceptibility mapping, where they implemented two deep learning architectures
    to the problem: group method of data handling (GMDH) and CNN. The study was centred
    around the March 2019 flood in the Beria Area, Mozambique. The models were both
    able to produce similar mapping, where lower-sloped areas (i.e., areas along the
    river) were at a higher risk of flooding. The CNN performance indicator, RMSE
    value, was four times lower than the RMSE value derived from GMDH. This showed
    that CNN could generate an accurate flood susceptibility map more than the GMDH.
    Sorkhabi et al. (2023) employed CNN and LSTM to predict the variability in sea
    level and flooding to measure coastal city resilience. Variables included wind
    speed, sea surface temperature, precipitation, and mean sea level. The study found
    that deep learning approaches offered good predictive accuracy in the resilience
    of the city against flooding due to the variable sea level. However, future works
    suggested are to incorporate more parameters, such as updated satellite data,
    to improve the accuracy of the models. 9.2. Water retaining structures Throughout
    human history, dating back more than 5000 years, according to Biswas and Tortajada
    (2010), water-retaining structures have been constructed in many places worldwide.
    Dams provide many benefits, although their fundamental purpose is to facilitate
    water storage. These benefits include, but are not limited to, flood control,
    hydropower and human consumption. Currently, there are 50,000 of these large hydraulic
    structures (Tata and Howard, 2016) being used worldwide, of which a large majority
    are embankment dams. The British Dam Society (2019) attributes the most common
    dam failure modes to overtopping during floods. The health and structural integrity
    of dams are crucial since the consequences of failure can be severe. Therefore,
    understanding dam behaviour and failure mechanisms is vital. De Granrut et al.
    (2019) explored using ANNs to analyse the behaviour of piezometric data on arch
    dams, focusing on the rock-concrete interface to monitor uplift pressures on the
    dam. The study highlighted the limitations of traditional multi-linear regression
    (MLR) models, such as the Hydrostatic-Season-Time (HST) model, which are commonly
    used across engineering practices to monitor dams (Crépon and Lino in 1999; Penot
    et al., in 2005; Léger and Leclerc in 2007). The advantage of using HST is that
    only the reservoir level is required and performs well only under certain circumstances.
    On the other hand, various mathematical approaches have been proposed to model
    dam seepage (Ding and Han, 2017). Cui and Zhu (2009) successfully implemented
    a three-dimensional finite element method integrated with genetic algorithms;
    however, issues with convergence and basic operators in the genetic algorithms
    impacted the model''s accuracy. Zhang et al. (2020) successfully applied ANNs
    integrated with a three-dimensional finite element model to forecast the regions
    of weakness (particularly seepage) of concrete dam foundations. Unlike the HST
    model, ANNs enable the capture of the non-linearity of the piezometric data, such
    as the leakage flows, movements, and head of the reservoir. Overtopping occurs
    when the dam''s design, such as the freeboard, is not sufficient to cater to the
    actual requirements, which may change over time. Hence, a suitable design during
    the initial construction may no longer be appropriate later due to the changes
    in conditions. The likelihood of overtopping is further exacerbated during extreme
    weather conditions. For example, due to fluctuations caused by the weather, the
    head of the water rises above the designed freeboard, which leads to overtopping.
    The Environment Agency (2018) reports that the projections show increased winter
    precipitation over the United Kingdom because of climate change. Although seasonal
    variation is expected, there will be times during the year when dams will be subjected
    to store more water due to the high precipitation, increasing the risk of overtopping.
    As the years go on, the trend of a rainfall event is expected to further increase
    the risk of overtopping. Huang et al. (2003) used convolutional ANNs for coastal
    water level predictions. However, this method requires large amounts of long-term
    historical data, which is not always readily available. Fuzzy logic parameters
    integrated into ANNs provide effective estimations of water levels under uncertainty;
    however, they do not give insight into the parameters'' uncertainties alone (Alvisi
    and Franchini, 2011). Yang et al. (2019) applied recurrent ANNs to simulate reservoir
    operations using inflow, storage and climate data. In this study, the authors
    used LSTM, nonlinear autoregressive models with exogenous input (NARX) and a NARX-based
    genetic algorithm, and they found that the latter was able to outperform the other
    models. Ren et al. (2021) implemented an interpretable mixed attention mechanism
    long short-term memory (MAM-LSTM) model to predict displacement associated with
    concrete dams. The authors found success in their two-staged encoder approach.
    The highly influential factors were adaptively selected by the factor attention
    mechanism module. The temporal attention mechanism module, in contrast, was able
    to select the relevant hidden states. This model outperformed classical statistical
    modelling and other deep learning and machine learning models. Fan et al. (2022)
    utilised a transfer learning approach, MA-AttUNet. This sophisticated methodology
    applied previous knowledge from a source domain to underwater crack image segmentation.
    The knowledge transfer occurs using a multi-level adversarial transfer network.
    An attention mechanism also limited background noise during detection. Although
    the model exhibited poor real-time performance, it was able to accurately identify
    underwater dam crack images. Nonetheless, the model outperformed other methods
    at the time of the study. Zhang et al. (2023) used a unifying transformer encoder
    integrated into a CNN architecture for pixel-level dam crack detection. The proposed
    model demonstrated flexibility and was able to adapt to a variety of scenarios.
    Although the model performed well against quantitative indicators, the authors
    showed that the model''s accuracy in detection was critically impacted by weak
    or disturbing background information. They also highlighted that the model''s
    speed was slightly lower than comparative machine learning models, thereby suggesting
    that future works could include a lightweight deep learning architecture for faster
    training. 10. Conclusions, open issues, and prospects Machine learning techniques
    have successfully been used to identify patterns within nonlinear datasets. This
    study explored the various ML techniques that have been applied within the realm
    of water resources management. Various Machine Learning techniques have found
    significant applications for prediction purposes, ranging from pure forecasting
    to estimating certain parameters of optimisation models. Particularly, implementing
    artificial neural networks has found great success in recent years. Proactive
    and effective water management requires accurate prediction, and several studies
    have shown that standalone deep learning models could outperform conventional
    machine learning models, albeit the data characteristics could substantially affect
    their performance. Specifically, LSTM networks have been proven to exhibit reliable
    forecasting performance and even outperform ANN models, traditional machine learning
    models, and established physics-based hydrological models. Complexifying the architecture
    of LSTM-based models (via stacked structure) has not substantially improved forecasting
    performance. More complex ML models require more data, and thus, the complexity
    of the deep learning model should be in accordance with the data. However, the
    performance of standalone deep learning models could sometimes be limited and
    unable to effectively capture features from multivariate time series. Presently,
    more studies have considered hybrid ML techniques, such as hybrid ANNs, as they
    have shown superior computational power over traditional ANNs architectures. Hybrid
    models combining classic deep learning models such as the LSTM or GRU and decomposition
    algorithms (WT, EMD, and VMD) have shown good performance and should, therefore
    be further developed. The development of hybrid machine learning models has often
    yielded comparable performance in terms of forecasting accuracy. Hence, these
    models could still be further improved and developed, especially for long forecasting
    horizons, as the predictive accuracy has always decreased with increasing lead
    time. Hybrid deep learning models should be more developed than standalone deep
    learning models, considering their superiority in terms of prediction performance.
    Physics-hybrid models, which combine data-driven models and physical models, have
    also proven to improve prediction performance. Physical-based hybrid models are
    commonly either developed by feeding the ML model with the simulation outputs
    of physical-based models, or by forecasting its errors. When forecasting the error,
    the deep learning models can detect the location of most errors made by the physical-based
    models. When using the output of physical-based models as input for the ML model,
    its contribution should be first assessed to ascertain it would add positive impact
    on model performance. Other advanced deep learning architectures, such as transformers
    (Polosukhin et al., 2017), have yet to be tested in water resources management.
    Transformers have so far been successfully used to design neural networks in various
    application domains, including natural language processing, genomic sequences,
    time series data, and signal processing. Such models are known for their general
    structure, which includes an additional layer between the encoder and decoder,
    enabling them a high degree of parallelisation and, hence, faster training. This
    could be a valuable feature when handling complex data, which is very valuable
    given that several studies have shown that several hydrological/meteorological
    variables could contribute positively to prediction performance. Recent studies
    (e.g., Janner et al., 2021) highlighted how transformer architectures can be used
    to simplify reinforcement learning by formulating it into a single big sequence.
    Such an approach provided more capacity and power to reinforcement models in their
    attempt to address decision-making problems via the distributions of rewards and
    actions over sequences of states. Furthermore, transformer architecture offers
    some promising features for dynamics prediction as well as long-horizon dynamics
    prediction, which could tremendously improve groundwater level or river streamflow
    forecasting. In a data-scarce context, implementing Transfer Learning techniques
    could be a potential solution when developing hybridising physical-based and deep
    learning models. In the future, it is thus highly recommended to further employ
    Transfer Learning to improve ML model performance, particularly for long forecasting
    horizons, as predictive accuracy has always been shown to decrease with increasing
    lead times. The implementation of Transfer Learning could substantially improve
    the performance of hybrid deep learning models, and thus enable more informed
    decision-making process in the realm of water resource management and flood defence
    applications. In the real-world context, ML proved to be a powerful tool in water
    resources management, providing insights, predictions, and optimisation capabilities.
    The practical application of ML in the water sector has taken a wide disparity
    of forms, depending on the intended use or desired benefits. For instance, ML
    has successfully been used to develop a Smart Water Networks in Barcelona, Spain,
    where ML and IoT (Internet of Things) technologies were implemented to improve
    water efficiency and reduce losses in the distribution network (Shahra et al.,
    2019). This was done by monitoring water quality, detecting leaks, and optimising
    water distribution using sensors and data analytics. Another example was the application
    of ML for burst locations in water distribution network in Jiangsu province, east
    China (Zhou et al., 2019). They correctly located 57 of 58 synthetic bursts in
    the system. Another practical application of ML is the development and deployment
    of decision support systems (DSS) to help water resources managers and authorities
    to make informed decisions. DSS have also been greatly beneficial for water resources
    allocations in several countries, including the US (WRF-Hydro), Australia (AQUATOR),
    or the Netherlands (HydroNET). These often leverage machine learning to analyse
    complex data including – but not limited to - satellite imagery, real-time sensor
    data, and hydrological and weather data, to make predictions and assist decision-makers.
    ML algorithms have also been implemented to develop an early warning system that
    helps residents and authorities take preventive measures during heavy rainfall
    events (Dong et al., 2022). Weather patterns, river levels, and historical flood
    data are first analysed to enable the system to provide early warnings. All in
    all, Machine learning has become a valuable asset in the water sector, providing
    valuable insights, predictions, and optimisation capabilities applicable in real-world
    practice to enhance sustainable water use and management, and subsequently improving
    socio-economic development, healthy ecosystems and human existence itself. CRediT

    content; water management; time series analysis 1. Introduction The increased
    demand for global food production inevitably leads to the increased irrigation
    and water use of several farming practices, leading to the consumption of 70%
    of the available freshwater globally [1]. Conventional irrigation scheduling is
    mostly based on the farmers’ estimations and experience resulting in the reduction
    of available water for irrigation and it usually takes place in an open-loop fashion,
    where the supplied irrigation volume and the prevailing soil water status are
    indirectly connected; consequently, they appear ineffective mostly due to their
    inability to take into account site-specific, spatially variable factors and weather
    conditions occurring in the irrigated area. For the above reasons, it is crucial
    to implement sustainable, yet effective water management practices towards the
    optimal crop health status, yield, and the minimization of water consumption and
    cost. Precision irrigation practices are based on the assessment of the accurate
    water volume and irrigation period required site-specific to each field, so as
    to enhance yield productivity while also reducing the farmers’ labor costs. The
    above tasks can be achieved through monitoring the soil moisture levels. Soil
    moisture is a critical variable in hydrological, climatic, and agricultural processes,
    influencing everything from plant growth to land-atmosphere interactions. The
    presence of soil moisture is beneficial for agricultural productivity, as it has
    the potential to enhance several physiological and biochemical processes associated
    with crop development and, subsequently, crop yield. Therefore, by acquiring knowledge
    about the soil moisture content, farmers can obtain valuable insights on optimal
    timing for sowing and growing crops, adequacy of soil infiltration, and sufficiency
    of the water supply needed to facilitate crop root growth. The realization and
    understanding of these procedures increases the need for the investigation of
    novel approaches that are capable of precisely estimating the level of soil MC
    in a specific location [2]. For the above reasons, continuous and accurate soil
    moisture records are very important for research and practical applications. However,
    obtaining such records can be challenging due to sensor malfunctions, data transmission
    errors, or environmental interferences [3]. For several decades, the assessment
    of irrigation needs in agricultural systems has relied on the application of conventional
    deterministic and empirical models. These models, rooted in established principles
    and equations, have served as the foundational framework for understanding and
    quantifying the water requirements essential for optimal crop growth. This approach
    has been instrumental in shaping irrigation strategies and resource management
    practices within the agricultural domain, contributing significantly to the sustainable
    development of crop cultivation methodologies. The applied models are typically
    based on already known relationships between key variables such as soil moisture,
    evapotranspiration (ET) rates, environmental conditions, and crop growth stages,
    however, they often fail to take into consideration some other important variables
    affecting irrigation needs, including spatial soil variability, which is attributed
    to natural variation in soil properties and characteristics even within the same
    investigated field. To overcome these limitations, the effective combination of
    deterministic and empirical models, coupled with advanced computational technologies
    such as machine learning (ML), can provide more accurate and adaptive irrigation
    management approaches. ML models can effectively predict key variables in irrigation,
    including ET and MC, with minimal human intervention by capturing their complex
    relationships, adapting to changing conditions, and incorporating nonlinear and
    interactive effects, elevating the potential to revolutionize the prediction of
    soil properties [4]. Wu et al. [5] developed a two-level ensemble model using
    ML models for the estimation of daily evapotranspiration (ETo). The first level
    included Random Forest (RF), Support Vector Regression (SVR), Multilayer Perceptron
    (MLP), and K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), while the second layer contained the Linear
    Regression (LR) model, employed as the meta-learner for results extraction. The
    applied model demonstrated high accuracy, with coefficient of determination (R2)
    values ranging from 0.66 to 0.99. Other common ML approaches for the investigation
    and prediction of MC dynamics included the application of support vector machines
    (SVMs) [6] and adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference systems (ANFIS) [7] for simulating
    times series regarding soil MC, utilizing weather, precipitation, and crop coefficient
    data as input. The aforementioned traditional ML approaches demonstrated satisfactory
    performances compared to the deterministic and physical models, however they appeared
    sensitive to different environmental conditions, unstable in offering reliable
    predictions for the entire range of soil MC levels, and weak in providing insightful
    conclusions when employed in different regions than those that they were initially
    calibrated and developed in. In addition to the weaknesses of traditional ML models,
    the common ANNs models have been widely applied, but they are also limited in
    modelling dynamic data and approximating complex processes due to their tendency
    to lose previously attained and processed information, too [8]. There are some
    commonly applied techniques in order to enhance the performance of the traditional
    ANNs for time series prediction including the addition of extra steps during pre-processing
    [9] and parameters adjustment with the help of genetic algorithms [10]. However,
    preprocessing techniques are time-consuming due to their high dependency on time
    and frequency, and they negatively affect the models’ adaptability to unknown
    environments. The above ambiguities often pose disastrous results to the models’
    prediction performances especially when dealing with highly causal systems. One
    further technique to improve the performance of traditional ANNs is the employment
    of sliding windows. Sliding windows can be employed in an ANN by arranging sequential
    data into windows of defined length that can either overlap or not overlap with
    each other. These windows are then used as input for the model. However, these
    models lack inherent memory mechanisms to retain information from past inputs.
    Each window is treated independently, and the network does not naturally capture
    long-term dependencies in sequential data [11]. For the above reasons, robust
    and scalable data-driven models, in the form of Deep Learning (DL) models, such
    as convolutional neural networks (CNNs), radial basis function networks (RBFN),
    long short-term memory networks (LSTM), recurrent neural networks (RNN) and deep
    belief network (DBN) are employed. Their efficacy lays in their special design’s
    ability to recognize complex patterns through capturing and retaining information
    among large sequential data, and to manage high-dimensional and spatiotemporal
    data resulting in accurate predictions. Among the above-mentioned prediction algorithms,
    the RBFN and LSTM are regarded as highly effective computational tools utilized
    for learning sequential data and are more suitable for predicting time series.
    More specifically, the efficiency of the LSTM models can be attributed to their
    architecture; they are structured of recurrent connected block units that are
    composed of at least one memory cell in order to store and access the information
    for a certain period. The existence of at least one memory cell helps to raise
    their efficiency, while also lowering the gradient error [12]. The self-looped
    cells of the LSTM model are capable of learning long-term temporal dependencies
    in sequential data, simultaneously retaining the information from previous time
    steps [8]. Agyeman et al. [13] developed a predictive control model with discrete
    actuators for predicting irrigation scheduling. In this approach, the soil–water–atmosphere
    system is evaluated with the help of an LSTM model, aiming to assess the optimal
    water uptake in crops. Jetitha and Rajesh [14] proposed a novel approach for irrigation
    scheduling based on a deep bi-directional LSTM model Deep Data Logger and Irrigation
    Activator Unit (D2LIAU). The results indicated that the DBLSTM-based D2LIAU approach
    enables efficient irrigation scheduling with a significantly higher degree of
    reliability in irrigation monitoring since it manages to save water consumption
    from 21.96% to 63.05% when compared to other controlled irrigation practices.
    The main aim of the current study is to demonstrate a hybrid LSTM approach for
    irrigation scheduling prediction. The irrigation needs have been predicted taking
    into account soil, weather, and vegetation data. An LSTM model has been employed
    so as to investigate the predictive capabilities of soil MC reduction per day
    based on the acquired weather data including average daily air temperature, the
    total daily solar radiation (SR), the average daily relative humidity (RH), and
    also the Leaf Area Index (LAI) in two maize fields located in Bakırköy village
    in Karacabey, Turkey. Maize, a widely cultivated cereal crop, is particularly
    sensitive to variations in moisture levels [3]. The study employed an LSTM model
    that integrates data from three distinct sources, including soil sensors, a weather
    station, and satellite imagery. The data measurements from soil sensors, the weather
    station and satellite were acquired on a daily basis for the entire investigated
    period. In order to overcome the lack of MC missing values in Field 1 and the
    limited number of soil MC measurements obtained from only four soil sensors in
    Field 2, the water-driven model Aquacrop 7.0 has been used [15,16] in order to
    compute the daily MC and to acquire data from two extra locations within Field
    2 for the entire investigated period. The limited number of soil measurements
    during the investigated cultivation period has been attributed to some difficulties
    encountered in establishing a reliable and continuous data transmission channel
    between the sensors responsible for MC measurements and the data logger. These
    transmission issues significantly affected the quantity of the MC data collected.
    Aquacrop 7.0 is regarded as a reliable tool due to its proven capability of simulating
    successfully parameters used as input data. These types of data can include soil
    MC, evapotranspiration (ET), and yield in the occasion that they fail to be measured
    in a continuous and accurate manner during experimental field measurements [17].
    In the current study, the failure of acquiring continuous and accurate records
    is often attributed to sensor malfunctions and data transmission errors. However,
    the performance of the LSTM model reveals its significant potential in efficiently
    predicting the future MC reduction in maize fields, overcoming the model’s physical
    tendency to be influenced by the availability and quality of data which is attributed
    both to its architecture and the simulation effect of Aquacrop, introducing novel
    techniques towards more efficient and precise agricultural irrigation practices
    and patterns. Moreover, the current approach encourages the adoption of site-specific
    irrigation patterns that enable Variable Rate Irrigation (VRI), paving the way
    towards enhancing the annual production yields of grains. 2. Materials and Methods
    2.1. Study Area and Data Collection The experimental fields were located in Bakırköy
    village in Karacabey, Turkey (40°08′22.61′ N, 28°22′58.7′ E). An 8.2-ha field
    named Field 1 and a 2.5-ha field named Field 2 cultivated with maize were investigated
    (Figure 1). The type of soil in both fields is alluvial, while the soil texture
    characteristics differ since their percentage content varied between sand, clay,
    and loam clay. The determination of the mechanical composition of the soil was
    performed using the Bouyoucos hydrometer method. The results of this method are
    presented in Section 2.2.4 of this work. The field study was conducted during
    the 2022 growing season. The seeding took place on 16 May in Field 1 and on 11
    May in Field 2. The irrigation system that was utilized was the drip irrigation
    method. Figure 1. A view of the investigated maize fields (Field1 and Field 2).
    The irrigation water is supplied from the buried pressurized irrigation network.
    Field 1 was located in a 20-ha production field that was divided into five irrigation
    plots, each with a maximum area of 4.0 ha. Field 1 coincided with three of these
    plots. Deficit irrigation is common in the region, which was also used in this
    study. The row spacing of the maize crop was 0.7 m, irrigation lateral line spacing
    was 1.4 m, and the number of drippers was 18,000 per hectare during the irrigations.
    Inline linear drippers (Eurodrip -Eolos, Rivulis, Israel) were used in the irrigations
    with an irrigation intensity of 28.8 t/h-ha at an operating pressure of 3 bar.
    A manual valve was used to adjust the specified operating pressure (3.0 bar) of
    the drippers at the end of the secondary irrigation lines to ensure that the water
    pressure is not below 3.0 bar at the most distant lateral. An analog pressure
    gauge (Pakkens 0–6 bar) was used to measure the pressure at the end of the secondary
    (Field 1) and main lines (Field 2). For each irrigation, the farmer changed the
    irrigation time from 6 h to 10 h per irrigation. The farmer utilizes crop water
    demands given in the irrigation guide for the Bursa-Karacabey district and the
    weather station (Metos IMT280) data to determine the application rate for each
    irrigation. The frequency of the irrigations was affected not only by the technical
    data but also the availability of the labor since the irrigation system was not
    automatically controlled. In the early growth stages of the maize crop, the irrigations
    were done in 2–3 days whereas in the rest of the irrigation season the irrigations
    were done in 4–10 days depending on the aforementioned conditions. This type of
    pressurized irrigation system offers several advantages, including a high degree
    of linear control over the water application, optimal nutrient intake, the optimization
    of water usage, and the reduction of water resources waste [18,19]). The quantity
    and placement of the sensors were made according to the relative MZs constructed
    for irrigation. MZs were created based on the precise spatial data of predicted
    soil MC and clay. The aforementioned data were acquired on 28 June 2021 from visible
    and near-infrared spectral measurements, using the online multi-sensor platform
    developed by Mouazen [20]. The data for the development of the utilized LSTM model
    for soil moisture prediction were acquired from three distinct sources including
    soil sensors, a weather station, and satellite-based plant vegetation data. A
    cloud-based LoRA-WAN wireless network was used so that data from soil sensors
    could be constantly collected (Figure 2). The study involved the deployment of
    nine Dragino LSE01 soil sensors in various areas within Field 1, as well as four
    soil sensors in Field 2. The soil sensors were installed vertically at 30 cm depth
    to monitor the soil MC ((%) VWC), apparent electrical conductivity (ECa) (uS/cm),
    and soil temperature (°C). The sensors enable MC measurements using frequency
    domain reflectometry (FDR), and the accuracy of the MC sensors was reported to
    be ±3% by the manufacturer [21]. The accuracy of the sensors was checked during
    the irrigation season once by collecting soil samples at sensor locations, resulting
    in approximately 3–5% errors in soil moisture measurements. No further investigations
    were done to check or improve the measurement accuracy of MC sensors. The sensor
    network gateway was posed about 800 m away from the sensors in a clear view of
    sight. A commercial weather station (Metos IMT280) located near the farm center
    and 3.5 km away from the experimental field was used to collect weather data,
    including air temperature (°C), dew point temperature (°C), solar radiation (W/m2),
    vapor pressure (kPa), relative humidity (%), rainfall (mm), wind speed and instant
    wind speed (km/h), and daily evapotranspiration (mm). Figure 2. LoRa-WAN used
    for soil moisture collection. The availability of free-of-cost, high resolution
    satellite datasets (finer than 30 m) was obtained from sensors such as Sentinel-2
    and advanced open-source tools such as Sentinel Application Platform (SNAP). This
    tool offers accurate and consistent values of LAI. Sentinel-2 images at 10 m resolution
    were used to derive LAI using the built-in Biophysical processor, also called
    the Sentinel-2 Land bio-physical processor (SL2P), within the SNAP Toolbox. The
    Biophysical processor uses eight reflectance bands (B3, B4, B5, B6, B7, B8A, B11,
    and B12) [22]. The utilized Sentinel-2 product was Level-2A. The LAI values were
    obtained from satellite images captured on 23, 26 and 28 June, as well as on 1,
    3, 8, 13, 16, 18, 21, 23 and 26 July and 2 August 2022. It is worthy to note that
    deliberate emphasis has been placed on the selection of imagery acquired on days
    characterized by optimal meteorological conditions. Emphasis was also given to
    instances featuring clear skies, abundant sunlight, and an absence of cloud cover,
    in order to ensure the acquisition of high-quality satellite imagery, defining
    the basis for a precise and reliable extraction of the Leaf Area Index (LAI).
    Recognizing the necessity for a continuous dataset, a linear interpolation method
    was implemented for those days that satellite images were not available. The interpolation
    technique involved leveraging the acquired data points to estimate LAI values
    for the sensor location pixel for the non-captured days, providing a seamless
    and comprehensive analysis for the entire monitoring period and bridging any temporal
    gaps within the dataset. Finally, for the days before the 23 June 2022, the values
    of LAI were equal to 0 as the crop was at the initial stages of growth. LAI, as
    an essential biophysical parameter of vegetation, is a dimensionless variable
    representing the ratio of leaf area to per unit ground surface area. This ratio
    is associated with gas-vegetation exchange processes including photosynthesis,
    evaporation, transpiration, and rainfall interception [23]. 2.2. Methods 2.2.1.
    The Long Short-Term Memory Model (LSTM) Process In the current study, a long short-term
    memory recurrent neural network (LSTM RNN) has been developed. RNNs belong to
    a more complex and advanced type of ANNs networks that are well-suited for modeling
    sequential inputs, such as speech data and natural language data, among others.
    The structure of RNNs is similar to that of feed-forward neural networks or artificial
    neural networks (ANNs). However, RNNs differ from ANNs in that they possess cyclic
    connections, in contrast to the acyclic nature of ANNs. In a typical ANN, information
    tends to flow only in one direction, moving from the input layer through hidden
    layers to the output layer. However, the cyclic connections that characterize
    RNN correspond to the feedback connections between the neurons that allow information
    to be fed back from the output layer to the hidden layers. This special feedback
    design enhances the RNN networks’ capability to learn from their own predictions
    based on previously attained information and refine their representations and
    predictive performance over time. This kind of architecture can be particularly
    useful when dealing with tasks where temporal dependencies or context are crucial,
    like in the occasion of time-series data handling. The cyclic connections enable
    the network to capture and leverage feedback information, making it more effective
    in tasks like sequence modeling [24]. More specifically, in the occasion of a
    RNN, the neurons inside a layer have the capability to establish connections with
    one another, including the possibility of self-connections, a feature that was
    previously not allowed in artificial neural networks (ANNs). Due to their inherent
    cyclic structure, RNNs leverage past inputs to calculate outputs at each iteration,
    enabling them to retain a memory of prior events. This memory is utilized to facilitate
    subsequent predictions. The presence of cyclic links enables the integration of
    prior information into the decision-making process [25]. The diagram in Figure
    3 illustrates the architecture of a recurrent neural network. Figure 3. Structure
    of typical recurrent neural network. Each neuron forms connections with the neurons
    in its own layer, as well as with the neurons in the preceding and next layers,
    and with itself. The LSTM model has been introduced by Hochreiter, and belongs
    to the broader category of RNN models, but in a more revolutionized version. The
    main advantage of LSTM over typical RNNs lies in their short-term memory availability.
    Consequently, as we move on to the next layers, the gradients are preserved so
    that the weight factors are updated and in the occasion that the short-term memory
    is in bidirectional means, the information is preserved in both directions [26].
    Regarding its architecture, the LSTM model is composed of one block with three
    gates, namely the Input Gate, the Forget Gate and the Output Gate. Each gate’s
    activation probability ranges from 0 to 1 corresponding to an open gate and a
    closed gate, respectively. There are some cells capable of recalling information
    and forwarding it to the next gate, while the hidden layer unit in RNN is replaced
    by three gates. The main objective of an LSTM model is to get the output variable
    𝑂 𝑡 by utilizing the equations denoted in Equations (1)–(6). In order to control
    the information flow within the LSTM network, each LSTM unit consists of a hidden
    state vector ℎ 𝑡 , a cell memory state vector 𝐶 𝑡 , and three gates. The architecture
    of an LSTM is presented in Figure 4. Figure 4. Architecture of an LSTM cell, comprising
    three special gates: Input Gate (i), Forget Gate (f), and Output Gate (O). These
    gates control which information is going to be retained, forgotten, and maintained,
    and the volume of information. The first gate ( 𝑓 𝑡 ) is called the Forget Gate,
    which controls to what extent should specific information from the prior cell
    memory state ( 𝐶 𝑡−1 ) be disregarded. The Forget Gate’s output vector is represented
    in Equation (1) as follows: 𝑓 𝑡 =𝜎( 𝑤 𝑓 𝐼 𝑡 + 𝑧 𝑓 ℎ 𝑡−1 + 𝑏 𝑓 ), (1) where 𝑓 𝑡
    denotes the sigmoid activation function that takes values in the set {0,1}, 𝐼
    𝑡 is the input sequence, 𝑤 𝑓 and 𝑧 𝑓 are the adjustable weight parameters, and
    𝑏 𝑓 is the bias vector. At the initial time instant (t = 0), the variables ℎ 𝑡
    and 𝐶 𝑡 are initialized with a vector equal to zero as specified by the user-defined
    parameters of the network. Then, the cell memory state vector undergoes an update
    through the use of a hyperbolic tangent layer, namely the tanh function, which
    is mathematically demonstrated in Equation (2) as follows: 𝐶 𝑡 =𝑡𝑎𝑛ℎ( 𝑤 𝑐 𝐼 𝑡
    + 𝑧 𝑐 ℎ 𝑡−1 + 𝑏 𝑐 ), (2) where 𝐶 𝑡 ∈ {−1,1}, and 𝑤 𝑐 , 𝑧 𝑐 , and 𝑏 𝑐 are additional
    coefficients that can be learned. Furthermore, the output of the second gate,
    known as the Input Gate, regulates the information that is utilized so as to update
    the cell memory state 𝐶 𝑡 at the present time. This is expressed in Equation (3)
    as follows: 𝑖 𝑡 =𝜎( 𝑤 𝑖 𝐼 𝑡 + 𝑧 𝑖 ℎ 𝑡−1 + 𝑏 𝑖 ), (3) where 𝑖 𝑡 ∈{0,1} is sigmoid
    function, and 𝑤 𝑖 , 𝑧 𝑖 , 𝑏 𝑖 are another set of learnable coefficients for the
    input gate. Using the outcomes of Equations (1) and (3), the cell memory state
    vector is modified as follows: 𝐶 𝑡 = 𝑓 𝑡 ⊙ 𝐶 𝑡−1 + 𝑖 𝑡 ⊙ 𝐶 𝑡 , (4) where ⊙ represents
    the multiplication between the gate and cell memory state vector elements. The
    first term of Equation (4) can be interpreted as the information that must be
    forgotten from the previous cell memory state vector 𝐶 𝑡−1 and the information
    that must be stored 𝑓 𝑡 close to one). Similarly, the second term can be interpreted
    as the degree to which new input information must be stored ( 𝑖 𝑡 close to 1)
    and the information that can be neglected ( 𝑖 𝑡 close to 0). The third and final
    gate is the Output Gate ( 𝑂 𝑡 ), which regulates the volume of information acquired
    from the current cell memory state vector, transferred to the next hidden state
    ℎ 𝑡 , and is represented in Equation (5) as follows: 𝑂 𝑡 =𝜎( 𝑤 𝑜 𝐼 𝑡 + 𝑧 𝑜 ℎ 𝑡−1
    + 𝑏 𝑜 ), (5) where 𝑂 𝑡 ∈{0,1} is sigmoid function, and 𝑤 𝑜 , 𝑧 𝑜 , and 𝑏 𝑜 are
    the set of learnable coefficients for the output gate. In addition, the new hidden
    state ℎ 𝑡 is calculated using Equations (4) and (5), and it can be expressed as
    follows: ℎ 𝑡 =𝑡𝑎𝑛ℎ( 𝐶 𝑡 )⊙ 𝑂 𝑡 . (6) Then, the final output of the Long Short-Term
    Memory (LSTM) layer is forwarded to a completely connected dense layer that consists
    of a single neuron. The ultimate predicted output, denoted as 𝑦 𝑝𝑟𝑒𝑑 , is calculated
    by Equation (7): 𝑦 𝑝𝑟𝑒𝑑 = 𝑤 𝑑 ℎ 𝑘 + 𝑏 𝑑 , (7) where ℎ k is the output of the final
    LSTM layer, 𝑤 𝑑 and 𝑏 𝑑 are the weight coefficients and bias term of the fully
    connected dense layer [27]. 2.2.2. LSTM Model Training and Hyperparameter Tuning
    The soil measurements concerned the following variables: electrical conductivity
    (ECa), soil temperature, and moisture content (MC). In this study, MC has been
    solely utilized as the target variable that the model seeks to predict. More specifically,
    the daily MC reduction was determined through utilizing the value of MC for each
    sensor on a daily basis. The soil sensor data were acquired from mid-June to August
    3rd. However, sporadic missing values occurred as a result of transmission failures
    in the data logger. In order to address this issue and acquire a thorough dataset
    regarding the sowing dates, specifically on 11 May for Field 2 and on 16 May for
    Field 1, the Aquacrop program was employed to simulate the moisture content on
    a daily basis. Furthermore, in Field 2, due to the limited number of measurements
    obtained from the four soil sensors, the Aquacrop program was employed to acquire
    data from two extra locations inside the field throughout the entire period. The
    weather measurements were obtained by the utilization of a weather station. The
    meteorological data that was used consisted of the average daily air temperature,
    the total daily solar radiation, and the average daily relative humidity. Furthermore,
    the utilization of Sentinel-2 satellite images was employed to generate the leaf
    area vegetation index (LAI). The data (measured and interpolated) that were used
    for training the LSTM network are visually presented in Appendix A. The objective
    of the model is to forecast the reduction of MC for the next day using the MC
    reduction, the weather data, and Leaf Area Index (LAI) of the previous three days.
    The model underwent testing for a duration spanning from 18 June 2022 to 3 August
    of 2022, corresponding to four distinct phases. During the initial phase, the
    prediction of a decrease in MC between the 18th and 28th of June 2022 was made
    using data from the months of May (corresponding to the sowing date) up through
    to the 17 June, which were utilized for training purposes. Similarly, during the
    period from 29 June 2022 to 12 July 2022, the training process was conducted using
    data from May until 28 June. During the third phase, the model underwent training
    using data from the sowing date until the12 July 2022. The purpose of this training
    was to enable the model to generate predictions for the period between the 13
    and 24 July 2022. In the final phase, the entire available dataset was utilized
    to evaluate the performance of the model in predicting the MC reduction between
    the 25 July 2022 and the 3 August 2022 (Table 1). Table 1. Date periods throughout
    the investigated cultivating period divided into four district phases for training
    and testing of the LSTM model. During each phase, the available training dataset
    was divided into a window of three. The term “window of three” denotes that the
    model takes a sliding window of size three across the sequential data in order
    to predict the next target value. This window starts at the first data point and
    moves one step at a time through the sequence [26]. Furthermore, in each phase,
    the available dataset was partitioned into two subsets. Specifically, 80% of the
    dataset was assigned for training the model, while the remaining 20% was reserved
    for conducting an independent test. Through testing on unseen data, the model’s
    ability to generalize to the desired timeframe can be evaluated. In this study,
    the time series approach is essential because it accounts for temporal dependencies
    and seasonal variations that may affect irrigation requirements. By training and
    testing on discrete time periods, the model does not rely on future data during
    the training phase, preventing data leakage and obtaining objective performance
    metrics. Once the separation is completed, the data underwent pre-processing and
    fusion procedures prior to being fed to the model. Standardization was used to
    transform the features of the dataset so as to take a mean of 0 and a standard
    deviation of 1. Feature level fusion was selected due to the combination of features
    extracted from multiple sources. The selection of the appropriate hyperparameters
    used to train the model was also a significant issue that needed to be addressed,
    as they tend to have a substantial impact on the efficacy of the models. Tuning
    the hyperparameters is crucial, and can be accomplished through a variety of techniques,
    such as grid search, random search, and Bayesian optimization [28]. The grid search
    technique has been chosen for the tuning of hyperparameters. In this method, a
    variety of hyperparameters are evaluated, and finally the one with the highest
    performance on the validation set is chosen. The different hyperparameters that
    were tested (first layer size, second layer size, optimizer, dropout rate, number
    of epochs, batch size) for training each model are demonstrated in Table 2. Table
    2. Tested values of the different deep learning hyperparameters for their tuning
    by grid search. Regarding the selection of the optimization algorithm, the Adaptive
    Moment Estimation (Adam) algorithm appeared to be more performant compared to
    other tested algorithms, such as SGD (Stochastic Gradient Descent) and RMSprop
    (Root Mean Square Propagation), since the Adam’s learning rates can easily adjust
    to the varying gradients during the training of sequences when employing an LSTM
    model [29,30]. The selected Adam algorithm for training was set at a batch size
    of 16 and a total of 80 epochs. In addition, the optimal dropout rate was determined
    to be equal to 0, and the initial LSTM layer was selected with a size of 64, while
    the second LSTM layer was chosen to have a size of 32. An attention mechanism
    was placed between the two LSTM layers in order to enhance the model’s understanding
    of sequences. The method accomplishes this by computing relevance scores between
    a current time step and all other time steps. These scores are transformed into
    attention weights which were used to combine information from all time steps,
    creating an enriched dataset representation. This enriched information is integrated
    into the initial LSTM’s output and passed to the next LSTM layer. This process
    allows the model to emphasize important parts of the sequence, capture long-range
    dependencies, handle various sequence lengths, and produce more accurate predictions.
    The created attention mechanism tends to improve the model’s performance when
    dealing with sequence-related tasks through enabling the model to focus on relevant
    information and to interpret complex patterns [31]. Additionally, certain callbacks
    were involved to further optimize the Grid Search method and the overall performance
    of the training process. Under this framework, three primary callback functions
    were employed including Early Stopping, Model Checkpoint, and ReduceLROnPlateau.
    The Early Stopping callback has been chosen for monitoring the validation loss
    and also for finalizing the training process in case no progress is indicated
    throughout a specified period of epochs, also known as “patience”. In the current
    study, a patience level of 6 epochs has been selected. The Model Checkpoint callback
    was employed to store the model’s weights after each epoch, keeping the epoch
    with the highest validation accuracy, to ensure that the most optimal model will
    be used for future deployment. ReduceLROnPlateau was employed to dynamically adjust
    the learning rate of the optimizer based on the observed behavior of the loss
    function during training. In the current study, the learning rate was set equal
    to 0.0021. The data processing and models development have been implemented using
    the TensorFlow library (version 2.10) within a Python-based programming environment
    (Python version 3.9). 2.2.3. Evaluation Metrics for the LSTM Model The model was
    evaluated, using standard evaluation metrics that are commonly used in regression
    problems, such as the coefficient of determination ( 𝑅 2 ) and the root mean squared
    error ( 𝑅𝑀𝑆𝐸 ). 𝑅 2 ranges from 0 to 1 and it is interpreted as the percentage
    of the variation in the dependent variable that can be attributed to the independent
    variables in the model. The formula for the R2 metric, also known as the coefficient
    of determination, is given in Equation (8) as follows: 𝑅 2 =1−( 𝑆𝑆𝑅 𝑆𝑆𝑇 ), (8)
    where 𝑆𝑆𝑅 (Sum of Squared Residuals) represents the sum of the squared differences
    between the predicted values and the mean of the dependent variable. It measures
    the unexplained variation in the dependent variable by the regression model. On
    the other hand, 𝑆𝑆𝑇 (Total Sum of Squares) represents the total sum of squared
    differences between the actual values and the mean of the dependent variable.
    It measures the total variation in the dependent variable. 𝑅𝑀𝑆𝐸 represents the
    standard deviation of the residuals, i.e., the differences between the predicted
    and actual values. A lower 𝑅𝑀𝑆𝐸 value indicates better accuracy and a closer fit
    of the model to the data. The formula for the Root Mean Square Error ( 𝑅𝑀𝑆𝐸 )
    metric is given in Equation (9) as follows: 𝑅𝑀𝑆𝐸= ( 1 𝑛  ⋅ ∑ (𝑦_𝑝𝑟𝑒𝑑−𝑦_𝑎𝑐𝑡𝑢𝑎𝑙)
    2 ) − − − − − − − − − − − − − − − − − − − − − − − − − − − − √ , (9) where n is
    the total number of data points, 𝑦_𝑝𝑟𝑒𝑑 represents the predicted values from the
    mode and 𝑦_𝑎𝑐𝑡𝑢𝑎𝑙 represents the actual values of the dependent variable [32].
    2.2.4. AQUACROP Model Simulations Precision agriculture has gained momentum with
    the integration of simulation models and ML approaches. A precise estimation of
    maize’s water requirements can substantially augment water usage efficiency. In
    this work, Aquacrop v7.0 has been used [15] to simulate the soil MC so as to overcome
    the soils sensor’s failure to acquire constant or adequate measurements in the
    two investigated maize fields. The MC data derived from Aquacrop have been integrated
    to the existent MC datasets acquired from soil sensor measurements, then were
    employed for the training of the LSTM neural network to determine the maize’s
    water requirements. Aquacrop, developed by the Food and Agriculture Organization
    (FAO), Rome, Italy, of the United Nations, is a widely accepted deterministic
    model that primarily focuses on addressing water needs under different environmental
    conditions. The model is based on the balance between water availability and demand
    and is specialized in handling environments where water availability is limited.
    For maize, specific parameters such as root depth, canopy cover, and soil characteristics
    are used as input data into Aquacrop. The software has built-in templates for
    maize, but for better accuracy, it is essential to adjust settings based on local
    conditions [33,34]. One of the significant features of Aquacrop is its ability
    to utilize basic soil parameters and transform it into hydraulic properties with
    the help of pedotransfer functions, which are essential for performing accurate
    simulation regarding soil MC. The hydraulic properties required for AQUACROP v7.0
    were estimated using pedotransfer functions, derived from the soil texture data.
    In Table 3 and Table 4 the soil texture data and the hydraulic properties (residual
    soil water content θr, saturated soil water content θs, α and n empirical fitting
    parameters and saturated hydraulic conductivity Ks) were estimated using pedotransfer
    functions [35] for the investigated fields Field 1 and 2. These data are used
    to assess the water content of field capacity and permanent wilting point using
    the van Genuchten equation [36]. Table 3. Estimated soil texture and hydraulic
    parameters using pedotransfer functions in different soil sensor locations in
    Field 1. Table 4. Estimated soil texture and hydraulic parameters using pedotransfer
    functions in different soil sensor locations in Field 2. Clay loam soil has a
    balanced texture that includes a mixture of sand, silt, and clay particles. This
    balance allows it to retain moisture while still providing good drainage. Also,
    this type of soil generally has moderate to good infiltration properties. It can
    absorb water without excessive runoff, which is beneficial for crop growth. One
    of the strengths of clay loam soil is its ability to retain moisture. The fine
    clay particles help hold water in the soil, which can be advantageous during dry
    periods. Soil, crop, and meteorological parameters from both investigated fields
    were used as input data for Aquacrop (Table 3 and Table 4). The simulated MC data
    derived from Aquacrop have been integrated to the initial MC dataset acquired
    from the soil sensors, which was utilized for training the employed LSTM model.
    3. Results and Discussion In order to assess and predict the irrigation needs
    for each of the investigated fields, the reduction of MC within a defined period,
    from 18 June 2022 to 3 August 2022 needed to be assessed and predicted as well.
    The dataset was split into four distinct phases in response to fluctuations of
    crop irrigation needs and also to facilitate the repeated training and testing
    loops of the LSTM model to ensure that the developed model will be refined with
    the most pertinent data for every temporal interval, in order to yield the accurate
    predictions. The model predicts the decrease in MC in millimeters (mm) converting
    them using the volumetric water content (% VWC). Table 5 presents the results
    of the LSTM predictions for each of the four investigated phases regarding Field
    1. These findings reveal the model’s effectiveness in estimating the reduction
    in MC within the four designated time periods. Table 5. Coefficient of determination
    (R2) and Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) results of Field 1 on test data. The findings
    derived from the LSTM predictive model demonstrate promising performance in estimating
    the decrease in MC in maize in Field 1 across the four discrete phases. The obtained
    results demonstrate an upward trend in the efficacy of the model as we move through
    the phases, a phenomenon that can be attributed to the increasing size of the
    training dataset. During the initial phase, the coefficient determination (R-squared,
    R2) was determined to be 0.8264, which suggests a significant degree of reliability
    in forecasting the decrease in moisture content. This phase corresponds to the
    time period from16 May to 28 June. During this phase the daily reduction of MC
    was low and exhibited a steady trend. As a result, the model exhibited very good
    performance during this phase, as the patterns observed in the testing dataset
    closely mirrored those present in the training data. Moving to the second phase,
    the R2 remains similarly high to that at phase 1, at 0.8163. While this value
    is slightly lower than the first phase, it remains quite impressive, since during
    this period the reduction in MC was more variable, which can explain the minor
    reduction in performance compared to the first phase. In the third phase, the
    model’s performance improves more, with an R2 equal to 0.8422. This increase in
    performance may be attributed to the continued expansion of the training dataset,
    giving the model the opportunity to capture a wider range of MC reduction patterns.
    The final phase demonstrates the highest R2 of 0.9181. This substantial increase
    regarding the model’s predictive accuracy indicates that the model has become
    exceptionally adept at forecasting MC reduction, leading to the general observation
    that the larger training dataset, that conveyed data from all the three previous
    phases, contributed significantly to enhancing the model’s predictive ability
    for the fourth phase. Figure 5 illustrates the comparison between the observed
    values and the predicted values generated by the LSTM model for each of the nine
    soil sensor locations throughout the first phase in Field 1. Figure 5. Comparison
    between the actual and the predicted MC per location in Field 1 during 1st phase.
    As observed in Figure 5, the reduction in MC at each location is generally minimal,
    with the exception of the final (ninth) day. This phenomenon occurs due to the
    relatively low ET rates during these eight days, leading to a subtle reduction
    of MC. Consequently, the model exhibits a high performance across all locations
    throughout the initial eight-day period. On the contrary, on the ninth day of
    the first phase, a slight deviation between the observed and predicted MC value
    is indicated. In Figure 6 the comparison between the observed values and the predicted
    values derived from the LSTM model for each of the nine soil sensor locations
    during the second phase conducted in Field 1 are depicted. Each panel of the illustration
    portrays a comparison between the three sensors. Figure 6. (a) Comparison between
    actual and predicted MC for locations 2, 3 and 5 during 2nd phase; (b) Comparison
    between actual and predicted MC for locations 7, 9 and 10 during 2nd phase; (c)
    Comparison between actual and predicted MC for locations 12, 13 and 15 during
    2nd phase. The three panels in Figure 6 exhibit a noticeable variation between
    the observed and forecasted values for all sensors for the whole duration. In
    comparison to the first figure, it is evident from the graph depicting the MC
    reduction over the timeframe including 29 June 2022, to 12 July 2022, that there
    has been a notable decrease in MC. The considerable rate of MC reduction can be
    attributed to the significantly elevated levels of evapotranspiration that have
    been prevalent during this period. One particularly noteworthy observation is
    that on day 7, the most substantial decrease in MC from all the nine locations
    in the maize field was recorded. This day appears to have experienced conditions
    that contribute directly to MC reduction, including high temperatures, increased
    solar radiation, and lower relative humidity levels. Figure 7 depicts the comparison
    between the observed values and the predicted values of MC for the third phase.
    Figure 7. (a) Comparison between actual and predicted MC for locations 2, 3 and
    5 during 3rd phase; (b) Comparison between actual and predicted MC for locations
    7, 9 and 10 during 3rd phase; (c) Comparison between actual and predicted MC for
    locations 12, 13 and 15 during 3rd phase. The performance of the LSTM model in
    the third phase appears to be significantly high for all sensors, except sensor
    13. This notably abnormal behavior can be explained by the high content of clay
    in the soil, which contributed to the significant reduction of MC on a daily basis,
    and is comparatively lower in this particular location. The presented figure illustrates
    a consistent and significant daily decrease in MC across all locations. Figure
    8 presents a visual representation of the comparison conducted between actual
    and predicted MC for different locations during the fourth phase. Figure 8. (a)
    Comparison between actual and predicted MC for locations 2, 3 and 5 during 4th
    phase; (b) Comparison between actual and predicted MC for locations 7, 9 and 10
    during 4th phase; (c) Comparison between actual and predicted MC for locations
    12, 13 and 15 during 4th phase. As previously indicated, the estimated values
    closely align with the observed values in this phase. Moreover, it is noteworthy
    that the reduction in MC during this phase is of a higher magnitude compared to
    the previous phases (1st, 2nd and 3rd). The performance of the LSTM model on the
    testing dataset for Field 2 is shown in Table 6. Table 6. Coefficient of determination
    (R2) and Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) results of Field 2 on test data. In contrast
    to the results observed for Field 1, in the occasion of Field 2 the LSTM model
    exhibits lower precision in estimating MC reduction. This difference can be attributed
    to multiple factors, with the limitation of data availability being the main factor.
    Field 2 demonstrates a comparatively constrained dataset compared to Field 1,
    so it would be reasonable to assume that this would have an immediate negative
    impact on the model’s ability to accurately capture and extrapolate the patterns
    of MC reduction. However, it is noteworthy to mention that the performance trends
    observed in Field 2 seem to follow a similar pattern to those of Field 1. In the
    first phase, Field 2 exhibited an R2 value of 0.8392, which indicates a good level
    of reliability. This phase corresponds to a period from 11 May to 28 June, which
    is characterized by a small and steady reduction in MC, making it easier for the
    model to make accurate predictions. However, during the second phase, the value
    of R2 decreases to 0.7602. Such a decrease of R2 in Field 2 can possibly be attributed
    to the increased variability or to the complexity of MC reduction patterns during
    this period, similar to Field 1. In the third phase, the model’s performance improves
    slightly with an R2 equal to 0.7992. Finally, in the fourth phase, Field 2 demonstrates
    an R2 equal to 0.8417. The performance of this phase concerning Field 2 closely
    resembles that of Field 1, indicating the model’s improvement, attributed to the
    inclusion of a bigger training dataset that incorporates data from the three previous
    phases. Figure 9 illustrates the comparison between the observed values and the
    predicted values generated by the model for each of the six soil locations throughout
    the first phase in Field 2. Figure 9. MC comparison per location in Field 2 during
    phase 1. Figure 10 depicts the comparative outcomes between the actual and predicted
    MC after the second phase in Field 2. Figure 10. Comparison between actual and
    predicted MC for locations (a) 8, 11 and 14 during 2nd phase and (b) 16, 17 and
    18 during 2nd phase. At this phase, the model indicates satisfactory results in
    predicting the reduction of MC in locations 11, 14, and 18. For the other locations,
    the model appeared less accurate in predicting the MC reduction values for day
    eight. The uniformity in soil MC reduction during the initial five days, followed
    by variations in the subsequent four days across all six sensor locations, can
    be explained due to the occurrence of several interacting factors during the four
    different phases that contributed to the reduction of MC. More specifically, weather
    conditions, including but not limited to air temperature, humidity and solar radiation,
    hold a pivotal role over the rate of evapotranspiration, which captures both plant
    transpiration and soil evaporation. The constancy in moisture reduction during
    the first five days may be attributed at least partially to the consistent meteorological
    conditions prevailing during the investigated time period. Finally, the progressive
    growth of maize plants over time, followed by the extension and deepening of their
    root systems, contributes to the inevitable decrease of MC since the plants have
    a greater ability to capture water and nutrients from deeper soil layers. Consequently,
    the maize crop development tends to significantly alter the soil moisture kinetics
    patterns. Figure 11 and Figure 12 illustrate the comparison of the observed values
    and the predicted values produced by the model for each soil location during the
    third and fourth phases in Field 2. Figure 11. Comparison between actual and predicted
    MC for locations (a) 8, 11 and 14 during 3rd phase and (b) 16, 17 and 18 during
    3rd phase. Figure 12. Comparison between actual and predicted MC for locations
    (a) 8, 11 and 14 during 4th phase and (b) 16, 17 and 18 during 4th phase. Similar
    to Field 1, the daily changes are substantial due to the heightened evapotranspiration
    during these stages and the greater frequency of irrigation by the farmer. Additionally,
    the model’s performance exhibits improvement during phases 3 and 4, similar to
    what was observed in Field 1. In summary, it can be concluded that the LSTM model
    exhibited encouraging potential forecasting the reduction of MC in maize fields.
    The results validated that the performance of the LSTM model was greatly influenced
    by the availability and quality of data confirming previously conducted research
    in the field [37], which utilized a Bi-LSTM model, and demonstrated a notable
    R2 improvement, benefiting from a comprehensive dataset spanning 14 years. A more
    extended period of investigation would have ideally offered a vast array of data
    for model training through the extensive historical datasets [38] to ensure robust
    predictive capabilities. However, in the current study, irrigation needs have
    been effectively predicted despite the challenge that has been encountered due
    to the soil data measurements’ discontinuity, revealing that predictions for irrigation
    scheduling can be made without the existence of extensive historical datasets
    that often require a span of several years to decades to yield high predictive
    performances. The high performance of the LSTM model is attributed to its special
    asset among traditional RNNs, characterized by its special gates that are responsible
    for controlling the flow, the volume, and the type of the previously attained
    and processed information that is going to be maintained and forwarded from the
    memory cell to the next hidden state. The utilization of the Aquacrop 7.0 model
    to simulate soil MC data due to data limitations in the investigated fields, equipped
    the LSTM model with a consistent and adequate volume of data in order to perform
    precise predictions for irrigation scheduling in maize crops, confirming its effectiveness
    towards the accurate and reliable simulation of moisture content (MC) [17] that
    is also mirrored in our findings. For both investigated fields, the LSTM model
    becomes more efficient in predicting MC reduction as we move through the four
    investigated phases, since the dataset is enriched with data from previous phases.
    The high performance of the model has been assisted by the sufficient number of
    soil sensors which provided a satisfactory volume of measurements. Comparing the
    performance of the LSTM model between the two investigated fields, the results
    appear slightly lower for Field 2 compared to those for Field 1, indicating an
    R2 ranging from 0.7602 to 0.8417 can be explained by the limited data availability.
    However, Field 2 continues to show similar behavior in its predictive ability,
    close to that of the LSTM model demonstrated for Field 1. It is worth noting that
    despite the lack of a sufficient number of sensors, there were only six for Field
    2, the observed variations in MC reduction occur mostly due to the same factors
    that are mostly related to the weather conditions and the expected crop growth
    over time. Incorporating these methods into a comprehensive system, such as the
    predictive irrigation scheduling system we employed, underscores the value of
    integrating real-time data with advanced modelling techniques. This integration
    allows for more effective irrigation strategies, aligning with the broader goals
    of sustainable agriculture and water resource management. The employed LSTM model
    has been proven capable of maintaining its predictive accuracy, highlighting the
    potential for real-time, season-specific irrigation management. This advancement
    is particularly significant in precision agriculture, where timely and accurate
    predictions can lead to more efficient water usage and improved crop management
    strategies. The further enhancement of the Aquacrop model with more comprehensive
    field data, including precise measurements of root distribution and Leaf Area
    Index (LAI), could substantially elevate its accuracy in simulating crop water
    needs. This improvement will enable more precise irrigation scheduling, optimizing
    water usage while ensuring optimal crop growth and yield. In the future, additional
    studies will include the integration of detailed data regarding the root systems
    and canopy characteristics, that are expected to assist the model in reflecting
    the actual water uptake and evapotranspiration patterns of crops in a better and
    more detailed manner, leading to more precise predictions regarding the irrigation
    needs. 4. Conclusions The basis of the present study has been the soil moisture
    data which exhibited non-stationary time series, characterized by a regular periodic
    pattern with significant fluctuations. The above challenge has been faced through
    the application of the LSTM model. The LSTM model has been developed to forecast
    the reduction of soil MC, focusing on the needed amount of water so as to assess
    and cover the required irrigation needs in maize crops. The efficiency of the
    LSTM model has been evaluated based on its forecasting abilities on the impact
    of weather data and satellite extracted data on the reduction of MC in four distinct
    time phases. Based on the results demonstrated above, the performance of the proposed
    model has been estimated as high for both investigated fields despite the limited
    availability of soil sensors in Field 2 compared to Field 1. This demonstrates
    the fact that the LSTM model is a powerful tool for forecasting soil moisture
    dynamics in grain fields. Moreover, the LSTM’s adaptability and robustness in
    predicting the MC reduction, encourages its potential applicability to a variety
    of other precision agriculture practices that require effective handling of sequential
    data such as crop growth monitoring and crop yield prediction. The effectiveness
    of the LSTM model in accurately predicting the soil MC decrease holds the potential
    of revolutionizing agriculture, offering several benefits to farmers, agronomists,
    and policymakers. More specifically, through the adoption of such site-specific
    irrigation patterns enabled by RNN models, Variable Rate Irrigation (VRI) application
    schemes can be adopted, securing and enhancing yield annual productivity in grains.
    Through its integration to decision support systems (DSSs), the LSTM model can
    provide a variety of real-time recommendations in the precision agriculture domain,
    due to the model’s efficiency of taking into account a wide range of factors,
    such as weather conditions and historical data, enabling dynamic and efficient
    irrigation. The above-mentioned ability can be considered as a special asset of
    the LSTM model in securing and improving decision-making in the field of precision
    agriculture. Consequently, farmers can optimize their irrigation scheduling practices
    based on accurate forecasts and policymakers are given the opportunity to use
    these forecasts for evidence-based decisions towards efficient irrigation water
    management and sustainable agriculture in general. Based on the results of this
    study, future work could focus on the design of a predictive irrigation approach,
    where crucial components of crop growth are integrated so as to have a better
    understanding of the future irrigation needs of crops based on the growth stage.

    HarvestFruit Yield Prediction INTRODUCTION UN FAO (Food and Agriculture Organization)
    proclaims that the availability of land area for the crop cultivation will be
    4% in 2050 with additional population of 2 billion to the existing global population.
    This context creates a strong pressure over agricultural production, where there
    will be more demand for food. The food  production obtained from these traditional
    methods of cultivation which have been followed by farmers right now were not
    sufficient or may fail to feed this growing global population. Adaptation of new
    and latest technological solutions for the improvement of farming might be the
    only possible way to meet out the food requirement in future. While Artificial
    Intelligence (AI) proved to support all sectors of agriculture to boost the productivity
    and also helps to control uninvited natural condition. The solution is to create
    a shift in agriculture and to assist us to overcome the challenges in agriculture
    and its application. AI-supported solution makes the farmers to produce more with
    less in addition quality improvement in products. AI technology helps to achieve
    competitive advantage in market. In recent years AI powered systems aids the farmers
    in all process of fruit production such as in irrigation scheduling through smart
    irrigation systems, detection and diagnosis of pest and diseases, weed management,
    precise predictions, etc. AI technology not only improves the farming efficiency,
    it facilitate precise and accurate farming of fruit crops.   Artificial intelligence
    (AI)   The word ‘artificial’ in AI portray ‘non-biological’ and the word ‘intelligence’
    denotes ‘ability to achieve complex tasks’. AI technology is developed based on
    the concept that a technology which think and perform complicated work similar
    to the performance of human brain (Jani et al., 2019; Parekh et al., 2020). Human
    brain remains as most complex organ which contains billions of neurons that are
    connected to each other in a neural network. Meanwhile, AI is a technology to
    develop human brain in digital format by employing various complex algorithms
    (Joseph et al., 2020). This technology execute the function of human brain in
    several way viz., educating itself like humans, finding the reason and solution
    for problems and on critical decision making times act like human. On other word
    AI is machine with human brain.  AI is defining as the study of computer system
    and software which strive to be a model with artificial mind similar to human
    intelligence. It simulates the intelligent behaviour of human beings think and
    act (and in times to come, better than them), accomplish the thought process of
    human in all sensible tasks (Saxena et al., 2020). AI based technologies helps
    to govern the challenges in agriculture such as crop establishment and protection,
    soil nutrient and moisture sensing, improvement of yield with good quality. It
    aids in field management and enhance the field efficiency on the whole (Kim et
    al., 2008).   Scope of AI in agriculture   The Internet of things (IoT) driven
    development    With IoT applications, it is possible to include computers in the
    field of agriculture. A massive volume of data are getting generating each day
    regarding weather pattern, soil report, rainfall pattern, recent research, pest
    attack, disease outbreak, etc. This solution of IOT will sense entire related
    data and impart deep insight to increase the crop yield. IoT system on partnership
    with Image processing system to observe plant growth and to gather information
    related environmental factors. Here, the temperature and relative humidity tends
    to be measured with the help of sensors (such as temperature sensor and humidity
    sensors) which are connected to the IoT network (Lakshmi and Gayathri, 2017).   Image-based
    insight generation   It generates alerts in real time to facilitate precision
    farming which is more focused area in today’s agriculture and also helps in pest
    and disease detection, recognition of nutrient deficiency and more on. For example
    by detecting the real time plant diseases using images will help the farmers to
    act right. Automated system for the identification of plant diseases with the
    help of images of leaves in the image processing system can be achieved through
    Convolutional Neural Networks (Ferentinos, 2018). An automated system is generated
    to recognise various diseases of various crops viz., banana, mango, jackfruit,
    lemon and beans with image segmentation technique (Singh and Misra, 2017).   Identification
    of crop maturity   Quality and further postharvest life of produce highly depends
    on the harvesting the produce at correct stage. As, most of the physiological
    changes are intangible, analysing the ripening pattern of produce under white
    light and UV-A light would help us to distinguish the produce with different level
    of maturity. This helps in accurate categorization of produce and ensure better
    quality and price. The ripening process of fruit can also be monitored through
    Artificial Neural Network that would reveal the most precise physiological state
    of the produce (Altaf et al., 2020).   Recognition of disease   Plant protection
    is the most important part in crop production. Identifying the diseases at their
    early emergence stage will help us to ensure quality of the produce and to reduce
    the cost of cultivation. This can be achieved by image sensing and analysis. The
    images of cropped surface areas divided into different sections such as background,
    diseased area and non-diseased area. From this area with infected section is cropped
    and sent to the laboratory for the identification of pest and to sense any nutritional
    deficiency. For instance, in banana a deep neural networks system is used to detect
    the leaf spot diseases such as sigatoka leaf spot and speckle leaf spot precisely
    without any confusion with the challenging environmental conditions such as, complex
    background, illumination, different resolution, size, pose and orientation of
    the image etc. (Amara et al., 2017).   Automation techniques in irrigation   Now
    a day’s irrigation of crop is done on the basis of decision made by human on their
    own knowledge and experience. But this is an inadequate decision point of human
    on irrigation process. Thus, an automated irrigation system for watering the crop
    is required since water is the most important resources nowadays where the scarcity
    of water resource is another crisis. These automated irrigation system will be
    more accurate than the individual’s own personal judgment and this system will
    also increase water, oxygen and production efficiency. As the AI trained machines
    work on the basis of historical weather pattern, soil quality and type of crops
    to be grown, it provides automated irrigation at optimum level and results in
    positive impact on overall yield (Dharmaraj and Vijayanand, 2018). Above all,
    the automated system helps to prevent the water wastage, decrease the cost and
    loss of work power in the field of irrigation. This system can be easily managed
    remotely with the mobile application as well (Aydin et al., 2021). Using Internet
    of Things (IoT) sensing system and with help of soil moisture sensor, an  automated
    irrigation can be preformed in the orchard of peach where water is turn on and
    off as per the need of crop detected through sensors. (Long He, 2022) with this
    system ease of scheduling irrigation for the fruit orchards become easier for
    fruit growing farmers.   Application of AI in fruit production   The automation
    is essential key area of interest in case of precision farming. Artificial intelligence
    possesses various functional works in agriculture. The most important and few
    examples of AI application in production of fruit crops are given below.   Prediction
    through AI   Presently artificial intelligence systems were utilized for developing
    predictive models for many agriculture practices and monitoring of yield (Panda
    et al., 2010). Though the current methodologies focus on post-harvest yield prediction,
    it is preferable to focus on pre-harvest yield prediction methods for fruit crops.
    Most of the fruit growers estimate their yield by counting fruits during the early
    fruit drop. As the manual methods of yield predictions such as counting, calculating
    by weight of the produce etc., are time consuming and inaccurate, artificial intelligence
    powered models can be exploited. In case of cherry fruit, prediction of two most
    important disease-causing pathogens namely Monilinia laxa and Coccomyces hiemalis
    were done using data mining (Ilic et al., 2018). Gobasco (an artificial intelligence-based
    platform) offers locating, optimization and yield prediction for the agricultural
    produces.  Another interesting method of yield prediction as developed by the
    Robotics Vision lab of Northwest Nazarene University that estimates fruit yield
    by counting the blossoms (Braun et al., 2018). It was found that during the blossom
    period photosynthetic activity tends to increase, which positively correlates
    with the fruiting process. Hence the fruit yield can be estimated by counting
    the blossoms by using the correlation between the blossoms detected in an image
    with the actual number of fruits in the tree. This system of early yield prediction
    is successfully implanted in Pink Lady Apple cultivars (Braddock et al., 2019).
    In Kiwi, firmness of the fruit was measured by predicting N and Ca concentrations,
    including their ratio in fruit at the time of harvest using Artificial Neural
    Networks (Torkashvand et al., 2017).   AI in crop health monitor   The crop health
    monitoring is a critical factor to ensure productivity of crops. Early detection
    of crop infestation with pest, nutrient deficiencies and stress due to climate
    change are needed to mitigate the problems of low productivity. This can be achieved
    by means of high resolution weather data, remote sensing data, AI technologies
    and AI platform. All these provisions make crop monitoring process easy, accurate
    and provide additional insights to the farmers on time. Soilsens technology is
    a low cost smart soil monitoring system to help farmers who facing farming decisions
    predicament. Soilsens system consist of various sensors that includes soil moisture,
    soil temperature, ambient humidity and ambient temperature sensor to make a decision
    on optimum irrigation using mobile app in order to increase the water use efficiency.
    The plantix application is used to determine the potential defects and nutrient
    deficiencies in soil. The analysis is conducted by software algorithms which correlate
    particular foliage patterns with certain soil defects, plant pest and disease.
    This application also detects crop diseases and offers advice regarding respective
    treatment measures for the detected disease by the app. In banana, Fusarium wilt
    (the most common and serious diseases of banana) can be mass diagnosed early by
    using E-Nose integrated autonomous rover system which is fabricated with MOS sensors
    (Sanjay and Kalpana, 2017).  In case of examining the crop maturity in the fruit
    orchard, most of the time manual prediction leads to inaccurate decision. Hence
    precise monitoring equipment that is capable of rapid detection of produce quality
    is desirable, together with a low marketing cost. The E-Nose would be the potential
    tool in this regard, as it monitors the production of volatile organic compounds
    in the crop with specific situation. Thus indirectly monitor and evaluating the
    crop growth at real time (Voss et al., 2019).   AI in crop protection   Plant
    protection is crucial in crop production because of its complexity in understanding
    the cause and lagging tools for detection of specific infections as well for the
    prediction of condition that were favorable for infections. A cost-effective automated
    system comprising AI and machine vision are used to recognize, differentiate and
    geo-locate citrus psyllid (Diaphornia citri) in orchard of citrus (Partela et
    al., 2019). Utilizing deep learning models in image processing and recognition
    system is a latest technology to spot diseases of different crops through visible
    symptoms captured in précised manner. Several banana pest and disease are identifiable
    even by the persons who lack knowledge on symptoms produced due to infection of
    various pest and diseases of banana with the help of detection model developed
    using artificial intelligence with deep learning systems (Selvaraj et al., 2019).  A
    knowledge-based system for apple diseases helps the farmers to identify the symptoms
    and cause of various diseases and treats the disease whenever possible (Shawwa
    and Naser, 2019). Similarly, in pineapple a knowledge-based expert system for
    detection of various diseases and recommendation of disease management method
    for pineapple diseases (Shawwa and Naser, 2018). Likewise, in banana a knowledge
    based expert system was developed to manage banana diseases to have insights on
    to the diagnosis and treatment of various diseases in banana (Almadhoun and Naser,
    2018). The most common postharvest disease of Golden Delicious apple was able
    to identify with aid of an electronic nose (E-Nose) technology during processing
    and packing of apples (Jia et al., 2019).   AI in harvesting of fruits   AI powered
    solution for ease of harvest lower the cost of man power utilize for harvest as
    well harvest the produce at right time. Mechanical vibration harvester is used
    to harvest walnut. This harvester comprises two mechanism namely clamping and
    exciting mechanism. Here mechanical force used to create vibration at definite
    frequency and amplitude which makes fruits fall off from branches and are collected
    on loading device (Yang, 2020). In other words, the vibration accelerated to weaken
    the binding force of fruits to branches which facilitates harvest of walnuts precisely
    (Rapur and Tiwari, 2018).   Future scope   Research in AI technology is still
    in progress and hence research on artificial intelligence is covering wide area.
    Till now precision in AI in agricultural sectors are lagging a hundred percent
    precision. This inaccuracy made will miss lead farmers to make decision. However,
    practical feasibility is more important which serve as the proof for success of
    the developed system. There are various future scopes for AI-driven sensors in
    agriculture. Agricultural scientists specifically, pomologists may focus more
    on these AI-driven sensors which helps to improve fruit production and productivity.
    Image processing and detection through AI system helps to protect crops from any
    kind of attacks and this helps farmers to control more uninvited condition. Until
    the technology reaches the farmers the developed technology never attains its
    true success. Hence, it is recommended to make the developed technology accessible
    to commercial fruit growers in wider scale through any TOT (Transfer of Technology)
    centers. CONCLUSION Artificial Intelligence (AI) a technology developed based
    on the concept that a technology which think and perform complicated work similar
    to the performance of human brain. This technology execute the function of human
    brain in various way like educating itself like humans, finding the reason and
    solution for problems and on critical decision making times act like human. On
    other word AI is machine with human brain. There are several evidences that AI
    is an efficient tool to improve farming efficiency. However, the application of
    AI in fruit yield predication, pest and disease recognition and fruit harvesting
    techniques are discussed detailed in this paper. Finally, AI can help humanity
    and also has efficiency to solve the problem of food requirement of future generation
    with limited resources irrespective of climate. Moreover, many researches on Artificial
    Intelligence are at primary stages whereas their precision level needs little
    more precise as well as their practical feasibility are under checked. Researchers
    should focus the problems of AI discussed in this paper and make the AI model
    to next level. CONFLICT OF INTEREST All authors declare that they have no conflict

  description: The agricultural sector faces several difficulties today in ensuring
    the safety of food supply, including water scarcity. This study presents the design
    and development of a low-cost and full-featured fog-IoT/AI system targeted towards
    smallholder farmer communities (SFCs). However, the smallholder community is hesitant
    to adopt technology-based solutions. There are many overwhelming reasons for this,
    but the high cost, implementation complexity, and malfunctioning sensors cause
    inappropriate decisions. The PRIMA INTEL-IRRIS project aims to make digital and
    innovative agricultural technologies more appealing and available to these communities
    by advancing the intelligent irrigation “in-the-box” concept. Considered a vital
    resource, collected data are used to detect anomalies or abnormal behavior, providing
    information about an occurrence or a node failure. To prevent agro-field data
    leakage, this paper presents an innovative, smart, and sustainable low-cost irrigation
    system that employs artificial intelligence (AI) techniques to analyze anomalies
    and problems in water usage. The sensor anomaly can be detected using an autoencoder
    (AE) and a generative adversarial network (GAN). We will feed the autoencoders’
    anomaly detection models with time series records from the datasets and replace
    detected anomalies with the reconstructed outputs. When integrated with an IoT
    platform, this methodology is a tool for easing the labeling of sensor anomalies
    and can help create supervised datasets for future research. In addition, anomalies
    can be corrected by prediction models based on deep learning approaches, applying
    CNN/BiLSTM architecture. The results show that AEs outperform the GANs, achieving
    an accuracy of 90%, 95%, and 97% for soil moisture, air temperature, and air humidity,
    respectively. The proposed system is designed to ensure that the data are of high
    quality and reliable enough to make sound decisions compared to the existing platforms.

    to increase by close to 2 billion by 2050, causing a rapid escalation in food
    demand. To cater to the needs of the increasing population, the agricultural industry
    needs to be modernized, smart, and automated [1]. The food and agriculture organization
    (FAO) [2] claims that small-scale farming significantly contributes to rural economies
    and food security. On the other hand, smallholders usually deal with a range of
    restrictions that reduce their ability to produce profitably and advance the economy
    [3]. However, smallholder farmer communities (SFCs) have not benefited from adopting
    solutions to increase irrigation efficiency because of the high starting costs
    and the high skill levels needed to understand the technology. Recently, the fourth
    industrial revolution (IR 4.0) paradigm shift has ushered in a surge in technological
    innovation and sustainable transformation across various industries and sectors
    [4]. The innovative use of printed sensors for measurement and monitoring in smart
    agricultural applications has garnered considerable attention. Smart farming utilizing
    printed sensors is in its infancy and requires additional research [5]. Significant
    limitations restrict SFCs’ productivity and profit potential. As a result of a
    variety of crucial issues, including a lack of agricultural expertise, financial
    resources, climate change, and market access to address these challenges, we propose
    in this research a low-cost (USD 260) smart farming system for monitoring and
    prediction that will assist SFCs in forecasting future data in order to compute
    their water demands and properly schedule irrigation. The sensor component employs
    a low-cost design that is basic but sturdy and efficient, inspired by various
    do-it-yourself (DIY) initiatives and previous contributions [6,7]. In terms of
    accuracy and error reduction, the system outperforms others. In this context,
    the goal of the PRIMA INTEL-IRRIS project [8] is to increase the visibility and
    accessibility of digital and smart agricultural technologies among small and medium-sized
    farms. To meet the needs of this community, the suggested solutions must be economical,
    easy to implement in the field, and, most importantly, adaptable to current agricultural
    techniques. As a result, by inventing a low-cost, smart irrigation control system,
    INTEL-IRRIS hopes to transform the view that SFCs have of what was formerly highly
    expensive technology. INTEL-IRRIS also hopes that by using the “intelligent irrigation
    in a box” idea, they can make smart irrigation systems as easy to set up and use
    as home appliances, with a small investment compared to how much money they make.
    The main objective of this research is to improve on our previous work [3,9] by
    increasing the accuracy of low-cost sensors for data collection so that our water–soil–plants–climate
    interaction models will provide increased accuracy of predicted environmental
    factors to enhance the irrigation efficiency of smallholder farmers. There is
    a current need for our low-cost fog-IoT/AI system, version 1.0, that employs deep
    learning to analyze in real-time the anomalies and problems that appear in low-cost
    sensors. To reach this goal, we propose a low-cost, sustainable irrigation system
    that helps smallholder farmers manage irrigation more efficiently by providing
    a low-cost, open-source, autonomous, and easy-to-use smart irrigation control
    system that takes advantage of IoT capabilities, as shown in Figure 1. Figure
    1. “Intelligent irrigation in a box” idea of PRIMA INTEL-IRRIS project. We will
    implement the “Intelligent Irrigation in a Box” idea by presenting a sensor/ control/actuator-based
    “plug-and-sense” system using significant technological advances from the last
    few years, including IoT, artificial intelligence (AI), and decision support systems
    (DSS). This technology may be linked with existing irrigation infrastructure [10,11],
    allowing it to be controlled according to smallholders’ customs. Using sensor
    technologies, the provided platform collects critical physical phenomena such
    as soil moisture, air temperature, air humidity, water level, water velocity,
    and light intensity using a DL methodology. An unsupervised learning approach
    is well-suited for detecting anomalies, especially in cases with limited labeled
    time-series samples and complex, nonlinear climate and soil patterns. According
    to the literature, the most promising approaches for anomaly detection are Autoencoders
    [12] and GANs [13] in time series. The sliding window technique is highly appropriate
    for predicting future sensor readings through a supervised learning approach.
    Utilizing a hybrid deep learning architecture, combining convolutional and recurrent
    neural networks, enables the attainment of a minimal estimation error for similar
    sequence-to-sequence prediction problems [14]. Consideration is given to a novel
    Fog-IoT-Cloud platform for storing, analyzing, and using vast volumes of acquired
    data to assist SFCs in managing the irrigation mechanism efficiently. This work’s
    main contributions are as follows: (i) The design and development of a low-cost
    fog-IoT/AI system, version 1.0, fully targeted towards smallholder farmer communities
    (SFCs) to enhance irrigation decision making. (ii) We provide a comprehensive
    performance assessment and comparison between the autoencoders (AE) and generative
    adversarial networks (GAN) to detect anomalies in environmental factors data.
    (iii) Predicting the most important environmental factors (air temperature, air
    humidity, soil moisture) based on field sensory data and weather forecast data
    using CNN/BiLSTM architecture to provide SFCs with recommendations. The rest of
    the paper is structured as follows: Section 2 presents a review of the relevant
    literature on irrigation systems. The INTEL-IRRIS fog-IoT/AI system, at the heart
    of the architectural design discussed in this paper, will be presented in Section
    3. Sensor anomaly detection for smart irrigation systems is provided in Section
    4. Section 5 describes the most important environmental factors that can be predicted
    using deep learning. Finally, conclusions and future trends are given in Section
    6. 2. Related Studies In this section, we present a review of the relevant literature
    on irrigation systems. Each of them has focused on various aspects of the irrigation
    task. As illustrated in Table 1, we categorize the studies based on the following
    criteria: (i) Underground sensing: the IOUT requirement emerges partially or fully
    buried underground for real-time monitoring and soil sensing; several essential
    irrigation characteristics include soil moisture, soil texture, soil salinity,
    etc. (ii) Environmental sensing: it is used to monitor important weather pattern
    changes in real-time. (iii) Geographic information systems (GIS): provide a potent
    instrument for near-real-time analysis of crop status. Ground-based equipment,
    aerial drones, and satellites all collect GIS agriculture data. (iv) Soil texture:
    on precision agriculture (PA), we computed the useable reserve of water (RU) based
    on the soil texture (clay, limon, sand, organic matter). (v) Machine learning
    approaches: it indicates whether the study considered machine learning approaches
    for intrusion detection systems. (vi) Deep learning approaches: it specifies if
    the study was focused on deep learning approaches for intrusion detection systems.
    (vii) Low-cost: the objective of the Intel-Irris project is to use low-cost sensors
    by dividing the cost by a factor of 10 to 100. (viii) Anomaly detection: the detection
    of anomalies is a crucial stage that will enhance the quality of results in predictive
    modeling and pattern extraction, enabling the identification of problems and facilitating
    decision making in data-based services. In our previous works [3,9], we suggested
    an Edge-IoT-Cloud platform based on a deep learning methodology for monitoring
    and predicting farmers’ ability to satisfy crop water demands when there is insufficient
    rainfall. Recently, Citoni et al. [15] published a review and analysis of currently
    available LoRaWAN-enabled Internet of Things (IoT) applications for intelligent
    agriculture. Vuran et al. [16] focus only on the underground factors; however,
    environmental sensing and SIG play a very important role in irrigation tasks.
    Optimizing water resources for agricultural production using an automated irrigation
    system has proven feasible and cost-effective, as proposed by Gutierrez et al.
    [17]. Table 1. A comparative analysis between the proposed platform and previous
    platform.   A few scientific studies focus on the application of data processing
    techniques to agricultural data in order to develop a more robust decision support
    framework. Roopaei et al. [22] presented an appropriate approach to identifying
    key parameters to schedule irrigation: the amount of water used was monitored,
    irrigation was scheduled on the basis of the canopy temperature distribution of
    the plant, and data were collected by means of thermal imaging. However, using
    the thermal imaging technique has many drawbacks that affect irrigation scheduling:
    different emissivities and reflections from surfaces obstruct precise temperature
    measurements, and most thermal imaging cameras have ±2% accuracy. Also, thermal
    images are difficult to interpret for specific objects with erratic temperatures.
    Aurora et al. [25], using unsupervised algorithms, devised and tested a three-step
    irrigation system for urban parks. By extracting prior knowledge using a multivariate
    approach, this methodology reduces the time required by univariate anomaly detection
    systems to analyze the entire univariate time series. Goap et al. [19] proposed
    a smart irrigation architecture based on IoT and a hybrid approach that relies
    on DL to predict soil moisture. The proposed algorithm uses sensor data collected
    from recent and past weather forecasts to predict soil moisture. However, environmental
    sensing is not sufficient to make a good irrigation schedule, and the authors
    also do not take into consideration the crop coefficient and the soil texture.
    Chen et al. [26] suggest a new approach for making irrigation decisions in paddy
    rice farming that uses deep Q-learning and short-term weather predictions. The
    new method was compared to the widespread practice of flooded irrigation in southern
    China. The results indicated the reliability of the daily rainfall forecast and
    the efficiency of the Deep Q-Learning strategy for saving water. Boursianis et
    al. [23] discussed the AREThOU5A IoT platform subsystems and their primary operations,
    as well as the deployed layered architecture stack. Within the context of the
    AREThOU5A IoT platform, an innovative method for delivering power to the platform’s
    IoT modules has been implemented. Cheema et al. [24] constructed an intelligent
    system with multiple sensors and devices related to internet of things (IoT) technologies.
    In addition, they developed an Android application called \"Kistan Pakistan\"
    that allows illiterate and low-literate farmers to remotely administer its functions.
    Pham et al. [20] described a low-cost and full edge-IoT/AI system targeting smallholder
    farmer communities and how it can provide the intelligent irrigation “in-the-box”
    concept. It offers an “out-of-the-box” function, meaning that the control component
    that recommends irrigation is integrated into the IoT gateway and, as a result,
    does not need an internet connection, as implemented by WAZIUP partner [27]. In
    contrast to previous research, the current study incorporates four factors to
    improve irrigation efficiency, productivity, quality, profitability, and the sustainability
    of agricultural production. In particular, we take into account the following
    factors: (i) soil texture; (ii) crop coefficient; (iii) sensed data with the weather
    forecast; and (iv) sensing of the subsurface parameter, in this instance, soil
    moisture. The objective is to calculate the requisite water quantity based on
    these variables. 3. Supplying Smallholder Farmers with Smart Technology 3.1. A
    Summary of the INTEL-IRRIS and PNR Projects As stated earlier, INTEL-IRRIS [8]
    aims to make digital and intelligent agricultural technology more appealing and
    accessible to small and medium-sized farms. However, a compromise will be made
    to accomplish the primary aim: to create a low-cost irrigation system that SFCs
    can implement out of the box. The soil moisture sensor component follows a basic,
    resilient, and cost-effective design that has been substantially influenced by
    several do-it-yourself projects and prior contributions [6,20]. Unlike low-cost
    sensors that often offer unreliable data, INTEL-IRRIS will significantly improve
    the quality of collected data with (i) improved calibration of various sensors;
    (ii) the calculation of the needed amount of water based on the farm’s soil texture
    and crop coefficient; and (iii) the prediction of environmental factors based
    on field sensory data using DL. 3.2. Smart and Sustainable Irrigation System Figure
    2 shows how the smart farming system architecture collects, transfers, and processes
    physical parameters from small-scale farming, such as soil moisture, air temperature,
    air humidity, water level, water flows, the intensity of light, combustible gas,
    etc., in order to improve irrigation efficiency by deploying a low-cost, open,
    autonomous irrigation control system based on IoT and AI techniques [28]. The
    irrigation scheduling algorithm determines the amount of water required to maintain
    the maximum production potential without wasting water (i) for a particular crop,
    (ii) at a specified time, and (iii) for a specific soil type. The following section
    summarizes the proposed platform’s details. Figure 2. Global view of our proposed
    operational architecture. 3.3. Hardware Architecture As illustrated in Figure
    2, the network component of our platform is supplied via multi-hop communication
    between box A (the sensor layer) and box B (the gateway node) up to box C (the
    fog layer). Finally, a virtual machine (VM) is created on the Azure cloud to deploy
    multiple anomaly detection and prediction models. In addition to using NRF24L01
    modules for wireless communication and Arduino boards as microcontrollers, we
    also intended to use Raspberry Pi 3 B+ boards as a fog layer. 3.4. Software Architecture
    Using open-source development tools, we created a software architecture to reduce
    bandwidth, latency, cost, load balancing, and scalability, as shown in Figure
    3. Using the Message Queuing Telemetry Transport (MQTT) protocol, communication
    between the gateway and server is established. The TCP transport layer protocol
    ensures dependable data transmission (COAP uses UDP). Because of this, it is encrypted
    with SSL, supports quality of service (QoS parameter 2: requires messages to be
    delivered exactly once), and has a much shorter message header than HTTP. Figure
    3. Global view of our software architectural proposal. 3.5. Box A: Sensing Node
    The sensing node, which depicts the field data gathering tool, falls short of
    the total of USD 140. An Atmega328 microprocessor reads the output from these
    sensors. For around two dollars (USD), it may be used to construct a cheap design
    strategy for the Arduino. As seen in Figure 4, this box’s sensor layer devices
    are designed to collect data from smallholder farmers and transmit it using the
    NRF24L01 radio module, which is available for roughly 5 dollars (USD) and enables
    the supply of a radio communication layer with an SPI interface. The farmer can
    examine the data and keep an eye on the crops in real-time since the data may
    be kept in a private database or in the cloud to construct a dataset. Figure 4.

    and NRF module are in the box. Figure 4 provides a comprehensive description of
    the box’s sensors. We then set the NRF24L01 module to write mode and supply the
    destination address; we read the sensor values using the analogRead function on
    the data pins. The measured data are structured and transmitted to the IoT gateway
    every hour, where historical data are stored to detect anomalies at the fog layer.
    For the power supply of the sensor node, we used rechargeable 9 V batteries. Table
    2 lists the cost of all components. In total, a sensing and actuation node costs
    USD 260. A large portion of the budget is for the cost of box C. Table 2. The
    proposed platform cost. 3.6. Box B: Relay Node The relay node acts as an intermediate
    device and transmits the packets to the IoT gateway. In listening mode, we set
    up the gateway node by supplying the node address from whence the packets come,
    the channel number (122), and the data structure; if the data are received, it
    changes to sending mode, at which stage we provide the address of the next node.
    The power supply of the relay node was improved by using two AA batteries. 3.7.
    Box C: IoT Gateway Fog computing facilitates the operation of computation, storage,
    and networking services between end devices and cloud computing. Box C permits
    data to be transmitted to the internet network, but not for a total of USD 90.
    We picked a Raspberry Pi 3 B+ type board since it has adequate hardware resources
    for processing and is based on the Linux kernel, making it compatible with most
    languages and AI libraries. It needs a 5 V power supply, an external Wi-Fi 802.11
    card, and an Ethernet connector to connect to the internet. We used Python to
    create a concurrent TCP server (one thread per request), and we started by loading
    the prediction models from disk into the main memory (the kind of “*.tflite” files
    after the conversion to Tensorflow Lite). When a request comes in, a thread handles
    the receiving and preprocessing, resulting in the prediction. If we are looking
    for anomalies, we must compare the model outputs to an error threshold and provide
    the answer. On demand, we can also utilize the service to adjust the error levels
    of the various models. The server regularly delivers messages that include information
    such as the node’s IP address, available resources (RAM and CPU), and network
    latency. NodeJS listens on the serial port “/dev/tty0” at 115,200 baud. We extracted
    the measurements whenever new data were written to the port (separated by commas).
    We verified that all of the sensors were operational. This information is saved
    in the MySQL database for the time being. Finally, we produced a structured package
    including the latest six readings of each sensor, which had to correlate to the
    detection model anomaly entries. Then, we transmitted the latter to the Python-implemented
    service, which includes the various models; after receiving the answer, we checked
    for anomalies. An HTTP server configured using the “Express” module and listening
    on port 7000 sends the application pages to the browser. The route to each page
    is specified, and communication occurs via the “WebSocket” protocol. Every hour,
    a temporal event is triggered, which transmits the last received packet if none
    has come, allowing us to forecast it. The integrated Wi-Fi card is employed as
    an access point for configuration and adjusting the thresholds of anomaly detection
    models (leaving a means to reach the local network). Finally, data visualization
    from the gateway is required to assist the developer during maintenance. We investigated
    adding slave nodes that handle resource-intensive processing to enhance computing
    power and load balancing. The Raspberry Pi 3 B+ card’s Wi-Fi card creates a wireless
    network that the cluster uses to communicate. 3.8. Cloud Layer We suggest using
    cloud services to store significant volumes of data generated by sensors in order
    to guarantee the accessibility and availability of our platform everywhere and
    at any time. Furthermore, we use them to anticipate future meters, ensuring scalability
    and more resources when our platform is overloaded (elasticity). A free student
    offer was provided to us, and we will utilize it to create a VM with a public
    IP address that we can access via the remote desktop protocol (RDP). As seen in
    Figure 5, Influx DB offers a limited free cloud service, so setting up a user’s
    dashboard for data analysis and monitoring is straightforward. Figure 5. Monitoring
    and analysis of data on the cloud service. 4. Sensor Anomalies Detection for Smart
    Irrigation Systems Deep learning is becoming increasingly popular for tasks beyond
    image recognition, segmentation, and classification. Non-image data have been
    gaining more and more attention in recent years due to the advancement of IoT
    [29]. The main idea of unsupervised anomaly detection in time-series data is to
    identify whether data observations conform to normal data distributions over time.
    With this technique, we can discover patterns and anomalies that are otherwise
    hard to find. In order to spot unexpected patterns or anomalies as the data changes
    over time, it is crucial to comprehend how each variable within the time series
    affects the others. As shown in Figure 6, the received measurements are consolidated
    with the time series records in the local database. These merged data are used
    as input for anomaly detection models, which aim to identify any anomalies or
    unusual patterns within the data. The reconstructed inputs from the model are
    employed to estimate a corrected value for the abnormal measurement. The goal
    is to correct any inaccuracies or abnormalities identified in the original measurement.
    Once the new measure has been adjusted using the sensor value estimation model,
    it is stored back in the local database. This ensures that the corrected measure
    is available for future reference or analysis. In our research, the scarcity of
    labeled anomaly data poses a challenge. Therefore, GANs and AEs present advantageous
    options as they can effectively perform anomaly detection. Additionally, these
    techniques are capable of learning representations that capture both global and
    local dependencies within the data, enabling them to understand complex patterns
    effectively. GANs, in particular, leverage a discriminator network that can accurately
    classify anomalies. AEs focus on reconstructing input data and strive to minimize
    the reconstruction error. A threshold on the reconstruction error allows for the
    efficient identification of anomalies. Figure 6. Illustration of IoT gateway sensor
    anomaly detection and correction process. 4.1. Generative Adversarial Networks
    (GAN) Unsupervised anomaly detection using generative adversarial networks (GAN),
    as illustrated in Figure 7, involves training two models: a generator and a discriminator.
    The generator learns a model representing normal time series variability, while
    the discriminator learns to identify data points that do not conform to the normal
    behavior. The discriminator can then distinguish between time-series data corresponding
    to normal behavior. Moreover, using GANs for unsupervised anomaly detection in
    time-series data helps identify more complex anomalies than traditional methods
    since it can learn more complex dependencies between different variables within
    the time series (backpropagation). Figure 7. Overview of GAN structure. 4.2. Autoencoder
    (AE) Autoencoders are popular-deep learning-based anomaly detection models that
    have been observed to be reliable and effective. What makes this model so successful
    is its ability to reduce the time-series data to a lower dimension and reconstruct
    them in a higher dimension. As illustrated in Figure 8, this encoding and decoding
    can be performed with the help of different deep learning layers, such as convolutional
    layers. Then, the data are decoded to a higher dimension using an autoencoder
    algorithm. These reconstructed data can then be compared to the primary data to
    detect anomalies. Autoencoders have been a successful tool for anomaly detection
    in time-series data. Their efficiency can even be increased with the use of regularization,
    dropout, and noise-reduction techniques. Moreover, the autoencoder model is able
    to independently extract features from the input data, leading to better accuracy
    and lower computing costs. Figure 8. Overview of autoencoder network architecture.
    4.3. Problem Formulation Considering a time-series dataset 𝐷=[ 𝑋 1 ,  𝑋 2 ,…,  𝑋
    𝑛 ]∈ ℝ 𝑡×𝑛 , where each 𝑋 𝑖 =[ 𝑥 1𝑖 ,  𝑥 2𝑖 ,…,  𝑥 𝑡𝑖 ]∈ ℝ 𝑡 (for 𝑖=1,…,𝑛 ) comprising
    data obtained from sensors over a specific period of time t, the suggested model
    is trained with a subset of the dataset 𝐷 𝑡𝑟𝑎𝑖𝑛 ∈ ℝ 𝑡×𝑘 which only contains normal
    samples, where k is the number of training samples. The samples for testing are
    𝐷 𝑡𝑒𝑠𝑡 =[ 𝐷 𝑣 𝑡𝑒𝑠𝑡 , 𝐷 𝑢 𝑡𝑒𝑠𝑡 ]∈ ℝ 𝑡×(𝑣+𝑢) , with v and u representing the number
    of normal and abnormal samples, respectively, and 𝑛=𝑘+𝑣+𝑢 . Due to the imbalanced
    nature of the time-series data, the size of normal samples is greater than that
    of abnormal samples. A GAN-based model is trained with 𝐷 𝑡𝑟𝑎𝑖𝑛 to reduce the output
    for each output 𝑋 𝑖 in 𝐷 𝑡𝑟𝑎𝑖𝑛 . After the training process as shown in Appendix
    A, 𝐷 𝑡𝑒𝑠𝑡 is passed through the trained model to evaluate it according to unseen
    samples during the learning. The trained generator can then generate fake normal
    samples from the noise vector. The discriminator model is used to accurately classify
    samples into normal or abnormal sequences. Autoencoders can be used as techniques
    for unsupervised or semi-supervised anomaly detection. To train an autoencoder,
    this technique involves training a model on a dataset that contains only normal
    data. We use a supervised learning approach by dividing the dataset into training
    and testing sets. The training 𝐷𝑡𝑟𝑎𝑖𝑛 and testing 𝐷𝑡𝑒𝑠𝑡 sets are divided into
    input and output components by applying the sliding window approach. This approach
    uses the previous time intervals as both the input and output variables. This
    technique allows us to apply supervised learning to the autoencoder network. To
    evaluate the performance of the trained model, we used the reconstruction error,
    ℒ(𝑥, 𝑥 ̂  ) , which measures the differences between the original input and the
    consequent reconstruction. The amount of discrepancy between a reconstructed representation
    and the original instance is used to calculate the anomaly score. The larger the
    difference, the greater the probability that it is an outlier. Moreover, the cutoff
    point for identifying anomalies can be adjusted by employing cross-validation
    to determine the most suitable threshold (Th) for the reconstruction error. 4.4.
    Dataset Preprocessing The data used in this analysis were obtained from distinct
    sources, as shown in Table 3. These datasets were selected as they encompass soil
    and weather information and have the same hourly sampling rate to address the
    univariate anomaly detection and forecasting queries. The transformation for anomaly
    detection models involves three steps. Firstly, the time series are scaled between
    0 and 1 using MinMaxScaler. This is an important step as it helps the network
    learn faster and converge with ease. Secondly, the time series is split into training,
    testing, and validation data. The training set consists of the first 80%, the
    testing set consists of the next 10%, and the validation set consists of the last
    10%. Lastly, the training and testing splits are divided into input and output
    components by using the sliding window technique with sequence length 6 for anomaly
    detection models. Table 3. Description of datasets used to train deep learning
    models. 4.5. Implementation We implemented a Generator network to produce fake
    samples. As shown in Table 3, it consists of one-dimensional convolution, LSTM,
    and dense layers with a binary cross-entropy loss function. Binary cross-entropy
    measures the performance of a binary classification model whose output is a probability
    value between 0 and 1. We implemented a Discriminator Neural Network that outputs
    a score for each sample, indicating whether it belongs to the real or fake sample.
    This Discriminator consists of one-dimensional convolution, LSTM, and dense layers.
    To obtain a probability value, a Sigmoid activation function is applied to the
    final layer. We implemented an Autoencoder Neural Network that tries to output
    the same inputs with less reconstruction error. This neural network consists of
    one-dimensional convolution, LSTM, and dense layers, followed by a dropout layer
    to help prevent overfitting. Adam optimization is a stochastic gradient descent
    method based on the adaptive estimation of first-order and second-order moments.
    In our case, we used the Adam optimizer implemented in the Keras/TensorFlow library,
    with a learning rate of 0.001 and β 2 set to 0.5. GAN models are trained for 2000
    epochs with a batch size of 128, and the autoencoder models are trained for 50
    epochs with a batch size of 8. After each epoch, the model is stored on the hard
    drive to select the best model before overfitting occurs. The detailed network
    architecture of the autoencoder model can be found in Table 4, and the detailed
    network architecture of the GAN is presented in Table 5. Table 4. Network architecture
    of AE model. Table 5. Network architecture of GAN model. 4.6. Description of Evaluation
    Metrics After the learning process, the best model was selected and evaluated
    using balanced class validation data that contain 1000 normal and 1000 abnormal
    samples labeled by agronomy experts. Table 6 summarizes the evaluation metrics
    of the anomaly detection models related to soil moisture, air temperature, and
    air humidity. Table 6. Evaluation metrics of anomaly detection models. The metrics
    used for evaluating the anomaly detection models include precision, recall, F1
    score, and accuracy. They are calculated as follows: Accuracy= 𝑇 𝑝 + 𝑇 𝑛 𝑇 𝑝 +
    𝑓 𝑛 + 𝑓 𝑝 + 𝑇 𝑛 Precision= 𝑇 𝑝 𝑇 𝑝 + 𝑓 𝑝 Recall= 𝑇 𝑝 𝑇 𝑝 + 𝑓 𝑛 F1−score=2× 𝑃𝑟𝑒𝑐𝑖𝑠𝑖𝑜𝑛×𝑅𝑒𝑐𝑎𝑙𝑙
    𝑃𝑟𝑒𝑐𝑖𝑠𝑖𝑜𝑛+𝑅𝑒𝑐𝑎𝑙𝑙 True Positive (TP): represents the number of abnormal samples
    correctly classified as attacks (correct detection). False Positive (FP): represents
    the number of normal samples wrongly classified as attacks (incorrect detection).
    True Negative (TN): represents the number of normal samples wrongly classified
    (correct detection). False Negative (FN): represents the number of abnormal samples
    wrongly classified as attacks (incorrect detection). Accuracy: reports the proportion
    of properly categorized samples to all other samples in the testing set. Precision:
    reports the percentage of samples properly categorized for all TP and FP in the
    testing set. Recall: the ratio of TP samples to the total number of TP and FN
    samples is known as recall. The F1-score reports the harmonic mean between precision
    and recall. 4.7. Results and Evaluation We trained a GAN model on soil moisture
    data for 2000 epochs, with an early stop mechanism implemented to stop training
    if the discriminator and generator losses remained low for 20 epochs. The GAN
    model for soil moisture at 5 cm depth converged at 500 epochs, while the model
    for 20 cm depth converged at 2000 epochs. Autoencoders were also trained for 100
    epochs, with models saved to the hard drive after each epoch. The model before
    the overfitting occurred was selected, with the models at epoch 38 and epoch 20
    being chosen for soil moisture models at depths of 5 cm and 20 cm, respectively.
    According to Table 6, the accuracy of each model ranged from 57.10% to 97.60%,
    while the F1 score ranged from 43.40% to 97.60%. Among the models, AE obtained
    the maximum accuracy and F1 score of 97.60% and 97.60%, respectively, while GAN
    achieved accuracy and F1 scores of 87.50% and 88.88%, respectively. The autoencoder
    error thresholds were set according to the 95% percentile of training data. As
    shown in Figure 9, we chose four-month time-series data from a soil moisture dataset,
    covering the time period from October 2010 to January 2011. Figure 9. Results
    of anomaly detection models on the soil moisture parameter. The GAN anomaly detection
    model identifies many anomalies in the normal behavior of soil moisture sensors,
    which may lead to false alarms for the farmer. On the other hand, the autoencoder
    model only picks up anomalies in the curves’ peaks that result from irrigation
    or rainfall. We trained a GAN model for detecting anomalies in air temperature
    for 3000 epochs and added an early stopping feature that would stop the training
    if the loss for the generator and discriminator remained low for 20 consecutive
    epochs. The training of the GAN model for air temperature in New York was observed
    to converge at 2700 epochs, while the training of the model for Philadelphia converged
    at 1870 epochs. Additionally, we also trained autoencoders for 100 epochs, saving
    the models after every epoch. The model that was trained before overfitting occurred
    was selected, with the models at epochs 95 and 87 chosen for air temperature models
    in New York and Philadelphia, respectively. The error thresholds for the autoencoder
    models were set based on the 95th percentile of the training data. This resulted
    in high accuracy, recall, and F1 scores for the autoencoder models compared to
    the GAN models, with the precision being similar for both. As illustrated in Figure
    10, we selected four-month time-series data from an air temperature dataset, from
    October 2012 to January 2013. The GAN anomaly detection model detects abnormalities
    in the normal behaviour of the air temperature sensor, whereas the autoencoder
    model recognizes the typical pattern of the air temperature sensor and does not
    detect any anomalies. Figure 10. Results of anomaly detection models on the air
    temperature parameter. We trained a GAN model for anomaly detection in air humidity
    for 2000 epochs with an early stopping mechanism in place to stop training if
    the discriminator and generator losses remained low for 20 epochs. The GAN model
    for air-humidity in New York converged at 680 epochs, while the model for Philadelphia
    converged at 1412 epochs. Additionally, autoencoders were trained for 100 epochs,
    and the models were saved after each epoch. The model before overfitting occurred
    was chosen, with the models at epochs 93 and 100 selected for air humidity autoencoder
    models in New York and Philadelphia, respectively. This resulted in high accuracy,
    precision, recall, and F1 scores for the autoencoder models, which performed better
    than the GAN models. The data used in Figure 11 were a four-month time series
    of air humidity from October 2012 to January 2013. The GAN model identifies anomalies
    in the normal behavior of the sensor, while autoencoders recognize the normal
    patterns of the data and detect only a few anomalies. As per the model validation
    results, the autoencoder-based models demonstrated high accuracy and precision
    in detecting anomalies compared to the GAN models. To optimize the models without
    sacrificing accuracy, they were converted using TensorFlow Lite and deployed on
    IoT gateways. An API and a simple web UI were established to configure the anomaly
    error thresholds and alert end users of any sensor malfunctions, as presented
    in Figure 12. Figure 11. Results of anomaly detection models on the air humidity
    parameter. Figure 12. Configuring anomalies and error thresholds in the IoT gateway
    web application. 5. Irrigation Factors Forecasting Using Deep Learning As illustrated
    in Figure 13, the developed system incorporates various microservices, including
    anomaly detection, forecasting, and data analytics, to enhance farmers’ ability
    to make irrigation decisions. These microservices are exposed through the system.
    To provide the farmer with the necessary tools for monitoring and forecasting
    climate and soil measurements, we have implemented a time-series NoSQL database
    to efficiently handle the large volume of sensor data. This type of database is
    particularly well suited for managing time-dependent data and enabling efficient
    manipulation operations. Additionally, it supports auto-scaling capabilities,
    ensuring that the system can handle increased data loads if required. To provide
    accessibility to the system, we have deployed multiple web servers that host web
    applications. Figure 13. Illustration depicting the interaction between end users
    and cloud services within a system. This allows the farmer to access the system
    and its functionalities through a user-friendly interface. To an ensure optimal
    performance and distribution of user requests, load balancers are implemented
    to evenly distribute the incoming traffic across the deployed web servers. In
    the next experiment, we will test the accuracy of the soil and weather forecasting
    models using autoencoders. In the first stage, we will feed the autoencoders’
    anomaly detection models with data from the datasets and replace detected anomalies
    with the reconstructed inputs. The obtained data are structured into sequences
    in the next stage by applying the sliding window approach. This methodology improves
    those observed in previous studies [3,28] when integrated with an IoT platform,
    as a tool for simplifying the labeling of actual anomalies, and can assist in
    the creation of supervised datasets for future research in the field. Prediction
    models based on deep learning techniques can also correct anomalies. We use the
    previous 24 records as inputs and the next 24 as outputs. This technique allows
    us to apply supervised learning to soil and weather parameter forecasting tasks.
    5.1. Forecasting Model for Potential Irrigation Factors Based on the previous
    comparison of generative adversarial networks (GANs) and autoencoders (AEs) for
    finding anomalies, it was found that AEs are more accurate and have a lower rate
    of false alarms. As a result, AE models were chosen for the data collection process.
    This section aims to evaluate the performance of the forecasting models after
    applying data clearing and correction techniques, which are intended to enhance
    the data’s quality and reliability for accurate forecasts. Table 6 shows the architecture
    of the model. This architecture is a sequence-to-vector transformation, where
    the input sequence goes through a series of operations to pull out features and
    capture temporal relationships. This process involves using both convolutional
    and LSTM layers. The convolutional layers extract pertinent features from the
    input sequence, while the bidirectional LSTM architecture processes the input
    sequence in both forward and backward directions, enabling the model to capture
    past and future context simultaneously. Finally, the output of the LSTM layer
    is fed into a fully connected layer for additional processing and to generate
    the final output of the model. This architecture enables the model to effectively
    analyze and understand the input sequence, producing a condensed vector representation
    as the ultimate result. 5.2. Evaluation Metrics of Forecasting Models Based on
    Deep Learning Models When analyzing prediction models of future measurement performance,
    the following metrics are typically used: Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Square
    Error (MSE), and Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) are the three most commonly used
    loss metrics to evaluate the performance of DL models related to regression problems.
    They are given as follows: MSE MAE RMSE = ∑ 𝑁 𝑖=1 ( 𝑥 𝑖 − 𝑦 𝑖 ) 2 = ∑ 𝑁 𝑖=1 |
    𝑥 𝑖 − 𝑦 𝑖 | = ∑ 𝑁 𝑖=1 ( 𝑥 𝑖 − 𝑦 𝑖 ) 2 − − − − − − − − − − − − √ 5.3. Results and
    Discussion According to our empirical study, the Adam optimizer from Keras/TensorFlow
    with a learning rate of 0.001 was used for training the CNN/BiLSTM models for
    200 epochs using a batch size of 32. The model was saved after each epoch to pick
    the best model before overfitting occurred. Table 7 displays the in-depth structure
    of the CNN/BiLSTM models. The model inputs a sequence of 24 previous values to
    predict the next 24 subsequent sensor measures. As shown in Table 8, the evaluation
    results for the soil moisture forecasting model are presented for two different
    depth sensors (sm_5 and sm_20). For sm_5, when no anomalies were replaced, the
    model achieved an MSE of 1.2273, an RMSE of 1.1078, and an MAE of 0.999. However,
    a significant performance improvement was observed when 1025 anomalies were replaced,
    resulting in a notable decrease in MSE to 0.272243, RMSE to 0.52176, and MAE to
    0.4703. These findings demonstrate that replacing anomalies positively impacted
    the model’s ability to forecast soil moisture at sm_5 sensors, leading to more
    accurate predictions. In the case of sm_20, when no anomalies were replaced, the
    model yielded an MSE of 1.70128, an RMSE of 1.3043, and an MAE of 1.234. Table
    7. Network architecture of parameter forecasting model. Table 8. Evaluation of
    soil moisture forecasting model. Subsequently, when 716 anomalies were replaced,
    a slight performance improvement was observed, resulting in a reduced MSE of 0.8740,
    an RMSE of 0.9348, and an MAE of 0.861. The decrease in the MSE, RMSE, and MAE
    values indicates enhanced accuracy in the model’s predictions for sm_20 sensors,
    although the improvements were comparatively smaller than those observed for sm_5.
    These results underscore the significance of replacing anomalies in the dataset
    to improve the forecasting accuracy of the model. The improvements achieved for
    the sm_5 sensors demonstrate the substantial impact of addressing anomalies on
    the model’s performance. However, for the sm_20 sensors, the improvements were
    relatively modest, suggesting that anomalies had a lesser effect on the model’s
    predictions in this particular case. According to the results, the autoencoder
    model trained on clean data demonstrated the best forecasting performance, as
    shown in Figure 14. The actual and expected soil moisture were nearly identical,
    with minor discrepancies at the 5 cm and 20 cm depths. Table 9 presents the evaluation
    of an air temperature forecasting model for New York and Philadelphia, considering
    scenarios with and without anomaly replacement. The air temperature model in New
    York, not replacing anomalies, resulted in an MSE of 20.1318, an RMSE of 4.4868,
    and an MAE of 3.497. However, when 1140 anomalies were replaced, the model’s performance
    improved significantly, with the MSE decreasing to 17.7633, the RMSE decreasing
    to 4.2146, and the MAE decreasing to 3.436. This suggests that replacing anomalies
    enhanced the model’s accuracy in predicting air temperature in New York. Figure
    14. Results of soil moisture forecasting models over four months. Table 9. Evaluation
    of air temperature forecasting model. Similarly, for air temperature in Philadelphia,
    the model achieved an MSE of 16.2342, an RMSE of 4.0291, and an MAE of 3.3 when
    anomalies were not replaced. After replacing anomalies, the model’s performance
    improved further, resulting in an MSE of 4.635611, an RMSE of 2.1530, and an MAE
    of 1.648. This indicates that anomaly replacement positively influenced the model’s
    forecasting accuracy in Philadelphia. Overall, the results underscore the significance
    of anomaly replacement in improving the accuracy of the air temperature forecasting
    model, as depicted in Figure 15. The findings demonstrate that addressing anomalies
    led to more precise predictions for air temperature in both New York and Philadelphia.
    As indicated in Table 10, the evaluation results of an air humidity forecasting
    model for two locations are as follows. In New York and Philadelphia, the model’s
    performance was assessed under different scenarios where anomalies were either
    not corrected (corrected anomalies = 0) or replaced using a correction model.
    In the case of air humidity forecasting in New York, the results show that replacing
    anomalies had a minor positive effect on the model’s performance. Although the
    improvements in MSE, RMSE, and MAE values were relatively small, they indicate
    a slight increase in the accuracy of the model’s predictions after anomaly replacement.
    Figure 15. Results of air-temperature forecasting models over four months. Table
    10. Evaluation of air humidity forecasting model. Similarly, for air humidity
    forecasting in Philadelphia, replacing anomalies had a limited impact on the model’s
    performance. The reduction in MSE, RMSE, and MAE values was minimal, suggesting
    only a slight improvement in the accuracy of the model’s predictions. Overall,
    the results indicate that replacing anomalies had a limited influence on the performance
    of the air humidity forecasting model in both New York and Philadelphia, as shown
    in Figure 16. Anomalies may have a relatively small effect on the accuracy of
    the model’s predictions for air humidity in these locations. However, the long-term
    forecast error was significantly high due to various factors that can impact air
    humidity patterns, such as air temperature, air pressure, wind speed, and air
    pollution. After validating the models obtained, they were converted using TensorFlow
    Lite to improve efficiency without sacrificing accuracy and deployed on the cloud.
    An API and web dashboard were developed to display and predict weather and soil
    parameters, as shown in Figure 17. Figure 16. Results of air-humidity forecasting
    models over four months. Figure 17. Estimating irrigation measures using a web
    application accessible online. 6. Conclusions and Future Trends This article introduces
    version 1.0 of the INTEL-IRRIS low-cost and fog-IoT/AI system, developed by the
    University of Oran 1 for SFCs. We present an IoT-based smart farming system that
    integrates anomaly detection based on autoencoders, demonstrating superior performance
    compared to GANs with accuracy rates of 90% for soil moisture, 95% for air temperature,
    and 97% for air humidity. Additionally, anomalies can be adjusted using reconstructed
    inputs from autoencoder models. The results showcase minor estimation errors for
    soil moisture and air temperature hourly forecasting models, indicating the effectiveness
    of our approach. The proposed solution improves the effects observed in previous
    studies and can also assist in creating supervised datasets for future research
    in the field. This platform will need more research that takes into consideration
    several perspectives: To enhance the accuracy of the acquired data, we will increase
    the accuracy of low-cost sensors using autonomous and remotely managed techniques
    to improve the different sensors’ calibration [32]. As a consequence, our water–soil–plant–climate
    interaction models will prescribe more correct measures. To enhance the reliability,
    accessibility, and tracking of sensors and actuators, incorporating a blockchain
    security framework is recommended. This integration will establish a strong mechanism
    for data integrity, availability, and traceability in the system. The design and
    implementation of precision PA-based Low-Power Wide-Area Network (LPWAN) technologies
    like Lora and Sigfox. These approaches are designed to conserve energy, like the
    Long-Range Wide-Area Network (LoRaWAN), and enhance the irrigation efficiency
    of large-holder farmers. Offer the “out-of-the-box” function, meaning that the
    control component that recommends irrigation is integrated into the IoT gateway
    and, as a result, does not need an internet connection, as implemented by WAZIUP
    partner [27]. Traditional deep learning systems need centralized data gathering
    and processing, which is becoming more unfeasible due to efficiency issues and
    rising data privacy concerns. Due to these qualities, federated learning has been
    a hot topic in smart agriculture. We intend to conduct a comprehensive assessment
    of the FL approach and the centralized machine learning models. Author Contributions

  description: Reported technological tools for irrigation scheduling lack the integration
    of real-time crop measurements, weather forecasting, and the limitations and variabilities
    introduced by human operation. Moreover, most of these tools do not provide practical
    irrigation recommendations, limiting their adoption and benefits in enhancing
    agricultural efficiency and reducing environmental impact. To address these challenges,
    we propose an adaptive and predictive irrigation management decision support system
    by formulating a feedback plus feedforward algorithm that uses modeling, estimation,
    prediction, and control strategies. The major feature of this DSS is the consideration
    of human intervention in the control loop. The DSS integrates field data, including
    soil moisture, rain, temperature, and irrigation, in addition to weather forecasting.
    It gives irrigation managers precise and practical instructions on how much to
    irrigate based on preferences for irrigation events. The DSS adapts in real-time
    to provide irrigation volume recommendations that ensure optimal soil moisture
    levels are maintained. Our approach includes the incorporation of a simplified
    control-oriented model (COM) to characterize the soil moisture dynamics, a data
    processing stage that makes the measured data compatible with the COM, a parameter
    estimation stage that guarantees an optimal adjustment of the COM parameters,
    a control stage that uses the parametrized COM, measured information from the
    crop, and weather forecasts to obtain optimal irrigation volume recommendation.
    We evaluated our DSS using data from a commercial sweetcorn field in South Florida,
    where seepage irrigation is used. Our findings show that (i) the proposed model
    and estimation stage offer an accurate description of the soil moisture dynamics,
    reaching correlation coefficients and R-squared values greater than 0.92 and 0.84
    during all the evaluations, (ii) the algorithm can consistently regulate soil
    moisture, ensuring it remains at the desired levels reducing the risks associated
    with leaching and runoff, and iii) water savings can increase by 30%. Therefore,
    our DSS has the potential to become a standardized platform for providing optimal
    and practical irrigation recommendations to irrigation managers.

    Get rights and content Highlights • Novel DSS for irrigation control integrating
    human intervention into the loop. • The DSS has the potential of 30% water savings
    in seepage irrigated crops. • The algorithm uses real-time data and forecasts
    for precise irrigation scheduling. • The DSS uses a control-oriented model to
    estimate soil moisture with high confidence. • DSS maintains optimal soil moisture,

    and practical irrigation recommendations to irrigation managers. Previous article

    controlPrecision irrigation 1. Introduction Agriculture is the base of our socio-economical
    model, and its development plays an essential role in the welfare of nations (Gollin
    et al., 2002). However, agriculture has a high environmental impact and can be
    considered one of the most important contributors to global environmental degradation
    (Mueller et al., 2012). Furthermore, as the global population continues to grow,
    there is an urgent need to increase food production. This already complex challenge
    is further intensified by accelerated environmental changes, characterized by
    significant shifts in precipitation patterns and an increase in extreme weather
    events such as heavy rains, heatwaves, and droughts (Bisbis et al., 2018). Consequently,
    it is critical to develop strategies to enhance agricultural production while
    mitigating its environmental impact. In this context, improvements in irrigation
    scheduling play an important role, not only because agriculture is the consumer
    of almost 70% of freshwater resources (Jalilvand et al., 2019), but also because
    appropriate irrigation scheduling can help to increase the yield production and
    minimize the leaching of nutrients, pesticides, and heavy metal to freshwater
    sources (Khatri and Tyagi, 2015). Incorporating technological tools could be a
    viable solution to improve irrigation scheduling, where the aim is to make irrigation
    decisions based on the needs of the crops, establishing when the crops need water
    and how much water needs to be applied. Numerous studies have centered on developing
    tools that accurately detect plant water stress conditions to determine optimal
    irrigation. For instance, Torres et al. (2019) employed near-infrared spectroscopy
    to measure in-situ leaf relative water content. In parallel, other approaches
    assess plant water requirements using soil moisture sensors (SMS) positioned in
    the target zone. The use of SMS is the most adopted technology for irrigation
    scheduling in the USA (USDA, 2018, Taghvaeian et al., 2020), and in many scenarios,
    a common response to identified irrigation needs is implementing feedback threshold
    control by using SMS (Dukes et al., 2009, Zotarelli et al., 2010, Zhang et al.,
    2017, Li et al., 2018, Cayuela et al., 2022, Simionesei et al., 2020), or using
    fuzzy-based decision systems (Culman et al., 2019, Stone et al., 2020). Both strategies
    define levels based on measured stress conditions or soil moisture. However, the
    methodology for setting these threshold levels is not versatile enough to accommodate
    the diversity of crops, soils, and environmental conditions. Furthermore, these
    thresholds often remain static, not accounting for the evolving needs of crops
    influenced by environmental factors, intrinsic crop properties, and growth stages.
    Accurately determining the volume of water needed for irrigation entails a comprehensive
    understanding of plant water consumption concerning environmental variables, specific
    crop attributes, and growth stages (Lopez-Jimenez et al., 2022). Many decision
    support systems employ crop measurements coupled with AI to estimate and compensate
    for water losses from the evapotranspiration process (Katimbo et al., 2023). The
    works developed by Gu et al., 2017, Li et al., 2019 and Chen et al. (2019) aim
    to bolster decision-support systems for agricultural irrigation by incorporating
    analytical models such as the Root Zone Water Quality Model (RZWQM). This comprehensive
    model features modules covering soil water balance, nutrient dynamics, equilibrium
    soil chemistry, potential evapotranspiration, surface energy balance, heat transfer,
    pesticide processes, and plant growth, relying on the Decision Support System
    for Agrotechnology Transfer (DSSAT). RZWQM has been widely utilized to simulate
    the impacts of agricultural management strategies on crop yields and soil and
    water quality (Ma et al., 2012). Gu et al., 2017, Li et al., 2019 and Chen et
    al. (2019) use RZWQM for computing irrigation scheduling based on measurable crop
    conditions, predefined threshold values, and numerical solutions generated by
    the model. Nonetheless, employing RZWQM to compute irrigation scheduling in a
    feedback scheme presents significant challenges due to its inherent complexity
    and rigidity. The model’s detailed structure complicates the straightforward analyses
    and inclusion of user-specified requirements and the adaptation to overcome discrepancies
    between the crop and the model. Furthermore, RZWQM is restricted to a predefined
    set of cultivars, limiting its versatility to diverse agricultural settings. The
    complexity also imposes computational constraints, making real-time feedback control
    based on the current soil moisture state and crop stages challenging. These limitations
    underscore the necessity for more versatile, adaptive, and computationally efficient
    irrigation scheduling strategies. To this end, some studies have explored advanced
    control theory as a systematic approach to the irrigation problem (Saleem et al.,
    2013, Delgoda et al., 2016, Shang et al., 2020). As mentioned by Romero et al.
    (2012) and Ding et al. (2018), using advanced control strategies in agriculture
    has a high potential to increase efficiency. However, tangible applications are
    sparse. Much of the documented research revolves around simulations (Romero et
    al., 2012). While comprehensive on paper, some models oversimplify real-world
    scenarios by presupposing fully instrumented crops. Contrarily, in practical settings,
    agricultural systems often struggle with control limitations. In many irrigation
    systems, manual intervention dominates, where operators activate or deactivate
    pumps, manage ditches, and manipulate valves or gates to regulate irrigation.
    In summary, we evidence a lack of irrigation strategies that balance efficiency,
    practicality, and real crop management considerations. Many current methods rely
    heavily on static thresholds or intricate models, which often do not adapt dynamically
    to changing environmental conditions, diverse crop needs, irrigation management
    practices, and different growth stages. Moreover, while advanced control theory
    holds promise, there is an absence of advanced control strategies that account
    for real-world complexities and manual human intervention in the operation of
    irrigation systems, where the timely human response to crop needs, actuation precision,
    and operational reliability are important elements that influence the controlled
    system. Against this backdrop, the primary objective of this research is to use
    control theory to enhance the efficiency of irrigation systems, particularly in
    real agricultural scenarios that are often human-operated. We propose developing
    a novel control-based algorithm for a DSS for irrigation scheduling capable of
    computing practical irrigation instructions based on field measurements and weather
    forecasting, which is designed to be adaptable to the grower’s or irrigation manager’s
    operational limitations, preferences, and experience and must compensate for uncertainties
    introduced by human intervention. We have formulated our DSS around a simplified
    proposed control-oriented model (COM), which describes the soil moisture dynamics;
    a data processing stage, which makes the measured data compatible with the COM;
    a parameter estimation stage, which guarantees an optimal adjustment of the COM
    parameters based on measured information from the crop; and a control stage, which
    uses the parametrized COM, measured information from the crop, and information
    from weather forecasting to compute the appropriate irrigation instructions that
    maintain the soil moisture close to a desired level. We evaluated our algorithm
    using collected data from a seepage-irrigated commercial sweetcorn field in South
    Florida. Our evaluations covered each component of our system, from model validation
    to overall system performance. As a principal outcome, the proposed algorithm
    presents the potential to save 30% of water in this type of irrigation system.
    This water-saving is facilitated through effective and achievable computed irrigation
    scheduling that maintains soil moisture within a targeted range. Such control
    preserves optimal growing conditions and minimizes environmental risks by preventing
    runoff, percolation, and the leaching of hazardous agricultural chemicals into
    the surrounding ecosystem. The remainder of the paper is organized as follows.
    Section 2 starts with an overview of soil moisture and irrigation scheduling,
    establishes the problem of formulating a control-oriented DSS for irrigation scheduling,
    and offers a detailed description of the proposed DSS algorithm. Section 3 describes
    the process following to validate the proposed algorithm. In Section 4, the results
    of the validation are presented and discussed. Finally, in Section 5, some conclusions
    are drawn. 2. Methods 2.1. Process description and problem formulation The relationship
    between irrigation, soil, plants, and the environment constitutes a complex system
    that requires practical concepts and analogies to formulate optimal irrigation
    strategies. As delineated in Eisenhauer et al. (2021), soil can be conceptualized
    as a reservoir, with different levels representing the amount of water available
    for plant uptake. We adopt this conceptual framework to simplify a complex problem
    that involves agriculture, control theory, and human interaction and to formulate
    the control problem on a DSS for irrigation management. Within this context, we
    identify key input and output variables, delineate desired conditions or set points,
    and specify agricultural constraints and human limitations. Download : Download

    of soil moisture states significant for plant-water relations and irrigation control
    based on Eisenhauer et al. (2021). The Permanent Wilting Point (PWP) delineates
    the lower threshold of soil water content at which plants cannot recover from
    water stress, marking the limiting boundary for plant survivability. The Maximum
    Allowable Depletion Point (MADP) is a critical reference, as soil moisture levels
    below this point result in sub-optimal physiological responses in plants. The
    soil moisture range between MADP and Field Capacity (FC) is optimal for plant
    growth, balancing water availability and stress prevention. Surpassing FC leads
    to inefficient water use, soil structural degradation, anaerobic root conditions,
    nutrient leaching, and the potential for surface water pollution. Beyond the Saturation
    Point (SP), the soil reaches its hydraulic limit, becoming incapable of retaining
    additional moisture. Fig. 1 illustrates this analogy: the base level, or the Permanent
    Wilting Point (PWP), indicates that below this threshold level, plants cannot
    extract water from the soil, leading to irreversible wilting. The next critical
    point is the Maximum Allowable Depletion Point (MADP); if the soil moisture drops
    below this level, the plants undergo water stress, potentially reducing yield.
    Consequently, MADP often serves as a guideline for irrigation decisions as the
    lower limit. However, its precise value, i.e., the percentage of MADP as the lower
    limit, can vary based on the crop, its growth stage, and prevailing climatic conditions.
    For instance, Bayabil et al. (2023) demonstrated that using only 75% of the expected
    MADP saved 25% of water consumption, with no reduction in sweet corn yield. Similarly,
    strategic deficit irrigation during certain growth stages of wine grapes enhances
    fruit quality for winemaking (Kang et al., 2023). From a control systems perspective,
    the Maximum Allowable Depletion Point (MADP) is a critical set-point or lower-bound
    constraint that must be maintained. Failure to uphold soil moisture levels at
    or above this threshold can lead to suboptimal plant physiological responses and
    yield reduction. The Field Capacity (FC) is defined as the soil water content
    threshold beyond which the gravitational drainage is negligible and is considered
    the upper limit. Below FC, the capillary actions keep the water stored in the
    soil pores. Irrigating until reaching FC and avoiding exceeding field capacity
    prevents the leaching of nutrients and pesticides applied to the crops. The saturation
    point (SP) is attained when the soil can no longer retain water, leading to runoff
    on the surface, which poses significant environmental concerns. Soil texture significantly
    influences key hydraulic characteristics such as the PWP, FC, and SP. Saxton and
    Rawls (2006) provide detailed hydraulic characteristics across various soil textures,
    as illustrated in Fig. 2. From this figure, it becomes evident that managing irrigation
    in sandy soil is notably challenging. A simple 5% fluctuation in water content
    in such soil can either lead to plant wilting or result in water wastage. In contrast,
    silt soils offer better flexibility: water content can vary by as much as 24%
    without triggering any adverse agricultural or ecological consequences. Therefore,
    the soil’s proportion of sand, silt, and clay plays an important role in the control
    problem definition and for specific irrigation decisions. Conceptually, for control
    purposes, soil can be viewed as a storage unit, where the area depends on the
    soil texture, the control input is irrigation, and the control objective is maintaining
    the volumetric water content to a desired level. However, additional considerations
    must also be included in the case of a DSS for irrigation control. Download :

    Maximum Allowable Depletion Point (MADP) of 50% of the available water for each
    soil class. Points over each bar denote the specific values. This figure is based
    on the hydraulic characteristics reported by Saxton and Rawls (2006). 2.1.1. Control
    challenges on a decision support system for irrigation scheduling A DSS for irrigation
    scheduling is particularly useful in farm systems with no automatic control elements,
    where the grower or irrigation manager carries out irrigation actions. In our
    proposed DSS, the control problem is to use available information from crops and
    weather forecasting to compute irrigation instructions that help the user minimize
    the error between desired and measured soil moisture. Below, we discuss some considerations
    that must be addressed. Timely Human Response: The grower or irrigation manager
    cannot execute irrigation instructions quickly and suddenly. For that, even if
    sensors and computational capabilities can offer periodic information with sampling
    periods of minutes or seconds, this information will be unhelpful and might overwhelm
    or confuse the operator. Moreover, if an irrigation instruction suddenly appears
    when the operator is unavailable to make an irrigation action, it might not generate
    the expected result. Actuation Precision: Many conventional irrigation systems
    rely on actuators that operate more as binary switches than precision instruments.
    In agriculture, it is common to find devices such as on–off pumps, gates, weirs,
    and valves, which are unsuited for precise operation. Hence, recommendations should
    be straightforward and actionable, such as suggesting irrigation during a time
    rather than maintaining a specific flow rate. Human Reliability: Even with precise
    recommendations from the DSS, human behavior introduces variability. External
    influences can alter the final action taken, introducing a layer of uncertainty.
    Considered Measurable Variables: In most agricultural practices, rain ( ), irrigation
    ( ), and temperature ( ) are the main measurable variables affecting root zone
    soil moisture ( ). While capillary effects from the deep soil also influence root
    zone soil moisture, quantifying these effects necessitates more elaborated measurement
    techniques compared to the direct measurement of the aforementioned variables.
    Integration of Weather Forecasts: Meteorological advancements have made weather
    predictions increasingly accurate. Governments worldwide are making concerted
    efforts to provide weather forecasts as part of impact-based decision-support
    services. These forecasts, especially regarding expected rainfall and temperature,
    are crucial for making informed irrigation decisions, ensuring optimal water use,
    and supporting crop health. 2.2. Proposed approach We address the control challenges
    by proposing a DSS presented in Fig. 3, which integrates measured information
    from the crop and weather forecasting to compute irrigation instructions. The
    DSS integrates control theory and accommodates timely human response by working
    periodically and allowing the grower to determine the irrigation period1 for these
    executions. Furthermore, the DSS provides practical and realizable irrigation
    instructions, given in units of volume per irrigation period or irrigation time
    per irrigation period. For instance, if the grower selects a two-day irrigation
    period, the DSS will calculate the necessary volume of water or irrigation time
    that must be applied for each two-day interval. Download : Download high-res image

    proposed Decision Support System (DSS) for irrigation scheduling. The description
    illustrates the measured variables, where represents the instant time when the
    data is obtained, indicates the temperature, rain, soil moisture, and irrigation.
    The DSS is formulated with four main components: (i) the control-oriented model
    (COM), used as a base of the control algorithm; (ii) the data processing stage
    for aligning multi-temporal sensor data with algorithmic components; (iii) a parameter
    estimation stage for updating model parameters ( ); and (iv) a control algorithm
    that utilizes the COM, estimated parameters, processed measurements, and weather
    forecasts to calculate irrigation instructions ( ). The DSS uses measured variables
    from the crop, where rain and temperature can be obtained from a weather station,
    and volumetric water content can be obtained from soil moisture sensors. To address
    the system’s robustness against human variability in irrigation execution, our
    DSS additionally considers measuring this execution, i.e., obtaining measurements
    of irrigation time per irrigation period or volume of water per irrigation period.
    This measurement can be obtained from flowmeters or sensors for flow detection.
    The proposed approach (Fig. 3) is supported by (i) a COM of the SM, (ii) a data
    processing stage, (iii) a parameter estimation stage, and (iv) a control algorithm.
    In this approach, the COM serves as a parametrizable model that characterizes
    soil moisture as a function of processed measured variables and parameters to
    be estimated. At each irrigation period, the estimation stage calculates and updates
    the parameters. Then, the control stage uses the COM, the estimated parameters,
    soil moisture measurements, and weather forecasting data to determine the appropriate
    irrigation action that maintains the soil moisture at the desired value. A detailed
    breakdown of each component of the DSS is provided below. 2.2.1. Proposed control-oriented
    model for soil moisture The most important element of the proposed strategy is
    the COM. In agriculture, traditional models often focus on capturing the complexity
    of various biophysical processes. Although accurate, these models are often computationally
    expensive and not straightforwardly applicable for control design. We have derived
    the COM from a simplified water balance, as Fig. 4 describes. This model considers
    the soil a storage unit, where a linear combination of adaptable parameters and
    measured variables performs a water balance with inputs, including rain, irrigation,
    and upward capillarity. On the other hand, outputs include evapotranspiration,
    deep percolation, and runoff. The choice of a simplified model inevitably raises
    concerns about the sacrifice of modeling accuracy. However, in our DSS algorithm,
    this drawback is mitigated by continual parameter estimation based on real-time
    data and by incorporating feedback in the control equation. Our COM is formulated
    based on three assumptions: Download : Download high-res image (550KB) Download
    : Download full-size image Fig. 4. Water balance used to describe the soil moisture
    dynamics, where , and are outputs associated with evapotranspiration, and deep
    percolation; , , and are inputs associated to rain, irrigation, and capillary
    rise. Assumption 1 Model Sampling Period The COM is formulated with a fixed time
    step, denoted by , corresponding to the irrigation period. This fixed period allows
    for the discretization of soil moisture dynamics, indexed by the variable . Our
    DSS algorithm is based on the COM, which is discrete and will describe the soil
    moisture dynamics according to the irrigation period ( ). The grower or irrigation
    manager can configure to suit their operational preferences. Consequently, the
    COM and, by extension, the DSS algorithm are adaptable to those preferences. For
    instance, if a two-day irrigation period is selected, the COM will effectively
    model soil moisture dynamics under this discrete time interval. It is highlighted
    that, in practice, sensors often provide data at multiple sampling frequencies.
    We have designed specific data management techniques to reconcile this multiplicity
    of data with the user-defined irrigation period . These techniques are detailed
    in Section 2.2.2. Assumption 2 Soil Moisture Average During an appropriate irrigation
    period, it is reasonable to presume that the available water for the plants within
    the root zone is closely around an average soil moisture value, denoted as . This
    assumption enables us to formulate the control objective as maintaining this average
    soil moisture close to a desired level . This assumption simplifies both the model
    and the DSS algorithm. However, we clarify that choosing a lengthy irrigation
    period might be comfortable for the irrigation manager but can be risky for the
    plant’s health. Conversely, opting for shorter irrigation periods can mitigate
    potential water deficit issues during this period, but at the expense of demand
    for more managerial time. The optimal irrigation period depends on the crop type,
    environmental conditions, and highly on soil type. For instance, sandy soils,
    characterized by low water retention capacities, necessitate shorter irrigation
    periods than silt soils, which can retain almost six times more water (see Fig.
    2). It is pertinent to note that the temporal resolution of the COM is directly
    correlated with the chosen irrigation period . A shorter irrigation period effectively
    enhances the temporal resolution, allowing the model to capture more rapid fluctuations
    in soil moisture and other variables. However, this comes at the expense of increased
    computational and managerial demands. The adaptability in selecting allows for
    a trade-off between temporal resolution and operational convenience. Assumption
    3 Linear Relation Soil moisture operates as a causal system. The future average
    soil moisture is influenced by its prior water content and the inputs and outputs
    during this irrigation period. We are considering average soil moisture variation
    between successive irrigation periods, which is represented as , as a linear relation
    of the water balance during such irrigation period. We are formulating that in
    the upcoming irrigation period, the soil moisture average will depend on the actual
    soil moisture average and a linear combination between parameters (rates of change)
    and accumulated amounts of water inputs and outputs during the current irrigation
    period. In this form, we denote water input as the accumulated amount of rain
    during the irrigation period and the parameter as the rate of change between and
    . Note that the rain units are commonly expressed in units of the water depth
    accumulated in the area under study. Since is a summation of measurements, it
    retains the same depth units, resulting in being dimensioned as soil moisture
    per unit of depth. Similarly, we denote the input as the accumulated amount of
    irrigation during the irrigation period and the parameter as the rate of change
    between and . Irrigation can be measured in units of depth, volume, or, in our
    case, for simplifying sensor instrumentation and data acquisition, irrigation
    time. reflects the total time that the crop is irrigated during the irrigation
    period, resulting in being dimensioned as soil moisture per unit of time. To streamline
    the electronic instrumentation, we are not considering measured variables corresponding
    to the capillary rise input, as this capillary rise comes from the water table.
    Instead, the input associated with capillary rise will be treated as an unknown
    parameter, denoted by . As discussed in the process description (Section 2.1),
    the infiltration and runoff are directly related to the soil moisture. For that,
    we are associating this output to the combination between the soil moisture average
    and the parameter , which is adimensional and represents the rate of change between
    and . The most adopted method to evaluate evapotranspiration is the FAO-56. This
    method requires the measurement of multiple environmental variables beyond the
    scope of our DSS, such as net radiation, soil heat flux, wind speed, saturation
    vapor pressure, and actual vapor pressure. Inspired by simpler models such as
    the Hargreaves Method (Gao et al., 2017), we overcome this issue by relating evapotranspiration
    directly to the temperature average ( ) via the estimated parameter , which has
    soil moisture per temperature units and describes the rate of change between and
    . Therefore, according to the assumptions and the proposed linear combinations
    that describe the system inputs and outputs, our parametrizable COM is formulated
    as (1) where , , , , and are positive parameters to be estimated, and the variables
    , , , and are obtained in the data processing stage from measured raw data. 2.2.2.
    Data processing stage The primary objective of this stage is to utilize measured
    data to compute the average soil moisture, total rainfall, total irrigation, and
    average temperature over the duration of the irrigation period. In that form,
    knowing a fixed irrigation period spanning from the time instant to and considering
    the sampling period of the respective sensor as , the number of samples within
    an irrigation period can be defined as: (2) With this, the average soil moisture
    is determined by: (3) Similarly, the average temperature is given by: (4) The
    accumulated rainfall over the period is computed as follows: (5) The accumulated
    irrigation is: (6) In Fig. 3, the data processing stage also processes rain and
    temperature forecast data. This data process uses the same methods followed in
    Eqs. (5), (4), considering the sampling time used for the forecasting provider.
    The expected accumulated rainfall for the next irrigation period is noted as ,
    and the expected temperature average is noted as . 2.2.3. Parameter estimation
    stage We aim to estimate the parameters inherent to the COM, namely , , , , .
    Our strategy hinges on maintaining a record of processed data, from which we derive
    an optimization-based approach for parameter estimation. This method is a variation
    of the Moving Horizon Estimation (MHE) technique (Rao et al., 2001). Our variation
    comprises an expanding estimation window, and this is slightly different from
    the conventional MHE, where a fixed-size window is used. Moreover, we propose
    to ensure the estimated parameters’ optimality by formulating a two-step estimator.
    The decision to use an expanding window arises from the unique characteristics
    of seasonal crops and the observed irrigation practices by growers. Notably, some
    crops can be ready for harvest just 30 days post-planting. Additionally, the irrigation
    schedules set by growers can fluctuate significantly, ranging anywhere from one
    to more than five days. Given these dynamics, valuing and utilizing every data
    collected from the crop throughout its growth cycle is imperative. Moreover, with
    a fixed-size estimation window, we risk encountering data windows without rain
    events or irrigation events, which can impact the estimation of parameters related
    to rain and irrigation. We use an expanding estimation window to mitigate this,
    ensuring the algorithm always has access to a sufficient data set. For permanent
    crops, the analysis might benefit from a moving window with a fixed size long
    enough to guarantee optimal parameter estimation. For data aggregation within
    this expanding window, we consider vectors of processed data from the instant
    to the instant . Hence, the processed data for soil moisture, rainfall, irrigation,
    and temperature within each estimation window is defined as: with . In that form,
    according to the corresponding estimation window, the parameters , , , , and are
    estimated at each irrigation period, given adaptive characteristics to the COM.
    We employ a two-step estimation strategy to guarantee the optimality of our estimated
    parameters: the first step estimates parameters in association with measured variables.
    In contrast, the subsequent step estimates the parameter linked to the water table.
    Prior estimation step At this step, we assume a water table’s slow dynamic variation
    in seepage irrigation and general water table elevation. For that, has a low incidence
    in the variation of the soil moisture. Consequently, we exclude in the first estimation
    step. This step estimates the parameters that minimize the quadratic error between
    the soil moisture variation and the linear combination between the measured variables
    and the parameters associated with the measured variables. In this estimation
    step, we are including a constraint to ensure that all the parameters must be
    positive to conserve the proposed physical relation of the mass balance. The proposed
    optimization problem is formulated as follows: Download : Download high-res image
    (40KB) Download : Download full-size image where is the vector of parameters that
    are associated with measured variables , and is the quadratic error described
    as (8) with , and . For the optimization problem (Eq. (7)), the linear constraints
    imply that an optimal solution is achievable if is convex. The convexity of this
    cost function can be established if its Hessian matrix respect to is positive
    definite (Bhatia, 2015), which in turn depends on the linear independence of the
    columns in . Variability in soil moisture and temperature can generally be assumed,
    ensuring the linear independence of corresponding columns in . However, given
    that rainfall and irrigation can exhibit extended periods of invariability, the
    algorithm is designed to commence only when observed variability in and is confirmed.
    Subsequent estimation step After estimating the parameters associated with the
    measured variables, is estimated. As we consider this parameter directly related
    to the soil moisture, we propose to find the parameter that minimizes the quadratic
    error between the measured soil moisture and the estimated soil moisture with
    initial conditions given by . Where the estimated soil moisture is obtained from
    the water balance in Eq. (1), and the numerical solution of the model (Eq. (1)),
    which is described as (9) In that form, we propose a subsequent optimization problem
    described as Download : Download high-res image (40KB) Download : Download full-size
    image where is the quadratic cost function given by (11) with . In this optimization
    problem, the constraints are also linear. In Appendix, it is shown that by appropriate
    substitutions, appear as a linear combination into the numerical solution given
    by , confirming the convexity of the cost function and that optimal solutions
    of also can be guarantee. 2.2.4. Control stage In the control stage, the COM,
    the estimated parameters, the processed measured variables, and the forecasted
    variables are integrated to calculate the amount of water that must be applied
    during the irrigation period. This stage is an adaptive, predictive, and feedback-plus
    feedforward control strategy. The main objective is to use measured and forecast
    information to estimate the appropriate irrigation ( ) that maintains the soil
    moisture close to a desired value. We explain the control strategy in four steps,
    where first, the control-oriented model (Eq. (1)), the estimated parameters obtained
    in Eqs. (7), and (10), and the processed measured data (Eqs. (3), (4), (5), and
    (6)) are used to predict (or forecast) the soil moisture one step ahead ( ) as
    follows: (12) Second, we use the control-oriented model (Eq. (1)), the predicted
    soil moisture , forecast rain and temperature data ( , and , and we assume that
    in the next irrigation period, the estimated parameter variation can be neglected
    or in other words that . With this information, we predict the soil moisture two
    steps ahead ( ) as follows: (13) Third, we establish the objective to deduce the
    irrigation amount to be applied, such as two steps ahead, the predicted soil moisture
    will be equal to the desired soil moisture. Therefore, by replacing in Eq. (13)
    and obtaining , we deduce the irrigation amount equation as follows: (14) Fourth,
    to analyze and understand the elements of the irrigation amount equation, we define
    the expected error between the desired soil moisture and the expected soil moisture
    as . Therefore, Eq. (14) can be rewritten as follows: (15) where the elements
    of the irrigation control equation can be described as components of the water
    balance that equilibrates the soil moisture around the desired value as follows:
    is the amount of irrigation that must be applied to compensate for the difference
    between the desired moisture and the expected average of the soil moisture; is
    the amount of irrigation that must be applied to compensate the water that, during
    the irrigation period, was lost due infiltration; is the volume of irrigation
    water that can be hold based on the expected rain during the irrigation period;
    is the amount of irrigation that must be applied to compensate the water that
    is expected to be lost due evapotranspiration; is the amount of water the crop
    will receive from capillary rise. Note that this control action is a case of adaptive
    control, knows a self-tuning regulator, where the stability of the controlled
    system is conditioned to the accuracy of the estimated parameters and the grade
    of uncertainty between the controlled system and the estimated system (Åström
    and Wittenmark, 2008). 3. Experimental verification The algorithm was validated
    using on-field measurements from a commercial sweetcorn field in South Florida.
    This data was initially collected as part of an integrated research and extension
    project focused on improving farmers’ adoption of soil moisture sensors for irrigation
    scheduling in vegetable farms. We evaluated our DSS algorithm using readings from
    soil moisture probes, a weather station, and a pressure transducer deployed in
    the commercial field. In this section, we describe the data collection process
    and the algorithm evaluation towards establishing the potential benefits of the
    algorithm in comparison with the information obtained from the grower irrigation
    practices. As shown in Fig. 5, we installed sensors to measure soil moisture,
    precipitation, environmental temperature, and irrigation management from December
    21, 2022, to January 11, 2023. Due to confidentiality agreements, the precise
    location of the commercial field remains undisclosed in this study. The soil in
    this field is classified as waveland and lawnwood fine sands. Following the hydraulic
    properties reported by Saxton and Rawls (2006) (Fig. 2), this soil is characterized
    by a permanent wilting point of 5%, a field capacity of 10%, and a saturation
    point of 46%. The field water movement and location of the sensors are described
    in Fig. 5, where the field is surrounded by a channel supplied by a pump drawing
    from a natural water source. Water is distributed from this surrounding channel
    to the crops via pipes. This water is then dispersed into ditches across the field.
    These ditches feature interconnected silts that facilitate water transport to
    the plant beds. Irrigation is accomplished by increasing the water level in the
    channel. It is important to note that this system operates under the assumption
    of homogeneous water distribution, with the water supply pump serving as the unique
    control element. Download : Download high-res image (568KB) Download : Download

    deployment of a weather station, a soil moisture sensor, and a pressure transducer.
    The blue lines delineate the water distribution inflow utilized for irrigating
    the agricultural field under study. Under the homogeneous water distribution consideration,
    moisture measurements were taken in the root zone at a depth of 0.3 m, using a
    Sentek Drill & Drop 60 cm soil moisture probe, which is capable of measuring soil
    moisture, temperature, and salinity at uniformly spaced depths every 0.1 m, providing
    a profile up to 0.6 m depth (Sentek, 2018). The sampling time was 1800 s. Rain
    and temperature data were obtained using a Davis Vantage Pro2 GroWeather 6820c
    weather station (Davis, 2023). The sampling time was 900 s. Irrigation measurements
    were taken by installing a KPSI 700 pressure sensor at the bottom of the channel.
    This sensor has a range of 0.7–210 m, an accuracy of 1% with analog output from
    0 to 10 V. The objective was to identify sudden increases related to pump activation
    to establish the irrigation time during the irrigation period. The pressure sensor
    was connected to a CR1000X datalogger of Cambell Scientific (Campbell, 2023) with
    a sampling time of 300 s, and the irrigation management was established by analyzing
    this information. The proposed DSS algorithm was tested using Matlab software
    version R2022a (Matlab, 2022). The irrigation period was selected by analyzing
    the irrigation management given by the grower. We observed that the management
    given by the grower was in function of soil and crop appearance, irrigating when
    required, and turning the pump on and off with an elapsed time between 1 and 6
    days. Given this information, our algorithm testing incorporated an irrigation
    period of two days ( ). We consider that with this period, we can provide reasonable
    timing actions from the grower. We added normally distributed random noise to
    the measured data to simulate the inherent stochasticity in weather forecasts.
    Specifically, the magnitude of this noise was set at 10% of the standard deviation
    of the actual measured data. In the context of rainfall predictions, any resultant
    negative values post-noise addition were truncated to zero. The maximum allowable
    depletion for sweet corn was considered 50% (Bayabil et al., 2023). We determined
    the desired soil moisture between 7.5% and 10%. We selected a desired soil moisture
    of 9% to stay far from the maximum allowable depletion point and accommodate uncertainties
    in soil characteristics. Before initializing the algorithm, we converted missing
    data entries to zeros. Soil moisture and irrigation data underwent homogenization
    through interpolation to match the 900 s rain and temperature data sampling interval.
    In the prior estimation step, the optimization problem was formulated as a quadratic
    programming problem and iteratively solved using the “quadprog” tool in Matlab.
    In the subsequent estimation stage, the optimization problem was iteratively addressed
    using a sequential quadratic programming method with the “fmincon” tool in Matlab.
    Then, in the test, the data is processed at each irrigation period to obtain the
    corresponding averages of the temperature and soil moisture and the corresponding
    amounts of accumulated rain and accumulated irrigation applied by the grower.
    Moreover, the model’s parameters are estimated at each irrigation period, and
    the recommended irrigation is computed. We evaluated the overall DSS algorithm
    by applying the computed control action to the parametrized COM. We are addressing
    the uncertainties related to assuming negligible estimated parameter changes between
    consecutive irrigation periods by adding stochastic variability, which was obtained
    by analyzing the variation of the estimated parameters and adding a randomized
    normal distributed disturbance with a standard deviation equal to the observed
    standard deviation of . In that form, the stochastic soil moisture prediction
    is given by (16) where , , , , and are the corresponding disturbances. In consequence,
    the evaluated control action is also disturbed by including the stochastic soil
    moisture prediction as (17) Below, we present the outcomes of our analysis. 4.
    Results and discussion Fig. 6 shows the results of the data processing stage.
    Note how the temperature ( ) shows a periodic component related to day and night
    patterns, also presented in the soil moisture ( ). However, this periodic component
    is removed in both the processed temperature ( ) and soil moisture ( ). In the
    case of accumulated rain ( ), the processed data is presented as the cumulative
    sum for each irrigation period. The grower irrigation decision represents the
    accumulated hours the grower irrigated during each irrigation period. The data
    processing stage is pivotal in aligning the measured data with the model and significantly
    mitigating uncertainties from the measured parameters of soil moisture, temperature,
    rain, and irrigation. As described, this stage computes the average soil moisture,
    total rainfall, total irrigation, and average temperature over the duration of
    each irrigation period. This computation aids in filtering out uncertainties and
    undesired data anomalies provided by sensors and forecasting methods. By averaging
    soil moisture over an irrigation period, the impact of incorrect measurements
    and transient spikes not contemplated in the model and random fluctuations are
    reduced, leading to more representative information on the available water for
    the plants. For example, in Fig. 6, an anomalous temperature measurement close
    to −20 °C is observed on Jan-08-23. This incorrect measurement was filtered out
    in the processed temperature data, thus attenuating its influence. Furthermore,
    considering accumulated rain and irrigation data in the data processing stage
    notably enhances the DSS robustness by minimizing the influence of uncertainty
    in both the measurement and prediction processes. It is essential to emphasize
    that uncertainties in measured rainfall and irrigation data, sampled every 900
    s, have a diminished impact on the estimation and control stages as the duration
    of the irrigation period increases. This reduction in the influence of data uncertainty
    is pivotal for the robustness, accuracy, and reliability of the entire DSS algorithm.

    The lowest recorded correlation and values are 0.92 and 0.84, respectively. In
    addition, the -value starts at and decreases as the estimation window expands,
    reaching a minimum of . The consistently high correlation and values across all
    estimation windows suggest that the estimation algorithm performs well in describing
    the dynamics of the soil moisture average. The lowest value of 0.84 indicates
    that, in the worst-case scenario, the COM can explain an 84% of the variability
    in the soil moisture average. On the other hand, the lowest correlation value
    of 0.92 indicates that we are reaching a strong linear relationship between the
    proposed COM and the observed soil moisture averages. The low and decreasing -value
    describes a high level of confidence in the accuracy of the estimations, which
    increases as the estimation window increases. Download : Download high-res image

    The figure also visualizes prediction error behavior for each prediction instance.
    The results indicate that the average estimation error across all estimation windows
    is around zero, with maximum standard deviations of . The prediction error is
    similarly centered around zero, exhibiting maximum and minimum errors of . As
    the estimation window increases, the prediction error decreases. However, an increase
    in the prediction error is evidenced on Feb-05. This problem is also observed
    in the estimation analyses, with a decrease in the and correlation. On this particular
    estimation, the commercial sweetcorn field experienced an intense rainfall of
    26.67 mm within 24 h. This led to a substantial change in soil moisture levels,
    which the algorithm failed to estimate accurately, resulting in a peak error of
    3.29%. This behavior shows that close to the desired operation region (between
    the MADP and FC), the soil–water relation can be described as a linear model,
    where our COM can accurately describe the dynamics. However, the COM accuracy
    reduces in extreme events that move the SM content away from the desired operation
    region. Our proposed approach overcomes the uncertainties associated with using
    a simplified modeling approach by considering a recursive parameters estimation
    strategy that lets the model adapt to changing crop and environmental conditions.
    The modeling and estimation approach is capable of accurately describing the soil
    moisture dynamics close to the operation region, overcoming associated uncertainties,
    and can be used as a baseline for making irrigation decisions. To delve deeper
    into the validation and performance of our modeling and estimation approach, a
    comprehensive analysis of the distribution of the estimated parameters is subsequently
    provided. Fig. 9 shows the distribution of the parameters and the incidence of
    the estimated parameters in the COM. It can be observed that the parameters associated
    with moisture ( ), irrigation ( ), rain ( ), and temperature ( ) exhibits a low
    dispersion in contrast with the parameter associated to the capillary rise ( ).
    A sensitivity analysis of the estimated parameters can be performed by multiplying
    the obtained parameters by the maximum reported value per respective variable,
    obtaining how much the soil moisture can increase or decrease according to the
    parameter dispersion and the maximum values reported for each variable. The results
    show that during an irrigation period, the soil moisture could (i) decrease a
    1.5% concerning maximum soil moisture of 13.6%; (ii) increase around 3.6% with
    48 h of continuous irrigation; (iii) increase around a 3.7% in relation with 26
    (mm) of rain on a period of 48 h; (iv) decrease around 0.3% with a maximum temperature
    average of 23.3 (°C); and (v) increase around 0.06% in relation with the capillary
    rise. Note that the parameter that shows the high dispersion in the estimation
    process is . However, gives the most significant influence. Moreover, it is observed
    that soil water losses from leaching and runoff could be five times higher than
    the amount lost due to high temperature, which is related to the evapotranspiration
    process. Download : Download high-res image (202KB) Download : Download full-size
    image Fig. 9. Distribution of the parameters and incidence of their distribution
    in the model. Fig. 10 shows that the variations of the estimated parameters are
    distributed close to zero. This dispersion accounts for the expected variation
    that the parameters could present between irrigation periods. For example, in
    the case of rain, from Fig. 9, we have that the parameter associated ( ) is close
    to 0.11. From the standard deviation of , we can expect that this parameter could
    be different around in the next irrigation period. This uncertainty is reflected
    in the prediction of the soil moisture Eq. (16) and in the control action, which
    is taken based on that prediction. For that, the standard deviations of the variation
    of the parameters shown in Fig. 10 are used to add uncertainty and perform a realistic
    simulation in the presence of such uncertainty. The results of the controlled
    system are shown in Fig. 11, where we compare the system’s measured data with
    the expected data if the proposed algorithm is used to manage irrigation. Download

    data is filtered in the process stage. This is important because a similar result
    can be expected by using data from the corresponding weather forecasting services,
    highlighting the importance of the data processing stage in enhancing the algorithm’s
    robustness. On the other hand, it is observed that due to the processing stage,
    rain presents more sensitivity to the added random data. That is because, in the
    case of rain, the limitation to zero of the applied noise affects his distribution.

    (red) and expected rain; (iii) measured soil moisture (red) and controlled soil

    irrigation actions (red) and recommended irrigation actions by our DSS. In Fig.
    11, we are also presenting the comparison between the measured soil moisture and
    the expected soil moisture if the grower uses the computed recommended irrigation
    . In the comparison, we included the desired soil moisture ( ), and we can observe
    how the controlled moisture tries to be around this value. It is important to
    mention that the computation of starts on January 02, when the first prediction
    data is available (see Fig. 7); before that, and are the same. The most notable
    difference between the irrigation scheduling given by the grower and the irrigation
    scheduling computed by the algorithm is that the algorithm does not generate saturated
    irrigation actions of 48 h. The algorithm aims to uphold an average irrigation
    duration of 10 h every two days. This duration fluctuates proportionally with
    forecasted temperature changes (as seen on January 18) and inversely in response
    to anticipated rain events (as evidenced on January 24). On the other hand, the
    decisions taken by the grower show that he is reacting to extreme events. For
    example, on January 18, the irrigation was turned off when the average soil moisture
    reached a maximum of 13.85% (percolation). Also, it is observed that the irrigation
    is turned on on February 01, when the soil moisture is close to reaching the allowable
    depletion point of 7.5%. In contrast, the controlled moisture is close to 9, avoiding
    the environmental impact of percolation and also avoiding the crop risk of reaching
    an allowable depletion point. However, it is important to mention that the decisions
    taken by the grower show expertise in dealing with this complex process on the
    most difficult type of soil (see Fig. 2), avoiding the allowable depletion point
    and maintaining the soil moisture close to the available water region. Fig. 12
    compares the cumulative irrigation hours applied by the grower with those used
    for the proposed algorithm. On February 09, the grower reported a total of 367
    h of irrigation, while the algorithm used a total of 258 h. This result demonstrates
    the potential of our algorithm to save 30% of the water typically used in seepage-irrigated
    crops in Florida. Notably, seepage irrigation systems are known for their low
    efficiency, often falling below 40% (Dukes et al., 2010). Despite this inefficiency,
    they remain prevalent in Florida. According to the current grower records (personal
    communication), a single hectare of seepage-irrigated sweet corn can consume around
    1500 m3 of water per season. Using this volume consumption as a baseline, our
    proposed algorithm has the capacity to increase water use efficiency up to 450
    m3 per hectare per season. This finding underscores the substantial water-saving
    potential of our DSS, highlighting its significance for sustainable agriculture
    if it is adopted in the state of Florida. Download : Download high-res image (176KB)

    of irrigation hours between the grower technique and the recommendations provided
    by the proposed decision support system. Our study demonstrates significant advancements
    in irrigation management, particularly in incorporating information from weather
    forecasting services to optimize irrigation scheduling. Our approach has shown
    reduced irrigation time in response to anticipated rainfall events. This predictive
    capability offers a distinct improvement over fully automated systems as those
    reported by Domínguez-Niño et al. (2020) and approaches that at the beginning
    of the season precalculate irrigation management based on crop models as reported
    by Hodges et al. (2022), where a consistent reduction in irrigation corresponding
    to rainfall is not evident. We also highlight that the proposed strategy integrates
    multiple information sources for optimal irrigation management based on soil moisture
    and water balance. This is an advancement over the traditional approach presented
    by El-Naggar et al. (2020), where the use of soil moisture sensors and soil water
    balances are seen as independent control techniques, which are compared to elucidate
    the most suitable irrigation practices. While the modernization of irrigation
    systems, as discussed by Çetin et al. (2023), is crucial for sustainable agriculture
    and water conservation, it often involves significant initial investments. This
    can be a major barrier in regions still reliant on traditional irrigation methods
    such as seepage. Our research addresses this challenge by demonstrating that substantial
    water savings can be achieved without full-scale modernization and automation
    of irrigation systems. Our study’s results highlight our approach’s environmental
    benefits, presenting it as a cost-effective alternative for enhancing the sustainability
    of irrigation practices in diverse agricultural settings. Future studies involve
    evaluating the algorithm across varied agricultural settings, encompassing different
    soil types, irrigation methods, different regions, and crops. This is crucial
    for assessing its adaptability and efficacy in water conservation. Concurrently,
    efforts will be directed towards integrating this adaptive decision support system
    (DSS) into accessible digital platforms such as smartphone applications and websites,
    simplifying irrigation decision-making for farmers. Enhancing the DSS algorithm
    will involve developing advanced modeling and estimation techniques to accurately
    estimate and forecast soil moisture dynamics under extreme environmental conditions,
    considering their random and complex nature. The enhancement also includes refining
    predictive models and automated control strategies for more precise irrigation
    scheduling. A key aspect is the creation of control algorithms with mixed objectives,
    such as minimizing irrigation while ensuring optimal crop yield. The implementation
    of Kalman filters and stochastic model predictive control techniques to manage
    forecast uncertainty must be explored. 5. Conclusions In this study, we introduced
    a technological solution to enhance the sustainability of water management in
    agriculture. We developed a decision support system algorithm for irrigation scheduling
    using principles from control theory. This algorithm encompasses modeling, processing,
    estimation, and control stages, ensuring the optimality of the model that describes
    the system. During the evaluation, the estimation stage achieved minimum correlation
    coefficients and values of 0.92 and 0.84, respectively. The algorithm integrates
    the parametrized model, processed data, weather forecasting, and human limitations
    to conform an adaptive feedback plus feedforward irrigation predictive control
    strategy that considers human action in the control loop. The algorithm can consistently
    regulate soil moisture, ensuring it remains at desired levels. This approach reduced
    the risks associated with leaching and runoff and offered the potential for water
    savings of up to 30% in seepage irrigated crops on sandy soils. Looking forward,
    we plan to move towards end-user implementation to promote wider adoption and
    benefits of this technological solution. CRediT authorship contribution statement

    An innovative agricultural system is under development, leveraging the power of
    machine learning to incorporate crop selection, autonomous irrigation, and fertilizer
    recommendation. The primary aim of this intelligent system is to alleviate physical
    labour, conserve energy, and ultimately boost overall productivity for farmers
    [1]. The background study forms the foundational basis of this research, encompassing
    several essential aspects. The main project objective centres around the development
    of an intelligent agriculture system, aimed at optimizing field yield, providing
    valuable insights into crop rotation, continuous area assessment, and enhancing
    irrigation through selective irrigation techniques. In this context, an affordable
    smart farming module based on IoT and ML is introduced, utilizing cutting-edge
    methods to improve the accuracy of results [2, 3]. The research comprehensively
    explores the scope of machine learning in precision agriculture, with a specific
    focus on agriculture and food production. It involves a thorough comparison of
    various machine learning models’ performance in agricultural contexts, identifying
    the most suitable models for agricultural applications. Additionally, the study
    delves into the practical implementation of multiple MLAs, for sensor data analytics
    in the agricultural ecosystem. A case study of an IoT-based smart farm prototype
    is also presented, providing valuable insights into its real-world application
    and benefits. Moreover, introduces a deep reinforcement-based machine learning
    for smart agriculture IoT system, incorporating layers for edge computing, data
    transmission, data collection, and cloud computing. This system seamlessly integrates
    agricultural production with advanced information technologies, such as AI and
    cloud computing, to significantly enhance food output. The algorithms section
    of this study focuses on crop recommendation by leveraging key parameters such
    as N, P, and K values through the implementation of machine learning algorithms.
    A decision tree algorithm is proposed for smart irrigation, utilizing temperature,
    humidity, and moisture as the input parameters. The study further conducts a comprehensive
    analysis of various machine learning concepts for an IoT-based smart agriculture
    system and suggests the adoption of support vector machine (SVM) and decision
    tree algorithms to optimize farming processes and enhance crop growth based on
    soil data [4]. For crop quality and yield assessment, the study explores the integration
    of ML with computer vision techniques for the classification of different crop
    images. The proposed systems and solutions include a smart farming system that
    relies on artificial intelligence methods for prediction. This encompasses data
    collection through sensors, data storage and cleaning, and predictive calculation
    using AI techniques facilitated through a WSN. Furthermore, the study presents
    a solution architecture for designing key performance indicators (KPIs) in precision
    agriculture and recommends an IoT-based smart agriculture structure with a predictive
    approach called WPART. This approach utilizes machine learning techniques to forecast
    crop productivity and drought, facilitating informed decision-making. Additionally,
    the study introduces an intelligent irrigation system that employs the Internet
    of Things (IoT) and a long short-term memory network (LSTM) to achieve precise
    irrigation scheduling. Based on the cited research works, an advanced system has
    been developed to provide crop recommendations by considering various factors
    such as weather and soil conditions, crop requirements, and prevailing climatic
    circumstances. Moreover, this system also facilitates automatic irrigation, weather
    prediction, and open weather API derived from crop and field characteristics.
    First section of this paper describes about the agricultural challenges raised
    by environmental factors, offering possible solutions and introducing the proposed
    system. This section widely explains the need for innovative approaches to address
    these challenges and serves as a foundation for subsequent discussions on the
    functionalities and effectiveness of the integrated system. The second section
    describes about the proposed methodology. It summarizes the conceptual framework
    and technologies used in developing the integrated system; it also explains about
    the systematic approach taken to design a robust and efficient solution. The third
    section proposes an overview of the three main subsystems constituting the integrated
    agricultural system: the crop prediction system, the autonomous watering block,
    and the fertilizer directing system. Each subsystem is explained upon, illumination
    off how machine learning algorithms, weather forecasts, and crop characteristics
    synergistically contribute to their functionalities. The consequent section of
    the paper incorporates the results and discussions derived from simulations of
    the integrated systems. It presents a detailed analysis of the performance and
    outcomes of the crop recommendation, automatic watering, and fertilizer recommendation
    systems. Additionally, this section also describes effectiveness and potential
    suggestions of adopting these systems in real-world agricultural practices [5].
    Finally, the paper is concluded with a complete summary of the work accomplished.
    It highlights the key achievements, emphasizes the significance of the integrated
    system, and summarizes possible future directions for further improvement. Overall,
    this research pays valuable knowledge to the field of agricultural technology,
    showcasing the huge potential of IoT and machine learning in transforming crop
    management practices for enhanced efficiency and sustainability. 2 Method Proposed
    To optimize crop yield, the development of a multifunctional and integrated system
    is crucial. This sophisticated system consists of three primary subsystems: the
    crop recommendation system, the automatic watering system, and the fertilizer
    recommendation system. The crop recommendation system evaluates diverse soil and
    meteorological conditions at specific locations to recommend suitable crops for
    achieving optimal growth. The automatic watering system assesses soil moisture
    levels and weather data, determining the need for watering based on the plant''s
    dampness requirement. Lastly, the fertilizer recommendation system offers guidance
    on the appropriate amount and timing of fertilizer application to ensure healthy
    crop development. The amalgamation of these three subsystems into a single main
    system holds the potential to significantly improve crop growth and yield. 2.1
    Recommendation System for Crops This system functions by initially collecting
    temp., rainfall data, and damp data, for the chosen location and utilizing specialized
    sensors to assess the Nitrogen, Phosphorus, Potassium (NPK) levels and pH of land.
    The weather data, comprising temperature, dampness, and rainfall, is acquired
    through an open weather API on a cloud platform. The collected data is then fed
    into a machine learning model, to determine the optimal crops for the specific
    environmental conditions. The initial discrete data values which are clustered
    using the accuracy of five distinct K-Means clustering machine learning models—Random
    Forest Classifier (RFC), Gradient Boosting Classifier (GBC), Decision Tree (DT),
    Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGB), and K-Nearest Neighbours (KNN)—are subsequently
    compared. Finally, the data collected from both the sensors and the cloud platform
    is transmitted through the most appropriate means. By conducting this comprehensive
    analysis, the system suggests the most suitable crop that is likely to flourish
    in the given location and environmental circumstances (Fig. 1). Fig. 1 Block diagram
    of process Full size image 2.2 Autonomous Watering System This innovative irrigation
    system incorporates a range of sensors and advanced technologies to optimize crop
    irrigation and foster robust plant growth. It employs a moisture sensor to closely
    monitor the soil''s damp content and utilizes a cloud platform which is an open
    weather API to observe and analyse weather conditions. Flow sensors are integrated
    to accurately calculate the quantity of water supplied to the soil. Additionally,
    temperature values are periodically monitored at fixed intervals (P hours). The
    system operates by intelligently assessing the soil moisture levels and weather
    forecasts. When low soil moisture and no imminent rain are detected, it evaluates
    the temperature conditions. If the temperature falls within the normal range,
    the system transverse the pump, watering the plants for some minutes to fulfil
    the crop minimum mist requirements. In cases of high temperatures, the pump extends
    its operation to X + Y minutes, providing ample water to meet the crop''s maximum
    moisture demands. However, when rain is predicted, the system intelligently postpones
    watering until the rain has begun, thereby avoiding unnecessary irrigation. This
    intelligent irrigation system relies on microcontrollers to execute precise watering
    strategies based on factors such as flow sensor data, the field size, and specific
    water needs of the harvested crop. As a result of this advanced technique, plants
    receive the ideal amount of moisture, leading to enhanced growth and maximizing
    crop yields. In conclusion, this innovative irrigation system, powered by state-of-the-art
    sensor technologies and microcontrollers, ensures that crops receive the optimal
    water supply, adapting effectively to varying weather conditions. By diligently
    monitoring soil moisture and weather forecasts, the system optimizes irrigation
    timings, culminating in healthier and more productive crops. This integrated approach
    to irrigation marks a significant advancement in agricultural practices, fostering
    sustainability, and efficiency in crop cultivation. 2.3 Fertilizer Suggestion
    System The fertility of the soil is crucial for the successful growth of crops,
    and it largely depends on the levels of essential proponents like nitro (N), potash
    (K), and phosphorus (P) present in the soil. To correctly measure these values,
    a dedicated NPK sensor is used. Each crop has a specific set of NPK values that
    are used when evaluating the soil quality. The data received from the NPK sensor
    is then carefully examined with the type of crop being grown. This allows the
    system to check whether the soil fertilization is at an optimal level. If the
    soil fertility is found to be ideal, the system recommends using regular fertilizers
    to maintain the soil''s fertility. However, if the soil fertility falls below
    the best level, the system provides valuable suggestions for applying additional
    fertilizers alongside the standard ones to meet the crop''s specific nutrient
    requirements. Additionally, the system offers precise fertilization dosing recommendations,
    ensuring that the soil fertility is preserved and optimized until the harvest
    period. By providing tailored fertilization advice, this intelligent system plays
    a vital role in promoting and sustaining the health and productivity of crops
    throughout their entire growth cycle. 3 Discussion and Results The proposed models
    have undergone simulation, and this section presents the results and findings.
    3.1 Crop Recommendation System Table 1 presents a comprehensive comparison of
    the accuracy achieved by five distinct models. Based on the research findings,
    it is evident that the K-Nearest Neighbours (KNN) machine learning algorithm outperforms
    the other models when applied to the data set, making it the ideal choice for
    implementation in the crop recommendation system. Table 1 Comparison of accuracy
    achieved by five distinct models Full size table Figure 2 displays essential input
    values such as the pH level and the N, K, and P nutrient levels of the land. Additionally,
    the system acquires crucial meteorological data, including humidity, rainfall,
    and temperature, from the cloud platform, considering the provided city input.
    By integrating all this relevant information, the KNN machine learning model efficiently
    identifies the most suitable crop for cultivation in the specific area, leading
    to an accurate recommendation, such as suggesting the cultivation of oranges.

    Table 2 illustrates the crop prediction system''s diverse suggestions for various
    discrete type of in data set, underscoring the system''s adaptability to different
    atmospheric conditions. This exemplifies the system''s capacity to offer personalized
    crop recommendations, thereby enhancing agricultural practices and optimizing
    crop yields for increased productivity and success. Table 2 Crop recommendation
    and their different atmospheric parameters Full size table 3.2 Autonomous Watering
    System In Table 3, the water requirements for each crop are presented, indicating
    the recommended range of moisture in millimetres (mm) essential for promoting
    healthy growth. The system guarantees that the soil mist content is maintained
    for this optimal range to support the crop''s well-being effectively. Table 3
    Water requirements for different crop Full size table To achieve this, the system
    collects input data concerning the specific cultivated crop and the corresponding
    city of cultivation. Utilizing the cloud platform, the system gathers data on
    temperature and rainfall to make well-informed irrigation decisions. 3.3 Fertilizer
    Recommendation System The successful growth of crops relies heavily on the NKP
    data, which are crucial for getting selective outcomes. To ensure healthy crop
    development, the system thoroughly analyses these values and recommends suitable
    fertilizers based on the obtained results. The analysis involves input data, including
    the N, K, and P reading retrieved from the land through the NKP sensing device,
    also as information about the specific crop being cultivated. This data enables
    the system to propose the most appropriate fertilizers and their corresponding
    dosages, facilitating the crop''s healthy growth. By closely detecting changes
    in soil NKP data, the system effectively ensures that the crop receives the essential
    nutrients it needs, resulting in improved growth and enhanced overall yield. 4
    Conclusion A novel system has been developed, capable of providing crop recommendations
    that suit the specific local climate conditions and soil characteristics, as well
    as automating the watering process for plants as needed and suggesting the most
    appropriate fertilizers on behalf of the type of crop. The system is designed
    to offer personalized suggestions for a wide range of crops, including rice, grape,
    maize, cotton, apple, banana, coffee, and orange, ensuring optimal outcomes for
    farmers. By adopting this technology, farmers can make informed decisions, reduce
    manual labour, save energy, and ultimately boost their agricultural productivity.
    As part of future advancements, the system aims to incorporate a disease prediction
    feature that utilizes image classification to forecast crop diseases, thereby
    further enhancing its functionality and contributing to the sustainable development
    of agriculture. References Varghese R, Sharma S (2018) Affordable smart farming

  description: Hydraulic conductivity (Kψ) is one of the most important soil properties
    that influences water and chemical movement within the soil and is a vital factor
    in various management practices, like drainage, irrigation, erosion control, and
    flood protection. Therefore, it is an essential component in soil monitoring and
    managerial practices. The importance of Kψ in soil-water relationship, difficulties
    for its measurement in the field, and its high variability led us to evaluate
    the potential of stepwise multiple linear regression (SMLR), and multilayer perceptron
    (MLPNNs) and radial-basis function (RBFNNs) neural networks approaches to predict
    Kψ at tensions of 15, 10, 5, and 0 cm (K15, K10, K5, and K0, respectively) using
    easily measurable attributes in calcareous soils. A total of 102 intact (by stainless
    steel rings) and composite (using spade from 0–20 cm depth) soil samples were
    collected from different land uses of Fars Province, Iran. The common physico-chemical
    attributes were determined by the common standard laboratory approaches. Additionally,
    the mentioned hydraulic attributes were measured using a tension-disc infiltrometer
    (with a 10 cm radius) in situ. Results revealed that the most of studied soil
    structure-related parameters (soil organic matter, soluble sodium, sodium adsorption
    ratio, mean weight diameter of aggregates, pH, and bulk density) are more correlated
    with K5 and K0 than particle-size distribution-related parameters (sand, silt,
    and standard deviation and geometric mean diameter of particles size). For K15
    and K10, the opposite results were obtained. The applied approaches predicted
    K15, K10, K5, and K0 with determination coefficient of validation data (R2val)
    of 0.52 to 0.63 for SMLR; 0.71 to 0.82 for MLPNNs; and 0.58 to 0.78 for RBFNNs.
    In general, the capability of the applied methods for predicting Kψ at all the
    applied tensions was ranked as MLPNNs > RBFNNs > SMLR. Although the SMLR method
    provided easy to use pedotransfer functions for predicting Kψ in calcareous soils,
    the present study suggests using the MLPNNs approach due to its high capability
    for generating accurate predictions.

    The demands for food, feed, fiber, and fuel increase rapidly due to the fast expansion
    of the global population, income growth, technological advancement, and transport
    and logistics improvements (van Dijk et al., 2021). Precision agriculture (PA),
    which seeks to apply the right amount of inputs (fertilizers, irrigation water,
    pesticides, and other chemicals) in the right location at the right time, is essential
    to meet the requirements of future global food production, as well as environmental
    sustainability and climate resilience. PA is predicated on accurate sensor measurements,
    timely and sound decision-making, and automated actuators. The backbone of PA
    is the Internet of Things (IoT) technology that automates data collection, data
    analytics, data presentation, control, and efficient data communication (Chamara
    et al., 2022). Imaging sensors or digital cameras are essential for PA as they
    can capture more information than traditional scalar or vector sensors. Images
    can capture crop phenology for precise decision-making (Taylor and Browning, 2022,
    Tian et al., 2020). Cyclic events such as vegetative growth, flowering, leaf count
    and color change, maturation, and senescence are studied in crop phenology, which
    is essential to PA as it determines the management inputs required by crops. Moreover,
    images have rich information on the scene that allows for pest pressure evaluation.
    At present, a limited number of sensors are available for pest identification
    and pest pressure estimation. Among them, imaging sensors provide the most promising
    solution. Conventional (handcrafted feature extraction) and Artificial Intelligence
    (AI)-based image processing are the two branches of image processing. Traditional
    approaches extract image features defined by shape, texture, and color (Anubha
    et al., 2019, Yuan et al., 2019). The AI-based methods use Convolutional Neural
    Networks (CNN) to extract features from images (Luis et al., 2020). CNN models
    with multiple hidden layers for feature extraction and learning are considered
    Deep Convolutional Neural Networks (DCNN) (LeCun et al., 1998). Conventional imaging
    platforms in PA store images locally using onboard storage memories. Post processing
    refers to the processing of images stored at the central data storage in batches
    at a later time to extract useful information (Aasen et al., 2020). Imaging platforms
    that can access the internet through a stable connection with high bandwidth can
    automatically upload images to Cloud data storage. The vast majority of farmlands
    worldwide are in rural and remote areas with poor access to electric power and
    internet connectivity. This represents a big challenge for camera systems deployed
    in rural farmlands for high-speed image processing, data transmission, and low-latency
    decision-making (Richardson, 2019). Post-processing of crop images has been used
    for the estimation of leaf area index (Aasen et al., 2020), growth rate (Sakamoto
    et al., 2012), leaf chlorophyll and nitrogen content (Wang et al., 2014), fruit
    counts (Wang et al., 2014), and plant height (Sritarapipat et al., 2014). Further
    post-image processing allows for the assessment of biotic stress, such as pest
    density (Barbedo, 2014; Park et al., 2007) and weed pressure (Wang et al., 2019),
    as well as abiotic stress, such as nutrient deficiency (Ghorai et al., 2021).
    Richardson (2019) suggested that deep learning-based methods have the potential
    to facilitate the extraction of more sophisticated phenological data from both
    new and previously archived camera imagery compared to conventional image processing.
    Semantic segmentation-based canopy coverage (CC) estimation (Chamara et al., 2021;
    Liang et al., 2023), image classification-based crop identification (Anubha et
    al., 2019), disease identification (Sharma et al., 2020), growth stage prediction
    (Yasrab et al., 2021) and object detection-based plant feature identification
    (A. Wang et al., 2019) are examples of DCNN applications in agriculture. Conventional
    image processing requires less computational power and less energy, but they are
    limited in adaption to new scenarios, while deep learning requires high computational
    power and consumes more energy. DCNN models require large memory due to the large
    number of parameters these models hold. Therefore, it is not easy to implement
    these models practically in embedded systems that have less memory and computation
    power. These models also require a large amount of data to train to predict with
    high accuracy. Therefore, it is resource intensive. Edge image processing is the
    image processing done on image-capturing devices. The main advantage of edge image
    computing is that it lowers the high throughput data transmission requirement
    over a wireless IoT-enabled imaging network (Cao et al., 2020). Wang et al. (2022a)
    demonstrated the capability of identifying potted flowers with precision above
    89 % in real-time in a Jetson TX 2 computing module based on a DCNN algorithm.
    These authors suggested that a cloud-edge collaborative framework could achieve
    real-time and automatic learning for the DCNN model they have developed. Wang
    et al. (2022b) proposed a real-time weed detection model run on Jetson AGX Xavier
    for field robots. The authors proved it was possible to do real-time weed detection
    with a precision above 90 % yet required expensive hardware. Wang et al. (2022a)
    reviewed Raspberry Pi single-board computer-based real-time image processing applications.
    They concluded that Raspberry Pi (Datasheet Raspberry Pi Model B, 2019) is a cost-effective
    edge computing unit that could potentially be used as an edge image processing
    unit, and the capability of integrating it with IoT was also discussed. Zualkernan
    et al. (2022) demonstrated an edge image processing platform for the classification
    of animals and transmitting the identified animal and time of identification via
    LoRa for a camera trap. Past literature on IoT and image processing applications
    in agriculture has highlighted a research gap in edge image processing with IoT-enabled
    crop monitoring cameras. In-field crop cameras are expected to make real-time
    crop management decisions based on real-time image processing; however, poor internet
    connectivity in agricultural fields severely limits their capability. To address
    this gap, we have developed a novel imaging platform named AICropCAM that extracts
    plant and crop canopy level parameters through DCNN and uploads them to the Cloud
    via low-power, low-throughput communication protocols. We also demonstrated AICropCAM
    on an IoT-enable wireless sensor network in corn and soybean fields. A technology
    that addresses image processing at the lowest level (edge) and transmits only
    useful information can revolutionize real-time decision-making in PA. Therefore,
    the main objective of this paper is to demonstrate AICropCAM to perform edge image
    processing and low-throughput, low-power, and long-range data transmission through
    IoT technology. In this novel AICropCAM platform, multiple DCNN image processing
    algorithms run in series to extract plant-level and canopy-level features in an
    embedded system. Image classification, object detection with classification, and
    image segmentation are the three major applications of DCNN image processing,
    and all three are included in AICropCAM to demonstrate the capabilities of DCNN
    for image processing in PA. AICropCAM has trained models for canopy segmentation,
    crop classification, plant growth stage identification, plant counting, weed counting,
    and plant type identification. All the protocols that transmit data from AICropCAM
    to the Cloud were custom designed. AICropCAM sends the generated data to a cloud
    platform for logging, visualization, and analysis. Furthermore, this paper explains
    the DCNN model training process, model performance, and test results. We reported
    the model training comprehensively because it was essential for AICropCAM development.
    2. Materials and methods Essential activities in this research were data/image
    collection and preprocessing, hardware design for AICropCAM, software design for
    data transmission between the edge and the Cloud, deep learning model design,
    and model training and optimization (Fig. 1). AICropCAM was implemented in a corn
    and soybean field at the field phenotyping facility in Mead, Nebraska, USA (Bai
    et al., 2019). We demonstrated the training of the following DCNNs: CropClassiNet
    for classifying images based on image quality and crop type, CanopySegNet for
    segmenting crop canopy from the background, PlantCountNet for classifying and
    counting soybean and weed plants, and InsectNet for identifying insects and counting
    them. Download : Download high-res image (412KB) Download : Download full-size

    system (edge devices). 2.1. Image collection, annotation, preprocessing, and augmentation
    Image collection for DCNN model training occurred in four growing seasons using
    three different types of cameras: (i) commercially available Meidas SL122 trail
    cameras in 2019 (Meidas Trail Cameras, 2022), (ii) OV5642 imaging sensors with
    ArduCAM camera shields in 2020, and (iii) Raspberry Pi Camera Module V2 with Raspberry
    Pi Zero in 2021 and 2022 (Chamara, 2021). All the cameras were mounted on the
    bars horizontally extended and fixed on stationary poles erected vertically in
    the fields, as shown in Fig. 2A. The distance between the crop canopy and the
    cameras was maintained between 0.5 and 1.5 m throughout the growing seasons. Images
    used for training the InsectNet were also captured with smartphones as we could
    not collect enough images with insects from the three types of cameras mentioned
    above. Download : Download high-res image (338KB) Download : Download full-size
    image Fig. 2. Left: An Illustration of how AICropCAM was set up in the field for
    image collection. In addition to the camera, other components such as the solar
    panel and data logger were also shown. Right: A close-up view of AICropCAM and
    its hardware components. All three standard image annotation techniques in deep
    learning model training were utilized: (1) folder labeling for the image classification
    models, (2) pixel-level annotation for the semantic segmentation model, and (3)
    bounding boxes for object detection models. Images belonging to the same class
    were grouped into a single folder, and five distinct classes (or folders) were
    created: rejected, corn, soybean, grass, and night. Separating the crop canopy
    from the soil was done with pixel-level annotation and semantic segmentation.
    Bounding boxes, the smallest rectangle around an object, were drawn for corn plants,
    soybean plants, weed plants, and insects. Table 1 explains each type of annotation
    used in the model training. Table 1. Annotation criteria used to generate labels
    from the images to train and test the four deep convolutional neural network models
    in AICropCAM. Labeling Type Class Description Image classification (CropClassiNet)
    Rejected Images were labeled as rejected due to multiple reasons: blurred images
    caused by water droplets on the lens; the cameras turned away from the targeted
    crop; crops growing up to the camera blocking the view or capturing only a few
    leaves; people present in the images; lens covered with different stuff; and the
    camera was not installed in the field. Corn Images entirely covered by corn plants
    at different growth stages. Soybean Images entirely covered by soybean plants
    at different growth stages. Grass/Weed Images only comprise grass/weed plants
    at different growth stages. Night Images captured under low lighting conditions.
    Most of the cameras were not programmed to stop collecting images under low light.
    Crop canopy and background (CanopySegNet) Canopy Pixel labeling was done on the
    crop canopy. We used assisted freehand tool and the superpixel option in the MATLAB
    image labeler. Background Pixel labeling was done on the crop canopy. We used
    assisted freehand tool and the superpixel option in the MATLAB image labeler.
    Plant-type (PlantCountNet) Weed Weed present in the image was labeled using bounding
    boxes. It was challenging to locate the weed after the corn or soybean canopy
    was closed. Soybean Soybean plants present in the image were labeled using bounding
    boxes. Insects (InsectNet) Insects During the labeling process, without distinguishing
    insects based on their type, all the insects present in the images were labeled
    using bounding boxes. Image preprocessing is necessary for DCNN model training
    and real-time edge image processing. Differences in the input layer size in different
    DCNN models demand that images be resized before passing through the model for
    training or prediction purposes. High-resolution images improve accuracy but require
    more computational power. For specific applications, labeled datasets were only
    limitedly available. Therefore, image augmentation techniques were used to increase
    the number of image data sets, including scaling, flipping, cropping, rotation,
    color transformation, PCA color augmentation, and noise rejection (Paymode and
    Malode, 2022). Multiple augmentation techniques were used for each model, as detailed
    in Table 2. Additionally, Table 2 provides the numbers of images in training,
    validation, and testing for the four DCNN models. Table 2. DCNN model image allocation
    and image augmentation. Model Number of images Data Augmentation Techniques Total

    for the DCNN models but to demonstrate the concept of implementing edge image
    processing and transmitting the results to the Cloud for decision-making. Therefore,
    we selected a limited number of images for CanopySegNet, PlantCountNet, and InsectNet,
    which were sufficient to train models with a reasonable degree of accuracy. 2.2.
    DCNN model architecture selection, training, evaluation, and deployment on the
    edge device The steps to select model architecture/model backbone weights and
    image input sizes to train the best model for CropClassiNet, CanopySegNet, PlantCountNet,
    and InsectNet are summarized in Fig. 3. Unlike many DCNN applications that prioritize
    higher accuracy, our application focused on finding the balance between accuracy
    and model deployability on the edge device. Download : Download high-res image

    during the training and testing by attempting different model architectures, model
    backdone weights, and input image sizes. For example, in the development of CropSegNet
    (Segmentation), we selected DeepLabv3+ (Firdaus-Nawi et al., 2018) with weights
    initialized from pre-trained networks of ResNet18 (He et al., 2016), ResNet50,
    Xception, InceptionresnetV2, and MobileNetV2. The input image sizes tested were
    512 × 512 × 3 and 256 × 256 × 3, and training options were kept constant to find
    the best-performing networks, which should also be deployable to Raspberry Pi
    4B. This process identified DeepLabv3 + with ResNet50 as the most suitable model
    for CropSegNet, with an input image size of 512 × 512 × 3. Table 3 summarizes
    the hyperparameter values and training options for the final DCNN models deployed
    to the edge device. (1) (2) (3) (4) (5) (6) (7) Table 3. Hyperparameter values

    used for the classification models CropClassiNet and CropSegNet, whereas IoU and
    mAP (Mean Average Precision) were used for PlantCountNet and InsectNet. Jaccard
    index gives the proportion of correctly predicted labels to the total number of
    labels. Model training was performed on an NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1650 Ti Mobile processor,
    a dedicated mid-range graphics card with 4 GB GDDR6 memory on a Dell XPS 15 9500
    Laptop. The laptop had an Intel Core i7-10750H 10th Gen processor,16 GB DDR4 RAM,
    and 1 TB SSD hard disk. 2.3. Hardware and software of AICropCAM The IoT data transmission
    and edge image processing hardware comprised the following major components: a
    Raspberry Pi 4B single-board computer, an Arduino MKR1310 development board, an
    Arduino MKR Relay Proto Shield, and a Dragino OLG02 outdoor dual channels LoRa
    Gateway (Fig. 4). The 12 V 8Ah battery powered the Raspberry Pi 4B, controlled
    through the relay shield managed by the Arduino MKR1310. A 3.7 V lithium polymer
    battery powered the Arduino MKR1310 board. There are two advantages of having
    a separate Arduino board. First, the Arduino board consumes less power than the
    Raspberry Pi 4B module. It can be switched on and off according to user requirements.
    Second, it allows uninterrupted communication between the edge node and the Cloud
    with low power. Download : Download high-res image (303KB) Download : Download
    full-size image Fig. 4. Hardware overview of AICropCAM and data flow. AICropCAM
    required programming on two hardware platforms. Arduino was programmed using C++
    in Arduino’s Integrated Development Environment. Raspberry Pi imaging and image
    processing program was developed in MATLAB and deployed onto the Raspberry Pi
    4B using the MATLAB Coder and MATLAB Compiler. A python program was designed to
    read the saved data in the Raspberry Pi 4B and serially communicate to the Arduino
    MKR1310. The primary functions of the MRK1310 program were to (1) turn on the
    Raspberry Pi 4B module based on the user-defined time intervals, (2) get the processed
    data, including the results of DCNN model predictions, through serial communication
    from the Raspberry Pi 4B, and (3) transmit the data to the ThingSpeak Cloud channel
    through the LoRa gateway. All the DCNN models were trained using the MATLAB deep
    learning toolbox. In the edge deployment, a MATLAB program runs multiple models
    logically depending on the prediction result of the previous model estimation,
    as shown in Fig. 5. MATLAB coder generated the C and C++ code derived from the
    program we developed to run on the Raspberry Pi. MATLAB Compiler generated the
    standalone application on the Raspberry Pi (The MathWorks, 2022). Download : Download

    image processing and data generation flow chart. Table 4 lists the parameters
    generated by the models in AICropCAM. The abbreviations in Table 4 are fields
    holding data in the program to reduce the complexity of system development and
    maintain a common standard among different platforms. Fig. 6 shows the data generation
    from images. According to Fig. 6, the size of the images were around 2 MB before
    being fed into the image processing pipeline. The output message contains the
    crop type (CT), plant count (PC), weed count (WC), canopy coverage (CC), and pest
    count (PstC). The resulting message is typically less than 100 bytes. This represents
    a substantial reduction of memory size with the output being 0.00005 times the
    size of the original image. Consequently, this message can be transmitted in a
    single message via LoRa as the maximum LoRa packet size is around 256 bytes. Table

    full-size image Fig. 6. Examples of message generation and data size reduction
    for LoRa transmission. 2.4. Data transmission, visualization, and storage The
    data generated after image processing were saved on the Raspberry Pi 4B SD card,
    allowing access to the data remotely or through manual retrieval during field
    visits. Two options for transmitting the collected data to the ThingSpeak IoT
    platform are available. Firstly, the data can be uploaded directly from the Raspberry
    Pi 4B if internet connectivity is available for growers with Wi-Fi access. Secondly,
    the Raspberry Pi 4B transmits the recently acquired data to the Arduino MKR1310.
    The Arduino MKR1310 decodes the data received from the Raspberry Pi 4B and forwards
    it to the ThingSpeak. The second method is for low-rate, long-range communication
    beyond the limit of Wi-Fi. A single message receivable to the ThingSpeak server
    includes data for eight fields. In our demonstration, a single message was enough
    to transmit the data generated. Fields 1 and 2 are reserved for geographic coordinates
    (namely, latitude and longitude) to represent the device''s location. The third
    field was for camera orientation. Image quality/crop type, plant count, weed count,
    insect count, and crop canopy coverage were allocated from fields four to eight.
    ThingSpeak supports eight channels per gateway. If additional data is generated
    in the future, we have to create new channels to accommodate them. However, only
    data in a single channel can be passed through a single message. The Arduino-LoRa
    library was used to prepare the LoRa messages forwarded to the gateway (Mistry,
    2016). The message generated from the Arduino MKR1310 includes the device identification
    number and the data with the field number. Once the gateway receives this message,
    it adds the target client ID (generated by ThingSpeak when defining a device),
    host address (mqtt://mqtt3.thingspeak.com), server port number, username and password,
    channel ID, and the data in each field according to the Message Queuing Telemetry
    Transport (MQTT) protocol. Username and password ensure that only authorized devices
    can transmit data to the ThingSpeak platform. ThingSpeak provides two ways to
    interact with its platform, REST (Representative State Transfer) and MQTT protocols.
    The advantages of using MQTT over REST protocol are that it supports ThingSpeak
    data publishing, including immediate and minimum power consumption and data transmission
    over limited bandwidth, which encouraged us to select the MQTT protocol in our
    demonstration. 3. Results and discussion 3.1. DCNN model performance CropClassiNet
    had a test accuracy of 91.26 %, a Jaccard Index of 0.77, and an F1-score of 0.91;
    the confusion matrix is given in Fig. 7. The highest precision is for the “grass”
    class (100 %), and the lowest is for “soybean” (92.0 %). The highest recall is
    for the “corn” class (99.9 %), and the lowest is for “grass” (67.1 %). The primary
    goal of CropClassiNet is to determine the quality of new images and direct them
    for subsequent processing (Fig. 5). This step has never been executed in an image-based
    crop monitoring platform before. Further, CropClassiNet can eliminate erroneous
    images when humans are present in the camera’s field of view or when the camera
    is misaligned due to external factors. AICropCAM can send maintenance requests
    through IoT analytics if rejected images are continuously generated. Download

    achieved a global accuracy of 0.93, a weighted IoU of 0.87, and a mean BF score
    of 0.73. Fig. 8 shows an example of an original soybean image and the corresponding
    segmentation result by CanopySegNet, which estimated CC to be 18.72 %. Season-long,
    time-series images can be fed into CanopySegNet to generate diurnal and seasonal
    curves of crop CC, as shown in Fig. 9. Download : Download high-res image (621KB)

    and seasonal variations of canopy coverage as computed by CropSegNet. According
    to Fig. 9, canopy coverage percentage variation is low during the daytime and
    reaches zero at night. This verifies the need to eliminate low-light images before
    segmenting. As shown in Fig. 5, it is possible to eliminate the generation of
    false values when the camera captures images under low light conditions by halting
    the process of running CanopySegNet. There are three diurnal variation series
    on 6/8/2021, 6/26/2021, and 7/12/2021 in Fig. 9. The CC increased from 8 % to
    95 % between 6/8/2021 to 7/12/2021. The seasonal trend showed that the CC reached
    a maximum around 7/8/2021. These results suggest that the proposed stacked models
    can track the daily and seasonal CC variation and eliminate the effect of lighting
    conditions on false value generation. Table 5. Performance of PlantCountNet and
    InsectNet on the test image set (Root mean square error (RMSE)/Final validation

    of the PlantCountNet and InsectNet is given in Table 5. Fig. 10(A) and 10(B) show
    the result obtained by PlantCountNet for a soybean image at an early vegetative
    stage (V3). Meanwhile Fig. 10(C) and 10(D) shows the result at a reproductive
    stage (R1). It can be seen that, at V3 stage, the model outputs matched the labels
    of soybean and weed plants well, indicating a level of high accuracy. Download

    result of PlantCountNet for soybean and weed counting: Manually annotated vs.
    model-predicted bounding boxes at V3 growth stage (A and B); manually annotated
    vs. model-predicted bounding boxes at R1 growth stage (C and D). The size of insects
    is very small compared to the size of images (Fig. 11), which is the main reason
    for the low mAP for InsectNet (Table 5). Increasing input image resolution beyond
    480 × 480 × 3 is impractical as it exceeds the memory limitation to load models
    into Raspberry Pi 4B. A potential solution could be to increase the resolution
    of the region of interest by splitting the original image while keeping the resolution
    the same. Also, we suggest using the approach recommended by Tetila et al., 2020a,
    Tetila et al., 2020b in the future on Raspberry Pi model 4B. As technology advances,
    we expect the memory capacities will increase for edge computing units. At the
    same time, the state-of-the-art object detection algorithms will improve the accuracy
    for small object detection. Download : Download high-res image (1MB) Download

    labels. 3.2. Power consumption for Raspberry Pi 4B Since edge cameras in farmlands
    have limited access to electric power, information on their power consumption
    is essential for designing IoT devices and systems. AICropCAM is designed to be
    energized by solar power. It runs on a rechargeable battery when there is no solar
    power. We monitored the maximum energy consumption of each task performed by AICropCAM,
    and the result is presented in Table 6. Four main strategies are available for
    the power management of IoT edge devices: Selecting power-efficient hardware,
    maintaining low power modes, dynamic power management, and cloud-based management.
    Raspberry Pi 4B is an affordable power-efficient single-board computer suitable
    for our application, but it does not naturally support low-power modes. Therefore,
    we introduced the Arduino MKR1310 LoRa module for the Raspberry Pi 4B dynamic
    power management. Furthermore, this Arduino module allows us to perform cloud-based
    central management independently. Table 6. Electrical power consumption of the
    Raspberry Pi 4B and the Arduino MKR1310 during edge image processing. Device Activity

    <0.01A LoRa transmission <0.01A For our measurements, we used a Raspberry Pi 4B
    with 8 GB of RAM, connected to an HDMI monitor, a USB keyboard, and a USB mouse,
    and ran a MathWorks® Raspbian image (file used to boot the Raspberry Pi 4B). The
    Raspberry Pi 4B was operated at room temperature and connected to a wireless LAN
    access point and a laptop via an Ethernet cable. The electric current consumption
    for running each DCNN model was recorded during the test. CropClassiNet had the
    highest current consumption, while the PlantCountNet and InsectNet models had
    the lowest. As for LoRa transmission, we could not measure its current consumption
    because the lowest value our instrument could measure was 0.01A. Based on the
    manufacturer''s specifications, the Arduino MKR1310 consumes 104 uA at 5 V. The
    average time to run the DCNN models is essential to estimate the energy consumed
    for each prediction. These parameters listed in Table 7 provide essential guidelines
    for designing IoT sensor nodes with suitable batteries and power sources. We also
    noticed that typically the first prediction of a model took the longest time,
    but the rest take a considerably shorter time to predict. Table 7. Time duration

    320 × 320 × 3 0.20 3.68 Semantic segmentation was the most power-demanding activity,
    while insect detection was the least. Changing the order of the image processing
    models and adding new models or dropping existing models is possible during regular
    operation. It enables dynamic power management within the Raspberry Pi module.
    The main advantage of AICropCAM is that it implements a stack of four DCNN-based
    image processing models with multiple objectives. To the best of our knowledge,
    this is the first time such a system has been developed for a field crop monitoring
    camera. AICropCAM has applications such as setting up smart in-field or greenhouse
    IoT camera networks with edge computing capability, monitoring crops by attaching
    them to sprinkler irrigation systems (pivots and linear moves), or collecting
    crop information through ground or aerial mobile robots. The relatively short
    time to run each DCNN model makes the system suitable for real-time applications,
    including variable rate irrigation, fertilization, and spraying. For example,
    a pivot irrigated multi-cropping system with AICropCAM can automate irrigation
    or fertigation transition between different crops or crops at different growth
    stages by automatically providing the crop type or growth stage information to
    the irrigation controller. Additionally, existing herbicide or pesticide sprayers
    can get the feedback of the PlantCountNet and InsectNet in the AICropCAM for precision
    spraying. 4. Conclusion and future perspectives This paper outlines the essential
    components of constructing a functional edge image processing framework for real-time
    crop monitoring. From a software standpoint, CropClassiNet can categorize captured
    images according to image quality and detect the presence of specific crop types
    for further processing. CanopySegNet can further quantify the degree of canopy
    coverage; PlantCountNet can count the number of plants and weeds in the image;
    and finally, InsectNet can count the number of insects in the image. These four
    DCNN models, when implemented on edge devices, can extract an array of important
    crop and canopy parameters from field images and enable real-time, low-latency
    decision making and applications. Deep learning-based image processing on the
    edge has excellent potential in PA. Applications of AICropCAM are not limited
    to image classification, segmentation, plant counting, or weed counting. Potential
    future applications include insect classification and crop damage estimation,
    weed classification and pressure estimation, fruit identification and yield estimation,
    decision on replanting (Whigham et al., 2000), and disease identification and
    disease damage estimation in real time using actual field images collected by
    AICropCAM. AICropCAM shows excellent potential in enhancing crop management through
    crop monitoring. However, the current demonstration requires significant improvements
    on both hardware and software fronts. Customized circuitry and modular design
    are required to put AICropCAM in commercial farm applications. The full potential
    of the AICropCAM can be achieved by putting this camera on a moving platform like
    a center pivot with a GPS receiver to generate spatiotemporal data. Crop classification
    must include more crop types, and segmentation models need training data from
    other crop types. The DCNN models for weed and insect identification require the
    capability to identify different weed types, their growth stage, different insect
    types, and their growth stages to generate effective pest control decisions. Additionally,
    improving the models’ accuracy in image classification, segmentation, and object
    detection is crucial. It can be achieved by increasing the number of training
    image data sets. We also planned to expand the research for multiple edge architecture
    evaluation. Architectures such as a high-performance edge computer that accepts
    images from multiple edge devices through short-range, high-speed communication
    (e.g., Wi-Fi) and can run more accurate deep learning models with higher numbers
    of parameters, might be a better solution for the primary objectives addressed
    in this paper. We aim to expand the AICropCAM applications to other crops beyond
    corn and soybean. By making these improvements, AICropCAM will become a more effective
    tool for crop management, potentially revolutionizing how we grow and manage crops.

  description: Implementing intelligent irrigation and adjusting the irrigation system
    is essential in today’s agricultural system to control the amount of water required
    for the plant. This study focuses on data obtained from sensors measuring (soil
    temperature and humidity, temperature and humidity of ambient and light) and image
    processing of plant leaves. To analyze the data, two models were implemented including
    a regression model in SPSS software and another model by genetic programming in
    MATLAB 2018 software. The optimal model was a combined model of sensors and images
    in genetic programming with higher R2 and lower standard error of 0.88 and 0.03,
    respectively. This model was superior to the regression model which had an R2
    and standard error of 0.86 and 0.21, respectively, so this optimal model was selected
    to adjust the microcontroller for the intelligent irrigation system. The following
    year by replanting the crop, the intelligent irrigation system was presented as
    the superior system with 11% water saving compared to the previous year (irrigation
    by the user). Also, no changes were observed in the yield and color indicators
    of the plant at the level of 5%, which indicates the superiority of the intelligent
    irrigation system and its high accuracy of this system.

    1 Introduction As the human population and demand for freshwater resources increase,
    frequent droughts and water scarcity are threatening global food security by severely
    disrupting agricultural production [19]. Improving management methods of consumption
    of agricultural inputs (water especially) and increasing demand productivity is
    challenging in recent years, which requires a deep understanding of plant responses
    to abiotic stresses [5] The implementation of appropriate timing methods for irrigation
    and early detection of water stress in crops before causing irreversible damage
    and reduced yield are one of the ways to increase water consumption and create
    sustainability in agriculture [22]. Recent studies have focused on remote control
    data as an alternative to traditional measurements of crop stress parameters,
    as they provide useful information about spatial and temporal changes in crops
    and soil [3, 18, 19]. Precision farming is a set of technologies that help collect
    and analyze agricultural-related data. These technologies include GPS, sensors,
    remote sensing, and other electronic communication devices [32]. The main goal
    of precision agriculture is to maximize agricultural production by focusing on
    optimizing and improving agricultural processes [37]. Precision agriculture pursues
    goals such as increasing productivity based on reducing environmental damage,
    managing the consumption of inputs in the right place and time, and reducing costs
    by moving within the framework of the principles of sustainable development. It
    can be a reason for the certainty of using new technologies related to precision
    agriculture. Precision farming includes a wide range of electronic equipment (sensors),
    optical instruments (digital and multispectral cameras, hyperspectral, thermal,
    spectrometers, and other related instruments), the use of the World Wide Web and
    the Internet of Things, and includes a large part of computer software that all
    these technologies are used and applied in the production process from land preparation
    to harvesting and processing of the product [3, 18, 19]. Our motivation in this
    work is to design and implement a system for managing the amount of water used
    to irrigate plants and remote control the irrigation system by the user (farmer).
    Then, the designed system was planned according to the proposed model. The irrigation
    system performed the irrigation operation intelligently and was evaluated. This
    research is a comprehensive combination of data including environmental, color,
    and soil. The paper is structured as follows. Section 2 provides a summary of
    related work in the literature. Section 3 elaborates on a detailed explanation
    of our proposed approach, the methods used, and the dataset used. Section 4 presents
    the experiment results and describes them. Finally, Sect. 5 concludes the paper
    and outlines future work. 2 Related work 2.1 Internet of things (IoT) and intelligence
    irrigation system Precision irrigation, which today plays a significant role in
    precision agriculture, as an advanced concept in agriculture, promises to improve
    water use efficiency and maintain or increase crop yield. On the other hand, this
    requires various advanced technologies such as IoT, wireless sensor networks,
    and cloud computing (a platform for collecting information and performing calculations
    in IoT technology) [27]. The concept of the Internet of Things was first introduced
    by Professor Ashton at the MIT Auto-ID Center. The concept of object-to-object
    connection was also coined in 1995 by Bill Gates. IoT technology involves object-to-object,
    object-to-human, and human-to-human connectivity, intending to build a vast network
    of sensors such as remote sensing, GPS, laser scanners, and RFID. The Internet
    of Things has a huge communication infrastructure in which a large number of heterogeneous
    nodes are active in the network and also a large amount of data is exchanged in
    this network which is of macro data type [8, 33]. The most important network in
    this technology is the wireless sensor network (WSN), which consists of one or
    more wireless nodes that are connected to the sensors, and these nodes are also
    responsible for collecting data. The IoT often includes different layers such
    as the physical layer (collecting all sensor data in it), the network layer (data
    transfer), and the decision layer (data analysis and processing) [31]. The Internet
    of Things incorporates various communication technologies to connect different
    objects and also moves towards up-to-date wireless communication [20]. Agricultural
    producers can control the amount of irrigation using a mobile phone based on plant
    color data and environmental and soil characteristics. These days, the Internet
    of Things and predictable models make different solutions possible. Therefore,
    farmers with limited irrigation capacity can store large amounts of water and
    irrigate at the best possible time. The main purpose of smartening the system
    is to supply the required amount of water for agricultural products by monitoring
    soil moisture and temperature, ambient temperature, and color characteristics
    of the plant. Accurate irrigation with the help of the Internet of Things is an
    integral part of precision agriculture and greenhouse management and irrigation,
    and the farmer can monitor the amount of irrigation and the yield of his products
    at any time and any place [10]. It was reported in a study that by measuring soil
    moisture, temperature, and ambient humidity by sensors and receiving data through
    a combination of two technologies the Internet of Things and Unmanned Aerial Vehicles
    (UAVs), the precision and F-measure of this combined technology are 98.77% and
    99.49% respectively. The F-measure, also known as the F1 score, is a metric that
    takes into account both precision and recall. In this case, the high F-measure
    of 99.49% indicates that the combined technology has high precision and recall
    in measuring soil moisture, temperature, and ambient humidity [35]. The multilayer
    perceptron neural network and the Internet of Things were used to predict sugarcane
    yield and reported that the proposed MLP algorithm had a maximum accuracy of 99%,
    a precision of 95%, and an MAE of 0.04% [38]. The combined IoT and blockchain
    system was used as a reliable source of data collection to manage water use in
    precision agriculture. According to the reported results, the proposed system
    can be implemented with only 6% of the additional energy budget compared to the
    performance of normal devices equipped with IoT [25]. The researcher introduced
    the IoT-based irrigation system that was able to control the amount of water consumed
    by measuring soil moisture, humidity, and air temperature. Accordingly, the water
    required for the plant was reported to be 800–600 mm per day at a temperature
    of 40 to 600 °C [23]. In a study, the nitrogen content of cucumber leaves was
    estimated by using partial least squares regression and hyperspectral imaging
    data (including RGB visible range and effective (optimal) and ineffective hyperspectral
    wavelengths) with the neural network. The results showed that the mean regression
    coefficients (R) for synthetic particle swarm optimization (ANN-PSO) in the range
    of 0.937–0.965, partial least squares regression (PLSR) 0.975–0.997, and one-dimensional
    deep neural learning networks (NN). Range 0.965–0.985. Therefore, it was reported
    that among the non-destructive hyperspectral images of leaves, regression models
    have a significant ability to accurately predict the amount of nitrogen in cucumber
    plants [28]. In another study, the rice nitrogen nutrition was estimated with
    RGB images and machine learning techniques. In this study, were used a digital
    camera for recording RGB images of rice canopy and three regression methods (simple
    nonlinear regression, SNR; backpropagation neural network, BPNN; and random forest
    regression, RF) to estimate rice shoot dry matter (DM), estimates N accumulation
    (NA) and leaf area index (LAI). Random forest regression (RF) models had the highest
    accuracy for the data set with average testing prediction accuracy (ATPA) of 80.17,
    79.44%, and 81.82% for estimating DM, LAI, and NA, respectively. The highest standard
    deviation (SD) and interval (5%–95%) of ATPA were observed in BPNN models, indicating
    that the BPNN model has the most susceptible to dataset splitting [34]. The researchers
    used Sentinel-2 remote sensors to measure and estimate soil organic carbon with
    soil color images, from different color spaces including reflectance spectroscopy
    at selected wavelengths in the visible range (700–400 nm), RGB digital cameras,
    and visible bands, as well as, they used machine learning (RF) for modeling. The
    results of RGB digital camera images were obtained with higher R2 and less error
    (R2 = 0.85, RMSEP = 0.11%) compared to spectroscopy (R2 = 0.78, RMSEP = 0.09%).
    Meanwhile, Sentinel-2 remote control sensors predicted soil organic carbon with
    less precision. Therefore, using an RGB digital camera is more efficient and cheaper
    than the other two methods [11]. The study performed regression-based processing
    to classify RGB plant color images. By imaging the pine plant, they concluded
    that the indices R and G (R = f (G)) have the highest Pearson correlation coefficient
    (0.914) and the highest R2 (R2 = 0.835). They presented the regression model y =  − 0.0005241
    X2 + 1.020 X + 40.49 [20]. [13] used a one-dimensional computer, a Pi camera,
    and a simple LED in a three-dimensional printing box. They obtained a prototype
    called Rasp2SPAD through color images and spectral indices to determine plant
    chlorophyll (SPAD), which was modeled for plant SPAD by a simple linear model,
    a generalized linear model, and an artificial neural network. According to the
    results, using color indices b and r, which were obtained as the most sensitive
    color indices from the analysis, a simple linear model with mean absolute deviance
    of 1.85 and R2 = 0.81 was introduced with high accuracy and reduced costs by 5%.
    2.2 Genetic programming Genetic programming is a complete version of the genetic
    optimization algorithm, with the difference that genetic programming in each gene
    Can be considered mathematical operators such as plus, subtraction, multiplication,
    and division, different functions such as logarithmic and trigonometry functions,
    as well as the names of input variables, in addition to numbers (values of decision
    variables). Also, in genetic programming, instead of the usual chromosome structure
    in the genetic algorithm, we encounter a tree structure of chromosomes. In research,
    the bi-objective genetic programming (BO-GP) algorithm was investigated to optimize
    irrigation using reservoir performance. Each operational policy was calculated
    by BO-GP based on the inflow volume to the reservoir, the storage volume, and
    the water demand volume that minimize vulnerability and maximize reliability.
    The results showed that the system vulnerability and reliability are between 16
    to 41% and 46 to 78%, respectively [1]. In another study genetic programming (GP)
    was used to extract and classify farmland using images compared to five common
    classification programs including K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN), Decision Tree (DT),
    Naïve Bayes (NB), Support Vector Machine (SVM), and Random Forest (RF). According
    to the results, GP can maintain high accuracy with any number of samples compared
    to other classifiers by using different numbers of training samples. Therefore,
    the overall precision for KNN, DT, NB, SVM, RF, and GP was 83.3%, 94.4%, 83.3%,
    93.1%, 97.2%, and 98.6%, respectively, with higher GP accuracy in the optimal
    classification [39]. The study, using the combined algorithm of artificial neural
    networks and genetic algorithm to estimate the yield of blue wheat, showed the
    effectiveness of the genetic-neural model to explain the relationship between
    wheat yield and soil characteristics, with a high explanatory coefficient (0.87)
    and low mean square error (RMSE = 473.5) successfully reported [4]. In another
    study, results have shown that multigene symbolic regression genetic programming
    (MSRGP) the optimal performance in parameterizing and predicting nitrate, phosphate,
    and potassium concentrations based on water physical properties with an accuracy
    of 87.63%, 88.73%, and 99.91%, respectively [9]. In a study, a multi-stage compressor
    sensor fault diagnosis method was proposed using data reports, and this concept
    was investigated using genetic programming (GP) to produce a regression model.
    The results showed that the proposed model has an explanation coefficient equal
    to 0.991 and RMSE equal to 2.1*10 − 2 [16]. Table 1 shows a set of studies in
    this field that have been conducted focusing on the limited characteristics of
    factors affecting plant conditions and irrigation. Table 1 Summary of related
    work based on modeling, image processing, IoT, regression Full size table 3 Material
    and methods This study was conducted in Iran, the northeastern region of Khuzestan
    province located in Khuzestan University of Agricultural Sciences and Natural
    Resources. In this study, a greenhouse with an area of 35 square meters (7*5 m)
    was selected. The cucumber crop was studied in this research, which was sampled
    from 12 plants, and relevant measurements were performed. 3.1 Design and construction
    of electromechanical part in intelligent irrigation system In this study, 16 capacitive
    humidity sensors (model SEN0193, China) with an accuracy of 0.1% were used which
    measured the amount of soil water volume using the dielectric properties of water.
    Moisture value were collected by the analog channel of the microcontroller. In
    addition to the non-contact infrared thermometer module (Model MLX90615, China)
    with an accuracy of 0.02, 16 soil temperature sensors (DS18B22, Taiwan) with an
    accuracy of 0.1 degrees Celsius and an optical sensor (MAX44009, China) with an
    accuracy of 0.01 was also used in the set of sensors, In addition, in the set
    of sensors, were used from the non-contact infrared thermometer module (Model
    MLX90615, China) with an accuracy of 0.02, 16 soil temperature sensors (DS18B22,
    Taiwan) with an accuracy of 0.1 degrees Celsius and an optical sensor (MAX44009,
    China) with an accuracy of 0.01 that soil temperature and humidity sensors were
    installed next to each plant to collect data locally. Also, sensors of light,
    temperature, and humidity of the environment were placed at a height of one meter
    above the soil surface [33]. To measure water consumption, a rotating sensor (model
    YF-S201, China) with an accuracy of 0.1 ml was used along with the Hall effect
    sensor. Data recording steps were performed by sensors continuously. Figure 1
    shows a schematic of an intelligent irrigation system in a greenhouse. Fig. 1
    Schematic of storing and transmitting information on a computer and displaying
    information received from sensors via the Internet on the user’s mobile phone:
    1 soil moisture sensor, soil temperature sensor, temperature and humidity of ambient
    sensor, Light sensor 2 send data to microcontroller 3 data storage in memory 4
    send data on user’s mobile with IoT 5 receive data Full size image In this study,
    the factors of ambient temperature, humidity, soil temperature, and plant color
    characteristics were specifically chosen through the utilization of GA based on
    their significant influence on plant yield via their impact on the necessary water
    supply for the plant. These factors were considered more significant than all
    other potential variables. The study revealed that changes in soil temperature
    during the day and night corresponded with changes in plant water loss due to
    fluctuations in soil moisture content. As time progressed, the water requirement
    of the plant increased as a result of increased leaf temperature and changes in
    transpiration, leading to a gradual increase in the wilting process. The study
    also found that changes in plant water content had a direct effect on the color
    characteristics of the plant, which served as visible indicators of deficiencies.
    Consequently, it was concluded that soil temperature and humidity, as well as
    ambient temperature and humidity, had a direct impact on plant yield. ESP8266
    module (ESP-01 model, China) was used for WiFi communication. This low-power module
    uses a frequency of 2.4 GHz to provide a Wi-Fi connection between 400–500 m outdoors.
    All the data obtained from the sensors, in addition to being stored in the device
    memory, were also visible through the Internet and software written in the Android
    environment on the user’s mobile phone, and the user was able to view the function
    of each sensor and their data. On his mobile phone (Fig. 2a and b). Fig. 2 a Schematic
    of the user’s mobile screen and the status of different parts of the irrigation
    system; b Data related to soil temperature and humidity sensors Full size image
    The desired application can be displayed by installing it on any smartphone. As
    shown in Fig. 2 a, the system can be adjusted in two modes: automatic control
    (A) and manual control (M). And if the manual control mode is selected, each of
    the 4 solenoid valves can be turned on or off if necessary, and if the device
    is set automatically, the solenoid valves are turned on and do irrigation according
    to the device forecast (which is based on the planning model in its being). On
    the right side of the sensor data, there are two colors, green and red. Green
    indicates the appropriate conditions for that sensor and the plant, but red indicates
    that the data received (from the sensor) is not in the acceptable range and the
    user must check. 3.2 Image processing In this study, to investigate the color
    characteristics of the plant, imaging was taken every other day after the 2-leaf
    stage (when the plant height reached 20 to 30 cm and the two main leaves were
    fully formed) from the leaves at a distance of 20 Cm (perpendicular to the plant).
    Then, RGB color space was used to examine the images and extract their features.
    The color characteristics used in this image include the mean red, green, and
    blue color parameters [7]. After extracting the image features, the relevant data
    were sorted and used for modeling by genetic programming and regression. 3.3 Genetic
    programming Understanding the structure of problems, mathematical modeling, and
    optimizing the coefficients of the developed model can be done simultaneously
    using GP. The implementation stages of this model include 1. Training stage and
    2. The test stage. In the training phase, the weights are corrected step by step
    until the minimum prediction error is corrected by the software, which means that
    first a series of data as an independent variable (soil temperature, light, ambient
    temperature, ambient humidity, parameters Color r, g, and b) and the dependent
    variable (soil moisture) were entered into the model as input data. Then, MATLAB
    2018 software continued to repeat the calculations by assigning different weights
    to independent variable data and predicting and calculating the value of the dependent
    variables and comparing it with the dependent variable data measured by changing
    the number of weights step by step to reach the least error. Input data were defined
    in 3 ways for the software: 1. Color parameters as input data and prediction of
    soil moisture model based on them, 2. Sensor data (soil temperature, light, ambient
    temperature, ambient humidity) As input data and prediction of soil moisture model
    based on them, 3. A combination of sensor data and color parameters as input and
    prediction of soil moisture model based on a combination of them. In general,
    in a genetic algorithm, the first sets of chromosomes are considered the initial
    population and then a new population is created by performing the combination
    and mutation operations on the chromosomes. Usually, the best case for the initial
    population, percentage of composition, and mutation in each period is obtained
    by trial and error [21]. In this study, the values of these parameters were equal
    to 500, 0.02, and 0.8, respectively. The output of a designed model is displayed
    in the form of a tree diagram (Fig. 3). This tree diagram consists of a set of
    terminals (problem variables) and nodes (mathematical operators). Fig. 3 An example
    of a tree diagram from genetic programming, x 1: r index,  x2: b index,  x 3:
    g index,  x 4: soil temperature,  x5: ambient temperature,  x6: ambient humidity, 
    x7: light index, plus ( +), minus (−), mydivide (/), times (*) Full size image
    According to the above figure, x1, x2,  x3,  x4, x5, x 6, and  x 7 are equivalent
    to the color parameters r, b, g and soil temperature, ambient temperature, ambient
    humidity, and light, respectively. In the end, the best models obtained were presented
    by the graph based on the error rate (RMSE, MSE) and R2. In this method, at the
    beginning of the process, a function is not considered and this method can optimize
    the components of its model components. Genetic programming, unlike genetic algorithms,
    works on the tree structure of formulas instead of a series of binary digits.
    To perform modeling operations by GA, first, an initial population randomly is
    generated to construct the initial tree diagram structure. Then, by crossing the
    information of two members (in nodes), new information is created that these two
    members have the role of parent and child in genetics. The one-point intersection
    method is usually used to select a random point where two members’ information
    is combined. Mutations are determined experimentally based on the calculated fit,
    which is used for randomly changing the type of mathematical operators in nodes
    and their values. In the first stage (training and calibration stage), 70% of
    the data were used and the remaining 30% of the data were used in the test (validation)
    stage of the model. For fitting in the software implementation stages, model parameters
    were selected including various mathematical operators (+ ,−, ×, /) and measurement
    criteria (RMSE, MSE, R2). Then the software was run and the standard error (RMSE)
    was calculated from Eq. 1 [26]. $$RMSE=\\sqrt{\\frac{\\sum_{i=1}^{n}{{(Y}_{i}\\left(m\\right)-{Y}_{i}(p))}^{2}}{n}}$$
    (1) In this formula, Yi (m) is the measured value, Yi (p) is the value predicted
    by the model, and n is the amount of data. To present the regression model, regression
    analysis was performed with SPSS 26.0.0.1 software. Pearson correlation coefficient
    was performed to investigate the correlation between soil moisture as a dependent
    factor and independent factors such as color indicators R, G, and B, soil temperature,
    ambient temperature and humidity, and the amount of light as input factors to
    the program. Finally, the regression equation was presented with its R2. The abbreviation
    was used for the sensors as follows: soil moisture (S.M), soil temperature (S.T),
    ambient temperature (amb.T), ambient humidity (HUM). 4 Results and discussion
    4.1 Regression analysis Regression analysis was performed after RGB color calculations
    and sensor data. According to the results of the regression study, the correlation
    was investigated between soil moisture as a dependent factor, and independent
    factors such as color indices R, G, and B, soil temperature, ambient temperature,
    and amount of light as input factors. According to Table 2, the variables r, g,
    and b, soil temperature, temperature, and humidity of the ambient have a significant
    correlation at the level of 5% with each other and with soil moisture. Also, a
    significant negative correlation was observed between moisture and leaf color
    indices at the level of 5%, considering the amount of soil moisture. As a significant
    positive and negative correlation is observed between soil temperature and soil
    moisture with ambient temperature, respectively, soil temperature increases with
    increasing ambient temperature, and soil moisture follows a decreasing trend.
    In soils with higher humidity, the rate of heat transfer and distribution in the
    soil slows down due to the cooling role of moisture in the soil [29]. Also, the
    relationship between soil temperature and temperature parameters decreases gradually
    with increasing soil depth, although several factors can lead to changes in soil
    temperature such as soil profile characteristics, soil texture, thermal conductivity,
    specific heat, etc. [2]. Table 2 Correlation between soil moisture and color indices
    R, G, and B, soil temperature, ambient temperature, ambient humidity, and light
    level Full size table In the study, soil moisture in several layers was investigated
    using a visual machine. The mean ground surface temperature was not significantly
    correlated with the mean soil moisture during the day but was significantly correlated
    at night [15]. Also, in another study that examined the relationship between ground
    surface temperature and soil moisture during the night and early morning, the
    standard deviation of surface temperature during the day with the average soil
    moisture had a significant negative correlation, while at night, the correlation
    was not significant [41]. In examining the relationship between soil at different
    depths and meteorological parameters, it was reported that temperature parameters
    determine the temperature status of soil depth, and also this relationship gradually
    decreases with increasing soil depth. Thus, the R2 between soil temperature and
    climatic parameters decreased from 0.91 at depths of 5 and 20 cm to 0.81 at depths
    of 50 cm. Also, there was an inverse relationship between the relative humidity
    of the air and soil temperature parameters [2]. On the other hand, the amount
    of moisture available to the plant is reduced with decreasing soil moisture, so
    the color indicators are affected and the color of the leaves becomes brighter,
    Therefore, a significant negative correlation was observed between plant color
    indices and soil moisture. In a study [7], to investigate the intelligent irrigation
    system for Lilium, the effects of water stress on the plant were investigated
    and a significant effect was observed at a 5% level between water stress and plant
    color indices. After examining the significant correlation between the measured
    parameters (temperature and humidity and light of the ambient, soil temperature
    and soil humidity, plant color indicators) and soil moisture, a model combining
    was analyzed with the factors mentioned by the Regression analysis method. According
    to the results, the standardized R2 is equal to 0.868 and the standard error is
    equal to 0.21. Also, considering that regression is significant at the 5% level,
    at least one of the independent variables has a linear relationship with the dependent
    variable (Table 3). Therefore, the regression model was estimated to calculate
    the constant value and coefficient of the independent variable in the regression
    equation (according to Table 4). Table 3 Regression variance analysis Full size
    table Table 4 Calculation of regression coefficients in the regression model Full
    size table The regression equation with R2 = 0.86 is as follows according to Table
    4 and the variable and constant coefficients of the desired factors obtained from
    regression analysis (Formula 2): $$S.M=68.259-0.162 \\left(S.T\\right)-0.310\\left(r\\right)+0.407\\left(g\\right)-0.571\\left(b\\right)-0.145
    \\left(amb.T\\right)-0.153\\left(HUM\\right)$$ (2) In the high regression model,
    the g index has the highest positive coefficient in the model and then the coefficients
    related to ambient temperature, ambient humidity, soil temperature, r index, and
    b have the most negative coefficients, respectively. In the study, regression-based
    processing was performed to segment RGB color plant images. By imaging the pine
    plant, they concluded that R and G indices (R = f (G)) have the highest Pearson
    correlation coefficient (0.914) and the highest R2 (0.835) and presented the regression
    model y =  − 0.0005241 X2 + 1.020 X + 40.49 [20]. In another study, a linear model
    was presented for plant chlorophyll through color indices and spectral images
    that color indices (b and r) were the most sensitive color indices of the analysis.
    A simple linear model with high accuracy (mean absolute deviation of 1.85 and
    R2 = 0.81) was introduced reduced costs by 5%. On the other hand, the light factor
    did not have a coefficient in the predicted model and no effect was predicted
    for it in the model, so the analysis of the results was examined by genetic programming
    [17]. 4.2 Genetic programming analysis To provide the optimal model for predicting
    soil moisture, the predicted models are presented by genetic programming (Table
    5). Table 5 shows the models predicted by the software based on color parameters
    r, g, and b (Eqs. 3–8), data recorded from sensors (Eqs. 9–14), and a combination
    of data. Related to color parameters and sensors (Eqs. 15–19). Table 5 Prediction
    soil moisture formula with genetic programming with RGB data (Eq. 3–8), sensors
    data (Eq. 9–14) as well as RGB and sensors data (Eq. 15–19) as inputs and soil
    moisture as output Full size table According to the proposed models obtained from
    the analysis of results in genetic programming, the best model with high R2 (R2 = 0.89)
    and the lowest error (RMSE = 0.038) is a combination model of images and sensors
    (by comparing the models related to images, sensors and the combined model of
    images and sensors) that Fig. 4 shows the fit line between the measured data and
    the original data (Formula 20): Fig. 4 The fit line drawn between actual values
    and values predicted of soil moisture by genetic programming Full size image $$S.M=0.476518*\\left(X6\\right)-0.216827\\left(\\left(X5\\right)
    *\\left(\\frac{\\left(X3\\right)}{{\\left(X2\\right)}^{\\left(X1\\right)}}\\right)\\right)+53.947099$$
    (3) In this model, 70% of the data (90 data) were used for train and 30% of the
    data (38 data) were used for model evaluation [30]. The Fit linear was performed
    in the training stage between the output (predicted data) and the actual data
    (measured) (Figs. 5, 6) to evaluate genetic programming, then, the R2 was calculated
    for both stages. The two stages of training and testing had a high R2 equal to
    0.802 and 0.806, respectively. Fig. 5 The fit line drawn between actual values
    and values predicted of soil moisture by genetic programming in the program training
    stage Full size image Fig. 6 The fit line drawn between actual values and values
    predicted by genetic programming in the program testing stage Full size image
    The proposed model from genetic programming (22) is superior compared with the
    obtained regression model (21). The regression model and genetic programming are
    as follows: $$\\begin{aligned}S.M =& - 0.162\\left( {S.T} \\right) - 0.310\\left(
    r \\right) + 0.407\\left( g \\right)\\\\ &- 0.571\\left( b \\right) - 0.145\\left(
    {en.T} \\right) - 0.153\\left( {HUM} \\right)\\\\&\\quad \\left( {R^{2} = 0.868}
    \\right)\\end{aligned}$$ (4) $$\\begin{aligned}S.M =& 0.476518*\\left( {X6} \\right)
    \\\\&- 0.216827\\left( {\\left( {X5} \\right)*\\left( {\\frac{{\\left( {X3} \\right)}}{{\\left(
    {X2} \\right)^{{\\left( {X1} \\right)}} }}} \\right)} \\right) + 53.947099\\\\&\\quad
    (R^{2} = 0.8865)\\end{aligned}$$ (5) The proposed model to present to the microcontroller
    for an intelligent irrigation system is a combination model resulting from genetic
    programming due to the higher R2 of the genetic programming model (R2 = 0.8865)
    and less error (RMSE = 0.038360901) (as a combination of color data and sensors)
    than the regression model with a lower R2 (R2 = 0.868) and higher error standard
    (0.21). In the study was reported good performance and high accuracy of genetic
    programming in predicting the optimal model compared to other categories. According
    to the results reported in this research, the GP prediction model had a higher
    overall accuracy than other models such as SSM and RF (98.6%, 97.2%, and 93.1%
    respectively for GP, RF, and SVM) [39]. In research, GEP, MLP, GRNN and RBNN were
    used to model daily evaporation. According to the results, the coefficient of
    explanation for GEP in several stations was equal to 0.98, 0.98 and 097, respectively,
    and of course, LPG prediction models were also selected as the best models [12].
    4.3 Comparison of yield, water consumption, and color indicators in intelligent
    irrigation system (next year) In the second phase of the research (next year),
    after planning the microcontroller with the optimal model obtained from genetic
    programming and adjusting the intelligent irrigation system, the crop was planted
    for the second time and the irrigation system provide the plant’s water needs
    automatically. Therefore, the user only controlled the system to perform the irrigation
    operation correctly and did not interfere with the steps and time of irrigation.
    Therefore, water consumption and crop performance between both stages of the research
    were compared and evaluated to compare and evaluate the performance of the intelligent
    irrigation system with the previous year (values measured by the user in the first
    stage). The yield of the product was equal to 24.40 kg in the first year (total
    yield), which had a similar yield in the second year, therefore no significant
    difference was observed at the level of 5% between them. As shown in Fig. 7, the
    mean performance of the 3 replicates did not differ significantly. Also, statistical
    analysis was performed between the color indices measured in the first and second
    years at the level of 5%, and no significant difference was observed between them
    (Fig. 8). Figures 9, 10, and 11 show the differences between the data measured
    during the growth period in the first and second stages for the color index r,
    g, and b, respectively. On the other hand, the amount of water consumption was
    investigated during the two stages of cultivation. Fig. 7 Product yield (kg) in
    two consecutive years; Y1: irrigation in the first year by the user and Y2: irrigation

    when irrigation was done by the user, and, this amount was equal to 121,420 ml
    when irrigation was done by the intelligent system without user intervention in
    the second year. For this purpose, statistical analysis was performed by T-test.
    According to the results, there was a statistically significant difference at
    the level of 5% between the amount of water consumption in the first and second
    years. As shown in Fig. 8, the amount of water consumption was reduced and saved
    by the intelligent irrigation system by about 11%. Therefore, the farmer can save
    on an economic scale due to the reduction of water consumption in irrigation and
    the lack of reduction in crop yield. Also, he could save water for more crops
    for a long time due to the global water crisis. Similarly in the research, 14,590
    ml of water was stored per day for 90 Lilium plants with the development of an
    intelligent irrigation system [7]. Also, the intelligence drip irrigation system
    was used in rice cultivation and reported that the intelligent irrigation system
    consumes and stores 58.57% and 41.43% of water in comparison to the traditional
    flood irrigation system. It consumes and stores water 86.97% and 13.03% respectively
    while compared to the drip irrigation system [6]. In another study, the wireless
    sensor network was examined to reduce the consumption of irrigation water in corn
    the required information from temperature, humidity, wind, and light sensors were
    received and, Irrigation was ordered to the axes (pipes) according to the water
    requirement of the product. The efficiency of the system used was estimated at
    85% along with the axial drip (pipe) irrigation system. On the other hand, they
    stated that although water consumption in uncontrolled irrigation was 11% less
    than in automatic irrigation, due to the automatic control of this system, it
    is possible to have a higher percentage of optimization and better determine the
    points that need more irrigation [13]. 5 Conclusion In this study, the regression
    model and genetic programming were evaluated to select and implement an optimal
    model for the development of an intelligent irrigation system. The irrigation
    system was programmed based on the optimal model obtained by genetic programming
    which was a combination of sensor data and RGB color indicators from imaging during
    the culture period. Also, the irrigation operations were performed automatically
    in the second period of cultivation and the user received and controlled information
    about sensors and solenoid valves through mobile phones and the Internet. Changes
    in yield and color indicators of the crop weren’t observed after the second period
    of cultivation and evaluation of the intelligent irrigation system. But water
    consumption was reduced and saved by about 11%. Therefore, due to the water shortage
    crisis in the world and the agricultural sector especially, if this system is
    used in greenhouse conditions, for a long time, not only it can improve crop yield
    but also it can save water consumption, and the farmer will suffer less from the
    perspective of economy. 5.1 Featured work In future research, intelligent irrigation
    systems can be developed and planned for other crops. It is also possible to make
    an adjustment to the system and equip it to detect plant deficiencies (nutritional
    deficiencies) so it can intelligently decide about the plant’s water and nutritional
    needs. Data availability The data supporting the findings of this study are available
    upon reasonable request from the corresponding authors. References Ashofteh PA,

  description: Nowadays, various research works is explored to predict the rainfall
    in the different areas. The emerging research is assisted to make effective decision
    capacities that are involved in the field of agriculture broadly related to the
    irrigation process and cultivation. Here, the atmospheric and climatic factors
    such as wind speed, temperature, and humidity get varies from one place to another
    place. Thus, it makes the system more complex, and it attains higher error rate
    during computation for providing accurate rainfall prediction results. In this
    paper, the major intention is to design an advanced Artificial Intelligent (AI)
    model for rainfall prediction for different areas. The rainfall data from diverse
    areas are collected initially, and data cleaning is performed. Further, data normalization
    is done for ensuring the proper organization and related data in each record.
    Once these pre-processing phases are completed, rainfall recognition is the main
    step, in which Adaptive Membership Enhanced Fuzzy Classifier (AME-FC) is adopted
    for classifying the data into low, medium, and high rainfall. Then for each degree
    of low, medium, and high rainfall, the prediction process is performed individually
    by training the developed Tri-Long Short-Term Memory (TRI-LSTM). Additionally,
    the output achieved from the trained TRI-LSTM rainfall prediction in cm for each
    low, medium, and high rainfall. The meta-heuristic technique with Hybrid Moth-Flame
    Colliding Bodies Optimization (HMFCBO) enhances the recognition and prediction
    phases. The experimental outcome shows that the different rainfall prediction
    databases prove the developed model overwhelms the conventional models, and thus
    it would be helpful to predict more accurate rainfall.

  description: Agriculture is facing major challenges such as inefficient irrigation
    systems, climate change, groundwater intensity, food shortages as well as reuse
    of food and water wastes, and much more. The acceptance of different cognitive
    solutions has a significant impact on the fate of cultivating. With a growing
    population, there is a pressing need to provide more food and agricultural crops,
    which necessitates the supply of sufficient water. In agriculture and other human

    Abstract Agriculture is facing major challenges such as inefficient irrigation
    systems, climate change, groundwater intensity, food shortages as well as reuse
    of food and water wastes, and much more. The acceptance of different cognitive
    solutions has a significant impact on the fate of cultivating. With a growing
    population, there is a pressing need to provide more food and agricultural crops,
    which necessitates the supply of sufficient water. In agriculture and other human
    activities, water is still the most important factor.Traditional irrigation water
    management methods are insufficient to face the rising demand. Artificial intelligence
    and simulation models are two new technologies that can help with irrigation and
    water conservation. Farmers will benefit from the technology because it will help
    them achieve higher yields and a more consistent seasonal crop. Artificial intelligence
    is useful to be used in irrigation practice and to predict weather and other agricultural
    conditions. Most of the farmers'' concerns would be alleviated by accurate projection
    or prediction using AI technology. AI-powered sensors are extremely useful for
    extracting essential agricultural data. The information will be helpful in improving
    efficiency of irrigation application. Those designing the next generation of agricultural
    systems models, data, and information systems should embrace new technologies
    and knowledge. Smart phones and networking, remote sensing, open source software

  description: Chromium (Cr) pollution caused by the discharge of industrial wastewater
    into rivers poses a significant threat to the environment, aquatic and human life,
    as well as agricultural crops irrigated by these rivers. This paper employs artificial
    intelligence (AI) to introduce a new framework for modeling the fate, transport,
    and estimation of Cr from its point of discharge into the river until it is absorbed
    by agricultural products. The framework is demonstrated through its application
    to the case study River, which serves as the primary water resource for tomato
    production irrigation in Mashhad city, Iran. Measurements of Cr concentration
    are taken at three different river depths and in tomato leaves from agricultural
    lands irrigated by the river, allowing for the identification of bioaccumulation
    effects. By employing boundary conditions and smart algorithms, various aspects
    of control systems are evaluated. The concentration of Cr in crops exhibits an
    accumulative trend, reaching up to 1.29 µg/g by the time of harvest. Using data
    collected from the case study and exploring different scenarios, AI models are
    developed to estimate the Cr concentration in tomato leaves. The tested AI models
    include linear regression (LR), neural network (NN) classifier, and NN regressor,
    yielding goodness-of-fit values (R2) of 0.931, 0.874, and 0.946, respectively.
    These results indicate that the NN regressor is the most accurate model, followed
    by the LR, for estimating Cr levels in tomato leaves.

    Human life and civilisation are based on water and available freshwater resources,
    increasing well-being and the quality of everyday life. Many efforts have been
    made so far, to balance the relationship between water, environment and the human
    civilisation. All these efforts to manage these relations should be in line with
    the UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and especially SDG#14 (i.e. Life Below
    Water (LBW) (Capello, 2022). LBW is proposed for both governments and private
    sectors worldwide and a majority of experts aim to meet its requirements by improving
    the relevant practices in their own areas (Gulseven, 2020). One significant measure
    for achieving this goal is to protect water resources from wastes and chemicals,
    i.e. contamination (Joshi and Temgire, 2022). The LBW is fundamental to water
    resources with major impacts on human life either directly e.g., drinking water
    or indirectly such as the aquatic, agricultural and industrial activities as illustrated

    image Fig. 1. The impact of the water cycle on human life through direct water
    use and agricultural and industrial activities. Discharge of pollution and wastewater
    directly or indirectly into receiving water resources, especially rivers due to
    human activities are one of the most dangerous threats among all factors threatening
    water resources (Horn et al., 2022). Moreover, industrial wastewater discharged
    into the rivers has resulted in increased concentrations of heavy metals including
    Co, Cr, Cu, Fe, Sb and Zn (Lučić et al., 2022). All these have driven scientists
    to investigate river catchments and identify the contribution of heavy metals
    (including fate and transportation) to the pollution of water resources. Fig.
    2 shows the interaction between the pollution derived from human activities discharged
    into the rivers and the threats to the environment and humans. In addition, there
    might be major threats against rivers with challenging consequences, which require
    all stakeholders such as governments, the private sector and society, to take
    the necessary action to mitigate the negative impacts (Lu, 2022, Hernanda and
    Giyono, 2022). More attention is now given to water resources conservation e.g.,
    LBW in SDG#14 and it can be more crucial in developing countries (Omuku et al.,
    2022). Download : Download high-res image (519KB) Download : Download full-size
    image Fig. 2. The interaction of pollution from human activities discharged into
    a river with the threats to the environment and human demands. The accumulation
    of heavy metals in living organisms, which is also known as bioaccumulation, can
    have severe consequences, which can be resulted in the destruction of water-food
    nexuses in a water body catchment (Lv et al., 2022). Fig. 3 shows this nexus through
    a cycle of industrial and agricultural activities around the river and their impact
    on the nearby environment and SDG especially LBW. These conceptual circular impacts
    can help decision makers to establish sustainable plans for healthy agriculture
    and the protection of human health. This nexus with its impacts on or affection
    by intervention in the relevant sectors has been analysed in research works. For
    example, re-distrution of manufacturing with relevant challenges and opportunities
    for food-water-energy nexus has attracted a lot of attention by stakeholders and
    research communities (Veldhuis et al., 2019). More specifically, it aims to understand
    a conceptual framewok for local nexus network for evaluating the sustainability
    of future localised food systems and their association with energy and water supply
    (Cottee et al., 2016). Furthermore, the scarcity of water resources and the necessity
    of developing water reuse strategies have introduced a new challenge related to
    the impact of pollution on receiving water bodies. This challenge affects the
    water-energy-pollution nexus, leading to the emergence of new intervention strategies
    emphasising the interconnection of these factors (Landa-Cansigno et al., 2020).

    Fig. 3. Defective cycle of the case study river utilisation for gaining more economic
    growth. Given the significant health hazards associated with heavy metals in water
    resources, it is crucial to monitor their presence in receiving water bodies and
    understand their impact on agricultural crops through irrigation. Hence, multiple
    researchers investigated the sources, transportation and fate of heavy metals
    in rivers and their impact on water quality factors and plants irrigated with
    the polluted water. For example, Mokarram et al. (2022) collected experimental
    samples from a river reach to quantify the water quality of a river and estimate
    the spatial distribution of heavy metals released by industrial sectors using
    Kriging methods. The level of heavy metals in soils can also be measured and different
    factors like the distance of river or type of soil can be considered to evaluate
    the role of pollution in the agricultural landscape (Shahradnia et al., 2022).
    Krauss et al. (2002) investigated the potential of using Isoterms as a non-linear
    method to predict some heavy metal concentrations (Cd, Cu, Pb, and Zn) in wheat
    grain and leaves. MacFarlane et al. (2003) analysed the accumulative concentration
    of heavy metals such as Cu, Pb and Zn in different parts of the grey mangrove
    plant. They studied the relationship between heavy metals and several transferring
    factors like pH and sediment concentration. Chojnacka et al. (2005) conducted
    research on the transfer of heavy metal ions (As, Cd, Cr, Cu, Hg, Mn, Ni, Pb,
    Zn) from contaminated soil to plants with a focus on the transfer factors to better
    predict whether a given soil is suitable for cultivation of plants. Adams et al.
    (2004), Ye et al. (2014) and Tang et al. (2018) studied the transfer and prediction
    patterns of heavy metals in crops by empirical regression models along with edaphic
    factors such as total heavy metal content, organic matter content and pH. Verma
    et al. (2007) modelled the cadmium uptake by some vegetables and solved the non-linear
    partial differential equations through an implicit finite difference method using
    Picard''s iterative technique in MATLAB. Boshoff et al. (2014) developed a regression-based
    model to predict the heavy metal (As, Cd, Cu, Pb and Zn) concentration in a soil-plant
    ecosystem in grass and nettle (Agrostis sp./Poa sp. and Urtica dioica L.) plants
    using pseudo total metal concentration. Yu et al. (2016) presented a linear model
    of prediction and distribution of heavy metals (Zn, Cd, Cu, Pb, Cr, and Ni) in
    wheat in Tianjin, China. Zhou et al. (2019) also investigated six heavy metal
    contaminants in soil and the rice-wheat rotation systems in Dingshu an industrial
    region in China. They further implemented a prediction model of Cd for rice and
    wheat grains based on the nonedible organs and soil properties. Kumar et al. (2019a)
    similarly examined a two-factor multiple linear regression model to predict heavy
    metal uptake by water lettuce (Pistia stratiotes L.) from paper mill effluent.
    In another study by Kumar et al. (2019b), Principal Component Analysis, and Accumulation
    Nutrient Elements methods were employed as a regression modelling to predict heavy
    metal uptake by cauliflower (Brassica oleracea var. botrytis) grown in soils irrigated
    by industrial effluent. Zhao et al. (2019) also provided a sigmoid model to predict
    heavy metal uptake by sunflowers in different stages of growth. Their novelty
    was to consider the whole biomass-soil system instead of root-soil system employed
    in previous studies (Thoma et al., 2003, Mathur, 2004, Liang et al., 2009, Wu
    et al., 2009, Tuovinen et al., 2011). Hu et al. (2020) modelled bioaccumulation
    of heavy metals (Cu, Cr, Ni, Hg, Cd, As, Pb and Zn) in soil-crop ecosystems and
    used machine learning algorithms including random forest, gradient boosted machine,
    and generalised linear to identify the transfer process and controlling factors
    in the Yangtze River Delta, China. Eid et al. (2020) developed several regression
    equations to predict the uptake of ten heavy metals (Cd, Co, Cr, Cu, Fe, Mn, Mo,
    Ni, Pb, Zn) by a vegetable (Arugula) in Abha region, Saudi Arabia. Yutao et al.
    (2022) investigated the concentration of several heavy metals, especially Cr,
    in the irrigated soil by electroplating factories effluent located in Jiangsu
    Province, China. They used back propagation (BP) neural network prediction model
    and human health risk assessment. Eid et al. (2022) also developed a regression
    prediction model for evaluating 10 heavy metal uptake into Hordeum vulgare L.
    including roots, foliage and grain. Montazeri et al. (2022) developed a new empricical
    approach for bio-accumulated Cr in tomato during the growth period and evaluates
    different 3D mathematical distribution including Polynomial, Interpolant, and
    Lowest models for estimating Cr concentrations in agricultural crops. Some other
    experts also traced heavy metals in the food chain by collecting and analysing
    samples of fish for heavy metals by using atomic absorption spectroscopy (Dehghani
    et al., 2022). Researchers also investigated the footprint of heavy metals from
    rivers to human bodies to trace and highlight the importance and biomonitoring
    of heavy metals including Cr, Co, Cu, As, Hg, and Pb in rivers (Shaabani et al.,
    2022). In addition to the impact of heavy metals, including Cr on the river ecosystem,
    they are highly risky to the environment, public and ecological health (Ali et
    al., 2022). More specifically, heavy metals generally damage all aquatic ecosystems,
    which requires immediate actions for monitoring and prevention (Ahmed et al.,
    2022). A review of the most relevant research on this issue is listed in Table1.

    Keywords associated with chromium with more than 200 iterations in the literature.
    Overall, the monitoring and simulation of heavy metals discharged into rivers
    by industrial activities were analysed thoroughly by various research works. However,
    the efforts mainly remain in the monitoring phase with a lack of a holistic management
    approach for taking action against increasing the presence of heavy metals. To
    overcome this, the present study aimed to analyse the transport and fate of the
    Cr metal from the beginning (i.e., discharge phase) to the end (i.e., uptake by
    the crops). This approach starts with a field study and continues with gathering
    samples for experimental analyses, investigating and analysing the data to create
    a dataset for developing Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML)
    to forecast pollution spread and finally, supporting managerial systems to make
    informed decisions. The next section presents the material and methods including
    methodology, case study, field research and data collection methods, ML logics,
    and smart framework creating steps followed by presenting results and discussion
    by comparing with the latest publications in this area. Finally, the conclusions
    are drawn by presenting the key findings of the research, followed by making recommendations
    for future works. 2. Material and methods 2.1. Methodology framework Fig. 5 shows

    It started with a site investigation to identify industries and the type of potential
    heavy metals they can potentially discharge into the river. This study selects
    a heavy metal and traces it from the point of discharge to the bioaccumulation
    of the plant and agricultural crops based on the conditions of the area (bioaccumulation
    and its epidemiology-immunology effects for tomato are shown and described in
    Text A1 and Fig. A6 in Appendix A). The concentration of the heavy metal is also
    measured across the river to create a comprehensive database of all sampling and
    potential sources and bioaccumulation in the agricultural crops. Analysing and
    visualising this database can depict the conditions of the river''s health. The
    ML was then trained and tested with an existing database to predict the heavy
    metal for a number of future scenarios. The water quality management of the river
    can then be delineated based on the list of significant parameters of the bioaccumulation
    process, along with depicting future scenarios. More details of these steps are
    described below after presenting the case study in the next section. Download

    The flowchart of the methodology. 2.2. Case study The methodology in this study
    is demonstrated by its application to the real-world case study of the river located
    in the north-western part of Iran (shown in Fig. A1 in Appendix A). The river
    is the main source of water surface for irrigation of agricultural lands, although
    it now has no such function due mainly to the lack of proper inflow and overexploitation
    of water withdrawal at upstream catchments. Finally joins the Harirud River towards
    the East at the borderline between Iran and Turkmenistan. The river is 240 km
    long and passes through mountains, plains and at least four important cities,
    including Mashhad (the capital of the province) (Davari et al., 2020). A collection
    of historical and current pictures of the river (Fig. A2 in Appendix A) shows
    the conditions of the river that have been deteriorated over the time through
    industrial and urban wastewater discharge and lack of environmental management
    (Hajinamaki et al., 2016). The primary pollution sources of the river are shown
    in the dashboard in Fig. 6. As can be seen, the three wastewater treatment plants
    (WWTPs), i.e., Oulang and two Parkands, account for 97.3% of the total pollution
    in the river. These three WWTPs receive urban wastewater and have recently been
    banned from discharging or bypassing into the river. Therefore, the main threat
    will be from the rest of the industries shown in Fig. 6b in which the Charmshahr
    WWTP (CWWTP) is the primary source of pollution in the river. Table A1 in Appendix
    A provides the flow values of pollution discharge. Note that Charmshahr is an
    industrial town located in Mashhad with more than 60 branches and 2,200 workers
    in leather processing. Based on preliminary field investigation and site visits,
    the discharge of CWWTP into the river has a significant amount of Chromium (Cr)
    which needs to be monitored and controlled. The technical details of this approach
    are discussed in the following sections. Download : Download high-res image (152KB)

    WWTPs. 2.3. Data collection This study applies widely used techniques for data
    collection as spatial monitoring and sampling mainly from the river surface (Islam
    et al., 2022). Moreover, the concentration of Cr is measured in the agricultural
    products irrigated by the river within the downstream lands. Fig. 7 illustrates
    the sampling network of the Cr measurements as the schematic representation of
    the catchment, pollution source points, the network/layers for sampling and the
    location of irrigated land and frequency of sampling from the agricultural crops.

    Fig. 7. Sampling scheme of the Cr measurements (a) the pollution source and levels
    and network of sampling and (b) schematic location of agricultural lands for sampling
    and frequency of sampling. As depicted in Fig. 7a, the sampling scheme is designed
    by defining 25 sampling points in a network of 5 m by 500 m in the river, starting
    from the pollution source points and extending by 50 m downstream. The sampling
    is also taken in three levels of depth as 0.5, 0.9 and 1.3 m from the river surface.
    Therefore, each level is divided into 5 sections in both directions and 25 sampling
    points are set, which is a total of 75 samples for measurement. The data were
    collected in September 2019 – 2020 with even distribution between winter and summer
    to provide a picture of a general trend of the Cr concentration throughout both
    seasons in the river. Therefore, a total of 150 samples are measured in the experimental
    practices. The sampling from water is according to the standard of Raven Water
    Sampling, USA. In each practice, three samples are collected from the river and
    the mean value of the chromium amount with less than 5% tolerance is reported.
    Tomato sampling is done manually with experimental instruments (AZ company, Taiwan)
    as per standard methods (Benedetti et al., 2010, AMBRUS, 1979; Papadopoulos, 2008).
    All the water and tomato samples are transferred to the lab in icy bottom less
    than 2 h after the sampling process. The second part of measurement is for data
    collection from the agricultural crops (i.e., tomato in this case) irrigated by
    the river as illustrated in Fig. 7b. Tomato is the main agricultural crop of this
    area. Hence, the Cr concentration is measured inside the leaves of certain tomato
    plants every two days for up to 77 days during the summer before harvesting the
    crop. Note that the location of tomato plants is 500 m downstream of the end of
    the sampling network of the river, that is 550 m downstream of the pollution source
    point. The concentration of total Cr in the lab is measured according to the standard
    of Perkin Elmer Anlyst 700 Atomic Absorption Spectroscopy (AAS) and specific 357.9 nm
    lamp based on standard methods (Hseu, 2004; Standard methods for the examination
    of water and wastewater, 2012). The concentration of Cr in tomato is measured
    based on first acidifying the samples by adding 1 mol L−1 HNO3 (Merck, Darmasdat,
    Germany) and then measuring the concentration in the solution by the AAS. In the
    acidification process of different samples, 2 g from each sample is digested in
    20 mL of the declared acid. The hardness of water samples is measured by Portable
    Water Hardness Testers, HACH, USA (Standard methods for the examination of water
    and wastewater, 2012). Likewise, the pH of samples is measured by Metrohm 827,
    Switzerland (Standard methods for the examination of water and wastewater, 2012).
    Note that Sodium Absorption Ratio (SAR) is a parameter used to evaluate the suitability
    of water for irrigation purposes. It measures the concentration of sodium relative
    to calcium and magnesium in the soil and is an indicator of the potential for
    soil structural problems caused by excessive sodium. The SAR is calculated as:
    (1) where Na+ =the concentration of sodium ions (in milliequivalents per liter,
    meq/L); Ca2+ = the concentration of calcium ions (in milliequivalents per liter,
    meq/L); Mg2+ = the concentration of magnesium ions (in milliequivalents per liter,
    meq/L). In this study, the experimental practices of the SAR measurements were
    done based on the standard methods and techniques (Sposito and Mattigod, 1977).
    2.4. AI application This study applies AI methods written in Python to estimate
    the Cr concentration (µg/g) in tomatoes at different stages in the river and agricultural
    plant. Hence, various ML methods are analysed to identify the most suitable one
    for estimating the concentration of Cr and find their optimum settings. The methods
    include the ordinary least squares Linear Regression (LR) and Neural Network (NN)
    multi-layer perceptron classifier and regressor. The combination of these methods
    is also analysed here to (1) evaluate the potential of regression and classification
    methods for accumulation prediction; (2) ensure the best ML method is selected
    that can be used for similar research and finally (3) examine their compatibility
    with the nature of the dataset. Fig. 8 shows the steps required for building the
    two types of the ML used in this study. Fig. 8a is the general steps of the ML
    starting with pre-processing, dividing data into train and test groups, training
    model, validating and finally testing the model performance with Coefficient of
    Determination (R2). The general steps of the ML method are further customised
    in Fig. 8b in Python under Jupyter Notebook. The steps from pre-processing to
    R2 calculations are utilised by using scikit-learn 1.0.2 library for the LR through
    fitting a linear model with coefficients to gain minimum residual sum squares
    between predicted targets and observed records. Moreover, the NN in the library
    would optimise the log-loss function with Limited-memory Broyden–Fletcher–Goldfarb–Shanno
    (LBFGS) or stochastic gradient descent. Download : Download high-res image (438KB)

    (a) general method and (b) customised by the scikit-learn library. Table 2 shows
    the main features of these two models. The Linear Regression (LR) algorithm in
    the scikit-learn library provides a powerful tool for modeling linear relationships
    between variables with several settings and parameters outlined here. The LinearRegression
    class allows for customisation and fine-tuning of the algorithm''s behaviour.
    The fit_intercept parameter is a boolean value that determines whether to calculate
    the intercept of the linear regression model. More specifically, when setting
    to True, an intercept term will be included in the model. Conversely, when setting
    it to False, it will force the model to pass through the origin (0, 0). The normalise
    parameter was previously used to normalise the input features although it was
    marked as deprecated. However, it is now recommended to use the StandardScaler
    or other appropriate preprocessing methods separately on the input data. The copy_X
    parameter is another boolean value that determines whether a copy of the input
    data should be made before fitting the model. Setting it to True ensures that
    the original input data remains unchanged during the fitting process. The n_jobs
    parameter controls the parallelism of the algorithm. By specifying an integer
    value greater than 1, the computation can be distributed across multiple processors.
    If it sets to − 1, it will use all available processors for parallel execution.
    If it sets to None, the algorithm will use the default value i.e., 1. The positive
    parameter allows the model to enforce non-negativity constraints on the coefficients.
    When it sets to True, it ensures that the coefficients remain positive during
    the fitting process. By adjusting these settings in the LinearRegression class,
    users can tailor the algorithm''s behaviour to their specific needs and achieve
    optimal results when fitting linear regression models. Table 2. Key features of

    on a modular level (Hastie et al., 2009). NN (Classifier) 1. Neural networks require
    less formal statistical training to develop 2. Neural networks can implicitly

    3. Neural networks have the ability to detect all possible interactions between

    training algorithms (Tu, 1996) NN (Regressor) The MLPClassifier algorithm in scikit-learn
    provides a range of configurable settings for constructing a Neural Network classifier.
    Some key selected values for the model include specifying a single hidden layer
    with 130 neurons using hidden_layer_sizes= (130), employing the rectified linear
    unit (ReLU) activation function with activation= ''relu'' to introduce non-linearity
    and capture complex patterns, utilising the ''adam'' solver that combines stochastic
    gradient descent (SGD) and adaptive learning rate methods with solver= ''adam'',
    controlling regularisation strength through alpha= 0.0001, setting the initial
    learning rate to 0.001 with learning_rate_init= 0.001, limiting the number of
    iterations to 200 using max_iter= 200 to prevent overfitting, and adjusting the
    batch size automatically based on the training data size with batch_size= ''auto''.
    These values can be fine-tuned based on the specific dataset and task requirements
    to optimise the classifier''s performance and achieve accurate classification
    results. The MLPRegressor algorithm in scikit-learn provides a range of settings
    to configure a Neural Network regressor. The selected values for the model include
    a hidden layer with 130 neurons, the ''relu'' activation function to introduce
    non-linearity, and the ''adam'' solver as the optimisation algorithm. The alpha
    parameter controls the regularisation strength, while the learning_rate_init determines
    the initial learning rate. The max_iter parameter limits the maximum number of
    iterations during training to 200, and the batch_size is set to ''auto'' for automatic
    adjustment based on the data size. The random_state parameter is set to 1 for
    reproducibility. Other parameters such as tol, verbose, momentum, nesterovs_momentum,
    early_stopping, validation_fraction, beta_1, beta_2, epsilon, n_iter_no_change,
    and max_fun provide additional options for convergence tolerance, verbosity, momentum,
    early stopping criteria, validation set splitting, and optimization. In total,
    the MLPRegressor algorithm has 23 parameters that can be adjusted to suit specific
    needs and optimize performance for regression tasks. The general settings are
    also optimised to achieve the best results that will be discussed in next sections.
    3. Results and discussion Data collection is the essential and primary step of
    this study to portray a realistic perspective of the river with the concentration
    of Cr and how it is taken up to bioaccumulate in the crops, i.e., tomato in the
    downstream agricultural lands irrigated by the river. Fig. 9, Fig. 10, Fig. 11
    show the heatmap of the average concentration of Cr at three depths of the river
    (also see Figs. A3-A5 and Tables A2-A4 in Appendix A). They are based on the data
    collection at these depths and five sections in both directions of X (along with
    the river flow) and Y (perpendicular to the river flow) in both summer and winter
    seasons. As depicted in Fig. 9, the Cr concentration is significantly high in
    the areas close to the pollution source, which is around 30 m distance. Records
    in the same X coordinations are not similar in different Y coordinations, which
    emphasizes that the Cr concentration is gradually decreasing through both directions,
    e.g., along with the river flow and perpendicular to the river flow. By comparing
    the average concentrations of Cr between the two seasons, it is evident that the
    Cr level is higher in the winter than in the summer. In addition, the rate of
    reduction in the average Cr concentration is lower in the winter than in the summer,
    as can be spotted when comparing any two cells between the results of the two
    seasons. Download : Download high-res image (173KB) Download : Download full-size

    concentration (mg/L) at the third level (130 cm depth) of the river in (a) the
    summer and (b) the winter. Fig. 10 shows the records of the average Cr concentration
    in the second level of depth i.e., 90 cm depth from the surface of the river.
    Fig. 10a reveals that the Cr concentration slightly decreases as depth increases
    along with the length of the river (i.e., X direction, and perpendicular flow
    direction i.e., Y direction). The trend of the Cr concentration in Fig. 10b seems
    to be relatively similar to the results in Fig. 11. This similarity between the
    records in the summer and winter is observed at the 50 cm level. Note that the
    average Cr concentration (mg/L) is lower in the second level compared to the first
    level. This may be because the dilution happens when the pollution is discharged
    into the water, and hence the pollution concentration reduces through the depth
    of the river. As depicted in Fig. 11, the average Cr concentration is significantly
    lower at the third level of depth than at the first and second levels which is
    because of diffusion phenomena in depth. According to Fick''s second law, in all
    three dimensions with increasing the distance from the main source of the pollution,
    the flux of contamination is reduced and the effects of both advection and diffusion
    are increased. Therefore, with increasing depth, the intensity of mass transfer
    is increased, and the pollution is much more diluted. This fact also appears in
    the experimental practices and is depicted in Figs A3–5 in Appendix A. In addition,
    the concentration ratio of the lowest level to the middle level is equal to the
    same ratio of the middle level to the highest level. It is clear that the Cr concentration
    is diluted from the water sampling point before reaching to plant and the pollution
    level from mg/L is reduced to µg/L. Fig. 12 shows the variation of some parameters
    obtained by tracing the Cr concentration in the tomato plants for up to 77 days,
    i.e. the harvesting time. These parameters include temperature (Fig. 12a), TDS
    (Fig. 12b), pH (Fig. 12c), total hardness (Fig. 12d), Sodium Adsorption Ratio
    (SAR) (Fig. 12e), mean concentration of Cr in water (Fig. 12f) and the Cr concentration
    in tomatoes (Fig. 12g). Fig. 12a displays that the temperature was mainly around
    22 °C although it was up to 24 °C for some limited days. Fig. 12b illustrates
    Total Dissolved Solids (TDS) which are fairly spread between 600 and 1400 mg/L
    within the 77 days of the experiment. Fig. 12c shows pH ranging between two integer
    values of 7 and 8 in the leaves of tomato plants. Variations of total hardness
    (Fig. 12d) and the mean concentration of Cr (Fig. 12f) in irrigation water samples
    are similar to TDS in Fig. 12b. Likewise, variation of SAR in Fig. 12e is similar
    to pH and takes only two values (either 2 or 3). Interestingly, the variation
    of the Cr concentration in tomatoes (Fig. 12g) is mainly around 0.56 µg/g at the
    beginning of the experiment and gradually releases during the experiment up to
    over 1.29 µg/g that might be related to the the irrigation by the river. Download

    Parameters collected every two days including (a) Temperature (°C), (b) TDS (mg/L),
    (c) pH, (d) Total Hardness (e) Sodium Adsorption Ratio (SAR), (f) Mean Cr concentration
    (µg/L) in water sample and (g) the concentration of Cr (µg/g) in tomato. The parameters
    measured during the 77-day experiment are then used as a database to create ML
    modelling in this study. Hence, the correlation of these parameters with the concentration
    of Cr in tomato samples is first analysed using the linear regression (LR) model.
    The best correlation is obtained for the LR model with the coefficient of determination
    (R2) reaching 0.931 for the Cr concentration in the tomato samples. The coefficient
    of determination for other LR models is 0.655 for the time of sampling, 0.760
    for temperature, − 0.011 for TDS, 1.667 for pH, − 0.009 for Total Hardness, 1.479
    for SAR, and 1.175 for the mean Cr concentration (µg/L) in the irrigation water
    sample. This low rate of correlation indicates some parameters such as pH and
    SAR have no major impacts on the concentration of Cr. The ML model is also trained
    and tested for the database, as 70% of recorded data is used for training and
    the remaining 30% is used for testing. The NN models are developed here for the
    database collected within the 77-day experiment. Based on the settings in Table
    2, R2 for the NN models is 0.743 for the NN classifier and 0.841 for the NN regressor.
    These scores are solid statements indicating the dataset is linear and the trend
    of Cr accumulated in the tomato plants as a simple linear regression is more accurate
    than a complicated NN model with more than 100 hidden layers. However, by increasing
    the number of the hidden layers in the NN algorithms to 500, and the maximum number
    of iterations from 200 to 300, R2 can be improved to 0.874 and 0.946 which is
    higher than the LR''s R2. However, the NN regressor is more sophisticated than
    the NN classifier. This comparison, to some extent, is done with other research,
    but here scores are generally higher. For instance, the best score of other studies
    was reported up to 0.89 for R2 (Quang et al., 2022). Eid et al. (2022) developed
    a special linear regression model for estimating the concentration of 10 heavy
    metals and found the amount of heavy metal in soil, pH, and organic matter content
    affecting heavy metal concentrations in Hordeum vulgare tissues. They achieved
    the highest R2 of 0.76 for Cr in the grains harvested after 77 days. Also, the
    highest and the lowest R2 in the study were related to the Mn in root and Cu in
    grains by 0.96 and 0.39 respectively. Hu et al. (2020) estimated and compared
    the factors controlling the heavy metal (HM) uptake by plants using Random Forest
    (RF), Gradient Boosted Machine (GBM), and Generalised Linear (GLM) models in soil-crop
    systems in the Yangtze River Delta, China. Results showed the best prediction
    for the RF followed by GBM and linear methods. The most important relative variables
    for estimating the Cr concentration were plant type, elevation, heavy metals in
    soil, and soil organic materials. The R2 for estimating the concentration of Cr
    was 0.59, 0.52, and 0.27 in RF, GBM, and GLM respectively. Novotná et al. (2015)
    developed regression models for HM uptake into some crops. The influence of measured
    soil concentrations and soil factors (pH, organic carbon, content of silt and
    clay) on the Cr concentrations in plants was evaluated using multivariate regressions.
    The results showed R2 of 0.55 for Hop and 0.25 for grass mowing. Yu et al. (2016)
    launched a linear regression model to predict HM concentration in wheat grains.
    They used pH, organic matter, and salt concentration in the soil as the most affecting
    factors, but the results did not show a good correlation for Cr concentration.
    Kumar et al. (2019b) explored the HM uptake by cauliflower through multivariate
    regression analysis and found that R2 is equal to 0.8, 0.9 and 0.83 for Cr concentration
    in root, leaves, and florescence of B. oleracea, respectively. Eid et al. (2021)
    investigated the HM concentration in the okra plant (Abelmoschus esculentus (L.)
    Moench) grown in greenhouse conditions and soil amended with sewage sludge. The
    Cr concentration was more concentrated in the roots than in any other parts of
    the plant. The metal bioaccumulation factors were negatively correlated with the
    pH of the soil and positively correlated with soil organic matter content. They
    used a regression model and the results showed R2 equal to 0.79, 0.90, 0.80, and
    0.82 for Cr concentration in fruits, leaves, stems, and roots, respectively. 4.
    Integrated management of the system Discharging heavy metals by industries into
    receiving water bodies needs to be monitored and analysed as presented above.
    However, the whole ecosystem, including the water body, environment, human activities,
    and wastewater discharge from industries and agriculture, also needs integrated
    management under a holistic framework to minimise the impact on the environment
    and human life. Given significant technical efforts and advancements available
    worldwide to remove the pollution of heavy metals in water bodies, the integrated
    management should contain a mechanism to prevent the pollution discharge, minimise
    the negative impacts on aquatic lives and finally minimise the irrigation of agricultural
    lands by contaminated water. However, the lack of managerial efforts may be significant
    despite international conventions. This study suggests that there is an essential
    need for establishing organisations at both national and local levels run by decision-makers
    who are aware of SDGs, especially LBW. In this study, a healthy river used to
    irrigate a major part of one of the greatest provinces in Iran has been affected
    by unsustainable, short-time industrial and economic purposes. In addition, there
    is no valid and scientific estimation of the amount of human health damage due
    to living close to the river or consuming products from those agricultural lands.
    Following integrated management of the whole system, Fig. 13 shows a conceptual
    model of what is needed in this context to protect their natural environment and
    human life. As depicted in the figure, desirable results are achieved by the close
    collaboration of experts, engagement of stakeholders (including relevant industries
    and farmers), and decision-makers (including policymakers) who can set out the
    necessary regulations for water resources conservation and environmental protection.
    Furthermore, technical analysis and findings should be translated into managerial
    instruments and instructions utilised by those who have the power to enforce and
    monitor the integrated system. Download : Download high-res image (362KB) Download

    prospects The study examined a new approach for the fate and transportation of
    Cr in a real-wrold case study of the river ecosystem by analysing its concentration
    at the discharge point up to the end of the irrigated plants and its bioaccumulation
    in agricultural plants irrigated by the contaminated water. In addition to measuring
    the concentration of Cr, several important parameters (i.e., temperature, pH,
    SAR, Total Hardness, TDS) of the tomato plant (the most popular crop production
    in the pilot study) were analysed throughout the 77 days before harvesting tomatoes.
    Three ML techniques (LR, NN classifier, and NN regressor) were also developed
    to identify the correlation between the concentration of Cr in the plant leaves
    and other parameters. Key findings include: • Pollution levels in the river varied
    across depths and seasons, with higher concentrations observed in winter due to
    increased industrial activity and river characteristics. • Bioaccumulation of
    Cr in plants initially measured at 0.56 µg/g, gradually increasing to 1.29 µg/g
    by the harvesting day, likely due to continuous irrigation with contaminated water
    or nutrients from the accumulated soil. • Three machine learning techniques demonstrated
    acceptable coefficient of determination especially NN regressor and LR, indicating
    their potential for estimating Cr concentration in tomato leaves based on influencing
    plant parameters. The study suggests the need for further research to develop
    an integrated management approach for Cr and other heavy metals in the river,
    involving stakeholders, creating comprehensive spatial maps of heavy metals, tracing
    the impact on human consumers, and employing more robust AI methods based on extensive
    databases for validation and model enhancement. CRediT authorship contribution

  description: Agriculture is crucial to economic growth and development. Crop yield
    forecasting is critical for food production which includes vegetables, fruits,

    farmers with real-time or long-term insights about their fields. It allows us
    to identify the areas that require irrigation, fertilization, or pesticide treatment.
    Statistical models struggle to track complex relationships in crop yields due

    solve this problem by training themselves in these relationships, enabling accurate

    in agriculture is challenging due to various factors, but profit forecasting improves

    on the use of ML and DL algorithms to suggest a novel decision support system
    for crop yield prediction with the objectives to develop a robust, accurate model,
    investigate algorithm effectiveness, and create a user-friendly system for informed
    crop production decisions. According to the results, the developed system is capable

    about how to manage their crops. The simulation results demonstrate that the intelligent
    decision support system proposed for crop yield prediction using ML and DL algorithms
    is capable of achieving high accuracy and precision. The system can be used to
    help farmers make better decisions about crop planting and management, which can
    lead to increased crop yields and profits. The results of our experiment show
    that our model is better than the others and it achieves an accuracy of 99.82

    Agriculture is crucial to economic growth and development. Crop yield forecasting
    is critical for food production which includes vegetables, fruits, flowers, and
    cattle. Artificial Intelligence (AI) is rising in agriculture, providing farmers
    with real-time or long-term insights about their fields. It allows us to identify
    the areas that require irrigation, fertilization, or pesticide treatment. Statistical
    models struggle to track complex relationships in crop yields due to numerous
    factors. Machine Learning (ML) and Deep Learning (DL) algorithms can solve this
    problem by training themselves in these relationships, enabling accurate predictions
    in agricultural yield prediction methods. Predicting product performance in agriculture
    is challenging due to various factors, but profit forecasting improves decision-making,
    production, economics, and food safety. The present study focuses on the use of
    ML and DL algorithms to suggest a novel decision support system for crop yield
    prediction with the objectives to develop a robust, accurate model, investigate
    algorithm effectiveness, and create a user-friendly system for informed crop production
    decisions. According to the results, the developed system is capable of making
    precise predictions, which can support farmers in making better decisions about
    how to manage their crops. The simulation results demonstrate that the intelligent
    decision support system proposed for crop yield prediction using ML and DL algorithms

    help farmers make better decisions about crop planting and management, which can
    lead to increased crop yields and profits. The results of our experiment show

  description: Crop evapotranspiration (ETC) water demands are critical decision support
    information for the sustainable use of water resources for optimum crop productivity.
    When measurements of ETC at all locations are not feasible, the prediction of
    ETC and crop growth from weather and soil–water–crop management data using state-of-the-science
    cropping system simulations is a viable alternative. This study compared soybean
    (Glycine max (L.) Merr.) ETC quantified using the eddy covariance (EC) method
    against simulations from two models, (i) the CSM-CROPGRO-soybean module within
    the Decision Support System for Agroecology Transfer (DSSAT) and (ii) CSM-CROPGRO-soybean
    module within the Root Zone Water Quality Model v2.0 (RZWQM) for a grower’s field
    in the Mississippi Delta, USA, during 2017, 2018, and 2019 growing seasons. The
    measured soybean grain yields during the three seasons, respectively, were 4979
    kg ha−1, 5157 kg ha−1, and 5665 kg ha−1. The DSSAT and RZWQM simulated yields
    deviated from the measured yields by −10.8% and 15.4% in 2017, −24.0% and 1.56%
    in 2018, and −6.22%, and 9.98% in 2019. Simulated daily ETC values were less than
    EC estimates by 0.33 mm, 0.29 mm, and 0.23 mm for DSSAT and 0.05 mm, 0.42 mm,
    and 0.24 mm for RZWQM, respectively, for the three seasons. EC-quantified seasonal
    values of ETC were 584 mm, 532 mm, and 566 mm, respectively, for three seasons.
    Similarly, simulated seasonal ETC values were less than EC estimates by 40 mm,
    31 mm, and 16 mm by DSSAT, and 7 mm, 46 mm, and 29 mm by RZWQM. The results obtained
    demonstrated that accuracy in the prediction of ETC varied among models and growing
    seasons. When the magnitude of errors in daily ETC simulations does not deter
    its applications in tactical irrigation water management decisions, a higher degree
    of agreement between measured and simulated ETC values at a seasonal scale is
    more promising for strategical irrigation water management planning decision support.
    Further improvement of the models for more accurate simulations of daily ETC can
    help in more confident applications of these models for tactical crop-water management
    applications.

    water use 1. Introduction Water is a critical resource for optimizing crop physiological
    and reproductive growth, the most limiting factor in agriculture. The amount of
    water consumed to reach crop growth in a particular season depends on ambient
    weather conditions (incoming solar radiation, vapor pressure deficit, wind speed,
    precipitation) and the water available in the soil profile for plant root uptake
    [1,2]. For an agroecosystem, crop evapotranspiration (ETC) represents the primary
    consumptive use of water in crop production, and its magnitude is critical in
    the irrigated production scenario [3]. Cropping systems represent the sequential
    planting of crops over time. Cropping system simulation models can play vital
    roles in estimating the ETC, phenology, and crop yield from weather and other
    soil–water–crop management information to improve the irrigation scheduling for
    enhanced water use efficiency in the sustainable intensification of agriculture
    [1,4]. The efficiency of these models in capturing the water dynamics in the soil–crop
    system in the crop production processes needs to be evaluated for successful applications
    in crop water management. The Lower Mississippi Delta region (LMD), with a humid
    climate, has made a significant contribution to the US economy, producing about
    67% of the soybean, corn (Zea mays), and cotton (Gossypium hirsutum) in the state
    of Mississippi [5]. Under a humid climate, precipitation is, on average, enough
    to meet the crop ETC. In the LMD, averaged over a century, rainfall during the
    soybean growing season was about 400 mm, accounting for only about 31% of the
    annual rainfall [5]. In the LMD, the underlying Mississippi River Valley Alluvial
    Aquifer (MRVAA) is in jeopardy as the water pumped for irrigation surpasses its
    renewal [6]. There is an utmost need to improve irrigation water management by
    scheduling irrigation based on reliable estimates of the ETC, which might prove
    to be a reliable tool for making better irrigation management decisions. Several
    methods, such as lysimeters, eddy covariance, energy balance and Bowen ratio,
    remote sensing, and scintillometers, are available to estimate the ETC [3,7].
    These different methods directly or indirectly estimate the ETC based on soil
    water and physical characteristics of the air canopy, soil, and climatic variables
    [8]. Lysimeters contain a small portion of the field with monolithic or reconstructed
    soil and can measure the soil water balance, either weighing or non-weighing.
    Precision lysimeters are difficult and expensive to construct and require special
    care to maintain. Factors such as the shape and area of the lysimeter, variations
    in plant density and management on and around the lysimeter, interruption of deep
    percolation and lateral flow, and heat flux distortions caused by conductive walls
    could be potential sources of errors. It is critical to decide whether to trust
    or question lysimeter data [9]. The Bowen ratio is measured by the air temperature
    difference between two levels and the vapor pressure difference with air vapor
    pressure measured at the same two levels [8]. The application of the Bowen ratio
    assumes energy storage and advection to be ignored, which can be met only for
    a homogeneous surface or longer than the daily interval [10]. The eddy covariance
    (EC) method requires high-frequency sensor measurements with the simultaneous
    processing of data. Evaluation of the eddy system is challenging due to the large
    fetch area with a highly variable open boundary layer [11]. Satellite sensors
    have been used at the regional/continental scale to estimate the ETC. Still, the
    main restricting factors are the tradeoff between spatial resolution and revisiting
    frequency, cloud cover, physical interpretation of surface variables from satellite
    images, latent heat flux evaluation, and near-surface meteorological acquisition
    data over different satellite pixels [12,13]. However, applications of these methods
    require extensive expertise and expensive specialized equipment for installation
    and operation; hence, they are limited to selected locations and research applications.
    For these reasons, growers and crop consultants usually have no practical way
    to use the crop ETC information output from these measurements. In this context,
    process-based models can be a potential alternative for developing location-specific
    ETC data for scheduling irrigation and developing crop water-(ETC) production
    functions for predicting irrigation water demand [14,15,16]. Particularly for
    soybean, as a short-day plant, it would be challenging to parametrize soybean
    flowering and maturity (temperature × photoperiod interactions) without sufficient
    data to calibrate and evaluate models [15]. Moreover, many tools are available
    for daily ETC estimations from weather and related environmental data. Some tools
    calculate reference or potential evapotranspiration (PET) using a daily or hourly
    time-step approach and crop coefficients to compute the ETC [17]. For PET, some
    of these tools use temperature and solar radiation alone [18]. Many other methods
    use multiple weather parameters such as wind speed, solar radiation, temperature
    and relative humidity or dewpoint [17,19]. The daily ETC prediction for the initial
    phase of valuation of 29 maize (Zea mays) simulation models, developed worldwide
    under the AgMIP program, showed up to six-fold variations among models and days
    of the season evaluated [4]. Included in the cropping system models with intermediate
    complexity but which are widely used models in the simulation of ETC are DSSAT
    [20,21] and RZWQM [14,22], which both have significant success in predicting ETC
    and developing soil–crop–water management decision support information. Simultaneous
    performance comparisons of multiple simulation models help to understand their
    similarities and differences, enabling the identification of limitations in crop
    models. The accurate estimation of crop ETC using simulation models is essential
    to improve irrigation management decisions. Still, before adoption, the simulation
    of the ETC should be tested against a robust set of experimental and weather data
    [21]. The simultaneous comparison of multiple models and evaluations can reveal
    the knowledge gap and possible areas of improvement. The main objectives of this
    study were to compare the two most common simulation models, DSSAT and RZWQM,
    in predicting soybean phenology, grain yield, and ETC with field observations
    and EC measurements under humid climate conditions. 2. Materials and Methods 2.1.
    Field Experiments and Observations The study was conducted on a grower’s field
    (area 500 ha) under continuous soybean production located close to the USDA-ARS
    Crop Production Systems Research Unit’s (CPSRU) farm in Stoneville, Mississippi,
    USA (33°39′ N, 90°59′ W, 42 m above mean sea level). The study site has a humid
    subtropical climate with warm summers and mild winters, with an annual rainfall
    of about 1300 mm. Soils were characterized as Dubbs silt loam (fine-silty, mixed
    active, thermic Typic Hapludalfs). Deep tillage has been applied once to crush
    claypans in three to four years. One to three passes of shallow tillage were used
    annually to control weeds. Furrows were established for irrigation applications
    and planting ridges. On 21 April, 28 April, and 1 May in 2017, 2018, and 2019,
    respectively, Asgro 46X6, a soybean cultivar, was planted on banks of north–south
    rows at 97 cm spacing with an average seeding rate of 407,550 seeds per ha (Table
    1). The seedling emergence was observed 7, 9, and 7 days after planting, and reached
    physiological maturity on 132, 128, and 131 days (average 130 days) after seedling
    emergence (DAE) during 2017, 2018, and 2019, respectively. Table 1. Cultivar parameters
    used for simulating soybean (MG 4.6, ecotype SB0401) using the CSM-CROPGRO-soybean
    model using DSSAT and RZWQM. Leaf area index (LAI) data were collected between
    approximately 10.00 to 14:00 at two-week intervals using an AccuPAR LP-80 Ceptometer
    (Decagon Devices, Inc., Pullman, WA, USA). Soybean phenological stages were recorded
    as outlined by Hodges and French (1985) [23]. Phenological growth stages across
    the field were not uniform as the cultivar, Asgro 46X6 (maturity group 4.6), like
    soybean plants, generally has indeterminate growth characteristics. Each growth
    stage was documented when approximately 50% of the soybean plants reached that
    stage. Furrow irrigation was applied to maintain the soil moisture (50 cm soil
    layer) at 65% of plant available water. About 60 mm irrigation was used three
    times on 51, 59, and 98 days after emergence (DAE) in 2017, two times on 29 and
    82 DAE in 2018, and three times on 83, 108, and 115 DAE in 2019. Soybean yields
    were determined by harvesting the whole farm area (over 500 ha) about two weeks
    after reaching physiological maturity and weighed using harvest combines. Soybean
    grain yield was adjusted to 0% moisture content for comparison with the crop simulation
    model output grain yields at the same moisture content. 2.2. ETC Measurements
    Using the Eddy Covariance System The EC system was centrally located, so the sensors’
    fetch was 200 m in all directions. The EC systems comprised (i) a Gill New Wind
    Master 3D sonic anemometer (Gill Instruments, Lymington, UK) for measuring the
    vertical transport of eddies at 10 Hz, (ii) an LI-7500-RS open-path infrared gas
    analyzer (LI-COR Inc., Lincoln, NE, USA) for measuring water vapor density in
    the eddies, (iii) an NR-LITE2 sensor (Kipp & Zonen B.V., Delft, The Netherlands)
    for measuring net solar radiation, (iv) six HP01SC soil heat flux plates (Hukseflux
    Thermal Sensor B.V., Delft, The Netherlands) for measuring soil heat flux, (v)
    HMP 155 sensor (Vaisala, Helsinki, Finland) for measuring air temperature and
    relative humidity, (vi) a Gill 2D-Sonic sensor (Gill Instruments, Lymington, UK)
    for wind speed and direction, (vii) a HydraProbe sensor (Stevens Water Monitoring
    Systems, Inc., Portland, OR, USA) for soil moisture and temperature within an
    8 cm soil layer, and (viii) a TR 525 tipping bucket rain gauge (Texas Electronics,
    Dallas, TX, USA) for precipitation measurements. All the sensors were installed
    2 m above the canopy in the constant flux layer (Figure 1). Figure 1. Eddy covariance
    unit with sensor cluster positioned 2 m above the canopy centrally located in
    a large farm-scale soybean field. Water flux in terms of latent heat of water
    evaporation (LE, W m−2) was calculated to estimate ETc using the EddyPro v 6.10
    (LI-COR Inc., Lincoln, Nebraska) software and was averaged at 30 min intervals.
    Post-processing of the Eddy covariance data was accomplished using ToviTM software
    (LI-COR Inc., Lincoln, Nebraska). Data quality control of the weather and LE data
    were achieved following the OzFlux methodology (Issac et al. 2017 [24]) to correct
    implausible fluxes during rainfall events. Flux measurements during low, negligible
    turbulence were removed following Mauder and Foken (2006) [25], implemented in
    the EddyPro software (Fratini and Mauder, 2014) [26]. Using the energy balance
    residual, the sensible and latent heat fluxes data were corrected as outlined
    by De Roo et al. (2018) [27]. Gap filling of data was then performed on the quality-controlled
    and corrected fluxes following marginal distribution sampling techniques as outlined
    by Reichstein et al. (2005) [28]. To compute ETC in mm from L.E. fluxes in W m−2,
    a constant conversion factor value of 0.00073 was applied. 2.3. Growing Season
    Weather Conditions Growing season weather data (daily maximum and minimum temperature,
    incoming solar radiation, and precipitation) were retrieved from the Stoneville
    Agricultural Weather Station located within 2 miles of the experimental site (http://deltaweather.extension.msstate.edu/,
    accessed on 25 February 2023) (Figure 2). For all three years, maximum and minimum
    air temperatures during June–August were within the range of ±2 °C of normal (Figure
    2). Few extremes in air temperature were observed either in the early months,
    April 2017, May 2018, or late, September 2019. Rainfall distribution varied extensively
    throughout all three growing seasons. August was highly wet in 2017 and 2018,
    receiving almost four times higher than average precipitation. The growing season
    of 2019 received above-normal rain from May–August, receiving 227%, 177%, 138%,
    and 150% of average monthly rainfall, respectively. Figure 2. Daily rainfall distribution
    and changes in maximum (Tmax) and minimum (Tmin) air temperature during the 2017–2019

    2.4. Parametrization of Cropping System Models Model inputs about cultural practices
    and crop management were similar to actual practices as stated earlier. Soybean
    growth and potential evapotranspiration were simulated using CSM-CROPGRO-soybean
    modules of DSSAT v. 4.8 [29,30] and RZWQM v. 2 [14]. For the CSM-CROPGRO-soybean
    model within DSSAT and RZWQM, parameters for a maturity group 4 were used for
    the simulation (Table 1). Soil, water, and nitrogen parameters were measured in
    the field or obtained from the National Cooperative Soil Survey [2], presented
    in Table 2. Table 2. Soil properties of Forestdale soil series used as model input
    for all three growing seasons. The selection of cultivar coefficients for the
    simulation of soybean in three cropping system models was achieved by manually
    calibrating coefficients for a close match between observed and predicted values
    for leaf area index (LAI), grain yield, time to reach 50% flowering, and physiological
    maturity. Data collected in the 2017 growing season were used to calibrate model
    parameters, and the remaining growing seasons, 2018 and 2019, were used to evaluate
    the simulations. The model calibration based on the single-season data was not
    further modified based on the simulations obtained for the remaining two seasons.
    In DSSAT and RZWQM cropping system models, crop evapotranspiration (ETC) is calculated
    by initially calculating its potential rate (potential evapotranspiration, PET)
    under the given soil–plant–atmosphere conditions, and modifying it with actual
    plant uptake, transpiration, and soil–residue–crop conditions affecting evaporation
    from the soil surfaces [22,31,32]. In the procedure, calculated PET is first partitioned
    into potential soil evaporation (PE) and potential transpiration (PT) using a
    competing method identified by modelers involved in those modules and applied
    as upper limits into actual transpiration and soil evaporation loss from the system
    in the crop growth simulations. When multiple methods and options are available
    for simulations of PET in the three cropping system models, the Priestly–Taylor
    method with a modified ET extinction coefficient (Kep, the coefficient used for
    partitioning evapotranspiration into soil and plant transpiration components)
    of 0.68 based on Boote et al. (2008) is used [33]. For RZWQM, the Shutterworth–Wallace
    [31,34] model was used to calculate potential soil evaporation (P.E.) and potential
    plant transpiration (P.T.). In all three models, the computed P.T. and P.E. set
    the upper limits for actual transpiration and actual evaporation simulated in
    the respective crop growth and simulation modules. 2.5. Model Performance Evaluation
    The valuation of two models, CSM-CROPGRO and RZWQM, were compared based on (i)
    phenological growth stages, (ii) grain yield, (iii) LAI, and (iv) ET. The performance
    of simulation models was judged based on the root mean square error (RMSE), relative
    RMSE (RRMSE), percentage deviation (PD), and Nash Sutcliffe efficiency (E) using
    the following equations. MSE= 1 n − − √ ∑ i=1 n ( P i − O i ) 2 RRMSE= RMSE O
    avg 100 PD={ ( P i − O i ) O i }×100 E=1− ∑ n i=1 ( P i − O i ) 2 ∑ n i=1 ( O
    i − O avg ) 2 where Pi is the ith simulated value, Oi is the ith observed values,
    Oavg is the average of the observed values, and n is the number of data pairs.
    3. Results 3.1. Phenological Stages and Grain Yield For DSSAT, RZWQM, and three
    growing seasons (2017–2019), the simulated number of days from planting to seedling
    emergence, beginning seed, and maturity deviated from the measured values between
    −13 to +6 d (Table 3). Over cropping seasons, the simulation of the number of
    days from seed planting to emergence deviated from measured values from −3 to
    −1 d for DSSAT and ±1 d for RZWQM. Beginning seed formation (R5) varied from −3
    to −13 d for DSSAT and −1 to 6 d for RZWQM. Finally, maturity varied from −5 to
    −12 d for DSSAT, and −1 to 3 d for RZWQM. Grain yield ranged from 72 to −1384
    kg ha−1 for DSSAT, and −360 to 490 kg ha−1 for RZWQM. Table 3. Measured (M), simulated
    (S), and error (S-M) for critical phenological growth stages (in days after planting,

    LAI The maximum observed LAI values were 5.2, 5.8, and 5.8 observed on 102 d,
    107 d, and 88 d after emergence (DAE) for 2017, 2018, and 2019 seasons, respectively
    (Figure 3). In 2017, DSSAT and RZWQM simulated maximum LAI values of 5.82 and
    6.10, observed on 70 DAE and 71 DAE, respectively. The simulation of LAI with
    DSSAT and RZWQM resulted in RRMSE values of 45.0% and 37.8%, respectively. In
    2018, DSSAT and RZWQM simulated maximum values were 5.71 (65 on DAE) and 6.08
    (on 68 DAE), with corresponding RMSE values of 1.30 and 1.05, respectively. The
    simulation of LAI with DSSAT and RZWQM resulted in RRMSE values of 34.5% and 27.8%,
    respectively. In 2019, DSSAT and RZWQM predicted maximum LAI values of 5.85 (on
    67 DAE) and 6.14 (on 67 DAE), respectively. The RRMSE values for DSSAT and RZWQM
    were 17.9% and 17.0%, respectively. Figure 3. Changes in measured and simulated
    (DSSAT and RZWQM models) leaf area index (LAI) during (a) 2017, (b) 2018, and
    (c) 2019 growing seasons of the soybean production system. 3.3. Crop Evapotranspiration
    (ETC) In 2017, the cumulative ETC value using the EC method was 584 mm. In contrast,
    the simulated values were 544 mm and 577 mm for DSSAT and RZWQM, respectively
    (Figure 4). The average observed daily ETC value was 4.71 mm, and DSSAT and RZWQM
    predicted 4.38 mm and 4.66 mm, respectively. The highest observed ETC was 7.75
    mm; DSSAT, and RZWQM had the highest values of 7.19 and 8.08 mm, respectively.
    For DSSAT and RZWQM, the RMSE values were 1.96 mm and 1.39 mm, with corresponding
    RRMSE values of 41.6% and 29.6%, respectively. Figure 4. Daily and cumulative
    seasonal evapotranspiration (ETC) measured with eddy covariance (EC) and predictions
    of DSSAT and RZWQM for calibration and evaluation during (a,b) 2017, (c,d) 2018,
    and (e,f) 2019 growing seasons. In 2018, the cumulative ETC value quantified using
    the EC method was 532 mm, whereas the predicted values were 501 mm and 486 mm
    for DSSAT and RZWQM, respectively. The average observed daily ETC values were
    4.84 mm, when DSSAT and RZWQM predicted 4.55 mm and 4.42 mm, respectively. The
    highest observed daily ETC was 7.69 mm, whereas DSSAT and RZWQM simulations had
    the highest daily ETC values of 7.26 mm and 9.69 mm, respectively. DSSAT and RZWQM
    had RMSE and RRMSE values of 1.82 and 37.7%, and 2.13 and 44.0%, respectively.
    In 2019, the cumulative ETC was 566 mm, and the simulated values were 550 mm and
    537 mm for DSSAT and RZWQM, respectively. The average observed daily ETC was 4.64
    mm, but the average simulated values were 4.41 mm and 4.40 mm for DSSAT and RZWQM,
    respectively. The highest observed ETC value was 7.61 mm, while DSSAT and RZWQM
    had the highest simulated values of 7.21 mm and 9.49 mm, respectively. Two models
    had RMSE and RRMSE values of 2.14 and 46.0%, and 2.56 and 55.1%, for DSSAT and
    RZWQM, respectively. Considering all three growing seasons, the observed average
    daily ETC was 4.73 mm, where the DSSAT and RZWQM simulated values were 4.44 mm
    and 4.49 mm, respectively. The three-year average of observed cumulative ETC was
    560 mm, and for DSSAT and RZWQM the simulated values were 532 mm and 533 mm, respectively.
    4. Discussion As expected in simulating crop phenology, grain yield, and ETC in
    response to management and weather information, the simulated soybean phenology
    and grain yield deviated from the measured values but within the error limits
    commonly reported in the literature [4,35]. In this investigation, simulating
    the soybean crop growth during 2017–2019 in the humid LMD region, the extent of
    deviations of simulated processes depended on the particular model used and growing
    season characteristics. The weather data showed that the amount and distribution
    of rainfall varied extensively during the three growing seasons. During the wet
    years, high-intensity precipitation events increase run off, water infiltrations
    and deep drainage losses. When such large variations in weather during the crop
    growth season drive the cropping system simulation models, it becomes extremely
    difficult for accurate crop growth simulations. However, such errors typically
    observed are comparable to the extent of errors that can occur in the precise
    quantification of those natural processes. This is usually reflected in crop simulation
    results. For simulating crop growth and yield, accurate simulations of crop phenology
    are desired [36]. In soybean growth simulations using two cropping system models
    in this study, simulated crop phenology controls most crop physiological processes
    such as leaf area, biomass accumulation and partitioning, and biological N fixation
    [15]. Indeterminate soybean varieties showed considerable overlap between visual
    growth stages; as such, observations usually are subjected to substantial human
    error. Simulations of growth stages, that is, seedling emergence from the soil,
    first flower, beginning seed, and physiological maturity, showed an overall variation
    of −13 to +6 d (Table 3). However, the magnitude of errors in phenological simulations
    did not reflect the same extent in ETC and grain yield (Table 3). For the grain
    yield prediction, both models overpredict grain yields during 2017 and 2019 and
    underpredict grain yield for 2018. Using RZWQM v 2.0, Anapalli et al. (2019) reported
    an overestimation of simulated grain yield data collected for other locations
    in the LMD by 283 (5%) kg ha−1 and 727 kg ha−1 (+15%) during the 2016 and 2017
    growing seasons, respectively [14]. Battisti et al. (2018) observed that the soybean
    grain yield prediction had a higher rate of reduction when rainfall was diminished
    than when rainfall was increased when comparing four models, AQUACROP, MONICA,
    DSSAT, and APSIM, in Southern Brazil [20]. Both crop models simulated LAI values
    that closely followed observed values from emergence to 40 DAE, but overpredicted
    LAI during 53–78, 48–78, and 58–78 DAE during 2017, 2018, and 2019, respectively.
    Over time, soybean cultivars have changed rapidly in their genetic makeup and
    growth traits, which respond differently to the amount of available water for
    plant uptake and the stress induced on plant growth processes from a deficit or
    excess of water [36]. Overestimation of LAI might be associated with overestimating
    ETC, particularly during the reproductive growth phase. Da Silva et al. (2022)
    also observed an overprediction of E.T. late during the growing season [21]. They
    attributed the outcome to an overestimation of LAI between 60–100 days after planting
    (DAP) for Priestly–Taylor and FAO56 Pennman–Monteith PET methods for the CSM-CROPGRO-soybean
    model. Singer et al. (2010) found that the E + T method overestimated E.T. from
    0.68 to 1.58 mm when comparing evaporation plus transpiration versus ETC from
    the eddy covariance system [7]. For corn, soybean, and cotton cropping systems
    in the LMD, Anapalli et al. (2019) found RMSEs between 0.9 and 1.4 mm and RRMSEs
    between 21 and 37% between the simulated daily ETC from EC and energy balance
    estimates, due to 2 to 12% of the variation in incoming and outgoing energies
    in the EC system [14]. Several studies [1,3,37] emphasized that the crop coefficient
    (KC) often showed considerable variation from FAO-56 values due to wetting events
    and suggested improvement in KC values for the irrigated system due to frequent
    soil surface wetting by rain or irrigation. 5. Conclusions This study emphasized
    the evaluation of cropping system models for simulations of ETC over multiple
    growing seasons. Cropping system models help predict crop ETC from location-specific
    weather–soil–crop management information to develop tactical and strategic water
    management decision support data for optimizing location-specific crop water use.
    We evaluated the DSSAT and RZWQM models for simulations of ETC against those quantified
    using the EC method. Seasonal cumulative ETC simulations by both models compared
    well with EC measurements. The two models evaluated were seen to carry a high
    potential for strategic water management in irrigated production systems. Due
    to the indeterminate growth habits of the soybean crop, the evaluation of phenology
    simulations across models is often challenging. Besides accurate ETC measurements
    and soil properties, datasets should include profile soil moisture measurements
    and in-season biomass accumulation over several growth stages to capture the water
    dynamics in the system arising out of varying rainfall distributions within and
    across crop seasons. However, the study revealed that the two models evaluated
    have a high potential for applications in sustainable water management decision
    support development in field crop agriculture. Author Contributions Conceptualization,

    networkMicroprocessorIrrigation 1. Introduction Agriculture is probably the greatest
    worry to all humanity since the vast majority of food is created by farming. As
    of now, numerous individuals still experience the ill effects of yearning because
    of the absence of food in certain nations, particularly in Africa. Exceptionally,
    hunger caused the persistent undernourishment of in excess of 800 million individuals
    on the planet in 2016. All the more remarkably, in excess of 10 million people
    has been left to die from hunger every year [1]. Clearly, expanding food creation
    is without a doubt a viable method for destroying yearning and destitution. But
    it''s not that easy, the agriculture is a long way from modernization in a large
    portion of agricultural nations, prompting low food creation [2]. In recent days,
    Smart Agriculture (SA) is an arising idea that alludes to overseeing ranches utilizing
    present day Information and Communication Technologies to expand the amount and
    nature of items while advancing the human work required [3]. Especially, the SA
    frameworks bring together several advanced computer and information technologies
    such as Artificial Intelligence (AI), Internet of Things (IoT), and Cloud Computing
    (CC) into the smart agricultural creation [4]. Among these techniques, IoT and
    AI are the predominantly significant technique that creates the SA framework.
    Without the role of IoT and AI, it''s significantly not possible to create a SA
    system [5,6]. In the SA system, the IoT is mainly used to automatically collect
    agricultural data and to transmit the collected data to the data centres. Whereas,
    artificial intelligence techniques analyze the agricultural data using the machine
    learning, neural network and clustering technique for smart decision-making in
    the SA system [7,8]. For example, when there is lack of water in the environment
    created with smart agriculture framework, the action will be taken immediately
    to watering the crops in that environment by analysing the data collected by the
    IoT and AI analysing the data. Several researchers have been working to develop
    smart agriculture model using AI and IoT. In [9], smart agriculture based on IoT
    system and deep reinforcement learning with four-layer has been developed. The
    developed system also integrated AI and CC to increase smart agriculture food
    production. In [10], the author has developed Agri trust, (i.e.,) a trust management
    approach for smart agriculture using CC and IoT. The developed Agri trust identifies
    malicious and compromised data interval and provides a friendly agricultural environment
    to the people migrated from other cities. In [11], the author has developed an
    Agro-IoT collaboration framework for creating a smart agriculture environment.
    The developed Agro-IoT framework is specially designed for sugarcane agriculture.
    The developed framework facilitates a live communication medium between farmers
    and government. It also works as a monitoring medium to observe the growth of
    the crops, moisture content and to control the cultivation wastages. In [12],
    IoT and AI-based architecture system for smart cities and agriculture have been
    developed. The developed architecture converges the earlier system to develop
    a smart system using layered, service-oriented and cloud-based software architecture
    using IoT and the architecture enhances the yielding. In [13], the author has
    developed smart farming using the IoT to rectify the current food production.
    The author has also reviewed several methodologies addressing smart agricultural
    problems. The author has proved that the IoT and AI could be the methods that
    could solve the crop framing problems and improve the accuracy of crop diagnosis.
    In [14], the author investigates 6 G wireless systems with IoT for the expected
    support in truly global wireless communications, anywhere and anytime. The developed
    system with 6G-IoT is an ISTN, that is expected to be at the core of 6 G communication
    systems, and how to build a high-capacity yet low-cost ISTN is of significant
    importance in developing global 6 G communication systems. In [15], the author
    presents a point-by-point overview of remote advancement towards the 6G-IoT network.
    In this review, the great spotlight is on the new compositional changes related
    with 6 G networks, portrayed by universal 3D inclusion, the presentation of unavoidable
    AI and upgraded network convention stack. Spotted hyena optimizer, Emperor penguin
    optimizer with bio-inspired, Seagull optimization algorithm, STOA based bio-inspired
    based optimization algorithm has been developed to solve industrial engineering
    problems [16], [17], [18], [19], [20]. Later, artificial intelligence, neural
    network, and machine learning based solutions are been provided for complex industrial
    engineering problems [21], [22], [23], [24], [25], [26], [27]. These soft computing
    techniques can be further utilized for autonomous irrigation system. For the review,
    it has been identified that the autonomous irrigation system requires technology
    to support such as AI, 6-G network and IoT [21]. Combining all these together
    could build up a new paradigm that will sort out current problems in smart agriculture.
    In this paper, an autonomous irrigation system for smart agriculture using Artificial
    Intelligence (AI) has been developed. The developed smart agriculture irrigation
    system helps in transforming the traditional irrigation system to create a hassle-free
    smart agriculture irrigation model using AI and 6 G enabled IoT. The developed
    autonomous irrigation system is purely based on prediction algorithm which is
    mount in a microprocessor, which uses weather history data using IoT to identify
    and predict rainfall patterns and any climatic changes; hence it creates an intelligent
    system which irrigates the field depending upon the outer environment. The developed
    system not only checks the environmental condition, but it also measures the moisture
    content of the soil to supply the required amount of water to the crops. The developed
    autonomous AI and 6 G -IoT based smart agricultural irrigation system has been
    tested under control environment with an accuracy of 86.34% which could probably
    the solution for irrigating crops in future. 2. Smart agriculture Smart agriculture
    is focusses on the use of data acquired through various sources such as, geographical
    data, historical data and mechanical system data to manage the agricultural activities.
    Smart frameworks separate themselves through their capacity to record the information
    and bode well out of it. Keen cultivating utilizes equipment like IoT, AI and
    programming Software as a service (SaaS) to catch the information and give significant
    bits of knowledge to deal with all the procedure on the homestead, both pre- and
    post-reap. The smart agriculture frame work is shown in Fig. 1. The information
    is coordinated, open constantly and brimming with information on each part of
    money and field tasks that can be observed from any place on the planet. IoT in
    horticulture includes sensors, robots and robots associated through the web which
    work consequently and semi naturally performing activities and social occasion
    information pointed toward expanding productivity and consistency. With expanding
    requests and lack of work across the globe, horticulture computerization and robots
    or regularly known as Agri-bots are beginning to acquire consideration among ranchers.
    Yield creation diminished by an expected 213 crores approx ($3.1 billion) a year
    because of work deficiencies in the different countries. Ongoing headways in sensors
    and AI innovation that lets machines to prepare on their environmental factors
    have made ag-robots more prominent [28]. The world is in the beginning phases
    of an ag advanced mechanic''s unrest with a large portion of the items still in
    preliminary stages and R&D mode. Download : Download high-res image (517KB) Download

    farming system, self-loader robots with arms can identify weeds and splash pesticides
    in the influenced plants, setting aside the plants just as by and large pesticide
    costs. These robots can likewise be utilized in reaping and lifting. Hefty cultivating
    vehicles can likewise be explored from the solace of homes through telephone screens
    to perform errands and GPS can follow their situations at without fail. Robots
    furnished with sensors and cameras are utilized for imaging, planning and reviewing
    the ranches. They can be distantly controlled or they can fly consequently through
    programming-controlled flight plans in their inserted frameworks, working as a
    team with sensors and GPS. From the robot information, bits of knowledge can be
    drawn with respect to trim wellbeing, water system, splashing, planting, soil
    and field, plant checking and yield forecast and significantly more. The IoT based
    far off detecting uses sensors put along with the ranches like climate stations
    for social event information which is communicated to insightful instrument for
    examination. The information gathered from light, moistness, temperature, shape
    and size have a possibility to change the yield. Furthermore, the information
    gathered by sensors regarding mugginess, temperature, dampness precipitation and
    dew discovery helps in deciding the climate design in ranches so development is
    accomplished for appropriate yields. The investigation of nature of soil helps
    in deciding the supplement worth and drier territories of ranches, soil seepage
    limit or acridity, which permits to change the measure of water required for the
    water system and the select most useful sort of development. PC imaging includes
    the utilization of sensor cameras introduced at various corners of the ranch or
    robots outfitted with cameras to create pictures which go through advanced picture
    handling. The pictures are utilized for quality control, illness identification,
    arranging and reviewing yield and water system observing through Image handling
    joined with AI which uses pictures from information base to contrast with pictures
    of harvests with deciding the size, shape, shading and development accordingly
    controlling the quality. 3. Developed AI and 6G-IoT based autonomous irrigation
    system IoT based smart irrigation system framework is fit for mechanizing the
    water system measure by breaking down the moisture level of soil and the atmosphere
    condition. At the point when the power supply is given to the microcontroller,
    it will check the dirt moisture level content of the soil [29]. On the off chance
    that the moisture content isn''t up to the limit then it makes the motor to pump
    water on consequently and turns off naturally on the off chance that it scopes
    to the limit level. The list of sensors applicable in the smart agriculture is
    listed in Table 1. The need for water for any crops is likewise decreased radically.
    Far off checking is too conceivable in IoT based savvy water system framework.
    Table 1. Sensor for IoT applications in autonomous irrigation system. Sl. No.
    Sensor devices Applications 1 Volumetric Sensor Volumetric soil moisture sensors
    straightforwardly measure the measure of water in the dirt. This classification
    has the most sensor types: neutron dampness tests, heat dispersal sensors, and
    the normal, di-electric sensors. 2 Di-electric sensors The di-electric sensors
    measure the di-electric steady of the dirt, an electrical property reliant on
    soil dampness content, and can be bought in 3 varieties: Time Domain Refractometry
    (TDR) sensors, Time Domain Transmissometer (TDT) sensors, and capacitance or Frequency
    Domain Refractometry (FDR) sensors. 3 Tensiometers Tensiometers are soil dampness
    sensors that measure this strain between soil particles and water atoms. A tensiometer
    is a vertical, water-filled cylinder with a permeable tip that is embedded into
    the dirt at suggested profundities; the dirt coaxes water out of the permeable
    tip of the fixed cylinder, making a vacuum. Drier soils make a more grounded vacuum
    since water atoms are more diligently to pull off soil particles. 4 Solid state
    sensors Solid state sensors are an expensive device, that is used to measure the
    soil data. Solid state sensors work by utilizing two cathodes to quantify the
    electrical obstruction in the dirt. More water in the dirt will decrease electrical
    opposition in light of the fact that the electrical momentum can go through the
    water simpler; less water will build the obstruction. After the electrical obstruction
    is estimated the water strain is determined to decide the plant accessible soil
    dampness. 5 Granular matrix sensors Granular matrix sensors have a granular matrix
    inside a metal case. The electrical sensors are embedded in the granular matrix
    above a gypsum wafer. 3.1. IoT and AI framework In the developed autonomous irrigation
    framework, there are four layers which interact with each other. The layers such
    as Physical, Edge, Cloud, and Network are bond with each other by means of 6G-IoT
    and AI through a web service. Fig. 2 shows the architecture of the developed AI
    and IoT based autonomous irrigation system. The web service is written in PHP
    with a light weighted REST API to convey the information between the field gadget
    and the worker. The assistance is facilitated on Apache (Web worker) at the worker
    machine. The microcontroller gadget sends the field information to the worker
    utilizing this web administration. This web administration can deal with the organization
    variance/blackout during synchronizing the information from the documented gadget
    to the worker with the assistance of banner settings at the data set level. A
    web administration has been created in Arduino to gather the climate determining
    information. This web administration additionally totals the climate estimating
    information like temperature, mugginess, shadiness, UV Index and precipitation
    of various web determining entryways like Open Weather and Accuracy Weather utilizing
    API of these gateways. The created web administration read the anticipated information
    of the predetermined area utilizing API and store it in MySQL data set at the
    worker, which is considered in the forecast calculation. In the contest, the IoT
    Edge is an administration that expands on top of the IoT Hub and empowers clients
    to complete edge registering. Edge processing is when information is dissected
    on gadgets, that is, at the edge of the organization, as opposed to in the actual
    cloud. With edge processing, you can abstain from moving crude information via
    doing information cleaning, total, and examination on the actual gadget, and afterwards
    send the bits of knowledge acquired to the cloud. This will bring about diminished
    transmission capacity costs, faster reaction times and decreased traffic. This
    runs on each IoT Edge device and manages the modules deployed there. It performs
    a number of functions including monitoring and managing the device and facilitating
    communications between the modules, the device, other devices, and the cloud.
    The runtime supports both Linux and Windows operating systems. Download : Download

    based autonomous irrigation system framework. The developed framework is also
    used to predict the soil moisture based on field information and climate determining
    information utilizing support AI calculation. The algorithm shows data with respect
    to soil moisture of the forthcoming days. It likewise gives water system recommendations,
    in view of the characterized level of soil moisture content and anticipated precipitation,
    to save water and energy. The created data by calculation and gadget is put away
    in MySQL Database at the worker. Besides, the created system controls the hand-off
    change to begin/stop the water engine. In this module, a water siphon is associated
    with a hand-off switch that is constrained by a Wi-Fi empowered hub. The hub is
    constrained by the web administration through a trigger from the responsive electronic
    interface for continuous observing. Utilizing this electronic interface, the water
    siphon can be overseen distantly in manual and auto modes. The correspondence
    advances utilized in the proposed design is the Wi-Fi module/6G-Mobile information
    correspondence. In this trial examination, a Wi-Fi module has been utilized to
    send information to the worker. The algorithm used in the micro controller is
    given below. Algorithm of irrigation scheduling Initialize soil moisture content

    6G networks AI techniques provide the best opportunity to train auto-learning
    models to realize network optimization for 6 G wireless networks, allowing providers
    or operators to optimize the network parameters, resources or architectures to
    better adapt services for devices, finally make 6 G networks become intelligent,
    and agile. The improvement of 6 G network has an enormous scope, multi-layered,
    high perplexing, dynamic, and heterogeneous. Moreover, 6 G network need to help
    consistent availability and assurance different QoS necessities of the tremendous
    number of gadgets, just as cycle enormous measure of information produced from
    actual conditions. Computer-based intelligence procedures with ground breaking
    examination capacity, learning capacity, upgrading capacity and astute acknowledgement
    capacity, which can be utilized into 6 G network to brilliantly do execution advancement,
    information revelation, modern learning, structure association and confounded
    dynamic [30,31]. With the assistance of AI, we present an AI-empowered smart design
    for 6 G network which is fundamentally isolated into four layers as illustrated
    in Fig. 2. 3.2. Experimental setup The main objective of this experiment is to
    collect the physical parameters of a farming land using sensors and to utilize
    these sensors’ data along with weather forecast information for developing an
    algorithm for prediction of soil moisture of the upcoming days. The algorithm
    uses a hybrid machine learning approach, as discussed in Section 3.1, to achieve
    higher accuracy in soil moisture prediction. The experimental setup is shown in
    Fig. 3. The Fig. 3(a) illustrates the architecture of the control connection kit,
    which consists of 6G-commnuication module with IoT enabled for fetching weather
    data and climate change data. The microcontroller board is connected to the tensiometer
    sensor. The tensiometer sensor is a filed data collection device that has been
    deployed in the garden of the test environment which was created to assess the
    performance of the autonomous irrigation system using AI-IoT based 6G network.
    The data collected in the test environment is stores in the server using the web
    service. Later, the collected data are been analysed using the AI approach and
    6G-IoT is responsive for the real time monitoring and data visualization. Fig.

    Fig. 3(b) shows the 6G-IoT of water system arranging module to plan the water
    system by setting Irrigation Date and Threshold Levels for Soil Moisture. This
    data, anticipated soil dampness and precipitation data will help client/rancher
    in arranging/planning of ideal water system. The created module works in two modes,
    viz., auto, and manual. In manual mode, the client takes the planning choice dependent
    on anticipated soil dampness and precipitation data. In auto mode, the client
    sets the Soil Moisture Threshold levels, and the framework naturally plans the
    water system date dependent on the anticipated soil dampness and climate conjecture
    (precipitation) data. For instance, if the downpour is normal on the planned water
    system date or close to the planned date, at that point, the framework will hang
    tight for the downpour and it will suspend the counterfeit/manual water system
    or it will begin watering (if necessary, in light of the calculation) the field
    to keep up least soil dampness work the appearance of the downpour. Further, the
    framework can deal with the progressions in gage precipitation esteems. The developed
    prototype can be extended to irrigate large area. 4. Result and discussion A profound
    assessment has been carried out to evaluate the performance of proposed autonomous
    irrigation system using AI-IoT based 6G network. In this assessment the developed
    module as discussed in Section 3.2 is assessed in the test environment created
    with devices like halogen lamp, measured oxygen content, air conditioner and water
    filter. The devices could absorb the moisture content of the soil and will help
    for fast testing. The testing was conducted on 24/12/2020 and 25/12/2020. The
    temperature of the test environment was measured in the interval of an hour. The
    halogen lamp in the test environment has been used like the daylight, the intensity
    of luminous has been increased during day bright hours. The data observed for
    the room temperature is depicted in the Fig. 4. From the figure it can be observed
    that the test environment temperature varies from 19°C to 33 °C. Further, in the
    meantime, humidity level has been assessed in the test environment and obtained
    humidity measurement is depicted in Fig. 5. From the figure it can be observed
    that humidity is 55% during morning and evening, and is 24% to 26% during day
    time. Moreover, the moisture level of the soil has been measured using, Volumetric
    Sensor, Tensiometer sensor, and Solid-state sensor and fed with the 6G-IoT module
    and AI system for further processing. The moisture level varies between 10% to
    45% and the observation data obtained for the test environment is depicted in
    the Fig. 6. From the figure it has be observed that the soil moisture reduces
    with high light luminous and increases with low luminous. Download : Download

    Fig. 6. Soil moisture observed in the test environment. The developed autonomous
    irrigation system using AI-IoT based 6G network is engaged with the auto mode.
    The module has collected the soil moisture content and climate data using the
    6G enabled IoT server network. Meanwhile, it also the feeds the soil moisture
    and temperature data obtained using the sensor into the server using the 6G enabled
    IoT module. Further, the data is processed by the AI and motor pump is turned
    ON/OFF according to the requirement. Fig. 7 depicts the water irrigation data
    log obtained in percentage of engaging based on the soil moisture content. Form
    the figure it can be observed that the motor pump operates for 0 to 75% based
    on the variation of soil moisture (soil moisture is varied using halogen lamp
    operation in the test environment). The AI process in motor operation can be clearly
    identified in the Fig. 7, when the moisture level lowers 20% the motor pump is
    engaged to water. Using the developed autonomous irrigation system using AI-IoT
    based 6G network the farmers could monitor the water flow level and can also prevent
    over watering. Further, in the investigation the performance evaluation of different
    sensor used in the study has been evaluated. Fig. 8 shows the performance evaluation
    of the different sensor engaged in the analysis. In this analysis, Tensiometer
    sensor, and Solid-state sensor has higher performance with a accurate date precision.

    Abstract Precise estimations of actual evapotranspiration ( ) are essential for

    irrigation 1. Introduction According to the recent global report on water use
    published by UNESCO, irrigation represents about 70% of the global consumption
    of available freshwater (WWDR, 2021). Therefore, adopting sustainable agriculture
    is of paramount importance to minimize water consumption. In this context, pushing
    the agricultural system as a whole toward ecologically sustainable solutions is
    a major challenge given the increasing insufficiency of water availability (Gangopadhyay
    et al., 2023). Recent research suggests that farmers should be encouraged to adopt
    new solutions, particularly in drought-prone regions, in order to optimize both
    water quantity and quality, and ensure less water consumption for a more environmentally
    friendly future for the next generations (Lap et al., 2023). In particular, in
    the Mediterranean ecosystems, which are characterized by dry and hot summers and
    rainfall mainly occurring in fall and winter, it is important to adopt sustainable
    irrigation strategies to increase water use efficiency and preserve water resources.
    The optimization of irrigation water employment in agriculture can be obtained,
    from the one hand, by estimating the exact crop water requirement and, from the
    other, through the application of dynamic irrigation strategies, such as the regulated
    deficit irrigation (RDI). The main goal of these strategies is to save water by
    controlling in real time the field irrigation as a function of the water status
    of soil and plants. This can be quantified by means of heterogeneous sensors and
    data aggregation techniques, in order to identify conditions for reducing the
    water consumption without affecting the crop growth. For example, it has been
    proved that RDI can be applied to citrus orchards during the stage II of crop
    without determining significant impact on crop yield (Castel, 2000, González-Altozano,
    2000, Consoli et al., 2014, Stagno et al., 2015, Rallo et al., 2017, Puig-Sirera
    et al., 2021). However, the application of RDI strategies requires accurate monitoring
    to avoid severe crop water stress which can produce a decline in yield and/or
    irreversible effects on crop growth. From field sensors to water needs. In order
    to monitor the crop water needs in real-time, several data sources for estimating
    the field status can be considered, among which meteorological data, soil water
    contents, drill and drop sensors, satellite images and vegetation indices. Different
    models for studying the soil water balance (SWB) are then applied for mapping
    infield data into a precise estimation of the water needs (Kelley et al., 2019).
    An important parameter for this estimation is the evapotranspiration ( ), which
    is the combination of two distinct processes: water evaporation from the soil
    surface, and water transpiration from the plant canopy, , depending on the climate
    and soil water status (Pereira et al., 2020). Recently, several data-driven models
    (artificial neural networks, K-nearest neighbors, random forest, etc.) have been
    proposed for predicting evapotranspiration even with a limited amount of infield
    sensors, i.e. by working only with some low-cost typologies of sensors or with
    a limited spatial granularity of measurements (Aghajanloo et al., 2013, Granata,
    2019, Walls et al., 2020, Yamaç, 2021). Models are customized not only for different
    climates, but also for different typologies of crops, such as potato crops (Aghajanloo
    et al., 2013, Yamaç et al., 2020, Talib et al., 2021), green pepper crops (Liu
    et al., 2020), or cereal crops (Talib et al., 2021, Tang et al., 2018, Abrishami
    et al., 2019, Han et al., 2021, Hashemi et al., 2020, Elbeltagi et al., 2020).
    The models can be studied in combination with the irrigation policy, for minimizing
    the water consumption, as described in Zhang et al. (2016) for the case of a rice
    crop. However, these works focus on herbaceous crops or horticultures only. Other
    models for estimating the field water needs are based on the study of the surface
    energy balance, by processing land surface temperature (LST) (Reyes Rojas et al.,
    2021). These approaches have been demonstrated in the case of olive and pomegranate
    orchards and vineyards but, to the best of our knowledge, there is no previous
    literature focusing on the definition of models for citrus orchards, despite the
    fact that in the Mediterranean basins citrus is one of the most cultivated crops
    (MAPA, 2019). Citrus orchards have high water requirements (Rallo et al., 2017,
    Hari et al., 2010) and differ significantly from olives and pomegranates crops,
    which are characterized by a high capacity to resist in arid environments (Pierantozzi
    et al., 2013, Volschenk, 2020). Reference, potential and actual evapotranspiration.
    It is important to note that most existing literature employs machine learning
    (ML) models to predict the crop reference evapotranspiration (ETo) or potential
    evapotranspiration ( ), whereas the focus of this paper is on actual evapotranspiration
    ( ), which plays a key role in the quantitative evaluation of the actual crop
    water requirements, necessary for irrigation water management. While values are
    considered in ecosystem studies, for studying wetland conservation (Granata et
    al., 2020) and water cycles (Zhang et al., 2021), the comprehensive reviews of
    evapotranspiration models presented in Krishnashetty et al., 2021, Jing et al.,
    2019 focus on ETo only. In Krishnashetty et al. (2021), which compares several
    papers from 2009 to 2021, the main goal of ETo estimation is developing intelligent
    irrigation systems, while in Jing et al. (2019) it is demonstrated how ETo models
    developed from 2007 to 2019 can be used for a wide climatic range. Despite the
    number of proposed models, several issues for the application of these models
    are still open. In fact, evapotranspiration is a nonlinear and complex phenomenon,
    and its estimation is based on the availability of several climatic and crop parameters
    and their mutual interactions with each other. Consequently, the transition from
    ETo to more significant quantities such is not straightforward. Indeed, while
    ETo can be derived by using only climatic variables, depends on the specific crop,
    as well as on soil and plant conditions. Table 1, Table 2 summarize the main characteristics
    of related works on potential evapotranspiration and actual evapotranspiration
    estimation, respectively, by comparing the approach, crop typology, dataset size,
    number of input features and model accuracy. Table 1. Literature comparison of

    used ML to study only from a generic hydrology or atmospheric point of view, and
    do not consider irrigation strategies like RDI. For example, Izadifar et al. (2010)
    models using ANN and Genetic Programming in a Canadian landscape covered by spontaneous
    vegetation; consequently, the study does not analyze water requirements in a specific
    crop and does not consider possible irrigation strategies. In Hao et al. (2022)
    the authors quantified the impact of some hydrological factors on using Bayesian
    model averaging for forest, cropland, and grassland ecosystems. In addition, it
    was demonstrated that soil moisture does not contribute significantly to in forest
    areas because vegetative transpiration comprises a large portion of . Finally,

    Paper contributions. Taking into account the limitations of current models, the
    aim of this work is defining a data-driven model for predicting actual evapotranspiration
    of a citrus orchard under regulated deficit irrigation. To this purpose, we exploit
    a large dataset of infield measurements collected in a suburb of Palermo, in Italy,
    which includes meteorological data, Vegetation Indices (VIs), soil water contents,
    as well as direct measurements of (to be used as a ground-truth). A variety of
    input combinations are explored, analyzing feature importance and Pearson’s correlation
    coefficient, and studying the performance of several ML models (namely, MLP and
    RF). Interestingly, the presented results show that the accuracy of the proposed
    ML models remains acceptable even reducing the input features down to four. To
    the best of our knowledge, we are the first to estimate in a hot summer Mediterranean
    ecosystem under RDI, with an average water saving of up to 38.5%, compared to
    full irrigation management. These estimation models are fundamental to understand
    and reduce the impact of climate change and water scarcity, thus promoting sustainable
    agricultural irrigation solutions. 2. Background and motivation The application
    of irrigation strategies such as RDI during specific stages of crop growth could
    result in the optimization of irrigation water use in agricultural ecosystems.
    The actual crop water requirement can be assessed, among others approaches, by
    the continuous monitoring of soil water content, as investigated by Lukangu et
    al. (1999), or using soil water balance (SWB) models (Pereira et al., 2020). In
    the former, the quality of the results depends on the accuracy and acquisition
    time of the soil moisture sensors, while the latter requires the accurate estimation
    of actual crop evapotranspiration, . Direct measurements of can be acquired by
    weighing lysimeters (Schrader et al., 2013), which however are characterized by
    high installation and maintenance costs. On the other hand, indirect methods to
    estimate include the widely used dual crop coefficient approach, suggested in
    the FAO-56 paper (Allen et al., 1998), and the application of the surface energy
    balance (SEB), such as the Surface Energy Balance Algorithm for Land (SEBAL) (Bastiaanssen
    et al., 1998), and Two-Source Energy Balance Model (TSEB) (Norman et al., 1995,
    Yao et al., 2010). According to the dual crop coefficient approach (Allen et al.,
    1998) the maximum can be estimated as the product of crop reference evapotranspiration
    and the term , being the basal crop coefficient and the soil evaporation coefficient.
    The coefficients for the different crops and stages of vegetative growth, tabulated
    in the FAO-56 paper (Allen et al., 1998), have been recently updated by Rallo
    et al. (2021) to account for the research published in the last 20 years. ETo
    represents the atmospheric evaporative demand, whose values can be computed based
    on air temperature, solar radiation, wind speed and relative air humidity acquired
    by a standard weather station (Alkaeed et al., 2006). When the soil water content
    is limiting evapotranspiration, it is necessary to include two additional coefficients,
    and , with values ranging between 0 and 1, to reduce crop transpiration and soil
    evaporation, respectively. In a recent review, Pôças et al. (2020) showed the
    possibility to derive the basal crop coefficient, , based on linear and non-linear
    relationships employing, as independent variables, vegetation indices (VIs) derived
    by remote sensing data in the visible and near-infrared domains, whereas earlier,
    Lei and Yang (2014) proposed to estimate based on a linear function of VIs obtained
    in the shortwave region. The SEB models are used to estimate latent heat flux
    (LE) as the residual term of the energy balance equation. The values of LE measured
    by the Eddy Covariance (EC) tower have been largely used to assess . The common
    configuration of EC towers consists of an infrared open-path gas analyzer to measure
    vapor and concentration in the atmosphere, a 3D-sonic anemometer to measure the
    sonic air temperature and the three components of wind speed, a 4-components net
    radiometer to measure the net radiation and a flux plate to measure the soil heat
    flux. Although both the water and energy balance models have been largely used
    to estimate , the first one requires a large number of meteorological variables
    to evaluate ETo (not always available and with acquisition times not enough adequate
    for the purpose (Yamaç et al., 2020)), whereas the second, despite the smaller
    number of required variables, needs the availability of an EC tower equipped with
    quite expensive instruments. Furthermore, the quality and temporal continuity
    of the acquisitions can be influenced by the different measurement conditions
    from the theoretical assumptions, as well as by the malfunction of the instruments
    caused by the meteorological conditions and also by the imperfect calibrations
    of the sensors (Masseroni et al., 2014). The limitations of the classical methods
    described above indicate the need to assess alternative procedures to increase
    the availability and accessibility of measurements. For this reason, ML algorithms
    can be powerful tools for predicting actual evapotranspiration. Only recently,
    researchers applied ML to predict two important quantities, and/or , which are
    of paramount interest for crop irrigation management. Indeed, approximately 90%
    of the papers listed in Table 1, Table 2 have been published within the past four
    years. Specifically, Table 1 provides a summary of the research using ML models
    to estimate potential evapotranspiration ( ), which is considered a good approximation
    of for healthy crops (no diseases) and without water stress. From the table, the
    estimation accuracy, measured in terms of RMSE and , ranges on average from 0.37
    to 0.89 and between 0.75 and 0.96, respectively. Similarly, Table 2 reports papers
    focusing on , with average ranges of RMSE and , from 0.37 to 0.97 and between
    0.55 and 0.86, respectively. However, these results were mostly obtained in forest,
    cropland and grassland ecosystems, characterized by an homogeneous soil cover
    condition. Instead, in this paper we focus on the prediction of in a citrus orchard
    under regulated deficit irrigation, in a Mediterranean ecosystem. To the best
    of our knowledge, we are the first to employ machine learning models to predict
    in tree orchards. 3. Materials and methods 3.1. Description of the study area
    and experimental layout The experiment was carried out for four years (2018–2021)
    in a citrus orchard (Citrus reticulata Blanco, cv. Mandarino Tardivo di Ciaculli)
    located in a suburb of Palermo, Italy (38°4’ 53.4” N, 13° 25’ 8.2” E), as shown
    in Fig. 1. The field extension is about 0.4 ha, with trees planted at a spacing
    of 5.0 5.0 m and an average height of about 2.5 m. The average fraction cover
    is about 0.48. The field is generally irrigated with a subsurface drip system,
    operating from 2018, with two lateral pipes, which contain co-extruded emitters
    discharging 2.3 at a pressure of 100 kPa with a spacing of 1.0 m (i.e.,10 ), per
    plant row, one on each side of the tree, at 1.1 m from the trunks,installed at
    0.30 m depth. However, the old micro-sprinklers irrigation system, operating until
    2017, is occasionally activated mainly before weeding. The regulated deficit irrigation
    (RDI) strategy is described in detail in Ippolito et al. (2022). The climate is
    Mediterranean, with rainfall generally concentrated in fall and winter, and high
    temperatures in summer. According to the recent version of Köppen climatic classification,
    the zone has a hot summer Mediterranean climate (Csa) (Kottek et al., 2006). Fig.
    2 shows the climatic analysis in terms of cumulative precipitation and crop reference
    evapotranspiration, as well as the irrigated water volumes, provided to the field.
    Considering the annual cumulative precipitation, a total of 924 mm was recorded
    in 2018, and only 551 mm and 577 mm in 2019 and 2020. Furthermore, at the end
    of November 2021, the cumulative precipitation was equal to 776 mm. On the other
    hand, the annual crop reference evapotranspiration was 931 mm in 2018, 1069 mm
    in 2019 and 1076 mm in 2020, as a consequence of the relatively higher daily ETo
    values registered in 2019 and 2020. Finally, at the end of November 2021, the
    cumulative crop reference evapotranspiration was equal to 1013 mm. The differences
    in the cumulative values of irrigation were due to the pluviometric deficit (
    ) values at the beginning of the irrigation season, equal to 0 mm in 2018, −84
    mm in 2019, −243 mm in 2020, and −178 mm in 2021. The applied RDI strategy allowed
    an average water saving of about 38.5%, in 2018, 2019 and 2020, compared to the
    full irrigation (FI) management which was followed by the farmer in the rest of
    the field. The extraordinary high temperatures that were reached during the summer
    2021 and the crop conditions before the water stress application period, induced
    the farmer not to apply the RDI strategy in this year. Download : Download high-res

    season. A standard WatchDog 2000 weather station (WS) (Spectrum Technologies,
    Inc., Aurora, IL, USA) is installed near the field (see Fig. 1)) to collect, every
    30 min, the values of air temperature, , global solar radiation, , relative air
    humidity, , wind speed and direction at 2 m height, , and rainfall height, . Since
    March 2019, measurements of actual evapotranspiration, have been acquired by an
    Eddy Covariance (EC) flux tower (Fig. 1). The tower is equipped with a 4-components
    net radiometer (CNR4, Campbell Scientific Inch., Logan, Utah) installed at 3.0
    m height, a three-dimensional sonic anemometer (CSAT3-D, Campbell Scientific Inch.,
    Logan, Utah) and an infrared open patch gas analyzer (Li-7500, Licor bioscience
    inch., Lincoln, Nebraska) to measure, respectively, the net radiation, , with
    a frequency of 30 min, as well as the 3D-components of wind speed and the concentrations
    of vapor and in the atmosphere with a frequency of 20 Hz. All the high and low-frequency
    data are stored in a CR3000 datalogger (Campbell Scientific Inch., Logan, Utah)
    equipped with a 2 GB memory card. Sensible, and latent, heat fluxes were evaluated
    as: (1) (2) where is the air density, is the air specific heat capacity at constant
    pressure, is the covariance between vertical wind speed and air temperature, is
    the latent heat of vaporization and is the covariance between vertical wind speed
    and the water vapour density. To estimate daily crop reference evapotranspiration,
    ETo , the FAO-56 Penman–Monteith (PM) equation (Allen et al., 1998) was used:
    (3) where is the slope of saturation vapour pressure curve, is the net radiation
    at the crop surface, G is the soil heat flux density, is the actual vapour pressure
    deficit, is the psychrometric constant and is the wind speed measured thus at
    2 m height. When considering the single crop coefficient approach, the values
    of can be obtained as: (4) where ETo is the crop reference evapotranspiration,
    is the crop coefficient and is the water stress coefficient. The contribution
    of soil evaporation and crop transpiration is represented by a single accounting
    for the difference between the reference crop and the considered crop in terms
    of biophysical characteristics such as canopy properties, ground cover and aerodynamic
    resistance. The water stress coefficient, , ranging between 0 and 1, is introduced
    as a multiplicative factor to take into account the actual soil water status.
    Based on the irrigation strategy adopted in the field, the value of resulted generally
    equal to 1.0, except during phase II of fruit growth (beginning of July-mid August),
    when as a consequence of the limited water application. The dynamic of soil water
    content (SWC) is monitored by four drill and drop sensors (Sentek Pty Ltd, Stepney,
    Australia) installed 0.8 m far from the tree trunks, which provide the measurements
    up to 0.6 m depth (in steps of 0.1 m), with a time resolution of about 30 min.
    All sensors were interfaced with electronic boards that use license-free communication
    to transmit data to a gateway, which in turn enables Internet connections. The
    connection is used to log in as a client to a TCP/IP server, which decodes packet
    transmission and stores the data in a MySQL database. The Spatio-temporal variability
    of vegetation indices based on reflectance data in the visible (VIS), near infrared
    (NIR) and shortwave infrared region (SWIR) of the electromagnetic spectrum was
    investigated based on the images acquired by Sentinel-2 twin satellites (2A and
    2B), characterized by a temporal resolution of about 5 days. In particular, the
    multi-spectral images (MSI) level 2A provide high-resolution data with spatial
    resolutions of 10 m, 20 m and 60 m, calibrated in reflectance at the bottom of
    the atmosphere (BoA), orthorectified and corrected for the atmospheric effects
    (ESA,https://scihub.copernicus.eu/) (Main-Knorn et al., 2017). The available scenes
    were used to calculate the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) (Rouse
    et al., 1974, Toosi et al., 2022) and the normalized difference water index (NDWI)
    (Gao, 1996) as: (5) (6) where and are the near-infrared, red and shortwave reflectance,
    respectively. The corresponding central wavelength, for Sentinel-2A and -2B satellites,
    are 664.6 nm and 664.9 nm for the red band (B4), 832.8 nm and 832.9 nm for NIR
    (B8), and 1613.7 nm and 1610.4 nm for SWIR (B11). 3.2. Dataset description and
    pre-processing The available database includes weather data recorded by the weather
    station from January 2018 to November 2021, as well as the micro-meteorological
    data acquired by the EC tower from March 2019 to November 2021, in both cases
    registered at sub-hourly time-steps. The former dataset was used to estimate ETo,
    by Eq. (3). The latter dataset was processed, using a specific software developed
    by Manca (2003), excluding all the records acquired in days where the rainfall
    height was higher than 2.5 mm. The suitability of the records acquired by the
    EC tower was assessed based on the energy balance closure quantified by the closure
    ratio, CR, (Prueger et al., 2005), representing the slope of the regression line
    of the turbulent heat fluxes against available energy, evaluated as: (7) where
    LE and H are the latent and sensible heat fluxes, is the net radiation and G is
    the heat flux into the soil. Sub-hourly data was then aggregated at daily time
    steps. However, in March 2020 the COVID-19 pandemic lockdown caused the impossibility
    to visit the field and fix the EC tower, with consequent acquisition failure.
    Moreover, a single daily value of SWC, representative of the entire field, was
    calculated as the average of the available data acquired in the layer 0–0.60 m
    by the four drill and drop probes. Finally, for the four years considered, 251
    images, under clear sky conditions, from Sentinel-2 satellite were downloaded
    and pre-processed using the R library named “sen2r” (Ranghetti et al., 2020).
    Using Eqs. (5), (6), for the whole field the vegetation indices were calculated
    by a specific script implemented in Matlab® R2019b and then exported in QGIS (release
    3.4.3) environment to view the maps of NDVI and NDWI. To determine NDWI at the
    same spatial resolution as NDVI (10 m), the value of a single-pixel reflectance
    in the SWIR domain (20 m) was associated with the four reflectance values corresponding
    to the NIR spatial resolution. For both vegetation indices, a single representative
    value for the entire plot was obtained by averaging the four values calculated
    in the pixels containing the drill and drop probes. Table 3 summarizes the source
    and the size of the available dataset for the four investigated years (2018–2021).

    [–] 44 75 74 58 Overall, the complete dataset has a length of 1430 days and contains
    12 features ( , NDVI, NDWI, DOY, ), where DOY is the Day Of the Year and the actual
    evapotranspiration represents the variable of interest. This feature has 854 missing
    values, and for this reason, the proposed neural network models are exploited
    for predictions and gap-filling. The climate variables and consequently the ETo
    feature have only three missing values in the dataset, while the SWC, and VIs
    features have 56 and 1179 missing values, respectively, over the four years of
    observation. 3.3. Machine learning models This section describes the design and
    implementation of the examined ML models. As a starting point, four models were
    initially tested: Linear Regression (LR), Support Vector Machine (SVR), Random
    Forest (RF), and Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP). From preliminary results, omitted
    here for the sake of brevity, only MPL and RF models were selected for their ability
    to model the nonlinear evapotranspiration phenomena. The models were implemented
    using the scikit-learn library (Pedregosa et al., 2011), an open-source ML library,
    for the python programming language. Furthermore, the code developed in this work
    is released open source to the scientific community (Git Repository, 2023). This
    will allow repeatability and ease future research efforts in the development of
    environmentally sustainable irrigation solutions. In the following, an introduction
    to Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) and RF algorithms is presented, followed
    by the description and validation of the proposed MLP-based and RF predictors.
    3.3.1. ANNs and Multi-Layer Perceptron ANNs are a class of powerful ML tools that
    can be used to solve classification and regression problems. ANNs can be distinguished
    in two types of architectures, depending on the types of connection between neurons.
    In the feedback architectures, the presence of connections between neurons of
    the same layer or between neurons of the previous layer realizes a feedback connection.
    In the feedforward architectures, the connections between the neurons do not allow
    feedback between layers, and the signal is transmitted only to the neurons of
    the next layer. A widely used feedforward ANN is the Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP),
    constituted by one input layer, one or more hidden layers, and a layer of output
    neurons. The neurons are connected to the ones of the next layer with a certain
    weight and, in each neuron, the weighted sum of input variables is transformed
    into an output value through an activation function, defined as: (8) where is
    the weight, is the neuron input, b is the neuron bias, and is the activation function.
    The training of the network is usually done with a backpropagation algorithm,
    which is divided into two phases. In the first phase (forwarding), controlled
    inputs are applied to the network, pushing the activation of the input layer neurons.
    The signal propagates to the next layers, finally reaching the output neurons.
    The error between the desired output and the obtained result is then calculated
    for each neuron. In the second phase (backwarding), the error value is propagated
    backward and the weights of each link are accordingly modified with an optimization
    method, which aims to minimize the output error. Finally, the network “model selection”
    is achieved by choosing a set of hyperparameters (i.e. number of hidden layers,
    number of neurons in each layer, learning rate, solver weight optimization, epoch
    scale, activation functions, etc.) which characterize the architecture of the
    MLP model (Sowmya et al., 2020). The best model is selected comparing the performance
    scores of all possible combinations of hyperparameters. 3.3.2. Random Forest A
    Random Forest is a particular classifier/regressor formed by a set of decision
    trees represented as independent and identically distributed random vectors. This
    technique is part of ensemble learning that has made significant improvements
    in learning accuracy for classification and regression tasks (Breiman, 2001).
    A random subset of the features is chosen at each candidate split during the learning
    process when using random forests, which employ a modified tree learning algorithm
    (Ho, 1998). Each decision tree within the RF is constructed and trained from a
    random subset of the data in the training set. Therefore, the trees do not use
    the complete set, and at each node the best attribute is chosen from a randomly
    selected set of attributes (thus, not necessarily the absolute best attribute).
    For example, given the training dataset , with each element , one can train M
    different trees on different subsets, chosen randomly with replacement, and then
    compute the ensemble average: (9) where is the m’th tree. This technique is named
    bagging, which stands for bootstrap aggregating (Breiman, 1996). The basic idea
    behind bagging is to average models containing errors but approximately unbiased,
    so as to reduce the variance of an estimated forecast function. Decision trees
    are ideal candidates for bagging because they can capture complex interaction
    structures present in the data and, if grown with sufficient depth, have relatively
    low bias. Since decision trees are known to be error-prone, they can benefit in
    important ways from their averaging. In other words, decision trees lower the
    model variance without raising bias and, thus, this bootstrapping method improves
    the model’s performance. Indeed, while single tree predictions are very sensitive
    to noise in the training set, an average of several trees reduces this sensitiveness,
    provided that the trees are uncorrelated. Highly connected trees result from merely
    training several trees on a single training set. Through the use of various training
    sets, bootstrap sampling can de-correlate trees. Thus, randomness is a factor
    that becomes part of the construction of the RFs, and is intended to increase
    their diversity and thus decrease their correlation. In the case of a regression,
    the final result returned by the RF is the average of the numerical result by
    the different decision trees. 3.3.3. Standardization and performance metrics In
    this work, the dataset was standardized to reduce the influence of outliers. All
    features were normalized and scaled so that they have a similar range. In particular,
    a standard score based on the following equation was used: (10) where x is the
    real value of the sample, is the mean of the population, and is the standard deviation.
    Using the standard score all features have a zero mean and a unit variance. The
    model performance was evaluated based on three statistical indicators: coefficient
    of determination ( ), root mean square error (RMSE), and mean bias error (MBE),
    calculated according to the following equations: (11) (12) (13) where represents
    the measured evapotranspiration value of the i-th sample, is the corresponding
    predicted value, and is the mean measured data for a total n observations. 3.3.4.
    Model hyperparameters selection For both MLP and RF predictors, the grid search
    technique was applied to compute the optimum values of hyperparameters. Regarding
    the MLP, the network was implemented with an input layer, 3 hidden layers, and
    an output layer. In the model selection phase, the performance obtained using
    different hyperparameters was compared. Specifically, the following hyperparameters
    were tested: 1. Solvers: Limited-Broyden–Fletcher–Goldfarb–Shanno (L-BFGS), Adam,
    Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) with constant learning rate, SGD with adaptive
    learning rate; 2. Number of neurons in the hidden layers: from 1 to 100; 3. Regularization
    factor “alpha” (L2 penalty): ; 4. Activation function: identity, logistic, tanh,
    ReLU; 5. Learning Rate: constant, invscaling, adaptive. The following configuration
    optimized the performance of the model and was accordingly adopted for analysis:
    Adam solver (Kingma and Ba, 2014), 10 neurons per hidden layer, alpha = , constant
    learning rate, and rectifier activation function, also called Rectified Linear
    Unit (ReLU) activation function, defined as: (14) In the case of the RF, the hyperparameters
    include the number of decision trees in the forest, the maximum depth of the decision
    tree, the number of features considered by each tree when splitting a node, etc.
    This set of hyperparameters was tested using the grid configuration shown below:
    1. Number of decision trees: from 100 to 1000 (in steps of 100); 2. Number of
    features to consider at every split (max features): ; 3. Maximum number of levels
    in decision tree: None, or from 10 to 100 (in steps of 10); 4. Minimum number
    of samples required to split a node (samples split): 2, 5, 10; 5. Minimum number
    of samples required at each leaf node (samples leaf): 1, 2, 4; 6. Method of selecting
    samples for training each tree (bootstrap): True or False; 7. Parameter for minimal
    cost-complexity pruning (cpp alpha): from 0 to 0.06 (in steps of ). The following
    setup was chosen for investigation since it achieved the best prediction accuracy:
    1000 trees, max features = auto, 50 levels, samples split = 2, samples leaf =
    2, bootstrap = True, cpp alpha = 0. Finally, feature analysis was performed to
    test different combinations of the input features among a set of 12 different
    possibilities. Moreover, ML algorithms were also exploited to compensate for missing
    values in the dataset, as detailed in the following Section 3.3.5. 3.3.5. Prediction
    algorithms and gap filling This work exploits ML models also to perform gap-filling
    procedures of missing data. Gaps are present in the VIs because samples are not
    available with the same time resolution of the other variables. Few data samples
    were absent in other input features as well ( , and climate data), as detailed
    in Section 3.2. Thus, for the missing input data described earlier, the KNN-Imputer
    was utilized to fill in missing values using the k-Nearest Neighbor approach (Troyanskaya
    et al., 2001, Thirukumaran and Sumathi, 2012). However, when the number of missing
    values is greater than the number of observed ones (the case of VIs), iterative
    imputation was used (Richman et al., 2009). Note also that the dataset misses
    several measurements, with 542 complete records out of a total number of 1430
    records. Being the output of the proposed data-driven models, the previous approaches
    for filling in the missing data were not used. Nevertheless, MLP and RF models
    were trained only on the sub-set of complete data and the best models can be selected
    as detailed in the next section. Cross-validation was also used to assess models
    reliability and avoid over-fitting. Obviously, the trained models can be used
    for future predictions, as well as for predicting the missing values of the dataset.
    4. Feature analysis and results For the four years of observation, Fig. 3 (a-d)
    presents the temporal dynamics of the daily weather variables acquired by the
    weather station. The annual pattern of daily solar radiation, , is similar across
    the four years, with maximums values generally slightly lower than 30 in summer
    and minimums lower than 10 in winter. The annual dynamic of air temperature, T,
    follows that of , with the maximum ranging between approximately 13 and and minimums
    ranging between 1 and , respectively in winter and summer. The average relative
    air humidity ranged between and , whereas wind speed typically remained lower
    than 2 , even though some daily peaks of about 4 or higher were also recorded.

    of daily air temperature, net radiation and wind speed, as well as the frequency
    of wind direction recorded by the EC tower in 2019 and 2021 are shown in Fig.
    4 (a–d). Compared to the values registered by the weather station, the EC tower
    slightly underestimated the minimum sonic air temperature and slightly overestimated
    the maximum sonic air temperature, mainly in summer when the values consistently
    exceeded . The sonic wind speed was generally higher than the corresponding measurements
    taken by the cup anemometer installed in the weather station, due to the different
    installation heights and to the greater sensitivity of the CSAT3-D sonic anemometer.
    The dominant wind speed resulted in along the direction of (NE). Fig. 5 (a–c)

    energy, , measured by the EC tower in 2019, 2020 and 2021. The slope of the regression
    line, which represents the closure ratio (CR), resulted equal to 0.98 for 2019,
    0.88 for 2020 and 1.03 for 2021, indicating the suitability of the estimated energy
    balance components (Kustas et al., 1999, Er-Raki et al., 2009). Download : Download

    temporal dynamics of daily crop reference evapotranspiration, ETo, actual evapotranspiration,
    , and precipitation, P, are depicted in Fig. 6. The annual dynamic of ETo follows
    that of air temperature and global solar radiation, with annual values ranging
    between about 1 in winter and 6 in summer; the peak of 8.8 registered on May 14,
    2020, was due to the simultaneous occurrence of high air temperature, relatively
    low minimum relative air humidity and high wind speed. The values of in the considered
    period were generally lower than daily ETo, although they resulted occasionally
    higher during or immediately after rainy days, as a consequence of the relatively
    greater contribution of evaporation from soil and/or leaf surface. For this reason,
    the values of recorded on days characterized by rainfall heights higher than 2.5
    mm were not included for further analysis. Download : Download high-res image

    obtained by averaging the values acquired by the four probes from the soil surface
    up to 0.6 m depth. The bottom of Fig. 7 also shows the daily SWC profile. As can
    be observed, for the four years considered, the average SWC ranged from 0.18 to
    0.34 . The temporal dynamic of SWC is affected by the occurrence of rain events
    which determines the rapid increase of soil water contents. However, the rise
    of SWC observed in February, May and June 2020 was associated with wetting events
    of the upper soil surface operated by the micro-sprinklers irrigation system after
    long drought periods. The standard deviation associated with daily SWC in February,
    May and June 2020 as well as in April, May and June 2021 ranged between 0.01 and
    0.08 , with the relatively higher values obtained during the irrigation seasons
    (from mid of May to the end of September), when the values of SWC at 30–50 cm
    depths resulted considerably higher than those of the upper soil layers, not wetted
    by the subsurface drip irrigation system. Download : Download high-res image (565KB)

    quite similar patterns. The values of NDVI ranged from 0.40 to 0.90, while the
    values of NDWI resulted variable between 0.01 and 0.60. Both VIs resulted maximum
    in winter and minimum during summer , with quite low standard deviations as a
    consequence of the limited variability in the spectral response of the field surface.

    between input and output features, a preliminary feature analysis was performed.
    Indeed, this analysis plays a key role in reducing the dimensionality of the problem
    by favoring the application of ML models with a limited number of features, reducing
    the complexity, implementation and deployment costs in the field. For example,
    the matrix in Fig. 9 shows at a glance the relationship between each two features:
    the scatter plot at row n and column m shows the n-th feature as a function of
    the m-th feature. This is helpful to spot correlations in the dataset, since the
    more sparse are points in a plot, the more uncorrelated are the two corresponding
    features. In particular, it is clear that ETo and have a higher correlation with
    than other features. Finally, the plots in the diagonal represent the kernel density
    estimation of each feature, which is an estimate of their probability density
    function. Download : Download high-res image (532KB) Download : Download full-size

    the linear correlation of each couple of features. It ranges between 1 (dark red)
    and −1 (dark blue), were darker colors indicate higher absolute values, i.e. the
    two features are strongly correlated (the sign of the coefficient reflects the
    slope of the linear relation). In this case, the actual evapotranspiration has
    a positive Pearson correlation coefficient with the following features: , with
    a value of 0.8, 0.78, 0.59, 0.38, respectively. On the other hand, the features

    scores (FIS) of each variable in the dataset for the prediction of . The higher
    the FIS, the more important the feature. The importance of a feature is computed
    as the (normalized) total reduction of the criterion brought by that feature and
    is also known as the Gini importance (Ravindran et al., 2021). In this work, FIS
    is computed using the Gradient Boosting Regressor (Kadiyala and Kumar, 2018).
    Among all features in the dataset, the three most important ones are , and , with
    a FIS of 0.577, 0.197, and 0.078, respectively. Note that this result includes
    the reference evapotranspiration ETo in the input feature analysis. However, since
    ETo is a climate dependent parameter calculated from other measured climate variables,
    it is interesting to investigate how FIS changes when ETo is excluded from the
    dataset. Indeed, from Fig. 11(b), it is clear that excluding ETo from the dataset
    sharply increases the FIS of from 0.078 to 0.556 compared to the previous feature
    analysis. In this case, the most important features become , and DOY. Download

    and results Based on the feature analysis, it was possible to choose the features
    contained in the entire dataset or eliminate some less relevant features that
    could compromise the generalization of the model, focusing the attention to the
    most relevant ones. More into details, Table 4 shows the input feature combinations
    used to implement the developed models. In particular, for both MLP and RF, combination
    1 contains all available features except ETo. From combination 2 to 7 other features
    with less importance are gradually removed, while combination 8 uses only the
    variables measured by the weather station. Finally, combinations 9 and 10 do not
    use the weather variables, but consider the ETo feature instead, and combinations
    11 and 12 are the same of models 9 and 10, except that ETo is substituted by ,

    1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 The results obtained by the different models in terms
    of RMSE, , and MBE are detailed in Table 5. Specifically, the table shows that
    both the MLP and RF models perform well, although generally, RF performed better
    than MLP independently of the input features considered in the model. In particular,
    the Multi-Layer Perceptron method showed that models MLP1 and MLP5 were the best
    choices for estimation, with the lowest RMSE (0.44 ) and highest (0.82) score
    compared to the other input feature combinations. On the other hand, the best
    scores for the Random Forest predictor are obtained with models RF2, RF3 and RF4,
    showing an RMSE of 0.39 and an of 0.84. Moreover, low MBE values indicate that
    predictions do not deviate much from the corresponding measured values (for all
    scenarios examined, MBE was between −0.025 and 0.041 ). Note that, in some cases,
    a reduction in the number of feature produces equal or even better performances
    than models including all available features. For example, in the case of the
    MLP predictor, MLP1 and MLP5 show the same performance, but MLP1 used all the
    ten features available while MLP5 used only six features (the four less important
    features were removed, i.e. ). Similarly, for the RF predictor, performance improved
    after removing features , and NDVI (i.e. moving from RF1 to RF4). Finally, the
    RF predictor is also consistent with the reduction of input features: for example,
    in RF6 and RF11, i.e. using only five features, the RF predictor shows very good
    scores ( and , close to the best ones), where RF6 used the first five features
    with the highest feature importance score ( ), while RF11 used only weather variable
    and features . Indeed, from Table 5 it is clear that the joint use of SWC, NDVI,
    NDWI, and DOY features with ETo (MLP9 or RF9) improves the performance of predictions
    compared to models using only weather variables (MLP8 or RF8). Table 5. Results

    models was explored by analyzing the violin plots shown in Fig. 12. These plots
    show the relative error distributions of all MLP and RF models during irrigation
    seasons. In the middle of each violin plot, there is a small box plot, with the
    rectangle representing the ends of the first and third quartiles, and a central
    white dot for the median. The concentration of the relative error is close to
    zero, highlighting the good performance of the analyzed models. In particular,
    Fig. 12(a) shows that the errors of most MLP models (MLP1 to MLP11) have a median
    greater than zero (in the range ), which means that these models slightly overestimated
    the values. Only the MLP12 model had a median error below zero (-0.031%). Fig.
    12(b), instead, shows that most of the RF models (9 out of 12) slightly underestimated
    the values, with a negative median error (the worst case was RF12, with −0.019%).
    On the other hand, RF7, RF10, and RF11 had a median above zero (0.004%, 0.044%,
    and 0.030%, respectively), therefore overestimating . Finally, the violin plots
    show that using features set 9 and 10 both MLP and RF had a longer upper tails,
    indicating that in some occasions these models provided larger overestimates.
    In addition, the relative error distribution was asymmetrical (positive skew)
    for most of the considered models. As expected, the RF models had a median error
    closer to zero, compared to MLP models. Download : Download high-res image (369KB)

    values when . On the other hand, a slight overestimation is present for . This
    behavior based on the values to be predicted was also noted by Granata et al.
    (2020). Overall, the slope of the regression line for MLP models ranges between
    0.951 and 1.031, while, for RF models, the slope varies between 0.941 and 1.005,
    which means that the latter have slightly less variance than the former. The slope
    closest to 1.0 for MLP were observed for the models MLP2 (Fig. 13(b)), MLP7 (Fig.

    and 1.003 respectively. On the other hand, the best slopes of RF models had values
    of 1.006, 0.992, and 1.005, for RF1 (Fig. 14(a)), RF4 (Fig. 14(d)), and RF9 (Fig.

    results presented in this work suggest that in general both the MLP and RF models
    were able to accurately describe the nonlinear relationships between weather and
    crop parameters, providing accurate predictions of under regulated deficit irrigation.
    These ML models could be used to optimize irrigation strategies according to the
    availability of water resources as well as to adopt RDI strategies, saving up
    to 38.5%, compared to full irrigation management. Therefore, this work offers
    a contribution to the creation of a sustainable agricultural environment, according
    to recent work in Gangopadhyay et al. (2023). Moreover, since direct measurements
    of the actual values of (e.g. by means of EC towers) can be expensive and complex,
    in this work we use these values only for training a field-specific data model.
    Then, the models are used to provide a prediction of for the examined ecosystem
    based on low-cost sensor data only, with little impact on estimation accuracy.
    The results obtained by the models used in this work are summarized in the last
    row of Table 2. Indeed, the results were generally consistent with the performance
    of previous studies in the literature when taking into account the average ranges
    of RMSE and ([0.37, 0.97] and , respectively), while the performance of the proposed
    models varied between 0.39 and 0.57 for RMSE and between 0.69 and 0.84 for . Furthermore,
    many of the papers listed in Table 2 estimate in forest, cropland and grassland
    ecosystems, characterized by a homogeneous soil cover condition. However, in these
    scenarios, is rarely affected by the evaporative processes from the soil (Yao
    et al., 2010, Hao et al., 2022). Recently the possibility to estimate in tree
    crops, through ML models, was assessed by Reyes Rojas et al. (2021), using LST
    as input with a spatial resolution of 10 m, obtained from the downscaling of Landsat-8
    LST data, by means of two different models (cubist and RF). In particular, the
    authors estimated through the Operational Simplified Surface Energy Balance Model
    (SSEBop) of olives and pomegranates tree crops, obtaining results slightly worse
    than the ones presented in this paper. However, it is important to highlight that
    the predictions presented in Reyes Rojas et al. (2021) are derived from the application
    of the SSEBop model and not from an ML model trained using in situ measurements.
    Furthermore, the olives and pomegranates crops are characterized by a high capacity
    to resist arid environments (Pierantozzi et al., 2013, Volschenk, 2020), while
    citrus orchards are characterized by higher water requirements (Rallo et al.,
    2017). In this sense, it is possible to affirm that this work represents the first
    attempt to exploit ML models to predict in a tree crop under RDI, where nonlinear
    processes, such as transpiration from the canopy and evaporation from the soil,
    must be taken into account. It is important to note that the results obtained
    in this work are best when the SWC feature is included in the input variables.
    Indeed, from the results shown in Table 5 and the feature importance analysis
    (Fig. 11(a) and (b)), it is clear that SWC has a significant impact on the prediction.
    This evidence is supported by other studies in the literature showing that soil
    moisture becomes a significant factor for modeling when soil water supply is insufficient
    (Wang and Liang, 2008, Mosre et al., 2021, Wang et al., 2022, Granata, 2019).
    Moreover, other works in ecological fields (Girardello et al., 2010, Srinet et
    al., 2019, Piccioni et al., 2022) confirmed that RF models are able to capture
    nonlinear dependencies among different variables, supporting the results presented
    in Table 5 and Fig. 12, in which the RF models appear to best predict the nonlinear
    phenomena of . Finally, other hydrological features such as precipitation (P)
    and irrigation (I) were also considered as inputs to our ML models. However, these
    variables were eventually excluded for the following reasons. First, precipitation
    values are localized measurements and could limit the possibility of generalizing
    the obtained ML models, as discussed in Mosre et al., 2021, Han et al., 2021.
    Second, in presence of subsurface drip irrigation systems, irrigation times are
    weakly correlated with the measurements (the obtained Pearson correlation and
    feature importance score were 0.150 and 0.003, respectively). This can be due
    to both negligible soil surface moisture during the irrigation season and failure
    to capture flows through the root zone, as explained for example in Talib et al.
    (2021). Note that, the two variables P and I are indirectly contained in the SWC
    feature used in our models. In particular, the SWC values were averaged considering
    four different positions in the field and six different measurement depths, from
    the surface down to 0.6 m depth. These measurements are thus more accurate for
    modeling under deficit irrigation. 6. Conclusions This work explored the possibility
    of using ML models for accurately predicting actual evapotranspiration values
    in Mediterranean citrus orchards, where an RDI strategy is applied. Evapotranspiration
    data is very relevant to increase the ecosystems resilience, including the sustainability
    of the irrigation process. Different choices are possible for retrieving this
    data: deploying the instrumentation devised to perform direct measurements of
    (e.g. EC towers) or using this instrumentation only temporarily for training a
    field-specific data model, which will be able to provide an indirect estimation
    of for the examined ecosystem, based on sensors data only. Since measuring the
    actual values by means of EC towers can be expensive and complex, the objective
    of this research was to assess the second choice and study the impact of different
    features and ML approaches (namely, MLP and RF) on estimation accuracy. To identify
    the most relevant input data, an in-depth analysis of feature importance and correlation
    was performed on a dataset based on extensive in-field measurements collected
    in a suburb of Palermo, in Italy. The dataset includes meteorological data, vegetation
    indices, soil water contents, as well as direct measurements of (to be used as
    a ground-truth), acquired respectively by means of a weather station, satellite
    images, drill and drop sensors, and an EC tower. The results obtained are promising:
    data-driven models can achieve an accuracy higher than 82% for predicting values,
    especially in the case of RF models. Moreover, reducing the number of input features
    from 10 to 5 does not harm the prediction accuracy significantly, thus enabling
    the possibility of opportunistically selecting in-field sensors. In general, the
    experiments demonstrated that is better predicted with agro-meteorological data
    of high importance ( ) combined with vegetation indices, compared to models using
    weather variables only (i.e. ). Indeed, both soil water content and solar radiation
    were significant factors to predict accurately. Results show that the prediction
    of in a tree crop under RDI strategy, allows an average water saving up to 38.5%,
    compared to full irrigation, reducing the impact of climate change and water scarcity
    in the global environmental equilibrium. Furthermore, the approaches proposed
    in this study, extended to different crops and climate conditions, can be a useful
    solution to improve the estimation of effective crop water requirements, with
    the aim to choose the best irrigation strategies for sustainable water management
    of productive ecosystems. In this context, the availability of continuous daily
    actual evapotranspiration time series is essential to implement, at local and
    regional scale, agro-hydrological models to support policy decisions and to better
    optimize agricultural practices. Declaration of Competing Interest The authors

    and plant feedback 1. Introduction Irrigation can be vital to food production
    systems and economies, especially in arid or semi-arid climate regions. Limited
    freshwater resources can fail to match water demand, therefore efficient scheduling
    methods are desirable to maximize crop yields under limited water supply [[1],
    [2], [3], [4]]. Water use efficiency in intensively irrigated areas can be improved
    by using irrigation schedulers which can link physical interactions between air,
    soil, and plant as a continuum [5,3,6]. However, producers often opt for scheduling
    tools in their decisions if they are cheap to use, flexible for variable conditions,
    and most importantly can provide near real-time crop water requirement and/or
    water stress information [7,8,9,10]. For most irrigation scheduling tools such
    as soil water balance models, process based agricultural models, and soil and
    plant sensors [1], they require local soil, crop, and climate data [11]. Even
    though localized and in-field methods especially soil and plant sensors are less
    prone to errors, they still require deployment and maintenance which can be expensive
    [1,12]. Additionally, majority of methods are limited on spatial and temporal
    resolutions [13,14,5]. Hence, producers require user-friendly and well-designed
    Irrigation Decision Support Systems (IDSS) to inform and potentially automate
    their irrigation scheduling decisions in real-time. Use of infrared thermometry
    in IDSS has had increased interest due to being non-destructive and scalable to
    larger fields [[15], [16], [17]]. Infrared thermometry is commonly used to monitor
    water stress with crop water stress index (CWSI) [[2], [5], [18], [19], [20],
    [21]] but has also been extended for estimation of crop evapotranspiration (ETc)
    [22,23]. However, application of thermometry scheduled-based decision on producer
    fields might be a challenge due to high costs of sensors, need for programming
    and wiring dataloggers, and data quality issues. Moreover, the collection of canopy
    temperature (Tc) is restricted to only a particular time of the day (i.e., mid-day
    hours) [21] and CWSI baselines are not transferable to regions of different climates
    [21]. Based on those reasons, Payero[4] and Irmak [21] suggested the use of multiple
    linear regressions to develop lower or non-stressed baselines of corn and soybeans
    to ease the computation of CWSI in irrigation management regardless of locality.
    However, use of climatic variables and plant growth parameters to model CWSI can
    be more complex if there are non-linear relationships and this might require robust
    models for better predictions [5,18]. Kumar et al. [5] mentioned that it was worthwhile
    to consider algorithms which eliminates developing baselines to normalize Tc to
    micro-climatic conditions or even avoiding Tc measurements at specified mid-day
    hours such that CWSI is promoted in irrigation scheduling [5]. On the other hand,
    methods which are deemed accurate like ETc, or soil moisture-based methods have
    had limited adoption by producers. A contributing factor is that they require
    high quality and locally relevant data. Availability of weather stations, along
    with knowledge or access to a specialist who has knowledge on how to interpret
    data into an irrigation decision is still a major barrier to adoption of ETc based
    irrigation models [24,25,26]. Therefore, soliciting other simple but robust models
    which can automatically forecast/estimate ETc can be valuable in automated irrigation
    scheduling tools. There is opportunity of using artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms
    for irrigation scheduling; however, the dataset should include relevant factors
    such as weather conditions as well as plant and soil water status for accurate
    decisions [1]. Previous work has focused on employing algorithms to schedule irrigation
    through estimation of available soil moisture in the rooting zone [11,1,27]. In
    the past, AI techniques were extensively employed in predicting reference or crop
    ET [28,29,30,25,31], but recently they have been used in CWSI estimation [2,5]
    for use in automated scheduling tools. For instance, feed-forward back propagation
    neural network/artificial neural network (ANN) has been used to estimate reference
    ET [28,32] and CWSI in Indian mustard crop [5] as well as well-watered Tc to develop
    lower baselines in sugar beets and wine grapes [2]. Furthermore, machine learning
    (ML) models such as random forest (RF), support vector machines (SVM), and K-Nearest
    Neighbors (KNN), among others, have also estimated ETc in crops such as sugar
    beets [25], maize [33], garlic [34], wheat [33], and potatoes [31]; however, none
    has been used as an option for supporting irrigation scheduling except RF and
    SVM [35]. Interestingly, neural network (NN) models such as Long-Short Term Memory
    (LSTM) and Artificial Neural Network (ANN) have now been utilized to monitor soil
    moisture content in the rooting zone to support irrigation scheduling [1] using
    datasets generated from calibrated process-based agricultural models such as Root
    Zone Water Quality Model (RZWQM2) [1] and AQUACROP model [[11], [36]]. Therefore,
    calibrated process-based agricultural models can be used to generate those datasets
    for model training [11,1]. A study done by [27] used ANN to predict soil moisture
    changes using daily weather in addition to fuzzy NN which determined irrigation
    time and watering volume. The advantage with AI models is that they can easily
    identify associations between input and response variables without much inputs
    from the modeler as it is with traditional process-based models [37]. Also, ML
    models can be combined through ensembling to improve their prediction performance
    and accuracy [38]. Exploring the use of AI models for predicting crop evapotranspiration
    (ETc) and crop water stress index (CWSI) will provide more opportunities of using
    such models in designing of Irrigation Decision Support Systems (IDSS). As seen
    already, NN models can schedule irrigation events through estimating soil water
    deficit [11,1], however, to our knowledge no study has considered the use of other
    ML models as well as their ensembles. Also, it is necessary to conduct optimization
    of irrigation scheduling which has received limited attention by developing intelligent
    irrigation models to ensure improved water use efficiency and water savings [27].
    Hence, the objective of this study was to evaluate the performance accuracy of
    different AI algorithms as well as their ensembles in predicting ETc and CWSI,
    using a set of different input combinations containing weather, soil moisture,
    and ancillary parameters such as normalized vegetation index (NDVI), reference
    evapotranspiration (ETr), and cumulative growing degree days (CGDDs) collected
    in two maize growing seasons of 2020 and 2021. 2. Materials and methods 2.1. Study

    a semi-arid climate with 80% of annual precipitation received between late-April
    and mid-October [4]. The predominant soil type at the site is Cozad silt loam
    [39]. Designed experiment was a randomized complete block design (RCBD) with four
    replications organized in four blocks (A, B, C, and D) belonging to various irrigation
    treatments for a long-term irrigation trend study (unpublished). However, due
    to limited availability of soil moisture and canopy temperature sensors, only
    three treatments were selected for the current study: full irrigation, deficit
    irrigation (60% of full irrigation amount), and rainfed treatments. Each plot
    had dimensions of 9.1 m by 72.2 m and the plots were situated over a subsurface
    drip irrigation system with drip lines spaced at 1.52 m (every other crop row)
    and installed at 0.4 m depth. Each plot had twelve maize rows of hybrid Pioneer
    1197AMT (Corteva, Agiscience, Willington, Delaware, USA) planted on April 29 in
    2020 and May 7 in 2021 at a population of 84,000 seeds ha−1 with a row spacing
    of 0.76 m. Pre-season nitrogen in the form of urea ammonium nitrate (UAN 32-0-0)
    was applied uniformly on April 12 for 2020 and April 23 for 2021 at a rate of
    67 kg ha−1 with a double coulter applicator at a depth of 0.03 m and at 0.19 m
    from the center of the crop row on both sides. Furthermore, in-season N of 126
    kg ha−1 was applied at five-leaf stage close to the crop row and at the soil surface
    using a 360 Y-DROP system (360 Yield Center, Morton, Illinois, USA). Irrigation
    events were scheduled up to twice per week by monitoring changes in soil water
    storage (or depletion) using a neutron moisture meter (NMM) – CPN 503 Elite Hydroprobe
    (InstroTek, Concord, California, USA). Irrigation was triggered once depletion
    exceeded 50% of the maximum allowable depletion (MAD) in the managed root zone
    assumed as 0.9 m. Daily climate data on a 1-min timestep was collected from the
    onsite Nebraska Climate Office weather station under Nebraska Mesonet (https://mesonet.unl.edu/)
    located within 100 m from the study site. Weather variables collected included
    minimum, maximum and mean air temperatures (Tmin, Tmax, and Ta (°C)), relative
    humidity (RH (%)), wind speed (u3 (m s−1)), and shortwave incoming solar radiation
    (Rs (W m−2)). All variables were measured at 2 m, except for wind speed which
    was measured at 3 m and adjusted to 2 m following Allen et al. [40]. Likewise,
    vapor pressure deficit (VPD (kPa)) was computed following Allen et al. [40]. Arable
    Mark 2 sensors (Arable Labs Inc., San Francisco, CA) were used to collect both
    hourly and daily micro-climate data in the installed plots as well as daily Normalized
    Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI). Soil volumetric water content (m3 m−3) was
    measured continuously using capacitance sensors (TEROS 12 sensors, Meter Group,
    Pullman, WA) and weekly using neutron moisture meters (NMMs) (InstroTek, Concord,
    California, USA). The first three shallow depths of 0.3, 0.6, and 0.9 m were monitored
    using the TEROS 12 capacitance sensors whereas the deeper depths of 1.2, 1.8,
    and 2.1 m were monitored using NMMs – CPN 503 Elite Hydroprobe and CPN 503DR.
    All sensors were calibrated to local conditions before measurements were taken.
    Soil moisture content at deeper depths for days without NMM readings were estimated
    using a daily soil water balance model [40]. TEROS sensor readings were calibrated
    to NMM using a developed calibration equation ( [41]. Furthermore, daily, and
    continuous canopy temperatures (Tc) were measured every 1 min using infrared thermometers
    (IRTs) (Apogee Instruments, Logan, Utah, USA) then stored on CR1000X dataloggers
    (Campbell Scientific, Logan, Utah, USA) from three replications of each selected
    treatment. IRT sensors were calibrated by the manufacturer and installed near
    full canopy closure on June 17 for both 2020 and 2021. 2.2. ETc and CWSI calculations
    Crop evapotranspiration (ETc) was computed following FAO56 by Allen et al. [40]
    while using a single crop coefficient approach - a product of crop coefficient
    (Kc) and tall crop (i.e., alfalfa) reference evapotranspiration (ETr) (i.e., ETc
    = Kc × ETr). Modified Penman-Monteith equation [42] was employed to compute ETr
    using daily weather parameters as inputs including Tmin and Tmax, RHmin and RHmax,
    u2, and Rs. Daily Kc values were determined by using cumulative growing degree
    days (CGDDs (°C), based on maximum and base Ta of 28- and 10 °C, respectively)
    to interpolate weekly Kc values determined as ratio of weekly ETc calculated using
    a soil water balance model (Eq. (1)) and measured NMM soil moisture content [43,44].
    Since both years were dry, runoff (RO) and deep percolation (DP) were assumed
    to be equal to zero as well as the capillary rise (U) given the depth to the water
    table exceeding the rooting zone. (1) where ETc (mm) is crop evapotranspiration,
    P is precipitation (mm), I is irrigation (mm), and (mm) is change in soil water
    storage measured using NMMs. Crop water stress index (CWSI) was computed following
    Jackson''s theoretical approach [45,46] at mid-day hours starting from 1200 to
    1600 Central Day Time (CDT) (i.e., 4-hr period from solar noon). Upper limit of
    (Tc – Ta) was calculated with Eq. (2a) after assuming potential canopy resistance
    to increase to infinity or without bound (i.e., rcp =  ), and lower limit (Eq.
    (2c)) was calculated after assuming potential canopy resistance to be equal to
    zero (i.e., rcp = 0) [45,46]. Aerodynamic resistance was computed using Eq. (2d).
    All the computed limits were used in Eq. (2e) to compute CWSI. (2a) where (Tc
    – Ta)U (°C) is the upper limit, (kg m−3) is air density, Cp (J kg−1C−1) is heat
    capacity of air, ra (s m−1) is aerodynamic resistance, G (W m−2) is soil heat
    flux assumed to be 10% of Rn [47], and Rn (W m−2) is net radiation computed based
    on Stefan-Boltzmann relationship following Ortega-Farias et al. [48] and Ben-Gal
    et al. [49] as shown in Eq. (2b). (2b) where Rs (W m−2) is the incoming solar
    radiation, α (0.23 (unitless)) is the surface albedo, (5.67 × 10−8 W m−2 K) is
    Stefan-Boltzmann constant, (s m−1) is hemispherical longwave atmospheric emissivity
    calculated following Colaizzi et al. [50], and (0.98 (unitless)) is canopy surface
    emissivity [43]. (2c) where (Tc – Ta)L (°C) are upper and lower limits, (Pa °C−1)
    is psychrometric constant, rcp (s m−1) is canopy resistance at full canopy transpiration,
    and (Pa °C−1) is the slope of the saturated vapor pressure. (2d) where ra (s m−1)
    is the aerodynamic resistance, z (m) is the reference measurement height, d (m)
    is the displacement height (d = 0.63 h), h (m) is the canopy height, zo (m) is
    the roughness length (zo = 0.13 h), and u2 (m s−1) is the wind speed at height
    z = 2 m. (2e) where (Tc –Ta)a, (Tc – Ta)U (°C) and (Tc – Ta)L (°C) are differential
    temperature between measured canopy temperature (Tc, °C) and air temperature (Ta,
    °C), upper and lower limits, respectively. 2.3. Artificial intelligence algorithms
    Several machine learning (ML) algorithms were evaluated (Fig. 1) to determine
    the best performing model for ETc and CWSI predictions. The models used included
    Neural Networks (Artificial Neural Network (ANN), Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)),
    decision-tree based (Random Forest (RF), Categorical Boosting (CatBoost)), Support
    Vector Machines (SVM), K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Multiple Linear regression (MLR),
    and the ensembles of machine learning models. Three ensembles were considered
    which were stacked random forest (Stacked-RF), stacked regression (Stacked-Regr),
    and weighted average of RF, SVM, KNN, CatBoost, and linear regression (Weighted
    Ensemble). Download : Download high-res image (885KB) Download : Download full-size
    image Fig. 1. Artificial Intelligence algorithms evaluated for Crop Evapotranspiration
    (ETc) and Crop Water Stress Index (CWSI) predictions. 2.3.1. Artificial neural
    network (ANN) Artificial Neural Network is one of the first AI algorithm and Neural
    Network used in different agricultural applications [2,5,25]. As shown in Fig.
    1, it has an input layer, hidden layer(s), and output layer. Generally, the data
    manipulation and learning of data patterns occurs in hidden layers as weighted
    connections of neurons [25]. Each hidden layer contains array of artificial neurons
    and each of those neurons are inter-connected to both the previous and next hidden
    layer. 2.3.2. Long short-term memory (LSTM) The LSTM is one of the Recurrent Neural
    Networks (RNN) and it was developed after realizing the shortcoming of ANN, including
    suffering from vanishing gradient. Basically, it has self-feedback of neurons
    in hidden layers (Fig. 1) which provides the network memory to learn from an entire
    sequence from the portions of the overall sequence (i.e., operates as a dynamic
    system) [11]. The Neural Network has three inputs which are the input of the current
    time step (xt), the output from the previous LSTM unit (ht-1), and the “memory”
    of the previous unit (Ct-1). According to Talib et al. [51], the former is the
    most important input and the main model predictors being the sequence of inputs
    from pervious cells or units. Each LSTM cell or unit generates a new output based
    on current input, previous output, and previous memory. Additionally, it can regulate
    the error flow in the network by learning how to open or close specialized gates
    in the network [11]. 2.3.3. Random forest (RF) Random Forest is one of the supervised
    ensembles used for solving regression and classification problems. However, for
    this study, it was used to solve regression problems in predicting ETc and CWSI.
    This model is an ensemble of different trees designed in such a way that the variability
    of the output can be explained by grouping data in homogeneous sets [51]. The
    training samples are selected randomly to create independent decision trees (i.e.,
    Trees 1, 2, 3 in Fig. 1), where each tree makes a prediction (i.e., k1 to k3),
    and then they are averaged to get a final prediction (k) of the regression problem.
    With RF, high dimensional data can be handled as well as strong non-linear problems
    thus avoiding overfitting [25] since it can reduce error bias by using vote selection
    [26]. 2.3.4. Support vector machines (SVM) The SVM is also a supervised method
    and can solve regression prediction problems by identifying complex non-linearity
    of the input variables. It is a representation of different classes in hyperplane
    in a multidimensional space as illustrated in Fig. 1. The goal is to divide the
    datasets into classes to find a maximum marginal hyperplane. Linear and non-linear
    SVM can be used to separate data by use of hyperplane or kernels, respectively.
    Kernels convert non-separable problems into separable problems by adding more
    dimensions to the data. Kernel functions include polynomial, linear, sigmoid,
    and radial basis function (rbf) which transform low-dimension input space into
    high dimension. 2.3.5. K-Nearest neighbor (KNN) The ML model termed as KNN is
    a supervised and lazy learning algorithm that requires no information on the primary
    features to set the unknown sample to the k nearest samples. Thus, it is non-parametric
    and depends on irrelevant and redundant features [31]. It is a simple method and
    effective when used and categorizes a new coming sample by using one identified
    sample which is neighboring this new coming sample. The model uses Euclidean distance
    metric to perform the aforementioned task [25]. The method is easy to employ and
    also effective to use. 2.3.6. Categorical boosting (CatBoost) Categorical Boosting
    (CatBoost) in Fig. 1 operates by using a gradient boosting decision tree (GBDT)
    and combines multiple categorical features with their combinations in the current
    tree in a very rigorous and greedy way. A greedy way is used when the tree constructs
    a new split where subsequent splits contain all combinations and classification
    features in the current tree of the dataset with all categorical features [52].
    It generates weaker learners in each iteration and each learner is trained due
    to the gradient of the previous learner and this avoids the gradient bias. Eventually
    balanced trees with less chances of overfitting are used as base predictors. More
    information about CatBoost can be found in Zhang et al. [26]. 2.3.7. Ensembling
    of machine learning models Ensembling can be done by either stacking more than
    two models or finding the average or weighted average of the prediction of each
    independent model. Model stacking involves combining the base learners (i.e.,
    first layer-level 0) whose out-of-bag predictions are used as inputs to final
    predicting or meta-model (i.e., second layer-level 1) [37]. Level 0 is the base
    layer with its inputs being the initial training set and Level 1 is trained using
    the output data from level 0 as the input to obtain the final prediction results.
    Stacking produces a strong learner from poor performing models [53]. For this
    study, three models were created by ensembling, including Stacked Regression,
    Stacked Random Forest, and weighted average ensemble. Stacked Regression had base
    models such as RF, SVM, KNN, and CatBoost, whereas the final prediction model
    being the linear regression. Stacked Random Forest used other models as base models
    and meta-model as RF. Lastly, weighted average ensemble averaged all the model
    prediction as final model output assuming all models had equal weights and contribution
    was the same. In simple terms, the output of each model contributes to the final
    prediction and the predictions from multiple models (i.e., model 1-K), where the
    contribution of each model is weighted proportionally to its prediction accuracy
    or skill [37]. Generally, a weighted average involves first assigning a fixed
    weight coefficient to each model. 2.3.8. Multiple linear regression (MLR) The
    MLR is one of the traditional mathematical models as given in Eq. (3) and part
    of the machine learning models. It describes quantitative relationships between
    a response variable and one or more explanatory variables. The linear regression
    predicts a quantitative response based on multiple predictor variables as a function
    of non-linear combination of the model parameters with more than one independent
    variable(s) [54]. (3) where Y is the dependent variable, are coefficients of the
    independent variables (X1 – Xn). 2.4. Model evaluation to identify best models
    Evaluation of the models for predicting ETc and CWSI was done following steps
    as summarized in Fig. 2. The first step involved creating the dataset using variables
    including weather, soil water content and ancillary variables such as NDVI, ETr,
    and CGDDs (Table 1). Next steps included creating both training and testing data
    sets, then lastly ETc and CWSI predictions with different machine learning models
    and their ensembles as illustrated in Fig. 2. Download : Download high-res image

    steps for prediction of crop evapotranspiration (ETc) and crop water stress index

    Forest (RF), Support Vector Machines (SVM), K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Categorical
    Boosting decision tree (CatBoost), as well as Multiple Linear Regression (MLR)
    as the only traditional mathematical model. Machine learning ensembles were Stacked
    Regression, Stacked Random Forest (Stacked RF), and Weighted average ensemble.

    the data set as shown in Table 1 were collected during the mid-season stage of
    maize (i.e., July, August, September) for both years (2020, 2021) since it is
    the period where the crop is sensitive to water stress and where much of the irrigation
    scheduling is needed. Model evaluation for ETc prediction used a total of twelve
    variables: six weather variables (Tmin, Tmax, RH, VPD, u2, Rs), total soil water
    at three soil depths, and three ancillary variables including NDVI, CGDDs, and
    ETr. In contrast, with CWSI, there were five weather variables (Ta, RH, VPD, u2,
    Rs), total soil water at three depths, and one ancillary variable (ETr). On the
    other hand, different input combinations were employed with fifteen combinations
    (Table 2) used for predicting ETc as compared to twelve combinations (Table 3)
    for CWSI prediction. Each combination had total soil water at either of the three
    soil depths and ancillary variables (Tables 2, and 3). The combination number
    accompanied the model to identify the new generic model (model + input combination)
    after following Yamaç [25] and Fan et al. [29]. Table 2. Input feature combinations

    of features (i.e., input variables) for predicting ETc and CWSI, both permutation
    importance and feature importance by random forest were used [37] in addition
    to use of SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) to further evaluate the contribution
    of each feature to the predictions. SHAP values detect the best parameters and
    their impact on the final output using the conditional expectation function while
    visualizing individual feature characterizations [55]. Additionally, the exploratory
    analysis about correlation strength between independent input variable and response
    variables (ETc and CWSI) was also conducted using a confusion matrix based on
    Pearson''s correlation coefficient (r). There was a total of 540 points in a combined
    data set (30 days × 3 months × 2 years). Data set was split into training (60%)
    and testing (40%). Because of limited data, each model was evaluated on each set
    using the repeated k-fold cross validation to ensure models do not overfit as
    well as allowing the models to check every single data point from both sets [35].
    Data pre-processing was done by normalizing the values to the same range (0, 1)
    using Eq. (4) for all variables such that they receive equal attention during
    model predictions [38]. (4) where xn and xi is the normalized and raw values of
    inputs variables, respectively, and xmax and xmin are the minimum and maximum
    values of the input variables, respectively. 2.4.2. Building a program with all
    models A program constituting all models was developed using Python in Google
    Colaboratory interface which is a free Jupyter Notebook environment developed
    by Google Company (Google, CA, USA). Among the third-party libraries which were
    used included Pandas, NumPy, scikit-learn machine learning library (Sklearn),
    CatBoost library, as well as TensorFlow and Keras libraries for Neural Network
    (NN) models. On the other hand, prior to training the models, ML models including
    RF, SVM, KNN, and CatBoost were improved by fine tuning their hyperparameters
    using the Grid Search with cross validation (i.e., GridSearchCV) with k-fold equal
    to 10-folds. For the case of NN models such as ANN and LSTM, both the layers and
    their neurons were tuned using “trial and error” as well as Grid Search until
    the best model was achieved. 2.4.3. Evaluation of prediction accuracy Assessment
    of prediction accuracy of the models on both training and testing sets were based
    on four common statistical metrics [26]: coefficient of determination (r2, Eq.
    (5a)), root mean square error (RMSE, Eq. (5b)), mean absolute error (MAE, Eq.
    (5c)), and mean absolute percentage error (MAPE, Eq. (5d)). Furthermore, the ranking
    procedure as used in Zhang et al. [26] was also adopted to determine the overall
    performance of the 150 ETc predictions (i.e., 15 input combinations × 10 models)
    and 120 CWSI predictions (i.e., 12 input combinations × 10 models), where each
    model received a total ranking score as a sum of scores from all statistical metrics
    (i.e., r2, RMSE, MAE, and MAPE). The ranking was done by assigning the model with
    the highest r2 or lowest RMSE/MAE/MAPE with ranking score equal to one, in contrast
    to the model with the lowest r2 or highest RMSE/MAE/MAPE was the worst and given
    a ranking score equal to one hundred fifty for ETc and one hundred twenty for
    CWSI. Overall model performance was therefore based on the total ranking on either
    training or testing set, in simple terms, any model with the smallest total ranking
    score was considered the best [56,26]. The average values of independent metrics
    across all models were also analyzed. (5a) (5b) (5c) (5d) where Pi is the model
    prediction value, Oi is the observed or measured value, and n is the number of
    observations. 3. Results and discussion 3.1. Input variables The study was conducted
    in two dry seasons of 2020 and 2021. However, there was variability in weather
    conditions across the years as shown in Table 4 with greater Tmax and smaller
    Tmin in 2020 as compared to 2021. Similarly, mean VPD, u2, and Rs in the mid-season
    of maize was higher in 2020 than 2021 showing a difference of 0.51 kPa, 0.31 m
    s−1, and 4.7 W m−2, respectively. Eventually, higher evaporative demand was also
    observed in 2020 maize growing season with maximum ETr of 13.6 mm d−1 and mean
    ETr of 7.9 mm d−1 as compared to 2020 season which had 10.6 mm d−1 and 6.4 mm
    d−1 following the same order. This might explain the lower mean soil water content
    at deeper soil depths of 2.1 m since the maize in 2020 was aggressively taking
    up soil moisture during the mid-season to match the high evaporative demand. However,
    the difference in soil water content between the two seasons was only 9 mm since
    both were drought years with soil moisture content ranging between 170 – 369 mm
    for 2020 and 172 – 378 mm for 2021. Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI)
    values were almost the same across the two years since the maize crop in both
    years experienced similar climatic conditions as well as irrigation and nitrogen
    applications. Both years seemed to have had similar weather extremes despite seeing
    small differences in evaporative demands as well as across weather variables and
    soil moisture content. As commonly observed, NDVI correlated well with crop development
    and crop growth dynamics such as canopy cover and leaf area index. Lastly, NDVI
    also correlated well with the seasonal crop coefficients (Kcr) which is known
    to control seasonal ETc partitioning and soil moisture on the soil surface [51].
    Nevertheless, according to Zhang et al. [26], selected weather variables reflect
    the climatic conditions of the environment, whereby RH and u2 explain the effects
    of aerodynamic resistances on evaporative demand (or ETr), whereas Ta and Rs explain
    the effects of aerodynamic and radiative energy transfer in the study area. Table

    Std represent maximum value, minimum value, average value, and standard deviation,
    respectively for input and response variables. Both daily ETc, values and corresponding
    input variables were computed as the average of the entire day (24 h period) from
    0600 to 2400 h. Whereas daily CWSI values and corresponding input variables were
    computed as the average for only peak hours or solar noon hours between 1200 and
    1600 h., Central Day Time (CDT). 3.2. Correlation between input and response variables
    A correlation matrix between the input and response variables, which are crop
    evapotranspiration (ETc) and crop water stress index (CWSI), was developed based
    on Pearson''s correlation and the coefficients (r) indicated the strength of the
    linear relationships (Fig. 3). With ETc as presented in Fig. 3a, the highest correlation
    was observed with ETr (r = 0.7), followed by VPD (both r = 0.6), and finally those
    with r = 0.5 including NDVI, Tmax, Rs, CGDDs, and total soil water at soil depths
    of 0.9 and 2.1 m. All variables had a positive correlation with ETc, except CGDDs
    and RH, therefore, ETc is lower at higher CGDDs towards crop senescence, but higher
    at lower CGDDs earlier in the season when the crop is still green and healthy
    with higher transpiration rates. Likewise, higher RH indicates lower ETc since
    the evaporative demand decreases. It is good to point out that ancillary variables
    gave the highest correlation coefficient (i.e., strongest relationships) and this
    explains why they were added to all combinations (Tables 2, and 3) as also suggested
    by Yamaç [25]. However, the correlation between CWSI and input variables (Fig.
    3b) generally gave poor correlations (r < 0.3) as compared to ETc where only total
    soil water at 0.9 and 2.1 m profiles (r = 0.6), Ta (r = 0.5), and ETr (r = 0.3)
    showed relatively strong correlations. A negative correlation with total soil
    water at both depths explains that water stress usually reduces under increased
    water sufficiency in the soil profile. Generally, the input variables which were
    positively correlated to response variables explained that their increase in magnitudes
    affected the response variable by reducing it, and vice versa for the input variables
    which were positively correlated to the response variables (i.e., ETc, CWSI).

    and b) CWSI. Where main variables included Tmin, Tmax, Ta which are minimum, maximum,
    and mean air temperatures, respectively, RH is relative humidity, VPD is vapor
    pressure deficit, u2 is the wind speed at 2 m, and soil moisture content at different
    depths include MC-0.9TRS, MC-1.5NMM, MC-2.1NMM which are total soil moisture at
    0.9 determined with TEROS 12 soil moisture sensors as well as at 1.5 m and 2.1
    m determined by Neutron Moisture Meters. Ancillary variables were Normalized Difference
    Vegetation Index (NDVI), cumulative growing degree days (CGDDs), and reference
    evapotranspiration (ETr). FAO56 ETc is the calculated crop evapotranspiration
    using FAO56 single crop coefficient approach and CWSI-Th is the calculated crop
    water stress index using theoretical approach by Jackson et al. [45, 46]. For
    specific irrigated treatments as presented in Table 4, ETc ranged from 2.4 to
    13.2, 2.1 to 11.9, and 1.7 to 9.3 mm d−1 for full, deficit, and rainfed treatments,
    respectively, in 2020 as compared to 2021 where the ranges varied between 2.3
    to 10.9, 2.1 to 9.8, and 1.5 to 7.7 mm d−1 in the same order. The average ETc
    values for full, deficit, and rainfed treatments were higher in 2020 with 7.3,
    6.5, and 4.9 mm d−1 as compared to 6.0, 5.3, and 4.1 mm d−1 in 2021, respectively.
    On the other hand, CWSI was lower in full as compared to deficit and rainfed treatments.
    Higher values were seen in rainfed treatments which indicated that more stress
    occurred as a result of inadequate soil water. Generally, when CWSI ranged between
    0.4 and 0.5 (unitless) for 2020 and 0.2 and 0.5 (unitless) for 2021 indicated
    that there was no water stress in treatments. However, higher CWSI values which
    ranged between 1.1 and 1.5 (unitless) across both growing seasons were observed
    under sever water stress conditions. With theoretical CWSI it is possible to have
    CWSI > 1 outside the known range of 0 to 1 [57]. From the analysis of feature
    importance to prediction, both the permutation feature importance and random forest
    feature importance, had similar agreements as to which features were important.
    For ETc, the four most important variables included NDVI, ETr, and total soil
    water depth at 1.5 and 2.1 m, respectively (i.e., ∑ SWC @ 1.5 m, ∑ SWC @ 2.1 m);
    whereas, CWSI had only two important variables which included Rs and Ta. Therefore,
    it is suggested that features with greater importance (i.e., higher score) have
    more influence on the prediction and should be considered to fasten the process
    as well as reduce performance variations among algorithms [35]. Additionally,
    Shapley values for ETc (Fig. 4) and CWSI (Fig. 5) explained the magnitude of influence
    of each variable to the prediction of ETc and CWSI. The feature importance with
    SHAP values with plots (b), (c), and (d) for Figs. 4 and 5 help to explain the
    global contribution, whereas the SHAP values with bee warm plot showing the scattering
    of the values explains the local feature contribution [55]. Generally, the water
    fall plot (Figs. 4c, and 5c) shows values of the target or independent variable
    (E[f(x)]) which is the mean of all the predictions. The magnitude of the SHAP
    value is indicated by the length of the bar for all plots except bee warm plot
    (Figs. 4a, and 5a). For ETc prediction, ETr still contributed much to the prediction
    and had much influence, compared to Ta for CWSI. To consider the significance
    of the contribution for the entire data set, bee swarm plot was used (Figs. 4a,
    and 5a) where the blue and red hue represent high and lower predicted values.
    Therefore, both high and lower values of ETr and Ta had positive and negative
    contributions, respectively, indicating a positive correlation of both variables
    with the predicted variables. However, Tmin in ETc prediction and Rs in CWSI prediction
    both had almost no contribution to the prediction regardless of their values being
    high or low implying that they could be dropped when running model predictions.

    Model evaluations 3.3.1. Crop evapotranspiration (ETc) Prediction performance
    assessment was conducted for all machine learning models on both training and
    testing sets. The testing set revealed the best model for predicting the response
    variable, ETc. As presented in Fig. 6, they were ranked from best to worst as
    Stacked-Regr > SVM > Stacked-RF > CatBoost > Weighted-Ensemble > ANN > LSTM >
    MLR > RF > kNN since they had lower ranking scores on all metrics including r2
    (Fig. 6a), RMSE (Fig. 6b), MAE (Fig. 6c), and MAPE (Fig. 6d) on 15 input combinations.
    Considering the best model which was Stacked-Regr, its performance with different
    input combinations (Table 2) from the best to worst was ranked as 4 > 2 > 3 >
    7 > 10. Based on total ranking scores for all 150 predictions, the common input
    for acceptable prediction was four, which also produced the best prediction for
    both Stacked-Regr and SVM. The input combination of four surprisingly had incomplete
    weather variables but was the best as also observed by Yamaç [25]. According to
    Yamaç [25], Tmax, Tmin, Rs, and Kc provided the best results for sugar beet ETc
    during testing with SVM as compared to RF (Tmax, Tmin, RHmax, RHmin, Rs, u2, and
    Kc) (all used variables) and kNN (Tmax, Tmin, Rs, and Kc). In their study they
    did not consider soil water content as an input, however, Talib et al. [51] noted
    that soil water content can be an important factor when modeling with AI algorithms.
    Additionally, Chen et al. [58] suggested that ML models having Ta and RH as part
    of input variables can offer higher precision with ETc estimation. On the other
    hand, adding ancillary variables based on crop growth characteristics can also
    improve model prediction. Such ancillary variables include crop phenology (i.e.,
    Kcr, NDVI) or cumulative growing degree days (CGDDs) [51] or plant growth parameters
    such as plant height or LAI [12]. Download : Download high-res image (878KB) Download

    for all ten models and fifteen input combinations on both testing and training
    sets on statistical performance metrics – a) coefficient of determination (r2),
    b) root mean square error (RMSE), c) mean absolute error (MAE), and d) mean absolute
    percentage error (MAPE). Evaluated models included Artificial Intelligence models
    include Artificial Neural Network (ANN), Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), Random
    Forest (RF), Support Vector Machines (SVM), K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Categorical
    Boosting decision tree (CatBoost), as well as Multiple Linear Regression (MLR)
    as the only traditional mathematical model. Machine learning ensembles were Stacked
    Regression (Stacked-Regr), Stacked Random Forest (Stacked-RF), and Weighted average
    Ensemble (Weighted-Ensemble). The performance metrics on the testing set ranged
    between 0.64 and 0.99, 0.27 and 1.03 mm d−1, 0.22 and 0.81 mm d−1, and 4.5 and
    18.8% for r2, RMSE, MAE, and MAPE, respectively (Fig. 7). These ranges are consistent
    with what was observed by Yamaç, [25]. The highest r2 and lowest RMSE, MAE and
    MAPE values were observed overall in the ensembled ML models particularly with
    Stacked-Regr followed by Stacked-RF and then Weighted-Ensemble; however, poor
    results were observed for LSTM and KNN. There was less overestimation or underestimation
    of the ETc when ensemble models were used as explained by lower RMSE, MAE, and
    MAPE (Fig. 7). Contrary to our results where ensembles performed better than other
    AI models, Zhang et al. [26] found CatBoost as the best among other AI models
    (i.e., RF, NN) using input weather parameters Tmax, Tmin, RH, u2, and Rn in ETc
    estimations; however, they never considered ensembling as done in this study.
    Zhang et al. [26] found the main sensitive input weather variables while estimating
    ETc which were Tmin and Tmax, but recognized that other additional variables can
    also be considered. According to Granata et al. [59], predictions of ETc without
    using Rs as one of the inputs might cause errors, therefore use of limited data
    with only temperature is not advisable. Talib et al. [51] reported that indeed
    Rs was the most important factor, more than temperature (i.e., Tmax) to improve
    the accuracy of ETc prediction. Download : Download high-res image (965KB) Download

    were a) coefficient of determination (r2), b) root mean square error (RMSE), c)

    models included Artificial Intelligence models include Artificial Neural Network
    (ANN), Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), Random Forest (RF), Support Vector Machines
    (SVM), K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Categorical Boosting decision tree (CatBoost),
    as well as Multiple Linear Regression (MLR) as the only traditional mathematical
    model. Machine learning ensembles were Stacked Regression (Stacked-Regr), Stacked
    Random Forest (Stacked-RF), and Weighted average Ensemble (Weighted-Ensemble).
    3.3.2. Crop water stress index (CWSI) As similarly done in ETc prediction, CWSI
    prediction was assessed with same models but now using twelve input combinations
    (Table 3). From Fig. 8 the total ranking scores displayed the best prediction
    model on testing set which was CatBoost; however, kNN deteriorated in accuracy
    on testing as compared to training among all models. Nonetheless, the performance
    on the testing set from best (low score) to worst (high score) were ranked as
    CatBoost > RF > Weighted-Ensemble > Stacked-Regr > ANN > LSTM > SVM > kNN > Stacked-RF
    > MLR. Differing from the observations in ETc prediction, ML ensembles never performed
    extremely well in CWSI estimations, except Weighted-Ensemble which performed better
    than the other ensembles. The best input combinations (Table 3) for CatBoost were
    10 > 11 > 12 > 8 > 9. Overall, CatBoost10 (i.e., CatBoost model + Input combination
    10) outperformed the rest of the models. CatBoost was the best model in estimating
    ETr among other ML models in the study done by Zhang et al. [26] and Huang et
    al. [56]. It is worth noting that the outliers exhibited among some models are
    attributed to the fact that some of the input combinations extremely over or under
    predicted CWSI and such predictions were out of the range based on the overall
    performance of the model. Download : Download high-res image (920KB) Download

    percentage error (MAPE). Evaluated models included Artificial Intelligence models
    include Artificial Neural Network (ANN), Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), Random
    Forest (RF), Support Vector Machines (SVM), K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Categorical
    Boosting decision tree (CatBoost), as well as Multiple Linear Regression (MLR)
    as the only traditional mathematical model. Machine learning ensembles were Stacked
    Regression (Stacked-Regr), Stacked Random Forest (Stacked-RF), and Weighted average
    Ensemble (Weighted-Ensemble). Focusing on individual performance metrics (Fig.
    9), model accuracy deteriorated across the models on the testing set as compared
    to the training set since lower r2 values as well as higher values with other
    metrics (RMSE, MAE, MAPE) was observed. Nonetheless, models such as RF, kNN, and
    CatBoost remained stable with greater performances since they did not show greater
    differences in metrics for the two periods as opposed to LSTM and MLR which performed
    poorly in both periods. During the testing period, the observed ranges of r2 were
    0.40 to 0.99, RMSE ranged between 0.15 to 0.25 (unitless), MAE ranged between
    0.10 to 0.19 (unitless), and 7.9 to 15.1% for MAPE. Generally, less prediction
    errors were seen in CatBoost since it had the lowest RMSE (Fig. 9b), MAE (Fig.
    9c), and MAPE (Fig. 9d), and it was the best estimator of CWSI among all other
    models. Comparing the findings to other studies, Kumar et al. [5] found that the
    best ANN model used three input variables (RH, Ta, and Tc) and Rs was not used
    likely due to being unavailable from most weather stations. According to Kumar
    et al. [5], better predictions can be achieved with expansion of the dataset such
    that models can learn more about the data and eventually be able to predict CWSI
    satisfactorily. In addition, the wide distribution of the values could improve
    the estimation since most of the time they are clustered into small ranges which
    makes it difficult for the model to learn [5]. For future research, it is suggested
    to couple a process-based crop model which can report crop stress limits with
    a data-driven model (as done in this study) to generate more training data which
    can help improve CWSI prediction. However, it must be acknowledged that crop models
    are not able to capture the underlying natural variabilities in the field. Otherwise,
    expansion of the data to include observations from other years and experimental
    sites is required. Download : Download high-res image (959KB) Download : Download

    3.4. Performance of best AI models in the irrigated treatments compared to rainfed
    treatment 3.4.1. Crop evapotranspiration (ETc) After evaluating all the models
    and identifying the best model for estimating ETc, it was then imposed on all
    selected treatments which were used to create both training and testing dataset
    for the models across the two growing seasons 2021 (Fig. 10) and 2020 (Fig. 11).
    While considering only 2021 growing season, the separation of the treatments were
    observed as water sufficiency was varied from adequate in fully irrigated maize
    to less in deficit irrigated maize and more limited in rainfed maize as shown
    in Fig. 10a. The performance of Stacked Regression was better in both full and
    deficit irrigated treatments as compared to rainfed treatment (Fig. 10b, 10c).
    Additionally, months of July and August were used since it is when maize crop
    water requirements are high and therefore on a specific day of either of those
    two months, Stacked regression performed much better in fully and deficit irrigated
    maize than in rainfed maize as presented in Fig. 10c. On the other hand, treatments
    in 2020 growing season also showed distinct differences across the treatments
    (Fig. 11a) and the AI model perfomed well for all the treatments (Fig. 11b) and
    likewise the model agreed with the calculated ETc values on most of the days for
    the considered two months as shown in Fig. 11c. Download : Download high-res image

    and c) daily ETc for two months (July and August) between FAO56 ETc approach and
    best model (i.e., Stacked Regression). 3.4.2. Crop water stress index (CWSI) The
    best model was CatBoost for predicting CWSI for irrigated treatments in comparison
    to rainfed treatment for both 2021 (Fig. 12) and 2020 (Fig. 13) growing seasons.
    There was significant difference between the treatments especially in irrigated
    versus rainfed treatments during 2021 maize growing season as presented in Fig.
    12a. Conversely, in 2020 growing season (Fig. 13a) there was small differences
    between the irrigated treatments which explains that the crop water stress was
    similar in both treatments (full and deficit). Although CWSI is said to range
    from 0 to 1, the theoretical CWSI ranged between 0 and 1.5, which was also observed
    by Katimbo et al. [57]. From the linear regression analysis for both seasons,
    the model performed better in estimating CWSI values in irrigated as compared
    to rainfed maize (Fig. 12b, Fig. 13b). However, the worst performance among rainfed
    treatments was achieved in the growing season of 2020 (Fig. 13a). For months of
    July and August in the two growing seasons, the CatBoost model performed well
    across the treatments especially in 2021 (Fig. 12c), however, it tended to overestimate
    CWSI on most days in 2020 specifically in the rainfed treatment but the performance
    improved in full and deficit treatments as observed in Fig. 13c. Download : Download

    Machine learning models have increasingly been employed to monitor or track soil
    moisture, crop water use as well as water stress [[1], [2], [5], [26], [27]].
    Hence, there is potential of using such models in irrigation scheduling tools
    or irrigation decision support systems (IDSS) particularly to forecast/estimate
    plant and soil water feedback mechanisms. In this study, CWSI was considered as
    the plant feedback mechanism and ETc with soil water balance can provide soil
    water depletion which is the soil water feedback mechanism. It is hypothesized
    that the best predicting models (e.g., CatBoost and Stacked regression for this
    study), along with collected real-time sensor data, can be used in IDSS to decide
    irrigation amount and timing. This could possibly reduce irrigation decision making
    time as well as minimize errors from uncertainties contributed by use of direct
    sensor measurements. In general, IDSS can utilize sensor data collected in real-time
    when techniques such as Internet of Things (IoTs) or Wireless Sensor Networks
    (WSNs) are used. Recent studies have used AI models to estimate soil moisture
    for their use in irrigation management [11,1,27]; however current study explored
    the use of similar models in deriving feedbacks to support irrigation decision
    making. Future research will therefore further design and evaluate an IDSS having
    both plant and soil water feedbacks in comparison to conventional methods with
    respect to irrigation withdrawal, water use efficiency, and harvested yields.
    5. Conclusion Precise irrigation scheduling techniques are desired to improve
    water use efficiency and optimize yields in regions where water is scarce or where
    high-water demand for other sectors is experienced. This current study evaluated
    the performance of a wide range of machine learning models in predicting crop
    evapotranspiration (ETc) and crop water stress index (CWSI) whose predictions
    were compared to calculated values from standard mathematical models - single
    crop coefficient FAO56 ETc and Jackson''s theoretical CWSI computation. Among
    a total of ten machine learning models evaluated, it was found that Stacked Regression
    with inputs Tmin, Tmax, RH, and ∑SWC @ 0.9 m performed best in estimating ETc.
    Conversely, CatBoost with inputs including Ta, Rs, VPD, RH, u2, and ∑SWC @ 0.9
    m was the best in predicting CWSI. Future research will involve use of these two
    models along with the best input combinations in developing an irrigation decision
    support system (IDSS) which will have both plant (as CWSI) and soil water feedback
    (as soil water depletion) mechanisms. Additionally, designed IDSS will be compared
    to conventional irrigation scheduling methods to determine if it can optimize
    yields or improve water use efficiency with reduced irrigation water withdrawals.

    Figures Versions Notes Simple Summary SILS and U-VATS procedures present many
    advantages, but also a series of limitations, such as the narrow operating space
    and poor surgeon ergonomics. To enhance the surgeon’s performance, this study
    aims to develop an AI and AR-based hazard detection system. The focus is on detecting
    and locating hemorrhages, a common occurrence especially in cancer patients. The
    system utilizes the YOLO v5 algorithm, trained to accurately identify bleeding
    in real-time. When bleeding is detected, it is displayed on a Hololens 2 device,
    alerting the doctor to its occurrence and origin. The system demonstrated its
    capability to distinguish between instances of bleeding and intraoperative irrigation,
    reducing the risk of false-negative and false-positive results. The current advancements
    in AI and AR technologies present potential of real-time hazard detection systems,
    which can serve as effective tools to assist surgeons, particularly in high-risk
    surgeries. Abstract The problem: Single-incision surgery is a complex procedure
    in which any additional information automatically collected from the operating
    field can be of significance. While the use of robotic devices has greatly improved
    surgical outcomes, there are still many unresolved issues. One of the major surgical
    complications, with higher occurrence in cancer patients, is intraoperative hemorrhages,
    which if detected early, can be more efficiently controlled. Aim: This paper proposes
    a hazard detection system which incorporates the advantages of both Artificial

    robotic system 1. Introduction Surgical procedures represent a major occurrence
    in medicine. Consequently, they are constantly evolving to keep up with the fast-paced
    technical advancements in this field, while also acknowledging the importance
    of creating efficient and optimized systems capable of meeting the high demand
    for medical services [1]. Among the most innovative techniques adopted to improve
    both the safety of the patient and the outcome of the medical procedure was the
    introduction of AI and AR agents in surgical procedures. With only one incision
    needed to introduce the trocars, which hold the active instruments and the laparoscopic
    camera, the single-incision surgery has various benefits, such as a faster recovery
    time, a reduced hospital stay, and superior cosmetic outcomes [2], but with a
    steeper learning curve. Initially reported as a procedure with higher risks in
    terms of surgeon ergonomics and instruments’ cross-over, the single-incision technique
    is now reported with similar (if not more efficient, in some cases) medical outcomes
    in both laparoscopic [3]—identified as SILS (single-incision laparoscopic surgery)—and
    thoracic surgery [4]—identified as U-VATS (uniportal video-assisted thoracic surgery).
    SILS was documented in 1969 when it was first performed in gynecology as a single
    incision at the umbilicus. This type of procedure only became popular in 1992,
    when the first report about using SILS on a considerable number of appendectomies
    cases was published [5]. U-VATS has also demonstrated its multiple benefits in
    both intraoperative and postoperative outcomes [6], showing better results compared
    to other approaches in lung cancer treatment [7]. Taking advantage of the emergence
    of increasingly advanced robotic systems, the surgical field quickly embraced
    the idea of incorporating robotics into medical procedures in order to provide
    surgeons with advanced tools which would: (1) increase the precision of the instruments
    through motion scalability, (2) increase the dexterity of the instruments by adding
    flexible distal joints, (3) increase the procedure ergonomics, and (4) reduce
    the blood loss and damage to healthy tissue. The robotic-assisted single-incision
    (uniport) surgery, which dates back to 1998 [8], offers many benefits, such as
    less trauma and a better cosmetic result, but it also exhibits some disadvantages,
    among which are the limited movement range of the robot platform instruments and
    decreased visibility. The latter are determined by the narrow space [9,10] in
    which the robot performs the surgery. To further improve the outcomes of SILS,
    a series of additional factors ought to be taken into account, such as: AI agents
    able to predict the optimal trajectory of the robot based on the anatomical particularity
    of each patient, performing image computation [11] in the pre-planning phase,
    and AR elements able to add further details to the surgical field. Although the
    terms “Augmented Reality” and “Artificial Intelligence” were often used distinctively
    in surgeries, the potential to merge the capabilities of both technologies has
    recently sparked research interest [12]. The authors of [13] describe multiple
    possibilities in which Artificial Intelligence and Augmented Reality could be
    involved in surgical training for improved experience in young surgeons. The authors
    of [14] propose a surgical navigation system based on Artificial Intelligence
    and Augmented Reality in which the surgeon performs the medical procedure based
    on AI agents for image processing and surgery planning and AR agents for intraoperative
    navigation (based on holograms), respectively. Moreover, machine learning based
    on Augmented Reality systems was developed to improve surgical scene understanding
    and depth perception. To achieve this effect, the authors suggest a system that
    integrates AI and AR agents [15]. As can be seen, the integration of AI and AR
    agents during surgical procedures is still in its pioneering stage, with the subject
    presenting several prospective opportunities for the use of the above-mentioned
    agents in surgical procedures. A hazard identification solution for a robotic
    SILS technique was examined starting from the concept described in [12], especially
    because this topic has not been covered in the literature. The previous studies
    have not focused on the integration of AR and AI in robotic SILS and U-VATS procedures,
    in which the demand for additional information is even higher considering the
    narrow space in which the surgeries are performed and the complexities associated
    with the master–slave structure are more numerous. Hence, the objective of this
    study is to address this gap by developing a comprehensive system that combines
    AR and AI technologies for on-site and on-time detection of intraoperative hazards.
    This system aims to provide surgeons with real-time information, overcoming the
    challenges posed by the confined surgical environment and facilitating enhanced
    surgical precision and decision-making. Considering that bleedings are some of
    the most common occurrences during surgeries, particularly for patients suffering
    from cancer, the study focuses on integrating bleeding identification into a real-time
    hazard detection system. The system utilizes machine learning algorithms capable
    of recognizing the bleeding and its source along with Augmented Reality and the
    Hololens 2 device. The objective is to alert the surgeon and to indicate the source
    of the bleeding by displaying it in real time. Following the Introduction Section
    above, Section 2 analyzes different types of object detection algorithms and their
    capabilities, followed by a comprehensive analysis of the selection of the most
    adequate algorithm. Furthermore, Section 3 presents the architectural structure
    of the system and its integration in an innovative robotic system used for SILS
    procedures together with the description of the software development and the YOLOv5
    algorithm training. Finally, Section 4 highlights the results, while Section 5
    presents the conclusions. 2. Methodology 2.1. Critical Analysis of Hazard Detection
    Techniques The hazard detection system aims to assist the surgeon by providing
    additional information that could be helpful, bearing in mind the complex nature
    of the surgical procedure. Considering that single-incision robotic surgery is
    a type of minimally invasive procedure, surgical field visualization is achieved
    through an endoscopic camera. The alert system is thus based on image processing.
    Image processing is extensively used in the medical field for brain tumor detection,
    cancer diagnosis, congenital heart defects, etc. [16]. This sector has significantly
    developed lately with machine learning (ML) algorithms, which now allow specialists
    to analyze and detect organs or anomalies faster. It is worth mentioning that
    the use of NN (neural network)/AI agents as fast detection tools in different
    areas of medicine does not imply the removal of the human expert from the medical
    procedure. These NN/AI agents rather represent advanced tools that can provide
    accurate details in a very short period of time, enabling the human expert to
    make better medical decisions. Therefore, this paper adopted an approach in which
    object detection methods were used to detect bleeding in real time. The goal of
    the object detection algorithms is to locate the target and to return a bounding
    box that shows the item’s location. These algorithms are used for a variety of
    tasks, in which the goal is based on event detection, target tracking, semantic
    analysis, or scene interpretation [17]. There are multiple methods used to perform
    object detection, and in the last decade, due to the advance of ML, these algorithms
    have become faster and faster, performing the task with a high degree of accuracy.
    2.1.1. SSD (Single-Shot Detector) The SSD algorithm is based on a feed-forward
    convolutional network able to generate a collection of bounding boxes around the
    detected object, scoring the possibility that the detected object belongs to a
    certain class [18]. The structure of the model is made up of two parts: the backbone
    model based on a pre-trained image classification network, from which the final
    classification layer is removed, and the SSD head, attached to the top of the
    backbone model, being made up of convolutional layers. The model takes the input
    image and divides it into grids, thus performing detection for each grid. The
    process is followed by the application of a non-maximum suppression model to achieve
    a final detection from the set of overlapping detections. 2.1.2. Faster R-CNN
    (Faster Region-Based Convolutional Network) The Faster R-CNN model is a complex
    algorithm composed of three neural networks (NN): the feature network, region
    proposal network (RPN), and the detection network. The input image is processed
    by the feature network (a pre-trained image classification network), which aims
    to retrieve the features from the image. At the same time, RPN (a simple NN with
    convolutional layers) generates a number of bounding boxes, named regions of interest
    (ROI). These two NNs serve as input for the detection network, which takes the
    input from both networks and generates the final class and bounding box [19].
    2.1.3. YOLOv5 The YOLO (You Only Look Once) algorithm, released for the first
    time in 2015, represents a viable solution for object detection [20]. The originality
    of YOLO lies in the mechanism by which the detection is performed, using a single
    fully connected layer to create predictions of bounding boxes and class probabilities
    all at once. This differs from earlier systems that repurposed classifiers to
    perform detection [21]. In order to improve the accuracy and the speed of the
    algorithm, many versions of YOLO have been released over the years [22]. YOLOv5,
    released in 2020, presents a complex structure based on the EfficientNet network
    architecture. The performance of this approach has been enhanced by the inclusion
    of two key features: spatial pyramid pooling (SPP), which has improved the identification
    of small objects, and dynamic anchor boxes, which allowed for better alignment
    of the bounding boxes with the identified object [23]. The efficiency of YOLOv5
    on different tasks was extensively studied [24,25], with the results showing that
    this version of YOLO presents satisfactory accuracy and, more importantly, a superior
    speed in detection, as seen in Figure 1. Figure 1. Performance of YOLOv3, YOLOv4,
    and the four versions of the YOLOv5 algorithm, based on accuracy, based on the
    content from Figure 1 in [24]. Furthermore, an in-depth analysis meant to enable
    the proper selection of the most efficient AI algorithm to train the neural network
    for hazard detection was proposed. In order to achieve this, the authors have
    identified, with the support of medical experts, a set of performance criteria
    relevant to the task at hand. These performance criteria were then evaluated in
    terms of criticality levels using the analytic hierarchy process (AHP), presented
    in Figure 2. This methodology was subsequently followed by a Pugh selection methodology
    (using the Qualica® software) that will assess the three methods described in
    the paper, with the purpose of identifying the most efficient approach. Figure
    2. The AHP analysis on the critical performance criteria of AI algorithms. The
    identified performance criteria are presented below, followed by a brief motivation
    for their selection: Detection accuracy. Accuracy detection is critical for the
    safety of the patient when targeting specific hazards during the surgical intervention
    (in this case, internal bleeding). While a false-positive result (a false identification
    of bleeding) may be disturbing for the surgeon, a false-negative one is unacceptable,
    as timely identification of the bleeding can save the patient’s life. Training
    data. Each AI algorithm uses training datasets to learn, and in the case of internal
    intraoperative bleeding, the data are difficult to collect, being mostly retrieved
    from live recordings of procedures in which incidents occur. As this information
    comes from multiple sources, there is uncontrolled variability in the dataset.
    This requires the AI algorithm to be robust to these variations. Training time.
    The training time of a neural network depends on many parameters derived from
    the input data (which are assumedly similar), the network configuration, and the
    computer hardware. While the training time is not relevant for a final implementation,
    it becomes important during the study and research phase, as the neural network
    needs to enable multiple tests, configurations, etc. Therefore, the final goal
    of the training time is accuracy maximization. Real-time performance. The hazard
    detection system is used during the surgical procedure in a dynamic field of view.
    The most dangerous bleeding is the one that occurs at the extremities of the surgical
    field (since in the central part where the surgeon is actively working, it will
    be easily noticed). Such bleeding is sometimes displayed for only a few seconds.
    Thus, bleeding detection should occur as soon as possible, with a targeted time
    delay of less than 0.1 s. Adaptability to the medical environment. One parameter
    which differentiates AI algorithms refers to their capabilities to either perform
    “object detection” or perform “image classification”, with the latter proving
    to be more effective in medical applications. Efficient prediction capability.
    As mentioned before, even though bleeding is marginally the same, its illustration
    can vary a lot depending on the location, type of vessel, neighboring organs,
    camera type, lighting, overshadowing, etc. Ideally, the hazard detection tool
    should be invariant to these changes. Thus, it is important to minimize the false
    results or to very accurately identify the limitations of each algorithm. Hardware
    requirements. An important aspect in the development of complex control platforms
    is the efficient use of hardware resources to manage all functionalities in real
    time. Thus, a lower CPU/GPU/RAM consumption is targeted as this hazard detection
    tool must run in real time during the entire procedure. Additionally, a Pugh Matrix
    was used to evaluate the three potential candidates for the development of the
    AI hazard detection tool: SSD, Faster R-CNN, and YOLOv5. Using the scale in the
    upper left corner, each of the three algorithms were assessed with respect to
    the weighted values of the performance criteria. As seen in Figure 3, while all
    three algorithms met the pre-defined requirements, YOLOv5 has the potential to
    deliver the best possible results. SSD exhibited a very good real-time performance.
    However, it lacks accuracy and has higher hardware requirements. The most accurate
    algorithm was the Faster R-CNN, which uses a two-stage image analysis. However,
    this analysis rendered it less suitable for real-time applications. Figure 3.
    The Pugh Matrix results for the weighted analysis of the three candidate algorithms.
    2.2. Detection System Architecture The hardware system workflow proposed for bleeding/hemorrhage
    detection is presented in Figure 4. The endoscopic camera located in the surgical
    field retrieves images and sends them to the connected PC, where they are displayed
    on a monitor. Using the algorithm, the surgeon, wearing the Hololens 2 device,
    is presented with the bleeding and its source through the bounding boxes, created
    as holograms on the device. Figure 4. The schematic representation of the hardware
    system composed of a laparoscopic camera, monitor, and the Hololens 2 device.
    This system is designed to fit with the robotic master–slave concept, in which
    the main surgeon sits at a master console controlling the surgical instruments
    by actuating the slave robotic system. The Hololens 2 device was released in 2019
    by Microsoft [26] and uses Augmented Reality technology to overlap holograms into
    the real word. This device presents many advantages, such as high autonomy, eye
    tracking, and its own operating system, thus supporting the development of advanced
    applications in many fields. In robotic-assisted surgery, Hololens 2 was used
    to assist in surgical navigation based on holographic markers [27] to explore
    the possibility of replacing real monitors with virtual ones, on which images
    from the endoscopic camera are displayed [28]. Another application of Hololens
    2 was to create simulators through which the surgical robots can be tested in
    safe conditions in the prototype phase [29]. This AI-based hazard detection tool
    is one of the intelligent components embedded in the master console of a new robotic
    system for SILS currently under development. A brief description of the slave
    component is presented below. PARA-SILS-ROB An innovative modular robotic system
    (Figure 5a) for SILS was proposed by the authors of [30]. It consists of several
    modules: a 6-DOF (degrees of freedom) parallel structure, presented in Figure
    5b, which manipulates a mobile platform (Figure 5c), on which a 1-DOF module located
    in the center of the platform is used for endoscopic camera insertion, and two
    3-DOF modules are located on the sides of the central one, which achieve the orientation
    and insertion of the active surgical instruments. Figure 5. (a) Design of the
    PARA-SILS-ROB robotic system. (b) The 6-DOF parallel robot. (c) Mobile platform
    with 3-DOF. Summarizing the detailed description of the robotic system in [30,31,32],
    the motions of the robot can be described as follows: (a) Motions outside the
    body: The 6-DOF parallel robot positions and orients the mobile platform carrying
    the instruments, aiming to move the tips of the three instruments over the insertion
    points in the body (using any model of a SILS port). The active instruments’ modules
    will orient the active instruments’ tips to ensure that the distance between their
    tips and the tip of the endoscopic camera is consistent with the SILS port. This
    motion is achieved without any restrictions. (b) Instruments’ insertion into the
    body: The instruments’ modules will insert the instruments based on predefined
    depths on linear trajectories. In this step, restrictions are applied onto the
    robotic system, as follows: (1) The 6-DOF parallel robot will register the insertion
    point coordinates of the endoscopic camera, which will be used as a fixed point
    in the robot workspace from this moment on until the instruments will be removed
    from the body—based on the principle of remote center of motion (RCM) [33,34].
    (2) The 6-DOF parallel robot will preserve its vertical axis coordinates. The
    instruments’ insertion inside the body is performed only by the insertion modules.
    (c) Motions inside the body: The 6-DOF parallel robot will achieve the orientation
    of the endoscopic camera (preserving the fixed point, defined earlier as RCM).
    The orientation of the active instruments is achieved through the orientation
    function of the active instruments’ modules, which achieve the RCM through kinematic
    constraints. A schematic representation of the integration of the Hololens device
    in the master–slave system is presented in Figure 6. The surgeon is comfortably
    positioned at the master console and is aided by two 3D Connection Space-Mouse
    devices to control the active instruments of the robotic system, and the camera
    position can be controlled either by voice commands [35] or by using one of the
    3D devices. Benefiting also from the integration of the Hololens 2 AR device,
    the surgeon can receive, superposed over the intraoperative images, different
    hazards detected in real time by the AI algorithms, such as the source of the
    bleeding and blood loss estimation (scaled based on potential risks). Figure 6.
    Integration of a hazard detection system in the SILS robotic platform, including
    the master–slave concept. 2.3. Software Development and Testing 2.3.1. Dataset
    The quantity and quality of the training data have a direct impact on the robustness
    of an ML algorithm, affecting both the accuracy of the prediction and the bias-proneness
    of the algorithm. A total of 15 videos were selected for this study, containing
    different laparoscopic surgeries in which bleeding was present. The selection
    of videos was based on three major factors: (a) The video had to contain the onset
    of bleeding. In this way, the algorithm was trained to detect the bleeding from
    the start and to mark its location. (b) It had to contain both scenes where the
    bleeding was present and where it was not. The images where the bleeding was not
    present were used as negative samples to avoid the overfitting of the model and
    to increase the accuracy. (c) The clip needed to offer the possibility to track
    the event—the bleeding event had to be visible (without many juxtapositions) to
    create (if needed) a trace of the bleeding. Using the OpenLabelling tool [36],
    the images were retrieved from the selected videos at 20 frames per second, thus
    obtaining a total of 2694 images, out of which 1353 contained bleeding events.
    The images were in a 640 × 640 format, this being specific for the YOLOv5 (YOLOv5m
    and YOLOv5s) input tensor. The same tool was also utilized to annotate the bleeding.
    For the purpose of this paper, a single class named “bleeding” was used, and the
    data resulting from the annotation process (the coordinates of bounding boxes)
    were saved in YOLO Darknet annotation format (four values: coordinates for X-
    center, Y-center, and dimensions for width and height). The annotation was assisted
    by a person specialized in providing valid data. 2.3.2. Augmentation In order
    to avoid overfitting and to increase the performance of the algorithm, a set of
    additional operations was required to augment the input data. For this dataset,
    augmentation techniques were used, such as scaling to obtain features with similar
    value ranges and to prevent bias, cropping to obtain large input data focused
    on the bleeding events, and rotating to create opportunities for the algorithm
    to detect bleeding regardless of the context and the position in which they occur.
    Color augmentation (Gamma correction and brightness) was used to achieve different
    contrast levels, thus increasing the adaptability of the algorithm to different
    types of laparoscopic cameras, and mosaic augmentation was used to collect inputs
    in which the bleeding event was obstructed (since the mosaic technique combines
    different training inputs in a single image in which the object, or in this case
    the bleeding, could be overlapped) and to offer images where bleeding was present
    in different backgrounds and contexts, as seen in Figure 7. Figure 7. Results
    of augmentation operations, including scaling, rotation, cropping, color augmentation,
    and mosaic augmentation. The total dataset used in the training process was split
    into three parts: 270 images were used for testing, 2155 were used for training,
    and 269 were used for validation. Training In order to obtain a loss function
    (difference between the prediction of bounding boxes and the ground truth) as
    low as possible, the model was trained in different configurations, in which the
    hyperparameters were adjusted, as seen in Table 1. Table 1. Parameters considered
    for optimization of the YOLOv5 algorithm. The custom data were trained using both
    the YOLOv5s and YOLOv5m models, as these configurations of the YOLOv5 model are
    the most suitable for the purpose of this study, considering the processing time
    and the hardware resources used in medical applications. Both configurations require
    images with the size of 640 × 640 pixels, with the major difference between them
    being their size and complexity. YOLOv5s is smaller and faster but less performant
    from the perspective of accuracy compared to YOLOv5m, which exhibits a robust
    architecture and a high level of accuracy, but the major disadvantage being the
    increased time used for computation and training. The hyperparameters were changed
    considering the performance of the training process, as follows: The first training
    session was conducted with a learning rate of 0.1, a batch size of 8, and the
    total number of epochs was set to 100. In the following sessions, only one parameter
    was changed, while the rest of the values remained unaltered (e.g., Session 2:
    learning rate 0.05, batch size 8, epochs 100), thus obtaining a clear idea of
    the best configuration of parameters for the obtention of the best model accuracy.
    The configurations were tested with the two versions of the YOLOv5 model and with
    both SGDM and Adam optimizers. The training sessions were performed on a NVIDIA
    RTX A2000 GPU utilizing Python 3.11 and the Pytorch library (2.0.1 + cu117). 2.3.3.
    TCP/IP Connection Due to the reduced computational resources of the Hololens 2
    device, the system was established on the TCP/IP (Transmission Control Protocol/Internet
    Protocol) communication protocol presented in Figure 8. This was prompted by the
    fact that several trained networks were tested by direct implementation on the
    Hololens 2 device, but none had satisfactory results in terms of real-time detection,
    which imposed the transfer of the inference process on the computer (running as
    a server). Figure 8. Schematic representation of TCP/IP communication, including
    the server located on the PC, the Hololens device, and the communication between
    them based on TCP/IP communication. Taking into account the high resource requirements
    for real-time detection, the server was setup on a PC (CPU Intel® Core™ i9-12900KS
    and Nvidia RTX A2000 GPU) and the client socket was established on Hololens. The
    workflow, therefore, was as follows: Python received frames as input from Hololens
    through streaming, with these being processed by YOLOv5m. After the detection
    process for a frame is completed, the output (bounding box coordinates) is sent
    to the Hololens, which displays them in the form of boxes. In addition to Python,
    the Unity Engine platform was also used. Considering that the Unity platform offers
    adequate support for AR applications, this environment was chosen to create the
    application, which incorporates both the client socket and the implementation
    of the drawing of the bounding box process. Furthermore, it also calibrates the
    boxes with the environment of the user and takes into account factors such as
    the offset between the camera of Hololens and the eyes of the user, the understanding
    of 3D space, and the box size. 3. Results The main purpose of this study was to
    create a real-time hazard detection system using AI algorithms meant to increase
    the safety of the patient and the efficiency of the surgical procedure. As a demonstration,
    the authors selected the intra-operative hemorrhage which, if left uncontrolled,
    can have drastic consequences. The YOLOv5 algorithm has been identified as the
    best option with respect to the performance criteria for this specific task. Furthermore,
    in order to illustrate the cross-platform capabilities of the solution, the Hololens
    2 device was selected as the AR device. Once the training period was over, the
    results retrieved for each individual configuration were analyzed in order to
    determine the optimal configuration for this type of task. The configuration which
    achieved the highest level of accuracy is highlighted in Table 1 (blue color).
    As seen in Figure 9, with the configuration presented above, the detection performance
    of the model achieved the values summarized in Table 2. Figure 9. Detection performance
    of YOLOv5m using the box-loss value associated with bounding box predictions,
    obj_loss based on the predicted loss score, and the ground truth label, precision,
    recall, and mean average precision (thresholds of IoU starting from 0.5 and increasing
    to 0.95). Table 2. Detection performance of YOLOv5m. The model was tested using
    the IoU (Intersection of Union) method with a threshold value set to 0.45. Figure
    10 and Figure 11 present the bounding boxes and the confidence of the detection
    seen through Hololens. It can be noticed that the algorithm is capable of detecting
    the bleeding both in its incipient phase and as it progresses (if it is not stopped).

    The confidence of the detection was 75%. Figure 11. Bleeding detection displayed
    on the Hololens 2 device. The average detection time was below one second which,
    for this type of event, can be considered real time. 4. Discussion Robotic-assisted
    single-incision surgery is a complex procedure that demands innovative approaches
    to enhance its efficiency and to ensure patient safety. This requires the use
    of new technologies to optimize the surgical intervention. With the goal of improving
    efficiency, advancements in robotic technology enable precise and controlled movements
    during the surgical procedure. By utilizing robotic structures with enhanced dexterity
    and accuracy, surgeons can perform intricate maneuvers with greater ease. These
    robotic systems often incorporate real-time imaging and feedback mechanisms, providing
    surgeons with a comprehensive view of the surgical site and enhancing their ability
    to make informed decisions. The continuous advancements in technology and medicine
    have paved the way for synergistic outcomes in surgical interventions. Considering
    the substantial risk of bleeding, especially in oncological surgery, it becomes
    imperative to create a system in which bleeding can be quickly detected, contained,
    and stopped. While intraoperative bleeding (hemorrhages) can be a major problem
    in most surgical interventions, it has become even more critical in oncologic
    surgery due to the higher incidence. Cancer patients are more exposed to this
    risk based on multiple causes: Neo-adjuvant treatments. Very often, cancer patients
    undergo chemotherapy and/or radiation therapy [37], targeting tumor shrinkage
    (turning an inoperable tumor into a manageable one), which has uncontrollable
    side effects on the neighboring tissues. Tumor location. As tumors have higher
    vascularity or location in the proximity of large blood vessels, the surgical
    intervention may often cause unwanted bleeding, which is more prone to uncontrollable
    hemorrhages [38]. Blood-thinning medication. As shown in [39], cancer patients
    have a 50% to 70% higher risk of bleeding compared to non-cancer patients (with
    the same anticoagulant). By harnessing the power of the latest technologies, such
    as AI and AR, the development of such a system becomes feasible, offering real-time
    detection and providing surgeons with critical information to effectively manage
    bleeding complications. The system presented in this paper aimed to address multiple
    issues in surgery: (1) to prove the real-time capabilities and efficiency of AI/AR
    systems, (2) to assess the quantity of information supplied to the surgeon, (3)
    to assess the level of “intrusion” of the system into the surgical intervention,
    (4) to evaluate the interaction between the surgeon and an interactive digital
    system throughout the surgery, and (5) to emphasize the potential role of AI/AR
    systems as hazard detectors in the improvement of patient safety and surgical
    outcomes. The findings of this study demonstrated the successful utilization of
    the YOLOv5 algorithm for blood detection, offering key features such as speed,
    accuracy, and tracking capabilities. These characteristics play a crucial role
    in effectively addressing the requirements of blood detection in surgical procedures.
    The YOLOv5 algorithm proved to be highly efficient in swiftly identifying bleedings
    in real time, enabling timely interventions in critical situations. Its accuracy
    in detecting hemorrhages ensures reliable results, thus reducing the risk of false
    negatives or false positives. Additionally, the algorithm’s tracking capability
    allows for continuous monitoring of the bleeding, facilitating the assessment
    of its progression and enabling appropriate intervention strategies. The speed
    of the YOLOv5 algorithm is of utmost importance in surgical settings, where immediate
    action is often necessary to mitigate bleeding complications. Its ability to quickly
    process and analyze video data streamlines the detection process, providing prompt
    alerts to surgeons and enabling them to take timely measures to address the bleeding.
    Incorporating the Hololens 2 device as a valuable component of the system further
    enhanced its capabilities alongside the Artificial Intelligence algorithms. This
    device offers a distinct advantage by providing augmented information that supplements
    the surgeon’s natural field of view through image superposition. By seamlessly
    overlaying digital information onto the surgeon’s visual perception, the Hololens
    2 device enriches the surgical experience, offering real-time insights, anatomical
    guidance, and critical data that may not be readily visible to the naked eye.
    A possible scenario involves several Hololens 2 devices being connected to the
    same server, enabling several members of the medical team to have simultaneous
    access to the information. In this way, the surgical team can decide who is viewing
    this additional information (hazard detection) without necessarily displaying
    it on the main surgeon’s console, allowing the assistant surgeon to decide whether
    to warn the principal surgeon on the identified hazard or not. While Hololens
    2 offers numerous advantages for the medical field, it is crucial to critically
    assess its limitations, particularly its constrained hardware capacity, which
    poses challenges for developing standalone applications. One notable drawback
    is the difficulty in creating self-contained applications. For instance, a bleeding
    detection system was tested on the Hololens 2 device as a standalone application,
    thus eliminating the need for a server. Various approaches were explored to implement
    the algorithm on the device, including multi-threading, frame processing, and
    utilizing a smaller model. However, despite these attempts, the time required
    for detection using the installed application was significantly prolonged, rendering
    it impractical for real-time detection. The system can be improved in the future
    by incorporating functions to detect other major or unwanted events that may occur
    during surgery; for example, analyzing the quality of sutures or monitoring small
    surgical objects (e.g., clips) dropped inside the patient, while also indicating
    the location where they have fallen (although these cases are very rare, they
    can have critical consequences). With an emphasis on high-risk procedures such
    as curative or palliative tumor resections, future research and improvement of
    this tool can prove beneficial to all forms of robotic-assisted surgery and even
    in manual, minimally invasive surgery, with excellent outcomes for all patients.
    5. Conclusions The continuous advancements in technology and medicine have enabled
    the achievement of synergies with real positive outcomes for surgical interventions.
    Considering both the complexity of SILS procedures, performed with a master–slave
    structure as the one presented in this paper, and the frequency of hemorrhages
    in these types of procedures, especially in people suffering from cancer, the
    authors proposed the use of AI algorithms integrated into an AR device (Hololens
    2) to serve as a real-time detector of intraoperative hazards. By analyzing multiple
    algorithms, the authors have identified YOLOv5 as a good candidate for real-time
    detection of abnormalities, displaying a very good accuracy, a sufficient prediction
    efficiency, and very good response times, with all the above having been tested
    in the detection of intraoperative bleeding. The system underwent testing for
    both early-stage bleeding and advanced bleeding scenarios. The results indicated
    that the detection times and accuracy were deemed optimal, enabling the system
    to be effectively utilized for real-time bleeding detection, encouraging, at the
    same time, its further development. Author Contributions Conceptualization, G.R.,

    Open access 21 March 2024 1 Introduction Providing food for the growing population
    is a major challenge, especially in regions with limited water resources that
    are already facing continuous drought. Hence, optimizing water management in different
    fields, particularly for agriculture and irrigation, is necessary to gain optimal
    yield without water loss [1]. In hydrological research and field management, accurate
    prediction of crop water requirements is required for agricultural water supervision
    and irrigation planning while also conserving water resources, especially in arid
    and semi-arid regions with high agricultural water consumption [2, 3]. A significant
    aspect in the development of irrigation water scheduling is crop coefficient (Kc),
    which is principally affected by the characteristics such as crop height, leaf
    area index, and greenness degree [4]. Therefore, the ability to accurately predict
    Kc at various crop development periods will further enhance the water-use efficiency
    of a crop to manage the irrigation water consumption [3]. According to Allen et
    al. [5], crop coefficients describe the one-of-a-kind variations between the reference
    evapotranspiration (ET0) and studied crops in terms of crop evapotranspiration
    (ETc). Because of its simplicity, the single crop coefficient technique is employed
    for most irrigation planning, design, and management applications, as addressed
    and summarized in the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) publication. Several
    methods were developed to calculate crop coefficient, including FAO-56 standard
    [5], hydraulic weighing lysimeter [6,7,8], FAO dual Kc methodologies [9,10,11],
    water balance [12,13,14], mathematical equations involving climatic, crop, and
    soil moisture variables [15], and watermarks and an atmometer [16]. The lysimeter
    and soil water balance approaches can be used to measure Kc directly [17]. Still,
    they are time-consuming, costly for applying technologies in large regions, and
    provide poor spatial representativeness of measurements. However, many researchers
    used lysimetric tests to evaluate the crop coefficients and to correlate them
    to those testified by FAO-56 reports [2, 18]. After that, for decades, remote
    sensing approaches have been enhanced to calculate crop coefficients at various
    locations [19, 20]. An artificial neural network (ANN) is the most common machine
    learning system that is widely used in different studies related to water requirement
    researches, such as transpiration [21], evapotranspiration [22,23,24], Pan evaporation
    [25,26,27,28], and crop coefficient [29, 30]. It can model complex and nonlinear
    systems due to self-organization, self-adaptation, and self-learning characteristics
    without the need to understand their existing internal control structure [31,
    32]. Elbeltagi et al. [30] assessed the Kc of maize crop using ANN models from
    2006 to 2016 at four Egyptian governorate locations. The findings indicated that
    the best model and correlation coefficients for prediction Kc have an accuracy
    close to one. Saggi and Jain [33] used fuzzy-genetic (FG) and regularization random
    forest (RRF) models to create an innovative multilevel model for estimating Kc.
    The findings from this study can be helpful to other locations with similar Kc
    for crop selection and optimal water use. This study aim is to explore the predictive
    capability of the multilayer perceptron (MLP) model by applying it to Kc and meteorological
    data. Also, the present study further aims to extract a helpful equation from
    the hybrid MLP-optimization algorithms prediction of the monthly Kc. The review
    of available studies reveals any effort was not made to find equations fitting
    Kc curves in all growth stages of plants. This objective can be easily expressed
    using the ANN model. Therefore, it is vital to develop robust, stable, and accurate
    approaches for the explicit derivation of novel predictive Kc equations in optimized
    ANN models regarding the readily accessible meteorological variables. This study
    makes an effort to derive a unique and exact tansig-based equation for calculating
    monthly Kc in different maize growth stages. This equation has the advantage to
    easily used by everyone while includes more effective meteorological variables
    which are readily available. It will extend our technical knowledge into the applicability
    of the white-box status of the optimized ANN model over the black-box to compute
    an intelligence-based Kc [34]. With the development of meta-heuristic optimization
    algorithms, hybridizing procedures of machine learning-optimization algorithms
    have increasingly been utilized in different studies to enhance model predictions.
    It is evident from the literature that hybrid models have a high capability to
    give the most accurate models’ parameters. Derivation of complex nonlinear equations
    between output and input variables has become possible and simple by using the
    ANN model [35]. The hybrid machine learning-optimization algorithm models have
    a complex structure and can produce some uncertainty in predictions. The reliability
    of predictions by hybrid models is affected by model and parameter uncertainties
    [36, 37]. Despite the popularity of hybrid optimization models for hydrological
    processes prediction, to the best of our knowledge, the assessment of hybrid model
    accuracy in predicting monthly Kc and uncertainty associated with those has been
    disregarded. With this viewpoint, the generalized likelihood uncertainty estimation
    (GLUE) was used for model structure uncertainty and parameter uncertainty analysis
    to quantify the reliability and stability of the models. In light of the above
    explanations, the major contributions and novelty of the developed framework in
    the current study are summarized as follows: 1- Applying new intelligent optimized
    hybrid models (MLP-RSO, MLP-BA, MLP-FFA, MLP-GA) for modeling crop coefficient
    in the semi-arid region in Egypt. 2- The innovation is providing explicit model
    equations for calculating Kc using the most important and readily accessible meteorological
    variables via the best optimal GT solution. 3- Analyzing the developed models’
    parameters and models’ structure uncertainties for predicting Kc using the GLUE
    technique. 4- Develop hybrid gamma test (GT)-RSO for selecting the best input
    combination from eight input meteorological variables. 2 Materials and methods
    2.1 Study area The research region was in Egypt''s Nile Delta. The Egyptian Nile
    Delta is located in northern Egypt, where the Nile River empties into the Mediterranean
    Sea. The Nile Delta encompasses approximately 2% of Egypt''s land area but accounts
    for almost 63% of its agricultural land. The average yearly maximum air temperature
    is 24 °C, while the annual average lowest air temperature is 16 °C. Wind speeds
    ranged from 3.8 to 5.2 m/s, the rainy season began in October, and around 75%
    of the total rainfall fell between November and February. The rainiest months
    are December and January [38, 39]. As indicated in Fig. 1, four governorates are
    chosen in the Nile Delta. In this study, the maize crop was used. According to
    FAO, the maize crop was planted and harvested from May to October. Fig. 1 Map
    of the study area Full size image 2.2 Datasets Monthly data (from May to October)
    of minimum air temperature (Tmin), maximum air temperature (Tmax), mean air temperature
    (Tmean), solar radiation (Rs), wind speed (WS), and vapor pressure deficit (VPD),
    including 720 data for each governorate (study location), were extracted from
    open access data using ESRI''s ArcGIS software with latitude/longitude of 4 km
    grid cell center from 2000 to 2020 (Table 1). In addition, data on sunshine hours
    (SH) and relative humidity (RH), including 240 data for each governorate, were
    gathered from World Weather Online (WorldWeatherOnline.com) and Wunderground (wunderground.com)
    sites [40, 41]. Data for the worldwide land surface''s average maximum and minimum
    temperatures were obtained in NetCDF format from Climatic Research Unit Ts 4.0
    on a 0.5° grid [42]. Furthermore, Rs, WS, and VPD data were obtained in NetCDF
    format from the Japanese 55-year Reanalysis JRA-55 at a 1.25° grid [43]. Standard
    monthly Kc values, including 120 data for each governorate, were obtained from
    FAO-56 documentation. Overall, the datasets provided in this study consist 4320
    records of nine variables for all governorates. For exploring the impact of resolution
    differences on prediction, we have performed quantitative assessment and comparison
    for the different studied locations. The nonuniform data resolution did not affect
    the prediction. First, all the climatic variables from a specific (uniform) climate
    data station (world weather online) were adopted to estimate the deviation between
    these obtained data and those with different spatial resolution such as CRU and
    AJR. Several statistical approaches (descriptive analysis, analysis of variance
    (ANOVA), and model summary) were conducted for quantitative assessment. Second,
    these analyses were carried out for the four locations in the study area. It is
    shown that there is a high significance between the remote sensing-based values
    with different resolutions and those with uniform stations, which is proved by
    the lowest standard deviation and a high coefficient of determination for each
    climate variable. In fact, the nonuniform data resolution has not been proved
    to significantly affect the prediction in this study. Table 1 Meteorological variables
    characteristics of study locations Full size table According to FAO-56''s standard
    conditions (sufficient water supply, good management practices, and good growth),
    the crop coefficients of summer maize were suggested as Kcini(Tab) = 0.45 (the
    initial stage), Kcmid(Tab) = 1.2 (the middle stage), and Kcend(Tab) = 0.5 for
    initial, middle, and late stages, respectively. A linear difference was used to
    calculate the median. The values of Kcmid and Kcend can be adjusted according
    to different local climatic conditions as [3, 5, 44]: $${K}_{\\mathrm{cmid}-\\mathrm{FAO}56}={K}_{\\mathrm{cmid}(\\mathrm{Tab})}+\\left[0.04\\left({u}_{2}-2\\right)-0.004\\left({\\mathrm{RH}}_{\\mathrm{min}}-45\\right)\\right]{\\left(h/3\\right)}^{0.3}$$
    (1) $${K}_{\\mathrm{cend}-\\mathrm{FAO}56}={K}_{\\mathrm{cend}(\\mathrm{Tab})}+\\left[0.04\\left({u}_{2}-2\\right)-0.004\\left({\\mathrm{RH}}_{\\mathrm{min}}-45\\right)\\right]{\\left(h/3\\right)}^{0.3}$$
    (2) where u2 is the wind speed in 2 m height over grass during the growth stage
    and h is the average height of the plant in the two stages of middle and late.
    From Table 1, the Ad Dakahliyah and Al-Ismailiyah have the lowest and highest
    temperature variations (based on the Tmax, Tmin, and Tmean variables), respectively.
    Ash sharkiyah experienced the lowest average WS = 1.48 m s−1, which was more than
    2 m s−1 in other studied locations. The average SH of the Al-Gharbiyah (equal
    to 10.49 h) was almost one hour more than other studied locations. Also, the correlation
    matrixes between the input variables and output (Kc) are given in Appendix. As
    seen from Table 10, the highest correlation is obtained between Kc and Tmin in
    all studied locations, followed by Tmean. The VPD had the lowest correlation with
    Kc, and the correlation between Kc and WS was negative. For this study, different
    datasets were designed randomly and exanimated for the modeling process. The results
    showed that the subset of 70% for training and 30% for testing provides the lowest
    error in developing predictive models. 2.3 Generalized likelihood uncertainty
    estimation (GLUE) Uncertainty analysis of models is an appropriate tool to investigate
    predictive model stability and reliability. The GLUE analysis used in the present
    study has four main stages [36, 45]: 1- Numerous random sets are generated using
    Monte Carlo simulation from prior distributions. 2- The model is run using datasets,
    and a likelihood value is calculated for each parameter using Eq. 3. For this,
    the initial simulations from prior distributions are divided into two categories
    behavioral and nonbehavioral. If the variable’s value is more than the threshold
    likelihood, it recognizes behavioral. Behavioral simulations are used to evaluate
    the models. $$L\\left({\\theta }_{i}|{K}_{c}\\right)=\\mathit{exp}\\left[\\frac{-N{\\sigma
    }_{i}^{2}}{{\\sigma }_{{K}_{c}\\mathrm{obs}}^{2}}\\right]$$ (3) where \\({\\theta
    }_{i}\\) is the parameter set, \\({K}_{\\mathrm{c}}\\) is actual crop coefficients,
    \\(L\\left({\\theta }_{i}|{K}_{c}\\right)\\) is the likelihood measure for the
    ith model that is calculated using actual Kc, N is the shaping parameter, \\({\\sigma
    }_{i}^{2}\\) is the error variance for the ith model, and \\({\\sigma }_{{K}_{c}\\mathrm{obs}}^{2}\\)
    is the variance of actual Kc. 3- Simulation weights are rescaled for behavioral
    parameter sets, and the likelihood weight is calculated by Eq. 4 for uncertainty
    prediction:where \\({\\vartheta }_{i}\\) is a likelihood weight, and n is the
    number of data. $${\\vartheta }_{i}=\\frac{L\\left({\\theta }_{i}\\right)}{{\\sum
    }_{k=1}^{n}L\\left({\\theta }_{k}\\right)}$$ (4) The uncertainty of models was
    assessed using two indices of p and r for investigating the percentage of observed
    data bracketed by 95% prediction uncertainty (95PPU) and the mean 95PPU range
    (distance between upper and lower 95PPU), respectively, as following equations:
    $$p=100\\frac{c\\mathrm{ount}\\left({K}_{\\mathrm{c}}|{{K}_{\\mathrm{c}}}_{\\mathrm{L}95\\mathrm{PPU}}\\le
    {K}_{\\mathrm{c}}\\le {{K}_{\\mathrm{c}}}_{\\mathrm{U}95\\mathrm{PPU}}\\right)}{N}$$
    (5) $$r=\\frac{1}{n\\times \\sigma }\\sum_{i=1}^{n}{({{K}_{\\mathrm{c}}}_{\\mathrm{U}95\\mathrm{PPU}}-{{K}_{\\mathrm{c}}}_{\\mathrm{L}95\\mathrm{PPU}})}_{i}$$
    (6) where n is the number of observed data points, \\(\\sigma\\) is the standard
    deviation of observed Kc, and \\({{K}_{c}}_{L95\\mathrm{PPU}}\\) and \\({{K}_{c}}_{U95\\mathrm{PPU}}\\)
    are the upper and lower boundary of the 95PPU, respectively. 2.4 Machine learning
    and optimization models used 2.4.1 Multilayer perceptron (MLP) algorithm A neural
    network takes the form of multiple layers, each of which has a certain number
    of neurons, where the minimum number of layers is three: the input layer, the
    output layer, and the hidden layer (or layers). Each neuron in each layer communicates
    with the neurons of the previous and subsequent layers. Any neuron in these layers
    expresses a mathematical function that calculates a specific value. MLP is one
    of the most popular ANN models [46]. MLP has multi-layers and uses backpropagation
    algorithm for adjusting its parameters. The backpropagation algorithms find the
    proper values of parameters based on minimizing difference between observed and
    estimated data. In the current study, the optimization methods were chosen based
    on their novelty, which is classified among the new meta-heuristics methods that
    made a successful revolution in resolving engineering problems in the last decade
    [47,48,49,50]. In addition, the efficiency of powerful optimization algorithms
    such as RSO [51] was not assessed in the agriculture field, especially for crop
    coefficient prediction. In addition, the proposed algorithms of the RSO, BA, and
    FFA are not greedy algorithms. The individuals (rats, microbats, fireflies) move
    to the new position even if the new position is not better than its current position.
    Non-greedy algorithms can lead to a greater variety of solutions [52]. This study,
    as the first step of the authors'' research, will open a new path to show hybridizing
    optimization algorithms and machine learning methods for predictions appearing
    more potent than standalone machine learning models. 2.4.2 Rat swarm optimization
    (RSO) Rat swarm optimization (RSO) is a nature-inspired algorithm first proposed
    by Dhiman et al. [51]. RSO constructed based on the behaviors of attacking and
    chasing rats in nature. It used a simple conceptual mode, which makes it easy
    to implement. RSO can give the fittest solutions for challenging optimization
    problems based on the ‘trial-and-error’ criterion (Fig. 2). RSO depends on the
    behavior of chasing and fighting with prey. In the first step, the model assumes
    that the rats hunt the prey as a group with social agonistic behavior, and one
    of the rats (search agent) has the best knowledge of the position of target. The
    other rats can update their location according to the best search agent (first
    rat) obtained so far [51]. Chasing the prey formulation is given by: $$\\overrightarrow{P}=A
    . \\overrightarrow{{P}_{i}}\\left(x\\right)+C. (\\overrightarrow{{P}_{r}}\\left(x\\right)-\\overrightarrow{{P}_{i}}\\left(x\\right))$$
    (7) where \\(\\overrightarrow{{P}_{i}}\\left(x\\right)\\) is the rat position
    and \\(\\overrightarrow{{P}_{r}}\\left(x\\right)\\) is the best and optimal solution,
    where \\(x=\\mathrm{1,2},\\dots ,{\\mathrm{Max}}_{\\mathrm{iteration}}\\). Fig.
    2 Schematic diagram representing the general approaches of the developed method
    Full size image In addition, C and A are parameters calculated as follows: $$A=R-x
    \\times \\left[\\frac{R}{{\\mathrm{Max}}_{\\mathrm{Iteration}}}\\right]$$ (8)
    where C and R are random numbers responsible for best exploitation and exploration
    during the iterations process ranging [0, 2] and [1, 5], respectively [51]. In
    the next step, fighting with prey is given by the following mathematics formula:
    $${\\overrightarrow{P}}_{i}(x+1)=\\left|{\\overrightarrow{P}}_{r}(x)-\\overrightarrow{P}\\right|$$
    (9) where \\({\\overrightarrow{P}}_{i}\\left(x+1\\right)\\) defines the updated
    next position of the rat. It will record as optimal solution and updates the locations
    of other rats (search agents) according to the best search agent. 2.4.3 Bat algorithm
    (BA) BA can quickly arrive at a local optimum based on the premature convergence
    problem characteristic. The algorithm was first introduced by Yang [53]. BA concept
    is based on microbats echolocation, which uses solar-emitted waves. This process
    helps bats to find their prey and distinguish any form of obstacles that are facing
    in complete darkness (Fig. 2). According to the BA, the bats have a velocity flying
    Vi and position Xi; each Vi and Xi have a specific frequency (f) and loudness
    (ai) to get prey, where pulse emission r characterizes each frequency f [54].
    When the bat is close to the target, loudness decreases, and pulse increases.
    The mathematical equations of BA are given as follows: $${f}_{i}= {f}_{\\mathrm{min}}+\\left({f}_{\\mathrm{max}}-{f}_{\\mathrm{min}}\\right)\\upbeta$$
    (10) $${v}_{i}^{t}= {v}_{i}^{t-1}+\\left({x}_{i}^{t}-{x}_{*}\\right) {f}_{i}$$
    (11) where t is the max iteration (limit), \\(\\beta\\) is a random vector ranging
    between [0, 1], \\({f}_{\\mathrm{min}}\\) and \\({f}_{\\mathrm{max}}\\) are the
    maximum and minimum frequency for each bat, respectively, and \\(x\\) is the best
    solution (global) obtained by comparing the position of all the bats to the prey
    at each iteration. Before updating the positions of all bats, a new random number
    \\(\\beta\\) will be generated with respect to \\(\\beta\\) that must be less
    than pulse emission ri, $${x}_{new}= {x}_{old}+\\xi {A}^{t}$$ (12) where \\(\\xi\\)
    is a random number in the range of [-1, 1] and \\({A}^{t}\\) is the average amplitude
    of all bats at time t. 2.4.4 Firefly algorithm (FFA) In FFA, fireflies generate
    light to protect themselves from enemies, select their mates, and exchange information
    with them (Fig. 2). The first basic of the FFA is the attraction of flies that
    is based on their genders. To get the best results, all flies must be unisex.
    According to the light intensity, the flies will attract them (second rule). In
    the last rule, the brightness or the light intensity of the fireflies is decided
    [55,56,57]. The main task for developing FFA is calculating two factors of light
    intensity I(r), the attractiveness (β) as well as the distance between two fireflies
    of i and j (rij): $$I\\left(r\\right)={I}_{0}\\mathrm{exp}\\left(-\\gamma {r}^{2}\\right)$$
    (13) $$\\beta \\left(r\\right)={\\beta }_{0} \\mathrm{exp}\\left(-\\gamma {r}^{2}\\right)$$
    (14) $${r}_{ij}=\\Vert {x}_{i}-{x}_{j}\\Vert =\\sqrt{\\sum_{k=1}^{d}({x}_{i}^{k}-{x}_{j}^{k})}$$
    (15) where \\({x}_{i}^{k}\\) is the kth component of the spatial coordinate \\({x}_{i}\\)
    of the ith firefly, γ is the light absorption coefficient, r is the distance,
    k is a random number of the flies, and d is the dimensionality of a given problem,
    \\({I}_{0}\\) is the initial light intensity, \\({\\beta }_{0}\\) is the attractiveness
    at distance r = 0. The next movement of firefly i is given by the following equations:
    $${x}_{i}^{k}\\left(t+1\\right)={x}_{i}^{k}\\left(t\\right)+{\\beta }_{0}\\mathrm{exp}\\left(-{\\gamma
    r}_{ij}^{2}\\right)\\left({x}_{j}^{k}-{x}_{i}^{k}(t)\\right)+\\alpha {\\in }_{i}$$
    (16) where α is the randomization parameter in the range of (0, 1), and \\( {\\in
    }_{i}\\) is the random number vector derived from a Gaussian distribution. 2.5
    Gamma test for selecting the most influential input combination Selecting appropriate
    input variables for modeling is a challenging process, especially for nonlinear
    dynamic systems. For model development, it has been challenging to determine which
    inputs to use and how long the training data should be. Gamma test (GT) is a nonparametric
    and feature selection method that most used as a pre-processing procedure to determine
    a suitable input combination for nonlinear and complex models. The GT would reduce
    the workload for developing nonlinear models since the models would take an enormous
    number of trial-and-error iterations [58]. Ahmadi et al. [58] reported that conventional
    input selection model of AIC/BIC failed to recognize solar radiation functionality
    than the GT and entropy theory methods. Noori et al. [59] showed that the GT-ANN
    model could effectively reduce the number of input variables for predicting solid
    waste, while producing more effective results than ANN. The selected models with
    the least Vratio (close to zero) and gamma value (Γ) (close to zero) are considered
    better for the model [60]. The main steps of GT describe as follows: (1) For the
    input set of x and corresponding output data of y, the data sample considers as
    \\(\\left\\{{x}_{i}\\left(i\\right),\\dots ,{x}_{m}\\left(i\\right),{y}_{i}\\right\\}=\\left\\{\\left({x}_{i},{y}_{i}\\right)|1\\le
    i\\le M\\right\\}\\) with m input variables and M patterns. (2) The delta function
    calculates as \\({\\Delta }_{M}\\left(k\\right)=\\frac{1}{M}\\sum_{i=1}^{M}{\\left|{x}_{N[i,k]}-{x}_{i}\\right|}^{2}
    \\left(1\\le k\\le p\\right)\\), where |…| is the Euclidean distance and \\(N{\\left[i,k\\right]}_{1\\le
    k\\le p}\\) is the kth nearest neighbors for each \\({x}_{i}\\) vector. (3) The
    gamma function calculates as \\({\\gamma }_{M}\\left(k\\right)=\\frac{1}{2M}\\sum_{i=1}^{M}{\\left|{y}_{N[i,k]}-{y}_{i}\\right|}^{2}
    \\left(1\\le k\\le p\\right)\\), where \\({y}_{N[i,k]}\\) is corresponding yi
    value for the kth nearest neighbors of xi. (4) The gamma value of Γ calculates
    by drawing the least-square regression line of \\(\\gamma =A\\Delta +\\Gamma\\)
    for points of \\([{\\Delta }_{M}\\left(k\\right),{\\gamma }_{M}\\left(k\\right)]\\),
    where A is the least-square regression line slope. (5) The Vratio index calculates
    as \\({V}_{\\mathrm{rati}o}=\\frac{\\Gamma }{{\\sigma }^{2}(y)}\\), where \\({\\sigma
    }^{2}(y)\\) denotes the target outputs variance. The input meteorological variables
    of Tmax, Tmin, Tmean, RH, Rs, WS, SH, and VPD are used for constructing the input
    data matrix. With eight input variables, there are \\({2}^{N}-1={2}^{8}-1=255\\)
    meaningful input combinations, and also the \\(\\varGamma\\) values should be
    calculated for four studied locations (\\(255\\times 4=1020\\)). Calculating \\(\\varGamma\\)
    values for 255 input combinations and selecting the lowest \\(\\varGamma\\) need
    extra effort. Hence, the GT integrated with the RSO technique (GT-RSO) to automatically
    select the best input vector for each region. 2.6 Statistical performance metrics
    In order to evaluate the performance of each scenario, four criteria were used.
    The quantitative criteria were mean absolute error (MAE), percent bias (PBIAS),
    root-mean-square error (RMSE), and Nash–Sutcliffe Efficiency (NSE). In addition,
    the time-series plot, scatter heat plot, and Taylor diagram were used for the
    graphical interpretation of the results. $$\\mathrm{MAE}=\\frac{1}{N}\\sum_{i=1}^{N}\\left|{K}_{c,\\mathrm{Obs}}-{K}_{c,\\mathrm{Sim}}\\right|,
    0<\\mathrm{MAE}<\\infty ,\\,\\,\\mathrm{ Optimal\\,\\,value}=0$$ (17) $$\\mathrm{PBIAS}=\\frac{\\sum_{i=1}^{N}\\left({K}_{c,\\mathrm{Obs}}-{K}_{c,\\mathrm{Sim}}\\right)}{\\sum_{i=1}^{N}\\left({K}_{c,\\mathrm{Obs}}\\right)},
    -\\infty <\\mathrm{RMSE}<\\infty ,\\mathrm{ Optimal \\,\\,value}=0$$ (18) $$\\mathrm{RMSE}=\\sqrt{\\frac{\\sum_{\\mathrm{i}=1}^{\\mathrm{N}}{\\left({K}_{\\mathrm{c},\\mathrm{Obs}}-{K}_{\\mathrm{c},\\mathrm{Sim}}\\right)}^{2}}{N}},
    0<\\mathrm{RMSE}<\\infty ,\\mathrm{ Optimal\\,\\,value}=0$$ (19) $$\\mathrm{NSE}=1-\\frac{\\sum_{\\mathrm{i}=1}^{\\mathrm{N}}{\\left({K}_{\\mathrm{c},\\mathrm{Obs}}-{K}_{\\mathrm{c},\\mathrm{Sim}}\\right)}^{2}}{\\sum_{\\mathrm{i}=1}^{\\mathrm{N}}{\\left({K}_{\\mathrm{c},\\mathrm{Obs}}-\\overline{{K
    }_{\\mathrm{c},\\mathrm{Obs}}}\\right)}^{2}}, -\\infty <\\mathrm{NSE}\\le 1,\\mathrm{
    Optimal\\,\\,value}=1$$ (20) where \\({K}_{c,\\mathrm{Obs}}\\) is the ith observed
    crop coefficient data, \\(\\overline{{K }_{c,\\mathrm{Obs}}}\\) is the mean of
    the observed crop coefficient data, \\({K}_{c,\\mathrm{Sim}}\\) is the ith simulated
    crop coefficient data, N is the total number of observations. 2.7 The framework
    of the study The GT-RSO selects random input combinations from Tmax, Tmin, Tmean,
    RH, Rs, WS, SH, and VPD variables and calculates the objective function of \\(\\varGamma\\).
    Finally, the GT-RSO model ranks the input combinations by minimizing an objective
    function using the outputs of the GT technique (Γ and Vratio). Four optimization
    algorithms of RSO, FFA, BA, and GA were used to robust train of MLP model. In
    previous studies, these algorithms were successfully used. The RSO has been suggested
    by Salgotra and Singh [61] to find optimal values of parameters of soft computing
    models. The BA was used by Milosevic et al. [62] to find the optimal weight connection
    values. Based on finding optimal values of ANN parameters, the BA could improve
    the accuracy of ANN models. Bui et al. [63] reported that FFA was capable of finding
    optimal ANN parameters. Tamilarasan et al. [64] recommended RSO to determine optimal
    hyperparameter values. The values of bias and weight connections for the MLP model
    were optimized using RSO, BA, FFA, and GAs with a random selection of agents and
    determined each individual’s position. The input vectors were trained using hybrid
    models. The initial values of the parameters were considered as the initial positions
    of individuals. The RMSE was used as an objective function to verify model accuracy
    and find optimal values of model parameters. The accuracy of developed hybrid
    models is sensitive to control parameter values of optimization algorithms [65].
    The random parameters of optimization algorithms are designed and determined using
    sensitivity analysis to enhance model performance. The sensitivity analysis is
    performed for accessing optimal values of optimization parameters. For this, the
    objective function of RMSE is calculated to select the final value. A smaller
    value of RMSE indicates that the value of the corresponding optimization parameter
    has a more important degree for improving the hybrid models. In this study, the
    decision variables were weight connections, bias values, number of hidden layers,
    and number of hidden neurons. For each of the decision variables, a population
    matrix is defined. The location of optimization agents shows the decision variables.
    The MLP parameters are encoded before starting the optimization process. The algorithm
    operators are used to update the location of agents. By updating the location
    of agents, the values of parameters are updated. The MLP parameters were decoded
    when the stop condition was met. The optimal number of hidden neurons and layers
    was determined using optimization algorithms and objective functions. As a result,
    the modeling process achieves the optimal network size so that its structure will
    not be too large. After constructing standalone and hybrid models of MLP, MLP-RSO,
    MLP-BA, MLP-FFA, and MLP-GA and estimating monthly Kc using simple available meteorological
    variables, the GLUE was investigated, and evaluation criteria were calculated.
    The best model was selected and the equations were constructed using those for
    all studied regions. Modeling was carried out using MATLAB software in this study.
    A detailed methodological framework is given in Fig. 2. 3 Results and discussion
    In this section, the accuracy of developed hybrid and standalone models is assessed
    as follows. 3.1 Input combination selection using hybrid GT-RSO Four top input
    combinations based on the hybrid GT-RSO method for each region are given in Table
    2. It is clear that Tmax, Tmin, Rs with the lowest \\(\\varGamma\\) and Vratio
    values are the best input combination in all studied regions. Low values of \\(\\varGamma\\)
    and Vratio (close to zero) demonstrate a high level of predictability of the Kc
    by a smooth model [66]. It is evident that these variables considerably influence
    the Kc prediction in all studied regions. The variable of air temperature is considered
    the main and essential meteorological parameter of Kc prediction. The results
    of this study are in agreement with Elbeltagi et al. [30] that presented Tmin,
    Tmax, and Rs are the best input combination to predict Kc. In the next rank, Tmean,
    RH are an accurate alternative for Kc prediction in the Al-Ismailiyah and Ash
    sharkiyah regions, especially when there were no Rs data for several months. Also,
    in the Al-Gharbiyah, the meteorological variable of WS is an alternative for Rs.
    The variables of RH and WS can be easily measured in any region. Table 2 The best
    input combinations in studied regions Full size table 3.2 Identifying the optimization
    parameters There are four parameters in the RSO, FFA, and GA models that need
    to be optimized. In the BA optimization algorithm, six parameters should be optimized.
    Four different values of each optimization parameter are evaluated using sensitivity
    analysis. To assess the effect of each optimization parameter on the RMSE, optimizations
    are performed by varying one random parameter relative to other constant parameters
    [67]. The optimization results for the RSO algorithm are shown in Table 3, and
    the best results are recognized when the objective function of RMSE is minimized.
    For the RSO, FFA, and GA, four values of population size parameters are set as
    150, 300, 450, and 600. For the RSO, the population size of 300 produces better
    results for all studied regions than the other values, where the objective function
    of RMSE is obtained equal to 0.110, 0.115, 0.112, and 0.116 in Al-Gharbiyah, Ad
    Dakahliyah, Al-Ismailiyah, and Ash sharkiyah regions, respectively. The optimal
    random parameters of R, C, and the maximum number of iterations for the RSO algorithm
    are presented in Table 3. Consequently, the results of sensitivity analysis for
    determining the optimal value of random parameters of BA, FFA, and GA optimization
    are shown in Tables 4, 5, and 6, respectively. Table 7 displays the properties
    of the model setting for developed standalone and hybrid MLP. All models were
    constructed using one hidden layer, and the tangent sigmoid was used as an activation
    function. The MLP-RSO was trained with the highest hidden neurons (equal to 5)
    than other applied models. Table 3 The sensitivity analysis of random parameters

    best version of MLP models Full size table 3.3 Comparison of developed models
    As mentioned above, the input combination of Tmax, Tmin, Rs was used to predict
    Kc using the standalone MLP model and developed hybrid models by RSO, BA, FFA,
    and GAs. The performance results of developed models for predicting Kc in training
    and testing phases are given in Tables 8 and 9, respectively. It is evident from
    Table 8 that the MLP-RSO provides adequate precision for training over all other
    models due to low error criteria (RMSE, MAE, and PBIAS) and high NSE metric. In
    the testing phase, the MLP-RSO has the most accurate performance, locating a perfect
    range based on the NSE and PBIAS criteria. Based on the average PBIAS criteria
    in all studied locations, the Kc were underestimated using MLP-RSO (12%) and MLP
    (23%) models. The prediction error of MLP-RSO based on the RMSE (MAE) was obtained
    equal to 0.119 (0.1), 0.121 (0.11), 0.119 (0.117), and 0.119 (0.115) against those
    for MLP model equal to 0.278 (0.256), 0.276 (0.224), 0.221 (0.202), and 0.235
    (0.224) in Al-Gharbiyah, Ad Dakahliyah, Al-Ismailiyah, and Ash sharkiyah, respectively.
    Table 8 The performance comparison of different developed models in the training
    phase for the best input vector in each region Full size table Table 9 The performance
    comparison of different developed models in the testing phase for the best input
    vector in each region Full size table To evaluate the performance of the MLP-RSO
    model over other hybrid models, the percentage of improvement in predictions has
    been calculated. The RSO algorithm improved the performance of MLP more than the
    other meta-heuristic optimization algorithms. The RMSE metric of MLP-BA, MLP-FFA,
    and MLP-GA models increased in all regions by 11.2–16.6%, 37–43.9%, and 40.2–55.4%,
    respectively. The most improvement is obtained for MLP-RSO compared with MLP-BA,
    MLP-FFA, and MLP-GA by an increase of 3.4–18%, 32.8%- 40.1%, and 40.1%- 57.4%
    in MAE in four regions, respectively. It is clear that hybrid models performed
    better than the standalone MLP model in all regions. In comparison with MLP-RSO,
    the RMSE of the MLP model increased 58.5%, 56.2%, 46.2%, and 49.4% in Al-Gharbiyah,
    Ad Dakahliyah, Al-Ismailiyah, and Ash sharkiyah regions, respectively. Similar
    results are acquired in comparing MLP to the other hybrid MLP-BA, MLP-FFA, and
    MLP-GA models. The PBIAS of MLP-BA is increased by 12.5%-44% than the MLP-RSO
    model, and the NSE is reduced. Similarly, the accuracy of the hybrid MLP-RSO model
    considering PBIAS and NSE was higher than the other hybrid and standalone models.
    The Taylor diagram is plotted for evaluating developed hybrid and standalone models
    against the reference point (observed values). This diagram provides a graphical
    display of the location of developed models in prediction Kc against the actual
    Kc by considering the values of correlation coefficient (R), standard deviation
    (STD), and root-mean-square deviation (RMSD). In the Taylor diagram, the yellow
    radial lines show the R values, the red circular arcs indicate the STD, and the
    dash blue circular arcs show the RMSD values. The closer location of each developed
    model to that of the specific reference point represents the better efficiency
    of that model. According to Fig. 3, all models have almost similar and high accuracy
    in predicting Kc in the studied regions. However, the hybrid models are more successful
    than the standalone MLP model. The predictions were located between R lines of
    0.98 and 1, STD lines of 0.35 and 0.36, and RMSD lines of 0.005 and 0.1 for the
    Al-Gharbiyah. Also, the Kc predictions were grouped within the 0.98 and 1 of R
    lines, 0.34 and 0.35 of STD lines, 0.03 and 0.06 of RMSD lines at Ad Dakahliyah,
    within the 0.98 and 1 of R lines, 0.34 and 0.36 of STD lines, 0.03 and 0.07 of
    RMSD lines et al.-Ismailiyah, and within the 0.96 and 1 of R lines, 0.34 and 0.36
    of STD lines, 0.01 and 0.1 of RMSD lines at Ash sharkiyah. Among developed hybrid
    models, the results for the location of the MLP-RSO and MLP-BA with R > 0.99,
    RMSD < 0.05, and 0.34 < STD < 0.36 are close to the reference points of all regions.
    The hybrid model of MLP-RSO makes some improvement in the accuracy of standalone
    MLP for predicting Kc. Fig. 3 The Taylor diagrams of developed models for prediction
    of Kc in the studied regions Full size image For better visualization of the prediction
    performance of developed models, the trends of Kc for the year 2012 are given
    in Fig. 4. It can be observed from Fig. 4 that the MLP-RSO model included the
    actual growth status of the crop for modeling Kc. Hence the accuracy of the MLP-RSO
    predictions is higher than the other hybrid models in all regions. Compared with
    the MLP-RSO, the performances of MLP-FFA, MLP-BA, MLP-GA, and MLP models for predicting
    Kc trend are slightly low. Overall, the fitting accuracy of MLP-RSO model can
    be considered for the precision prediction of Kc. This model took into account
    the dynamic change of crop coefficient in the studied area. In the case of Kc,
    the values vary based on the crop development stages and climate conditions [68].
    So, this study confirms the capability of the hybrid MLP-RSO model for improved
    prediction of Kc. The model recognizes nonlinear and complex relationships between
    meteorological variables as input and Kc as output. In addition, the MLP-RSO model
    gives less restrictive functional forms assumptions for modeling the Kc process
    [3, 62]. Fig. 4 Compare predictive models and actual Kc values for studied regions
    in 2012 Full size image However, the results of Farg et al. [4] showed that the
    prediction of Kc by remote sensing can provide accurate values, but the performances
    were lower than developed models in the current study. Also, the comparison of
    the results of the current study against the results of Pôças et al. [20] showed
    a higher accuracy of the hybrid MLP-RSO model. In agreement with the results of
    the present study, Elbeltagi et al. [30] predicted accurate values of Kc by the
    ANN model, where the performance of the best ANN model based on the R2 was close
    to 1. Pereira et al. [70] and Pereira et al. [71] estimated Kc from the crop height
    and fraction of ground cover parameters for different trees, vine crops, vegetables,
    field crops, and grassland. The results showed good agreement between A&P [72]
    predictions with those values obtained from field measurements and remote sensing
    data. However, those results were not better than the MLP-RSO model performance
    obtained in the current study. In addition, prediction Kc using meteorological
    variables that can be measured easily in any studied location and region is more
    applicable than those models that use leaf area index (LAI) and crop height variables.
    Similarly, Mobe et al. [73] evaluated the A&P approach for estimating Kc using
    several measured variables, including transpiration, evapotranspiration, soil
    attributes, weather, and tree physiological in 12 apple orchards located in the
    Western Cape Province of South Africa. The results showed that the original A&P
    approach significantly overestimated the basal crop coefficients. The prediction
    performance was enhanced by defining the canopy resistance factor in the A&P method.
    After selecting the best model to predict Kc, the scatter density diagrams as
    an innovation-colored scatter are plotted between the measured and predicted Kc
    for the MLP-RSO model in all regions (Fig. 5). This scatter diagram is colored
    by a normalized density spectrum and used to determine over-estimation and under-estimation
    [74]. From Fig. 5, the high correlation between the monthly predicted and actual
    Kc is obvious in four studied regions by the hybrid MLP-RSO model. Fig. 5 Density
    scatter diagram and linear regression between actual Kc and estimated by hybrid
    MLP-RSO model in different regions Full size image The ‘hot spots’ of the Kc are
    more concentrated between 0.5 and 0.8 in the Al-Gharbiyah, 0.5 and 0.6 in the
    Ad Dakahliyah, and 0.5 and 0.9 in the Al-Ismailiyah. In the Ash sharkiyah, the
    ‘hot spots’ are concentrated in two positions between 0.35 to 0.6 and 0.9 to 1.1.
    Regarding Fig. 5, the predicted Kc by the MLP-RSO model follows the actual Kc
    with many small disagreements at high values of Kc (more than 1). However, many
    predicated Kc data display a good correlation with actual data and conflicts are
    not substantial at higher ranges. The color spectrum shows that the hybrid MLP-RSO
    model is slightly under-predicting the monthly Kc data in the Al-Gharbiyah, while
    data are slightly over-predicting in the Ad Dakahliyah and Ash sharkiyah regions.
    In the Al-Ismailiyah, the color spectrum suggests over-predicting at high values
    of Kc and under-predicting at low values. In Al-Gharbiyah, the color spectrum
    is more uniformly distributed around the data than in other regions, suggesting
    a precise correlation between predicted and actual Kc. 3.4 Uncertainty analysis
    of models using GLUE The GLUE framework is used to quantify input and models’
    parameters uncertainty. The parameters distribution and statistical characteristics
    of the hybrid and standalone models are driven by 3000 number of simulations runs.
    The simulations were generated randomly with GLUE to obtain the impact of input
    and model structure uncertainties on model output. Figure 6 shows the values of
    p and r to investigate models’ uncertainty in four regions. As it is shown in
    Fig. 6, the highest p values related to input uncertainty and model structure
    uncertainty belong to the MLP-RSO in all regions, while the MLP and MLP-GA have
    the smallest values of p. Therefore, regarding the p values, the MLP-RSO has the
    most bracketed actual Kc data in all regions. The 95% confidence interval (95%
    CI) was obtained at 2.5% and 97.5% of the accumulative distribution from input
    parameters and model structure. As expected, the 95% CI of the MLP-RSO covers
    94%, 95%, 93%, and 96% of actual Kc for input parameters uncertainty, while it
    covers 91%, 89%, 92%, and 94% of actual Kc for model structure uncertainty in
    Al-Gharbiyah, Ad Dakahliyah, Al-Ismailiyah, and Ash sharkiyah regions, respectively.
    The average p value obtained from both input parameters uncertainty and model
    structure uncertainty for the MLP-RSO model was almost 5.7%, 13.6%, 6.9%, and
    10.4% more than the MLP model in Al-Gharbiyah, Ad Dakahliyah, Al-Ismailiyah, and
    Ash sharkiyah regions, respectively. So, it is evident from the results that hybrid
    models (especially MLP-RSO) have a high capability to bracket more actual Kc data.
    Hence, the prediction stability of the MLP-RSO model is guaranteed based on the
    evaluation criteria and uncertainty analysis. Also, the calculated r values for
    input parameters and model structure uncertainties reveal the superiority of the
    hybrid MLP-RSO model over the other models. As shown in Fig. 6, the 95PPU region
    from the MLP-RSO is narrower than other applied models for both conditions of
    model structure and input parameters. The corresponding r values related to the
    model structure (input parameter) of the MLP-RSO were calculated equal to 0.15
    (0.12), 0.16 (0.14), 0.17 (0.12), and 0.15 (0.12) for Al-Gharbiyah, Ad Dakahliyah,
    Al-Ismailiyah, and Ash sharkiyah, respectively. The r values of the MLP-RSO model
    for input parameters and model structure were 50% and 44.4% in the Al-Gharbiyah,
    41.7% and 33.3% in the Ad Dakahliyah, 42.8% and 22.7% in the Al-Ismailiyah, and
    42.8% and 40% in the Ash sharkiyah lower than those for MLP model, respectively.
    The results of the r and p values demonstrate that the hybridizing meta-heuristic
    optimization algorithm with machine learning methods can improve the actual Kc
    predictions in Nile Delta, Egypt, where hybrid models achieve high stability compared
    to traditional models. Also, the high ability of hybrid models for finding an
    optimal global solution is proved in the case of Kc prediction. The r and p results
    showed that the Kc predictions are more sensitive to the model structure than
    input parameters due to higher values of p and lower values of r for input parameters
    for all models. In other words, the selection of model parameters affects Kc prediction
    more than inputs. The uncertainty that origin from model parameters is higher
    than those from inputs. Thus, the results indicate that developing a robust model
    with the highest accuracy and slightest uncertainty is difficult and complicate.
    Fig. 6 Uncertainty analysis of developed models based on the p and r parameters
    for the best input vector Full size image The prediction uncertainty of the Kc,
    including input uncertainty and model parameters uncertainty, along with the best
    estimation by MLP-RSO is shown in Figs. 7, 8, 9, and 10 for four studied regions.
    It is clear that the uncertainty regions cover most Kc data in three stages of
    initial, mid-season, and late season. But many upper bounds are located beyond
    the Kc data line, and the MLP-RSO has a small limitation to bracket high Kc data
    in all regions. Fig. 7 a Input uncertainty (p:0.94, r:0.12) and b parameter uncertainty

    of a simple equation to quantify the Kc using readily accessible meteorological
    variables under different regions will be of extensive benefit for agriculture
    and research. Therefore, developing explicit equations of Kc for four studied
    regions as a function of meteorological variables is considered as a major contribution
    for the current study. The black-box form of the standalone MLP model is complicated.
    Hence, the optimized weights in the MLP-RSO structures were used to find an explicit
    equation. By obtaining optimized weights and biases and by applying the tangent-sigmoid
    transfer function for the hybrid MLP-RSO model, the Kc equation of maize is provided
    for each studied region in Nile Delta, Egypt. The algebraic form of the MLP-RSO
    for estimating Kc based on the best input combination is written: (a) Al-Gharbiyah

    The above-proposed equations are explicit forms of optimized black-box MLP model
    that are applicable to each region in this study. Also, these equations are valid
    for the Kc dataset with ranges between the minimum and maximum values similar
    to the dataset in this study. Ayars et al. [75] extended a linear relationship
    between Kc and noon intercepted solar radiation, but Girona et al. [76] presented
    that confirming and applying this relationship is difficult due to the heterogeneity
    of the canopy. Marsal et al. [77] reported that CropSyst can improve Kc prediction
    for apple trees when considering changes in canopy shape and porosity. Also, the
    normalization formula can be used to alter the structure of a database. The purpose
    of the normalization is to remove redundant data from a database and to store
    data that are nonredundant. By normalization, unused data are removed from the
    database, and redundancy and inconsistency are reduced. Data are normalized when
    they are scaled between 0 and 1. The formula for normalization is: $${X}_{\\mathrm{normalized
    }}= \\frac{X-{X}_{\\mathrm{min}}}{{X}_{\\mathrm{max}}-{X}_{\\mathrm{min}}}$$ (21)
    where X is the observed value, Xmin is the minimum value of data, and Xmax is
    the maximum value of data. 4 Conclusion Crop coefficient (Kc) is an important
    and critical component in calculating crop evapotranspiration that is an essential
    factor for irrigation planning, water management, and water saving in agriculture.
    In this research, hybrid models were developed using machine learning approach
    and meta-heuristics optimization algorithms. The hybrid MLP-RSO, MLP-FFA, MLP-BA,
    and MLP-GA models were assessed to predict the monthly crop coefficient (Kc) of
    maize and to derive an explicit predictive equation in four regions in Nile Delta,
    Egypt. Since selecting the best input combination is complex, a novel hybrid gamma
    test (GT)-RSO was applied to automatically identify the optimal input combination
    from monthly meteorological variables of Tmax, Tmin, Tmean, RH, Rs, WS, SH, and
    VPD. Also, the uncertainties related to model structure and input parameters in
    the Kc prediction were quantified using the GLUE approach. The main results of
    this research are summarized in the following points: The results indicated the
    effectiveness of the hybrid GT-RSO as a robust method for identifying the best
    input combination. The lowest values of \\(\\varGamma\\) were obtained using Tmax,
    Tmin, and Rs input combination in all studied regions. The optimal values of optimization
    algorithms parameters were obtained by a sensitivity analysis that had a high
    potential to produce more accurate predictive results without great effort in
    finding random parameters. The results of the evaluation criteria and the Taylor
    diagram illustrated the superiority of the hybrid MLP-RSO model in predicting
    Kc over the other hybrid and standalone models. The standalone MLP model was the
    least performing model, although it provided reasonably accurate Kc prediction.
    The MLP-RSO model decreased the average RMSE by 13.87%, 39.95%, 45.68%, and 53.09%
    than MLP-BA, MLP-FFA, MLP-GA, and MLP models, respectively. The density scatter
    diagram showed a large number of Kc data were predicted using the MLP-RSO model
    by robust correlation with the actual Kc data, indicating low error density. From
    an uncertainty viewpoint, by considering both model structure and input parameters,
    the results showed the advantage of using the MLP-RSO model in the current study.
    The MLO-RSO model showed high accuracy and had the best coverage of actual data
    (p factor) with reasonably narrow uncertainty bound (r factor). The uncertainty
    results confirmed some instability in the Kc prediction by the standalone model
    to find a global solution. Four explicit equations were derived by hybrid MLP-RSO
    model for Kc predicting using the most effective meteorological variables of Tmin,
    Tmax, and Rs. The derivation equation was considered as a major contribution of
    this study in agriculture science. The proposed derived equations could potentially
    provide reliability and applicability technique to compute Kc of maize in the
    Nile Delta and in different crop development stages with less computationally
    efforts. However, it is worth noting that the selection of the methodology from
    MLP-RSO represents a possible solution path to make a comparative study for Kc
    predicting based on other techniques such as random forest and XGBoost. Also,
    the feature selection based on the feature importance (SHapley Additive exPlanations)
    would be an interesting comparison. It is desired to carry out further research
    to make similar efforts for assessing other uncertainty analysis methods. 5 Appendix

  description: Future trends in climate change, water scarcity, and energy costs will
    motivate agriculturists to develop innovative agricultural systems. In order to
    achieve sustainable farming in arid regions, there is an urgent need to use artificial
    intelligence (AI) to predict and estimate the optimum water and energy requirements
    for the irrigation of date palms. Therefore, this study aimed to predict the optimum
    water and energy requirements for date palm irrigation depending on the optimum
    water use efficiency (WUE) and yield in arid conditions. To achieve this aim,
    four solar-powered micro irrigation systems were developed and evaluated under
    six irrigation levels for date palm irrigation. Soil moisture sensor-based controllers
    were used to automate irrigation scheduling for the micro irrigation systems.
    The water pumping in these systems was powered using a solar photovoltaic (PV)
    system. In addition, four machine-learning (ML) algorithms, including linear regression
    (LR), support vector regression (SVR), long short-term memory (LSTM) neural network,
    and extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost), were developed and validated for prediction
    purposes. These models were developed in Python programing language using the
    Keras library. The results indicated that the optimum WUS was achieved when the
    maximum setpoints of irrigation control were adjusted at the field capacity and
    by adjusting the minimum setpoints at 40, 50, 70, and 80% of the available water
    (AW). The optimum yield was achieved by adjusting the minimum setpoints at 60,
    70, 80, and 90% of AW for subsurface irrigation, subsurface drip irrigation, drip
    irrigation, and bubbler irrigation, respectively. Therefore, the dataset was prepared
    at these levels for four years to train and test the models, and a fifth year
    was used to validate the performance of the best model. The evaluation of the
    models showed that the LSTM followed by XGBoost models were more accurate than
    the SVR and LR models for predicting the optimum irrigation water and energy requirements.
    The validation result showed that the LSTM was able to predict the water and energy
    requirements for all irrigation systems with R2 ranging from 0.90 to 0.92 based
    on limited meteorological variables and date palm age. The findings of the current
    study demonstrated that the developed LSTM model can be a powerful tool in irrigation
    water and energy management as a fast and easy-to-use approach.

    Agricultural sustainability and development mainly rely on irrigation water. Global
    agricultural production consumes more than 70% of the available freshwater worldwide
    for irrigation use [1,2]. However, less than 60% of the water applied can be efficiently
    utilized for crop irrigation based on actual water requirements [3]. Furthermore,
    irrigation water scarcity characterizes arid regions, which causes the limitation
    of sustainable agriculture and development in these regions [4,5]. Therefore,
    enhancing irrigation water productivity in these regions is the main target for
    sustainable agriculture and economic development [6]. Precision agriculture is
    indispensable for enhancing agricultural production and saving water through efficient
    irrigation management. Precision irrigation management ensures efficient plant
    water usage with the proper amounts that compensate for water loss through erosion
    or evapotranspiration [7]. Moreover, natural phenomena, such as global warming
    and climate change, influence the availability of precipitation needed to provide
    water for trees and plants. Even if these climatic factors are controlled using
    greenhouses [8], these factors are not easy to manage or control in the open field,
    such as date palm fields. The problem is becoming worse in countries with harsh
    climates and arid lands [9]. Date palm trees (Phoenix dactylifera L.) are the
    essential crops in arid and semi-arid regions characterized by water scarcity
    throughout the year. Consequently, date palm irrigation in these regions often
    relies on groundwater. However, despite water scarcity, inefficient irrigation
    water use still prevails in date palm farms, which may soon lead to groundwater
    depletion [9]. Therefore, water management for sustainable date palm cultivation
    is essential for stakeholders. Many irrigation methods, such as drip, bubble,
    and flood, are usually used to supply water to the date palms without control
    systems. Although these irrigation methods lead to the maximum date palm tree
    yield, modern automated micro irrigation systems can produce a similar yield using
    less irrigation water [10,11]. Therefore, the use of micro irrigation systems
    with proper irrigation scheduling contributes to higher water use efficiency (WUE)
    and crop yield [12]. Date palm fields are often far from the energy sources needed
    for powering water pumps and irrigation water scheduling control systems. Consequently,
    solar photovoltaic (PV) systems are required to supply irrigation systems with
    the energy needed [13]. In addition, the solar PV system helps decrease carbon
    emissions into the atmosphere. Using solar PV systems for water pumping can prevent
    about 24,000 tons of greenhouse gases annually from being released into the atmosphere
    in Saudi Arabia [14]. Optimizing solar PV water pumping systems is a significant
    trend, which leads to demand satisfaction with irrigation water requirements with
    low PV energy consumption. Therefore, many previous efforts have been conducted
    to save and optimize PV water pumping systems’ energy consumption and costs. For
    example, low-cost solar PV systems were developed, which depend on variable voltage,
    variable frequency, and maximum power point tracker for water pumping in irrigation
    systems [13]. This control system will give an optimum solution for solar PV energy
    conservation. Generally, solar PV energy is becoming very influential globally
    due to the benefits of its use. However, climate change results in frequent variations,
    which directly affect the energy production in PV system installations; therefore,
    efficient AI management is essential [15]. Artificial intelligence (AI) can play
    a vital role in the efficient management of irrigation water scheduling by managing
    sensed data and understanding the changing dynamics of weather, soil, and plant
    conditions during the cultivation periods [2]. Furthermore, due to the development
    of sensing devices, the enormous internet of things (IoT) revolution, and machine-learning
    (ML) applications for intelligent agriculture, its use substantially impacts irrigation
    water conservation, plant growth, and crop production [16,17,18,19]. As a result,
    these technologies will enable water irrigation management, optimization of electricity
    use for water pumping, and a reduction in overall costs [20]. Monitoring the plant
    conditions, the weather variables, and the water status in the soil are essential
    factors in reducing irrigation water consumption without affecting crop production.
    In order to achieve these targets, several tools and devices are developed to
    ensure precision irrigation, such as automated weather stations and IoT-based
    control systems [21]. However, these methods are not usually available due to
    their expensive cost and complicated use. In addition, digital aerial photography
    applications need temporal and spatial plant water status information with sufficient
    accuracy [22]. Therefore, alternative and cheaper methods are necessary to provide
    the plants with their actual water requirements based on ML prediction and prediction
    models. The most common regression methods in the ML domain include linear regression,
    support vector regression, conventional neural networks, long short-term memory
    neural networks, and extreme gradient boosting. Linear regression is the most
    standard regression approach, which is widely used in prediction and decision-making
    applications [23]. It examines the relationship between two quantitative variables,
    namely dependent (goal or output) variables and independent (predictor or input)
    variables. Therefore, linear regression approaches help in establishing causal
    relationships between variables, which are useful in modeling the prediction of
    some agricultural problems [17]. Support vector regression is a well-known ML
    algorithm widely used in classification applications. It is based on two elements
    of the statistical learning theory, namely the decision boundary and the decision
    plane [24]. The most conventional neural networks assume that all the input samples
    are independent of each other. This is not the case in applications that include
    sequential or time series data, such as the data gathered in the agriculture domain,
    where each data sample is supposed to be dependent on the previous one [25]. It
    is demonstrated that recurrent neural network approaches are used to treat time
    series data. Specifically, given sequential data, the standard recurrent neural
    network aims to learn representations of patterns that repeatedly occurred through
    the past data sample by sharing parameters across all time steps [26]. However,
    as time goes on, the memory of recurrent neural networks of past learned patterns
    fades. The long short-term memory (LSTM) allows the memory cell to memorize the
    data stream for a longer period of time by setting propagation tracks to keep
    the flow of gradients of the earlier states [27]. The LSTM is trained to map an
    input sequence into an output sequence, where the network’s delay recursion enables
    it to represent efficiently the dynamic performance of any sequential system [28,29].
    The impact of extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost) has been widely recognized in
    a variety of ML and data mining applications and challenges. Moreover, it is widely
    used for feature selection due to its high scalability, efficiency, parallelization,
    and speed [30]. To our knowledge, no previous study has been conducted to predict
    the irrigation water and PV energy requirements using ML models for date palms
    in arid regions, especially in micro irrigation systems. Therefore, in this study,
    we addressed the problem of predicting the water and energy requirements for date
    palm orchards using essential solar-powered micro irrigation systems in an arid
    region. The main objective of the current study was to predict the optimum irrigation
    water and solar photovoltaic (PV) energy requirements for date palm irrigation
    using micro irrigation systems. Therefore, the influence of four solar-powered
    surface and subsurface micro irrigation systems on water use efficiency (WUE)
    and date palm tree yield under six irrigation levels was investigated to determine
    the optimum irrigation water and energy required for optimal WUE and productivity
    of date palm trees. In addition, four ML models, namely linear regression (LR),
    support vector regression (SVR), long short-term memory (LSTM) neural network,
    and extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost), were developed to predict the optimum
    water and energy requirements based on limited meteorological data and date palm
    age in a time series forecasting paradigm. We selected LR as an example of the
    parametric method and SVR as an example of the non-parametric method, both of
    them being decision boundary-based methods [31]. Additionally, we selected the
    LSTM as an example of a neuron-based method, whereas XGBoost is an example of
    a tree-based method [30]. Moreover, since irrigation water management is a complex
    environmental problem that includes several parameters, we represent the problem
    as a multivariate time series problem. This multivariate problem can be treated
    easily using the aforementioned ML approaches [32]. Accordingly, our contributions
    to achieving the objectives of the current study can be summarized as follows:
    Investigating the influence of four solar-powered micro irrigation systems on
    date palm yield and water use efficiency. Collecting data on meteorological variables
    of the study area during the date palm irrigation experiment, including actual
    water applied and actual PV energy consumed. Determining the optimum water applied
    and PV energy consumed for obtaining optimum WUE and for optimum date palm yield
    under each micro irrigation system. Developing and evaluating four ML models for
    predicting water and energy requirements based on limited meteorological variables
    and date palm age, where the target is to achieve the optimum WUE, or where the
    target is to achieve the optimum date palm yield. Validating the best ML model
    under each solar-powered irrigation system according to the above two options.
    2. Materials and Methods 2.1. Experimental Area This study was implemented in
    an arid region at the experimental orchards of Date Palm Research Center of Excellence
    (25°16′03.8″ N, 49°42′29.2″ E) at the Agricultural Training and Research Station,
    King Faisal University (KFU), Saudi Arabia. The experiment was conducted for five
    successive years (1 January 2018 to 31 December 2022). The palm trees chosen (Khalas
    cultivar) had uniform growth and were of the same age (14 years in the first season)
    with a density of 200 palms/ha. In addition, all date palm trees chosen were treated
    with the same farming practices. The groundwater well at the DPRC fields was used
    to supply the irrigation water applied in this study for all irrigation systems.
    The irrigation water’s electrical conductivity (EC) was 0.96 ± 0.58 dS/m; the
    pH was 8.95 ± 1.31; and total dissolved solids (TDS) were 778 ± 58.22 mg/L. The
    soil in the experimental site was sandy loam with an average particle size distribution
    of 67.61 ± 2.22, 17.93 ± 0.67, and 14.46 ± 2.21% for sand, silt, and clay, respectively.
    The soil’s bulk density (BD) was 1.58 ± 0.12 g/cm3; the field capacity (FC) was
    19.98 ± 0.62%; the permanent wilting point (PWP) was 9.27± 0.38%; the pH was 8.11
    ± 0.21; the electrical conductivity (ECs) was 3.32 ± 1.63; and the hydraulic conductivity
    (HC) was 4.91 ± 0.21. The soil’s average physical, chemical, and hydraulic characteristics
    are within 100 cm depth in the experimental site. 2.2. Description of the Solar-Powered
    Micro Irrigation Systems In this study, four solar-powered micro irrigation systems
    were used for date palm irrigation, which were subsurface irrigation system (SIS),
    subsurface drip irrigation system (SDIS), drip irrigation system (DIS), and bubbler
    irrigation system (BIS). All irrigation systems used in the study were supplied
    with fresh water sourced from groundwater wells. A solar photovoltaic (PV) system
    with solar pumping inverter (SPI) was used to power and control the AC induction
    motor of the irrigation pump based on pulse-width modulation (PWM), current, and
    voltage source inverter. The average daily solar radiation was used to calculate
    the size of the PV system. Figure 1 shows a schematic diagram of the components
    of each irrigation system, the distribution of the irrigation units around the
    palm for each system, the solar PV system of energy supply for water pumping and
    control mechanism, and the method of connecting the solar panel and irrigation
    networks. Figure 2 shows some photos of the solar PV and irrigation systems used
    in the current study. The following subsection shows the description of the solar
    PV and irrigation systems. Figure 1. A schematic diagram of the experimental setup

    system (BIS). 2.2.1. Solar PV System The solar PV system was designed according
    to the energy required for the water pumping system. This experiment used ten
    solar PV panels 305 W (CSUN305-72P, Matrix—Australian Solar Co., Prestons, NSW,
    Australia) to power the water pumping system. Nine solar PV panels are connected
    in series to operate the water pumps, and one is used to operate the control units.
    The ten solar PV modules were tilted on a metal frame at 30° toward the south,
    as shown in Figure 1 and Figure 2a. Each solar PV panel had a maximum power (Pmax)
    of 305 Wp, a voltage at the maximum power (Vmp) of 36.7 V, a current at maximum
    power (Imp) of 8.31 A, a voltage at open circuit (Voc) of 45.2 V, and a current
    at short circuit (Isc) of 8.87 A. The PV panel efficiency was 15.75%. The maximum
    power of the solar PV system was 325 V, and the peak power was 2.8 kW. The solar
    PV system output power was used to power the water pump through a 2.2 kW variable-frequency
    (VFD) solar Inverter (GD100-2R2G-S2-PV, Goosun Energy Construction Group Co.,
    Ltd., Fuyang, China). 2.2.2. Irrigation Systems One solar-powered water pumping
    system was used for these irrigation systems. The water pumping system consisted
    of a solar-powered irrigation control unit, a water source, two water pumps, pressure
    regulators, water solenoid valves, manual valves, a pressure gauge, and water
    flow meters. The solar-powered irrigation control unit included four digital programable
    timers, electronic circuits, and power sources for the valves and timers (Figure
    2b). Four digital programable timers were used to regulate the water pumping in
    the irrigation network for each irrigation system separately. The PV system of
    the irrigation control unit consisted of a 20 W solar panel, battery (12 V, 30
    Ah), and solar charging controller. Figure 1 compares the distribution of irrigation
    units around the palm tree for SIS (Figure 1A), SDIS (Figure 1B), DIS (Figure
    1C), and BIS (Figure 1D). The following is a brief description of the micro irrigation
    systems used: SIS: Six subsurface irrigation units were used for each date palm
    tree in this system (Figure 2f). The subsurface irrigation units were connected
    to the distribution ring, and the ring was connected to the subline. The subsurface
    irrigation unit consisted of two perforated pipes with light volcanic gravels
    (0.4–0.8 cm in diameter) between them. The outer diameter of the subsurface irrigation
    unit was 12.5 cm, and its length was 35 cm. The outer pipe’s surface is slotted
    with a slot width of 0.2 cm, a length of 4.0 cm, and a tilt angle of 30°. The
    inner pipe length is 35 cm with a diameter of 2.5 cm and is perforated in a spiral
    shape with a 0.3 cm hole diameter. The subsurface irrigation unit’s water flow
    rate was approximately 0.030 m3/h at a pressure of 300 kPa. SDIS: A subsurface
    dripline with a diameter of 1.6 cm (Rain Bird Corporation, Tucson, AZ, USA) included
    subsurface pressure-compensating emitters used in this system (Figure 2g). The
    distance between two pressure-compensating emitters was 0.457 m. Two lateral rings
    of this subsurface dripline were installed around the date palm tree. The diameters
    of the inner and outer lateral dripline rings were 1.2 m and 1.84 m, respectively.
    Accordingly, twenty pressure-compensating emitters were used for each date palm
    tree. The flow rate of the pressure-compensating emitters was approximately 0.010
    m3/h at a pressure of 380 kPa. DIS: Six pressure-compensating drippers with a
    flow rate of approximately 0.03 m3/h at 300 kPa were distributed around the date
    palm tree in this system (Figure 2h). The dripper was installed on a lateral ring
    (1.6 cm in diameter) around date palm trees with a diameter of 1.80 m. BIS: Four
    adjustable low-pressure bubblers with flow rates ranging from 0 to 0.120 m3/h
    were used in this system for each date palm tree (Figure 2i). The bubbler flow
    rate of 0.045 m3/h was adjusted at the pressure of 200 kPa. The bubbler heads
    were installed on a wedge and inserted into the ground around the date palm tree.
    2.3. Experimental Design and Measurements The experiment involved four solar-powered
    micro irrigation systems (SIS, SDIS, DIS, and BIS) with six deficit irrigation
    level treatments as a different percentage of available water (AW). The experiment
    was a factorial randomized block design (factorial RBD) with three replicates.
    Factor one was the four irrigation systems; factor two was the six irrigation
    levels; and factor three was the date palm age or years of experiment. Therefore,
    72 date palm trees were used in this experiment for five successive years from
    2018 to 2022 (date palm age was from 14 to 18 years). Based on the evaluation
    of irrigation systems, we selected the data of irrigation water amount that presented
    significant optimum water use efficiency (WUE) and optimum date palm tree yield
    to develop the ML models for prediction of the optimum irrigation water and PV
    energy requirements for each micro irrigation system. The measurements in this
    study included the meteorological variables, irrigation water requirements at
    the four deficit irrigation treatments, the actual amount of irrigation water
    used for each irrigation system, the amount of electrical energy consumed for
    each irrigation system, date palm yield, and water use efficiency. First, the
    data of meteorological variables, plant age, and actual water and energy requirements
    for date palm irrigation for four successive years from 2018 to 2021 were used
    to train and test four ML-based prediction models for predicting the irrigation
    water and energy requirements. Then, the data obtained from the fifth season (2022)
    were used to validate the performance of the best developed model by comparing
    the observed values with the predicted values. The measurements in the current
    study can be summarized as follows: Meteorological variables: A cloud-based IoT
    platform was used for meteorological variables’ data collection. The IoT platform
    included several components, i.e., the sensors, controller, source of internet,
    cloud platform (ThingSpeak cloud platform), and laptop. These components were
    efficiently connected and seamlessly worked to realize the meteorological variables’
    data collection. Irrigation water requirements: The amount of irrigation water
    requirements (IWR) was expressed per date palm tree. The IWR was controlled based
    on the volumetric soil water content (VSWC) using a soil moisture sensor-based
    control system. The sensor-based irrigation scheduling (SBIS) method was used
    for the irrigation schedule in this experiment using a soil moisture sensor-based
    control system designed and manufactured by the first author of the current study
    [9]. The minimum setpoints were adjusted at different VSWC as a percent of available
    water (AW) content (40, 50, 60, 70, 80, and 90% of AW), as shown in Figure 3.
    The maximum setpoints were adjusted at 25% VSWC for all irrigation systems. Three
    VSWC sensors (VH400Vegetronix, Inc., Riverton, Salt Lake County, UT, USA) were
    used for each treatment. Each sensor is installed between two irrigation units
    at a distance of 1 m from the palm tree’s trunk, with a depth of 25 cm. Figure
    3. Water type, thresholds for soil in the study area, and minimum and maximum
    irrigation control setpoints. The FC, AW, PWP, and UAW denote field capacity,
    available water, permanent wilting point, and unavailable water. Irrigation water
    applied: Multi-jet water flow meters (model: LXSG-15E-50E, Ningbo Yonggang Instrument
    Co., Ltd., Cixi, Ningbo, China) made from copper with a nominal diameter of 20
    m were used to calculate the actual amount of irrigation water applied. The flow
    meters were made of copper with total dimensions of approximately 1.9 × 9.9 ×
    1.6 cm. The reduction factor: The reduction coefficient (Kr) for each irrigation
    system was estimated using the following formula: K r = IWR×1000 ET c ×A i (1)
    where Kr is a reduction factor of ETc for achieving the optimum WUE or optimum
    yield; IWR is the irrigation water requirement applied based on the sensor-based
    irrigation scheduling (m3/palm/day); ETc is the crop evapotranspiration in the
    study area (mm/day); Ai is the target irrigation area of each date palm tree.
    The target irrigation area was equal to 90% of the actual shaded area of the date
    palm; Ai was determined according to the light intercepted fraction by the canopy.
    The ETc was determined according to the following formula: ET c = K c × ET o (2)
    where Kc is the crop factor for the date palm tree ((Kc ranged from 0.8 to 1.0))
    [5,33], and ETo is the reference evapotranspiration (mm/day). The ETo was determined
    according to the Penman–Monteith equation [34]. Electrical energy consumed: The
    amount of electrical energy consumed for each irrigation system was measured using
    digital energy meters (D69-2049, Yueqing Winston Electric Co., Ltd., Wenzhou,
    China). These digital energy meters are multi-function meters, which simultaneously
    display the measured AC voltage (80–300 VAC), AC (0–100 A), active power (0–10000
    W), and cumulative energy consumption (0–10000 kWh). Yield and water use efficiency:
    The yield of the palm tree was predicted by weighing the ripe date fruits immediately
    after harvesting using a digital balance. The water use efficiency was predicted
    based on the yield and the cumulative irrigation water applied using the following
    equation: WUE= DPY AIW (3) where WUE is water use efficiency (kg/m3); DPY is the
    date palm yield (kg); and AIW is the applied irrigation water (m3). 2.4. Machine-Learning
    Algorithms In this study, we developed and evaluated four common ML algorithms
    widely used to automate the decision making of irrigation systems’ management
    [7]. In order to reach a fair evaluation, we utilized 60%, 20%, and 20% of the
    overall dataset in training, testing, and validating, respectively, the ML methods.
    The following subsections briefly show the ML algorithms, which are developed
    and utilized in this study. 2.4.1. Linear Regression Linear regression examines
    the relationship between two quantitative variables, namely dependent variables
    (goal) and independent variables (predictor). In practice, it comes in two variants.
    The first is a simple linear regression where we have one independent variable
    and one dependent variable. The second is a multi-linear regression where there
    is more than one independent variable. The multi-linear regression where there
    is more than one independent variable was used in this study, as shown in the
    following equation: 𝑦 𝑖 ̂ = 𝐵 0 + 𝐵 1 𝑥 𝑖1 + 𝐵 2 𝑥 𝑖2 + …  𝐵 𝑛 𝑥 𝑖𝑛 (4) where
    𝑦 𝑖 ̂ is the predicted value (output), the Bs are the regression model parameters,
    and the xis are the input variables. In this study, the xis represent the meteorological
    variables and date palm age, whereas the output 𝑦 𝑖 ̂ represents the irrigation
    water required and the solar PV energy, which is required for water pumping and
    controlling each irrigation system. The values of the Bs started at random and
    were then adjusted during the learning phase. 2.4.2. Support Vector Machine The
    support vector machine (SVM) is based on two elements of the statistical learning
    theory, namely the decision boundary and the decision plane. SVM uses a linear
    function to establish a nonlinear decision boundary across a nonlinear mapping
    of the input vector x into a high-dimensional feature space. In practice, it uses
    a linear function to establish a nonlinear decision boundary across a nonlinear
    mapping of the input vectors x into a high-dimensional feature space. The decision
    plane can be defined as a plane that separates a set of varied objects [31]. When
    SVM is applied to a regression problem, it takes the name of support vector regression
    (SVR) [24]. Similar to the SVM approach, there is motivation to optimize the generalization
    bounds adopted for SVR. Namely, SVR relies on identifying the loss function by
    excluding the expected errors, which may exist within a specific distance from
    the ground values. As shown in Figure 4a, this loss function embeds a uni-dimensional
    linear regression function with an epsilon-insensitive band; therefore, it is
    called the epsilon-insensitive loss function. Figure 4. The epsilon-insensitive
    band via one-dimensional (a) linear regression function and (b) nonlinear regression
    function. The goal of SVR is to find a function 𝑓(𝑥)= 𝑤 𝑇 𝑥+𝑏 , which deviates
    no more than 𝜉 from the target values yi for all training data [31]. For linearly
    separable data, the corresponding quadratic optimization problem is given as Minimize
    1 2 𝑤 𝑇 𝑤  s.t. 𝑦 𝑖 ( 𝑤 𝑇 𝑥 𝑖 +𝑏⩽1; ∀ 𝑖 =1,2, …, 𝑁) (5) where w is the weight
    vector, the xis are the input features (or the weather conditions), and b is the
    bias. The SVM can deal with nonlinear regression cases, as shown in Figure 4b.
    For the nonlinearly separable data, the corresponding optimization problem can
    be given as Minimize 1 2 𝑤 𝑇 𝑤+𝖢 ∑ 𝑖=1 𝑁 𝜁  s.t. 𝑦 𝑖 ( 𝑤 𝑇 𝑥 𝑖 +𝑏⩾1−𝜁; ∀ 𝑖 =1,2,
    …, 𝑁,𝜁⩾1) (6) where C is a constant usually used to control the error. For the
    experiments of this study, we considered C = 100, 𝜉 = 0.1, and 0.01 for the irrigation
    water requirements and the solar PV energy requirements, respectively. For the
    kernel function of SVR, we used the Gaussian RBF kernel function with γ (Gamma)
    = 0.1 and 0.01, respectively. Gamma in SVR is a hyperparameter, which decides
    how much binding we want in a decision boundary. 2.4.3. Long Short-Term Memory
    Long short-term memory (LSTM) is a recurrent neural network method capable of
    treating sequential (or time series) data. This is because LSTM contains memory
    blocks that replace the summation unit in each neuron of other neural network
    models. The standard LSTM model is composed of one hidden layer followed by a
    feed-forward output layer. Each layer contains several cells where the information
    is stored; Figure 5 shows the internal structure of one cell. Figure 5. The internal
    structure of one LSTM cell. As depicted in Figure 5, the LSTM memory cell consists
    of three gates built upon a sigmoidal neural network, where each gate has a different
    function [27]. The three gates are the input gate, the forget gate, and the output
    gate. In detail, the input gate controls whether to enter the input data into
    the cell state. The forget gate decides whether to erase data from the cell state
    or not. Lastly, the output gate decides which data to pass as the output hidden
    state. The following equations represent the function of each gate. (𝑖 𝑡 =𝜎( 𝑊
    𝑥𝑖 𝑋 𝑡 + 𝑊 ℎ𝑖 ℎ 𝑡−1 + 𝑏 𝑖 ) (7) 𝑓 𝑡 =𝜎( 𝑊 𝑥𝑓 𝑋 𝑡 + 𝑊 ℎ𝑓 ℎ 𝑡−1 + 𝑏 𝑓 ) (8) 𝑜 𝑡
    =𝜎( 𝑊 𝑥𝑜 𝑋 𝑡 + 𝑊 ℎ𝑜 ℎ 𝑡−1 + 𝑏 𝑜 ) (9) 𝑐 𝑡 = 𝑓 𝑡 ⊙ 𝑐 𝑡−1 + 𝑖 𝑡 ⊙𝑡𝑎𝑛ℎ( 𝑊 𝑥𝑐 𝑋 𝑡
    + 𝑊 ℎ𝑐 ℎ 𝑡−1 + 𝑏 𝑐 ) (10) ℎ 𝑡 = 𝑜 𝑡 ⊙𝑡𝑎𝑛ℎ( 𝑐 𝑡 ) (11) For simplicity, this could
    be represented in one form as follows: ℎ 𝑡 , 𝑐 𝑡 =𝖫𝖲𝖳𝖬( 𝑥 𝑡 , ℎ 𝑡−1 , 𝑐 𝑡−1 )
    (12) where it, ft, and ot are the LSTM gating for the cell state to input, forget,
    and output information, respectively. ht and ct are the hidden state vector and
    the cell memory state vector, respectively. Xt is the input vector, and σ is the
    sigmoid activation function. The W’s are linear transformation matrices whose
    parameters need to be learned for each gate and cell memory; the bs are the corresponding
    bias vector [35]. In this study, we built the structure of LSTM similar to the
    model described in our previous paper [35]. Namely, the LSTM includes one input
    layer, two hidden layers with twelve and six neurons, respectively, and one output
    layer with two neurons, one for each output. The number of epochs was 250, such
    that the batch size was 150. The initial learning rate of the model was 0.001
    with a suitable decay rate to slow down the training after several epochs. 2.4.4.
    Gradient Boosting Machine Gradient boosting (GBoost) machine is a decision-tree-based
    ensemble algorithm that combines many weak learners, based on the gradient direction
    of the loss function, to create one stronger learner. GBoost learns the decision
    trees, in parallel, by fitting the negative gradients in each iteration. To learn
    the decision tree, GBoost finds the best split points, which takes a long time,
    making GBoost inapplicable in large-scale problems [36]. The eXtreme gradient
    boosting (XGBoost) algorithm is an efficient scalable end-to-end implementation
    of GBoost, even with billions of examples, using far fewer resources than existing
    systems [37]. As an ensemble learning algorithm, XGBoost works by establishing
    many independent learners (or classifiers) through random subsamples of the training
    samples using the bootstrap aggregation mechanism. This subsampling process is
    conducted across many iterations, plus the algorithm adds more iterations sequentially
    to adjust the weights of the weak learners [38]. The booster parameter sets the
    type of learner. Usually, this is either a tree or a linear function. In the case
    of trees, the model will consist of an ensemble of trees. In the case of the linear
    booster, it will be a weighted sum of linear functions. In both cases, the XGBoost
    calculates the predicted value as 𝑦 𝑖 ̂ = ∑ 𝑘=1 𝐾 𝑓 𝑘 ( 𝑥 𝑖 ) (13) where fk represents
    the independent learner (or a regression tree), and fk(xi) is the prediction score
    given by that learner for the ith sample. Then, the set of functions fk in the
    regression tree can be learned by minimizing the objective function 𝑂𝑏𝑗= ∑ 𝑖=1
    𝑛 𝑙( 𝑦 𝑖 , 𝑦 𝑖 ̂ )+ ∑ 𝑘=1 𝐾 Ω( 𝑓 𝑘 ) (14) where l is the loss function during
    training, and Ω is a term for penalizing the model complexity to avoid model overfitting.
    It is known that the loss function calculates the difference between the predicted
    value 𝑦 ̂ and the actual value yi [38]. In this study, we selected the objective
    function as <logistic>, with a linear booster <gblinear> for simplicity. 2.5.
    Performance Evaluation of the ML Models Three different performance metrics were
    used in this study to evaluate each developed ML model’s performance and calculate
    its forecasting error for each irrigation system. Empirically, the forecasting
    error is defined as the difference in values between the actual (or observed)
    values and the predicted values given by the model. This can be mathematically
    written as 𝑒 𝑡 =| 𝑦 𝑡 ̂ − 𝑦 𝑡 | (15) where et is the forecasting error, 𝑦 𝑡 ̂
    is the predicted value, and yt is the actual value, all at the same period t.
    Generally, forecasting errors can be divided into two kinds of errors, namely
    residual and prediction errors. The residual errors are calculated using the training
    dataset, while the prediction errors are calculated using the testing and validation
    datasets. In this study, we mainly concentrated on calculating the prediction
    errors using the testing and validating datasets because they are more realistic.
    Two kinds of prediction errors are employed in this study: Scale-dependent errors.
    In this kind of error, the forecast errors are on the same scale as the data themselves.
    The most commonly used scale-dependent errors are root mean square error (RMSE)
    and the mean absolute error (MAE) [39]. RMSE calculates the square root of the
    mean of the squares of all errors of all values. In other words, it measures the
    variance of the residuals. Contrarily, MAE represents the average of the absolute
    difference between the actual and predicted values in the dataset. In other words,
    it measures the average of the residuals in the dataset. RMSE is a differentiable
    function, which makes it easy to perform mathematical operations in comparison
    to the non-differentiable function, such as MAE. The mathematical formulae of
    RMSE and MAE can be given as follows: MSE = mean (et2) (16) 𝖱𝖬𝖲𝖤= 𝖬𝖲𝖤 − − − −
    √ (17) MAE = mean (|et|) (18) Scale-independent errors. In this kind of error,
    the forecast errors are free scale regardless of the data values being small or
    large. One of the most commonly used scale-independent errors is the coefficient
    of determination (usually known as R2). R2 is a performance measure, which provides
    information about the goodness of fit of a model. In the context of regression,
    it represents the proportion of the variance in the dependent variable, which
    is explained by the independent variable [40,41]. Whereas correlation explains
    the strength of the relationship between an independent and dependent variable,
    R2 explains to what extent the variance of one variable explains the variance
    of the other variable. 2.6. Statistical Analysis and ML Hardware and Software
    Platforms The statistical analysis was conducted using analysis of variance (ANOVA)
    for data of meteorological variables, date palm yield, WUE, and electrical energy
    consumption using Statistical Analysis Software, IBM SPSS version 26 (SPSS Inc.,
    Chicago, IL, USA). The Tukey test was used to determine the significant differences
    among the means at p ˂ 0.05. Design Expert software (DX Version 13, Stat-Ease,
    Inc., Minneapolis, MN, USA) was used to graph the irrigation experiment data and
    for optimization of the target parameters and variables. All ML experiments in
    this study were conducted on an HP workstation PC, Intel Core™ i7-6700 CPU at
    3.40 GHz, 16.00 GB RAM ×64 based processor, equipped with an Ubuntu 16.04 operating
    system with python 3.7 software environment. The ML approaches were developed
    using the Keras library with an open-source Tensorflow library in the backend
    [42]. 3. Results and Discussion 3.1. Meteorological Data Description The climate
    of the Al-Ahsa region is characterized by hot dry summers and mild-to-cool winters.
    Rain is very scarce almost everywhere in this region. In the study area, no rain
    was received during summer, and a little rain precipitation was received during
    January and February. Therefore, rain was not considered in this study due to
    its scarcity. Table 1 displays the average yearly data of the meteorological variables
    of sun hour, the minimum, maximum, and average temperature, minimum, maximum,
    average relative humidity (RH), average wind speed, maximum solar irradiance,
    average solar irradiance, and solar radiation. The statistical analysis using
    one-way ANOVA indicated that there were significant differences (p < 0.05) between
    the years of the experiment regarding the sun hour, temperature, minimum RH, average
    wind speed, maximum and average solar irradiance, and solar radiation. There was
    no significant difference for the other variables during the experiment years.
    Table 1. A comparison among the average yearly values (±standard deviation) of
    the meteorological variables of the experimental area for the five years. During
    the experiment years, the coldest month was January with an average daily minimum
    temperature of 11.62 °C and an average daily maximum temperature of 24.09 °C.
    The summer season had the hottest months from May to September, and the highest
    average daily maximum temperature (46.01 °C) was recorded in June, followed by
    July (45.59 °C). The average daily maximum RH during winter ranged between 73.2
    and 63.02%, whereas during summer, it ranged between 46.87 and 29.31%. The average
    daily minimum RH during winter ranged between 27.1 and 25.2%, whereas during summer,
    it ranged between 11.12 and 9.51%. The average daily wind speed ranged from 2.71
    to 4.29 km. The average daily maximum solar irradiance during winter ranged between
    73.2 and 63.02%, whereas during summer, it ranged between 46.87 and 29.31%. The
    highest average daily solar irradiance was recorded in June (0.978 kW/m2) and
    the lowest in January (0.662 kW m2). Figure A1 in the Appendix A shows the average
    daily data of the meteorological variables for five years from 2018 to 2022. 3.2.
    Irrigation Water Applied Figure 6 shows the average yearly data of the irrigation
    water and the cumulative irrigation water applied at irrigation levels. The average
    yearly irrigation water applied upon adjusting the minimum irrigation control
    setpoints at 40, 50, 60, 70, 80, and 90% of AW was 0.089 ± 0.03, 0.119 ± 0.03,
    0.149 ± 0.05, 0.178 ± 0.06, 0.206 ± 0.07, and 0.232 ± 0.08 m3/day/palm, respectively.
    The average cumulative irrigation water applied at 40, 50, 60, 70, 80, and 90%
    AW was 33.43 ± 1.22, 43.89 ± 1.76, 54.32 ± 1.89, 64.32 ± 1.57, 75.65 ± 1.68, and
    85.65 ± 1.87 m3/year/palm, respectively. The statistical analysis using two-way
    ANOVA indicated that there were significant differences (p < 0.01) between the
    irrigation water applied and the cumulative yearly irrigation under different
    irrigation level treatments and date palm ages. The interaction effect of the
    irrigation levels and palm ages on the irrigation water applied (Figure 6a) and
    the cumulative irrigation water (Figure 6b) was plotted on 3D plots using Design
    Expert software. This interaction was significant at p < 0.01 regarding the daily
    irrigation water applied and the yearly cumulative irrigation water. The cumulative
    irrigation water applied in the irrigation level treatments in the current study
    was within the irrigation level range mentioned in many previous studies [5,9,43,44,45,46].
    Figure 6. Amount of daily applied irrigation water (AIW) per date palm tree (a)
    and cumulative yearly applied irrigation water (CAIW) per date palm tree (b) at
    different minimum irrigation control setpoints (%AW) and date palm ages during
    the experiment years from 2018 to 2022. Table 2 shows the reference evapotranspiration
    (ETo), crop evapotranspiration (ETc), target irrigation area, and the reduction
    coefficient (Kr) when the optimal amount of irrigation water is applied based
    on soil moisture sensor-based scheduling controller over the five years of the
    experiment at optimum WUE and date palm yield. The statistical analysis using
    one-way ANOVA indicated that there were significant differences (p < 0.05) between
    the years of the experiment regarding the ETo, ETc, target irrigation area, and
    Kr at optimum WUE and date palm yield. Table 2. Comparison among average yearly
    values (±standard deviation) of reference evapotranspiration (ETo), crop evapotranspiration
    (ETc), target irrigation area, and the reduction coefficient (Kr) at optimum WUE
    and date palm yield for the five years. 3.3. Yield and Water Use Efficiency Figure
    7 displays the effect of irrigation water levels and palm age on the yield (kg/palm)
    under the micro irrigation systems used. The interaction effect of the irrigation
    levels and palm age on palm tree yield under SIS (Figure 7a), SDIS (Figure 7b),
    DIS (Figure 7c), and BIS (Figure 7d) was plotted on 2D plots using Design Expert
    software. According to ANOVA, the date palm age, the irrigation system, and the
    irrigation levels applied had a significant impact (p < 0.05) on the yield of
    the date palm trees tested. Figure 7. Effect of irrigation water levels at the
    different minimum irrigation control setpoints (%AW) and palm ages (year) on palm
    tree yield cv. Khalas (kg/palm) under different micro irrigation systems, i.e.,
    (a) subsurface irrigation system, (b) subsurface drip irrigation system, (c) drip
    irrigation system, and (d) bubbler irrigation system. Figure 7a–d indicated that
    the date palm trees subjected to SIS and SDIS had the highest yield of 64.31 and
    63.28 kg/palm at the irrigation level of 60% AW and 70% AW, followed by DIS (63.2
    kg/palm) and BIS (60.19 kg/palm) systems at 80% AW and 90% AW, respectively. The
    increase in date palm yield at low irrigation levels under SIS and DIS could be
    due to their high efficiency compared to the surface irrigation systems of DIS
    and BIS [5,44]. There were no significant differences regarding the palm tree
    yield when the irrigation level was increased from 60% AW to 90% AW under SIS,
    from 70% AW to 90% AW under SDIS, and from 80% AW to 90% AW under DIS. On the
    other hand, there were significant differences in palm tree yield when the level
    of irrigation was increased from 40% to 90% AW under BIS. The results indicated
    that the yield of date palm trees decreased until, in the following years, it
    stopped at an irrigation level of 40% AW under the two irrigation systems of DIS
    and BIS. This is because, although the date palm trees can withstand prolonged
    abiotic stresses, including drought, the long-term water stress leads to a significant
    reduction in their growth and productivity [47,48,49]. Our results revealed that
    the increased palm tree yield was related to the subsurface irrigation systems’
    optimal availability of soil water, which expedites root growth and enhances the
    uptake of soil nutrients [6,50,51]. Figure 8 displays the effect of irrigation
    water levels and palm ages on the water use efficiency (WUE, kg/m3) under the
    micro irrigation systems used. Figure 8a–d indicated that the date palm trees
    subjected to SIS had the highest WUE of 1.42 kg/m³ at the irrigation level of
    40% AW, followed by SDIS with 1.22 kg/m³ at 50% AW. The highest WUE values were
    0.69 and 0.65 kg/m³ at the irrigation level of 70% AW and 80% AW for DIS and BIS,
    respectively. This is because the use of SIS and SDIS leads to higher yields with
    lower water consumption; SIS and SDIS also provide more stable irrigation water
    conditions for optimal root system growth [52]. The highest yield and WUE were
    reported in date palm cvs. Figure 8. Effect of irrigation water levels at the
    different minimum setpoints (%AW) and palm ages (year) on water use efficiency
    (WUE, kg/palm) under different micro irrigation systems, i.e., (a) subsurface
    irrigation system, (b) subsurface drip irrigation system, (c) drip irrigation
    system, and (d) bubbler irrigation system, of date palm cv. Khalas. Although the
    date palm trees consumed a low amount of irrigation water under SIS and SDIS,
    this amount was highly efficient for fruit production. This is because most of
    the irrigation water applied through subsurface irrigation systems is utilized
    by the palm [53]. SIS and SDIS not only minimize the runoff but also improve soil
    nutrient uptake and prevent irrigation water loss through evaporation [50,51].
    In addition, the drainage losses and evaporation are negligible, and the wetted
    surface spreads across the entire root zone of the tree [5]. The findings in the
    current study were similar to those reported in previous studies [5,44]. 3.4.
    Parameters’ Optimization The optimum WUE and date palm yield were achieved in
    the current study by applying the optimum irrigation water and solar PV energy
    requirements. The optimum irrigation water and solar PV energy requirements were
    determined by optimizing the deficit irrigation water level (% AW) under each
    micro irrigation system. The objective of this optimization is to achieve the
    optimum results in the shortest time, conserve water, reduce the photovoltaic
    energy required, achieve the highest water efficiency and date palm yield, and
    decrease the irrigation cost. The desirability function approach helps analyze
    experiments where the multiple responses must be optimized simultaneously [54].
    The irrigation level is desired to be as small as possible to decrease the irrigation
    cost while maintaining date palm yield and WUE. The optimization criterion determined
    the optimum irrigation level for each irrigation system separately. In this study,
    we executed two criteria to optimize the irrigation water and energy requirements
    for optimum WUE and optimum palm yield. The first criterion was to minimize the
    irrigation water and energy requirements and maximize the WUE using the minimization
    of the irrigation level. The second criterion was to minimize the irrigation water
    and energy requirements and maximize the date palm yield using the minimization
    of the irrigation level. The two criteria were implemented at date palm ages equal
    to 14, 15, 16, 17, and 18 years. Table 3 summarizes the constraints imposed by
    the two criteria for optimizing irrigation water and energy requirements for optimum
    WUE and date palm yield. Table 3. Constraints for optimizing irrigation level
    (IL), applied irrigation water (AIW), electrical energy consumption (EEC), water
    use efficiency (WUE), date palm yield (DPY) at date palm age (DPA) equal to each
    age (EEA) of 14, 15, 16, 17, and 18 years, under two criteria. The best solutions
    for satisfying the optimization criteria are shown in Table 4. In this study,
    the nearest irrigation level to the irrigation level that was found for satisfying
    the optimization criteria was used to determine the optimum parameters. Based
    on these optima, the datasets were prepared to develop the ML prediction models.
    Table 4 shows the average values of water use efficiency (WUE), date palm yield,
    irrigation water applied at optimum WUE, irrigation water applied at optimum yield,
    the electrical energy consumed at optimum WUE, the electrical energy consumed
    at optimum yield under micro irrigation systems, and date palm ages. Table 4.

    water at optimum yield (AIW2), the electrical energy consumed at optimum WUE (EEC1),
    the electrical energy consumed at optimum yield (EEC2) under micro irrigation
    systems, and date palm ages. 3.5. Variables’ Correlation Figure 9 shows the correlation
    among the meteorological variables (sun hour, the minimum, maximum, and average
    temperature, minimum, maximum, and average RH, average wind speed, maximum solar
    irradiance, average solar irradiance, and solar radiation), irrigation water applied
    at optimum water use efficiency and optimum palm yield, and electrical energy
    consumption at optimum water use efficiency and optimum palm yield. The darker
    blue color indicates the highly positive correlation between the variables and
    the parameters. The darker red color indicates the highly negative correlation
    between the variables and the parameters. The light color indicates that there
    is no correlation between the variables and the parameters. Figure 9 indicates
    a positive significant correlation with a correlation coefficient ranging from
    0.312 to 0.948 among the sun hour, the maximum temperature, the minimum temperature,
    the average temperature, average wind speed, maximum solar irradiance, average
    solar irradiance, and solar radiation, irrigation water applied at optimum water
    use efficiency and optimum palm yield, and electrical energy consumption at optimum
    water use efficiency and optimum palm yield. This table also indicates a significant
    correlation with a correlation coefficient ranging from −0.344 to −0.748 among
    maximum RH, minimum RH, and average RH, irrigation water applied at optimum water
    use efficiency and optimum palm yield, and electrical energy consumption at optimum
    water use efficiency and optimum palm yield. The relation between the meteorological
    variables and irrigation water and energy requirements obtained in the present
    study is similar to many previous studies [6,9,13,55]. Figure 9. The correlation
    among the meteorological variables, irrigation water applied, and electrical energy
    consumption. SR, T max, T min, T avg, RH max, RH min, RH avg, WS avg, SI max,
    SI avg, SR, AIW1 and AIW2, and EEC1 and EEC2 refer to sun hour, the maximum temperature,
    minimum temperature, average temperature, maximum RH, minimum RH, average RH,
    average wind speed, maximum solar irradiance, average solar irradiance, solar
    radiation, reference evapotranspiration, crop evapotranspiration, applied irrigation
    water at optimum water use efficiency and optimum palm yield, and electrical energy
    consumption at optimum water use efficiency and optimum palm yield, respectively.
    3.6. Evaluation of the Prediction Models Based on the results of the irrigation
    experiments, we selected the data of optimum irrigation water amount that presented
    significant optimum values of water use efficiency (WUE) (the first option) or
    optimum yields (the second option) to develop the LR, SVR, LSTM, and XGBoost prediction
    models for all micro irrigation systems. The deficit irrigation percentages selected
    based on the optimum WUE and optimum yield were 40% and 60% AW for SIS, 50% and
    70% AW for SDIS, 70% and 80% AW for DIS, and 110% and 125% AW for BIS, respectively.
    These parameters were selected to predict the irrigation water requirements and
    the electrical energy requirements when the target is to achieve optimum WUE and
    when the target is to achieve optimum crop yield using solar-powered micro irrigation
    systems (SIS, SDIS, DIS, and BIS). This will conserve irrigation water and produce
    optimum yields in arid regions where water scarcity is a significant concern [5,6,9,44].
    The evaluation results shown in Table 5 and Table 6 are based on the testing dataset
    only. Table 5. Comparison among evaluation values of three performance metrics
    for ML models based on the testing dataset for predicting the irrigation water
    requirements (IWR1) and the electrical energy requirements (EER1) when the target
    is to achieve the optimum water use efficiency using different solar-powered micro
    irrigation systems based on limited meteorological data, i.e., average temperature,
    RH, wind speed, solar irradiance, and date palm age. Table 6. Comparison among
    evaluation values of three performance metrics for ML models based on the testing
    dataset for predicting the irrigation water requirements (IWR2) and the electrical
    energy requirements (EER2) when the target is to achieve the optimum date palm
    yield using different solar-powered micro irrigation systems based on limited
    meteorological data, i.e., average temperature, RH, wind speed, solar irradiance,
    and date palm age. Table 5 shows the comparison among the ML models for predicting
    the irrigation water and electrical energy requirements based on limited meteorological
    data, i.e., average temperature, RH, wind speed, solar irradiance, and date palm
    age, for each irrigation system separately. The evaluation is conducted using
    three performance metrics, RMSE, MAE, and R2. The lower the value of RMSE and
    MAE, the higher the accuracy of an ML model. In addition, higher values of R2
    that are close to 1.0 are considered optimum. Moreover, Table 6 shows the same
    comparison among the four ML models but for predicting the irrigation water and
    electrical energy requirements for each irrigation system separately. 3.7. Analysis
    of the Prediction Results It is clear from both Table 5 and Table 6 that both
    the LSTM and XGBoost models outperformed the other two methods, namely the LR
    and SVR. In addition, the LSTM surpassed XGBoost in accuracy on the level of all
    irrigation systems. Therefore, we recommend using the LSTM model to predict irrigation
    water and electrical energy requirements, whether the target is optimum WUE or
    optimum crop yield through different solar-powered micro irrigation systems. Even
    though the experimental results identified LSTM as the best ML model, in the following,
    we will show the advantages and disadvantages of each model based on our observations
    during experiments. In order to perform a logic analysis, we will compare the
    performance of the lower two models together and the performance of the higher
    two models together. 3.7.1. Comparison between LR and SVR These two models are
    similar, since both of them are based on the standard regression concept; however,
    there are a few differences. The advantage of using the linear regression approach
    is that limited data are required to train this model. In addition, during our
    experiments, it showed less computational complexity compared to other models,
    particularly when predicting the model’s parameters [56]. However, since the irrigation
    system parameters are highly nonlinear, with complex changing dynamics, linear
    regression will be suitable for parameters with linear relationships between the
    predictor and the target [57]. However, in this case, the model may suffer underperformance
    for a problem, which is nonlinear [7]. Our study here is not unique in using SVR
    in sustainable farming; rather, it is used widely in this domain. For example,
    it was used by Goap et al. in Ref [58] to predict soil moisture content using
    meteorological data and farm sensing data. The prediction choices are made based
    on the amount of soil moisture and precipitation to save water resources. In the
    irrigation management domain, Vij et al. [59] used SVR to automate irrigation
    forecasts by establishing a hyperplane per dimension. In their study, the class
    labels are chosen, such that the distance between the hyperplanes utilized to
    identify the best linear classifier is as little as feasible [7]. In our experiments,
    we noticed that SVR is simple and more powerful than the standard linear regression
    model. Moreover, we found SVR to be a very time-efficient technique, even though
    our data and thereby the feature space are highly dimensional. Since our dataset
    samples are homogenous and mostly noiseless, SVR has a good performance. However,
    if the data are noisy and include outliers, it is possible that SVR’s performance
    will degrade drastically [60]. 3.7.2. Comparison between XGBoost and LSTM XGBoost
    is a tree-based method; however, the LSTM is a neural-network-based model. XGBoost
    is an ensemble of trees, where each tree is associated with a separate input–output
    mapping. The final output of the technique represents the weighted sum of the
    outputs of all the trees (or even linear functions). This process is established
    in an iterative procedure [61]. In such a sparse environment of trees, XGBoost
    does not perform well and is very sensitive to outliers because every tree is
    obliged to fix the defects of predecessor trees. Moreover, it is demonstrated
    that it is hardly a scalable technique [62]. In contrast, LSTM, or ANN in general,
    is inspired by the biological neural network in the human brain. ANN simulates
    neurons and synapses by connecting the artificial neurons. Artificial neurons
    are typically aggregated into a number of layers, where the connection among layers
    transmits the input signals from layer to layer. This architecture gives LSTMs
    more advantages over tree-based methods, such as XGBoost. Recently, a deep architecture
    for LSTM was developed to model uni-, multi-, and hierarchical time series data
    in several applications, such as petroleum production [63] and energy consumption
    [31], to mention a few. In our experiments here, we employed a deep architecture
    for LSTM, and we found it superior to XGBoost, as shown in Table 5 and Table 6.
    The superiority in the performance of LSTM over XGBoost and other models is intuitive
    and logical in the scope of each method’s characteristics. LR fits a straight
    line (or a plane), which minimizes the discrepancies between the actual values
    and the predicted ones [64]. SVR transforms the original feature space into a
    high-dimensional space. It tries to find a linear mapping in the new space as
    a sum of nonlinear kernel functions in the original space [65]. For both LR and
    SVR, the assumption of linearity between variables makes both of them quite prone
    to overfitting and sensitive to outliers, particularly if the data are complex,
    as is the case in our dataset, which includes 12 input features. Moreover, such
    decision boundary-based models, such as the SVR, will not perform well, especially
    when the dataset has noise and where the target classes may overlap [31]. In addition
    to the human-brain-like architecture, LSTM has more properties, which make it
    very suitable for handling sequential data, such as the meteorological data we
    have here. First, they can remember information for longer periods; therefore,
    they are capable of handling long-term dependencies among historical data [63].
    Second, they can learn high-level representations, which capture the structure
    of the data, making LSTMs very efficient for modeling complex sequential data.
    These reasons make LSTMs the most powerful neural network technique, which can
    achieve forecasting tasks, especially when there is a long-term trend in the data,
    as in our situation here [66]. Notwithstanding, it is worth mentioning that XGBoost
    was faster than LSTM in our experiments. Therefore, it is recommended to use XGBoost
    to achieve feature selection before using LSTM for prediction, which ensures improvement
    in the overall performance of LSTM [30]. Furthermore, using deep architecture
    or more hidden layers in LSTM will improve the performance drastically. 3.8. Validation
    of the Best ML Model Based on the performance evaluation of the ML models developed,
    the LSTM was used to predict the optimum irrigation water requirement based on
    the limited meteorological data, i.e., average temperature, RH, wind speed, solar
    irradiance, and date palm age of 18 years, for each micro irrigation system used.
    Table 7 shows the evaluation of the LSTM model at the validation phase for predicting
    the irrigation water and energy requirements when the target is to achieve optimal
    WUS and when the target is to achieve optimal date palm yield. This validation
    was conducted to ensure that the LSTM model can accurately predict the irrigation
    water and energy requirements based on the input variables. The evaluation metrics’
    values indicated that the LSTM model can efficiently predict the irrigation water
    and energy requirements, as shown in Table 7. Table 7. Evaluation values of three
    performance metrics for LSTM models based on the validation dataset for predicting
    the irrigation water requirements (IWR1) and the electrical energy requirements
    (EER1) for optimum water use efficiency and for predicting the irrigation water
    requirements (IWR2) and the electrical energy requirements (EER2) for optimum
    date palm yield using the solar-powered micro irrigation systems. Figure 10 compares
    the observed irrigation water applied and the predicted water requirements under

    and BIS (Figure 10d) using the LSTM prediction model developed based on the limited
    meteorological data, i.e., average temperature, RH, wind speed, solar irradiance,
    and date palm age, when the target is to achieve optimum WUE. Figure 10. Observed

    11 compares the observed irrigation water applied and the predicted water requirements
    under the irrigation systems of SIS (Figure 11a), SDIS (Figure 11b), DIS (Figure
    11c), and BIS (Figure 11d) using the LSTM prediction model developed based on
    the limited meteorological data, i.e., average temperature, RH, wind speed, solar
    irradiance, and date palm age, when the target is to achieve optimum WUE. The
    predicted and the observed irrigation water requirements were approximately similar
    for the majority of the required amounts, where the predicted irrigation water
    requirements curve was almost identical to the observed irrigation water applied
    curve under all irrigation systems throughout the year, as shown in Figure 10
    and Figure 11. Figure 11. Observed vs. predicted values of electrical energy requirements

    ensuring agricultural sustainability in countries with land and water shortages.
    In this study, we developed four machine-learning models, namely linear regression,
    support vector regression, the LSTM neural network, and XGBoost. We employed these
    models to predict the optimum irrigation water and energy requirements for date
    palm irrigation. In order to achieve this target, we prepared a dataset, which
    included limited meteorological data, i.e., average temperature, RH, wind speed,
    and solar irradiance from 2018 to 2022, and date palm age in these years, actual
    irrigation water applied, and energy consumed by four surface and subsurface solar-powered
    micro irrigation systems to achieve the optimum water use efficiency and date
    palm yield. In order to perform a fair evaluation, we utilized 60%, 20%, and 20%
    of the overall dataset in training, testing, and validating, respectively, the
    ML models. The empirical results indicated that the irrigation levels at the minimum
    irrigation control setpoints of 40% and 60% AW for SIS, 50% and 70% AW for SDIS,
    70% and 80% AW for DIS, and 80% and 90% AW for BIS, respectively, achieved optimum
    WUE and optimum yield. Based on the evaluation of the ML models developed, the
    best model for predicting the irrigation water and energy requirements for achieving
    optimum WUE and yield targets was the LSTM, followed by XGBoost. The validation
    result of the LSTM model showed its ability to predict the water and energy requirements
    for all irrigation systems with high accuracy based on the limited meteorological
    variables and date palm tree ages. However, this study was performed in only one
    cultivar of date palm (Khalas cv.), and the irrigation water and energy requirements
    of irrigation systems could be different for drought-resistant or other date palm
    cultivars under different conditions. Therefore, further study is needed to train
    the ML models to consider other conditions not addressed in this study. Future
    research will concentrate on more date palm cultivars and irrigation methods to
    improve the ML models developed, which could also be adapted to predict the irrigation
    water and energy requirements for other cultivars of agricultural and economic
    importance or other perennial fruit trees. Author Contributions Conceptualization,

  description: Quantitatively analyzing models’ uncertainty is essential for agricultural
    models due to the effect of inputs parameters and processes on increasing models’
    uncertainties. The main aim of the current study was to explore the influence
    of input parameter uncertainty on the output of the well-known surface irrigation
    software model of WinSRFR. The generalized likelihood uncertainty estimation (GLUE)
    framework was used to explicitly evaluate the uncertainty model of WinSRFR. The
    epistemic uncertainties of WinSRFR furrow irrigation simulations, including the
    advance front curve, flow depth hydrograph, and runoff hydrograph, were assessed
    in response to change key input parameters related to the Kostiakov–Lewis infiltration
    function, Manning’s roughness coefficient, and the geometry cross section. Three
    likelihood measures of Nash–Sutcliffe efficiency (NSE), percentage bias (PBIAS),
    and the coefficient of determination (R2) were used in GLUE analysis for selecting
    behavioral estimations of the model outputs. The uncertainty of the WinSRFR model
    was investigated under two furrow irrigation system conditions, closed end and
    open end. The results showed the likelihood measures considerably influence the
    width of uncertainty bounds. WinSRFR outputs have high uncertainty for cross section
    parameters relative to soil infiltration and roughness parameters. Parameters
    of soil infiltration and roughness coefficient play an important role in reducing
    the uncertainty bound width and number of observations, especially by filtering
    non-behavioral data using likelihood measures. The simulation errors of advance
    front curve and runoff hydrograph outputs with a PBIAS function were relatively
    lower and stable compared with other those of the likelihood functions. The 95%
    prediction uncertainties (95PPU) of the advance front curve were calculated to
    be 87.5% in both close-ended and open-ended conditions whereas, it was 91.18%
    for the runoff hydrograph in the open-ended condition. Additionally, the NSE likelihood
    function more explicitly determined the uncertainty related to flow depth hydrograph
    estimations. The outputs of the model showed more uncertainty and instability
    in response to variability in soil infiltration parameters than the roughness
    coefficient did. Therefore, applying accurate field methods and equipment and
    proper measurements of soil infiltration is recommended. The results highlight
    the importance of accurately monitoring and determining model input parameters
    to access a suitable level of WinSRFR uncertainty. In conclusion, considering
    and analyzing the uncertainty of input parameters of WinSRFR models is critical
    and could provide a reference to obtain realistic and stable furrow irrigation
    simulations.

    analyzing models’ uncertainty is essential for agricultural models due to the
    effect of inputs parameters and processes on increasing models’ uncertainties.
    The main aim of the current study was to explore the influence of input parameter
    uncertainty on the output of the well-known surface irrigation software model
    of WinSRFR. The generalized likelihood uncertainty estimation (GLUE) framework
    was used to explicitly evaluate the uncertainty model of WinSRFR. The epistemic

    big data 1. Introduction Surface irrigation is the most common irrigation method
    because it requires less energy and is less expensive than sprinklers and drip
    irrigation are. Nowadays, the accurate design of irrigation systems using soft
    computing technologies is a common agricultural issue. The accurate design of
    surface irrigation can affect water resource management and soil moisture, which
    are two important components of Earth system science [1,2]. In this case, interconnections
    between irrigation management and Earth system science manifests through variability
    in the water use efficiency, irrigation performance indicators [3,4], evapotranspiration,
    runoff, soil temperature, carbon balance, etc., [1]. Furrow irrigation is one
    of the most common surface irrigation techniques among farmers due to the better
    aeration in the plant root development zone, in which water is conveyed over the
    field surface by gravitational force [5,6]. Furrow irrigation with two boundary
    conditions, closed end and open end, is common in agricultural fields. The unsuitable
    design, management, and implementation of furrow irrigation systems result in
    a poor performance and lead to some problems such as low distribution uniformity
    and application efficiency and deep percolation [7]. Several agricultural models
    such as WinSRFR have been developed mathematically to accurately design and improve
    the performance of the water flow in furrow irrigation systems [8]. Existing irrigation
    design models generally have high accuracy, but suffer from unstable estimations.
    The WinSRFR model simulates the water flow of furrow irrigation systems, based
    on the one-dimensional open channel flow equation coupled with an infiltration
    function. Acquiring precise and reliable model input parameters is always a problem
    for these types of models with different and large numbers of input parameters
    [9]. As stated by Beven and Binley [10], the investigation of the uncertainty
    of parameters is necessary for model uncertainty assessment to avoid instability
    problems in the model and decrease the number of errors in simulations. Even though
    the model’s uncertainty cannot be reduced by an uncertainty analysis in terms
    of the model simulation, it determines the risk of the estimation level and evaluates
    the reliability of its other results [9]. The literature lacks work on uncertainty
    assessments associated with WinSRFR furrow irrigation simulations. Limited research,
    however, has generally examined only the error sources and uncertainties for optimally
    implementing irrigation. For instance, Mun et al. [11] investigated the uncertainties
    in relationships and parameters of the Mississippi Irrigation Scheduling Tool
    (MIST) to calculate the water balance. For this purpose, they used the recorded
    data of cultivated maize, cotton, and soybean (2005–2012) and the Taylor series
    method. The results showed this model had acceptable accuracy in simulating management
    and irrigation strategies. Choliz and Sarasa [12] studied uncertainty sources
    in modern technologies to improve irrigation water efficiency for farming (with
    emphasis on uncertainty related to the time of the introduction and take-up of
    new technology) in the regions with a semi-arid climate using data of the most
    extensive irrigation plan in Ebro River Basin (Spain), as well as the Computable
    General Equilibrium (CGE) model. Kisekka et al. [13] investigated the uncertainties
    in leaching assessment using the water balance approach. They found that factors
    such as soil heterogeneity, non-uniform distribution of irrigation water, changes
    in canopy size, and plant root distribution at the time and the preferred path
    flow could lead to errors in leaching estimates. Mondaca-Duarte et al. [14] investigated
    the correlation between the volume of irrigation water, crop stress, and drainage
    in order to reduce the amount of water used in surface irrigation and improve
    the yield. They presented a two-module model considering uncertain evapotranspiration
    and soil properties. In this model, one module was employed to evaluate the water
    movement, and another module was used to examine evapotranspiration. The Monte
    Carlo method was applied to assess drainage uncertainties (based on uncertainties
    in evaporation and soil properties). The results indicated the volume of irrigation
    water and drainage could be reduced to 22% and 88%, respectively, in case of a
    crop stress value of less than 1%. The application of furrow irrigation simulation
    using the WinSRFR model depends on accurate estimation or measurement of the most
    effective input parameters [15,16]. Soil infiltration and Manning’s roughness
    coefficient are considered to be fundamental parameters in furrow irrigation design,
    assessment, and management [17,18,19]. Soil infiltration is affected by several
    factors, including the soil water content, soil texture, soil structure, and soil
    organic matter. Additionally, Manning’s roughness coefficient can be significantly
    affected by the physical characteristics of furrows, including crop density, filed
    slope, and soil texture [4]. Oyonarte et al. [20] and Bai et al. [21] reported
    that application efficiency and distribution uniformity of irrigation system is
    highly influenced by infiltration variability. Sepaskhah and Bonder [22] evaluated
    the effect of different inflow rates and slopes on changes in Manning’s roughness
    coefficient in furrow irrigation under both cultivated and uncultivated conditions.
    The most roughness was observed in the first irrigation scheme. However, it decreased
    by 60–70% in the second and third schemes. Finally, the roughness coefficient
    increased due to seedling emergence. Mailapalli et al. [23] studied the temporal
    and spatial variation in Manning’s roughness coefficient in furrow irrigation
    under different inflow conditions. The results showed that the roughness coefficient
    had the highest value in the second and last quarters. The roughness coefficient
    decreased over time, and the decreasing trend was faster at low inflow rates.
    Kamali et al. [19] found a negative correlation between the inflow rate and roughness
    coefficient. In addition, their results showed that the roughness coefficient
    at the downstream segment of the furrows was greater than the proposed values
    were due to the soil texture and cultivation type. This coefficient in the middle
    part of the furrows was greater than the values recorded in the upstream segment
    of the furrows were. Xu et al. [24] indicated that variations in soil infiltration
    and Manning’s roughness coefficient significantly influence water advance and
    recession curves. Mazarei et al. [4] evaluated the effect of temporal variability
    and different inflow rates on the infiltration parameters, roughness coefficient,
    and furrow irrigation performance. The results revealed that Manning’s coefficient
    decreased, and the final infiltration rate increased with an increasing inflow
    rate. As well as soil infiltration and roughness parameters, the geometry cross
    section of surface irrigation systems, including the slope, length, and bottom
    width, can be effective parameters [25,26,27]. The furrow cross sections are approximated
    by fitting a trapezoid or power law to the experimental data. However, these empirical
    geometry cross section relationships are subjected to a significant error [28].
    Eldeiry et al. [29] simulated the furrow irrigation performance in clay soil and
    indicated that the furrow cross-section varied at different lengths and its accurate
    estimation had a significant effect on improving the flow advance time prediction.
    Navabian et al. [30] introduced hydraulic parameters of the furrow cross-section
    as one of the most influential factors in the performance of cutback furrow irrigation
    and simulated the performance of this system using experimental functions. The
    obtained results had desirable accuracy compared to that of the zero-inertia model
    (SRFR) and observed values. As reported by Bo et al. [27], the application of
    appropriate field geometry properties could enhance the irrigation application
    efficiency by up to 26.7%. Salahou et al. [31] applied the WinSRFR model to investigate
    the influence of several parameters, such as bottom slopes, surface roughness
    values, and inflow rates, on the performance of surface irrigation. However, despite
    the long history of research studies on surface irrigation modeling, current furrow
    irrigation models do not consider uncertainty in their simulation results. The
    probability factor and some uncontrollable physical factors are the main problems
    in recognizing different phenomena. Therefore, uncertainty analysis of each phenomenon
    provides a real and proper understanding of the role of the factors affecting
    the phenomenon [32]. Given that simulation models are increasingly being used
    to make decisions about management options in various phenomena, the accurate
    calibration and analysis of uncertainties have particular importance. These models
    are generally affected by large uncertainties, including conceptual models, input
    data, and parameter uncertainties. Applying novel uncertainty analysis methods
    such as generalized likelihood uncertainty estimation (GLUE) could provide accurate
    results for decisions about the applicability of models. The GLUE technique applied
    in this study has been widely used for the parameter uncertainty analysis of agricultural
    models, including the soil water assessment tool (SWAT) model [33], CERES-Maize
    model [34], soil–water–atmosphere–plant (SWAP) model [35], rice growth model ORYZA_V3
    [36], CERES-Wheat model [37], DayCent agroecosystem model [38], and HORTSYST model
    [39]. These studies demonstrate how the results of the parameter uncertainty affect
    the model outputs. The review of available studies reveals that the uncertainty
    analysis of the output of surface irrigation simulation models, especially furrow
    irrigation, has never been addressed. Therefore, the main aim of the current study
    is the first attempt to evaluate the effects of the Kostiakov–Lewis infiltration
    equation, Manning’s roughness coefficient, and cross-sectional parameters on the
    performance and reliability predictions of the WinSRFR model in open- and closed-ended
    furrows. For this aim, the GLUE framework is employed to investigate the uncertainty
    degree of the output results, including advance curve, flow depth hydrograph,
    and runoff hydrograph. The contribution and novelty of this study relies upon
    exploring the capability of the WinSRFR model of accurately designing furrow irrigation
    and predicting outputs. According to the above explanations, the contribution
    of this study are arranged as follows: Evaluating the outputs uncertainty of the
    WinSRFR model in an innovative way, including advance curve, flow depth hydrograph,
    and runoff hydrograph, using the GLUE framework in response to Kostiakov–Lewis
    infiltration equation, Manning’s roughness coefficient, and cross-sectional parameters
    sets based on the experimental data of a furrow irrigation system. Assessing the
    reliability predictions of WinSRFR model for two open- and closed-ended of furrow
    irrigating systems. Investigating the effects of three likelihood functions, the
    coefficient of determination (R2), Nash–Sutcliffe efficiency (NSE), and percentage
    bias (PBIAS), on the parameter set performance and uncertainty analysis of the
    WinSRFR model. 2. Materials and Methods It is difficult to model irrigation flow
    because of numerous uncertainties. Previous studies about WinSRFR exclusively
    focused on the calibration model to investigate irrigation processes. The uncertainties
    associated with modeling the front curve, depth hydrograph, and runoff hydrograph
    based on the variations in infiltration, geometry, and roughness parameters were
    not considered. Using accurate inputs such as cross-sectional geometry, infiltration,
    and roughness contributes to significant uncertainties. As described in the previous
    section, the main objective of the current study is investigating the uncertainty
    of advance curve, flow depth hydrograph, and runoff hydrograph estimations as
    outputs of the WinSRFR model using the GLUE framework in response to variabilities
    in Kostiakov–Lewis infiltration equation, Manning’s roughness coefficient, and
    the cross-sectional input parameters sets. 2.1. Description of WinSRFR Model Since
    water flow in surface irrigation is unsteadily non-uniform and depends on the
    water infiltration rate into the soil, a pair of partial differential equations
    called Saint-Venant equations are used in surface irrigation models. These equations
    are used for describing the process of water movement, which include continuity
    and momentum equations as follows, as stated in [40]. ∂𝑄 ∂𝑥 + ∂𝐴 ∂𝑡 + 𝐼 𝑥 =0 (1)
    1 𝑔 ∂𝑣 ∂𝑡 + 𝑣 𝑔 ∂𝑣 ∂𝑥 + ∂𝑦 ∂𝑥 = 𝑆 0 − 𝑆 𝑓 + 𝑣 𝐼 𝑥 𝑔𝐴 (2) where 𝑦 is the water
    depth (m), 𝑄 is the inflow (m3·s−1), 𝑡 is the irrigation time (s), 𝑣 is the flow
    velocity (m·s−1), 𝑥 is distance from the beginning of the furrow (m), 𝐼 𝑥 is the
    infiltration rate (m3·s−1·m−1), 𝑔 is the acceleration of gravity (m·s−2), 𝑆 0
    is the bed slope (m·m−1), 𝑆 𝑓 is the energy line slope (m·m−1), and 𝐴 is the flow
    cross-section (m2). Saint-Vanant equations do not have analytical solutions. Therefore,
    different software packages have been presented considering simplified hypotheses
    and numerical methods to solve these equations simultaneously and simulate surface
    irrigation. WinSRFR software 5.1, which was developed in 2004, is a one-dimensional
    mathematical model used for analyzing and simulating surface irrigation. This
    software has many applications in the design and management of surface irrigation
    and consists of four parts for the hydraulic analysis of surface irrigation, including
    simulation, event analysis (field evaluation), physical design, and operation
    analysis [8]. WinSRFR software performs the necessary calculations using zero-inertia
    model (in which inertia has been omitted and is applicable to farms with closed
    ends and slopes of less than 0.004), as well as kinematic-wave model (in which
    flow depth gradient and inertia have been omitted and are applicable to slopes
    greater than or equal to 0.004). WinSRFR software could estimate the amount of
    infiltrated water by different equations such as Kostiakov, Kostiakov–Lewis, and
    Green-Ampt [41]. In the present study, the Kostiakov–Lewis infiltration equation
    was used. This model could simulate furrow irrigation on negative slopes and adapt
    to variable inflow rates [42]. However, the simulations obtained by this model
    may face uncertainties due to a large number of software input parameters, as
    well as temporal and spatial variations in the parameters such as infiltration,
    surface roughness, and furrow cross-sectional dimensions. 2.2. Description of
    Important Input Parameters of WinSRFR Model 2.2.1. Geometry Cross Section The
    cross section of the furrow irrigation systems may be trapezoidal or parabolic.
    The trapezoidal shape of furrow irrigation system consists of two factors, bottom
    width (BW) and side slope (SS). The relationship between cross-sectional factors
    of BW and SS with flow top width (TW) at a given flow depth (y) can be described
    using the following equation adapted from [43]. 𝑇𝑊=𝐵𝑊+2×𝑦×𝑆𝑆 (3) The relationships
    between wetted perimeter, flow area, and hydraulic radius flow in the WinSRFR
    model follow from Equation (3). 2.2.2. Kostiakov–Lewis Infiltration Function In
    this study, the Kostiakov–Lewis infiltration function was used to determine soil
    infiltration. The following equation calculates the cumulative infiltrated volume
    as a function of time, as elaborated on in [4]. 𝑍=𝑘 𝑡 𝑎 + 𝑓 0 𝑡 (4) where Z is
    the cumulative volume of infiltration per furrow length (m3·m−1), t is the time
    period of infiltration (min), f0 is the steady infiltration rate (m3·m−1·min−1),
    and k and a are the fitted empirical coefficients. Furthermore, the steady infiltration
    rate is calculated as follows based on the equation provided in [25]. 𝑓 0 = 𝑄
    𝑖𝑛 − 𝑄 𝑜𝑢𝑡 𝐿 (5) where Qin is the inflow rate (m3·min−1), Qout is the outflow
    rate (m3·min−1), and L is the furrow length (m). 2.2.3. Manning’s Roughness Coefficient
    One of the main parameters for designing and evaluating a furrow irrigation system
    is Manning’s roughness coefficient. The equation for calculating this coefficient
    can be written as follows [22]. 𝑛= 𝐴 5 3 𝑆 − − √ 𝑄 𝑃 2 3 (6) where A is the area
    of the furrow cross section (m2), S is the longitudinal slope of the water surface
    (m·m−1), Q is the inflow rate (m3·s−1), and P is the wetted perimeter of the furrow
    cross section (m). 2.3. Generalized Likelihood Uncertainty Estimation (GLUE) The
    GLUE methodology was initially described by Beven and Binley [10] and has been
    widely used for the uncertainty analysis of different models and predictions.
    In this study, the GLUE framework was implemented to investigate WinSRFR model’s
    reliability and estimate the uncertainty of model outputs. The GLUE analysis process
    includes the following three important levels, as stated in [44]. Step 1: Monte
    Carlo simulation is implemented to create random sample sets (m = 1000) of input
    parameters from those of the prior distribution. The optimal prior distribution
    of each parameter was determined based on the evaluation of 65 distribution functions.
    Step 2: The likelihood value is computed from WinSRFR model outputs to measure
    goodness-of-fit and evaluate the model input parameters. By considering a particular
    threshold value for the likelihood function, the model input parameters data are
    classified into two categories of behavioral (value above the threshold likelihood)
    and non-behavioral (value below the threshold likelihood) sets. Then, the behavioral
    sets are used to assess the WinSRFR model. In the current study, three likelihood
    measures of R2, NSE, and PBIAS were used to assess the performance of each parameter
    set. The likelihood functions are as follows. 𝐿 1 ( 𝜃 𝑖 |𝑂)=R 2 = ∑ 𝑁 𝑗=1 ( 𝑃
    𝑗 ( 𝜃 𝑖 )− 𝑂        ) 2 ∑ 𝑁 𝑗=1 ( 𝑂 𝑗 − 𝑂        ) 2 ,𝑡ℎ𝑟𝑒𝑠ℎ𝑜𝑙𝑑

     ) 2 ∑ 𝑁 𝑗=1 ( 𝑃 𝑗 ( 𝜃 𝑖 )− 𝑃 𝑗 ( 𝜃 𝑖 )                   

    where 𝜃 𝑖 is the ith parameter set, 𝐿( 𝜃 𝑖 |𝑂) is the likelihood value for the
    parameter set of 𝜃 𝑖 , 𝑃 𝑗 ( 𝜃 𝑖 ) is the model estimation using the parameter
    set, 𝑂 𝑗 is the jth observation, 𝑂        is the mean value of observation,
    and N is the total number of data. The ranges of R2, NSE, and PBIAS were from
    0 to 1, −∞ to 1, and −1 to 1, respectively. In this study, simulations that had
    a likelihood value of NSE that was less than or equal to 0.5 were rejected as
    non-behavioral, and the others (NSE > 0.5) were retained for further analyses.
    Additionally, the threshold values of R2 > 0.6 and −0.25 < PBIAS < 0.25 were used
    to identify behavioral simulations. The behavioral parameter sets were applied
    to extract the posterior distributions and calibration parameters of the Kostiakov–Lewis
    infiltration equation, Manning’s roughness coefficient, and cross section. Step
    3: Simulation weights of the behavioral parameter sets were normalized to unity,
    and the cumulative weighted distributions of estimations were used to evaluate
    the uncertainty associated with the model simulations. 𝜗 𝑖 = 𝐿( 𝜃 𝑖 ) ∑ 𝑁 𝑘=1
    𝐿( 𝜃 𝑘 ) (10) where 𝜗 𝑖 is a likelihood weight. Normalized behavioral likelihoods
    were plotted against the simulation values (dotted plots) defined the cumulative
    probability and posterior parameter distribution. Additionally, for plotting posterior
    distributions, the normalized likelihoods for different simulations were multiplied
    by the prior probability. These plots provide a basis for understanding uncertainty
    adjusted by the observations [45]. 2.4. Data Sets In this study, the data of four
    furrows collected by Perea [46] were used. These data were collected from the
    Maricopa Agricultural Center (MAC), University of Arizona, in 2004. Table 1 summarizes
    some of the geometric and hydraulic characteristics of furrows adapted from [46].
    The studied soil had a homogeneous texture with a slope of zero degree. The furrow
    length was 168.6 m. Moreover, one furrow had an open end, and the other furrow
    had a closed end. Water flow entered the furrows through the upstream supply channel
    using two pumps and was measured using a totalizing meter. Additionally, an RBC
    flume was used at the beginning and end of the furrow to measure the total inflow
    rate and outflow runoff, respectively. In total, 7 measuring stations were set
    up at distances of 3.05, 30.48, 60.96, 91.44, 121.90, 152.40, and 168.50 m from
    the furrow inlet. The field elevation, furrow cross-sectional area, advance, and
    recession time, as well as depth hydrograph, were recorded and measured per station.
    The furrow cross-sectional area was measured using a profilometer and digital
    photographs. Table 1. Some geometrical properties of tested furrows. 2.5. Evaluation
    Criteria Two criteria of p-factor and r-factor were used to investigate the model’s
    uncertainty. The p-factor describes the percentage of bracketed observations between
    two boundaries of 2.5% and 97.5% and shows 95% prediction uncertainty (95PPU).
    If the 95PPU bound of model outputs cover most of observation data, the uncertainty
    level is appropriate [47]. The acceptable level of uncertainty in simulations
    occurs when the 95PPU includes the 80–90% of the observation data in the advance
    curve, flow depth hydrograph, and runoff hydrograph. r-factor shows the width
    of the uncertainty bound and is the mean of the 95PPU range [47]. Achieving less
    uncertainty is possible if the r-factor value is less than 1. 𝑝=100× 𝑐𝑜𝑢𝑛𝑡(𝑃|
    𝑃 𝐿 ≤𝑃≤ 𝑃 𝑈 ) 𝑁 (11) 𝑟= 1 𝑁×𝜎 ∑( 𝑃 𝐿 − 𝑃 𝑈 ) (12) where N is the number of observations,
    𝜎 is the standard deviation of observations, and 𝑃 𝐿 and 𝑃 𝑈 are the lower and
    upper boundaries of the 95% prediction uncertainty, respectively. Additionally,
    the Taylor diagram was used for comparing the results based on graphical interpretation.
    Both estimated and observed data are presented in the Taylor diagram using three
    criteria of correlation coefficient (R), the root mean square deviation (RMSD),
    and the standard deviation (STD) [48,49]. A simulation’s validity and accuracy
    will increase when it is similar to the observation [50]. 3. Results and Discussion
    This study evaluates the uncertainty of the WinSRFR furrow irrigation model, which
    arises from the uncertain calibration input parameters and affects the outputs.
    3.1. Creating Random Sample Sets Using Monte Carlo Simulation As explained earlier,
    six simulations were performed, including two close-ended and open-ended furrow
    irrigation conditions, and three datasets, including cross section parameters
    (SS and BW), Kostiakov–Lewis infiltration function parameters (k, a, f0), and
    Manning’s roughness coefficient (n). To investigate the effect of these six states
    on WinSRFR furrow irrigation simulation model estimations, the probability distribution
    of each parameter was derived (Table 2), and 1000 datasets were produced. The
    models’ simulations mainly focused on the three plots of the advance front, depth
    hydrograph, and flow hydrograph. The selection of probability distribution function
    for each parameter is important to obtain data samples using the corresponding
    parameter space because it affects the quality of the simulation results [49].
    Hence, in the first step of the framework, the probability distribution of geometry
    cross section, infiltration, and roughness parameters was investigated and applied
    to provide information on the parameters, and furthermore, the simulations. As
    seen from Table 2, all BW, SS, a, f0, and n parameters followed the Wakeby distribution
    with p-values equal to 0.13, 0.13, 0.12, 0.12, and 0.19, respectively. Additionally,
    the results of the K-S test illustrated that the Log-Logistic distribution fitted
    the infiltration parameter of k, which was significant at 𝛼=0.05 . The finding
    results shows that the probability distributions of related irrigation parameters
    are free from Normal and Gaussian distributions that str commonly used in order
    to simplify the procedure [50]. Table 2. Fitting probability distributions of
    parameters values for producing 1000 datasets. 3.2. Simulation Using WinSRFR Furrow
    Irrigation Model and Uncertainty Analysis The coefficients information and corresponding
    probability distributions of Wakeby and Log-Logistic formulations in Table 2 were
    used to produce random values for each parameter. The created datasets were used
    as inputs for running the WinSRFR furrow irrigation model in a step-by-step simulation
    process to solve numerical equations, and then obtain equivalent outputs. This
    operation was repeated 1000 times by applying the geometry cross section, Kostiakov–Lewis
    infiltration function, and Manning’s roughness parameters separately until the
    numerical simulations had completed. Additionally, the simulations were implemented
    using two conditions of close-ended and open-ended furrow irrigation. Based upon
    the 2.5% and 97.5% levels of prediction uncertainty, 95% intervals were calculated
    for the advance front curve, depth hydrograph, and runoff hydrograph, separately.
    Thus, 95PPU was used to determine the percentage of values bracketed by 95 percent
    prediction uncertainty. In Figure 1, Figure 2 and Figure 3, the uncertainty bounds
    are drawn using 2.5% and 97.5% levels. In the next step, the initial uncertainty
    analysis of the WinSRFR furrow irrigation simulations was performed, and p-factor
    and r-factor criteria were calculated (Table 2). Figure 1 shows the uncertainty
    results of the advance front curve for two conditions of close-ended and open-ended
    furrow irrigation. Figure 1 indicates that the WinSRFR model had high uncertainty
    levels for predicting advance fronts using the furrow geometry cross section in
    both conditions. The 95PPU bounds of the close-ended (SS, BW) furrow were found
    to be outside of almost all the observation values. Based on Table 3, only 12.5%
    and 50% of the observation data for the front curve were bracketed by the 95PPU
    uncertainty bound in close-ended and open-ended conditions, respectively. These
    results indicate a high level of model uncertainty for predicting the front curve
    using geometry cross section parameters. This is due to considering only geometry
    cross section parameters, while other infiltration, roughness, soil hydraulic
    properties, and initial and boundary conditions are effective for accurately prediction
    the advance front using practical irrigation models such as WinSRFR. Figure 1.
    The uncertainty bounds of advance front curve for different furrow irrigation
    conditions and parameters. Figure 2. The uncertainty bounds of flow depth hydrograph
    for different furrow irrigation conditions and parameters. Figure 3. The uncertainty
    bounds of runoff hydrograph for open-ended furrow irrigation conditions and different
    parameters. Table 3. Uncertainty evaluation using p and r criteria before removing
    non-behavioral data. According to the p-factor values and 95PPU bounds, better
    advance estimations were obtained by applying infiltration and roughness parameters.
    As presented, the 95% confidence interval of the close-ended (k, a, f0), open-ended
    (k, a, f0), close-ended (n), and open-ended (n) ones covers 100%, 87.5%, 87.5%,
    and 87.5% of the front curve observation data, respectively. Among the infiltration
    and roughness parameters, the finding results related to the r-factor value demonstrate
    the superiority of the model based on the Manning’s parameter, especially for
    the close-ended condition. The calculated r-factor values for the close-ended
    (n) one are 44%, 69%, and 15% lower than the close-ended (k, a, f0), open-ended
    (k, a, f0), and open-ended (n) ones, respectively. Although infiltration and roughness
    models create more accurate results than geometry cross section parameters do
    in estimating front curve, their use still has high instability and uncertainty.
    The WinSRFR irrigation model uses empirical relationships between the Kostiakov–Lewis
    and Manning’s functions for representing infiltration and flow processes. Even
    if physical-based infiltration models can be applied, their practical applications
    remain limited. It is partly due to problems in coupling infiltration calculations
    to surface flow models and the difficulty in considering soil hydraulic properties,
    geometric properties, and other effective parameters [51]. Similar to the uncertainty
    results of the front curve, WinSRFR has high instability and uncertainty when
    it is used to estimate the flow depth hydrograph based on the geometry cross section
    properties of the furrow (Figure 2). Although the results of the p-factor show
    that all the observation flow depth data are covered by the 95PPU bound, the uncertainty
    bounds are wide, indicating the low accuracy of estimations [52]. However, the
    estimation ranges of flow depth hydrograph for close-ended (SS, BW) and open-ended
    (SS, BW) ones were wide. These bounds did not contain the measured values and
    produced large uncertainties. When the geometry cross section parameters were
    used for simulating the runoff hydrograph (Figure 3), the uncertainty bound covered
    a relatively narrow scope in comparison with that of the Kostiakov–Lewis and Manning’s
    parameters. In the case of geometry cross section parameters of the furrow irrigation
    system, the estimation range of WinSRFR did not match that of the observations.
    For estimation limits of runoff hydrograph using (k, a, f0) and (n) parameters,
    most of the observations fell within the confidence intervals of 2.5% and 97.5%.
    A few observations were higher than those corresponding to the 95PPU limit produced
    by Manning’s parameter. There is a wide range of estimations in response to the
    geometry cross section, infiltration, and roughness parameters. This result demonstrates
    uncertainties in the Kostiakov–Lewis and Manning equations. In addition, the uncertainties
    may also lead to severe fluctuations in the estimation results, as well as the
    large variations in the hydrographs patterns in some cases. Therefore, the WinSRFR
    furrow irrigation model shows some limitations in estimating the advance front
    curve, flow depth hydrograph, and runoff hydrograph. Cahoon [53] showed that parameters
    of the Kostiakov–Lewis infiltration function have a strong influence on the advance
    front curve and flow hydrograph, which is in agreement with the findings of the
    current study. The results of the current study are in agreement with those stated
    by Gillies and Smith [54], which reported that soil infiltration parameters of
    the modified Kostiakov equation are more sensitive to runoff hydrograph than the
    advance front curve is, indicating the need for the precise measurement of field
    data. Khoi and Tom [55] presented that the uncertainty of the predicted flow hydrograph
    using the SWAT model is high, and the model is sensitive to parameters values.
    3.3. Effect of Likelihood Measures on Uncertainty In this section, it is shown
    how applying likelihood measures affects the uncertainty assessment. Three likelihood
    measures of NSE, R2, and PBIAS are used to investigate their effects on the uncertainty
    results in WinSRFR furrow irrigation modeling. The percentage of behavioral likelihood,
    which are derived via GLUE, are given in Table 4. Based on the posterior distribution
    of geometry cross section parameters, 1000 simulations were made by WinSRFR furrow
    irrigation modeling. All the simulations were behavioral for estimating the front
    curve based on the geometry cross section properties in both the open-ended and
    close-ended conditions (NSE > 0.5, −0.25 < PBIAS < 0.25, R2 > 0.6). The posterior
    and prior cumulative distributions of the advance front derived using different
    criteria for T = 134 min at a distance of 168.6 cm in the close-ended furrow irrigation
    condition are shown in Figure 4. In simulations of furrow irrigation, the difference
    between the prior and posterior distributions demonstrated that the model was
    most sensitive to infiltration parameters for front curves. As seen in Figure
    4, the difference is greater for the PBIAS criterion. The dotted points in Figure
    4 show the distributions of behavioral data for each parameter, whose likelihood
    measures NSE > 0.5, −0.25 < PBIAS < 0.25, and R2 > 0.6. For the close-ended furrow
    irrigation condition, the kurtosis in the distribution of the simulation by using
    roughness parameter and NSE and PBIAS criteria show that this parameter has major
    effects on advance front curve modeling. Additionally, among the infiltration
    simulations and dotted plot distribution, the kurtosis of behavioral sets by applying
    NSE and PBIAS criteria is a more obvious than the other R2 is. Hence, it seems
    the PBIAS and NSE criteria can provide a more efficient way of modeling the front
    curve based on roughness and infiltration parameters. The acceptable percentages
    were 96.61% for the close-ended one (n)-NSE; 86.64% for close-ended one (n)-PBIAS;
    56.35% for close-ended one (k, a, f0)-NSE; and 21.54% for close-ended one (k,
    a, f0)-PBIAS. Similar results were obtained for the open-ended furrow irrigation
    condition by applying WinSRFR modeling (Figure 5 and Table 4). Based on Figure
    6 and Table 4 and considering the kurtosis of behavioral data, using the roughness
    parameter and NSE criterion can produce a relatively stable flow depth hydrograph
    estimation for close-ended furrow irrigation condition. The estimations based
    on the geometry cross section and infiltration properties by applying the NSE
    criterion were ranked in second place and can be used after roughness-NSE. Additionally,
    for the open-ended furrow irrigation condition, the kurtosis distribution of behavioral
    data displays the role of infiltration (NSE and PBIAS) parameters and geometry
    cross section (NSE) properties on the estimation stability of WinSRFR (Figure
    7). The results of behavioral data dispersion on the posterior distribution line
    of runoff hydrograph show the effect of the Manning equation on WinSRFR estimation,
    especially after applying the NSE likelihood function (Figure 8). Figure 4. Posterior
    (red line) and prior (black line) cumulative distributions of the advance front
    model from close-ended irrigation conditions. Figure 5. Posterior (red line) and
    prior (black line) cumulative distributions of the advance front model from open-ended
    irrigation conditions. Figure 6. Posterior (red line) and prior (black line) cumulative

    of the flow depth hydrograph model from open-ended irrigation conditions. Figure
    8. Posterior (red line) and prior (black line) cumulative distributions of the
    runoff hydrograph model from open-ended irrigation conditions. Table 4. Percentage
    of behavioral likelihood derived from the likelihood functions. It is apparent
    from the results in Table 4 that many simulations fell within the high likelihood
    value region (NSE > 0.5). This indicates a complex correlation between the evaluated
    parameters and the advance front curve output of the WinSRFR model, which can
    reflect the uncertainty of the model parameters. This result is in agreement with
    that reported in [9]. Additionally, as seen from Figure 6 to Figure 8, the likelihood
    measures do not have a regular form for estimating the flow depth and runoff hydrographs.
    On the other hand, the choices of appropriate likelihood function and simulation
    criteria are inherently subjective [9]. It is evident that different likelihood
    functions highlight the role of certain geometry cross section (SS, BW), infiltration
    (k, a, f0), and roughness (n) parameters and affect the model’s output uncertainty.
    Hence, the question is what criterion is useful to investigate the uncertainty
    of the WinSRFR model for estimating advance front curves and depth and runoff
    hydrographs. To answer this question, the Taylor diagram and 95PPU bounds were
    drawn after applying likelihood functions for removing non-behavioral data. The
    percentage of covered observation, the width of uncertainty bounds, and statistical
    characteristics were evaluated. 3.4. Analysis of Accuracy and Uncertainty Associated
    with Different Parameters In order to achieve precise uncertainty analysis results
    and a better selection of geometry cross section, infiltration, and roughness
    parameters, the Taylor diagrams were plotted. This diagram provides a visual of
    the models’ estimation accuracy based on the three criteria: NSE > 0.5, R2 > 0.6,
    and −0.25 < PBIAS < 0.25. For this aim, those estimations that satisfied the NSE,
    PBIAS, and R2 criteria were selected, and the uncertainty and statistical analyses
    were performed again. The results of the Taylor diagram for WinSRFR advance front
    estimations in the close-ended furrow irrigation condition are shown in Figure
    9. Since all the estimations using geometry cross section parameters based on
    NSE, PBIAS, and R2 functions were classified as behavioral data, one Taylor diagram
    was plotted. The estimations were located between R lines of 0.99 and 1, STD lines
    of 42.39 and 51.44, and RMSD lines of 1.80 and 6.29 for the advance front curve
    of close-ended condition (SS, BW). For the estimation of advance front curve using
    infiltration parameters, the estimations were located between R lines of 0.96
    and 1, STD lines of 23.47 and 59.82, and RMSD lines of 0.96 and 25.16 for the
    NSE function; between R lines of 0.96 and 1, STD lines of 32.49 and 59.82, and
    RMSD lines of 0.96 and 16.50 for the PBIAS function; between R lines of 0.96 and
    1, STD lines of 15.99 and 59.82, and RMSD lines of 0.96 and 32.47 for the R2 function.
    Additionally, for estimation of the advance front curve using the roughness parameter
    of Manning equation, the estimations were located between R lines of 0.99 and
    1, STD lines of 35.56 and 67.52, and RMSD lines of 1.68 and 19.37 for the NSE
    function; between R lines of 0.99 and 1, STD lines of 38.77 and 60.74, and RMSD
    lines of 1.68 and 12.44 for the PBIAS function; between R lines of 0.99 and 1,
    STD lines of 35.56 and 67.52, and RMSD lines of 1.68 and 19.37 for the R2 function.
    It is obvious that all estimations in terms of R exhibit high accuracy in predicting
    advance front curve in the close-ended condition. Taylor diagrams show that (SS,
    BW), (k, a, f0)-PBIAS, and (n)-PBIAS have high accuracy in recognizing the complex
    relationships between the input parameters and advance front curve. For a better
    selection of robust parameters, the values of p-factor and r-factor are given
    in Table 5. The results show that (k, a, f0)-PBIAS and (n)-PBIAS can cover 87.5%
    and 87.5% of the observation data, and the widths of the uncertainty bound are
    0.51 and 0.40, respectively. By removing non-behavioral data (PBIAS > 0.25 and
    PBIAS < −0.25), the estimations of (n)-PBIAS reduced the r-factor value from 0.64
    to 0.4, while the p-factor was constant (87.5%). The results suggest that if proper
    soil infiltration parameters are selected and accurate measurements are taken,
    it is possible to reduce the simulation uncertainty of advance front curves. Therefore,
    to minimize the simulations uncertainty of the WinSRFR furrow irrigation model,
    it is important to select appropriate parameters prior to modeling advance front
    curves. Nie et al. [56] demonstrated that the sensitivity of the advance front
    curve in the WinSRFR model to soil infiltration parameters is very high. They
    presented that those simulations results were strongly affected when these parameters
    were changed. Khorami and Ghahraman [57] solved the Richard equation numerically
    to simulate soil moisture distribution and soil water infiltration. They reported
    that the model’s simulation uncertainties are relatively high in terms of moisture
    and infiltration parameters. Figure 9. The Taylor diagrams of WinSRFR advance
    front outputs for close-ended furrow irrigation condition after removing non-behavioral
    data. Table 5. Uncertainty evaluation using p and r criteria after removing non-behavioral
    data. Similar results were obtained for estimating the advance front curve in
    the open-ended condition. Based on Taylor diagrams (Figure 10), the simulations
    were grouped into 0.99 and 1 R lines, 53.41 and 61.41 STD lines, 6.85 and 12.87
    RMSD lines for (SS, BW); into 0.91 and 1 R lines, 25.22 and 78.29 STD lines, and
    1.17 and 31.28 RMSD lines for (k, a, f0)-NSE; into 0.91 and 1 R lines, 34.90 and
    76.30 STD lines, and 1.17 and 31.28 RMSD lines for (k, a, f0)-PBIAS; into 0.91
    and 1 R lines, 15.19 and 109.54 STD lines, and 1.17 and 59.85 RMSD lines for (k,
    a, f0)-R2; into 0.98 and 1 R lines, 46.69 and 74.95 STD lines, and 7.65 and 25.38
    RMSD lines for (n)-NSE; into 0.98 and 1 R lines, 46.69 and 65.60 STD lines, and
    7.65 and 16.46 RMSD lines for (n)-PBIAS; into the 0.98 and 1 R lines, 46.69 and
    103.37 STD lines, and 7.65 and 53.65 RMSD lines for (n)-R2. It seems that (SS,
    BW), (k, a, f0)-NSE and (n)-PBIAS produced more accurate simulations than the
    others did. However, from Table 5, the estimated advance front curve using geometry
    cross section properties covers only 50% of observations, while the p-factor is
    87.5% for soil infiltration and roughness parameters. The r-factor of estimations
    after removing non-behavioral data show that the uncertainty width of (k, a, f0)-NSE
    and (n)-PBIAS reduced from 2.07 to 0.88 and from 0.75 to 0.39, respectively. These
    results represent that applying the PBIAS function for the roughness parameter
    of the Manning equation could efficiently reduce uncertain and unstable estimations
    of the open-ended advance front curve. These uncertainty results indicate an interaction
    between the accurate measurement of parameters and the output of the WinSRFR model.
    Nie et al. [58] represented that the performance of the WinSRFR model to simulate
    water advance and recession trajectories processes are affected by variations
    in soil infiltration. Moravejalahkamis [59] reported that using a constant value
    for Manning’s roughness coefficient, soil infiltration properties, field dimensions,
    inflow rates, and cut-off times in furrow irrigation systems can led to significant
    errors in advanced recession trajectories assessment. Additionally, several studies
    suggested that irrigation performance can be improved by considering the soil
    spatial–temporal variability in soil infiltration and Manning’s roughness parameters
    [24,31,60]. This statement is in agreement with the results of the current study
    for the accurate measurement of soil infiltration and Manning’s roughness parameters
    to achieve the high performance and low uncertainty of the WinSRFR model for simulating
    the advance front curve. Figure 10. Taylor diagrams of WinSRFR advance front outputs
    for open-ended condition furrow irrigation after applying behavioral data. Figure
    11 shows the uncertainty bounds of advance front curve for close-ended and open-ended
    furrow irrigation conditions after removing non-behavioral data. Figure 11. The
    uncertainty bounds of advance front curve for different furrow irrigation conditions
    after removing non-behavioral data. The results of Taylor diagrams for estimation
    flow depth hydrograph in the close-ended furrow irrigation condition are given
    in Figure 12. From the results of Figure 12, the estimations related to geometry
    cross section properties are placed between R lines of 0.89 and 0.93, STD lines
    of 12.78 and 14.81, and RMSD lines of 5.92 and 6.90 after applying the NSE > 0.5
    function. The function of −0.25 < PBIAS < 0.25 resulted in 0.89 < R < 0.93, 12.69
    < STD < 12.64, and 5.92 < RMSD < 6.95. Additionally, the eliminating non-behavioral
    data using R2 > 0.6 resulted in 0.89 < R < 0.94, 12.69 < STD < 27.40, and 5.89
    < RMSD < 14.09. The simulation of the flow depth hydrograph using infiltration
    parameters of (k, a, f0) resulted in 0.76 < R < 0.99, 10.76 < STD < 22.99, and
    2.59 < RMSD < 10.50 for the NSE likelihood function; 0.40 < R < 0.99, 8.56 < STD
    < 32.84, and 2.59 < RMSD < 22.14 for the PBIAS likelihood function; 0.78 < R <
    0.99, 8.56 < STD < 35.22, and 2.59 < RMSD < 24.90 for the R2 likelihood function.
    By simulating the flow depth hydrograph using the roughness parameter of Manning
    equation, the minimum and maximum values of R were calculated to be equal to 0.78
    and 0.96 for NSE, 0.7 and 0.97 for PBIAS, and 0.78 and 0.97 for R2 likelihood
    functions, respectively. STD values were changed in the ranges of 10.56–19.10,
    7.64–23.37, and 10.35–60.03 for NSE, PBIAS, and R2 likelihood functions, respectively.
    The RMSD values were changed in the ranges of 6.02–9.68, 6.02–11.34, and 6.02–47.49
    for NSE, PBIAS, and R2 likelihood functions, respectively. Based on statistical
    characteristics, the simulation of flow depth hydrograph using (SS, BW)-NSE, (k,
    a, f0)-NSE, and (n)-NSE in the condition of close-ended furrow irrigation are
    more accurate than the others are. Consequently, from the results shown in Table
    4, among three estimations, (k, a, f0)-NSE resulted in the lowest value of 95PPU
    and highest value of r-factor, which are equal to 62.5% and 1.06, respectively.
    Additionally, based on the results in Table 3, it can be concluded that when measurements
    are dispersed and involve errors, estimations of the flow depth hydrograph using
    (n)-NSE may reduce uncertainties. The remained behavioral data using NSE > 0.5
    for geometry cross section parameters was 4.76%, which shows the instability of
    SS and BW data due to the measurement errors. Figure 12. Taylor diagrams of WinSRFR
    flow depth hydrograph outputs in the close-ended condition furrow irrigation after
    applying behavioral data. Taylor diagram and uncertainty bound results obtained
    for WinSRFR flow depth hydrograph simulations in the open-ended furrow irrigation
    condition are shown in Figure 13 and Figure 14. The analysis of obtained statistical
    values demonstrated that (SS, BW)-NSE, (k, a, f0)-NSE, and (n)-NSE had more accurate
    simulations. The estimations were grouped into R lines of 0.88 and 0.94, STD lines
    of 15.60 and 19.34, and RMSD lines of 6.66 and 9.21 for (SS, BW)-NSE; into R lines
    of 0.74 and 0.99, STD lines of 14.33 and 28.82, and RMSD lines of 3.76 and 13.03
    for (k, a, f0)-NSE; into R lines of 0.71 and 0.94, STD lines of 14.17 and 20.54,
    and RMSD lines of 6.88 and 13.33 for (n)-NSE. Although the 95PPU of (SS, BW)-NSE
    was 77.8%, which is more than the value related to (n)-NSE, which is equal to
    52.78% (Table 5), from the results of Table 4, only 6.58% of the simulations were
    recognized as behavioral ones. (k, a, f0)-NSE resulted in the highest 95PPU value,
    and 94.45% of the simulated data were bracketed by the 95% estimation uncertainty.
    In both the open-ended and close-ended conditions, the width of the uncertainty
    bound reduced significantly (Figure 14, Table 3 and Table 5). Figure 13. Taylor
    diagrams of WinSRFR flow depth hydrograph outputs in the open-ended condition
    furrow irrigation after applying behavioral data. Figure 14. The uncertainty bounds
    of flow depth hydrograph for different furrow irrigation conditions after removing
    non-behavioral data. Similar results were obtained for simulating the runoff hydrograph,
    where (k, a, f0)-NSE and (n)-NSE showed better performances than the other estimations
    did. Based on the Taylor diagram given in Figure 15, the statistical results of
    (k, a, f0)-NSE were calculated as 0.83 < R < 0.89, 0.08 < STD < 0.12, and 0.05
    < RMSD < 0.07. The results of 0.88 < R < 0.92, 0.141 < STD < 0.148, and 0.06 <
    RMSD < 0.07 were obtained for (n)-NSE. When considering the percentage of remained
    behavioral data (Table 4), it can be seen more than 92% of data were eliminated
    due to NSE < 0.6. Therefore, re-evaluating the results shows that (n)-PBIAS and
    (n)-R2 reduced the simulating uncertainty of runoff hydrograph while maintaining
    the 98.56% and 47.58% of the data, respectively. The statistical results of (n)-PBIAS
    were exhibited to be 0.23 < R < 0.92, 0.06 < STD < 0.16, and 0.138 < RMSD < 0.158.
    Those results were calculated as 0.77 < R < 0.92, 0.06 < STD < 0.1, and 0.138
    < RMSD < 0.153 for (n)-R2. Using (n)-PBIAS, 91.18% of observation fell inside
    the estimated runoff hydrograph. This percentage reduced to 70.59% when (n)-R2
    was used. The width of uncertainty bound reduced by applying likelihood criteria
    of −0.25 < PBIAS < 0.25 and R2 > 0.6 (Figure 16). Regarding Figure 16 and Table
    5, the majority of runoff hydrograph observations were bracketed in the estimated
    bound by using the PBAIS function. It seems the PBAIS function is able to represent
    the changes in runoff over time. Some observation points of runoff were beyond
    the 95PPU estimated by the R2 function. Thus, R2 was recognized as a modest likelihood
    function for the runoff hydrograph. Figure 15. Taylor diagrams of WinSRFR runoff
    hydrograph outputs for open-ended condition furrow irrigation after applying behavioral
    data. Figure 16. The uncertainty bounds of runoff hydrograph for different furrow
    irrigation conditions after removing non-behavioral data. The uncertainty analysis
    of the WinSRFR model illustrated that the width of the uncertainty bound is commonly
    affected by the data availability before and after filtering using likelihood
    functions. This result is in agreement with those presented in [61]. Therefore,
    the behavior of a furrow irrigation system cannot be accurately predicted by the
    WinSRFR model because of deficiencies in assumptions of the model, errors in the
    observed data, monitoring data, model parameters, and the model’s structure error.
    Large epistemic uncertainties of the WinSRFR simulations can be reduced by minimizing
    the systematic errors of furrow irrigation measurements, improving the measurement
    techniques, using more accurate instruments, reducing the inputs errors of the
    model, and also, considering the model structural error due to the model’s simplification
    assumptions [62]. In addition, in several previous studies, the WinSRFR model
    calibrated simulations obtained using optimum parametric sets. While using the
    GLUE framework, a range of model inputs are transformed into reliable simulations
    [63]. Through GLUE, a range of model inputs is obtained by identifying the posterior
    distribution of parameters, and the estimation uncertainty of model outputs is
    calculated with corresponding confidence intervals [9]. As a result, more attention
    should be paid to obtaining precise measurements from field experiments for reducing
    the model’s uncertainty. The results obtained from this study and proposed framework
    are highly applicable for updating prior knowledge about the reliability of WinSRFR
    furrow irrigation model outputs. 4. Conclusions In this study, geometry cross
    section (SS, BW), Kostiakov–Lewis infiltration (k, a, f0), and Manning’s roughness
    (n) parameters in different conditions of furrow irrigation system (close end
    and open end) were evaluated to analyze the impacts of them on the WinSRFR model
    outputs. The GLUE analysis was performed by considering three likelihood functions
    of NSE > 0.5, −0.25 < PBAIS < 0.25, and R2 > 0.6 to assess the uncertainty degree
    of the model outputs response to the input parameters, including advance front
    curve, flow depth hydrograph, and runoff hydrograph. The following conclusions
    were drawn from the results: - The initial evaluation without filtering non-behavioral
    estimations showed that the model outputs have high uncertainties in regard to
    the input parameter of geometry cross section. The value width range of uncertainty
    bound could be reduced by employing Kostiakov–Lewis infiltration and Manning’s
    roughness parameters. - Likelihood measures greatly affect the uncertainty bounds,
    especially with respect to the Kostiakov–Lewis infiltration and Manning’s roughness
    parameters. The confidence interval and uncertainty bound of the advance front
    curve and runoff hydrograph did not change in response to employing likelihood
    functions for geometry cross section parameters. - There is a higher level of
    instability in the model outputs related to soil infiltration parameters than
    those related to the roughness coefficient. This result is related to the higher
    level of sensitivity of the WinSRFR model in inaccurate measurements, methods,
    and equipment to monitor the soil infiltration than that which is considering
    for the optimum roughness coefficient. - The PBIAS likelihood function played
    a critical role in the uncertainty results for the estimated advance front curve
    and runoff hydrograph. In contrast, the NSE likelihood function was more important
    to implicitly determine the flow depth hydrograph estimation uncertainty. These
    functions reduced the uncertainty of model outputs by avoiding the parameter sets
    that produced outputs there were very different from the observations. According
    to the current study, it was apparent that likelihood functions affect the model
    outputs. In addition, this study has limitations, including: (1) considering constant
    threshold values for likelihood functions of NSE, R2, and PBIAS, (2) evaluating
    limited input parameters, and (3) investigating one source of model uncertainty,
    which indicate a need for further research. Thus, finding a robust likelihood
    function with different threshold values is critical because it strongly influences
    the width of the uncertainty bounds. Additionally, the influence of the length
    of furrow, inflow, cut-off time, etc., on the model output uncertainty is unknown
    when one is applying GLUE for WinSRFR-based furrow irrigation applications. Then,
    future research can consider other epistemic uncertainties such as model structure
    and more input parameters. This work can also be replicated by implementing different
    confidence intervals instead of 2.5% and 97.5%. This study provides a conscious
    understanding of the correlation between the factors affecting furrow irrigation
    performance. The methodology of this study can be used for complementary studies
    on the accuracy evaluation of different models of furrow irrigation system simulation.
    Then, engineers can make more realistic decisions under uncertainty based on the
    confidence interval bound, which can help to avoid decisions based on incomplete
    value of models’ prediction. Author Contributions A.S.: Conceptualization, Formal

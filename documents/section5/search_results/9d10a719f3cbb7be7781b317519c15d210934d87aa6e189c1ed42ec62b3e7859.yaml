    Figures References Citations Keywords Metrics Abstract: Agriculture plays a vital
    role in the economic growth of any country. With the increase of population, frequent
    changes in climatic conditions and limited resources, it becomes a challenging
    task to fulfil the food requirement of the present population. Precision agriculture
    also known as smart farming have emerged as an innovative tool to address current
    challenges in agricultural sustainability. The mechanism that drives this cutting
    edge technology is machine learning (ML). It gives the machine ability to learn
    without being explicitly programmed. ML together with IoT (Internet of Things)
    enabled farm machinery are key components of the next agriculture revolution.
    In this article, authors present a systematic review of ML applications in the
    field of agriculture. The areas that are focused are prediction of soil parameters
    such as organic carbon and moisture content, crop yield prediction, disease and
    weed detection in crops and species detection. ML with computer vision are reviewed
    for the classification of a different set of crop images in order to monitor the
    crop quality and yield assessment. This approach can be integrated for enhanced
    livestock production by predicting fertility patterns, diagnosing eating disorders,
    cattle behaviour based on ML models using data collected by collar sensors, etc.
    Intelligent irrigation which includes drip irrigation and intelligent harvesting
    techniques are also reviewed that reduces human labour to a great extent. This
    article demonstrates how knowledge-based agriculture can improve the sustainable
    productivity and quality of the product. A graphical abstract for Machine Learning

    I. Introduction The population of the world will increase to 9.1 billion approximately
    thirty-four percent as of today by the end of 2050. Food requirement will increase
    by 70 percent and due to rapid urbanization, land availability for agriculture
    will decrease drastically in the coming years. India will be the most populated
    country by 2050 and presently it is already lagging the domestic food production.
    The main reason for reduced food production is the lack of planning, unpredictable
    weather conditions, improper harvesting and irrigation techniques and livestock
    mismanagement. In the last few years, nature has experienced a drastic change
    in weather conditions due to global warming. The average temperature of the earth
    has been increased due to which there is uncertainty in climatic conditions. Frequent
    droughts, heavy rainfall are the biggest challenge for poor farmers. According
    to the government of India annual economic survey, adverse climatic conditions,
    reduce the farmer’s income by 20-25%. Precision agriculture [1], [2] is one of
    the solutions to ensure food security for the entire world [3]. Precision agriculture
    also abbreviated as digital agriculture is a technology-enabled data-driven sustainable
    farm management system. It is basically the adoption of modern information technologies,
    software tools, and smart embedded devices for decision support in agriculture
    [4] as shown in figure 1. Mechanized agriculture and the green revolution are
    the two key components of the first and second agriculture revolution. Precision
    farming is an important part of the third agriculture revolution [5]. FIGURE 1.
    Precision agriculture. Show All John Deere introduced this technology in 1990
    for the sowing of seeds and spraying of fertilizers using global positioning system
    (GPS) controlled tractors. The main focus of precision farming is to reduce the
    production cost and environmental effects to increase the farm’s profitability.
    Digital technologies such as IoT [6], AI, data analytics, cloud computing, and
    block-chain technology play a key role in precision agriculture. In precision
    farming, IoT based smart sensors are deployed in the agriculture land for collecting
    data related to soil nutrients, fertilizers, and water requirements as well as
    for analysing the crop growth. Autonomous and semi-autonomous devices such as
    an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) [7] and robots are used for identifying weed
    and disease in the plants using computer vision techniques. Satellite images are
    also used in precision agriculture for monitoring the field and identifying the
    diseases in the plants. The data obtained from the deployed sensors [8] are processed
    and analyzed using ML algorithms to make farming practice more controlled and
    optimized. ML algorithms are also used for weather and rainfall prediction based
    on the data obtained from sensors, climatic records, and satellite images. This
    could save the lives of thousands of farmers who commit suicide because of crop
    loss due to uncertainty in weather conditions. Smart livestock management is an
    important component of precision agriculture. It helps in monitoring the health,
    welfare, productivity, and reproduction of animals throughout their life cycle.
    Sensors and cameras monitor animal’s health and computer vision techniques help
    in making intelligent decisions such as stopping the communal spread of diseases.
    Autonomous tractors and automated irrigation systems provide modern farming solutions
    to farmers. The widespread utilization of precision farming across the world is
    due to the presence of innovative machine and deep learning (DL) algorithms, high-speed
    internet access, and efficient computational devices. In [10] authors have discussed
    applications of ML for sustainable agriculture supply chain (ASC) performance.
    Authors have presented a unique ML-ASC framework that can guide researchers and
    agriculture practitioners to understand the role and importance of digital technologies
    in the agriculture industry. In [11] authors reviewed different ML applications
    in agriculture and discussed how digital technologies will benefit the agriculture
    industry. In this paper, the authors have presented a comprehensive review of
    the ML application for precision agriculture. This review article will provide
    an insight into the research community about the adoption of digital practices
    in the agriculture management system. It is anticipated that government agencies
    will frame policies to promote precision farming across the world. The main contribution
    of the article is outlined as follows: Applications of artificial intelligence
    and IoT in precision agriculture are discussed along with their practical implications.
    Foundation of ML and DL algorithms which find their application in precision agriculture
    has been discussed. Performance comparison for various ML, DL algorithms in precision
    farming has been carried out based on the state-of-art literature. Assessment

    of sensors used in IoT applications in precision agriculture is presented. Integration
    of wireless sensor network (WSN) with IoT and artificial intelligence in precision
    agriculture is discussed. Challenges and future trends of artificial intelligence
    in precision farming are briefly outlined. Table 1 highlights the major differences
    of this review article with other articles published in this field. The paper

    the paper. TABLE 1 Key Differences of the Article With Published Articles SECTION
    II. Impact of Artificial Intelligence and IoT in Agriculture The term AI was first
    coined in the Dartmouth conference in the year 1956 by John McCarthy and he defined
    it as a science and engineering of making intelligent machines or more specifically
    intelligent computer programs. AI technology provides computational intelligence
    to machines so that they can learn, understand and react according to the situation.
    ML, DL, natural language processing (NLP), swarm intelligence (SI), expert systems,
    fuzzy logic, and computer vision are the subfields of AI as shown in figure 2.
    This field finds endless applications across different sectors of human life.
    Intelligent AI programs are widely explored in health-care, agriculture, finance,
    robotics, e-commerce and the automation industry. Samsung, Apple, and other electronics
    giant companies announced that they will be utilizing this technology in every
    device they will manufacture in the near future. IoT is another emerging technology
    in which smart sensors, devices are interconnected through the internet. These
    smart sensors can be utilized to gather data across different disciplines such
    as solar plants, agriculture fields, disaster-prone areas, manufacturing industry
    for efficient resource utilization. With the increase in population over the year’s
    demand for agriculture products is increasing day by day. However, with limited
    land availability for farming and reduce interest among the young generation to
    adopt farming as their profession, it has become a challenging task for the agriculture
    industry to satisfy the food requirement of millions of people. Now, the agriculture
    industry is widely adopting smart technologies like IoT and AI to efficiently
    cultivate organic products in limited land areas as well as to overcome the traditional
    challenges of farmers. FIGURE 2. Artificial intelligence techniques. Show All
    IoT based smart farming system is built for monitoring soil nutrients and soil
    moisture using sensors. ML algorithms are explored for determining the optimum
    amount of fertilizers required for soils before the sowing of crops. Drones are
    revolutionizing the agriculture industry. These drones are cameras enabled and
    are used for different applications such as field and crop monitoring, spraying
    of pesticides, and drip irrigation. The images captured by the drones over the
    entire lifecycle of crops can be examined using DL and computer vision algorithms
    for disease and weed identification. Thereafter, these drones are used for spraying
    pesticides over the weeds and infected crops. Over the years uncertainty in weather
    conditions is the main concern of farmers. Drip irrigation using drones is an
    efficient AI-empowered irrigation system which is basically trained on weather
    pattern and can effectively reduce the water problems of farmers. AI-enabled robots
    can be used for harvesting the crops at a much faster pace and in large volumes.
    Robots can reduce human labour to a large extent and can be used along with drones
    for monitoring the field. Livestock management is another major concern for farmers.
    IoT based sensors can be deployed in the field for health monitoring of cattle.
    This information can be utilized for protecting the bunch of cattle from diseased
    cattle. NLP based virtual assistant applications like chatbots can update the
    farmers with the latest advancement in technologies for agriculture. Farmers can
    finds solutions for their problems and incorporate the latest technology in their
    farming for improving their field productivity. Thus, AI and IoT are the two major
    technologies that will play a vital role in the agriculture industry. SECTION
    III. Machine Learning Algorithms ML is the subfield of computer science that gives
    computers the ability to learn without being explicitly programmed. (Arthur Samuel,
    1959) [12]. Alan Turing in the year 1950 proposed the concept of learning machines
    and wrote a research article “The Turing Test for Machine Intelligence” [13].
    He performed a test and examined the machine’s ability to demonstrate intelligent
    behaviour similar to humans. A machine or intelligent computer program learns
    and extract knowledge from the data, builds a framework for making predictions
    or intelligent decisions. Thus, the ML process is divided into three key parts,
    i.e. data input, model building, and generalization as shown in figure 3. Generalization
    is the process for predicting the output for the inputs with which the algorithm
    has not been trained before. ML algorithms are mainly used to solve complex problems
    where human expertise fails such as weather prediction, spam filtering, disease
    identification in plants, pattern recognition. FIGURE 3. A Machine learning process.
    Show All Today, due to the availability of innovative algorithms and large data
    sets through internet resources industries and research communities are widely
    using ML algorithms for solving a diverse set of problems. DL is the subfield
    of the family of ML algorithms which is trained from large sets and uses an artificial
    neural network (ANN) to make intelligent decisions. ML algorithms are categorized
    as supervised learning, unsupervised learning, and reinforcement learning as shown
    in figure 4. Supervised learning as the name suggests is learning with the supervisor
    or teacher. This set of algorithms works with labeled data-set which means corresponding
    to each input there are outputs. The algorithm builds an input-output relationship
    with this labeled data set and thereafter generalize or predicts outputs for unseen
    inputs. Supervised learning algorithms used for predicting the categorical value
    are known as classification algorithms and the algorithms that are used for predicting
    the numerical value are known as regression algorithms. Unsupervised learning
    algorithms works with unlabelled data and discovers unknown objects by grouping
    similar objects. The goal of an unsupervised learning algorithm is to extract
    hidden knowledge from the training data set thus this approach is difficult to
    implement than supervised learning algorithms. Reinforcement learning is another
    approach that learns from the environment through reward and punishment. AlphaGo,
    a chess-playing game developed by DeepMind utilized reinforcement learning for
    defeating the world’s best chess-playing computer program. FIGURE 4. Categorization
    of machine learning algorithms. Show All In this paper the performance of different
    ML algorithms are analysed and discussed in the field of agriculture. Table 2
    presents different types of supervised, unsupervised and reinforcement learning
    algorithms utilized for soil and weather prediction, disease and weed identification,
    intelligent irrigation and harvesting techniques as well as livestock management.
    TABLE 2 Machine Learning Algorithms SECTION IV. Machine Learning Applications
    in Precision Agriculture In many countries, the farmers rely on the traditional
    ways of farming which is based on the reliability of the suggestions from the
    elderly and their experience. This method leaves farmers at the mercy of random
    climatic conditions which are already getting random due to global warming and
    uneven rainfall patterns. The manual spraying method for pesticides led to improper
    usage of resources and harms the environment. AI and IoT enabled precision agriculture
    removes the randomness and assist new age farmer to optimize every step of the
    farming process. Figure 5 (a) and (b) presents a pictorial view of traditional
    agriculture and technology enabled farm management system. FIGURE 5. (a) Traditional
    agriculture cycle (b) Precision agriculture cycle. Show All Gaitán [14] provided
    a systematic study of the impact of extreme weather events, such as hail events,
    cold waves, heat waves, and their impact on agricultural practices. The author
    reported floods, droughts, frost, hail, heatwaves, and pest outbreaks are impacted
    by climatic conditions. The AI systems are applicable in each farming operation
    as depicted in figure 4 and some of them even extend beyond the conventionally
    recognized steps. In this section we will discuss the state of art techniques
    proposed/implemented by various researchers and practitioners worldwide. A. Soil
    Properties and Weather Prediction Prediction of soil properties is the first and
    the most crucial step which influences the selection of crop, land preparation,
    selection of seed, crop yield, and selection of fertilizers /manure. The soil
    properties are directly related to the geographic and climatic conditions of the
    land in use and hence is an important factor to take into consideration. The soil
    properties prediction mostly consists of predicting nutrients in the soil, soil
    surface humidity, weather conditions during the lifecycle of the crop. Human activities
    have highly affected the properties of soil and hence our ability to cultivate
    the crops [15]. In general, there are 17 essential elements as listed in table
    3 which play an important role in plant growth [16]. The growth of crops depends
    on the nutrients available in a particular soil. The soil nutrients are mostly
    monitored by electric and electromagnetic sensors [8]. Depending on the nutrients
    farmers make informed decisions as to which crop is optimal for the land. However,
    the nutrients can be added through fertilizers, manure, etc. but with an additional
    cost. Some of them may also damage the environment and have an adverse effect
    on the soil cycle. TABLE 3 Essential Plant Nutrients [2] A scientific analysis
    of soil nutrients, soil moisture, pH is important for determining the soil properties.
    Acar et al. [17] employed an extreme learning machine (ELM) based regression model
    for prediction of soil surface humidity. The author selected two terrains having
    area 4 KM2 and 16 KM2 located in Dicle university campus for experimental analysis.
    The real-time field data was extracted using polarimetric Radarsat-2 data, which
    was pre-processed using the SNAP toolbox [18] and features were added with the
    help of local measurements by separating the field into square grids. Once the
    pre-processing and feature extraction is done the data is passed to ELM based
    regression model to predict the soil surface humidity. The algorithm was tested
    with 5 different kernel functions and the prediction was validated using leave-one-out
    cross-validation technique. The experimental results confirmed the lowest root
    mean square error (RMSE) of 2.19% when using ‘sine’ kernel function. Wang et al.
    [19] deployed soft sensors based on ELM for the measurement of nutrient solution
    composition in the soilless cultivation method. The soilless cultivation method
    is an emerging planting method. It is imperative to monitor the pH value, temperature
    and concentration changes in nutrient solution composition as the performance
    of soilless cultivation is highly dependent on these parameters. The significant
    variables in a nutrient solution cannot be measured directly hence these are determined
    with the help of auxiliary variables. The authors utilized conductivity, pH value,
    flow rate, and temperature measurements for auxiliary measurements. These auxiliary
    measurements are fed to a deep belief network-based ELM which predicts the values
    of significant variables. For experimental analysis, the authors deployed the
    model to measure the concentration of SO 2− 4 , and H 2 PO − 4 in a nutrient solution.
    The authors reported an average RMSE of 1.2414 for predictions in SO 2− 4 and
    RMSE of 0.8892 for prediction of H 2 PO − 4 . Park et al. [20] utilized ML algorithms
    to predict the soil moisture using data from MODIS. The authors downscaled the
    AMSR2 soil moisture to 1KM using random forest (RF) and Cubist algorithms. An
    ensemble of these algorithms was used to obtain soil moisture data. The results
    obtained through the ML methods were compared with the statistical ordinary least
    squares technique. The ML model exhibited a R 2 (coefficient of determination)
    of 0.96 and an RMSE of 0.06, whereas a R 2 of 0.47 and a RMSE of 0.16 was associated
    with the statistical ordinary least squares. Reda et al. [21] explored ML algorithms
    to estimate soil organic carbon (SOC) and total nitrogen (TN) in soil samples
    collected from four agricultural lands of Moroccan. Data set of near-infrared
    spectroscopy is utilized in comparison to traditional chemical methods as this
    technique reduces the computation time and resource utilization. The ensemble
    learning modeling algorithm presents the best performance among other regression
    models and back-propagation neural networks (BPNN) algorithm. The proposed algorithm
    presents R 2 of 0.96, RMSE of 1.92, performance to deviation (RPD) of 4.87 for
    SOC and R 2 of 0.94 and RMSE of 0.57, RPD of 4.91 for TN prediction. Morellos
    et al. [22] also utilized visible and infrared spectroscopy to determine TN, SOC,
    and moisture content (MC) in the arable field in Premslin Germany. Spectroscopy
    dataset is used for building the predictive ML model for estimating all three
    soil properties. Least square support vector machine (LS-SVM) and cubist ML algorithms
    outperform principal component regression and partial least square regression
    multivariate methods in terms of RMSE and residual prediction deviation (RPD).
    LS-SVM best predict SOC and MC with RMSE of 0.062 and 0.457, RPD of 2.24, and
    2.20. Cubist best predicts for TN with RMSE of 0.071 and RPD of 1.96. Andrade
    et al. [23] build ordinary least square regression, RF, cubist regression, XGboost
    prediction model for determining soil properties from portable X-ray fluorescence
    (pXRF) spectrometry dataset in Brazilian coastal plains. Three soil properties
    total nitrogen, soil organic matter (SOM), cation exchange capacity (CEC) were
    analyzed using RF, ordinary least squares regression (OLS), cubist regression
    (CR), XGBoost (XGB). RF algorithm gives the best performance with R 2 of 0.50
    for TN, R 2  0.75 for CEC and 0.56 for SOM. Deiss et al. [24] estimated the soil
    properties (clay, sand, pH, SOC) in northern Tanzania and USA Midwest from the
    spectroscopy dataset using ML algorithms. THE tuned SVM model outperforms the
    partial least square (PLS) regression model in terms of predicting all the soil
    parameters. Mahmoudzadeh et al. [25] explored the ML algorithm to predict SOC
    in the Kurdistan province of Iran. The simulation results suggest that RF accurately
    predicts SOC with R 2 of 0.60 and RMSE of 0.35% in comparison to SVM, kNN, Cubist,
    and Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) ML algorithm. The study also suggests
    that air temperature, annual rainfall, valley depth, texture of terrain surface
    are some of the important factors that influence SOC spread over the Kurdistan
    region. Veres et al. [26] explored DL architecture such as CNN for predicting
    the soil properties from the infra-red spectroscopy dataset. Benke et al. [27]
    predict soil electrical conductivity (EC) and SOC in different regional locations
    of Victoria, Australia using pedotransfer function (PTF) based on ML algorithm.
    PTF basically converts soil measurement into soil properties and provides inputs
    for ML simulation algorithms. In the proposed approach PTF use Generalised Linear
    Mixed Effects Model (GLMM) model and Residual Maximum Likelihood (REML) to predict‘
    the soil properties. Traditional approaches to soil properties and crop yield
    prediction require time-consuming field surveys and the deployment of expensive
    sensors. Khanal et al. [28] proposed an alternative approach in which the dataset
    for the prediction of soil properties and crop yield is generated using remotely
    sensed aerial images of agricultural land. Five soil properties, viz. pH value,
    magnesium (Mg), potassium (K), SOM, CEC, and crop yield were predicted using RF,
    SVM, Cubist, NN, Gradient Boosting Model (GBM) ML algorithms. NN presents the
    highest prediction accuracy for SOM having R 2 of 0.64, RMSE of 0.44 and CEC having
    R 2 of 0.67, RMSE of 2.35; SVM best predicts K having R 2 of 0.21, RMSE of 0.49
    and Mg having R 2 of 0.22, RMSE of 4.57; and GBM best predicts pH having R 2 of
    0.15, RMSE of 0.62. RF outperforms other algorithms in terms of crop yield prediction
    and presents higher accuracy having R 2 of 0.53 and RMSE of 0.97. Labrador et
    al. [29] estimate calcium and Mg content in soil using generalized regression
    NN and genetic algorithm (GA). The digital elevation model and satellite images
    were used as input to the prediction model for estimating the soil properties.
    Chlingaryan et al. [30] discussed different ML approaches used in precision agriculture
    for accurate crop yield prediction and soil nitrogen estimation over the last
    fifteen years. Ju-Young et al. [31] investigated a seasonal climatic forecasting
    model using regularized ELM to predict day-wise mean air temperature at field
    level for a period of 90 days. The authors selected data from Korea Metrological
    Administration using the Met GloSea5GC2 model [32]. The authors fed 240 days of
    forecast data and hindcast data from the ensemble based model to the RELM algorithm.
    The algorithm performance was evaluated by measuring: RMSE, mean absolute error
    (MAE) the model prediction vs the actual values. The authors achieved an RMSE
    in the range of 1.02 to 3.35 which outperformed the meteorological data which
    has an RMSE range of 1.61 to 3.37. Soil moisture content is an important parameter
    to acknowledge in the agriculture industry as it addresses precise irrigation
    scheduling. Stamenkovic et al. [33] build a support vector regression (SVR) prediction
    model to predict soil moisture content from remotely sensed hyperspectral images.
    Song et al. [34] proposed a macroscopic cellular automata (MCA) model and combined
    its deep belief network (DBN) to predict soil moisture content over a cornfield
    in northwest china. The simulation results of DBN-MCA outperforms the multi-layer
    perceptron (MLP)-MCA in terms of RMSE. Acheing [35] explored the SVR model (i.e.
    RBF), ANN, DNN for simulating soil water retention curve (SWRC) curve of loamy
    sand. Dataset of loamy sand subjected to wetting and drying condition is collected
    using a reflectometer and tensiometer. RBF based SVR model best predicts SWRC
    under both wet and dry conditions. Feng et al. [36] estimate soil temperature
    at various soil depths of Loess Plateau of China. Four different ML algorithms
    ELM, generalized regression neural networks (GRNN), backpropagation neural networks
    (BPNN), and RF were investigated for predicting the soil temperature. ML algorithms
    were trained with air temperature, wind speed, relative humidity, and vapour pressure
    and solar radiation as input parameters and the simulations show that ELM outperforms
    other ML algorithms in terms of RMSE, MAE, Nash–Sutcliffe coefficient (NS) and
    concordance correlation coefficient. Mohammadi et al. [37] explored ELM for predicting
    daily dew point temperature in different parts of Iran. This part of the world
    experience different climatic conditions throughout the year. The proposed model
    accurately predicts dew point temperature than SVM and ANN algorithms. Zhu et
    al. [38] accurately predict daily evapotranspiration in Northwest China using
    hybrid particle swarm optimization (PSO)-ELM model to optimize crop water requirement
    in agriculture. Alizamir et al. [39] accurately predicts soil temperature at different
    depths of 5, 10, 50 and 100 cm using ELM, ANN, classification and regression trees,
    group method of data handling using dataset obtained from Mersin station operated
    by Turkish Meteorological Service. The simulation results suggest that soil temperature
    can be estimated easily using air temperature upto depth of 50 cm while for depth
    of 100 cm additional information of solar radiation and wind speed is required.
    Rainfall prediction plays a critical role in the water resource management system,
    flood risk assessment, and the agriculture industry. Acknowledging the chaotic
    nature of rainfall, it is very difficult for statistical approaches to accurately
    predict the rainfall. Cramer et al. [40] evaluated the performance of seven ML
    algorithms for rainfall prediction. The statistical results show that the radial-basis
    function neural network (RBFNN) shows the best performance among other state of
    the art algorithms. Sierra and Jesus [41] predicted the rainfall in Tenerife,
    an island in Spain based on atmospheric synoptic patterns using different ML algorithms
    and found NN gave the best performance among other ML algorithms. Kamatchi and
    Parvathi [42] employed NN for weather prediction and proposed a hybrid recommender
    system for enhancing the success ratio of the system. Lazri et al. [43] build
    a multi-classifier model for estimating precipitation using MSG images (Meteosat
    second generation) and dataset obtained using radar. The proposed approach shows
    that the proposed multi-classifier improves the standard of classification. Shardoor
    and Rao [44] surveyed three different approaches i.e. ML techniques, data mining
    techniques, and satellite forecasting techniques for rainfall prediction. Table
    4 presents a comparative study of different ML algorithms for prediction of soil
    properties and weather prediction. TABLE 4 Different ML Algorithms for Prediction
    of Soil Properties and Weather Conditions B. Crop Yield Prediction A significant
    piece of information for any farmer is the prediction of crop yield and how the
    yield can be increased. pH value, soil type, and quality, weather pattern: temperature,
    rainfall, humidity, sunshine hours, fertilizers, and harvesting schedules are
    some of the parameters which play an important role in predicting the crop yield
    [45]. Scientifically manual farming can be considered as a feedback control system
    in which the corrective action is taken once a setback in a crop is observed.
    The crop yield will highly depend on the efficiency of the optimal utilization
    of the above-mentioned resources. If some kind of anomaly goes undetected in the
    initial stage may harm the crop yield in an unprecedented way. Singh et al. [46]
    assessed hailstorms on India’s wheat production and observes that in February
    and March 2015 alone the hailstorm events caused a decline of 8.4% in national
    wheat production. For financially weak farmers in a country such as India, where
    intermittent storage of harvested crops is a rare resource, accurate weather predictions
    may turn to be miraculous for farmers. ML models when systematically applied to
    a system act as feedforward control. With the help of accurate ML models, we can
    anticipate the factors which are going to affect the crop yield. Hence the corrective
    action can be taken before even an anomaly hits the crop production. Kamir et
    al. [47] used ML models to identify the yield gap hotspots in wheat production.
    Authors generated very high-resolution yield maps using data from various sources
    between 2009 and 2015. The data was collected from various sources:(a) NDVI time-series
    data across Australia using the MOD13Q1 data set [48], (b) rainfall and temperature
    data were collected from historic climate data at Australia bureau of metrology,
    (c) maps for observed grain yield were collected at source using intelligent harvesting
    machines. The dataset generated were tested with 9 ML algorithms: RF, XGBoost,
    Cubist, MLP, SVR, Gaussian Process, k-NN, and Multivariate Adaptive Regression
    Splines. The authors combined predictions from each of the algorithms into ensembles
    for prediction optimization [49]. Out of these algorithms, SVR with RBFNN outperformed
    other algorithms and investigators were able to achieve the yield estimate with
    an R 2  of 0.77 and an RMSE value of 0.55t ha −1 . The results were validated
    using 10-fold cross-validation techniques applied to the full data set. Aghighi
    et al. [50] used various advanced regression algorithms to predict the yield of
    silage maize crops. The authors selected maize fields located at Moghan Agro-Industrial
    and Animal Husbandry Company (MAIAHC), which is about 28,000 hectares’ area and
    located in Iran. The crop yield dataset was collected for around 40 silage maize
    fields were collected for a period from 2013-2015. In addition to it, the historic
    crop yield data the authors also gathered time-series NDVI data from Landsat 8
    OLI satellite. The data was fed to advanced regression algorithms: (a) Gaussian
    Process Regression, (b) SVR, (c) Boosted Regression tree (d) RF Regression models
    and the prediction form each of the regression models were compared and evaluated.
    Authors found out the boosted regression tree reported best evaluation parameters
    with an average R-value of higher than 0.87, and RMSE in a range of 8.5 to 11.10,
    with a mean value of 9.5 during the period 2013-14. Kuwata and Shibasaki [51]
    employed DL models to estimate the crop yield. Authors deployed SVR for predicting
    the yield of corn in Illinois. For input following dataset was employed by the
    authors: (a) 5 year moving average of corn crop yield, (b) The enhanced vegetation
    index is obtained using the MOD09A1 dataset MODIS satellite, and (c) Historic
    climatic data. The dataset was fed to support the vector regression model and
    the authors reported an RMSE of 8.204 and a correlation coefficient of 0.644 for
    the model. For result, validation authors conducted 10-fold cross-validation on
    the full data set. Kulkarni et al. [52] utilized DL models to predict rice crop
    yield. The authors utilized soil properties and nutrients measurements recorded
    over 31 years and historic rainfall data. The input data was fed to recurrent
    neural network models for crop yield prediction. For effective prediction the
    authors explored different activation functions viz. sigmoid, reLu, and linear
    in the neural network. Chu and Yu [53] builds an end to end summer and winter
    rice prediction model in 81 counties in the Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region,
    China. The proposed BBI model works in three stages, in the first stage the original
    area data and time series metrological data is pre-processed and its output works
    as input for the second stage where BPNN and RNN (recurrent neural network) learns
    deep spatial and temporal features from the input data. In the third stage, BPNN
    learns the relationship between deep features and rice yield to predict the summer
    and winter rice yields. The performance of the model is evaluated in terms of
    error and rate of convergence, the model presents lowest error values with MAE
    and RMSE of 0.0044 and 0.0057 for summer rice prediction and 0.0074 and 0.0192
    for winter rice prediction while the algorithm converges within 100 iterations.
    Feng et al. [54] proposed a hybrid approach for wheat yield prediction in new-south
    Wales in southeastern Australia. Multiple growth specific indicators, viz. agricultural
    production system simulators (APSIM), NDVI, and SPEI (Standardized Precipitation
    and Evapotranspiration Index) are used before the prediction of wheat yield using
    regression models (multiple linear regression (MLR) and RF). APSIM+ RF hybrid
    model presents the best performance among other predictors in terms of prediction
    accuracy. Cai et al. [55] integrated two data sources, i.e. climate data and satellite
    data over fourteen years to predict the wheat yield in Australia using ML algorithms
    (SVM, RF, and NN). Simulation results show that climate data provides distinctive
    information in comparison to satellite data for yield prediction with R 2 of around
    0.75. Planting the crops on accurate date plays an important role in improving
    productivity and reducing financial loss. Gumuscu et al. [56] explored three supervised
    ML algorithms; kNN, SVM, and decision trees for predicting planting dates; early,
    normal, and late for wheat crops in Turkey. The authors utilized climate data
    of the last 300 days to train ML algorithms and explored GA for feature selection.
    kNN classification ML algorithm shows robust performance and best predicts the
    planting dates of wheat crops. Several African, American, and Asian countries
    are the major producer of coffee in the world. Nevavuori et al. [57] explored
    a deep learning approach, i.e. CNN for wheat and barley yield prediction in the
    agriculture field of Pori, Finland. NDVI and RGB dataset obtained from cameras
    installed in UAV is used to train the six-layer CNN. RGB dataset best predicts
    the crop yield in CNN with MAE of 484.3 kgha−1 and mean absolute percentage error
    (MAPE) of 8.8%. Koirala et al. [58] reviewed deep learning approaches for fruit
    detection and yield estimation. CNN in the context of computer vision is widely
    used for feature extraction from images that provide useful insight to object
    detection and yield estimation. Kouadio, et al. [59] predicted the Robusta coffee
    yield using ML techniques from soil fertility dataset of Vietnam. ELM model outperforms
    multiple linear regression and RF algorithm with RMSE of 496.35 kg ha−1 and MAE
    of 326.40 kg ha−1. Gamboa et al. [60] predict the cocoa yield in Santander, Columbia
    using a generalized linear model (GLM) and SVM. In recent decades researchers
    have explored statistical and probabilistic models for crop yield prediction.
    Gyamerah et al. [61] proposed a novel robust probabilistic forecasting model based
    on quantile random forest and Epanechnikov kernel function (QRF-E) for crop yield
    prediction in Ghana. The proposed approach didn’t only predict discrete yield
    values but completely showcase probability descriptions for prediction interval
    for the two crops groundnut and millet. The simulation result shows the superior
    performance of the proposed algorithm in terms of prediction intervals coverage
    probability and prediction interval normalized average width under uncertain weather
    conditions. Peng et al. [62] explored remote sensed satellite-based Solar-Induced
    Chlorophyll Fluorescence (SIF) dataset for training ML algorithms to predict maize
    and soybean yield in the mid-west region of the United States. Simulation results
    show that non-linear algorithms such as SVM, ANN, RF best predict the crop yield
    in comparison to least absolute shrinkage and selection operator regression (LASSO)
    and ridge regression (RIDGE) algorithm. Khaki and Wang [63] predicted the hybrid
    maize yield with a dataset of 2,267 locations of the United States and Canada
    between the years 2008 to 2016 using deep neural networks (DNN). Genotype, weather,
    and soil properties were the three components used to train DNN. The proposed
    model accurately predicts the maize yield with RMSE of 12% of the average yield
    for predicted weather dataset and 11% of the average yield for perfect weather
    dataset and outperforms LASSO, shallow neural network (SNN) and regression tree
    (RT). Simulation results show that environmental factors have a large impact on
    the prediction accuracy of crop yield. In most areas of Africa, agriculture field
    data is scarcely available thus remotely sensed dataset is widely used for monitoring
    the field. Leroux et al. [64] explored the ML algorithm for predicting the maize
    yield in Burkina Faso with a remotely sensed dataset. A process-based crop model
    SARRO which is basically designed to simulate attainable agricultural yields under
    tropical conditions is used in this study. RF outperforms MLR in maize yield prediction
    with R 2 of 0.59 at the end of the season and 0.49 before two months of harvest.
    Li et al. [65] build a statistical model for predicting the rain-fed crop yield
    using climate, satellite, and country-specific datasets in the mid-west region
    of the USA. Maimaitijiang et al. [66] explored the potential of UAV with DNN for
    soybean yield prediction from the fields of Columbia, Missouri, USA. Multi-modal
    information such as canopy spectral, structural, and thermal features extracted
    from images obtained from the sensors installed on UAV is used as the input dataset
    for training DNN. The simulation result shows that DNN accurately predict the
    crop yield and outperforms partial least square regression (PLSR), RF, SVR algorithms
    with R 2 of 0.720 and RMSE of 15.9%. Zhang et al. [67] explored ANN for prediction
    of annual crop planting utilizing a historical cropland data layer (CDL) dataset
    of corn-belt of mid-west, USA. Kocian et al. [68] utilized both approaches to
    predict crop growth in greenhouses. IoT smart sensors are installed in the greenhouses
    to monitor different environmental parameters, soil properties and plant growth
    parameters such as leaf area index (LAI), accumulated dry weight (DW) and evapo-transpiration
    (ET). These parameters are in real-time send to the cloud through IoT devices
    and permit the implementation of an agriculture decision-support system. The probabilistic
    Bayesian network is explored in the proposed system to predict crop development
    parameters. Shahinfar and Kahn [69] explored ML algorithms for early prediction
    of adult wool growth in Merino sheep of Australia. Model Tree algorithms best
    predict the wool growth in comparison with NN with a correlation coefficient of
    0.93, 0.90, 0.94, 0.81 and 0.59, MAE of 0.48 kg, 0.41 kg, 0.92 μm , 6.91mm and
    6.82 N/ktex, for predicting Greasy Fleece Weight, adult Clean Fleece Weight, adult
    Fibre Diameter and adult Staple Length. Table 5 presents a comparative study of
    different ML algorithms for crop yield prediction. TABLE 5 Different ML Algorithms
    for Crop Yield Prediction C. Disease and Weed Detection Disease fungi, microorganisms,
    and bacteria take their energy from the plants they live on, which in turn affects
    the crop yield. If not detected at the right time may account for a huge economic
    loss to farmers. A lot of financial burden goes to a farmer in the form of pesticides,
    to get rid of diseases and restore the functioning of crops. Excessive use of
    pesticides also leads to environmental damage and the effects of the water and
    soil cycle of the agricultural land. Using an optimally designed AI system during
    crop growth period not only reduces the risk of crop disease and minimizes the
    economic impact, but it also results in minimizing the adverse impact of unsystematic
    farming on the environment. Sambasivan and Opiyo [70] used a CNN based DL model
    to detect disease in cassava crops for imbalanced datasets. The authors took a
    database of 10,000 labeled images that were pre-processed to improve the image
    contrast using contrast limited adaptive histogram equalization algorithm. The
    model evaluation was done using the performance metrics: confusion matrix, accuracy
    measure, precision measure, sensitivity, and F1 score. The authors reported a
    best-case accuracy of 99.30% and the lowest accuracy was reported as 76.9%. Ramcharan
    et al. [71] used DL algorithms to detect diseases in cassava crops. Authors deployed
    deep CNN to identify three different diseases and two types of pests from a set
    of 11,670 images dataset. Author’s utilized GoogLeNet algorithm based Inception
    v3 in Tensor Flow. The authors achieved efficiency in a range of 80% to 93.0%,
    and the validation of the results was done with the help of the confusion matrix.
    Mohanty et al. [72] employed DL methods to detect crop disease from the image
    dataset of plant leaves. The authors used a public database consisting of smartphone
    generated 54,306 images of diseased and healthy plants leaves. These images were
    resized to 256×256 pixels and were assigned 38 different class labels of crop-disease
    pair, and transformed into 3 datasets color, grayscale and segmented. The dataset
    was then fed to two of the most common deep CNNs: AlexNet [73] and GoogLeNet [74].
    The authors achieved an accuracy of 99.34% for GoogLeNet, and an accuracy of 85.53%
    for AlexNet network. The results were validated using F1 score, authors achieved
    a mean F1 score of 0.9886 for GoogLeNet, and a mean F1 score of 0.9848 for AlexNet.
    Amara et al. [75] used LeNet based CNN architecture for disease detection in banana
    leaves. Authors utilized data from open source local and digital libraries which
    were pre-processed and resized to 60×60 pixels, and the model was implemented
    for RGB as well as grayscale images. Hughes and Salathe [76] utilized this developed
    model for the identification of diseases in the images dataset. The authors achieved
    the best F1 score of 0.9971 for detection in RGB images and a score of 0.976 for
    grayscale images. Ferreira et al. [77] deployed CNN for the identification of
    weeds in soybean crops. The image dataset for soy plantation located at São José
    farm, Campo Grande Brazil was acquired using phantom DJI3 drone. The images are
    segmented using the SLIC algorithm into square grids. For training, the segmented
    images were manually annotated to their class. The segmented images dataset was
    fed to AlexNet (a convolution neural network) for classification. The performance
    of the AlexNet was compared with SVM, AdaBoost, and RF. To evaluate the performance
    of the AlexNet the model was fed with a balanced dataset and the authors reported
    an overall accuracy of above 90% and 96.3% images were correctly classified. Waheed
    et al. [78] proposed a cost-effective optimized dense CNN (DenseNet) for disease
    detection in corn leaves with an accuracy of 98.0%. Simulation results show that
    the proposed model outperforms other CNN models such as EfficientNet, VGG19Net,
    NASNet, and XceptionNet in terms of fewer parameters, accuracy, computation complexity,
    and computation time. Pereira et al. [79] proposed an expert system for identifying
    three species of aquatic weeds from aquatic weed leaves dataset based on their
    shape and supervised pattern recognition techniques. The author explored five
    shape descriptors with different shape-based skills viz. Beam Angle Statistics
    (BAS), Fourier Descriptors (FD), Moment Invariants (MI), Multi-scale Fractal dimension
    (MS), and Tensor Scale Descriptor (TSD) along with five ML algorithms viz. Optimum-Path
    Forest (OPF), SVM, Naive Bayes, ANN, MLP. Simulation results show that OPF using
    the BAS-100 descriptor presents the best results with a recognition rate of 96.41%
    in comparison to other approaches. Jiang et al. [80] proposed a semi-supervised
    CNN feature-based Graph Convolutional Network (GCN) for identifying weeds utilizing
    6000 images of corn, lettuce, radish, and mixed weed dataset. The proposed approach
    works in two parts, i.e. in the first part CNN model is used for feature extraction
    thereafter in the second part GCN graph is explored utilizing CNN feature dataset
    for extracting feature of an unlabelled dataset using labelled dataset. The proposed
    approach shows the best results in comparison with AlexNet, VGG16, and ResNet-101
    approaches with recognition accuracies of 97.80%, 99.37%, 98.93%, and 96.51% on
    four different weed datasets. Oppenheim and Shani [81] explored CNN for identifying
    four different types of diseases in potatoes. The simulation result shows that
    the model trained on 90% of the images and tested on 10% of images give the best
    results with 96% accuracy. Sugar beet contributes around 30% of world sugar production.
    Leaf spot diseases in sugar beet can create a loss of around 10 % to 50 % of yearly
    sugar yield. Rumpf et al. [82] proposed SVM with a radial basis function as a
    kernel based model for early detection and classification of three diseases Cercospora,
    leaf spot, leaf rust, and powdery mildew in sugar beet leaves. Diseased and non-diseased
    leaves were classified with an accuracy of 97% and three diseases were identified
    with accuracy higher than 86%. Ozguven and Adem [83] proposed updated faster R-CNN
    for leaf spot disease identification and classification in sugar beet. Leaf spot
    disease initially generates as small circular spots and later spread over the
    entire leaf surface. The proposed R-CNN architecture changes its parameters according
    to the images and the disease infected regions, which improves the overall classification
    rate to 95.48%. Bah et al. [84] explored CNN for weed detection in images obtained
    using UAV from bean and spinach fields. The proposed model first identifies the
    crop rows and then identifies the inter-crop row weeds which are used as a training
    dataset for CNN for crop and weed identification and classification. Kerkech et
    al. [85] identified the vine diseases from visible and infrared UAV images obtained
    in the Center Val de Loire region in France. A CNN model is trained with this
    dataset of images to classify each pixel according to different instances, namely,
    shadow, ground, healthy, and symptom. The model identifies with an accuracy of
    92% at grapevine-level and 87% at leaf level. Oslen et al. [86] explored robust
    deep learning models Inception-v3 and ResNet-50 for weed species identification
    and classification from a dataset of images collected in Australian rangeland.
    Simulation results show that the average classification performance of both the
    models is 95.1% and 95.7%. These results found fruitful for automatic real-time
    robotic weed control in the agricultural field. Sudars et al. [87] establish an
    experimental set up with RGB digital cameras in Latvia to collect images of the
    field having 6 food crops and 8 weed species grown in normal field conditions
    and controlled environment. This dataset can be utilized by deep learning algorithms
    for weed identification and classification. Sethy et al. [88] identified the rice
    leaf disease based on a hybrid CNN and SVM. In this model, CNN is explored for
    deep feature extraction from 5932 diseased rice leaf images and this data is used
    as input for SVM classifier. The resnet50 with SVM classification model best classify
    with respect to other models with F1 score of 0.9838. Garcia et al. [89] proposed
    an ML and DL learning hybrid approach for weed and crop identification in the
    agriculture fields of Greece. Image dataset of two crops tomato and cotton and
    two weeds black nightshade and velvetleaf was generated for training and testing
    of the model. Initially CNN (Xception, Inception-Resnet, Vignette’s, Mobilenet,
    and Densenet)) is used for feature extraction and this feature set is later used
    to train ML classifier (SVM, XGBoost and Logistic Regression) for classification.
    The simulation result shows that Densenet and Support Vector Machine outperforms
    other approaches with F1 score of 99.29%. Shah and Jain [90] identified the disease
    in cotton leaf through ANN with some image pre-processing techniques. Yu et al.
    [91] explored deep learning algorithms with a dataset of images for identifying
    dandelion, ground ivy, and spotted spurge in perennial ryegrass. Parraga-Alava
    et al. [92] generated a robusta coffee leaf image dataset (RoCoLe) for disease
    identification using ML algorithms. Glezakos et al. [93] proposed an innovative
    method to identify two viruses Tobacco Rattle Virus (TRV) and the Cucumber Green
    Mottle Mosaic Virus (CGMMV) in plants. In the proposed research Bio-Electric Recognition
    Assay (BERA) technique is utilized to obtain time-series information of the two
    viruses by measuring the waves through biosensors for 331s. This time-series data
    is preprocessed using GA to eliminate noise and for dimensionality reduction of
    a large dataset. Thereafter this meta-data is used to train MLP neural network
    classifier. The proposed model is tested against other ML classifiers via cross-validation.
    Ramesh and Vydeki [94] explored optimized deep NN with the Jaya algorithm for
    the identification of paddy leaf diseases. A dataset of rice plant leaves was
    taken from the agricultural field to identify and classify normal, bacterial blight,
    brown spot, sheath rot, and blast diseases. Simulation results show that the proposed
    model accurately classifies the diseased and normal images with an accuracy of
    98.9%, 95.78%, 92%, 94%, and 90.57% for blast affected, bacterial blight, sheath
    rot, brown spot, and normal rice leaf images. Chechlin’ ski et al. [95] explored
    CNN for weed identification in four plant species at different growth level and
    under varying light conditions. CNN architecture combines U-Net, MobileNets, DenseNet,
    and ResNet models for classification of weeds in crops. In [96]–[99] author has
    reviewed machine and deep learning techniques for weed, pests and disease identification,
    and classification in crops at different growth stages. Table 6 presents a comparative
    study of different ML algorithms for disease and weed identification. TABLE 6
    Different ML Algorithms for Disease and Weed Identification D. Drip Irrigation
    In the modern era, irrigation for crops has been improvised using the concept
    of drip irrigation [100], where the system consists of thin plastic tubes placed
    in or above the soil along the vertical rows of the plants for nurturing the water
    supply to the crops. Employing the proper operational management of drip irrigation,
    minimizes the utilization of water supply for crop production, and provides a
    better yield of crops. Socio-economic and environmental demands have widely appreciated
    in use of drip irrigation on farmlands for agriculture, especially for the high
    cost valued crops i.e., vegetables and fruits. Furthermore, drip irrigation is
    based on the low-pressure watering system in comparison to sprinkler systems;
    this makes the system more efficient in terms of energy consumption [101]. Various
    advantages have been observed using drip irrigation in agriculture over other
    irrigation systems which include sub-irrigation systems or sprinkler irrigation
    systems. These advantages are entitled to minimal usage of water supply, usage
    of soluble fertilizers through a drip irrigation system, automated system, minimization
    of soil erosion, uninterrupted activities, minimized weed problems, facilitation
    of double-cropping. Precision irrigation is another innovative approach in intelligent
    farming where it uses the water intelligently that further helps the farmers to
    achieve better yield in crops with minimal water usage. It can also be featured
    as providing the right amount of water, at the right time and the right place
    in the field. It focuses its implementation based on variable rate irrigation
    (VRI) methods employing drips or sprinklers. [102]–[104]. Advancements in the
    field of on-farm sensor technologies, weather forecasting, IoT based sensor detection
    system of vegetation and precision-based smart irrigation produces a huge size
    of data that ultimately benefits the farmers in optimizing the usage of water
    resources, improve the yield of crops and maximizes the profit of farmers [105].
    ML and DL and reinforcement learning are employed on the historical data and it
    provides various opportunities for real-time prediction and decision making purposes
    for smart irrigation which are solely based on the data collected by the sensors
    and IoT enabled systems [106]–[109]. Roberts et al. [110] have discussed that
    a sensor-based control system might create some bottleneck in terms of reducing
    the reliability of decision support tools on process-based crop models, which
    further may require costly calibration and affect in generating an uncertain representation
    of soil-plant-atmosphere processes. Further, ML techniques have been employed
    extremely well for protection analysis of hydrological processes i.e., soil moisture
    and groundwater levels [111], [112]. Li et al. [113] utilized ANN for estimating
    nitrate distribution in different types of soils under a drip irrigation system.
    Kavianand et al. [114] proposed a fully automated drip irrigation system based
    on the ARM9 processor along with different kinds of sensors equipped for monitoring
    the PH content and nitrogen content of the soil and controlling the irrigation
    of the field. Emmanuel et al. [115] establishes an experimental set-up in a greenhouse
    in Malaysia to monitor the growth of mustard leaf vegetable plants through IoT
    devices and alongside developed a data-driven model of drip irrigation system.
    Soil moisture, irrigation volume, evapotranspiration were measured through sensors
    and were given to the Raspberry Pi 3 controller for storing it in the cloud. This
    data was utilized by different predictive models ARX, BJ, and state-space models
    to predict soil moisture content for an optimized drip irrigation system. ARX
    model outperforms other predictive models in terms of MSE and response time. Seyedzadeh
    et al. [116] explored ML algorithms to optimize the uniform emitter discharge
    rate of drip irrigation system under varying pressure and temperature conditions.
    In this model operating pressure, water temperature, discharge coefficient, pressure
    exponent, and nominal discharge were taken as input parameters while ration of
    emitter discharge to nominal discharge is taken as output temperature. Authors
    explored four different ML algorithms for optimizing emitter discharge rate and
    simulation results show that LS-SVM presents best results with the least error
    of mean absolute error. Peng et al. [117] utilize soil moisture, soil electrical
    conductivity, air temperature, and light intensity parameters to build an optimized
    irrigation prediction model using backpropagation NN in China. The proposed prediction
    model presents good results with MSE of 0.00857724. The authors also identified
    an optimized layout and network arrangement for pipe in a drip irrigation system
    using computational fluid dynamics (CFD) software. The simulation results present
    that the H-shaped network layout is more suitable for field crop irrigation than
    the comb-shaped and fish bone-shaped layout. Drip irrigation system gives the
    best performance when the wetting front dimension, i.e. diameter, depth, and upward
    movement are optimized. Shiri et al. [118] explored soft-computing approaches
    viz., gene expressions programming (GEP), and RF techniques in modeling wetting
    front dimensions over different soil types for surface and sub-surface irrigation
    system. Proposed model, best predicts ETc with an improved correlation coefficient
    and decreases MSE and MAE. Elnesr and Alazba [119] explored ANN for predicting
    the wetting front dimensions from the dataset of a well-tested HYDRUS 2D/3D model.
    The simulation results show that the proposed model has a good correlation of
    0.93-0.99. Chang et al. [120] developed a smart irrigation model based on ML with
    the LoRa P2P network to learn the irrigation experiences from the expert farmers
    working on greenhouse organic crops. Singh et al. [121] have discussed an ML and
    IoT based model for soil moisture prediction during irrigation. Torres-Sanchez
    et al. [122] proposed a decision support system for irrigation management of citric
    crops in southeast Spain. In the proposed model smart sensors are deployed in
    the field to monitor water supplied previous week, weather data, soil water status,
    and based on this data three regression models SVM, RF, and Linear regression
    was trained to build the irrigation decision support system. RF best predicts
    with comparatively less prediction error. Hellín et al. [123] explored the Partial
    Least Square Regression (PLSR) and Adaptive Neuro-Fuzzy Inference System (ANFIS)
    model for building a smart irrigation decision support system crops in southeast
    Spain. Goumopoulos et al. [124] proposed a real-time adaptable intelligent and
    autonomous closed-loop irrigation management system. The authors built an experimental
    set-up in a greenhouse and deployed wireless sensors for monitoring the plant
    growth and environmental conditions along with plant growth control actuators.
    Estimation of evapotranspiration (ETc) plays a vital role in water resource management
    system. Chen et al. [125] estimate crop actual ETc from temporal convolution network
    (TCN) from the dataset of lysimeters for maize under drip irrigation with film
    mulch. Simulation results show that the proposed model best predicts ETc with
    an improved correlation coefficient and decreases MSE and MAE. Table 7 presents
    a comparative study of different ML algorithms for drip irrigation. TABLE 7 Different
    ML Algorithms for Drip Irrigation E. Livestock Production and Management Livestock
    production is basically related to the production and management of cattle i.e.,
    sheep, pigs, etc. for human consumption in terms of meat. Livestock production
    and their management are based on the farming parameters of these cattle i.e.,
    health, food, nutrition, and behaviour to optimize their production in such a
    way that the economic efficiency of this livestock can be maximized. In the present
    scenario, Artificial intelligence, IoT and Blockchain technologies [126] are widely
    explored to improves livestock sustainability and for analysis of their chewing
    habits, eating patterns, their movement patterns i.e., standing, moving, drinking
    and feeding habits, indicate the amount of stress the animal is going through
    which in turn helps in predicting the vulnerability to disease, weight gain, and
    production of the livestock. Furthermore, an ML-based weight predicting system
    can help in the estimation of their body weight 90–180 days before the slaughtering
    day. According to these analyses and estimations, farmers can change their diet
    plans and living conditions for their better growth in terms of health, behaviour,
    and weight gain which in turn will improve the economic efficiency of these livestock
    [127], [128]. Villeneuve et al. [129] build a decision support system that encounters
    not only real-time data but also expert knowledge for precision sheep farming.
    Livestock production and management can be further classified into two sub-categories,
    i.e., animal welfare and livestock production. Animal welfare generally deals
    with the animal’s health and their well-being; for this ML techniques are applied
    to their health monitoring feature for prospective of early disease detection.
    Whereas, livestock production employs the ML on the estimation of the balanced
    production of livestock for the producers to achieve economic benefits. Dutta
    et al. [130] described a procedure for the classification of cattle behaviour
    employing the ML techniques for data collection using collar-based sensors i.e.,
    magnetometers and three-axis accelerometers. In this study, events such as oestrus
    and dietary changes on cattle have been analyzed for their well-nutrition. Pegorini
    et al. [131] presented an automatic identification and classification of chewing
    habits of claves employing ML-based techniques for analysing their health and
    behavioural patterns. Ebrahimie et al. [132] proposed ML predictive model for
    estimating Sub-Clinical Mastitis (SCM) from milking parameters in dairy herds.
    Mastitis is an inflammatory disease that is widely affecting the dairy industry.
    Author’s explored four classification models decision trees, stump decision trees,
    parallel decision trees, and random forest to discover SCC independent of Somatic
    Cell Count (SCC) which is widely used to measure SCM worldwide. RF with Gini Index
    criteria best predicts SCM with an accuracy of 90%. Ebrahimie et al. [133] explored
    the attribute weighting model (AWM) for identifying lactose concentration and
    electrical conductivity in milk, which are two of the major indicators of SCM
    in dairy cattle. Hyde et al. [134] also explored RF to predict the route of transmission
    of germs and classify them into contagious (CONT) or environmental (ENV) with
    ENV further sub-classified into non-lactating “dry” period (EDP) or lactating
    period (EL). The simulation results show that an accuracy of 98% was achieved
    for discovering CONT vs ENV and 78% for discovering EDP and EL. Esener et al.
    [135] utilized spectral profiles dataset to discriminates CONT and ENV strains
    using GA, NN, and quick classifier. Ebrahimi et al. [136] predicted sub-clinical
    bovine mastitis using a large milking dataset collected through an automated in-line
    monitoring system in commercial New Zealand dairy farm. The simulation results
    show that GBM outperforms other ML model and best predict sub-clinical bovine
    mastitis with an accuracy of 84.9%. Sharifi et al. [137] explored meta-analysis
    and decision trees data mining tools to discover genes that can help to find mastitis
    in dairy cattle. Machado et al. [138] explored the RF model to identify factors
    influencing the occurrence of Bovine viral diarrhea virus (BVDV) viral disease
    in cattle in southern Brazil. The proposed approach identifies that insemination,
    the number of cattle in neighbouring farms, and routine rectal palpation are among
    the main factors of the occurrence of this disease. Matthews et al. [139] developed
    an ML-based automated monitoring system for tracking animal behaviour and movement
    i.e., standing, moving, feeding, and drinking by employing the depth video cameras
    and sensors. Qiao et al. [140] explored the DL technique Mask R-CNN for examining
    cattle health and welfare information in precision livestock management. The proposed
    model extract key features from image frames, enhance the image to remove non-uniform
    illumination shadow influences, segment image of cattle from the background image
    using the Mask R-CNN DL tool, and lastly extract cattle contour lines from the
    segmented image. The proposed approach outperforms SharpMask and DeepMask image
    segmentation models with mean pixel accuracy of 0.92 and an average distance error
    of 33.56 pixels. Liakos et al. [141] explored ML model for predicting healthy
    cattle and cattle suffering from lameness utilizing basic features of cattle which
    includes per day habits of cattle like steps taken, overall walking, lying, and
    eating habits. Morales et al. [142] employed a method based on SVM for early detection,
    warnings, and production issues of eggs in the poultry farms. The simulation results
    show that the proposed technique alerts a day before with an estimation accuracy
    of 0.9854. The identification of livestock is an important aspect of monitoring
    growth and animal welfare. Hansen et al. [143] explored deep learning techniques
    CNN for identifying pigs faces from the dataset of digital images of pigs obtained
    from commercial farm environment where the parameters such as dirt and lighting
    are highly unpredictable. The proposed approach accurately predicts the faces
    with an accuracy of 96.7%. Fenlon et al. [144] build a decision support system
    using predictive ML algorithms to provide calving assistance in the dairy industry.
    Four ML techniques multimodal regression, decision trees, RF, and NN were explored
    to predict three calving difficulties unassisted, slight assistance, and veterinary
    assistance. The simulation result shows that NN and multimodal regression models
    accurately classify 75% of calving difficulties with an average prediction error
    of 3.7% and 4.5%. Fenlon et al. [145] analyzed calving difficulties in dairy herds
    in Ireland using ML algorithms. A dataset of parity, log days in milk, inter-service
    interval, difficulties faced in the last calving, herd body conditions were built
    to predict conceptions using artificial insemination in the Iris dairy industry.
    Logistic regression outperforms RF, decision trees, and Naive Bayes in predicting
    conception using artificial insemination. Borchers et al. [146] explored RF, linear
    discriminant, and NN for calving prediction in dairy cattle by examining their
    behaviour which includes number the of steps, lying time, standing time, transition
    from one state to other and total motion 14 days before the predicted calving
    date. Although, the innovative algorithms play a crucial role in livestock management
    but combining livestock data with public data will improve precision livestock
    farming standards [147]. Table 8 presents a comparative study of different ML
    algorithms for livestock production and management. TABLE 8 Different ML Algorithms
    for Livestock Production and Management F. Intelligent Harvesting Techniques Smart
    harvesting systems helps the farmers to harvest agriculture goods by reducing
    human efforts. In this approach, technologies such as smart sensors, robotics,
    UAVs, and IoT devices [148], AI, and ML-based computer vision techniques are employed
    to intelligently harvest the crops. The research community has provided a comprehensive
    review of different intelligent techniques used to automate the agriculture industry
    [149]–[151] and have analyzed the potential and challenges of this decision support
    system [152]. In the last few years, different robots have been developed for
    harvesting fruits and vegetables [153]. Smart harvesting offers better insight
    into the crops and helps farmers to achieve the potential harvest of crops which
    leads to increased productivity. Smart harvesting system has numerous advantages
    in comparison to traditional harvesting approaches like it requires less labour,
    optimized crop yield, maximum probability, better insight into crops, reduced
    cost of harvesting, and cost-efficient production. A significant problem in the
    Japanese agriculture industry is a labour shortage. Sakai et al. [154] utilized
    machine vision for asparagus robot harvesting in Nagasaki prefecture. The speed
    of asparagus robot harvesting is three times faster than the human being. Since
    asparagus harvesting is modeled on their size and doesn’t require color properties
    thus laser sensor is used to collect 3D distance information in the proposed work.
    Monta et al. [155] also explored laser sensors along with color cameras for tomato
    harvesting through robots. Preter et al. [156] developed an autonomous system
    consisting of e-vehicle, cameras, robotic arm, localization system, gripper, quality
    monitoring, and logistic handling system, which can efficiently detect, plucks,
    and puts the strawberries in a box. The proposed robot prototype is fast enough
    to pluck the fruit in just 4 seconds. Hayashi et al. [157] practically evaluated
    the performance of strawberry harvesting robots in a greenhouse test field. The
    proposed autonomous system efficiently access the fruit position and its maturity
    level and pick the fruit with and without suction in a duration of two to three
    weeks without damaging the fruit. Horng et al. [158] proposed a smart harvesting
    system that employs IoT and smart image recognition systems for the detection
    of mature crops using object detection feature trained on MLP neural network.
    The mature crop can be harvested using a robotic arm whose movement is predicted
    using ML algorithms. Zhang et al. [159] explored Regions-CNN (RCNN) for multi-class
    canopy object detection in shake and catch the apple harvesting system. A dataset
    of RGB images was created in the commercial orchard using a Kinect v2 sensor and
    pre-trained RCNN is utilized for real-time detection of apple, branches, and trunks.
    The authors also developed an estimation algorithm to predict shaking location
    based on the results of RCNN. Spectral and thermal images have also been explored
    for the detection of fruits and vegetables [160], [161]. Zhang et al. [162] investigated
    eleven canopy parameters using principal component analysis (PCA) and classified
    the removal status of apples into mechanically harvested and mechanically unharvested.
    Zhang et al. [163] reviewed technology progress in the mechanical harvesting of
    apples which includes shake and catch, robots, and harvest assist platforms. Pise
    and Upadhye [164] explored Naive Bayes and SVM ML techniques for grading of harvested
    mangoes based on their color, size, features, quality, and maturity. Grading of
    fruits increases the profit of the agriculture and food industries. A mango image
    dataset comprising of three different colors red, green, and yellow is created
    and is used for training and testing the ML algorithm. The proposed approach presents
    limited scope as it can detect defects in a particular surface area which can
    be overcome by creating a dataset of rotational view images. Wu et al. [165] explored
    NN for recognition, classification of fruits and vegetables, and obstacle avoidance
    in a harvesting robot. Table 9 presents a comparative study of different ML algorithms
    for intelligent harvesting. TABLE 9 Different ML Algorithms for Intelligent Harvesting
    SECTION V. IoT Applications in Precision Agriculture Precision agriculture refers
    to a system with minimizing direct involvement of the caretaker/farmer except
    when there is an urgent need or an emergency i.e. when there is a failure in the
    system. IoT helps in maintaining the defined standards of parameters needed for
    day to day work in agriculture. The parameters can be measured using the required
    sensors and can be uploaded to an IoT cloud for remote monitoring so that the
    direct involvement of farmers is minimized. The IoT cloud can be used for control
    purposes also, say for example in detecting and avoiding animal intrusion in the
    agriculture field. Sensors are an integral part of IoT for precision agriculture
    without which the monitoring and controlling becomes next to impossible task.
    Figure 6 shows the trend search of keywords “IoT in agriculture” and “sensor in
    agriculture” on google in the last 10 years. Apart from monitoring and controlling,
    IoT in agriculture is also used as data-storage technology. Parameters like properties
    of soil, crop yield, seasonal behaviour data, temperature changes, etc can be
    stored on the IoT cloud which will be helpful in analyses, prediction, and deciding
    on estimated crop production. FIGURE 6. Google trend response for keywords IoT
    in agriculture and sensor in agriculture for the last 10 years. Show All A. Sensors
    for IoT in Precision Agriculture IoT is defined as the interconnection of things,
    where one example of a thing is a sensor. A group of sensors can communicate with
    every other sensor and thereby with the control center. A WSN in IoT has the benefits
    of increasing the efficiency of production, enhancing the yield quality, detecting
    and avoiding plant-eating pets, detecting the fires in the farms [166]. IoT has
    helped in increasing the scope of farming, animal, and pet rearing along with
    smart irrigation [167]. Sensors form an integral part of IoT architecture in agriculture.
    A sensor is defined as a transducer that converts the sensed parameter (soil moisture,
    for example) into the equivalent electrical signal. Depending on the nature of
    the output signal they generate, sensors are classified as analog or digital sensors.
    An analog sensor’s output needs to be converted to digital before it is being
    fed, processed by any IoT system. On the other hand, sensors that generate signals
    in digital form can be directly connected to any IoT system. Table 10 compares
    the list of some important sensors applicable in precision agriculture. Addressing
    the complete list of sensors available for precision agriculture is beyond the
    scope of this article, although, table 10 provides the list of sensors and their
    parameters that are very widely used and covers almost every aspect of IoT in
    agriculture. A pair of sensors and actuators can be used to collect information
    about some of the vital parameters of precision agriculture and react to perform
    predefined action whenever required. IoT plays an important role in assuring that
    the action performed happens instantaneously with minimum delay. The factors that
    can affect the real-time decision making and causes a delay is the tolerance of
    the measuring parameter and the communication protocol used. The operating temperature
    where the sensors are placed have a proportional effect on tolerance. An increase
    temperature on either side will increase the tolerance of the measuring parameter
    and sensor reading will deviate the value of the measurand from the actual value.
    The communication protocol is used to send the readings of the sensor to the microcontroller
    from where the value will be uploaded to the IoT cloud. The data rate of communication
    protocol decides the time required for this data transfer. TABLE 10 Sensor Parameters
    Used in Precision Agriculture B. Wireless Sensor Networks in Precision Agriculture
    WSN is the collection of spatially displaced sensor deployed to monitor the physical
    parameters of the environment and coordinating the collected data at central location.
    IoT transfers the recorded data to cloud which is further processed and analyzed
    through intelligent algorithms. In precision agriculture integration of artificial
    intelligence with WSN allows real time monitoring and intelligent decision making
    in agriculture fields. IoT sensor network which includes soil moisture senor,
    electrochemical sensor, optical sensors, etc. continuously monitor the field data
    and works as a training data for ML and DL algorithms. Edge computing enabled
    AI systems assist in reducing the amount of data to be uploaded to IoT cloud by
    identification of meaningful data to be communicated and discarding the redundant
    data. Intelligent processing of data generated from nodes result in better management
    of sensor network In [185] author utilized AI driven sensor network to classify
    land as suitable, more suitable, moderately suitable and unsuitable after every
    cultivation. In [186] author developed a power efficient WSN using Arduino microcontroller
    and ZigBee module to monitor and control essential parameters that effect crop
    growth such as soil and weather conditions in Florida, USA. In [187] author integrating
    sensor nodes with AI systems to reduce the power consumption of nodes by optimizing
    the performance and data transmission of respective nodes. RNN based Long-Short
    term (LSTM) network was built which increases the runtime of a single sensor and
    guarantees 180 days autonomous operation using Li-ion battery. The proposed system
    continuously monitors the growth dynamics of plant leaves. In [188] author presents
    an autonomous system built with low power sensor nodes and IoT based cloud platform
    to estimate level of phosphorous in soil through ANN. Author incorporates dynamic
    power management system to maintain balance between energy consumption and estimation
    accuracy. In [189] author presents GA optimized WSN for precision agriculture
    applications. Thus, we conclude that integrating artificial intelligence with
    WSN, IoT plays a key role in assuring the best yield of crops. SECTION VI. Assessment
    and Evaluation of Knowledge-Based Agriculture System In this section ML algorithms
    used by different researchers in the precision agriculture system are analyzed.
    The agriculture industry is facing many challenges across the world, and a knowledge-based
    agriculture system allows sustainable use of resources by the farmers aiming to
    get maximum output from the agriculture land. There are two basic stages in precision
    agriculture, i.e. pre-processing stage and processing stage. In the pre-processing
    phase market trends are studied and based on geographical conditions and soil
    properties of the land seeds are selected and the land is prepared for precision
    agriculture system. In the post-processing stage machine vision techniques are
    explored for disease and weed identification while intelligent techniques are
    used for irrigation and harvesting. In this article, author reviewed and discussed
    70 articles where multiple ML algorithms are presented for performance optimization
    of the agricultural cycle. Figure 7 shows the classification of articles based
    on different applications of precision agriculture. FIGURE 7. Classification based
    on agriculture cycle. Show All Figure 8 depicts the cumulative distribution of
    the ML and DL models used by researchers in precision agriculture. The graph depicts
    the broad categorisation of the techniques with their applications to agricultural
    cycle. It has been observed that in majority of the literature the researchers
    have applied multiple algorithms for classification and parameter prediction.
    Regression models and ANN together make up around 65% of the AI techniques employed
    by researchers. Hence, it is important to investigate the techniques used and
    compared by the authors. The individual best performing algorithms have already
    been covered in appropriate sections, however the figure 8 depicts the distribution
    of the various regression algorithms and DL models throughout the literature.
    ELM algorithm is widely explored in prediction of soil properties such as soil
    moisture, soil temperature, surface humidity, ETc. ANN accurately predicts the
    rainfall and crop yield across different regions of globe. DL based CNN model
    finds wide applications for accurate disease and weed classification in agriculture
    crops. ANN model best predicts the nitrate content and water requirement in drip
    irrigation system. SVM regression model estimates the emitter outflow discharge
    under varying temperature and pressure conditions. Decision Tree algorithm accurately
    identify the chewing habits and predicts SCM in dairy herds. CNN have widely explored
    for livestock identification. Metaheuristic optimized ML algorithms are also explored
    by researchers in precision agriculture. FIGURE 8. ML techniques used in precision
    agriculture applications. Show All In the reviewed articles, authors have used
    around 22 different regression algorithms for prediction, however 5 most commonly
    used algorithms are identified and depicted in the figure 9. Remaining 17 algorithms
    which are used either only for comparison or employed as a support algorithms
    have been classified into others. FIGURE 9. Regression algorithm in precision
    agriculture. Show All DL models have contributed significantly and outperforms
    ML classification algorithms in classification of crop disease and weed as well
    as for livestock diseases identification. Figure 10 shows CNN, ANN and RNN algorithms
    explored in precision agriculture. In the reviewed articles, authors have used
    around 10 different DL/NN algorithms for prediction/classification, however 8
    most commonly used algorithms are identified and depicted in the figure 10. Remaining
    2 (LeNet, and Caffee) algorithms which are used either only for comparison or
    employed as a support algorithms have been classified into others. FIGURE 10.
    Classification algorithm in precision agriculture. Show All A. Performance Comparison
    of ML Algorithms in Precision Agriculture The application of ML and DL algorithms
    highly depends on the agriculture cycle and the dataset involved. This section
    discusses the advantages and limitations of various ML and DL algorithms such
    as regression and classification algorithms based on the agriculture cycle involved.
    1) Soil Properties and Weather Prediction The application of AI techniques in
    prediction of soil parameters and weather is dependent on various factors. The
    researchers generally employ around 3 to 4 algorithms in for prediction and select
    the algorithms which has most accurate prediction and is robust to factors such
    as: noise, non-linearity, outliers etc. the most commonly employed algorithms
    are ELM, RF, SVR, and cubist algorithm. Advantages of using ML in prediction of
    soil properties and weather pattern: Non-linear dataset – these predictions often
    attributes a non-linear dataset which can be utilized for accurate prediction
    by regression algorithms such as: ELM, RF, SVR Large dataset – the dataset for
    is often obtained from satellite which can be well handled by the regression algorithms
    with less convergence time and accurate predictions. Insensitivity to outliers
    – Weather patterns often encounter outlier events which may affect the prediction
    accuracy, however algorithms such as ELM, NN are robust to outliers and provide
    accurate predictions. Accurate prediction – prediction of parameters using ML
    exhibit low error indices such as RMSE, and R2 which are standard measures of
    accuracy for statistical analysis. Challenges and limitations in prediction of
    soil properties and weather pattern: Varying geographical conditions poses a challenge
    for universal design of the prediction algorithms. Soil parameters prediction
    is highly dependent on the sample selection philosophy. Dataset selection and
    filtering is a challenge for researchers with non-computing background. 2) Crop
    Yield Prediction The application of AI techniques in prediction of crop yield
    is a mammoth task and lack of availability of a universal model makes designing
    of the algorithm challenging. The most promising algorithms for crop yield prediction
    are regression algorithms, and neural networks. Advantages of using ML in crop
    yield prediction: Complex dataset – crop yield prediction involves enormous dataset
    composing of satellite data and/or historic data. Faster and accurate predictions
    can be made by utilizing the AI techniques such as regression algorithms (SVR,
    RF) Neural networks (CNN). Parameter variation – the crop yield depends on a lot
    of parameters, like climatic factors, soil quality, NDVI, altitude, air parameters.
    The AI based prediction systems handle the parameters dependency efficiently.
    Accurate prediction – prediction of parameters using ML exhibit low error indices
    such as RMSE, and R2 which are standard measures of accuracy for statistical analysis.
    Challenges and limitations in prediction of crop yield: Varying parameters and
    complex datasets pose a challenge for universal design of the prediction algorithms.
    Dataset selection is critical due to the complexity; as an improper selection
    of data may result in underfit/overfit prediction pattern. 3) Disease and Weed
    Detection The applications of AI techniques in disease and weed detection primarily
    depends on the advances in image processing. CNN’s are the most prominent choice
    for building a disease identification system. Training dataset will govern the
    performance of the algorithm, although these are available in open-source format,
    users have to be cautious while using the dataset. Advantages of using ML in detection
    of weed and disease in a crop field: Prediction accuracy – AI offer accurate detection
    of disease and weeds with an accuracy of 99% which is better compared to manual/classical
    techniques. Robust prediction – the algorithms can predict the disease/weed even
    with smartphone images, which is commonly available with farmers. Easy configuration
    – with CNN being the most common and reliable technique, designing a disease/weed
    detection system is not a complex job unlike other systems discussed in text.
    Challenges and limitations in detection of weed and disease in a crop field: The
    accuracy of prediction depends on the quality of training dataset some of which
    is available as an open-source dataset, but is applicable to only a limited number
    of crops. Improperly labelled data may result in a disastrous prediction system,
    as the training of the system plays a major role in the performance of the system.
    Overtraining the model may result in a sensitive prediction system. 4) Drip Irrigation
    Smart irrigation systems are not only crop friendly but are environmental friendly
    too. The combination of IoT with the AI not only reduces the manual intervention
    but also utilizes the available in an optimum way to ensure no adverse effect
    to environment. Regression and Advantages of using ML in drip irrigation for an
    agricultural field: Optimum resource utilization – accurate estimation of irrigation
    requirements results in a system which optimizes the resource (water, electricity)
    utilization (NN algorithms). Crop protection – optimized irrigation practices
    minimizes water related damage to the crops and hence increases the crop yield.
    Robust to weather variations – an accurately designed AI based (Regression algorithms)
    irrigation system handles the random weather events in a better way when compared
    with the non-AI based irrigation methods. Challenges and limitations in drip irrigation
    for an agricultural field: Accurate prediction sometimes depends on the number
    of sensors and hence increases the initial investment of the farmers. An incorrect
    sensor placement in the filed affects the accuracy of the system, hence sensor
    optimization becomes imperative in designing a smart irrigation system. The architecture
    of prediction system highly depends on the dataset; hence no universal guidelines
    can be laid out for system design. 5) Livestock Production and Management The
    livestock management primarily focuses on the well-being of the farm animals and
    uses advanced image recognition (CNN) algorithms, and regression techniques to
    detect and predict the disease/ disease spread. Advantages of using ML in livestock
    production and management: Decreased risk of diseases – AI systems assists in
    identifying the livestock diseases and also helps in combating the disease, by
    predicting the root of diseases and transmission (Regression algorithms). Minimization
    of disease spread – timely diagnosis and treatment reduces the risk of spreading
    the disease. Psychological analysis – advanced image recognition and behavioural
    analysis (CNN techniques) help is detecting the stress in animals ensuring heath
    of the livestock. Challenges and limitations in drip irrigation for an agricultural
    field: With varying geographic and climatic conditions the attributes of the cattle
    and diseases changes hence, no universal system can be designed to cater to the
    diversities. Some viruses are difficult to predict even using the state-of-art
    prediction algorithms. 6) Intelligent Harvesting The applications of AI techniques
    in harvesting is primarily an assistive technology for automatic harvesting systems.
    Harvesting prediction system largely relies on the advances in image processing
    and CNN’s are the most prominent choice for building these systems. Advantages
    of using ML in intelligent harvesting: Assistive technology – AI in conjunction
    with existing harvesting robots exhibit high accuracy in harvesting. Image processing
    – the identification of harvesting relies on the state-of-art image processing
    algorithm (CNNs) and hence the developments in the image processing algorithms
    result in direct accuracy enhancement of intelligent harvesting techniques. Universal
    algorithms – the AI harvesting techniques largely depend on image recognition
    methods, hence CNNs can easily be deployed for implementing intelligent harvesting
    techniques. Challenges and limitations in intelligent harvesting: The accuracy
    of the prediction systems largely depends on the training dataset, hence accurately
    labelled dataset is a primary requirement of implementing an intelligent harvesting
    system. Inaccurate harvesting recognition system result in economic loss for farmers,
    as a delay in harvesting might lead to an overripe crop or early harvesting might
    lead to rejection of the product. SECTION VII. Challenges and Limitations of Artifical
    Intelligence in Precision Agriculture Artificial intelligence has the potential
    of playing an important role in meeting the food requirement of entire world.
    However, there are certain challenges which are hampering its adoption in agriculture
    industries which are outlined as follows: A recent government survey in India
    estimated that literacy rate of Indian farmers is very low therefore bridging
    the gap between farmers and technology is a challenging task. Farmers are less
    motivated to come out from their comfort zone and learn digital skills to improve
    their farming standards. Agriculture lands are mostly situated in rural areas.
    Implementation of IoT architecture and WSN which requires cloud services for data
    storage and analysis is a big issue in rural areas where reliable internet connectivity
    is not available. Accurate prediction and classification through cognitive ability
    of machines is difficult in varying geographical conditions. Initial set up of
    digital farming which includes hardware and software requires huge investment.
    Deployment of smart sensors and other electronic gadgets requires heavy energy
    consumption. SECTION VIII. Future Trends of Artifical Intelligence and IoT in
    Precision Agriculture Agriculture industry is globally US$5 trillion industry
    and now it has been revolutionized with artificial intelligence and IoT technologies.
    These innovative tools are assisting famers to improve crop yield, monitor soil
    parameters, livestock health and temperature conditions, control pests and improve
    other agriculture related tasks. Conventional ML and DL models such as SVM, RF,
    ANN finds difficult to accurately estimate soil parameters and weather conditions
    in varying ecosystem. Therefore, swarm intelligence optimized robust and adaptive
    ML and DL algorithms such as SVM-PSO, ANN-GWO algorithms can be explored to effectively
    forecast different parameters in precision agriculture. In large agriculture fields
    swarm intelligence inspired autonomous system can be built for crop health and
    growth monitoring. UAV swarm can be utilized for near real time field and livestock
    monitoring through computer vision and DL algorithms and accordingly swarm of
    UAV can be used for spraying of pesticides and fertilizers in the infected crops.
    Greenness of crops can be identified through UAVs installed cameras and an automated
    irrigation system can be built in large agriculture fields. Swarm of mobile robots
    can be used in the agriculture fields to efficiently automate task such as harvesting,
    weed identification and elimination, etc. Metaheuristic algorithms can be explored
    for nodes localization in agriculture fields in order to optimize the sensor deployment
    in the field and keep the minimize cost to farmers. Offline service chatbots can
    be built to assist farmers in developing countries where farmers don’t have good
    internet connectivity. These chatbots can assist farmers by providing timely advice
    based on expert recommendations and will help to resolve their specific farming
    problems. Artificial intelligence assisted renewable energy plants can be installed
    in agriculture lands to maximize the power output of clean energy in unpredictable
    weather conditions. This will allow for sustainable agricultural practices. Artificial
    intelligence can also be explored in vertical and soilless agriculture. In near
    future artificial intelligence systems, robotics and smart sensor technology will
    automate the whole farming process starting from seed sowing to intelligent fruits
    and vegetables harvesting and packaging. SECTION IX. Conclusion Precision agriculture
    is empowering the farmers with technology intending to get optimum outputs with
    precise inputs. IoT enabled smart sensors, actuators, satellite images, robots,
    drones are some of the key technological revolutions that boosted the agriculture
    industry. These components play a vital role in collecting real-time data and
    accordingly making decisions without human support. Artificial intelligence which
    is the automation of intelligent behaviour is continuously benefiting our planet
    and helping humans in various aspects of life. In this paper, authors have reviewed
    ML applications for precision agriculture. The impact of AI and IoT in smart farm
    management is discussed with a brief introduction to ML algorithms which are most
    commonly used in precision agriculture. Regression algorithms are the backbone
    for soil properties, weather, and crop yield prediction. DL algorithms such as
    CNN and ML classification algorithms such as SVM, Decision trees, and RF were
    explored for the identification of disease and weeds in the plants. Smart irrigation
    systems and harvesting techniques play an important component in precision agriculture
    as these techniques quickly complete the work and reduces human labour. Drones
    and robots enabled with a digital camera are employed for this work. Livestock
    management is an important concern for farmers across the world. Knowledge-based
    agriculture system which includes smart IoT devices and AI tools efficiently handle
    livestock management. As a scope of future work, NLP based chatbots can be built
    for famers and more ML, DL and hybrid algorithms can be explored in the agriculture
    industry for sustainable use of available resources. Authors Figures References

    \ water more efﬁciently. Such solutions\ninvolve the development of smart irrigation\
    \ systems where Internet of Things (IoT) nodes are\ndeployed throughout large\
    \ areas. In addition, in the mentioned areas, wireless communications\ncan be\
    \ difﬁcult due to the presence of obstacles and metallic objects that block electromagnetic\n\
    wave propagation totally or partially. This article details the development of\
    \ a smart irrigation\nsystem able to cover large urban areas thanks to the use\
    \ of Low-Power Wide-Area Network\n(LPWAN) sensor nodes based on LoRa and LoRaWAN.\
    \ IoT nodes collect soil temperature/moisture\nand air temperature data, and control\
    \ water supply autonomously, either by making use of fog\ncomputing gateways or\
    \ by relying on remote commands sent from a cloud. Since the selection\nof IoT\
    \ node and gateway locations is essential to have good connectivity and to reduce\
    \ energy\nconsumption, this article uses an in-house 3D-ray launching radio-planning\
    \ tool to determine the best\nlocations in real scenarios. Speciﬁcally, this paper\
    \ provides details on the modeling of a university\ncampus, which includes elements\
    \ like buildings, roads, green areas, or vehicles. In such a scenario,\nsimulations\
    \ and empirical measurements were performed for two different testbeds: a LoRaWAN\n\
    testbed that operates at 868 MHz and a testbed based on LoRa with 433 MHz transceivers.\
    \ All the\nmeasurements agree with the simulation results, showing the impact\
    \ of shadowing effects and\nmaterial features (e.g., permittivity, conductivity)\
    \ in the electromagnetic propagation of near-ground\nand underground LoRaWAN communications.\
    \ Higher RF power levels are observed for 433 MHz\ndue to the higher transmitted\
    \ power level and the lower radio propagation losses, and even in the\nworst gateway\
    \ location, the received power level is higher than the sensitivity threshold\
    \ (−148 dBm).\nRegarding water consumption, the provided estimations indicate\
    \ that the proposed smart irrigation\nsystem is able to reduce roughly 23% of\
    \ the amount of used water just by considering weather\nforecasts. The obtained\
    \ results provide useful guidelines for future smart irrigation developers and\n\

    The lack of water and water-stressed areas are becoming serious problems to many\
    \ places around\nthe world. According to the United Nations (UN), by 2025, water\
    \ scarcity will affect 1.8 billion\npeople and two thirds of the population will\
    \ live under water-stressed conditions [1]. In addition,\nwater demand is expected\
    \ to grow 50% by 2050 due to the increase in the number of people living in\n\
    urban areas. As a consequence, drought is expected to have a widespread short\
    \ and long-term impact\non the everyday life of many people. Together with that,\
    \ climate change is increasing ﬂood risks and\nextreme precipitation events [2].\n\
    To tackle the previous issues, the UN recommends taking actions on three aspects\
    \ [1]:\nthe development of drought monitoring systems, the assessment of the potential\
    \ risks and vulnerabilities,\nand the design of drought risk mitigation strategies.\
    \ The present article deals with the latter by designing,\nimplementing, and validating\
    \ empirically a smart irrigation system that can be deployed in urban and\nsuburban\
    \ scenarios.\nSpeciﬁcally, the irrigation system proposed in this article has\
    \ been deployed on a university\ncampus and makes use of Internet of Things (IoT)\
    \ nodes able to collect environmental data\n(e.g., soil temperature/moisture and\
    \ air temperature) and that can be activated remotely, either through\nmanual\
    \ commands or through intelligent automated actions. In addition, the proposed\
    \ system\novercomes the main communications challenges that arise in urban scenarios\
    \ (e.g., the need for\nlong-range communications, long battery life, or high network\
    \ node capacity) by using Low-Power\nWide-Area Network (LPWAN) transceivers based\
    \ on LoRa and LoRaWAN, a standard that has recently\nattracted a lot of attention\
    \ from industry and academia [3–5].\nThis article also deals with another emerging\
    \ technology that has gained momentum:\nfog computing [6]. Fog computing is a\
    \ type of edge computing [7–9] that allows for extending certain\ncloud computing\
    \ features to the edge of the network through the use of low-power computational\n\
    devices like Single-Board Computers (SBCs). Thus, low-cost fog computing devices\
    \ have proven to be\nable to provide responses to IoT nodes signiﬁcantly faster\
    \ than a cloud [10], besides bringing location\nawareness to such responses (i.e.,\
    \ the responses provided by a fog device to the monitored IoT nodes\ncan be adapted\
    \ and reﬁned depending on their physical location).\nThe optimization of the deployment\
    \ of fog computing gateways and IoT nodes requires carrying\nout radio planning\
    \ tasks. Such tasks are essential for scenarios like the one modeled for this\
    \ paper\n(i.e., an university campus), which are specially challenging in terms\
    \ of radio propagation due to\ntheir large dimensions and the numerous obstacles\
    \ that impact electromagnetic waves. For that\npurpose, empirical models are usually\
    \ employed, which give rapid results but, with high errors,\nsince they are very\
    \ site-speciﬁc. In order to obtain accurate estimations, in this work, an in-house\n\
    developed 3D-Ray Launching (3D-RL) deterministic algorithm has been used to characterize\
    \ the\nLoRa/LoRaWAN radio channel at 868 MHz and 433 MHz. As it will be later\
    \ described in Section 4,\nthe algorithm provides a good trade-off between accuracy\
    \ and computational time. In addition,\nin order to complete the radio planning\
    \ study of the scenario under analysis, and validate the\nobtained simulation\
    \ results, empirical RF measurements were obtained for both 868 MHz and 433 MHz\n\
    frequency bands. Speciﬁcally, the following are the main contributions of this\
    \ article:\nSensors 2020, 20, 6865\n3 of 33\n•\nA comprehensive state-of-the-art\
    \ section is provided on the most relevant academic smart\nirrigation systems\
    \ and on the use of LoRa/LoRaWAN for underground scenarios.\n•\nAn architecture\
    \ is proposed for building novel smart irrigation systems based on the deployment\n\
    of LoRa/LoRaWAN transceivers and fog computing nodes.\n•\nThe implementation of\
    \ the proposed system and its hardware is described in detail so as to allow\n\
    future developers to replicate it easily.\n•\nThe radio planning analysis of the\
    \ scenario (i.e., a university campus) is presented together with\nan empirical\
    \ measurement campaign to corroborate the analytical results.\nThe rest of this\
    \ article is structured as follows. First, Section 2 analyzes the most relevant\
    \ previous\nworks on smart irrigation systems and on the use of LoRa and LoRaWAN\
    \ in underground scenarios.\nSection 3 describes thoroughly the proposed communications\
    \ architecture, the deployment scenario,\nand the implementation of the different\
    \ components of the smart irrigation system. Section 4 provides\ndetails on the\
    \ performed radio analysis: its characteristics, the conﬁguration of the used\
    \ 3D-RL tool,\nand the obtained simulation results. Finally, Section 5 is dedicated\
    \ to the description and analysis of the\nresults obtained during an empirical\
    \ measurement campaign, while Section 6 is devoted to conclusions.\n2. State of\
    \ the Art\n2.1. IoT Smart Irrigation Systems\nIoT has gained in the last few years\
    \ a lot of interest as a key enabler technology in smart\nagriculture [11]. With\
    \ respect to smart irrigation systems, there are a number of recent academic works\n\
    focused on decision planning and operation support. For instance, Khan et al.\
    \ [12] describe a Decision\nSupport System (DSS) that uses Xbee devices to cover\
    \ a relatively small area. Another interesting work\nwas presented by Togneri\
    \ et al. [13], who designed a ﬂexible IoT platform that enables developing\nMachine\
    \ Learning (ML)-based solutions for smart irrigation. Its core components are\
    \ a set of software,\nhardware, and communication technologies (e.g., LoRaWAN)\
    \ that include soil moisture sensor probes,\nthe use of an open-source platform\
    \ (FIWARE), a SPARQL event processing architecture, as well as\nspeciﬁc services\
    \ for irrigation planning and operation. Unfortunately, the mentioned article\
    \ does not\nprovide further details on the communications architecture. Recently,\
    \ Boursianis et al. [14] proposed\na sophisticated smart irrigation system that\
    \ exploits the capabilities of 5G networks and energy\nharvesting. A different\
    \ approach is proposed by Munir et al. [15], which uses an intelligent method\n\
    based on a fuzzy logic to schedule irrigation based on different parameters. Since\
    \ the design of smart\nirrigation systems involves several considerations, Table\
    \ 1 shows an overview of the main aspects\nto be taken into account. A complete\
    \ and detailed overview of the current state-of-the-art regarding\nthe IoT irrigation\
    \ system for precision agriculture is presented in [16]. The authors review in\
    \ detail\ncommon sensors and actuators to develop the IoT irrigation systems,\
    \ most common parameters to be\nmonitored, the type of irrigation, the type of\
    \ node, the type of wireless communication technology,\namong others.\nSensors\

    Among the most popular LPWAN communications technologies (e.g., Sigfox, LoRa/LoRaWAN,\n\
    WavIoT, Random Phase Multiple Access (RPMA), Narrowband IoT (NB-IoT) or LTE-M),\
    \ LoRa and\nLoRaWAN were selected due to their expected communications range and\
    \ performance in scenarios\nwhere signiﬁcant signal attenuation occurs, like is\
    \ the case for underground communications. In fact,\nsome authors already performed\
    \ thorough comparisons among LPWAN technologies and showed that\nRPMA and LTE-M\
    \ incur additional path losses in comparison to Sigfox or LoRAWAN technologies\
    \ [17].\nIn the case of LoRa or LoRaWAN, they use a proprietary Chirp Spread Spectrum\
    \ (CSS) modulation in\nthe PHY layer, but their MAC layer is an open speciﬁcation.\
    \ On the contrary, Sigfox makes use of an\nopen chipset, but its network is closed\
    \ (i.e., it is necessary to pay a periodic fee). Nonetheless, it must\nbe noted\
    \ that there is no fully open LPWAN protocol stack (for PHY and MAC layers).\n\
    To provide coverage for large areas, LoRa/LoRaWAN solutions have been suggested\
    \ for\ndeveloping smart irrigation systems. For example, Gloria et al. [18] describe\
    \ a Wireless Sensor\nNetwork (WSN) controlled by a single gateway (a broker) that\
    \ is in constant communication with\nan online server that uses LoRa peer-to-peer\
    \ connections. Message Queuing Telemetry Transport\n(MQTT) via a WiFi connection\
    \ is used for exchanging messages between the server and the nodes.\nAnother solution\
    \ was presented by Usmonov et al. [19], who detailed a LoRaWAN-based cost-effective\n\
    wireless control system for drip irrigation. Such a solution uses a master station\
    \ to relay packets\nbetween the control application and the deployed end-device\
    \ nodes. It is also worth mentioning the\nwork described in [20], which details\
    \ the design and implementation of a LoRaWAN smart irrigation\nsystem in a typical\
    \ urban environment. In such a work, the authors indicate that the communications\n\
    distance between the irrigation node and the gateway can reach up to 8 km (covering\
    \ an area of up to\n2 km2) and provide energy-consumption results that consider\
    \ different operating modes of the end\nnodes. Note that larger areas could be\
    \ easily covered with LoRa. Finally, it is relevant to mention the\nwork of other\
    \ authors like Citoni et al. [21], who studied the deployment limitations of large-scale\n\
    LoRaWAN IoT applications. Speciﬁcally, such a work analyzed the impact of packet\
    \ collision on the\nscalability of a LoRaWAN deployment.\n2.3. LoRa and LoRaWAN\
    \ in Underground Scenarios\nIn this article, underground scenarios are deﬁned\
    \ as the ones that make use of wireless\ncommunications transceivers to send and\
    \ to receive data from under the soil. Such transceivers have\nto be able to avoid\
    \ the communications issues that arise when operating underground in a number\n\
    of industrial applications, like maintenance [22], mining [23,24], agriculture\
    \ [25,26], or structural\nengineering [27].\nIn underground scenarios, the radio\
    \ signal absorption loss caused by the soil severely affects\nthe performance\
    \ of traditional wireless communications technologies. In particular, factors\
    \ that\naffect signal propagation in underground scenarios are the soil type and\
    \ density, the soil moisture,\nthe existence of certain elements (e.g., plant\
    \ roots, rocks or underground pipelines), and the burial\ndepth [28].\nAlthough\
    \ authors like Akyildiz et al. [29] suggest some interesting preliminary results,\
    \ the existing\nresearch on in-soil underground communications is still not mature.\
    \ For instance, one of the ﬁrst\nempirical studies on the topic was presented\
    \ in 2010 by Silva et al. [30]. In such a work, the authors\ntested ZigBee MICA2\
    \ and MICAz motes in an agriculture ﬁeld.\nTheir results showed a high\nasymmetry\
    \ between underground and above ground communications, being highly dependent\
    \ on\nburial depth and soil moisture (e.g., a 21% increase in water content decreased\
    \ the signal coverage\nby more than 70%). Besides ZigBee, other authors have tested\
    \ in similar scenarios some of the most\npopular traceability technologies like\
    \ Radio Frequency Identiﬁcation (RFID) [31,32] for developing\nunderground applications\
    \ [33,34].\nLoRa and LoRaWAN make use of a chirp spread modulation that offers\
    \ several advantages for\nunderground communications [35]: better coverage than\
    \ technologies like WiFi or ZigBee, a sensitivity\nSensors 2020, 20, 6865\n6 of\
    \ 33\non the order of –130 dBm, low energy consumption, and low cost. There are\
    \ a number of recent papers\nthat study the performance of LoRa/LoRaWAN in underground\
    \ scenarios. For instance, Wan et al. [36]\ndesigned and evaluated a LoRa propagation\
    \ test node. They concluded that, if rainfall and irrigation\nhappen frequently,\
    \ their associated channel losses need to be compensated with increased transmission\n\
    power or with the use of high-gain antennas, the latter being the recommended\
    \ approach. Moreover,\nthe authors provide additional recommendations: with respect\
    \ to the burial depth of the node, it should\nbe as close as possible to the surface\
    \ and, regarding the Packet Success Rate (PSR) of underground\ncommunications,\
    \ a shorter LoRa payload is required for a higher PSR.\nLoRa in-soil propagation\
    \ was also studied by Xue-fen et al. [37], who proposed a smartphone-based\nLoRa\
    \ underground measurement system. Thus, the authors described thoroughly two scenarios\n\
    (a farmland and a garden) that considered the type of soil (e.g., homogeneous\
    \ loam) and plants\n(e.g., mainly rice), the root depth of grass and camphor trees,\
    \ and the characteristics of underground\niron pipelines that are used for municipal\
    \ drainage and communications. They also considered\ntwo different paths: underground-underground\
    \ (UU) and underground-above ground-underground\n(UAU). In their experiments,\
    \ the attenuation of the radio signals in the UU path, which is related\nto the\
    \ soil characteristics and to other underground obstructions, was higher than\
    \ for the UAU\npath. Thus, the actual attenuation in the analyzed environment\
    \ needed to be obtained through\nmeasurements, due to the randomness of the soil\
    \ and the obstructions. Xue-fen et al. also note\nthe negative impact of soil\
    \ moisture on LoRa in-soil propagation considering the precipitation rate,\nthe\
    \ randomness of rainfalls, and the amount of irrigation water in the area for\
    \ the last 12 h. Since the\nwater content in deep soil is usually higher than\
    \ the one of the surface, the packet success rate decreases\nwith deeper burial\
    \ depth. A similar approach was taken in [38], where, after developing an in-soil\n\
    propagation test node, the authors performed measurements and analyses of the\
    \ results in a riverside\npark. In the case of Lin et al. [39], they focused their\
    \ research on an experimental analysis on the\ninﬂuence of various physical layer\
    \ parameters (e.g., spreading factor, coding rate, bandwidth) on\nLoRa’s propagation\
    \ performance.\n2.4. Key Findings\nAfter reviewing the state-of-the art, it can\
    \ be concluded that there are a number of recent articles\nthat make use of LoRa/LoRAWAN\
    \ as preferred wireless technology for IoT smart irrigation systems.\nIn contrast\
    \ to the proposed system, previous research is mainly focused on DSS capabilities\
    \ introducing\nstatistical or ML/AI (Artiﬁcial Intelligence) techniques for decision-making,\
    \ or on the proper irrigation\nsystem design, focused on optimizing hardware capabilities.\
    \ Thus, there is barely any system that proposes\nthe use of fog or edge computing.\
    \ In addition, in relation to radio signal absorption loss in underground\nscenarios,\
    \ most authors recommend performing in-soil wireless propagation measurements\
    \ before the\ndesign, installation, and maintenance of any smart irrigation system,\
    \ but the use of scenario simulators\ntogether with practical deployments has\
    \ been barely documented.\nTable 2 compares the main features of the most relevant\
    \ smart irrigation systems. As it can be\nobserved, in contrast to the compared\
    \ systems, this article presents an IoT LPWAN smart irrigation\nsystem with a\
    \ fog computing-based architecture whose node and gateway locations can be optimized\n\
    for urban areas thanks to the help of an in-house developed 3D-ray launching radio\
    \ planning simulator.\nThe system proposed in this article is based on the use\
    \ of LoRa or LoRaWAN due to their ability\nto provide medium and long-range coverage\
    \ in both indoor and outdoor scenarios, thus ﬁtting into\nthe traditional areas\
    \ where smart irrigation is required. Speciﬁcally, previous literature evaluated\
    \ LoRa\nrange, obtaining up to 30 km for boat communications and 15 km for car\
    \ communications [40], up to\n8 km (but losing many packets) and up to 4 km (losing\
    \ a few packets) within urban environments [41],\nup to 500 m for very dense-vegetation\
    \ environments [42] and a radius coverage of 1.8 km for a soil\nmonitoring system\
    \ in agriculture by means of LoRa devices with worse performance in terms of\n\
    sensitivity than the ones used in this article [43].\nSensors 2020, 20, 6865\n\

    \ smart irrigation\ndeployments: their energy consumption is relative low (RX\
    \ current is usually around 10 mA,\nwhile deep-sleep current is under 200 nA),\
    \ its robustness against interference has been proven [44,45],\ntransceiver cost\
    \ is also low (less than US$ 8, as of writing) and there is no need to pay monthly\
    \ fees to a\nmobile carrier. Nonetheless, developers must note that LoRa and LoRaWAN\
    \ have not been devised to\ntransfer large data payloads fast (the theoretical\
    \ maximum data rate is usually 50 Kbps for LoRa and\n27 Kbps for LoRaWAN) and\
    \ they make use of Industrial-Scientiﬁc-Medical (ISM) bands, so interference\n\
    may arise from other devices that operate in the same radio frequency.\n3. Design\
    \ and Implementation of the System\n3.1. Smart Irrigation Scenario\nBefore describing\
    \ the design and implementation of the proposed smart irrigation system, it is\n\
    ﬁrst necessary to detail the characteristics of the scenario where it is deployed\
    \ in order to understand\nthe choices made. Such a scenario is located in the\
    \ Campus of Elviña, at the University of A Coruña\n(Spain), in an area that covers\
    \ 7500 m2 (with 50 m of width and 150 m of length). The speciﬁc area\nis shown\
    \ in Figure 1 together with the locations of the deployed smart irrigation nodes\
    \ (red circles,\nnumbered 1 through 8) and communication gateways (purple circles,\
    \ numbered 9 to 11).\nSensors 2020, 20, 6865\n8 of 33\n1\n2\n3\n5\n6\n7\n8\n4\n\
    9\n11\n10\nFigure 1. Analyzed scenario with deployed nodes (red circles) and gateway\
    \ locations (purple circles)\n(Map source: ©2020 Google).\nThe area where the\
    \ smart irrigation system was deployed includes elements typically found in\n\
    urban and suburban environments: besides the gardens to be irrigated (composed\
    \ by lawn and diverse\ntypes of trees), there are several buildings, roads, and\
    \ cars. As an example, the pictures in Figure 2 show\nthe areas where smart irrigation\
    \ nodes 1, 3, and 4 were located, and where the mentioned elements\nof the scenario\
    \ can be observed. It is important to note that the size of the scenario and the\
    \ speciﬁc\narea were selected for convenience reasons, as they are close to the\
    \ lab of the researchers, and they are\nrepresentative of the entire campus. In\
    \ such a scenario, gateways and nodes were deployed in an area\nthat is large\
    \ enough to validate the proposed communications architecture and the smart irrigation\n\
    system, but larger areas could be easily covered by adding more LoRaWAN nodes\
    \ and, if needed,\nadditional gateways. Moreover, the scalability provided by\
    \ LoRa for the communication between\nnodes and the gateway can be easily replicated\
    \ by the used 3D-RL simulator, which, once the scenario\nto be simulated is created,\
    \ only requires specifying the desired number of nodes and their location in\n\
    order to obtain simulation results. Nonetheless, it must be emphasized that the\
    \ higher the number of\nnodes, the higher the computational cost/time that will\
    \ be required for the simulations.\nFigure 2. Areas where smart irrigation nodes\
    \ 3 and 4 (left) and 1 (right) were located.\n3.2. Designed Communications Architecture\n\
    Figure 3 shows the communications architecture of the proposed system. In such\
    \ a ﬁgure,\nthe different components are connected through arrows that indicate\
    \ the way communications are\nperformed (e.g., the two-way arrow that connects\
    \ Remote Services with Third-Party Services indicate\nSensors 2020, 20, 6865\n\
    9 of 33\nthat the former make requests to the latter to ask for certain information\
    \ and the latter respond with\nthe requested data). Speciﬁcally, the proposed\
    \ architecture is composed of three layers:\nRemote Users\nIoT Node Layer\nMain\

    Weather Forecast\nFigure 3. Designed communications architecture of the proposed\
    \ system.\n•\nIoT Node Layer. This layer consists of smart irrigation IoT nodes\
    \ that exchange information with\nlocal gateways. The double arrows that communicate\
    \ the IoT Node Layer with the Fog Computing\nLayer in Figure 3 represent bidirectional\
    \ communications, which indicate that remote commands\ncan be sent to the IoT\
    \ nodes, while such nodes can send information about the successful execution\n\
    of the commands (e.g., in order to determine whether the system works properly)\
    \ or on the state\nof their sensors.\n•\nFog Computing Layer. This layer is composed\
    \ by local gateways distributed over different\nlocations to extend network connectivity\
    \ across large areas. Such gateways provide redundancy,\nlow-latency responses\
    \ and distributed processing, thus off-loading tasks from the remote cloud.\n\
    •\nRemote Service Layer. This layer is located in the cloud and collects data\
    \ from the deployed\ncomponents of the smart irrigation system. The collected\
    \ data can be processed and stored on\nthe cloud database in order to be later\
    \ shown to remote users through a user-friendly interface.\nMoreover, the services\
    \ on the cloud can exchange information with useful third-party services\n(e.g.,\
    \ an external weather forecast service).\n3.3. LoRa and LoRaWAN\nThe LoRa physical\
    \ layer operates in the ISM bands (e.g., 868 MHz, 433 MHz, and 915 MHz).\nIn Europe,\
    \ only the 868 MHz and 433 MHz bands can be used. Transmitted power is limited\n\
    Sensors 2020, 20, 6865\n10 of 33\nto 14 dBm Effective Isotropic Radiated Power\
    \ (EIRP) with a 1% duty cycle limit of on-air time.\nLoRa integrates a Forward\
    \ Error Correction (FEC) to increase robustness against noise and burst\ninterference.\n\
    Transmissions can be sent on different spreading factors, and, depending on the\n\
    modulation and transmission power, the link budget can be as high as 155 dB.\n\
    LoRaWAN involves a protocol stack with LoRa as the physical layer. It uses Adaptive\
    \ Data Rate\n(ADR) for managing individual data rates and maximizing the battery\
    \ lifetime of each connected\ndevice. The LoRaWAN network architecture has a star\
    \ topology in which end nodes communicate\nwith gateways which in turn connect\
    \ to network servers. A summary of LoRa/LoRaWAN main\ncharacteristics can be seen\
    \ in Table 3. In addition, the interested reader can obtain further details in\
    \ [46].\nTable 3. LoRa/LoRaWAN main speciﬁcations (Europe).\nParameter\nValue\n\

    \ the proposed system making use of LoRa/LoRaWAN, the three different layers deﬁned\n\
    in Figure 3 were implemented as illustrated in Figure 4. Note that Figures 3 and\
    \ 4 show an identical\nRemote Service Layer, but they differ signiﬁcantly on their\
    \ fog computing layer and on the way\nthey manage IoT nodes. Regarding Figure\
    \ 4, it is worth pointing out that, for the sake of clarity,\nit only refers to\
    \ LoRaWAN, since a LoRa-based architecture would be a subset. The main difference\n\
    between a LoRa-based and a LoRaWAN-based architecture is that LoRa does not need\
    \ a speciﬁc LoRa\nServer, while, in the case of LoRaWAN, such a server is necessary\
    \ to manage different aspects of the\nLoRaWAN network, like its security or certain\
    \ packet management tasks. For such a reason, the rest of\nthis subsection and\
    \ the next would only refer to LoRaWAN. Considering the previous clariﬁcation,\n\
    the layers depicted in Figure 4 were implemented as follows:\n•\nIoT Node Layer.\
    \ This layer is composed of IoT nodes that embed LoRaWAN transceivers, soil\n\
    sensors, and irrigation actuators. The LoRaWAN packets sent by the IoT nodes can\
    \ be collected\nby one or more nearby LoRaWAN gateways.\n•\nFog Computing Layer.\
    \ In this layer, LoRaWAN gateways collect packets from the deployed smart\nirrigation\
    \ nodes and then send them to a central LoRaWAN server, where they are decoded\
    \ and\nprocessed in order to provide fog computing services.\n•\nRemote Service\
    \ Layer. It works as it was previously described in Section 3.2.\nSensors 2020,\

    Node 2\nFigure 4. Implemented communications architecture.\n3.5. Implemented IoT\
    \ Node Layer\nThe implemented LoRaWAN IoT nodes send and receive information using\
    \ the LoRaWAN\nprotocol. Speciﬁcally, the deployed nodes are able to send periodically\
    \ the data collected from their\nsoil temperature/moisture and air temperature\
    \ sensors. In addition, the nodes can receive remote\ncommands to carry out different\
    \ tasks (e.g., to activate the irrigation actuator or to establish the\nwatering\
    \ schedule).\nIt must be noted that LoRaWAN end devices can be divided into three\
    \ classes (A, B, and C)\ndepending on their needs regarding downlink communications\
    \ (i.e., for transmitting data from a\nLoRaWAN gateway to the irrigation nodes)\
    \ [47]. In order to reduce node stand-by power consumption,\nthe smart irrigation\
    \ nodes were chosen to be of class A. Such a class allows the nodes to remain\
    \ asleep\nmost of the time to save power and to receive commands only during a\
    \ short period of time after\nsending data (this fact implies that remote commands\
    \ will not be executed in real time).\nEach IoT node was designed so that different\
    \ sensors can be used. For illustration purposes,\nFigure 5 shows one of the smart\
    \ irrigation IoT nodes disassembled. As it can be observed, each node\nincludes\
    \ interfaces for a DS18820 temperature sensor [48] and an SHT15 temperature and\
    \ moisture\nsensor [49]. In addition, each node provides an interface to connect\
    \ a 12 V-DC solenoid valve (Seafront\nG763hwmgsk) to control water irrigation.\n\
    The IoT node main board is based on a Heltec LoRa 32 V2 [50], which provides WiFi\
    \ connectivity,\nan OLED Display, and an SX1276 LoRa module. Moreover, a Real-Time\
    \ Clock (RTC) was embedded\nSensors 2020, 20, 6865\n12 of 33\nso that the microcontroller\
    \ can take time-accurate actions when the network time is not available\n(i.e.,\
    \ based on the local time indicated by the RTC).\nSHT15 \nSolenoid\nValve \nPower\
    \ \nRegulation \nHeltec LoRa 32 V2\nRTC\nDS18820\nFigure 5. Disassembled smart\
    \ irrigation node and its internal components.\nIt is possible to make use of\
    \ the characteristics of the previously described hardware to determine\nthe performance\
    \ of the system. Speciﬁcally, the characteristics of the selected valve allow\
    \ for estimating\nthat its water ﬂow is about 8 L per minute (a more precise estimation\
    \ could be calculated by embedding\na water ﬂow meter in every IoT node, but this\
    \ will also derive into the development of more expensive\nand power hungry nodes).\
    \ Assuming that the approximate amount of water required by the lawn to\nstay\
    \ green is about 10 L per square meter per day, it is possible to calculate the\
    \ savings yielded by the\nproposed smart irrigation system.\nFor calculating water\
    \ savings, it is necessary to consider that the smart irrigation system can\n\
    irrigate depending on the weather, since the system will not activate the node\
    \ valves if the weather\nforecast indicates that it is going to rain. Thus, if\
    \ the rainfall prediction is higher than 10 L per square\nmeter, it is not necessary\
    \ to irrigate throughout the whole day. On the contrary, if sunny weather\nconditions\
    \ are expected, with high solar radiation and low humidity, water evaporation\
    \ increases and,\nas a consequence, the amount of required irrigation will be\
    \ higher.\nThe proposed system allows, by means of automatic planning systems\
    \ or by manual programming,\nto reduce the amount of water to the minimum necessary\
    \ when weather conditions are adequate and\nto increase it when soil is too dry,\
    \ thus making a more efﬁcient use of water and thus reducing the\nwaste of water\
    \ considerably.\nSpeciﬁcally, considering only weather forecasts and by using\
    \ local forecasts data (provided by\na regional government agency called Meteogalicia\
    \ [51]) to obtain average rainfall over a year in\nthe selected irrigation area,\
    \ it has been estimated that 22.8% water savings would be achieved in\ncomparison\
    \ to a ﬁxed-schedule irrigation system. Such an estimation comes from the results\
    \ shown\nin Figure 6, which depicts the amount of water used throughout a whole\
    \ year (from November 2019\nto November 2020) by the smart irrigation system (red\
    \ line) depending on the amount of rainfall\n(blue line). As an additional example,\
    \ Figure 7 shows a more detailed graph for the month of September\n2020 in order\
    \ to illustrate the difference in water usage depending on weather conditions.\
    \ As it can\nbe clearly observed in Figure 7, the smart irrigation system makes\
    \ use of roughly 10 L per square\nSensors 2020, 20, 6865\n13 of 33\nmeter when\
    \ there is no rain, but such an amount decreases in proportion to the rainfall,\
    \ thus saving a\nsigniﬁcant amount of water.\nFigure 6. Estimated irrigation per\
    \ day during a year when depending on rain forecasts.\nFigure 7. Estimated irrigation\
    \ per day during the month of September 2020 when depending on\nrain forecasts.\n\
    3.6. Implemented Fog Computing and Remote Service Layers\nThe higher layers of\
    \ the architecture depicted in Figure 4 were implemented as follows:\n•\nFog Computing\
    \ Layer. It makes use of a central LoRaWAN server and LoRaWAN gateways\nthat can\
    \ be scattered throughout large areas. The LoRaWAN gateways are based on a regular\n\
    microcontroller (STM32L1), while the LoRaWAN server can be executed on a regular\
    \ PC. When IoT\nnodes need to send data, they send a LoRaWAN packet that will\
    \ be received by the nearest gateway.\nThen, the gateway forwards the packet to\
    \ the LoRaWAN server in the local network, which can\nsend it later to the cloud,\
    \ where all the information from the different LoRaWAN networks is\naggregated.\
    \ The LoRaWAN server is also able to perform local actions based on the received\n\
    information from a speciﬁc area before interacting with the cloud.\nSensors 2020,\
    \ 20, 6865\n14 of 33\n•\nRemote Service Layer. The core of the Remote Service\
    \ Layer manages data collection through\nNode-RED [52].\nIn addition, a MongoDB\
    \ database [53] is used to store the collected data.\nFurthermore, this layer\
    \ is able to make use of third-party services like weather forecasters\n(for deciding\
    \ irrigation schedules), which can be easily integrated with the Remote Service\
    \ Layer\nthrough Representational State Transfer (REST) Application Programming\
    \ Interfaces (APIs).\n3.7. Enabled Applications\nThe proposed smart irrigation\
    \ system provides numerous advantages with respect to traditional\nsystems thanks\
    \ to the intelligent automation of the irrigation process. Speciﬁcally, the following\
    \ are\nsome of the most relevant features of the proposed system that enable the\
    \ development of advanced\nirrigation applications:\n•\nIrrigation scheduling\
    \ can be adjusted dynamically and in a smart way by considering multiple\ninformation\
    \ sources like weather forecasts.\n•\nThe system can adjust dynamically to changing\
    \ environmental conditions, like soil moisture,\nground temperature, or real-time\
    \ weather conditions.\n•\nThe system is able to adjust the irrigation schedule\
    \ dynamically so as to adapt it to the species\nthat are grown on each individual\
    \ green area.\n•\nIn case of having directional irrigators on the IoT nodes, it\
    \ is possible to establish speciﬁc dynamic\nirrigation patterns with the objective\
    \ of watering very speciﬁc areas.\n•\nThe system can be easily scaled (it autonomously\
    \ connects to the nearest gateway), thus being\nable to cover large areas thanks\
    \ to the use of LPWAN technologies.\n•\nIt is straightforward to add additional\
    \ IoT sensor nodes (which do not need to embed irrigation\nactuators, but only\
    \ sensors like rain or leaf moisture sensors) in order to provide accurate data\
    \ on\nthe monitored green areas, thus enhancing the accuracy of the decisions\
    \ made on the irrigation.\n4. Campus Radio Channel Analysis\n4.1. Radio Analysis\
    \ Characteristics\nThis section introduces the radio planning tasks performed\
    \ prior to the deployment of the smart\nirrigation system. Since the considered\
    \ outdoor scenario is especially complex in terms of radio\npropagation, a precise\
    \ analysis of radio wave propagation must be performed.\nThe main factor that\
    \ makes the scenario so challenging is the underground wireless channel,\nwhich\
    \ is a heterogeneous layer of soil, rocks, water, and organic matter, among others.\
    \ Moreover,\nthe underground channel can also vary depending on the location and\
    \ weather conditions. In fact,\nelectromagnetic wave propagation through soil\
    \ and rock has been previously studied extensively for\nground-penetrating radar\
    \ applications [54–56]. However, a comprehensive channel model for the\nunderground\
    \ environment does not exist yet.\nThe main problems that impact communications\
    \ when using electromagnetic waves in an\nunderground environment are the following:\
    \ extreme path loss, reﬂection/refraction, multi-path\nfading, reduced propagation\
    \ velocity, and noise. A detailed description on the impact of these\nphenomena\
    \ in the underground communication can be found in [57].\nIt must be noted that\
    \ electromagnetic wave propagation depends on the dielectric constant of\nmedium\
    \ materials, which, in a smart irrigation scenario, is a heterogeneous mixture\
    \ of air, water,\nand soil. If the porosity of the soil particles is high, propagation\
    \ will be better due to the higher\namount of air present in the medium. On the\
    \ contrary, if the presence of water in the soil is high,\nelectromagnetic propagation\
    \ in the medium will be worse. Thus, particles of sand, clay, and silt of the\n\
    soil impact communications performance. Moreover, node burial depth also impacts\
    \ electromagnetic\npropagation [58,59].\nDue to the previously mentioned issues,\
    \ electromagnetic wave propagation in near-ground\nand underground environments\
    \ is challenging. To tackle them, this work makes use of an in-house\nSensors\
    \ 2020, 20, 6865\n15 of 33\ndeterministic three-dimensional ray launching (3D-RL)\
    \ simulation tool together with an intensive\nmeasurement campaign for characterizing\
    \ the wireless channel within the scenario under analysis.\nThe used algorithm\
    \ is based on Geometrical Optics (GO) and the Uniform Theory of Diffraction\n\
    (UTD), making use of the 3D environment to efﬁciently launch rays from the transmitter\
    \ source.\nThus, the algorithm launches hundreds of rays from the transmitter\
    \ source with a predetermined\nangular separation. Such rays are traced in the\
    \ scenario according to the presence and distribution\nof obstacles. Along their\
    \ trajectory, when they encounter an obstacle, electromagnetic phenomena\nlike\
    \ reﬂection, refraction, and diffraction are considered. The 3D-RL principles\
    \ of operation and\nthe different considered phenomena are represented schematically\
    \ in Figure 8 for a transmitter\nlocated underground.\nFigure 8. Operation principles\
    \ and propagation phenomena of the used 3D-RL algorithm.\nThe used RL technique\
    \ is also referred in the literature as brute-force Ray Tracing (RT),\n‘shooting\
    \ and bouncing rays’ or beam-launching method [60–62]. The technique assumes a\
    \ space\ndiscretization in the simulated scenario, which limits ﬁeld prediction\
    \ accuracy and depends on the\nscenario dimensions. The optimal space discretization\
    \ for different scenarios has been obtained\nby experimental measurements in [63].\
    \ A detailed description of the used 3D-RL algorithm can\nbe found in [64]. Its\
    \ validation has been performed for different applications such as vehicular\n\
    communications [65], smart cities [66], or in homogeneous vegetation environments\
    \ [67]. It is worth\nnoting that, although the employed 3D-RL algorithm has inherent\
    \ constraints which lead to estimation\nerrors, mainly the limitation to create\
    \ the objects present within the scenario by tetrahedrons, and the\nnon-application\
    \ of the scattering effect due to rough surfaces, the obtained simulation results\
    \ are very\naccurate, and, therefore, the approximation valid.\n4.2. 3D-RL Scenario\n\
    Before deploying IoT nodes on a real scenario, it is worth realizing that a smart\
    \ irrigation system\nmay be impacted by certain limitations. First, the position\
    \ of the nodes on the ground depends on\nthe access to water supply and on the\
    \ surface to irrigate. Moreover, the deployment of the LoRaWAN\ngateway can be\
    \ optimized based on radio planning analysis. To contemplate such factors, the\
    \ scenario\nwas modeled in 3D with the 3D-RL tool as it can be observed in Figure\
    \ 9 (this scenario is actually part\nof a larger scenario created and used previously\

    \ locations were virtually placed on the ground on the positions\ndepicted in\
    \ Figure 10, following the deployment structure previously depicted in Figure\
    \ 1. In Figure 10,\nthe red circles represent irrigation node locations, while\
    \ purple circles represent gateway locations.\nEight different irrigation node\
    \ potential locations were analyzed and simulated when exchanging\ndata with a\
    \ gateway that could be positioned into three different locations. Two of the\
    \ gateway\nlocations were outdoors (locations 9 and 10, which have a height of\
    \ 1.8 m), while the other was indoors\n(location 11, at a height of 5.5 m). The\
    \ outdoor locations were chosen by considering aspects such as\nease of installation\
    \ (e.g., access to electrical power) and the existence of line of sight with respect\
    \ to\nmost of the deployed IoT nodes and to the surrounding buildings. The gateway\
    \ indoor location was\nselected to be inside one speciﬁc building due to its challenging\
    \ outside enclosure (such a building can\nbe observed on the picture on the left\
    \ of Figure 2), which is covered by an external metal mesh that\nacts as a sort\
    \ of Faraday cage, thus blocking electromagnetic waves partially.\nFigure 10.\
    \ Schematic upper view of the deployment of the irrigation nodes and the gateways.\n\
    Since the 3D-RL tool provides the RF power distribution for the whole volume of\
    \ the scenario, it is\npossible to optimize node and gateway deployment locations.\
    \ Considering that the developed smart\nirrigation nodes provide a sensitivity\
    \ of –148 dBm (both for 433 MHz and 868 MHz), deterministic\nestimations of the\
    \ received RF power level at each gateway position can be obtained. Thus, the\
    \ validity\nof the proposed locations can be inferred.\nBefore showing the obtained\
    \ simulation results, it is important to mention that the created scenario\nwas\
    \ previously validated by means of empirical results obtained during a measurement\
    \ campaign [4].\nSensors 2020, 20, 6865\n18 of 33\nThe obtained results showed\
    \ a very good agreement between measurements and 3D-RL estimations,\nobtaining\
    \ a mean error of 0.53 dB and a standard deviation of 3.39 dB.\nThe results obtained\
    \ for the 868 MHz and 433 MHz transceivers are presented in Figures 11\nand 12,\
    \ respectively. Speciﬁcally, such ﬁgures show bi-dimensional planes of the RF\
    \ power distribution\nestimations for all the eight smart irrigation nodes at\
    \ the ground level. As expected, 433 MHz\npropagation is better in the same conditions.\
    \ This is due to the higher transmitted power and to its\nlower radio propagation\
    \ losses in comparison to the higher 868 MHz frequency.\nFigure 11. 868 MHz simulation\
    \ results: RF power level distribution in a bi-dimensional plane on the\nground\
    \ level.\nSensors 2020, 20, 6865\n19 of 33\nFigure 12. 433 MHz simulation results:\
    \ RF power level distribution in a bi-dimensional plane on the\nground level.\n\
    When the gateway is located at position 9, irrigation nodes 2 and 8 obtain their\
    \ worst results due\nto the shadowing created by the building. Even in such a\
    \ situation, due to the low sensitivity values\nof both 433 and 868 MHz devices,\
    \ the received power level is higher than the sensitivity threshold\n(−148 dBm).\
    \ This fact was corroborated during the empirical measurement campaign (described\
    \ later\nin Section 5).\nIn the case of placing the gateway into position 10,\
    \ the worst results are clearly obtained by\nirrigation node 2, again due to the\
    \ shadowing created by the building. Like in the previous case,\nthe low sensitivity\
    \ of LoRaWAN devices facilitates wireless communications also in cases when the\n\
    shadowing effect due to buildings absorbs a great amount of energy of the propagated\
    \ wave.\nThe third analyzed gateway location corresponds to position 11, which\
    \ is inside the building,\nat a height of 5.5 m from the street ground level.\
    \ Figures 13 and 14 show estimations of the RF power\nlevel distribution at a\
    \ height of 5.5 m for 868 MHz (Figure 13) and 433 MHz (Figure 14) transceivers\n\
    Sensors 2020, 20, 6865\n20 of 33\n(note that, for this simulation, the irrigation\
    \ nodes remained on the ground). Like in the previous\nsimulations, higher RF\
    \ power levels are observed for 433 MHz due to the higher transmitted power\n\
    level and the lower radio propagation losses. However, in comparison to the results\
    \ obtained for\ngateway positions 9 and 10, the results obtained in position 11\
    \ are worse. As it can be observed,\nposition 11 is inside blue areas or next\
    \ to them. This means that the received RF power is signiﬁcantly\nlower in comparison\
    \ to the other two gateway positions, which, in some cases, can lead to packet\n\
    losses and even to a wireless communication outage. This behavior is conﬁrmed\
    \ by the empirical\nmeasurements presented in the next section.\nFigure 13. 3D-RL\

    \ was carried out to validate the simulation results detailed in\nthe previous\
    \ section and to determine node performance on the selected scenario. Thus, signal\
    \ strength\nmeasurements from LoRa and LoRaWAN IoT nodes were collected by gateways\
    \ when exchanging\ndata from different potential locations. The next subsections\

    \ and analyze the obtained results comparing them with the\nones obtained by the\
    \ 3D-RL tool.\nSensors 2020, 20, 6865\n22 of 33\n5.1. LoRa/LoRaWAN Smart Irrigation\
    \ Testbeds\nIn order to determine the performance of LoRa and LoRaWAN for the\
    \ deployment of smart\nirrigation IoT nodes, two different testbeds were created:\
    \ one based on LoRaWAN that works at\n868 MHz and another one that uses LoRa at\
    \ 433 MHz.\nFigure 15 shows an 868 MHz LoRaWAN-based IoT node and its components.\
    \ Speciﬁcally, the\nnode is based on a WisTrio RAK5205 LPWAN tracker, which makes\
    \ use of a Semtech SX1276 LoRa\ntransceiver and an STM32L1 microcontroller. The\
    \ main speciﬁcations of the node are indicated in\nTable 6. Regarding the 433\
    \ MHz node, it is based on a Heltec LoRa 32 v1 board (as it can be observed\n\
    in Figure 16) and its main speciﬁcations are detailed in Table 7.\nFigure 15.\

    \ that the RAK5205 board comes with a built-in GPS and different environmental\
    \ sensors,\nwhile the used 433 MHz LoRa board uses an ESP32 as a main controller,\
    \ which also embeds WiFi and\nBluetooth transceivers.\nFinally, with respect to\
    \ the gateways of the testbeds, whose main characteristics are summarized\nin\
    \ Table 8, they make use of the following hardware:\nSensors 2020, 20, 6865\n\

    \ Tests\nThe tests consisted of transmitting packets from every IoT node outdoor\
    \ location to the respective\ngateway (depending on the link quality, between\
    \ none and roughly 60 packets were received). It is\nimportant to note that, since\
    \ different protocols were used for each testbed, the considerations for\nmeasuring\
    \ their performance and signal strength differ slightly:\n•\nLoRaWAN is more complex\
    \ than LoRa. By default, most LoRaWAN transceivers make use of an\nadaptive algorithm\
    \ (Adaptative Data Rate, ADR) when transmitting, which implies that their\nspreading\
    \ factor and transmission power are adjusted dynamically. In the performed tests,\
    \ it was\nobserved that, after the transmission of the ﬁrst packet, the spreading\
    \ factor was adjusted to a\nvalue that remained static for the rest of the transmissions.\
    \ Likewise, there were no variations in\nthe power level, which was always set\
    \ in level 1, which implies a transmission power of 14 dBm.\n•\nIn the case of\
    \ LoRa, the ADR algorithm is not executed, so spreading factor and transmit power\n\
    values remain static and thus independent from the communications conditions.\
    \ During the tests,\nthe maximum allowed transmission power for the EU433 band\
    \ was used, which corresponds to a\nspreading factor of 12 and a power transmission\
    \ of 20 dBm.\nRegarding the measurement locations, they were the ones analyzed\
    \ with the 3D-RL simulator and\ndepicted in Figure 1. For every IoT node position,\
    \ the node was placed on the ground or underground\n(at a burial depth of roughly\
    \ 10 cm; one of the moments of the burying process is illustrated in Figure 17)\n\
    depending on the experiment. Regarding the gateway, during the measurements in\
    \ position 11,\nthe gateway was located indoors, next to a window at a 5.5-meter\
    \ height above the ground level. In the\ncase of positions 9 and 10, the gateway\
    \ was outdoors and its antenna was placed in a tripod, as it is\nshown in Figure\
    \ 18.\nAt every measurement location, the Received Signal Strength Indicator (RSSI)\
    \ values were\ncollected for the node-to-gateway communications. It is important\
    \ to note that RSSI depends on\ndiverse factors [69], so the results and conclusions\
    \ presented in the next section cannot be extrapolated\ndirectly to other scenarios\
    \ and, therefore, they should be considered as an example of the validation of\n\
    the appropriateness of the proposed smart irrigation system design approach and\
    \ on the usefulness of\nperforming simulations with the used 3D-RL tool prior\
    \ to a real hardware deployment.\nSensors 2020, 20, 6865\n25 of 33\nFigure 17.\
    \ Deployment of one of the smart irrigation nodes.\nFigure 18. Location of the\
    \ gateway antenna during the experiments at position 9.\n5.3. Results\nThe measurement\
    \ campaign provided a lot of information regarding the performance on the\nwireless\
    \ link for all the eight irrigation nodes and the three gateway potential positions.\
    \ Figure 19\nshows a summary of the results obtained with an operating frequency\
    \ of 868 MHz, for both the\nnear-ground (i.e., on the ground) and underground\
    \ locations of the irrigation nodes. The same\nkind of measurements but for the\
    \ 433 MHz nodes are shown in Figure 20. As it can be observed,\nwhen an irrigation\
    \ node is underground, the RSSI measured by the gateways is generally lower,\n\
    which is expected due to the losses of the ground. Nonetheless, in most cases,\
    \ the difference between\nSensors 2020, 20, 6865\n26 of 33\nnear-ground and underground\
    \ transmissions is not critical, due to the burial depth of the underground\n\
    nodes (10 cm). It is worth noting that, when the gateway was located at position\
    \ 11 (i.e., inside the\nbuilding), it collected the lowest RSSI levels from all\
    \ the irrigation nodes. Moreover, it is the only\ngateway position where some\
    \ packets were lost (in fact, no packets were received from irrigation\nnodes\
    \ 1, 2, and 3), showing the worst performance of all gateway positions. Thus,\
    \ the obtained results\nagree with the estimations obtained by the 3D-RL algorithm\
    \ and previously described in Section 4.3.\nIn order to gain insight into the\
    \ obtained measurements, Figure 21 presents, as an example,\nthe RSSI received\
    \ at the three potential gateway locations for each 868 MHz irrigation node position\n\
    for the near-ground case. Again, it can be observed how the signal sent by irrigation\
    \ nodes 1, 2, and 3\ndoes not reach successfully the gateway when it is located\
    \ at position 11. Moreover, the RSSI received\nby the gateway at position 11 is\
    \ the lowest of all the cases.\nFigure 19. Summary of the measurements at 868\
    \ MHz.\nSensors 2020, 20, 6865\n27 of 33\nFigure 20. Summary of the measurements\
    \ at 433 MHz.\nRegarding positions 9 and 10, the RSSI collected by the gateways\
    \ depends on the distance\nbetween them and the speciﬁc transmitting irrigation\
    \ node, as well as on the presence of obstacles\nlike buildings or cars (as previously\
    \ depicted and modeled in Figure 10). For example, for irrigation\nnode 8, the\
    \ gateway in location 10 received much better quality signal than the one in location\
    \ 9\ndue to the shorter distance and also the shadowing effect caused by the near-by\
    \ building. On the\ncontrary, in the case of irrigation node 6, the gateway at\
    \ location 9 received better signal levels than the\none at 10, even despite location\
    \ 9 being further from the irrigation node. This effect was due to the\nfact that\
    \ several vehicles (which are mainly metallic) were parked between node 6 and\
    \ location 10,\nthus blocking partially radio waves and leading to higher RF losses.\n\
    All the measurements agree with the simulation results presented in Section 4.3,\
    \ both at 433 MHz\nand 868 MHz, and lead to the same conclusions: position 11\
    \ is the worst position for placing the\ncommunications gateway. On the other\
    \ hand, locations 9 and 10 present different performance in terms\nof RSSI depending\
    \ on the irrigation node positions, but in both cases the performance in terms\
    \ of lost\npackets is the same (zero packets were lost for near-ground and underground\
    \ nodes, both for 433 MHz\nand 868 MHz), so such positions are valid for the proposed\
    \ application. In any case, if larger areas\nSensors 2020, 20, 6865\n28 of 33\n\
    were monitored and controlled by irrigation nodes, the better radio propagation\
    \ achieved at 433 MHz\ncould lead to the use of such nodes instead of the ones\
    \ that operate at 868 MHz. Furthermore, once the\n3D-RL simulator has been validated,\
    \ new RF power distribution estimations could be obtained in\norder to assess\
    \ the impact of transmitting with lower power levels (for energy saving), which\
    \ will\nimpact the RSSI and, therefore, the possibility of losing packets due\
    \ to Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR) and\nto the sensitivity threshold of the devices.\
    \ In the same way, new gateway and irrigation node positions\ncould be easily\
    \ analyzed without the necessity of new extensive measurement campaigns.\nFigure\

    \ that operate at\n868 MHz.\nSensors 2020, 20, 6865\n29 of 33\n6. Conclusions\n\
    This article proposed a smart irrigation system based on LoRa/LoRaWAN IoT nodes\
    \ and gateways\nwith a novel communications architecture able to exchange data\
    \ with local fog computing nodes and\nwith a remote cloud in a campus scenario.\
    \ The prototype of the proposed IoT system was developed\nand described in detail\
    \ so as to allow future developers to replicate it easily. In order to validate\
    \ the\nproposed system and assess the potential locations for the nodes to be\
    \ deployed, an in-house 3D-ray\nlaunching radio-planning tool was used in conjunction\
    \ with an accurate 3D model of the simulated\nscenario (a university campus).\
    \ In such a scenario, simulations and empirical measurements were\ncarried out\
    \ for 433 MHz LoRa-based and 868 MHz LoRaWAN-based testbeds. The obtained results\n\
    validate the accuracy of the used radio planning tool (the results obtained in\
    \ this scenario showed a\nvery good agreement between measurements and 3D-RL estimations,\
    \ obtaining a mean error of 0.53 dB\nand a standard deviation of 3.39 dB), which\
    \ allows for estimating the RF power level distribution of the\ninvolved nodes\
    \ and gateways for the whole volume of the scenario. Thus, the potential coverage\
    \ of the\ndifferent areas can be identiﬁed prior their deployment. The obtained\
    \ radio propagation results also\nremark, on one hand, the negative effect that\
    \ some architectural elements of a building (such as the\nmetallic facade in this\
    \ case) may have in terms of radio propagation, and, on the other hand, that the\n\
    impact of underground communications in signal attenuation may not be critical\
    \ if the burial depth is\nshallow (10 cm in this case). The conclusions obtained\
    \ show that the proposed tool provides useful\nguidelines for future developers\
    \ on the design of smart irrigation systems in similar large scenarios.\nFurther\
    \ work will add additional intelligence (e.g., predictive models with AI to ﬁne-grained\
    \ the\namount of water) to the IoT nodes layer and will study in depth the effect\
    \ of burial depth in LoRaWAN\nunderground wireless channels.\nAuthor Contributions:\

    Abstract: Smart farming is a development that has emphasized information and communication

    technology used in machinery, equipment, and sensors in network-based hi-tech
    farm supervision

    cycles. Innovative technologies, the Internet of Things (IoT), and cloud computing
    are anticipated

    to inspire growth and initiate the use of robots and artiﬁcial intelligence in
    farming. Such ground-

    breaking deviations are unsettling current agriculture approaches, while also
    presenting a range of

    challenges. This paper investigates the tools and equipment used in applications
    of wireless sensors

    in IoT agriculture, and the anticipated challenges faced when merging technology
    with conventional

    farming activities. Furthermore, this technical knowledge is helpful to growers
    during crop periods

    from sowing to harvest; and applications in both packing and transport are also
    investigated.

    Keywords: crop management; sustainable agriculture; smart farming; internet-of-things

    agriculture practices; issues and problems

    1. Introduction

    Sustainable agriculture is a measure of the endurance and sustenance of food grains

    produced in an eco-friendly manner [1]. Sustainable agriculture helps in the encourage-

    ment of farming practices and approaches to help sustain farmers and resources.
    It is

    economically feasible and maintains soil quality, reduces soil degradation, saves
    water

    resources, improves land biodiversity, and ensures a natural and healthy environment
    [2].

    Sustainable agriculture plays a signiﬁcant role in preserving natural resources,
    halting

    biodiversity loss, and reducing greenhouse gas emissions [3].

    Sustainable agriculture farming is a method of preserving nature without compromis-

    ing the future generation’s basic needs, whilst also improving the effectiveness
    of farming.

    The basic accomplishments of smart farming in terms of sustainable agriculture
    are crop ro-

    tation, the control of nutrient deﬁciency in crops, the control of pests and diseases,
    recycling,

    and water harvesting, leading to an overall safer environment. Living organisms
    depend

    on the nature of biodiversity, and are contaminated by waste emissions, the use
    of fertilizers

    and pesticides, degraded dead plants, etc. The emission of greenhouse gases affects
    plants,

    animals, humans, and the environment; hence, it necessitates a better environment
    for

    living things [4] (Figure 1).

    Agriculture is the largest contributor in India, with an 18% gross domestic product

    involving approximately 57% of people in rural areas. Over the years, although
    India’s

    total agronomic output has increased, the number of growers has fallen from 71.9%
    in 1951

    to 45.1% in 2011 [5]. The Economic Survey 2018 revealed that the number of agricultural

    workers in the total workforce will drop to 25.7% in 2050. In rural areas, farming
    families

    gradually lose the next generation of farmers, overwhelmed by higher costs of
    cultivation,

    low per capita productivity, inadequate soil maintenance, and migrations to a
    non-farming

    or higher remunerative occupation. Presently, the world is on the verge of a digital

    revolution, and so it is the appropriate time to connect the agricultural landform
    with

    wireless technology to introduce and accommodate digital connectivity with farmers.

    Figure 1. Factors of sustainable agriculture.

    Regrettably, not all parts of the Earth’s surface are suitable for agriculture
    due to

    various restrictions, such as: soil quality, topography, temperature, climate,
    and most

    relevant cultivable areas are also not homogenous [6]. Further, existing farming
    land is

    fragmented by political and ﬁscal features, and rapid urbanization, which consistently

    increases pressure on arable land availability (Figure 2). Recently, total agricultural
    land

    used for food production has declined [7]. Furthermore, every crop ﬁeld has different

    critical characteristics, such as soil type, ﬂow of irrigation, presence of nutrients,
    and pest

    resistance, which are all measured separately both in quality and quantity regarding
    a

    speciﬁc crop. Both spatial and temporal differences are necessary for optimizing
    crop

    production in the same ﬁeld by crop rotation and an annual crop growth development

    cycle [8].

    Figure 2. Key issues of technology in the agriculture industry.

    In most cases, variations in characteristics occur within a single crop, or the
    same

    crop is grown on the whole farm and requires site-speciﬁc analyses for optimum
    yield

    production. New technology-based approaches are needed to produce more from less
    land,

    and to address these various issues. In traditional farming practices, farmers
    frequently

    Agriculture 2022, 12, 1745

    3 of 26

    visit their ﬁelds throughout the crop’s life in routine farming activities to
    better understand

    the crop conditions [9]. The current sensor and communication technologies offer
    an precise

    view of the ﬁeld, from which farmers can detect ongoing ﬁeld activities without
    being in

    the ﬁeld in person. Wireless sensors monitor the crops with higher accuracy and
    detect

    issues at early stages, often facilitating the use of smart tools from initial
    sowing to the

    harvest of crops [10].

    The timely use of sensors has made the entire farming operation smart and cost-

    effective, due to precise monitoring. The various autonomous harvesters, robotic
    weeders,

    and drones have sensors attached to collect data over short intervals. However,
    the vastness

    of agriculture puts extreme demands on technological solutions for sustainability
    with

    minimum ecological impact. Sensor technology through wireless communication helps

    farmers to know the various needs and requirements of crops without being in the
    ﬁelds,

    and they are then able to take remote action [11].

    2. Smart Farming

    Historically, ancient agriculture practices were related to the production of
    food in

    cultivated lands for the survival of humans and the breeding of animals [12],
    and was

    called the traditional agricultural era 1.0. This mainly resorted to using manpower
    and

    animals. Simple tools were used for farming activities, such as sickles and shovels.
    Work

    was mainly conducted through manual labor, and subsequently, productivity continued
    at

    a low level (Figure 3).

    Figure 3. Agricultural decision support system framework.

    During the 19th Century, new types of machinery appeared in the agricultural indus-

    tries, in the form of steam engines. The wide use of agricultural machinery and
    abundant

    chemicals by farmers signaled the start of the agricultural era 2.0, and outwardly
    improved

    effectiveness and productivity of farmers and farms. However, considerably harmful
    impli-

    cations, such as chemical pollution, environmental devastation, waste of natural
    resources,

    and excess utilization of energy, simultaneously developed.

    The agricultural era 3.0 emerged during the 20th Century, due to the rapid growth
    of

    computation and electronics. Robotic techniques, programed agricultural machinery,
    and

    other technologies enhanced the agricultural processes efﬁciently. The issues
    that had arisen

    during agricultural era 2.0 were solved, and policies were readapted to the agricultural
    era

    Agriculture 2022, 12, 1745

    4 of 26

    3.0 through work distribution, precise irrigation, the reduced use of chemicals,
    site-speciﬁc

    nutrient application, and efﬁcient pest control technologies, etc.

    The next agricultural era is also the current iteration of agriculture, the agricultural

    era 4.0, involving the engagement of recent technologies, such as the Internet
    of Things, big

    data analysis, artiﬁcial intelligence, cloud computing and remote sensing, etc.
    The adop-

    tion of new technologies has signiﬁcantly improved agricultural activities by
    developing

    low-cost sensor and network platforms, aimed towards the optimization of production

    efﬁciency, along with reductions in the usage of water resources and energy with
    minimum

    environmental effects [13]. Big data in smart farming provides extrapolative overviews
    of

    real-time agricultural situations, allowing farmers to make effective decisions
    [14]. Real-

    time programming is developed with artiﬁcial intelligence concepts and embedded
    in IoT

    devices, helping farmers make the most suitable decisions [15].

    Smart farming promotes precision agriculture with modern, sophisticated technology

    and enables farmers to remotely monitor the plants. Smart farming helps agricultural
    pro-

    cesses, such as harvesting and crop yields, as the automation of sensors and machinery
    has

    made the farming workforce more efﬁcient [16]. The technologies convert traditional
    farm-

    ing methods to automatic devices, causing a technological revolution in agriculture.
    Today,

    the technology in agriculture has altered the way farming is conducted, and conventional

    techniques have been transformed by the Internet of Things [17].

    In terms of optimizing farm labor requirements and increasing the quantity and

    quality of products, smart farming is an emerging modern technique implemented
    with

    information and communication technologies (ICT) [16]. Modern ICT technologies,
    such

    as the Internet of Things, GPS (Global Positioning Systems), sensors, robotics,
    drones,

    precision equipment, actuators, and data analytics, are used to identify the farmers’
    needs

    and select suitable solutions to their problems. These innovations increase the
    accuracy

    and timeliness of decisions taken, and improve crop productivity. Several multilateral

    organizations and developing countries around the world have proposed smart farming

    technologies to increase agricultural output [18].

    Sensors are constantly monitoring crops with greater accuracy, detecting any undesir-

    able conditions during the early stages of the crop’s lifecycle. Current farming
    incorporates

    smart tools from crop sowing to harvest, storing, and conveyance. The appropriate
    use of a

    wide variety of sensors has made the entire operation both more efﬁcient and proﬁtable,

    due to its accurate monitoring competencies. In addition, sensors that collect
    data quickly

    are directly available online for further evaluation, and they provide crop and
    site-speciﬁc

    agriculture for every site.

    The many issues related to crop production are addressed by smart agriculture
    and

    monitoring, particularly regarding changes in soil characteristics, climate factors,
    soil mois-

    ture, etc., to improve the spatial management practices that increase crop production
    and

    avoid the excess use of fertilizers and pesticides [19]. The ANN models in smart
    irrigation

    water management (SIWM) regulate irrigation scheduling support systems (DSS) and
    offer

    data on irrigation efﬁciency, water productivity index, and irrigation water demand
    and

    supply on a real-time basis. Climate-smart agriculture (CSA) is an upcoming technology,

    especially in developing countries, due to its potential to improve food security,
    farm

    system resilience, and lower greenhouse gas emissions [20]. Smart agriculture
    technology

    based on IoT technologies has many advantages in all agricultural processes and
    practices

    in real-time, including irrigation, plant protection, improving product quality,
    fertilization,

    disease prediction, etc. [21]. The beneﬁt of smart agriculture lies in its collection
    of real-time

    data on crops, the precise assessment of soil and crops, remote monitoring by
    farmers,

    supervising water and other natural resources, and improving livestock and agricultural

    production. Therefore, smart agriculture is considered to be the progression of
    precision

    agriculture through modernization and smart methods to attain various information
    of

    farm activities that are then remotely managed, and reinforced by suitable alternative

    real-time farm maintenance solutions.

    3. Internet of Things

    The Internet of Things (IoT) is a new technology that allows devices to connect

    remotely to achieve smart farming [22]. The IoT has begun to inﬂuence a vast range

    of industries, from health, trade, communications, energy and agriculture, to
    enhance

    efﬁciency and performance across all markets [23–25].

    Current applications provide information on the IoT’s effects, and its practices
    that are

    yet to be observed. However, by considering the advancement of technologies, one
    can

    envisage the IoT technologies perform a crucial role in numerous activities of
    farming, such

    as the utilization of communication infrastructure, data acquisition, smart objects,
    sensors,

    mobile devices, cloud-based intelligent information, decision-making, and the
    automation

    of agricultural operations (Figure 4).

    Figure 4. Barriers in the implementation of smart agriculture technology.

    The IoT technology monitors plants and animals and remotely retrieves information

    from mobile phones and devices. Sensors and instruments empower farmers to assess

    the weather and to anticipate production levels. The IoT plays a role in water
    harvesting,

    monitoring and controlling the ﬂow amount, assessing crops’ water requirements,
    time of

    supply, and the saving of water, more than ever before [26]. Sensors and cloud
    connectivity

    through the gateway can remotely monitor the status and water supply based on
    soil

    and plant needs [27]. To correct nutrient deﬁciencies, pests, and diseases, farmers
    cannot

    monitor and observe every plant manually, but IoT technology is still beneﬁcial
    and has

    led farmers to a new milestone in modern agriculture [28].

    Recently, the development of IoT technologies has played a major role throughout
    the

    farming sector, particularly through its communication infrastructure. This has
    included

    connecting smart objects, remote data acquisition, using vehicles and sensors
    through

    mobile devices and the internet, cloud-based intelligent analysis, interfacing,
    decision

    formation, and the automation of agricultural operations. These proﬁciencies have
    revo-

    lutionized the agriculture industry in terms of resource optimization, controlling
    climate

    effects, and improving crop yields.

    Researchers have proposed different methods, architectures, and various equipment
    to

    monitor and convey crop information at different growth stages, based on several
    crop and

    ﬁeld types. Many manufacturers provide communication devices, multiple sensors,
    robots,

    heavy machinery, and drones to collect and then distribute data. Food and agriculture

    organizations, along with other government organizations, develop guidelines and
    policies

    for regulating the use of technologies to preserve food and environment safety
    [29,30].

    Fundamentals of IoT Applications in Agriculture

    The accessible, inexpensive and interactive tracking platform provides consolidated

    information on traditional agricultural methods, techniques, implements, crop
    pests and

    diseases, etc., collected from various sources for sustainable agriculture. Interactive
    agricul-

    ture allows easy access to the data by users through multiple devices, such as
    computers

    and mobile phones [31].

    1.

    Robust Models: The distinctive features of the agriculture sector are diversity,
    com-

    plexity, spatio-temporal variability, and uncertainties of the right types of
    harvests

    and facilities.

    2.

    Scalability: The variation in farm size from smaller to larger; hence, the results
    should

    be scalable. The placement and testing planning should be progressively scaled
    up

    with fewer expenses.

    3.

    Affordability: Affordability is vital to farming achievement, and therefore price
    should

    be suitable with signiﬁcant assistance. Standardized platforms, products, tools,
    and

    facilities could obtain a satisfactory price.

    4.

    Sustainability: The problem of sustainability is a vital issue due to strong economic

    pressure and intense competition worldwide.

    4. Technologies Used in Smart Farming

    4.1. Global Positioning System (GPS)

    GPS accurately records latitude, longitude, and elevation information [32]. Global

    Positioning System satellites transmit signals and permit GPS receivers to compute
    their

    location in real-time, and provide continuous positions while moving. The exact
    location

    information offers farmers the opportunity to discover the precise position of
    ﬁeld data,

    such as pest occurrence, type of soil, weeds, and other barriers. The system facilitates
    the

    recognition of various ﬁeld locations in order to then apply the necessary inputs
    (seed,

    fertilizer, herbicide, pesticide, and water) to a particular ﬁeld [33].

    4.2. Sensor Technologies

    Technics, such as photo electricity, electromagnetics, conductivity, and ultrasound,
    are

    used to estimate soil texture and structure, nutrient level, vegetation, humidity,
    vapor, air,

    temperature, etc. Remote sensing data can differentiate between crop types, categorize

    pests and weeds, locate stress in soil and plant conditions, and monitor drought
    [34].

    Plant health is affected by many factors, such as soil moisture, nutrient availability,

    exposure to light, humidity, the amount of rainfall, the color of leaves, etc.
    The plants are

    monitored by maintaining the optimum temperature and light intensity, and conserving

    water and energy through micro-irrigation. Different sensors are used to detect
    many

    parameters. If they cross a threshold, the sensor senses the changes and transmits
    them

    to the microcontroller to perform the required actions until the parameter returns
    to its

    optimum level [1].

    The temperature, humidity, soil pattern monitoring, airﬂow sensor, location, CO2,

    pressure, light, and moisture sensors are generally used in sensing technologies.
    Prominent

    sensor characteristics include reliability, memory, portability, durability, coverage,
    and

    computational efﬁciency, and make them suitable for agriculture [35]. Currently
    available

    wireless sensors play a vital role in collecting data on crop conditions and providing
    other

    information. These sensors are standalone types and can be integrated with advanced

    agricultural tools and heavy machinery, based on application necessities.

    The major sensor types with their corresponding working procedure and purpose
    are

    represented in Table 1.

    [57].

    Agriculture 2022, 12, 1745

    4.3. Variable-Rate of Technology (VRT) and Grid Soil Sampling

    Variable-rate technologies (VRT) are used in farming to predict the delivery rate
    of

    inputs based on a predetermined map extrapolated from GIS for the placement of
    inputs at

    variable amounts in the right place and at the right time [16,33]. Grid soil sampling
    is soil

    collection from a systematic grid to establish a map for every parameter. These
    maps are

    the basis for VRT and are loaded into a variable-rate applicator. The computer
    and GPS

    receiver direct and control the changes in the delivery amount or fertilizer product,
    based

    on map features [58,59].

    New technologies, such as variable rate technology and associated practices (grid
    soil

    sampling), potentially improve soil fertility management and assess the spatial
    distribution

    of nutrients and yields [60]. In grid sampling, samples are collected from sampled
    sections

    based on the subdivision of a ﬁeld into small areas, or cells, by superimposing
    the grid

    lines onto the ﬁeld. Composite samples represent an entire area of each much smaller
    area

    (grid-point sampling) at the intersections of grid lines. Soil-test values from
    grid sampling

    are mapped by interpolating methods from non-measured locations between sampled

    points. The variability of phosphorus and potassium is ﬁeld-speciﬁc, and each
    ﬁeld should

    be fertilized differently to improve nutrient management practices by uniform
    applications

    of fertilizers and manure for better precision agriculture [61].

    4.4. Geographic Information System (GIS)

    The GIS comprises hardware and software designed to provide compilation, storage,

    retrieval, attributes analysis, and location data to generate maps and analyze
    characters and

    geography for statistics and spatial methods [62]. The GIS database provides information

    on ﬁeld soil types, nutrient status, topography, irrigation, surface and subsurface
    drainage,

    quantity of chemical applications, and crop production, and also establishes the
    relationship

    between elements that affect a crop on a particular farming ﬁeld [63]. Apart from
    data

    storage and display, the GIS is used to assess present and alternative management
    by

    compounding and altering data layers for decision-making.

    4.5. Crop Management

    Satellite images provide information on variations in soil conditions, as well
    as crop

    performances affected by topography within the ﬁeld. Therefore, farmers can exactly

    monitor production factors, such as seeds, fertilizers, and pesticides, that are
    responsible

    for yield increase and efﬁciency.

    The spatial coverage and temporal revisit frequency of satellite images provide
    the

    information in near real-time at a regional scale. The relationship between the
    spectral prop-

    erties of crops and their biomass/yield experiments [64] is predicted by spectral
    reﬂectance

    properties of vegetation, especially in red and near-infrared combinations (vegetation

    indices) to monitor green foliage. Among the different indices, the normalized
    difference

    vegetation index (NDVI) is the most popular indicator to assess vegetation health
    and crop

    production, due to the closely related leaf area index (LAI) and photosynthetic
    activity

    of green vegetation [25]. Crop monitoring methods are based on the interpretation
    of

    remote-sensing-derived indicators by comparing actual crop status to previous
    or normal

    seasons [65]. The relationship between vegetation indices and biomass permits
    early crop

    yield estimation in certain periods before harvest [66]. The automated data acquisition,
    pro-

    cessing, monitoring, decision-making, and management of farm operations [67],
    including

    the basic functions of crop production (yields), proﬁts and losses, farm weather
    prediction,

    ﬁeld mapping, soil nutrients tracking, are the more complicated functionalities
    available

    through automated ﬁeld management.

    4.6. Soil and Plant Sensors

    Sensor technology, a signiﬁcant constituent of precision agriculture, provides
    soil

    properties information, fertility, and water status. Hence, new sensors have been
    developed

    based on desirable features and established apart from currently available sensors
    [68].

    Agriculture 2022, 12, 1745

    9 of 26

    Soil sensors and plant wearables monitor real-time physical and chemical signals

    in soil, such as moisture, pH, temperature, and pollutants, and provide information
    to

    optimize crop growth conditions, ﬁght against biotic and abiotic stresses, and
    increase

    crop yields. Soil organic matters (SOMs), nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P), and potassium

    (K) are the most important nutrients for crop production. The NIR reﬂectance-based

    sensors measure the spatial variation of surface and subsurface soil nitrogen
    [69]. SOM is

    predicted based on optimal wavelengths by assessing soil spectral reﬂectance in
    IR and

    visible wavelength regions [70]. The soil nitrogen and phosphorus are predicted
    using

    NIR spectrophotometry technology [71–73]. The soil apparent electrical conductivity
    (ECa)

    sensors collect information continuously on the ﬁeld surface, since ECa is sensitive
    to

    changes in soil texture and salinity. Soil insects/pests are detected using optoelectronic,

    acoustic, impedance sensors, and nanostructured biosensors [74].

    4.7. Rate Controllers

    Rate controllers are designed to control the delivery rate of inputs by monitoring
    the

    speed of vehicles across the ﬁeld, and altering the ﬂow rate of material on a
    real-time basis

    at the target rate. Rate controllers are commonly used as stand-alone systems
    [75].

    4.8. Precision Irrigation in Pressurized Systems

    Recent developments in irrigation systems have introduced irrigation machines,
    de-

    voted to motion control, GPS-based controllers, sensor technologies, and wireless
    commu-

    nication to monitor soil and climatic conditions together with an assessment of
    irrigation

    parameters, i.e., ﬂow and pressure, to attain greater water utilization efﬁciency
    by crop.

    These technologies show signiﬁcant potential; however, further progress is required
    before

    they can become commercially available [76].

    4.9. Yield Monitor

    Yield monitors are the combination of sensors and components, including a data

    storage device, a computer, and user interface, that control integration and interaction

    components. The sensor measures yield continuously by evaluating the force of
    mass or

    volume of grain ﬂow. The mass ﬂow sensor was based on the principle of transmitting

    microwave energy beams and measuring the energy that bounces back after hitting.
    In

    yield monitors, GPS receivers create yield maps based on the location yield data
    [77].

    The yield monitor is mounted on a harvester and connected with the mobile app
    for

    displaying live harvest data, and automatically uploads to the web-based platform.
    The

    app can generate and share high-quality yield maps with an agronomist, and farmers

    can export other farm management data for analysis. In horticultural crops, to
    precisely

    determine the yield quantity and quality of produce, fruit growth is considered
    one of

    the most relevant parameters in the crop progressing period [78]. Color images
    are used

    to track fruit conditions for estimating fruit maturation, making decisions for
    harvesting,

    and targeting the right market [79]. Satellite images are one of the options for
    real-time

    monitoring of the yield of crops over vast areas; for example, Sentinel-1A images
    are used

    to map the rice yield and crop intensity in Myanmar [80].

    The crop yield estimation system was designed using both software and hardware

    components. Based on a Bluetooth terminal android application and yield estimator

    software program, crop yield is estimated using a mathematical calculation through
    a

    mobile application [81]. Satellite-based crop yield predictions based on spectral
    signatures

    reveal the estimated yields are as reliable as actual yields. The maize yield
    predictions

    were successfully carried out under varying environments using machine learning
    and

    satellite-derived data assimilation in crop models [82].

    4.10. Software

    The software has multiple tasks, such as mapping, display controller interfacing,
    data

    processing, analysis, and interpretation, etc. Most commonly, software is used
    to generate

    Agriculture 2022, 12, 1745

    10 of 26

    the maps for soil properties and nutrient status, yield maps, variable rate applications

    maps for inputs, and overlaying different kinds of maps with advanced geostatistical

    features [83].

    5. Applications in Agriculture

    By adopting the current sensor and IoT technologies in agriculture, each characteristic

    of conventional farming practices is rehabilitated. The incorporation of wireless
    sensors

    and IoT in smart farming answers many of the issues facing conventional agriculture;
    for

    example, land suitability, drought monitoring, irrigation, pest control, and yield
    maximiza-

    tion. Figure 5 demonstrates the order of main applications, facilities, and devices
    for smart

    agriculture applications. Using advanced technologies at various stages in the
    following

    few applications enhances efﬁciency and revolutionizes agriculture.

    Figure 5. Hierarchy of probable applications, facilities and devices for smart
    agriculture.

    5.1. Soil Mapping and Plant Monitoring

    Soil analysis estimates the nutrient status of the ﬁeld based on GPS position
    and

    ﬁeld-speciﬁc information, and critical decisions are then taken according to the
    nutrient

    deﬁciencies at different stages of the crop. The factors controlling soil fertility
    status are

    topography, type and texture, cropping pattern, application of fertilizer, irrigation,
    etc. [84].

    Soil mapping is useful for assessing crop suitability or varieties in a speciﬁc
    ﬁeld, as well

    as planting depth, the physical, chemical and biological properties of soil, in
    order to

    best utilize resources. Presently, a wide range of sensors and tools are used
    to monitor

    soil properties, such as water-holding capacity, texture, and absorption rate,
    which assists

    farmers in tracking the soil quality and adopting suitable remedies to avoid soil
    degradation

    such as erosion, alkalization, acidiﬁcation, salinization, and pollution. Drought
    is another

    concern that affects plant productivity and crop yield. Remote sensing techniques
    that

    can obtain soil moisture data frequently assist in analyzing agricultural drought
    in remote

    regions. Soil moisture maps generated from satellite data are used to estimate
    the soil water

    deﬁcit index (SWDI), which enables the development of prediction models based
    on soil

    physical properties [85,86].

    Various factors, such as soil type, soil nutrients, irrigation, and pests, affect
    rice yield

    and quality. The IoT-based mobile application aids crop management and provides
    real-

    time information on soil nutrition and characteristics. The system consists of
    electrical

    conductivity (EC), temperature sensors with a T-Beam microcontroller, and IoT
    connectivity,

    and the estimated EC value near the calibration solution is 12.88 mS/cm, and 150
    mS/cm

    is less than 2% of the calibration solution’s value. The measured EC values are
    linearly

    proportional to temperature and depth, and values of 1.04 and 3.86 mS/cm were
    noticed

    with and without fertilizer at 5 cm depth, while it was 0.656 and 420 mS/cm at
    10 cm depth,

    respectively [87].

    Plant monitoring conducted through the IoT ADCON-based station, with sensors

    and mobile devices (smartphones and tablets), farmers are able to collect data
    on soil and

    ambient parameters, such as leaf wetness, air and soil temperature, soil and air
    humidity to

    improve the grape productivity, and crop quality from seeding to harvest. Further,
    the data

    transmission system highlights the soil-plant-atmosphere interactions needed to
    optimize

    agricultural production [88]. By analyzing the data from soil moisture, carbon
    dioxide,

    light, and temperature sensors in bell peppers grown in a greenhouse were compared
    with

    day and night CO2, rolling the doors and windows of the greenhouse open and closed,

    based on soil moisture [89].

    5.2. Irrigation

    According to the UN Convention to Combat Desertiﬁcation (UNCCD), 168 countries

    will be inundated with desertiﬁcation by 2030, and nearly 50% of the world population

    lives in high water shortage areas [90]. Considering the water crises and increasing
    demand

    for farming and other activities, it must be provided to regions with water quantities.
    Water

    resources are conserved by adopting more controlled and efﬁcient irrigation systems;
    for

    example, drip and sprinkler irrigations. Water demand estimation for crops is
    controlled

    by soil type, precipitation, irrigation method, crop type, and requirement, as
    well as soil

    moisture retention. Using air and soil moisture control systems with wireless
    sensors

    optimizes water resources and improves crop health. In the current scenario, a
    substantial

    increase in crop productivity is anticipated using IoT techniques, namely CWSI
    (crop water

    stress index)-based water management [91], calculated from the crop canopy at
    varying

    crop growth stages and air temperatures. The information from climate data, sensors,
    and

    satellite imaging are related to the CWSI model for water requirement calculation,
    and

    predictions using the irrigation index values can be used for every ﬁeld based
    on slope or

    soil variability to improve water usage efﬁciency.

    5.3. Site-Speciﬁc Nutrient Management

    Fertilizer is a either natural or synthetic chemical substance that provides nutrients
    for

    plant growth and soil fertility. Both nutrient deﬁciency and excessive fertilizer
    use harms

    soil, plant health, and the environment [92]. The site-speciﬁc soil nutrient fertilization
    under

    smart agriculture estimates the required quantity of nutrients precisely, and
    minimizes

    their negative effects through excessive use on soil and in the environment. The
    site-

    speciﬁc soil, nutrient measurements are inﬂuenced by soil types, crop type, yield
    targets,

    exchange capacity, use efﬁciency, the type of fertilizer, weather conditions,
    etc. The IoT-

    based fertilizing technique estimates the nutrient’s spatial patterns of distribution
    [93,94].

    The normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) was obtained from satellite
    images to

    observe crop nutrient status [95,96], crop health, vegetation vigor, and plant
    density, as well

    as soil nutrient level. Recent technologies, like GPS [97], geo mapping [98],
    variable rate

    technology (VRT) [99,100], and autonomous vehicles [101] strongly contribute to
    IoT-based

    smart fertilization. Apart from these, fertigation [102] and chemigation [103,104],
    i.e., the

    use of water-soluble fertilizers in soil amendments and pesticides, are considered
    effective

    management practices to improve fertilization efﬁciency.

    5.4. Crop Pest and Disease Management

    The Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) concluded that an annual global crop

    yield loss of 20- 40% was only due to pests and diseases [105], and these losses
    are controlled

    by the use of pesticides and other agrochemicals [106]. Most of them are harmful
    to human

    and animal health, and ultimately cause contamination of environmental systems
    [107,108].

    The IoT-based devices, such as robots, wireless sensors, and drones, precisely
    spot and

    control the crop opponents by real-time monitoring, modelling, and disease forecasting,

    increasing overall effectiveness [109,110] more than traditional pest control
    procedures.

    The IoT-based disease and pest management process depends on detection and image

    processing. The remote sensing imagery and ﬁeld sensors are used to collect data,
    such

    as plant health and pest incidence, in every ﬁeld for the entire crop period.
    IoT-based

    automated traps [111,112] capture, count, and describe insect types, and further
    upload

    data to the Cloud for complete analysis. Due to advancements in robotic technology,

    an agricultural robot with multispectral image sensing devices and precision spraying

    nozzles is utilized to detect and control pest problems more accurately under
    the IoT

    management system.

    5.5. Yield Monitoring and Forecasting

    The yield monitoring mechanism conforms to yield, moisture content, and quality
    of

    produce. The quality depends on pollination with good pollen, especially under
    changing

    environmental circumstances [113–115]. Crop forecasting predicts the yield before
    the crop

    harvest, and assists the farmer in future planning, decision-making, and further
    analysis of

    the yield quality. Maturity determines the right harvesting time by monitoring
    the crop at

    different development stages, including factors such as fruit color, size, etc.
    Predictions of

    the correct harvesting time aids in maximizing crop quality and production, and
    regulates

    market management strategies. Therefore, farmers should know the exact harvest
    time of

    crops to obtain proﬁt. Figure 6 outlines the idea of a farm area network, representing
    the

    whole farm in real-time conditions.

    The development and installation of a yield monitor [116] on a harvester, connected

    with a mobile app, shows real-time crop harvest, and automatically transmits data
    to

    the manufacturer’s web-based platform. To estimate crop production and monitoring,

    satellite images are exploited to cover vast areas [80]. For fruit crops, multicolor
    (RGB)

    satellite images [79] are utilized to track the diverse fruit conditions, especially
    fruit size

    and color, and plays a major role in estimating its maturation, making decisions
    on harvest,

    and market opportunities. Similarly, multiple optical sensors are used [117] to
    monitor

    shrinking fruits during drying conditions.

    Figure 6. An Internet-of-Things-based network for smart farming.

    6. Role of IoT in Advanced Farming Practices

    Adopting the new methods based on sensor and IoT-based technologies improved

    the yield of crops more than conventional agriculture processes. The involvement
    of new

    sophisticated sensor-based technologies in controlled environments plays an important

    role in enhancing the quality and quantity of produce.

    6.1. Greenhouse Farming and Protected Cultivation

    Growing plants in a controlled environment gained popularity in the 19th Century,

    and is considered one of the oldest methods of smart farming. These practices
    further

    accelerated during the 20th Century in countries facing severe weather conditions
    [118].

    Crops grown in indoor conditions are less affected by the environment. As a result,

    crops grown traditionally under suitable conditions are today being raised at
    anytime and

    anywhere by the use of sensors and communication devices. The success of crop
    production

    under a controlled environment depends on various factors, such as shed structures
    and

    material for controlling wind effects, aeration systems, accuracy of monitoring
    parameters,

    decision support system, etc. [119]. One of the greatest challenges in greenhouses
    is the

    precise monitoring of environmental parameters; hence, it requires several measurement

    points to predict the various parameters for controlling and ensuring the local
    climate. In

    an IoT-based greenhouse, sensors are used to measure and monitor the internal
    parameters,

    such as humidity, temperature, light, and pressure [120].

    The smart greenhouse has helped farmers automatically conduct farm work, without

    manual inspection, and protects the plants from hailstorms, winds, ultraviolet
    radiation,

    and insect and pest attacks. Hibiscus plants are grown with the required wavelength
    during

    the night using lights, temperature, and air humidity sensors. A study revealed
    a reduction

    in 70–80% water requirement, and the IoT enables direct contact between the farmer
    and

    consumer to make farming as efﬁcient and proﬁtable as possible [121]. The IoT-enabled

    automated system increased the productivity of rose plants grown in a greenhouse
    by

    Agriculture 2022, 12, 1745

    14 of 26

    monitoring and controlling various parameters, such as humidity, mist, CO2 level,
    UV light

    intensity, pH and EC value, water nutrients solution level, temperature, and amount
    of

    pesticides, through sensors for further efﬁcient detection and diagnosis [122].

    6.2. Hydroponics

    Hydroponics, a subdivision of hydroculture, is growing plants without soil to
    improve

    greenhouse farming beneﬁts. Hydroponic-based irrigation systems enable a balanced
    rate

    of application of dissolved nutrients in the water to crop roots as a solution.
    Presently,

    the available systems and sensors [123] detect a wide range of parameters and
    perform

    data analysis at predetermined intervals. Precise measurement and monitoring of
    nutrient

    content in solution is crucial for plant growth and considers its demands. On
    a real-

    time basis, the wireless-sensor-based prototype [124] has delivered a solution
    for soilless

    cultivation, and measures the concentration of numerous nutrients and water levels
    [125].

    An automated smart hydroponics system integrated with IoT consists of three major

    components: input data, cloud server and output data. These monitor lettuce cultivation

    from anywhere through the internet by analyzing parameters, such as pH level,
    water,

    nutrient-rich water-based solution, room temperature, and humidity, on a real-time
    ba-

    sis [126]. The hydroponic system of the deep ﬂow technique is a method for cultivating

    plants by placing roots in deep water layers, and ensuring the continuous circulation
    of

    plant nutrient solution. The plant growth elements data, such as pH, temperature,
    humid-

    ity, and water level in the hydroponic reservoir, are acquired by sensors integrated
    into

    Raspberry Pi, and data are processed and monitored automatically on a real-time
    basis to

    ensure proper water circulation [127].

    6.3. Vertical Farming

    The industrial-based agricultural farming practices damage soil quality at a faster

    rate than nature can reconstruct. The alarming erosion rate and use of fresh water
    for

    agriculture has led to the reduction of arable land, and increased the overburden
    on present

    water reservoirs [128]. Vertical farming (VF) offers an opportunity to keep the
    plants in a

    precisely controlled environment, signiﬁcantly reducing resource consumption and,
    at the

    same time, increasing production at varied times; and only a portion of the ground
    surface

    is needed depending on the number of stacks. VF is also extremely effective in
    higher

    yields and reducing water consumption compared to traditional farming [129]. The
    carbon

    dioxide measurement is the most critical parameter; hence, nondispersive infrared
    (NDIR)

    CO2 sensors play a vital part in tracking and controlling the conditions in vertical
    farms.

    6.4. Phenotyping

    Phenotyping is an emerging crop engineering technique, relating plant genomics
    with

    ecophysiology and agronomy. The advancement of genetic and molecular tools is
    signiﬁ-

    cant for crop breeding; however, quantitative analysis of crop behaviors, such
    as pathogen

    resistance, grain weight, etc., is inadequate due to the absence of effective
    technologies

    and efﬁcient techniques. In this condition, [130] reported that plant phenotyping
    is highly

    useful in investigating the quantitative characteristics responsible for growth,
    resistance

    to various stresses, yield quality, and quantity. The sensing technologies and
    image-based

    phenotyping describe screening of biostimulants and an understanding of their
    mode

    of action [131]. IoT-based phenotyping is intended to observe the crop and related
    trait

    measurements, and offer facilities for the breeding of crops and digital agriculture
    [132].

    The trait analysis algorithms and modelling support determine the relationships
    among

    genotypes, phenotypes, and their growing condition.

    7. The Role of the Engineer in Smart Farming

    Farmers face many issues when they adopt IoT-based agriculture. Therefore, engi-

    neers must develop solutions for speciﬁc problems related to smart farming techniques.
    An

    engineering role concerns the application and use of innovative technologies and
    methods

    Agriculture 2022, 12, 1745

    15 of 26

    for precision agricultural machinery, and smart farming is a creative way to mechanize

    agricultural engineering through means different from conventional mechanization
    [133].

    The concepts and synergy-based information are obtained from different technology
    areas,

    such as agricultural mechanization, mechatronics, instrumentation, control systems,
    and

    knowledge in artiﬁcial and computational intelligence [134]. Big data, satellite,
    and aerial

    images have revolutionized precision agriculture, and these new technologies increase

    production efﬁciency by creating a balance between productivity and environmental
    pro-

    tection. As a system integrator, engineering combines technical experience and
    strong

    business skills in both the public and private sectors [135].

    At the same time, engineering exploits the rewards of digital transformation in
    the

    entire agri-food chain, from day-to-day farming activities to supporting sales
    operations,

    logistics, and the maintenance of farm assets. For example, knowledge of the IoT,
    AI,

    mobile, precision farming technologies, remote sensing, advanced analytics, the
    Cloud,

    RPA, and blockchain technologies are necessary [136]. The data collected from
    the various

    types of machinery through sensors and other devices generates responses concerning

    cereals, viticulture, fruit, and vegetables, as well as soil and monitoring [137].

    The use of digital technologies and control systems to automate production processes

    also reduces manual human intervention. The production process, from ﬁeld to ﬁnal

    product, is carried out by planning, organizing, and analyzing data received from
    machines.

    The data acquired are stored in historical archives and correlated with each other
    to

    retrieve useful information for products through traceable systems working based
    on

    radio-frequency signals [138].

    7.1. Purpose

    Purpose is based on the user’s ﬁnal requirement, and inﬂuences the monitoring
    of

    crops during the growth period. Sensors provide the IoT solutions to their problems.

    For example, the end-user is a corn farmer, faced by problems mainly concerning
    water

    usage and ensuring that a crop gets adequate water; therefore, water level and
    moisture

    monitoring sensors are accommodated to prevent water wastage.

    7.2. Technology

    Distance plays an important role in technology selection because the sensors collect

    data and send to the server; hence, similar technology cannot be used for varying
    distances.

    For example, radio frequency identiﬁcation (RFID) or near ﬁeld communication (NFC)
    and

    low power, wide area network (LPWAN) technologies could send data over a distance
    of

    hundreds or even thousands of meters.

    7.3. Power Requirements

    Most IoT solutions are spread across a large farm, so it is better to develop
    low-

    power applications. On the other hand, more data transmission requires huge data
    costs

    and power consumption; hence, designers need to consider developing cost-effective
    IoT

    solutions for farmers. Usually, engineers save costs with customized IoT-based
    farming

    solutions, and develop apps for sending the data less frequently.

    7.4. Data Frequency

    The end user’s necessities are critical in deciding the number of sensors and
    data

    packets. Sometimes, a farmer does not require information frequently, but developer
    design

    an IoT application to function on a continual and real-time basis, with very high
    data

    frequency.

    7.5. Placement of Sensors

    Sensors are placed in such a way that they provide optimal performance, even if
    the

    farm has all the essential sensors with proper placement.

    8. Barriers to Implementing Smart Farming Technologies

    Technology adoption is a method with a certain level of heterogeneity factors
    that

    are affective [139]. Technology implemented in farming systems has provided accuracy,

    efﬁciency, and eased time pressures. Although smart farming increases the productivity
    of

    crops, there are still problems in adopting these technologies

    8.1. Cost of Technology

    Existing technologies minimize the workforce and perform extremely fast with high

    accuracy. Therefore, it is anticipated that machines would probably replace a
    human work-

    force in the near future. However, it is impossible, since many countries have
    experienced

    poverty wherever the workforce was the main source for the agriculture sector.
    The imple-

    mentation of devices and technologies requires a huge amount of money; therefore,
    farmers

    face difﬁculties in terms of affordability when they look beyond conventional
    tools.

    8.2. Lack of Financial Resources

    Financial supporters could provide adequate loans to farmers if farmers did not
    get

    the anticipated yield, perhaps because unexpected calamities like drought, ﬂood,
    pests,

    and diseases impacted the crops.

    8.3. Literacy Status of Farmers

    The education level among the farmers is one of the greater challenges in implementing

    technologies in developing countries. The knowledge needed encompasses educational
    and

    technical abilities to manage the tools. The level of education increases a farmers’
    aptitude

    to process information, and thus make decisions using smart farming technologies
    [140],

    facilitating farmers’ use of computers [141]. Farmers in developing nations are
    mostly

    uneducated and unskilled because of a lack of desire to gain knowledge, or any
    new

    technology awareness [142]. Hence, it is a reason for farmers in choosing traditional

    farming over smart farming [143]. Farmers have considered that usage is too complex,

    sometimes incapable of recognizing the icons used in a mobile application as the
    farmers

    use general icons based on traditional understanding. Farmers need to be digitally
    literate

    to reinforce the advantages of smart farming technologies and, simultaneously,
    agri-tech

    companies should ensure farmers easily understand the limitations of the technology.

    8.4. Lack of Integration between the Systems

    Integration across systems is one of the areas where smart farming technologies
    needs

    to be advanced further by incorporating production, property management, and decision-

    making tools. The communication between academics and interdisciplinary groups
    must

    overcome the gap between agricultural and information science. More emphasis has

    been given to increasing user effectiveness during the development of an information

    system [144]. The basis for improved decision-making is based on the timely obtain-

    ability of superior quality data; hence, data must be integrated to generate information

    and knowledge.

    8.5. Telecommunications Infrastructure

    Farming activities mostly occur in rural areas more effectively in arable land
    than

    contaminated land. However, poor telecommunication infrastructure makes data transmis-

    sion unreliable, especially through mobile phones and tablets. Smart farming necessitates

    a real-time connection with the internet to enable the use of information. In
    addition,

    various operation control systems, such as fertilizers, pesticides, and seed volume,
    requires

    high-quality internet connection to produce outcomes. Recently, with the expansion
    of

    mobile phones, rural producers have gained to access mobile internet; however,
    signal

    quality and input speed are limited.

    Agriculture 2022, 12, 1745

    17 of 26

    8.6. Data Management

    Farmers are facing problems in organizing and manipulating data obtained by the

    sensors. The weather stations are generating data; however, farmers do not recognize
    how

    to use the information and how to change the data into a more available form.
    Its complex

    systems, alongside issues of acceptability and usability, lead to incorrect calculations.

    Farmers, consultants, and others involved in the production process must provide
    greater

    accessibility to data and information in productive systems.

    9. Current Challenges and Future Expectations

    In the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, the United Nations and international

    community established a goal to end hunger by 2030. Currently, the World Health
    Organi-

    zation reports that more than 800 million people are facing food shortages worldwise
    [145].

    In addition, the increasing global population is increasing the demand for quality
    food;

    therefore, food and cash crops could improve overall crop production.

    Figure 7 represents the future challenges agriculture is anticipated to face in
    2050. This

    illustration offers three major problems: (1) feeding 10 billion people, (2) limitations
    in the

    expansion of land, and (3) the reduction of greenhouse gases emissions. These
    challenges

    lead to new thinking about water scarcity, shrinking arable land, rural labor,
    climate condi-

    tions, and much more. The diminishment in rural populations due to urbanization
    is not

    only shrinking communities, but is also leading to ageing populations; therefore,
    younger

    growers must step forward to take responsibility. The generation shift and population

    imbalance create further implications for the workforce and production.

    Figure 7. Challenges in sustainable future agriculture.

    The further shrinking of arable land and the suitability of particular crops in
    speciﬁc

    regions are due to geographic and ecological conditions. Abrupt weather changes
    enhance

    the intensity of environmental issues, such as drought, groundwater depletion,
    and soil

    degradation, affecting crop production. Moreover, traditional agricultural methods
    have

    historically met food demands by employing fertilizers and pesticides; however,
    it increases

    food production only to a certain level and negligent use of chemical deteriorate
    the envi-

    ronment. In developing countries, various problems facing the agricultural sector
    include

    no suitable crop selection, soil testing, efﬁcient irrigation systems, weather
    forecasting,

    animal husbandry, etc. Technological advancements have proved beneﬁcial in developed

    countries, both quantitively and qualitatively, but, in developing countries,
    50% of the

    population is already engaged in agriculture.

    Agriculture 2022, 12, 1745

    18 of 26

    The future of agriculture is expected to interconnect with artiﬁcial intelligence
    and

    big data services. As a result, the systems will converge into a single unit,
    where farm

    machinery and management start from seeding to production forecasting. Few of
    the key

    technologies and methods are focused on achieving sustainable future agriculture.

    9.1. Communication

    The achievement of the IoT in agriculture mostly depends on connectivity between

    devices [146]. Most telecom operators provide connectivity services, but represent
    a small

    percentage of smart farming as a whole. Cellular operators offer new services
    to target

    growers and enhance market facilities, especially in rural areas. The success
    of cellular

    technology is feasible when service providers guarantee its beneﬁts, such as ﬂexibility,

    portability, and extravagance, of both-way communication at low cost. In developing

    countries, mobile services and smartphone technology offer a hopeful future for
    farmers

    to enhance their crop yields. The low power wide area technology (LPWA) is anticipated

    to play a major role in smart farming agriculture, due to its improved facilities,
    efﬁcient

    coverage, low power consumption, and cost economics. The cellular operators with
    robust

    IoT create signiﬁcant returns by offering smart agriculture facilities in collaboration
    with

    LPWA technology.

    9.2. Wireless Sensors and IoT

    Placing wireless sensors around the ﬁeld provides timely information on a real-time

    basis to farmers in order to make decisions and act in order to obtain higher
    crop yields.

    Wireless sensor networks (WSNs) with GPS technology update all information on
    crop

    growth and terrain features. Recently, digital images and signal processing offer
    additional

    competencies to WSN, and precisely ascertain crop quality and health. The IoT
    technology

    can streamline tasks in a predictable manner by diagnosing crop requirements at
    each

    stage to maximize their effectiveness. In the future, IoT will be upgraded to
    the ﬁfth-

    generation (5G) cellular mobile communication technologies, to provide real-time
    data

    to farmers at any time and everywhere. Based on this achievement, around 29 billion

    IoT-based components are expected to operate in the agriculture sector by the
    end of 2022.

    Furthermore, it is expected to create 4.1 million data points daily from farms
    by 2050 [147].

    9.3. Drones and Unarmed Vehicles

    Farmers widely use drones for crop growth monitoring, spraying nutrient solutions

    and water, and pesticides in tough terrains and for different crop heights. Drones
    have

    proven their value for spraying speed, area coverage, and precision, compared
    to tradi-

    tional machinery. Due to advancements in technology, drones are equipped with
    various

    sensors, and 3D cameras provide comprehensive capabilities in land management
    by

    farmers. With the addition of UAVs in agriculture, many challenges, particularly
    the in-

    corporation of technologies and use in inclement weather conditions, are addressed
    by

    farmers. Other than drones, robotics in agriculture has also enhanced productivity
    due to

    higher yields achieved by spraying and weeding without human intervention. The
    seeding,

    transplanting, and fruit harvest/picking robots have recently added a new efﬁciency
    level

    to traditional methods.

    The UAV technology in smart agriculture provides information on fertilization,
    ir-

    rigation, use of pesticides, plant growth monitoring, weed management, crop disease

    management, and ﬁeld-level phenotyping to enhance cultivation practices. A new
    method

    of 3D modeling has been used to monitor crop growth parameters to determine the
    height

    of maize and sorghum plants under ﬁeld conditions using UAV, and the average root
    mean

    square error (RMSE) of sorghum height with hand sampling ﬁeld data was 0.33 m
    [148]. The

    UAV and 3D models were also restored to extract leaf area index (LAI) in soybean
    plants,

    the measured LAI predicted accuracy corresponding to the handheld device (R2 =
    0.92)

    was correlated with destructive LAI measurements (R2 = 0.89) [149].

    Weed detection and management were assessed by integrating low-resolution multi-

    spectral high-resolution RGB images [150] using the Random Forest (RF) technique
    in

    ﬁeld-grown rice and sugar beet crops [151]. Multi-spectral digital images obtained
    by

    UAVs are used for evaluating vegetation indices (VIs) and multi-temporal VIs to
    predict

    grain yield in wheat [152]. The indices, including the normalized difference vegetation

    index (NDVI), spectral vegetation index (SVI), and green area index (GAI), are
    evaluated in

    wheat crops to predict grain yield [153], monitor breeding [154], detect plant
    stress caused

    by yellow rust disease [155], and quantify plant density [156]. The usage of pesticides
    in

    agriculture is crucial for crop yields and the environment, and efforts have been
    made to

    develop and evaluate an algorithm to self-adjust UAV routes during chemical spraying
    in a

    crop ﬁeld to reduce the waste of pesticides and fertilizers [157].

    9.4. Vertical Farming and Hydroponics

    The shrinking of arable land and rapid urbanization results in greater pressure
    on the

    present resources [158], which causes hardships for food production with current
    agricul-

    ture practices. Vertical farming (VF) navigates land and water shortage challenges,
    and

    is highly suitable for adoption in nearby cities. Hydroponics plays a key role
    in lowering

    water requirements. Hydroponics, along with VF, increases available arable land
    without

    distressing forests and other natural habitats. The presence of advanced technologies,

    especially the IoT, makes the agriculture industry highly remunerative with a
    reduction in

    labor requirements and other resources, in addition to minimizing environmental
    impact.

    9.5. Performance Analysis Using Machine Learning

    Data analytics and machine learning concepts are applied to analyze the real-time

    data. In crop production, identifying the best genes is an important process that
    can be

    conducted using machine learning techniques. In agriculture, machine learning
    is used to

    envisage the best genes suited for crop production, especially for selecting seed
    varieties

    that are highly suitable to speciﬁc climate conditions and locations. Machine
    learning

    algorithms identify high demand products and currently unavailable products. Recent

    developments in machine learning and analytics allow farmers to correctly categorize
    their

    harvests before it is processes and delivered to customers.

    Machine learning (ML) in big data systems solves the issues related to farmers’

    decision-making, crops, animal research, land, food availability and security,
    weather

    and climate change, and weeds [159]. ML-based applications accommodate a large
    number

    of agricultural activities, such as yield prediction based on a deep memory model
    for

    maize [160], binary classiﬁcation model with logistic regression technique to
    assess rainfall

    intensity [161], and a short-term memory model to predict soil water content with
    data

    parameters of rainfall, temperature, water diversion, evaporation, and time for
    the next

    1, 2, and 7 days with greater R2 compared to artiﬁcial neural networks [162].
    As a result,

    the agricultural sector is increasing farmers’ incomes, and so communities are
    further

    integrated into the agricultural value chain to reduce poverty and provide access
    to health

    care, education, and nutritious food for their families [163].

    9.6. Renewable Energy, Microgrids and Smart Grids

    Smart farming requires extensive energy due to power consumption by long-standing

    sensor placement, use of GPS, and data transmission. Traditionally, using renewable
    energy

    sources in remote areas solves long-term power issues. Smart grids and microgrids
    are

    integrated into distributed energy sources (DERs). Recent advances in storage
    devices

    combine electricity and heat systems to stock energy and use the heat produced.

    Globally, smart grid technology enables a smooth transition from traditional to
    smart

    energy systems, ensuring energy security. In developing countries, power-strengthening

    systems integrated with renewable sources have enhanced the transport sector,
    and in-

    creased bioenergy use in the power sector through profuse renewable energy sources

    identiﬁed using smart technologies, such as, energy storage devices, smart appliances,

    Agriculture 2022, 12, 1745

    20 of 26

    computational intelligence, and the IoT. For example, the smart grid provides
    a broad

    range of opportunities for power sector reform in Nepal, alleviating the rural
    electricity

    problem by implementing smart microgrids, and subsequently, connecting to the
    national

    grid [164]. The Dayalbagh renewable energy smart microgrid in India is a small-scale

    electricity system comprising distributed loads and renewable energy resources,
    acting as a

    single controllable entity in the grid. The smart microgrids are integrated into
    renewable

    resources and form building blocks of smart grids, especially for the dairy plant
    to produce

    various dairy products [165].

    The mixed integer linear programme (MILP) systematically and efﬁciently managed

    energy consumption and subsequently lowered the cost, especially in residential
    areas,

    by scheduling the use of smart appliances and charging/discharging electric vehicles

    (EVs). The model generates its own energy from a microgrid containing solar panels

    and wind turbines, and forecasts wind speed and solar radiation for effective
    energy

    management. MILP-based energy planning sustains the effectiveness and productiveness

    of energy-efﬁcient techniques [166].

    10. Conclusions

    Smarter and more efﬁcient crop production methodologies are needed to address
    the

    issues of shrinking arable land and the food demands of an increasing world population.

    There is a necessity for everyone to be aware of food security in terms of sustainable

    agriculture. The growth of new technologies for increasing crop yield and encouraging

    the adoption of farming by innovative young people as a legitimate profession.
    This

    paper emphasized the role of many technologies used for farming, particularly
    the IoT,

    in making agriculture smarter and more effective in meeting future requirements.
    The

    current challenges faced by the industry and future prospects are noted to guide
    scholars

    and engineers. Hence, every piece of farmland is important to enhance crop production
    by

    dealing with every inch of land using sustainable IoT-based sensors and communication

    technologies.

    \ (AI)\n1. Introduction\nPrecision agriculture (PA) is a management strategy for\
    \ addressing geographical\nand temporal variabilities in agricultural ﬁelds [1–3]\
    \ that involves data and contempo-\nrary technologies. With a forecasted human\
    \ population of between 9 and 10 billion by\n2050 [3–5], precision agriculture\
    \ is becoming more and more important to contemporary\nagricultural research.\
    \ By 2050, the amount of food produced worldwide must grow by at\nleast 70% [1,5–7].\
    \ This is a difﬁcult endeavor [4] because it puts further strain on already-\n\
    scarce resources and the environment [1–3]. Therefore, precision agriculture is\
    \ essential\nto maximize output while using fewer inputs of all sorts in more\
    \ effective ways, reducing\nadverse impacts on the environment, and assuring sustainability\
    \ [2,3]. Precision farming\nwas born with the introduction of GPSs (global positioning\
    \ systems), GISs (geographic in-\nformation systems), yield monitors, and other\
    \ data generators in all three crucial phases of\nagricultural operations in the\
    \ 1990s [2,8,9]. In precision agriculture, motorized equipment\nwas only used\
    \ for performing agricultural processes [2,10], and the problem-recognizing\n\
    and decision-making steps were authorized by humans. The technological advancement\n\
    during the Third Industrial Revolution, known as Industry 3.0 [8], led precision\
    \ agriculture\nto digitalization by integrating information technologies and improved\
    \ automation capa-\nbilities in precision farming. As a result of this digitalization,\
    \ “farm practices” with manual\ntools moved to “agriculture” from animal traction,\
    \ then to motorized mechanization, and\nnow to digital equipment [2].\nPrecision\
    \ agriculture so far mainly consists of variable rate technologies (VRTs), elec-\n\
    tronic maps, yield monitors, and guidance farming systems [2,8]. Variable rate\
    \ applications\nAgriculture 2023, 13, 1593. https://doi.org/10.3390/agriculture13081593\n\

    were ﬁrstly demonstrated in northern Germany and Denmark in 1988 after global\
    \ posi-\ntioning systems (GPSs) were available for civil services [11]. GPS services\
    \ were opened\nfor general use in U.S. farms in 1983 [2]. In the next decade,\
    \ GPS technology facilitated\nfarmers to precisely locate and map their ﬁelds\
    \ [10,12], empowering them to manage their\nfarmlands according to site-speciﬁc\
    \ conditions and ﬁeld variabilities. At the beginning\nof the second millennium,\
    \ yield monitors were developed, enabling farmers to monitor\ncrop yield in real-time\
    \ via best matching [13]. Advancement of remote-sensing technology,\nsuch as satellites,\
    \ drones, ground-based sensors, and crews, authorized farmers to collect\nhigh-resolution\
    \ data on their ﬁelds, allowing them to make informed decisions about\ncrop management\
    \ [3]. Precision agriculture is not only focused on crop farming but also\non\
    \ other agricultural production systems: agronomics, livestock farming, aquaculture,\n\
    and agroforestry [2,3,9,14].\nIn the current status of precision agriculture,\
    \ there are several issues, such as un-\nsustainable resource utilization, long-term\
    \ monoculture, intensive animal farming [8],\nenvironmental compromises, uneven\
    \ distribution of digitization [15], food safety issues,\ninefﬁcient agri-food\
    \ supply chain [13,16], and lack of awareness of and inertia toward novel\nchanges.\
    \ These issues prevent achieving efﬁciency, productivity, and sustainability from\n\
    agricultural production and escalate unintended impacts on ecosystems [17]. The\
    \ fourth\nindustrial revolution, which is known as Industry 4.0, occurred in 2011\
    \ with the Internet of\nThings (IoT), big data, artiﬁcial intelligence (AI), robotics,\
    \ and blockchain technology [8,18].\nIn 2017, these advanced technologies were\
    \ integrated into agriculture in order to over-\ncome the above-mentioned issues,\
    \ transforming precision agriculture to Agriculture 4.0,\nor smart farming [8,16].\
    \ With this transition, there is a growing focus on sustainability\nin agriculture,\
    \ with many farmers adopting precision agricultural technologies to reduce\nthe\
    \ environmental impacts of farming and promote long-term sustainability. As a\
    \ result,\nagricultural-manufacturing processes and supply chains have become\
    \ more autonomous\nand intelligent [18], including the automation of various tasks\
    \ such as planting, seeding,\nharvesting, and soil sampling. This is making farming\
    \ more efﬁcient while reducing\nlabor costs.\nSmart agriculture is an evolving\
    \ ﬁeld that leverages technological innovations to\ntransform traditional farming\
    \ practices. The integration of digital technologies into agricul-\nture has opened\
    \ up new opportunities and possibilities, revolutionizing the way farmers\nmanage\
    \ their crops, resources, and operations. It is a rapidly evolving ﬁeld that encom-\n\
    passes a wide array of approaches, applications, and impacts. The broader objective\
    \ of\nthis review is to delve into the essential aspects of precision agriculture,\
    \ exploring its key\ncomponents and highlighting its potential for sustainable\
    \ farming practices. One of the\ncritical aspects of precision agriculture is\
    \ data collection and acquisition planning, which\nplays a fundamental role in\
    \ optimizing farm management decisions. Through efﬁcient data\ngathering, farmers\
    \ can make informed choices regarding crop health, resource allocation,\nand yield\
    \ optimization. Decision making and execution are also vital components of preci-\n\
    sion agriculture, where the integration of cutting-edge technologies is pivotal.\
    \ Leveraging\nmachine vision technology, the Internet of Things (IoT), and artiﬁcial\
    \ intelligence (AI) can\nlead to enhanced precision and efﬁciency in agricultural\
    \ processes, beneﬁting both farmers\nand the environment. Throughout this review,\
    \ successful precision agriculture proposals\nand real-world implementations are\
    \ analyzed to gain insights into their achievements and\nchallenges. By identifying\
    \ future developments required in precision agriculture, we aim\nto provide a\
    \ comprehensive understanding of how this ﬁeld can continually evolve to\nsupport\
    \ sustainable farming practices and address global food security challenges. The\n\
    amalgamation of scientiﬁc research and technological innovations holds great promise\
    \ for\nthe future of precision agriculture and its positive impact on agriculture\
    \ and society as\na whole.\nAgriculture 2023, 13, 1593\n3 of 26\n2. Precision\
    \ Agriculture Approaches, Applications, and Impacts\nPrecision agriculture involves\
    \ data-driven management decisions that improve re-\nsource use efﬁciency, resulting\
    \ in reduced agricultural costs while lowering the environ-\nmental impacts from\
    \ agriculture [19]. Hence, data and data collection systems, decision\nsupport\
    \ tools, and data-driven equipment and input adjustments are major components\n\
    of precision agriculture [2], engaging in three key agricultural steps: diagnosis,\
    \ decision\nmaking, and performing [20], respectively. Before the integration\
    \ of smart technologies,\nICT (information and communication technology) was incorporated\
    \ into agricultural de-\nvices and machinery to capture real data. Here, remote\
    \ sensing, automated hardware and\nsoftware, telematics, drones, autonomous vehicles,\
    \ GPSs, and robotic technologies were\nincorporated into agricultural practices.\
    \ As an example, the agro-tech company John Deere\nintroduced GPSs for tractors,\
    \ expecting increased yield and decreased input wastage [19].\nThe previous status\
    \ of precision agriculture before smart farming can be summarized\nas follows.\n\
    2.1. Data Collection and Acquisition\nData, data collection, and decision support\
    \ tools are important for the identiﬁcation\nand diagnosis of various aspects\
    \ in agriculture. In precision agriculture, data on individual\nﬁelds and crops\
    \ are gathered by observing, measuring, and sensing with different kinds of\n\
    sensors, yield and soil monitors, and remote-sensing tools, such as imaging from\
    \ drones,\ncrews, aircraft, or satellites [1–3,13]. Thus, “sensing” is a fundamental\
    \ management tool\nof precision agriculture [3,13], which is observing detailed\
    \ information and providing\ndata on climate conditions, soil conditions, fertilizer\
    \ requirements, water availability, pest\nand disease stresses, and other ﬁeld\
    \ parameters [3]. A range of sensors are used in preci-\nsion agriculture. Biomass\
    \ parameters are important in making decisions to monitor the\nfertilization and\
    \ caring for crops. Sensors for mass ﬂow and moisture content are com-\nponents\
    \ of yield monitors, together with a differential global positioning system (DGPS)\n\
    receiver. Properly calibrated yield monitors can generate accurate real-time information\
    \ for\ndecision making, such as underperforming areas leading to site-speciﬁc\
    \ crop fertilization\ndesigns [13]. Precision livestock farming uses sensors and\
    \ monitoring technology to collect\ndata on animal health and welfare, enabling\
    \ farmers to make informed decisions about\nfeed, waste, and other inputs with\
    \ improved efﬁciency and productivity. Colter position\nsensors combined with\
    \ ultrasonic soil surface sensors are employed in dynamic Colter\ndepth control\
    \ systems [3].\nRemote-sensing technologies, such as drones, crews, aircraft,\
    \ satellites, and other\nground-based sensors, are used to collect data on crops\
    \ and soil conditions [2,3]. Remote\nsensing supports the identiﬁcation of spatial\
    \ patterns of signatures of plants that are co-\nincidental with soil characteristics,\
    \ as well as pest or disease stresses [11]. Imagery is one\nkind of remote-sensing\
    \ data that can reveal ground truthing [2,3,11]. Previously, aircraft\nhave been\
    \ used not only for many farming imagery operations that generate data, but also\n\
    chemical- or fertilizer-spraying activities. Moreover, satellite images have been\
    \ available for\nfarm management for many years. As an example, the US-LANDSAT\
    \ satellites were avail-\nable for this purpose in 1970 [2]. Unmanned aerial vehicles\
    \ (UAVs) equipped with global\nnavigation satellite system (GNSS) technology have\
    \ been recently employed for mapping,\ngathering imagery data, land surveying,\
    \ crop spraying, and livestock monitoring [2,3].\nGeocoded sampling is a requisite\
    \ component of precision agriculture and ground truthing\nwhen spatial images\
    \ are used for decision making [11]. Real-time and cost-effective remote\nsensing,\
    \ such as LASSIE (low-altitude stationary surveillance instrumental equipment),\n\
    are crucial in precision agriculture, as it enables continuous and automatic recoding\
    \ of\nreal-time images of crops and soil with GIS reference [11]. This information\
    \ can be used to\nmake informed decisions about crop management resource allocation\
    \ [3].\nSensor data and other data associated with geospatial coordinates from\
    \ a global\nnavigation satellite system (GNSS) provide information to create maps,\
    \ especially yield\nmaps and soil maps for site-speciﬁc management decisions [2,3].\
    \ Yield maps are used\nAgriculture 2023, 13, 1593\n4 of 26\nto characterize ﬁeld\
    \ production quantitatively and qualitatively [21], which is crucial\nto make\
    \ management decisions. Analyzing variabilities depicted on maps enables the\n\
    identiﬁcation of factors that inﬂuence productivity, facilitating the implementation\
    \ of site-\nspeciﬁc ﬁeld management strategies [3]. Soil maps offer valuable insights\
    \ into the spatial\ndistribution of the physical and chemical properties within\
    \ a given ﬁeld [21], serving as\nindispensable decision-making tools in precision\
    \ agriculture [13]. This signiﬁcance stems\nfrom the fact that soil’s physical\
    \ and chemical characteristics, such as water availability,\nnutrient-holding\
    \ capacity, bulk density, porosity, nutrient availability, and topography,\ntypically\
    \ exert an inﬂuence on crop yield [21]. Weather and climate trends can also be\n\
    predicted using sensor data, which are important in all farming practices. Harvesting\
    \ time\nis an affecting factor of grain loss in paddy rice farming, which is also\
    \ able to be monitored\nwith data observation [1].\n2.2. Planning, Decision Making,\
    \ and Execution\nAfter creating decisions by analyzing gathered information, actions\
    \ are performed\naccording to the decisions created using data-driven equipment.\
    \ Most ﬁelds are not\nhomogenous in terms of soil and climate properties, as well\
    \ as diseases [22]. Conventional\nagriculture did not take this into account;\
    \ therefore, rigorous use of limited resources and\nexcess use of chemicals and\
    \ synthetic fertilizers resulted in unsustainable conventional\nagricultural practices.\
    \ This also drove lots of wastage, even in the amounts of resource\ninputs and\
    \ yield. Nonetheless, precision agriculture itself has proved that the application\n\
    of technologies to manage the spatial and temporal variabilities in agricultural\
    \ ﬁelds is\npossible to improve performance and environmental quality [9]. Variable\
    \ rate technologies\nin precision agriculture involve applying inputs such as\
    \ fertilizers, water and seeds, and\ncrop protection chemicals (pesticides and\
    \ weedicides) at varying rates, depending on the\nspeciﬁc needs of each area of\
    \ a ﬁeld [23]. In this approach, residual issues of chemicals, as\nwell as wastage\
    \ of input resources, can be reduced. Also, net proﬁt can be improved with\nincreased\
    \ crop yield and reduced input costs, as farmers can use resources according to\
    \ the\nﬁeld requirements rather than full-coverage application in ﬁelds at uniform\
    \ rates [2,24,25].\nAccording to the identiﬁed heterogeneity of a ﬁeld, amounts\
    \ of water, fertilizer, her-\nbicides, pesticides, and liming can be determined\
    \ and applied. When considering the\nirrigation practices in precision agriculture,\
    \ technology-driven, more sustainable smart\nirrigation systems are there to apply\
    \ precise amounts of water at precise times. When\nsoil moisture sensor data give\
    \ an estimation of a required amount of water, irrigation\nsystems can be diverted\
    \ into variable rate irrigation to apply irrigation water until mois-\nture content\
    \ returns to the ideal level [26]. Most of the time, these effective and efﬁcient\n\
    water management systems are automatically controlled, increasing irrigation water\
    \ use\nefﬁciency (IWUE). Monteiro et al. in 2021 described the use of satellite\
    \ LANDSAT data and\nremote-sensing data to develop a feasible operational irrigation\
    \ water model [3]. Likewise,\ntillage depth can be determined via matching with\
    \ variabilities of soil physical proper-\nties [27]. Chemical spraying and seeding\
    \ are also performed according to variable rate\napproaches. Previously, agricultural\
    \ aircraft were used for chemical spraying, where a\npilot controlled the spray\
    \ [23]. In the present, aircraft are employed with an auto-adjusting\nability\
    \ for the application rate of chemicals based on a prescription map, whilst UAVs\
    \ are\nalso used as fertilizer spreaders [3]. Precision seeding can control sowing\
    \ depth, densities,\nand distances effectively while saving seeds, time, and labor\
    \ costs. Studies estimated that\nprecision seeding based on variable rate technologies\
    \ was 10% to 30% more efﬁcient than\nconventional practices [3].\nThis site-speciﬁc\
    \ management increases the number of correct decisions per unit area\nper unit\
    \ time related to net beneﬁts [9] while supporting the conservation of agricultural\n\
    inputs and reducing costs together with environmental impacts [2,13,24]. Another\
    \ man-\nagement tool, grid sampling, also involves the division of ﬁelds into\
    \ a grid and collecting\ndata at each intersection of the grid. This approach\
    \ provides representative information\nof the entire variation within a ﬁeld [11],\
    \ where such data are able to be used for site-\nAgriculture 2023, 13, 1593\n\
    5 of 26\nspeciﬁc management to optimize management practices precisely [7]. For\
    \ small-scale\nvariabilities of soil and crop features, a local resource management\
    \ (LRM) system was\ndeveloped with computer-aided farming (CAF), which translated\
    \ information into variable\nrate applications [11].\nThus far, humans have used\
    \ digital tools to enhance diagnosis and decision making\nwhile adding automated\
    \ machines for precise performing [14]. The accelerating changes of\nIndustry\
    \ 4.0 plus these digital technologies have granted the gradual automation of the\n\
    diagnosis and decision-making steps, limiting human involvement to only monitoring\n\
    (Figure 1) [6]. This revolution mostly targets optimal farming and variability\
    \ management\nin order to enhance production. However, fulﬁlling the food demand\
    \ should not rely solely\non “more production”. At the same time, it should be\
    \ consider “less wastage” of both the\ninputs and outputs of agricultural production\
    \ [3].\nAgriculture 2023, 13, x FOR PEER REVIEW \n5 of 28 \n \n \ninputs and reducing\
    \ costs together with environmental impacts [2,13,24]. Another man-\nagement tool,\
    \ grid sampling, also involves the division of ﬁelds into a grid and collecting\
    \ \ndata at each intersection of the grid. This approach provides representative\
    \ information \nof the entire variation within a ﬁeld [11], where such data are\

    3.1. Big Data\nPrecision agriculture systems are highly related to data and information\
    \ [5]. Gen-\nerally, unstructured and vast amounts of data are used by big business\
    \ industries, like\nsocial-networking sites, to learn or predict customer behaviors\
    \ accurately [4]. Similarly,\nin precision agriculture, big data analytics are\
    \ applied to understand data-intensive agri-\ncultural processes for decision\
    \ making [6], where analytic tools operate enormous data\nsets [4]. These analytic\
    \ tools consist of data mining, statistics, AI, predictive analytics,\nneural\
    \ language processing, etc. [4]. Big data science usually functions either with\
    \ ML,\ncloud computing, image processing, modeling and simulation, statistical\
    \ analysis, NDVI\nAgriculture 2023, 13, 1593\n7 of 26\nvegetation indices, or\
    \ GIS. These conjugations can discover correlations, patterns, and\ntrends from\
    \ large quantities of data via capturing, storing, exchanging, analyzing, and\n\
    marketing features of this high-performance informatics technology [6]. These\
    \ predictions\nand recommendations assist farmers with handling the upcoming outcomes,\
    \ risks, and\nchallenges in the agricultural industry [4]. Combining the data\
    \ in agricultural production\nprocesses creates traceability of product while\
    \ increasing product quality, including safety\nand taste. As customers are now\
    \ aware of the ecological footprint of agri-products, the\nabove combination supports\
    \ the increase in the demand for agricultural commodities [29],\nadding high market\
    \ value. Recent advancements of high-resolution remote sensing and\nintelligent\
    \ information and communication technologies, including social media (Facebook,\n\
    Twitter, Amazon, Instagram, etc.), have contributed to big data analytics in many\
    \ sectors,\nas well as in many stages in farming, including decision making, weather\
    \ forecasting,\nweather management, disaster management, smart management of resources,\
    \ disease and\npest interruption, and harvesting time predictions [4,6,30]. Moreover,\
    \ big data analytics\naid in implementing real-time forecasting in precision agriculture\
    \ [4]. However, data\nupdating, device security, correctness of data, accuracy\
    \ of data, availability of data, and\nsecurity elements, such as encryption, are\
    \ still barriers when combining big data with\nsmart farming [31]. Invalid data\
    \ can lead farmers to make costly, disruptive decisions\nand actions [5].\n3.2.\
    \ Machine Vision Technology\nPrecise and accurate data and information are the\
    \ driving components of precision\nagriculture. Recently, image analysis has become\
    \ a more reliable data source than man-\nual, labor-intensive, costly data-collecting\
    \ methods [22,32]. Here, machines can read and\nunderstand the real world through\
    \ pixel images and produce accurate site-speciﬁc informa-\ntion [31]. Machines\
    \ with ‘eyes’ in agricultural activities are called machine vision (MV). This,\n\
    also known as agro-vision or the ‘eyes’ of robots, provides non-destructive, robust,\
    \ rapid,\nand steady methods to monitor cultivation processes. MV systems give\
    \ machines their\nvision and judgement capabilities in image processing and data\
    \ extraction [10]. Although\nMV technologies have already been applied successfully\
    \ for crop species identiﬁcation,\ncrop stress detection, crop seed quality assessment,\
    \ weed detection, disease detection, etc.,\nthey are still at the prototype stage.\
    \ Currently, emerging deep-learning (DL) techniques in\ngrowing machine-learning\
    \ (ML) technologies are integrated with MV applications in order\nto develop intelligent\
    \ robots for multispectral imagery analysis and real-time analysis in\nﬁeld variable\
    \ rate applications [10,25]. Commercial smartphones, which are ubiquitous\namong\
    \ the human population, are able to be used in monitoring crop health and stress\n\
    based on MV systems [33].\n3.3. Internet of Things (IoT)\nThe IoT refers to a\
    \ network of interconnected items and technologies [16]. The IoT\nis one of the\
    \ most important technological advancements in precision agriculture and\nsmart\
    \ farming [5]. IoT architecture for agriculture, such as agricultural sensors\
    \ with\nICT and UAV, collects data for precision agriculture [31]. Also, the burgeoning\
    \ IoT and\nmobile data are the core of the fourth industrial revolution [10].\
    \ Meanwhile, advancements\nin communication technologies and wireless networks\
    \ (5G, LoRaWAN, NB-IoT, Sigfox,\nZigBee, and Wi-Fi) have broadened the application\
    \ of the IoT in diverse ﬁelds, such as\nreal-time remote control and high-throughput\
    \ phenotyping, while giving better coverage,\nbandwidth, connection density, and\
    \ end-to-end latency (Table 1) [8]. When it consolidates\nin agriculture together\
    \ with cloud computing, it results in smart farming [6] for various\nscopes of\
    \ livestock monitoring, smart greenhouses, ﬁshery management, and weather\ntracking\
    \ [8]. The IoT can be widely used in all areas of precision agriculture with the\n\
    development of sensors with independent intellectual property rights and the development\n\
    of smart devices, such as intelligent tractors, UAVs, and robots that can replace\
    \ high levels\nAgriculture 2023, 13, 1593\n8 of 26\nof manual labor input, performing\

    \ data, which are then uploaded to cloud information support systems to man-\n\
    Agriculture 2023, 13, 1593\n9 of 26\nage [4,13,16,28]. Those sensors can directly\
    \ combine with agricultural robots, autonomous\nplatforms, machines, and weather\
    \ stations for real-time monitoring [4]. With the IoT, UAVs\ncan respond promptly,\
    \ leading to high-quality, high-resolution, and exceptionally reliable\nobservations\
    \ through high-throughput 3D monitoring at different geographical areas. At\n\
    the same time, various kinds of agricultural sensor nodes, autonomous farm vehicles,\
    \ and\nmobile crowd sensing have been put forward based on the IoT for ground\
    \ and undersurface\ncognition [8]. Most IoT sensors in precision agriculture are\
    \ in wireless frameworks [13] or\nlow-power wide-area networks [8] and, hence,\
    \ can be used for on-site analysis [3], as well\nas mass data transfer, without\
    \ any interruptions [29,31]. Still, there are cost, operational,\ntechnical, and\
    \ data management difﬁculties in implementing the IoT in agricultural opera-\n\
    tions [13]. Designing low-cost, energy-efﬁcient, wireless IoT technologies in\
    \ autonomous\napplications is affected by the following dependencies: data latency\
    \ on power consump-\ntion, data scalability on storage and processing cost, and\
    \ data interoperability on cloud\ncompatibility to store and process various kinds\
    \ of data [13].\nDifferent IoT devices are coalesced as networks to achieve high-speed\
    \ data exchang-\ning [4,30]. Therefore, the development of an IoT framework can\
    \ also solve problems with\nbig data [31]. With more advancements, agricultural\
    \ operations like protecting, controlling,\nmonitoring, and detecting can be extended\
    \ using smart phones with the IoT [25]. As an\nexample, time-consuming cattle\
    \ status monitoring has also beneﬁted from the IoT, allowing\nfarmers to monitor\
    \ the health and welfare of animals. Also, weed detection through MV\nprimarily\
    \ consists of deep learning (DL) and image processing [16].\nEdge computing enables\
    \ affordable real-time data transmission in IoT precision agri-\nculture, reducing\
    \ data package size and alleviating strain on centralized cloud resources.\nInternet\
    \ and communication companies leverage their expertise to extend cloud service\n\
    capabilities to edge networks, shaping the edge computing landscape. Pioneers\
    \ like Cisco\nand Huawei have developed comprehensive frameworks and lightweight\
    \ computing sys-\ntems. The IoT connects objects through smart technologies, while\
    \ research explores aerial\nedge–IoT systems for improved convergence speed and\
    \ task completion rates [39–42].\n3.4. Artiﬁcial Intelligence (AI), Machine Learning\
    \ (ML), and Deep Learning (DL)\nAI has a key role in robotics and autonomous systems\
    \ (RASs). The development of\nAI in the IoT has contributed continuous data streams\
    \ [31]. To make agricultural data into\nmeaningful information in decision-making\
    \ data, mining techniques are required. Various\nenvironmental data and farming\
    \ historical records in big data are analyzed using AI, which\nﬁnds patterns that\
    \ are hidden in big data [29]. These discoveries are important in the pest\nidentiﬁcation,\
    \ disease detection, yield prediction, and fertilizing plans [25,31] included\
    \ in\nagricultural decision support systems. AI has noteworthy potential to accommodate\
    \ the\nreduction of food wastage, the improvement of production hygiene, and the\
    \ monitoring\nof machines in many stages of agriculture, such as supply chain,\
    \ agricultural production\npattern, and agricultural production process including\
    \ soil, crop, and water management,\nas well as disease and pest control [4,8].\
    \ Then, AI has the potential to overcome problems\nin conventional farming [31].\n\
    Both ML and DL are subconcepts of AI (Figure 3) [10]. With ML, a computer learns\n\
    independently to improve the performance of AI, which goes through explicit feature\n\
    extraction [6]. ML focuses on the theory, performance, and properties of learning\
    \ systems\nand algorithms, as it is a high-performance informatics technology\
    \ for quantifying and\nunderstanding data-intensive farming processes [6]. On\
    \ the other hand, DL can solve\nproblems with combinations of layers and nonlinear\
    \ functions [10]. To address limitations\nin the practical implementation of robots,\
    \ mobile terminals, and intelligent devices in\nmodern agriculture, the integration\
    \ of machine-learning algorithms has had signiﬁcant\nimprovement. With machine-learning\
    \ models, integration into mobile detection algorithms\nhas paved the way for\
    \ innovative and more precise detection methods, overcoming certain\nlimitations\

    \ machine-\nlearning models (Figure 3) that play a vital role in agricultural\

    \ have signiﬁcantly diverted from these AI, ML, DL, and MV\ntechnologies [10].\
    \ ML algorithms in big data are also critically essential because this\nintegration\
    \ can learn from data to create decisions, data-based prospects, and predictions.\n\
    Due to the intricate input data requirements of machine learning (ML) and deep\

    \ may encounter\nsigniﬁcant obstacles in terms of the time and cost involved in\
    \ gathering the necessary data\nAgriculture 2023, 13, 1593\n11 of 26\nfrom commercial\
    \ farms [1,6,30]. However, with the continuous advancement of IoT sensors,\nAI-based\
    \ autonomous machines or robots together with cloud computing, edge computing,\n\
    and blockchain can support overcoming this difﬁculty during the transforming,\
    \ storing,\nand processing of data in the creation of ML models [27,36,41]. Accordingly,\
    \ ML is able to be\nused to solve diverse issues in agriculture related to yield\
    \ prediction, crop quality, disease\ndetection, weed detection, species identiﬁcation,\
    \ animal welfare, livestock production,\nwater management, and soil management\
    \ [6,45]. Common principles of ML techniques\nare clustering, decision trees,\
    \ instance-based models, regression, artiﬁcial and deep neural\nnetworks, ensemble\
    \ learning, support vector machines, and Bayesian models [6]. A study\nproved\
    \ that ML was a powerful tool for analyzing data to monitor inputs and outputs\n\
    aiming to optimize plant tissue culture protocols [44].\nSmart farming is technology\
    \ that relies on its implementation with the use of AI and\nthe IoT in cyber-physical\
    \ farm management [28]. According to current applications, AI has\nbeen involved\
    \ in soil management, crop management, disease management, weed control,\netc.\
    \ Examples are the fuzzy-logic-based soil risk characterization decision support\
    \ system\n(SRCDSS), management-oriented modeling (MOM), artiﬁcial neural networks\
    \ (ANNs),\nCALEX, PROLOG, computer vision systems, ANN-GIS, invasive weed optimization\
    \ (IWO),\nand support vector machines [4]. One key application of AI is a mobile\
    \ expert system\nwhere farmers can use their smartphones for disease diagnosis,\
    \ species identiﬁcation, and\nsoil health analysis with the help of mobile apps.\
    \ In addition, AI is a real-time analyzer of\nsatellite images when the progress\
    \ of farming is tracked with satellite imagery [24]. With AI\napplications, precision\
    \ agriculture now has a scientiﬁc background, which helps to make\nprecision agriculture\
    \ more formalized to perform optimal agriculture outputs [29]. In the\nfuture,\
    \ AI may be improved to deal with the dynamic nature of agricultural microclimates,\n\
    as it is now facing difﬁculties ﬁnding a single standard solution for that heterogeneity.\n\
    The existing experience gap between AI researchers and farmers hinders the complete\n\
    understanding of agricultural problems and solutions. To eliminate this obstacle,\
    \ the\nknowledge of farmers, agricultural professionals, and AI researchers should\
    \ be linked.\nIn spite of this, accessibility and privacy protection problems\
    \ when working with huge\namounts of data should be addressed to deliver more\
    \ skillful AI [8,16].\n3.5. Guidance Systems\nGuidance systems use GPS (global\
    \ positioning system) technology to provide farmers\nwith real-time information\
    \ about their equipment locations and herd-grazing locations,\nenabling them to\
    \ optimize ﬁeld operations such as planting, harvesting, and herding [1,12].\n\
    The limited number of satellites, poor signal strengths, and lack of reliable\
    \ connectivity\nwere overcome by introducing a GNSS (global navigation satellite\
    \ system), which then re-\nplaced labor-intensive, time-consuming farm operations\
    \ with more effective methods, such\nas VRA [11,31]. Previously, agricultural\
    \ inputs were performed manually, and during Agri-\nculture 3.0, they were performed\
    \ mechanically using digitalized machines [2]. With rapid\ncommercialization,\
    \ agricultural machinery services have emerged that require efﬁcient\nmanagement\
    \ to prevent overuse or underuse issues. For the understanding of agricultural\n\
    machinery, GNSS plays a crucial role in optimizing effectivity and efﬁciency [46].\
    \ The\nnew trend of GNSS-enabled devices in the fully automated steering of tractions\
    \ is saving\ntime, labor costs, and money [2]. Precision agricultural robots require\
    \ high-resolution\nnavigation solutions [47]. Similarly, agricultural rovers and\
    \ robots are effective only when\nprecisely guided in their actions [45]. Some\
    \ studies introduced DL propagation models in\nGNSS fused with inertial navigation\
    \ data sets for precision agriculture [47]. One example\nis electric seeders with\
    \ optical ﬁber detection technology that were developed and tested\nsuccessfully\
    \ [3]. The new development of software-based farm management solutions\nfor GIS\
    \ encourage the automation of data collection and analysis of supervising, storing,\n\
    decision making, and farm management.\nAgriculture 2023, 13, 1593\n12 of 26\n\
    3.6. Blockchain Technology\nBlockchain is deﬁned as a decentralized, distributed\
    \ database that maintains a con-\ntinuously growing list of ordered records or\
    \ blocks, which was ﬁrst used in cryptocur-\nrency [15,48]. Blockchain offers\
    \ data transparency, immutability, and reliability, which\nimprove the mutual\
    \ trust between various parties in the supply chain [15]. As this technol-\nogy\
    \ eliminates the obstacles of corporations, this was introduced to precision agriculture,\n\
    increasing the easiness of the integration of digital technologies into agriculture.\
    \ This step\nprovides solutions to some technical challenges in smart farming,\
    \ furnishing the remote\nmonitoring and controlling of farm equipment through\
    \ the “IoT applied Greenhouse Moni-\ntoring System” [15,48]. One such challenge\
    \ is an insufﬁcient and insecure infrastructure for\ndata sharing. Another challenge\
    \ is the delay of remote-sensing satellites in detecting the\nvariability of croplands.\
    \ Therefore, as a solution for the above decentralization, anonymity,\nand security\
    \ problems in the IoT in smart farming, blockchain has been proposed, expect-\n\
    ing lightweight, distributed, decentralized, and transparent security and privacy\
    \ [5,48].\nBlockchain can assist with having a reliable, faster, and secure platform\
    \ to monitor farm\noperations, although it is still in its early stages of maturity\
    \ [15,48]. As information can be\ncommunicated securely in a distributed network\
    \ [48], with the help of blockchain this can\nimprove the planning of schedules\
    \ for various agricultural processes, such as irrigation\nwater sharing, energy\
    \ consumption, the incorporation of machines and labors, and tasks\nfor robot\
    \ coalitions and autonomous UAVs [15,28]. Especially in the food supply chain,\n\
    this is a crucial point because of food safety issues, as well as asymmetric and\
    \ fragmented\ninformation occurring related to the insufﬁcient supply chain [1,8,10].\n\
    3.7. Robotics and Autonomous Systems\nMost recently, autonomous farming has involved\
    \ a high degree of the use of robotics,\nsensors, drones, and remote sensing to\
    \ perform various agricultural tasks, such as planting,\nspraying, harvesting,\
    \ and weeding, while reducing labor costs and improving efﬁcient\ndecision making\
    \ [3,45]. RASs are a combination of emerging modern technologies that have\nkey\
    \ applications in both agricultural production processes and production patterns.\
    \ Mobile\nrobots equipped with various sensors, actuators, and ML algorithms are\
    \ key enablers to\nautomatically handle variability and uncertainty in farming\
    \ practices [47]. Key applications\nof RAS in agricultural patterns are in plant\
    \ factories, 3D food printing, and biodiverse\nfarming, whereas autonomous farming,\
    \ aerial monitoring, and automated husbandry\nhave become new applications in\
    \ agricultural production processes [8]. However, agricul-\ntural RASs are required\
    \ to be improved to fulﬁll efﬁcient work with accurate guidance,\nautonomous navigation,\
    \ and accurate detection of dynamic agricultural environments\n(changing appearances,\
    \ growth stages, weather conditions, object overlapping, etc.). Intelli-\ngent\
    \ actions, such as robot-assisted plant phenotyping, fruit counting, fruit harvesting,\
    \ fruit\ncounting, leaf peeling, selective spraying, and 3D mapping, are demonstrated\
    \ and currently\nemployed applications of RASs [8]. Auto-steered agricultural\
    \ vehicles are also used in\nmany ﬁeld operations [3], such as tilling, planting,\
    \ chemical applications, and harvesting.\nThese machines, like harvesters, sprayers,\
    \ tractors, planters, and mechanical weed controls,\nuse guidance systems either\
    \ with light bars [13] or a GNSS [2,20]. These guidance systems\nvisualize the\
    \ positions of equipment to prevent skips and overlaps, which is important in\n\
    variable rate applications.\n3.8. Artiﬁcial Satellites, Unmanned Aerial Vehicles\
    \ (UAVs), and Unmanned Ground\nVehicles (UGVs)\nArtiﬁcial satellites, such as\
    \ American Landsat satellites, the European Sentinel-2 Sys-\ntem, the RapidEye\
    \ constellation satellite system, the GeoEye-1 system, and WorldView-3,\nfor remote\
    \ sensing help to generate remotely accessible data in multispectral forms [8].\n\
    The establishment of these intelligent remote-sensing satellites has provided\
    \ full coverage\nfor collecting agricultural information [8,31,49]. More recently,\
    \ ubiquitous and affordable\ntechnologies such as drones, crews, and aircraft\
    \ have allowed images to be captured closer\nAgriculture 2023, 13, 1593\n13 of\
    \ 26\nto the ground and at a higher frequency, increasing detail and functionality\
    \ [45]. UGVs ac-\nquire high-resolution data for weed identiﬁcation and control,\
    \ selective pesticide spraying,\nsoil analysis, and crop scouting, while scouting\
    \ robots accomplish speciﬁc targets [49] such\nas mechanical weeding (Oz robot),\
    \ spraying (GUSS autonomous sprayer), fertilizing, map-\nping, and seeding (RowBot\
    \ system), as well as vineyard management (VineRobots) [4,50].\nInformation, including\
    \ imagery data generated by satellites, UAVs, and UGVs, is the\nparamount thing\
    \ in precision agriculture, as it supports vegetation patch identiﬁcation,\nweed\
    \ recognition, pest attack detection, observation of environmental stresses, and\
    \ accurate\nclassiﬁcation in VRT [18,45]. Not only that, in other agricultural\
    \ disciplines, such as aqua-\nculture, agroforestry, and forestry, imagery data\
    \ play a considerable role because they can\ncover large areas when gathering\
    \ information, and these data are reproducible [20]. Data\nfrom satellites, UAVs,\
    \ and UGVs are supported by detailed ground survey data processed\nwith ML and\
    \ DL algorithms in order to make them usable and meaningful information [18].\n\
    For example, in forestry, determining forest densities is labor-intensive and\
    \ time-\nconsuming, although it is an important parameter when combatting climate\
    \ change. Re-\ncently, data of tree type distribution could be achieved over a\
    \ wide area of forest with the\nhelp of hyperspectral images and NDVI and RGB\
    \ images from UAVs such as Sentinel-\n2 [13,16]. Likewise, in remote sensing satellites\
    \ and drones play a big role in monitoring\ndeforestation and obtaining accurate\
    \ coverage of vegetative types and classiﬁcation of\ntree species and are more\
    \ effective than other UAV or LiDAR data [14,34]. Although there\nare limitations,\
    \ drone and remotely piloted aircraft usage is dramatically increasing while\n\
    providing precise information for precision agriculture through hyperspectral\
    \ sensors,\nmultispectral cameras, and other novel technologies [14]. This is\
    \ a cost-effective, promising\nmethod for monitoring large-scale farms or crop\
    \ lands [4], as well as forest areas [14].\n3.9. High-throughput Phenotyping\n\
    High-throughput phenotyping has emerged as a promising approach to enhance\nprecision\
    \ agriculture by allowing the rapid and accurate measurement of plant traits [51]\n\
    quantitatively and qualitatively [22,52]. Accurate and high-throughput plant phenotyping\n\
    is important for accelerating crop breeding [52]. This technique uses advanced\
    \ technologies\nsuch as remote sensing [40,42], spectral imaging [41], and robotics\
    \ [53] to collect large\namounts of data on plant characteristics, such as growth\
    \ rate, yield, disease resistance, and\nmorphology [51,54,55]. By collecting and\
    \ analyzing these data, farmers can gain insights\ninto how their crops are performing\
    \ and make more informed decisions about things like\nfertilization, irrigation,\
    \ harvesting, and pest management [22,54]. High-throughput pheno-\ntyping can\
    \ also help breeders to develop new crop varieties that are better adapted to\
    \ local\ngrowing conditions and can produce higher yields (Figure 4) [51]. A full\
    \ range of visible\nand near-infrared hyperspectral data enables ML techniques\
    \ such as LSR (least squares\nregression) to predict speciﬁc biochemical and physicochemical\
    \ traits beyond simple vege-\ntative indices [56]. ML-based precision agriculture\
    \ systems have AI background [52,54],\nand therefore, when detecting diseases,\
    \ pests, nutrient deﬁciency, and weeds, stressed\nresponses are detected using\
    \ high-quality images generated with UGV or UAV remote\nsensing, hyperspectral\
    \ imaging, and satellite imaging to support high-throughput pheno-\ntyping [57].\
    \ Ultimately, high-throughput phenotyping has the potential to revolutionize\n\
    agriculture by enabling more the precise, real-time, and efﬁcient monitoring of\
    \ farming\npractices that can improve crop productivity, reduce environmental\
    \ impacts, and increase\nfood security [54].\nAgriculture 2023, 13, 1593\n14 of\

    \ satellite imaging to support \nhigh-throughput phenotyping [57]. Ultimately,\
    \ high-throughput phenotyping has the po-\ntential to revolutionize agriculture\
    \ by enabling more the precise, real-time, and eﬃcient \nmonitoring of farming\
    \ practices that can improve crop productivity, reduce environmen-\ntal impacts,\
    \ and increase food security [54]. \n \nFigure 4. Importance of high-throughput\
    \ phenotyping in agriculture. \nThe traditional methods of plant breeding have\
    \ limitations in terms of time, cost, and \naccuracy. HTP, on the other hand,\
    \ uses nondestructive and rapid methods to gather data \non a large number of\
    \ plants, allowing breeders to identify traits of interest more eﬃciently \n[58].\
    \ A study by Yang et al. (2017) [59] described using high-throughput phenotyping\
    \ \n(HTP) and quantitative trait locus (QTL) mapping to investigate the genetic\
    \ architecture \nof maize plant growth. The authors collected data on various\
    \ traits related to plant growth, \nsuch as plant height, leaf area, and biomass,\
    \ using HTP techniques, such as imaging and \nspectroscopy [59]. Unmanned aerial\
    \ systems (UASs) have brought about a revolutionary \nchange in ﬁeld high-throughput\
    \ phenotyping by providing a platform for diﬀerent sen-\nsors to collect remote-sensing\
    \ data in ﬁeld-scale trials. These sensors include regular RGB \ncameras, multispectral-imaging\
    \ cameras, hyperspectral-imaging cameras, thermal-imag-\ning sensors, and light\
    \ detection and ranging (LiDAR) sensors that enable the nondestruc-\ntive estimation\
    \ of plant traits, such as yield, biomass, height, and leaf area index. This is\
    \ a \nsigniﬁcant advancement in agriculture, allowing for the high-throughput\

    \ the frequency and through-\nput for phenotyping, while being cost-eﬀective and\
    \ providing high-resolution images as \ncompared to satellite-based techniques.\
    \ The phenotypic traits can be used to select crops \nwith high yield and strong\
    \ stress resistance, such as disease and salt resistance, ultimately \nleading\
    \ to improved production [60]. \nAs technology advances, the future of high-throughput\

    \ Evaluating the capabilities of 5G and 6G networks, including\ncurrent and future\
    \ support, is essential for identifying use cases and the requirements in\nthese\
    \ domains [34]. As an example, a study in Thailand designed telematics-equipped\n\
    tractors to assist farmers in efﬁciently managing their machinery, optimizing\
    \ performance\nand enhancing overall productivity. In addition to improved management\
    \ capabilities,\nthese tractors offered features such as theft prevention, effective\

    \ Successful Precision Agriculture Proposals and Implementations\nThe article\
    \ [63] reviewed advancements in automated fruit-harvesting robots for\nsweet peppers\
    \ and apples, highlighting the successful implementation of a sweet-pepper-\n\
    harvesting robot called ‘Harvey’, which effectively addressed detection, grasp\
    \ selection,\nand manipulation challenges. Similarly, the apple-harvesting robot\
    \ utilized a picking\nmanipulator and a catching manipulator, along with machine\
    \ vision and prioritization algo-\nrithms, for efﬁcient harvesting. The article\
    \ emphasized interdisciplinary collaboration for\nfurther advancements in automated\
    \ harvesting systems and the importance of intelligent\nsystems like deep learning\
    \ and crop management software for enhancing productivity and\nsustainability\
    \ in modern agriculture. Field trials were conducted with Harvey for sweet\npeppers\
    \ in Australia, while robotic picking systems for apples were tested in a Washing-\n\
    ton orchard in the U.S. [64,65]. Israel has successfully implemented autonomous\
    \ robotic\ntechnology in their crop ﬁelds, paving the way for the commercial use\
    \ of AI harvesters.\nTevel Aerobotics Technologies developed an autonomous fruit-picking\
    \ system that utilized\nﬂying robots tethered to an autonomous vehicle, enabling\
    \ accurate fruit picking, extended\nwork hours, and additional tasks like tree\

    industry. Tevel plans to introduce its innovative solution to the global market,\
    \ catering to\nfruit farmers worldwide and contributing to the growing agricultural\
    \ robotics sector [66].\nSenapathy et al. introduced the IoTSNA-CR model from\
    \ their study, which leveraged\nIoT technology to classify soil nutrients and\
    \ provide crop recommendations, aiming to\noptimize fertilizer usage and maximize\
    \ productivity for farmers. The implementation of\nAI harvesters in Israel showcases\
    \ the potential of artiﬁcial intelligence, machine learning,\ncloud services,\
    \ sensors, and automation for delivering real-time information and support\nto\
    \ farmers. The proposed IoTSNA-CR model incorporated IoT sensors, cloud storage,\n\
    machine-learning techniques, and an optimized algorithm (MSVM-DAG-FFO) to achieve\n\
    high accuracy in soil analysis. The model allowed farmers to maintain soil information\

    augmented reality tags for return and landing. The results demonstrated the feasibility\
    \ of\nthe architecture for automating inspections and improving pest control policies.\
    \ Challenges\nremain in addressing real-world conditions and optimizing image\

    \ labor costs and\nenhance efﬁciency. The improved mixer allowed remote monitoring,\
    \ updates, and alerts,\naiming to further streamline the organic fertilizer-mixing\
    \ process. A harvesting robot\nsystem for cherry tomatoes in greenhouses was developed\

    \ tests demonstrated an average picking time of 12 s per\nbunch of tomatoes with\
    \ a success rate of 83% [69]. Also, X. Jin et al. [70] designed a small-\nsized\
    \ vegetable seed electric seeder with power drive and optical ﬁber detection technology,\n\
    providing high efﬁciency and precision by monitoring sowing conditions in real-time\

    \ an approach for dynamic robot coalition that combined fuzzy coalition games\n\
    and smart contracts to form a dynamic and trusted coalition. It enabled the collection\n\
    and dissemination of information from robot sensors in a shared space. Integration\
    \ of the\nIoT with blockchain allows the continuous tracking of food in precision\

    tissue culture protocols for breeding purposes.\nA computer vision and deep-learning-enabled\
    \ weed detection model for precision\nagriculture was proposed in [25] integrating\
    \ computer vision, DL, the IoT and a smartphone.\nThe proposed CVDL-WDC technique\
    \ combined multiscale object detection and ELM-based\nweed classiﬁcation. The\
    \ results showed improved outcomes over recent approaches, and\nfuture extensions\
    \ included integration with IoT and smartphones.\nAt the same time, a novel procedure\
    \ involving machine learning and UAV-based\nimagery was developed to accurately\
    \ identify crops and weeds, offering potential integra-\ntion into autonomous\
    \ weed management systems and contributing to improved precision\nagriculture\
    \ practices with reduced resource consumption [45].\nAt Sairam Institute of Technology\
    \ in India, a ﬂood detection system based on the\nIoT, big data, and a convolutional\
    \ deep neural network (CDNN) was developed [30].\nThe CDNN algorithm demonstrated\
    \ superior accuracy, achieving an impressive accu-\nracy of 93.23%, a sensitivity\
    \ of 91.43%, a speciﬁcity of 91.56%, a precision of 92.23%,\na recall of 90.36%,\
    \ and an F-score of 91.28% with a data set of 500. The ﬂood detec-\ntion system\
    \ outperformed existing methods and holds potential for further enhancement\n\
    through the integration of IoT devices and advanced algorithms, ensuring improved\
    \ ﬂood\ndetection capabilities.\nAgriculture 2023, 13, 1593\n18 of 26\nIn order\
    \ to alleviate the strain on agri-food production, the introduction of alternative\n\
    nutrient sources can be explored, particularly through the utilization of cultured\
    \ meat and\n3D-printed meat as substitutes for traditional animal meats, thus\
    \ reducing the demand on\nanimal husbandry. In China, the production of lab-grown\
    \ meat using muscle stem cells\nnecessitated edible 3D scaffolds created through\
    \ electrohydrodynamic (EHD) printing,\nshowcasing the signiﬁcant potential of\
    \ prolamin scaffolds for cultivating cultured meat [74].\nSimilarly, the construction\
    \ of 3D-printed meat analogs from plant-based proteins has been\nconducted, improving\
    \ the printing performance of soy protein- and gluten-based pastes\nfacilitated\
    \ by rice protein. This study examined the rheological properties and printing\n\
    performances of edible inks made from soy protein isolate (SPI), wheat gluten\
    \ (WG),\nand rice protein (RP). Increasing the proportion of rice protein improved\
    \ the 3D-printing\nperformance, holding potential for the 3D printing of plant-based\
    \ foods and constructing\nmeat analogs simulating real meat properties [75].\n\
    Several studies have shown why the adaption rate of these studies is slow, and\n\
    one case study conducted in Chumphon Province, Thailand, by Kasetsart University\n\
    examined the adoption of smart farming technology among durian farmers, highlighting\n\
    that factors such as age, occupation, access to extension services, and farm size\
    \ inﬂuenced\ntechnology adoption, with younger farmers having larger farms being\
    \ more inclined to\nadopt technology, resulting in decreased labor and fertilizer\
    \ expenses, which emphasized\nthe importance of providing continuous training\
    \ and promoting extension services for\nsustainable adoption [76].\nTable 2. Studies\

    \ Agriculture\nHigh-tech technologies from the fourth industrial revolution have\
    \ the potential to\nrevolutionize the agriculture industry, enabling more efﬁcient\
    \ and sustainable practices\nAgriculture 2023, 13, 1593\n20 of 26\nwhile improving\
    \ productivity and reducing resource wastage. The adaptation of these\nintelligent,\
    \ advanced technologies in precision agriculture is still in its early stages,\
    \ and\nas such, there exist several barriers (Table 3) that must be addressed\
    \ to facilitate the\ntransformation of precision agriculture. However, it is essential\
    \ to carefully consider the\nspeciﬁc requirements, challenges, and implementation\
    \ considerations for each technology\nin the context of the agricultural operation\
    \ at hand.\nA lack of interdisciplinary skills is one of the major roadblocks,\
    \ as big data engineers,\ndata analysts, and data scientists do not have an agricultural\
    \ background. On the other\nhand, farmers with long experience and practical knowledge\
    \ are not educated enough to\nhandle high technology like artiﬁcial intelligence\
    \ [8]. The production and development\ncosts of high-tech applications and the\
    \ capital for establishing them in real-world agriculture\nare also high [78].\
    \ This high cost of the production and implementation of advanced\ntechnologies\
    \ may render them inaccessible to small-scale farmers, who may lack the\nﬁnancial\
    \ resources to invest in such technologies [79].\nFurthermore, the unavailability\
    \ of affordable technologies for small-scale farmers may\ncreate a digital divide,\
    \ where only large-scale, educated farmers may be able to beneﬁt from\nsuch technologies\
    \ [20,80]. In the unequal distribution of resources in the world, it is difﬁcult\n\
    for certain groups to reach for such new technological inventions. The implementation\n\
    of precision agriculture trends in many developing agricultural countries has\
    \ become a\ndifﬁcult task due to lack of necessary funds, lack of conﬁdence in\
    \ the technologies, lack of\nproper infrastructure, lack of necessary resources,\
    \ etc. [8,76,78,81]. Additionally, the lack of\nsufﬁcient energy in rural areas\
    \ hinders the use of new technologies, even as science strives\nto develop wireless\
    \ power transfer methods and ambient or on-site energy-generating\nmethods [8].\
    \ Furthermore, low digital literacy and unequal accessibility to digital tech-\n\
    nologies in rural areas, coupled with connectivity issues, pose signiﬁcant challenges\
    \ in\nestablishing sustainable intelligent technologies in agricultural processes\
    \ [20,79,82].\nLimited computer power, storage capacity, and processing speed\
    \ and high energy\nconsumption by batteries are some technical obstacles in precision\
    \ agricultural adapta-\ntions [43], especially when dealing with big data. In\
    \ addition, collecting and analyzing\ndata from agricultural operations may raise\
    \ concerns about data privacy and security [4].\nThese data are heterogenous and,\
    \ when transferring and storing vast amounts, software\nplatforms from private\
    \ companies are needed. This reveals some ownership controversies\nof data [78].\
    \ Blockchain interoperability, privacy problems, data leakage, cyber terrorism,\n\
    and some nonrepudiation issues associated with big data are still difﬁculties\
    \ in precision\nagriculture [5,8,78,83], thereby causing farmers to be reluctant\
    \ to share their data with\nthird-party service providers [4,16]. In many areas\
    \ where agriculture is practiced, reli-\nable internet connectivity, which is\
    \ essential for collecting, transmitting, and analyzing\ndata, may not be readily\
    \ available [7] and, thus, may affect the absorption capacities of\nnovel technologies\
    \ [80].\nThe implementation of trending technologies requires technical expertise\
    \ that may\nbe unavailable in some regions, leading to job displacement and unemployment\
    \ as new\ntechnologies increase the demand for highly skilled laborers while decreasing\
    \ opportunities\nfor nonskilled workers. This has implications for both small-scale\
    \ and family commercial\nfarmers [8,9,20,79]. To effectively use these technologies,\
    \ farmers and service providers\nmay need training. However, different technologies\
    \ may not be compatible with each other\nor with existing agricultural machinery\
    \ and equipment, which could limit the adoption\nof advanced technologies in precision\
    \ agriculture [2,8,84]. Furthermore, the presence of\nbias and discrimination\
    \ intertwined with information technology, education, risk-taking\nattitudes,\
    \ and western power structures constitute formidable obstacles, hindering the\n\
    equitable dissemination and advancement of smart-farming technologies, particularly\n\
    within developing nations [80,85]. This highlights the need for policies on data\
    \ sharing that\ncater to both the public and farming industries and are sufﬁcient\
    \ to ensure data security [20].\nAgriculture 2023, 13, 1593\n21 of 26\nTable 3.\

    \ years, the agricultural sector has recognized the potential beneﬁts of adopting\n\
    new digital technologies. However, the slow rate of adaptation can be attributed\
    \ to several\nroadblocks and uncertainties associated with these advancements.\
    \ Despite the challenges,\nthere is a growing demand for organic foods [78], leading\
    \ to a shift from sustainable\nagriculture to smart organic farming. To capitalize\
    \ on this emerging opportunity, certain\nsteps need to be taken.\nOne crucial\
    \ aspect is bridging the gap between expertise personnel and farmers. Pro-\nviding\
    \ better education, along with vocational training on novel technological applications,\n\
    can empower farmers to make effective use of new technologies [20,78]. Governments\
    \ can\nplay a signiﬁcant role by creating physical, economic, legal, and social\
    \ infrastructure that\nsupports the establishment of precision agriculture. Investments\
    \ in energy infrastructure\nand communication infrastructure, internet connectivity,\
    \ service markets, consultancy\nservices, and credit markets can instill trust\
    \ and willingness among farmers to embrace\nthese technologies [2,20,81].\nTo\
    \ further enhance precision agriculture, addressing the lack of professional agri-\n\
    cultural sensors is paramount. The design of high-quality, high-resolution, and\
    \ reliable\nsensors powered by the IoT that are speciﬁcally tailored for the agricultural\
    \ production\nenvironment and the monitoring of plant and animal physiological\
    \ signs is essential [8].\nMoreover, integrating wireless power transfer options\
    \ can eliminate the need for frequent\nbattery replacements. However, special\
    \ attention should be given to enabling underground\nor underwater transmission\
    \ capabilities [8]. At the same time, on-site energy generation\nwith renewable\
    \ solar power or biogas energy can be considered comparatively to long\ndistance\
    \ energy transfer [77]. Although capital investment is high for establishment,\
    \ it is\nmore proﬁtable than grid power.\nCross-technology communication is another\
    \ crucial aspect that needs to be addressed.\nMachine vision for animal monitoring,\
    \ the development of smart phone applications for the\nreal-time tracking of spatial\
    \ and temporal variations, and the utilization of 6G mobile net-\nworks are promising\
    \ avenues for generating valuable data and informed decisions [34,83].\nAdditionally,\
    \ the emergence of new agricultural systems such as smart hydroponics with\nthe\
    \ IoT and advancements in breeding technologies with DL and ML technologies con-\n\
    tribute to the overall progress of precision agriculture.\nFuture advancements\
    \ in precision agricultural technologies hold great promise for\nthe agricultural\
    \ sector. Overcoming the existing roadblocks and uncertainties is essential\n\
    to unlocking the full potential of these technologies. By focusing on education,\
    \ infras-\ntructure development, sensor technology, communication systems, and\
    \ novel agricultural\napproaches, we can pave the way for a more efﬁcient, sustainable,\
    \ and productive future\nin agriculture.\n7. Conclusions\nPrecision agriculture,\
    \ now part of Agriculture 4.0, harnesses the power of digitalization\nfor improved\
    \ farming management. The integration of Industry 4.0 technologies has led to\n\
    notable trends, such as drones, GPS technology, data analytics, and artiﬁcial\
    \ intelligence,\nenabling informed decision making in farming practices. Despite\
    \ these advancements,\nachieving a fully integrated agricultural management system\
    \ that comprehensively ad-\ndresses the complexities of the ﬁeld requires further\
    \ studies and innovations. Crucially,\nthe development of adaptive and predictive\
    \ information systems that effectively integrate\ndiverse data sources is essential\
    \ for ensuring sustainable and intelligent precision agri-\nculture. While precision\
    \ agriculture offers numerous beneﬁts, it also poses challenges for\nits widespread\
    \ adoption. The initial investment in technology, concerns related to data\nprivacy,\
    \ and compatibility issues with existing farming systems can be signiﬁcant barriers\n\
    for small-scale farmers. Moreover, the scalability and adaptability of these technologies\
    \ to\ndifferent farming conditions may limit their applicability in certain regions.\
    \ Overcoming\nAgriculture 2023, 13, 1593\n23 of 26\nthese challenges necessitates\
    \ the implementation of education and training programs to\nequip farmers with\
    \ the necessary skills to leverage these technologies effectively.\nThis review\
    \ paper serves as a valuable resource for farmers and companies seeking\nto adopt\
    \ Industry 4.0 technologies in agriculture. By providing insights into IoT devices,\n\
    automation systems, data analytics, and precision-farming techniques, this paper\
    \ fos-\nters awareness and understanding of the opportunities and challenges in\

    ABSTRACT \nIn the last few years, while the COVID-19 pandemic affects food supply\
    \ \nchains around the world, the agriculture sector also has faced many global\
    \ \nproblems, such as global warming, environmental pollution, climate \nchange,\
    \ and weather disasters. It has known that technological \nopportunities are available\
    \ for human beings to get out of these \npredicaments, solving the interconnections\
    \ between food-water-energy- \nclimate nexus, and achieving agricultural transformation\
    \ from traditional \nto digital. \n \nThe aim of this review is to gain holistic\
    \ solutions in a systematic \nview, based on water-energy-food resources to agricultural\
    \ digital \ntransformation that will play role in sustainable development. The\
    \ \ntransition from primitive to digital is given with road maps covering \nagricultural\
    \ and industrial revolutions at four stages on timeline. Digital \nagriculture\
    \ combined under precision agriculture and Agriculture 4.0 are \nhandled based\
    \ on domains covering monitoring, control, prediction, and \nlogistics. Digital\
    \ technologies are explained with application examples \nsuch as the Internet\
    \ of Things (IoT), cloud computing, big data, artificial \nintelligence, decision\
    \ support systems, etc. Wearable sensor technologies, \nreal-time monitoring systems\
    \ tracking whole conditions of animals in \nlivestock, the IoT-based irrigation\
    \ and fertilization systems that help \nenhance the efficiency of irrigation processes\
    \ and minimize water and \nfertilizer losses in agricultural fields and greenhouses,\
    \ blockchain-based \nelectronic agriculture, and solutions based on drones and\
    \ robotics that \nreduce herbicide and pesticide use are handled systematically.\
    \ Moreover, \nrenewable energy technologies to be provided synergy between \n\
    technologies such as agrivoltaics and aquavoltaics combining food and \nenergy\
    \ production in rural are explained, besides solar-powered pivot and \ndrip irrigation\
    \ systems and environmental monitoring systems. As a \nresult, for a sustainable\
    \ future, technological innovations that increase \ncrop productivity and improve\
    \ crop quality, protect the environment, \nprovide efficient resource use and\
    \ decrease input costs can help us facing \nin agriculture of today overwhelm\
    \ many the economic, social, and \nenvironmental challenges.  \n \nKeywords: Smart\

    \ feed, fibers, fuel, and raw materials by cultivating plants and breeding livestock\
    \ is one of the oldest \nand most vital sources in the civilization of human beings\
    \ and in the economic growth of each country that forms the backbone. \nThe latest\
    \ FAO report (FAO 2017a) emphasized that the world's population will be near 10\
    \ billion by 2050, and agriculture will \nbe a more deeply key role each day for\
    \ the continuation of life and socio-economic development. It has been predicted\
    \ that \nincreases in food, water and energy demands will be 60% (FAO 2012), 55%\
    \ (OECD 2012) and 50% (EIA 2019) by 2050, \nrespectively. \n \nAt global level,\
    \ while consuming approximately 30% of the total energy in during agri-food production,\
    \ this causes nearly \none third of GHG emissions (FAO 2020; Platis et al. 2019).\
    \ Global food systems are responsible for about 25% to 42% of all \nglobal greenhouse\
    \ gas (GHG) emissions emitted during production, processing, transportation, packaging,\
    \ consuming, and \ndisposing of food according to a study carried out for the\
    \ years 1990-2015 (Crippa et al. 2021). \n \nWhile agriculture is the pillar of\
    \ food security, it is the largest user of freshwater that affects energy security\
    \ (Tian et al. \n2018). Global projections indicate that the demand for clean\
    \ water, energy, and food will increase significantly in the coming \nyears (Hoff\
    \ 2011).  \n \nToday, agriculture accounts for 70% of global freshwater use and\
    \ 34% of land use, putting unsustainable pressure on our \nnatural resources (Lee\
    \ 2019). Also, water use is 80-90% in the agri-food sector including irrigation\
    \ (FAO 2016; Bundschuh et \nal. 2107). But irrigation only amounts can reach as\
    \ much as 95 percent in some developing countries (Mohtar & Daher 2016; \nFAO\
    \ 2017b). \n \nDayıoğlu & Türker - Journal of Agricultural Sciences (Tarim Bilimleri\
    \ Dergisi), 2021, 27(4): 373-399 \n374 \n \nWater plays a key role in socioeconomic\
    \ development that strongly connects food and energy (Daher et al. 2019). Industry\
    \ \nconsumes 22% of water resources, most of which is used for cooling thermal\
    \ processes in electricity generation (EIA 2016). If \naction is not taken now,\
    \ such expanding gap between resource supply and demand would be further occurs\
    \ deep problems related \nto continuous population growth, climate change and\
    \ extreme climatic events, socio-economic development.  \n \nBoth agricultural\
    \ activities and production of food consume at large amounts of water and energy\
    \ (Roidt & Avellán 2019). \nTherefore, water, energy, and food (WEF) are three\
    \ strategic resources for the sustainable development of national economies \n\
    (Purwanto et al. 2019). It is becoming increasingly difficult to ensure sufficient\
    \ WEF with the impact of climate change, \npopulation growth, changing diets,\
    \ urbanization, and aging (Zhang et al. 2018; Alcon et al. 2019).  \n \nAgriculture\
    \ is also a major source of water pollution from nutrients, pesticides, and other\
    \ contaminants, which if unmanaged \ncan lead to significant social, economic,\
    \ and environmental costs (FAO 2017). In the recent decades, agriculture is beset\
    \ by two \nmajor discrepancies: the first conflict is between resources supply\
    \ and demand, while the second conflict is between economic \ndevelopment and\
    \ environmental protection (Yue & Guo 2021). \n \nIn recent years, global climate\
    \ change has caused many irregular and extreme weather events in many parts of\
    \ the world (Li \net al. 2021). As a result of global warming, intense drought,\
    \ severe hurricanes and storms, and extreme floods have begun to be \nexperienced\
    \ intensely in different parts of the world (FAO 2021). In addition, the success\
    \ of crop and animal production varies \ndepending on the short and long-term\
    \ complex environmental effects of global warming and climate change (Hatfield\
    \ et al. \n2011). In many places of the world, plants are negatively affecting\
    \ by climate conditions that are very hot or very cold, and wet \nor dry (Hatfield\
    \ et al. 2015; FAO 2019). Rising seed, fertilizer prices and wages, epidemic and\
    \ vegetative diseases, trade wars, \nflash floods, heatwaves, and other weather\
    \ changes negatively affect agriculture. To meet these challenges and meet the\
    \ demands \nof the future, countries need to develop policies and programs in\
    \ a sustainable way. \n \nIn a report published by UNECE (2021), it was emphasized\
    \ that demographic, economic, social, and climatic changes, were \nall exerting\
    \ increasing pressure on natural resources, including through a seemingly ever-growing\
    \ global demand for energy, \nfood, and water that threatens the ecosystems. As\
    \ a solution, the key to shifting towards sustainable development was highlighted\
    \ \nthat lies in the strategic decisions to be taken regarding natural resources,\
    \ which need to be better valued and more responsibly \nmanaged. \n \nAmong literature\
    \ studies reviewed, no article has been found that analyzes in view of systematic\
    \ and holistic related to digital \ntransition and transformation for a sustainable\
    \ future in agriculture. Most of the literature focuses on individual integration\
    \ of \nAgriculture 4.0 technologies and their applications in different sectors.\
    \ This review aims to close the study gap with a systematic \napproach, analyzing\
    \ digital technologies in agriculture for a sustainable future based on “Energy-Water-Food”\
    \ Nexus. \n \nThe rest of this paper is organized as follows. Section 2 gives\
    \ the development roadmap of industrial revolutions and \nagricultural revolutions.\
    \ Section 3 introduces sustainable food and agriculture, water-energy-food nexus,\
    \ and digital \ntransformation concepts. Section 4 discusses precision agriculture\
    \ and Agriculture 4.0 topics under the smart farming heading, \ncovering novel\
    \ technologies, digital transition and challenges. Section 5 introduces renewable\
    \ energy and environmental \ntechnologies, new combined solutions; and discussion\
    \ and conclusions are presented in the 6th and 7th sections, respectively. \n\
    \ \n2. Agricultural and Industrial Revolutions \n \nThe expression Industry 4.0\
    \ was used to point out new tsunami of technological progress that was defined\
    \ in 2015 by Schwab \nas the “fourth industrial revolution” (Schwab 2015). While\
    \ the first industrial revolution in the 18th century was characterized \nby transition\
    \ from an agricultural economy to an industrial economy, the second industrial\
    \ revolution covered from water and \nsteam power to electric power (Adebanjo\
    \ et al. 2020). \n \nThe evolution of agriculture, from the primitive level to\
    \ the advanced level of today, took place gradually over time. Figure \n1 shows\
    \ together schematic timelines of both industrial revolutions and agricultural\
    \ revolutions. Technological developments in \nagriculture are divided into 4\
    \ long-term and named the transformation from Agriculture 1.0 to Agriculture 4.0\
    \ (Liu et al. 2021). \nDayıoğlu & Türker - Journal of Agricultural Sciences (Tarim\
    \ Bilimleri Dergisi), 2021, 27(4): 373-399 \n          375 \n \n \n \nFigure 1-\
    \ Time lines of industrial revolutions and agricultural revolutions (Liu et al.\
    \ 2021) \n \nPeriod that is conventional agriculture practices from antique ages\
    \ when farmers mostly used domestic hand tools for \ncultivation mainly relying\
    \ on manpower and animal forces to the end of the 19th century is accepted as\
    \ Agriculture 1.0. \n \nAgriculture 2.0 is referred as the period that is the\
    \ increase food production and reduce hand jobs between 1784 and almost \n1870,\
    \ when agricultural machinery was used for soil tillage, sowing, weeding, irrigation,\
    \ and harvesting (Liu et al. 2021). \n \nAfter passing from the main steam power\
    \ to oil and gas power, the industry 2.0 period of the 20th century started. Due\
    \ to \ndevelopments in the energy and transportation sectors, agricultural products\
    \ were started shipping to long distances. Resulting, \nfar communities connected\
    \ together and new agriculture markets emerged that farmers can sell their produce\
    \ (Liu et al. 2021). \nThe first assembly line that significantly increased efficiency\
    \ and productivity was set up for mass production (Zhai et al. 2020). \nThe first\
    \ agricultural mass production was applied to meat production in livestock. All\
    \ these developments provided making for \nlarge-scale intensive animal farming.\
    \ \n \n“The Green Revolution” era, namely Agriculture 2.0, is the phase of farming\
    \ that began in the late 1950s when new agronomic \nmanagement practices, new\
    \ synthetic pesticides, and fertilizers were used in agricultural fields and various\
    \ machines were \nmanually operated by farmers (Zambon et al. 2019). Thus, yields,\
    \ productivity, and returns increased at all levels (CEMA 2017a). \nAlthough increased\
    \ productivity and improved efficiency were achieved thanks to mechanization,\
    \ all of them, overconsumption \nof fossil fuels, water, and chemicals caused\
    \ the destruction of the environment. Indeed, still today, mankind continues the\
    \ \ndevastations with effects so great that it changes the climate in many parts\
    \ of the world.  Furthermore, the first programmable \nlogic controller (PLC)\
    \ was used in industry in 1969, depending on electronics and on information technology\
    \ (Yülek 2018). \n \nAgriculture 3.0, called also \"Precision Farming\" emerged\
    \ thanks to advances carried out on computing and electronics. These \ndevelopments\
    \ provided saving on energy in machinery use of and saving on the water in irrigation,\
    \ and reducing in use of \nchemicals in the field and, thanks to increasing operational\
    \ performance of agricultural systems (Ahmad & Nabi 2021). \nAccording to the\
    \ definition of the International Society of Precision Agriculture (PA), “Precision\
    \ Agriculture is a management \nstrategy that gathers, processes, and analyses\
    \ temporal, spatial, and individual data and combines it with other information\
    \ to \nguide site, plant, or animal-specific management decisions to improve resource\
    \ efficiency, productivity, quality, profitability and \nsustainability of agricultural\
    \ production.” (ISPA 2021). \n \nAlthough agriculture has been affected from every\
    \ era of industrial revolutions, it should be noted the digital transformation\
    \ \nin the agriculture sector started with PA. Today, the agricultural sector\
    \ is experiencing a new revolution, called Agriculture 4.0 \nfrom with the affecting\
    \ of digital technologies also in \"Industry 4.0\" entered our life in 2011. \
    \ \n \n3. Sustainability for Future  \n \n \nUnited Nations (UNs) called for a\
    \ universal action plan related to Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) adopted\
    \ on 25 \nSeptember 2015 to end poverty, protect the planet, and improve the lives\
    \ of everyone, everywhere. The 17 goals are part of the \n2030 Agenda for Sustainable\
    \ Development. This agenda sets out a 15-year (2016-2030) plan to achieve the\
    \ goals. These were \nDayıoğlu & Türker - Journal of Agricultural Sciences (Tarim\
    \ Bilimleri Dergisi), 2021, 27(4): 373-399 \n376 \n \nplanned to help measure\
    \ progress in each of the 193 countries that agreed to work towards achieving\
    \ the goals. SDGs 17 targets \nare illustrated holistically in Figure 2 (United\
    \ Nations 2015).   \n \nAs highlighted in report prepared by The World in 2050\
    \ initiative, governments that signed the 2030 agenda of the Sustainable \nDevelopment\
    \ Goals (SDGs) and the Paris Agreement on Climate Change are calling for profound\
    \ transformations that will \nrequire complementary actions from civil society,\
    \ science and business (TWI2050 2018). \n \n \n \nFigure 2- Sustainable Development\
    \ Goals numbered according to icons accepted by United Nations (United Nations\
    \ 2015) \n \nSetting off to carry out the activities in The World in 2050 initiative,\
    \ Sachs et al. (2019) presented six SDG transformations \nto achieve SDG targets.\
    \ Among which, Transformation 4 has taken attention as one of the key parts covering\
    \ sustainable food, \nland, water, and oceans. Transformation 6 covers the digital\
    \ revolution for sustainable development comes forward as a foremost \nforce that\
    \ makes a difference, also it has been also pointed out as the Fourth Industrial\
    \ Revolution. \n \nIn Trends in Biotechnology published in 2021, it emphasized\
    \ that biotechnology to be coupled with digital technologies will \nplay a key\
    \ role in transforming current land-use systems in the future (Goh et al. 2021).\
    \ \n \n3.1. Sustainable food and agriculture  \n \nThe FAO has established five\
    \ basic principles that will provide to become increasingly productive and sustainable,\
    \ building a \nproduction system that works in favour of the ecosystem, satisfying\
    \ human needs to achieve 2030 SDG targets. FAO’s five basic \nprinciples are:\
    \ (1) Increasing productivity, employment, and value addition in food systems,\
    \ (2) Protecting and enhancing natural \nresources, (3) Improving livelihoods\
    \ and fostering inclusive economic growth, (4) Enhancing the resilience of people,\
    \ \ncommunities, and ecosystems, and (5) Adapting governance to new challenges\
    \ (FAO 2018). \n \nMoreover, the 20 practical and interconnected actions integrated\
    \ by FAO (2018) are prepared for decision-makers to provide \ntransformations\
    \ related to the 2030 Agenda SDGs. \n \nThe 2030 SDGs comprise the aims related\
    \ to food (SDG 2), water (SDG 6), energy (SDG 7), climate change (SDG 13), and\
    \ \necosystem (SDG 15). Policies and programs managers to be developed by managers\
    \ will sign managing of resources in future \nin the way a more sustainable one.\
    \ Nevertheless, there are many operational difficulties. Holistic systematic analyses\
    \ are needed \nto obtain comprehensive solutions covering problems related to\
    \ the water-energy-food-climate. Future farming will be built on \nfour main pillars\
    \ are follows (1) Improving productivity, (2) Rational use of resources, (3) Adaptation\
    \ to climate change, and (4) \nAvoidance of food waste (FAO 2018). \n \n3.2. Water-Energy-Food\
    \ Nexus \n \nEnergy, water and food security have been identified as three of\
    \ the key resources in achieving the United Nations' sustainable \ndevelopment\
    \ goals (Babatunde et al. 2019). Therefore, the water-energy-food nexus has been\
    \ proposed as a conceptual tool for \nachieving sustainable development. Many\
    \ developing countries has faced many challenges to meet the demands increasing\
    \ for \nhealthy food, clean water and green energy due to the climate change.\
    \ An effective solution can only be achieved through \nsustainable use of vital\
    \ resources such as land, water, and energy (Rasul & Sharma 2016). \n \nDayıoğlu\
    \ & Türker - Journal of Agricultural Sciences (Tarim Bilimleri Dergisi), 2021,\
    \ 27(4): 373-399 \n          377 \n \nWater, energy, and food are resources that\
    \ are unavoidably connected with each other. Impacts on only one resource can\
    \ also \ncause changes in the other ones. The increasing global population, energy\
    \ demands, freshwater resources, and food supply \nemphasize the significance\
    \ of this topic. The Water-Food-Energy (WEF) Nexus concept was introduced by Hoff\
    \ in the World \nEconomic Forum held in the Bonn in 2011 to take measures pointing\
    \ out the problems the world may face and to address the \nlinks between water\
    \ and economic development (Hoﬀ 2011). In recent years, the WEF nexus has become\
    \ an independent \ntechnical term due to its growing popularity. The interdependent\
    \ and complex interactions of these three basic resources are \ncalled as the\
    \ water-energy-food nexus (Zhang and Vesselinov 2016; Bieber et al. 2018). Solutions\
    \ of challenges concerning food, \nwater, and energy have to be planned to meet\
    \ current and future socio-economic demands at local, regional, national, and\
    \ global \nscales for sustainable development (Bazilian et al. 2011; FAO 2014;\
    \ Howells et al. 2013; IRENA 2015; Cevher 2019; Namany \net al. 2021). Figure\
    \ 3 shows connections water-energy-food nexus, interactions among WEF. \n \nThere\
    \ are technological solutions based on nexus models for rural and urban fields\
    \ (Lehmann 2018), sensor applications \n(Abegaz et al. 2018), renewable energy\
    \ (IRENA 2015), and greenhouse monitoring (Asolkar & Bhadade 2015). Moreover,\
    \ if \nknowing the interconnections between the three elements of the Nexus, it\
    \ can be determined which resource should be shared in \nwhat proportion for sustainable\
    \ production, how taking temporal and spatial strategical decisions. (Tian et\
    \ al. 2018; Zhang et al. \n2018; Ravar et al. 2020, Norouzi & Kalantari 2020;\
    \ Keyhanpour et al. 2021; Yue et al. 2021). \n \n \n \nFigure 3- Water-energy-food\
    \ nexus, interactions among WEF (modified from Bieber 2018). \n \n3.3. Digital\
    \ Transformation  \n \nAccording to FAO and World Bank reports, digital transformation\
    \ can be used to solve challenges that are faced in agriculture \nand in rural\
    \ areas (WB 2019; Trendov et al. 2019). Thanks to a well-planned transition towards\
    \ smart farming (Klerkx & Rose \n2020), this transformation can contribute to\
    \ agri-food systems (Klerkx and Begemann 2020). Digital transformation is a concept\
    \ \nthat defines the process of finding solutions to social and sectoral needs\
    \ with the integration of digital technologies, and \naccordingly the development\
    \ and change of workflows and culture (ElMassaha & Mohieldin 2020). Digitalization\
    \ is defined as \nthe socio-technical process providing with using digital innovations.\
    \ In the agricultural sector, numerous notions have emerged \nto define different\
    \ forms of digitalization in agri-food production systems (Klerkx et al. 2019).\
    \  \n \nThese are Precision Farming (McBratney et al. 2005; Aubert et al. 2012;\
    \ Eastwood et al. 2017), Smart Farming (Wolfert et \nal. 2017), Agriculture 4.0\
    \ (Rose & Chilvers 2018; De Clercq et al. 2018; Zambon et al. 2019; Zhai et al.\
    \ 2020; Raj et al. 2021; \nRijswijk et al. 2021; Rose et al. 2021). Moreover,\
    \ synonyms of Agriculture 4.0 are “Numerical Agriculture” (Agriculture \nNumérique)\
    \ in France (Klerkx et al. 2019), “Smart Farming” in many countries of the European\
    \ Union, “Digital Agriculture” in \nAustralia and New Zealand (Keogh & Henry 2016;\
    \ Shepherd et al. 2018; Fielke et al. 2020; Fleming et al. 2021). These concepts\
    \ \nhave defined as the \"Digital Agricultural Revolution\" by Food and Agriculture\
    \ Organization (FAO) (Trendov et al. 2019) \n \nAccording to CEMA (2018), Digital\
    \ Farming is the transformation from Precision Farming to end to end connectable,\
    \ \nknowledge-based farm production systems. CEMA explains that Digital Farming\
    \ has a similar structure to Industry 4.0. \nHowever, there are many aspects of\
    \ production parameters in agriculture that are different from industry. Agriculture\
    \ is mostly \nDayıoğlu & Türker - Journal of Agricultural Sciences (Tarim Bilimleri\
    \ Dergisi), 2021, 27(4): 373-399 \n378 \n \ndefined with environmental and biological\
    \ factors, and therefore its physical specifications should be basically considered\
    \ \n(CEMA 2017a; 2017b). \n \nLioutas et al. (2021) presented the beneficial and\
    \ negative aspects of digitalization. They also indicated the necessity to \n\
    develop new approaches based on science in terms of societal impacts in the evolution\
    \ of digital agriculture. \n \nPylianidis et al. (2021) reported a review on digital\
    \ twins in agriculture in the period 2017-2020. They defined the unique \ncharacteristics\
    \ of agricultural digital twins and pointed out that digitalization will provide\
    \ multiple gains in terms of productivity \nand sustainability to the agricultural\
    \ sector.  \n \nFielke et al. (2019) explained that more comprehensive effects\
    \ due to agricultural innovation and digitalization and pointed \nout that the\
    \ main themes covering socio-technical dimensions of digitalization in agricultural\
    \ production practices are \nconnectivity, transparency, and governance. \n \n\
    Four key technologies that will be an active role in the future of digital farming\
    \ are (1) vision and sensors, (2) automation \nand robotics (3) digitization and\
    \ big data, (4) biological actors. At the heart of all these key technologies\
    \ is the achievement of \nhigh efficiency in connectivity (Berger 2019). \n \n\
    3.3.1. Connectivity \n \nAgricultural digital transformation is one of the topics\
    \ that have political priority on a global scale (WB 2017; WB 2019; Trendov \n\
    et al. 2019). According to the European Commission Report (EC 2017), one of the\
    \ targets of the EU is to connect farmers end \nto end to the digital economy\
    \ to succeed in the sustainable evolving of food and farming.  \n \nThe digital\
    \ connectivity in agricultural knowledge networks and agro-food value exchange\
    \ will increase using novel tools \nsuch as digital hardware and software (Fielke\
    \ et al. 2019). As shown in Figure 4, all three of these technologies-sensors,\
    \ robotic \nautomation, and digital data work together and are enabled by adequate\
    \ connectivity as well as advances in edge computing and \nthe cloud. At the heart\
    \ of all these key technologies is the achievement of high efficiency in connectivity\
    \ (Berger 2019). \n \n \n \nFigure 4- Four key technology levers to drive improvements\

    \ \n3.3.2. Transparency \n \nTransparency in agricultural practices is important\
    \ for all stakeholders in the agricultural sector including consumers, and \n\
    regulators, in terms of deep connectivity and informational interaction between\
    \ them (Fielke et al. 2019). Agricultural knowledge \nand advice networks digitalized\
    \ will be crucial in terms of the transformation of agricultural innovation (Wolfert\
    \ et al. 2017). \nDigital information flows transfer with transparency to everywhere\
    \ will provide trust between farmers themselves and \ninteractions with technologies\
    \ (Kelton et al. 2008; Sligo & Massey 2007). Transparency is need due to providing\
    \ informational \ninteraction with extensive connectivity between them (Wolfert\
    \ et al. 2017). \n \n3.3.3. Governance \n \nIt is known that challenges appear\
    \ in balancing the priorities in terms of sustainable development in the agriculture\
    \ sector as \nagri-food systems digitalize. In order to solve these, planning\
    \ between public and private organizations will require (Carolan \n2018; Regan\
    \ 2019), considering socio-ethical factors to meet public and private goals in\
    \ the agricultural sector (Fielke et al. \n2019). Past experiences in agricultural\
    \ decision support systems have seen that without the contributions of all stakeholders\
    \ in \nthe agricultural sector including social systems it will not be a sufficient\
    \ solution (Fielke et al. 2018; Klerkx et al. 2017). \n \n4. Smart Farming \n\
    \ \nImprovements in both hardware and software technology open a new chapter in\
    \ agriculture, especially when it comes to sensors, \nbiologicals, robotic & automation,\
    \ and digital data. PA is a part of smart farming technologies including agricultural\
    \ \nmanagement, information systems, and automation and robotics (Balafoutis et\
    \ al. 2020; Klerkx et al. 2019; Rose & Chilvers \n2018). \n \n4.1. Precision Agriculture\
    \  \n \nPA is the management of spatial and temporal variability through using\
    \ advanced technologies to precisely match agricultural \ninputs to increase economic\
    \ gains and lessen environmental impacts. \n \nPA not only offers solutions to\
    \ address many of the problems posed, exacerbated and exposed by this global crisis,\
    \ it also \nhas the potential to be an invaluable tool for rebuilding and strengthening\
    \ the efficient and sustainable food systems of tomorrow. \nPrior to PA, farmers\
    \ homogeneously managed their inputs such as seed, fertilizer, pesticide and irrigation\
    \ despite existing within-\nfield variability in soil properties, crop stress\
    \ and crop yield. Beginning in the 1990s, after the emergence of PA, farmers were\
    \ \nable to divide their heterogeneous areas into smaller units that were relatively\
    \ homogeneous. Knowing all the historical data of \nan area can help growers adopt\
    \ a PA approach and adjust their input to benefit their land, increase profitability\
    \ and reduce their \noverall environmental impact. PA offers the use of satellite\
    \ technologies that allow real-time management of crops, fields and \nanimals\
    \ (Talepbour et al. 2015).  \n \nIn the light of the developments it has shown\
    \ from the emergence of PA to the present day, it develops agricultural \nmanagement\
    \ by making use of various perspectives. These perspectives are listed below.\
    \ \n \na) Agronomic perspective: considering the real needs of the crop in the\
    \ regulation of cultural practices (for example; better \nfertilization management).\
    \ \nb) Technical perspective: establishing better time management at farm level\
    \ (for example; planning of agricultural activities). \nc) Environmental perspective:\
    \ reducing agricultural effects (to more accurately estimate the soil's need for\
    \ nitrogen to limit \nnitrogen flow). \nd) Economic perspective: increasing productivity\
    \ or reducing the amount of input, increasing the efficiency of the yield (for\
    \ \nexample; making nitrogen fertilization application at low cost). \n \nRecently,\
    \ various technologies related to PA have developed technologies like GPS systems,\
    \ yield mapping, smart sensors, \nand automatic steering systems. As expected,\
    \ these systems were developed for the farmer to increase yields, save nutrients\
    \ and \nso as to make efficient sensing and decision support systems that can\
    \ increase profitability on the farm and reduce negative \nenvironmental impact.\
    \ PA supports reduced tillage and other cost and labor-saving novel technologies.\
    \ Along with the latest \ndevelopments in semi-autonomous systems and agricultural\
    \ robots in this process, it seems that the process has accelerated \namong farmers.\
    \ Figure 5 shows the connections between different technical systems and sensors,\
    \ especially from geolocation \nand sensing systems to decision support, variable-rate\
    \ operation, and route planning among emerging technologies in PA \n(Pedersen\
    \ 2017). \n \nFrontier technologies used in PA for long time have four main phases\
    \ that span almost all agricultural applications. These \nfour main stages and\
    \ related technologies (Balafoutis et al. 2020); \n \nDayıoğlu & Türker - Journal\
    \ of Agricultural Sciences (Tarim Bilimleri Dergisi), 2021, 27(4): 373-399 \n\
    380 \n \n1. Guidance technologies- These include all types of automatic guidance\
    \ for tractors and self-propelled agricultural \nmachinery such as driver assistance,\
    \ controlled traffic in agriculture, developed based on hardware and software.\
    \ \n2. Information management- Measurement is essential for accurate farming and\
    \ better control results. Measurement systems \nconsist of sensors that can be\
    \ mounted on ground-based stations and attached to aerial or satellite platforms.\
    \ They collect \nspatial information including soil mapping, canopy mapping, and\
    \ yield mapping, also soil moisture mapping. Knowledge \nmanagement will enable\
    \ farmers to perform PA more efficiently and comfortably. If the connection between\
    \ the digital \nand the physical farm is not made right, there can always be a\
    \ shortage of precision farming among farmers. \n3. Application technologies-\
    \ These involve technologies such as variable rate irrigation and variable rate\
    \ application \ntechnologies for nutrients, crop protection agents, irrigation,\
    \ seeding, and precision weed control, developed based on \nhardware and software.\
    \ \n4. Data analysis technologies- These are used for the analysis of data gathered\
    \ through data collection. Related technologies \nare: \n \n- Management zone\
    \ definition \n- Decision support systems (DSS) \n- Farm management information\
    \ systems (FMS) \n \n \n \nFigure 5- Major digital systems used in precision agriculture\
    \ (Pedersen 2017) \n \nInternational experiences and survey studies show that\
    \ Aided Steering Systems (ASS) tend to be the first technologies \nadopted by\
    \ farmers, due to their relative simplicity and the tangible benefits in terms\
    \ of reduced fuel consumption and inputs as \nwell as increased labour productivity\
    \ (less driver fatigue, working during night, etc.) (Say et al. 2017). Recording\
    \ technologies \nare increasingly available through remote sensing from satellites\
    \ and drones even though their use by individual farmers is still \nlimited. Field\
    \ sensors are increasingly being deployed in higher value crops such as orchards\
    \ and vegetables but also in field \ncrops, to support irrigation management and\
    \ for early warning of diseases. Reacting technologies such as VRAs (Variable\
    \ Rate \nApplications) are being adopted more slowly, as they are most complex\
    \ requiring proper recording technologies as well as \nsufficient intra-field\
    \ heterogeneity to be profitable for farmers. Evidence in Turkey suggests a similar\
    \ pattern: As such, farmers \nare less convinced about their profitability and\
    \ require more sensitization, training and support (Say et al. 2017). \n \nSatellite\
    \ technology has also shown significant progress for imaging applications among\
    \ PA technologies. For example, \nremote sensing (RS) is used successfully to\
    \ detect variability in soil and crop conditions and to match inputs such as water,\
    \ seed, \nand fertilizer via variable rate technology. Currently, satellite imaging\
    \ technology is more suitable for large areas due to its cost \neffectiveness\
    \ in comparison to drone-based imaging. However, with a number of high-precision\
    \ satellite launches being planned, \nthat precision capabilities will improve\
    \ significantly to enable usage for medium-sized and small fields. \n \nDrone-based\
    \ imaging in PA has evolved rapidly over the last few years. Current drone imaging\
    \ favours usage of smaller \nfarms where satellite imagery is not cost effective.\
    \ With the improvements in satellite technology described above, however, \ndrone-based\
    \ imaging may be limited to certain conditions such as heavy cloud cover or difficult\
    \ terrain. With regards to precision \nspraying, however, drones may prove to\
    \ be a significant advantage as payload capacity continues to increase. \n \n\
    Lastly, farm management systems are another interesting and developing area in\
    \ the PA ecosystem. They assist farmers and \nland managers in achieving higher\
    \ yields and less waste through smarter resource management and greater reduction\
    \ of input \nDayıoğlu & Türker - Journal of Agricultural Sciences (Tarim Bilimleri\
    \ Dergisi), 2021, 27(4): 373-399 \n          381 \n \ncosts. Current farm management\
    \ systems use predictive algorithms to issue warnings on imminent pest attacks\
    \ and other key \nrisks affecting farm productivity. \n \n4.2. Agriculture 4.0\
    \  \n \nThe agricultural sector sets sail towards a new era of agriculture called\
    \ “Agriculture 4.0” thanks to emerging novel digital \ntechnologies. Agriculture\
    \ 4.0 finds solution to agricultural and environmental problems thanks to digitalization,\
    \ automation, and \nartificial intelligence adjusted to various agricultural technologies\
    \ from crop and livestock production, to weeding, to pest control, \nand also\
    \ to harvest.  \n \nMost studies related to new digital technologies are carried\
    \ out on topics, such as Information and Communications \nTechnologies (ICT),\
    \ Internet of Things (IoT), Cloud Computing (CC) Big Data Analytics (BDA), robotics,\
    \ Machine Learning \n(ML), Deep Learning (DL), Artificial Intelligence (AI), Unmanned\
    \ Aerial Vehicles (UAVs), Unmanned Ground Vehicles \n(UGVs), and Blockchain. There\
    \ are many literatures covering various applications used in Agriculture 4.0 in\
    \ the past few years:  \nICT (Lezoche et al. 2020; Moysiadis et al. 2021); WSN\
    \ (Ojha et al. 2015; Kochhar & Kumar 2019), IoT (Sinha & Dhanalakshmi \n2022;\
    \ Zhang et al. 2021; Sadowski & Spachos. 2020; Lin et al. 2020; Tzounis et al.\
    \ 2017; Ayaz et al. 2019; Kim et al. 2018; \nGarcía et al. 2020; Kour & Arora\
    \ 2020; Marolia et al. 2021; Tao et al. 2021), Big Data (Newton et al. 2020; Lezoche\
    \ et al. 2020; \nMoysiadis et al. 2021; Wolfert et al. 2017), UAV technology (Moysiadis\
    \ et al. 2021; Kim et al. 2018; Boursianis et al. 2020), \nand Artificial Intelligence\
    \ (Moysiadis et al. 2021; Jha et al. 2019), Machine Learning (Moysiadis et al.\
    \ 2021; Liakos et al. 2018), \nBlockchain (Chen et al. 2020; Bera et al. 2022;\
    \ GHD and AgThentic 2018), Automation & Robotics (Aceto et al. 2019; Carolan \n\
    2019). Furthermore, other smart farming topics including 3D Printing, Synthetic\
    \ Biology, Gene Editing, Nano Materials have \nbeen researched by GHD & AgThentic\
    \ (2018). \n \nNonetheless, Agriculture 4.0 paradigm occurs five core technologies\
    \ covering sensors and robotics, Internet of Things, cloud \ncomputing, data analytics,\
    \ decision support system. Figure 6 shows core technologies and connections among\
    \ them. (1) Sensors \nand robotics fulfill sensing and actuating functions, according\
    \ to the needs of the system. (2) IoT provides connectivity based on \nprotocol\
    \ and network for data communication. (3) Cloud computing is responsible for data\
    \ storage and processing. (4) Data \nanalytics involves big data and AI and ML-based\
    \ algorithms for data analysis. (5) Decision support system helps to provide data\
    \ \nvisualization, guidance functions, and user interaction (Araújo et al. 2021).\
    \ \n \n \n \nFigure 6- Agriculture 4.0 core technologies and connections (Araújo\
    \ et al. 2021) \n \n4.2.1. Novel digital technologies \n \nIndustry 4.0 has the\
    \ potential to transform the production capabilities of whole industries, including\
    \ the agricultural fields. \nConnectivity is the cornerstone of this transformation\
    \ and IoT is a key enabling technology that is increasingly part of agricultural\
    \ \nequipment. Technologies, such as IoT, Edge Computing, AI, robotics, 5G, blockchain,\
    \ and supercomputing, all have the potential \nto make agriculture more efficient,\
    \ sustainable, and competitive. Some definitions related to the advanced digital\
    \ technologies \ngiven by European Commission are following (EC 2021a): \n \n\
    The Internet of Things (IoT) refers to the network of smart, interconnected devices\
    \ and services that are capable of sensing \nor even listening to requests. IoT\
    \ is an aggregation of endpoints that are uniquely identifiable and that communicate\
    \ bi-\ndirectionally over a network using some form of automated connectivity.\
    \ The IoT enables based on networked sensors to \nremotely connect, track and\
    \ manage products, systems, and grids. \n \nDayıoğlu & Türker - Journal of Agricultural\
    \ Sciences (Tarim Bilimleri Dergisi), 2021, 27(4): 373-399 \n382 \n \nCloud computing\
    \ includes the use of tools and applications such as data storage, servers, databases,\
    \ and software based on \na network of remote servers through the Internet. Cloud\
    \ computing services enable users to store files and applications in a \nvirtual\
    \ place or the cloud and access all the data via the Internet. Public cloud services\
    \ are available on public networks and open \nto a widely unlimited cosmos of\
    \ potential users, designed for a market, not a single enterprise. \n \nBig Data\
    \ is a term describing the continuous increase in data, and the technologies needed\
    \ to collect, store, manage and \nanalyze it. It is a complex and multidimensional\
    \ phenomenon, impacting people, processes, and technology. Big Data is usually\
    \ \ncharacterized by \"four Vs \": Volume (size of the data sets), Velocity (high\
    \ speed of data processing), Variety (different types \nand sources of data used),\
    \ and Veracity (high quality of analyzed data). \n \nArtificial Intelligence (AI)\
    \ is a term used to define machines achieving human-like cognitive functions such\
    \ as learning, \nunderstanding, reasoning, or interacting. It comprises different\
    \ forms of cognition and meaning understanding (e.g. Speech \nrecognition, Natural\
    \ Language processing) and human interaction (e.g. signal sensing, smart control,\
    \ simulators). In terms of its \ntechnology base AI is a very heterogeneous field.\
    \ While some aspects like sensors, chips, robots as well as certain applications\
    \ \nlike autonomous driving, logistics, or medical instruments refer to hardware\
    \ components, a relevant part of AI is rooted in \nalgorithms and software.  \n\
    \ \nAgricultural robots can be used for crop monitoring and plant phenotyping,\
    \ yield estimation, soil sampling, smart irrigation, \nsmart spraying, dairy milking,\
    \ sorting tasks, disease detection, weed and pest control, planting, harvesting,\
    \ environmental \nmonitoring and pruning. UAVs and UGVs are robots that are used\
    \ both in the air and on land for agricultural applications. \n \nBlockchain is\
    \ a shared, digital, immutable ledger that facilitates the process of recording\
    \ transactions and tracking assets in \na business network. Shared ledgers technology\
    \ allows new transactions to be added to an existing chain of transactions using\
    \ a \nsecure, digital or cryptographic signature. Assets can be tangible (house,\
    \ car, cash, land) or intangible (intellectual property, \npatents, copyrights,\
    \ brand). Blockchain protocols aggregate, validate, and relay transactions within\
    \ the blockchain network. \nAlmost anything of value can be tracked and transacted\
    \ on a blockchain network, reducing risk and reducing all costs involved \nin\
    \ the business. Blockchain is ideal for presenting information as it provides\
    \ instantaneous, shared, and completely transparent \ninformation stored in a\
    \ non-modifiable ledger that can only be accessed by authorized network members.\
    \ A blockchain network \ncan track orders, payments, accounts, production, and\
    \ much more. As members share a single view of the truth, all the details of \n\
    a transaction can be seen from start to finish; thus, creating new efficiencies\
    \ and opportunities as well as greater confidence.  \n \nIndustrial Biotechnology\
    \ is the application domain of biotechnology for the industry in the production\
    \ and processing of \nchemicals, materials, and fuels. This technology involves\
    \ the practices related to using microorganisms or enzymes to generate \nindustrially\
    \ useful products in a more efficient way (e.g. less energy use, or fewer by-products)\
    \ without conventional \npetrochemical processes. \n \nNanotechnology is an umbrella\
    \ term that covers from the design to structural application and production, to\
    \ devices, and \nsystems by controlling shape and size at a nanometer scale. Nanotechnology\
    \ has revolutionary the potential for the development \nof smart nano and micro-devices\
    \ and systems in fields such as agriculture, healthcare, energy, environment,\
    \ and manufacturing. \nNanotechnology use in agriculture allows smart solutions\
    \ for nutrients, pesticides, and genetic materials for improved soil \nfertility\
    \ and soil protection, thanks to better stress tolerance. Nano-based sensors can\
    \ be used for monitoring whole factors that \naffect productivity in smart farming.\
    \ Moreover, nanotechnology can be used in post-harvest food processing and packaging\
    \ to \nreduce food contamination and waste. \n \nPhotonics is a multidisciplinary\
    \ field related to light including energy generation, detection, and process management,\
    \ \ndevices such as electronic components, and photodiodes, lasers, and LEDs.\
    \ It allows the technological basis for the economic \nconversion of sunlight\
    \ to electricity for solar-powered systems. \n \n4.2.2. Agriculture 4.0 applications\
    \ \n \nAgriculture 4.0 can be applied at four main groups as showed in Figure\
    \ 7: (a) monitoring; (b) control, (c) prediction, and (d) \nlogistics (Araújo\
    \ et al. 2021). \n \nDayıoğlu & Türker - Journal of Agricultural Sciences (Tarim\
    \ Bilimleri Dergisi), 2021, 27(4): 373-399 \n          383 \n \n \n \nFigure 7-\
    \ Domains and applications in Agriculture 4.0 (Araújo et al. 2021) \n \nMonitoring-\
    \ Automatic monitoring is the first step to passing to Agriculture 4.0. Smart\
    \ monitoring systems have potential \nchanging the game rule thanks to real-time\
    \ data collected from the field and advanced data analytics tools providing the\
    \ success \nof agricultural management. Monitoring allows farmers to get smart\
    \ and fast decisions and perform timely interventions, to \nincrease productivity\
    \ in agriculture, save time and costs and protect the environment (Araújo et al.\
    \ 2021). \n \nMonitoring include usually applications as follows: \n \n- Weather\
    \ monitoring (air temperature and humidity, rainfall, wind direction, wind velocity,\
    \ atmospheric pressure, solar \nradiation, etc.).  \n- GHG monitoring (temperature,\
    \ GHG emissions- CO2, CH4, N2O, SO2).  \n- Crop monitoring (NDVI) and soil monitoring\
    \ (temperature, moisture, electrical conductivity, pH value, and nutrient content)\
    \ \nfor agricultural management.  \n- Water monitoring (temperature, conductivity,\
    \ pH, salinity, turbidity, specific chemical compounds, dissolved oxygen \ncontent)\
    \ for irrigation systems, aquaculture or aquaponics (aquaculture + hydroponics)\
    \ for management. \n \nControl- While information is managed in one way in the\
    \ monitoring applications, the control applications use a bidirectional \ninformation\
    \ line. Commonly, an IoT-control system works together automatic monitoring system,\
    \ which employs IoT sensors \nto collect necessary data and to transfer them for\
    \ storage and then processing. Control applications are the following (Araújo\
    \ et \nal. 2021): \n \n- Irrigation Systems (sensors, actuators such as water\
    \ pumps, and solenoid valves) for irrigation management.  \n- Fertilization and\
    \ Fertigation for optimum fertilization. \n- Weed, Pest and Disease Control for\
    \ many problems like a waste of chemicals, increased costs, and pest resistance\
    \ to \nchemicals, environmental pollution, and contamination of agricultural products.\
    \ \n \nPrediction- Predicting function in Agriculture 4.0 is used in decision-making\
    \ support for the optimization in the management \nprocess. Monitoring and documentation\
    \ are vital processes since it is used real-time and historical data to improve\
    \ exact \nanalytical methods in predicting actual events. Prediction applications\
    \ are the following (Araújo et al. 2021): \n \n- Forecasting Weather Conditions\
    \ \n- Crop Development and Yield Estimation  \n- Forecasting Market Demand \n\
    \ \nLogistics- It is known that, in recent years, consumers have been more concerned\
    \ about how the agri-food products bought \nare produced, handled, packaged, stored,\
    \ and distributed. Agriculture 4.0 provides more efficient management and transparency\
    \ \nby increasing efficiency in logistics, addressing food safety and security,\
    \ traceability and food authentication, decreasing intrinsic \nrisks, and complying\
    \ with certifications and regulations (Araújo et al. 2021). \n \n \n \n \n \n\

    \ \nSeveral application examples related to domains such as monitoring, control,\
    \ prediction, and logistics of smart farming are given \nbelow. \n \nSmart Livestock\
    \ Farming (SLF) is one of applications of PA that supports real-time monitoring\
    \ of productions, health, and \nwelfare of livestock, and to ensure optimal yield,\
    \ to increase the management capacity of animals. A variety of sensors and \n\
    actuators and decision-making tools, and IoT technologies are used in SLF (Cadero\
    \ et al. 2018). Electronic identification systems \nsuch as ear tags, ruminal\
    \ boluses, and sub-cutaneous radio-frequency identification; on-animal sensors\
    \ like accelerometers, \nglobal positioning systems, and social activity loggers;\
    \ and stationary management systems, milking parlor, and related \ntechnologies\
    \ and flock management software are used in SLF (Vaintrub et al. 2021). Newton\
    \ et al. (2020) examined a case study \nrelated to the dairy milk recording system\
    \ under Australian conditions, using big data analytics based on individual cow\
    \ and herd \nperformance information, such as milk production, lactation, and\
    \ breeding records. They studied farm decision support using big \ndata and explored\
    \ various factors and processes along with farmer engagement. Knight (2020) reviewed\
    \ the current status of \nwearable sensor technologies in livestock farming that\
    \ could revolutionize dairy farming; explained the important difficulties, \n\
    and emphasized the advantages need for animal wellbeing, profitability. Sensors\
    \ are split into three categories: (1) \"At Cow\" \nsensors, (2) \"Near Cow\"\
    \ sensors, and (3) \"From Cow\" sensors. Wearable sensors can be placed by swallowing\
    \ or inserting into \ncows. Figure 8 shows wearable sensor technologies developed\
    \ for cows. While \"At Cow\" sensors at the red zone are used to \nmeasure acceleration,\
    \ temperature, heart rate, and pH, \"Near Cow\" sensors at the blue zone are used\
    \ to analyze video and sound \ninformation, as well as climate analysis, feed\
    \ analysis, and GPS, these are designed to be make interaction with the cloud.\
    \ \"From \nCow\" sensors at the green zone are employed to monitor products and\
    \ wastes like milk, hair, saliva, sweat, nasal secretion, \nbreath, and faeces\
    \ taken from the cow. Zhang et al. (2021) pointed out that SLF has important potential\
    \ thanks to intelligent \ntechnologies such as environmental control, disease\
    \ early warning, precise feeding, and remote diagnosis. They discussed the \n\
    framework and technical characteristics of wearable Internet of Things (W-IoT),\
    \ the advantages, difficulties, and expectations \nof the W-IoT in farm animals\
    \ (Figure 9). \n \n \n \n \nFigure 8- Overview of sensor technologies associated\

    \ 2021) \n \nSmart greenhouses enable farmers to cultivate crops with minimum\
    \ human interference. Climatic conditions such as \ntemperature, humidity, luminosity,\
    \ and soil moisture are continuously monitored inside a greenhouse. Variations\
    \ in these \nconditions will trigger automated actions. These actions will then\
    \ evaluate the changes and implement corrective actions to \nmaintain optimal\
    \ conditions for plant growth. \n \nZamora-Izquierdo et al. (2019) proposed a\
    \ flexible platform for greenhouses that used soilless culture with full recirculation.\
    \ \nThe system that obtained saving of more than 30% in water consumption and\
    \ up to 80% in some nutrients has low-cost hardware \nand a three-tier open-source\
    \ software platform at local, edge, and cloud planes.   \n \nLiao et al. (2017)\
    \ developed an IoT-based system including three subsystems like environmental\
    \ monitoring system, a \nwireless imaging platform, and a host analysis platform,\
    \ shown in Figure 10. In an orchid greenhouse, environmental sensors \nthat measure\
    \ temperature, relative humidity, and illumination, and cameras capture the images\
    \ of orchids were used. The IoT-\nbased environmental monitoring system consists\
    \ of 12 WSN, and a gateway based on ZigBee. While WSNs are responsible for \n\
    measuring environmental parameters, the gateway is used to organize the sensor\
    \ readings sent by the WSNs and transmit them \nto the host via Wi-Fi. The IoT-based\
    \ wireless imaging platform is built upon a Raspberry Pi single-board computer\
    \ with cameras. \nSensor data and camera images are saved in the host platform.\

    \ system in which both long-term and short-term planning are considered as \n\
    illustrated in Figure 11. \n \n \n \nFigure 11- IoT-based smart fertigation management\
    \ system (Lin et al. 2020) \n \nRoy et al. (2021) designed an IoT system according\
    \ to a dynamic irrigation scheduling called \"AgriSens\" for efficient water \n\
    management of irrigated crop fields. The AgriSens enables real-time, automatic\
    \ irrigation, as well as remote manual irrigation \nfor different growth phases.\
    \ IoT helps not only enhance the efficiency of irrigation processes but also minimize\
    \ water losses. In \norder to calculate the precise needs for water, sensors that\
    \ measure various parameters, such as relative humidity, soil moisture, \ntemperature,\
    \ and light intensity, need. IoT-based smart irrigation systems with such a mechanism\
    \ can contribute to higher \nirrigation efficiency. Benyezza et al. (2021) proposed\
    \ a block diagram of the example irrigation system, which is composed of \nthree\
    \ main parts, as shown in Figure 12: data processing, cloud, and communication\
    \ part. \nDayıoğlu & Türker - Journal of Agricultural Sciences (Tarim Bilimleri\

    \ proposed a framework called “blockchain-based electronic agriculture” on its\
    \ development and challenges \nof Ecological Farm in the Beijing Liuminying. According\
    \ to this framework, the whole circular agricultural model of the \necological\
    \ farm into the blockchain network automatically handles and uploads data through\
    \ several types of smart devices, \nwhich expands the information set that can\
    \ be used for sharing. This innovation provides a powerful agriculture model,\
    \ and \npresents a reliable path for reaching \"digital agricultural”. As shown\

    \ \n \n \n \nFigure 13- Blockchain-IoT enabled agriculture using drones (Bera\

    \ initiate the digitization of agriculture in Europe with \napproximately €1 billion\
    \ of EU funding under the Horizon 2020 program (EC 2021b). Several examples of\
    \ these projects are \ngiven below: \n \nATLAS project is agricultural interoperability\

    \ \napplications. The goal of ATLAS is the development of an open interoperability\
    \ network for agricultural applications and to \nbuild up a sustainable ecosystem\
    \ for innovative data-driven agriculture. The platform enables the flexible combination\
    \ of \nagricultural machinery, sensor systems, and data analysis tools to overcome\
    \ the lack of interoperability. This allows farmers to \nincrease their productivity\
    \ in a sustainable way. The ATLAS platform is built around a data exchange network\
    \ using a uniform \napplication program interface (ATLAS 2019). \n \nDayıoğlu\

    \ in the European food and farming industry both precision farming \nand smart\
    \ farming (IoF2020 2017). IoT-driven smart farming enables farmers to optimize\
    \ their operating tasks to boost crop \nyields and to reduce the costs of inputs\
    \ such as water, fertilizer, insecticides, and herbicides.  \n \nDEMETER project\
    \ is a large-scale deployment of farmer-driven, interoperable smart farming-IoT\
    \ based platforms, delivered \nthrough a series of 20 pilots across 18 countries\
    \ (15 EU countries). Involving 60 partners, DEMETER adopts a multi-actor \napproach\
    \ across the value chain (demand and supply), with 25 deployment sites, 6000 farmers\
    \ and over 38000 devices and \nsensors being deployed (DEMETER 2019). \n \nSome\
    \ of EU’s robotics projects are Vinbot, MARS, GRAPE, VINEROBOT, ROMI and Flourish\
    \ projects (Moysiadis et al. \n2021). Vinbot aimed operations crop monitoring\
    \ using devices like laser sensors, cameras and the navigation system that is\
    \ based \non a hybrid reactive/GPS (VINBOT 2017). MARS subproject was designed\
    \ for the development of a mobile agricultural robot, \nwhich had the ability\
    \ to cooperate and work in swarms (Figure 14a). GRAPE subproject targeted to develop\
    \ a UGV able to \nperform semi-autonomous vineyard monitoring and farming tasks\
    \ (Figure 14b). VINEROBOT aimed to develop a novel UGV \ncapable of monitoring\
    \ grape growth and factors like grape yield, vegetative growth, water stress,\
    \ and grape composition in \ncovering vineyard management (Figure 14c). ROMI project\
    \ is developed for a UGV performing tasks such as weeding, crop \nmonitoring,\
    \ and collecting specific information on any individual plant (ROMI 2020). Flourish\

    \ that the success of Agriculture 4.0 could lead, there are still various challenges\
    \ that need to be handled \nfor providing a successful digital transformation.\
    \ The main challenges to be considered in Agriculture 4.0 are split into five\
    \ main \nlevels. Those challenges are related to device, data, network, application,\
    \ and the system according to levels. Challenges at device \nlevels are usually\
    \ related to a harsh field environment, power consumption, and cost issues. Data\
    \ levels are mostly linked to \nquality, availability, privacy, integrity, and\
    \ interpretability issues. Facing at network levels are mostly network size, latency\
    \ and \nthroughput, transmission range, propagation losses, and interoperability\
    \ issues. Emerging of during applications are usually real-\ntime use, context-awareness,\
    \ cyber-security, modularity, and reliability problems. Problems that emerged\
    \ in the system are \nscalability, flexibility, robustness, complexity, affordability,\
    \ and continuous improvement issues (Araújo et al. 2021).  \n \nAs noted earlier\
    \ (besides the small scale of land and low level of mechanization), farmers face\
    \ significant challenges in the \ntransition to smart farming as they try to adopt\
    \ sensors, biologicals, robotic automation, and digital data from third-party\
    \ \nproviders. Farmers are traditionally conservative and adopt new technology\
    \ solely for its usefulness rather than its technological \nappeal. As a result,\
    \ compelling applications must be significantly deep to deal with the farmer's\
    \ specific situation, while also \nrelying on integrated solutions that make data\
    \ and insights easy and seamless. \n \nThere are two basic stages in smart farming\
    \ that should be taken into account for the transition: (1) The pre-processing\
    \ stage \nand (2) the post-processing stage. The pre-processing phase covers market\
    \ trends geographical conditions and soil properties of \nthe land, seeds choosing,\
    \ and the land preparation for the smart farming system. The post-processing stage\
    \ is employed machine \nvision techniques for disease and weed identification\
    \ while using smart technologies in irrigation and harvesting. For traditional\
    \ \nagricultural players, this transition is not easy. As the industry moves from\
    \ products to outcome-based solutions and worksite \noptimization, many organizations\
    \ face the conflict of traditional platform or product-based organizations versus\
    \ the needs of the \nfarmer and marketplace. As a result, smart farming is undergoing\
    \ a rapid transformation from both a product and a service \nperspective. Technological\
    \ disruptions, business model transformations, and organizational changes are\
    \ all creating an exciting \nbut challenging opportunity. \n \n5. Renewable Energy\
    \ and Environmental Technologies \n \nRenewable energy technologies have the potential\
    \ to provide synergy between water, energy, and food; and also, the optimum \n\
    mix is available for three sectors. Solar-based pumping solutions offer a cost-effective\
    \ alternative to the grid- or diesel-based \nirrigation pumps. Renewable energy\
    \ and rainwater harvesting technologies can be combined with a nexus system. Renewable\
    \ \nDayıoğlu & Türker - Journal of Agricultural Sciences (Tarim Bilimleri Dergisi),\
    \ 2021, 27(4): 373-399 \n          389 \n \nenergy technologies such as solar\
    \ energy, wind energy, and bioenergy can be integrated into agriculture in villages\
    \ and cities.  If \ncoupling an energy storage system with renewable energy technologies,\
    \ the excess energy generated can be stored to use in the \nfuture. As an alternative\
    \ solution to the Nexus approach, new applications where photovoltaic panels are\
    \ combined can be used \nin field and horticulture, and aquaculture. \n \n5.1.\
    \ Agrivoltaics  \n \nAgrivoltaic systems are PV technologies installed at a certain\
    \ height from the ground, making it together integrating agriculture \nand solar\
    \ energy. Agrivoltaic systems can provide both preserve agricultural land and\
    \ advantage crop production by increasing \nwater use efficiency and decreasing\
    \ water stress (Agostini et al. 2021; Allardyce et al. 2017). Sun'Agri agrivoltaic\
    \ system driven \nby artificial intelligence in Piolenc provides the vines shaded\
    \ by the pivoting solar panels continue to grow and show a reduced \nneed for\
    \ water thanks to the reduction in evapotranspiration (pv magazine 2020). However,\
    \ these positive attributes need \ncomprehensive environmental and economic analysis\
    \ of agrivoltaic systems. Figure 15 shows various applications of agrivoltaic\
    \ \nsystems.  \n \n \n \nFigure 15- Agrivoltaic systems: (a, b) Agrovoltaics a\
    \ solar innovation and triple usage of solar energy (Agrovoltaics 2021), (c) \n\

    \ (Allardyce et al. 2017) \n \n5.2. Aquavoltaics  \n \nAquavoltaics (AquaPV) is\
    \ a concept emerged with combining electricity production and aquaculture. AquaPVs\
    \ floating on the \nwater body can lessen water losses preventing evaporation\
    \ by up to 70–85% due to covering the water. The aquavoltaics \ntechnology enables\
    \ electricity to be generated and aquaculture to be carried out in the same area,\
    \ and thus significantly improves \noverall productivity per unit area compared\
    \ to conventional land use. Several projects and studies are carried out to verify\
    \ positive \nand negative aspects in terms of ecosystem and the technical and\
    \ economic feasibility of dual-use in Aquavoltaics (Pringle et al. \n2017, Fraunhofer\
    \ 2021; Solaripedia 2021; PV TECH 2021). Figure 16 shows various applications\
    \ related to aquavoltaic and \nfloatvoltaic systems.  \n \n \n \nFigure 16- Aquavoltaic\

    \ monitoring system  \n \nIndustrial development including agriculture has caused\
    \ pollution of natural resources such as water, air, soil, food. GHG \nemissions,\
    \ heavy metals, pesticides, and other chemicals that pollute terrestrial and aquatic\
    \ ecosystems pose, and also unbalanced \nwater use in all sectors a threat to\
    \ the health of animals and humans, so our future. \n \nA nexus approach based\
    \ on water-energy-food given in this study supports the transition to a green\
    \ economy to solve whole \nthose problems. The agricultural nexus planning combined\
    \ with digital technologies can be used to solve challenges related to \nwater,\
    \ energy, and food including the environment. In this context, topics including\
    \ overall agricultural management can be \nhandled for the environment (water,\
    \ soil, air – whole ecosystem), optimum water use, and efficient energy use. \n\

    \ and any form of life on earth are inevitably dependent on sunlight, and today,\
    \ thanks to modern technologies \nemerging, Sun offers a bigger source with the\
    \ possibility to harness the energy from it all around the year. Not only does\
    \ the \ndevelopment of the crop with energy coming from the sun but supports the\
    \ gathering of precious information about the soil, air, \nwater, and weather\
    \ conditions themselves. \n \nSolar-powered plug-and-play wireless field sensors\
    \ provide farmers with instant access to data on their soil properties and \n\
    crop health. This hardware is a device IoT-based, low-power, long-range, and adaptable\
    \ based on farm size. A farm monitoring \nsystem shown in Figure 17 is a network\
    \ of smart sensors driven by powerful AI-based crop intelligence and farm management\
    \ \nsoftware to aid farmers across the globe with instant access to soil and crop\
    \ health. It is designed to help farmers accomplish \nhigh crop productivity and\
    \ high-profit margins (Solarvibes 2021). \n \n \n \nFigure 17- Solar-powered Plug\
    \ & Play Farm Monitoring System (Solarvibes 2021) \n \n5.3.2. Environmental monitoring\
    \ \n \nClimate change is due to emissions of greenhouse gases (GHGs) that have\
    \ been greatly affecting agricultural production. The \nside eﬀects of climate\
    \ change result in frequent experiences of droughts, ﬂoods, and extreme weather\
    \ conditions. Data-driven \nIoT systems are have monitoring and control functions\
    \ including reducing energy and fuel consumption, generating renewable \nenergy\
    \ on-site, and performing closed-loop measurements of carbon consumption and waste.\
    \ It is seen that IoT-powered smart \nservices and industry could account for\
    \ up to 10 percent carbon reduction by increasing efficiency and eliminating reliance\
    \ on \ndisposable materials in both the public and private sectors. \n \nMonitoring\
    \ systems can assist farmers in monitoring and improving the quality to avoid\
    \ degradation of soil. They allow for \nthe monitoring of a number of physical,\
    \ chemical, and biological properties such as texture, water-holding capacity,\
    \ and \nabsorption rate. Soil monitoring can help to minimize problems, such as\
    \ erosion, densification, salinization, acidification, and \npollution due to\
    \ toxic elements (Yurtseven et al. 2018). \n \nPesticides and several other agrochemicals\
    \ are used widely in agriculture. These chemicals that affect in way serious and\
    \ \npermanent ecological balance are harmful to human and animal welfare, causing\
    \ substantial damage to complete ecosystems. \nIoT-based smart devices, such as\
    \ WSNs, drones, robots, enable farmers to substantially decrease the use of pesticides.\
    \ Advanced \nIoT-based pests and insect control allow precise tracking, simulation,\
    \ disease prediction, and therefore is more efficient than \ntraditional pest\
    \ control calendars or prescripts (Raj et al. 2021). The IoT-based systems with\
    \ ML, DL, and image processing can \nbe used in preventing fruit diseases, diagnosing\
    \ and preventing infection in agricultural products. Studies have seen that chemical\
    \ \npollution can prevent using big data, AI, ML technologies. Wastewater from\
    \ industry can be used in agricultural production; \nWater polluted with heavy\
    \ metals threatens our food (paddy, greenhouse cultivation, fish production, etc.)\
    \ and our health. In \nrecent years, it is known that cancer and many diseases\
    \ that adversely affect the immune system are caused by excessive \nagricultural\
    \ spraying and industrial wastewater. Excessive use of pesticides in fields, vineyards,\
    \ gardens, and greenhouses \npollutes air, soil, and water resources. In other\
    \ words, excessive spraying, irrigation, fertilization harm the entire ecosystem\
    \ in \nan unsustainable way. All of this should be traced back to the source where\
    \ the problem started; all data should be forwarded to \nthe center and evaluated;\
    \ monitoring and control mechanisms should be developed. \n \nPA has not only\
    \ the potential to reduce greenhouse gas emissions but also having a positive\
    \ effect on-farm productivity and \nthe economy. These technologies cover whole\
    \ farming applications such as variable-rate spraying, irrigation planting, \n\
    fertilization, and weeding (Balofoutis et al. 2017). Both driver assistance (Machine\
    \ Guidance) and Variable Rate Technologies \n(VRT) contribute to climate change\
    \ mitigation by reducing fuel and input use at given yields. Based on a literature\
    \ review, the \nEU classifies GHG reduction potential of different Precision Agricultural\
    \ Technologies (PATs) as it follows (Table 1): \n \nDayıoğlu & Türker - Journal\
    \ of Agricultural Sciences (Tarim Bilimleri Dergisi), 2021, 27(4): 373-399 \n\
    \          391 \n \nTable 1- Greenhouse Gas (GHG) reduction potential of different\

    \ (VRT) \n1 \nWeeding (Precision physical) \n1 \n \nVariable-rate nutrient application\
    \ has the highest GHG emission reduction potential amongst PA technologies, as\
    \ nitrogen \nfertilizer is the main source of N2O that is the most influential\
    \ GHG emitted from farming activities. Its impact on global warming \nis 298 times\
    \ higher than that of CO2 (Soto et al. 2019). Variable-rate irrigation has a dual\
    \ impact. (1) decreasing the energy need \nfor water pumping from the water source,\
    \ (2) reducing of the GHG emissions by applying the optimum irrigation scheduling.\
    \ \nOn the other hand, applications such as controlled traffic in agriculture,\
    \ machine guidance, VRT-pesticide use have GHG \nreduction potential. Moreover,\
    \ all-natural resources (water, air, soil) have threatened due to chemical contaminants,\
    \ \noverwatering, over-spraying, over-fertilizing. \n \n5.3.3. Water monitoring\
    \ \n \nWater Quality Index (WQI) that developed to measure water quality is determined\
    \ through different water quality parameters, \nsuch as pH, turbidity, temperature,\
    \ chloride, electrical conductivity (EC), dissolved oxygen (DO), biological oxygen\
    \ demand \n(BOD), and chemical oxygen demand (COD), etc. (Ahmed et al. 2020).\
    \ Smart water management requires the integration of \nsystems and a complex of\
    \ measures to monitor, control and regulate the usage and quality of water resources\
    \ as well as maintain \nthe associated equipment (sensors, actuators, pipes, pumps,\
    \ etc.). Smart water systems based on the combination of the IoT, big \ndata,\
    \ and AI technologies can help stop water scarcity from happening and remove the\
    \ damage the incautious usage of water \nresources has already caused. \n \nIn\
    \ rural areas shown in Figure 18, solar-powered wireless air - water - soil monitoring\
    \ stations can be used to monitor \nenvironmental variables at vineyards, orchards,\
    \ fields, fish farms, greenhouses, basis on the energy - food - water nexus at\
    \ real-\ntime. \n \n \n \nFigure 18- Solar-powered wireless-weather-soil-water\

    \ in Africa, a large pivot system with a radius of 479 meters has used to irrigate\
    \ 50 hectares of desert. The fuel costs of \noperating this system are very high.\
    \ Water is being supplied through an artificial canal from the Nile. At this point,\
    \ Alfalfa is \ngrown as feeding hay and harvested 11 times each year with the\
    \ harvest season exceeding 300 days. Until 2013, a 135-kW diesel \ngenerator ran\
    \ 22 hours per day to power the system. An alternative power source had to be\
    \ found in this off-grid. Following \nfeasibility analysis, a solar-powered system,\
    \ using suitable pumps to replace the diesel-powered generator and AC pumps were\
    \ \ninstalled. While all motors required to move the pivot now are powered with\
    \ solar energy, the pivot speed is automatically \ncontrolled proportional to\
    \ water flow. Figure 19 shows solar-powered center pivot irrigation system that\
    \ is installed by Lorentz. \nIn 11 hours, the pivot completes one 360 degrees\
    \ turn, providing the required 3300 m³ of water per day for partial irrigation\
    \ \n(Lorentz 2014). This energy transformation not only no longer decreasing energy\

    \ agriculture production process and these objectives can \nonly be achieved by\
    \ changing the farming practices from fossil-based energy generation to renewable\
    \ energy based farming. \nRenewable energy technologies to be able to use in farming\
    \ are solar energy, wind energy, geothermal energy, and biomass \nenergy. IFES\
    \ is a farming system model designed to combine, intensify, and hence improve\
    \ the simultaneous production of food \nand energy through the sustainable use\
    \ of biomass; achieved in two ways: 1. Combining the production of food and fuel\
    \ feedstock \nDayıoğlu & Türker - Journal of Agricultural Sciences (Tarim Bilimleri\
    \ Dergisi), 2021, 27(4): 373-399 \n          393 \n \non the same land, e.g. inter-cropping,\
    \ agroforestry, or agro-pastoral systems, 2. Using the by-products/residues of\
    \ one production \nsystem i.e. ‘closed loop’ or ‘zero waste’ systems. Hence, energy-smart\
    \ solutions can include simultaneously producing food and \nenergy as a means\
    \ of achieving sustainable production systems in rural communities as shown in\
    \ Figure 21 (Sims & Flammini \n2014). \n \n \n \nFigure 21- Integrated food energy\
    \ system (IFES) (Sims & Flammini 2014) \n \n6. Discussion \n \nIn this review,\
    \ innovative digital technologies to be able to use in agri-food systems are discussed\
    \ based on the water-energy-\nfood nexus for sustainable development. The agriculture\
    \ sector has a social-economic structure that is always a risky sector, \nwhere\
    \ variable inputs are used to grow very different products such as food and feed,\
    \ directly affected by weather conditions. \nAgricultural activities, unlike industry,\
    \ are carried out in large, open areas like fields, vineyards, and orchards, or\
    \ closed areas \nlike greenhouses, barns, poultry houses, and mushroom houses.\
    \ Today, it is necessary to switch from labor-intensive production \nto technology-intensive\
    \ production for successful and sustainable agricultural production in all its\
    \ processes.  \n \nSince the areas used in agricultural production are limited,\
    \ a productivity increase in agricultural production should be \nensured. While\
    \ input costs can be reduced, production yield and quality can be increased using\
    \ precision farming (Berger 2019; \nWolfert et al. 2017) and smart farming (Balafoutis\
    \ et al. 2019; Boursianis et al. 2019) technologies with variable rate applications,\
    \ \ndeveloped applications saving the environment. \n \nThe driving factor of\
    \ smart agriculture is to meet the demand for more food to increase yields, optimize\
    \ interdependent \nresources of energy, water, and land, and provide sustainable\
    \ urbanization. Water and energy are two finite resources that must \nreach access\
    \ to more people and so ensuring everyone has access to a reliable supply are\
    \ crucial to human survival and sustainable \ndevelopment (EC 2017; FAO 2017a;\
    \ WB 2019). \n \nThe agri-food value chain consumes 30 percent of the world’s\
    \ available energy (FAO 2020). Energy is needed in the \nproduction of crops,\
    \ fish, livestock, and forestry products, food storage and processing, food transport\
    \ and distribution and, as \nwell as, in food preparation (FAO 2012). Although\
    \ the availability of fossil fuels has made a significant contribution to feeding\
    \ \nthe world, these energy sources are finite and, in general, environmentally\
    \ problematic. As discussed also in this study, renewable \nenergy technologies\
    \ are key to food security and a climate-friendly, sustainable transformation\
    \ of agri-food systems to produce \nmore and better-quality food. Data-driven\
    \ systems, IoT-backed sensors keep an eye on consumption patterns and provide\
    \ insights \ninto inefficient areas which in turn help to analyze energy consumption,\
    \ usage, and pattern. These solutions can be utilized to \nmanage and optimize\

    \ & Türker - Journal of Agricultural Sciences (Tarim Bilimleri Dergisi), 2021,\
    \ 27(4): 373-399 \n394 \n \nand frontier technologies, design and new services,\
    \ tools and approaches to empower rural households and inspire youth \nentrepreneurship\
    \ in food and agriculture (Santos Valle & Kienzle 2020). \n \nThe farming sector\
    \ is moving towards a new paradigm that is recalled Agriculture 4.0 that integrates\
    \ a number of innovations \nin order to produce agricultural products. Agriculture\
    \ has become a strategic sector that needs to be given more importance due \n\
    to reasons such as climate imbalances caused by global warming, an increase in\
    \ the world population, and the gradual decrease \nof usable agricultural resources.\
    \ Today, when traditional farming methods are no longer sufficient, countries\
    \ have to focus on \npractices that increase productivity and reduce costs with\
    \ Agriculture 4.0 practices. Smart Agriculture or Agriculture 4.0 is used \nto\
    \ point out the digitalization of production as in Industry 4.0. Indeed, modern\
    \ technology is available that will make agriculture \nmore environmentally friendly\
    \ and efficient. Technical improvements in the agriculture sector can be carried\
    \ out to optimize \nproduction efficiency, and improve quality, minimize carbon\
    \ footprint; and can be reduced production-associated risks. \n \nAgricultural\
    \ applications that are from crop production to harvesting, from weather monitoring\
    \ to prediction, irrigation, \nweeding, fertigation, pest control, and logistics\
    \ are rapidly evolving towards a new digital cosmos covering technologies such\
    \ as \nIoT, cloud computing, big data, automation, and artificial intelligence.\
    \ \n \n7. Conclusions \n \nThis study targets to obtain holistic solutions in\
    \ a systematic view, basis on Water-Energy-Food nexus to agricultural digital\
    \ \ntransformation that will support achieving a sustainable future. Digitalization\
    \ is a technology accessing unexploited data pools \nto valuable information,\
    \ providing transformation to potential benefits for society and the environment\
    \ if programming smartly \nand efficiently among data sets.  \n \nThe water-food-energy\
    \ resources are at the center of sustainable development. The development of smart\
    \ systems \ninterconnected can generate unique opportunities to effectively solve\
    \ the challenges targeted in United Nations’ Sustainable \nDevelopment Goals.\
    \ It can be emphasized that smart technologies can be able to use as tools for\
    \ game-rule changing, if setting \ntheir systematic integrations, the food-water-energy\
    \ nexus will benefit sustainable development. The strategical use of three \n\
    essential sources for future generations will provide invaluable solutions listed\
    \ here: (1) sustainable food production; (2) access \nto fresh and safe water;\
    \ and (3) renewable energy generation and usage. Human beings have two inevitable\
    \ missions to fulfill \nsustainable development. The first one is to solve the\
    \ interconnections between food - water - energy - climate nexus. The second \n\
    one is to develop smarter machines and systems achieving agricultural transformation\
    \ from traditional to digital to improve \nefficiency, decrease input costs and\
    \ resource use, and protect the environment. \n \nIn the new digital era starting\
    \ with the Industry 4.0 revolution, the production capabilities of all industries\
    \ thanks to \ninnovations emerged, including agriculture will have to transform\
    \ in order to feed the rapidly growing population of the world.  \n \nSmart agriculture\
    \ is real-time farm management providing a high degree of automation, and data-driven\
    \ intelligent decision-\nmaking to improve productivity, save natural resources.\
    \ Digital technologies can support farmers' production of safe, sustainable, \n\
    and quality food.  Technological innovations can help us overwhelm many of the\
    \ economic, social, and environmental challenges \nthat agriculture is facing\
    \ today. Novel technologies like the internet of things, cloud computing, big\
    \ data, artificial intelligence, \ndrones, and robotics provide making processes\
    \ more efficient and drive the creation of new products and services and streamline\
    \ \nagricultural operations. \n \nThe driven technology of Agriculture 4.0 is\
    \ the IoT that provides the ability to securely connect end-to-end to anything,\
    \ to \nanywhere. In IoT, numerous wireless sensor network deployed to the field\
    \ can be used along with cloud technologies. Big data \ngathered site-specific\
    \ are transformed into meaningful data set to be used in decision support systems\
    \ for smart applications. The \ncaptured information in the field can be examined\
    \ by computational techniques to reveal trends and patterns, and interactive \n\
    information on human behaviors, environment, and experiences can be transformed\
    \ into efficient actions.  \n \nBy using smart agriculture technologies and data-driven\
    \ techniques, it will be possible to monitor in real-time how water, \nchemicals,\
    \ and energy are used for the production of healthy food and animal feed, and\
    \ what environmental effects the applied \nagricultural activity may cause. However,\
    \ this requires the development of national and international policies, the implementation\
    \ \nof strategies, and the control and supervision of processes.  \n \nDeveloped,\
    \ there are many smart farming technologies including decision support system,\
    \ yield monitoring, smart irrigation, \nsmart spraying, management of crop disease,\
    \ crop monitoring, soil monitoring, treatment of pests with robots, intelligent\
    \ \nharvesting according to maturity, traceability from farm to fork, logistics,\
    \ as well as e-marketing. Although innovation is often \nconceived as techno-centric,\
    \ the rise of Agriculture 4.0 thinking needs to consider also environmental and\
    \ social sustainability \nperspectives. However, challenges related to power,\
    \ performance, and security are obstacles to seamless connectivity.  \n \nThanks\
    \ to developments in recent years, it is seen that digital technologies and data-driven\
    \ techniques have the potential to \ntransform agriculture more precisely, efficiently,\
    \ and sustainably. Furthermore, while providing greater transparency for \nDayıoğlu\
    \ & Türker - Journal of Agricultural Sciences (Tarim Bilimleri Dergisi), 2021,\
    \ 27(4): 373-399 \n          395 \n \nconsumers on how food is produced, decision-making\
    \ support has helped farmers in many practices, in terms of environmental \nand\
    \ agricultural performance. Beyond farming, while digital technologies make the\
    \ job more attractive to new generations, they \noffer many opportunities to reduce\
    \ problems related to remoteness and improve access to services. \n \nAlthough\
    \ data-driven technologies play a key role at all stages of the production of\
    \ food and feed in agri-food systems of the \nfuture, none of this can happen\
    \ without enough energy and water from farm to fork. Being clean and sustainable\
    \ the energy used \nin agriculture, not chemically polluted of the water is vital\
    \ to access to fresh water and clean energy everyone, and for a better \nreconstructing\
    \ in the aftermath of the COVID-19 pandemic. \n \nReferences \n \nAbegaz B W,\

    Abstract: This paper reviews the current GeoAI and machine learning applications\
    \ in hydrological\nand hydraulic modeling, hydrological optimization problems,\
    \ water quality modeling, and ﬂuvial\ngeomorphic and morphodynamic mapping. GeoAI\
    \ effectively harnesses the vast amount of spatial\nand non-spatial data collected\
    \ with the new automatic technologies. The fast development of GeoAI\nprovides\
    \ multiple methods and techniques, although it also makes comparisons between\
    \ different\nmethods challenging. Overall, selecting a particular GeoAI method\
    \ depends on the application’s\nobjective, data availability, and user expertise.\
    \ GeoAI has shown advantages in non-linear modeling,\ncomputational efﬁciency,\
    \ integration of multiple data sources, high accurate prediction capability,\n\
    and the unraveling of new hydrological patterns and processes. A major drawback\
    \ in most GeoAI\nmodels is the adequate model setting and low physical interpretability,\
    \ explainability, and model\ngeneralization. The most recent research on hydrological\
    \ GeoAI has focused on integrating the\nphysical-based models’ principles with\
    \ the GeoAI methods and on the progress towards autonomous\nprediction and forecasting\
    \ systems.\nKeywords: GeoAI; artiﬁcial intelligence; machine learning; hydrological;\
    \ hydraulic; ﬂuvial; water\nquality; geomorphic; modeling\n1. Introduction\nHydrology\
    \ and ﬂuvial research are inexact ﬁelds of science, with a large extent of\nepistemic\
    \ uncertainty and limited knowledge about the system’s complexity, structure,\
    \ and\nfunctioning [1]. Both disciplines have been hindered by the limited quality\
    \ and availability\nof data [2]. Nowadays, access to temporally and spatially\
    \ high-resolution hydrological and\nﬂuvial data has substantially increased, mainly\
    \ due to advances in the use of automatic\nsensors in monitoring, environmental\
    \ 3D scanners, and high-resolution remote sensing\nfrom different sources, producing\
    \ ‘big data’. The use of big hydrological data requires the\ndevelopment and the\
    \ use of the applications of new geospatial tools for computational\nanalytics\
    \ and hydrological models. Technologies under the geospatial artiﬁcial intelligence\n\
    (GeoAI) concept, such as machine learning (ML) and parallel computing, provide\
    \ the means\nto utilize this spatial and non-spatial dataset effectively and also\
    \ to enhance integrated\nhydrological and ﬂuvial systems modeling [3].\nHydrological\
    \ and ﬂuvial modeling took a giant leap forward when the computer\nrevolution\
    \ started in the 1960s [4–6]. Since then, engineers and scientists have developed\n\

    Water 2022, 14, 2211\n2 of 38\na wide range of hydrological models with different\
    \ levels of complexity, including em-\npirical and physical-based models [7–10].\
    \ Similarly, several 1D, 2D, and 3D numerical\nhydraulic models are available\
    \ to model ﬂuvial processes, such as ﬂow characteristics,\nsediment transport,\
    \ ﬂood extent, and water depth [5,11]. Currently, despite a wide range\nof physical-based\
    \ model availability, those models still have challenges in adequately and\naccurately\
    \ modeling the complex and non-linear hydrological and hydraulic processes\noccurring\
    \ in nature [5]. In addition, the application of these models has been restricted\
    \ to\nsmall areas due to limited data availability, challenges in representing\
    \ spatially varying\nparameters, and computational intensity [12]. Alternatively,\
    \ GeoAI and ML data-driven\nmodels, such as artiﬁcial neural networks (ANNs) and\
    \ long short-term memory (LSTM)\ndeep learning show promising results for hydrological\
    \ and hydraulic prediction and fore-\ncasting in natural environments and at a\
    \ large geographical scale [13]. They can represent\nthe non-linear processes\
    \ and provide high-accuracy predictions [14,15]. ML application in\nhydrological\
    \ predictions dates to the 1990s [16], but the development of the new GeoAI\n\
    and ML algorithms, particularly the deep learning techniques, alongside new data\
    \ collec-\ntion technologies, has substantially increased in recent years [17,18].\
    \ Moreover, there are\nnew studies on developing hybrid models (ML and physical-based\
    \ models) [14,19,20] and\nphysical process-guided ML methods [21–24]. Therefore,\
    \ a review of the potential of the\nnew GeoAI and ML methods for integrated hydrological\
    \ and ﬂuvial systems modeling is\nneeded to guide scientists and practitioners\
    \ to select the proper tools and to be aware of\ncurrent and potential future\
    \ methodologies.\nExisting reviews of GeoAI and ML applications in hydrological\
    \ modeling and ﬂuvial\nstudies have covered speciﬁc topics, such as the prediction\
    \ of runoff, ﬂoods, and water\nquality [25–29]. Other reviews have focused on\
    \ applying a particular GeoAI and ML\nmethod [30–33]. However, an overarching\
    \ review of GeoAI and ML in hydrology is lacking.\nWe aim to review the most recent\
    \ GeoAI and ML method applications in hydrological,\nhydraulic, water quality,\
    \ and ﬂuvial process modeling.\nThis broad review on using GeoAI in hydrological\
    \ and ﬂuvial processes modeling pro-\nvides a critical assessment of the technical\
    \ development, the potential, and the limitations of\nthe models and the current\
    \ research trends and gaps from the standpoint of hydrology and\nﬂuvial system\
    \ researchers. The review identiﬁed more than 1300 publications over the last\n\
    two decades, published mainly in water resources, civil and environmental engineering,\n\
    geosciences, and environmental sciences journals.\n2. Review Methodology and Outline\n\
    The application of GeoAI in hydrological and ﬂuvial systems research has substan-\n\
    tially increased and diversiﬁed in recent years, comprising a wide range of topics.\
    \ There-\nfore, a systematic review is challenging. In this review, we adopted\
    \ a scoping review\nmethodology [34,35]. The scoping review supports consistent\
    \ and structured literature\nsearches to capture relevant information and provides\
    \ a comprehensive overview of the\ncurrent applications and research. We explored\
    \ four categories of GeoAI applications:\n(1) hydrological and hydraulic modeling;\
    \ (2) hydrological model calibration and model-\ning optimization problems; (3)\
    \ water quality modeling; and (4) ﬂuvial geomorphology\nand morphodynamic mapping.\
    \ We searched the literature from the Web of Science, in-\ncluding Scopus, Springer\
    \ Link, Wiley Online Library, and MDPI. We used the Boolean\noperators (AND and\
    \ OR), the proximity operators (NEAR and PRE), and nested logic (use\nof parentheses)\
    \ to constrain the literature search to those works containing topic keywords\n\
    combined with GeoAI methods in the article’s title, abstract, or keywords. Because\
    \ the\nGeoAI terminologies are diverse and commonly phrase-named, e.g., deep neural\
    \ networks,\ndeep convolutional neural networks, and deep learning, we used proximity\
    \ operators to\nﬁnd records containing all the terms within a deﬁned number (n)\
    \ of word neighbors. In\nthe case of a more common GeoAI phrase name, such as\
    \ machine learning or artiﬁcial\nintelligence, we used double quotation marks\
    \ to indicate that the words should not be\nsearched separately. In addition,\
    \ we used left and right truncation or shortening to ac-\nWater 2022, 14, 2211\n\
    3 of 38\ncount for the GeoAI or topic names that vary in preﬁxes and sufﬁxes,\
    \ using the asterisk\nsymbol, e.g., *morpho* to select papers containing the terms\
    \ geomorphologic, geomor-\nphometry, morphodynamic, or hydromorphological. An\
    \ example of the searching query\nconstruction in the Web of Science database\
    \ for a GeoAI application in ﬂuvial geomor-\nphology and morphodynamic studies\
    \ is: (TS = (Deep NEAR/3 neural NEAR/3 learn*) OR\nTS = (Artiﬁcial NEAR/3 Neural\
    \ NEAR/3 Network*) OR TS = “Artiﬁcial Intelligence” OR\nTS = AI OR TS = geoAI\
    \ OR TS = “Machine learning”) AND TS = ﬂuvial AND TS = *morpho*.\nWe used different\
    \ keywords combined with GeoAI terminologies according to the hydro-\nlogical\
    \ subﬁelds of interest, e.g., hydrological, optimization, calibration, water quality,\n\
    nutrient, pollutant, sediment, etc. In some cases, we also used the NOT operator\
    \ to further\nreﬁne the searching by excluding papers containing certain words\
    \ from other topics or\nsubﬁelds. For example, we excluded water quality terminologies\
    \ to search for papers\nfocusing purely on hydrological modeling. Figure 1 shows\
    \ the yearly publication statistics\nof the GeoAI and ML applications in the different\
    \ hydrological subﬁelds.\nWater 2022, 14, x FOR PEER REVIEW \n3 of 42 \n \n \n\
    case of a more common GeoAI phrase name, such as machine learning or artificial\
    \ intelli-\ngence, we used double quotation marks to indicate that the words should\
    \ not be searched \nseparately. In addition, we used left and right truncation\
    \ or shortening to account for the \nGeoAI or topic names that vary in prefixes\
    \ and suffixes, using the asterisk symbol, e.g., \n*morpho* to select papers containing\
    \ the terms geomorphologic, geomorphometry, mor-\nphodynamic, or hydromorphological.\
    \ An example of the searching query construction in \nthe Web of Science database\
    \ for a GeoAI application in fluvial geomorphology and mor-\nphodynamic studies\

    \ NEAR/3 Network*) OR TS = “Artificial Intelligence” OR TS = AI OR TS = \ngeoAI\
    \ OR TS = “Machine learning”) AND TS = fluvial AND TS = *morpho*. We used dif-\n\
    ferent keywords combined with GeoAI terminologies according to the hydrological\
    \ sub-\nfields of interest, e.g., hydrological, optimization, calibration, water\
    \ quality, nutrient, pol-\nlutant, sediment, etc. In some cases, we also used\
    \ the NOT operator to further refine the \nsearching by excluding papers containing\
    \ certain words from other topics or subfields. \nFor example, we excluded water\
    \ quality terminologies to search for papers focusing \npurely on hydrological\
    \ modeling. Figure 1 shows the yearly publication statistics of the \nGeoAI and\
    \ ML applications in the different hydrological subfields. \n \nFigure 1. The\

    viewed journal publications. After gathering the initial list, we briefly reviewed\
    \ them to \nselect only papers within our review’s scope. The publication list\

    \ clustering techniques are oriented towards automatically grouping or\nclustering\
    \ the input data [42]. Several GeoAI clustering algorithms are used for geospa-\n\
    tial and time-series data clustering (Table 1). A clustering algorithm does not\
    \ require\nprior knowledge about the types and number of classes. More advanced\
    \ dimension re-\nduction clustering algorithms, such as autoencoders, can be used\
    \ for data compression,\nreconstruction, and anomalies detection [43].\nGeoAI\
    \ regression techniques are oriented towards evaluating the relationship between\n\
    response variables (dependent) and with one or more causative/independent variables\n\
    (predictors). There is a wide range of methods and techniques in this category,\
    \ ranging from\ntraditional regression methods to ensemble and boosting regression\
    \ trees, e.g., random\nforest, boosted regression, SVM, the traditional ANN, and\
    \ deep learning methods [39,40,44].\nThe GeoAI supervised learning techniques\
    \ are oriented towards identifying classes or\ncategories. They learn from the\
    \ given set of observations, called training data, and based\non that, classify\
    \ new observations into predeﬁned classes. Unlike regression-based ML\nalgorithms,\
    \ the output variable of the classiﬁcation is a category. The values represent\
    \ class\nnames or labels [39]. Several GeoAI classiﬁcation methods are available\
    \ (Table 1), e.g., SVM,\nrandom forest, ANN, and deep learning. GeoAI classiﬁcation\
    \ is widely used in remote\nsensing image classiﬁcation, landform pattern recognition,\
    \ and change detection.\nAn ML optimization algorithm is applied to find the best\
    \ solution out of the solution\nspace [45]. The ML optimization algorithm plays\
    \ an essential role in optimizing the objective\nfunction, e.g., identifying the\
    \ optimal parameter values of a complex model. ML optimiza-\ntion algorithms can\
    \ be broadly categorized into evolutionary computing and metaheuristic\nmethods\
    \ (Table 1). ML optimization shows a wide range of applications, e.g., catchment\n\
    models, parameter calibration by identifying the optimal set of parameter values\
    \ and scale of\nanalysis, identification of the best management scenarios for\
    \ a multi-objective operation, etc.\nAdditionally, the reinforced learning method\
    \ is another approach for problem optimization.\nWater 2022, 14, 2211\n5 of 38\n\
    It enables an agent(s) to learn in a dynamic environment by defining states, actions,\
    \ and\nmaximum rewards, using feedback from an agent’s actions and experiences\
    \ [46].\n4. Current GeoAI Applications in Integrated Hydrological and Fluvial\
    \ Systems Modeling\nGeoAI applications in hydrology and ﬂuvial studies are rapidly\
    \ increasing and replac-\ning the traditional methods. A reason for rapid GeoAI\
    \ adoption in hydrological sciences\nmight be linked to the progress in collecting\
    \ big hydrological datasets, using automatic\nsensors with internet transmission,\
    \ or the internet of things (IoT). Similarly, the evolution\nand increase in earth\
    \ observation satellites (conventional and nanosatellites), unmanned\naerial vehicles\
    \ (UAV), light detection and ranging (LiDAR), and other surveying technolo-\n\
    gies produce high-resolution geospatial data, allowing better landscape characterization.\n\
    GeoAI allows the harnessing of big and high-dimensional data to better understand\
    \ the hy-\ndrological processes in a particular system. Speciﬁcally, GeoAI provides\
    \ new data analytic\ntools to the entire data processing cycle, such as sensor\
    \ data fusion, hydrological modeling,\ndata assimilation, multi-objective scenario\
    \ optimization, smart decision support, evaluation\nof climate change impact,\
    \ construction of early warning systems, and geo-visualization.\nTherefore, GeoAI\
    \ greatly enhances and supports decision making in integrated water\nresources\
    \ management (IWRM) and nexus approaches [47]. Figure 2 depicts a GeoAI\napplication\

    \ Hydrological and Hydraulic Modeling\nWater ﬂow in the catchments and river networks\
    \ is a complex and stochastic process,\noperating in different spatio-temporal\
    \ scales and characterized by non-stationarity, dy-\nnamism, and non-linearity\
    \ [48,49]. These properties have limited the development of a\nreliable hydrological\
    \ and hydraulic prediction model that can be generalized to a large\ngeographical\
    \ area. The increasing sensor-based, high-frequency (sub-hourly) hydrological\n\
    data collection and the high spatial and temporal resolution mapping of land cover\
    \ and\ntopography have enhanced the understanding of hydrological processes. This\
    \ fact has led\nto the development of more sophisticated physical-based hydrological\
    \ models. However,\nthese models are computationally expensive and limited to\
    \ small-scale applications. Alter-\nnatively, several data-driven GeoAI methods\
    \ have emerged for hydrological and hydraulic\nclassiﬁcation and prediction at\
    \ multiple spatial-temporal scales. Table 2 shows examples of\nthe current applications\
    \ of the GeoAI in hydrological and hydraulic modeling.\nTable 2. Selected GeoAI\

    Limitations: The model seems to be under development.\n[62]\n4.1.1. Hydrological\
    \ System Classiﬁcation\nThe classiﬁcation of the different types of hydrological\
    \ systems is one of the most\nwidely applied modeling tasks in hydrology and ecohydrology.\
    \ It aims to ﬁnd similarities\nbetween different hydrological systems, e.g., those\
    \ based on the hydrological response, the\nhydromorphological and climatic characteristics,\
    \ and other variables. Unsupervised GeoAI\nalgorithms, such as K-mean clustering\
    \ [63] and SOM [64,65], have been applied to catch-\nment classiﬁcation. Both\
    \ algorithms organize multidimensional input data through linear\nand non-linear\
    \ techniques, depending on the intrinsic similarity of the data themselves.\n\
    Several studies highlight the SOM nonlinear techniques for producing robust and\
    \ consis-\ntent hydrological classiﬁcation [66–68], even though the classiﬁcation\
    \ consistency is highly\ninﬂuenced by the quality of the input variables [69].\
    \ Additionally, where training data is\navailable, supervised GeoAI methods have\
    \ produced highly accurate and biophysically\nmeaningful catchment classiﬁcation\
    \ [70,71].\n4.1.2. Hydrological Data Fusion and Geospatial Downscaling\nIntegrated\
    \ hydrological modeling requires the extensive data collocation of different\n\
    components of the hydrological system in various spatial and temporal scales.\
    \ Therefore, it\nis necessary to complete data and/or create new data by integrating\
    \ several datasets from\ndifferent sources, resolutions, and measurement noisiness\
    \ [72]. This approach is called\ndata fusion. Data fusion can increase the measurement\
    \ quality and reliability, estimate\nunmeasured states, and increase spatial and\
    \ temporal coverage. Several probabilistic and\nGeoAI data fusion techniques are\
    \ available [73,74]. The commonly used GeoAI techniques\nin data fusion are non-linear\
    \ Bayesian regression, ANN, RF, and deep learning [73–76].\nThese methods provide\
    \ several advantages in representing non-linear, complex, and lagged\nrelationships\
    \ in different hydrological datasets. GeoAI data fusion is also applied to\nautomatic\
    \ data denoising and anomaly detection and remote sensing data fusion [77].\n\
    GeoAI data fusion is also used in rain, soil moisture, and discharge data generation.\n\
    Sist et al. [78] introduce the ANN-based data fusion of multispectral (visible\
    \ and infrared)\nsatellite data with radar (microwave) satellite data to improve\
    \ rainy area mapping and the\nestimation of the precipitation amount. Zhuo and\
    \ Han [79] used data fusion to generate soil\nmoisture products from satellite\
    \ data, land surface temperature, and multi-angle surface\nbrightness reﬂectance\
    \ and were able to signiﬁcantly increase the availability of daily soil\nWater\
    \ 2022, 14, 2211\n9 of 38\nmoisture products. Fehri et al. [80] used the best\
    \ linear unbiased predictor data fusion\ntechnique to generate discharge data\
    \ from crowdsourced data and existing monitoring\nsystems. There are more examples\
    \ of using data fusion in data integration in areas other\nthan in improving knowledge,\
    \ which could be the next step to be further explored.\nEnvironmental geospatial\
    \ data, particularly remote sensing data, are usually measured\nat different spatial\
    \ and temporal scales; high-temporal resolution data are usually measured\nat\
    \ coarse (low) spatial resolution, and ﬁne (high) spatial resolution data are\
    \ obtained with\nlow temporal frequency [77,81]. Therefore, combining the different\
    \ datasets by downscaling\nmethods is necessary to generate spatio-temporal high-resolution\
    \ data. GeoAI-based\ndownscaling has shown several advantages. For example, CNN\
    \ is frequently used for\ndownscaling coarse-resolution to ﬁne-resolution precipitation\
    \ products, using different\nstatic and dynamic variables as predictors [82,83].\
    \ These studies have shown that CNN\nachieves different degrees of accuracy, depending\
    \ on the precipitation rate and the condition\ncomplexity; it has, e.g., lower\
    \ accuracy in extreme wet conditions [83]. Other studies have\nshown a higher\
    \ downscaling accuracy of GeoAI methods by having a spatial component in\nthe\
    \ model, e.g., spatial RF vs. RF in downscaling daily fractional snow cover [84]\
    \ and land\nsurface temperature from MODIS data [85–87].\n4.1.3. Spatial Prediction\
    \ of Hydrological Variables\nThe application of GeoAI in hydrological spatial\
    \ prediction is diverse; it can be\nused, for example, in the risk mapping of\
    \ hydrological extremes such as ﬂood and\ndrought [88–90]. In particular, GeoAI\
    \ is widely applied in ﬂood mapping, using satel-\nlite imagery, UAVs, high resolution\
    \ LiDAR topographic data, and automatic water level\nsensors [91–93]. The common\
    \ GeoAI algorithms used, e.g., in ﬂood prediction are SVM,\nRF, ANN, and deep\
    \ learning [92–94]. The selection of the methods is variable and depends\non the\
    \ mapping objective, the system complexity, and the data availability [91]. In\
    \ areas\nwith limited data and/or complex systems, where nonlinear methods are\
    \ not easily in-\nterpretable, ANFIS soft computing has been applied with good\
    \ prediction accuracy and\nstrong generalization ability [95]. ANFIS combines\
    \ data and expert knowledge through a\nset of fuzzy semantic conditional rules\
    \ [96–98].\nAnother GeoAI application is the spatial prediction of hydrological\
    \ model variables,\ne.g., saturated hydraulic conductivity [99,100] and weather\
    \ data [101]. This is particularly\nuseful as spatial hydrological variables are\
    \ not available. Thus, they can only be predicted\nusing points observation and\
    \ surrogate spatial data such as remote sensing data. GeoAI\nspatial prediction\
    \ has shown advantages in modeling nonlinear processes. However, the\nprediction\
    \ quality depends on the quality and quantity of the observed data points and\
    \ the\napplied GeoAI method [102].\n4.1.4. Hydrological Process Modeling\nGeoAI\
    \ has shown the potential for accurate hydrological modeling, such as for rainfall-\n\
    runoff, river discharge, soil moisture dynamics, and groundwater table fluctuation\
    \ [95,103,104].\nThe non-linear nature of these processes is challenging to model\
    \ with simple empirical\nand physical-based models. Therefore, GeoAI methods such\
    \ as ANNs have proved to be\nbetter for modeling complex hydrological processes\
    \ and forecasting them in the short and\nlong term and in different management\
    \ scenarios [26]. However, traditional ANNs do not\nmodel sequential order data\
    \ such as time-series data. Therefore, a further development\nfor the temporal\
    \ dynamics of hydrological sequential events is the RNN and LSTM neural\nnetworks.\
    \ RNN and LSTM use the previous information in the sequence to produce the\ncurrent\
    \ output, although RNN is better designed to model short sequences only. In the\
    \ case\nof long temporal sequences of the antecedent conditions, LSTM is preferred.\
    \ LSTM uses an\nadditional ‘memory cell’ compared to RNN to maintain information\
    \ for long sequences or\nperiods of time [105,106]. This memory cell lets the\
    \ model learn longer-term dependencies,\ne.g., the effects of antecedent soil\
    \ moisture conditions on runoff generation [105,107]. LSTM\nis advantageous for\
    \ modeling hydrological processes in regions with strong seasonality,\nWater 2022,\
    \ 14, 2211\n10 of 38\nsuch as a northern climate with varying winter conditions\
    \ [91,105]. The LTSM model\nalso allows the use of multiple time-series predictors,\
    \ such as precipitation, temperature,\ndischarge, and time [58,108]. A further\
    \ extension of LSTM is created by combining it with\nCNN. In CNN, learning is\
    \ achieved through convolving an input with ﬁlter layers to speed\nup parameter\
    \ optimization [107,109]. Combining CNNs and LSTM encodes both the spatial\nand\
    \ the temporal information [87,110]. LSTM techniques can also be coupled with\
    \ other\nsignal-processing algorithms such as wavelet transformation (WT). WT\
    \ is applied to time-\nseries data decomposition, e.g., the decomposition of high-\
    \ and low-frequency ﬂow signals,\nthe identiﬁcation of seasonality and trend,\
    \ the decomposition of non-stationary signals,\nand data denoising [30]. Denoised\
    \ data are used as inputs for the LSTM model [111].\nAnother approach is to use\
    \ a physical-based model coupled with GeoAI, e.g., for\nrunoff and ﬂood prediction\
    \ [19,112,113]. Overall, the output of the physical-based model is\nused as the\
    \ input for GeoAI model training. For example, Noori and Kalin [14] used the\n\
    SWAT model to simulate daily streamﬂow and estimate baseﬂow and stormﬂow, which\n\
    were used as inputs for ANNs. The beneﬁt of this approach is that once the model\
    \ is\ntrained, it can perform orders of magnitude faster than the original physical-based\
    \ models\nwithout impairing prediction accuracy [17]. Another beneﬁt of the hybrid\
    \ modeling is that\na trained model, e.g., in catchment hydrological modeling,\
    \ can achieve better performance\nfor other catchments than the uncalibrated process-based\
    \ models [105,112].\nOverall, most of the GeoAI models achieved higher prediction\
    \ accuracy than the\nphysical-based hydrological models. However, there are several\
    \ types of GeoAI algorithms,\nwith different architectures and mathematical formulations\
    \ (e.g., ANN, CNN, and LSTM) to\nperform similar tasks. In addition, different\
    \ types of predictor variables and data sampling\nsizes are used, making the GeoAI\
    \ model performance comparison challenging. GeoAI\nmodels are less physically\
    \ interpretable, as they do not explicitly represent the physical\nlaws governing\
    \ the hydrological processes. Therefore, their causal inference is still limited.\n\
    GeoAI applications are currently oriented towards hydrological prediction. GeoAI\
    \ has the\npotential to provide accurate and timely information which is applicable\
    \ to large areas, and\nusing data from IoT sensors and cloud computing, it can\
    \ deliver real-time prediction [114].\n4.1.5. Hydraulic Modeling\nThe new generation\
    \ of very-high-resolution river bathymetry has improved the 1D,\n2D, and 3D hydraulic\
    \ modeling of rivers [115,116]. River hydraulic models have been\nwidely used\
    \ in the estimation of ﬂood extent, water depth and velocity, sediment transport,\n\
    and the assessment of ﬂuvial morphodynamics [5,11,117]. However, very complex\
    \ hy-\ndraulic models (3D) are data and computationally demanding and restricted\
    \ to small-scale\napplications. Hydraulic modeling is sometimes inconsistent and\
    \ does not represent all the\nbio-physical processes occurring in the natural\
    \ ﬂuvial environment [118,119]. In addition,\nthe numerical solving approach of\
    \ the hydraulic model results in high numerical instability\ndue to sensitivity\
    \ to the initial and boundary conditions, model structure, and spatial\nand temporal\
    \ discretization [120]. Thus, the GeoAI method has emerged as a promising\ntool\
    \ for hydraulic modeling in large-scale and natural systems [19,119,121,122].\
    \ Emerging\ndeep learning applications in computer ﬂuid dynamics have also shown\
    \ potential for the\nmodeling of turbulent and complex ﬂow structures [123–125].\
    \ Additionally, coupling the\nhydraulic model with the Bayesian GeoAI methods\
    \ improves hydraulic modeling over a\nbroad range of spatiotemporal scales and\
    \ physical processes [126].\n4.1.6. Hydrological Data Assimilation\nHydrological\
    \ data assimilation (DA) is a state estimation theory that assumes that\nmodels\
    \ are an imperfect representation of the system and that hydrological data might\
    \ con-\ntain noise. Both can also contain different types of information and be\
    \ complementary [127].\nDA aims to harness the information in the hydrological\
    \ model and in the observations to\napproximate the true state of the system,\
    \ considering its uncertainty statistically [127–129].\nDA methods include linear\
    \ dynamics (e.g., Kalman ﬁlter, the most popular state estimation\nWater 2022,\
    \ 14, 2211\n11 of 38\nmethod) and nonlinear dynamics [127]. The DA methods can\
    \ be related to ML. Data fusion\nand DA use similar techniques, but the problem\
    \ formulation differs [130].\nIn hydrological modeling, the ML-based DA is the\
    \ most common type of coupling of\nML and the physical-based model, the so-called\
    \ loosely hybrid hydrological model [131].\nDA updates the state system predicted\
    \ by a physical-based model at a given time or place\nwith observational data,\
    \ using Bayesian approximation such as the ensemble Kalman ﬁlter\n(EnKF) [127]\
    \ or ML methods, e.g., ANN, RNN, and LSTM [132]. Both the DA and the ML\nmethods\
    \ solve an inverse problem, expressed as the model y = h(x,w), where h is the\
    \ model\nfunction, x represents the state/feature variable, w is the parameters/weights\
    \ of the model,\nand y is the observations/labels in DA/ML, respectively. DA is\
    \ oriented to ﬁnd the true\nstate of the system (x) from the observation and ML\
    \ is commonly oriented to ﬁnd model\nparameters or weight (w) from the observation.\
    \ DA holds w constant to estimate x; ML\nholds x constant to estimate w; see [133]\
    \ for a detailed revision.\nMany studies have shown that ANN data assimilation\
    \ outperforms conventional DA,\nparticularly for complex and non-linear response\
    \ systems [61]. An additional development\nof ML-based DA methods is the so-called\
    \ deep DA [132], which trains deep learning neural\nnetworks such as LSTM for\
    \ high dynamic systems. Deep DA has shown potential for\naccurate prediction for\
    \ periods or sites where observations are unavailable and conventional\nDA cannot\
    \ be applied to reduce the model error [132].\n4.2. Modeling Optimization Problems\
    \ for Hydrological Model Calibration and Decision\nSupport System\n4.2.1. Hydrological\
    \ Model Calibration\nIn hydrological modeling, the inverse modeling approach is\
    \ widely applied. In inverse\nmodeling, the model features and parameter values\
    \ are unknown, and those are identiﬁed\nby minimizing the error between the model\
    \ output and the observed data [134,135]. The\nmodel feature identiﬁcation includes\
    \ the deﬁnition of the main hydrological processes, the\nmathematical equations\
    \ representing it, the boundary conditions, and the time regime [136].\nThe parameter\
    \ identiﬁcations encompass the identifying of the model optimal parameter\nset\
    \ values that reproduce the observed data acceptably [136]. In highly parameterized\n\
    models, identifying the optimal values of the parameters is challenging and represents\
    \ a\nsubstantial part of the modeling work. Usually, there is not a single set\
    \ of optimal values\nof parameters that can simulate the observed data well but\
    \ a set of optimal parameters\nvalues that can achieve similar model performance.\
    \ This modeling phenomenon is called\nthe non-uniqueness or equiﬁnality problem\
    \ [137]. The hydrological model calibration often\nrequires specialized optimization\
    \ algorithms, and several ML-based calibration algorithms\nhave been developed\
    \ to support model calibration (see Table 3 for examples).\nTable 3. Selected\

    [148]\nHydrological models are often calibrated with a single objective function,\
    \ although\nadequate and fast multi-objective optimization techniques exist, which\
    \ better support the\nseveral output variables [141]. There are many optimization\
    \ algorithms, meta-heuristic and\nML-based, for model parameter calibration, such\
    \ as particle swarm optimization (PSO),\ngrey wolf optimization (GWO), genetic\
    \ algorithms (GAs), genetic programming (GP),\nstrength Pareto evolutionary algorithms\
    \ (SPEA), micro-genetic algorithms (micro-GA),\nand Pareto-archived evolution\
    \ strategies (PAES). Depending on the selected performance\nindicators of the\
    \ model, the best model for hydrologists varied. According to the free lunch\n\
    theorem [149], this is not expected to change for a while; it proposes that no\
    \ one model ﬁts\nall. In any case, all the models performed well. See Yusoff et\
    \ al. [150] and Ibrahim et al. [45]\nfor a speciﬁc review of optimization algorithms.\n\
    Meta-heuristic optimization algorithms, which are mostly inspired by the biologi-\n\
    cal/behavioral strategies of animals, provide a good solution to optimization\
    \ problems, par-\nticularly with incomplete or imperfect information or limited\
    \ computational capacity [151].\nAn advantage of these algorithms is that they\
    \ make relatively few assumptions about the\noptimization problems and reduce\
    \ the computational demand by randomly sampling a sub-\nset of solutions, which\
    \ otherwise would be too large to be iterated entirely [151]. However,\nsome meta-heuristic\
    \ algorithms such as PSO may not guarantee that a globally optimal\nsolution will\
    \ be found, particularly when the number of decision variables or dimensions\n\
    being optimized is large [45]. The GA is inspired by genetic evolutionary concepts,\
    \ such\nas the non-dominated sorted genetic algorithm II (NSGA-II). The genetically\
    \ adaptive\nmulti-objective method (AMALGAM) [152] has been applied for multi-objective,\
    \ multi-site\ncalibration and to solve highly non-linear optimization problems\
    \ [144,153]. AMALGAM is\na multi-algorithm that blends the attributes of several\
    \ optimization algorithms (NSGA-II,\nPSO, the adaptive metropolis search, and\
    \ differential evolution) [144]. The GA has been\nshown to be well-suited for\
    \ hydrological models, such as the SWAT semi-distributed hy-\ndrological models,\
    \ which cannot be adequately calibrated by gradient-based calibration\nalgorithms\
    \ [144,153,154]. The objective function for each solution in a GA can be assessed\n\
    Water 2022, 14, 2211\n14 of 38\nin parallel computation, providing computational\
    \ efﬁciency [144]. Additional calibration\nmethods based on deep learning have\
    \ also been developed, outperforming many of the\nexisting evolutionary and regionalization\
    \ methods [20,146].\n4.2.2. Decision Support System for Integrated Water Resources\
    \ Management\nIntegrated water resources management (IWRM) deals with multiple\
    \ actors to con-\nsensually and communicatively integrate decisions in a hydrological\
    \ unit to ensure eq-\nuitable economic development and social welfare while assuring\
    \ hydrological system\nsustainability [155]. IWRM demands quality and timely information.\
    \ Hence, increasing au-\ntomation with GeoAI-based decision support systems is\
    \ thought to enhance IWRM [17,156].\nMulti-objective and scenario analysis are\
    \ typical applications of GeoAI techniques in IWRM\nto ﬁnd solutions for conﬂicting\
    \ objectives, forecast the impact of management strategies,\nand optimize hydrological\
    \ system operation [157,158]. We found widespread applications\nof GeoAI in reservoir\
    \ and water distribution optimization using ANN [159,160], assembled\nand deep\
    \ learning algorithms, and genetic programming [161,162]. Another application\n\
    is found in building a smart irrigation decision support system [147]. Here, partial\
    \ least\nsquare regression and the adaptive network-based fuzzy inference system\
    \ (ANFIS) are\nproposed as reasoning engines for automated decisions. An additional\
    \ example of arti-\nﬁcial intelligence application is the adaptive intelligent\
    \ dynamic urban water resource\nplanning [158]. It uses Markov’s decision process\
    \ to tackle complex water management\nproblems, predicting water demand, scheduling\
    \ management, ﬁnancial planning, tariff\nadjustment, and the optimization of water\
    \ supply operations [158] (See Table 3). Overall,\nthe GeoAI-based IWRM integrates\
    \ various types of algorithms to perform different tasks,\nsuch as prediction\
    \ and forecasting using various types of geospatial data, and optimization\nalgorithms\
    \ for management scenarios with multiple objectives. Algorithms such as ANFIS\n\
    are used for system reasoning to automate the decision support [157,158,163].\
    \ ANFIS\nallows the mimicking of human reasoning and decision making based on\
    \ a set of fuzzy\nIF-THEN rules. ANFIS has the learning capability to approximate\
    \ nonlinear functions and\ncan self-improve in order to adjust the membership\
    \ function parameters directly from the\ndata [164].\n4.3. Automatic Water Quality\
    \ Monitoring and Spatio-Temporal Prediction\n4.3.1. Automatic Water Quality Monitoring\n\
    The data collection of water quality with wireless sensor networks and internet\
    \ of\nthings (IoT) technologies is rapidly increasing and providing very-high-frequency\
    \ WQ data\n(sub-hourly) [165,166]. There is evidence that the high-frequency data\
    \ better represent the\ndynamics variation of river discharge and sediment and\
    \ solute ﬂuxes [167]. It enables the\nearly mitigation of ﬂoods and drinking water\
    \ problems [168,169]. High-frequency data can\nalso lead to a more precise and\
    \ accurate classiﬁcation of the biochemical status of rivers\nand lakes [170].\
    \ However, such sensors and devices are subject to failures, poor calibration,\n\
    and inaccurate data recording in certain conditions [171,172]. Therefore, automatic\
    \ data\nquality control, error and anomaly detection, sensor drift compensation,\
    \ and uncertainty\nassessment are important [171–173]. GeoAI showed advantages\
    \ in managing WQ sensor\nnetworks and sensor data fusion, such as fault detection,\
    \ data correction, and upgrades\nfrom different monitoring sensors by data fusion\
    \ [174]. See Table 4 for selected examples\nof GeoAI applications on WQ monitoring.\
    \ Additional applications of GeoAI are in the\ndetection, localization, and quantiﬁcation\
    \ of pollutant critical sources and critical periods\nof loading in monitoring\
    \ networks [175,176]. The most common GeoAI algorithms for WQ\nsensor fusion are\
    \ based on Bayesian algorithms, fuzzy set theory, genetic programming,\nANN, and\
    \ LSTM [177–180].\nWater 2022, 14, 2211\n15 of 38\nTable 4. Selected GeoAI applications\

    [191]\nMany WQ parameters cannot easily be measured in situ and in real time for\
    \ various\nreasons, such as high-cost sensors, low sampling rate, multiple processing\
    \ stages, and the\nrequirement of frequent cleaning and calibration. Therefore,\
    \ a common practice is the\nestimation of a particular WQ parameter value based\
    \ on other surrogate parameters, called\nsoft sensors [181,183,184]. ML techniques\
    \ showed higher accuracy in implementing soft\nsensors than conventional regression-based\
    \ models [181,183,184,192].\nThe ML method has also shown an advantage in automatic\
    \ hysteresis pattern analysis\nusing high-frequent water quality data with, e.g.,\
    \ restricted Boltzmann ANN [193]. A\nmore detailed hysteresis pattern classiﬁcation\
    \ allows the gaining of new insights into WQ\npollutants sources and drivers,\
    \ the inﬂuence of catchment and riverine features, the effect of\nantecedent conditions,\
    \ and the inﬂuence of changes in rainfall and snowmelt patterns [193].\n4.3.2.\
    \ Spatio-Temporal Water Quality Prediction\nWe found diverse applications of the\
    \ GeoAI methods in WQ spatio-temporal pattern\nanalysis, the classiﬁcation of\
    \ WQ, and the prediction of WQ variables and the pollutant\nloading estimation.\
    \ A detailed review of the ML application in WQ prediction is found\nin Rajaee\
    \ et al. [27], Nalouﬁ et al. [29], and Chen et al. [194]. Table 4 shows examplesof\n\
    GeoAI applications for this purpose. Commonly used GeoAI for WQ prediction and\n\
    classiﬁcation are unsupervised clustering such as k-means, density-based spatial\
    \ clustering\nof applications with noise (DBSCAN), and SOM, but also time-series\
    \ segmentation such as\ndynamic time warping [195]. Supervised ML classiﬁcation\
    \ and prediction algorithms for\nWQ are RF, SVM, the Bayesian network, and ANN,\
    \ and deep learning such as LSTM is also\nfrequently used [190,196,197].\nHigh-frequency\
    \ WQ monitoring data contains noise signals due to random and sys-\ntematic errors,\
    \ impairing the WQ prediction accuracy. Hence, combining data denoising\ntechniques\
    \ such as Fourier and wavelet transform with GeoAI improves WQ prediction.\nFor\
    \ example, Song et al. [198] found that combining synchro-squeezed wavelet transform\n\
    and an LSTM network substantially improved the WQ parameter prediction. Similarly,\
    \ Na-\njah Ahmed et al. [28] integrated wavelet discrete transform with the artiﬁcial\
    \ neuro-fuzzy\ninference system (WDT-ANFIS) to obtain high-accuracy prediction\
    \ of river WQ parameters.\nAdditionally, the WQ data usually have temporal autocorrelation\
    \ and multi-collinearity\nbetween the WQ parameters. To consider these characteristics\
    \ in the prediction models,\nZhou et al. (2020) [199] proposed an ML model based\
    \ on t-distributed stochastic neighbor\nembedding (t-SNE) and self-attention bidirectional\
    \ LSTM (SA-Bi-LSTM), demonstrating\nsubstantial WQ prediction improvement. Another\
    \ promising approach is uniform mani-\nfold approximation and projection (UMAP)\
    \ for multidimensional WQ data ordination and\nclassiﬁcation. Unlike other dimension\
    \ reduction methods, UMAP retains a global and local\ninformation structure, and\
    \ the data ordination is bio-physically meaningful [200].\nInland water has naturally\
    \ high spatial variation. It requires complex spatial pre-\ndiction models and\
    \ large datasets. The GeoAI have shown breakthroughs in spatial WQ\nprediction\
    \ by combining ﬁeld observations, remote sensing data, or UAV imagery. For\nexample,\

    \ areas or intensely monitored areas.\nAnother approach in WQ prediction is the\
    \ application of hybrid models and the\nintegration of physical-based models with\
    \ GeoAI methods, such as SVM, RF, ANN, and\nLSTM. Hybrid models usually outperformed\
    \ physical-based models. For example, Noori\net al. [188] found substantial improvement\
    \ in monthly nitrate, ammonium, and phosphate\nload prediction when using hybrid\
    \ SWAT-ANN models. Hybrid models are also helpful\nfor unmonitored catchment predictions\
    \ [188]. The hybrid model also improves GeoAI\nexplanatory and generalization\
    \ capability, although some disadvantages observed in the\nphysical-based model,\
    \ such as extreme values not being well predicted, persisted in the\nhybrid models.\
    \ Similarly, the process-guided recurrent neural network (RNN), which\ncombines\
    \ the biophysical principles of the process-based model and RNN, modeled the\n\
    seasonal variation of lake phosphorus loading with lower bias and better reproduced\
    \ the\nlong-term changes of phosphorus loading compared to using the physical-based\
    \ model\nand RNN independently [21].\nOverall, the GeoAI water quality prediction\
    \ depends not only on the selected algo-\nrithms and settings but also on the\
    \ WQ parameters, data size, and training data quality for\nthe learning models\
    \ [183,188,191].\n4.4. Machine Learning in Fluvial Geomorphic and Morphodynamic\
    \ Mapping\nFluvial geomorphology triggered the quantitative dynamic paradigm [201]\
    \ as an ap-\nproach to quantifying and understanding the processes of the ﬂuvial\
    \ environment [5]. The\nsimultaneous development of techniques such as multispectral\
    \ satellite images, synthetic\naperture radar (SAR), LiDAR, UAV imagery, structure\
    \ from motion photogrammetry (SfM),\nmultibeam sonar (sound navigation and ranging),\
    \ among others, has resulted in an un-\nprecedented, seamless characterization\
    \ and quantiﬁcation of the ﬂuvial environment and\nits dynamics [202–204]. This\
    \ geospatial dataset explosion, as in many other disciplines, has\nresulted in\
    \ the perfect foundation for applying GeoAI methods in ﬂuvial geomorphology.\n\
    Here, we reviewed the recent GeoAI applications in ﬂuvial geomorphological studies.\n\

    Objective: To classify ﬂuvial scenes in 11 rivers in Canada, Italy, Japan,\nthe\
    \ United Kingdom, and Costa Rica.\nAdvantages: The NasNet-CNN model outperformed\
    \ other supervised\nclassiﬁers, e.g., maximum likelihood, MLP, and RF. The NasNet-CNN\n\
    model can be transferable to other rivers with no training data,\nobtaining good\
    \ classiﬁcation accuracy of ﬂuvial land cover.\nLimitations: CNN is sensitive\
    \ to the hyperparameters deﬁnition. CNN\nwas also affected by imbalanced training\
    \ data size in land cover\nclasses. Some features were misclassiﬁed.\n[205]\n\
    Fuzzy-CNN\nSoftware: Python based. Dependency\npackages: TensorFlow\nObjective:\
    \ To predict vegetation, bare sediment, and water bodies at a\nsub-pixel scale\
    \ with Sentinel-2 images, trained with high resolution\nUAV images. Study areas\
    \ were Sesia, Po, and Paglia Rivers in Italy.\nAdvantages: Fuzzy-CNN models were\
    \ successfully used to provide\ncontinuous and crisp subpixel classiﬁcation of\
    \ Sentinel-2 imagery.\nThe model was transferable to satellite images with different\n\
    acquisition time. It can be used for annual change detection.\nLimitations: UAV\
    \ reference data obtained with manual OBIA was\nhighly time-consuming. The process\
    \ was computationally expensive\ndue to the “super-resolution” process used to\
    \ feed the CNN. The\nmodel was tested only in Mediterranean drainage basins.\n\

    \ be attributed to site features based, e.g., on their\nhydraulic, habitat, or\
    \ vegetation types. The model settings seem to be\ntransferable to other rivers\
    \ without training data.\nLimitations: The algorithm showed misclassiﬁcation of\
    \ small ﬂuvial\nentities, e.g., shallow water areas with rippled surface, water\

    \ scale classiﬁcation resulted in a\nmore accurate estimation of RWW than the\
    \ conventional hard\nimage classiﬁcation.\nLimitations: No full spectral unmixing\
    \ was possible due to the\nspectral variations of land cover classes and the nonlinear\

    \ when\nidentifying 4 different river landforms (crevasse channels, swales,\n\
    point bars, levees). Overﬁtting was controlled in the study by\nlimiting the number\
    \ of input variables.\nLimitations: Object-based RF classiﬁcations needed visual\n\
    interpretation, ﬁeld observations, and high-resolution data. PCAs did\nnot help\

    \ successfully clustered the entire river\nnetwork into 6 valley bottom segments\
    \ of varying length.\nLimitations: The resulting cluster is unlabeled and needs\
    \ expert\nrecognition. Only used a low number of the variables selected (slope\n\
    and valley bottom width). The model was validated with a\nbasin-scale expert mapping\

    \ TMA performed better than SVM in spatially complex\nchannel morphologies (e.g.,\
    \ partially submerged sediment deposits,\nsediment bar structures) due to its\
    \ capability to incorporate both\nspectral and spatial information.\nLimitations:\
    \ Validation relies on expert knowledge and previous maps.\nSelection of ancillary\
    \ data types depends on expert decision and the\ndelineation accuracy of TMA.\
    \ In addition, the low spectral dimension\nof the images limited the pixel-based\

    \ consists of an auto-\nmatic extraction of ﬂuvial features at a ﬁne scale by\
    \ integrating larger and multidimen-\nWater 2022, 14, 2211\n22 of 38\nsional datasets,\
    \ using unsupervised classiﬁers (e.g., K-means, SOM), supervised classiﬁers\n\
    (e.g., RF, SVM, ANN, deep learning, CNN), or by combining both methods, e.g.,\
    \ K-means\nwith ANN. Most of the reviewed articles were focused on the development\
    \ of the methods\nand workﬂow, the testing of new applications, or the comparison\
    \ of algorithm perfor-\nmances [205,207,209], rather than the study of ﬂuvial\
    \ processes and underlying dynamics.\nThese applications of GeoAI provide the\
    \ basis to the discovery of new ﬂuvial patterns and\ntrends and increase knowledge\
    \ about ﬂuvial environments (e.g., Ling et al. 2019; Guillon\net al. 2020, Heasley\
    \ et al. 2020) [208,214,217].\nOverall, GeoAI outperforms conventional methods\
    \ of ﬂuvial landform classiﬁcation,\nreaching a classiﬁcation accuracy of over\
    \ 80%. Most common applications are found in river\nchannels and water body mapping\
    \ [208,216], the classiﬁcation of riverine landforms and\nvegetation successions\
    \ [213,214,219,220], the estimation of catchment hydrogeomorphic\ncharacteristics\
    \ (e.g., valley bottom, ﬂoodplain, and terrace) [212,221], and benthic and ﬁsh\n\
    habitat mapping [207,211,222,223].\nAnother application of GeoAI is the integration\
    \ of multiple techniques to provide\nmore accurate and very-high-resolution data\
    \ for ﬂuvial studies. For example, the ﬂuvial\nenvironment is highly dynamic and\
    \ demands frequent bathymetry surveys to understand\nthe change and morphodynamic\
    \ drivers in lakes and rivers. Emerging technologies,\nsuch as acoustic Doppler\
    \ current proﬁler (ADCP), green LiDAR, high-resolution image\nradiometric model,\
    \ and 3D cloud points generation with SfM, allow more frequent and\naccurate bathymetry\
    \ mapping [203,204]. However, each approach has limitations, e.g.,\nADCP collects\
    \ data only from areas where the sensor has passed, and it does not provide\n\
    continuous spatial scanning. It does not measure near-bank areas, and it is subject\
    \ to\nthe acoustic side-lobe effect [224]. Photogrammetry and the green LiDAR\
    \ method are\nsensitive to water turbidity and light penetration in the water\
    \ column [225,226]. Therefore,\nmultisource bathymetry modeling using the GeoAI\
    \ method increases the bathymetric data\naccuracy and reduces uncertainties due\
    \ to data quality in change detection. For example,\nADCP data, image radiometric-based\
    \ water depth, and SfM depth data can be integrated\nusing U-Net convolutional\
    \ neural networks [218,227].\nThe GeoAI approach, when using multi-temporal remote\
    \ sensing data, allows the\nmapping of a broader ﬂuvial landscape and its change,\
    \ thereby revealing spatiotemporal\nscales of ﬂuvial morphodynamics, as in e.g.,\
    \ Van Iersel et al. [228], Hemmelder et al. [229],\nand Boothroyd et al. [230].\
    \ There are different GeoAI approaches for automatic change\ndetection using multi-temporal\
    \ images such as generative adversarial networks (GAN),\nautoencoder, CNN, and\
    \ others, as presented by Shi et al. [231].\nAlthough GeoAI has been rapidly adopted\
    \ in ﬂuvial geomorphological studies, a\nwide spectrum of workﬂows and software\
    \ is found; many GeoAI approaches seem to be\nunder development and in the testing\
    \ stage. Therefore, without a general, consistent, and\nrobust workﬂow among them,\
    \ it is difﬁcult to generalize and compare the GeoAI methods\nperformance and\
    \ overall accuracies, as well as the study results.\nThe current limitations of\
    \ GeoAI methods in ﬂuvial studies are that the classiﬁcation\nquality is highly\
    \ dependent on expert knowledge. The unsupervised classiﬁcation output is\noften\
    \ inconsistent, and the cluster classes do not have direct geomorphic or ﬂuvial\
    \ process\nmeaning and need a post-classiﬁcation labeling. Supervised GeoAI classiﬁers\
    \ require\na large training sampling, and the training data quality is highly\
    \ dependent on expert\nknowledge. In addition, many of the studies using GeoAI\
    \ to classify ﬂuvial landform or\nriver typologies have been conducted in areas\
    \ where an extensive quantity of previous\nstudies and data collection exists\
    \ [212,214]. Therefore, its application in poorly sampled\nareas is somewhat limited.\n\
    In many cases, GeoAI is enhanced with the use of ﬁne-scale ﬂuvial geomorphic\n\
    mapping, e.g., LiDAR or UAV-based images, which are still restricted to pilot\
    \ areas, mostly\nin Western countries. In addition, several different landform\
    \ class names are used to rename\nﬁne-scale ﬂuvial landforms, and therefore, a\
    \ standardized ﬂuvial landform taxonomy is\nlacking [232].\nWater 2022, 14, 2211\n\
    23 of 38\nAnother limitation of supervised GeoAI applications is the misclassiﬁcation\
    \ of el-\nements out of the GeoAI training range, as presented, e.g., in Carbonneau\
    \ et al. [205].\nMoreover, the use of very different methods for assessing the\
    \ GeoAI algorithm’s per-\nformance and accuracy may lead to inconsistencies in\
    \ the validity of results, e.g., map\ncross-tabulation often uses limited validation\
    \ points rather than areal-based reference data,\ndue to the lack of geomorphological\
    \ reference maps at a very ﬁne scale. Another issue\nwith regard to performance\
    \ and accuracy assessments is the use of scalar error statistics,\nsuch as root\
    \ mean square error, which may not be reliable in ﬂuvial mapping. Here the\nresulting\
    \ error is a complex combination of random and systematic components, and the\n\
    isotropy and stationary assumptions do not apply to the ﬂuvial process [233].\
    \ It is also\nheavily inﬂuenced by a small percentage of classiﬁcation errors,\
    \ which lead to incorrect\nrankings of overall model performances or to prediction\
    \ error [206]. Therefore, a more\nconsistent and comparable GeoAI-based ﬂuvial\
    \ mapping accuracy assessment is needed.\n5. GeoAI Causal and Predictive Inference\
    \ Capability\n5.1. Renewed Data-Driven Research\nObservational and experimental\
    \ studies have been the basis of understanding the\nempirical relationships of\
    \ physical processes occurring in the earth and the development\nof the mechanical\
    \ or physical-based models to predict them [234]. With the substantial\nincrease\
    \ in observational data and the development of GeoAI methods, empirical studies\n\
    have been renewed with data-driven models [17,235]. Unlike traditional statistical\
    \ models,\nGeoAI methods do not rely on a formal assumption about the data structure\
    \ and types of\ndata distribution such as normality. They are more ﬂexible and\
    \ adaptable for nonlinear\nand high-dimensional data. GeoAI methods automatically\
    \ identify and exploit correlations\nand patterns (classiﬁcation) in the data\
    \ to make predictions. For example, an ANN, with\nmany hidden layers and free\
    \ parameters estimated by training and arbitrary ﬁtting curves,\nconverts inputs\
    \ to outputs by simply minimizing error variances [39].\nTo date, in most of the\
    \ GeoAI applications for hydrological studies the cause–effect\nrelationship inference\
    \ has been limited, because the multiple driven factors and interactions\nbetween\
    \ the used variables and scales are not explicitly represented in the models [50,123].\n\
    In addition, the GeoAI and ML internal hyper-parameter optimization is not explicitly\n\
    stated in most of the modeling studies. For this reason, GeoAI methods are often\
    \ called\n“black-box” models [236]. See Table 6 for the characteristics of physical-based\
    \ and GeoAI\nhydrological models. Therefore, causal inferences might be questionable\
    \ without robust\nassumptions and the veracity of the assumed data structure [237].\
    \ Thus, most GeoAI\nmodels are mostly inductive approaches, mainly oriented for\
    \ operational prediction and\nforecasting work, such as early warning systems.\
    \ Nevertheless, GeoAI models have the\npotential to reveal unknown associations\
    \ and complex patterns of hydrology processes\nby integrating more high-dimensional\
    \ and multi-source data than traditional methods.\nBy implementing proper model\
    \ interpretation and explainability methods, they can also\nextend GeoAI applications\
    \ for causal inference [236,237].\nTable 6. Characteristics of physical-based\

    GeoAI models may only be applicable within their speciﬁc training data or calibrated\n\
    ranges [238], unless the modeling scheme and variables used can be argued to be\
    \ generally\nvalid, e.g., representing general laws such as conservation and momentum\
    \ laws that govern\nnatural processes [234]. GeoAI modeling generalization is\
    \ also a challenging problem from\nthe perspective of model performance assessment,\
    \ depending on the model complexity,\nvariables, and training dataset size. A\
    \ very simple model cannot learn the problem being\nmodeled (underﬁtting problem),\
    \ whereas a highly complex model with a large dataset\nmight overﬁt the training\
    \ dataset (overﬁtting problem). Both cases are not generalizable\nor applicable\
    \ to new datasets. Current GeoAI generalization approaches are based on\nﬁnding\
    \ an optimal tradeoff between training and validation accuracy, using regularization,\n\
    weight decay, ensembles, and other approaches in the model training stage [40].\
    \ However,\nthe decision boundary in complex models becomes sensitive to data\
    \ size and outliers,\nmodel architecture, and hyper-parameter optimization. It\
    \ has also been observed that\ndifferent sets of the model architecture and hyper-parameters\
    \ can produce a similar model\nperformance, leading to the non-uniqueness modeling\
    \ problem [50,239].\n5.3. GeoAI Data Requirement for Reliably Prediction\nGeoAI\
    \ models depend on the quality and quantity of the data. The amount of data\n\
    required for them depends on many factors, such as the complexity of the hydrological\n\
    system and the applied GeoAI algorithm [47]. A complex system with more sophisticated\n\
    GeoAI methods will demand a large and multidimensional dataset [42]. For example,\n\
    deep/extreme learning algorithms usually demand large sample sizes to compute\
    \ accept-\nable results [240]. Current hydrological and geospatial data are increasing\
    \ rapidly, fostered\nby the development of automatic monitoring systems and land\
    \ surveying technologies.\nHowever, the data quantity (volume) and quality (veracity\
    \ and value) vary; the data\ntypes are diverse (unstructured, structures, spatial,\
    \ non-spatial, etc.), and the datasets\nusually come from different sources. Datasets\
    \ with these characteristics are called big\ndata [241,242] and require advanced\
    \ and new methodologies to integrate them with GeoAI\nmodels properly.\nWater\
    \ 2022, 14, 2211\n25 of 38\n5.4. GeoAI Capacity to Provide Novel Physical Insights\n\
    GeoAI data-driven research and data mining are increasingly used to gain information\n\
    from data, elucidate systems behavior, reveal new insights about the system functioning,\n\
    and detect change in the system responses [17]. There are several examples of\
    \ GeoAI\napplications in hydrological modeling [91,105,107,243]. Recent studies\
    \ applying deep\nlearning to rainfall-runoff simulation indicate that there is\
    \ signiﬁcantly more information\nin large-scale hydrological data sets than hydrologists\
    \ have been able to translate into\ntheory or models [129]. GeoAI has also revealed\
    \ new hydrological patterns and trends,\nusing heterogeneous data from different\
    \ sources and quality [244,245]. Therefore, novel\ndata-driven modeling provides\
    \ the potential to gain new information and knowledge and\na better understanding\
    \ of the hydrological system and its changes [129,235].\n6. GeoAI Research Trends\
    \ in Integrated Hydrological and Fluvial Systems Modeling\n6.1. Toward Transdisciplinary\
    \ GeoAI Research in Hydrological Modeling\nNowadays, earth science has mostly\
    \ adopted GeoAI approaches developed in other\nﬁelds, particularly computer science.\
    \ GeoAI is also an active ﬁeld of research in advanced\nhydrological modeling,\
    \ providing new insights into hydrological system functioning,\nadvantages in\
    \ computational efﬁciency, and prediction accuracy. Nevertheless, it depends\n\
    on how the hydrological GeoAI model has been set up by the user, the quantity\
    \ and quality\nof the data, and the types and number of variables used.\nGeoAI\
    \ methods can be integrated with other data analysis techniques, e.g., Fourier\n\
    and wavelet transformation, to remove noise and provide better hydrological feature\n\
    extraction [30,198]. Hence a transdisciplinary approach is demanded to ensure\
    \ insightful\nresearch on GeoAI applications in hydrological and ﬂuvial studies\
    \ [235]. This is particularly\nrelevant as the complexity of the GeoAI models\
    \ is increasing continuously, and model\nparametrization and parallel computing\
    \ solutions require expert knowledge for proper\nGeoAI technology adoption [18,240].\
    \ Similarly, these issues also arise when hydrological\nscience principles are\
    \ not explicitly integrated with the GeoAI data-driven models, resulting\nin a\
    \ limited explainability of the underlying physical laws that govern hydrological\
    \ and\nhydraulic processes [50,129].\n6.2. Augmenting GeoAI Prediction Capability\
    \ with Open Data and Crowdsourced Data\nGeoAI models demand a large amount of\
    \ training data. Although data collection\ntechnology has progressed substantially,\
    \ only a few geographical areas or pilot hydrological\nsystems are well equipped.\
    \ For example, very few catchments have implemented IoT hy-\ndrological monitoring\
    \ technology. GeoAI models will demand a rapid and massive increase\nin data collection.\
    \ The current open-access policy of many governmental environmental\nagencies,\
    \ related to climatological, hydrological, and environmental data, enhances the\n\
    data-driven research and GeoAI applications, particularly in Western countries.\
    \ Similarly,\nopen access to high-resolution topographical and earth observation\
    \ data (e.g., NASA and\nthe ESA-EU Copernicus Programme) also accelerates the\
    \ development of GeoAI-based hy-\ndrological models [241,246]. Additionally, the\
    \ current trend of implementing open-access\ntraining libraries, e.g., training\
    \ data for land cover classiﬁcation, is valuable, but more\nspecialized hydrogeomorphic\
    \ labeled data are still under development.\nCitizen science also plays a key\
    \ role in complementing and increasing data collection\nworldwide. There are several\
    \ examples of how hydrological crowdsourcing enhances hy-\ndrological data availability\
    \ for scientiﬁc research, using images and social media data [247]\nand low-cost\
    \ data loggers [248,249], but the success and quality of hydrological crowd-\n\
    sourcing are variable, depending on the regions, the instrument used, and the\
    \ variables\nreported [250]. GeoAI-based hydrological model development will beneﬁt\
    \ from crowd-\nsourcing data collection.\nWater 2022, 14, 2211\n26 of 38\n6.3.\
    \ From Physical-Based and GeoAI Hybrid Models to Fully Integrated\nGeoAI–Physical-Based\
    \ Models\nPhysical-based and GeoAI hydrological models have had different paths\
    \ of devel-\nopment. As discussed previously, a physical-based model is derived\
    \ from empirical and\nexperimental research; meanwhile, a GeoAI model is derived\
    \ from data sciences techniques.\nPhysical-based and GeoAI models are not complementary\
    \ per se, but in many cases,\nthe integration of both approaches has shown a great\
    \ potential to improve hydrological\nmodeling [18,129]. Currently, there is a\
    \ different level of integration; most of them are\nstill so-called loose integrated\
    \ models, where the GeoAI and the physical-based models\nwork independently. The\
    \ GeoAI method is used for data preparation and the reﬁning\nof physical-based\
    \ models, e.g., data fusion, ad hoc parameter optimizations, and data\nassimilation.\
    \ In some cases, the outputs of physical-based models are used to train GeoAI\n\
    models [19,188,251]. Currently, full GeoAI-physical integration is under development,\
    \ em-\nbedding machine learning solutions into physical-based models or developing\
    \ physically\nguided GeoAI models; see, e.g., Hanson et al. [21]. Both approaches\
    \ tend to overcome\ncurrent GeoAI model limitations by providing more physical\
    \ explanatory power, physically\nconsistent and robust prediction, and a high\
    \ level of generalization.\n6.4. From Small-Scale to Global-Scale Hydrological\
    \ Modeling\nIn recent years, substantial attention has been paid to large-scale\
    \ and global-scale\nhydrological modeling [252–254]. Although only experimental\
    \ catchments have sufﬁcient\ndata to perform a reliable hydrological prediction,\
    \ the global availability of climatological,\nhydrological, and remote sensing\
    \ data allows for the parametrizing of the global-level\nhydrological model. This\
    \ planet-wide dataset can only be handled thanks to a combined\nadvancement in\
    \ GeoAI application and cloud computing development, e.g., Google Earth\nEngine,\
    \ CoLab, SEPAL [255], and many other national high-performance computer clusters.\n\
    However, global-scale hydrological modeling still involves a high level of prediction\n\
    uncertainty [256,257], but current progress in the development of physical-based\
    \ GeoAI\nmodels and remote sensing data assimilation can improve global modeling\
    \ accuracy.\n6.5. Automation of Hydrological and Fluvial System Modeling\nGeoAI\
    \ applications are increasing the automation of hydrological prediction and fore-\n\
    casting [258]. Some hydrological modeling has already applied internal self-calibration\
    \ [259–261].\nSimilarly, there is also substantial progress in developing automated\
    \ machine learning\n(autoML) by self-tuning the models’ hyperparameters, such\
    \ as, e.g., autotune and AUTO-\nSKLEARN [262,263]. The hyperparameters drive both\
    \ the efﬁciency of the model training\nprocess and the resulting model quality\
    \ [262]. Therefore, a self-tuning module will enhance\na more rapid adoption of\
    \ GeoAI models in hydrological modeling, and the integration of\nphysical-based\
    \ and GeoAI models can improve autonomous hydrological prediction.\nSimilarly,\
    \ self-supervised image classiﬁcation, particularly that developed in the\nrobotic\
    \ ﬁeld [264], is rapidly being adopted in hydrological studies in, e.g., satellite\
    \ im-\nage classiﬁcation, ﬂuvial landform classiﬁcation, and landform change detection.\
    \ Self-\nsupervised models use automatically generated pseudo-labels, signiﬁcantly\
    \ reducing\nmanual labeling, one of the most time-consuming tasks in supervised\
    \ classiﬁcation [265].\nSelf-supervised image classiﬁcation is enhanced by machine\
    \ learning methods such as\nautoencoder and the generative adversarial network\
    \ (GAN). Autoencoder enhances im-\nage quality and reduces noise by dimension\
    \ reduction and retaining latent features [266].\nGAN is a promising technique\
    \ to further automate high-dimensional image classiﬁca-\ntion with limited data\
    \ training. GAN generates new data instances that resemble the\nexisting training\
    \ data by the competition between a generator and a discriminator [267].\nSeveral\
    \ examples show the advantages of incorporating GAN models in hydrological\nclassiﬁcation\
    \ [267–269] or combining it with autoencoder [270]. Integrating GAN with an\n\
    LSTM network model [271–273]; combining GAN with an ANN fuzzy model [274] was\
    \ also\nfound to improve the automated hydrological and weather prediction using\
    \ satellite data.\nWater 2022, 14, 2211\n27 of 38\n6.6. GeoAI-Based Multi-Dimensional\
    \ Geo-Visualization and Digital Twin\nHydrological systems are complex by nature\
    \ and have been challenged to compre-\nhensively and effectively convey spatial\
    \ and non-spatial hydrological information. The\nexplosion of high-dimensional,\
    \ multi-source, spatio-temporal hydrological data demands\nnew ways of multi-dimensional\
    \ geo-visualization [275]. The GeoAI model optimizes the\ntransformation of multi-dimensional\
    \ data into conventional 3D geo-visualization (x, y, and\nz features), but also\
    \ into 4D (including temporal dimension) and 5D geo-visualization\n(including\
    \ geographical scale). The 4D and 5D visualization is crucial for dynamic and\n\
    interactive web-based geo-visualization [276]. The GeoAI also supports building\
    \ hydrolog-\nical digital twins, integrating IoT sensors, and multi-scale satellite\
    \ and close-range remote\nsensing data, with web-based hydrological GeoAI models\
    \ for real-time prediction and\ngeo-visualization. A ‘digital twin’ is a comprehensive\
    \ digital emulator of the real-world\nsystem that aims to optimize the design\
    \ and operations of complex processes through a\nhighly interconnected workﬂow\
    \ [277]. Hydrological digital twins support the correct im-\nplementation of the\
    \ IWRM actions, including natural disaster response, nexus approaches,\nand adaptation\
    \ to climate change. Those actions require approaches underpinned by a\ndeeper\
    \ analysis of river basin systems functioning, scaling-up ﬁeld-based knowledge,\
    \ and\nnew digital solutions to provide real-time, high-resolution information\
    \ [278]. Addition-\nally, the advance in web-mapping services (WMS) and mobile\
    \ app development with\ninteractive geo-visualization [279] enhances hydrological\
    \ information dissemination for\ndecision-makers, stakeholders, and the general\
    \ public engagement.\n7. Conclusions\nGeoAI applications in integrated hydrological\
    \ and ﬂuvial system modeling have\nsteadily increased in recent years. We found\
    \ plenty of GeoAI applications in hydrological\nand ﬂuvial studies. The main applications\
    \ were for assessing GeoAI hydrological prediction\nand classiﬁcation performance,\
    \ comparing GeoAI methods with hydrological physical-\nbased models and integrating\
    \ physical-based models with GeoAI. A wide range of GeoAI\nmethods are currently\
    \ applied in this ﬁeld, e.g., RF, SVM, ANN, LSTM, GAN, GA, and meta-\nheuristic\
    \ algorithms. The selection of a particular algorithm depends on the application\n\
    objective, data availability, and user expertise.\nOverall, GeoAI applications\
    \ showed advantages in non-linear modeling, computa-\ntional efﬁciency, integration\
    \ of heterogeneous data sources, high-accuracy prediction, and\nthe unraveling\
    \ of new hydrological patterns or in detecting changes using high-dimensional,\n\
    multi-source geospatial data. GeoAI methods seem particularly relevant for complex\
    \ sys-\ntems and large geographical-scale modeling. A signiﬁcant disadvantage\
    \ of GeoAI models\nis the low level of physical interpretability, explainability,\
    \ and model generalization. There-\nfore, current research trends focus on integrating\
    \ the physical-based model with GeoAI\nmethods to bridge data-driven and theory-driven\
    \ knowledge generation. Several levels of\nmodel integrations exist, but a full\
    \ physical-based GeoAI model is still under development.\nThe GeoAI models have\
    \ shown high potential for autonomous hydrological prediction and\nforecasting\
    \ and early warning systems.\nAuthor Contributions: Conceptualization, C.G.-I.,\

    \ land degradation issue in agriculture. It is a\nmajor threat to agriculture\
    \ productivity. Extra irrigation water is applied to leach\ndown the salts from\
    \ the root zone of the plants in the form of a Leaching fraction\n(LF) of irrigation\
    \ water. For the leaching process to be effective, the LF of irriga-\ntion water\
    \ needs to be adjusted according to the environmental conditions and soil\nsalinity\
    \ level in the form of Evapotranspiration (ET) rate. The relationship\nbetween\
    \ environmental conditions and ET rate is hard to be deﬁned by a linear\nrelationship\
    \ and data-driven Machine learning (ML) based decisions are required\nto determine\
    \ the calibrated Evapotranspiration (ETc) rate. ML-assisted ETc is pro-\nposed\
    \ to adjust the LF according to the ETc and soil salinity level. A regression\n\
    model is proposed to determine the ETc rate according to the prevailing tempera-\n\
    ture, humidity, and sunshine, which would be used to determine the smart LF\n\
    according to the ETc and soil salinity level. The proposed model is trained and\n\

    Article\nTech\nScience Press\n1 Introduction\nSoil salinity is the accumulation\
    \ of salts in soil due to the natural material of soil or due to poor\nagronomic\
    \ practices [1]. This soil salinity is a serious threat to sustainable agriculture\
    \ development [2].\nTo deal with the issue of soil salinity, extra irrigation\
    \ water is applied to leach down the salts from the\nroot zone of the plants.\
    \ Leaching is the process of application of irrigation water to percolate down\
    \ the\nsalts from the root zone of the plants. LF is the ratio of irrigation water\
    \ required to leach down the salts\nto a speciﬁc level of soil salinity. The application\
    \ of irrigation water for leaching purposes without\ncalibration according to\
    \ environmental conditions usually fails to reduce soil salinity effectively [3].\n\
    To effectively achieve the objective of leaching, the irrigation water used for\
    \ leaching purposes must be\nadjusted to environmental conditions and salinity\
    \ levels. To adjust the LF according to the environmental\nconditions the LF is\
    \ adjusted with the Evapotranspiration (ET) rate. ET rate is the measure of water\
    \ loss\nfrom the soil and plant surface in the form of evaporation and transpiration,\
    \ collectively called ET [4].\nReference Evapotranspiration (ETo) is used to model\
    \ the ET rate of a model crop. ETo is the standard ET\nof the grass crop [5].\
    \ The ET of the model crop (grass) is called Reference ETo. The ETo rate is heavily\n\
    affected by the temperature, humidity, wind speed, and sunshine duration. The\
    \ ET rate increases with\ntemperature and decreases with an increase in humidity\
    \ [6].\nET is affected by environmental conditions with a severe impact on LF\
    \ to be available for an effective\nleaching process. Irrigation must be adjusted\
    \ with the ET rate to ensure the LF of irrigation water is available\nunder prevailing\
    \ environmental conditions. Many methods of ETo rate determination are recommended.\n\
    Most important are Blaney Criddle, Penman Montieth method, and Pan Evaporation\
    \ method [7].\nThese methods required a lot of parameters that make them difﬁcult\
    \ to apply at the farmer level. LF of\nirrigation water applications without adjustment\
    \ to the prevailing conditions usually fails to achieve the\nobjective of leaching\
    \ in saline soils. Leaching is applied without any calibration according to the\
    \ salinity\nlevel and environmental conditions. Leaching irrigation water needs\
    \ to be calibrated according to the\nenvironmental context, to successfully reduce\
    \ the soil salinity by the leaching process. The failure in the\nleaching process\
    \ results in loss to the farmers. LF is the fraction of total irrigation water\
    \ required to\nreduce soil salinity from a certain salinity level to the desired\
    \ salinity level.\nMachine learning has revolutionized the world by transforming\
    \ all spheres of life including healthcare,\nagriculture, transport, entertainment,\
    \ and business. ML is also applied in agriculture to deal with different\nproblems\
    \ in agriculture. Many ML-based solutions were proposed to determine the ET rate\
    \ from limited\nenvironmental conditions. Determination of LF from ML-based ETo\
    \ rate is not previously targeted. To\ndetermine the LF from limited environmental\
    \ conditions the ML model is proposed to determine the\ncalibrated Evapotranspiration\
    \ (ETc) from the prevailing temperature, humidity, and sunshine duration. To\n\
    train and validate the Model the Blaney Criddle Method of ET rate determination\
    \ is used. Many smart\nirrigation water solutions were proposed in recent years\
    \ for the conservation of irrigation water. Most of\nthe proposed solutions were\
    \ limited to sensing soil moisture conditions and recommendations for the\nirrigation\
    \ water accordingly. Very few smart irrigation water solutions follow Food and\
    \ agriculture\norganization (FAO) recommended method of ET for the determination\
    \ of irrigation water requirements [8].\n1.1 Signiﬁcance of Study\nSoil salinity\
    \ has a profound impact on the socio-economic life of people. Soil salinity has\
    \ seriously\naffected more than 831 million hectares of land, across the world\
    \ [9]. Soil is a non-renewable resource\nthat is very important to feed the ever-increasing\
    \ population. Every sphere of knowledge should focus to\nreclaim the saline soil.\
    \ Soil salinity is a signiﬁcant environmental hazard that affects crop yield and\n\
    production. Soil Salinity is the primary source of reduction in crop yield and\
    \ source of barren soil [10]. A\nhigh concentration of salt affects the plant’s\
    \ ability to uptake the water [11].\n1916\nIASC, 2023, vol.36, no.2\nDue to progressive\
    \ human-induced salinization, the soil at an alarming rate has become unsuitable\
    \ for\nagricultural and infrastructure developments [12]. Poor agriculture practices\
    \ are the primary reason for\nhuman-induced soil salinity. Salinity is a severe\
    \ problem in irrigated areas and results in considerable loss\nto the value of\
    \ production [13]. Soil salinity is an issue in more than seventy countries. Soil\
    \ salinity cause\n1%–2% of land degradation per year. Around 20% of irrigated\
    \ land is affected by soil salinity [14].\nSoil salinity is the major problem\
    \ in arid regions that causes severe economic losses to the farmers. The\nsoil\
    \ salinity is very toxic to plants. Most of the plants cannot survive in saline\
    \ culture. The salts uptake by\nthe plants interferes with the normal physiology\
    \ of the plants. The toxicity of salinity results in the death of\nthe plants\
    \ which causes severe loss to the farmers. To feed the ever-increasing human population.\
    \ Every\nsphere of knowledge must contribute to dealing with issues. The proposed\
    \ solution intends to improve\nthe effectiveness of the leaching process to reduce\
    \ soil salinity. The reclamation of saline soils for\nagriculture purposes by\
    \ effective leaching would save the most precious resource.\n1.2 Contribution\n\
    The major contribution of the work is the determination of the LF of irrigation\
    \ water to deal with the\nissue of soil salinity efﬁciently and effectively. The\
    \ proposed solution optimizes the use of irrigation\nwater for leaching purposes\
    \ according to environmental conditions (temperature, humidity, wind speed)\n\
    that were not previously targeted. The relationship between environmental conditions\
    \ and ET is diverse.\nSome conditions tend to increase the ET, and some decrease\
    \ the ET rate. The combined effect of all the\nenvironmental conditions is hard\
    \ to determine from the linear model. Therefore, ML-assisted ETo rate is\ndetermined\
    \ to optimize the LF according to the environmental conditions. LF determination\
    \ from limited\nenvironmental conditions aims to support sustainable developments\
    \ in agriculture.\n1.3 Data-Driven Machine Learning Model\nA data-driven machine\
    \ learning model is applied to make decisions for the smart LF of irrigation water.\n\
    The proposed solution is ideal for dealing with the issue of soil salinity while\
    \ conservation of irrigation water,\nto support sustainable developments in agriculture.\
    \ The proposed solution aims to effectively deal with the\nissue of soil salinity\
    \ by smart leaching of irrigation water. Smart leaching fraction of irrigation\
    \ water\napplication according to the prevailing, temperature, humidity, wind\
    \ speed, and sunshine duration can\neffectively deal with the issue of soil salinity\
    \ in irrigated areas.\n2 Literature Review\nThe literature review is performed\
    \ to ﬁnd relevant work, from major bibliographic indices. Many\nsolutions regarding\
    \ smart irrigation have emerged in recent years. Hellin et al. presented an automated\n\

    \ monitoring [38]. Rajalakshmi et al.\nproposed IoT crop ﬁeld monitoring for the\
    \ irrigation water recommendation. Talavera et al. [39] explored\nthe IoT application\
    \ in agriculture. Naqvi et al. recommended IoT-based irrigation management\napplications\
    \ to conserve irrigation water [40]. The study in [41] proposed leaching estimation\
    \ in saline\nsoil with temperature conditions of an area. Wang et al. [42] evaluate\
    \ the remote sensing, machine\nlearning and Land surface model (LSM) based approaches\
    \ where results indicate that ensemble means of\nglobal terrestrial ET rates are\
    \ similar in all the approaches.\nNiaghi et al. [43] proposed ML-based ETo, estimation\
    \ in humid conditions due to the non-linear\ncharacteristics of the ETo determination.\
    \ The ML models [44] are compared in terms of RMSE, MAE,\nScattered index (SI),\
    \ and Co-relation coefﬁcient. It is observed that the RF model is more accurate\
    \ in ETo\nestimation with radiation as input. Faramiñan et al. [45] proposed daily\
    \ actual Evapotranspiration (ETa) of\nbarley crops by the development of the linear\
    \ generalized model, developed from meteorological conditions.\nLópez et al. [46]\
    \ proposed ETo estimation with soil moisture conditions using the regression model.\
    \ The\nproposed solution determines the crop potential Evapotranspiration (ETc)\
    \ of Kikuyu grass. The Eto by\nproposed solution is compared against the Penman\
    \ Montieth method. The model achieved a coefﬁcient of\ndetermination of 0.9936,\
    \ with RMSE 0.183 mm day−1. Allen et al. [47] recommended weather data\nconditioning\
    \ to deal with the problem of overstated ETo to adjust biases in ordinary conditions,\
    \ especially\nin arid conditions.\nMartínez et al. [48] evaluated the performance\
    \ of Remote sensing (RS) based ETo estimation at low\naltitudes. The study evaluated\
    \ the performance of MODIS ET (MOD16), Global land evaporation\namsterdam model\
    \ (GLEAM) ET, and Atmosphere-land exchange inverse (ALEXI) ET. Petkovic et al.\n\
    [49] recommended a regression model of ETo determination from several weather\
    \ conditions. Wang et al.\n[50] proposed radiation-based ETo estimation from RS\
    \ data considering the complex terrain. The\nimplementation of the proposed result\
    \ yields that R2 is 0.84 and 0.86 at two different locations with\n0.59 and 0.82\
    \ RMSE respectively.\nMa et al., [51] suggested an ET estimation framework from\
    \ high-resolution RS data from\nSentinel-2 satellite data. The coefﬁcient of determination\
    \ of the proposed solution is from 0.870 to\n0.912 mm day−1. The coefﬁcient of\
    \ determination of the proposed solution is from 0.870 to 0.912 mm day−1.\nMany\
    \ ML-assisted solutions were proposed to determine the ETc rate from prevailing\
    \ environmental\nconditions. Recommendation of LF based on ET rate from limited\
    \ environmental conditions is not\npreviously targeted. The proposed solution\
    \ would support sustainable developments in agriculture with\nthe reclamation\
    \ of saline soils with an effective leaching process with the conservation of\
    \ irrigation water.\n1918\nIASC, 2023, vol.36, no.2\n3 Materials and Methods\n\
    The smart LF of irrigation adjusts the ET rate with environmental conditions using\
    \ the ML approach.\nInitially, the ETc rate was based on temperature, humidity,\
    \ and sunshine duration. LF of Irrigation water\nis determined using the ET rate\
    \ and salinity level of the soil and irrigation water of the crop ﬁeld. LF is\n\
    used to determine the fraction of total irrigation water that is required to reduce\
    \ salinity up to the target\nlevel of soil salinity. LF and ETc are used to determine\
    \ the irrigation water requirements according to the\ntemperature, humidity, wind\
    \ speed, sunshine duration, and prevailing salinity conditions.\n3.1 Flow Chart\
    \ of Proposed Method\nThe proposed solution determines the ETo from the temperature\
    \ and day length of an area using the\nBlaney Criddle method of ET. Blaney Criddle\
    \ is a theoretical measure of ET rate and ignores the impact\nof humidity, sunshine,\
    \ and wind speed. ML model is used to determine calibrated ETc rate according\
    \ to\nhumidity, sunshine, and wind speed. ETc and LF are used to determine the\
    \ total irrigation Water\nrequirements (WR).\n3.1.1 Blaney Criddle Method of Reference\
    \ Evapotranspiration (Et0)\nETo is the ET rate of reference crop in millimeters\
    \ in one day (mm day−1). It is obtained by using the\nBlaney-Criddle method, by\
    \ Eq. (1), where ‘Tmean’ is the mean monthly temperature, and ‘p’ is the daily\n\
    percentage of daytime in hours.\nETo ¼ p 0:46 \x02 Tmean þ 8\nð\nÞ\n(1)\nThe daytime\
    \ length has a signiﬁcant impact on irrigation requirements and ET rate. The experiment\
    \ area\nis situated at the latitude of 30° N. Value of daytime length ‘p’ is taken\
    \ from the mean daytime percentage\nhours based on latitude and month. Table 1,\
    \ shows the “p” value of the experiment area (Vehari, Pakistan) for\nJanuary to\
    \ June.\nTmean is the mean monthly temperature obtained by mean monthly maximum\
    \ temperature (Tmax) and\nmeans monthly minimum temperature (Tmin) by Eq. (2).\n\
    Tmean ¼ Tmax þ Tmin\nð\nÞ\n2\n(2)\nTmax is obtained by Eq. (3), where ‘n’ is the\
    \ maximum number of days in a month, and Tx is the\nmaximum daily temperature.\n\

    Tmin is obtained by Eq. (4), where ‘n’ is the number of days and Tn is the minimum\
    \ daily temperature.\nAll these temperature measurements are made on a degree\
    \ centigrade scale (°C).\nTable 1: Mean daytime percentage hours at 30° north\n\

    \ to ET0. Average monthly sunshine, humidity, and wind speed lean towards ETc.\
    \ Finally,\nthe crop tolerance level, irrigation water salinity, and soil salinity\
    \ measure the leaching fraction. Then this\nwhole process calculates the total\
    \ requirement of water before the end.\nFigure 1: Flow chart of the proposed solution\n\
    3.1.2 Leaching Fraction (LF)\nThe LF is the fraction of irrigation water required\
    \ to control salinity within the crop tolerance level. LF of\nirrigation water\
    \ is determined according to the soil salinity, irrigation water salinity, and\
    \ crop tolerance The\nLF is expressed by Eq. (1), where ‘ECw’ is the irrigation\
    \ water salinity level in dSm−1, and ‘ECe’ is the\nsalinity tolerance level of\
    \ the crop. ‘ECe for the grass crop at one-hundredth percent (100%) of yield\n\
    potential is 8.7.\nLF for the grass crop with a tolerance level of 8.7 dSm−1 is\
    \ determined by the FAO recommended\nmethod by Eq. (5).\nLF ¼ ECw= 5 ECe\nð\n\
    Þ \x03 ECw\nð\nÞ\n(5)\nThe Water requirements in the experiment area (WRe) are\
    \ calculated by Eq. (6), where ETc is the\ncalibrated Evapotranspiration (ETc)\
    \ and LF is determined by Eq. (5).\nWRe ¼ ETc= 1 \x03 LF\nð\nÞ\n(6)\n1920\nIASC,\
    \ 2023, vol.36, no.2\nFor comparison purposes, the Water requirements in the control\
    \ area (WRc) are obtained by using the\nET0 from the Blaney Criddle method by\
    \ Eq. (7). The WRc is applied in the control area and WRe is applied\nin the experiment\
    \ area to observe the effectiveness of both solutions.\nWRc ¼ ETo= 1 \x03 LF\n\
    ð\nÞ\n(7)\nThe theoretical ET0 by Blaney Criddle method ignores the impact of\
    \ humidity, wind speed, and sunshine\nduration on ET rate. ML-assisted smart ETc\
    \ rate is determined according to the prevailing humidity level,\nwind speed,\
    \ and sunshine duration. The objective of the ML model is to effectively adjust\
    \ the ET0\naccording to humidity, wind speed, and sunshine duration ratio.\nThe\
    \ dataset for the ML is obtained by conditions shown in Fig. 2 and by the Blaney\
    \ Criddle method. Each\nline shows the ETc according to the humidity, wind speed,\
    \ and sunshine. The ETc is calibrated according to\nthese conditions. The ideal\
    \ outcome of the model would be the minimum amount of irrigation water that\n\
    serves the irrigation water requirements for LF to be successfully available.\
    \ The success matric in this\nregard would be the smart calibrated irrigation\
    \ water according to the environmental conditions.\nFigure 2: Machine learning\
    \ data set [6]\nIASC, 2023, vol.36, no.2\n1921\nThe model is deemed to be a failure\
    \ if the recommended irrigation water fails to achieve the objective of\nleaching.\
    \ The input to the model would be the ETo, humidity, wind speed, and sunshine\
    \ duration. Fig. 2,\nshows the environmental data for ML training.\nThe ML model\
    \ is developed using multiple regression. The regression model is used due to\
    \ the existence\nof the linear relationship between environmental conditions,\
    \ ETc. The training of the model is done with\nmore than one hundred thousand\
    \ records. Eighty percent (80%) of the data set is used for the training of\n\
    the model and twenty percent (20%) for the test data set.\nThe objective of the\
    \ model is to directly predict the ETc from the direct values of humidity, wind\
    \ speed,\nand sunshine duration. Fig. 3, shows the distribution of the data of\
    \ ETc in the test data set.\n3.1.3 Machine Learning (ML) Model\n4 Results and\
    \ Discussion\nThis section intends to evaluate the proposed method of smart LF\
    \ of irrigation water with different\nprospects. Initially, the performance of\
    \ the ML model is made with different types of evaluations. The\nperformance of\
    \ smart LF of Irrigation water is compared against the traditional method of LF\
    \ of\nIrrigation water.\n4.1 Performance of Machine Learning Model\nThe proposed\
    \ ML model predicts the ETc from the humidity, wind speed, and sunshine as the\
    \ input to the\nmodel. The performance of the model is observed in terms of the\
    \ accuracy of the model to determine the\ncalibrated ETc. The ETc predicted by\
    \ the proposed solution is compared against the Blaney Criddle of ET\nFigure 3:\

    \ and actual ET values from\nthe test data set is shown in Fig. 4.\nFor the different\
    \ levels of ETo, the difference in calibrated ET (ETc) is shown in Fig. 4. For\
    \ each case, the\ndifference is very low. The maximum difference is 2 mm day−1\
    \ and the minimum difference is 0.2 mm day−1\nfor all observed ETc values. For\
    \ most of the observed values, the difference is less than 1 mm day−1. The\ndifference\
    \ in calibrated ET (ETc) is low against each set of ETo.\nThe performance of the\
    \ ML model is observed in terms of mean absolute errors (MAE), Mean squared\n\
    errors (MSE), and Root means squared errors (RMSE). The MSE is the average of\
    \ the Squared Errors. MSE\nis the average of the square of the difference between\
    \ the predicted values and actual values. MSE is\nexpressed by Eq. (8), where\

    statistics show that the ML model is accurate in the prediction of ETc against\
    \ the prevailing\nenvironmental conditions. The proposed model can be used with\
    \ accuracy and conﬁdence in the\nestimation of irrigation water requirements from\
    \ the LF, ETc.\n4.2 Field Effectiveness of Smart Leaching\nThe effectiveness of\
    \ the proposed smart LF of irrigation water is also observed by the application\
    \ of the\nproposed solution in a real-time environment. The effectiveness of the\
    \ proposed solution is compared to the\ntraditional leaching process. To implement\
    \ and compare the performance of both leaching processes is\napplied in two adjacent\
    \ areas with similar soil salinity levels. In the experiment area, the leaching\
    \ process\nis applied according to the proposed solution while in the control\
    \ area the leaching process is applied by\nthe traditional process. In both areas,\
    \ the salinity level is observed before and after leaching water application.\n\
    The salinity is observed before and after the application of leaching irrigation\
    \ water in both areas. In both\nareas, salinity is observed at sixty-four sampling\
    \ points for soil salinity in terms of electric conductivity (EC).\nThe impacts\
    \ of leaching by the smart and traditional methods are analyzed in terms of average\
    \ soil salinity\nECav. The average soil salinity (ECav) is determined by Eq. (11),\
    \ where ‘n = 64’ is the total number of sample\npoints, ‘i’ is the sample point\
    \ number, and ‘EC’ is the EC value at the sampling point. The targeting tolerance\n\
    level is set for the cotton crop that is 8.7 dSm−1 or below.\nECav ¼\nXn\ni¼1\

    \ salinity is observed in both the control and experiment areas before the application\
    \ of\nirrigation water for leaching purposes.\nIn Fig. 5, the salinity distribution\
    \ of both experiment and control areas is plotted before the application of\n\
    irrigation water for leaching purposes. Before the leaching process, the ECav\
    \ in the control area was\n12.67 dSm−1, and in the experiment, the area was 12.93\
    \ dSm−1. In both areas, salinity at all the sixty-four\n(64) sample points was\
    \ higher than the tolerance level of the selected crop which is 8.7 dSm−1. Both\n\
    areas have similar ECav, and at all the sample points the salinity is above the\
    \ tolerance level of the crop\nas given in Table 3.\n4.2.2 Salinity Distribution\
    \ After Leaching\nThe WRe are determined based on ETc and LF. The smart calibrations\
    \ in ETc are made based on crop\nﬁeld environment conditions. The WRe is determined\
    \ by predicted ETc of 5.3 mm day−1. With irrigation\nwater salinity of 5 dSm−1\
    \ and a targeted level of soil salinity of 8.7 dSm−1, the required LF is\nTable\

    \ With ETc of 5.3 mm day−1, the total requirements of irrigation water would be\n\
    6.23 mm day−1, with LF of 0.13. While in the control area the WRc, is applied\
    \ with the traditional\nmethod by applying Eq. (7).\nSoil salinity distribution\
    \ is compared in both the control and experiment area after leaching application.\n\
    Salinity distribution after the application of WRe and WRc in the control and\
    \ experiment area is shown in\nFig. 5. Salinity distribution in the experiment\
    \ and control area is given in Table 4.\nFigure 5: Soil salinity distribution\

    \ ECav is 7.07 dSm−1, and in the control, the area is 8.7 dSm−1. In the control\n\
    area at thirty-ﬁve (35) sample points, soil salinity is more than the targeted\
    \ level of soil salinity. In the\nexperiment area at fourteen (14) sample points,\
    \ the salinity is more than the targeted level (8.7) dSm−1 of\nsoil salinity.\
    \ The proposed smart leaching is more effective in reducing the ECav and at a\
    \ greater number\nof sample points as compared to the traditional approach applied\
    \ in the control area.\n4.3 Discussion\nThe effectiveness of the proposed solution\
    \ is observed in terms of the accuracy of the ML model and the\neffectiveness\
    \ of the proposed solution in the reduction of soil salinity. The ML model is\
    \ accurate in the\nprediction of calibrated ETc with lower MAE, RMSE, and MSE.\
    \ Salinity is observed in the control and\nexperiment areas before and after the\
    \ application of leaching by the proposed solution and by the\ntraditional method\
    \ in the experiment and control areas respectively. Salinity distributions before\
    \ and after\nleaching irrigation water applications in control and experiment\
    \ areas are shown in Fig. 6, and the results\nare summarized in Table 5.\nFigure\
    \ 6: Salinity comparisons\n1926\nIASC, 2023, vol.36, no.2\nECav in the control\
    \ area is reduced from 12.78 to 8.7 dSm−1, after the application of leaching by\
    \ the\ntraditional method. In the experiment area, ECav is reduced from 12.93\
    \ to 7.07 dSm−1, with the\napplication of smart LF of irrigation water. Smart\
    \ leaching is more effective in the experiment area as\ncompared to the traditional\
    \ leaching process applied in the control area. The number of sample points\n\
    with salinity level, more than the targeted level of soil salinity, was reduced\
    \ from sixty-four (64) to thirty-\nﬁve (35), in the control area, and from sixty-four\
    \ (64) to fourteen (14) sample points in the experiment\narea. The smart LF application\
    \ in the experiment area is more successful in reducing salinity as compared\n\
    to the traditional method in the control area.\nThe performance of smart LF against\
    \ the traditional methods in terms of average salinity, and the\nnumber of points\
    \ above the target level reveals the success of smart LF of irrigation water against\
    \ the\ntraditional method. The smart LF of irrigation water is more effective\
    \ in reducing the soil salinity as\ncompared to the traditional leaching process.\
    \ The proposed solution adjusts the irrigation water according\nto the prevailing\
    \ temperature, humidity, and sunshine duration to recommend LF irrigation water\
    \ that is\nmore effective in reducing the soil salinity as compared to the traditional\
    \ leaching process. Fig. 6 shows\nthe distribution of the soil salinity in the\
    \ experiment and control area before and after the application of\nthe leaching\
    \ process. From Fig. 6 it is observed that the proposed solution is more effective\
    \ in reducing\nthe soil salinity at more points as compared to the traditional\
    \ leaching process.\n5 Conclusion\nSoil salinity is a soil degradation process\
    \ that is a serious hazard to sustainable development in\nagriculture. Application\
    \ of smart leaching by calibrated Evapotranspiration (ETc) is proposed for the\n\
    Leaching Fraction (LF) of irrigation water to be more effective. Smart LF of irrigation\
    \ water is proposed\nand implemented in a real-time environment. The ML model\
    \ is proposed to adjust in Evapotranspiration\nrate according to humidity, sunshine,\
    \ and wind speed to determine the ETc rate. The proposed ML model\nis accurate\
    \ to predict the ETc to determine the smart LF of irrigation water. The LF of\
    \ irrigation water is\ndetermined according to ETc, soil salinity level, irrigation\
    \ water salinity level, and crop tolerance level.\nThe ﬁeld evaluation of the\
    \ proposed solution of the smart LF reveals that the proposed solution is more\n\
    effective in reducing the soil salinity in terms of average soil salinity and\
    \ at a greater number of points.\nFor future work, the proposed solution needs\
    \ to be tested against different ML algorithms for a more\naccurate prediction\
    \ of ETc. The proposed solution is based on the Blaney Criddle method of ETo rate\n\
    determination. It needs to be tested against the Penman Montieth method and Pan\
    \ Evaporation-based ETo\ndetermination.\nAcknowledgement: The authors, therefore,\

    2022, 2022010445. https://doi.org/10.20944/preprints202201.0445.v1 Abstract Internet
    of Things (IoT) technologies can greatly benefit from machine learning techniques
    and Artificial Neural Networks for data mining and vice versa. In the agricultural
    field, this convergence could result in the development of smart farming systems
    suitable for use as decision support systems by peasant farmers. This work presents
    the design of a smart farming system for crop production, which is based on low-cost
    IoT sensors and popular data storage services and data analytics services on the
    Cloud. Moreover, a new data mining method exploiting climate data along with crop
    production data is proposed for the prediction of production volume from heterogeneous
    data sources. This method was initially validated using traditional machine learning
    techniques and open historical data of the northeast region of the state of Puebla,
    Mexico, which were collected from data sources from the National Water Commission
    and the Agri-food Information Service of the Mexican Government. Keywords data

    Communications and Sensing for 6G and Beyond: A Comprehensive Review Wei Jiang
    and 14 more April 04, 2024 Next-generation cellular technologies, commonly referred
    to as the sixth generation (6G), are envisioned to support a higher system capacity,
    better performance, and network sensing capabilities. The terahertz (THz) band
    is one potential enabler to this end due to the large unused frequency bands and
    the high spatial resolution enabled by the short signal wavelength and large bandwidth.
    Different from earlier surveys, this paper presents a comprehensive treatment
    and technology survey on THz communications and sensing in terms of advantages,
    Rapid Feasibility Assessment of Energy Unit Integration in Distribution Networks
    Sicheng Gong and 2 more April 03, 2024 In contemporary heavy-load distribution
    networks, preceding feasibility assessment is imperative before incorporating
    additional energy units. However, the feasibility examination for massive combined
    operational scenarios of relevant units is computationally intensive with repetitive
    power flow calculations. To this end, this paper proposes a rapid assessment framework,
    the kernel of which is to learn from formerly examined scenarios, thus forming
    expansive feasible/infeasible regions to geometrically rule in/out subsequent
    scenarios. Without running the power flow computation in most scenarios, we accelerate
    the assessment process. Moreover, enlightened by heuristic hypersurface search,
    such prechecking efficiency can be further boosted. In a risk-averse manner, this
    framework can be conceptualized using the exact grid model. Especially, evidenced
    by testing on a 10.5kV distribution grid, the framework shows a significant assessment
    efficiency improvement and strict accuracy guarantee, where we observe at least
    76.13% assessment time reduction and zero accuracy loss in all testing cases.
    We anticipate this work to be a starting point for more sophisticated geometry-accelerating
    feasibility assessment methods. Improving Molecular De Novo Drug Design with Transformers
    Dhaval Soni and 7 more April 03, 2024 Drug design is undergoing a transformation
    as we challenge conventional methods by integrating state-of-the-art artificial
    intelligence with the intricate domain of molecular biology. At the heart of our
    endeavor lies a significant challenge: the scarcity of datasets containing active
    compounds for emerging target proteins. To confront this obstacle, we''re pioneering
    an innovative approach. We''re merging the advanced Generative Pre-trained Transformer
    (GPT) architecture with the nuanced capabilities of Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)
    networks, with the aim of generating Simplified Molecular Input Line Entry System
    (SMILES) strings to unveil novel therapeutic pathways. Additionally, we''re employing
    a Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT) pretraining strategy
    to enrich our model with comprehensive molecular data, including amino acid sequences
    and molecular SMILES datasets. Through meticulous fine-tuning on a meticulously
    curated protein-ligand complex dataset, we''re achieving precise conditional generation
    via autoregressive supervised learning. Our research introduces a groundbreaking
    method to assess molecular affinity, validated against established proteins, showcasing
    superior binding affinities compared to certain FDA-approved drugs in docking
    experiments. By pushing the boundaries of generative algorithms and establishing
    a robust framework for evaluating molecular affinity, we''re driving forward the
    field of de novo drug design, offering promising therapeutic avenues and enabling
    deeper exploration of the chemical landscape. Formalising a Gateway-based Blockchain
    Interoperability Solution with Event-B Guzmán Llambías and 2 more April 03, 2024
    A document by Guzman Llambias . Click on the document to view its contents. Magnetic
    Behavior of NO Fe-Si Sheets under Tensile and Compressive Stress Carlo Appino
    and 6 more April 03, 2024 The stress dependence of the magnetic properties of
    non-oriented Fe-Si steel sheets has been investigated by measurement and analysis
    of hysteresis loop, magnetization curve, and energy losses taken at different
    peak polarization values Jp (0.5 T – 1.5 T) between DC and f = 400 Hz. The salient
    feature of the material response to the stress lies in the monotonic deterioration
    of the soft magnetic properties, across the whole (Jp - f) domain, on passing
    from the maximum tensile stress (σ = +30 MPa) to the maximum compression (σ =
    -30 MPa). This is understood in terms of stress-induced redistribution of the
    domains between easy axes, making magnetic hardening by compression directly related
    to unfavorably directed domains and 90° domain-wallmediated magnetization transitions.
    The loss decomposition is carried out across the whole investigated frequency
    range, taking into account the skin effect at the highest frequencies. Quasi-static
    and dynamic losses follow a same trend with σ, both monotonically increasing on
    passing from the tensile to the compressive stress limits, according to the theoretically
    expected relationship existing between the hysteresis and the excess loss components.
    The latter is shown to identify the correlation regions where the magnetization
    is reversed of size comparable with the average grain size and loosely following
    the dependence of the loss figure on the applied stress. A bio-inspired hardware
    implementation of an analog spike-based hippocampus memory mo... Daniel Casanueva-Morato
    and 4 more April 03, 2024 The need for processing at the edge the increasing amount
    of data that is being produced by multitudes of sensors has led to the demand
    for mode power efficient computational systems, by exploring alternative computing
    paradigms and technologies. Neuromorphic engineering is a promising approach that
    can address this need by developing electronic systems that faithfully emulate
    the computational properties of animal brains. In particular, the hippocampus
    stands out as one of the most relevant brain region for implementing auto associative
    memories capable of learning large amounts of information quickly and recalling
    it efficiently. In this work, we present a computational spike-based memory model
    inspired by the hippocampus that takes advantage of the features of analog electronic
    circuits: energy efficiency, compactness, and real-time operation. This model
    can learn memories, recall them from a partial fragment and forget. It has been
    implemented as a Spiking Neural Networks directly on a mixed-signal neuromorphic
    chip. We describe the details of the hardware implementation and demonstrate its
    operation via a series of benchmark experiments, showing how this research prototype
    paves the way for the development of future robust and low-power mixed-signal
    neuromorphic processing systems. Exploratory Study of oneM2M-based Interoperability
    Architectures for IoT: A Smart Cit... VJS Pranavasri and 6 more April 03, 2024
    The advent of the Internet of Things (IoT) has ushered in transformative possibilities
    for smart cities, with the potential to revolutionize urban living through enhanced
    connectivity and data-driven decision-making. However, the effective realization
    of IoT in smart cities hinges upon the seamless interoperability of diverse devices
    and systems. To address this critical need, the oneM2M standards initiative has
    emerged as a foundational framework for IoT interoperability. In this research
    paper, we perform an exploratory analysis of three prominent open-source oneM2M
    based interoperability systems-Mobius, OM2M, and ACME. We leverage an existing
    large-scale system provided by our Smart City Living Lab deployed at IIIT Hyderabad,
    sprawling a 66-acre campus featuring over 370 nodes across eight verticals. We
    investigate the architectural characteristics of each solution, considering their
    strengths and limitations in facilitating IoT interoperability. Through this analysis,
    our paper aims to provide valuable insights for stakeholders seeking to implement
    IoT interoperability solutions in the context of smart cities. By evaluating the
    strengths and limitations of Mobius, OM2M, and ACME, we seek to offer guidance
    for selecting the most suitable solution. Our analysis reveals that the optimal
    framework choice depends on specific quality constraints: Mobius excels in performance,
    while ACME offers advantages in ease of setup for smaller-scale implementations.
    Comparing Concepts of Service Blocking Queues in Hardware-in-the-Loop Systems
    Tobias Konheiser and 3 more April 03, 2024 ZF is developing an autonomous driving
    system, which requires extensive testing of the developed devices and software
    on hardware-in-the-loop (HIL) systems. Therefore, a robust and high-performing
    HIL system is essential. The purpose of a HIL system is to replay recorded data
    to the device-undertest. Recordings are loaded, processed and streamed to the
    deviceunder-test with real-time requirements. This streaming chain includes processing
    nodes and queues. This requires careful management of queue configurations. An
    overflow in the queue will result in packet loss, while an underflow may violate
    the real-time constraint. This study aims to develop and evaluate concepts for
    service blocking queues. These concepts block or pause the incoming service to
    a queue when necessary to avoid queue overflows and associated data loss. However,
    an out-of-the-box solution is not available and different approaches affect the
    behaviour and performance of the system. Therefore, the developed concepts are
    evaluated against each other and against the existing system based on selected
    performance parameters in specific scenarios. The scenarios cover a wide range
    of situations, reflecting standard input data with varying numbers of parallel
    streams and bottleneck scenarios forcing queue overflows or blockages. The developed
    service blocking queue concepts eliminate data loss in all scenarios, but introduce
    overhead, resulting in reduced system performance. However, the service blocking
    queue concept using a modified token-bucket approach proved to be the best solution,
    as the elimination of data loss justifies the additional overhead. This concept
    is proposed for implementation and deployment on the HIL system. Generative AI-Based
    Text Generation Methods Using Pre-Trained GPT 2 Model Rohit Pandey and 7 more
    April 03, 2024 A text generation model is a machine learning model that uses neural
    networks, especially transformers architecture to generate contextually relevant
    text based on linguistic patterns learned from extensive corpora. The models are
    trained on a huge amount of textual data so that they can model and learn complex
    concepts of any language like its grammar, vocabulary, phrases, and styles. FlowDep
    - An efficient and optical-flow-based algorithm of obstacle detection for aut...
    Chen-Fu Yeh and 7 more April 03, 2024 Obstacle detection is crucial for the safety
    and efficiency of autonomous vehicles. For mini-vehicles such as palm-sized drones,
    it is a challenge to implement traditional methods like Lidar due to high costs
    and physical constraints. Vision-based deep learning approaches, while accurate,
    are too resource-intensive for the mini-vehicles. To address this issue, we introduce
    Flowdep, a novel optical-flow-based algorithm inspired by the low-resolution but
    efficient motion-detection mechanisms in insects. Flowdep combines optic flow
    and IMU (or positioning information) to estimate the depth of every image pixel.
    We also generate a variant of Flowdep using the artificial neural network (Flowdep-ANN).
    Our tests show that Flowdep and Flowdep-ANN are 5.8 to 114.7 times faster than
    the DNN networks we tested, while the accuracies of Flowdep and Flowdep-ANN are
    on par with these networks. We further tested Flowdep and Flowdep-ANN on a small
    autonomous vehicle with Raspberry Pi4 as the computing platform, and both models
    successfully performed real-time object detection. The present work demonstrates
    the potential of using optical flow as an efficient approach to estimate depth
    and detect obstacles in resource-constrained mini-vehicles. Misinformative Data
    Visualizations in the Sports Media Domain Drew Scott April 03, 2024 Sports are
    data-driven: individual performances are measured using statistics and teams leverage
    data analytics to outperform competition. Sports media-which is created by media
    outlets, teams, and individuals-engage its consumers by creating narratives about
    the sport, teams, and players. Due to the importance of data in the sports world,
    data visualizations are a pillar in the sports media landscape. These data visualizations,
    while appearing to accurately convey data to its consumers, can be misinformative;
    media creators often have incentives to present specific narratives which don''t
    always fit the data. This work contributes to an existing misinformative data
    visualization taxonomy. In doing so, it makes it easier to understand the techniques
    and design choices used to create misinformative visualizations in all domains,
    not only in sports media. A Survey of RFID Authentication Protocols Drew Scott
    April 03, 2024 "Radio frequency identification" (RFID) systems are ubiquitous
    in today''s world. In an RFID system, it is a desirable to attain mutual authentication
    between a reader and a tag before commencing application-level communications.
    This is because tags should not share secret information with unknown parties
    and readers need to defend against tag impersonation. Authentication protocols
    designed for communication between computers, however, are not appropriate for
    RFID systems because tags are extremely resource constrained (low energy, small
    memory, etc.). Thus, there have been many attempts to design secure and practical
    authentication protocols for RFID systems over the years since RFID systems became
    prevalent. This survey summarizes and compares these protocols. The Effect of
    Multipath in Distributed Arrays with Time Reversal Hassna Ouassal and 2 more April
    03, 2024 This article examines the effect of multipath channels on the performance
    of distributed arrays that employ time reversal. A model of the signal received
    from a distributed array is formulated, and a statistical analysis of the variation
    in signal power in the presence of phase noise and multipath is given. We present
    the impact these nonidealities have on received signal power, and we analyze the
    received power for three specific cases: continuous waveform, impulse waveform,
    and modulated rectangular pulse waveform in the presence of standard channel models.
    It is shown that for larger arrays in multipath channels, the change in power
    between coherent and incoherent states converges to the line-of-sight channel.
    It is further shown that in a line-of-sight channel time-reversal completely cancels
    unknown channel delays resulting in coherent signals from all nodes in a distributed
    array, while in a multipath channel only the main diagonal round-trip paths are
    coherent. Nevertheless, this additional benefit improves signal coherence in complex
    channels and can aide in distributed array synchronization using two-way time
    transfer. Disproof of Hodge Conjecture by Graph Theory Jihyeon Yoon April 02,
    2024 Hodge conjecture is turned out to be false in extension of graph theory based
    on its algebraic attribute. Hash3D: Training-free Acceleration for 3D Generation
    Xingyi Yang and 1 more April 02, 2024 The evolution of 3D generative modeling
    has been notably propelled by the adoption of 2D diffusion models. Despite this
    progress, the cumbersome optimization process per se presents a critical hurdle
    to efficiency. In this paper, we introduce Hash3D, a universal acceleration for
    3D generation without model training. Central to Hash3D is the insight that feature-map
    redundancy is prevalent in images rendered from camera positions and diffusion
    time-steps in close proximity. By effectively hashing and reusing these feature
    maps across neighboring timesteps and camera angles, Hash3D substantially prevents
    redundant calculations, thus accelerating the diffusion model''s inference in
    3D generation tasks. We achieve this through an adaptive grid-based hashing. Surprisingly,
    this feature-sharing mechanism not only speed up the generation but also enhances
    the smoothness and view consistency of the synthesized 3D objects. Our experiments
    covering 5 textto-3D and 3 image-to-3D models, demonstrate Hash3D''s versatility
    to speed up optimization, enhancing efficiency by 1.3 ∼ 4×. Additionally, Hash3D''s
    integration with 3D Gaussian splatting largely speeds up 3D model creation, reducing
    text-to-3D processing to about 10 minutes and image-to-3D conversion to roughly
    30 seconds. The code is provided in https://github.com/Adamdad/hash3D. Area and
    Power Efficient Implementation of Configurable Ring Oscillator PUF Enas Abulibdeh
    and 4 more April 02, 2024 Physically Unclonable Function (PUF) is an emerging
    hardware security primitive that provides a promising solution for lightweight
    security. PUFs can be used to generate a secret key that depends on the random
    manufacturing process variation of the device for lightweight authentication and
    device identification. This work proposes an optimized version of the Configurable
    Ring Oscillator (CRO) PUF that aims to reduce power consumption and area overhead.
    The proposed design eliminates the duplication of ROs, reduces the switching activity,
    and introduces the inter-stage delay as an additional source of randomness. The
    proposed PUF has been implemented in 22nm FDSOI technology using the Synopsys
    tools. A comprehensive security analysis has been acquired utilizing Challenge-Response
    Pairs collected from 8 chips. Results show an average of 49.42%, 38.25%, 9.95%,
    and 45.5% for uniformity, diffuseness, reliability, and uniqueness, respectively.
    Compared with the state-of-the-art, the proposed design achieves an area and power
    reduction of 75% and 65.1%, respectively. With the proposed PUF delivering 10
    32 CRPs, it is classified as a strong PUF. Additionally, the proposed design passes
    NIST tests and achieves an average prediction accuracy of 67.1% of machine learning
    modeling. A Hero Or A Killer? Overview Of Opportunities, Challenges, And Implications

    model that can create videos based on simple user prompts. The model promises
    to revolutionize the way content is created. When SORA is released to the general
    public, it may transform a wide array of industries but also pose significant
    challenges and risks. This research aims to provide a comprehensive understanding
    of SORA''s opportunities, challenges, and implications. It explores its potential
    applications in film-making, education, gaming, advertising, accessibility, healthcare,
    and social media content creation. Additionally, it delves into its potential
    challenges and risks, including misinformation, privacy concerns, bias, regulatory
    complexities, and dependence on technology. This research provides important recommendations
    to promote responsible deployment of the AI model. Advancements and Challenges

    research with profound implications for the future of autonomous systems. This
    report delves into the intricacies of designing robotic hands, the hurdles in
    creating robust manipulation actions, and the advancements in the field that poised
    to catalyze a new era of autonomy. Drawing inspiration from science fiction''s
    portrayal of robotics, we bridge the conceptual gap between fiction and ongoing
    real-world technical research, aiming to provide a comprehensive overview for
    students interested in robotics. ← Previous 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 … 509 510 Next →

    \ of\nthings; energy harvesting; blockchain technology\nI.\nINTRODUCTION\nWithout\
    \ a doubt, agriculture is the most important source of\nlivelihood in Bangladesh.\
    \ As the world’s population expands,\nincreased agricultural output is essential.\
    \ The amount of\nfresh water and appropriate fertilizer used in irrigation must\n\
    be raised in order to maintain enhanced farm productivity.\nUnintentional water\
    \ waste happens when water consumption\nis not planned. Choosing the right fertilizer\
    \ for a particular\nfarmland is likewise a difficult challenge for our farmers.\n\
    This demonstrates the urgent need for alternatives to reduce\nwater waste and\
    \ appropriate fertilizer choices without placing\nfarmers under stress. In the\
    \ Electronic age, agriculture is rapidly\nbecoming a data-intensive sector, with\
    \ farmers collecting and\nanalyzing massive amounts of data from various sources\
    \ (e.g.,\nsensors, farming machinery, etc.) to obtain vital information\nand become\
    \ more efficient in production. Technology nowadays\nhas advanced a lot. With\
    \ the help of Machine Learning and\nIoT devices, a drastic change can be made\
    \ possible in the\nagricultural industry [1].\nWith the release of open-source\
    \ Arduino devices and the\navailability of different sensors, it is now possible\
    \ to build\ndevices that can monitor soil moisture content and irrigate\nfields\
    \ or landscapes as needed. Machine learning algorithms\nare used to assess various\
    \ agricultural data and may readily\nforecast which decisions should be made to\
    \ improve farmland\nproductivity. In comparison to their previous farming ways,\n\
    the farmer may easily combine ML and IoT into their farming\nand create an automated\
    \ system that is more time effective\nand less risky. Here, Fig. 1 depicts the\
    \ difference between the\ntraditional system with the ML-based agricultural framework.\n\
    Wireless Sensor Networks(WSNs) technologies have a\nmajor challenge with limited\
    \ energy. Many research in WSNs\nhas also been focused on reliable energy supply\
    \ to extend\nthe survival time of limited power sources in a network [2].\nEnergy\
    \ harvesting techniques are used to overcome the energy-\nscarcity problem of\
    \ WSNs. Energy harvesting is a process in\nwhich energy is obtained from the environment\
    \ as renewable\nenergy sources like solar radiation, Radio Frequency (RF),\nwind,\
    \ geothermal, electromagnetic (EM) waves, hydro, etc.,\nand is stored effectively\
    \ for driving various applications systems\nwhich may include wireless sensor\
    \ networks (WSNs) [3] [4].\nTherefore, it can be used to operate the devices of\
    \ the embedded\nsystem for a reliable energy supply.\nSecurity is one of the most\
    \ critical aspects of IoT, as it\ndeals with the protection of data and devices\
    \ from unauthorized\naccess, use, disclosure, disruption, modification, or destruction\n\
    [5]. Encryption mechanisms are mostly used to ensure that\ndata is securely transmitted.\
    \ But, regularly used encryption\nalgorithms such as DES, AES, and RSA will be\
    \ heavy for small-\nscale embedded systems. Therefore, blockchain technology can\n\
    be used as a lightweight calculation technique to reliably operate\nand secure\
    \ an IoT system[6] [7].\nThis paper presents the latest IoT-ML-driven intelligent\
    \ agri-\ncultural management and provides a substantial new research\ndirection.\
    \ The central insight of this work is to offer possible\nsolutions to farming\
    \ hazards while providing a combined\nframework. Some significant contributions\
    \ of this paper are\noutlined as follows:\n•\nSmart Management: Traditional agricultural\
    \ manage-\nment is strengthened with edge-cutting technologies\n(i.e., IoT and\
    \ Machine Learning).\n•\nDistant Monitoring and Controlling: Farmers can\nmonitor\
    \ and control irrigation management from a\ndistance in terms of sensor-based\
    \ real-time data.\n•\nIntelligent Decision Making: Our machine learning\nmodel\
    \ provides substantial water control management\nwww.ijacsa.thesai.org\n985 |\

    \ System: Our proposed\nsolution uses blockchain technology to create a secure\n\
    and decentralized network that can ensure data integrity\nand protect data from\
    \ denial of service (DDoS) attacks,\nand man-in-the-middle (MITM) attacks.\n•\n\
    Energy Harvesting: To ensure a continuous energy\nsupply for the IoT system, we\
    \ have introduced energy\nharvesting technology which reduces the hassle for the\n\
    farmers of using extra batteries.\nThe rest of the paper is organized as follows:\
    \ Section II\nprovides an overview of existing works related to our proposed\n\
    framework. Section III provides a detailed description of the\nhardware that have\
    \ used in this research. Section IV discusses\nthe proposed IoT-ML-based smart\
    \ agricultural framework.\nSection V discusses the blockchain-based security of\
    \ our system.\nSection VI presents the real-life implementation of our project.\n\
    Next, Section VII illustrates and analyzes the experimental\nresult from our machine\
    \ learning models. Section VIII future\nresearch directions in this field of research.\
    \ Finally, Section IX\ngives a brief conclusion.\nII.\nRELATED RESEARCH\nSeveral\
    \ ML-IoT-based researches and project works on\nagriculture systems have been\
    \ carried out till today.\nIn [8], For remote sensing and smart agriculture, Ullo\
    \ et al.\npresented a review of research on the developments in smart\nsensors\
    \ and IoT. They put forth some suggestions for IoT\nadvancements that will support\
    \ researchers and agriculturalists\nin their work.\nIn [9], Samuel et al. analyzed\
    \ numerous techniques for crop\nselection, crop sowing, weed detection, and system\
    \ monitoring.\nThey have recommended different image processing methods\nfor weed\
    \ and leaf detection and evaluated the benefits and\ndrawbacks of each. Drone\
    \ implementation has been considered\nfor real-time monitoring and seed planting.\
    \ However, no actual\nimplementation is shown in this research; they have only\n\
    reviewed several smart agricultural strategies.\nIn [10], they analyze soil moisture\
    \ levels and apply auto\nirrigation to the crops. In order to eliminate the need\
    \ for human\ninvolvement, this system also senses temperature, humidity, and\n\
    the presence of impediments in the targeted region. These data\nare accessible\
    \ to the user via mobile from the cloud. By giving\nthe motor driver the command\
    \ YES/NO based on this data, the\nuser can control the operation of the motor.\n\
    In [11], they use a cloud-based architecture and the Internet\nof Things to examine\
    \ a smart irrigation system. This system\nis designed to measure soil moisture\
    \ and humidity and then\nprocess this data in the cloud using a variety of machine-\n\
    learning techniques. Farmers receive accurate information\nregarding water content\
    \ regulations. If farmers apply smart\nirrigation, they can reduce their water\
    \ usage.\nIn [12], they use IoT and machine learning to predict\nlate blight disease\
    \ in potatoes and tomatoes prior to the first\noccurrence. This will send farmers\
    \ a warning message on the\nprecise time to apply the protective pesticides.\n\
    In [13], for yield prediction, they present a hybrid ML\nmodel using IoT. They\
    \ use a two-tier ML approach named\naKNCN and ELM-mBOA.In the first tire, they\
    \ estimate soil\nquality and in the second tier, they predict the crop yield.\n\
    In agriculture, supply, and demand have always been crucial\nissues for sustainable\
    \ production management. To address\nand provide a possible solution to this problem,\
    \ M. Lee et\nal. proposed an IoT-based controlled agricultural production\nmanagement\
    \ [14]. The authors developed a decision support\nsystem to predict specific criteria\
    \ based on IoT-enabled sensor\ndata.\nA cloud-based real-time data analysis model\
    \ is proposed\nin [15] instead of dew-point humidity. In this regard, they\ndesigned\
    \ a CMM index measurement model to evaluate the\ncrops’ comfort level of relative\
    \ humidity levels.\nTo increase the crop production rate, real-time data analysis\n\
    based on an artificial model is proposed by Y. Zhou et al. in [16].\nThe current\
    \ innovation trend expects farmers to use IoT and\ntechnology to identify the\
    \ organization of those difficulties they\nface, such as water management deficiencies\
    \ in agriculture\nand productivity concerns. This research has attempted to\n\
    build dazzling agricultural cultivation patterns utilizing IoT\ntechnologies.\
    \ IoT has significantly improved agriculture by\nanalyzing various agricultural\
    \ difficulties and issues.\nAn IOT-based intelligent technology for agriculture\
    \ that can\nsense soils and environmental factors was proposed by Abhijith\nH.\
    \ V. et al. in [17]. In order to identify the urgent needs for\noptimal crop growth,\
    \ they applied data mining techniques to\nthe sensed data.\nAbraham et al. [18]\
    \ create a proof-of-concept farm surveil-\nlance system that employs IoT and deep\
    \ learning to identify\nwww.ijacsa.thesai.org\n986 | P a g e\n(IJACSA) International\
    \ Journal of Advanced Computer Science and Applications,\nVol. 14, No. 7, 2023\n\
    farm encroachment.\nThe purpose of the study Wongpatikaseree et al. [19], is\n\
    to propose a traceability system, summarizing and presenting\nobserved data from\
    \ the smart farm.\nFor smart farming, Deden Ardiansyah et al. [20] suggested\n\
    a WSN Server that can handle and optimize agricultural data.\nThey instantly store\
    \ the data in the database, which is afterward\nrepresented as a website and accessible\
    \ through the Internet\nnetwork.\nAutomation in agriculture is a basic need for\
    \ remote\ncontrol-based agricultural management to ensure sustainable\ndevelopment\
    \ in this field of research. In this regard, L.\nVijayaraja et al. proposed an\
    \ IoT-based monitoring system\nusing wireless communication networks in [21].\
    \ The power\nsupply management used in this framework is entirely from the\nrenewable\
    \ energy source that provides a cost-effective model\nfor sensor-based decision\
    \ management in intelligent farming.\nIn [22], Yaw-Wen Kuo, et al. presented a\
    \ Long-range IoT\nsystem where they developed four types of IoT units based on\n\
    Long-range technology. They employed pH, ORP, and EC in\nType A and water, air,\
    \ and humidity sensors in Type B. In type\nC, the pump can be operated remotely,\
    \ and in type D, a water\nflow or water meter-controlling system is provided.\n\
    They presented a cloud service-based architecture in [23]\nthat includes a variety\
    \ of services for farmers, including agri-\nfood-related services, financing,\
    \ fostering, warehouse manage-\nment, etc. They have suggested interactive video\
    \ conferencing,\nvoice-based services, text messaging, web portal services, and\n\
    more under the heading of cloud services.\nA key component of practicing smart\
    \ agriculture is precision\nagriculture. In this context, Patil et al. [24] suggested\
    \ a system\nthat measures soil moisture using sensors for temperature,\nhumidity,\
    \ and soil moisture. Additionally, they offered various\nmethods for highlighting\
    \ the issue of data loss.\nIn [25], Quasim et al. use blockchain techniques in\
    \ smart\nhealthcare systems to ensure the security of healthcare data.\nIt provides\
    \ the security, privacy, and efficiency of the data in\ntransmission between wearable\
    \ sensors and Internet of Things\n(IoT) devices.\nIn [26], Makhdoom et al. made\
    \ a blockchain-based frame-\nwork for privacy-preserving and secure data sharing\
    \ in smart\ncities. The system secures data sharing by segmenting the\nblockchain\
    \ network into different channels, where each channel\nconsists of a limited number\
    \ of authorized organizations and\nhandles a particular type of data, such as\
    \ financial information,\nhealth data, smart car data, or data related to smart\
    \ energy.\nAdditionally, smart contracts contain access control rules that\nregulate\
    \ who has access to the data of users within a channel.\nMany different types\
    \ of intelligent agricultural systems were\ndeveloped in the earlier work. Some\
    \ of these current systems\nare tabulated in Table I.\nIII.\nSYSTEM HARDWARE\n\

    \ a variety of hardware components,\nincluding the ESP8266 Node MCU (Fig. 2) processing\

    \ powers the system.\nB. Working Principle\nWe have divided our proposed framework\
    \ into different\nsubparts and each part’s working procedure is given below. The\n\
    overall working procedure is depicted in Fig. 12.\n1) Collecting Data From Sensor:\
    \ We used four different\ntypes of sensors, including capacitive soil moisture\
    \ sensors, pH\nsensors, MH-RD rain sensors, and LDR sensors, to execute\nsmart\
    \ IoT agriculture. We can estimate how much water is in\nthe soil with the aid\
    \ of a soil moisture sensor. A pH sensor,\nwhich ranges from 0 to 14, allows us\
    \ to determine the water’s\nacidity or alkalinity. Water turns acidic if the value\
    \ falls below\n7, else it is alkanoic. Consider levels 5.5 to 7 to be ideal for\n\
    growing crops. We can choose the best fertilizer for the soil\nwith the aid of\

    \ both included. The raindrop sensor\naids in our selection of how to operate\
    \ the motor. The LDR\nsensor, which is used to detect the presence of light, has\
    \ also\nbeen employed.\nNow, each of these sensors is linked to a node MCU board\n\
    in our project, and data from the sensors is uploaded to the node\nMCU board and\
    \ shown on the serial monitor of the Arduino\nUNO editor and\n2) Sending Data\
    \ to Cloud Server: The node MCU board\nreceives all sensor data, which we would\
    \ love to save in the\ncloud in order to control for remote distance. We have\
    \ utilized\nFirebase as a cloud server. We linked the Firebase authentication\n\
    and real-time database URL that we built for our project with\nthe Arduino UNO\
    \ script in order to integrate Firebase with\nNode MCU.\nAll data is sent as a\
    \ parent-child combination to Firebase.\nAll of the sensor data is sent from the\
    \ node MCU as a child\nof Smart Irrigation, which we have constructed as Parent.\
    \ The\nFirebase stores the child value as a key-value pair.\n3) Data Collection:\
    \ The Firebase’s database contains all of\nthe sensor data, which is compiled\
    \ as a CSV file. Four columns\nmake up our dataset: pH, LDR, Rain, and Moisture.\
    \ Nearly\n820 data are in our dataset. Only integer values are accepted in\nthe\
    \ Moisture column here, whereas string values are accepted\nin the Rain and LDR\
    \ columns.\n4) Data Pre-processing: Data can be often inconsistent.\nMissing values\
    \ or values out of range is typical. So, the dataset\nneeds some pre-processing\
    \ before it can be used to train any\nmodel [27]. For this reason, we have considered\
    \ three such\ncases.\n•\nMissing Value Handling: While exploring our dataset,\n\
    we observed humidity, raining status, daylight status,\nand pH level fields with\
    \ missing values. Therefore, we\nhave filled them with average values of the respective\n\
    field.\n•\nOne Hot Decoder: Label encoding is simply the\nprocess of converting\
    \ each value in a column to a\nnumber. By using label encoding, we have converted\n\
    the categorical text data into model-understandable\nnumerical data. We had to\
    \ use the label encoding to\nget our dataset ready for our model.\n•\nAbnormal\
    \ Data Handling: Some data contain abnor-\nmal values. For example, the range\
    \ of the temperature\nin our dataset falls between -20 to 30 degrees Celsius.\n\
    However, we have even found some data above and\nbelow this range. Data tuples\
    \ with these abnormalities\nhave been dropped from the dataset.\n•\nNormalization:\
    \ Normalization is used to increase the\naccuracy of models [28]. It is simply\
    \ the process of\nhaving all the data on the same scale. We have used\nwww.ijacsa.thesai.org\n\

    \ and pressure\nas features to train our model. The features used\nto teach a\
    \ machine-learning algorithm have different\nranges of values. This can badly\
    \ affect the machine’s\nlearning ability. To solve this problem, we have\nstandardized\
    \ the feature values so that all the features\nstand equal in their representation.\
    \ By normalization,\nall the feature values are mapped in the range between\n\
    0 and 1.\n5) Machine Learning Model: The developed architecture is\na Neural Network\
    \ (NN) based because of its great accuracy. The\nfundamental advantage of NN over\
    \ classical machine learning\nmodels is that it recognizes significant traits\
    \ automatically\nand without human intervention. It’s a feed-forward NN with\n\
    parameters using the back-propagation algorithm and stochastic\ngradient descent.\
    \ Distinct processing layers serve different\npurposes. The output of the feature\
    \ map is produced by\nconventional layers, which conduct linear convolution between\n\
    a series of input tensors and filters. The nonlinear transformation\nis performed\
    \ using the ReLU, which is the most widely\nemployed activation function. The\
    \ activation function for the\nfully connected layer to the end must be careful\
    \ on the tasks.\nBatch normalization and an activation layer are performed after\n\
    each convolution.\nReLU = max(0, X)\n(1)\nd(x) = activation(wx + b)\n(2)\nDropout(x,\

    \ Application Development: A smart remote con-\ntrol application can ease our\
    \ maximum task [29]. We have used\nthe MIT app inventor to make the mobile application\
    \ that will\nbe connected to our system and by using this app we can do\nthe following\
    \ task\n•\nFertilizer Suggestion: By analyzing the pH value, the\napp may suggest\
    \ which fertilizer is best for a given\nsoil. The app will recommend some alkanoic\

    \ versa. Algorithm 1 depicts how the fertilizer\nis suggested in our system.\n\
    •\nVisualization of Predicted Results: In order to predict\nwhether the motor\
    \ would turn off or not based on\nthe moisture, LDR, and raindrop sensor values,\
    \ we\nconstruct a neural network model and link it with\nour mobile app. Algorithm\

    \ signal on to the\nnode MCU via the wifi module and sets the pin value\nto the\
    \ LOW, so turning off the motor.\nV.\nBLOCKCHAIN-BASED SMART-AGRI\nBlockchain\
    \ was described as a data structure using asym-\nmetric encryption algorithms\
    \ and hash functions to ensure\nthat data tampering and forgery are impossible\
    \ [30] [31] [32].\nEvery smart system needs to be taken under the shelter of a\n\
    security system to avoid getting an external attack. Our smart\nagricultural system\
    \ is public so any intruder can make attacks\nsuch as DoS attacks to crash the\
    \ system, and spoofing to alter\nthe control. In the IoT environment where high\
    \ computational\nencryption, decryption, and high-level security are not possible.\n\

    \ Computer Science and Applications,\nVol. 14, No. 7, 2023\nTherefore, We are\
    \ implanting blockchain technologies into our\nsmart agricultural system through\
    \ which we are capable to\nmaintain high throughput, low latency, low communication\n\
    cost, and tamper-proof and traceability. Blockchain refers to a\ndistributed ledger\
    \ system where data or transactions are stored\nin blocks that are connected to\
    \ each other through making\nhash which can not only serve as unique IDs but also\
    \ prove\nthe integrity of the blocks. The hash of the previous block is\nused\
    \ to make a hash for the next block along with its data.\nIf any intruder wants\
    \ to tamper or alter the block data, all\nthe consecutive block hash will be changed.\
    \ Therefore, any\nintruder attempts to alter the data or spoof the blockchain\
    \ will\nnot be possible.\nIn this system, we consider nodeMCU, Firebase cloud,\
    \ and\nmobile app as nodes. In order to avoid altering data in the\nnetwork, we\
    \ are using blockchain technology. When any node\nwants to send data to other\
    \ nodes, it encapsulates the data\ninto a block along with its hash values (SHA256)\
    \ and nodeID\nthen adds it to the blockchain. All these nodes will contain the\n\
    blockchain locally. After adding the block, the node sends it\nto the cloud through\
    \ the network. We are not using any PoW,\nPoS, or accountant selection algorithms\
    \ which is not possible\nbecause of a very small amount of nodes and our nodeMCU\n\
    has very limited capabilities to run these algorithms (Algorithm\n3). When the\
    \ block is sent to the cloud, I validate the block by\nchecking all the hashes\
    \ of the previous block along with the\nnodeID. If it gets any error, the node\
    \ will consider the block\nas from an attacker and reject the block from adding\
    \ to the\nchain. Fig. 13 depicts the blockchain in our system.\nFig. 13. Blockchain\

    \ ANALYSIS\nA. System Evaluation\nIn Table II, we have shown the difference between\
    \ our\nsystem and the existing systems. The criterion based on which\nwe have\
    \ shown the differences are remote monitor control, data\nvisualization, customized\
    \ mobile application, machine learning\nintegrated framework, creating own database,\
    \ central cloud\ndatabase, pH-based fertilizer suggestions, Machine learning\n\
    model development, and full automation. The references from\n[11] to [24] there\
    \ is no such system that has implemented all the\ncriteria in their system. But\
    \ we have successfully implemented\nall the criteria in our systems.\nB. Machine\
    \ Learning Model Evaluation\nOur deep learning neural network is implemented with\n\
    the help of our own dataset. We split the dataset into 80-20\nratios for training\
    \ and validation purposes. The heat map of the\nfeatures columns is illustrated\
    \ in Fig. 16. We fit our gradient\ndescent neural network within the data set.\
    \ The input layer\nof the neural network receives 3 input lines from the features\n\
    column, namely, rain status, moisture level, and daylight status\nrespectively.\
    \ Then we add one dense layer with 16 neurons and\nthe activation function as\
    \ ReLu. The next layer is a dropout\nlayer with a 20% drop rate. Next, we add\
    \ another dense layer\nwith 8 neurons and apply the activation function as ReLu.\n\
    Then we add another dropout layer with a 20% drop rate.\nFinally, for the output\
    \ layer, we add another dense layer with\na single neuron with is satiable for\
    \ binary classification (i.e.\nmotor on-off decision) with activation function\
    \ as Sigmoid.\nThe experimental result of our model is represented in\nTable III\
    \ while showing the validation loss rate as binary cross\nentropy and validation\
    \ accuracy level in different epochs. Our\nmodel successfully outcomes a stable\
    \ level of accuracy for\nthe different epochs. We got almost 89.5% accuracy in\
    \ our\nexperimental set-up.\nVIII.\nFUTURE RESEARCH DIRECTION\nFor future smart\
    \ irrigation management, several issues must\nbe addressed as follows:\n•\nLow-latency\
    \ in Real-Time Application: The moni-\ntoring and controlling mobile application\
    \ must be able\nto transmit real-time data to the farmers or its entity\nwhile\
    \ ensuring a low latency network.\n•\nHigh Bandwidth: To facilitate a buffer-less\
    \ transmis-\nsion, we need to ensure maximum bandwidth level to\nthe transmission\
    \ process.\n•\nConnectivity: To meet the high communication de-\nmands of future\
    \ IoT-ML integrated irrigation systems,\nreliable synchronization between linked\
    \ autos would\nbe required.\n•\nDeployment of Network Elements: When a network\n\
    has a high enough number of nodes, its overall\nperformance increases. Because\
    \ network equipment\ndeployment is costly, it is vital to have the required\n\
    number of network components up and running as\nquickly as feasible.\n•\nAugmented\
    \ Reality: AR is a multimedia application\nthat mixes real-world scenes into virtual\
    \ scenes and\nsuperimposes virtual scenes over real-world scenes to\nsupplement\
    \ traditional real-image information. This\ntechnology has the potential to help\
    \ farmers become\nmore aware of the app’s functionality.\n•\nEdge Computing: This\
    \ networking approach is built\non a network control layer that is logically centralized.\n\

    IX.\nCONCLUSION\nWe have put forth an integrated solution that enables\nfarmers\
    \ to solve the challenges that limit their production\nand profitability by utilizing\
    \ cutting-edge technologies like\nmachine learning (ML), the Internet of Things\
    \ (IoT), and\nblockchain. Through user-friendly mobile applications and\na secure\
    \ cloud database, this model, implemented with a\ngenerated database, offers helpful\
    \ insights and recommendations\nto farmers, including pesticide usage and water\
    \ motor control.\nReal-time monitoring and data collecting is made possible\n\
    by the integration of IoT devices, enabling accurate decision-\nmaking and assuring\
    \ optimal resource allocation. Incorpo-\nrating blockchain technology also improves\
    \ data traceability,\ntransparency, and integrity, fostering trust and accountability\n\
    throughout the agricultural ecosystem. Farmers may gain from\nhigher productivity,\
    \ decreased expenses, and enhanced general\nagricultural management by implementing\
    \ our Smart-Agri\nframework. They can obtain up-to-date, accurate information,\n\
    make decisions that will increase productivity and reduce\nwaste, and improve\
    \ their agricultural techniques. We have\napplied the gradient descent neural\
    \ network model for water\ncontrol management and achieved up to 89.5% accuracy.\
    \ In\naddition, the suggested structure creates chances for cooperation,\ninformation\
    \ exchange, and market access, all of which help\nthe agricultural industry thrive\
    \ and flourish sustainably.\nIn the future, the framework’s scalability, and its\
    \ inter-\noperability can all be explored through more research and\ndevelopment\
    \ in this area, along with potential problems like\nconnectivity problems and\
    \ data privacy issues. We can build an\necosystem that really revolutionizes the\
    \ agriculture sector by\ncontinually improving and building upon these technological\n\
    achievements, making it more intelligent, efficient, and robust\nin the face of\
    \ changing global issues.\nACKNOWLEDGMENT\nWe would like to acknowledge the support\

    Communications and Sensing for 6G and Beyond: A Comprehensive Review Wei Jiang
    and 14 more April 04, 2024 Next-generation cellular technologies, commonly referred
    to as the sixth generation (6G), are envisioned to support a higher system capacity,
    better performance, and network sensing capabilities. The terahertz (THz) band
    is one potential enabler to this end due to the large unused frequency bands and
    the high spatial resolution enabled by the short signal wavelength and large bandwidth.
    Different from earlier surveys, this paper presents a comprehensive treatment
    and technology survey on THz communications and sensing in terms of advantages,
    Rapid Feasibility Assessment of Energy Unit Integration in Distribution Networks
    Sicheng Gong and 2 more April 03, 2024 In contemporary heavy-load distribution
    networks, preceding feasibility assessment is imperative before incorporating
    additional energy units. However, the feasibility examination for massive combined
    operational scenarios of relevant units is computationally intensive with repetitive
    power flow calculations. To this end, this paper proposes a rapid assessment framework,
    the kernel of which is to learn from formerly examined scenarios, thus forming
    expansive feasible/infeasible regions to geometrically rule in/out subsequent
    scenarios. Without running the power flow computation in most scenarios, we accelerate
    the assessment process. Moreover, enlightened by heuristic hypersurface search,
    such prechecking efficiency can be further boosted. In a risk-averse manner, this
    framework can be conceptualized using the exact grid model. Especially, evidenced
    by testing on a 10.5kV distribution grid, the framework shows a significant assessment
    efficiency improvement and strict accuracy guarantee, where we observe at least
    76.13% assessment time reduction and zero accuracy loss in all testing cases.
    We anticipate this work to be a starting point for more sophisticated geometry-accelerating
    feasibility assessment methods. Improving Molecular De Novo Drug Design with Transformers
    Dhaval Soni and 7 more April 03, 2024 Drug design is undergoing a transformation
    as we challenge conventional methods by integrating state-of-the-art artificial
    intelligence with the intricate domain of molecular biology. At the heart of our
    endeavor lies a significant challenge: the scarcity of datasets containing active
    compounds for emerging target proteins. To confront this obstacle, we''re pioneering
    an innovative approach. We''re merging the advanced Generative Pre-trained Transformer
    (GPT) architecture with the nuanced capabilities of Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)
    networks, with the aim of generating Simplified Molecular Input Line Entry System
    (SMILES) strings to unveil novel therapeutic pathways. Additionally, we''re employing
    a Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT) pretraining strategy
    to enrich our model with comprehensive molecular data, including amino acid sequences
    and molecular SMILES datasets. Through meticulous fine-tuning on a meticulously
    curated protein-ligand complex dataset, we''re achieving precise conditional generation
    via autoregressive supervised learning. Our research introduces a groundbreaking
    method to assess molecular affinity, validated against established proteins, showcasing
    superior binding affinities compared to certain FDA-approved drugs in docking
    experiments. By pushing the boundaries of generative algorithms and establishing
    a robust framework for evaluating molecular affinity, we''re driving forward the
    field of de novo drug design, offering promising therapeutic avenues and enabling
    deeper exploration of the chemical landscape. Formalising a Gateway-based Blockchain

    Behavior of NO Fe-Si Sheets under Tensile and Compressive Stress Carlo Appino
    and 6 more April 03, 2024 The stress dependence of the magnetic properties of
    non-oriented Fe-Si steel sheets has been investigated by measurement and analysis
    of hysteresis loop, magnetization curve, and energy losses taken at different
    peak polarization values Jp (0.5 T – 1.5 T) between DC and f = 400 Hz. The salient
    feature of the material response to the stress lies in the monotonic deterioration
    of the soft magnetic properties, across the whole (Jp - f) domain, on passing
    from the maximum tensile stress (σ = +30 MPa) to the maximum compression (σ =
    -30 MPa). This is understood in terms of stress-induced redistribution of the
    domains between easy axes, making magnetic hardening by compression directly related
    to unfavorably directed domains and 90° domain-wallmediated magnetization transitions.
    The loss decomposition is carried out across the whole investigated frequency
    range, taking into account the skin effect at the highest frequencies. Quasi-static
    and dynamic losses follow a same trend with σ, both monotonically increasing on
    passing from the tensile to the compressive stress limits, according to the theoretically
    expected relationship existing between the hysteresis and the excess loss components.
    The latter is shown to identify the correlation regions where the magnetization
    is reversed of size comparable with the average grain size and loosely following
    the dependence of the loss figure on the applied stress. A bio-inspired hardware
    implementation of an analog spike-based hippocampus memory mo... Daniel Casanueva-Morato
    and 4 more April 03, 2024 The need for processing at the edge the increasing amount
    of data that is being produced by multitudes of sensors has led to the demand
    for mode power efficient computational systems, by exploring alternative computing
    paradigms and technologies. Neuromorphic engineering is a promising approach that
    can address this need by developing electronic systems that faithfully emulate
    the computational properties of animal brains. In particular, the hippocampus
    stands out as one of the most relevant brain region for implementing auto associative
    memories capable of learning large amounts of information quickly and recalling
    it efficiently. In this work, we present a computational spike-based memory model
    inspired by the hippocampus that takes advantage of the features of analog electronic
    circuits: energy efficiency, compactness, and real-time operation. This model
    can learn memories, recall them from a partial fragment and forget. It has been
    implemented as a Spiking Neural Networks directly on a mixed-signal neuromorphic
    chip. We describe the details of the hardware implementation and demonstrate its
    operation via a series of benchmark experiments, showing how this research prototype
    paves the way for the development of future robust and low-power mixed-signal
    neuromorphic processing systems. Exploratory Study of oneM2M-based Interoperability
    Architectures for IoT: A Smart Cit... VJS Pranavasri and 6 more April 03, 2024
    The advent of the Internet of Things (IoT) has ushered in transformative possibilities
    for smart cities, with the potential to revolutionize urban living through enhanced
    connectivity and data-driven decision-making. However, the effective realization
    of IoT in smart cities hinges upon the seamless interoperability of diverse devices
    and systems. To address this critical need, the oneM2M standards initiative has
    emerged as a foundational framework for IoT interoperability. In this research
    paper, we perform an exploratory analysis of three prominent open-source oneM2M
    based interoperability systems-Mobius, OM2M, and ACME. We leverage an existing
    large-scale system provided by our Smart City Living Lab deployed at IIIT Hyderabad,
    sprawling a 66-acre campus featuring over 370 nodes across eight verticals. We
    investigate the architectural characteristics of each solution, considering their
    strengths and limitations in facilitating IoT interoperability. Through this analysis,
    our paper aims to provide valuable insights for stakeholders seeking to implement
    IoT interoperability solutions in the context of smart cities. By evaluating the
    strengths and limitations of Mobius, OM2M, and ACME, we seek to offer guidance
    for selecting the most suitable solution. Our analysis reveals that the optimal
    framework choice depends on specific quality constraints: Mobius excels in performance,
    while ACME offers advantages in ease of setup for smaller-scale implementations.
    Comparing Concepts of Service Blocking Queues in Hardware-in-the-Loop Systems
    Tobias Konheiser and 3 more April 03, 2024 ZF is developing an autonomous driving
    system, which requires extensive testing of the developed devices and software
    on hardware-in-the-loop (HIL) systems. Therefore, a robust and high-performing
    HIL system is essential. The purpose of a HIL system is to replay recorded data
    to the device-undertest. Recordings are loaded, processed and streamed to the
    deviceunder-test with real-time requirements. This streaming chain includes processing
    nodes and queues. This requires careful management of queue configurations. An
    overflow in the queue will result in packet loss, while an underflow may violate
    the real-time constraint. This study aims to develop and evaluate concepts for
    service blocking queues. These concepts block or pause the incoming service to
    a queue when necessary to avoid queue overflows and associated data loss. However,
    an out-of-the-box solution is not available and different approaches affect the
    behaviour and performance of the system. Therefore, the developed concepts are
    evaluated against each other and against the existing system based on selected
    performance parameters in specific scenarios. The scenarios cover a wide range
    of situations, reflecting standard input data with varying numbers of parallel
    streams and bottleneck scenarios forcing queue overflows or blockages. The developed
    service blocking queue concepts eliminate data loss in all scenarios, but introduce
    overhead, resulting in reduced system performance. However, the service blocking
    queue concept using a modified token-bucket approach proved to be the best solution,
    as the elimination of data loss justifies the additional overhead. This concept
    is proposed for implementation and deployment on the HIL system. Generative AI-Based
    Text Generation Methods Using Pre-Trained GPT 2 Model Rohit Pandey and 7 more
    April 03, 2024 A text generation model is a machine learning model that uses neural
    networks, especially transformers architecture to generate contextually relevant
    text based on linguistic patterns learned from extensive corpora. The models are
    trained on a huge amount of textual data so that they can model and learn complex
    concepts of any language like its grammar, vocabulary, phrases, and styles. FlowDep
    - An efficient and optical-flow-based algorithm of obstacle detection for aut...
    Chen-Fu Yeh and 7 more April 03, 2024 Obstacle detection is crucial for the safety
    and efficiency of autonomous vehicles. For mini-vehicles such as palm-sized drones,
    it is a challenge to implement traditional methods like Lidar due to high costs
    and physical constraints. Vision-based deep learning approaches, while accurate,
    are too resource-intensive for the mini-vehicles. To address this issue, we introduce
    Flowdep, a novel optical-flow-based algorithm inspired by the low-resolution but
    efficient motion-detection mechanisms in insects. Flowdep combines optic flow
    and IMU (or positioning information) to estimate the depth of every image pixel.
    We also generate a variant of Flowdep using the artificial neural network (Flowdep-ANN).
    Our tests show that Flowdep and Flowdep-ANN are 5.8 to 114.7 times faster than
    the DNN networks we tested, while the accuracies of Flowdep and Flowdep-ANN are
    on par with these networks. We further tested Flowdep and Flowdep-ANN on a small
    autonomous vehicle with Raspberry Pi4 as the computing platform, and both models
    successfully performed real-time object detection. The present work demonstrates
    the potential of using optical flow as an efficient approach to estimate depth
    and detect obstacles in resource-constrained mini-vehicles. Misinformative Data
    Visualizations in the Sports Media Domain Drew Scott April 03, 2024 Sports are
    data-driven: individual performances are measured using statistics and teams leverage
    data analytics to outperform competition. Sports media-which is created by media
    outlets, teams, and individuals-engage its consumers by creating narratives about
    the sport, teams, and players. Due to the importance of data in the sports world,
    data visualizations are a pillar in the sports media landscape. These data visualizations,
    while appearing to accurately convey data to its consumers, can be misinformative;
    media creators often have incentives to present specific narratives which don''t
    always fit the data. This work contributes to an existing misinformative data
    visualization taxonomy. In doing so, it makes it easier to understand the techniques
    and design choices used to create misinformative visualizations in all domains,
    not only in sports media. A Survey of RFID Authentication Protocols Drew Scott
    April 03, 2024 "Radio frequency identification" (RFID) systems are ubiquitous
    in today''s world. In an RFID system, it is a desirable to attain mutual authentication
    between a reader and a tag before commencing application-level communications.
    This is because tags should not share secret information with unknown parties
    and readers need to defend against tag impersonation. Authentication protocols
    designed for communication between computers, however, are not appropriate for
    RFID systems because tags are extremely resource constrained (low energy, small
    memory, etc.). Thus, there have been many attempts to design secure and practical
    authentication protocols for RFID systems over the years since RFID systems became
    prevalent. This survey summarizes and compares these protocols. The Effect of
    Multipath in Distributed Arrays with Time Reversal Hassna Ouassal and 2 more April
    03, 2024 This article examines the effect of multipath channels on the performance
    of distributed arrays that employ time reversal. A model of the signal received
    from a distributed array is formulated, and a statistical analysis of the variation
    in signal power in the presence of phase noise and multipath is given. We present
    the impact these nonidealities have on received signal power, and we analyze the
    received power for three specific cases: continuous waveform, impulse waveform,
    and modulated rectangular pulse waveform in the presence of standard channel models.
    It is shown that for larger arrays in multipath channels, the change in power
    between coherent and incoherent states converges to the line-of-sight channel.
    It is further shown that in a line-of-sight channel time-reversal completely cancels
    unknown channel delays resulting in coherent signals from all nodes in a distributed
    array, while in a multipath channel only the main diagonal round-trip paths are
    coherent. Nevertheless, this additional benefit improves signal coherence in complex
    channels and can aide in distributed array synchronization using two-way time
    transfer. Disproof of Hodge Conjecture by Graph Theory Jihyeon Yoon April 02,
    2024 Hodge conjecture is turned out to be false in extension of graph theory based
    on its algebraic attribute. Hash3D: Training-free Acceleration for 3D Generation
    Xingyi Yang and 1 more April 02, 2024 The evolution of 3D generative modeling
    has been notably propelled by the adoption of 2D diffusion models. Despite this
    progress, the cumbersome optimization process per se presents a critical hurdle
    to efficiency. In this paper, we introduce Hash3D, a universal acceleration for
    3D generation without model training. Central to Hash3D is the insight that feature-map
    redundancy is prevalent in images rendered from camera positions and diffusion
    time-steps in close proximity. By effectively hashing and reusing these feature
    maps across neighboring timesteps and camera angles, Hash3D substantially prevents
    redundant calculations, thus accelerating the diffusion model''s inference in
    3D generation tasks. We achieve this through an adaptive grid-based hashing. Surprisingly,
    this feature-sharing mechanism not only speed up the generation but also enhances
    the smoothness and view consistency of the synthesized 3D objects. Our experiments
    covering 5 textto-3D and 3 image-to-3D models, demonstrate Hash3D''s versatility
    to speed up optimization, enhancing efficiency by 1.3 ∼ 4×. Additionally, Hash3D''s
    integration with 3D Gaussian splatting largely speeds up 3D model creation, reducing
    text-to-3D processing to about 10 minutes and image-to-3D conversion to roughly
    30 seconds. The code is provided in https://github.com/Adamdad/hash3D. Area and
    Power Efficient Implementation of Configurable Ring Oscillator PUF Enas Abulibdeh
    and 4 more April 02, 2024 Physically Unclonable Function (PUF) is an emerging
    hardware security primitive that provides a promising solution for lightweight
    security. PUFs can be used to generate a secret key that depends on the random
    manufacturing process variation of the device for lightweight authentication and
    device identification. This work proposes an optimized version of the Configurable
    Ring Oscillator (CRO) PUF that aims to reduce power consumption and area overhead.
    The proposed design eliminates the duplication of ROs, reduces the switching activity,
    and introduces the inter-stage delay as an additional source of randomness. The
    proposed PUF has been implemented in 22nm FDSOI technology using the Synopsys
    tools. A comprehensive security analysis has been acquired utilizing Challenge-Response
    Pairs collected from 8 chips. Results show an average of 49.42%, 38.25%, 9.95%,
    and 45.5% for uniformity, diffuseness, reliability, and uniqueness, respectively.
    Compared with the state-of-the-art, the proposed design achieves an area and power
    reduction of 75% and 65.1%, respectively. With the proposed PUF delivering 10
    32 CRPs, it is classified as a strong PUF. Additionally, the proposed design passes
    NIST tests and achieves an average prediction accuracy of 67.1% of machine learning
    modeling. A Hero Or A Killer? Overview Of Opportunities, Challenges, And Implications
    Of Text-T... Mijat Kustudic and 1 more April 02, 2024 SORA is a text-to-video
    model that can create videos based on simple user prompts. The model promises
    to revolutionize the way content is created. When SORA is released to the general
    public, it may transform a wide array of industries but also pose significant
    challenges and risks. This research aims to provide a comprehensive understanding
    of SORA''s opportunities, challenges, and implications. It explores its potential
    applications in film-making, education, gaming, advertising, accessibility, healthcare,
    and social media content creation. Additionally, it delves into its potential
    challenges and risks, including misinformation, privacy concerns, bias, regulatory
    complexities, and dependence on technology. This research provides important recommendations
    to promote responsible deployment of the AI model. Advancements and Challenges
    in Robot Grasping and Manipulation for Aspiring Researche... Claudio Zito April
    02, 2024 Robot grasping and manipulation represent pivotal aspects of robotics
    research with profound implications for the future of autonomous systems. This
    report delves into the intricacies of designing robotic hands, the hurdles in
    creating robust manipulation actions, and the advancements in the field that poised
    to catalyze a new era of autonomy. Drawing inspiration from science fiction''s
    portrayal of robotics, we bridge the conceptual gap between fiction and ongoing
    real-world technical research, aiming to provide a comprehensive overview for
    students interested in robotics. ← Previous 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 … 509 510 Next →

    \ smart monitoring with intelligence highly gained signiﬁcant attention for enhancing\
    \ the productivity of the crop.\nCurrently, IoT generates a lot of real-time data\
    \ from the sensors, actuators, and identiﬁcation technologies. However,\nextracting\
    \ the meaningful insights from the data is necessary for realizing the intelligent\
    \ ecosystem in agriculture. Based upon\nthe previous studies, it is also identiﬁed\
    \ that the limited studies have merely implemented machine learning (ML) on real-time\n\
    data obtained through customized hardware with dedicated server. In this study,\
    \ we have proposed a customized hand-held\ndevice that enables to deliver recommendations\
    \ to the farmer on the basis of real-time data obtained through IoT hardware\n\
    and ML. A three-layer structure is proposed in the study for realizing custom\
    \ hardware with 2.4 GHz ZigBee and IoT sensors\nfor the data acquisition, communication,\
    \ and recommendation. As a part of real-time implementation, the calibration of\
    \ the\nsensors is processed to form a real-time dataset with precision. The study\
    \ evaluated four ML models and concluded that\nXGBoost has shown a better accuracy\
    \ on the proposed dataset. The XGBoost recommended the crop based on selected\n\
    parameters. The developed hand-held device can be customized with advance features\
    \ with crop recommendations.\n1. Introduction\nAgriculture is the key to human\
    \ survival, as it is the main\nsource of grain and other basic resources. In addition,\
    \ agricul-\nture accounts for about 4% of the world’s gross national prod-\nuct\
    \ (GDP) [1]. Urbanization and population growth in 2050\nconclude that food production\
    \ must be sustainably doubled\nwith minimal water resources [2]. About 97% of\
    \ the water\non the planet is salty, while the remaining 3 is freshwater [3].\n\
    Agriculture uses 70% of freshwater for irrigation in most\ndeveloping countries\
    \ [4]. Therefore, the eﬃcient use of fresh-\nwater during irrigation is the most\
    \ signiﬁcant issue in terms\nof cost reduction and yield improvement. Using the\
    \ traditional\nmethod, farmers manually check and regulate the availability\n\
    of water resulting in a 50% water loss [5]. However, diﬀerent\nirrigation techniques\
    \ like drip irrigation, sprinkle irrigation,\nand furrow irrigation have minimized\
    \ water wastage by 30-\n70% [6]. Yet, the optimal management of water content\
    \ in\nthe soil is not yet achieved with these irrigation techniques\nas overwater\
    \ usage in the agricultural ﬁeld leads to an overﬂow\nof nutrients from the soil\
    \ [7].\nAgriculture also requires adequate levels of fertilizers\nand pesticides,\
    \ as farmers use fertilizers and pesticides while\nneglecting the optimal needs\
    \ of the crop. Apart from that,\nwater availability, nutrient levels, and soil\
    \ moisture are some\nother factors that aﬀect crop productivity as well. With\
    \ the\ntraditional approach, it is a challenging task for the farmer\nto determine\
    \ water availability, nutrient levels, and soil\nHindawi\nJournal of Sensors\n\

    moisture and also to identify which factor is ﬁghting food pro-\nduction [8].\
    \ Here, smart and real-time systems help to moni-\ntor the various parameters\
    \ of the agricultural ﬁeld and\neﬀectively control the water level with other\
    \ resources to\nincrease productivity [9]. Nowadays, real-time monitoring\nand\
    \ intelligent systems are possible with the Internet of Things\n(IoT), as IoT\
    \ monitors agriculture with IoT-enabled sensors\nand communication protocols implemented\
    \ in agriculture\n[10]. The above facts conclude that the IoT has played crucial\n\
    role in multiple areas including agriculture with its sensing,\ncommunication,\
    \ and real-time monitoring features through\nthe IoT hardware. Moreover, it is\
    \ concluded from the previous\nstudies that the ML model delivered signiﬁcant\
    \ results on real-\ntime data [11]. The study framed a research question “How\n\
    and for what purpose may the ML technology be used in agri-\nculture on IoT real-time\
    \ data? On the basis of this research\nquestion, this study has carried out the\
    \ literature review.\n1.1. Literature Review. Large-scale agricultural monitoring\n\
    applications require reliable WSN networks because the maxi-\nmum number of sensors\
    \ is operated over a long period. A wire-\nless sensor network architecture for\
    \ vegetable greenhouses is\npresented to achieve scientiﬁc cultivation and minimize\
    \ man-\nagement eﬀort from an environmental monitoring perspective\n[12]. Smart\
    \ greenhouse management systems and WSNs are\nused to control and monitor agricultural\
    \ parameters and activ-\nities in greenhouses autonomously [13, 14]. A smart green-\n\
    house information monitoring system records environmental\nfactors with ZigBee\
    \ wireless sensors [15].Wi-Fi-based smart\nWSN has been proposed to monitor the\
    \ agricultural environ-\nment, and the system allows intelligent monitoring of\
    \ agricul-\ntural conditions [16, 17]. WSN’s eﬀorts recommend that\nsensor data\
    \ can be collected and sent to the main server [18].\nA WPAN-based water quality\
    \ monitoring system has been\nproposed to clean up and collect real-time sensor\
    \ data on agri-\ncultural land with the LabVIEW data logger [19]. In addition\
    \ to\nWSN, the advent of IoT technology has enabled farmers and\ntechnologists\
    \ to solve the challenges farmers face, such as water\nshortages, cost control,\
    \ and productivity issues [20].\nA scalable IoT and WSN architecture is proposed\
    \ for\nremote monitoring and control of agriculture [21]. For the\nsame, an energy-saving\
    \ ZigBee sensor network with bidirec-\ntional communication and end devices is\
    \ integrated to\ndeliver data from the sensors to the PC at variable times\ndetermined\
    \ by the central node [22]. SiloSense is a unique\narchitecture based on ZigBee\
    \ to monitor the storage condi-\ntions of grain silos to protect them from spoilage\
    \ and disease\n[23]. The most important parameters that are required to\nmonitor\
    \ while growing wheat and other vegetables are soil\nmoisture, ambient temperature,\
    \ air pressure, and sunlight\nintensity [24]. mIoT- and WSN-based agricultural\
    \ system\nare for monitoring air, temperature, soil moisture, and\nhumidity with\
    \ RF modules [25]. The cloud-based and IoT-\nbased smart irrigation system is\
    \ designed to obtain data on\nsoil moisture, soil health, and temperature to reduce\
    \ water\nconsumption [26, 27]. IoT-based greenhouse agriculture is\nimplemented\
    \ to monitor climatic conditions and to obtain\ndata on a cloud server for analysis,\
    \ while the ZigBee protocol\nand the Wi-Fi module are integrated [28, 29]. The\
    \ IoT-based\nframework is designed to perform data analysis using real-\ntime\
    \ data to increase productivity on farms through temper-\nature, soil moisture,\
    \ and humidity sensor [30, 31].\nIoT-enabled plant disease and pest prediction\
    \ system is\nimplemented to reduce the use of insecticides and fungicides,\nand\
    \ additionally, an assessment of meteorological data is also\ncarried out to identify\
    \ the correlation between pest growth\nand climate [32]. ML helps to examine and\
    \ analyze data from\ndiﬀerent ﬁelds of agriculture to improve crop yields and\
    \ oﬀers\ndiﬀerent analytical techniques to predict the yield of crop and\nplant\
    \ disease [33, 34]. The ML-based predictive model helps\nfarmers to get the right\
    \ harvest with unconditional weather\nbehavior [35]. ML algorithms such as neural\
    \ network-based\nmodels are used for predictive analysis purposes [36]. From\n\
    the literature review, it is identiﬁed that smart monitoring in\nthe agricultural\
    \ ﬁeld needs to carry out with advanced technol-\nogies such as IoT. The literature\
    \ also concludes that they are\nlimited studies that analyzed the accuracy of\
    \ the data obtained\nthrough sensors. In addition to this, customization of hard-\n\
    ware on the basis of agricultural ﬁeld requirement is limitedly\nexplored by the\
    \ previous researchers. ML technique is applied\non diﬀerent datasets for disease\
    \ detection, environmental\nparameters monitoring, and automation in irrigation,\
    \ but the\nprevious studies have yet to explore the crop recommendation\non the\
    \ basis of real-time data. However, implementing ML on\nreal-time data primarily\
    \ requires a resource-constrained and\ndedicated server to fulﬁll the task of\
    \ acquiring real-time agri-\ncultural data rather than using it for multiple purposes.\n\
    To overcome this research, the gap of this study imple-\nments customized IoT\
    \ hardware for obtaining the real-time\nﬁeld data through wireless personal area\
    \ network (WPAN)\nand wireless local area network (WLAN). WPAN enables to\nminimize\
    \ the power consumption and also transmits the sen-\nsor data reliably and securely.\
    \ WLAN is used to connect the\ncustomized hardware to the cloud server through\
    \ IP protocol.\nTo maintain accuracy in the data, the calibration methods are\n\
    applied on the sensors. It is also identiﬁed from the previous\nstudy that IoT\
    \ requires analytical techniques to provide intel-\nligent decisions based on\
    \ real-time sensor data obtained from\nIoT sensors [11]. The contributions of\
    \ the study are as follows:\n(i) Customized hardware for sensor node, master node,\n\
    and hand-held device with ZigBee RF modem is\ndesigned for sensing the real-time\
    \ data of agricul-\ntural ﬁeld including temperature, humidity, soil\npH, and\
    \ water level\n(ii) An interference test is implemented to verify that\nthe ZigBee\
    \ signal is not interfering with other\nsignals on the same frequency band\n(iii)\
    \ To enhance the security of data transmission, the\nsymmetric encryption approach\
    \ with a private key\nis applied by leveraging XXTea encryption functions\n(iv)\
    \ A cloud server is developed to log the real-time sen-\nsor data of the agricultural\
    \ ﬁeld\n(v) The pretrained machine learning model is applied\nto real-time data\
    \ such as temperature, humidity,\n2\nJournal of Sensors\nrainfall, and soil pH\
    \ sensor on the cloud server for\nseasonal crop recommendations\nThe organization\
    \ of the study is as follows: Section 1.1\ncovers the proposed system. Section\
    \ 2 covers the circuit dia-\ngram for the development of the system. Section 3\
    \ covers\nsimulation analysis and calibration. Section 4 covers the\nreal-time\
    \ implementation of developed nodes and the cur-\nrent consumption analysis. The\
    \ article is concluded in the\nﬁnal section.\n2. Proposed Architecture\nTo realize\
    \ the main objective of crop recommendation, in\nreal-time, machine learning is\
    \ utilized. This system intends\nto leverage multiple sensors with real-time data\
    \ collection\nsuch as temperature, humidity, rainfall, and soil pH sensor\nto\
    \ improve the eﬃciency and the recommendation of crops,\nwith the support of machine\
    \ learning techniques. As shown\nin Figure 1, the architecture is divided into\
    \ multiple mod-\nules, with both software and hardware parts, each with its\n\
    purpose, from the hardware nodes, for data collection; the\nserver, for data processing;\
    \ and ﬁnally, the hand-held device\nto the user.\nThe system is composed of various\
    \ environmental sen-\nsors that are deployed around the agricultural ﬁeld to collect\n\
    data on a variety of characteristics such as water level, tem-\nperature, soil\
    \ pH, and humidity. This information is then\nsent to the master node, the main\
    \ hub of our system, which\nis in charge of communicating with the developed cloud\n\
    server and transferring the data obtained from the sensors.\nIn the server, the\
    \ information is stored and is also run\nthrough the ML algorithm to be studied.\
    \ From there, based\non the algorithm’s analysis, the information is presented\
    \ to\nthe user on a handheld device, such as crop recommenda-\ntion. The crop\
    \ recommendation feature is activated from\nthe hand-held device, and recommendations\
    \ are received\non the hand-held device based on the user’s request.\n2.1. Data\
    \ Acquisition Layer. The data acquisition layer is the\nprimary layer of the architecture\
    \ for acquiring the environ-\nmental parameters of the agricultural ﬁeld. This\
    \ layer is specif-\nically dedicated to continuously monitor the environmental\n\
    parameters including water level, temperature, humidity, light\nintensity, and\
    \ rain level. For this, IoT sensors are attached to\nthe sensor node as shown\
    \ in Figure 2 and through 2.4GHz\nZigBee communication [37], it transmits data\
    \ to the master\nnode. In addition, the sensor node is enabled with security,\n\
    interference technique, and node mapping feature for secure\nand reliable communication.\n\
    2.2. Data Processing Layer. IoT devices and sensors record\nthe environmental\
    \ parameters of the agricultural ﬁeld in real\ntime. Sensory data processing is\
    \ done with the data process-\ning layer. The master node, which consists of the\
    \ ZigBee RF\nmodule, receives the data from the data acquisition layer and\ntransmits\
    \ it to the cloud server via a Wi-Fi module\n(Figure 3). The master node is powered\
    \ by the battery power\nsupply. The data logger is also available in the data\
    \ process-\ning layer for visualizing the sensor data through Bluetooth.\nThe\
    \ master node with a Wi-Fi module connects to the Inter-\nnet to log the sensory\
    \ data in the cloud server.\n2.3. Analytics and Visualization Layer. Figure 4\
    \ illustrates the\nsystem logic, where it explains the preprocessing and analysis\n\
    of gathered data from the sensor node. The sensor data is\nreceived at the master\
    \ node which is converted into a set of\nscripts and is logged into the cloud\
    \ server. Here, a cloud server\nis also developed to log the sensor node values.\
    \ In the prepro-\ncessing step, the sensor data is converted into a suitable format\n\
    for performing machine learning analyses. The data is fed to a\nmachine learning\
    \ model and based on the data the model, it\nsuggests recommended crop. The outcome\
    \ of the model is\nstored in the cloud server, and the hand-held device that con-\n\
    nects to the cloud server also visualizes the recommended crop\nand real-time\
    \ sensor data. To provide the user with a way to\nsee the data collected from\
    \ the sensors and machine learning\noutcomes, a cloud server is developed.\nA\
    \ cloud server is developed with two diﬀerent API pro-\ntocols for data exchange\
    \ between backend and frontend\nand backend and custom gateway. The interface\
    \ between\nthe backend and the frontend for the exchange of data is\nimplemented\
    \ with the REST API. REST APIs use HTTP\nrequests to perform basic database activities\
    \ within a\nresource, such as creating, reading, updating, and deleting\nrecords.\
    \ REST APIs accept JSON for the request payload\nand send responses to JSON. JSON\
    \ is the standard for data\ntransfer. The interface between the backend and the\
    \ gateway\nis implemented using the MQTT protocol. The cloud server\nassists in\
    \ checking all the sensor values retrieved from the\nagricultural ﬁeld in real\
    \ time. Moreover, a hand-held device\nis connected to the cloud server for providing\
    \ the updates of\nthe crop based on request generated by the user.\n3. Hardware\
    \ Development\nIn this section, we present the schematic diagram of the sen-\n\
    sor node that is primarily implemented for data acquisition.\nMoreover, the customization\
    \ is carried out for the hardware\nof agricultural monitoring including data logger\
    \ and hand-\nheld device. A detailed description of the sensor node and\nthe hand-held\
    \ device is presented below.\n3.1. Sensor Node. Figure 5 illustrates the connection\
    \ of diﬀer-\nent electronic components of the sensor node. The node is\ncomposed\
    \ of a 2.4 GHz RF modem that works in full-\nduplex mode to transmit the data\
    \ from one node to another\nconnected in the network. Principally, two sensors\
    \ (gas\nsensor and humidity sensor) are connected to the node\nwhich are placed\
    \ in the ﬁeld. The function of the gas sensor\nis to measure the concentration\
    \ of the gas (such as LPG and\nbutane) in the present environment. The humidity\
    \ of the\nenvironment is detected with the help of a humidity sensor.\nThe humidity\
    \ sensor gives serial data at the 9600 baud rate\nto the microcontroller. The\
    \ output of these sensors is in\nanalog form. Analog signal from the sensor is\
    \ fed onto the\nanalog to digital pin of the ATMEGA 8 [38].\nThe function of this\
    \ pin is to convert the analog signal\ninto a digital signal. After fetching the\
    \ signal from a sensor\n3\nJournal of Sensors\nattached, the microcontroller performs\
    \ the logical operation\nand controls the overall operation. A display (16∗2 LCD)\
    \ is\nattached to each node. The function of this is to display\nthe measured\
    \ parameters. MAX 232 IC is also used to pro-\nvide communication between the\
    \ node and PC. With the\nhelp of this, the end-user can easily observe the parameters\n\
    and execute the needful action. The whole circuit is working\non the 5 V power\
    \ supply. The RF module is attached to the\nSensor\nnode ‘1’\nMaster\nnode\nData\n\

    \ A Zig-\nBee module (CC2500) [37] is used in the system to provide\nwireless\
    \ communication in the network. This module works\nin full-duplex mode and also\
    \ can communicate with many\ndevices at the same time. The topology of each node\
    \ in the\npresented network is based on mesh topology. All the\nrequired components\
    \ are integrated and developed hard-\nware of the sensor node as shown in the\
    \ Figure 6. The sensor\nnode is integrated with LCD to visualize the sensor values.\n\
    3.2. Hand-Held Device. Figure 7 shows the circuit diagram of\na hand-held device\
    \ that consists of a Bluetooth modem. The\nmain function of this modem is to receive\
    \ the data trans-\nferred from the data logger node. This node is at the end-\n\
    user and easily provides the collected data to the end-user.\nThis node is connected\
    \ with other nodes in a mesh topology.\nA display is used for showing the measured\
    \ data. Based on\nthis data, end-user can easily take the decision. Figure 8 illus-\n\
    trates the hardware of the hand-held device, and the hand-\nheld device is also\
    \ integrated with display to visualize the\ndata like real-time sensor value and\
    \ crop recommendation.\n3.2.1. Current Consumption Analysis of Hardware. Current\n\
    consumption analysis is performed based on the current\nrequired by each component\
    \ used to develop the system.\nThe power consumption by the ZigBee RF modem is\
    \ maxi-\nmum for each node, followed by consumption by the micro-\ncontroller.\
    \ Even though power was not a design issue for the\nsystem, it is evident that\
    \ the designed system requires less\npower than standard available devices like\
    \ Mica2 and Micaz\nnodes. The current consumption analysis concludes that the\n\
    designed hardware is consuming less amount of power during\nthe data transmission.\
    \ Speciﬁcally, the hand-held device is\nonly consuming a current of 79mA. The\
    \ current consumption\nmay vary when the components in the hardware are increased.\n\
    From Table 1, it is concluded that the power consumption of\nnode 1 is 85mA, node\
    \ 2 is 85mA, node 3 is 264mA, node 4\nis 104mA, and node 5 is 83mA. To meet the\
    \ power require-\nment of the sensor node, an energy harvesting system will be\n\
    integrated into the sensor node in the future. In agriculture,\nsolar panels will\
    \ be used to implement solar energy harvesting\nsystems on sensor nodes. Table\
    \ 2 shows the current consump-\ntion of the hand-held device, and it is 79mA.\
    \ The power to the\nhand-held device is achieved with the battery.\nATMEGA 32\n\

    \ sensor calibration\nis performed to set the sensor to operate accurately and\n\
    without error. This section describes the sensor calibrations\n(temperature/humidity,\
    \ soil moisture, and ultrasonic) used\nto develop the system. Sensor calibration\
    \ is an important\nstep, before the actual implementation of the sensor in the\n\
    system. For the developed system, each sensor is ﬁrst cali-\nbrated with standard\
    \ instruments and after checking its\naccuracy, sensors are used in the system.\

    \ used. The\nultrasonic sensor is calibrated with a standard measurement\nruler.\
    \ Tests were carried out for each sensor and compared\nwith standard instruments,\
    \ and it was observed that the sen-\nsors were calibrated appropriately as follows.\n\
    3.3.1. Soil Moisture Sensor. The soil moisture sensor is taken\nfrom the Sunrom\
    \ model (http://sunrom.com/) no. 1282\n[39]. The sensor gives a reading in terms\
    \ of numerical\nvalues, as can be seen in Table 3. This sensor measures mois-\n\
    ture based on the volumetric water content in the soil. On\nthe other hand, the\
    \ standard oven method for ﬁnding soil\nmoisture gives a reading in percentage.\
    \ Initially, the sensor\nreadings are mapped by the oven method [40] to check\
    \ the\nerror between the sensor value and instrument value.\nFigure 9 shows the\
    \ relation between soil moisture content\nshown by the sensor and by standard\
    \ instrument. It provides\ncalibration values of the sensor concerning the percentage\n\
    value of the oven method. To validate the calibration,\nrepeated experiments were\
    \ conducted by taking soil samples\nfrom ﬁve diﬀerent places with valid water\
    \ content and cali-\nbrated them with the standard instruments. Table 4 shows\n\
    the sample readings by soil moisture content (%) with sensor\nvalues. The sensor\
    \ reading from the sensor is received by an\nanalog-to-digital converter (ADC)\
    \ and converted to a %\nvalue using equation (1). If the ADC value of the sensor\
    \ is\n255, then the value is considered 100% accurate concerning\nthe standard\
    \ oven method.\nSoil moisture %\nð Þ = wet soil g\nð Þ‐dry soil g\nð Þ\nð\nÞ ∗\n\

    \ is calibrated\nwith a standard scale. Table 5 clearly shows the bias value\n\
    between sensor value and scale which is 3cm in each case. So,\nthis biasing is\
    \ managed by programming the microcontroller\naccordingly. It shows a constant\
    \ bias value by the sensor, which\nis eliminated with the help of the microcontroller\
    \ program.\nAfter calibration, the sensor shows accurate readings.\n3.3.3. Temperature/Humidity\
    \ Sensor. Temperature/humidity\nis calibrated with a psychrometer [42]. It is\
    \ achieved by map-\nping the values of the sensor with that of the standard instru-\n\
    ment. The values are adjusted using programming the\ncontroller. The readings\
    \ are taken every half an hour in\nMarch 2020. As shown in Table 6, readings are\
    \ taken, and\nTable 1: Current consumption analysis of sensor nodes.\nComponents\n\

    \ used as per the calculation given\nin [43].\n3.4. Security and Interference\
    \ Test\n3.4.1. Security. As part of the security feature, during the\nimplementation\
    \ stage, we employ the AVR family of micro-\ncontrollers for applications comparable\
    \ to the one being\nproposed. Complex algorithms are a curse in AVR utilizing\n\
    time complex or memory because they frequently turn the\nexecuting code into a\
    \ blocking one, which means that any\nother routine to be conducted by the controller\
    \ is blocked\nand may create delays in executing the intended function.\nKeeping\
    \ these factors in mind, we should take considerable\nsensitivity while employing\
    \ cryptographic algorithms in\nthese low-bit controllers. Cryptographic functions\
    \ like\nXXTea and AVRCrypto can be used to implement the\nencryption method. In\
    \ our case, we use the XXTea encryp-\ntion functions to implement symmetric encryption\
    \ with pri-\nvate keys that remain exclusive to another layer of network\nnodes\
    \ to increase the security of data communication.\n3.4.2. Interference. The basic\
    \ parameter for detecting and\nhandling interference includes bit error rate (BER),\
    \ packet\nerror rate (PER), received signal strength indicator (RSSI),\nsignal-to-interference-to-noise\
    \ ratio (SINR), throughput,\nand time delay. In this study, we apply an interference\
    \ avoid-\nance algorithm based on frequency agility [39]. This algo-\nrithm allows\
    \ ZigBee to detect interference and ﬂexibly\nmove nodes to a secure channel with\
    \ minimal power con-\nsumption and minimal latency while handling the interfer-\n\
    ence. In this technique, the end devices measure PER with\na transmission time\
    \ of at least 20 packets, and if the PER\ngoes beyond the 25% level, the interference\
    \ information is\ntransferred to the parent router to assess the link quality\n\
    indicator (LQI). When the parent router determines that\nthe LQI value is less\
    \ than 100, it instructs the scanning\nenergy detection to perform interference\
    \ detection on acces-\nsible channels (ED).\nPER =\nNumber of failed messages\n\

    \ this study is that to\nchoose which algorithm is the best algorithm that can\
    \ be\nused not only in the system but in other situations with sim-\nilar data.\
    \ To do this, four diﬀerent classiﬁcation algorithms\nwere tested to see which\
    \ one had the highest accuracy.\n(a) Decision trees (DTs): through hierarchical\
    \ partition-\ning of training data, some functions are used to split\nthe data,\
    \ and this division is done iteratively until the\nleaf node contains the number\

    \ Creation. The complete hardware of the proposed\nsystem is shown in Figure 10(a).\
    \ Figure 10(b) illustrates the\nsensor node based on the 2.4 GHz ZigBee module\
    \ that is\nembedded with multiple sensors including water level, tem-\nperature,\
    \ humidity, pH, and light intensity. Moreover, the\nsensor node is interfaced\
    \ with a liquid crystal display for\nvisualizing the sensor data. In this study,\
    \ a custom sensor\nnode with IoT sensors is deployed in the agricultural sector\n\
    of the Maheru, Punjab region as shown in Figure 11. The\nsensor node is deployed\
    \ in an outdoor environment to get\ndata from the sensors in real time. As discussed\
    \ earlier in\nthis section, the sensor node is interfaced with multiple sen-\n\
    sors to detect the environmental parameters of the farm ﬁeld\nand communicate\
    \ with the cloud server through a master\nnode based on 2.4 GHz ZigBee communication\
    \ and wireless\nﬁdelity (Wi-Fi).\nThe input parameters of the sensor data are\
    \ temperature,\nhumidity, water level, and soil pH. The 32,000 samples of\nIoT\
    \ sensor nodes over 6 months are used to build a dataset\nfor training. The manual\
    \ data splitting methods have been\nadopted in which the total number of samples\
    \ is divided into\ntraining and testing samples. The 70: 30 ratio is chosen for\n\
    the proposed dataset, in which 70% for training and 30%\nfor testing as shown\
    \ in Table 7.\nDuring dataset generation, besides collected timestamps\nand sensor\
    \ data, other features were added to each record\nbased on calculations and preprocessed\
    \ data from the values\nof the sensor. Table 8 shows the features of each data\
    \ set.\nThe diﬀerence between datasets is that the standard one only\nhas one\
    \ entry for each of the features while the clustered one\nhas three entries for\
    \ sensorID, average, value, and diﬀ_sen,\neach one regarding the three sensors\
    \ used in the test.\n4.2. Model Analysis. A variety of ML algorithms were used\
    \ to\nanalyze the model to ﬁnd the best one to use in our system.\nFor our case,\
    \ we performed a total of 8 tests for each\nalgorithm, each with a diﬀerent set\
    \ of parameters, to train\nthe algorithms to determine which one has the highest\n\
    accuracy so that it can be applied in our system. Each test\nwas run using Python,\
    \ the scikit-learn library [37], and the\nSpyder platform. Scripts were developed\
    \ for each algo-\nrithm using the appropriate library for scikit-learn classiﬁ-\n\
    cation and used the default conﬁguration. As mentioned\nearlier, 70% of the dataset\
    \ was used for training, and\n30% was used for testing. Table 9 shows the results\
    \ of\neach test, and Figure 12 shows the same results to improve\nthe analysis.\n\

    \ number of the data samples, and y-axis\ndenotes the range of temperature, humidity,\
    \ rain level, and\nsoil pH. In the temperature plot, orange denotes the wheat\n\
    crop, and blue color denotes the rice crop.\nBased on the temperature, humidity,\
    \ rain level, and soil\npH, the optimal crops are recommended. For example, in\n\
    the temperature plot, for the temperature range of 39°C-\n45°C, the recommended\
    \ crop is wheat. In case of humidity,\nthe minimum humidity level is recommended\
    \ for the wheat\ncrop. Rice crop is recommended for the rain level of 3 mm\nand\
    \ the pH value of 8, and the wheat crop is recommended.\nThe recommendation of\
    \ the crop is delivered on the basis of\ntrained data, and it may vary with other\
    \ location, as the\ndataset is developed through the real-time data of the study\n\
    location. In case, if the hardware needed to implement in\nother location, then\
    \ the customized hardware with IoT sen-\nsors needs to be developed for a certain\
    \ period of time for\nthe development of dataset.\nIn Figure 14, the crop recommendation\
    \ is processed\nbased on temperature, humidity, nutrients, and light inten-\n\
    sity. The x-axis denotes the number of the data samples,\nand y-axis denotes the\
    \ range of temperature, humidity,\nnutrients, and light intensity. In the temperature\
    \ plot, blue\ndenotes the green leaves, and violent color denotes tomatoes.\n\
    Based on the temperature, humidity, nutrients, and light\nintensity, the optimal\
    \ crops are recommended. In the tem-\nperature plot, for the temperature range\
    \ of 20°C-30°C, the\nrecommended crop is tomato. At the temperature of 35°C,\n\
    the plot concludes that green leaves and tomato crops are\nrecommended.\nIn case\
    \ of humidity, if the range of humidity level is\nbetween 60% and 70%, then both\
    \ crops including green\nleaves and tomato are recommended. The tomato crop is\n\
    recommended for the nutrients level in between 0 and 1%.\nIf the light intensity\
    \ is at 8 candelas, then tomato crop is\nhighly recommended. The hand-held device\
    \ based on the\ncloud server also receives the crop recommendation through\nthe\
    \ Internet based on demand. Table 10 presents the com-\nparison of smart agriculture\
    \ monitoring with previous stud-\nies. To validate the proposed study, the following\
    \ evaluation\nparameters are communication, data processing, analytics,\nsimulation,\
    \ calibration, and hand-held device. The proposed\nstudy oﬀers the advantages\
    \ of a communication protocol\nthat uses both 2.4 GHz ZigBee and Wi-Fi.\nThe integration\
    \ of these two-communication platforms\nenables to obtain the data locally and\
    \ also in the cloud. From\nthe table, it is concluded that the proposed study\
    \ is having\nbeneﬁcial in terms of providing the real-time data to the\nusers\
    \ on the hand-held device through stable and reliable\ncommunication. As seen\
    \ in the previous studies, many\nresearchers have implemented the advanced wireless\
    \ com-\nmunication technology like LoRa. The deployment of the\nLoRa-based sensor\
    \ nodes increases the infrastructure cost\nas compared to ZigBee-based sensor\
    \ nodes. However, LoRa\nand ZigBee can be utilized combinedly in the agricultural\n\
    ﬁeld monitoring in the following manner.\nZigBee-based sensor nodes can be deployed\
    \ in the agri-\ncultural ﬁeld to monitor environmental parameters, and\nthe single\
    \ LoRa-based node can act as supervisor node to\nall the ZigBee-based sensor nodes.\
    \ This LoRa-based node con-\nnects to the gateway, as LoRa can transmit the data\
    \ to a long\nrange. From there, the information of ZigBee-based sensor\nnode can\
    \ be visualized on the cloud server. This approach\ncan be implemented to enhance\
    \ the connectivity and minimize\ninfrastructure cost. This study have enhanced\
    \ the hardware\nwith node mapping feature, frequency agility interference\navoidance,\
    \ and XXTea encryption features. All these features\nare logged in the hardware\
    \ during the programming.\n6. Conclusions\nReal-time smart monitoring with intelligence\
    \ has gained sig-\nniﬁcant attention for increasing crop productivity. At the\n\
    moment, IoT generates a large amount of real-time data\nfrom sensors, actuators,\
    \ and identiﬁcation technologies.\nHowever, extracting meaningful insights from\
    \ data is\nrequired for the intelligent ecosystem and portable device\nfor monitoring\
    \ of agriculture. The current study is focused\non implementing the customized\
    \ hand-held device for\nassisting the farmers with crop recommendation with ML.\n\
    To realize it, ﬁrst, the customized hardware is designed,\nand sensors are calibrated\
    \ to obtain the error free data. In\naddition to this, security is also inbuilt\
    \ in the customized\nhardware for secure transmission of data on the cloud\nserver.\
    \ As the real-time data is available in the cloud server,\nit is utilized for\
    \ forming dataset to conclude to the optimal\nML model for crop recommendation.\
    \ After identifying the\noptimal ML model, it has been applied on the cloud server.\n\
    Based on this, the ML model recommends the crop from\nthe real-time data that\
    \ is generated from the customized\nhardware.\nData Availability\nData will be\
    \ available on request. For the data-related queries,\nkindly contact to Baseem\

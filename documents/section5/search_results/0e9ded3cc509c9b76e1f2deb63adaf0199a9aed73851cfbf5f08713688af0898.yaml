    ERDC/GRL TR-18-1 Abstract:  This paper reviews an approach to increase soil moisture
    resolution over a sample region over Australia using the Soil Moisture Active
    Passive (SMAP) sensor and Landsat 8 only. This approach uses an inductive localized
    approach, eschewing the need to obtain a resilient and definitive model in favor
    of a temporary model that utilizes current conditional inputs only. For the purposes
    of this analysis, the SMAP 36 km soil moisture product is considered fully valid
    and accurate. Landsat bands coinciding in collection date with a SMAP capture
    are down sampled to match the resolution of the SMAP product. A series of indices
    describing the Soil-Vegetation-Atmosphere Triangle (SVAT) relationship are then
    produced using the down sampled Landsat bands. These indices are then related
    to the local coincident SMAP values to identify a series of rules or trees to
    identify the local rules defining the relationship between soil moisture and the
    aforementioned indices. This paper uses a random forest due to its highly accurate
    learning against local ground truth data. The defined rules are then applied to
    the Landsat image in the native Landsat resolution to determine local soil moisture.
    Ground truth comparison is done via a series of grids using time dielectric impedance
    and airborne L-band Multi-beam Radiometer (PLMR) observations done under the SMAPEx-5
    campaign (Panciera 2013). The predictive power of the inferred learning soil moisture
    algorithm (ILSMA) did well with a mean absolute error of 0.054 over an airborne
    L-band retrieved surface over the same region. Description:  Technical Report
